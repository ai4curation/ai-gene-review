  - text: <p>The rhodopsin-like GPCRs (GPCRA) represent a widespread protein family
      that includes hormone, neurotransmitter and light receptors, all of which transduce
      extracellular signals through interaction with guanine nucleotide-binding (G)
      proteins. Although their activating ligands vary widely in structure and character,
      the amino acid sequences of the receptors are very similar and are believed
      to adopt a common structural framework comprising 7 transmembrane (TM) helices
      [[cite:PUB00000131], [cite:PUB00002477], [cite:PUB00004960]].</p>

  - text: <p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a vast protein family
      that encompasses a wide range of functions, including various autocrine, paracrine
      and endocrine processes. They show considerable diversity at the sequence level,
      on the basis of which they can be separated into distinct groups [[cite:PUB00053635]].
      The term clan can be used to describe the GPCRs, as they embrace a group of
      families for which there are indications of evolutionary relationship, but between
      which there is no statistically significant similarity in sequence [[cite:PUB00004961]].
      The currently known clan members include rhodopsin-like GPCRs (Class A, GPCRA),
      secretin-like GPCRs (Class B, GPCRB), metabotropic glutamate receptor family
      (Class C, GPCRC), fungal mating pheromone receptors (Class D, GPCRD), cAMP receptors
      (Class E, GPCRE) and frizzled/smoothened (Class F, GPCRF) [[cite:PUB00004961],
      [cite:PUB00063577], [cite:PUB00063578], [cite:PUB00063579], [cite:PUB00063580]].  GPCRs
      are major drug targets, and are consequently the subject of considerable research
      interest. It has been reported that the repertoire of GPCRs for endogenous ligands
      consists of approximately 400 receptors in humans and mice [[cite:PUB00053635]].
      Most GPCRs are identified on the basis of their DNA sequences, rather than the
      ligand they bind, those that are unmatched to known natural ligands are designated
      by as orphan GPCRs, or unclassified GPCRs [[cite:PUB00063816]].</p>
