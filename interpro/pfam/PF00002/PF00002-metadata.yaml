    short: 7tm_2
  description:
  - text: <p>This family is known as Family B, the secretin-receptor family or family
      2 of the G-protein-coupled receptors (GCPRs). They have been described in many
      animal species, but not in plants, fungi or prokaryotes. Three distinct sub-families
      are recognised. Subfamily B1 contains classical hormone receptors, such as receptors
      for secretin and glucagon, that are all involved in cAMP-mediated signalling
      pathways. Subfamily B2 contains receptors with long extracellular N-termini,
      such as the leukocyte cell-surface antigen CD97 ([swissprot:P48960]); calcium-independent
      receptors for latrotoxin (such as [swissprot:O94910]), and brain-specific angiogenesis
      inhibitors (such as [swissprot:O14514]) amongst others. Subfamily B3 includes
      Methuselah and other Drosophila proteins (e.g. [swissprot:P83119]). Other than
      the typical seven-transmembrane region, characteristic structural features include
      an amino-terminal extracellular domain involved in ligand binding, and an intracellular
      loop (IC3) required for specific G-protein coupling [[cite:PUB00019074]].</p>
