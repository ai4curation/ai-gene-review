  description:
  - text: The ORC1/CDC6 family includes proteins that are key regulators of DNA replication.
      Members of the family are involved in the initiation of DNA replication by binding
      to origins of replication, which is often ATP-dependent. They play a role in
      the assembly of the pre-replication complex necessary to commence DNA replication.
      Some family members also participate in checkpoint controls to ensure DNA replication
      is completed before mitosis begins. Additionally, certain proteins within the
      family have roles in transcriptional silencing, chromatin structure modulation,
      and cell cycle control of replication. They may bind to specific DNA sequences,
      such as the ARS consensus sequence in some species, and can interact with other
      proteins like the MCM helicase complex to regulate the replication process.
