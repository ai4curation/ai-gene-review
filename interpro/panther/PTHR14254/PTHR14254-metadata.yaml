  description:
  - text: The protein family includes non-receptor tyrosine-protein and serine/threonine-protein
      kinases involved in cell signaling, particularly in relation to EGFR. The family
      members are implicated in various cellular processes such as cell spreading,
      migration, survival, growth, and proliferation. They act as downstream effectors
      of CDC42, mediating cell migration and influencing synaptic function and brain
      development. The kinases phosphorylate a range of substrates, including AKT1,
      AR, and WWOX, playing roles in endocytosis, ubiquitination, and tumor growth
      regulation. Additionally, the family encompasses negative regulators of EGFR
      signaling, which inhibit EGFR catalytic activity and autophosphorylation, affecting
      keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, and responses to steroid hormones.
