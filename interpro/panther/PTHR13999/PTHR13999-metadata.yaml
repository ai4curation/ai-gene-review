    name: Interferon-induced transmembrane antiviral protein
    short: IFITM_antiviral_protein
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in antiviral defense mechanisms, particularly
      by inhibiting the entry and fusion of various enveloped viruses with host cell
      membranes. They act by altering intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and preventing
      viral fusion with cholesterol-depleted endosomes. These proteins are also implicated
      in cell adhesion, growth, migration, and the antiproliferative action of interferon-gamma.
      Additionally, they play roles in bone mineralization and the structural stability
      and function of vacuolar ATPase, which is critical for acidifying phagocytic
      endosomes and establishing an antiviral state. They exhibit coordinated activity
      in hepatocytes to restrict certain viral infections by targeting virions for
      lysosomal degradation.
