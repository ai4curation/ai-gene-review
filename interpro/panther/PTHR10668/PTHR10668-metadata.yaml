  description:
  - text: The carotenoid/retinoid oxidoreductase family encompasses a group of probable
      oxidoreductases that are implicated in various biochemical processes. Members
      of this family are involved in the regulation of mitochondrial function, suggesting
      a role in cellular energy metabolism. Additionally, some enzymes within this
      family participate in the degradation of cyclic monoterpenes such as limonene,
      catalyzing the oxidation to form perillyl alcohol. These enzymes exhibit activity
      towards both R- and S-enantiomers of limonene and can oxidize a range of monocyclic
      monoterpenes. The natural electron acceptor for these reactions is likely a
      heterodimeric electron transfer flavoprotein, rather than molecular oxygen.
      The presence of molecular oxygen can reduce the specific activity of some family
      members by 40%, indicating a regulatory mechanism for enzyme activity.
