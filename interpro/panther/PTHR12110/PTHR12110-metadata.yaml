    name: Inositol Catabolism and Carbohydrate Metabolism
    short: IolE/MocC_CarboMetab
  description:
  - text: The IolE/MocC family proteins are primarily involved in the metabolism of
      inositol and its derivatives. They catalyze the dehydration of inosose to 3D-(3,5/4)-trihydroxycyclohexane-1,2-dione,
      a key step in the catabolism of inositol. Inosose dehydratases from this family
      convert 2-keto-myo-inositol to D-2,3-diketo-4-deoxy-epi-inositol. Additionally,
      some members are implicated in the reversible interconversion of 2-keto-myo-inositol
      to 1-keto-D-chiro-inositol. The family also includes proteins involved in the
      catabolism of rhizopine, xylose, and other sugars, highlighting a broader role
      in carbohydrate metabolism. The enzymes exhibit a diverse range of substrate
      specificities and activities, including epimerization of ketoses and dehydration
      reactions, contributing to various metabolic pathways across different organisms.
