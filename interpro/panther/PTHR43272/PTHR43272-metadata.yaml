  description:
  - text: The ATP-dependent AMP-binding enzyme family is involved in the activation
      of fatty acids by catalyzing their conversion to acyl-CoA thioesters. This process
      is essential for both the synthesis of cellular lipids and the degradation of
      fatty acids via beta-oxidation. Members of this family exhibit a preference
      for long-chain fatty acids, although some can also activate very long-chain
      and medium-chain fatty acids, as well as a variety of saturated, monosaturated,
      and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The activated acyl-CoAs are used in various
      cellular processes, including lipid biosynthesis, energy metabolism, and the
      regulation of apoptosis. Some family members have specific roles, such as in
      brain lipid metabolism, spermatogenesis, and plant seed germination.
