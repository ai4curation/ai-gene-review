  description:
  - text: The CRBN family proteins are recognized as substrate recognition components
      of the DCX (DDB1-CUL4-X-box) E3 protein ligase complex, which is involved in
      the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of various target proteins. These
      proteins play crucial roles in regulating developmental processes such as limb
      outgrowth and expression of fibroblast growth factor FGF8. They are also implicated
      in the maintenance of cognitive functions by modulating presynaptic glutamate
      release through the negative regulation of large-conductance calcium-activated
      potassium (BK) channels in excitatory neurons. Additionally, CRBN family members
      are involved in insulin signaling pathways, influencing growth and metabolism.
      Some family members interact with components of the TLR4 signaling pathway,
      potentially affecting immune responses. The human CRBN protein uniquely binds
      thalidomide and related drugs, altering the substrate specificity of the E3
      ligase complex.
