  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes regulators of gene expression and cell
      cycle progression. Members are involved in the regulation of transcription and
      the inhibition of DNA-binding proteins, affecting the expression of genes that
      control processes such as protease production and genetic competence. Additionally,
      some family members play a role in mitotic events, particularly in the condensation
      of spindle midzone microtubules and the formation of the midbody, which are
      critical for cell division and cytokinesis. The family also includes proteins
      that are subject to inhibition by specific peptide inhibitors, which modulate
      their regulatory activity.
