  description:
  - text: The SRCR-S1 Scavenger Receptor family is involved in a range of biological
      processes including immune defense, cellular adhesion, endocytosis, and neuronal
      plasticity. Members of this family are known to bind and aggregate pathogens,
      mediate the uptake of various molecules such as modified LDL, ferritin-bound
      iron, and hemoglobin/haptoglobin complexes, and play roles in atherogenesis,
      mucosal defense, liver regeneration, taste sensation, and learning and memory
      operations. They are characterized by the presence of SRCR domains, which mediate
      interactions with ligands in a calcium-dependent manner, and some members belong
      to the peptidase S1 family, indicating a role in proteolytic processing.
