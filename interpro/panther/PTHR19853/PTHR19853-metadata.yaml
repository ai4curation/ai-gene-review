    name: TBC1 domain family involved in cilium biogenesis
    short: TBC1_cilium_biogenesis
  description:
  - text: The TBC1 domain family is involved in cilium biogenesis and functions as
      a molecular adapter. It is part of a complex that includes the centriolar protein
      OFD1, which is essential for cilium assembly. Members of the family may regulate
      the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of OFD1, leading to its ubiquitination by
      PJA2 and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Additionally, some members are
      implicated in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the nucleolar processing
      of pre-18S ribosomal RNA as part of the small subunit processome.
