    short: NOS
  description:
  - text: The Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) family is responsible for the production
      of nitric oxide (NO), a versatile messenger molecule with a wide range of biological
      functions. Members of the NOS family catalyze the conversion of L-arginine to
      L-citrulline, releasing NO in the process. NO plays a critical role in various
      physiological processes including neurotransmission, vascular smooth muscle
      relaxation, immune response, and regulation of gene expression. The family includes
      inducible forms that are stimulated by inflammatory signals and constitutive
      forms that are regulated by calcium/calmodulin. Some NOS proteins also exhibit
      nitrosylase activity, mediating the S-nitrosylation of cytoplasmic target proteins,
      which can affect their function and activity.
