    name: X-linked Lymphocyte-regulated/Synaptonemal Complex Protein 3
    short: XLR/SYCP3
  description:
  - text: The XLR/SYCP3 family proteins are key components of the synaptonemal complexes
      (SCS), which form between homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase. They
      play a crucial role in centromere pairing during meiosis in male germ cells,
      which is essential for normal meiosis and male fertility. These proteins also
      contribute to female fertility, albeit to a lesser extent. They are involved
      in the efficient phosphorylation of HORMAD1 and HORMAD2, which are important
      for meiotic progression. The family members are characterized by a long central
      coiled coil domain, with N-terminal and C-terminal regions that interact with
      DNA, indicating a structural role in chromosome pairing and synapsis.
