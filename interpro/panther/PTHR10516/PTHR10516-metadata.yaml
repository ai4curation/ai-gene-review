    name: FKBP-type Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans Isomerase
    short: FKBP-type_PPIase
  description:
  - text: The FKBP-type PPIase family is characterized by its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans
      isomerase activity, which accelerates the folding of proteins by catalyzing
      the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides.
      Members of this family play a role in various cellular processes, including
      sexual development, TGF-beta receptor regulation, and modulation of calcium
      channel activity. They are also known for their interaction with immunosuppressive
      drugs, being inhibited by FK506 and rapamycin, which highlights their potential
      contribution to the pharmacological effects of these compounds.
