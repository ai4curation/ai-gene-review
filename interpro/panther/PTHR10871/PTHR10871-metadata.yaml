  description:
  - text: The universal ribosomal protein uS13 family is involved in the structure
      and function of the ribosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible
      for protein synthesis in the cell. Proteins in this family are located at the
      top of the head of the small ribosomal subunit, making contact with several
      helices of the rRNA. In the 70S ribosome, they contact the 23S rRNA and protein
      L5 of the large subunit, forming bridges that are implicated in the movement
      of the subunits. These proteins also contact the tRNAs in the A and P sites,
      playing a role in the translation process by ensuring proper positioning and
      movement of tRNAs and mRNA during protein synthesis.
