    name: Ataxin-10 and Copper transport protein 86 families
    short: Ataxin-10/CTR86_families
  description:
  - text: The Ataxin-10 family proteins are essential for the survival and maintenance
      of cerebellar neurons. They are involved in neuritogenesis through the activation
      of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. Additionally, they may contribute to the regulation
      of intracellular glycosylation levels and homeostasis. The Copper transport
      protein 86 family members are implicated in threonine biosynthesis and are considered
      essential proteins.
