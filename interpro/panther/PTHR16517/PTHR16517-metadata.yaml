  description:
  - text: The TUB family proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes
      including signal transduction from G protein-coupled receptors, transcription
      regulation, and lipid metabolism. They play roles in the regulation of body
      weight, sensory functions, lifespan control, and neuronal trafficking. Some
      family members function as components of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, mediating
      ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of target proteins. They are also
      implicated in photoreceptor cell maintenance, development of photoreceptor synapses,
      and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. TUB family proteins bind to membranes containing
      phosphatidylinositol phosphates and are involved in ciliary trafficking of proteins,
      which is crucial for sensory perception and signal transduction pathways such
      as the Shh pathway.
