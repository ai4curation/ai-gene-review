  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that are involved in various cellular
      processes, including immune response modulation, cell differentiation, and regulation
      of cell motility. Some proteins in this family function as inhibitors of T-cell
      proliferation and IL2 production, playing roles in immune regulation. Others
      are implicated in adipocyte differentiation by promoting the expression of specific
      transcription factors. Additionally, certain family members are involved in
      the negative regulation of cell motility, interacting with other proteins to
      influence cell migration, fusion, and morphology. Some proteins also participate
      in maintaining neural networks and enhancing calcium channel currents in photoreceptors,
      indicating a role in neural and visual functions.
