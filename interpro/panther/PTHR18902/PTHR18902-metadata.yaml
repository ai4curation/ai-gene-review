    name: Microtubule and Golgi organization protein
    short: MT-Golgi_org_protein
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the organization and maintenance
      of cellular structures and processes. Members function in the formation and
      stabilization of microtubules, which are critical for mitotic spindle formation,
      chromosome alignment and segregation, and spindle pole establishment during
      cell division. Some proteins in this family act as golgins, which are thought
      to tether transport vesicles to the trans-Golgi network and regulate vesicular
      transport between endosomes and the Golgi apparatus. They may also be involved
      in the biogenesis of Golgi-associated microtubules. Additionally, certain members
      play roles in DNA damage response, primary cilia formation, epidermal differentiation,
      and hair follicle morphogenesis. The proteins typically contain coiled-coil
      domains and may interact with various phosphoinositides and other proteins to
      execute their functions.
