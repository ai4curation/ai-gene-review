  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the stabilization and assembly of
      microtubules. Members are known to associate dynamically with microtubules and
      may play significant roles during the polarization and differentiation of epithelial
      cells. They are also implicated in the formation of intercellular contacts and
      may interact with other proteins, such as TRPV4, to mediate their redistribution
      towards the cell membrane, potentially linking cytoskeletal microfilaments and
      influencing cell shape and signaling.
