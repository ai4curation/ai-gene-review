  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes enzymes that catalyze the transfer of ribitol
      5-phosphate from CDP-L-ribitol to a phosphorylated O-mannosyl trisaccharide
      structure present in alpha-dystroglycan, which is a crucial step in the post-translational
      modification of this protein. The modification involves the formation of a ribose
      5-phosphate tandem repeat, linking the trisaccharide to a ligand-binding domain
      composed of xylosyl and glucuronic acid repeats. This process is essential for
      the proper functioning of alpha-dystroglycan, which plays a significant role
      in cell-matrix interactions and is important for the stability of muscle tissue
      and neuronal migration.
