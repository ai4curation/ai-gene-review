  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in crucial cellular processes including
      the mitotic checkpoint, ensuring cells do not prematurely exit mitosis. Members
      are essential for the assembly of protein complexes onto kinetochores, which
      is critical for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. Some proteins
      in this family are also implicated in the regulation of membrane traffic between
      the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum, potentially influencing SNARE
      assembly at the ER. Additionally, certain members may play a role in the maturation
      of seed storage proteins in plants and are associated with complexes such as
      the RZZ and NRZ, which are involved in spindle assembly and membrane traffic
      regulation, respectively.
