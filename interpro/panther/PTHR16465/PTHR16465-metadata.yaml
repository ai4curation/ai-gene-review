    name: Zinc finger matrin/CCCH-type domain-containing protein
    short: Zinc_finger_matrin/CCCH-type
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes zinc finger matrin-type and CCCH-type proteins
      that are characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains. These domains
      facilitate binding to nucleic acids and are typically involved in RNA binding
      and regulation of gene expression. The matrin-type zinc finger proteins are
      known to play roles in RNA processing and may be involved in cellular responses
      to stress. The CCCH-type proteins often participate in mRNA metabolism, including
      mRNA splicing, export, and degradation. The presence of zinc finger domains
      in these proteins suggests a broad role in the regulation of gene expression
      at the post-transcriptional level.
