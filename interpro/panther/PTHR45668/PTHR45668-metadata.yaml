  description:
  - text: The PPP phosphatase family is involved in a variety of cellular processes
      including apoptosis, differentiation, DNA damage response, cell survival, regulation
      of ion channels, circadian rhythms, and phototransduction. Members of the family
      dephosphorylate a wide range of proteins such as kinases, nuclear receptors,
      SMAD proteins, and TAU/MAPT, influencing signaling pathways related to steroid
      and thyroid hormones, calcium, fatty acids, TGF-beta, oxidative and genotoxic
      stresses. They participate in DNA damage response mechanisms, checkpoint activation,
      and DNA damage repair. Some members regulate adipogenesis and circadian rhythms,
      while others are implicated in the regulation of the Hsp90 chaperone machinery
      and photoreceptor function. The family includes subfamilies such as PP-5 (PP-T)
      and PP-7, with some members possessing TPR repeats for protein-protein interactions
      and autoinhibition, or EF-hands for calcium activation.
