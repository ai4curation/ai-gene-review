  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the dynamic reorganization of the
      actin cytoskeleton. They are key players in the recruitment and activation of
      the WASL protein, working in conjunction with NCK1 and GRB2. These proteins
      are also implicated in the modulation of WASL's subcellular localization, which
      is crucial for the transition from stress fiber formation to the generation
      of filopodia and cell ruffles. Additionally, they have a role in intracellular
      viral motility, specifically by aiding the recruitment of WASL to certain viruses
      within infected cells.
