  description:
  - text: The protein family is involved in various immune and developmental processes.
      Members act as cofactors for complement factor I, protecting cells from complement-mediated
      injury by cleaving C3b and C4b. They play roles in cell adhesion, mediating
      interactions between cells and the endothelium, and are implicated in lymphatic
      vascular development. Some members serve as receptors for pathogens, facilitating
      immune evasion or cell entry. Others are involved in reproductive processes,
      such as sperm-egg fusion, and in immune regulation by inducing T-regulatory
      cell differentiation. Additionally, they bind negatively charged substances,
      potentially regulating coagulation or complement cascades, and participate in
      the clearance of complement-opsonized pathogens.
