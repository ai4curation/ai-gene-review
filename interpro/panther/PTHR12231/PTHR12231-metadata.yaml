    name: Neural and epithelial cell adhesion domain-containing protein
    short: Neural/epithelial_adhesion
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes cell adhesion molecules that are primarily
      involved in neural development and function. They play crucial roles in neuron-neuron
      adhesion, neurite outgrowth, fasciculation, and the development of nerve fascicles.
      Some members are implicated in maintaining the integrity of the trans-epithelial
      diffusion barrier and may also participate in early neuronal differentiation.
      Additionally, certain proteins within this family have been identified as receptors
      for various microbial infections, indicating a role in immune response or pathogen
      interaction. The family also includes proteins that contribute to cell migration,
      proliferation, morphology, and survival, particularly in the context of renal
      epithelial cells. Overall, these proteins are essential for proper neural network
      formation and maintenance, as well as other cellular processes.
