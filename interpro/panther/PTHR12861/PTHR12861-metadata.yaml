    name: Translocon-associated protein subunit beta
    short: TRAP_beta
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocon
      complex, functioning to bind calcium at the ER membrane. The primary role of
      these proteins is to regulate the retention of proteins that reside in the ER,
      ensuring proper localization and functioning of these resident proteins. The
      binding of calcium is a critical aspect of their function, as it influences
      the stability and dynamics of the ER membrane and its associated complexes.
