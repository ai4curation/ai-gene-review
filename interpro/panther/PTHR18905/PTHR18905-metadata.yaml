  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the organization and dynamics of
      microtubules, particularly in relation to the centrosome and centrioles. Members
      of this family play crucial roles in the positioning and anchorage of microtubule
      minus-ends within cells, which is essential for maintaining cellular structure
      and facilitating intracellular transport. Some family members are known to participate
      in the recruitment of the gamma-tubulin ring complex to the centrosome, influencing
      microtubule nucleation. Additionally, these proteins are implicated in the regulation
      of organelle and vesicle transport, with specific relevance to photoreceptor
      cell function. Overexpression of certain family members can disrupt the Golgi
      apparatus and affect mitotic spindle assembly. Furthermore, the family includes
      proteins with domains necessary for controlled degradation during the cell cycle.
