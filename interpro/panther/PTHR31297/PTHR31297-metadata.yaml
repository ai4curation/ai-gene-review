  description:
  - text: The glycosyl hydrolase 5 (cellulase A) family encompasses enzymes with a
      variety of functions related to the hydrolysis and metabolism of cellulosic
      and other glucan-based polysaccharides. Members of this family are involved
      in the breakdown of cell wall components such as beta-glucan, a key structural
      element in fungal and plant cell walls. They exhibit activities such as endoglucanase,
      beta-glucosidase, and transglycosylase, targeting linkages in cellulose, lichenin,
      cereal beta-D-glucans, and xyloglucans. These enzymes play crucial roles in
      processes like cell wall remodeling during growth, sporulation, and thermoresistance
      of spores, as well as in the degradation of biomass for nutrient acquisition.
      Some members also participate in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides, contributing
      to the integrity and plasticity of cell walls. The family includes enzymes that
      can degrade larger cellooligosaccharides and exhibit specificity for different
      types of glucan substrates.
