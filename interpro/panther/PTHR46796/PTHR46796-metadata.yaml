    name: AraC/XylS family transcriptional regulators
    short: AraC_XylS_family_regulators
  description:
  - text: The AraC/XylS family proteins are transcriptional regulators that respond
      to specific environmental stimuli by activating or repressing the expression
      of various operons. Members of this family typically contain a helix-turn-helix
      (HTH) motif that facilitates DNA binding. They regulate diverse functions, including
      the metabolism of sugars such as L-rhamnose and L-arabinose, degradation of
      aromatic compounds like toluene and xylene, and control of virulence genes.
      The activators in this family, such as RhaS and RhaR, induce the expression
      of operons like rhaBAD and rhaT in response to L-rhamnose availability. Other
      members, like AraC, can function as both activators and repressors, regulating
      arabinose operons based on the presence or absence of arabinose. Some proteins
      within this family are involved in the response to environmental stresses or
      the regulation of genes important for pathogenicity.
