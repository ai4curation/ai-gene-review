  description:
  - text: The GTP-binding SRP family is involved in the recognition and targeting
      of nascent proteins to the appropriate cellular membranes, ensuring their proper
      insertion and translocation. Members of this family, such as FtsY and SRP receptor
      subunits, form GTP-dependent complexes with the signal recognition particle
      (SRP) and its subunit SRP54, facilitating the cotranslational targeting of secretory
      proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum or cytoplasmic membrane. Some family members,
      like FlhF, are necessary for flagellar biosynthesis and may assist in protein
      translocation within flagella. Others are implicated in mitochondrial protein
      import or chloroplast-associated processes, such as LHCP integration into thylakoids.
      The family is characterized by the presence of an NG or G domain, which undergoes
      cooperative rearrangements to activate GTPase activity, driving protein translocation.
      Additionally, some members exhibit regulatory functions in stress response,
      lipid metabolism, and cell wall processes.
