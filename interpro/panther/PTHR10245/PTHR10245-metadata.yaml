  description:
  - text: The MBF1 family proteins function as transcriptional coactivators, bridging
      DNA-binding regulators and TBP (TATA-binding protein), thus facilitating the
      recruitment of TBP to promoters. They play a role in various cellular processes,
      including the activation of GCN4-dependent transcription, stress response, and
      the ribosome quality control pathway, which targets aberrant translation for
      degradation. Some family members are involved in specific cellular contexts,
      such as heat and osmotic stress tolerance, nucleolar localization, and possibly
      in endothelial cell differentiation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.
