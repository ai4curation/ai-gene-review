  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the composition and function of the
      extracellular matrix (ECM). They play a crucial role in cell-matrix interactions,
      influencing cellular behaviors such as adhesion, motility, differentiation,
      and neurite outgrowth. These proteins interact with various cells and matrix
      components, modulating processes like synaptic plasticity, neuronal regeneration,
      and angiogenesis. They are implicated in the regulation of integrin-mediated
      cell adhesion, affecting phosphorylation and cell detachment. Additionally,
      they participate in the development and maintenance of the nervous system, including
      the clustering and regulation of sodium channels at nodes of Ranvier. Some family
      members are associated with tumor growth and metastasis, acting as ligands for
      multiple integrins and influencing cell migration and angiogenesis.
