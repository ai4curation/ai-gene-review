    name: Small Leucine-Rich Proteoglycans
    short: SLRP
  description:
  - text: The small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family is involved in various
      biological processes including collagen fiber assembly, cell adhesion, migration,
      and axon guidance. Members of this family play roles in maintaining tissue structure,
      such as anchoring basement membranes to connective tissue, affecting the rate
      of fibril formation, and regulating biomineralization. Some SLRPs are involved
      in modulating signaling pathways, such as TGF-beta and BMP signaling, which
      are critical for cartilage homeostasis and osteoarthritis pathogenesis. They
      also contribute to the organization of the extracellular matrix, particularly
      in the cornea, where they help maintain transparency and stromal matrix structure.
      Additionally, certain SLRPs participate in neuronal development, guiding neuron
      placement and synapse density regulation.
