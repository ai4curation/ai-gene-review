  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members with diverse roles in innate immunity,
      angiogenesis, metabolism, and cell adhesion. They are characterized by the presence
      of a fibrinogen C-terminal domain, which is implicated in various interactions
      such as binding to carbohydrates, cell surface receptors, or acetylated structures.
      Some family members function as lectins that recognize specific carbohydrate
      moieties, initiating complement activation or modulating cell adhesion. Others
      are involved in vascular development and stability, competing for receptor binding
      sites and influencing signaling pathways that regulate endothelial cell survival,
      proliferation, and migration. Additionally, certain proteins within this family
      can impact lipid metabolism by modulating the activity of enzymes like lipoprotein
      lipase, influencing triglyceride and cholesterol levels.
