  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases with a RING-CH-type
      zinc finger domain essential for their ligase activity. These enzymes facilitate
      the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to specific
      substrate proteins, thereby tagging them for various cellular processes. The
      ubiquitination can lead to different outcomes, including protein degradation,
      cellular signaling, and trafficking. Members of this family are involved in
      several cellular processes such as T-cell proliferation, lysosome homeostasis,
      and autophagy regulation. They are known to promote mixed polyubiquitination
      on certain targets, which can inhibit autophagy or regulate inflammatory responses
      by targeting components of the inflammasome for degradation.
