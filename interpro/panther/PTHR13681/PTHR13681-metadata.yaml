  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes scaffolding proteins that recognize and
      bind dimethylarginine-containing proteins, playing a role in the regulation
      of translation of target mRNAs. They are involved in the assembly of stress
      granules and act as coactivators in the nucleus by recognizing and binding asymmetric
      dimethylation on core histone tails, which are associated with transcriptional
      activation. Additionally, they are involved in spliceosome assembly, indicating
      a multifunctional role in RNA processing and gene expression regulation.
