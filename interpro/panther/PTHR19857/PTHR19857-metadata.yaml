  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in various cellular processes, including
      angiogenesis, cell migration, mitochondrial fission, and the regulation of proteasome
      assembly and activity. Some members act as adapter proteins that facilitate
      the formation of mitochondrial fission complexes, which are essential for the
      division of mitochondria. Other members play roles in inhibiting the assembly
      and proteolytic function of the 26S proteasome, impacting protein degradation
      pathways. Additionally, certain proteins within this family contribute to ribosome
      assembly, histone modification, and the establishment of heterochromatin, indicating
      a broad functional spectrum related to cell structure, division, and gene expression
      regulation.
