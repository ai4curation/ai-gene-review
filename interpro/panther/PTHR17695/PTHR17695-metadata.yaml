  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the early stages of ribosome assembly,
      particularly in the processing of pre-18S ribosomal RNA within the nucleolus.
      Members of this family are components of the small subunit (SSU) processome
      and associate with U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA). They contribute to the folding,
      modification, rearrangement, and cleavage of pre-rRNA, and are also implicated
      in the targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome. These activities
      are essential for the proper formation of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit.
