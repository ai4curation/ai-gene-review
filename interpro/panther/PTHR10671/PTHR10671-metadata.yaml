  description:
  - text: The PMP-22/EMP/MP20 family is involved in a variety of cellular processes
      including cell proliferation, cell-cell interactions, cell migration, and cell
      adhesion. Members of the family play crucial roles in the development and function
      of the nervous system, such as in myelinization and growth regulation. They
      are also key regulators of cell membrane composition, influencing protein surface
      expression and the formation of lipid rafts. Some family members are essential
      for immune responses, mediating cytotoxic degranulation of NK cells and CD8(+)
      T-cells, and activating CD4(+) T-cells. They contribute to cytolysis of target
      cells via the perforin/granzyme pathway and control cancer metastasis. Others
      are involved in lens development and cataractogenesis, acting as calmodulin
      receptors and contributing to junctional organization in lens fiber cells. The
      family also includes proteins that regulate angiogenesis and vasculogenesis,
      as well as embryonic development and cardiogenesis.
