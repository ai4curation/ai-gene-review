    short: T4SS_component
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes components of type IV secretion systems
      (T4SS), which are multiprotein complexes that translocate a wide range of substrates
      across cell membranes in bacteria. Members of this family are involved in various
      processes such as the secretion of toxins, the transfer of DNA, and the translocation
      of effector proteins into host cells. They play a role in bacterial conjugation,
      virulence, and adaptation to different environments by facilitating horizontal
      gene transfer. Some family members are ATPases, providing the energy required
      for the transport of substrates through the T4SS. They are also involved in
      the assembly and stabilization of the secretion system's structural components.
