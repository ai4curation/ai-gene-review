  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in intracellular trafficking, specifically
      in the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi
      apparatus and from the Golgi back to the ER. Members of this family form part
      of the coatomer complex, which is a cytosolic protein complex that binds to
      specific motifs on cargo proteins and vesicles. This complex is essential for
      the formation of non-clathrin-coated vesicles and is required for vesicle budding
      from the Golgi. The coatomer complex is also implicated in maintaining Golgi
      structural integrity and in the processing and recycling of certain receptors,
      such as the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. The recruitment of the coatomer
      to membranes is dependent on ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), which are small
      GTP-binding proteins.
