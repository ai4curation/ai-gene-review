  description:
  - text: The SH2 domain-containing protein family is characterized by the presence
      of an SH2 domain that plays a crucial role in signal transduction pathways.
      Members of this family are involved in various cellular processes, including
      tyrosine kinase signaling, T-cell activation and development, and the regulation
      of apoptosis. Some proteins within the family function as adapter molecules
      that modulate interactions between enzymes and receptors, such as the competition
      between PLCG and ESR1, influencing estrogen-induced cell proliferation. Others
      are implicated in the control of angiogenesis and may interact with kinases
      like ITK and TXK, linking them to T-cell activation machinery. The family also
      includes proteins that may affect mitochondrial stability and contribute to
      the apoptotic response.
