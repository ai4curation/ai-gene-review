  description:
  - text: The SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase-activating protein family is involved in neuronal
      morphogenesis, migration, and synapse maturation, particularly in the cerebral
      cortex. Members of the family act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for RAC1,
      CDC42, and potentially other small GTPases, influencing actin dynamics and cell
      migration. They play roles in regulating synapse density and maturation in cortical
      neurons, with some members also affecting cell migration in non-neuronal cells.
      The family includes a human-specific member that modifies cortical connectivity
      by inhibiting ancestral paralog functions, leading to increased synaptic density
      and maturation. Members share an F-BAR domain that mediates oligomerization,
      membrane binding, and induction of plasma membrane protrusions. Some members
      also interact with postsynaptic scaffolding proteins, contributing to synapse
      development. The family's activity is modulated by heterodimerization and proteasome-dependent
      degradation, influencing synaptic and cortical circuit connectivity.
