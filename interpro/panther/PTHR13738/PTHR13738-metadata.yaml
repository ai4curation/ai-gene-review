  description:
  - text: The Troponin I family consists of inhibitory subunits of the troponin complex,
      which is a critical component of the thin filament regulatory system in striated
      muscles. These proteins confer calcium-sensitivity to the actomyosin ATPase
      activity, which is essential for muscle contraction and relaxation. Members
      of this family are involved in the development and maintenance of muscle and
      the nervous system, and may also play a role in the cytoskeletal apparatus.
      The family includes isoforms specific to cardiac, fast skeletal, and slow skeletal
      muscles, reflecting their specialized roles in different muscle tissue types.
