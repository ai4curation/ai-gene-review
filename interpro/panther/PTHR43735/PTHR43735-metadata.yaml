  description:
  - text: The FAD-dependent oxidoreductase family comprises enzymes with diverse functions,
      including the inhibition of ferroptosis, a type of cell death driven by lipid
      peroxidation. Members of the family, such as Ferroptosis suppressor protein
      1 (FSP1), act as NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases that reduce coenzyme Q to
      ubiquinol, a radical-trapping antioxidant that prevents lipid oxidative damage.
      They also mediate vitamin K reduction in the vitamin K cycle, generating hydroquinones
      that inhibit phospholipid peroxidation. Some family members participate in biosynthetic
      pathways for secondary metabolites like siderophores and phenalenones, which
      are important for microbial virulence and survival. Others may have roles in
      mitochondrial stress signaling and apoptosis, as indicated by their translocation
      from mitochondria to the nucleus under oxidative stress, leading to DNA damage
      and cell death. The family's function is characterized by its involvement in
      redox reactions, cellular protection mechanisms, and the biosynthesis of bioactive
      compounds.
