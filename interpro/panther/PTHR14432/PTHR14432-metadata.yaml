    name: TBK1 and IKBKE adapter proteins
    short: TBK1-IKBKE_adapters
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes adapter molecules that play a crucial role
      in antiviral innate immunity. They are involved in the activation of serine/threonine-protein
      kinases TBK1 and IKBKE, which are key regulators of the immune response to viral
      infection. These proteins facilitate the oligomerization of TBK1 and enhance
      the phosphorylation of the NF-kappa-B p65 subunit RELA, leading to the activation
      of NF-kappa-B, a transcription factor important for the expression of immune
      response genes. Additionally, they are involved in the induction of interferon-beta
      (IFNB) promoter activation through the TICAM1 pathway and are essential for
      the induction of IRF-dependent transcription in response to viral infection.
