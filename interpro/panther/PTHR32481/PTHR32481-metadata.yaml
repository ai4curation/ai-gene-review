  description:
  - text: The peptidase M42 family comprises enzymes with aminopeptidase activity,
      which progressively cleave amino acids from the N-terminus of peptide substrates.
      Members of this family exhibit broad specificity, hydrolyzing di-, tri-, and
      tetrapeptides with various N-terminal amino acids, although some show preference
      for specific residues such as lysine or leucine. The activity of these enzymes
      is generally halted by the presence of a proline residue just before the cleavage
      site. They do not possess carboxypeptidase, endoproteolytic, or N-terminal deblocking
      activities. These enzymes are involved in protein degradation, processing oligopeptides
      into single amino acids. The peptidase M42 family plays a crucial role in cellular
      protein turnover and metabolism.
