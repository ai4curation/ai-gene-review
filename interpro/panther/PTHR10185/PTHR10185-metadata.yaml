  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes enzymes with diverse functions, such as
      hydrolyzing membrane phospholipids to generate signaling molecules, acting as
      5'-3' exonucleases involved in nucleic acid degradation and inflammatory response
      regulation, and participating in viral processes like envelope formation and
      cell-to-cell spread. Some members exhibit broad lipase activity, including phospholipase
      C, A, and triacylglycerol lipase activities. Others are involved in lysosomal
      homeostasis, endosomal protein sorting, and myotube formation. Additionally,
      certain viral proteins in this family contain late-budding domains that interact
      with the host's ESCRT machinery for viral particle budding.
