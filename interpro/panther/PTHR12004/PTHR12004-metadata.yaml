  description:
  - text: The protein family in question is involved in various reproductive and developmental
      processes in mammals. Members of the family function as hormones, such as relaxin,
      which works with estrogen to dilate the birth canal during childbirth, and may
      also play a role in the remodeling of connective tissues during pregnancy. This
      includes promoting the growth of pubic ligaments and the ripening of the cervix.
      Other members, like insulin-like peptide INSL6, are implicated in sperm development
      and fertilization. Additionally, some proteins within the family may be important
      in trophoblast development and bone formation regulation. All members share
      a structural similarity, belonging to the insulin family, which suggests a common
      evolutionary origin and potentially similar biochemical mechanisms.
