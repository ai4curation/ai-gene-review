  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes serine proteases that play a crucial role
      in maintaining genomic integrity. Members of this family are involved in the
      proteolytic cleavage of covalent DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) during DNA synthesis.
      These DPCs are highly toxic lesions that can interfere with replication and
      transcription. The proteins are known to bind single-stranded DNA and protect
      the replication fork from stalling by removing DPCs, such as those involving
      trapped topoisomerase 1 or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1-DNA complexes. Additionally,
      they are required for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) loading at replication
      sites and promote S-phase entry and DNA synthesis. Some family members also
      function as restriction factors for certain viruses and can affect nuclear barrier
      function by disrupting the nuclear pore complex through protease activity.
