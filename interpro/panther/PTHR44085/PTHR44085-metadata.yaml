  description:
  - text: The protein family includes enzymes that are involved in the biosynthesis
      and reduction of various biopterin derivatives and other organic compounds.
      Members of the family catalyze the final steps in the synthesis of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin,
      an essential cofactor for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. Some members also
      reduce benzil to (S)-benzoin, showing a broader substrate specificity. The family's
      activity can be regulated by various inhibitors, such as Cibacron blue 3 GA
      and N-acetylserotonin. The enzymes play a crucial role in maintaining cellular
      redox state and protecting against oxidative stress. They are characterized
      by their ability to preferentially produce certain stereoisomers of their products,
      which is important for the proper function of downstream metabolic pathways.
