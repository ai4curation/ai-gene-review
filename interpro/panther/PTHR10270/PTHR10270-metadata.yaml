  description:
  - text: The SRY-related protein family includes transcriptional regulators that
      play a crucial role in sex determination and differentiation. Members of this
      family, such as the Sex-determining region Y protein, are essential for male
      development, initiating the male sex determination process by influencing the
      development of supporting cell precursors as Sertoli cells. They are involved
      in various gene regulation aspects, including promoter activation or repression,
      and recognize specific DNA sequences to facilitate DNA bending. Additionally,
      they participate in pre-mRNA splicing and contribute to the maintenance of motor
      functions in dopaminergic neurons of the adult male brain. Some family members
      also have roles in embryonic development, organogenesis, and the differentiation
      of various cell types, including neuronal and endothelial cells.
