    name: Mitochondrial Processing Peptidase/Ubiquinol-cytochrome c Reductase Complex
    short: MPP/UQCRC_Complex
  description:
  - text: The Peptidase M16 family includes catalytic and regulatory subunits of the
      mitochondrial processing protease (MPP), which is essential for cleaving mitochondrial
      targeting sequences from newly imported proteins, typically after an arginine
      at position P2. Members of this family are also found as components of the ubiquinol-cytochrome
      c oxidoreductase complex, part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain,
      which is crucial for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis. The family
      includes proteins involved in electron transfer, proton translocation, and the
      Q cycle. Some members are implicated in the processing of the Rieske protein
      and its mitochondrial targeting sequence when incorporated into complex III.
      The family also contains zinc proteases with diverse functions, including virulence
      factors that compromise host cell functions and enzymes required for bacteriocin
      production.
