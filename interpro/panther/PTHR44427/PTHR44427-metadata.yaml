  description:
  - text: The CEA family proteins are predominantly involved in cell adhesion processes,
      with members functioning in homophilic and heterophilic interactions that are
      calcium-independent. They belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and play
      roles in various biological processes including immune response regulation,
      insulin action, angiogenesis, and tumor progression. Some members are implicated
      in maintaining the integrity of the tectorial membrane for proper hearing, while
      others are involved in phagocytosis, metabolic regulation, and the transport
      of bile acids. Additionally, certain proteins within the family are associated
      with pregnancy, such as the pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoproteins, which may
      have roles in immune modulation during gestation.
