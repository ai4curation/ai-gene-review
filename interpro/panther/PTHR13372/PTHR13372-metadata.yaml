  description:
  - text: The Geminin family proteins are involved in the regulation of DNA replication
      and cell cycle progression. Geminin inhibits DNA replication by preventing the
      MCM complex from incorporating into the pre-replication complex and is degraded
      during mitosis to allow replication in the next cell cycle. It also inhibits
      histone acetyltransferase activity and the transcriptional activity of certain
      Hox proteins. Multicilin, another member of the family, is a transcription regulator
      essential for multiciliate cell differentiation, activating genes for centriole
      biogenesis and motile cilia formation. It acts in a complex with E2F4 and E2F5,
      modulates GMNN activity, and promotes cell cycle exit. GEMC1, a related protein,
      promotes DNA replication initiation by mediating the recruitment of CDC45L onto
      replication origins in a TOPBP1- and CDK2-dependent manner.
