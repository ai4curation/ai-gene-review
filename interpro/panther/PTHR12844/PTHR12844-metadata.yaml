  description:
  - text: The CNKSR family proteins function as adapter or scaffold proteins involved
      in various signaling pathways. They enhance guanine-nucleotide exchange on ARF6,
      regulate Ras signaling, and are implicated in cell migration and transepithelial
      sodium transport. The family members coordinate the assembly of protein complexes,
      such as the ENaC-regulatory complex (ERC), and are involved in the regulation
      of cell surface expression of channels like ENaC. Their roles are essential
      in processes like HGF-dependent activation of Arf6 and aldosterone-induced sodium
      transport, contributing to cellular responses to external stimuli and intracellular
      signaling.
