  description:
  - text: The Major Facilitator Superfamily Sodium/Anion Cotransporter family is involved
      in the transport of various substrates across cellular membranes. Members of
      this family function as uniporters, symporters, and antiporters, often driven
      by electrochemical gradients. They play critical roles in transporting L-glutamate,
      phosphate, chloride, protons, potassium, sodium, and other anions. These transport
      activities are essential for processes such as synaptic transmission, cellular
      nutrient uptake, and ion homeostasis. Some members are involved in specialized
      functions like urate transport in the kidney, vesicular storage of neurotransmitters,
      and regulation of retinal vessel development. The activity of these transporters
      can be allosterically regulated by ions such as H+ and Cl-, and they are associated
      with various physiological functions in different tissues, including the nervous
      system, kidney, and chloroplasts in plants.
