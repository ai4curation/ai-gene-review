  description:
  - text: The RTT106/SSRP1 family includes histone chaperones and components of the
      FACT complex, which are involved in nucleosome formation, heterochromatin silencing,
      and transcriptional regulation. Members of this family are essential for depositing
      acetylated H3-H4 complexes onto newly-replicated DNA and play a role in the
      transcriptional regulation of cell-cycle dependent histone genes. The FACT complex
      members act to reorganize nucleosomes and are involved in processes requiring
      DNA templates, such as mRNA elongation, DNA replication, and DNA repair. They
      facilitate RNA polymerase II transcription by modulating nucleosomal structure,
      promoting the dissociation and reestablishment of histone H2A-H2B dimers. Some
      members also bind specifically to double-stranded DNA and may have additional
      roles in cell cycle progression, development, and response to DNA damage.
