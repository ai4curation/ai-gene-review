    name: Tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein
    short: TPR_domain_protein
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs,
      which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. These interactions
      are crucial for the assembly of multiprotein complexes. The TPR motif consists
      of 34 amino acids and forms a helix-turn-helix structure. Proteins in this family
      are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including the regulation of
      transcription, cell cycle control, and mitochondrial and peroxisomal functions.
      Due to the versatility of the TPR motif, members of this family may act as scaffolding
      proteins, adaptors, or regulators in different signaling pathways and cellular
      compartments.
