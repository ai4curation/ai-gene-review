    name: Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 18
    short: Rho_GEF18
  description:
  - text: The Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 18 family includes proteins that
      function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for RhoA and RAC1 GTPases.
      Members of this family are involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton,
      as their activation leads to the formation of actin stress fibers and induces
      changes in cell shape. Additionally, they are responsible for the production
      of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when acting as GEFs for RAC1. These proteins
      do not serve as GEFs for CDC42. The G protein beta-gamma subunits of heterotrimeric
      G proteins are known to activate these proteins, which contributes to the integrated
      cellular responses to LPA and other G-protein coupled receptor agonists. Moreover,
      they play a crucial role in the EPB41L4B-mediated regulation of the circumferential
      actomyosin belt within epithelial cells, highlighting their significance in
      maintaining cellular structure and signaling.
