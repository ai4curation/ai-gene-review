  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes receptor-like serine/threonine-protein
      kinases that play diverse roles in plant signaling and development. Members
      of this family are involved in the perception and transduction of peptide hormone
      signals that regulate root stem cell niche maintenance and transcription factor
      expression. They also have roles in floral induction, brassinosteroid perception
      in roots, sporogenesis, and anther development. These proteins typically contain
      leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and belong to the larger protein kinase superfamily,
      indicating a shared mechanism of action through phosphorylation of target proteins.
