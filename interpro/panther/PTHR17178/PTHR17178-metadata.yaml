  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the formation and function of secretory
      granules in various cell types. Members are essential for the storage of proteases
      in mast cells and for the storage of granzyme B in T-lymphocytes, which is crucial
      for cytotoxic cell granule-mediated apoptosis. They localize neutrophil elastase
      in neutrophil azurophil granules and are involved in the processing of MMP2.
      Additionally, these proteins play a regulatory role in the secretion of TNF-alpha
      and may influence the secretion of other proteases. They are also known to inhibit
      bone mineralization.
