  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the biogenesis of the large ribosomal
      subunit and initiation of translation. Members of this family form a complex
      with YAE1 or its homologs, functioning as a target-specific adapter that recruits
      apo-ribosomal-like proteins to the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA)
      machinery. This interaction is essential for the maturation of iron-sulfur clusters
      that are crucial for the functionality of ribosomal proteins and other iron-sulfur
      cluster-dependent enzymes. Additionally, these proteins may have a role in proline
      metabolism and the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, highlighting
      their potential involvement in cellular metabolic regulation and response to
      oxidative stress.
