  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in various cellular processes, including
      the regulation of the tubular endoplasmic reticulum network and intracellular
      calcium homeostasis. They play roles in the unfolded protein response signaling,
      angiogenesis, innate immune signaling, and lipid metabolism. Some family members
      are essential for the proper distribution and assembly of nuclear pores, while
      others contribute to cytokinesis by influencing the actomyosin ring assembly.
      They interact with various proteins such as RNF26 and RNF5, modulating processes
      like polyubiquitination and degradation of target proteins.
