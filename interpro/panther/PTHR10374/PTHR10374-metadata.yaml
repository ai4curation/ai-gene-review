  description:
  - text: This family of proteins catalyzes the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a
      byproduct of glycolysis, by converting hemimercaptal, formed from methylglyoxal
      and glutathione, into S-lactoylglutathione. This enzymatic activity is part
      of the glyoxalase system, which plays a crucial role in cellular protection
      against glycation stress. Some members of this family are also involved in the
      regulation of transcriptional activity of NF-kappa-B and are required for normal
      osteoclastogenesis. Additionally, certain proteins within this family can be
      regulated by the redox state of the cell, which affects their activity.
