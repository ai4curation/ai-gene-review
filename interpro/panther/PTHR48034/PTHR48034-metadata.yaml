  description:
  - text: The RNA-binding motif (RBM) protein family is involved in various aspects
      of RNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stabilization, and transcription
      regulation. Members of this family are characterized by their ability to bind
      RNA, often through RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and arginine/glycine-rich (RGG)
      domains. They play roles in tissue-specific gene expression, alternative splicing,
      and are implicated in processes such as tumor suppression, stress response,
      and embryonic development. Some family members are also involved in the regulation
      of exon inclusion or suppression, and may form part of larger complexes like
      the supraspliceosome that govern splice site selection. The family includes
      proteins that function in spermatogenesis and sex determination, as well as
      those that respond to temperature changes by modulating mRNA stability and translation.
