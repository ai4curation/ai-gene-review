  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that are implicated in the regulation
      of lipid metabolism. Some members are suggested to function as sterol isomerases,
      which may play a role in the conversion of sterols into more biologically active
      forms. Other members are involved in the regulation of liver fat metabolism,
      influencing triglyceride secretion and the content of hepatic lipid droplets.
      These functions suggest a role in the maintenance of lipid homeostasis and the
      regulation of lipid storage and mobilization.
