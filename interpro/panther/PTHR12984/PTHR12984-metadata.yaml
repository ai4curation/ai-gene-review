    name: Catalytically Inactive Kinase-Related Protein
    short: CIK-Related_Protein
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that are structurally related to
      the protein kinase superfamily but are predicted to be catalytically inactive.
      Despite the lack of detectable kinase activity, these proteins are implicated
      in various cellular processes. Some family members are involved in the regulation
      of COPI-mediated retrograde protein traffic between the Golgi apparatus and
      the endoplasmic reticulum, contributing to the maintenance of Golgi morphology.
      Others are components of the AP2-containing clathrin coat, playing a role in
      clathrin-dependent trafficking at the plasma membrane, trans-Golgi network,
      and endosomal system. These proteins are essential for cell growth, development,
      and specialized functions such as polarized root hair development in plants
      and neuronal function and signaling in animals. Additionally, certain isoforms
      may act as transcriptional activators, influencing gene expression.
