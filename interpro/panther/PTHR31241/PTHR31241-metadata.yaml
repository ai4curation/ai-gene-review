  description:
  - text: The AP2/ERF transcription factor family, specifically the ERF subfamily,
      consists of proteins that function as transcriptional activators. They bind
      to the dehydration-responsive element (DRE) with the DNA sequence 5'-[AG]CCGAC-3',
      which mediates transcription inducible by high salinity, dehydration, and abscisic
      acid. Members of the family are involved in various stress responses, including
      drought and heat-shock tolerance, and play roles in plant development and stress
      signal transduction pathways. Some members also interact with the GCC-box pathogenesis-related
      promoter element and are implicated in the regulation of gene expression by
      stress factors, including the ABA signaling pathway during seed germination
      and osmotic stress.
