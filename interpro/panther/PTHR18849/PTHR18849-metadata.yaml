  description:
  - text: The tilB family is involved in various cellular processes related to cilia
      and flagella. Members of this family play a crucial role in the assembly of
      dynein arms, which are essential for the motility of these organelles. They
      are important for the transport of outer dynein arm proteins from the cytoplasm
      to the cilia, impacting the formation and function of spermatozoal flagella
      and cilia in different tissues. Some family members are also involved in the
      regulation of cell morphology, cytoskeletal organization, and DNA damage repair.
      In developmental contexts, they contribute to the establishment of left-right
      body asymmetry and are required for proper development of renal structures.
      Additionally, they may participate in cell cycle regulation, basal body replication,
      and new flagellum biogenesis. The tilB family also includes proteins that are
      required for microtubule and spindle assembly, as well as the proper folding
      of alpha-tubulin.
