  description:
  - text: The SNF2/RAD54 helicase family is involved in ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling,
      regulating gene transcription, DNA replication, and repair. Members of this
      family bind and alter nucleosomal DNA, facilitating access to DNA during various
      DNA-templated processes. They are components of several multi-subunit complexes,
      such as the NuRD, ISWI, and SAGA complexes, which contribute to chromatin structure
      formation, transcriptional regulation, and histone modification. Some family
      members specifically recognize histone modifications, influencing gene expression
      and developmental processes. They also play roles in neuron differentiation,
      spermatogenesis, and maintaining pluripotency in stem cells.
