    name: Glyoxalase II family hydrolases
    short: Glyoxalase_II_hydrolases
  description:
  - text: The Glyoxalase II family consists of thiolesterase enzymes that catalyze
      the hydrolysis of S-D-lactoyl-glutathione to form glutathione and D-lactic acid.
      Members of this family are found in a variety of organisms, including mammals,
      birds, plants, and fungi. These enzymes play a crucial role in the detoxification
      of methylglyoxal, a byproduct of glycolysis, by converting it to less harmful
      substances. Some members within this family are also implicated in the development
      of cardiac hypertrophy via the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway. The family belongs
      to the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily, indicating a shared structural motif
      that coordinates metal ions to assist in catalysis.
