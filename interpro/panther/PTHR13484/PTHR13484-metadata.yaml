  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA 3'-end
      processing, a crucial step in mRNA maturation. Members of this family are key
      components of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex,
      which recognizes specific signal sequences in pre-mRNA and interacts with poly(A)
      polymerase and other factors to facilitate cleavage and the addition of a poly(A)
      tail. These proteins contribute to the recognition of polyadenylation sites
      and may enhance the polyadenylation process. They are known to bind to U-rich
      RNA sequence elements near the poly(A) site and may serve to anchor poly(A)
      polymerase to the CPSF complex, thereby influencing the efficiency and specificity
      of mRNA 3'-end formation.
