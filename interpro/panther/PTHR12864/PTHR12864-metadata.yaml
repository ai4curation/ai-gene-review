  description:
  - text: The protein family is involved in various cellular processes including ubiquitination,
      signaling pathways, and intracellular trafficking. Members act as core components
      of the CTLH E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, mediating ubiquitination and
      proteasomal degradation of specific target proteins such as HBP1. Some family
      members function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors for RAN GTPase, influencing
      microtubule dynamics and hemostasis. They also play roles in the Wnt signaling
      pathway by promoting beta-catenin nuclear accumulation. Additionally, they are
      implicated in the endosome-vacuole trafficking pathway, regulating nutrient
      transport and determining the fate of plasma membrane proteins. The family includes
      proteins with a SPRY domain that mediates interactions with various receptors
      and signaling molecules.
