  description:
  - text: The glycosyltransferase 48 family is involved in the synthesis of 1,3-beta-glucan
      and callose, which are major structural components of fungal cell walls and
      plant cells, respectively. In fungi, members of this family function as catalytic
      subunits of the 1,3-beta-glucan synthase complex, playing a key role in cell
      wall synthesis, maintenance, and remodeling. In plants, these enzymes are crucial
      for callose deposition during various developmental processes, including cytokinesis,
      pollen formation, and response to wounding and pathogen attack. They contribute
      to the formation of cell plates, pollen mother cell walls, pollen tubes, and
      plasmodesmatal canals. Some family members are regulated by ions or protein
      interactions, indicating a complex control of their activity.
