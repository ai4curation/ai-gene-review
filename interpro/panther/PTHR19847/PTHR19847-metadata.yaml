  description:
  - text: This family of proteins appears to be involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis,
      acting as potential substrate receptors for the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin-protein
      ligase complex. Some members are implicated in the regulation of lifespan and
      neuronal degeneration in response to metal stress. They may also interact with
      the transcription factor SKN-1 to modulate gene expression.
