    name: Iron-sulfur cluster insertion protein ErpA
    short: Fe-S_cluster_insert_ErpA
  description:
  - text: The HesB/IscA family is involved in the biogenesis and repair of iron-sulfur
      (Fe-S) clusters, which are critical for various cellular processes. Members
      of this family are essential for the insertion of 4Fe-4S clusters into apoproteins,
      including IspG and potentially IspH, which are involved in quinone biosynthesis
      and other cellular components. The proteins may bind Fe-S cluster intermediates
      during assembly, facilitating their transfer to recipient apoproteins. This
      function is crucial for cellular respiration and various metabolic pathways,
      highlighting the family's role in maintaining essential biochemical functions
      across diverse organisms.
