    name: ASTRA and SSU processome component protein
    short: ASTRA/SSU_processome
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in various cellular processes including
      chromatin remodeling, ribosome biogenesis, and cell division regulation. Members
      of this family are components of complexes such as the ASTRA complex, which
      plays a role in chromatin structure modification, and the SSU processome, which
      is essential for the maturation of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. Some
      proteins in this family are also involved in the regulation of cell-to-cell
      transport and cell cycle checkpoints in response to DNA damage. Additionally,
      they participate in the response to environmental stress, such as aluminum toxicity,
      and are essential for developmental processes in both plants and animals.
