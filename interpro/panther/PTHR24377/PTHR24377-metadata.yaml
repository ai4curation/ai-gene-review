  description:
  - text: The Krueppel C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family is characterized by its
      involvement in transcriptional regulation. Members of this family typically
      contain C2H2-type zinc-finger domains, which are known for their role in DNA
      binding and gene expression modulation. Some proteins within the family may
      function as transcriptional repressors, potentially suppressing transcriptional
      activities mediated by specific signaling pathways, such as the MAPK pathway.
      Others may act as transcriptional activators, directly influencing the expression
      of genes like NPPA. Certain members are implicated in cellular processes like
      apoptosis, and may interact with proteins such as p53/TP53, BAX, and TRAF2 to
      mediate cell death pathways in response to DNA damage. Domains like the KRAB
      and SCAN domains contribute to the transcriptional repressor activity and enable
      dimerization, respectively, which further diversifies the regulatory roles of
      the family in gene expression.
