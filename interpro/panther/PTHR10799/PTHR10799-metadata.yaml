  description:
  - text: The SNF2/RAD54 helicase family is involved in various chromatin remodeling
      processes, including transcription regulation, DNA repair, heterochromatin organization,
      and nucleosome positioning. Members of this family possess ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodeling
      activity, which is crucial for altering DNA-histone contacts within nucleosomes,
      leading to changes in chromatin structure that can either facilitate or repress
      gene expression. These helicases are also involved in the maintenance of genomic
      integrity, particularly in the response to DNA damage where they promote DNA
      end resection of double-strand breaks. Additionally, they play roles in the
      maintenance of heterochromatin organization, influencing gene silencing and
      epigenetic regulation.
