  description:
  - text: The gastrokine family comprises proteins involved in the maintenance and
      integrity of the gastric mucosal epithelium. Members of this family exhibit
      mitogenic activity, suggesting a role in cell proliferation and tissue regeneration.
      Some gastrokines are also implicated in inhibiting gastric epithelial cell proliferation,
      indicating a potential regulatory function in gastric tissue homeostasis. The
      dual functions of gastrokines reflect their importance in balancing cell growth
      and maintaining the structure of the stomach lining, which is essential for
      proper digestive function.
