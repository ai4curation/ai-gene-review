  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes molecular chaperones that are involved
      in the folding of unfolded proteins. They interact with HSP70 heat shock proteins,
      stimulating ATP hydrolysis and assisting in the proper folding of non-native
      proteins. Some members are implicated in the regulation of heat shock-induced
      transcriptional activity, while others are essential for cellular processes
      such as nuclear migration during mitosis and the initiation of translation.
      Additionally, certain members function within axonemal radial spoke complexes,
      contributing to the motility of sperm and cilia.
