  description:
  - text: The T cell receptor (TCR) variable domain family is involved in antigen
      recognition and the immune response. TCRs are present on T lymphocytes' surfaces
      and recognize peptide-major histocompatibility complexes displayed by antigen-presenting
      cells, initiating an immune response. The variable domain of the alpha or delta
      chain participates in antigen binding, leading to the activation of signaling
      pathways essential for T cell growth, differentiation, and the adaptive immune
      response. The TCR repertoire is generated through V-(D)-J rearrangement and
      shaped by selection events to create a pool of self-restricted, non-autoaggressive
      T cells.
