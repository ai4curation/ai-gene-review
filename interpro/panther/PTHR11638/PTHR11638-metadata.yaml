  description:
  - text: The ClpA/ClpB family proteins are molecular chaperones and ATP-dependent
      proteases that play crucial roles in stress responses, particularly in the recovery
      of cells from heat-induced damage. They are involved in the disaggregation,
      solubilization, and refolding of denatured protein aggregates, acting in cooperation
      with other chaperones such as DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE. The ClpB chaperones have
      ATPase activity, which is stimulated by protein binding; the subsequent ATP
      hydrolysis unfolds the denatured protein aggregates. This unfolding exposes
      new hydrophobic binding sites on the surface of ClpB-bound aggregates, aiding
      in their solubilization and refolding by DnaK. The ClpA/ClpB family proteins
      contain nucleotide-binding domains responsible for ATP hydrolysis and oligomerization,
      and a coiled-coil domain essential for the rescue of proteins from an aggregated
      state. Some family members are also involved in the degradation of proteins
      by proteases like ClpP, regulation of genetic competence, and mitochondrial-mediated
      antiviral innate immunity.
