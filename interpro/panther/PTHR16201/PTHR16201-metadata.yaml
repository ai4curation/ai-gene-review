    name: Lysosomal/Vacuolar Amino Acid Transporter 1
    short: LAAT-1
  description:
  - text: The LAAT-1 family comprises lysosomal and vacuolar amino acid transporters
      that are specialized in the pH-dependent export of cationic amino acids such
      as arginine, histidine, and lysine. These transporters play a crucial role in
      maintaining amino acid homeostasis within the cell by mediating the efflux of
      these amino acids from lysosomal or vacuolar compartments. The function of the
      LAAT-1 family is essential for optimal growth in various organisms and may be
      involved in the degradation of autophagic substrates within autolysosomes, thus
      regulating lysosome function. Members of the LAAT-1 family are characterized
      by a di-leucine motif, which is critical for their lysosomal localization.
