  description:
  - text: The PAN1/END3 family is involved in the actin-coupled endocytosis process.
      Members of this family are components of the PAN1 actin cytoskeleton-regulatory
      complex, which is essential for the internalization of endosomes. This complex
      facilitates the linkage between the site of endocytosis and the cell membrane-associated
      actin cytoskeleton. It plays a crucial role in the uptake of external molecules
      and the vacuolar degradation of plasma membrane proteins. Additionally, the
      PAN1/END3 family contributes to the proper organization and destabilization
      of the cell membrane-associated actin cytoskeleton, which is vital for cellular
      membrane dynamics and the recycling of membrane-bound receptors.
