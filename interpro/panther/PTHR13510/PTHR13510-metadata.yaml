  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes effectors of Rab GTPases, specifically
      Rab4 and Rab5, involved in early endocytic membrane fusion and trafficking.
      Members of this family are essential for the fusion of endosomes and for the
      transport of recycling endosomes. They facilitate lysosomal trafficking of enzymes
      such as cathepsin D and are implicated in the recycling of membrane receptors
      like the transferrin receptor from endosomes back to the plasma membrane. These
      proteins have the ability to bind to phospholipid vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol
      3-phosphate, indicating a role in phosphoinositide-mediated signaling pathways.
      Additionally, they may be involved in vacuole segregation and protein sorting
      in yeast, suggesting a broader function in interorganelle traffic across different
      species.
