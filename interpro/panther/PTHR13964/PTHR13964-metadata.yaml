  description:
  - text: The ARID/SWI1 protein family includes transcriptional regulators with diverse
      roles in gene expression, chromatin remodeling, and developmental processes.
      Members of the family bind to AT-rich DNA regions and can act as transcription
      coactivators or repressors. They are involved in adipogenesis, liver development,
      spermatogenesis, myeloid homeostasis, and may also regulate smooth muscle cell
      differentiation and proliferation. Some family members form complexes with other
      proteins, such as the mSin3A corepressor complex, to modulate transcription
      factor activity and histone modifications. They also play roles in epigenetic
      regulation at imprinting centers and in the stabilization of inflammation-related
      mRNAs. The SWI/SNF subunits within the family are part of an ATP-dependent chromatin
      remodeling complex that alters nucleosome position to regulate gene expression.
