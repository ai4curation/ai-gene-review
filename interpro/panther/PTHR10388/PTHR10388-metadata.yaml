    name: Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor SUI1
    short: eIF_SUI1
  description:
  - text: The SUI1 family proteins are involved in the initiation of eukaryotic translation.
      They are key components of the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) and play a crucial
      role in the recognition of the start codon during mRNA scanning. Family members
      facilitate the correct positioning of the mRNA and initiator tRNA within the
      ribosome, regulate the mRNA binding channel's opening and closing, and ensure
      the fidelity of start codon selection. They interact with other initiation factors
      to form complexes that promote ribosomal scanning and prevent premature base-pairing
      in the mRNA's untranslated region. Some SUI1 homologs function alongside eIF-2
      and initiator tRNA to direct the ribosome to the proper translation start site.
