  description:
  - text: The ATF bZIP family is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR),
      a cellular stress response related to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Family
      members act as transcription factors that bind to ER stress response elements
      (ERSE) to activate UPR target genes during ER stress. They are synthesized as
      precursors embedded in the ER membrane and are processed upon ER stress, releasing
      their transcription factor form to translocate into the nucleus. The basic leucine-zipper
      domain is crucial for DNA binding and nuclear localization. Members of the family
      may also play roles in development, cone function in the retina, lifespan modulation,
      ER calcium homeostasis, and protection against proteotoxicity.
