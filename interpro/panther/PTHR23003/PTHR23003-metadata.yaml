  description:
  - text: The RRT5/SRSF/Splicing Factor SR family is involved in various aspects of
      RNA processing, including pre-mRNA splicing, rDNA transcription modulation,
      and mRNA export. Members of this family play roles in constitutive and alternative
      splicing, ensuring the accuracy of splicing and regulating splice site selection.
      Some proteins within this family are implicated in cell cycle progression, spermatogenesis,
      and response to oxidative stress. Others are involved in ribosome assembly and
      pre-rRNA processing, contributing to the maintenance of ribosomal subunit levels.
      The family includes proteins with RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and serine/arginine-rich
      (SR) domains, which are characteristic of splicing factors and are essential
      for spliceosome assembly and function. The family's diverse functions reflect
      its members' involvement in critical cellular processes, including gene expression
      regulation, development, and response to cellular stress.
