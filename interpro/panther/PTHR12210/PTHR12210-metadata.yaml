    name: Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit TIM50
    short: TIM50
  description:
  - text: The TIM50 family proteins are essential components of the TIM23 complex,
      which mediates the translocation of transit peptide-containing proteins across
      the mitochondrial inner membrane. These proteins are required to direct preproteins
      in transit to the channel protein TIM23 and may facilitate the transfer of translocating
      proteins from the TOM complex to the TIM23 complex. Although some members have
      phosphatase activity in vitro, this activity may not be relevant in vivo. The
      TIM50 family plays a dynamic role in protein import and does not act as a structural
      subunit of the TIM23 complex.
