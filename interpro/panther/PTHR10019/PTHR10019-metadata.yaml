    name: SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin
      subfamily B
    short: SWI/SNF_related_regulator
  description:
  - text: The SNF5 family proteins are core components of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling
      complexes, such as BAF (SWI/SNF) and RSC, which are essential for a wide range
      of cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, neural
      development, and transcription regulation. They facilitate the alteration of
      chromatin structure by changing DNA-histone contacts within nucleosomes, leading
      to changes in nucleosome position. This remodeling is crucial for the regulation
      of gene expression and is involved in cellular responses to DNA damage, cytoskeletal
      organization, and cell cycle progression. The family is also implicated in the
      transition of neural progenitors to postmitotic neurons, with a switch in complex
      subunit composition being essential for dendrite growth and neural stem cell
      self-renewal.
