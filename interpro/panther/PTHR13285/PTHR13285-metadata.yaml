    short: MB_O-acyltransferase
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes membrane-bound O-acyltransferases that
      are involved in various lipid modification processes. Members of this family
      are responsible for the acylation of proteins and lipids, which is crucial for
      their function and localization. Some proteins in this family catalyze the remodeling
      of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors on GPI-anchored proteins, influencing
      cell integrity and apoptosis. Others are involved in the acetylation of alginate,
      affecting biofilm architecture and resistance to environmental stressors. Additionally,
      certain family members are implicated in the D-alanylation of teichoic acids
      in bacterial cell walls, contributing to cell wall charge and resistance to
      lysozyme. The family also includes enzymes that catalyze the N-terminal palmitoylation
      of signaling molecules such as Hedgehog proteins, which is essential for proper
      signaling and development. Overall, these enzymes play significant roles in
      cell signaling, structural integrity, and host-pathogen interactions.
