    name: Xyloglucan-specific glycosyl hydrolase
    short: Xyloglucanase_GH74
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes enzymes that primarily act on xyloglucan,
      a plant cell wall polysaccharide. Members of this family exhibit xyloglucanase
      activity, hydrolyzing the glucosidic bonds of unbranched glucose residues within
      xyloglucan to produce specific oligosaccharides. Some members are described
      as having oligoxyloglucan-reducing end-specific activity, cleaving the first
      two glycosyl segments from oligoxyloglucans. The enzymes show activity against
      substrates such as tamarind seed xyloglucan and cotton xyloglucan. They may
      have dual endo- and exo- modes of action or an endo-processive mode of action.
      The activity profile includes the production of oligosaccharides like XXXG,
      XLXG, XXLG, and XLLG, with varying activities on other polysaccharides. The
      family belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 74 group, which is characterized by
      its specificity and mode of action towards xyloglucan-related substrates.
