    name: Actomyosin Interaction Regulator
    short: Actomyosin-Regulator
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that are involved in the regulation
      of actomyosin interactions in both smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells. They may
      act as a bridge between myosin and actin filaments, influencing the stability
      of actin filament structure and modulating the actomyosin ATPase activity. The
      regulatory function is modulated by interactions with calcium-calmodulin and
      tropomyosin. Some family members are also implicated in cellular processes such
      as mitosis and receptor capping, as well as playing roles in cell migration
      during tissue regeneration. Additionally, other members of this family are involved
      in the invasion of host cells by parasites, specifically in the binding to host
      cell surface proteins to facilitate entry.
