  description:
  - text: The NDUFS6 subunit family comprises accessory subunits of the mitochondrial
      membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase, also known as Complex I. Members
      of this family are not directly involved in the catalytic activity of Complex
      I. Their primary role is to assist in the transfer of electrons from NADH to
      the respiratory chain, with ubiquinone serving as the immediate electron acceptor.
      The NDUFS6 subunit family is essential for the proper assembly and function
      of Complex I, which is a critical enzyme in the mitochondrial energy metabolism
      process.
