  description:
  - text: This family of proteins participates in a complex that severs microtubules
      in an ATP-dependent manner, which may facilitate rapid reorganization of cellular
      microtubule arrays. Members of this family are involved in targeting the enzymatic
      subunit of the complex to specific sites, such as the centrosome or microtubule
      cleavage sites, which is essential for processes like cell elongation, chromosome
      motion during mitosis, and axonal growth. Some members may also interact with
      cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes, influencing protein degradation pathways.
      Additionally, these proteins may play a role in regulating responses to abscisic
      acid in plants.
