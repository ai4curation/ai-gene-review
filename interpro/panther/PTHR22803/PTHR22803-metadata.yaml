    short: C-type_lectin/snaclec_domain
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes C-type lectins and snaclecs, which are
      known for their carbohydrate recognition domains. They are involved in a variety
      of biological processes, including cell-cell adhesion, immune response, and
      pathogen recognition. Members of this family can bind to specific carbohydrate
      structures on cell surfaces, leading to cell agglutination or modulation of
      signaling pathways. Some proteins in this family are involved in hemostasis,
      interfering with platelet aggregation or the coagulation cascade. They may act
      as anticoagulants by binding to coagulation factors or platelet receptors, or
      as procoagulants by inducing platelet aggregation. The functions of these proteins
      are often calcium-dependent and can be influenced by the presence of specific
      sugars or metal ions.
