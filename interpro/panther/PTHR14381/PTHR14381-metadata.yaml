    name: SCF Complex F-box/Wd Repeat-Containing Protein
    short: SCF_F-box/WD-repeat
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes components of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box
      protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which are involved in the recognition
      and binding of specific substrate proteins, often following phosphorylation.
      These proteins facilitate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation
      of their target proteins, thereby regulating protein turnover and contributing
      to the control of various cellular processes. Some family members are implicated
      in critical signaling pathways, such as those governing limb development and
      possibly Wnt signaling, highlighting their role in developmental and cell signaling
      pathways.
