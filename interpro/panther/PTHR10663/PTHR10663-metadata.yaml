  description:
  - text: The ARF GEFs protein family is involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking
      by activating ARF proteins through guanine-nucleotide exchange, replacing GDP
      with GTP. Members of this family play crucial roles in various cellular processes,
      including membrane trafficking, organelle integrity, cell polarity, and cytoskeletal
      remodeling. They are also implicated in developmental processes such as embryogenesis
      and neurite growth. The family includes proteins that are inhibited by brefeldin
      A and are associated with the Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and plasma membrane.
      Some members are involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and
      function, as well as in immune responses and glucose homeostasis regulation.
