  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes components involved in various cellular
      processes such as ubiquitination, cell cycle regulation, mitochondrial fission,
      and ciliogenesis. Members act as substrate recognition components of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box
      protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes, mediating ubiquitination and
      proteasomal degradation of target proteins, often requiring substrate phosphorylation.
      They play roles in signaling pathways like Wnt and NF-kappa-B, influencing development
      and immune responses. Some members are involved in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly
      in the fission process. Others contribute to microtubule function, nuclear distribution,
      and ciliary movement. The family also includes proteins that regulate deubiquitinating
      complexes and transcriptional repression.
