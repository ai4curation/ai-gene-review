    name: Ribonuclease Y family endoribonucleases
    short: RNase_Y
  description:
  - text: The RNase Y family proteins are endoribonucleases that initiate mRNA decay.
      They play a crucial role in mRNA processing and regulation, impacting gene expression
      by catalyzing the hydrolysis of mRNA. This function is essential for maintaining
      proper cellular mRNA levels and ensuring the timely removal of defective or
      unnecessary mRNA molecules. RNase Y family members are characterized by their
      ability to cleave RNA substrates, contributing to various aspects of RNA metabolism
      and function. They are involved in the activation of certain operons, such as
      sarZ and agr, leading to the expression of virulence genes in some species.
      Additionally, they have been implicated in the decay of riboswitches and the
      processing of operon mRNAs. The RNase Y family proteins are also associated
      with the regulation of toxin-antitoxin system RNAs, playing a role in bacterial
      stress response and survival.
