  description:
  - text: The AN1/A20 zinc finger protein family is characterized by the presence
      of AN1-type and A20-type zinc finger domains, which are implicated in a variety
      of cellular processes. Members of this family are involved in the regulation
      of NF-kappa-B activity, apoptosis, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. They
      play roles in environmental stress response, protein import into peroxisomes,
      and the stability of PEX5. Some family members are also associated with TRAF2
      and are involved in modulating 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination status. Additionally,
      they may act in anchoring ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome and in inhibiting
      osteoclast differentiation. The family's functions are crucial in cellular responses
      to stress, inflammation, and protein homeostasis.
