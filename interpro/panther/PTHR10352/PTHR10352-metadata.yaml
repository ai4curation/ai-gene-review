  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism,
      including the regulation of alternative pre-RNA splicing, mRNA translation,
      and stability. Members of this family typically contain RNA recognition motif
      (RRM) domains that mediate binding to uridine-rich sequences in RNA, influencing
      splicing and localization to stress granules. They are also implicated in the
      cellular response to stress by participating in the formation of cytoplasmic
      stress granules, which leads to translational arrest. Additionally, some family
      members play roles in the initiation of protein synthesis by forming part of
      the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, targeting specific
      mRNAs for translation. The proteins may also have functions in neuronal development
      and maintenance, as well as in the regulation of cell proliferation.
