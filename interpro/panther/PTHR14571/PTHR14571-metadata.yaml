  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members with a PHD-type zinc-finger domain
      that is implicated in the negative regulation of autophagy, often through interactions
      with other proteins such as LRSAM1. Some family members are involved in modulating
      chromatin structure and the DNA damage response by binding to specific methylated
      histone marks and recruiting corepressors, which influences chromatin compaction
      and gene expression. Additionally, certain proteins within this family function
      as histone methyltransferases, contributing to the regulation of lifespan, germline
      development, and maintenance by controlling histone methylation patterns.
