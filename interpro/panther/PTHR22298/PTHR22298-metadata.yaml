    name: Glycosyl hydrolase 9 / Cellulase E
    short: Glycosyl_hydrlase9/CellulaseE
  description:
  - text: The glycosyl hydrolase 9 family, also known as cellulase E, encompasses
      enzymes that play a crucial role in the hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-glucosidic linkages
      in cellulose, lichenin, and cereal beta-D-glucans. Members of this family are
      involved in various biological processes, including the ripening of fruit, cell
      wall assembly during cell elongation, secondary cell wall formation in developing
      xylem, and possibly in the sloughing of root cap cells. These enzymes exhibit
      broad substrate specificity and are essential for the degradation of cellulose,
      a key structural component of plant cell walls. They act synergistically in
      the biological conversion of cellulose to glucose, which requires endoglucanases
      to cut internal bonds, exocellobiohydrolases to trim cellobiose from the non-reducing
      end, and beta-1,4-glucosidases to hydrolyze cellobiose into glucose. Some family
      members are also involved in lateral root development and may participate in
      the digestion of the spore cell wall during germination.
