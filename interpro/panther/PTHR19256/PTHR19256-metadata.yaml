  description:
  - text: The T cell receptor gamma (TRG) family includes proteins involved in antigen
      recognition and the initiation of innate-like immune responses. TRG proteins
      are expressed on the surface of T cells, particularly gamma-delta T cells, which
      recognize self and foreign non-peptide antigens at epithelial boundaries. Antigen
      binding to TRG leads to phosphorylation of CD3 ITAMs, recruitment and activation
      of ZAP70, and subsequent signal transduction involving LCP2, LAT, and PLCG1.
      This cascade results in calcium mobilization, ERK activation, T cell proliferation,
      and differentiation. TRG diversity arises from somatic rearrangement of V, D,
      and J genes, with additional diversity from exonuclease trimming and random
      nucleotide additions during rearrangement. Some TRG members are non-functional
      due to altered recombination, splicing, or conserved amino acid changes.
