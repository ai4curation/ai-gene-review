  description:
  - text: The FGGY kinase family is a group of enzymes that play a crucial role in
      the metabolism of various sugars by catalyzing the phosphorylation of substrates
      such as glycerol, xylulose, and L-rhamnulose, yielding their respective phosphate
      derivatives. These kinases are involved in essential metabolic pathways, including
      glycerolipid and triglyceride synthesis, glycogenesis, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis.
      They are also implicated in the catabolism of L-rhamnose, a component of bacterial
      cell walls, and in the metabolism of rare sugars. The activity of these kinases
      is regulated by various metabolites, including fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, which
      allosterically inhibits the enzyme, and the phosphorylation state of the enzyme
      itself. Some family members are also affected by the bacterial phosphotransferase
      system component EIIA-Glc.
