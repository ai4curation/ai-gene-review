  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in cellular stress responses and protein
      homeostasis. Members of this family play roles in the regulation of stress granules
      (SGs) turnover, particularly in the clearance of SGs under specific stress conditions
      such as arsenite exposure. They are implicated in the recruitment of the ubiquitin-selective
      ATPase VCP and the 26S proteasome to facilitate the degradation of damaged ubiquitinated
      proteins within SGs. Additionally, some family members are associated with the
      endoplasmic reticulum, where they regulate the translocation and ubiquitin-mediated
      proteasomal degradation of nascent proteins. They may function in a pre-emptive
      quality control mechanism that reroutes mislocalized proteins from the endoplasmic
      reticulum to the cytosol for degradation, thereby maintaining cellular protein
      homeostasis and indirectly influencing signaling pathways such as the insulin-like
      growth factor receptor pathway.
