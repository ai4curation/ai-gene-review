  description:
  - text: The DNA Ligase/TOPBP1 family is involved in crucial cellular processes of
      DNA replication and repair. DNA ligases catalyze the formation of phosphodiester
      bonds in double-stranded DNA using NAD as a coenzyme, essential for DNA replication
      and repair. TOPBP1 and its variants are scaffold proteins with multiple BRCT
      domains that recognize and bind phosphorylated proteins, facilitating the assembly
      of protein complexes necessary for DNA replication initiation and repair. They
      play a central role in homologous recombination and microhomology-mediated end-joining
      for double-strand break repair, and are involved in checkpoint control, stabilizing
      chromosomes during mitosis, and regulating E2F1 activity to prevent apoptosis.
