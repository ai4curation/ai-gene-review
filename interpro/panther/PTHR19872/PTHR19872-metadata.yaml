    short: SCF_subunit_WD-repeat
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes components of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein)
      E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which are involved in the ubiquitination and
      subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Members of this family
      are implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of sulfur
      metabolite repression by mediating the inactivation or degradation of specific
      transcription factors such as metR. They also play roles in cell cycle progression,
      sulfur metabolism, methionine biosynthesis, and the cellular response to cadmium.
      Some family members are involved in the regulation of autophagy by targeting
      ATG9 for degradation under normal conditions.
