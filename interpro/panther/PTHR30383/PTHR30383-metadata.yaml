  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes enzymes with diverse ester hydrolysis capabilities.
      Members of this family are involved in the degradation of various substrates,
      including plant biomass components such as cellulose and xylan, as well as synthetic
      esters and triglycerides. Some proteins exhibit multifunctional esterase activities,
      acting as thioesterases, arylesterases, lysophospholipases, and proteases. They
      are characterized by their ability to cleave ester bonds, with some showing
      specificity for short-chain fatty acyl esters, and others for aromatic esters
      or acetyl groups on polysaccharides. The family includes enzymes that play roles
      in processes such as spore germination and intracellular survival. The presence
      of a dockerin-like region in one member suggests a potential role in multienzyme
      complexes for efficient substrate degradation.
