  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the process of ciliogenesis, which
      is the formation of cilia on the cell surface. These proteins also play a crucial
      role in maintaining the structural integrity at the ciliary tip, which is essential
      for the proper function of cilia. Cilia are hair-like structures that extend
      from the surface of many eukaryotic cells and are involved in various functions,
      including motility, sensory perception, and signal transduction.
