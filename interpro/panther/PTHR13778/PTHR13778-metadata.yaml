  description:
  - text: The Glycosyltransferase 8 family comprises enzymes involved in the biosynthesis
      of various polysaccharides and glycoconjugates. Members of this family are known
      to participate in the synthesis of cell wall components, such as pectin and
      xylans in plants, and the core oligosaccharide region of lipopolysaccharides
      in bacteria. They exhibit glucosyltransferase and galactosyltransferase activities,
      transferring sugar moieties from activated sugar donors like UDP-glucose or
      UDP-galactose to specific acceptor molecules. Some members are also implicated
      in the O-glycosylation of serine-rich repeat proteins, contributing to the diversity
      of bacterial cell surface structures. The family is characterized by the presence
      of conserved DXD motifs, which are crucial for their catalytic function. These
      enzymes play essential roles in cell wall integrity, pathogenicity, and stress
      response across various species.
