  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that are characterized by the presence
      of transmembrane regions and coiled-coil domains. These structural features
      suggest a role in intracellular processes, possibly involving membrane dynamics
      or protein-protein interactions. The exact biological functions of this family
      may vary among different organisms and could be involved in diverse cellular
      pathways. Further research is necessary to elucidate the specific roles and
      mechanisms by which these proteins operate within the cell.
