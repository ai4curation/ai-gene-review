  name:
    name: Zinc finger and G patch domain-containing protein
    short: ZnF-G_patch_domain
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members with zinc finger domains, which
      are typically involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The presence
      of G patch domains suggests a role in RNA processing or repair mechanisms. These
      domains are known to mediate protein-RNA interactions, which are crucial in
      various cellular processes including splicing, transcription, and translation.
      The proteins in this family are likely to have diverse functions related to
      gene expression regulation and RNA metabolism, reflecting the multifunctional
      nature of zinc finger and G patch domain-containing proteins.
