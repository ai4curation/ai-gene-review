    name: Voltage-dependent calcium channel beta subunit
    short: VDCC_beta_subunit
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes regulatory subunits of voltage-dependent
      L-type calcium channels. They play a crucial role in modulating the function
      of these channels by increasing peak calcium current and altering the voltage
      dependencies of channel activation and inactivation. Members of this family
      are also involved in the membrane targeting of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel
      complex. Additionally, they may influence G protein inhibition and contribute
      to beta-adrenergic augmentation of calcium influx, which is important for regulating
      heart rate and contractile force in cardiomyocytes.
