  description:
  - text: The CheA protein family is central to bacterial chemotaxis, a process where
      bacteria navigate their environment by moving towards favorable chemical stimuli
      and away from harmful ones. Members of the CheA family function as sensor histidine
      kinases that autophosphorylate in response to signals from chemoreceptors. Once
      phosphorylated, CheA proteins can transfer the phosphate group to response regulators
      such as CheB and CheY, which modulate the activity of flagellar motors, altering
      the swimming behavior of the cell. Some family members also respond to phototactic
      signals and may interact with additional proteins like CheV. The domains within
      these proteins facilitate interaction with response regulators, regulate phosphorylation,
      and receive sensory input to control activity.
