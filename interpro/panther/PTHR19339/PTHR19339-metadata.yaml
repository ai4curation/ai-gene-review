    name: T cell receptor alpha variable region
    short: TCR_alpha_variable
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes variable regions of the alpha chain of
      T cell receptors (TRs), which are crucial for antigen recognition. These proteins
      are part of the alpha-beta TRs, which are antigen-specific and essential for
      the immune response. They are present on T lymphocytes and recognize peptide-major
      histocompatibility complex (pMH) complexes displayed by antigen-presenting cells
      (APCs). The interaction between TRs and pMH complexes triggers a cascade of
      intracellular events, starting with the activation of LCK kinase and subsequent
      phosphorylation of ITAM motifs on CD3 and CD247. This leads to the recruitment
      and activation of ZAP70, which then phosphorylates LAT to form the LAT signalosome.
      The signalosome coordinates downstream signaling pathways, including calcium,
      MAPK kinase, and NF-kB pathways, culminating in the activation of transcription
      factors vital for T cell proliferation, gene expression, and differentiation.
      The T cell repertoire is generated through V-(D)-J rearrangement in the thymus
      and is further refined to ensure self-tolerance and proper immune function.
