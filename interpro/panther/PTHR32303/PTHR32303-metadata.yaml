  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes various dehydrogenases that utilize pyrroloquinoline
      quinone (PQQ) as a cofactor. Members of this family are involved in the oxidation
      of a wide range of substrates, including primary alcohols, polyvinyl alcohol,
      glycerol, and aldose sugars. These enzymes catalyze the conversion of alcohols
      to aldehydes and can further oxidize aldehydes to carboxylic acids. Some members
      are also involved in the metabolism of specific compounds such as lupanine and
      quinate. The enzymes play roles in energy conservation, detoxification, and
      various metabolic pathways, often linked to the use of alcohols as carbon and
      energy sources.
