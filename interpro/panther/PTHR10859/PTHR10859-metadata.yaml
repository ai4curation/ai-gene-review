    short: Glycosyltrans_2
  description:
  - text: The glycosyltransferase 2 family is involved in various glycosylation processes,
      which are critical for the biosynthesis of important biomolecules. Members of
      the CrtQ subfamily catalyze the glycosylation of 4,4'-diaponeurosporenoate,
      a step in the biosynthesis of staphyloxanthin, an orange pigment in staphylococci.
      Other members, such as the ALG5 homologs, are dolichyl-phosphate beta-glucosyltransferases
      involved in protein N-linked glycosylation, synthesizing dolichyl beta-D-glucosyl
      phosphate for N-glycan precursor assembly. Some proteins in the family are also
      implicated in the assembly of lipid-linked oligosaccharides and the maturation
      of specific glycoproteins. The family includes enzymes like UDP-N-acetylglucosamine--dolichyl-phosphate
      N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and glycosyltransferase AglD, which participate
      in the assembly of N-linked glycosylation structures on surface proteins such
      as the S-layer glycoprotein and flagellins.
