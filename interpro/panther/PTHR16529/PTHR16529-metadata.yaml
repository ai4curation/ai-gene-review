    name: Fertilization and immune response mediator protein
    short: Fert-Immune_med_protein
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that are involved in various biological
      processes, including fertilization, signal transduction, and immune response.
      Some proteins in this family are known to play a role in the fertilization process
      by mediating the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida and facilitating the
      migration of spermatozoa into the oviduct. They may also be involved in promoting
      protein tyrosine phosphorylation as part of signal transduction pathways. Other
      members are implicated in the activation of neutrophils, including degranulation
      and superoxide production, and may influence neutrophil adhesion and migration
      by interacting with integrins and chemokine signaling. Additionally, these proteins
      can participate in neutrophil transendothelial migration and may enhance vascular
      integrity during this process.
