  description:
  - text: The FLO8 family consists of transcriptional regulators that play a crucial
      role in various cellular processes. Members of the family are involved in the
      control of gene expression related to conidiation, adherence, and biofilm formation.
      They achieve this by regulating the expression of key regulatory genes. In some
      species, these proteins are essential for virulence, indicating their importance
      in pathogenicity. Additionally, certain members of the FLO8 family are implicated
      in transcription regulation of collagen genes by binding to single-stranded
      polypyrimidine sequences in promoter regions. This suggests a broader role in
      gene expression modulation beyond fungal-specific functions.
