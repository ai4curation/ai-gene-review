  description:
  - text: The iron/manganese superoxide dismutase family comprises enzymes that play
      a crucial role in cellular defense against oxidative stress. Members of this
      family catalyze the dismutation of the superoxide anion radical (O2-) into oxygen
      (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), effectively mitigating the potential damage
      caused by these reactive oxygen species. These radicals are byproducts of normal
      cellular metabolism and can be harmful to biological systems if not regulated.
      The enzymes in this family are characterized by their metal cofactor, which
      can be either iron or manganese, and are found in various cellular compartments,
      including mitochondria. Some members are known to be resistant to inhibition
      by cyanide and azide, and their activity can be modulated by various factors,
      including the presence of hydrogen peroxide or metallothioneins.
