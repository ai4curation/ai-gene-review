  description:
  - text: The CWC25 family comprises proteins that are involved in the process of
      pre-mRNA splicing. Members of the CWC25 family are recognized as components
      of the spliceosome, a complex molecular machine responsible for the removal
      of introns from a pre-mRNA transcript and the ligation of the remaining exons
      to form a mature mRNA molecule. The precise role of CWC25 proteins within the
      spliceosome is not detailed in the provided information, but their ubiquitous
      presence in organisms ranging from yeast to humans suggests a conserved function
      in the splicing pathway. The involvement in such a critical step of gene expression
      regulation underscores the importance of CWC25 family proteins in cellular biology.
