    name: Mitochondrial Protein Adenylyltransferase SelO
    short: SELO
  description:
  - text: The SELO family proteins are characterized by their enzymatic activity,
      catalyzing the adenylyltransferase reaction known as AMPylation. This modification
      involves the transfer of adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) to serine, threonine,
      and tyrosine residues on target proteins. Members of the SELO family are suggested
      to be redox-active selenoproteins, which may play a role in mitochondrial redox
      regulation through interactions with other redox-sensitive proteins. The AMPylation
      activity of the SELO family is implicated in the regulation of protein function
      and signaling pathways, although the full spectrum of their biological roles
      remains to be elucidated.
