  description:
  - text: The protein family is involved in the transport of amino acids across cellular
      membranes. Members of the family function as transporters or antiporters, often
      forming heterodimers with SLC3A2 or other proteins to mediate the exchange of
      amino acids. They can transport a variety of amino acids, including large neutral
      amino acids, cationic amino acids, and small neutral L- and D-amino acids. Some
      members are involved in the uptake of essential amino acids, thyroid hormones,
      and compounds like L-DOPA and methylmercury complexes, playing roles in nutrient
      absorption, neurotransmission, cellular signaling, and detoxification. The family
      includes transporters that participate in the regulation of mTORC1 signaling,
      glycinergic inhibitory neurotransmission, and nitric oxide synthesis. They are
      part of the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) superfamily and the L-type
      amino acid transporter (LAT) family.
