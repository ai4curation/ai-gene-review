  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases that are involved
      in the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for proteasomal degradation.
      Members of this family are characterized by a RING-CH-type zinc finger domain
      essential for their ligase activity. They accept ubiquitin from E2 ubiquitin-conjugating
      enzymes and transfer it to specific substrates, often with 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination,
      leading to the degradation of these target proteins. Some family members are
      involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway,
      targeting misfolded proteins in the ER membrane as well as soluble nuclear and
      cytoplasmic proteins. Others may regulate metabolic enzymes or degrade mislocalized
      proteins, contributing to cellular quality control.
