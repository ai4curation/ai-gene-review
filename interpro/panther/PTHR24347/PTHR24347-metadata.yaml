  description:
  - text: The protein family includes calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases
      (CAMKs) that play crucial roles in various cellular processes. Members of this
      family are involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis, excitation-contraction
      coupling in the heart, synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitter release, and long-term
      potentiation. They target ion channels, transporters, and transcription factors
      to regulate heart function and may contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy
      and heart failure. In the central nervous system, they are essential for dendritic
      spine and synapse formation, neuronal plasticity, and learning. Some family
      members are implicated in the regulation of glycogen breakdown, skeletal muscle
      function, cell cycle progression, and DNA damage response. The family also includes
      kinases with no detectable activity, which may have regulatory roles.
