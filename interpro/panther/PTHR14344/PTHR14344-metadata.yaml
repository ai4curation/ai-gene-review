    short: tRNA_Anticodon_Mtase-Reg
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the post-transcriptional modification
      of tRNA molecules. Members of this family function in partnership with specific
      methyltransferases to methylate the 2'-O-ribose of nucleotides at the 34th position
      of the tRNA anticodon loop. This methylation is crucial for the correct positioning
      of the substrate tRNA during the modification process. Additionally, these proteins
      have roles in cellular processes such as the suppression of autophagy induced
      by amino acid starvation and the enhancement of cell growth suppression activities
      mediated by certain kinases. Some members also participate in the regulation
      of the retromer complex, which is important for the recycling of plasma membrane
      proteins from endosomes, and may be involved in the regulation of transposable
      elements.
