    name: Striated Muscle Structural and Regulatory Protein
    short: Striated_Muscle_Regulatory
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the structural organization and functional
      regulation of striated muscle cells. They are associated with the myofibrillar
      M band and A bands, where they interact with major components such as myosin,
      actin, and titin. These interactions are important for maintaining the integrity
      of the sarcomere structure and for modulating the activity of muscle contraction.
      Some family members are also implicated in cardiac function, potentially influencing
      muscle contraction and the conduction systems of the heart. Additionally, certain
      proteins within this family may play a role in myofibrillogenesis, the process
      of forming the contractile threads in muscle cells.
