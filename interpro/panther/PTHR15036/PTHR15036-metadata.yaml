  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in various aspects of neural development
      and function, including cell recognition, cell adhesion, synaptic junction formation,
      and signal transmission. Members of this family are typically found on the neuronal
      cell surface and play roles in the formation and maintenance of synaptic connections
      by interacting with other proteins such as neuroligins. They are also implicated
      in the organization of myelinated axons and may influence neurotransmitter release
      and postsynaptic receptor regulation. Some members are involved in the structural
      maturation of synapses and may participate in the modulation of growth factor
      signaling, as well as the regulation of calcium ion homeostasis in neurons.
