    name: DNA Cytosine-5 Methyltransferase
    short: C5-Methyltransferase
  description:
  - text: The C5-methyltransferase family is comprised of enzymes that primarily methylate
      cytosine residues within specific DNA sequences, playing a crucial role in the
      regulation of gene expression, maintenance of DNA methylation patterns, and
      protection of DNA from endonuclease cleavage. Members of this family recognize
      various DNA motifs, often methylating the cytosine at the 5' position. Some
      members preferentially methylate hemimethylated DNA, contributing to epigenetic
      inheritance by preserving methylation patterns during DNA replication and cell
      division. Others are part of restriction-modification systems, protecting bacterial
      genomes from phage infections by methylating specific sequences and thereby
      preventing cleavage by corresponding restriction endonucleases. This family
      also includes enzymes involved in the defense against phages through systems
      like DISARM. In plants, these methyltransferases are involved in genomic imprinting,
      embryogenesis, and seed viability, often targeting CHG and CpG sites for methylation,
      which is essential for gene silencing and suppression of transposable elements.
