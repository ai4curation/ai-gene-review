    name: Glycosyltransferase-like domain-containing protein 1

  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is characterized by a glycosyltransferase-like domain.
      Members of this family are involved in the transfer of sugar moieties from activated
      donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. The
      activity of these enzymes is critical for the biosynthesis of complex carbohydrates
      and glycoconjugates. The glycosyltransferase group 1 to which these proteins
      belong suggests that they may have a common evolutionary origin and share structural
      features that are typical for this group. The Glycosyltransferase 4 subfamily
      indicates a more specific functional and structural categorization within the
      broader group, which may imply specialized roles in glycosylation processes.
