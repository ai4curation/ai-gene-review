  description:
  - text: The protein family is involved in amino acid metabolism, specifically in
      the transamination reactions that are crucial for the synthesis and degradation
      of various amino acids. Members of the family function as aminotransferases,
      enzymes that catalyze the transfer of an amino group from a donor molecule to
      an acceptor. Key reactions include the conversion of putrescine to GABA via
      4-aminobutanal, the interconversion of ornithine and glutamate semialdehyde,
      and the transamination of N(2)-succinylornithine and alpha-ketoglutarate. Some
      members also participate in the arginine and lysine biosynthetic pathways, acting
      on substrates such as acetylornithine and succinyldiaminopimelate. The family
      is characterized by the presence of pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor, which
      is typical for class-III pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferases.
