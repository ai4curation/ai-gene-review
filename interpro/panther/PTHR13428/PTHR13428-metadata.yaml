    name: Inner Nuclear Membrane ESCRT-Associated Protein
    short: INM_ESCRT-Associated
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is associated with the inner nuclear membrane and
      plays a crucial role in nuclear structure organization, maintenance of nuclear
      envelope integrity, and nuclear envelope reformation after mitosis. Members
      of this family function as transmembrane adapters for the ESCRT machinery, facilitating
      ESCRT-mediated nuclear envelope closure during anaphase. They are involved in
      the organization of heterochromatin at the nuclear envelope and help maintain
      its structure under mechanical stress. These proteins are essential for embryonic
      development, cardiac homeostasis, and proper heart function. They also participate
      in various signaling pathways, including MAPK and AKT, and are required for
      myoblast differentiation through ERK signaling regulation. Additionally, they
      have roles in chromosome segregation, anchoring chromosome arms at the nuclear
      periphery, and contributing to the closure of nuclear envelope holes post-mitosis.
