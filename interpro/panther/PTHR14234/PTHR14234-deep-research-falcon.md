1. Executive Summary
The PANTHER family PTHR14234 (InterPro IPR040325) comprises RIM-binding protein (RIMBP) relatives that scaffold presynaptic active zones (AZs) by linking Rab3-interacting molecules (RIMs) to voltage‑gated Ca2+ channels (CaV) via SH3–proline interactions and fibronectin type-3 (FN3) repeats. Canonical neuronal members (RIMBP1/TSPOAP1 and RIMBP2) share a multidomain architecture and function to position CaV channels near synaptic vesicles, ensuring tight Ca2+–secretion coupling and tuning release probability and plasticity. In contrast, RIMBP3 paralogs act primarily in spermiogenesis and centrosome/manchette biology, indicating subfunctionalization beyond the ancestral synaptic role. Recent 2023–2024 studies strengthened evidence for RIMBP2 controlling presynaptic Ca2+ channel abundance and Ca2+ currents at mammalian synapses, and linked TCF4-dependent neurodevelopmental pathology to dysregulated RIMBP2 expression. Human genetics firmly implicate TSPOAP1 (RIMBP1) in autosomal-recessive dystonia with cerebellar involvement. Together, data support subfamily specialization with implications for GO annotation; synaptic AZ functions should not be uniformly propagated to RIMBP3 paralogs.

2. Ancestral Function
RIMBPs are modular AZ scaffolds with an N‑terminal SH3 domain, central FN3 repeats, and two C‑terminal SH3 domains that bind proline‑rich motifs in CaV channel C‑termini and in RIMs, thus positioning CaV channels at release sites and coupling action potentials to vesicle fusion. This arrangement supports tight Ca2+ nanodomains and reliable neurotransmission, and is conserved from invertebrates to mammals. The ancestral function is therefore presynaptic Ca2+ channel tethering and coupling to exocytosis within the CAZ, interacting with RIM, ELKS/CAST/Bassoon, and related AZ organizers. (mencacci2021biallelicvariantsin pages 1-2) (grauel2016rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-1) (krinner2021rimbindingproteinsare pages 1-2) (alvanos2023quantitativemolecularphysiology pages 25-27) (wu2023theroleof pages 11-11, wu2023theroleof pages 12-13)

3. Subfamily Analysis
- RIMBP1 (TSPOAP1)
  • Structure/partners: Canonical SH3–FN3–SH3 organization; binds RIMs, CaV channels, and AZ scaffolds such as Bassoon/ELKS. (mencacci2021biallelicvariantsin pages 1-2) (krinner2021rimbindingproteinsare pages 1-2)
  • Function: Positions CaV channels to secure tight Ca2+–release coupling; contributes to AZ integrity. (mencacci2021biallelicvariantsin pages 1-2)
  • Disease/phenotype: Biallelic TSPOAP1 variants cause autosomal‑recessive dystonia; loss‑of‑function associates with early-onset generalized dystonia with cerebellar atrophy, while a specific missense (p.G1808S) enhances spike‑evoked Ca2+ and neurotransmission and is linked to adult-onset focal dystonia. Mouse RIMBP1 knockout shows motor abnormalities and cerebellar synaptic deficits. (mencacci2021biallelicvariantsin pages 1-2)

- RIMBP2
  • Structure/partners: Canonical neuronal architecture; binds RIMs and CaV1.3/CaV2.x channels; associates with Bassoon/ELKS; interacts functionally within RIM–Munc13 networks. (grauel2016rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-1) (krinner2017rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-2) (krinner2021rimbindingproteinsare pages 1-2)
  • Function: Fine‑tunes CaV channel localization and numbers, setting initial release probability and short‑term plasticity at hippocampal synapses; in hair-cell ribbon synapses, promotes numerous CaV1.3 channels and rapid RRP replenishment. (grauel2016rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-1) (krinner2017rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-2)
  • Recent developments (2023–2024): At hippocampal mossy fiber boutons, direct presynaptic recordings in RIMBP2 knockout show ~30% reduction in peak Ca2+ current (WT 44 ± 5.4 pA, KO 27 ± 3.9 pA; p = 0.0248) and decreased P/Q-type channel abundance by STED imaging; initial release probability is lowered, due to reduced Ca2+ influx and impaired fusion competence; elevated [Ca2+]o partially restores release. (miyano2024rimbp2regulatesca2+ pages 1-2, miyano2024rimbp2regulatesca2+ pages 2-5) Transcriptionally, RIMBP2 is a top differentially expressed gene in patient-derived cortical neurons with TCF4 mutations, and RIMBP2 overexpression rescues synaptic transmission deficits, linking neurodevelopmental pathology to presynaptic AZ machinery. (davis2024tcf4mutationsdisrupt pages 1-3, davis2024tcf4mutationsdisrupt pages 14-15)

- RIMBP3 (and paralogs)
  • Context/partners: Testis-enriched; associates with manchette/centrosome during spermiogenesis; implicated in microtubule/centrosome and ciliary-related processes rather than synaptic AZs. (omolaoye2022usingpubliclyavailable pages 1-2)
  • Function: Non-synaptic structural roles in spermiogenesis and sperm head shaping; diverged from the ancestral synaptic CaV-tethering function. (omolaoye2022usingpubliclyavailable pages 1-2)
  • Evidence: Transcriptomic meta-analysis identifies RIMBP3 among shared DEGs across azoospermia/infertility datasets, supporting a role in spermatogenesis rather than synaptic transmission. (omolaoye2022usingpubliclyavailable pages 1-2)

4. Functional Divergence: Neo-functionalization and Subfunctionalization
- Subfunctionalization within neuronal synapses: RIMBP2 emerges as a dominant synaptic isoform in many CNS synapses, fine‑tuning CaV clustering and release probability at hippocampal and auditory ribbon synapses, whereas RIMBP1 contributes to AZ organization and Ca2+ coupling across specific circuits including cerebellar pathways. Quantitatively, RIMBP2 KO reduces mossy-fiber presynaptic Ca2+ currents by ~30% and lowers initial release probability; in hair cells, RIMBP2 supports a large complement of CaV1.3 channels and fast RRP replenishment, indicating synapse-type specializations. (miyano2024rimbp2regulatesca2+ pages 1-2, miyano2024rimbp2regulatesca2+ pages 2-5) (krinner2017rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-2) (grauel2016rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-1)
- Neo-/subfunctionalization outside synapses: RIMBP3 paralogs localize to the manchette/centrosome during spermiogenesis and are linked to male infertility phenotypes in transcriptomic studies—functions distinct from synaptic CaV channel tethering—supporting subfamily divergence within PTHR14234. (omolaoye2022usingpubliclyavailable pages 1-2)
- Mesoscale assembly/phase separation roles: RIMBPs participate in AZ protein networks with RIM/ELKS/Liprin-α; multivalent interactions and LLPS-like behaviors have been proposed to organize channel-rich nanodomains and ordered AZ lattices, consistent with a structural/architectural role beyond mere tethering. (alvanos2023quantitativemolecularphysiology pages 25-27) (wu2023theroleof pages 12-13)

5. Branch Length Analysis
Explicit branch-length data for PTHR14234 were not available in the surveyed sources. However, functional and localization divergence strongly suggests long evolutionary distance between RIMBP3 paralogs (testis/manchette/centrosome) and neuronal RIMBP1/2 (AZ scaffolds). Within neuronal paralogs, RIMBP1 vs RIMBP2 exhibit specialization by synapse type (e.g., hair-cell ribbon vs hippocampal boutons), implying moderate divergence likely correlating with differences in CaV partner specificity (CaV1.3 vs CaV2.x) and plasticity phenotypes. Future phylogenetic analysis of the PANTHER tree would clarify branch lengths and recent duplications. (grauel2016rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-1, krinner2017rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-2, omolaoye2022usingpubliclyavailable pages 1-2)

6. GO Annotation Issues and Recommendations
- Appropriate core annotations for RIMBP1/2
  • Cellular component: presynaptic active zone; cytomatrix of the active zone. (krinner2021rimbindingproteinsare pages 1-2, grauel2016rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-1)
  • Molecular function: scaffold protein binding; SH3 domain binding; voltage-gated calcium channel binding. (mencacci2021biallelicvariantsin pages 1-2, grauel2016rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-1)
  • Biological process: regulation of neurotransmitter secretion; regulation of presynaptic Ca2+ currents; synaptic vesicle exocytosis; synaptic vesicle priming/replenishment (context-dependent). (grauel2016rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-1, krinner2017rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-2, miyano2024rimbp2regulatesca2+ pages 1-2)
- Subfamily-specific distinctions
  • RIMBP2: add terms for “positive regulation of presynaptic calcium ion transmembrane transport” and “regulation of release probability at hippocampal mossy fiber synapse” and “inner hair cell ribbon synapse organization,” supported by 2024 eLife and prior functional work. (miyano2024rimbp2regulatesca2+ pages 1-2, miyano2024rimbp2regulatesca2+ pages 2-5) (krinner2017rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-2)
  • RIMBP1 (TSPOAP1): include disease annotation links (dystonia) and “cerebellar Purkinje cell synapse organization” where supported by model data. (mencacci2021biallelicvariantsin pages 1-2)
  • RIMBP3: exclude neuronal synaptic AZ terms (e.g., “presynaptic active zone”) from generic propagation; instead annotate “spermatid development,” “spermiogenesis,” “manchette organization,” and “centrosome organization.” (omolaoye2022usingpubliclyavailable pages 1-2)
- Potential misannotations
  • Avoid propagating “regulation of neurotransmitter release” or “VGCC clustering at AZ” to RIMBP3 paralogs. (omolaoye2022usingpubliclyavailable pages 1-2)
  • Consider context specificity for RIMBP2 vs RIMBP1 regarding CaV subtype interactions (CaV1.3 at ribbon vs CaV2.x at CNS synapses). (krinner2017rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-2, grauel2016rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-1)

7. Current Applications and Real-World Implementations
- Disease genetics and biomarkers: TSPOAP1 testing explains pediatric-onset dystonia with cerebellar atrophy; expression of TSPOAP1 in blood correlates with ataxia severity in SCA3, suggesting peripheral transcript biomarker potential for disease staging/stratification. (mencacci2021biallelicvariantsin pages 1-2) (miyano2024rimbp2regulatesca2+ pages 2-5)
- Presynaptic physiology: RIMBP2 KO mouse models inform mechanisms of reduced release probability and altered facilitation; super-resolution and direct presynaptic recordings provide quantitative targets for modeling and for interpreting synaptic deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders. (grauel2016rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-1) (miyano2024rimbp2regulatesca2+ pages 1-2, miyano2024rimbp2regulatesca2+ pages 2-5)
- Neurodevelopmental therapeutics: In patient-derived neurons, boosting RIMBP2 expression rescues network deficits in TCF4 mutation background, nominating presynaptic AZ scaffolds as targets for intervention in Pitt Hopkins syndrome–related synaptopathies. (davis2024tcf4mutationsdisrupt pages 1-3)

8. Expert Opinions and Analysis
Across diverse synapses, RIMBP2 serves as a dosage-sensitive organizer of Ca2+ channel nanodomains that calibrate release probability; subtle decreases in presynaptic Ca2+ influx (~30%) translate into measurable reductions in initial release without grossly altering channel kinetics—highlighting a structural positioning mechanism rather than gating modulation. The genetic spectrum in TSPOAP1 illustrates that both insufficient and excessive spike-evoked Ca2+ signaling can be pathogenic, emphasizing the necessity of tight nanodomain control by RIMBPs. The extra-synaptic specialization of RIMBP3 underscores that GO annotations must be constrained by subfamily and tissue context to avoid misannotation. Finally, mesoscale AZ ordering likely arises from multivalent RIM/RIMBP/ELKS interactions, potentially via LLPS-like mechanisms, adding an architectural layer to channel tethering. (miyano2024rimbp2regulatesca2+ pages 1-2, miyano2024rimbp2regulatesca2+ pages 2-5, mencacci2021biallelicvariantsin pages 1-2, alvanos2023quantitativemolecularphysiology pages 25-27, wu2023theroleof pages 12-13)

9. Relevant Statistics and Data (selected recent findings)

(miyano2024rimbp2regulatesca2+ pages 1-2, miyano2024rimbp2regulatesca2+ pages 2-5)
- Hair-cell ribbon synapses: RIMBP2 promotes a large number of CaV1.3 channels and supports fast replenishment of RRP; RIMBP1/2 double knockout leads to synaptopathic hearing impairment. (krinner2017rimbindingprotein2 pages 1-2) (krinner2021rimbindingproteinsare pages 1-2)
- TSPOAP1 (RIMBP1) genetics: Biallelic loss-of-function causes juvenile‑onset generalized dystonia with cerebellar atrophy; a gain-of-function missense increases spike-evoked Ca2+ and is associated with adult-onset focal dystonia. (mencacci2021biallelicvariantsin pages 1-2)
- Blood transcriptomics in SCA3: TSPOAP1 expression in blood correlates with ataxia severity and changes across disease stages, supporting use as a stratification biomarker. (miyano2024rimbp2regulatesca2+ pages 2-5)

Notes on coverage and limitations
- Explicit branch-length metrics for PTHR14234 were not found in the surveyed texts; functional divergence in localization and partner specificity was used as a proxy for evolutionary divergence.
