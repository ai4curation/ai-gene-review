  description:
  - text: The Ser/Thr protein kinase family encompasses a diverse group of enzymes
      that phosphorylate substrates on serine or threonine residues, a key regulatory
      mechanism in cellular processes. Members of this family are involved in various
      functions, including the regulation of cell cycle progression, DNA replication,
      and repair, as well as playing roles in apoptosis inhibition, cytoskeletal modulation,
      and immune response evasion. Some kinases within this family act as virulence
      determinants in pathogens, modulating host cell machinery to facilitate viral
      replication and spread. Others are implicated in glucose regulation, stress
      response, and transcriptional regulation during pheromone signaling. This family
      also includes kinases that respond to DNA damage, contributing to checkpoint-mediated
      cell cycle arrest and promoting DNA repair mechanisms, highlighting their importance
      in maintaining genomic integrity.
