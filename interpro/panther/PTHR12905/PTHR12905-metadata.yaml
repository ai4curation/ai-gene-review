  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes metallophosphoesterases that may exhibit
      activity in vitro. Members are suggested to play roles in the development of
      the nervous system and are known to be inhibited by nmolar levels of AMP and
      GMP. One outlier, a pectinolytic enzyme, does not belong to this family and
      is likely included in error.
