  description:
  - text: The ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease family, characterized by the presence
      of peptidase M41 and AAA ATPase domains, is involved in the quality control,
      assembly, and regulation of mitochondrial and membrane proteins. Members of
      this family exhibit processive, ATP-dependent metallopeptidase activity, targeting
      both cytoplasmic and membrane proteins for degradation. They play crucial roles
      in the maintenance of mitochondrial function, including the formation and regulation
      of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, the turnover of misfolded
      or mistranslated polypeptides, and the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory
      chain complexes. Some family members are essential for neuron development, mediating
      the degradation of specific mitochondrial proteins to promote efficient assembly
      of protein complexes. This family also contributes to the proteolytic maturation
      of other mitochondrial proteases and is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial
      dynamics through the processing of key proteins like OPA1.
