  description:
  - text: The SWI/SNF-related protein family is involved in chromatin remodeling and
      transcription regulation. Members of this family are components of multiprotein
      complexes, such as the SWI/SNF complex and the RSC complex, which utilize ATP
      to alter DNA-histone contacts within nucleosomes. This alteration leads to changes
      in nucleosome position, facilitating or repressing the binding of gene-specific
      transcription factors, thus modulating gene expression. Some family members
      are also involved in the circadian clock, developmental transitions, and responses
      to environmental stresses. They play roles in various processes including the
      regulation of flowering, cold tolerance, and neuron-specific gene expression.
      The family includes transcription factors that can act as activators or repressors
      and are essential for proper development and cellular responses to external
      stimuli.
