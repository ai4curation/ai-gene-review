  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in various biological processes, including
      embryonic arterial endothelium differentiation, vascular morphogenesis, and
      the modulation of nociception. They function through receptor-dependent signaling
      pathways, particularly involving the ACVRL1 receptor and bone morphogenetic
      proteins such as GDF2/BMP9 and BMP10. Additionally, these proteins interact
      with and modulate the activity of TRPA1 and TRPV1, which are molecular sensors
      and mediators of pain signals in dorsal root ganglia neurons. They are known
      to alter the interaction between these channels, influencing the single-channel
      open probability and thus affecting pain perception.
