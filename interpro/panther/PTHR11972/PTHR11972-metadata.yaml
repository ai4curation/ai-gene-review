  description:
  - text: The RBOH/FRE family proteins are involved in various redox processes across
      different species. Members of the RBOH subfamily are calcium-dependent NADPH
      oxidases that generate superoxide, playing roles in pathogen response, reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) signaling, and regulation of cellular processes such as
      stomatal closing. The FRE subfamily members are metalloreductases, likely involved
      in iron and copper homeostasis, and include ferric chelate reductases that participate
      in iron mobilization and uptake. Some members also function in copper reduction
      and are implicated in responses to environmental stressors like copper deficiency.
      Dual oxidases, another subfamily, generate hydrogen peroxide for thyroid hormone
      synthesis and antimicrobial defense, with some having peroxidase activity. Collectively,
      these proteins are integral to cellular redox homeostasis, signaling, and defense
      mechanisms.
