    short: ComplexI_LYR/SDHAF1
  description:
  - text: The Complex I LYR Family & SDHAF1 Subfamily are involved in the assembly
      and function of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. Members of the family
      play a crucial role in integrating the N-module into complex I, which is essential
      for the proper function of the electron transport chain. Additionally, some
      members are involved in the assembly of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH or complex
      II), promoting the maturation of its iron-sulfur subunit and protecting it from
      oxidative damage. This is vital for the TCA cycle and electron transport chain,
      as SDH links the oxidation of succinate to fumarate with the reduction of ubiquinone
      to ubiquinol.
