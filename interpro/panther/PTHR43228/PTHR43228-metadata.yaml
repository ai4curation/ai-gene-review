  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes response regulators that are integral to
      His-to-Asp phosphorelay signal transduction systems. They are phosphorylated
      on an Asp residue within a receiver domain, which activates their ability to
      regulate the transcription of target genes. Some members act as negative regulators
      of cytokinin signaling, while others may activate type-A response regulators
      in response to cytokinins. Additionally, this family encompasses proteins involved
      in sensory signal transmission to flagellar motors, influencing their rotation
      and thus affecting chemotaxis. Another member functions as part of a two-component
      system that regulates gene expression in response to specific environmental
      stimuli, such as glutamine levels.
