  description:
  - text: The protein family encompasses a group of secreted proteins that play diverse
      roles in physiological processes such as inhibition of proteases, antagonism
      of growth factors, and regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and
      immune responses. Members of the family are known to interact with and inhibit
      various proteases like subtilisin-like serine proteases and trypsin, as well
      as growth factors such as activin and TGF-beta family members. They are involved
      in defense mechanisms between plants and pathogens, neural induction, angiogenesis,
      and hematopoiesis. Some members also possess neurotoxic properties by inhibiting
      ion channels. The family includes proteins with kazal serine protease inhibitor
      signatures and those that bind directly to activin, functioning as activin antagonists,
      thereby regulating the biosynthesis and secretion of hormones like FSH.
