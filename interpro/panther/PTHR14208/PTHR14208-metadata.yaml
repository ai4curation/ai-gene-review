  description:
  - text: This family of proteins functions as translation initiation regulators.
      They are known to repress non-AUG initiated translation and repeat-associated
      non-AUG (RAN) initiated translation, acting as competitive inhibitors of eukaryotic
      translation initiation factor 5 (EIF5). These proteins increase the accuracy
      of translation initiation by competing with EIF5 for interaction with EIF2S2
      within the 43S pre-initiation complex, in a manner dependent on binding to EIF3C.
      Additionally, some members of this family are involved in enhancing histone
      H4 gene transcription, although they do not directly bind to DNA.
