    name: HEAT Repeat-containing Protein 6
    short: HEAT6
  description:
  - text: The HEAT repeat-containing protein 6 family is characterized by the presence
      of HEAT repeats, which are tandemly repeated units typically involved in intracellular
      transport processes and protein-protein interactions. Members of this family
      are found across various species, indicating a conserved functional role. The
      human variant is noted as an amplification-dependent oncogene, suggesting a
      potential involvement in cancer progression through mechanisms that may include
      altered cell signaling or chromosomal stability. The exact functions in other
      species are not specified, but the conservation of the HEAT repeats implies
      a fundamental role in cellular machinery.
