    name: Iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis protein NfuA
    short: Fe-S_biogenesis_NfuA
  description:
  - text: The NfuA family proteins are involved in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe/S)
      clusters, which are essential for various cellular processes. Members of this
      family bind to 4Fe-4S clusters and can transfer them to apoproteins, playing
      a crucial role in the maturation of Fe/S proteins. They may also function as
      scaffolds or chaperones for damaged Fe/S proteins, assisting in their repair
      or assembly under conditions such as oxidative stress or iron starvation. The
      NfuA family is characterized by its involvement in maintaining Fe/S cluster
      homeostasis, which is vital for proper cellular function and response to environmental
      challenges.
