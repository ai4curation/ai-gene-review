  description:
  - text: The FES1/SIL1 protein family includes nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs)
      that are essential for protein folding and translocation processes. Members
      of the FES1 subfamily function as NEFs for Hsp70 chaperones, accelerating the
      release of ADP and enhancing the efficiency of Hsp70-mediated protein folding.
      The SIL1 subfamily members are involved in protein translocation and folding
      within the endoplasmic reticulum, acting as NEFs for the ER lumenal chaperone
      HSPA5 or KAR2. Additionally, the family includes Hsp70-binding proteins that
      inhibit HSPA1A chaperone activity, affecting ATP binding and interfering with
      ubiquitination and chaperone-assisted degradation of proteins.
