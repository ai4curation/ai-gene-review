  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in a variety of cellular processes including
      ribosome biogenesis, cell cycle regulation, and intracellular transport mechanisms.
      Members of this family are known to interact with components of the cell's machinery
      such as dynein, a motor protein that moves along microtubules, and are essential
      for the correct positioning of the mitotic spindle and nuclear migration. Some
      proteins in this family function as adapters, targeting other proteins to specific
      cellular structures. Additionally, proteins in this family have roles in the
      regulation of Notch signaling pathways, which are crucial for cell differentiation
      and development. They also participate in ubiquitination processes that can
      influence inflammation, immunity, and apoptosis.
