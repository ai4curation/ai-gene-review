    name: Immunoreceptor signaling adapters
    short: Immunoreceptor_sig_adapters
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes adapters and linkers that play critical
      roles in immunoreceptor signaling pathways. They are involved in the regulation
      of signaling cascades downstream of various receptors such as T-cell antigen
      receptors, B-cell antigen receptors, and mast cell degranulation receptors.
      These proteins mediate interactions through SH2 domains and proline-rich regions,
      facilitating the activation of kinases, the mobilization of calcium, and the
      activation of transcription factors like NF-kappa-B and NFAT. They are essential
      for various cellular processes including cell development, activation, and apoptosis.
      Some members are also implicated in the negative regulation of natural killer
      cell-activating receptors and the production of interferon-gamma, as well as
      in promoting reactive oxidative species generation and necrosis.
