  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes transcriptional repressors and histone
      methyltransferases. Members are involved in various biological processes such
      as neural development, neuronal differentiation, and steroidogenesis. Some proteins
      in this family act on histone H3 lysine residues, modifying chromatin structure
      and influencing gene expression. Others play roles in oligodendrocyte differentiation
      and remyelination following nerve injury. Additionally, certain family members
      are implicated in spermatid development and fertility, with functions that include
      the regulation of spermatocyte-specific genes.
