  description:
  - text: The Rab family of small GTPases is involved in the regulation of intracellular
      vesicle trafficking and protein transport. Members of the family act as molecular
      switches cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states, interacting
      with various effector proteins to mediate endo-lysosomal trafficking, vesicle
      formation, movement, and fusion. They play crucial roles in processes such as
      endosome maturation, phagosome maturation and acidification, melanosome biogenesis,
      and autophagy. Rab proteins are also implicated in the transport of proteins
      between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network, and in the trafficking of pathogen-containing
      phagosomes. Their regulatory activities are essential for maintaining cellular
      homeostasis, growth-factor-mediated signaling, nutrient uptake, and the immune
      response.
