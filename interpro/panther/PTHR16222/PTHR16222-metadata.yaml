    name: ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase
    short: ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase
  description:
  - text: The ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase family is involved in the regulation of various
      cellular processes through the hydrolysis of ADP-ribose attached to proteins.
      Members of the family act as hydrolases, preferentially targeting the alpha-O-linkage
      of ADP-ribose, particularly when attached to serine or threonine residues, playing
      a crucial role in the DNA damage response. The family includes both active enzymes
      that contribute to the reversal of ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification,
      and inactive members that may have alternative functions, such as involvement
      in myofibril assembly during cardiac development. Some members are implicated
      in the degradation of free poly(ADP-ribose), preventing cell death signaling
      pathways like parthanatos. Others may participate in interbacterial competition
      systems or the regulation of nitrogen fixation in prokaryotes. The family is
      characterized by a conformational change upon substrate binding, which facilitates
      substrate recognition and catalysis.
