  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the splicing of pre-mRNAs, a critical
      step in gene expression where introns are removed from transcribed pre-mRNAs.
      Members of this family are essential components of the spliceosome, particularly
      the 17S U2 snRNP complex, which is crucial for early spliceosome assembly and
      the recognition of the intron branch site. They facilitate the stable binding
      of U2 snRNP to the branchpoint sequence in pre-mRNA and are necessary for the
      assembly of the 'A' complex. Additionally, these proteins may play a role in
      the assembly of the 'E' complex and participate in the splicing of U12-type
      introns as part of the minor spliceosome. Some members may also be involved
      in cellular responses to temperature changes and potentially in the endoplasmic
      reticulum-associated protein degradation pathway.
