  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes components that are involved in the structural
      organization and integrity of the cell envelope. They typically exhibit a tripartite
      organization with a C-terminal outer membrane beta-barrel domain, a central
      trimeric coiled coil, and an N-terminal domain that can interact with the peptidoglycan
      layer. Some members function as anchoring proteins that bind cellulosomes to
      the cell surface, while others form a paracrystalline mono-layered assembly
      known as the S-layer, which coats the surface of bacteria. The S-layer proteins
      play roles in protecting the cell, potentially acting as nonselective channels
      that facilitate the exchange of substances with the environment. Additionally,
      some proteins within this family may be involved in linking the outer membrane
      to the inner membrane or the peptidoglycan layer, contributing to the cell's
      structural stability.
