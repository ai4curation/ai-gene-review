  description:
  - text: The protein family includes antigen-presenting molecules that display peptides
      or lipid antigens to T-cell receptors, contributing to immune surveillance and
      response. Members are involved in presenting foreign antigens, including microbial
      and tumor-derived peptides, to the immune system. Some act as ligands for receptors
      like KLRK1/NKG2D, mediating natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Others bind self
      and non-self glycolipids, presenting them to natural killer T-cells. The family
      also includes proteins that regulate humoral immunity by recycling IgG, extending
      its half-life, and transferring passive immunity. Additionally, some members
      bind to transferrin receptor, modulating iron uptake, while others are involved
      in stress-induced self-antigen recognition or immune regulation at the maternal-fetal
      interface. Overall, the family plays a crucial role in immune system regulation,
      pathogen defense, and maintaining homeostasis.
