  description:
  - text: The complex I 30 kDa subunit family is involved in the mitochondrial and
      chloroplastic respiratory chains, functioning in electron transfer processes.
      Members of this family are core subunits of the NADH dehydrogenase (Complex
      I), which catalyzes electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone or plastoquinone,
      using them as electron acceptors. This process is coupled to proton translocation
      across the membrane, conserving redox energy in a proton gradient essential
      for ATP synthesis. Some subunits also participate in the oxidation of F(420)H(2)
      with quinones in methylotrophic methanogens, contributing to the metabolism
      when growing on methanol or methylamines.
