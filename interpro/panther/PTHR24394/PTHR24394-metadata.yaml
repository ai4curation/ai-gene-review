  description:
  - text: The Krüppel C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family is characterized by its
      involvement in transcriptional regulation, often acting as transcriptional repressors
      or activators. Members of this family play crucial roles in various biological
      processes including embryonic stem cell differentiation, myogenesis, brain development,
      immune response, and maintenance of telomere length. They function by binding
      to specific DNA sequences, sometimes requiring additional domains like BTB/POZ
      for their activity. The family includes proteins that interact with tumor suppressor
      pathways, influence cell cycle control, and participate in chromatin remodeling.
      Some members also have specialized functions such as regulation of meiotic recombination,
      neurogenesis, and response to genotoxic stress.
