  description:
  - text: The sigma-70 factor family is a group of bacterial initiation factors that
      facilitate the binding of RNA polymerase to specific promoter sites to initiate
      transcription. Members of the family are involved in various regulatory processes,
      such as heat shock response, sporulation, and cell differentiation. Sigma factors
      recognize and bind to consensus sequences in the promoters, with each subfamily
      typically directing the transcription of a distinct set of genes. For example,
      the RpoH subfamily regulates heat shock genes, while other subfamilies are responsible
      for sporulation-specific genes or fruiting body formation. The sigma factors
      are released from the RNA polymerase after initiation, allowing the core enzyme
      to proceed with transcription elongation.
