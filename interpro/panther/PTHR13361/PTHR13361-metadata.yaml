    name: Fibronectin-binding and WW domain-binding protein
    short: Fn-binding/WW-domain-binding
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes bacterial fibronectin-binding proteins
      and eukaryotic WW domain-binding proteins. The bacterial members are involved
      in adherence to host tissues, promoting bacterial attachment to various substrates
      including fibronectin, fibrinogen, and elastin, which facilitates the invasion
      of endothelial cells and aggregation of activated platelets, contributing to
      virulence. The eukaryotic members are implicated in pre-mRNA splicing regulation,
      with potential additional roles in inhibiting phosphatase activity. Together,
      these proteins play crucial roles in cellular processes related to infection
      and gene expression regulation.
