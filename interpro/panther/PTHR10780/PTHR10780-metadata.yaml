    name: Mitochondrial Carrier Homolog
    short: MitoCarrier_Homolog
  description:
  - text: The Mitochondrial carrier homolog family is involved in the insertion of
      transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial outer membrane, specifically targeting
      proteins with alpha-helical transmembrane regions, including signal-anchored,
      tail-anchored, and multi-pass membrane proteins, while excluding beta-barrel
      transmembrane proteins. Members of the family also serve as receptors for truncated
      pro-apoptotic proteins, playing a critical role in apoptosis. Additionally,
      they regulate the quiescence and cycling of hematopoietic stem cells, are essential
      for mitochondrial fusion, and are involved in the naive-to-primed interconversion
      of embryonic stem cells. The family also has a regulatory role in lipid homeostasis
      and adipocyte differentiation and biology.
