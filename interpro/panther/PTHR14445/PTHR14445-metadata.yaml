  description:
  - text: The GIGYF family proteins are involved in the regulation of translation
      initiation and mRNA decay. They are key components of the 4EHP-GYF2 complex,
      which represses translation initiation by sequestering the mRNA cap, thus blocking
      ribosome initiation and reducing the translational load on problematic messages.
      This complex also links translation repression with mRNA decay by recruiting
      decapping effector proteins and the deadenylation CCR4-NOT complex. GIGYF proteins
      may cooperate with GRB10 to modulate tyrosine kinase receptor signaling, including
      IGF1 and insulin receptors. They are implicated in ribosome-associated quality
      control (RQC) by sequestering faulty mRNA, working downstream of ZNF598. Additionally,
      GIGYF proteins are involved in cellular responses to stress, such as starvation-induced
      autophagy, and play a role in maintaining tissue homeostasis. In the context
      of viral infection, GIGYF proteins can affect the translation of genes involved
      in the antiviral immune response.
