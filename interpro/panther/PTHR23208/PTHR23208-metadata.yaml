  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is characterized by glycosyl hydrolase activity,
      specifically within the glycosyl hydrolase 25 family. Members of this family
      are involved in various biological processes, including the stress response
      to heavy metals, limiting the size of multicellular structures during aggregation,
      and providing resistance to bacterial infections. Some proteins in this family
      have been noted to have antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria
      and are implicated in the immune response to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
      bacterial infections. Additionally, a role in fungal defense has been suggested
      for some members. The functions of these proteins seem to be diverse, ranging
      from enzymatic activity to involvement in cellular and organismal defense mechanisms.
