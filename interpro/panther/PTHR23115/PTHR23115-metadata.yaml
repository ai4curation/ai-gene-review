    name: Translation factor GTPase superfamily members
    short: TRAFAC_GTPase_members
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes GTPases involved in various cellular processes,
      such as translation elongation, where they bind aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes,
      and translation termination, where they interact with release factors to mediate
      the end of protein synthesis. Some members are involved in the recognition and
      disassembly of stalled ribosomes, triggering mRNA decay pathways. Others participate
      in sulfur assimilation by catalyzing the adenylation of sulfate to produce adenosine
      5'-phosphosulfate. They are part of the TRAFAC class translation factor GTPase
      superfamily and exhibit diverse functions across different biological contexts.
