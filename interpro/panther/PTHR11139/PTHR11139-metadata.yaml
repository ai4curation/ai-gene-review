    name: DNA Damage Response and Repair Kinase
    short: DDR_Repair_Kinase
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes serine/threonine kinases that play crucial
      roles in cellular responses to DNA damage and stress. They are involved in checkpoint
      signaling, DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and maintenance of genomic stability.
      Members of this family are known to activate various substrates, including those
      involved in DNA replication, mitosis, and apoptosis. They often recognize a
      consensus sequence for substrate phosphorylation and can phosphorylate histone
      variants at sites of DNA damage, contributing to the DNA damage response mechanism.
      Some family members also participate in mRNA surveillance pathways, regulating
      nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Additionally, they are implicated in processes
      such as ribosome assembly, transcription modulation, and innate immune responses.
