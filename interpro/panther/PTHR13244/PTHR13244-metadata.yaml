  description:
  - text: The ZMYND10 family is implicated in the organization and motility of axonemal
      structures, which are essential components of cilia. Family members play a crucial
      role in the pre-assembly of inner and outer dynein arms, which are necessary
      for the proper construction of the axoneme, the core structure of cilia responsible
      for their motility. Through these functions, the ZMYND10 family may indirectly
      influence the transcription of dynein proteins, thereby regulating ciliary movement.
