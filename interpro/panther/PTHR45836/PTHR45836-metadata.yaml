  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that are involved in various cellular
      and developmental processes, such as neural progenitor proliferation, brain
      neocortex expansion, and axonal guidance. They function by modulating the Notch
      signaling pathway, which influences cell fate determination, differentiation,
      proliferation, and apoptosis. Some family members interact with membrane-bound
      ligands and receptors to activate transcriptional activator complexes, while
      others act as molecular guidance cues for cellular migration by interacting
      with roundabout homolog receptors. They are implicated in neural development,
      bone remodeling, and leukocyte migration, and may also play roles in axon navigation,
      midline guidance in the forebrain, and neuronal cell migration.
