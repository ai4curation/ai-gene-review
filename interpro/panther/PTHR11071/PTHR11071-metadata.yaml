  description:
  - text: The cyclophilin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) family
      is involved in protein folding and assembly by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization
      of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides. Members of this family are
      implicated in various cellular processes, including pre-mRNA splicing, regulation
      of transcription, and signal transduction. Some isoforms are involved in mitochondrial
      functions, such as the regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition
      pore, and may have roles in apoptosis and necrosis. Certain members also exhibit
      RNA-binding activity and may interact with steroid receptors, contributing to
      receptor activity control. The family includes both active and probable inactive
      PPIases, and some members are known to bind cyclosporin A, which inhibits their
      isomerase activity.
