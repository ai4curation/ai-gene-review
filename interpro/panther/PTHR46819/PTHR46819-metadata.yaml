    name: Mitochondrial Rho GTPase/EF-hand domain-containing protein
    short: Miro-EF-hand_domain
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes mitochondrial Rho GTPases and EF-hand calcium-binding
      domain-containing proteins. The mitochondrial Rho GTPases are involved in the
      regulation of mitochondrial morphology, distribution, and development, playing
      crucial roles in cell division, gamete development, and pollen tube growth.
      They may also participate in calcium signaling during stress responses. The
      EF-hand calcium-binding domain-containing proteins are components of the EvC
      complex, which is essential for ciliary Hedgehog signaling and is necessary
      for the proper localization of the EVC2:EVC subcomplex at the base of primary
      cilia.
