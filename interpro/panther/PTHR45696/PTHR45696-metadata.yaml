  description:
  - text: The eukaryotic ribosomal protein P1/P2 family is involved in protein synthesis
      within the cell. Members of the family form part of the ribosomal stalk, which
      is essential for the interaction of the ribosome with GTP-bound translation
      factors during the elongation step of protein synthesis. The ribosome is a large
      ribonucleoprotein complex that translates mRNA into polypeptide chains. The
      small ribosomal subunit (SSU) binds mRNAs, while the large subunit (LSU) contains
      the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) that catalyzes peptide bond formation.
      The nascent polypeptides exit the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and undergo
      further processing, targeting, and membrane insertion. The ribosomal protein
      P1/P2 family enhances the GTPase activity of elongation factors, increasing
      translation efficiency.
