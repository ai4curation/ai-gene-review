  description:
  - text: The BEACH domain-containing protein family is involved in a variety of cellular
      processes, including signal transduction, vesicle trafficking, membrane trafficking,
      and organelle organization. Members of this family play roles in polarized secretion,
      phagophore growth during mitophagy, coupling of TNF receptors to sphingomyelinase
      for ceramide production, and regulation of protein kinase A anchoring. They
      are also implicated in thrombopoiesis, development of immune effector molecules,
      and regulation of endosomal and lysosomal trafficking. This includes sorting
      of endosomal proteins, regulation of lysosome-related organelles, autophagosome
      maturation, and phagosome maturation in immune cells. Additionally, they may
      participate in plant effector triggered immunity, negative regulation of lysosome
      biogenesis, and cell fate determination in various organisms.
