    short: PDI
  description:
  - text: The Protein Disulfide-Isomerase (PDI) family is involved in the catalysis
      of the formation, isomerization, and reduction or oxidation of disulfide bonds
      in client proteins, functioning as a protein folding chaperone. Members of the
      PDI family play a crucial role in the folding of proteins containing disulfide
      bonds and are implicated in various cellular processes including glycosylation,
      prolyl hydroxylation, and triglyceride transfer. Some PDIs are also involved
      in hormone biogenesis, acting as structural subunits of enzymes, and in adaptive
      immunity by assisting in the assembly of the major histocompatibility complex
      class I (MHC I) with antigens. Certain PDIs have additional specialized functions,
      such as modulating cellular levels of estrogens, acting as estrogen-binding
      proteins, or serving as redox-inactive chaperones in spermatogenesis.
