    name: V-ATPase proteolipid subunit
    short: V-ATPase_proteolipid
  description:
  - text: The V-ATPase proteolipid subunit family consists of proton-conducting pore-forming
      subunits that are integral to the V0 complex of the vacuolar(H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase)
      enzyme. V-ATPase is a multisubunit complex with a peripheral V1 complex for
      ATP hydrolysis and a membrane-integrated V0 complex for proton translocation.
      The family plays a critical role in acidifying various intracellular compartments
      across eukaryotic organisms. In some cell types, these subunits are also present
      on the plasma membrane, contributing to the acidification of the extracellular
      environment. The activity of the V-ATPase proteolipid subunits is essential
      for processes such as protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and
      cellular ion homeostasis. Additionally, they are involved in specialized functions
      like sperm-triggered oocyte maturation and necrotic cell death in certain species.
