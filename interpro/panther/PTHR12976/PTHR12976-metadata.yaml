  description:
  - text: The PDE6D/unc-119 family is characterized by its role in modulating the
      activity and subcellular localization of prenylated or palmitoylated proteins,
      particularly within the Ras family. Members of the family function as GTP specific
      dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), significantly enhancing the affinity of ARL3
      for GTP and stabilizing ARL3-GTP by reducing nucleotide dissociation rates.
      They are essential for the correct ciliary targeting of farnesylated proteins
      such as INPP5E. The family contributes to the release of prenylated target proteins
      from cellular membranes, thereby influencing various cellular processes.
