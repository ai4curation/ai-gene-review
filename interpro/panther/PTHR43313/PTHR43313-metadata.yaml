  description:
  - text: The short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) family is a group of NAD(P)-dependent
      oxidoreductases with broad substrate specificity, including steroids, retinoids,
      and other small molecules. Members of the SDR family are involved in various
      biological processes such as steroid hormone metabolism, retinol oxidation,
      and the biosynthesis of signaling molecules. They play roles in regulating biological
      potency of steroids, visual cycle, immune cell migration, reproductive growth,
      and protecting against excessive hormone exposure. Some family members also
      exhibit activity towards ketosteroids, hydroxysteroids, and alcohols, contributing
      to the balance of active and inactive forms of these compounds.
