    name: Bacterial Secretion and Pilus Assembly ATPases
    short: Bact_Secr-Pilus_ATPases
  description:
  - text: The GSP E family proteins are primarily involved in the assembly and operation
      of bacterial secretion systems and pilus structures. They function as ATPases,
      providing the necessary energy for the secretion of extracellular factors like
      proteases and toxins, as well as for the assembly of pili, which are filamentous
      structures on the bacterial surface. These pili play critical roles in processes
      such as DNA uptake during competence, surface and host cell adhesion, colonization,
      biofilm formation, virulence, and twitching motility. Some family members are
      also implicated in the translocation of pilin proteins and may regulate the
      extension and retraction of pili, influencing bacterial transformation and adhesion
      capabilities.
