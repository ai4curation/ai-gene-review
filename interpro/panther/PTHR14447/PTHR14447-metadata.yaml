  description:
  - text: The Urotensin-2 family comprises peptides known for their role in vasoconstriction,
      making them highly potent vasoconstrictors. Additionally, members of this family
      have been implicated in various physiological processes such as osmoregulation
      and may act as corticotropin-releasing factors. In teleost fish, urotensin peptides
      are part of the caudal neurosecretory system, suggesting a role in the regulation
      of water and salt balance. Some precursors of urotensin peptides may also function
      as urotensin binding proteins, known as urophysins, which could be involved
      in the peptide's signaling pathways or stability.
