  description:
  - text: The Sodium/Solute Symporter (SSF) family is involved in the active transport
      of various sugars and myo-inositol across the plasma membrane, utilizing a Na+
      electrochemical gradient. Members of this family play critical roles in nutrient
      absorption, osmoregulation, and cell signaling. They transport substrates like
      D-glucose, D-galactose, D-mannose, D-fructose, and myo-inositol with varying
      Na+ to sugar stoichiometries. Some members also function as glucose sensors,
      influencing incretin secretion and energy homeostasis. The family includes transporters
      with diverse regulatory mechanisms, such as insulin and phlorizin sensitivity,
      and associations with ion channels that modulate their activity. These transporters
      are essential in physiological processes such as renal glucose reabsorption,
      intestinal nutrient uptake, and maintenance of fluid balance in the central
      nervous system.
