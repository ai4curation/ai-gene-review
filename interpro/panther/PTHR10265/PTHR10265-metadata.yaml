    short: CDK_inhibitor
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases
      (CDKs), which are key regulators of cell cycle progression. Members of this
      family are involved in the inhibition of CDK2 when bound to cyclin A, and they
      exhibit varying effects on CDK2 bound to SPDYA. These proteins are crucial for
      inducing G1 arrest and act as potent inhibitors of cyclin E- and cyclin A-CDK2
      complexes. They also interact with cyclin type D-CDK4 complexes, contributing
      to their assembly, stability, and modulation of activation. Depending on their
      phosphorylation state and stoichiometry, they can function as either inhibitors
      or activators of these complexes. Additionally, some members are involved in
      maintaining cells in a non-proliferative state, playing a role in cell cycle
      suspension in specific developmental stages or conditions.
