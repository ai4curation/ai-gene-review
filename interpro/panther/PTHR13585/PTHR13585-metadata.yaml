    name: N6-methyladenosine RNA Methylation Regulator
    short: m6A_RNA_Methylation_Regulator
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes components involved in the post-transcriptional
      modification of RNA, specifically through N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation.
      Members of this family play a crucial role in the efficiency of mRNA splicing
      and RNA processing. They are key regulators of m6A methylation, particularly
      influencing the modification of mRNAs at the 3'-UTR. These proteins are also
      implicated in maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells by modulating
      m6A methylation levels. Additionally, they are essential for the assembly and
      nuclear localization of certain RNA-modifying complexes, serving as a scaffold
      for other components and facilitating interactions with RNA-binding proteins.
