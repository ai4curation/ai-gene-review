  description:
  - text: The ITIH family proteins are involved in various biological processes, primarily
      acting as carriers or binding proteins for hyaluronan in serum. They play a
      crucial role in regulating the localization, synthesis, and degradation of hyaluronan,
      which is essential for cells during biological processes. Some members of the
      family are known to function as type II acute-phase proteins (APPs) that respond
      to inflammatory trauma and may contribute to liver development or regeneration.
      Additionally, certain ITIH family members have been implicated in tumor suppression,
      suggesting a potential role in cancer biology.
