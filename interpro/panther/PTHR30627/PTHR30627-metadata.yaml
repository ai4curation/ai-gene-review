  description:
  - text: The protein family includes transpeptidases that play a crucial role in
      bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. Members of the family are involved in the
      catalysis of cross-linking peptidoglycan layers, which is essential for maintaining
      cell shape, integrity, and division. Some proteins within the family are specific
      to the division septum, while others are involved in lateral cell wall synthesis.
      The family also includes beta-lactamases, which confer resistance to beta-lactam
      antibiotics by hydrolyzing them. The transpeptidases are commonly known as penicillin-binding
      proteins (PBPs) and are targets for beta-lactam antibiotics, which inhibit their
      activity by acylating a serine residue in the active site. The beta-lactamases
      are divided into different classes, with class-D beta-lactamases being represented
      in this family. These enzymes vary in their substrate specificity and inhibition
      by various compounds. Overall, the family is characterized by its involvement
      in peptidoglycan synthesis and antibiotic resistance mechanisms.
