  description:
  - text: The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein family includes transcription
      factors that play crucial roles in various developmental processes, including
      neurogenesis, myogenesis, and the differentiation of specific cell types. Members
      of this family are characterized by their ability to bind E-box DNA sequences
      (CANNTG) and modulate gene expression. They are involved in the activation or
      repression of target genes, often through dimerization with other bHLH proteins
      or transcription factors such as TCF3/E47. These proteins contribute to the
      formation and maturation of neurons, oligodendrocytes, and other cell lineages
      by regulating the expression of genes critical for cell fate determination and
      differentiation. Some family members also participate in the maintenance of
      circadian rhythms, auditory signaling, and the development of sensory organs.
      The bHLH domain is essential for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation,
      with some members also possessing domains for repressor or activator functions.
