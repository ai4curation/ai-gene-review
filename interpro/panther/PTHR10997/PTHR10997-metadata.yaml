    name: Importin-Exportin Nuclear Transport
    short: Importin-Exportin_NT
  description:
  - text: The Importin-Exportin family is involved in the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport
      of proteins. Importins mediate the nuclear import of proteins by recognizing
      nuclear localization signals and facilitating their translocation through the
      nuclear pore complex in a Ran-GTP dependent manner. Exportins, on the other
      hand, are responsible for the nuclear export of proteins, such as importin-alpha,
      back to the cytoplasm after cargo release. Some family members also function
      in mRNA export, mitotic spindle formation, fluid homeostasis, stress responses,
      and miRNA activity regulation. The family plays a crucial role in maintaining
      the directionality of protein transport due to the asymmetric distribution of
      Ran-GTP and Ran-GDP between the nucleus and cytoplasm.
