  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the transport of solutes across cellular
      membranes. Members are characterized as putative solute transporters and are
      part of the SLC35F solute transporter family, which suggests a role in the facilitated
      or active transport of specific substrates, although the exact substrates and
      transport mechanisms may vary among family members. The function of these proteins
      is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the intracellular
      concentration of various molecules.
