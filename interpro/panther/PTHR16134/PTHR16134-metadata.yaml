    name: SCF Complex F-box/LRR-repeat Domain-containing Protein
    short: SCF_F-box/LRR-repeat
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins functions as components of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box)
      E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which are involved in the ubiquitination and
      proteasomal degradation of target proteins. These proteins play a critical role
      in various cellular processes including cell cycle progression, signal transduction,
      transcription, and plant defense responses. They are characterized by the presence
      of an F-box domain, which is essential for interaction with other components
      of the SCF complex, and in many cases, additional leucine-rich repeat (LRR)
      domains that are involved in protein-protein interactions. Some members of this
      family are also involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, auxin-mediated
      signaling, jasmonate signaling, and embryogenesis.
