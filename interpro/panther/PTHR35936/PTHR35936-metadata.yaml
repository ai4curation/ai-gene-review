    name: Membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase F
    short: MltF
  description:
  - text: The protein family includes membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase
      F enzymes, which play a crucial role in bacterial cell wall metabolism. These
      enzymes degrade murein glycan strands and high-molecular weight murein sacculi,
      producing a 1,6-anhydromuramoyl product. This action is essential for the maintenance
      and expansion of the peptidoglycan sacculus, a major component of the bacterial
      cell wall that provides structural integrity. By creating space within the peptidoglycan
      sacculus, these enzymes facilitate the insertion of cellular structures such
      as secretion systems and flagella, and allow for the expansion of the cell wall
      during growth and division. The family's proteins typically have a bi-domain
      architecture with an N-terminal domain that modulates enzymatic activity and
      a C-terminal catalytic active domain. Some members of the family are also involved
      in amino acid transport, indicating a dual function in both cell wall metabolism
      and nutrient uptake.
