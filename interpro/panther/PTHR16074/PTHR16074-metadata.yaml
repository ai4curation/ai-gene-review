  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the structure and function of primary
      cilia. Members of this family are components of the BBSome complex, which is
      necessary for ciliogenesis and the sorting of specific membrane proteins to
      cilia. The complex interacts with the Rab8 GDP/GTP exchange factor at the basal
      body, facilitating the entry of Rab8(GTP) into the cilium and the extension
      of the ciliary membrane. The BBSome complex binds to the guanosyl exchange factor
      RAB3IP/Rabin8, which activates Rab8, leading to the docking and fusion of carrier
      vesicles at the ciliary base. Additionally, the complex plays a role in the
      sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway by controlling SMO ciliary trafficking.
      It is essential for the proper assembly of the BBSome complex and its localization
      to cilia, but it is not required for centriolar satellite function. In certain
      organisms, it is also involved in the assembly and movement of intraflagellar
      transport proteins, the removal of degraded mechanosensory receptors within
      cilia, and the localization of guanylyl cyclase in sensory neurons.
