  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes enzymes that catalyze the oxidative deamination
      of various L-amino acids, producing hydrogen peroxide and other byproducts.
      Members of this family exhibit a range of biological activities, such as antibacterial,
      antiparasitic, and cytotoxic effects against cancer cell lines. Some are involved
      in the regulation of polyamine intracellular concentration and may play roles
      in immune regulation by affecting T-cell activation and differentiation. They
      are also implicated in epigenetic regulation through histone demethylation,
      influencing transcriptional activation or repression. The family includes L-amino
      acid oxidases with diverse substrate specificities, polyamine oxidases, and
      lysine-specific histone demethylases, among others.
