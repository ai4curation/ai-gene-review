  description:
  - text: This family of proteins serves as scaffold subunits within various histone
      acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, playing a crucial role in the regulation
      of gene expression through histone modification. Members of this family are
      involved in directing the specificity of HAT complexes towards particular lysine
      residues on histones H3 and H4, facilitating acetylation at these sites. This
      modification is key to the activation of replication origins and the transcriptional
      activation of genes throughout development. Some family members also possess
      histone methyltransferase activity, contributing to the epigenetic transcriptional
      activation by methylation of histone H3 lysine residues. Additionally, these
      proteins are implicated in several cellular processes including DNA replication
      initiation, apoptosis, tumor suppression, and the regulation of signaling pathways.
      The ubiquitin ligase activity of certain members further extends the family's
      role in protein post-translational modification and turnover.
