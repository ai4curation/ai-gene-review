  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes enzymes that catalyze the decarboxylative
      condensation of pimeloyl-[acyl-carrier protein] and L-alanine to produce 8-amino-7-oxononanoate
      (AON), a precursor in the biotin biosynthesis pathway. Members of this family
      are pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent and share a common fold typical of
      class-II aminotransferases. The enzymes are involved in key metabolic processes,
      including the synthesis of sphingolipids and the formation of aminolevulinic
      acid, which is the first step in the biosynthesis of heme. Some family members
      also have broader substrate specificity and may participate in additional biochemical
      pathways.
