  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes enzymes that are involved in the salvage
      pathways of nucleotide synthesis. They catalyze the phosphorylation of nucleosides
      to their corresponding nucleotides, which are essential for DNA and RNA synthesis.
      Some members are known to be regulated by allosteric mechanisms and are subject
      to feedback inhibition. The family also includes proteins that may have a role
      in cellular stress responses, membrane assembly, and regulation of defense responses
      in plants. The activities of these enzymes are crucial for maintaining the nucleotide
      pool balance within the cell and for the proper functioning of cellular metabolism.
