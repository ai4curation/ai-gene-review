    name: AB Hydrolase Superfamily Lipase
    short: AB_hydrolase_lipase
  description:
  - text: The AB hydrolase superfamily lipase family encompasses enzymes with diverse
      functions, including the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols to free fatty acids
      and glycerol, the breakdown of cholesteryl esters, and the regulation of lipid
      metabolism in various biological contexts. Members of this family are involved
      in lipid digestion, keratinocyte differentiation, sterol homeostasis, and the
      response to nutrient availability. Some exhibit specificity for certain lipid
      substrates and may play roles in processes such as lipophagy, autophagy, and
      the extension of lifespan under nutrient-deprived conditions. The family includes
      gastric and lysosomal lipases, sterol esterases, and lipases with specific roles
      in seed germination, epidermal differentiation, and mitochondrial lipid composition
      regulation.
