  description:
  - text: The HtrA family of serine proteases is characterized by a trypsin-like protease
      domain and often a PDZ domain that may be involved in substrate recognition
      or protein-protein interactions. Members of the family are involved in various
      cellular processes, including protein quality control by degrading misfolded
      or damaged proteins, regulating cell death pathways, and modulating signaling
      pathways such as TGF-beta signaling. They act in different cellular compartments,
      such as the periplasm in bacteria where they handle stress-induced unfolded
      proteins, and mitochondria in eukaryotes where they can promote apoptosis. Some
      members also play roles in the development and differentiation processes by
      processing extracellular matrix components and growth factors.
