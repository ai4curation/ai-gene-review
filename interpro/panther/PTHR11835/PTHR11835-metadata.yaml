  description:
  - text: The Isocitrate and Isopropylmalate Dehydrogenases family includes enzymes
      that play crucial roles in central metabolic pathways. The family's members
      are involved in the citric acid cycle, catalyzing the decarboxylation of isocitrate
      to alpha-ketoglutarate, a key step in energy production. Some members also participate
      in the biosynthesis of amino acids, such as leucine, by oxidizing 3-isopropylmalate.
      Additionally, certain isozymes regulate the citric acid cycle through allosteric
      mechanisms, responding to cellular energy levels by binding molecules like citrate,
      ADP, and ATP. This regulation ensures the proper balance between catabolic and
      anabolic processes. The family also includes homoisocitrate dehydrogenases involved
      in lysine biosynthesis through the alpha-aminoadipate pathway. Overall, the
      Isocitrate and Isopropylmalate Dehydrogenases family encompasses a diverse group
      of enzymes essential for cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis.
