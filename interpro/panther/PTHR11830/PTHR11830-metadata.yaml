  description:
  - text: The eukaryotic ribosomal protein eS1 family is involved in the assembly
      and function of the small ribosomal subunit, which is essential for protein
      synthesis. Members of this family associate with pre-rRNA in the nucleolus,
      contributing to RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements, and cleavage, as
      well as targeted degradation by the RNA exosome. They play roles in cell survival,
      proliferation, differentiation, and erythropoiesis. Some members are essential
      for oogenesis and follicle cell development. The family also includes variants
      with specialized functions in different organisms.
