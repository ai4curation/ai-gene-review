  description:
  - text: 'This protein family comprises small proteins that appear to participate
      in diverse biological processes ranging from secondary metabolism to environmental
      response modulation [PMID:18922149], [PMID:29743477]. They include members with
      Bet v1‐like domains that may be involved in structural modifications during
      metabolite biosynthesis [PMID:18922149], [PMID:29743477] and homologues that
      facilitate methanol oxidation by promoting interactions within enzyme complexes
      [PMID:32728125]. Several members also exhibit roles in adaptation to specific
      environmental conditions, such as hyperosmotic stress and host‐associated niches
      [PMID:32205462]. In addition, a subset is implicated in the production of toxin‐like
      compounds that may enhance microbial competitiveness under nutrient‐limited
      or stressful conditions [PMID:22529937], [PMID:22251433]. Overall, the family
      appears to consist of proteins with distinct but complementary functionalities
      that contribute to metabolic regulation and environmental response in different
      microbial contexts [PMID:18922149], [PMID:32728125].
