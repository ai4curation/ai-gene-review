  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes a diverse range of functions, primarily
      associated with cellular signaling and regulation. Members are involved in innate
      immunity, acting as regulators of Toll-like receptor signaling pathways, and
      contributing to inflammatory responses. Some proteins within the family function
      as GTP-binding proteins, while others are involved in the MAPK pathway activation,
      acting as Ras effectors. The family also includes proteins that participate
      in the regulation of cell volume through the volume-regulated anion channel
      (VRAC), mediating ion transport in response to osmotic changes. Additionally,
      there are proteins that play roles in apoptosis, cell survival, and ubiquitination
      processes. The proteins are characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat
      (LRR) domains, which are typically involved in protein-protein interactions
      and may contribute to the diverse functional roles of the family.
