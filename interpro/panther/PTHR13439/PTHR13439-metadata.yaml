  description:
  - text: The TLCD family proteins are involved in the regulation of plasma membrane
      composition and fluidity. They inhibit the incorporation of membrane-fluidizing
      phospholipids containing omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA),
      promoting membrane rigidity. Some family members, known as ceramide synthases,
      are involved in ceramide synthesis, which may affect processes like adipogenesis
      and cell proliferation during neuronal differentiation. The family also includes
      proteins that could play a role in protection against cell death.
