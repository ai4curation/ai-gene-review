  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the cellular process of autophagy,
      which is the degradation and recycling of cellular components. Members of this
      family play a role in various stages of autophagy, including the maturation
      of autophagosomes into autolysosomes, the clearance of autophagosomal cargo,
      and the degradation of protein aggregates within autophagosomes. Some proteins
      in this family are essential for starvation-induced autophagy and omegasome
      development. Additionally, certain members have a key role in the immune response,
      particularly in the recognition of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides from pathogens
      and the subsequent activation of the TLR9 signaling pathway. This involves the
      translocation of CpG dinucleotides to the lysosome, where TLR9 is located, triggering
      innate and adaptive immune responses.
