  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton
      dynamics. Members of this family are known to nucleate and elongate nonbranched
      actin filaments, which are crucial for various cellular processes including
      cell shape maintenance, cell elongation, and intracellular transport. They are
      characterized by the presence of FH1 and FH2 domains, with the latter being
      directly involved in actin assembly. These proteins are regulated by autoinhibitory
      interactions between the DAD and GBD/FH3 domains, which are relieved upon binding
      of activated GTPases, thus triggering actin nucleation activity. Some family
      members also interact with Rho GTPases and may be involved in stress fiber formation
      and plasma membrane blebbing, indicating a role in cellular response to stress
      and morphological changes.
