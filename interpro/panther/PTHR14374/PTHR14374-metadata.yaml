  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the early stages of trafficking from
      the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Members of this family play
      a crucial role in the transport of proteins and other molecules between these
      two essential cellular organelles, which is vital for maintaining cellular function
      and homeostasis.
