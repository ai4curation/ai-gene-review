  description:
  - text: The small Tim family is involved in the mitochondrial import and insertion
      of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane.
      Members of this family act as intermembrane chaperones, guiding hydrophobic
      precursors through the mitochondrial intermembrane space and preventing their
      aggregation. They are essential for the transfer of beta-barrel precursors from
      the TOM complex to the SAM complex of the outer membrane. The twin CX3C motif,
      with conserved Cys residues forming disulfide bonds or coordinating zinc, is
      critical during transit from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrion, preventing
      premature folding.
