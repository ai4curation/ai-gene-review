    name: Clathrin heavy chain
    short: Clathrin_HC
  description:
  - text: The clathrin heavy chain family is central to the formation of coated pits
      and vesicles, which are pivotal in the process of endocytosis. Clathrin molecules
      form a triskelion shape that assembles into a polyhedral lattice around vesicles,
      facilitating cargo selection and transport. The N-terminal domain of clathrin
      heavy chains features a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, important for
      protein-protein interactions. The C-terminal domain includes a trimerization
      domain and a light-chain binding domain, essential for the formation of the
      clathrin coat. Members of the family are involved in various cellular processes,
      including the retention of proteins in intracellular compartments, polar distribution
      of transporters, stabilization of kinetochore fibers during mitosis, and early
      autophagosome formation.
