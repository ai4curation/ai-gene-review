    short: Tectonic-like_complex_comp
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes components of the tectonic-like complex,
      which is localized at the transition zone of primary cilia. These proteins play
      a crucial role in maintaining the ciliary structure and are essential for ciliogenesis.
      They act as a barrier to prevent the diffusion of transmembrane proteins between
      the cilia and plasma membranes. Additionally, they are involved in the sonic
      hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, which is important for developmental processes.
