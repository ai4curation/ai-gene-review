  description:
  - text: The protein family is characterized by histone-lysine N-methyltransferase
      activity, with members specifically methylating lysine residues on histones,
      such as 'Lys-4' of histone H3 and 'Lys-5' of histone H4. These modifications
      play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation, chromatin organization, and
      epigenetic signaling. Some family members also methylate non-histone proteins,
      including p53/TP53 and RB1, influencing their DNA-binding and transcriptional
      regulation activities. The family is involved in various biological processes,
      including transcriptional activation, cardiomyocyte differentiation, cardiac
      morphogenesis, lifespan modulation, and oxidative stress resistance. Members
      of the family typically interact with HSP90alpha for enhanced activity and are
      part of the class V-like SAM-binding methyltransferase superfamily.
