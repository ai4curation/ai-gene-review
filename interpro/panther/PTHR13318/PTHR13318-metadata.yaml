  description:
  - text: The F-box/LRR-repeat protein family is involved in various cellular processes
      through its role as a substrate recognition component of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box
      protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes. These proteins mediate the ubiquitination
      and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, regulating pathways
      such as the BMP signaling, iron homeostasis, mitotic exit, and DNA damage response.
      Some family members act as sensors for oxygen and iron levels, while others
      are involved in cell cycle checkpoints, copper sensitivity, ethylene signaling,
      and neural transmission. They play roles in pattern formation, bone mass maintenance,
      and the regulation of inflammation and autophagy.
