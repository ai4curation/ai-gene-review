    name: Chromosome-partitioning and nucleoid occlusion protein
    short: Chromosome_partition/occlusion
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the process of chromosome partitioning
      and cell division. Members of this family are known to bind to DNA at the origin
      of replication and localize to the cell poles following DNA replication completion.
      They play a crucial role in ensuring proper chromosome segregation by preventing
      the formation of the division machinery over the nucleoid, a process known as
      nucleoid occlusion. This function is particularly important under conditions
      that disturb the cell cycle, as it helps to coordinate cell division and chromosome
      segregation, thus preventing chromosome breakage. Some members of this family
      may also be involved in plasmid DNA partitioning, indicating a broader role
      in genetic material maintenance and stability.
