  description:
  - text: The beta/gamma-crystallin family comprises proteins that are primarily known
      as the dominant structural components of the vertebrate eye lens. These proteins
      are characterized by a two-domain beta-structure, which is folded into four
      highly similar Greek key motifs. The crystallins in this family contribute to
      the transparency and refractive properties of the lens, essential for proper
      vision. Some members of the family may also have roles beyond the eye lens,
      as suggested by their presence in other tissues and involvement in processes
      such as the integrity and function of auditory nuclei.
