  description:
  - text: The Amyloid-beta A4 precursor protein-binding family is involved in synaptic
      vesicle exocytosis and modulation of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) processing,
      potentially affecting APP-beta formation. Members of the family interact with
      essential components of the synaptic vesicle exocytotic machinery, such as STXBP1
      and Munc18-1. They contain a phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PID/PTB) for binding
      the cytoplasmic domain of APP and PDZ domains for membrane attachment. Some
      members also participate in vesicular trafficking and may influence the activity
      of transcription factors and receptors, contributing to processes like cell
      migration, proliferation, and cell cycle progression in various cell types.
      The family includes proteins that may enhance HIF1A activity in macrophages
      and are involved in exosome biogenesis and tumorigenesis.
