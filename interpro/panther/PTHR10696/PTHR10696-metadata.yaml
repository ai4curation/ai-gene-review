  description:
  - text: The protein family includes alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that
      catalyze hydroxylation reactions in various metabolic pathways. Members are
      involved in the degradation of lysine through a pathway that includes cadaverine
      and glutarate, converting glutarate to L-2-hydroxyglutarate. Other family members
      hydroxylate trimethyllysine to hydroxytrimethyllysine, a step in carnitine biosynthesis.
      Additionally, some enzymes contribute to antibiotic biosynthesis, such as clavaminate
      synthase, or participate in the synthesis of other specialized metabolites like
      hapalindole-type alkaloids. The family also includes enzymes that hydroxylate
      or oxidize unique substrates like tyrosine isonitrile, uridine-5'-phosphate,
      and enduracididine. These enzymes are characterized by their requirement for
      iron and alpha-ketoglutarate as co-substrates and are involved in diverse biological
      processes, including amino acid metabolism, secondary metabolite biosynthesis,
      and post-translational modifications.
