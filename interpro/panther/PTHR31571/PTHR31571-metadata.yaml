    short: HAT_RTT109-like
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes histone acetyltransferases, such as RTT109,
      which are known to acetylate lysine residues on histone H3. This modification
      plays a crucial role in nucleosome assembly, genomic stability, DNA repair,
      and transcriptional regulation during the S-phase of the cell cycle. The acetylation
      of specific lysine residues, such as 'Lys-56', weakens the interaction between
      the histone core and DNA, facilitating chromatin disassembly. Some family members
      are also capable of autoacetylation and may interact with histone chaperones
      to influence their substrate specificity.
