  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in various RNA-related processes, including
      alternative splicing, mRNA transport, localization, and stability. Members of
      this family typically contain one or more KH domains, which are known for their
      role in binding RNA. These proteins are implicated in the regulation of gene
      expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. They may
      act as activators or repressors of transcription and are also involved in the
      cellular response to stress and in developmental processes. Some members preferentially
      bind to N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modified mRNAs, influencing their stability
      and translation. The family includes proteins that function in neuronal development,
      cell migration, and the stress response, highlighting their diverse roles in
      cellular physiology.
