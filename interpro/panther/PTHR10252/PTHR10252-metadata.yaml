  description:
  - text: The protein family is involved in various aspects of transcriptional regulation
      and DNA replication. Members of the family function as components of larger
      complexes that interact with DNA and transcription factors to modulate gene
      expression. Some members recognize specific DNA motifs, such as the CCAAT box,
      and are involved in the activation or repression of gene transcription. Others
      participate in chromosomal DNA replication, contributing to the synthesis of
      DNA strands and ensuring replication fidelity through proofreading exonuclease
      activity. The family also includes proteins that regulate the accessibility
      of chromatin by promoting nucleosome sliding, thus facilitating transcription
      and DNA repair. Overall, the family plays critical roles in maintaining cellular
      functions by regulating the expression of genes and ensuring the accurate replication
      of the genome.
