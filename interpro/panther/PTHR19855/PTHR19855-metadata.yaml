    name: WD repeat-containing protein WDR12/YTM1
    short: WDR12/YTM1
  description:
  - text: The WDR12/YTM1 protein family is primarily involved in ribosome biogenesis,
      specifically in the maturation of ribosomal RNAs and the formation of the large
      ribosomal subunit. Members of this family are components of complexes such as
      the NOP7 complex in yeast and the PeBoW complex in higher eukaryotes, which
      are essential for the processing of the 25S, 5.8S, and 28S ribosomal RNAs. This
      is a critical step in the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit. The family
      is characterized by the presence of WD repeats, which are known to mediate protein-protein
      interactions. Some members of the family, such as WDR37, have distinct functions
      like ER Ca2+ handling in lymphocytes, indicating a potential for functional
      diversity within the family.
