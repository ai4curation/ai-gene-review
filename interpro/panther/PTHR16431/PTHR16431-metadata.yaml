  description:
  - text: The Mis18 family is involved in crucial processes during cell division.
      Members of the family are essential for the correct recruitment of CENPA, a
      variant of histone H3, to centromeres, which is a key step in the assembly of
      functional kinetochores. This recruitment is necessary for proper chromosome
      segregation during mitosis. The Mis18 family maintains the integrity of mitotic
      spindles by ensuring the presence and function of kinetochore factors and contributes
      to the maintenance of specific histone deacetylation states at centromeres,
      which is important for chromosomal stability.
