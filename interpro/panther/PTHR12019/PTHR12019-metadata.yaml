  description:
  - text: The LEM domain-containing protein family is associated with the nuclear
      lamina and the inner nuclear membrane, playing critical roles in maintaining
      nuclear structure, chromosome segregation, and cell division. Members of the
      family are involved in organizing the distribution of nuclear components such
      as lamins, nuclear pore complexes, and chromatin. They participate in nuclear
      envelope reformation post-mitosis and may influence DNA replication initiation.
      Some family members interact with BANF1 and are implicated in muscle cell attachment
      and sarcomere organization. The family also includes thymopoietins, which have
      immunomodulatory effects on T-cell development and function. Additionally, they
      may be involved in DNA damage repair and transcriptional regulation.
