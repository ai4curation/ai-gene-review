  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes regulatory subunits of the condensin-2
      complex, which plays a crucial role in chromosome organization during mitosis.
      Members of this family are involved in establishing the architecture of mitotic
      chromosomes and contribute to the physical rigidity of the chromatid axis. They
      are essential for proper chromosome segregation and cell division. Additionally,
      some members have been implicated in early embryonic development, with specific
      roles in the formation of head and kidney structures, as well as in the viability
      and expansion of the inner cell mass in the blastocyst.
