  description:
  - text: The NECAP family proteins are primarily involved in the process of endocytosis.
      They feature WXXF motifs, which are crucial for the binding of accessory proteins
      to the ear-domain of various adaptor complexes such as AP-1, GGAs, and AP-2.
      These interactions are mediated through hydrophobic interactions and are highly
      selective, depending on the acidic context surrounding the motif and the specific
      properties of the second residue within the motif. The selective binding to
      the GAE domains of AP-1 or the alpha-ear domain of AP-2 is a key functional
      aspect of the NECAP family, facilitating the specific interactions necessary
      for the regulation of endocytosis.
