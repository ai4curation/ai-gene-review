    name: Interferon-induced 44-like protein
    short: IFI44-like
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in immune response modulation, particularly
      in response to interferon signaling. Members of this family aggregate to form
      microtubular structures and are implicated in antiviral and antibacterial activities.
      They play a role in macrophage differentiation, inflammatory cytokine secretion,
      and the control of viral infections. Some members act as feedback regulators
      of interferon responses by interacting with kinases and other proteins to modulate
      their activity. Additionally, certain proteins within this family are associated
      with minor histocompatibility antigens, which can elicit immune responses in
      the context of tissue transplantation.
