  description:
  - text: The WW domain-binding protein family is characterized by its interaction
      with other proteins through PPxY motifs, which are known to mediate interactions
      with proteins such as WWOX and NEDD4. Members of this family are involved in
      various cellular processes, including acting as synapse-to-nucleus messengers
      that promote NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in neurons in a JUN-dependent
      manner. They are also implicated in inhibiting ubiquitination-mediated degradation,
      promoting phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of transcription factor
      JUN, and may play roles in T cell receptor signaling and apoptosis in T cells.
