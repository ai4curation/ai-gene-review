    name: Cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein COX16
    short: COX16
  description:
  - text: The COX16 family proteins are essential for the assembly of the mitochondrial
      respiratory chain complex IV, also known as cytochrome c oxidase (CIV). These
      proteins are implicated in the coordination of the assembly lines for COX1 and
      COX2 subunits of the complex. In some species, COX16 proteins are known to promote
      the insertion of copper into the active site of cytochrome c oxidase subunit
      II and interact with newly synthesized COX2 and copper center-forming metallochaperones
      SCO1, SCO2, and COA6. This suggests a role in facilitating the association of
      COX2 with the MITRAC assembly intermediate containing COX1, thereby merging
      the assembly lines of these subunits and ensuring the proper function of the
      respiratory chain.
