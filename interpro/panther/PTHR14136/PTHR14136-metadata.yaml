  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that are involved in various cellular
      processes, such as resistance to antibiotics, particularly fluoroquinolones,
      by inhibiting DNA gyrase activity. Some proteins in this family mimic B-form
      DNA, potentially protecting DNA gyrase from fluoroquinolone action. Others are
      implicated in the ubiquitination pathway, serving as substrate-specific adapters
      for E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes, leading to the proteasomal degradation
      of target proteins. Additionally, certain members are involved in the reorganization
      of host cell endosomal and lysosomal compartments during bacterial infection,
      promoting bacterial survival and virulence by recruiting kinesin-1 to the membrane
      of the Salmonella-containing vacuole and facilitating the extension of membrane
      tubules.
