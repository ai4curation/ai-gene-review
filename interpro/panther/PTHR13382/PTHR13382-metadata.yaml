  description:
  - text: The F-box/LRR-repeat protein family is involved in a variety of cellular
      processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and protein
      degradation. Members of this family function as substrate-recognition components
      of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, targeting specific
      proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This action
      is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating biological processes
      such as cell division, development, and response to stress. The family also
      includes proteins that regulate ciliary/flagellar motility, iron homeostasis,
      and inflammation. Some members are involved in meiosis and ascospore formation,
      while others play roles in neural transmission and male fertility. The diversity
      of functions reflects the versatility of the F-box/LRR-repeat proteins in modulating
      various molecular pathways.
