  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in various cellular processes including
      sporulation, mitochondrial translation, and maintenance of mitochondrial structure.
      Members are believed to play roles in meiotic nuclear division during sporulation.
      In mitochondria, they are thought to coordinate the assembly or maintenance
      of the mitochondrial ribosome, which is essential for protein synthesis within
      the organelle. Some family members are also implicated in plant growth regulation
      by affecting cell division and expansion in root meristems, as well as mediating
      abscisic acid signal transduction during seed germination and seedling growth.
