  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in ribosome biogenesis, specifically
      in the processing of pre-18S ribosomal RNA within the nucleolus. Members of
      this family are essential for the optimal transcription of pre-ribosomal RNA
      by RNA polymerase I and are components of the small subunit (SSU) processome.
      The SSU processome is the first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal
      subunit. Proteins in this family work in concert with ribosome biogenesis factors,
      RNA chaperones, and ribosomal proteins to facilitate RNA folding, modifications,
      rearrangements, and cleavage. They also contribute to the targeted degradation
      of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome, ensuring the proper assembly and function
      of ribosomes.
