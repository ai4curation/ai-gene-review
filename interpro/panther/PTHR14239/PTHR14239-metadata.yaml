    short: STEAP_metalloreductase
  description:
  - text: The STEAP family proteins are integral membrane metalloreductases that function
      as NADPH-dependent ferric-chelate reductases. They facilitate the reduction
      of Fe(3+) to Fe(2+) across cellular membranes, using NADPH to transfer electrons
      through FAD and heme groups to the iron chelate. Some family members also reduce
      Cu(2+) to Cu(1+). These proteins play roles in iron uptake, particularly in
      erythroid cells, and are involved in systemic metabolic homeostasis, linking
      inflammatory responses with metabolic processes. They may influence cell cycle
      progression and apoptosis, and are implicated in conditions such as obesity,
      insulin resistance, and inflammatory arthritis. Certain STEAP proteins, despite
      belonging to the family, lack the necessary binding sites for NADPH and do not
      function as metalloreductases on their own.
