  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins
      (snRNPs), which are essential components of the spliceosome, the complex responsible
      for the splicing of pre-mRNA. Members of this family play a crucial role in
      the assembly of the snRNP core by constraining the conformation of Sm proteins,
      ensuring the correct binding to snRNA. This process is mediated by the SMN complex,
      which facilitates the assembly of Sm proteins into a heptameric ring structure
      on the snRNA. The interaction with snRNA containing the snRNP code triggers
      the release of the SMN complex, allowing for the completion of snRNP assembly.
      These proteins are therefore key to the proper functioning of cellular mRNA
      splicing mechanisms.
