    short: Mediator_complx_sub13
  description:
  - text: The Mediator complex subunit 13 family consists of proteins that are integral
      components of the Mediator complex, a key coactivator involved in the regulated
      transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Members of the
      family function as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory
      proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. They are recruited
      to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serve as a
      scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase
      II and the general transcription factors. Some family members are part of the
      SRB8-11 complex, a regulatory module of the Mediator complex that may be involved
      in transcriptional repression of certain genes and may inhibit the association
      of the Mediator complex with RNA polymerase II. Others may regulate transcription
      of targets of specific signaling pathways such as Wnt and SHH.
