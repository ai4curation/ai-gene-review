  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in various cellular processes related
      to membrane dynamics, including endocytosis and vesicle-mediated transport.
      Members of this family typically contain an F-BAR domain that mediates membrane
      binding and tubulation, playing a crucial role in the reorganization of the
      cytoskeleton and morphogenesis of neurons. They are also involved in synaptic
      vesicle endocytosis, which is essential for neurotransmission. Some family members
      regulate the activity of enzymes and receptors by affecting their cellular localization,
      and they may also participate in cytokinesis and cell cycle regulation. Additionally,
      these proteins can interact with actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, influencing
      cell shape, migration, and signaling pathways.
