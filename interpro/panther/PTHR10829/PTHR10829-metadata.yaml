  description:
  - text: The Actin-Binding Protein 1 (ABP1) family is involved in the organization
      and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, playing a crucial role in various
      cellular processes such as cell shape maintenance, migration, neuron morphology,
      axon growth, and synapse formation. Members of the family act as adapter proteins,
      binding to F-actin and interacting with various proteins to mediate endocytosis,
      podosome rosette formation, and immunological synapse function. They are also
      implicated in the regulation of gene expression and synaptic plasticity related
      to memory. The family includes proteins that stabilize actin filaments, influence
      leukotriene synthesis, and contribute to cell surface growth organization.
