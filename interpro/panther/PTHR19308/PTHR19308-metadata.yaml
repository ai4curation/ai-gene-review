    short: START_lipid_transfer
  description:
  - text: The START domain-containing protein family is involved in the non-vesicular
      intracellular trafficking and intermembrane transfer of specific lipids. Members
      of this family can recognize and shuttle various lipid species, including ceramides,
      diacylglycerol lipids, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidyethanolamine. The
      START domain is key for lipid recognition and membrane interaction, while the
      PH domain typically targets the Golgi apparatus. Some proteins within this family
      also contain an FFAT motif for interaction with VAPA, VAPB, and MOSPD2. Functions
      of these proteins are diverse, ranging from roles in sperm maturation, fertilization,
      neural and skeletal muscle development, to the prevention of exaggerated allergic
      responses and apoptosis regulation. They also may contribute to hepatocellular
      transport of lipids during bile formation and potentially interact with animal
      cells in the case of bacterial members.
