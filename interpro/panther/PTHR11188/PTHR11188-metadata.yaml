  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in various cellular processes including
      endocytosis, ubiquitination, and signal transduction. Members act as adapter
      proteins, mediating the interaction between ubiquitin ligases and their substrates,
      which can lead to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins.
      Some proteins in this family are implicated in the regulation of G protein-coupled
      receptors (GPCRs) by affecting their cell surface expression and turnover. Others
      are involved in cellular responses to environmental stimuli, such as pH changes,
      by participating in the proteolytic cleavage of transcription factors. Additionally,
      certain members have roles in oxidative stress response, transcriptional repression,
      cell cycle arrest, and tumor suppression. The family also includes proteins
      that contribute to the maturation of immune cells and the resistance to toxins
      and stress.
