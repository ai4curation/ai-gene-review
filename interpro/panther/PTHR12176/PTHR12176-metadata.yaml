  description:
  - text: The protein family includes methyltransferases that are part of the methyltransferase
      superfamily. Members are involved in post-translational modifications, specifically
      lysine and N-terminal methylation of various substrates, including citrate synthase
      and elongation factor 1-alpha (EEF1A1 and EEF1A2), playing roles in mitochondrial
      function and mRNA translation regulation. Some family members exhibit dual methyltransferase
      activity, catalyzing methylation at multiple sites of their targets. The activity
      of these enzymes is regulated by various metabolites and nucleotides, such as
      S-adenosylhomocysteine, oxaloacetate, GTP, and GDP. Additionally, one member
      is involved in the biosynthesis of sordarial, a salicylic aldehyde, by participating
      in a polyketide synthase pathway and contributing to the formation of an aromatic
      product from a reduced polyketide chain.
