    name: tRNA (32-2'-O)-methyltransferase regulator THADA
    short: tRNA_methyltransferase_THADA
  description:
  - text: The THADA family proteins are involved in the post-transcriptional modification
      of tRNAs and energy homeostasis. Members of this family function in conjunction
      with specific methyltransferases to methylate the 2'-O-ribose of nucleotides
      at position 32 in the anticodon loop of tRNAs, a modification important for
      the stability and function of the tRNA molecule. Additionally, THADA proteins
      play a crucial role in regulating metabolic processes. They are implicated in
      the control of calcium signaling pathways that influence energy storage and
      thermogenesis. By modulating the activity of calcium-transporting ATPases, THADA
      proteins can affect lipid storage and heat production, and may also influence
      feeding behavior through actions in the nervous system.
