    name: AAA ATPase domain-containing protein
    short: AAA_ATPase_domain
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is characterized by the presence of AAA ATPase domains,
      suggesting a role in various cellular processes that require ATP hydrolysis.
      Members are involved in critical functions such as cell division, growth, protein
      degradation, vesicle fusion, and organelle biogenesis. They participate in the
      unfolding of substrate proteins, disassembly of protein complexes, and the regulation
      of proteasomal degradation pathways. Some proteins in this family are implicated
      in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) process, ribosome
      biogenesis, and the response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. They also contribute
      to the maintenance of protein quality control by mediating the extraction and
      degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins. Additionally, these proteins play
      roles in the formation and reassembly of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis,
      DNA damage response, and autophagy.
