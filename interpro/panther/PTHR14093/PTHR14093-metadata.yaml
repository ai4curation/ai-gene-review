  description:
  - text: The protein family includes two distinct groups with different functions.
      One group, the HLA/H-2 class II histocompatibility antigen gamma chains, plays
      a pivotal role in the immune system by stabilizing MHC class II alpha/beta heterodimers,
      facilitating antigen presentation, and interacting with CD44 to enhance T-cell
      responses. They also act as chaperones for CTSL and have antiviral properties
      against pathogens like Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-2. The other group, thyroglobulin,
      is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis, acting as a precursor for iodinated
      hormones T3 and T4. Thyroglobulin undergoes iodination and coupling of tyrosine
      residues, followed by proteolysis to release the hormones into the bloodstream.
      Both groups are critical for their respective physiological processes, with
      the former involved in immune defense and the latter in metabolic regulation.
