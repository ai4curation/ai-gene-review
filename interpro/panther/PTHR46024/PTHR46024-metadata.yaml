  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes histone-lysine N-methyltransferases that
      are primarily involved in the methylation of 'Lys-9' of histone H3, which is
      a key epigenetic mark for transcriptional repression. They recruit heterochromatin
      protein 1 (HP1) to methylated histones, thereby playing a central role in the
      regulation of gene expression during various biological processes such as oogenesis,
      embryonic development, and mitosis. These proteins are also implicated in the
      silencing of euchromatic genes, tumor suppressor genes, and in maintaining a
      repressive state of genes in embryonic stem cells. The methylation activity
      of these proteins is crucial for chromosome condensation and segregation, and
      they are involved in protecting genomic stability by suppressing transcription-induced
      replication stress.
