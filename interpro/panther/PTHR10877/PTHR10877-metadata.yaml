  description:
  - text: The Polycystin family is involved in various functions related to calcium
      signaling and mechanosensation. Members of this family form heteromeric and
      homomeric ion channels that are permeable to cations, particularly calcium.
      These channels play roles in processes such as fluid-flow mechanosensation in
      renal epithelium, sour taste perception, and fertilization. They are also involved
      in the regulation of cilium length and function, which is crucial for mechanotransductive
      signaling and left-right axis specification during embryogenesis. Some family
      members act as sour taste receptors, while others are implicated in the initiation
      of the acrosome reaction of sperm during fertilization. The activity of these
      channels is regulated by factors such as phosphorylation, intracellular calcium
      levels, and acid stimuli.
