  description:
  - text: The Endophilin/SH3RF protein family is involved in various cellular processes
      including endocytosis, signal transduction, and apoptosis. Members of this family
      are characterized by the presence of SH3 domains and often BAR domains, which
      are implicated in membrane curvature and binding. Endophilins play roles in
      synaptic vesicle endocytosis, receptor internalization, and actin cytoskeleton
      interaction. SH3RF proteins possess E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity, contributing
      to ubiquitination and protein turnover, and are involved in the JNK signaling
      pathway. This family is also associated with the regulation of cell morphology,
      migration, cytokinesis, and neuronal development.
