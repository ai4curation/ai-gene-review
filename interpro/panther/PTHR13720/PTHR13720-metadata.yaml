  description:
  - text: The WD repeat EMAP family is involved in the regulation and modification
      of microtubule dynamics. Members of this family play crucial roles in the assembly,
      stability, and length of microtubules, affecting processes such as mitotic spindle
      organization, chromosome alignment during metaphase, and cell division orientation.
      Some proteins within this family are essential for normal brain development
      and neuronal progenitor cell proliferation. Others are implicated in ciliary
      and flagellar motility, contributing to spermatozoa motility and proper beating
      of cilia and flagella. The family includes proteins with a tandem atypical propeller
      in EMLs (TAPE) domain, which is characterized by a unique beta-propeller structure.
