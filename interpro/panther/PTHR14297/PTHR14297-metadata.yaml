  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the intracellular transport of lipids.
      Members of this family function as membrane adapter proteins that facilitate
      the recruitment of the lipid transfer protein VPS13A from lipid droplets to
      the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This recruitment is essential for the
      maintenance of lipid homeostasis within the cell and may play a role in various
      cellular processes that depend on lipid transfer and membrane dynamics.
