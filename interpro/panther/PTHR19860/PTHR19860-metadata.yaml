  description:
  - text: This family of proteins functions as substrate-recognition components of
      DCX (DDB1-CUL4-X-box) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes, which are involved
      in the DesCEND (destruction via C-end degrons) pathway. They recognize and bind
      to specific C-degron motifs, typically less than ten residues in length, located
      at the extreme C terminus of target proteins. This interaction leads to the
      ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of these targets. The
      family is characterized by its ability to recognize diglutamate (Glu-Glu) C-terminal
      sequences, as well as an alternative glutamate-leucine (Glu-Leu) degron. These
      proteins play a crucial role in various cellular processes, including starvation-induced
      autophagy, spermatogenesis, and T cell activation.
