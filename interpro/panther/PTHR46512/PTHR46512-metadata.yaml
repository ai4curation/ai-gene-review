  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes immunophilins with peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans
      isomerase (PPIase) and co-chaperone activities. They are involved in the intracellular
      trafficking of steroid hormone receptors and play a role in maintaining these
      receptors in the cytoplasm when unliganded. Some members regulate Akt/AKT1 activity
      by promoting interaction with PHLPP1, enhancing Akt/AKT1 dephosphorylation and
      activation. They also interact with components of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway,
      influencing kinase activity and IFN production. Certain members have a role
      in microtubule dynamics, neuronal growth cone regulation, and may protect against
      oxidative stress in mitochondria. Others are involved in protein folding, cell
      division, adhesion, elongation, and hormonal control of plant development. The
      family is characterized by the presence of TPR repeats and FKBP-type domains,
      with some members being inhibited by immunosuppressive drugs like FK506 and
      rapamycin.
