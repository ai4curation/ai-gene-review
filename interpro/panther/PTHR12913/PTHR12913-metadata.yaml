  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes RNA-binding proteins that play a critical
      role in mRNA turnover and are involved in the regulation of translation. They
      are implicated in the cytoplasmic deadenylation, translation, and decay processes
      of mRNAs, particularly through interactions with the major coding-region determinant
      of instability domain. These proteins are also essential for the efficient assembly
      of stress granules, which are involved in the cellular response to stress. Additionally,
      in the context of microbial infection, they are required for the internal initiation
      of translation of certain viral RNAs.
