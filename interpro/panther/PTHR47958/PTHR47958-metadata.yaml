    name: DEAD box helicase family involved in RNA processing and regulation
    short: DEAD_box_helicase_RNA_proc_reg
  description:
  - text: The DEAD box helicase family is characterized by the Q motif, which controls
      ATP binding and hydrolysis. Members of this family are involved in various cellular
      processes, including pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA export from the nucleus, translation
      initiation, ribosome biogenesis, and the response to stress and apoptosis. They
      function as ATP-dependent RNA helicases, capable of unwinding RNA-RNA and RNA-DNA
      duplexes, and play roles in the metabolism of small nuclear and nucleolar ribonucleoproteins.
      Some family members are essential for spermatogenesis, germ cell formation,
      and the repression of transposable elements, ensuring germline integrity. They
      also participate in innate immunity, acting as viral RNA sensors and promoting
      type I interferon production. Additionally, they are involved in transcription
      regulation, acting as coactivators or corepressors, and in the alternative regulation
      of pre-mRNA splicing.
