  description:
  - text: The eukaryotic ribosomal protein eL39 family comprises RNA-binding components
      of the large ribosomal subunit, which is a crucial part of the ribosome, the
      cell's protein synthesis machinery. Members of the eL39 family are involved
      in the polymerization of amino acids into polypeptide chains, as they are part
      of the peptidyl transferase center. They contribute to the formation of the
      polypeptide exit tunnel through which nascent proteins are funneled. Specific
      variants of eL39, such as those expressed in male germ cells, are essential
      for sperm formation and male fertility, indicating a specialized role in the
      regulation of germ-cell-specific protein biosynthesis and folding.
