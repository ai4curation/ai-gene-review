  description:
  - text: The protein family is involved in the dynamics and stability of microtubules,
      essential components of the cytoskeleton. Members of the family play roles in
      the folding of tubulin, the building block of microtubules, and in the regulation
      of microtubule-associated processes such as vesicle and organelle transport,
      cell division, and maintenance of cell polarity. Some family members act as
      chaperones, assisting in the proper folding of tubulin and its assembly into
      heterodimers. Others are involved in the activation and regulation of the dynein
      motor, enhancing its processivity along microtubules and mediating retrograde
      transport. Additionally, certain members link microtubules to other cellular
      structures, including the actin cytoskeleton and membranous organelles, and
      are involved in cellular activities like endocytosis and glucose transport.
      The family also includes proteins that regulate microtubule growth, bundling,
      and stability, contributing to various cellular functions such as axonal growth,
      spindle orientation, and cilia formation.
