  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in host defense mechanisms, including
      mucosal and cellular immune defense, and may also play a role in epithelial
      differentiation and liver regeneration. Members of this family are capable of
      binding to a variety of bacterial pathogens in a calcium-dependent manner, suggesting
      a function in antimicrobial defense. They may act as opsonin receptors for certain
      immune system proteins, facilitating their role in immune surveillance. Some
      family members are implicated in the regulation of lipid metabolism and inflammatory
      responses, potentially influencing conditions such as atherosclerosis and obesity-related
      metabolic diseases. They may also participate in the regulation of taste sensation
      and have been associated with the actin cytoskeleton, influencing its remodeling
      during cellular processes such as exocytosis.
