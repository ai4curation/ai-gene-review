  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that are involved in various cellular
      processes. Some proteins in this family may function as scaffold proteins, interacting
      with other proteins such as MADD and RAB3GA on synaptic vesicles, and are implicated
      in the regulation of neuronal and endocrine homeostatic processes. Other family
      members are components of the RAVE complex, which is essential for the stable
      assembly of the V-ATPase complex, a critical component for vacuolar acidification
      and membrane transport. These proteins play roles in the brain and are key controllers
      of homeostasis, as well as being involved in the transport between endosomal
      compartments and the assembly of vacuolar ATPase.
