  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in cell adhesion and signaling in the
      nervous system. They play crucial roles in the development of the nervous system,
      including neuron-neuron adhesion, neurite outgrowth, axonal guidance, and the
      formation of synapses. Some members mediate cell surface interactions and contribute
      to the organization of axonal domains, while others function as receptors for
      guidance cues like netrin, participating in processes such as axon attraction
      and repulsion. Additionally, certain family members are implicated in the formation
      and maintenance of the nodes of Ranvier, which are essential for the propagation
      of action potentials along myelinated axons.
