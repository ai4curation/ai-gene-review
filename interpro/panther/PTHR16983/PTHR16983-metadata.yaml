  description:
  - text: The Ly-6/neurotoxin-like protein family includes GPI-anchored and secreted
      proteins that interact with nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors
      (nAChRs and mAChRs), modulating their activity and affecting various physiological
      processes. Family members are involved in the regulation of T-lymphocyte proliferation,
      differentiation, and activation, as well as in the formation of the placenta
      by acting as receptors for syncytin-A. They play roles in lipid metabolism,
      cell proliferation, and maintaining the integrity of the skin. Some members
      have antitumor activities and are markers of late differentiation in the skin.
      The family also includes proteins that modulate nAChR trafficking, cell surface
      expression, and single channel properties, which can prevent excessive excitation
      and neurodegeneration. They are implicated in the regulation of plasticity in
      the primary visual cortex late in life.
