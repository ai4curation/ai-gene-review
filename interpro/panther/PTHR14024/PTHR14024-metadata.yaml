    name: Perilipin lipid droplet-associated
    short: Perilipin
  description:
  - text: The perilipin family comprises lipid droplet-associated proteins that play
      a crucial role in the regulation of lipid storage and metabolism. Members of
      this family are structural components of lipid droplets and are essential for
      the formation and maintenance of these lipid storage organelles. They balance
      lipogenesis and lipolysis, as well as regulate fatty acid oxidation in oxidative
      tissues. Some family members function as scaffolding proteins, coordinating
      the activity of lipolytic enzymes such as ABHD5, PNPLA2, and LIPE. They also
      participate in the recruitment of mitochondria to lipid droplets, influencing
      both the storage of fatty acids as triglycerides and their release for mitochondrial
      oxidation. Phosphorylation events, particularly by PKA, modulate the lipolytic
      activity of these proteins, impacting the mobilization of stored lipids. Additionally,
      certain perilipins are involved in the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors
      from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network, indicating a broader role in cellular
      trafficking processes.
