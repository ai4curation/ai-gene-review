    short: Rho_GEF
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors
      (GEFs) that activate Rho-GTPases by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP.
      They play a pivotal role in various cellular processes such as cell motility,
      polarization, cytoskeletal dynamics, and signal transduction pathways. These
      proteins are involved in focal adhesion formation, axonal branching, synapse
      formation, dendritic morphogenesis, and B-lymphocyte activation. Some members
      are implicated in innate immune responses, acting as signaling intermediaries
      and participating in cytokine secretion. They also contribute to cell cycle
      regulation, apoptosis, and cancer progression. Additionally, they are involved
      in the development and differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells and the
      migration of precerebellar neurons. Certain members function as scaffold proteins,
      assembling signaling complexes downstream of G protein-coupled receptors, and
      are involved in cardiac hypertrophy and osteogenesis.
