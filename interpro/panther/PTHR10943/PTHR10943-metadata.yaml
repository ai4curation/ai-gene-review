  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of
      ubiquitinated proteins as part of the 26S proteasome complex. The proteasome
      is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis by removing proteins that are
      misfolded, damaged, or no longer needed, thus participating in various cellular
      processes such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair.
      Some members of this family also interact with the intracellular domain of tumor
      necrosis factor type 1 receptor, which is outside the death domain of TNFR1,
      indicating a role in signaling pathways.
