    name: Lysosomal Cobalamin Transport Escort Protein LMBD1
    short: LMBD1_LysCbl_Transport
  description:
  - text: The LMBRD1 subfamily of the LIMR family is characterized by proteins that
      function as lysosomal cobalamin transporters. These proteins are essential for
      the export of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B12, from lysosomes to the cytosol.
      This export is a critical step in allowing the conversion of cobalamin into
      its active cofactor forms. Members of the LMBRD1 subfamily are also involved
      in targeting the ABCD4 transporter to the lysosome and forming a complex with
      ABCD4 and MMACHC to facilitate cobalamin transport across the lysosomal membrane.
      Additionally, some family members act as adapter proteins that mediate and regulate
      the internalization of the insulin receptor, and are involved in clathrin-mediated
      endocytosis. They play a role in early embryogenesis, particularly in the initiation
      of gastrulation and formation of mesoderm structures.
