  description:
  - text: The laminin/netrin protein family is involved in the attachment, migration,
      and organization of cells into tissues during embryonic development by interacting
      with other extracellular matrix components. Laminins are crucial for the formation
      of stable basement membranes and organizing receptor complexes and cytoskeletal
      components. Netrins control guidance of central nervous system commissural axons
      and peripheral motor axons, serving as survival factors and regulating apoptosis.
      They are implicated in various developmental processes including neural, kidney,
      and vascular development, as well as in tumorigenesis. This family includes
      proteins that promote neurite outgrowth and are involved in the regulation of
      skeletogenesis and neuromuscular junction formation.
