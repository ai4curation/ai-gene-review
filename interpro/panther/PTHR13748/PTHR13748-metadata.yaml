  description:
  - text: This family of proteins functions as zinc chaperones, facilitating the transfer
      of zinc ions to target metalloproteins, which results in their activation. The
      proteins possess a GTPase domain with a CXCC motif that binds zinc and, upon
      GTP hydrolysis, transfers the zinc to specific binding sites on metalloproteins.
      This process is essential for the proper function of metalloenzymes such as
      methionine aminopeptidase METAP1, which cleaves initiator methionine from nascent
      polypeptides. The activity of these GTPases is regulated by metal binding; zinc
      inhibits while other metals like Co(II) and Ni(II) decrease the GTPase activity.
      These proteins are part of the SIMIBI class G3E GTPase family within the ZNG1
      subfamily.
