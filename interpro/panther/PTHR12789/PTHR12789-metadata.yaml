    short: DENR/SUI1_TIF
  description:
  - text: The DENR/SUI1 family includes proteins involved in the initiation phase
      of translation. Members of this family are implicated in various functions related
      to translation initiation, such as scanning and recognition of the initiation
      codon, and promoting the recruitment of aminoacylated initiator tRNA to the
      P site of 40S ribosomes. Some proteins in this family may also facilitate the
      release of deacylated tRNA and mRNA from recycled 40S subunits after post-termination
      ribosomal complexes are dissociated into subunits. Additionally, certain DENR
      family members play a role in modulating the translational profile of a subset
      of mRNAs, particularly in cancer-related processes when recruited by oncogenes.
      The SUI1 domain present in these proteins is suggested to be involved in RNA
      binding, which is crucial for their function in translation.
