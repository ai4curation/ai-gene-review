  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes scaffolding proteins that play key roles
      in cellular signaling, localization, and structural integrity. They are involved
      in the formation and maintenance of tight junctions and epithelial cell polarity.
      Some family members act as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases, mediating ubiquitination
      and degradation of specific substrates. Others are implicated in synaptic plasticity,
      participating in NMDAR signaling complexes that may control AMPAR potentiation.
      These proteins often contain PDZ domains that mediate interactions with various
      partners, influencing processes such as vesicle transport, cell migration, and
      the organization of multiprotein complexes. The family also includes proteins
      that regulate the feedback of phototransduction in photoreceptors and proteins
      that may affect the surface expression and function of ion channels in sensory
      neurons.
