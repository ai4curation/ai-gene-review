  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in various immune functions, including
      the modulation of T-cell-mediated responses, such as activation, proliferation,
      cytokine production, and development of cytotoxicity. Members of this family
      may act as costimulatory signals for T-cell and B-cell responses, influencing
      both adaptive and innate immune mechanisms. Some proteins within this family
      are implicated in cell-cell adhesion processes, particularly in the context
      of myelin sheath maintenance and cell communication. Additionally, they may
      play roles in the negative regulation of T-cell proliferation, and in the case
      of tumor macrophages, contribute to the suppression of tumor-associated antigen-specific
      T-cell immunity. Certain members are also involved in the secretion of milk-fat
      droplets and may act as receptors for the association of cytoplasmic droplets
      with the apical plasma membrane.
