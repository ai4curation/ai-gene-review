  description:
  - text: This family of proteins functions as substrate adapter subunits in E3 ubiquitin
      ligase complexes, which are involved in targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation.
      Members of this family recognize substrates bearing N-terminal glycine degrons,
      which are often exposed following caspase cleavage during apoptosis or after
      a failure of N-myristoylation. This recognition is crucial for the clearance
      of proteolytic fragments and the quality control of protein N-myristoylation.
      Some family members also play roles in cell cycle regulation, polarity establishment,
      and enhancing innate immune responses by modulating cGAS activity in antiviral
      defense.
