  description:
  - text: The PPase class C family proteins are manganese-dependent inorganic pyrophosphatases
      that play a crucial role in the hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate to two
      phosphate ions. This reaction is important for the energy balance of the cell,
      as it couples the thermodynamically unfavorable biosynthetic reactions with
      the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate, which drives these reactions to completion.
      Some family members, such as the Prune subfamily, have additional roles in cell
      proliferation, migration, differentiation, and neurogenesis. They may also be
      involved in the regulation of microtubule polymerization and act as negative
      regulators of NME1. The family includes proteins with exopolyphosphatase activity,
      involved in the degradation of inorganic polyphosphates, and proteins like Caytaxin,
      which are implicated in neural development and neurotransmission regulation.
