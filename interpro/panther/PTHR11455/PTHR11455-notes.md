# PANTHER Family PTHR11455 (CRYPTOCHROME) Summary

Source: InterPro/PANTHER API cached in this repo.

## Family overview
- **Family:** PTHR11455 (CRYPTOCHROME)
- **Integrated InterPro entry:** IPR002081 (Cryptochrome/DNA photolyase 1)
- **Subfamilies:** 17
- **Reviewed proteins cached:** 59 (see `interpro/panther/PTHR11455/PTHR11455-entries.csv`)
- **Total proteins in family:** 38,628 across 26,212 taxa
- **Structures:** 112 (AlphaFold models: 31,332)
- **Representative structure:** PDB 5t5x (mouse CRY1)
- **Fetch timestamp:** 2026-01-30

## Notes for curation
- The family contains both cryptochromes and photolyases; subfamilies separate circadian cryptochromes from repair enzymes.
- Use subfamily context to interpret IBA annotations that may be over-propagated across photolyase-like proteins.
