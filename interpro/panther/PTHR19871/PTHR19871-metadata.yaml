    name: NACHT and WD repeat domain-containing protein
    short: NACHT-WD_repeat
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that contain NACHT and WD repeat
      domains. The NACHT domain is typically involved in nucleotide binding and signal
      transduction, often playing a role in the regulation of inflammatory and immune
      responses. The WD repeat domain is known for mediating protein-protein interactions,
      which can be crucial in various cellular processes such as signal transduction,
      cell cycle control, and apoptosis. One member from Caenorhabditis elegans has
      been studied for its role in sensory neurons, where it is involved in the avoidance
      response to noxious chemicals and in promoting dauer formation in response to
      specific pheromones. This suggests that the family may be involved in sensory
      perception and stress response mechanisms.
