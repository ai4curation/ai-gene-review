  description:
  - text: The TRAFAC class YlqF/YawG GTPase family is involved in various cellular
      processes, including the maturation and nuclear export of pre-60S ribosomal
      subunits, regulation of cellular proliferation, and stabilization of proteins
      involved in cell cycle regulation and ribosome biogenesis. Members of the family
      exhibit GTPase activity that is often regulated by ribosomal subunits, particularly
      the 60S subunit. The family is characterized by a unique circular permutation
      of GTPase motifs, forming a G4-G1-G3 pattern. Some members are implicated in
      maintaining stem cell proliferative capacity, stabilizing MDM2 to prevent ubiquitination
      and proteasomal degradation, and affecting TP53 activity. Others are involved
      in telomere maintenance by stabilizing TERF1 and promoting cell proliferation.
      The family also includes proteins that play roles in plant growth, senescence,
      and development by modulating ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus.
