    name: Nuclear hormone receptor family NR2 subfamily
    short: Nuclear_hormone_rcpt_NR2
  description:
  - text: The nuclear hormone receptor family NR2 subfamily consists of transcription
      factors that play diverse roles in regulating gene expression in various biological
      processes, including development, metabolism, and immune response. Members of
      this family are characterized by their ability to bind DNA as monomers or heterodimers
      to hormone response elements (HREs) and modulate transcription in response to
      ligands such as retinoic acid. They are involved in critical functions such
      as retinal development, circadian rhythm maintenance, lipid metabolism, and
      embryogenesis. Some act as orphan receptors with no known ligands, while others
      are activated by retinoids. They can function as repressors or activators of
      transcription, influencing pathways like spermatogenesis, stem cell proliferation,
      and photoreceptor cell development. The family includes receptors that are essential
      for vision, regulators of hormonal responses, and mediators of developmental
      processes in both vertebrates and invertebrates.
