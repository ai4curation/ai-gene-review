  description:
  - text: The SctL stator family and FliH family proteins are involved in distinct
      bacterial systems with roles in motility and interaction with host cells. The
      SctL stator family proteins are components of the type III secretion system
      (T3SS), also known as the injectisome. They are responsible for injecting bacterial
      effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells and regulating the activity of
      the T3SS ATPase. The FliH family proteins are implicated in the assembly and
      regrowth of bacterial flagella, which are essential for motility. Despite the
      different systems, both families share a common theme of contributing to the
      dynamic processes that are crucial for bacterial survival and pathogenicity.
