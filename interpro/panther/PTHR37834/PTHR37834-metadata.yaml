  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the degradation of plant cell wall
      polysaccharides. Members exhibit esterase activity, catalyzing the deacetylation
      of acetylated plant polysaccharides such as birchwood xylan and glucomannan.
      Some family members also display endoglucanase activity against substrates like
      carboxymethyl cellulose and barley beta-glucan. Additionally, certain proteins
      within this family can potentiate cellulase activity through non-catalytic cellulose
      binding. The family includes multifunctional enzymes that may contain distinct
      modules for cellulase and esterase activities, as well as dockerin modules for
      integration into cellulosomes, which are multi-enzyme complexes for cellulose
      degradation.
