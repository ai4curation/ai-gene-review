    short: Corepressor-Demethylase
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes transcriptional corepressors and histone
      demethylases. The corepressors are involved in gene repression through the formation
      of complexes that recruit histone deacetylases, leading to a repressive chromatin
      structure and direct interference with the transcriptional machinery. They play
      roles in various physiological processes and are essential for normal growth
      and development. The histone demethylases are involved in the dynamic regulation
      of histone methylation, specifically demethylating 'Lys-27' of histone H3, which
      is a key modification in the histone code. These enzymes are implicated in developmental
      processes by regulating HOX gene expression, and they also participate in inflammatory
      responses and macrophage differentiation. Some members of this family have additional
      roles in chromatin remodeling independent of their demethylase activity.
