  description:
  - text: The Two-component system sensor histidine kinase family is involved in a
      wide range of bacterial regulatory systems that respond to environmental stimuli.
      These proteins typically function as part of a two-component regulatory system,
      where they act as membrane-associated protein kinases. Upon sensing specific
      environmental signals, they undergo autophosphorylation on a histidine residue
      and subsequently transfer the phosphate to a response regulator protein, which
      then modulates the expression of target genes. These systems are involved in
      crucial bacterial processes including virulence, stress resistance, metal ion
      homeostasis, and adaptation to various environmental conditions such as low
      magnesium levels, acidic environments, and presence of antimicrobial peptides.
      Some family members also exhibit phosphatase activity, dephosphorylating the
      response regulator to modulate the signaling pathway. This dynamic regulation
      allows bacteria to rapidly adapt to changing conditions, contributing to their
      survival and pathogenicity.
