    name: Plant Phytochrome Photoreceptors
    short: Phytochrome
  description:
  - text: The phytochrome family consists of regulatory photoreceptors that exist
      in two reversible forms, Pr and Pfr, which absorb maximally in the red and far-red
      regions of the spectrum, respectively. The photoconversion of Pr to Pfr triggers
      a variety of morphogenic responses, while the reverse transition cancels these
      effects. Pfr form influences the expression of numerous nuclear genes, including
      those for the small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase, chlorophyll
      A/B binding protein, protochlorophyllide reductase, and rRNA. Phytochromes also
      exhibit autoregulation through a negative feedback mechanism on their own gene
      expression. They play a crucial role in plant development and environmental
      response, affecting processes such as seed germination, hypocotyl elongation,
      and flowering time regulation.
