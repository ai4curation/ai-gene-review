  description:
  - text: The bZIP family of transcription factors is characterized by the basic leucine
      zipper domain which facilitates DNA binding and dimerization. Members of this
      family are involved in a wide range of biological processes, including transcriptional
      regulation of genes associated with anti-apoptosis, cell growth, DNA damage
      response, innate immunity, oxidative stress responses, and developmental processes.
      They bind to specific DNA sequences such as the cAMP response element (CRE)
      or activator protein 1 (AP-1) consensus sequences to activate or repress transcription.
      Some family members also interact with histone acetyltransferases or methyltransferases,
      influencing chromatin structure and gene expression. The activity of these proteins
      can be modulated by phosphorylation, impacting processes like the DNA damage
      response and cell death. The bZIP proteins play roles in cellular stress responses,
      secondary metabolism, and can have oncogenic or tumor suppressor activities
      depending on the context.
