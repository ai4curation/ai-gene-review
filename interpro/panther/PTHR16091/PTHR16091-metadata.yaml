  description:
  - text: The TTC17 family is implicated in the process of primary ciliogenesis, specifically
      through the modulation of actin polymerization. The proper formation and function
      of primary cilia are crucial for various cellular signaling pathways, and defects
      in ciliogenesis can lead to a range of ciliopathies. By influencing actin dynamics,
      the TTC17 family plays a vital role in the structural organization required
      for cilia formation, thus contributing to cellular homeostasis and signaling.
