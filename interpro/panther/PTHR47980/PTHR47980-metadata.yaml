  description:
  - text: The Rab family of small GTPases is a group of proteins that play a crucial
      role in regulating intracellular membrane trafficking. They are involved in
      various stages of vesicular transport, including vesicle formation, movement,
      tethering, and fusion with target membranes. Members of the Rab family cycle
      between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form, recruiting
      different downstream effectors necessary for vesicular trafficking processes.
      They are key regulators in processes such as exocytosis, endocytic recycling,
      and ciliogenesis. Some Rabs are involved in specific pathways like insulin-induced
      glucose transporter trafficking to the plasma membrane, which is important for
      glucose homeostasis. Others participate in the establishment and maintenance
      of cell polarity, neurotransmitter release, and the assembly of tight junctions.
      The Rab family also has roles in autophagy, axonogenesis, and the regulation
      of endoplasmic reticulum dynamics.
