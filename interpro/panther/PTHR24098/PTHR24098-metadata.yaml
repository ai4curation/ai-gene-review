    name: Intraflagellar Transport and TRIM E3 Ligases
    short: IFT_TRIM_E3_Ligases
  description:
  - text: The protein family includes members that are involved in two distinct cellular
      processes. One subgroup functions as components of the intraflagellar transport
      (IFT) complex B, which is crucial for the formation and maintenance of motile
      and sensory cilia. These proteins play a role in the assembly of cilia and flagella,
      suggesting a probable involvement in cell motility and sensory functions. Another
      subgroup belongs to the TRIM/RBCC family and functions as E3 ubiquitin ligases.
      These proteins are implicated in various biological processes, including development,
      immune response, autophagy, and regulation of innate immune signaling pathways.
      They interact with multiple proteins and pathways, modulating transcription,
      ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation, as well as playing a critical role
      in early embryonic development by influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and protein
      ubiquitination.
