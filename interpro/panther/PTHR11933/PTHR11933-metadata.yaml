    short: tRNA_2-thiouridylase_MnmA/TRMU
  description:
  - text: The MnmA/TRMU family proteins are responsible for the post-transcriptional
      modification of tRNA molecules. They catalyze the 2-thiolation of uridine at
      the wobble position (U34) of tRNA, which is essential for the proper decoding
      of NNR codons during protein synthesis and for the structural stability of tRNA.
      This modification is crucial for the accurate and efficient translation of the
      genetic code into functional proteins. The thiolation process involves the addition
      of a sulfur atom to the uridine base, which is facilitated by a sulfur-relay
      system involving other proteins such as IscS. Some members of the family are
      also involved in mitochondrial tRNA modification, which is vital for mitochondrial
      protein synthesis and function.
