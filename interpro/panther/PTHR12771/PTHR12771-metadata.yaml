  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in cellular processes related to the
      cytoskeleton, including phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and cell motility. Members
      of this family act in concert with other proteins such as DOCK1 and CRK to facilitate
      these processes. Some proteins within this family are proposed to activate Rac
      Rho small GTPases, potentially enhancing the guanine nucleotide exchange factor
      (GEF) activity of their partners. Additionally, certain members function as
      GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for the ARL2 GTPase and other related factors,
      but not for GTPases outside the Arf family. This indicates a role in modulating
      the activity of GTPases involved in various signaling pathways. Furthermore,
      some proteins in this family are implicated in regulating antiviral responses
      and maintaining proper cell shape during phagocytosis and chemotaxis by modulating
      actin polymerization.
