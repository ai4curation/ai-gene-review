    name: 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine binding
    short: 5hmC_binding
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is characterized by their ability to specifically
      interact with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a modified form of the DNA base
      cytosine. The binding to 5hmC suggests a role in recognizing this epigenetic
      mark, which is involved in DNA methylation processes that regulate gene expression.
      The members of this family are implicated in reading the epigenetic code, which
      may influence chromatin structure and function, impacting cellular differentiation
      and development.
