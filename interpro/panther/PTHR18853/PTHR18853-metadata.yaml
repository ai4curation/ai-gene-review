    short: CC-FHA_domain
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members with coiled-coil domains and forkhead-associated
      domains, suggesting a role in mediating protein-protein interactions and potentially
      in DNA binding or the sensing of phosphorylation status. Coiled-coil domains
      are known to facilitate the oligomerization of proteins and are involved in
      a variety of biological processes including regulation of gene expression, cell
      division, and vesicle transport. Forkhead-associated domains are recognized
      for their ability to bind phosphopeptides and are often found in proteins involved
      in signal transduction, cell cycle control, and DNA repair. The presence of
      these domains indicates that the family may be involved in complex regulatory
      mechanisms within the cell, possibly acting as scaffolds or mediators in various
      signaling pathways or cellular structures.
