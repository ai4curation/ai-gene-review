    name: Cobalt resistance-associated protein ApaG
    short: Co_resistance_ApaG
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in cellular metal ion homeostasis, particularly
      related to cobalt and magnesium ions. Members of this family have been implicated
      in providing resistance to low levels of cobalt ions and are associated with
      the modulation of magnesium ion transport. The exact molecular function remains
      unclear, but mutations in these proteins can affect magnesium efflux without
      influencing influx, suggesting a regulatory role in magnesium ion transport
      systems.
