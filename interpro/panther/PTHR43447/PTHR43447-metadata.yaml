    name: Glycosyl Hydrolase Family 13
    short: Glycosyl_Hydrlase_13
  description:
  - text: The glycosyl hydrolase 13 family is characterized by enzymes that primarily
      catalyze the hydrolysis of internal (1->4)-alpha-D-glucosidic bonds in starch
      and related oligosaccharides. Members of this family are involved in the initial
      stages of starch digestion, yielding products such as maltose, isomaltose, glucose,
      and dextrins. Some isozymes play a crucial role in the breakdown of endosperm
      starch during seed germination. The family includes calcium-binding enzymes
      with amylolytic activity that can act on both soluble and insoluble glucan substrates.
      These enzymes are found across various organisms, including humans, plants,
      and bacteria, and are regulated by factors such as redox potential, chloride
      ions, and specific inhibitors.
