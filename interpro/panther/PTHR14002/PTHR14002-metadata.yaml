  description:
  - text: The Zona Pellucida (ZP) domain-containing protein family includes glycoproteins
      involved in various biological processes such as the formation of extracellular
      matrices, cell signaling, and immune responses. Members of this family play
      roles in the structural integrity of tissues, cell-cell interactions, and protection
      against pathogens. They are characterized by the presence of a ZP domain, which
      mediates polymerization into filaments and is essential for their function.
      These proteins are involved in the biogenesis and organization of epithelial
      cell membranes, regulation of angiogenesis, and fertility. They also function
      in pathogen capture and clearance, as well as in the presentation of growth
      factors to signaling receptors. The ZP domain typically consists of N-terminal
      and C-terminal regions connected by a flexible linker, allowing for the formation
      of helical structures and branching filaments that are heavily glycosylated
      and involved in various binding and regulatory activities.
