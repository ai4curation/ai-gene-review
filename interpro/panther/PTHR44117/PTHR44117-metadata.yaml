  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the formation and maintenance of
      cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of eukaryotic cells. Members
      of this family play a crucial role in the biogenesis of primary cilia by positively
      regulating their assembly. They are also implicated in the autophagic process,
      where they are necessary for the trafficking of specific autophagy-related proteins
      and the expansion of autophagic compartments. Additionally, these proteins are
      components of the intraflagellar transport complex B, which is essential for
      the assembly of flagella in organisms that possess them.
