    name: Integrator complex subunit 6
    short: Integrator_subunit6
  description:
  - text: The Integrator subunit 6 family is involved in the transcription and 3'-box-dependent
      processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNA), including U1, U2, U4, U5, and U7.
      Family members are components of the Integrator complex, which associates with
      the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II's largest subunit. They may also
      play a role in recruiting cytoplasmic dynein to the nuclear envelope. Additionally,
      some members may have tumor suppressor functions, as their ectopic expression
      can suppress tumor cell growth.
