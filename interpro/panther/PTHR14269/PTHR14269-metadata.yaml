  description:
  - text: The CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase class-I family is involved in the
      biosynthesis of acidic phospholipids, which are critical components of cell
      membranes. Members of this family function as enzymes that catalyze the transfer
      of a phosphatidyl group from CDP-diacylglycerol to various acceptor molecules.
      For instance, some family members transfer the phosphatidyl group to glycerol-3-phosphate
      to form phosphatidylglycerophosphate, the committed step in the synthesis of
      acidic phospholipids. Others catalyze the synthesis of cardiolipin by transferring
      a phosphatidyl group to phosphatidylglycerol. Cardiolipin is a key phospholipid
      in mitochondrial membranes, essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity
      and function. Additionally, some enzymes within this family can catalyze the
      formation of archaetidylserine in lipid biosynthesis. The activity of these
      enzymes is crucial for cell membrane structure and function, impacting processes
      such as cell morphology, cytokinesis, and stress response.
