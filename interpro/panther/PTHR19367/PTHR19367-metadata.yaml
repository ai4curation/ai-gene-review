  description:
  - text: The T cell receptor (TCR) variable region family is involved in antigen
      recognition and is essential for the immune response. TCRs are present on the
      surface of T lymphocytes and recognize peptide-major histocompatibility (MH)
      complexes displayed by antigen presenting cells (APCs). The interaction between
      TCRs and pMH complexes initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling events
      that lead to T cell activation, growth, and differentiation. The signaling pathways
      include calcium, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase, and nuclear
      factor NF-kappa-B (NF-kB) pathways. TCR diversity is generated in the thymus
      through V-(D)-J rearrangement and is further shaped by selection events to produce
      a repertoire of self-MH restricted, non-autoaggressive T cells. The family includes
      both alpha-beta and gamma-delta TCRs, with alpha-beta TCRs recognizing peptides
      and gamma-delta TCRs recognizing a variety of self and foreign non-peptide antigens.
