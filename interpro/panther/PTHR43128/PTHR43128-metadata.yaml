    name: Lactate/Malate dehydrogenase superfamily
    short: LDH/MDH_sf
  description:
  - text: The LDH/MDH superfamily is characterized by enzymes that catalyze the interconversion
      of various metabolites pivotal to cellular energy metabolism. Lactate dehydrogenases
      (LDHs) within this family are responsible for the interconversion of lactate
      and pyruvate, with the concomitant interconversion of NADH and NAD(+), playing
      a crucial role in anaerobic glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Malate dehydrogenases
      (MDHs) perform the reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate, a key step
      in the citric acid cycle and gluconeogenesis. Some family members are allosterically
      regulated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), indicating a role in responding
      to the energy demands of the cell. The superfamily includes enzymes with varying
      substrate specificities and cofactor preferences, reflecting a diversity of
      roles in different metabolic pathways across a wide range of organisms.
