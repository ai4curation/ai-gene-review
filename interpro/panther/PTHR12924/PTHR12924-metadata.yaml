  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in cellular processes related to the
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They are part of a complex that plays a crucial
      role in binding calcium to the ER membrane, which is essential for the regulation
      of proteins that reside within the ER. Some members of this family may also
      participate in the recycling of the translocation apparatus, which is responsible
      for the translocation of proteins across the ER membrane. Additionally, these
      proteins may act as membrane-bound chaperones that assist in the proper folding
      of newly translocated proteins into their functional conformations. The family
      is characterized by a distinct charge distribution across the protein structure,
      with a highly negatively charged N-terminus and a positively charged cytoplasmic
      C-terminus.
