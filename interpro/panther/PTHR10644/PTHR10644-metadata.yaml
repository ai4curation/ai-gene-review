  description:
  - text: The RSE1/DDB1/CFT1/CPSF1 protein family is involved in various essential
      cellular processes, including pre-mRNA splicing, DNA repair, cell cycle control,
      and pre-mRNA 3'-end formation. Members of the family play roles in the spliceosome,
      a complex that removes introns from pre-mRNAs, and in the recognition and repair
      of UV-induced DNA damage. They are also part of complexes that mediate ubiquitination
      and proteasomal degradation of proteins, contributing to genomic stability,
      transcription-coupled repair, and circadian rhythm regulation. Additionally,
      they are involved in the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF)
      complex, crucial for polyadenylation-dependent pre-mRNA 3'-end formation.
