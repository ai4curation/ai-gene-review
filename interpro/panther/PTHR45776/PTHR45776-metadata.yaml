  description:
  - text: This family of proteins acts as transcription factors involved in a wide
      range of cellular processes, including lysosomal biogenesis, autophagy, immune
      response, melanocyte differentiation, and energy metabolism. Members of this
      family bind to E-box sequences and CLEAR-box sequences to regulate gene expression.
      Their activity is modulated by nutrient availability and cellular stress, with
      phosphorylation by MTOR leading to inactivation and dephosphorylation resulting
      in activation. They play roles in cellular differentiation, such as in melanocytes,
      osteoclasts, and hematopoietic stem cells, and are implicated in the immune
      response to bacterial infection.
