  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is characterized by the presence of an isochorismatase
      domain, which suggests a role in the hydrolysis of isochorismate, a precursor
      in the biosynthesis of various metabolites. One member of this family has been
      described as a secreted effector that can suppress plant innate immunity by
      targeting salicylate metabolism, indicating a potential involvement in pathogen-host
      interactions and virulence. The family is implicated in diverse biological processes,
      likely related to their enzymatic activity in isochorismate hydrolysis and its
      impact on metabolic pathways.
