  description:
  - text: The protein family includes receptors that are predominantly expressed on
      the surface of immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, B cells,
      and myeloid cells. Members of the family are involved in the regulation of the
      immune response through recognition of class I MHC antigens and other ligands.
      They play roles in inhibiting or activating cytolytic functions, modulating
      cytokine production, and contributing to immune tolerance and homeostasis. Some
      receptors possess immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitor motifs (ITIMs) that
      recruit phosphatases to down-regulate cell activation, while others may lack
      inhibitory signals and instead activate immune responses. The family also includes
      receptors that participate in platelet adhesion and activation, osteoclast differentiation,
      and mast cell regulation. Collectively, these receptors are crucial for balancing
      immune protection against pathogens with the prevention of autoimmunity.
