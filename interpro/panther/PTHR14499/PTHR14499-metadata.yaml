  description:
  - text: The BTB/POZ domain-containing protein family is involved in a variety of
      cellular functions, including acting as auxiliary subunits of GABA-B receptors,
      influencing the pharmacology and kinetics of receptor responses, and altering
      G-protein signaling. Members of the family are also implicated in the regulation
      of neuronal differentiation, apoptosis, growth arrest, and transcriptional activity,
      particularly in relation to the AP-2 family of transcription factors. Some proteins
      within the family function as substrate-specific adapters for E3 ubiquitin-protein
      ligase complexes, contributing to the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation
      of target proteins. Additionally, certain members antagonize the Hedgehog signaling
      pathway, affecting cell proliferation and differentiation. The family also includes
      proteins that regulate potassium channel activity and are involved in the control
      of excitability of cortical neurons. During embryonic development, some proteins
      interfere with neural crest formation and inhibit AP2 transcriptional activity.
