  name:
    name: Glycerophospholipid acyltransferase
    short: GPL_acyltransferase
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes enzymes with acyltransferase and acetyltransferase
      activities, involved in the biosynthesis and remodeling of various glycerophospholipids.
      They catalyze the transfer of acyl groups to the glycerol backbone of lysophospholipids,
      forming phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and other phospholipids,
      which are essential components of cell membranes. Some members also participate
      in the synthesis of platelet-activating factor, a potent lipid mediator involved
      in inflammatory responses. The family is characterized by a conserved HXXXXD
      motif, which is crucial for their enzymatic activity. These proteins play key
      roles in lipid metabolism, cell membrane maintenance, and signaling, and are
      implicated in physiological processes such as platelet activation and pulmonary
      function.
