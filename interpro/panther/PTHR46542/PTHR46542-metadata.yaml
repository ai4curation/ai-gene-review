  description:
  - text: This family of proteins functions as transcription factors during endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER) stress, regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR). They
      are involved in various developmental processes including cardiac myogenesis,
      hepatogenesis, and the development of secretory tissues. These proteins also
      play roles in B lymphocyte differentiation, immunoglobulin production, and cellular
      responses to ER stress. They contribute to angiogenesis and vascular development,
      modulate insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis, and are implicated in lipid
      metabolism and proteostasis. Additionally, they participate in the unconventional
      splicing of their own mRNA, which is essential for the production of active
      isoforms that can respond to ER stress. They are also involved in the regulation
      of apoptosis, autophagy, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer
      cells. These proteins bind to various elements in gene promoter regions and
      are associated with several signaling pathways, including those mediated by
      PI(3)K, mTORC2, and Akt.
