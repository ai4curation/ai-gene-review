  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes transmembrane adaptors and mediators that
      function as scaffolds for Src-family kinases and other signaling proteins in
      immune cells. They are involved in signaling transduction pathways such as major
      histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) in B cells, enhancing calcium response
      and ERK activity upon stimulation. These proteins also sustain signaling in
      dendritic cells after activation by fungal beta-glucans and act as agonist-inducible
      signaling adapters for various Toll-like receptors, enabling the expression
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, the family encompasses proteins
      that are part of the Bcl-2 family, which are involved in the regulation of apoptosis
      and anoikis through interactions mediated by the BH3 motif. Another member is
      implicated in meiotic processes, particularly in chromosome synapsis and the
      formation of double-strand breaks in spermatocytes.
