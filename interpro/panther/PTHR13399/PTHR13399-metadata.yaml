  name:
    name: Translocon-associated protein gamma
    short: TRAP-gamma
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocon
      complex, where they play a role in calcium binding to the ER membrane. This
      action is crucial for the regulation of the retention of ER resident proteins,
      ensuring proper protein localization and function within the cell. Members of
      this family are characterized by their association with the translocon, a channel
      through which nascent polypeptides enter the ER, and their involvement in maintaining
      calcium homeostasis at the ER membrane.
