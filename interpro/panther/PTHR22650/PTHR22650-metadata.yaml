  description:
  - text: The Platelet Glycoprotein Ib-IX-V Complex family comprises proteins that
      play a crucial role in hemostasis. Members of this family, including GPIb alpha,
      GPIb beta, GPIX, and GPV, form a receptor complex on the surface of platelets.
      This complex binds to von Willebrand factor (vWF), facilitating platelet adhesion
      to damaged blood vessel walls. The interaction is essential for the formation
      of platelet plugs, which are critical in preventing blood loss following vascular
      injury. The GPIb-V-IX complex serves as the vWF receptor and is involved in
      the orientation and membrane insertion of its components, ensuring proper function
      and stability of the receptor on the platelet surface.
