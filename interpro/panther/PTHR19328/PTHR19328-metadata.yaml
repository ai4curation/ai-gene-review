    short: HHIP/PQQ_oxidored_GdhB
  description:
  - text: The HHIP and PQQ oxidoreductase GdhB families include proteins with diverse
      functions. The HHIP family proteins interact with members of the hedgehog family,
      modulating hedgehog signaling in various cell types such as brain and lung,
      and contributing to zinc binding. The PQQ oxidoreductase GdhB family members
      are involved in the oxidation of sugars; for example, they can oxidize glucose
      to gluconolactone and have broad substrate specificity, including aldose sugars
      and oligomeric sugars. Some family members convert L-sorbosone into 2-keto-L-gulonic
      acid, a step in vitamin C biosynthesis.
