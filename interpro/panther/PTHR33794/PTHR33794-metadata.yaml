  description:
  - text: The Peptidase M4 family comprises extracellular zinc metalloproteases involved
      in a variety of biological processes, including pathogenesis, immune evasion,
      and protein activation. Members of this family have been implicated in the degradation
      of various substrates such as gastric mucus, elastin, collagen, and casein,
      which may contribute to ulcer formation, bacterial virulence, and tissue colonization.
      Some family members are known to cleave and activate other proteins, such as
      transglutaminase and cholera enterotoxin, playing roles in bacterial development
      and infection. The proteolytic activity of these enzymes is typically regulated
      by metal chelators, indicating their dependence on metal ions for function.
