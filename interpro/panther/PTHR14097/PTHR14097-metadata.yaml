  description:
  - text: The FMP52 family consists of mitochondrial proteins that are implicated
      in various cellular processes across different species. The human homolog, Oxidoreductase
      HTATIP2, plays a critical role in tumor suppression by functioning as an oxidoreductase.
      It competes with nuclear import substrates for binding to nuclear transport
      receptors in its NADPH-bound form, thereby inhibiting nuclear import. This action
      may serve as a redox sensor linked to transcription regulation. HTATIP2 has
      isoforms with distinct functions; one acts as a metastasis suppressor with proapoptotic
      and antiangiogenic properties, while another has an antiapoptotic effect. The
      unique C-terminus of isoform 2 confers high proteasome-dependent instability.
      Other members of the FMP52 family, found in various fungi, are also mitochondrial
      proteins, but their specific functions are not well characterized. They are,
      however, unified by their similarity to the FMP52 family, suggesting a conserved
      role in mitochondrial biology.
