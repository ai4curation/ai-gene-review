    short: Malonyl-ACP_OMT
  description:
  - text: The Malonyl-ACP O-Methyltransferase family is characterized by enzymes that
      modify malonyl-thioesters, converting the free carboxyl group to its methyl
      ester using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor. This methylation
      step is crucial for the synthesis of pimeloyl-ACP, an intermediate in the fatty
      acid synthetic pathway. Some family members, such as BioHC proteins, have a
      bifunctional role, also participating in the removal of the methyl group from
      pimeloyl-ACP esters, thus completing the pimeloyl moiety. Additionally, a subset
      of proteins within this family, like NDUFAF5, are involved in the assembly of
      mitochondrial complexes, indicating a potential dual functionality with both
      methyltransferase and hydroxylase activities.
