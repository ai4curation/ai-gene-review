  description:
  - text: The DDX6/DHH1 RNA helicase family is involved in various aspects of RNA
      metabolism, including mRNA turnover and decapping. Members of this family play
      a crucial role in the regulation of mRNA stability and availability for translation,
      often by activating the decapping enzyme DCP1. They are implicated in the G1/S
      DNA-damage checkpoint recovery by regulating the translational status of specific
      mRNAs. Some family members are essential for the formation of P-bodies, cytoplasmic
      granules that store translationally inactive mRNAs and prevent their degradation.
      Additionally, certain proteins within this family can repress autophagy under
      nutrient-rich conditions by downregulating the expression of ATG genes. They
      may also participate in translation, mRNA nuclear export, and sporulation. The
      Q motif, characteristic of the DEAD box family, is critical for ATP binding
      and hydrolysis, underpinning the helicase activity.
