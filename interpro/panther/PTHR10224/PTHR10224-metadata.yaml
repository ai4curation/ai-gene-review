  description:
  - text: The GATD3 family proteins are characterized by a glutamine amidotransferase-like
      class 1 domain and are localized to the mitochondria. Members of this family
      are involved in various cellular processes, although specific functions may
      vary among individual proteins. Some family members are implicated in the maintenance
      of mitochondrial morphology and function, such as promoting mitochondrial enlargement
      in a fusion-independent manner. Others may have roles that are not yet fully
      understood or characterized. The peptidase C56 family proteins, which include
      glyoxalase ElbB, display glyoxalase activity, catalyzing the conversion of glyoxal
      to glycolate. This activity suggests a role in detoxifying reactive aldehydes,
      although the primary function may be related to protein deglycase activity,
      similar to other DJ-1 superfamily members. The SCF(FBXL) proteins are involved
      in circadian rhythm regulation, with specific members mediating the ubiquitination
      and stabilization or degradation of CRY proteins, thereby influencing the speed
      and robustness of the circadian clock oscillation.
