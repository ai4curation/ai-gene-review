    name: Little elongation complex subunit 2
    short: LEC_subunit_2
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes subunits of the little elongation complex
      (LEC), which plays a crucial role in the regulation of small nuclear RNA (snRNA)
      gene transcription. The LEC is involved in the transcriptional processes mediated
      by both RNA polymerase II and III, indicating a broad function in the transcriptional
      regulation of snRNA genes, which are essential for RNA splicing and processing.
