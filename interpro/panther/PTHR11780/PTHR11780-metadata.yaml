    short: ComplexI_51kDa_subunit
  description:
  - text: The Complex I 51 kDa subunit family comprises core subunits of the mitochondrial
      membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), which are essential
      for catalyzing electron transfer from NADH to the respiratory chain, with ubiquinone
      or menaquinone as the electron acceptors. These proteins are part of the peripheral
      arm of Complex I, where electrons from NADH are initially accepted by flavin
      mononucleotide (FMN) and subsequently transferred through a series of iron-sulfur
      (Fe-S) clusters to the final acceptor by electron tunneling. This process is
      coupled with proton translocation across the membrane, contributing to the creation
      of a proton gradient that is used for ATP synthesis. The family plays a crucial
      role in cellular energy metabolism and is conserved across a wide range of species.
