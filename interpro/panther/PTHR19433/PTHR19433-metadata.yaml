  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes components of the T cell receptor (TR)
      complex, which are crucial for the adaptive immune response. Members of this
      family are involved in recognizing peptide-major histocompatibility (MH) complexes
      displayed by antigen-presenting cells, a key step for T cell-mediated immunity
      against pathogens. Upon binding to these complexes, the TR proteins initiate
      a cascade of intracellular signaling events that lead to T cell activation and
      differentiation. This signaling involves the phosphorylation of immune receptor
      tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) and the formation of the LAT signalosome,
      which further propagates the signal to activate pathways such as calcium, MAPK
      kinase, and NF-kappa-B. These pathways are essential for gene expression, T
      cell growth, and differentiation. The T cell repertoire is generated through
      V-(D)-J rearrangement in the thymus and is shaped by selection events to produce
      a pool of self-MH restricted, non-autoaggressive T cells. The interaction of
      TR with peptide-MH complexes post-thymus also influences the structural and
      functional avidity of the T cell receptor.
