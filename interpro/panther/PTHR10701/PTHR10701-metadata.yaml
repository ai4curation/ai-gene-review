  description:
  - text: The snRNP SmB/SmN family is involved in the fundamental process of pre-mRNA
      splicing, serving as core components of the spliceosomal U1, U2, U4, and U5
      small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). These snRNPs are essential building
      blocks of the spliceosome, the complex responsible for the removal of introns
      from pre-mRNA. Members of the family participate in the formation of both the
      pre-catalytic spliceosome B complex and the activated spliceosome C complexes.
      They also play roles in the splicing of U12-type introns and in histone pre-mRNA
      3'-end processing as part of the U7 snRNP. Some members may be involved in tissue-specific
      alternative RNA processing events. Additionally, certain proteins within the
      family function as auxiliary components of the N-terminal acetyltransferase
      C (NatC) complex, which catalyzes the acetylation of N-terminal methionine residues
      on nascent polypeptides.
