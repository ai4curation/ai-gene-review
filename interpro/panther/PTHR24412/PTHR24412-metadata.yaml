  description:
  - text: The Kelch-like protein family is characterized by its involvement in various
      cellular processes through the formation of cullin-RING-based BTB-CUL3-RBX1
      (BCR) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. These complexes mediate the ubiquitination
      and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, regulating processes
      such as ion transport, skeletal muscle development, Wnt signaling, ER-Golgi
      transport, and apoptosis. Members of the family act as substrate-specific adapters,
      determining the specificity of the complex for particular substrates. They are
      also involved in the dynamic organization of the actin cytoskeleton, neuronal
      process formation, and differentiation of neural crest cells. Some family members
      function as key sensors of oxidative and electrophilic stress, regulating the
      response to oxidative stress by targeting transcription factors for ubiquitination.
      The family plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding
      to environmental stressors.
