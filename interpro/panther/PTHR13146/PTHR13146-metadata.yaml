  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the transport of solutes across cellular
      membranes, with a specific role in the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane
      potential. Members of this family are implicated in the growth of pancreatic
      ductal adenocarcinoma cells, suggesting a potential involvement in cancer progression.
      Additionally, these proteins may function in the transport of nucleotide-sugars,
      which are essential for various biosynthetic processes within the cell.
