  description:
  - text: The peptidase S8 family, also known as the subtilisin-like protease family,
      consists of serine proteases that exhibit a broad range of functions, primarily
      associated with the proteolytic cleavage of various substrates. Members of this
      family are involved in diverse biological processes, including cholesterol homeostasis,
      protein degradation, nutrient acquisition, pathogenicity, and regulation of
      developmental processes. They are characterized by their ability to cleave after
      hydrophobic or small residues, often requiring Arg or Lys at the P4 position.
      The family includes enzymes that activate transcription factors through regulated
      intramembrane proteolysis, mediate lysosome biogenesis, contribute to virulence
      in pathogenic organisms, and regulate plasma cholesterol levels. The proteolytic
      activity of these enzymes is typically regulated by propeptides, metal ions,
      or specific inhibitors.
