  description:
  - text: The enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase family comprises enzymes that play a crucial
      role in fatty acid metabolism, including the beta-oxidation pathway. Members
      of this family are involved in the hydration of unsaturated enoyl-CoA species
      to 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, as well as the isomerization of cis or trans double bonds
      in enoyl-CoA substrates. These enzymes exhibit substrate specificity, processing
      a range of enoyl-CoA thioesters of varying chain lengths. Some family members
      also participate in the biosynthesis of siderophores, antibiotics, and in the
      metabolism of toxic metabolites. Additionally, they are implicated in the degradation
      of cholesterol, steroids, and other compounds, contributing to diverse metabolic
      processes across different organisms.
