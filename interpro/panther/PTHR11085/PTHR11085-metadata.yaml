    short: NAD-dep_sirtuin_deacylases
  description:
  - text: The sirtuin family of proteins are NAD-dependent deacylases that play crucial
      roles in various cellular processes, including DNA damage repair, telomere maintenance,
      metabolic homeostasis, inflammation, tumorigenesis, aging, and the regulation
      of circadian rhythms. They act by removing acetyl, malonyl, succinyl, and glutaryl
      groups from lysine residues on histones and other proteins, which modulates
      the activities of these proteins. Sirtuins contribute to chromatin silencing,
      cell cycle progression, genomic stability, and energy metabolism by deacetylating
      key transcription factors and coregulators. They serve as sensors of the cellular
      energy state and are involved in the response to metabolic and oxidative stress.
      Additionally, sirtuins regulate the expression of genes involved in apoptosis,
      autophagy, and lipid metabolism.
