    name: Mitochondrial Fe-S cluster assembly factor
    short: Mt_Fe-S_assembly_factor
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins functions as mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster
      assembly factors. They are involved in the insertion of [4Fe-4S] clusters into
      a subset of mitochondrial proteins, such as lipoyl synthase and succinate dehydrogenase.
      These proteins operate in the final step of the Fe-S protein assembly process,
      facilitating the incorporation of the iron-sulfur cluster into the target proteins.
      They are likely to act in conjunction with NFU1 and function downstream of other
      assembly factors like BOL1 and GRX5. The family's role is crucial for the proper
      functioning of mitochondrial proteins that require Fe-S clusters for their enzymatic
      activities.
