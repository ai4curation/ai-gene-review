    name: Cytosolic Iron-Sulfur Protein Assembly CIA1
    short: CIA1
  description:
  - text: The CIA1 family is a group of proteins that play a crucial role in the assembly
      of cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe/S) proteins. These proteins are key components
      of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) complex, which is responsible
      for the incorporation of iron-sulfur clusters into extramitochondrial Fe/S proteins.
      The CIA1 family members are essential for the maturation of these Fe/S proteins,
      which are involved in various cellular processes. Some members of the family
      have been shown to interact with other components of the CIA complex, such as
      CIAO2A or CIAO2B and MMS19, to facilitate the assembly of cytosolic-nuclear
      Fe/S proteins. Additionally, certain CIA1 proteins may have specialized functions,
      such as modulating the transactivation activity of specific transcription factors
      or playing a role in chromosome segregation during mitosis.
