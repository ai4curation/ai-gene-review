  description:
  - text: The MYST family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) plays a crucial role
      in the regulation of gene expression through the acetylation of histone proteins,
      which alters chromatin structure and facilitates transcriptional activation.
      Members of this family are involved in various cellular processes, including
      DNA repair, cell cycle progression, development, and autophagy. They acetylate
      multiple lysine residues on histones H3, H4, and H2A, impacting epigenetic transcription
      initiation and elongation. Some family members also acetylate non-histone proteins,
      influencing activities beyond chromatin remodeling. The family's acetyltransferase
      activity is regulated by phosphorylation, autoacetylation, and interaction with
      other proteins, and can use various acyl-CoA substrates for acetylation, crotonylation,
      and 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, indicating a versatile role in epigenetic and
      metabolic regulation.
