  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the regulation of gene expression
      through the deacetylation of lysine residues on the N-terminal part of core
      histones, leading to epigenetic repression. Members of this family are also
      capable of deacetylating non-histone proteins, influencing various cellular
      processes such as cell cycle progression, developmental events, and transcriptional
      regulation. Some proteins within this family have additional enzymatic activities,
      including the deacetylation of polyamines and other acyl groups from lysine
      residues. They are implicated in diverse biological functions, including muscle
      maturation, circadian rhythm regulation, autophagy, and DNA mismatch repair.
      These proteins form large multiprotein complexes and are often regulated by
      various inhibitors and activators.
