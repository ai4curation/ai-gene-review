    short: Sensor_HK_TwoCompSys
  description:
  - text: The Sensor Histidine Kinase family comprises proteins that function as part
      of two-component regulatory systems, typically involved in environmental signal
      detection and response. These kinases autophosphorylate a conserved histidine
      residue in response to specific stimuli such as oxygen levels, nitrate/nitrite
      presence, or cell wall stress. The phosphoryl group is then transferred to a
      conserved aspartate residue on a response regulator, which modulates gene expression
      to adapt to changing conditions. Functions include regulation of genetic competence,
      sporulation, nitrate/nitrite reduction, biofilm formation, antibiotic response,
      and methanol utilization. Some members also exhibit phosphatase activity, reversing
      the phosphorylation state of the response regulator to modulate the signaling
      pathway.
