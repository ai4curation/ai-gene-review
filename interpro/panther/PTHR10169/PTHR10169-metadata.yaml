    short: DNA_Topoisomerase_II
  description:
  - text: The DNA topoisomerase II family consists of key decatenating enzymes that
      alter DNA topology to control its topological states. These enzymes function
      by transiently breaking and rejoining DNA strands, making double-strand breaks.
      They are essential for processes such as DNA supercoiling, mitosis, meiosis,
      and chromosome segregation. Some family members are involved in regulating transcriptional
      oscillation, B-cell differentiation, circadian rhythm, and chromatin insulator
      complex activity. They are also implicated in the resolution of centromeres
      during mitosis and the removal of cohesin from kinetochores. The family includes
      mitochondrial variants and is inhibited by certain intercalating agents.
