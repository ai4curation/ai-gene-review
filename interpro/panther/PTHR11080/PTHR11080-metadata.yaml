    short: Isochorismatase_Nicotinamidase
  description:
  - text: The Isochorismatase Family Nicotinamidases are enzymes that catalyze the
      deamidation of nicotinamide into nicotinate, a key step in the NAD(+) salvage
      pathway. This reaction is crucial for maintaining cellular NAD(+) levels, which
      is essential for various metabolic processes. Members of the family are also
      involved in the regulation of longevity and stress responses in some organisms
      by modulating the levels of nicotinamide, an inhibitor of sirtuin proteins.
      Additionally, certain family members can activate the antituberculous drug pyrazinamide
      by converting it into its active form, pyrazinoic acid. The family is characterized
      by its similarity to the isochorismatase superfamily and is subject to inhibition
      by various compounds, including heavy metals and NAD derivatives.
