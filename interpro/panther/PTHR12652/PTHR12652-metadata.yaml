    name: Peroxisomal membrane protein 11
    short: Peroxin-11
  description:
  - text: The peroxin-11 family is involved in peroxisomal proliferation, a process
      essential for maintaining the number and function of peroxisomes within the
      cell. Members of this family are known to promote various aspects of peroxisome
      dynamics, including duplication, aggregation, elongation, and division. Some
      proteins within the family may facilitate the recruitment of the dynamin-related
      GTPase DNM1L to the peroxisomal membrane, which is a crucial step in peroxisome
      division. Others are implicated in the binding of coatomer proteins to the peroxisomal
      membrane, contributing to membrane deformation and elongation. The family plays
      a significant role in the regulation of peroxisome size and maintenance, and
      in some cases, is involved in the import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes,
      which is vital for peroxisomal function.
