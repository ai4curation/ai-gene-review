  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes components of the asymmetric unit membrane
      (AUM), a highly specialized biomembrane found in terminally differentiated urothelial
      cells. Members of this family are thought to play a crucial role in the physiology
      of bladder epithelial cells. Their functions may involve regulating the permeability
      of the membrane in superficial umbrella cells or providing stability to the
      apical membrane by facilitating interactions between the AUM and the cytoskeleton.
      These proteins are part of the tetraspanin (TM4SF) family, which is characterized
      by the presence of four transmembrane domains and involvement in various cellular
      processes including cell signaling, adhesion, and migration.
