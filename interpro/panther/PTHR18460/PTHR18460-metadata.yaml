  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the regulation of cellular responses
      to nutrient availability and the DNA damage response. Members function as components
      of complexes such as TORC1, TORC2, and the TTT complex, playing roles in cell
      growth, survival, and chromatin remodeling. They are essential for the stabilization
      of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinase family proteins and
      may assist in their proper folding in conjunction with HSP90. These proteins
      are also crucial for the assembly and maintenance of mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes,
      which are key regulators of cellular metabolism.
