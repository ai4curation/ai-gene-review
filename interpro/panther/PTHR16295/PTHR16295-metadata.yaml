    short: Innate_Immune_Apopt_Reg
  description:
  - text: The protein family is involved in the regulation of innate immune responses
      and apoptosis. Members act as negative feedback regulators, controlling excessive
      immune reactions by modulating pathways such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
      and DDX58/RIG1-like helicases (RLH). They interact with key signaling molecules
      like TRAF6 to attenuate NF-kappa-B activation, and operate downstream from MAVS
      and upstream of NF-kappa-B and IRF3 in the RLH pathway. Additionally, family
      members function as negative regulators of the IAP family, inhibiting anti-caspase
      activity and promoting apoptosis. They induce the cleavage and inactivation
      of BIRC4, mediate TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, and are involved in the mitochondrial
      apoptosis pathway. This includes promoting BAX translocation to mitochondria
      and cytochrome c release. They may also influence the cellular sensitivity to
      TRAIL and act as tumor suppressors by mediating resistance to apoptosis in cancer
      cells.
