  description:
  - text: 'The dihydroorotate dehydrogenase family is involved in the de novo pyrimidine
      biosynthesis pathway. Members of this family catalyze the stereospecific oxidation
      of (S)-dihydroorotate to orotate, a critical step in the production of UMP,
      which is a precursor for all other pyrimidine nucleotides. The enzymes within
      this family are classified into two subfamilies based on their electron acceptors:
      Type 1 subfamily members use NAD(+) as the electron acceptor, while Type 2 subfamily
      members utilize quinone. Some members can also use fumarate as an alternative
      electron acceptor. The activity of these enzymes is essential for the synthesis
      of pyrimidine nucleotides required for DNA and RNA production in organisms.'
