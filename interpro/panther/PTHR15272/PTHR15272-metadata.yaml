    name: Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 Subunit
    short: CAF-1_Subunit
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the assembly of chromatin during
      DNA replication and repair. They form a core component of the CAF-1 complex,
      which is responsible for the initial stages of nucleosome assembly by depositing
      newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 onto replicating DNA. Subsequently, histones
      H2A and H2B are added to complete the formation of the histone octamer. Members
      of this family may also play a role in maintaining heterochromatin structure
      in proliferating cells by targeting newly synthesized chromobox proteins to
      heterochromatic regions during DNA replication. Additionally, some members are
      implicated in various developmental processes and stress responses, indicating
      a broader functional spectrum beyond chromatin assembly.
