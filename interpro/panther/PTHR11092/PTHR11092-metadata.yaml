  description:
  - text: The SDR39U1 subfamily of the NAD(P)-dependent epimerase/dehydratase family
      consists of proteins that are putative NADP-dependent oxidoreductases. These
      proteins are suggested to play roles in various biological processes, including
      acting as positive regulators of chloroplast division in plants, indicating
      a potential involvement at early stages of this process. The family is characterized
      by its ability to catalyze the reversible epimerization and dehydration reactions,
      which are essential for various metabolic pathways. The members of this family
      share a common evolutionary origin and are found across a wide range of organisms,
      including bacteria, plants, and animals, highlighting their fundamental role
      in cellular metabolism.
