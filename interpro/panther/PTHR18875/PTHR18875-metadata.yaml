    short: CEP63
  description:
  - text: The CEP63 family is involved in crucial cellular processes related to the
      structure and function of centrosomes. Members of this family are essential
      for normal spindle assembly and play a pivotal role in mother-centriole-dependent
      centriole duplication, which is critical for cell division. They form a complex
      with other proteins such as CEP152, CDK5RAP2, and WDR62 to recruit CDK2, necessary
      for centriole duplication. Some members are also implicated in the DNA damage
      response, where they are removed from centrosomes following DNA damage, leading
      to spindle assembly inactivation and mitotic progression delay. Additionally,
      certain family members are key structural components of the deuterosome, promoting
      de novo centriole amplification in multiciliated cells, which is essential for
      the formation of multiple centrioles in these specialized cells.
