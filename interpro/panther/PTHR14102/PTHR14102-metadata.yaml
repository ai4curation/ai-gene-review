  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the regulation of asymmetrical cell
      division and cell polarization processes. Members of this family function as
      adapter proteins that are likely to be involved in the formation of epithelial
      tight junctions. They are known to interact with Rho small GTPases and atypical
      protein kinase C proteins through a complex with PARD3, which is important for
      tight junction assembly. Additionally, these proteins are implicated in the
      organization and function of centrosomes, including the recruitment of key proteins
      that control microtubule organization within centrosomes. Some family members
      also play roles in maintaining cell polarity in specific tissues during embryogenesis.
