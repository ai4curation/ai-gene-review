    short: VPS10-sortilin
  description:
  - text: The VPS10-related sortilin family proteins function as sorting receptors
      within the Golgi compartment, essential for the intracellular sorting and delivery
      of soluble vacuolar proteins. They are involved in multiple trafficking cycles
      between the late Golgi and prevacuolar endosome-like compartments. Family members
      like sortilin also act as clearance receptors on the cell surface, mediating
      transport from the Golgi to lysosomes, endosomes, and possibly from the endoplasmic
      reticulum to the Golgi. They play roles in neuronal apoptosis, osteogenic differentiation,
      adipocyte storage vesicle formation, and protection against oxidative stress.
      Some subfamily members are implicated in synaptic plasticity, regulation of
      dendritic spine density, and cell migration, proliferation, and adhesion, contributing
      to processes such as atherosclerosis and renal ion homeostasis.
