    short: Sigma-70_RNA_pol_init_factors
  description:
  - text: The Sigma-70 factor family consists of initiation factors that promote the
      attachment of RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites in the DNA during
      transcription and are subsequently released. Members of this family are involved
      in various cellular processes, including exponential growth, stationary phase,
      stress responses, sporulation, and photosynthetic efficiency in plastids. They
      contain conserved domains that mediate interaction with promoter DNA elements
      and RNA polymerase subunits, facilitating the melting of double-stranded DNA
      and the formation of the transcription bubble. Some sigma factors are also regulated
      by anti-sigma factors and proteases, indicating a complex regulatory network
      that controls their activity. The family includes primary sigma factors responsible
      for the majority of gene transcription during exponential growth, as well as
      specialized sigma factors that regulate gene expression in response to environmental
      changes and cellular differentiation.
