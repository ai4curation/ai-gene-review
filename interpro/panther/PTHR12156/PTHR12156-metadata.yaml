  name:
    name: Pleckstrin homology-like domain-containing protein
    short: PH-like_domain
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that contain a Pleckstrin homology
      (PH) domain, which is known to be involved in binding to phosphoinositides.
      This interaction is important in cellular signaling pathways and membrane dynamics.
      Additionally, some members of this family are implicated in the assembly of
      the postsynaptic apparatus and may contribute to the aggregation of acetyl-choline
      receptors (AChR) at the postsynaptic membrane, suggesting a role in synaptic
      function and neurotransmission.
