    name: Cysteine-rich secretory LCCL domain-containing protein
    short: CRISP-LCCL_domain
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that are known to promote matrix
      assembly. They are characterized by the presence of a cysteine-rich secretory
      LCCL domain. The LCCL domain is implicated in various biological processes,
      including cell adhesion, migration, and the organization of extracellular components.
      Members of this family share a similarity with the CRISP family, suggesting
      a potential role in immune defense, fertility, or pathogen interaction, as CRISP
      proteins are known to function in these areas. However, the full range of functions
      and physiological roles for this protein family remains to be fully elucidated.
