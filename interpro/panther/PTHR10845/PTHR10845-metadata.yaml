  description:
  - text: The Regulator of G-protein Signaling (RGS) family modulates G protein-coupled
      receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways by accelerating the GTPase activity of G
      protein alpha subunits, leading to their inactivation. RGS proteins play critical
      roles in various physiological processes, including sensory perception, cell
      proliferation, and regulation of blood pressure. They are involved in the negative
      regulation of signaling pathways activated by various receptors such as muscarinic
      acetylcholine, dopamine, and angiotensin receptors. RGS proteins also influence
      the activity of potassium channels and other downstream effectors in response
      to GPCR signaling. Some family members are implicated in the regulation of translation,
      chemotaxis, stress responses, and developmental processes. The family includes
      members with specific regulatory functions, such as involvement in phototransduction,
      glucose signaling, and pheromone signaling in yeast. Post-translational modifications
      like phosphorylation and palmitoylation can modulate the activity of certain
      RGS proteins.
