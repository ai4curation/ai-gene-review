    name: Transcription-coupled DNA damage response regulator
    short: TC-DDR_regulator
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the regulation of transcription-coupled
      DNA damage response. Members of this family function by recruiting the ubiquitination
      machinery to RNA polymerase II, facilitating its polyubiquitination, removal,
      and subsequent degradation in cases where transcription-coupled nucleotide excision
      repair mechanisms fail to resolve DNA damage. Additionally, some members are
      implicated in the maintenance and activity of long-term repopulating hematopoietic
      stem cells and the formation of stress granules. Others are known to play a
      role in the nervous system, particularly in controlling copulatory organs during
      courtship. There is also involvement in telomere length regulation and DNA binding.
