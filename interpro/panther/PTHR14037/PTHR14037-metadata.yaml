  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the binding and potential regulation
      of steroids, including non-polar steroids and cholesterol. Members of this family
      are secretory glycoproteins, predominantly expressed in the prostate gland and
      potentially other tissues such as mammary glands. They may play a role in the
      storage and transport of small hydrophobic molecules, and could be implicated
      in the transcriptional regulation of steroid hormones. Some family members are
      known to bind small proline-rich peptides and may interact with chemotherapeutic
      agents, suggesting a possible role in cancer therapy.
