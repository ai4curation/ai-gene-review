  description:
  - text: The HES/HEY protein family includes transcriptional repressors that play
      crucial roles in various developmental processes, including neurogenesis, myogenesis,
      and the regulation of circadian rhythms. Members of this family are characterized
      by their ability to bind DNA on N-box motifs and sometimes E-box motifs, typically
      acting as negative regulators of gene expression. They are involved in the Notch
      signaling pathway, contributing to cell fate determination and maintenance of
      precursor cells. The family is also implicated in cardiovascular development
      and somite segmentation. Key features include a basic helix-loop-helix domain,
      an Orange domain, and a C-terminal WRPW motif that mediates interaction with
      Groucho/TLE corepressors.
