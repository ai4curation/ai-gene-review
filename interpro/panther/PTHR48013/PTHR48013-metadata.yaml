  description:
  - text: The MAP kinase kinase family is a group of dual specificity protein kinases
      that play a pivotal role in signal transduction pathways across various organisms.
      They are involved in the regulation of cellular responses to a wide array of
      stimuli, including environmental stresses, cytokines, and developmental cues.
      Members of this family phosphorylate and activate MAP kinases, mediating processes
      such as stress response, apoptosis, cell proliferation, differentiation, and
      immune responses. They are also essential components in pathways regulating
      plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, coordinating defense mechanisms,
      and modulating gene expression related to stress tolerance. The family exhibits
      a conserved kinase domain essential for their activation by upstream kinases
      and for substrate binding, underscoring their universal function in cell signaling.
