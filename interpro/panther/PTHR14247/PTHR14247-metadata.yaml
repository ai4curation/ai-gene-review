  description:
  - text: This family of proteins functions as adapter molecules in various signaling
      pathways, particularly those involving growth factor receptors. They are involved
      in promoting cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and actin
      cytoskeleton reorganization. These proteins mediate the activation of MAPK signaling
      and DNA synthesis in response to insulin and other stimuli. They also play roles
      in cell adhesion by interacting with phosphorylated proteins and influencing
      integrin-mediated signaling. Additionally, they are implicated in the regulation
      of the cell cycle and may have a role in maintaining the structural integrity
      of the ocular lens. Some family members possess a guanine nucleotide exchange
      factor (GEF) activity for small GTPases, although this function is disputed
      in some studies. They also appear to be involved in the regulation of the immune
      response and the development of specific cell types.
