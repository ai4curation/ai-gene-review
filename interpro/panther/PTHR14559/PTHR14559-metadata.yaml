  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes adapters that play crucial roles in immune
      response signaling. They are involved in the activation of NF-kappa-B and MAP
      kinase pathways following receptor engagements, such as T-cell, B-cell, and
      C-type lectin receptors. These proteins form multiprotein complexes with BCL10
      and MALT1, leading to the activation of transcription factors and inflammatory
      gene expression. They are also responsible for the regulation of antifungal
      immunity, cytokine production, and the development of T helper cells. Members
      of this family are typically maintained in an autoinhibited state and require
      specific signals for activation, which involve homooligomerization and recruitment
      of other signaling components.
