  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is implicated in reproductive biology, with a suggested
      involvement in the process of spermatogenesis. The proteins within this family
      may play a role in the development and maturation of sperm cells, which is critical
      for sexual reproduction in mammals. The exact mechanisms by which these proteins
      contribute to spermatogenesis remain to be fully elucidated, but their association
      with this process indicates a potential regulatory or structural function during
      the formation of spermatozoa.
