  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the processing of RNA molecules.
      Members of this family are endoribonucleases that specifically cleave double-stranded
      RNA, playing a crucial role in various RNA maturation and regulation processes.
      They participate in the formation of mature ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) from primary
      transcripts by cleaving specific sites within the RNA molecule. Additionally,
      they are key players in the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding
      RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. Some family members
      are also implicated in the CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic
      Repeats) immune system, processing CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) which are part of a
      defense mechanism against foreign genetic elements such as viruses and plasmids.
