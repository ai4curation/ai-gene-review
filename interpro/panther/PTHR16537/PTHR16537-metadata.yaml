  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is associated with a variety of cellular functions,
      including potential roles in mitosis and centromere association. Members of
      this family may have antigenic properties and could induce the production of
      anti-centromere antibodies. The precise functions of these proteins may vary
      among different organisms, and some members remain uncharacterized. The family
      is unified by a shared domain, indicating a potential common evolutionary origin
      and possibly conserved functional aspects.
