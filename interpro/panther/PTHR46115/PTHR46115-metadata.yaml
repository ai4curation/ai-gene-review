  description:
  - text: The Thioredoxin family is involved in numerous redox reactions, characterized
      by the reversible oxidation of an active center dithiol to a disulfide, which
      catalyzes dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions. Members of this family play
      crucial roles in various cellular processes, including response to intracellular
      nitric oxide through reversible S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues, inhibition
      of caspase-3 activity via nitrosylation, and stimulation of AP-1 transcriptional
      activity. Additionally, they are involved in the redox regulation of enzymes
      within the Calvin-Benson cycle in plants, and contribute to oxidative stress
      responses, protein folding, and sulfur metabolism. Some members also participate
      in acrosomal biogenesis in sperm, and others may regulate life span, dauer formation,
      and stress responses in model organisms.
