  description:
  - text: The zinc finger protein family is characterized by the presence of zinc
      finger motifs, which are small protein domains that can coordinate one or more
      zinc ions to stabilize their folds. Members of this family are predominantly
      involved in transcriptional regulation, with many acting as transcription factors
      that bind DNA and regulate the expression of target genes. Functions of these
      proteins include roles in development, cell differentiation, immune response,
      and maintenance of cell identity. Some family members possess histone methyltransferase
      activity, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression. The diversity
      of zinc finger domains, such as C2H2-type, allows for a wide range of DNA-binding
      specificities and regulatory functions.
