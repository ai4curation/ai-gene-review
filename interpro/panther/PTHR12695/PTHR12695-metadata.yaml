    short: GTF2H2
  description:
  - text: The GTF2H2 family is involved in essential cellular processes including
      general and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (NER) and RNA transcription
      by RNA polymerase II. Members of the family are components of the general transcription
      and DNA repair factor IIH (TFIIH) core complex. During NER, GTF2H2 family proteins
      contribute to DNA opening around lesions, facilitating the excision and replacement
      of damaged DNA. In transcription initiation, the family plays a crucial role
      in promoter opening and escape following the establishment of the pre-initiation
      complex (PIC). Additionally, the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II's C-terminal
      tail by the CAK kinase module is a key step controlled by GTF2H2 family members
      for initiating transcription. Some members can restore UV resistance in certain
      yeast mutants, highlighting their functional conservation and importance in
      DNA repair mechanisms.
