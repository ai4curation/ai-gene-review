  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in cellular protection against oxidative
      stress and the regulation of redox-related calcium homeostasis. Members of this
      family are known to protect the calcium pump ATP2A2 from oxidative damage mediated
      by the oxidoreductase ERO1A, thus maintaining calcium levels within the endoplasmic
      reticulum. They also serve as modulators of ryanodine receptor activity, influencing
      calcium mobilization essential for muscle development and differentiation. Additionally,
      these proteins are crucial for muscle regeneration and the maintenance of satellite
      cells in skeletal muscle. The N-terminal region of these proteins contains a
      signal for endoplasmic reticulum addressing and retention.
