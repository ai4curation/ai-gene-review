  description:
  - text: The archaeal Rpo3/eukaryotic RPB3 RNA polymerase subunit family includes
      proteins that are essential components of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which
      are responsible for the transcription of DNA into RNA using ribonucleoside triphosphates.
      Members of this family are involved in the synthesis of mRNA precursors, functional
      non-coding RNAs, ribosomal RNA precursors, and small RNAs such as 5S rRNA, snRNAs,
      tRNAs, and miRNAs. They play a role in the assembly of the RNA polymerase complex,
      with some members containing an iron-sulfur cluster essential for this process.
      Additionally, certain subunits are implicated in transcription termination and
      RNA-directed DNA methylation-dependent transcriptional gene silencing of repeated
      sequences, including transposable elements. This family is characterized by
      a core element with a large central cleft and a clamp element that moves to
      open and close the cleft, indicating a role in the structural dynamics of the
      RNA polymerase during transcription.
