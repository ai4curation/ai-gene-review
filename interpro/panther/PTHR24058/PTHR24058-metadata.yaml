  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes serine/threonine and dual-specificity kinases
      that play roles in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation,
      DNA damage repair, transcription regulation, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal organization.
      Some members are involved in pre-mRNA splicing and stress responses, while others
      function in developmental processes such as neuronal growth, eye size regulation,
      and erythroid differentiation. These kinases can phosphorylate a range of substrates,
      including transcription factors, histones, and other kinases, influencing their
      activity, stability, and localization. They are also implicated in signaling
      pathways related to stress granule dynamics, mTORC1 signaling, and proteasomal
      degradation of key regulatory proteins.
