  description:
  - text: The JAK family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases is pivotal in signal transduction
      for various cellular processes including growth, development, differentiation,
      and immune response. Members of the family associate with cytokine receptors,
      phosphorylating them upon ligand binding, which creates docking sites for STAT
      proteins. These STAT proteins are then phosphorylated, dimerize, and translocate
      to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription. The family plays roles in both
      innate and adaptive immunity, hematopoiesis, and cell cycle regulation. They
      are involved in signaling pathways for type I and type II receptors, mediating
      responses to growth factors, cytokines, and interferons. The JAK kinases also
      have regulatory domains that modulate their activity, with some acting as pseudokinases.
