    name: WD repeat creC family regulators
    short: WD_repeat_creC_regulators
  description:
  - text: The WD repeat creC family is involved in the regulation of carbon source
      utilization and protein stability through ubiquitination and deubiquitination
      processes. Members of the family function as components of a regulatory network
      that includes creA, creB, creC, creD, and acrB. They are essential for preventing
      the proteolysis of deubiquitinating enzymes such as CreB in the absence of carbon
      catabolite repression. By stabilizing CreB in a complex with CreC, they facilitate
      the expression of genes in specific metabolic pathways, including those for
      proline and quinate. Additionally, some family members act as regulators of
      deubiquitinating complexes, promoting the enzymatic activity of USP12 and other
      similar enzymes, and are involved in the localization and activity of deubiquitinating
      enzymes at specific cellular sites.
