    name: Mitochondrial Quality Control and Scaffold Kinases
    short: MitoQC_Scaffold_Kinases
  description:
  - text: The protein family includes both catalytically inactive kinases acting as
      scaffold proteins and active serine/threonine-protein kinases involved in mitochondrial
      quality control. The inactive kinases function as effectors of small GTPases,
      regulate cell morphology and motility, and coactivate Notch signaling. The active
      kinases protect against mitochondrial dysfunction by phosphorylating mitochondrial
      proteins, coordinating removal and replacement of damaged components, and facilitating
      mitophagy. They also regulate mitochondrial dynamics, promote mitochondrial
      fission, and are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and localized repair.
