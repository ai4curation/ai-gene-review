  description:
  - text: The CEP152 family is involved in centrosome duplication and centriole formation.
      Members act as molecular scaffolds, facilitating interactions between key molecules
      such as PLK4 and CENPJ. They are essential for recruiting CDK2, which is required
      for centriole duplication. The family also plays a significant role in deuterosome-mediated
      centriole amplification in multiciliated cells, enabling the generation of over
      100 centrioles. Overexpression of CEP152 family members can induce centriole
      amplification. In contrast, the SHC family members function as signaling adapters,
      coupling activated growth factor receptors to various signaling pathways. They
      are involved in pathways initiated by receptors like KIT and TEK/TIE2, influencing
      processes such as endothelial cell migration, sprouting angiogenesis, and neuron
      signaling. Specific members also activate Ras-dependent and independent pathways
      and contribute to stress response signaling.
