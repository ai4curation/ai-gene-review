  description:
  - text: The succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase iron-sulfur protein family
      includes iron-sulfur protein (IP) subunits of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)
      and fumarate reductase (FRD), which are involved in complex II of the mitochondrial
      electron transport chain. SDH subunits transfer electrons from succinate to
      ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) during aerobic metabolism, while FRD subunits catalyze
      the reduction of fumarate using various electron donors in anaerobic conditions.
      The family plays a crucial role in the interconversion of succinate and fumarate,
      contributing to cellular respiration and energy production.
