    name: COP9 signalosome complex subunit 3
    short: CSN3
  description:
  - text: The COP9 signalosome complex subunit 3 (CSN3) family is involved in various
      cellular and developmental processes. Members of the CSN3 family are essential
      components of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex, which regulates the ubiquitin
      (Ubl) conjugation pathway. The CSN complex mediates the deneddylation of cullin
      subunits in SCF-type E3 ligase complexes, modulating their Ubl ligase activity.
      This action is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis by controlling the
      degradation of proteins. The CSN3 family also plays a role in the phosphorylation
      of key proteins such as p53/TP53 and c-jun/JUN, potentially through association
      with kinases like CK2 and PKD. This phosphorylation can promote or protect against
      protein degradation. Additionally, the CSN3 family is implicated in various
      processes including photomorphogenesis, circadian clock regulation, embryogenesis,
      oogenesis, and responses to auxin and jasmonate in plants.
