  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that are involved in cell adhesion,
      cell-cell interactions, and angiogenesis inhibition. Some proteins in this family
      act as angiogenesis inhibitors, potentially influencing various angiogenesis
      processes. They may also function as orphan G-protein coupled receptors that
      activate transcription factors through specific signaling pathways, contributing
      to the regulation of angiogenesis. The family contains proteins with a C-terminal
      AMOP domain, which is important for their anti-angiogenic function. Additionally,
      receptor activity within this family is regulated by proteolytic processing,
      which can modulate the signaling activity of these proteins.
