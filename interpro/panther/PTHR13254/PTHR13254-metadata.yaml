  name:
    name: Ras-specific palmitoyltransferase complex
    short: Ras_palmitoyltransferase
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes palmitoyltransferases that are involved
      in the post-translational modification of Ras proteins, which is crucial for
      their proper localization to the plasma membrane and subsequent function in
      cell signaling. Members of this family form complexes, such as ERF2-ERF4 in
      yeast and ZDHHC9-GOLGA7 in mammals, which specifically palmitoylate Ras proteins
      like RAS2, HRAS, and NRAS. This modification is essential for the anchoring
      of these Ras proteins to the plasma membrane, where they participate in signal
      transduction pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation. Some family
      members are also implicated in protein transport from the Golgi apparatus to
      the cell surface and may play roles in cell adhesion.
