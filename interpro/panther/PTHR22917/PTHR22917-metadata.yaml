    name: Heme transport and cell adhesion protein
    short: Heme_transport/Cell_adhesion
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that are involved in various biological
      processes, including the transport and breakdown of heme, cell adhesion, spreading,
      and inhibition of the membrane-damaging effect of the terminal cytolytic complement
      pathway. Some family members bind heme and transport it to the liver for iron
      recovery, while others are involved in cell-to-substrate adhesion and interact
      with glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and certain integrins. Additionally,
      some proteins in this family have been identified as inhibitors of proteases
      and play roles in boundary lubrication within articulating joints, preventing
      protein deposition onto cartilage from synovial fluid.
