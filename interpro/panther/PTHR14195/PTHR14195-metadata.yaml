  description:
  - text: This family of proteins appears to be primarily involved in the process
      of splicing, with several members having annotations suggesting a role in this
      fundamental aspect of gene expression. Splicing is a critical step in the post-transcriptional
      modification of RNA, where introns are removed and exons are joined to form
      a mature messenger RNA molecule. Some family members are noted to potentially
      influence the splicing mechanism, with overexpression affecting the suppression
      of splicing defects in certain mutants. Additionally, one member is described
      to enhance the ATPase activity of another protein in vitro, indicating a possible
      regulatory function in ATP-dependent molecular processes. Another protein within
      the family is implicated in meiosis and sporulation, suggesting a broader range
      of biological activities.
