  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the first step of the citric acid
      cycle, catalyzing the condensation of oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA to form citrate
      and coenzyme A. Members of this family are essential for energy production and
      carbon metabolism. Some proteins in this family are known to be allosterically
      regulated by metabolites such as NADH and ATP, which indicates a role in regulating
      the pace of the citric acid cycle in response to cellular energy levels.
