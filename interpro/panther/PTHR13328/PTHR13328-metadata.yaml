    name: Negative elongation factor A domain-containing protein
    short: NELF-A_domain
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the regulation of transcription elongation
      by RNA polymerase II. Members of this family are essential components of the
      NELF complex, which interacts with the DSIF complex to induce transcriptional
      pausing. This action is antagonized by the P-TEFb kinase complex. The presence
      of an HDAg-like domain within these proteins is crucial for their role in transcriptional
      repression and their interaction with the RNA polymerase II complex. Additionally,
      these proteins have been implicated in playing a role in HIV-1 latency, potentially
      through the recruitment of PCF11 to paused RNA polymerase II. In Drosophila,
      the family member is also critical for postembryonic development.
