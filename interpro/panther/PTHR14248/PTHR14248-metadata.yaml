  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes regulatory subunits of cyclin-dependent
      kinases (CDKs), which are involved in cell cycle regulation and signal transduction
      pathways. Members of this family are known to interact with specific CDKs, such
      as CDK14 and CDK16, and play a role in the Wnt signaling pathway during the
      G2/M phase of the cell cycle. They are involved in processes such as the phosphorylation
      of key signaling molecules and the recruitment of CDKs to the plasma membrane.
      Some members are implicated in the regulation of synaptic vesicle trafficking
      and synapse formation in neurons. The family also includes proteins that may
      be involved in sterol transfer between intracellular membranes.
