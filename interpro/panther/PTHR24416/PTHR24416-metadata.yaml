  description:
  - text: The receptor tyrosine kinase family plays a crucial role in various cellular
      processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis.
      They act as cell-surface receptors for various ligands, such as fibroblast growth
      factors, insulin, and other growth factors, triggering intracellular signaling
      cascades that regulate embryonic development, the immune response, and the nervous
      system. Mutations or aberrant activation can lead to diseases like cancer. They
      are involved in angiogenesis, skeletal development, and maintaining vascular
      stability.
