  description:
  - text: The SOX family of transcription factors is characterized by the presence
      of a high-mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding domain and plays a pivotal role in
      the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of cell fate.
      Members of the family are involved in a variety of biological processes, including
      neural crest formation, chondrogenesis, and the development of the central nervous
      system and glia. They are known to bind specific DNA motifs to activate gene
      expression related to myelination, cartilage formation, and the development
      of various cell lineages, such as chondrocytes and neural crest-derived cells.
      The family's activity is modulated by transactivation domains, such as TAM,
      TAC, and the 9aaTAD motif, which interact with transcriptional coactivators
      and the basal transcriptional machinery to induce gene transactivation.
