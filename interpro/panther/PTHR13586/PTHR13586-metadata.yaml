  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability
      and translation. Members are essential for the formation of P-bodies, cytoplasmic
      structures that serve as storage sites for translationally inactive mRNAs, thereby
      protecting them from degradation. These proteins act as repressors of mRNA translation
      and are implicated in various cellular processes, including oocyte meiotic maturation,
      embryonic expression modulation, and mitotic spindle assembly. Some family members
      are associated with RNA granule assembly and may function in mRNA gene silencing.
      The LSM14 domain and RGG repeats are common structural features that contribute
      to their role in mRNA metabolism and localization within the cell.
