  description:
  - text: The CREG family proteins are implicated in the transcriptional control of
      cell growth and differentiation. Members of the CREG family may antagonize transcriptional
      activation and cellular transformation by the adenovirus E1A protein. The transcriptional
      control activity related to cell growth requires interaction with IGF2R. Additionally,
      one member of the family is involved in the regulation of glutamyl-tRNA reductase,
      which is crucial for the synthesis of 5-aminolevulinate, a precursor in heme
      and chlorophyll biosynthesis, suggesting a role in heme metabolism and photosynthetic
      electron transport in chloroplasts.
