  description:
  - text: The protein family includes serine/threonine kinases that play key roles
      in various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, cell structure,
      proliferation, apoptosis, migration, adhesion, and transcription regulation.
      They are involved in signaling pathways that control organ size, tumor suppression,
      and cellular responses to stress and external stimuli. Members of this family
      phosphorylate a range of substrates, modulating their activity and localization,
      which is crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and responding to environmental
      changes. They are also implicated in the regulation of metabolic pathways, immune
      responses, and developmental processes.
