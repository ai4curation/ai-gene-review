  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is implicated in calcium-dependent processes that
      lead to the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of various target proteins.
      They are thought to act as molecular bridges within ubiquitin E3 complexes,
      facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 enzymes to substrates. A key
      role of these proteins includes the regulation of beta-catenin levels through
      its ubiquitin-mediated degradation pathway, which is crucial for cell signaling
      and homeostasis.
