  description:
  - text: The Phosphate Acetyltransferase and Butyryltransferase family comprises
      enzymes involved in acetate metabolism, catalyzing the reversible interconversion
      of acetyl-CoA and acetyl phosphate, as well as the conversion of butyryl-CoA
      to butyrate via butyryl phosphate. These enzymes play a key role in the energy
      metabolism and regulation of acetylation potential in various bacteria. Members
      of the family are characterized by a conserved C-terminal substrate-binding
      site and an N-terminal region important for quaternary structure. Some family
      members are also involved in the metabolism of ethanolamine, propionate, and
      1,2-propanediol, contributing to bacterial survival and pathogenicity.
