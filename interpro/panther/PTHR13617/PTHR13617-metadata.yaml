  name:
    name: AB hydrolase domain-containing protein
    short: AB_hydrolase
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is part of the AB hydrolase superfamily, which is
      characterized by a wide range of enzymes that typically perform hydrolysis reactions
      involving the cleavage of carbon-nitrogen bonds. Members of this family are
      likely to share a common structural fold, the alpha/beta hydrolase fold, which
      is a core structure consisting of parallel beta-sheets flanked by alpha helices.
      The enzymes in this superfamily are involved in various biological processes,
      including lipid metabolism, nerve function, and the degradation of environmental
      pollutants. Given the broad substrate specificity and reaction types catalyzed
      by AB hydrolases, the specific functions of these proteins may vary, but they
      are generally expected to contribute to metabolic and regulatory pathways by
      catalyzing the hydrolysis of ester, amide, or other bonds in a range of substrates.
