  description:
  - text: The protein family is involved in various cellular processes including cell
      polarization, division, and bud site selection. Members anchor regulatory subunits
      of protein kinase A (PKA) to mitochondria or the plasma membrane, potentially
      influencing apoptosis through BAD phosphorylation and inactivation. They may
      also facilitate PKA and G protein signal transduction by assembling multiprotein
      complexes and interacting with G-alpha proteins, linking signaling machinery
      to kinases. Additionally, they play a role in establishing bipolar budding patterns
      and localizing budding landmarks in yeast.
