    name: Cysteine desulfurase
    short: Cys_desulfurase
  description:
  - text: The cysteine desulfurase family is responsible for the initial step in the
      biosynthesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, which are essential cofactors for
      a variety of enzymes. These enzymes catalyze the removal of elemental sulfur
      from cysteine, producing alanine and a persulfide intermediate. The sulfur is
      then transferred to scaffold proteins such as IscU for Fe-S cluster assembly.
      Members of this family also participate in tRNA modification, cofactor biosynthesis,
      and may function in selenium metabolism for selenophosphate synthesis. The activity
      of these enzymes is crucial for mitochondrial metabolism and tRNA-processing,
      highlighting their fundamental role in cellular biochemistry.
