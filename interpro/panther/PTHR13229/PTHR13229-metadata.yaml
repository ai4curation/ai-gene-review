  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the early part of the secretory pathway.
      Members of this family are characterized by their role in the transport of proteins
      from the endoplasmic reticulum towards the Golgi apparatus, which is a critical
      step in the secretion of proteins and their delivery to their proper cellular
      destinations. The proteins within this family share a commonality in function
      across various species, indicating a conserved role in cellular physiology and
      the maintenance of proper protein distribution within the cell.
