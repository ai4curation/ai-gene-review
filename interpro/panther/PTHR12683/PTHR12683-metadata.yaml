  description:
  - text: The RNA polymerase II transcription factor B subunit 3 and CDK-activating
      kinase assembly factor MAT1 family is involved in essential cellular processes,
      including basal and activated transcription, and nucleotide excision repair
      (NER) of damaged DNA. Members of the family act as components of the general
      transcription and DNA repair factor IIH (TFIIH), which possesses CTD kinase
      and DNA-dependent ATPase activities. The family also includes proteins that
      stabilize the cyclin H-CDK7 complex, forming a functional CDK-activating kinase
      (CAK) enzymatic complex. CAK activates various cyclin-associated kinases and
      is involved in cell cycle control. When complexed with core-TFIIH, CAK activates
      RNA polymerase II, facilitating transcriptional elongation.
