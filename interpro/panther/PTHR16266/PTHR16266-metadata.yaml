    name: Bromodomain and WD repeat-containing
    short: Bromo_WD_repeat
  description:
  - text: The Bromodomain and WD repeat-containing protein family is involved in various
      cellular processes including the regulation of cell morphology, cytoskeletal
      organization, and control of cell shape. Members of this family may function
      as transcriptional activators and could be implicated in chromatin remodeling.
      Some proteins within this family are likely to play a role in signaling pathways
      related to insulin and insulin-like growth factor, stimulating cell proliferation
      through cyclin transcription and possessing anti-apoptotic activity via AKT1
      phosphorylation and activation.
