  description:
  - text: The FOXO family of transcription factors plays a crucial role in regulating
      metabolic homeostasis, cell cycle, and longevity across various species. These
      proteins are key targets of insulin signaling and respond to oxidative stress.
      They bind to specific DNA elements to regulate gene expression, influencing
      processes such as apoptosis, autophagy, gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism, and
      immune responses. In muscle, they promote proteolysis during starvation. In
      the skeleton, they control bone mass and chondrogenic commitment. FOXO factors
      also modulate cell death pathways and are involved in the regulation of adipocyte
      differentiation and size. Their activity is modulated by post-translational
      modifications and subcellular localization in response to environmental cues.
