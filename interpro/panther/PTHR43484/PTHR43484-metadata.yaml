    name: Flagellar motor switch protein FliN/MopA/SpaO
    short: FliN/MopA/SpaO
  description:
  - text: The FliN/MopA/SpaO family comprises proteins that are integral components
      of the flagellar motor switch complex, also known as the C ring, which is essential
      for bacterial motility. Members of this family, including FliN, are involved
      in forming the complex at the base of the basal body. The switch complex is
      responsible for interacting with chemotaxis proteins such as CheY and CheZ,
      and it plays a crucial role in determining the direction of flagellar rotation.
      This interaction is a key part of the bacterial chemotaxis system, allowing
      bacteria to navigate their environment by moving toward favorable conditions
      and away from harmful ones.
