  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in various cellular processes including
      cell-matrix adhesion, cell motility, and cell proliferation. Some members play
      a crucial role during prometaphase of cell division by ensuring centrosome maturation,
      which is vital for proper chromosome segregation. They facilitate the translocation
      of scaffold proteins to the centrosomes, aiding in the formation of microtubules.
      Other members are implicated in the regulation of cell-matrix interactions and
      may act to suppress cell growth by inhibiting proliferation. The cytoplasmic
      domain of some proteins within this family is particularly significant in controlling
      adhesion and motility.
