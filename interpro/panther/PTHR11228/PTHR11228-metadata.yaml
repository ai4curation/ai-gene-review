    name: Radical SAM superfamily enzymes
    short: Radical_SAM_sf_enzymes
  description:
  - text: The Radical SAM superfamily is a diverse group of enzymes that perform a
      wide range of functions, all of which involve radical-based mechanisms. Members
      of this superfamily are characterized by their use of a [4Fe-4S] cluster to
      reductively cleave S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to initiate radical formation.
      Functions within this family include the biosynthesis of various cofactors,
      modification of tRNA and rRNA, biotin synthesis, lipid metabolism, and the generation
      of radical species for use in various enzymatic transformations. Notable reactions
      catalyzed by these enzymes include the formation of thioether bonds, oxidative
      decarboxylations, and the generation of complex organic molecules. The family
      is essential for the biosynthesis of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), mycofactocin,
      heme d1, and other modified biomolecules, highlighting its critical role in
      microbial metabolism and physiology.
