    name: NADH dehydrogenase accessory subunit
    short: NDUFC2_accessory_subunit
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes accessory subunits of the mitochondrial
      membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase, also known as Complex I. These
      subunits are not directly involved in the catalytic activity of the enzyme but
      are essential for the assembly of the complex. Complex I plays a critical role
      in cellular respiration by transferring electrons from NADH to the respiratory
      chain, with ubiquinone serving as the immediate electron acceptor. The proper
      function of these proteins is crucial for the efficient production of ATP through
      oxidative phosphorylation.
