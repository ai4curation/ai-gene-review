  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes dual-specificity phosphatases with roles
      in dephosphorylating proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine, serine, and threonine
      residues. They also function as lipid phosphatases, targeting the D3 position
      of the inositol ring in various phosphatidylinositols, with a preference for
      phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. These activities are crucial for regulating
      signaling pathways such as the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway, influencing cell cycle
      progression, cell survival, migration, and apoptosis. Some family members are
      involved in energy metabolism, synaptic function, and neurogenesis. They may
      also act as negative regulators of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism.
      The family's role is significant in various cellular processes, including development,
      chemotaxis, and cytoskeletal organization.
