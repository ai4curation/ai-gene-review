  description:
  - text: The protein family includes serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases that play
      crucial roles in cell cycle regulation, stress response, and translation initiation.
      Members of the family negatively regulate the transition from G2 to M phase
      in mitosis by phosphorylating CDK1, thus preventing premature mitotic entry.
      They are also involved in meiotic arrest and exit during oocyte maturation.
      Additionally, some family members sense metabolic stress and activate the integrated
      stress response by phosphorylating EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha, leading to global protein
      synthesis inhibition and preferential translation of stress response mRNAs.
      This response is crucial for cellular adaptation to conditions such as amino
      acid starvation, unfolded protein response, and heme deficiency. The family
      also includes kinases that regulate the immune response to viral infection by
      phosphorylating EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha, contributing to antiviral defense mechanisms.
