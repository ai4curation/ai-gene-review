  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes enzymes with phosphatase activity, particularly
      towards phosphorylated steroid compounds and protein tyrosine residues. Members
      are involved in the regulation of receptor-type tyrosine kinases, influencing
      cell surface receptor accumulation and down-regulation. Some proteins in this
      family exhibit tyrosine phosphatase activity towards a variety of substrates,
      including EGFR and ZAP70, and may also regulate proteins modified by ubiquitination.
      Additionally, certain family members have been shown to possess steroid phosphatase
      activity, catalyzing the conversion of inactive phosphorylated ecdysteroids
      into their active forms, which is essential for certain developmental processes.
      The family also includes proteins with SH3 domains that may interact with dynamin
      and potentially inhibit endocytic pathways.
