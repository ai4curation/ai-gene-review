  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in various cellular processes related
      to centrosome function and ciliogenesis. Members of this family are essential
      for the proper formation and anchoring of the mitotic spindle to centrosomes
      during cell division. They are required for the localization of specific centriole
      satellite proteins to the centrosome, which is crucial for maintaining normal
      mitotic spindle morphology. Additionally, these proteins play a role in the
      biogenesis of cilia by participating in the removal of certain protein complexes
      from the mother centriole and facilitating the formation of ciliary vesicles.
      They are also implicated in the docking of vesicles to the basal body, a step
      necessary for ciliogenesis, potentially aiding the docking of vesicles containing
      specific small GTPases.
