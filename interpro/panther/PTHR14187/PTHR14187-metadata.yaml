    name: Heat shock 70 kDa adapter protein
    short: HSP70_adapter
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that function as adapter proteins
      for SORL1, influencing its internalization and subcellular localization. They
      are part of the heat shock protein 70 family, which are molecular chaperones
      involved in the folding and assembly of proteins, protection of cells from stress,
      and facilitation of protein degradation. These proteins may play a role in protein-protein
      interactions, guiding the correct folding or maintaining proteins in a state
      competent for subsequent folding or refolding under stress conditions.
