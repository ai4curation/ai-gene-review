    name: Major facilitator superfamily MFSD6
    short: MFS_MFSD6
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is part of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS),
      which is one of the largest groups of secondary transporters. Members of this
      family are involved in a diverse range of functions, typically concerning the
      transport of small solutes across cellular membranes in response to chemiosmotic
      gradients. The MFSD6 subgroup within this family appears to be evolutionarily
      conserved across various species. Although specific functions for all members
      of this subgroup are not detailed, at least one member is known to interact
      with MHC class I molecules, suggesting a potential role in immune response or
      antigen presentation. The diversity of the major facilitator superfamily indicates
      that other members of the MFSD6 subgroup may have distinct physiological roles
      related to membrane transport.
