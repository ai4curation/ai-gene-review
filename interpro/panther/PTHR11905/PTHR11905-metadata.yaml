  description:
  - text: The venom metalloproteinase (M12B) family comprises zinc metalloproteases
      found in snake venoms. These enzymes exhibit a range of biological activities,
      including the inhibition of platelet aggregation, fibrinogenolysis, and induction
      of hemorrhage. They act on various substrates such as fibrinogen, collagen,
      and integrins, affecting hemostasis and contributing to the venom's toxicity.
      Some family members also possess disintegrin domains that can bind to and inhibit
      integrins, interfering with cell adhesion, migration, and platelet function.
      The family plays roles in prey immobilization and digestion, and some members
      are involved in pathological processes like inflammation and tumor progression.
