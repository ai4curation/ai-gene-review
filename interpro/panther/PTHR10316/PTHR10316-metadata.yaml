  description:
  - text: This family of proteins acts as scaffolding molecules at cell-cell junctions,
      including synaptic junctions, where they assemble neurotransmitter receptors
      and cell adhesion proteins. They are involved in various signaling pathways,
      such as activin-mediated signaling in neuronal cells and receptor-mediated endocytosis
      required for ciliogenesis. Members of this family cooperate with PTEN to regulate
      AKT1 kinase activity and are implicated in the trafficking of growth factors
      to the cell surface. They also modulate the JNK signaling cascade and are involved
      in the regulation of acid-induced ion currents at the cell surface.
