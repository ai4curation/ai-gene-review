  description:
  - text: The protein family includes cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules
      with diverse roles in cell-cell interactions, signaling, and inflammatory responses.
      Members of the family mediate heterotypic and homotypic cell-cell contacts,
      often through interactions with specific ligands such as CD6 or laminin. They
      are involved in various physiological processes including T-cell activation,
      hematopoiesis, endothelial cell migration, and vascular tissue cohesion. Some
      members act as pattern recognition receptors, sensing stress signals and mediating
      pro-inflammatory responses through NF-kappa-B activation. They also play roles
      in neural development, tumor spread, and endothelial permeability. The family's
      involvement in pathfinding for axons and retinal ganglion cells highlights its
      significance in neural network formation.
