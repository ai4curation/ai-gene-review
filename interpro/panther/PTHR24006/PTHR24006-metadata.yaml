    short: Peptidase_C19
  description:
  - text: The peptidase C19 family, also known as ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolases,
      encompasses deubiquitinating enzymes that play crucial roles in various cellular
      processes by removing ubiquitin from specific proteins and polyubiquitin chains.
      These enzymes are involved in the regulation of protein turnover, DNA damage
      repair, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, immune response, and signal transduction
      pathways such as Wnt and TGF-beta/BMP. They function by processing ubiquitin
      precursors, recycling ubiquitin molecules, editing polyubiquitin chains, and
      preventing proteasomal degradation of substrates. Some family members are also
      implicated in the regulation of mitophagy, endosomal protein recycling, and
      maintenance of circadian rhythm. The family includes enzymes that act as tumor
      suppressors, regulators of cell growth and differentiation, and modulators of
      inflammatory and antiviral responses.
