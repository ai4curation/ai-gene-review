  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that are implicated in synaptic
      processes such as the uptake of synaptic material during synapse remodeling
      and the clustering of AMPA glutamate receptors at excitatory synapses. Some
      family members are thought to play a role in long-term plasticity and may bind
      to specific matrices in a calcium-dependent manner. Additionally, certain proteins
      within this family are suggested to have immunological functions that could
      be analogous to those of immunoglobulins.
