    name: Iron-sulfur cluster assembly LYR protein
    short: ISC_assembly_LYR
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S)
      clusters, which are essential cofactors for a variety of cellular enzymes. Members
      of this family act as stabilizing factors in the core iron-sulfur cluster (ISC)
      assembly complex. They regulate the activity of the cysteine desulfurase NFS1,
      in association with NDUFAB1, and participate in the assembly of [2Fe-2S] clusters
      on the scaffold protein ISCU. This process involves the initial production of
      persulfide by the NFS1:LYRM4:NDUFAB1 complex, which is then delivered to ISCU.
      The assembly of the [2Fe-2S] cluster is further facilitated by FDX2, which provides
      reducing equivalents. Subsequently, the assembled [2Fe-2S] cluster is transferred
      to various chaperone proteins. These proteins may also play a role in iron-sulfur
      protein biogenesis in the cytoplasm.
