  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that are involved in various cellular
      processes, including cell adhesion, cell cycle regulation, and cell-extracellular
      matrix interactions. Some proteins in this family are essential for the organization
      of cellular junctions and the maintenance of barrier functions in epithelial
      tissues. Others have roles in the protection and renewal of epithelial surfaces,
      as well as in differentiation. Certain family members are implicated in tumor
      suppression and may influence cancer cell proliferation through interactions
      with growth factor receptors, leading to cell cycle arrest and modulation of
      apoptosis. The family also contains proteins that are important for the structural
      integrity of basement membranes and may participate in cell-matrix signaling
      pathways.
