  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in various aspects of RNA processing
      and DNA damage response. Members play a role in pre-mRNA splicing, particularly
      in the excision of introns with certain features, such as weak 3'-splice sites
      and high GC content. They are implicated in ribosome biogenesis through the
      cleavage of rRNA precursors, mediated by specific binding to non-coding RNAs
      like snoRNAs. Additionally, these proteins contribute to the maintenance of
      genomic integrity by inhibiting translesion DNA synthesis, a process that counteracts
      replication stress caused by DNA damage, such as that induced by ultraviolet
      light. This inhibition is achieved by preventing the monoubiquitination of proliferating
      cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a key factor in DNA replication and repair. The
      family includes proteins with domains that suggest DNA-binding capabilities,
      ubiquitin-like folds, and motifs for interacting with PCNA.
