  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes transport proteins that are predominantly
      found in the bloodstream. They are characterized by their ability to bind various
      hydrophobic ligands within a beta-barrel domain. These proteins play a significant
      role in modulating the immune system's activity during the acute-phase reaction.
      Additionally, some members of this family have been shown to bind and may be
      involved in the accumulation and/or excretion of specific toxins, such as saxitoxin
      and tetrodotoxin. The binding of synthetic drugs by these proteins can influence
      the drugs' distribution and availability in the body, highlighting their importance
      in pharmacokinetics and the immune response.
