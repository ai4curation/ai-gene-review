    short: NCS2
  description:
  - text: The Nucleobase:Cation Symporter-2 (NCS2) family includes transporters that
      facilitate the uptake of nucleobases and ascorbate across cellular membranes.
      Members of this family are predominantly involved in the electrogenic transport
      of vitamin C, often coupled with sodium ions, with a common stoichiometry of
      2 Na+ for each ascorbate molecule. Some members have retained ancestral functions,
      such as the transport of nucleobases like urate, and may participate in the
      regulation of serum urate levels. The transport activity of these proteins can
      be inhibited by an excess of their substrates or by specific chemical inhibitors.
      The family plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis of essential
      nutrients and metabolites, including vitamin C and purine derivatives, across
      a range of organisms.
