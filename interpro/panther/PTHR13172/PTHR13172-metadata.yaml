  description:
  - text: The small Tim family comprises mitochondrial intermembrane chaperones involved
      in the import and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial
      inner membrane. They facilitate the transfer of beta-barrel precursors from
      the TOM complex to the SAM complex of the outer membrane. Acting as chaperone-like
      proteins, they prevent the aggregation of hydrophobic precursors and guide them
      through the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The family members contain a
      twin CX3C motif with conserved Cys residues that likely coordinate zinc during
      transit from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrion, preventing premature folding.
