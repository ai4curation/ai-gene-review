  description:
  - text: This family of proteins functions as O-mannosyl-transferases, enzymes that
      catalyze the transfer of mannosyl residues to the hydroxyl groups of serine
      or threonine residues within target proteins. They are known to specifically
      modify the IPT/TIG domain of certain proteins, such as MET and MST1R/RON. The
      mannosylation process carried out by these enzymes results in the addition of
      single mannose glycans, which are not further elongated or modified. This post-translational
      modification plays a crucial role in the function and regulation of the modified
      proteins.
