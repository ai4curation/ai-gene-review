  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)
      that are independent of RAS and are involved in transducing signals from tyrosine
      kinase receptors to RAC GTPases. They play a crucial role in the regulation
      of the actin cytoskeleton, mediating signaling for membrane ruffling and cell
      protrusion. These proteins contain a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain essential
      for binding phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which is a key component
      in their function. Additionally, they are involved in immune homeostasis by
      regulating the trafficking and surface expression of CTLA-4, a T-cell regulator.
      They also contribute to T-cell effector function, lymphocyte homeostasis, and
      the prevention of autoimmunity. Some members are implicated in the development
      and/or activation of T helper cells, potentially by interacting with ZAP70 signaling.
