  description:
  - text: The ATOS family comprises transcription regulators that synchronize transcriptional
      and translational programs to promote macrophage invasion of tissues. Members
      of the family contain transactivation domains (TADs), which are essential for
      the transcriptional activation of a subset of target genes. The family plays
      a crucial role in adjusting transcription and translation of genes involved
      in metabolic processes and mitochondrial bioenergetics, facilitating macrophage
      tissue invasion. Some members are implicated in inducing the transcriptional
      expression of metabolic enzymes and translational regulators, thereby modulating
      mitochondrial function and energy production to support macrophage function.
