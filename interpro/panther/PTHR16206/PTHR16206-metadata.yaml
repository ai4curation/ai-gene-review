  description:
  - text: The DEPDC7 family is characterized by the presence of the DEP domain, which
      suggests a role in cellular processes such as spindle orientation, transcriptional
      regulation, and possibly apoptosis. Members of the family are implicated in
      various functions, including transcriptional corepression and the regulation
      of cell division asymmetry. Specifically, DEPDC1A, within this family, is involved
      in bladder carcinogenesis by repressing A20 gene transcription, leading to NF-KB
      nuclear transport and suppression of apoptosis in bladder cancer cells. Another
      member, let-99, is essential for spindle orientation and asymmetric cell division,
      acting downstream of PAR signaling and antagonistically to the gpr-1/2 pathway.
      The family also includes a target of ERK kinase mpk-1, which is involved in
      regulating asymmetric cell division and apoptosis, with the DEP domain being
      crucial for its function.
