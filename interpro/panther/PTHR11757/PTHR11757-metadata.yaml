  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes serine peptidases that exhibit a range
      of substrate specificities and biological functions. Some members are known
      to cleave peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of lysyl and argininyl residues,
      while others do not cleave after arginine or lysine residues. Functions of these
      proteins include the sequential removal of dipeptide units from the amino termini
      of peptides and proteins, regulation of trans-Golgi network morphology and sorting,
      and potentially playing a role in the regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis.
      Activity regulation varies among family members, with some being inhibited by
      metal ions, serine protease inhibitors, and other specific compounds.
