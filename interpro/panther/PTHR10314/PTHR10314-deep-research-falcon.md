Executive Summary
PTHR10314 (InterPro IPR050214) encompasses pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes in sulfur amino-acid metabolism, including O-acetylserine sulfhydrylases (OASS; CysK/CysM), O‑phosphoserine sulfhydrylase-like variants, and cystathionine β‑synthase (CBS); some fungal/bacterial O‑acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylases (Met15p) are also functionally adjacent. Core chemistry is PLP-mediated β‑elimination/β‑replacement via an aminoacrylate intermediate using a conserved active‑site lysine. Subfamilies show clear specialization: CysK prefers sulfide; CysM accepts thiosulfate or alternative sulfur donors; mycobacterial CysM can use O‑phosphoserine (OPS) and a thiocarboxylated donor (CysO); CBS catalyzes condensation of serine and homocysteine and in mammals is heme/S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) regulated and filament-forming. These divergences imply that GO annotations propagated from the root must be constrained by subfamily membership, especially for sulfur donor specificity, protein–protein regulation (cysteine synthase complex), and heme/SAM binding in CBS (restricted to certain taxa). (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 42-46, oldham202455chapter pages 41-44, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 39-42, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46, pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 97-100, pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 100-102)

Ancestral Function
- Structural fold: Members fall in the tryptophan synthase β‑superfamily (PLP fold type II/β family), forming homodimers with one PLP per subunit in an active-site cleft between N- and C‑terminal domains. A conserved lysine (e.g., Lys41 in OASS numbering) forms the internal aldimine with PLP. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 39-42, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)
- Core chemistry: A bi‑bi ping‑pong mechanism proceeds via an external aldimine and an α‑aminoacrylate intermediate after β‑elimination of acetate (from O‑acetylserine) before nucleophilic attack by the sulfur donor, producing cysteine or related products. This PLP‑mediated aminoacrylate mechanism is a hallmark across subfamilies. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46, pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 100-102)
- Typical cofactors/partners: PLP is universal. Many OASS enzymes participate in a regulatory cysteine synthase complex (CSC) with serine acetyltransferase (CysE) via binding of the CysE C‑terminal tail in the OASS active site; this strongly inhibits CysK. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)

Subfamily Analysis
- O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A (CysK; EC 2.5.1.47)
  • Function: Condenses O‑acetylserine with sulfide to form L‑cysteine; forms the CSC with CysE and carries an allosteric anion-binding site at the dimer interface. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)
  • Substrates: O‑acetylserine (OAS) + bisulfide (HS−). (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)
  • Organisms: Broadly in bacteria; CysK essentiality varies by species. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42)
  • Evidence: Structural/mechanistic descriptions with conserved Lys41, aminoacrylate intermediate, and CysE-tail inhibition of CysK activity. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)

- O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase B (CysM; EC 2.5.1.47)
  • Function: Catalyzes cysteine formation; distinct active-site features allow larger sulfur donors. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)
  • Substrates: OAS + HS−, and in many species OAS + thiosulfate; in mycobacteria, notable variations (see below). (oldham202455chapter pages 41-44, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)
  • Organisms: Widely distributed; essentiality varies; upregulated in stress in some pathogens. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42)
  • Evidence: Structural basis of specificity—CysM possesses Arg210/Arg211/Trp212 and a three‑residue insertion enlarging the active site for thiosulfate; contrasts with small residues in CysK. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)

- Non-canonical/OPS-utilizing L-cysteine synthases (OPSS-like; often annotated as CysM variants)
  • Function: Use O‑phosphoserine (OPS) as amino-acid acceptor and thiocarboxylated sulfur donor proteins (e.g., CysO) rather than free sulfide/thiosulfate. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 39-42)
  • Organisms: Mycobacterium tuberculosis; implicated in redox stress responses and infection fitness; not fully redundant with canonical CysK isoforms. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42)
  • Evidence: Genetic and physiological studies show cysO/cysM roles in dormancy and in vivo attenuation when disrupted. (oldham202455chapter pages 41-44, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42)

- Cystathionine β‑synthase (CBS; EC 4.2.1.22)
  • Function: PLP-dependent condensation of serine and homocysteine to cystathionine in transsulfuration; also contributes to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production in some contexts. (pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 97-100, pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 100-102)
  • Regulation/cofactors: In mammals, N‑terminal heme-binding domain and a C‑terminal regulatory (Bateman) domain confer allosteric activation by SAM and capacity for filament assembly; heme-less forms occur in microbes. (pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 100-102)
  • Recent developments: Cryo‑EM/biochemical work reveal filamentous human CBS assemblies modulated by SAM; disease mutations can impair allostery and oligomerization. 2023–2024 reports emphasize allosteric regulation and morpheein behavior. URL examples: 2024 Nature Communications report on filamentous CBS (published 2024; see preprint DOI history) and 2023 JBC on disease-causing linker mutations. (pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 100-102)

- O-acetyl-L-homoserine sulfhydrylase (Met15p/OAH‑sulfhydrylase; EC 2.5.1.49)
  • Function: Direct sulfhydrylation of O‑acetyl‑L‑homoserine with sulfide to form homocysteine (fungal methionine biosynthesis). (zmich2023multiplexedassessmentof pages 14-16)
  • Organisms: Fungi and some bacteria; targeted in antifungal discovery. (zmich2023multiplexedassessmentof pages 14-16)
  • Evidence: Contemporary PLP enzyme surveys and multiplexed screens place OAH‑sulfhydrylases among PLP family members with β‑replacement chemistry akin to OASS. (zmich2023multiplexedassessmentof pages 14-16)

Functional Divergence and Neo-functionalization
- Divergent sulfur donors and acceptors
  • Within OASS, the presence of Arg210/Arg211/Trp212 plus an insertion in CysM correlates with thiosulfate acceptance, whereas CysK with smaller residues (Gly230/Ala231/Gly232) is restricted to sulfide—subfunctionalization by substrate scope. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)
  • Mycobacterial CysM evolved to use OPS and thiocarboxylated donors (CysO), diverging from canonical OAS + free sulfur donors—clear neo-functionalization relative to the ancestral OASS. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 39-42)

- Regulatory repurposing and assemblies
  • CysK acquired regulation via the cysteine synthase complex (CSC) with CysE, with the CysE tail binding into and inhibiting the CysK active site; CysM generally lacks CSC formation—regulatory subfunctionalization. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)
  • Mammalian CBS appended a heme-binding N‑terminal domain and a SAM‑responsive Bateman regulatory domain; recent work details SAM‑dependent filament formation, a non-canonical regulatory strategy (morpheein model), indicating regulatory neo-functionalization. (pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 100-102)

- Expansion to non-canonical amino acid biocatalysis
  • Members of related PLP-dependent subfamilies that share the aminoacrylate chemistry have diversified to synthesize γ‑substituted non‑canonical amino acids; high-throughput substrate-multiplexed screening across 40 homologs highlights pervasive mis-annotation and identifies specialized γ‑synthases suitable for biocatalysis. These trends underscore latent promiscuity and evolvability within the broader family scaffold. (Aug 2023; https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c02498) (zmich2023multiplexedassessmentof pages 14-16)

Branch Length and Evolutionary Considerations
- Although a full phylogeny was not reconstructed here, functional outliers (e.g., OPS‑utilizing, CysO‑dependent CysM; mammalian CBS with heme/SAM regulatory appendages) plausibly correspond to longer branch lengths from the ancestral OASS-like root, consistent with domain acquisition/loss and altered substrate scopes. Conversely, closely related CysK/CysM paralogs within the same genome (differing mainly in the 210–216 segment) likely represent shorter branch separations. These hypotheses should be verified with explicit phylogenetic branch-length analyses on the PTHR10314 tree. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42)

Key Catalytic/Functional Residues
- Conserved catalytic lysine (e.g., Lys41) for PLP internal aldimine and general base catalysis; essential for aminoacrylate formation. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)
- Substrate-specificity determinants in OASS: CysM’s Arg210/Arg211/Trp212 and nearby insertion enlarge the pocket for thiosulfate; CysK’s Gly230/Ala231/Gly232 restrict the pocket to sulfide. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)
- Allosteric/anion site at CysK dimer interface binds chloride/sulfide, modulating activity; absent in many CysM enzymes. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)
- CBS regulatory sites: mammalian CBS contains heme and SAM binding in regulatory domains; disease-linked mutations can disrupt allosteric communication between catalytic and regulatory domains. (pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 100-102)

Current Applications and Implementations (2023–2024)
- Antibacterial target discovery: OASS enzymes (CysK/CysM) are attractive antibacterial targets; essentiality and stress-response phenotypes (e.g., H2S accumulation, biofilm/colonization defects) support druggability in multiple pathogens. Structural insights into active-site differences inform isoform-selective inhibitor design. (oldham202455chapter pages 41-44, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42)
- Host–pathogen biology: Non-canonical CysM pathways (OPS/CysO) in M. tuberculosis are implicated in redox stress adaptation and infection fitness, suggesting therapeutic opportunities that exploit non-redundancy with canonical enzymes. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42)
- Human disease mechanisms: In CBS deficiency (homocystinuria), altered allostery/oligomerization and proteostasis have been linked to pathogenic variants; emerging structural studies of human CBS filaments and allosteric regulation are reshaping therapeutic hypotheses (e.g., pharmacological chaperones/allosteric modulators). (pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 100-102)
- Biocatalysis: Systematic mining and screening of PLP-dependent aminoacrylate enzymes reveal robust catalysts for γ‑substituted non‑canonical amino acids, with structural bases for open–close transitions that can be engineered, expanding synthetic utility. (zmich2023multiplexedassessmentof pages 14-16)

GO Annotation Assessment and Recommendations
- Catalytic activity terms
  • Retain “O‑acetylserine sulfhydrylase activity” (GO:0003949) for CysK/CysM broadly, but refine by subfamily: add “thiosulfate binding/transfer” or “S‑sulfocysteine biosynthetic process” annotations for CysM clades with Arg210/Arg211/Trp212 and the insertion; avoid assigning thiosulfate-related terms to CysK paralogs with Gly/Ala/Gly at the corresponding positions. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)
  • Annotate OPS-utilizing CysM variants with “O‑phosphoserine sulfhydrylase activity” and “protein thiocarboxylate as sulfur donor” process terms; exclude OAS utilization if biochemically unsupported for that clade. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 39-42)
  • For CBS clades, use “cystathionine beta‑synthase activity” (GO:0004122) and transsulfuration process terms; do not propagate OASS activity. (pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 97-100)

- Cofactor binding and regulation
  • Restrict “heme binding” and “S‑adenosylmethionine binding” GO terms to the mammalian (and specific eukaryotic) CBS regulatory-domain lineages; avoid heme/SAM binding annotations for bacterial or fungal OASS/CBS homologs lacking these domains. (pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 100-102)
  • Add “protein complex assembly”/“protein–protein interaction” annotation (CSC formation) to CysK clades that bind the CysE C‑terminus; explicitly exclude for CysM clades lacking CSC formation. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)

- Biological process/localization
  • Assign “cysteine biosynthetic process via O‑acetylserine” to canonical OASS; “via O‑phosphoserine” to OPS/CysO-dependent enzymes; and “homocysteine biosynthetic process via O‑acetylhomoserine” to Met15-like enzymes. (oldham202455chapter pages 41-44, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42, zmich2023multiplexedassessmentof pages 14-16)

Key Literature (recent, authoritative; URLs and dates)
- OASS/CysK/CysM structure–function and druggability: Investigation and reviews summarizing OASS isoforms, essentiality, sulfur-donor specificity, CSC regulation, and pathogen phenotypes; emphasizes tryptophan synthase β‑superfamily membership and PLP mechanism. 2024–2025 review material, with structural residue mapping (active-site Lys41; CysM Arg210/Arg211/Trp212 vs CysK Gly/Ala/Gly) and CSC formation details. (Examples consolidate to: 2024–2025 analyses) (oldham202455chapter pages 41-44, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 39-42, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46)
- CBS structure and regulation: 2023–2024 studies on mammalian CBS allostery and filament assembly; disease-causing mutations that impair SAM-mediated regulation; cross-taxa comparisons (heme-containing vs heme-less). See 2024 reports (e.g., Nature Communications; preprint DOI 2023; journal 2024) and 2023 Journal of Biological Chemistry on linker mutations; URLs available via journal sites. (pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 100-102)
- PLP aminoacrylate enzyme diversification for biocatalysis: High-throughput substrate-multiplexed screening across 40 homologs reveals mis-annotation and identifies robust γ‑synthases for non-canonical amino acids; ACS Catalysis, Aug 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c02498. (zmich2023multiplexedassessmentof pages 14-16)

Notes on Evidence Gaps for Branch-Length Quantitation
- The present synthesis did not compute branch lengths on the PTHR10314 tree. We infer likely long-branch clades from functional/domain innovations (OPS/CysO-dependent CysM; mammalian CBS regulatory expansions). A targeted phylogeny with constrained models on PANTHER alignments would allow systematic mapping of functional shifts to branch lengths, which we recommend for future curation. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42, pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 100-102)

Overall, PTHR10314/IPR050214 contains multiple PLP-dependent subfamilies unified by fold and aminoacrylate chemistry but diversified in substrate donors/acceptors and regulation. These differences are large enough to warrant subfamily-specific GO annotations and to avoid overgeneralizing ancestral functions (e.g., thiosulfate use, CSC formation, heme/SAM binding) across all descendants. (mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserine pages 42-46, mcgarvie2025investigationofoacetylserinea pages 39-42, pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 97-100, pedretti2024explorationofh2sproducing pages 100-102)
