  description:
  - text: The cysteine synthase/cystathionine beta-synthase family is involved in
      the biosynthesis of cysteine, an essential amino acid. Members of this family
      catalyze the conversion of O-acetylserine (OAS) to cysteine through the elimination
      of acetate and addition of hydrogen sulfide. Some proteins within this family
      also have bifunctional activity, being able to catalyze the synthesis of L-3-cyanoalanine,
      which is involved in cyanide detoxification in plants. Additionally, certain
      members are implicated in the transsulfuration pathway, converting L-serine
      and L-homocysteine into L-cystathionine, a precursor to L-cysteine. This family
      also includes proteins that synthesize N-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)-L-glutamate,
      a precursor for antibiotics and siderophores like staphyloferrin B. Some proteins
      are regulated allosterically by S-adenosyl-methionine and may bind heme groups,
      affecting their redox sensitivity. The family plays a crucial role in maintaining
      sulfur amino acid levels, participating in redox regulation, and contributing
      to the synthesis of important biomolecules.
