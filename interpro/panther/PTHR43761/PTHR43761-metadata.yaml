  description:
  - text: 'The D-isomer specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family, PdxB subfamily,
      consists of enzymes that primarily catalyze the oxidation of erythronate-4-phosphate
      to 3-hydroxy-2-oxo-4-phosphonooxybutanoate. This reaction is part of the vitamin
      B6 biosynthesis pathway. Members of this subfamily share a common structure
      with three discernible domains: the lid domain, the nucleotide-binding domain,
      and the C-terminal dimerization domain. The unique dimeric structure of these
      enzymes is attributed to the presence of the dimerization domain at the C-terminus.
      Some proteins within the broader D-isomer specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase
      family are involved in other metabolic processes, such as the reversible oxidation
      of 3-phospho-D-glycerate to 3-phosphonooxypyruvate in L-serine biosynthesis
      or the interconversion of hydroxypyruvate and glycerate in carbon assimilation.'
