  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the transcription and 3'-box-dependent
      processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), including U1 and U2, which are essential
      for pre-mRNA splicing. Members of this family are components of the Integrator
      complex, which associates with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase
      II's largest subunit (POLR2A) and is recruited to snRNA genes. Additionally,
      these proteins are implicated in the recruitment of cytoplasmic dynein to the
      nuclear envelope, suggesting a role in intracellular transport processes.
