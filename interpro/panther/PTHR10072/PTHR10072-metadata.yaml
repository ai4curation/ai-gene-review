    name: Iron-sulfur cluster assembly and transfer HesB/IscA
    short: Fe-S_cluster_asmbl/transfer
  description:
  - text: The HesB/IscA family is involved in the assembly and transfer of iron-sulfur
      (Fe-S) clusters, which are critical for various cellular processes. Members
      of this family can transfer Fe-S clusters to apo-ferredoxin and other recipient
      proteins, acting catalytically through multiple cycles of cluster formation
      and transfer. They play a role in recruiting intracellular free iron, facilitating
      the assembly of transient Fe-S clusters in IscU, a scaffold protein for cluster
      formation. This process occurs in the presence of IscS, L-cysteine, and the
      thioredoxin reductase system TrxA/TrxB. Some members are also implicated in
      the maturation of mitochondrial 4Fe-4S proteins and may bind intermediates of
      Fe/S cluster assembly. The family includes proteins that function under oxidative
      stress and iron limitation, such as SufA, which is part of the sufABCDSE gene
      cluster.
