  description:
  - text: The protein family is involved in calcium-mediated regulation of muscle
      contraction and cellular processes. Members of the family serve as regulatory
      proteins in striated muscle contraction, with troponin components (Tn-I, Tn-T,
      Tn-C) that respond to calcium binding by modulating actomyosin ATPase activity.
      Other members, such as calmodulins and calglandulins, mediate the control of
      various enzymes, ion channels, and proteins through calcium signaling. Some
      light chains of myosin are essential for ATPase activity, while others are regulatory,
      influencing myosin's interaction with actin. Additionally, the family includes
      proteins potentially involved in secretion of toxins from venom glands and in
      cellular control mechanisms. The family showcases a diversity of calcium-binding
      proteins with roles in muscle function, enzyme regulation, and cellular responses
      to calcium.
