  description:
  - text: The SEZ6/CSMD protein family includes members that are involved in various
      neuronal functions. SEZ6 family proteins are implicated in cell-cell recognition,
      neuronal membrane signaling, and the development of dendritic arbors, contributing
      to the establishment of excitatory synaptic connectivity. They may also play
      a role in specialized endoplasmic reticulum functions within neurons. The CSMD
      family members are associated with dendrite development and may act as suppressors
      in certain types of cancer. The C4BPB proteins within this family regulate the
      classical pathway of complement activation, interact with anticoagulant protein
      S, and are involved in immune response regulation.
