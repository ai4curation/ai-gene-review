  description:
  - text: The ITPRIP and mab-21 families include proteins with nucleotidyltransferase
      activity, playing key roles in innate immunity and embryonic development. Members
      of the ITPRIP family enhance Ca(2+)-mediated inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate
      receptor Ca(2+) release. The mab-21 family proteins are involved in the formation
      of cyclic dinucleotides, acting as sensors of cytosolic DNA and RNA, triggering
      immune responses. They also contribute to embryonic development, including eye
      morphogenesis. Some family members are putative nucleotidyltransferases with
      unclear in vivo activity, while others like CGAS catalyze the formation of cyclic
      GMP-AMP, a second messenger activating STING1 and promoting type-I interferon
      production in response to foreign or self-DNA. The activity of these proteins
      is regulated by various post-translational modifications and interactions with
      nucleic acids or other cellular components.
