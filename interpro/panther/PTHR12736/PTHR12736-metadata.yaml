  description:
  - text: The LanC-like protein family encompasses a group of proteins that exhibit
      diverse functions, primarily associated with cellular signaling and stress response
      mechanisms. Members of this family are implicated in the binding and signaling
      of abscisic acid (ABA), a plant hormone involved in various physiological processes,
      particularly in granulocytes. Additionally, certain LanC-like proteins function
      as glutathione transferases, catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to various
      substrates, which plays a crucial role in mitigating oxidative stress in neurons.
      This antioxidant defense mechanism is essential for normal postnatal development
      and in response to oxidative challenges. Some family members are suggested to
      participate in EPS8 signaling pathways, although their exact role in this context
      is not fully elucidated. The LanC-like protein family is characterized by its
      ability to bind glutathione, which is central to their function in cellular
      detoxification and defense against oxidative damage.
