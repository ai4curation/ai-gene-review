  description:
  - text: The distal-less homeobox family is a group of transcription factors characterized
      by a conserved homeobox DNA-binding domain. Members of this family are involved
      in a variety of developmental processes across different species. They play
      key roles in the differentiation of interneurons, such as amacrine and bipolar
      cells in the retina, and contribute to craniofacial patterning and morphogenesis.
      Some family members act as transcriptional activators or repressors, influencing
      hematopoietic cell differentiation by modulating cytokine signaling pathways.
      They are also implicated in bone development, osteoblast differentiation, and
      chondrogenesis. In addition, certain proteins within this family are essential
      for zygotic genome activation during early embryonic development, and others,
      like the Nanog homeobox proteins, are crucial for maintaining pluripotency and
      self-renewal in embryonic stem cells.
