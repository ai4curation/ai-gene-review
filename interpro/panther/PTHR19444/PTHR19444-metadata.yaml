  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in the regulation of potassium channel
      complexes, which may affect muscle contraction coordination. Members of this
      family play a role in the formation of muscle connections, specifically in the
      development of muscle arm extensions that link the body wall to motor axons
      in the nervous system. The function suggests a regulatory role in neuromuscular
      systems, potentially influencing muscle function and coordination.
