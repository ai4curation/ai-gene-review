  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes members that play roles in the regulation
      of synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neuronal development. Some members inhibit
      the formation of SNARE complexes, which are critical for the fusion of synaptic
      vesicles with the plasma membrane, thereby regulating neurotransmitter release.
      They achieve this by binding to and sequestering STX1A, a component of the SNARE
      complex. Other members of the family are involved in the anterograde axonal
      transport of presynaptic components, which is essential for the maintenance
      and modulation of synapses. They function as part of a motor-adapter complex
      that interacts with kinesin motors, facilitating the delivery of cargo along
      axons and contributing to the assembly of presynaptic machinery in an activity-dependent
      manner.
