  description:
  - text: The ABC transporter C family is involved in various transport activities
      across cell membranes. Members of this family actively extrude physiological
      compounds and xenobiotics, contributing to cellular detoxification and multidrug
      resistance. They transport a wide range of substrates, including glutathione
      conjugates, cyclic nucleotides, bile acids, steroid conjugates, and drugs. Some
      members mediate the release of nucleoside triphosphates, playing a role in homeostasis.
      Others are involved in the regulation of epithelial ion and water transport,
      fluid homeostasis, and the regulation of pH and ion content in epithelial fluid
      layers. The family also includes proteins that may function in the secretion
      of metabolites and in the protection of the producing organism from self-toxicity.
