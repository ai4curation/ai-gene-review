  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes components involved in the regulation of
      gene expression through the modification of chromatin structure. Specifically,
      one member is known to function as a catalytic component of a histone deacetylase
      complex, which is responsible for the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues
      on the N-terminal part of core histones. This deacetylation process is crucial
      for epigenetic repression and has significant roles in various cellular processes
      including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression, response to DNA
      damage, adaptation to osmotic stress, and developmental events. While some members
      of this family are uncharacterized, the characterized components suggest a broader
      involvement in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene expression.
