  description:
  - text: The DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 4 family is implicated in cellular processes
      that may be crucial during spermatogenesis and/or within the male genital tract.
      Members of this family are likely to assist in the folding of nascent polypeptide
      chains and the refolding of denatured proteins, acting as molecular chaperones.
      They may also play a role in the assembly of multiprotein complexes.
