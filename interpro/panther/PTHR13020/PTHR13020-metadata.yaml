  description:
  - text: This family of proteins is involved in RNA-mediated gene silencing mechanisms,
      including those mediated by micro-RNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs).
      Members of this family are essential for the miRNA-dependent translational repression
      and siRNA-dependent cleavage of target mRNAs. They function as scaffolding proteins,
      associating with argonaute proteins that are bound to mRNAs with partial complementarity.
      These proteins are capable of recruiting various complexes such as CCR4-NOT
      and PAN deadenylase, which are involved in mRNA degradation processes. Some
      members contain a silencing domain known as the C-terminal effector domain (CED),
      which is implicated in the repression of translation and mRNA decay.
