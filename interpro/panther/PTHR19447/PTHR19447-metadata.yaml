  description:
  - text: The KHDC1 family proteins play a crucial role in DNA replication and repair,
      particularly in oocytes and early embryonic development. They form the OOEP-KHDC3
      scaffold, which is essential for recruiting BLM and TRIM25 to DNA replication
      forks, promoting BLM ubiquitination and retention, thus aiding in the restart
      of stalled replication forks. They also regulate the homologous recombination-mediated
      DNA double-strand break repair pathway by controlling ATM activation and RAD51
      recruitment to breaks, contributing to oocyte survival and meiotic progression.
      As part of the subcortical maternal complex, they are vital for zygotic cell
      division regulation, actin dynamics, and mitotic spindle formation and positioning.
      This ensures symmetric division and euploidy during early embryogenesis. Additionally,
      they influence neural stem cell neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and
      may affect learning, memory, and anxiety development.
