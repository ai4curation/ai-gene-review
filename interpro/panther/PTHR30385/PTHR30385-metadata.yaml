  description:
  - text: The Sigma-70 factor family is a group of bacterial sigma factors that are
      essential initiation factors for transcription. They promote the attachment
      of RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites on DNA and are subsequently released.
      Members of this family are involved in various cellular processes, including
      the expression of flagella-related genes, stress response, virulence gene expression,
      cell wall metabolism in response to heat stress, transition to post-exponential
      phase and sporulation, and adaptation to environmental stresses. Some are regulated
      by anti-sigma factors that sequester them in an inactive state until specific
      signals trigger their release. The family includes subfamilies such as FliA,
      SigI, SigB, and others, each with distinct regulatory roles in bacterial gene
      expression.
