  description:
  - text: The protein family functions as an autophagy receptor, playing a crucial
      role in selective macroautophagy, also known as aggrephagy. Members of the family
      serve as a bridge between polyubiquitinated cargo and autophagosomes, interacting
      with both the cargo destined for degradation and autophagy modifiers from the
      MAP1 LC3 family. They are involved in the formation and degradation of cytoplasmic
      ubiquitin-containing inclusions and the recruitment of ubiquitinated proteins
      to PML bodies in the nucleus. Additionally, they participate in the autophagy
      of peroxisomes in response to ROS. The family members may influence various
      cellular processes, including the activation of NFKB1, muscle cell signaling,
      cell differentiation, apoptosis, immune response, and K(+) channel regulation.
      They are implicated in endosome organization, vesicle transport, and activation
      of the NFE2L2/NRF2 pathway through interaction with KEAP1, promoting the expression
      of cytoprotective genes.
