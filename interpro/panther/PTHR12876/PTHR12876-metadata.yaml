  description:
  - text: The ZC3H12/N4BP1 protein family includes endoribonucleases and regulatory
      proteins involved in various biological processes such as immune homeostasis,
      inflammation, glial differentiation, apoptosis, adipogenesis, and angiogenesis.
      Members of the family function as RNases, regulating mRNA and pre-miRNA levels,
      thereby influencing cytokine production, T-cell activation, and stress response.
      They also modulate ubiquitination processes, affecting signaling pathways like
      NF-kappa-B and JNK. Some members serve as tumor suppressors or restrict viral
      replication. The family is characterized by a C3H1-type zinc finger domain essential
      for RNA binding and a proline-rich domain necessary for oligomerization.
