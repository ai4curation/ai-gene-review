  description:
  - text: The bZIP family of transcription factors is characterized by their ability
      to bind DNA and regulate gene expression in response to a variety of cellular
      and environmental cues. Members of this family are involved in diverse biological
      processes such as cell growth arrest, stress responses, cell survival, proliferation,
      differentiation, metabolic and redox regulation, and circadian rhythm. They
      can function as activators or repressors and often form homo- or heterodimers
      to bind to specific DNA elements like the cAMP response element (CRE). The family
      plays a critical role in the integrated stress response (ISR), unfolded protein
      response (UPR), and mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR), adapting
      to conditions like endoplasmic reticulum stress, amino acid starvation, and
      oxidative stress. They are also implicated in developmental processes, including
      cerebral cortex formation and osteoblast differentiation, and can regulate apoptosis
      and cell cycle dynamics.
