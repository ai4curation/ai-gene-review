  description:
  - text: The Sel1/AlgK protein family is involved in various biological processes
      across different organisms. Members of the Sel1 subfamily, such as Protein sel-1
      homologs and ERAD-associated E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase component HRD3, play
      crucial roles in the endoplasmic reticulum quality control system, particularly
      in the ER-associated degradation pathway for misfolded proteins. They are implicated
      in maintaining cellular homeostasis by enhancing the stability of specific proteins
      and may also participate in Notch signaling and the differentiation of pancreatic
      epithelium. The AlgK subfamily members are associated with the biosynthesis
      of alginate, a biopolymer involved in the formation of biofilms, by potentially
      catalyzing the polymerization of mannuronate. Other family members, such as
      Exopolysaccharide production negative regulators, are involved in modulating
      the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides. The family also includes proteins like
      PodJL, which provides positional information for the localization of cell pole
      organelles, and secretory immunoglobulin A-binding proteins that interfere with
      host immune responses during infection.
