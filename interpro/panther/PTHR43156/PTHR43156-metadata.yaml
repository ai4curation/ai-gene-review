  description:
  - text: The protein family described is involved in regulatory processes related
      to stress response and sporulation in bacteria. Members of the family function
      as regulators of sigma factors, which are proteins that control the transcription
      of specific sets of genes. They exhibit phosphatase activity, often dephosphorylating
      specific proteins to activate sigma factors in response to environmental or
      energy stress. Some members also have kinase activity and can phosphorylate
      other proteins, playing a role in signal transduction pathways. The family includes
      proteins that participate in the cross-regulation of carbon and glucose metabolisms,
      as well as proteins that act as independent regulators sensitive to osmosensory
      signals. They are characterized by the presence of domains such as PAS, which
      may sense cellular energy levels, and anti-sigma factor domains, which are involved
      in the regulation of sigma factor activity.
