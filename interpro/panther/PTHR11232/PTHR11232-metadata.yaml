  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes various adapter proteins that play roles
      in cellular processes such as endocytosis, nitric oxide synthesis regulation,
      and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Members of this family are involved in
      the formation of protein complexes that are essential for specific functions
      at the cellular level, including synaptic functions and cellular transport.
      Some proteins in this family mediate interactions between enzymes and regulatory
      proteins, enhancing their activities. Others are involved in the internalization
      and trafficking of receptors and their ligands, contributing to cellular signaling
      and uptake of nutrients. The family also includes proteins that are necessary
      for the clearance of cellular debris and the restructuring of the cytoskeleton
      during developmental processes.
