  description:
  - text: The ADAMTS and ADAMTS-like protein family is involved in various biological
      processes, including the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) composition,
      cell migration, development, and apoptosis. Members of this family are metalloproteinases
      that cleave components such as aggrecan and versican, contributing to ECM remodeling.
      Some proteins within this family have a role in inhibiting angiogenesis, while
      others facilitate microfibril biogenesis and influence tissue organization.
      The family includes proteins with thrombospondin type-1 motifs, which are important
      for ECM interaction, and some members possess a cysteine-switch motif that regulates
      their enzymatic activity. Additionally, certain ADAMTS-like proteins may have
      protease-independent functions in cellular processes such as ER to Golgi transport.
