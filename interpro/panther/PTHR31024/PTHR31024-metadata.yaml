    short: C-type_lectin_domain
  description:
  - text: This family of proteins includes C-type lectin domain-containing proteins
      which are characterized by their carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs). These
      domains typically bind to sugar moieties on the surfaces of cells and pathogens,
      mediating a variety of cellular processes including cell-cell adhesion, immune
      response, and pathogen recognition. Members of this family are often involved
      in the innate immune system as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that can
      recognize and bind to specific carbohydrate patterns present on the surface
      of pathogens, leading to their neutralization or the initiation of a signaling
      cascade that results in an immune response. The C-type lectin domain is a conserved
      motif that can be involved in a range of biological functions, and proteins
      containing this domain can be found across a wide range of organisms.
