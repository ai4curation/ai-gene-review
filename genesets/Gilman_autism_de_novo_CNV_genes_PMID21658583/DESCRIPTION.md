# Gene Set Description
This gene set contains the 72 human genes listed in Supplementary Table S2 of Gilman et al. (Neuron, 2011; DOI:10.1016/j.neuron.2011.05.021). These genes were affected by rare de novo copy-number variants (CNVs) in autism cases and were used as the input for the NETBAG network-based functional analysis that defined a synapse-related functional cluster.

## Analysis role
The enrichment/network analysis is central to the paper’s hypothesis testing: it is the primary method used to argue that de novo CNVs in autism converge on a coherent, synapse-related functional network rather than representing unrelated events.

## Reported figures/tables
Key results are summarized in Figure 2 (functional network/cluster), Table 1 (top GO categories connected to the cluster), and Table S2 (the 72 CNV genes in this set).

## Expected vs. actual findings
The authors expected functional convergence on synaptic/neurodevelopmental biology. The analysis reported a significant network enriched for synapse development, axon targeting/axonogenesis, neuron motility, and actin cytoskeleton dynamics, matching the anticipated synaptic theme.

## Did the enrichment “work”? 
Yes. The reported NETBAG cluster and GO-category connections align with the hypothesized synaptic biology and are presented as statistically significant in the paper.
