AP-4 is a member of the heterotetrameric adaptor protein (AP) complex family 
involved in protein sorting in the endomembrane system of eukaryotic cells. 
Interest in AP-4 has recently risen with the discovery that mutations in any of 
its four subunits cause a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) with 
intellectual disability. The critical sorting events mediated by AP-4 and the 
pathogenesis of AP-4 deficiency, however, remain poorly understood. Here we 
report the identification of ATG9A, the only multispanning membrane component of 
the core autophagy machinery, as a specific AP-4 cargo. AP-4 promotes 
signal-mediated export of ATG9A from the trans-Golgi network to the peripheral 
cytoplasm, contributing to lipidation of the autophagy protein LC3B and 
maturation of preautophagosomal structures. These findings implicate AP-4 as a 
regulator of autophagy and altered autophagy as a possible defect in 
AP-4-deficient HSP.
