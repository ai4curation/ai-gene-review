During normal cellular homeostasis, unfolded and mislocalized proteins are 
recognized and removed, preventing the build-up of toxic byproducts1. When 
protein homeostasis is perturbed during ageing, neurodegeneration or cellular 
stress, proteins can accumulate several forms of chemical damage through 
reactive metabolites2,3. Such modifications have been proposed to trigger the 
selective removal of chemically marked proteins3-6; however, identifying 
modifications that are sufficient to induce protein degradation has remained 
challenging. Here, using a semi-synthetic chemical biology approach coupled to 
cellular assays, we found that C-terminal amide-bearing proteins (CTAPs) are 
rapidly cleared from human cells. A CRISPR screen identified FBXO31 as a reader 
of C-terminal amides. FBXO31 is a substrate receptor for the SKP1-CUL1-F-box 
protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase SCF-FBXO31, which ubiquitylates CTAPs for 
subsequent proteasomal degradation. A conserved binding pocket enables FBXO31 to 
bind to almost any C-terminal peptide bearing an amide while retaining exquisite 
selectivity over non-modified clients. This mechanism facilitates binding and 
turnover of endogenous CTAPs that are formed after oxidative stress. A dominant 
human mutation found in neurodevelopmental disorders reverses CTAP recognition, 
such that non-amidated neosubstrates are now degraded and FBXO31 becomes 
markedly toxic. We propose that CTAPs may represent the vanguard of a largely 
unexplored class of modified amino acid degrons that could provide a general 
strategy for selective yet broad surveillance of chemically damaged proteins.
