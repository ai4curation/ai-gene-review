Recent advances in genome-wide analysis of alternative splicing indicate that 
extensive alternative RNA processing is associated with many proteins that play 
important roles in the nervous system. Although differential splicing and 
polyadenylation make significant contributions to the complexity of the nervous 
system, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying the 
neuron-specific pathways is very limited. Mammalian neuron-specific embryonic 
lethal abnormal visual-like Hu proteins (HuB, HuC, and HuD) are a family of 
RNA-binding proteins implicated in neuronal differentiation and maintenance. It 
has been established that Hu proteins increase expression of proteins associated 
with neuronal function by up-regulating mRNA stability and/or translation in the 
cytoplasm. We report here a novel function of these proteins as RNA processing 
regulators in the nucleus. We further elucidate the underlying mechanism of this 
regulation. We show that in neuron-like cells, Hu proteins block the activity of 
TIA-1/TIAR, two previously identified, ubiquitously expressed proteins that 
promote the nonneuronal pathway of calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide 
(CGRP) pre-mRNA processing. These studies define not only the first 
neuron-specific regulator of the calcitonin/CGRP system but also the first 
nuclear function of Hu proteins.
