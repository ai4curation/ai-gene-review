Retromer is an evolutionarily conserved protein complex composed of the VPS26, 
VPS29, and VPS35 proteins that selects and packages cargo proteins into 
transport carriers that export cargo from the endosome. The mechanisms by which 
retromer is recruited to the endosome and captures cargo are unknown. We show 
that membrane recruitment of retromer is mediated by bivalent recognition of an 
effector of PI3K, SNX3, and the RAB7A GTPase, by the VPS35 retromer subunit. 
These bivalent interactions prime retromer to capture integral membrane cargo, 
which enhances membrane association of retromer and initiates cargo sorting. The 
role of RAB7A is severely impaired by a mutation, K157N, that causes 
Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy 2B. The results elucidate minimal requirements 
for retromer assembly on the endosome membrane and reveal how PI3K and RAB 
signaling are coupled to initiate retromer-mediated cargo export.
