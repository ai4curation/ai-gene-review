As a highly conserved nuclear protein, death domain-associated protein (Daxx) 
plays an important role in transcriptional control, carcinogenesis, and 
resistance to virus infection and so on. In order to further investigate the 
mechanism of Daxx, the yeast two-hybrid technique was used to screen the 
intra-cellular proteins interacting with Daxx. And 13 positive colonies and 
three proteins interacting with Daxx were obtained. One of the candidate 
proteins was identified as ferritin, heavy polypeptide 1(FTH1). The interaction 
between Daxx and FTH1 was further supported by GST pull-down and 
co-immunoprecipitation respectively. Then Daxx was determined to induce 
apoptosis and FTH1 can inhibit Daxx-mediated apoptosis. Besides, it is found 
that Daxx mediated apoptosis through the Fas-Daxx-ASK1-JNK1 signaling pathway, 
while FTH1 can inhibit the activation of JNK signaling pathway. We present 
evidence to demonstrate the FTH1 and Daxx are able to participate in apoptosis 
pathway through JNK signal molecule and FTH1 can inhibit this pathway.
