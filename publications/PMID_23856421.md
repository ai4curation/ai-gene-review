Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are rare genetic defects mainly in 
the post-translational modification of proteins via attachment of carbohydrate 
chains. We describe an infant with the phenotype of a congenital muscular 
dystrophy, with borderline microcephaly, hypotonia, camptodactyly, severe motor 
delay, and elevated creatine kinase. Muscle biopsy showed muscular dystrophy and 
reduced α-dystroglycan immunostaining with glycoepitope-specific antibodies in a 
pattern diagnostic of dystroglycanopathy. Carbohydrate deficient transferrin 
testing showed a pattern pointing to a CDG type I. Sanger sequencing of DPM1 
(dolichol-P-mannose synthase subunit 1) revealed a novel Gly > Val change c.455G 
> T missense mutation resulting in p.Gly152Val) of unknown pathogenicity and 
deletion/duplication analysis revealed an intragenic deletion from exons 3 to 7 
on the other allele. DPM1 activity in fibroblasts was reduced by 80%, while 
affinity for the substrate was not depressed, suggesting a decrease in the 
amount of active enzyme. Transfected cells expressing tagged versions of wild 
type and the p.Gly152Val mutant displayed reduced binding to DPM3, an essential, 
non-catalytic subunit of the DPM complex, suggesting a mechanism for 
pathogenicity. The present case is the first individual described with DPM1-CDG 
(CDG-Ie) to also have clinical and muscle biopsy findings consistent with 
dystroglycanopathy.
