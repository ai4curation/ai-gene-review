Our recent studies suggest a unique role of p53 during the early stage of cancer 
development. However, how p53 activation is regulated during TPA treatment 
remains elusive. We used murine skin epidermal JB6 promotion-sensitive (P+) and 
promotion resistant (P-) cells to observe differential expression of PTEN during 
TPA-induced p53 activation. Total PTEN expression was decreased in only P+ 
cells. Nuclear expression of PTEN increased and complex formation between PTEN 
and p53 occurred in P+ cells treated with TPA. Knocking down PTEN expression via 
siRNA inhibited TPA-induced Bax expression. Similar effects were seen with the 
p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-alpha. Cells that were transfected with siRNA to PTEN 
exhibited enhanced tumorigenicity. Our findings suggest PTEN mediates 
TPA-induced p53 activation.
