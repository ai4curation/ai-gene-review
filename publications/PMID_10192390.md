Plasma iron circulates bound to transferrin (Trf), which solubilizes the ferric 
ion and attenuates its reactivity. Diferric Trf interacts with cell-surface Trf 
receptor (Trfr) to undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis into specialized 
endosomes. Endosomal acidification leads to iron release, and iron is 
transported out of the endosome through the activity of divalent metal 
transporter 1 (DMT1, formerly Nramp2), a transmembrane iron transporter that 
functions only at low pH. Trf and Trfr then return to the cell surface for 
reuse, completing a highly efficient cycle. Although the Trf cycle is assumed to 
be the general mechanism for cellular iron uptake, this has not been validated 
experimentally. Mice with hypotransferrinaemia (hpx) have little or no plasma 
Trf. They have severe anaemia, indicating that the Trf cycle is essential for 
iron uptake by erythroid cells. Other hpx tissues, however, are generally 
normal, and there is a paradoxical increase in intestinal iron absorption and 
iron storage. To test the hypothesis that the Trf cycle has unique importance 
for erythropoiesis, we disrupted the Trfr gene in mice. This results in 
elimination of the Trf cycle, but leaves other Trf functions intact. Mice 
lacking Trfr have a more severe phenotype than hpx mice, affecting both 
erythropoiesis and neurologic development. Furthermore, haploinsufficiency for 
Trfr results in impaired erythroid development and abnormal iron homeostasis.
