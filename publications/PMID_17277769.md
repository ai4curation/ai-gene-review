Regulation of protein synthesis is critical for cell growth and maintenance. 
Ageing in many organisms, including humans, is accompanied by marked alterations 
in both general and specific protein synthesis. Whether these alterations are 
simply a corollary of the ageing process or have a causative role in senescent 
decline remains unclear. An array of protein factors facilitates the tight 
control of messenger RNA translation initiation. The eukaryotic initiation 
factor 4E (eIF4E), which binds the 7-monomethyl guanosine cap at the 5' end of 
all nuclear mRNAs, is a principal regulator of protein synthesis. Here we show 
that loss of a specific eIF4E isoform (IFE-2) that functions in somatic tissues 
reduces global protein synthesis, protects from oxidative stress and extends 
lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. Lifespan extension is independent of the 
forkhead transcription factor DAF-16, which mediates the effects of the 
insulin-like signalling pathway on ageing. Furthermore, IFE-2 deficiency further 
extends the lifespan of long-lived age and daf nematode mutants. Similarly, lack 
of IFE-2 enhances the long-lived phenotype of clk and dietary-restricted eat 
mutant animals. Knockdown of target of rapamycin (TOR), a phosphatidylinositol 
kinase-related kinase that controls protein synthesis in response to nutrient 
cues, further increases the longevity of ife-2 mutants. Thus, signalling via 
eIF4E in the soma is a newly discovered pathway influencing ageing in C. 
elegans.
