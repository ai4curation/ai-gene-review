A stochastic cell fate decision mediated by axon contact and calcium signaling 
causes one of the two bilaterally symmetric AWC neurons, either AWCL or AWCR, to 
express the candidate olfactory receptor str-2. nsy-1 mutants express str-2 in 
both neurons, disrupting AWC asymmetry. nsy-1 encodes a homolog of the human MAP 
kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) ASK1, an activator of JNK and p38 kinases. Based 
on genetic epistasis analysis, nsy-1 appears to act downstream of the CaMKII 
unc-43, and NSY-1 associates with UNC-43, suggesting that UNC-43/CaMKII 
activates the NSY-1 MAP kinase cassette. Mosaic analysis demonstrates that 
UNC-43 and NSY-1 act primarily in a cell-autonomous execution step that 
represses str-2 expression in one AWC cell, downstream of the initial lateral 
signaling pathway that coordinates the fates of the two cells.
