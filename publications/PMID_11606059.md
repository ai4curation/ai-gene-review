Apoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG-2) is a member of the family of Ca(2+)-binding 
proteins with penta-EF-hand and is essential for the execution of apoptosis by 
various signals including Fas activation. We studied the regulation of ALG-2 
during Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells. The 22-kDa ALG-2 protein is 
cleaved and becomes a 19-kDa protein after Fas activation. The appearance of 
19-kDa ALG-2 protein increases for 4 h after treatment with 200 ng/ml of 
anti-Fas Ab treatment and gradually degrades afterward. Confocal microscopic 
analysis showed that ALG-2 translocated from the plasma membrane to the cytosol 
during Fas-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, we examined if ALG-2 interacts with 
Fas. The protein-protein interaction of ALG-2 with Fas was demonstrated using 
yeast two-hybrid assays as well as in vitro GST pull-down assay. Endogenous 
ALG-2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Fas Ab in Jurkat cells without Fas 
activation. However, the endogenous ALG-2 was no longer immunoprecipitated with 
anti-Fas Ab 2 h after anti-Fas Ab treatment. This study, for the first time, 
presents a direct molecular connection of ALG-2 to apoptosis by its direct 
interaction with Fas, and enlists ALG-2 as a new member of posttranslationally 
modified proteins during Fas-mediated apoptotic process.
