The nonreceptor c-Abl tyrosine kinase binds to cytosolic 14-3-3 proteins and is 
targeted to the nucleus in the apoptotic response to DNA damage. The MUC1 
oncoprotein is overexpressed by most human carcinomas and blocks the induction 
of apoptosis by genotoxic agents. Using human carcinoma cells with gain and loss 
of MUC1 function, we show that nuclear targeting of c-Abl by DNA damage is 
abrogated by a MUC1-dependent mechanism. The results demonstrate that c-Abl 
phosphorylates MUC1 on Tyr-60 and forms a complex with MUC1 by binding of the 
c-Abl SH2 domain to the pTyr-60 site. Binding of MUC1 to c-Abl attenuates 
phosphorylation of c-Abl on Thr-735 and the interaction between c-Abl and 
cytosolic 14-3-3. We also show that expression of MUC1 with a mutation at Tyr-60 
(i) disrupts the interaction between MUC1 and c-Abl, (ii) relieves the 
MUC1-induced block of c-Abl phosphorylation on Thr-735 and binding to 14-3-3, 
and (iii) attenuates the MUC1 antiapoptotic function. These findings indicate 
that MUC1 sequesters c-Abl in the cytoplasm and thereby inhibits apoptosis in 
the response to genotoxic anticancer agents.

Abstract

The nonreceptor c-Abl tyrosine kinase binds to cytosolic 14-3-3 proteins and is targeted to the nucleus in the apoptotic response to DNA damage. The MUC1 oncoprotein is overexpressed by most human carcinomas and blocks the induction of apoptosis by genotoxic agents. Using human carcinoma cells with gain and loss of MUC1 function, we show that nuclear targeting of c-Abl by DNA damage is abrogated by a MUC1-dependent mechanism. The results demonstrate that c-Abl phosphorylates MUC1 on Tyr-60 and forms a complex with MUC1 by binding of the c-Abl SH2 domain to the pTyr-60 site. Binding of MUC1 to c-Abl attenuates phosphorylation of c-Abl on Thr-735 and the interaction between c-Abl and cytosolic 14-3-3. We also show that expression of MUC1 with a mutation at Tyr-60 (i) disrupts the interaction between MUC1 and c-Abl, (ii) relieves the MUC1-induced block of c-Abl phosphorylation on Thr-735 and binding to 14-3-3, and (iii) attenuates the MUC1 antiapoptotic function. These findings indicate that MUC1 sequesters c-Abl in the cytoplasm and thereby inhibits apoptosis in the response to genotoxic anticancer agents.

Introduction

DNA damage activates a nuclear complex that consists in part of the nonreceptor c-Abl tyrosine kinase ( Kharbanda et al , 1995b ; Yuan et al , 1997 ). c-Abl binds to the p53 tumor suppressor in the response to genotoxic stress ( Yuan et al , 1996a , 1996b ) and regulates p53 by preventing its nuclear export ( Sionov et al , 2001 ). Other studies have demonstrated that c-Abl interacts with the p73 homolog of p53 in the apoptotic response of cells to DNA damage ( Agami et al , 1999 ; Gong et al , 1999 ; Yuan et al , 1999 ). Nuclear c-Abl also activates MEK kinase-1 and thereby the proapoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway ( Kharbanda et al , 1995a , 1995b , 2000 ). c-Abl contains three nuclear localization signals and one nuclear export signal in the carboxy-terminal region that are responsible for shuttling of c-Abl between the cytoplasm and nucleus ( Wen et al , 1996 ; Taagepera et al , 1998 ). Recent work has shown that c-Abl is sequestered in the cytoplasm through binding to 14-3-3 proteins ( Yoshida et al , 2005 ). Phosphorylation of c-Abl on Thr-735 by an as yet unidentified kinase serves as a site for direct binding to 14-3-3. In the response to DNA damage, activation of JNK induces phosphorylation of 14-3-3 and the release of c-Abl for targeting to the nucleus ( Yoshida et al , 2005 ). In this regard, expression of a 14-3-3 mutant at the JNK phosphorylation site attenuates DNA damage-induced nuclear import of c-Abl and apoptosis. These findings have provided support for a model in which 14-3-3 is an important regulator of intracellular c-Abl localization and the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress.

The MUC1 transmembrane glycoprotein is expressed as a stable heterodimer following synthesis as a single polypeptide and cleavage into two subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum ( Ligtenberg et al , 1992 ). MUC1 is normally localized to the apical borders of secretory epithelial cells ( Kufe et al , 1984 ). With transformation and loss of polarity, the MUC1 heterodimer is aberrantly overexpressed on the entire cell membrane ( Kufe et al , 1984 ). The MUC1 N-terminal subunit (MUC1-N) contains variable numbers of 20 amino-acid tandem repeats that are modified by O -linked glycans ( Gendler et al , 1988 ; Siddiqui et al , 1988 ). MUC1-N is tethered to the cell membrane by the MUC1 C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C), which includes a transmembrane region and a 72 amino-acid cytoplasmic domain (MUC1-CD) ( Merlo et al , 1989 ). MUC1-CD associates with β-catenin ( Yamamoto et al , 1997 ; Li et al , 1998 ; Huang et al , 2005 ) and the p53 tumor suppressor ( Wei et al , 2005 ). In addition, MUC1-CD is phosphorylated by the epidermal growth factor receptor ( Li et al , 2001b ), c-Src ( Li et al , 2001a ) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β ( Li et al , 1998 ). Other studies have shown that overexpression of MUC1 confers transformation ( Li et al , 2003 ; Huang et al , 2005 ) and blocks the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress ( Raina et al , 2004 ; Ren et al , 2004 ). In this regard and in addition to expression at the cell membrane, MUC1-C localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane and inhibits DNA damage-induced release of apoptogenic factors ( Ren et al , 2004 , 2006 ). Mitochondrial targeting of MUC1-C is attenuated by mutation of the cytoplasmic domain at Tyr-46 ( Ren et al , 2004 , 2006 ). Moreover, expression of MUC1 with a Y46F mutation attenuates the antiapoptotic function of MUC1 in the response to DNA damage ( Ren et al , 2004 ). These findings indicate that MUC1 blocks in part the apoptotic response to genotoxic anticancer agents by disrupting the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.

The overexpression of MUC1 in most human carcinomas, the antiapoptotic function of MUC1 in the response of cancer cells to genotoxic anticancer agents and the role of c-Abl in inducing apoptosis in the DNA damage response prompted us to investigate whether MUC1 interacts with c-Abl. Our results demonstrate that MUC1 binds directly to c-Abl and sequesters c-Abl in the cytoplasm. We also show that MUC1 blocks nuclear targeting of c-Abl and thereby the apoptotic response to genotoxic anticancer agents.
