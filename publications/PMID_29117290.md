The proliferative niches in the subpallium generate a rich cellular variety 
fated for diverse telencephalic regions. The embryonic preoptic area (POA) 
represents one of these domains giving rise to the pool of cortical GABAergic 
interneurons and glial cells, in addition to striatal and residual POA cells. 
The migration from sites of origin within the subpallium to the distant targets 
like the cerebral cortex, accomplished by the adoption and maintenance of a 
particular migratory morphology, is a critical step during interneuron 
development. To identify factors orchestrating this process, we performed 
single-cell transcriptome analysis and detected Dnmt1 expression in murine 
migratory GABAergic POA-derived cells. Deletion of Dnmt1 in postmitotic immature 
cells of the POA caused defective migration and severely diminished adult 
cortical interneuron numbers. We found that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) 
preserves the migratory shape in part through negative regulation of Pak6, which 
stimulates neuritogenesis at postmigratory stages. Our data underline the 
importance of DNMT1 for the migration of POA-derived cells including cortical 
interneurons.
