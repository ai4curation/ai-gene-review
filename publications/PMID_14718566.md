The XMAP215/Dis1 MAP family is thought to regulate microtubule plus-end assembly 
in part by antagonizing the catastrophe-promoting function of kin I kinesins, 
yet XMAP215/Dis1 proteins localize to centrosomes. We probed the mitotic 
function of TOGp (human homolog of XMAP215/Dis1) using siRNA. Cells lacking TOGp 
assembled multipolar spindles, confirming results of Gergely et al. (2003. Genes 
Dev. 17, 336-341). Eg5 motor activity was necessary to maintain the multipolar 
morphology. Depletion of TOGp decreased microtubule length and density in the 
spindle by approximately 20%. Depletion of MCAK, a kin I kinesin, increased MT 
lengths and density by approximately 20%, but did not disrupt spindle 
morphology. Mitotic cells lacking both TOGp and MCAK formed bipolar and 
monopolar spindles, indicating that TOGp and MCAK contribute to spindle 
bipolarity, without major effects on MT stability. TOGp localized to centrosomes 
in the absence of MTs and depletion of TOGp resulted in centrosome 
fragmentation. TOGp depletion also disrupted MT minus-end focus at the spindle 
poles, detected by localizations of NuMA and the p150 component of dynactin. The 
major functions of TOGp during mitosis are to focus MT minus ends at spindle 
poles, maintain centrosome integrity, and contribute to spindle bipolarity.
