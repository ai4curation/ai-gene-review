Recent studies of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression 
in eukaryotic organisms depict a highly complex process requiring a coordinated 
rearrangement of numerous molecules to mediate DNA accessibility. Silencing in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves the Sir family of proteins. Sir3p, originally 
described as repressing key areas of the yeast genome through interactions with 
the tails of histones H3 and H4, appears to have additional roles in that 
process, including involvement with a DNA binding component. Our in vitro 
studies focused on the characterization of Sir3p-nucleic acid interactions and 
their biological functions in Sir3p-mediated silencing using binding assays, EM 
imaging, and theoretical modeling. Our results suggest that the initial Sir3p 
recruitment is partially DNA-driven, highly cooperative, and dependent on 
nucleosomal features other than histone tails. The initial step appears to be 
rapidly followed by the spreading of silencing using linker DNA as a track.
