We have cloned, expressed, purified and characterised ceFKB-6, the only large 
tetratricopeptide repeat motif-containing immunophilin in Caenorhabditis elegans 
which is similar to the human orthologues FKBP51 and FKBP52. It shows increased 
peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity, the measured k(cat)/K(m) of 1.3 x 10(6) 
M(-1) s(-1)is twofold greater than that of hFKBP12 and hFKBP51. NMR studies of 
the interaction between FKB-6 and the C-terminal DAF-21 pentapeptide MEEVD show 
interactions consistent with those found between the large human immunophilin 
TPR domains and human Hsp90. In vivo localisation studies show that the fkb-6 
gene is expressed in all stages from embryo to adult with predominant expression 
being noted in the adult dorsal and ventral nerve cords.
