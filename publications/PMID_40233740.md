Ferroptosis is a form of cell death due to iron-induced lipid peroxidation. 
Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) protects against this death by 
generating antioxidants, which requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, 
reduced form (NADH) as a cofactor. We initially uncover that NADH exists at 
significant levels on cellular membranes and then find that this form of NADH is 
generated by aldehyde dehydrogenase 7A1 (ALDH7A1) to support FSP1 activity. 
ALDH7A1 activity also acts directly to decrease lipid peroxidation by consuming 
reactive aldehydes. Furthermore, ALDH7A1 promotes the membrane recruitment of 
FSP1, which is instigated by ferroptotic stress activating AMP-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK) to promote the membrane localization of ALDH7A1 that stabilizes 
FSP1 on membranes. These findings advance a fundamental understanding of NADH by 
revealing a previously unappreciated pool on cellular membranes, with the 
elucidation of its function providing a major understanding of how FSP1 acts and 
how an aldehyde dehydrogenase protects against ferroptosis.
