Satellite cells in skeletal muscle are a heterogeneous population of stem cells 
and committed progenitors. We found that quiescent satellite stem cells 
expressed the Wnt receptor Fzd7 and that its candidate ligand Wnt7a was 
upregulated during regeneration. Wnt7a markedly stimulated the symmetric 
expansion of satellite stem cells but did not affect the growth or 
differentiation of myoblasts. Silencing of Fzd7 abrogated Wnt7a binding and 
stimulation of stem cell expansion. Wnt7a signaling induced the polarized 
distribution of the planar cell polarity effector Vangl2. Silencing of Vangl2 
inhibited Wnt7a action on satellite stem cell expansion. Wnt7a overexpression 
enhanced muscle regeneration and increased both satellite cell numbers and the 
proportion of satellite stem cells. Muscle lacking Wnt7a exhibited a marked 
decrease in satellite cell number following regeneration. Therefore, Wnt7a 
signaling through the planar cell polarity pathway controls the homeostatic 
level of satellite stem cells and hence regulates the regenerative potential of 
muscle.

Introduction

Satellite cells in adult skeletal muscle are located in small depressions between the sarcolemma of their host myofibers and the basal lamina. Upon damage, such as physical trauma, repeated exercise, or in disease, satellite cells become activated, proliferate and give rise to a population of myogenic precursors cells (myoblasts) expressing the myogenic regulatory factors (MRF) MyoD and Myf5. In the course of the regeneration process, myoblasts undergo multiple rounds of division before committing to terminal differentiation, fusing with the host fibers or generating new myofibers to reconstruct damaged tissue ( Charge and Rudnicki, 2004 ).

During skeletal muscle regeneration, the satellite cell population is maintained by a stem cell subpopulation, thus allowing tissue homeostasis and multiple rounds of regeneration during the lifespan of an individual ( Kuang et al., 2008 ). Transplantation experiments of either intact myofibers with their associated satellite cells ( Collins et al., 2005 ), or FACS-sorted satellite cells ( Kuang et al., 2007 ; Montarras et al., 2005 ), or individual cells ( Sacco et al., 2008 ), demonstrated that a subpopulation of quiescent satellite cells are capable of both extensive contribution to muscle regeneration and self-renewal, by giving rise to new satellite cells within the transplanted host muscle.

Recent findings from our laboratory using Cre/LoxP lineage-tracing identified a subpopulation of satellite cells which have never expressed Myf5 and function as a stem cell reservoir ( Kuang et al., 2007 ). Satellite stem cells (Pax7 + /Myf5 - ) represent about 10% of the adult satellite cell pool, and give rise to daughter satellite myogenic cells (Pax7 + /Myf5 + ) through asymmetric apical-basal cell divisions. Transplantation of both Myf5 - and Myf5 + FACS-sorted satellite cells demonstrated that satellite stem cells are capable of repopulating the adult satellite cell niche as well as self-renewal ( Kuang et al., 2007 ). However, our knowledge of the molecular networks regulating satellite stem cell fate decisions has remained unclear.

The paired-box transcription factor Pax7 plays a central regulatory role in satellite cell function and survival ( Kuang et al., 2006 ; Seale et al., 2000 ). The satellite cell population in Pax7-deficient mice is progressively lost, and the residual cells in the satellite niche are unable to sustain efficient skeletal muscle regeneration ( Kuang et al., 2006 ; Oustanina et al., 2004 ). Recent work has revealed that Pax7 recruits the Ash2L-Wdr5-MML2 histone methyltransferase complex to target genes such as Myf5 leading to Histone 3 K4 trimethylation and subsequent gene activation ( McKinnell et al., 2008 ). However, the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms that regulate the activity of Pax7 in satellite stem cells are undefined.

Wnt signaling plays a key role in regulating developmental programs through embryonic development, and in regulating stem cell function in adult tissues ( Clevers, 2006 ). Wnts have been demonstrated to be necessary for embryonic myogenic induction in the paraxial mesoderm ( Borello et al., 2006 ; Chen et al., 2005 ; Tajbakhsh et al., 1998 ), as well in the control of differentiation during muscle fiber development ( Anakwe et al., 2003 ). Recently, the Wnt planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway has been implicated in regulating the orientation of myocyte growth in the developing myotome ( Gros et al., 2009 ). In the adult, Wnt signaling is necessary for the myogenic commitment of adult stem cells in muscle tissue following acute damage ( Polesskaya et al., 2003 ; Torrente et al., 2004 ). Other studies suggest that the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates myogenic differentiation through activation and recruitment of reserve myoblasts ( Rochat et al., 2004 ). In addition, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in satellite cells within adult muscle appears to control myogenic lineage progression by limiting Notch signaling and thus promoting differentiation ( Brack et al., 2008 ).

In this study, we undertook a molecular characterization of satellite stem cells using a subtractive hybridization approach to identify uniquely expressed genes. We found that the Wnt receptor Fzd7 was markedly upregulated in quiescent satellite stem cells suggesting a role for non-canonical Wnt signaling. Investigation of this hypothesis revealed that Wnt7a is expressed during muscle regeneration and acts through its receptor Fzd7 and Vangl2, a component of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, to induce symmetric satellite stem cell expansion and dramatically enhance muscle regeneration. Together these results reveal a novel role for the PCP pathway in regulating the homeostatic maintenance of the stem cell compartment during adult skeletal muscle regeneration.

Discussion

We undertook a gene expression analysis of satellite stem cells towards identifying signaling pathways that regulate their function. Satellite stem cells represent a small subpopulation of satellite cells that are capable of self-renewal and long-term reconstitution of the satellite cell niche following transplantation ( Kuang et al., 2007 ). Our experiments identified the non-canonical Wnt-receptor Fzd7 as being specifically expressed in quiescent satellite cells ( Figure 1 ). Wnt7a was examined as a candidate receptor for Fzd7 because of its expression and role during embryonic and adult myogenesis ( Chen et al., 2005 ; Cossu and Borello, 1999 ; Polesskaya et al., 2003 ; Tajbakhsh et al., 1998 ). We found by Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry that Wnt7a was markedly upregulated in newly formed myofibers during regenerative myogenesis ( Figure 2B, 2E ), and that the Fzd7 receptor is necessary for Wnt7a binding at the surface of myogenic cells ( Figure 2C ).

Satellite stem cells undergo apical-basal asymmetric cell divisions to give rise to committed myogenic cells that express Myf5, and to maintain their population through self-renewal. Alternatively, satellite stem cells can undergo planar symmetric cell divisions to drive expansion of their population ( Kuang et al., 2007 ). Importantly, we found that recombinant Wnt7a protein dramatically stimulated the symmetric expansion of satellite stem cells and that this expansion required Fzd7 and Vangl2 ( Figures 3 and 5 ), both components of the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. Moreover, Wnt7a induced polarized localization of Vangl2 at opposite poles in pairs of dividing cells ( Figure 4 ), in a manner consistent with Wnt7a activating PCP signaling. Over expression of Wnt7a during muscle regeneration resulted in an impressive enhancement of the regeneration process, generating more fibers of bigger caliber, independent of an effect on myoblast proliferation or differentiation ( Figure 6 ). Importantly, Wnt7a over-expression resulted in a large expansion of the satellite stem cell population, and Wnt7a loss resulted in impaired maintenance of the satellite cell compartment ( Figure 7 ). These results provide important new insights into the molecular regulation of satellite cell self-renewal, and for the first time implicate the Wnt non-canonical PCP pathway in the regulation of adult stem cell function.

The Wnt-PCP pathway plays a role in patterning by instituting polarity of cells within a tissue, such as with the organized orientation of epithelial cells in Drosophila ( Zallen, 2007 ). In vertebrates, PCP signaling, and particularly its effecter Vangl2 (also known as Strabismus), is required for the polarization of stereociliary bundles in the cochlea ( Montcouquiol et al., 2003 ), for convergent extension (CE) movements regulating gastrulation and neurulation ( Torban et al., 2004 ), neural tube closure ( Torban et al., 2008 ), and in regulating myocyte orientation in the developing myotome ( Gros et al., 2009 ). During zebrafish neurulation, loss of Vangl2 abrogates polarization of neural keel cells by preventing re-intercalation of daughter cells into the neuroepithelium, resulting in ectopic neural progenitor accumulation ( Ciruna et al., 2006 ).

We propose that the symmetric expansion of satellite stem cells results from a PCP-mediated orientation of the axis of stem cell division. Since PCP is a positional signaling relying on the redistribution of effectors proteins, polarization of PCP core molecules on opposite poles of the daughter cells allows both cells to maintain contact with the basal lamina and thus preserve their orientation relative to the niche ( Figure 4 and S9 ). Notably, Wnt7a induced polarized distribution of Vangl2 and α7-integrin ( Figure 4E ). The upregulated and polarized localization of α7-integrin allows both daughter cells to remain attached to the basal lamina. By contrast, α7-integrin expression is reduced and evenly distributed in apical-basal oriented cell divisions. Daughter cells that are “pushed” towards the sarcolemma thus losing contact with the basal lamina, activate Myf5 transcription and commit to a progenitor state ( Kuang et al., 2007 ). Therefore, these data suggest that the PCP pathway intersects with the mechanisms that control apical-basal cell divisions and commitment and function through a mechanism that promotes adhesion to the basal lamina.

Our experiments suggest that polarized distribution of Vangl2 protein at the poles of a couplet of daughter cells allows both cells to remain attached to the basal lamina, and therefore maintain a stem cell state, resulting in expansion of the stem cell population. Subsequent cell divisions will generate larger numbers of committed daughter cells through apical-basal asymmetric divisions that will undergo normal expansion and differentiation ( Figure 6 ). We previously noted that the proportion of Pax7 + /Myf5 - satellite stem cells increased from 10% to about 30% at 3 weeks following injury ( Kuang et al., 2007 ), and that overexpression of Wnt7a further increased the level to 50% ( Figure 7C, 7D ). By contrast, satellite cell numbers decreased by 36% in Wnt7a-deficient muscle following injury and regeneration Figure 7G ). These data strongly support the model through which Wnt7a regulates the homeostatic maintenance of the satellite stem cell pool by modulating the increase in satellite stem cell expansion during regenerative myogenesis and that basal levels of PCP signaling are insufficient to maintain the satellite cell pool at normal levels.

In the fly, it has been demonstrated that in parallel to the frizzled-induced PCP signaling, Strabismus collaborates with Flamingo to mediate planar cell orientation. A secondary PCP mechanism is regulated by the protocadherins Fat and Dachsous independently of the core effectors Frizzled and Strabismus ( Zallen, 2007 ). In our in vitro single myofiber system, the basal rate of symmetric divisions was not perturbed by the loss of Fzd7. By contrast, silencing of Vangl2 not only abrogated Wnt7a stimulation of symmetric expansion but also reduced the basal state of symmetric stem cell division. Therefore, it is likely that other PCP mechanisms, dependent on Vangl2, or on the protocadherins, mediate basal PCP signaling independent of Wnt binding.

It is possible that basal levels of PCP signaling are activated through other effectors. One such candidate is Syndecan4 (Syn4), a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed by quiescent satellite cells and their activated progeny ( Cornelison et al., 2001 ). Satellite cells in mice deficient for Syn4 are compromised in activation, proliferation, and differentiation in vitro , and they fail to reconstitute damaged muscle in vivo ( Cornelison et al., 2004 ). Importantly, during Xenopus embryogenesis, xSyn4 interacts directly with xFzd7 and xDsh to activate non-canonical Wnt-signaling to regulate convergent and extension (CE) movements ( Munoz et al., 2006 ). In addition, Syn4 and non-canonical Wnt signaling regulates the directional migration of neural crest cells ( Matthews et al., 2008 ). Therefore, Syn4 and Fzd7 appear to cooperate to activate non-canonical Wnt signaling through the PCP pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that Syn4 expression was severely perturbed in satellite cells following Vangl2 silencing on myofibers (not shown). Thus, the inability of satellite cells from Syn4 -/- mice to regenerate muscle may be a consequence of a defect in PCP signaling.

Canonical Wnt-signaling plays a well-documented role in regulating myogenic growth and differentiation. Recently, the temporal balance between proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells in adult muscle was demonstrated to be regulated by cross-talk between Notch and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways ( Brack et al., 2008 ). Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway inhibits Notch-mediated maintenance of the undifferentiated state and thus facilitates differentiation. Our experiments indicate that activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling using Wnt3a did not interfere with satellite stem cell choice between commitment and symmetric expansion ( Figures 3B , 4D ). Nevertheless, over-expression of Wnt3a in vivo appeared to impair regeneration possibly by promoting premature differentiation and the formation of myofibers of reduced size ( Figure 6 ). Indeed, Wnt3a stimulation of satellite cells on single myofibers drove their differentiation as evidenced by significant increase in the number of Pax7 - /MyoD + cells (not shown). However, we were unable to detect Wnt3a expression in undamaged or regenerating skeletal muscle by Real-Time PCR. Potentially other upregulated Wnts, such as Wnt10a ( Figure 2B , S4 ), may function to activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in myogenic cells. Furthermore, we observed a large up-regulation of the Wnt-inhibitors sFRPs during the early stages of the regenerative process. Perhaps this represents a physiological feedback system that inhibits canonical Wnt signaling, allowing the proliferation of myogenic progenitors. Thus, as hypothesized by Brack et al., (2008) , inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling would act to promote muscle regeneration.

In Xenopus embryos, the Vangl2 homolog Strabismus inhibits Wnt/β-catenin activated transcription by competing for Disheveled ( Park and Moon, 2002 ). Thus, PCP signaling may also act to keep satellite stem cells in an uncommitted state by antagonizing canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In Drosophila eye development, Frizzled (Fz)/PCP signaling induces cell-fate specification of the R3/R4 photoreceptors through regulation of Notch activation in R4 ( del Alamo and Mlodzik, 2006 ). This raises the possibility that cross-talk between Frizzled/PCP and Notch pathways, as well as Wnt/β-catenin pathways, act to coordinate satellite stem cell choice between self-renewal/commitment versus expansion.

Molecular characterization of satellite stem cells is providing important insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating their function. Our identification of a role for the Wnt7a/Fzd7/Vangl2 signal transduction cascade reveals an unanticipated role for the PCP pathway in regulating the symmetric expansion of satellite stem cells. This finding represents a significant advance in our understanding of satellite cell biology and muscle regeneration. Future experiments will investigate both the utility of modulating the PCP pathway to augment muscle regeneration towards ameliorating the loss of muscle function in neuromuscular disease.
