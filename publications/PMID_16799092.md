In a recent report, we introduced Extended Range Proteomic Analysis (ERPA), an 
intermediate approach between top-down and bottom-up proteomics, for the 
comprehensive characterization at the trace level (fmol level) of large and 
complex proteins. In this study, we extended ERPA to determine quantitatively 
the temporal changes that occur in the tyrosine kinase receptor, epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR), upon stimulation. Specifically A 431 cells were 
stimulated with epidermal growth factor after which EGFR was immunoprecipitated 
at stimulation times of 0, 0.5, 2, and 10 min as well as 4 h. High sequence 
coverage was obtained (96%), and methods were developed for label-free 
quantitation of phosphorylation and glycosylation. A total of 13 phosphorylation 
sites were identified, and the estimated stoichiometry was determined over the 
stimulation time points, including Thr(P) and Ser(P) sites in addition to Tyr(P) 
sites. A total of 10 extracellular domain N-glycan sites were also identified, 
and major glycoforms at each site were quantitated. No change in the extent of 
glycosylation with stimulation was observed as expected. Finally potential 
binding partners to EGFR were identified based on changes in the amount of 
protein pulled down with EGFR as a function of time of stimulation. Many of the 
19 proteins identified are known binding partners of EGFR. This work 
demonstrates that comprehensive characterization provides a powerful tool to aid 
in the study of important therapeutic targets. The detailed molecular 
information will prove useful in future studies in tissue.
