System L is a major nutrient transport system responsible for the 
Na(+)-independent transport of large neutral amino acids including several 
essential amino acids. In malignant tumors, a system L transporter L-type amino 
acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is up-regulated to support tumor cell growth. LAT1 is 
also essential for the permeation of amino acids and amino acid-related drugs 
through the blood-brain barrier. To search for in vitro assay systems to examine 
the interaction of chemical compounds with LAT1, we have investigated the 
expression of system L transporters and the properties of [14C]L-leucine 
transport in T24 human bladder carcinoma cells. Northern blot, real-time 
quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence analyses have reveled that T24 cells 
express LAT1 in the plasma membrane together with its associating protein 4F2hc, 
whereas T24 cells do not express the other system L isoform LAT2. The uptake of 
[14C]L-leucine by T24 cells is Na(+)-independent and almost completely inhibited 
by system L selective inhibitor BCH. The profiles of the inhibition of 
[14C]L-leucine uptake by amino acids and amino acid-related compounds in T24 
cells are comparable with those for the LAT1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The 
majority of [14C]L-leucine uptake is, therefore, mediated by LAT1 in T24 cells. 
Consistent with LAT1 in Xenopus oocytes, the efflux of preloaded [14C]L-leucine 
is induced by extracellularly applied substrates of LAT1 in T24 cells. This 
efflux measurement has been proven to be more sensitive than that in Xenopus 
oocytes, because triiodothyronine, thyroxine and melphalan were able to induce 
the efflux of preloaded [14C]L-leucine in T24 cells, which was not detected for 
Xenopus oocyte expression system. T24 cell is, therefore, proposed to be an 
excellent tool to examine the interaction of chemical compounds with LAT1.
