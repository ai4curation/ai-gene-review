The E6 and E7 proteins of the high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) act 
coordinately to immortalize human keratinocytes. These viral oncoproteins 
function by binding and altering the activity of cellular proteins which 
regulate cell cycle progression. Among the proteins bound by E7 are the 
retinoblastoma protein, Rb, as well as the related p107 and p130 proteins. In 
addition, E7 binds cyclin A, which regulates transit through the S and G2/M 
phases of the cell cycle. In this study, we demonstrate that HPV 18 E7 also 
associates with cyclin E which controls the G1/S transition. E7/cyclin E 
complexes were immunoprecipitated from E7-expressing cells as well as from cell 
extracts using GST-E7 fusion proteins. E7 was found to complex with a single 
form of cyclin E, and the binding was mediated through p107. Both E7/cyclin E 
and E7/cyclin A complexes exhibit kinase activity through associated cdk2 
proteins which can contribute to phosphorylation of p107. The association of E7 
with proteins which regulate transit through the cell cycle may provide an 
additional mechanism by which infection with human papillomaviruses results in 
cellular hyperproliferation.
