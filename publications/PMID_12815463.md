The Drosophila spinster (spin) gene product is required for programmed cell 
death in the nervous and reproductive systems. We have identified a human 
homologue of the Drosophila spin gene product (HSpin1). HSpin1 bound to Bcl-2 
and apoptosis regulator Bcl-X (Bcl-xL), but not to proapoptotic members such as 
Bcl-2-associated X protein and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer, in cells 
treated with TNF-alpha. Exogenous expression of HSpin1 resulted in the cell 
death without inducing a release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. 
Overexpression of Bcl-xL inhibited the HSpin1-induced cell death. Interestingly, 
a necrosis inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbomate, but not the pancaspase 
inhibitors, carbobenzoxy-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone and p35, blocked the 
HSpin1-induced cell death. HSpin1-induced cell death increases autophagic 
vacuole and mature form of cathepsin D, suggesting a novel caspase-independent 
cell death, which is link to autophagy.
