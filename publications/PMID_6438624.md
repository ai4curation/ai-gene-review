A product of yeast RAS2 gene is a guanine nucleotide binding protein.

Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two genes, RAS1 and RAS2, which show 
remarkable homology to mammalian ras genes. To characterize these gene products, 
we have expressed the RAS2 gene in yeast using an inducible GAL10 promoter. 
After labeling with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitating with a monoclonal 
antibody Y13-259, which reacts with p21 encoded by mammalian ras genes, a major 
band having an apparent molecular weight of 41,000 is detected. This band has 
also been identified in cell-free translation products of polyadenylated RNA 
extracted from yeast cells grown in the presence of galactose. Crude extracts of 
cells expressing the RAS2 gene exhibit guanine nucleotide binding activity. This 
is detected by incubation with [3H]GDP followed by immunoprecipitation with the 
antibody Y13-259. The binding of labeled GDP is inhibited by a 20-fold excess of 
GDP, GTP, and, to a lesser extent, by UTP, a characteristic similar to that 
possessed by the mammalian ras proteins. However, the activity of the yeast 
protein differs from that of the mammalian proteins in its strong dependence on 
temperature. The guanine nucleotide binding activity provides an assay to purify 
the yeast protein.
