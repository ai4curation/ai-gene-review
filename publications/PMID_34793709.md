Rab9 is mainly located on late endosomes and required for their intracellular 
transport to trans-Golgi network (TGN). The cytoplasmic dynein motor, together 
with its regulatory proteins Nde1/Ndel1 and Lis1, controls intracellular 
retrograde transport of membranous organelles along the microtubule network. How 
late endosomes are tethered to the microtubule-based motor dynein for their 
retrograde transport remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the guanosine 
triphosphate (GTP)-bound Rab9A/B specifically uses Nde1/Ndel1 as an effector to 
interact with the dynein motor complex. We determined the crystal structure of 
Rab9A-GTP in complex with the Rab9-binding region of Nde1. The functional roles 
of key residues involved in the Rab9A-Nde1 interaction are verified using 
biochemical and cell biology assays. Rab9A mutants unable to bind to Nde1 also 
failed to associate with dynein, Lis1, and dynactin. Therefore, Nde1 is a Rab9 
effector that tethers Rab9-associated late endosomes to the dynein motor for 
their retrograde transport to the TGN.
