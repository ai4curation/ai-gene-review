The cellulosome-integrating protein CipA, which serves as a scaffolding protein 
for the cellulolytic complex produced by Clostridium thermocellum, comprises a 
COOH-terminal duplicated segment termed the dockerin domain. This paper reports 
the cloning and sequencing of a gene, termed sdbA (for scaffoldin dockerin 
binding), encoding a protein which specifically binds the dockerin domain of 
CipA. The sequenced fragment comprises an open reading frame of 1,893 
nucleotides encoding a 631-amino-acid polypeptide, termed SdbA, with a 
calculated molecular mass of 68,577 kDa. SAA comprises an NH2-terminal leader 
peptide followed by three distinct regions. The NH2-terminal region is similar 
to the NH2-terminal repeats of C. thermocellum OlpB and ORF2p. The central 
region is rich in lysine and harbors a motif present in Streptococcus M 
proteins. The COOH-terminal region consists of a triplicated sequence present in 
several bacterial cell surface proteins. The NH2-terminal region of SdbA and a 
fusion protein carrying the first NH2-terminal repeat of OlpB were shown to bind 
the dockerin domain of CipA. Thus, a new type of cohesin domain, which is 
present in one, two, and four copies in SdbA, ORF2p, and OlpB, respectively, can 
be defined. Since OlpB and most likely SdbA and ORF2p are located in the cell 
envelope, the three proteins probably participate in anchoring CipA (and the 
cellulosome) to the cell surface.
