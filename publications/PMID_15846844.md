Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a causative agent of chronic hepatitis and 
hepatocellular carcinoma. The core protein of HCV packages the viral RNA genome 
to form a nucleocapsid. In addition to its function as a structural protein, 
core protein is involved in regulation of cellular transcription, virus-induced 
transformation, and pathogenesis. To gain insights into cellular functions of 
the core protein by identification of cellular proteins interacting with the 
core protein, we employed a proteomic approach. Hepatocytes soluble cytoplasmic 
proteins were applied to the core proteins immobilized on Ni-nitrilotriacetic 
resin and total bound cellular proteins were resolved by 2-DE. Analyses of 
interacting proteins by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of 
flight mass spectrometry allowed identification of 14 cellular proteins binding 
to the core protein. These proteins include DEAD-box polypeptide 5, similar in 
function to a known protein identified previously by yeast two-hybrid screening 
and 13 newly identified cellular proteins. Interestingly, nine protein spots 
were identified as intermediate microfilament proteins, including cytokeratins 
(five spots for cytokeratin 8, two for cytokeratin 19, and one for cytokeratin 
18) and vimentin. Cytokeratin 8 and vimentin, which were previously shown to be 
involved in the infection processes of other viruses, were further analyzed to 
confirm their in vivo interactions with the core protein by immunoblotting and 
immunofluorescence microscopy. We discuss the functional implications of the 
interactions of the core protein with newly identified cellular proteins in HCV 
infection and pathogenesis.
