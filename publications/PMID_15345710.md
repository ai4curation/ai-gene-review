The molecular mechanisms by which mammalian receptor tyrosine kinases are 
negatively regulated remain largely unexplored. Previous genetic and biochemical 
studies indicate that Kekkon-1, a transmembrane protein containing leucine-rich 
repeats and an immunoglobulin-like domain in its extracellular region, acts as a 
feedback negative regulator of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling 
in Drosophila melanogaster development. Here we tested whether the related human 
LRIG1 (also called Lig-1) protein can act as a negative regulator of EGF 
receptor and its relatives, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. We observed that in 
co-transfected 293T cells, LRIG1 forms a complex with each of the ErbB receptors 
independent of growth factor binding. We further observed that co-expression of 
LRIG1 with EGF receptor suppresses cellular receptor levels, shortens receptor 
half-life, and enhances ligand-stimulated receptor ubiquitination. Finally, we 
observed that co-expression of LRIG1 suppresses EGF-stimulated transformation of 
NIH3T3 fibroblasts and that the inducible expression of LRIG1 in PC3 prostate 
tumor cells suppresses EGF- and neuregulin-1-stimulated cell cycle progression. 
Our observations indicate that LRIG1 is a negative regulator of the ErbB family 
of receptor tyrosine kinases and suggest that LRIG1-mediated receptor 
ubiquitination and degradation may contribute to the suppression of ErbB 
receptor function.
