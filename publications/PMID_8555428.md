Estrous cycle modulation of immunologic sensitivity to ethylene dibromide (EDB) 
was studied in addition to toxicologic end points. Female B6C3F1 mice were 
injected intragastrically with 31.25, 62.5, or 125 mg/kg EDB for 5 days a week 
for 12 weeks. Vaginal smears determined the estrous cycle. At 125 mg/kg there 
were decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit and longer estrous cycles (5.5 vs 
4.3 days, p = 0.006), and increases in cholesterol, triglycerides, total 
protein, and albumin. The negative dose response seen for T- and B-cell 
mitogenesis around metestrus was absent for mice near estrus. The high dose of 
EDB prolonged intervals between estrus, was immunotoxic and immunosuppressive.
