Autophagy is a process for the bulk degradation of cytosolic compartments by 
lysosomes/vacuoles. The formation of autophagosomes involves a dynamic 
rearrangement of the membrane for which two ubiquitin-like modifications (the 
conjugation of Apg12p and the modification of a soluble form of MAP-LC3 to a 
membrane-bound form) are essential. In yeast, Apg10p is an E2-like enzyme 
essential for Apg12p conjugation. The isolated mouse APG10 gene product 
interacts with mammalian Apg12p dependent on mammalian Apg7p (E1-like enzyme), 
and facilitates Apg12p conjugation. The interaction of Apg10p with Apg12p is 
dependent on the carboxyl-terminal glycine of Apg12p. Mutational analysis of the 
predicted active site cysteine (Cys161) within mouse Apg10p shows that mutant 
Apg10pC161S, which can form a stable intermediate with Apg12p, inhibits Apg12p 
conjugation even in the presence of Apg7p, while overexpression of Apg7p 
facilitates formation of an Apg12p-Apg5p conjugate. Furthermore, the 
coexpression of Apg10p with Apg7p facilitates the modification of a soluble form 
of MAP-LC3 to a membrane-bound form, a second modification essential for 
autophagy. Mouse Apg10p interacts with MAP-LC3 in HEK293 cells, while no mutant 
Apg10pC161S forms any intermediate with MAP-LC3. Direct interaction between 
Apg10p and MAP-LC3 is also demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid analysis. The 
inability of mutant Apg10pC161S to form any intermediate with MAP-LC3 has ruled 
out the possibility that MAP-LC3 interacts with Apg10p as a substrate.
