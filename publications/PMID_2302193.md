Complex II (succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is an important enzyme complex 
of both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and of the aerobic respiratory chains of 
mitochondria in eukaryotic cell and prokaryotic organisms. In this study, the 
amino acid sequence of iron sulfur-subunit in human liver mitochondria was 
deduced from cDNA which was isolated by immunoscreening a human liver lambda 
gtll cDNA library. An isolated clone contains an open reading frame of 786 
nucleotides and encodes a mature protein of 252 amino acids with a molecular 
weight of 28,804. The amino acid sequence was highly homologous with that of 
bovine heart (94.1%) which has been determined from the purified peptide and 
that of Escherichia coli sdh B product (50.8%). Striking sequence conservation 
was found around the three cysteine-rich clusters which have been thought to 
comprise the iron-sulfur centers of the enzyme. This is the first report on the 
cDNA sequence of mitochondrial complex II.
