Highly purified peripheral blood monocytes were cultured in the presence of 
rIL-4. Major changes in the morphology of the monocytes were observed. After day 
5 of culturing the cells acquired a macrophage-like appearance, with increased 
cell size and extensive processes, suggesting that IL-4 may induce 
monocyte-macrophage differentiation. This notion is supported by the observed 
increased expression of MHC class II Ag, which is thought to be associated with 
monocyte differentiation. Exposure of monocytes to IL-4 resulted in a 
dose-dependent increase of the expression of MHC class II Ag, which became 
apparent after only 20 h of incubation. Maximal expression was obtained after 
incubation for 6 days, and persisted throughout the whole culture period. 
Similarly, IL-4 increased the expression of R for C3bi and p150.95 Ag, two 
members of the leukocyte function-associated Ag 1 family, whereas the expression 
of the third member, leukocyte function-associated Ag 1, remained unchanged 
during culture. Furthermore, it was shown that IL-4 inhibited the secretion of 
cytostatic and chemotactic compounds. Supernatants of monocytes cultured with 
IL-4 were, in contrast to control cultures, much less effective in inhibiting 
the growth of A375 melanoma cells. In addition, these supernatants failed to 
direct the migration of freshly isolated monocytes in a chemotaxis assay. 
Further analysis revealed that these supernatants exhibited reduced IL-1 
activity, as measured in a mouse thymocyte proliferation assay, which might 
explain the low cytostatic and chemotactic activity. Taken together these 
results show that IL-4 modulates monocyte phenotype and function and may induce 
monocyte-macrophage differentiation in vitro.
