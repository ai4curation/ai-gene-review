We employed the polymerase chain reaction and genomic DNA library screening to 
clone novel human genes, GPR9 and GPR10, and a rat gene, GPR14. GPR9, GPR10, and 
GPR14 each encode G protein-coupled receptors. GPR10 and GPR14 are intronless 
within their coding regions, while GPR9 contains at least one intron. The 
receptor encoded by GPR9 shares the highest identity with human IL-8 receptor 
type B (38% overall and 53% in the transmembrane regions), followed by IL-8 
receptor type A (36% overall and 51% in the transmembrane domains). GPR10 
encodes a receptor that shares highest identity with the neuropeptide Y receptor 
(31% overall and 46% in the transmembrane domains). The receptor encoded by 
GPR14 shares highest identity with the somatostatin receptor SSTR 4 (27% overall 
and 41% in the transmembrane domains). Fluorescence in situ hybridization 
analysis localized GPR9 to chromosome 8p11.2-p12 and GPR10 to chromosome 
10q25.3-q26.
