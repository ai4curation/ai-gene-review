During misfolded-protein stress, the cytoplasmic protein histone deacetylase 6 
(HDAC6) functions as a linker between the dynein motor and polyubiquitin to 
mediate the transport of polyubiquitylated cargo to the aggresome. Here, we 
identify a new binding partner of HDAC6, the ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10 (also 
known as UBD), which is cytokine-inducible and - similar to ubiquitin - serves 
as a signal for proteasomal degradation. In vivo, the two proteins only 
interacted under conditions of proteasome impairment. The binding of HDAC6 to 
FAT10 was mediated by two separate domains: the C-terminal ubiquitin-binding 
zinc-finger (BUZ domain) of HDAC6 and its first catalytic domain, even though 
catalytic activity of HDAC6 was not required for this interaction. Both 
endogenous and ectopically expressed FAT10 as well as the model conjugate 
FAT10-GFP localized to the aggresome in a microtubule-dependent manner. 
Furthermore, FAT10-containing as well as ubiquitin-containing aggresomes were 
reduced in both size and number in HDAC6-deficient fibroblasts. We conclude 
that, if FAT10 fails to subject its target proteins to proteasomal degradation, 
an alternative route is taken to ensure their sequestration and possibly also 
their subsequent removal by transporting them to the aggresome via the 
association with HDAC6.
