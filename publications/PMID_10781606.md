We have recently purified a rat brain membrane-bound nonlysosomal ceramidase (El 
Bawab, S., Bielawska, A., and Y. A. Hannun (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 
27948-27955). Using peptide sequences obtained from the purified rat brain 
enzyme, we report here the cloning of the human isoform. The deduced amino acid 
sequence of the protein did not show any similarity with proteins of known 
function but was homologous to three putative proteins from Arabidospis 
thaliana, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Dictyostelium discoideum. Several 
blocks of amino acids were highly conserved in all of these proteins. Analysis 
of the protein sequence revealed the presence at the N terminus of a signal 
peptide followed by a putative myristoylation site and a putative mitochondrial 
targeting sequence. The predicted molecular mass was 84 kDa, and the isoelectric 
point was 6.69, in agreement with rat brain purified enzyme. Northern blot 
analysis of multiple human tissues showed the presence of a major band 
corresponding to a size of 3.5 kilobase. Analysis of this major band on the blot 
indicated that the enzyme is ubiquitously expressed with higher levels in 
kidney, skeletal muscle, and heart. The enzyme was then overexpressed in HEK 293 
and MCF7 cells using the pcDNA3. 1/His-ceramidase construct, and ceramidase 
activity (at pH 9.5) increased by 50- and 12-fold, respectively. Next, the 
enzyme was characterized using lysate of overexpressing cells. The results 
confirmed that the enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramide in the neutral 
alkaline range and is independent of cations. Finally, a green fluorescent 
protein-ceramidase fusion protein was constructed to investigate the 
localization of this enzyme. The results showed that the green fluorescent 
protein-ceramidase fusion protein presented a mitochondrial localization pattern 
and colocalized with mitochondrial specific probes. These results demonstrate 
that this novel ceramidase is a mitochondrial enzyme, and they suggest the 
existence of a topologically restricted pathways of sphingolipid metabolism.
