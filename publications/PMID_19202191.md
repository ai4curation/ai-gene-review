In G(0) and G(1), DNA double strand breaks are repaired by nonhomologous end 
joining, whereas in S and G(2), they are also repaired by homologous 
recombination. The human CtIP protein controls double strand break (DSB) 
resection, an event that occurs effectively only in S/G(2) and that promotes 
homologous recombination but not non-homologous end joining. Here, we mutate a 
highly conserved cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) target motif in CtIP and reveal 
that mutating Thr-847 to Ala impairs resection, whereas mutating it to Glu to 
mimic constitutive phosphorylation does not. Moreover, we show that unlike cells 
expressing wild-type CtIP, cells expressing the Thr-to-Glu mutant resect DSBs 
even after CDK inhibition. Finally, we establish that Thr-847 mutations to 
either Ala or Glu affect DSB repair efficiency, cause hypersensitivity toward 
DSB-generating agents, and affect the frequency and nature of radiation-induced 
chromosomal rearrangements. These results suggest that CDK-mediated control of 
resection in human cells operates by mechanisms similar to those recently 
established in yeast.
