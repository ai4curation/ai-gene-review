AP-3 is a heterotetrameric adaptor involved in the biogenesis of 
lysosome-related organelles. The function of AP-3 as an adaptor relies on its 
ability to bind to membranes in an Arf-dependent fashion and to recognize 
sorting signals in the cytosolic tails of the transmembrane cargo. Here, we 
report an interdomain interaction involving the ear domain of the delta subunit 
and the sigma3 subunit of AP-3. This interaction interferes with the binding of 
AP-3 to Arf but not to dileucine-based sorting signals. As a consequence, the 
delta-ear inhibits the recruitment of AP-3 to membranes both in vitro and in 
vivo and impairs the sorting of lysosomal membrane proteins. These observations 
suggest a new regulatory mechanism for the recruitment of AP-3 to membranes 
involving delta-ear-sigma3 interactions.
