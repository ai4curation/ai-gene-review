BACKGROUND: Chronic low oxygen in the tubulointerstitial area is a crucial cause 
of renal degradation and tubulointerstitial damage. Previous reports have 
suggested that the maintenance of renal blood flow plays a role in the 
suppression of progressive renal damage. Neovascularization is important for the 
maintenance of blood flow. We studied the production of angiogenic factors by 
culturing renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) under hypoxic 
conditions.
METHODS: Cultured PTEC were exposed to normal and low-oxygen conditions. The 
levels of angiogenin (ANG) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the 
cell supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The 
messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of ANG and VEGF in the PTEC were examined by real-time 
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR). The presence 
of ANG, VEGF and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) was studied by 
immunofluorescence techniques. The effect of cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)), which is 
an HIF-1 inducer, on the production of ANG and VEGF was also examined in order 
to elucidate the contribution of the HIF-1 pathway to the production of these 
cytokines.
RESULTS: ANG and VEGF were demonstrated to exist in the cell supernatants, and 
ANG and VEGF mRNAs were detected in the PTEC. Hypoxic conditions stimulated the 
secretion of ANG (2.5-fold vs normoxia, P<0.001) and VEGF (3.2-fold vs normoxia, 
P<0.001) by PTEC. Hypoxic conditions increased the mRNA expression of ANG for 6 
h (1.38-fold vs normoxia, P<0.05) and VEGF for 24 h (2.04-fold vs normoxia, 
P<0.01). Hypoxic conditions also enhanced ANG, VEGF and HIF-1 protein expression 
in PTEC. The CoCl(2) increased the secretion of ANG (5.2-fold vs control, 
P<0.0001) and VEGF (2.3-fold vs control, P<0.0001) by PTEC.
CONCLUSION: Under hypoxic conditions, the ANG and VEGF secreted by PTEC may 
modulate angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in the renal interstitium via an 
increase in the production of HIF-1.
