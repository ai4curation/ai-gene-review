We report that a purified cytoplasmic Hsp70 homolog from Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, Hsp70SSA1, exhibits a weak ATPase activity, which is stimulated by a 
purified eukaryotic dnaJp homolog (YDJ1p). Stable complex formation between 
Hsp70SSA1 and the permanently unfolded protein carboxymethylated 
alpha-lactalbumin (CMLA) was assayed by native gel electrophoresis. The affinity 
of Hsp70SSA1 for CMLA appeared to be regulated by YDJ1p. Significant reduction 
in both CMLA-Hsp70SSA1 complex formation and the release of CMLA pre-bound to 
Hsp70SSA1 was observed only in the presence of both YDJ1p and ATP. Thus, 
Hsp70SSA1 and YDJ1p interact functionally in the execution of Hsp70SSA1 
chaperone activities in the eukaryotic cell.
