Chimeric mice in which lymphocytes are deficient in the Syk tyrosine kinase have 
been created. Compared with Syk-positive controls, mice with Syk -/- lymphocytes 
display substantial depletion of intraepithelial gamma delta T cells in the skin 
and gut, with developmental arrest occurring after antigen receptor gene 
rearrangement. In this dependence on Syk, subsets of intraepithelial gamma delta 
T cells are similar to B cells, but distinct from splenic gamma delta T cells 
that develop and expand in Syk-deficient mice. The characteristic associations 
of certain T-cell receptor V gamma/V delta gene rearrangements with specific 
epithelia are also disrupted by Syk deficiency.
