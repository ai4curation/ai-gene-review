PROBLEM: Progesterone induced blocking factor (PIBF) is a mediator of 
progesterone that blocks peripheral blood lytic natural killer (NK) activity. 
Progesterone or PIBF stimulated decidual macrophages block up-regulation of 
perforin expression in decidual lymphocytes (DL). Therefore, we investigated 
whether progesterone regulates cytotoxicity of DL. METHOD OD STUDY: Decidual 
mononuclear cells were cultured with progesterone. PIBF, progesterone and 
anti-PIBF antibody or in the medium only. Cytolytic activity of non-adherent DL 
was measured by PKH-26 (red) 2 hr cytolytic assay and flow cytometry. Perforin 
positive DL were detected by immunofluorescency and PIBF-positive cells by 
immunohistology.
RESULTS: Progesterone and PIBF, in a dose-dependent manner decreased 
cytotoxicity of DL against K-562 targets, and perforin egzocytosys was blocked. 
Anti-PIBF antibodies reversed the progesterone mediated reduction in cytolytic 
activity of DL. PIBF positive cells were found in first trimester pregnancy 
decidua.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate possible role for PIBF, as a mediator of 
progesterone in regulation of DL cytolytic activity at the maternal-foetal (M-F) 
interface.
