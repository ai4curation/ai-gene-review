Desmosomes are cell-cell adhesive structures essential for tissue integrity of 
the epidermis and the heart. Their constituents belong to multigene families 
giving rise to desmosomes of variable composition. So far, the functional 
significance of context-dependent composition in desmosome formation, dynamics, 
or stability during epidermal differentiation is incompletely understood. In 
this comparative study, we have uncovered unique and partially antagonistic 
functions of plakophilins 1 and 3 that are both expressed in the murine 
epidermis. These plakophilins differ in their localization patterns and kinetics 
during de novo desmosome formation and are regulated by distinct mechanisms. 
Moreover, plakophilin 3-containing desmosomes are more dynamic than desmosomes 
that contain predominantly plakophilin 1. Further, we show that 
Ca(2+)-independence of desmosomes strictly depends on plakophilin 1, whereas 
elevated levels of plakophilin 3 prevent the formation of hyperadhesive 
desmosomes in a protein kinase C alpha-dependent manner, even in the presence of 
plakophilin 1. Our study demonstrates that the balance between plakophilins 1 
and 3 determines the context-dependent properties of epidermal desmosomes. In 
this setting, plakophilin 1 provides stable intercellular cohesion that resists 
mechanical stress, whereas plakophilin 3 confers dynamics as required during 
tissue homeostasis and repair. Our data have implications for the role of 
plakophilins in carcinogenesis.
