The AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3' untranslated region of unstable mRNAs 
mediate their rapid degradation. ARE binding proteins (AUBPs) have been 
described that either stabilize or otherwise degrade ARE-mRNAs by recruiting the 
exosome, a complex of 3'-to-5' exoribonucleases. We have identified RHAU, a 
putative DExH RNA helicase that was isolated in association with the ARE of 
urokinase plasminogen activator mRNA (ARE(uPA)). RHAU physically interacts with 
the deadenylase PARN and the human exosome and enhances the deadenylation and 
decay of ARE(uPA)-mRNAs. An alternatively spliced isoform of RHAU that localized 
to the cytoplasm had a more pronounced effect on ARE(uPA)-mRNA destabilization 
than full-length RHAU. Furthermore, the ATPase activity of RHAU is essential for 
its mRNA-destabilizing function. ARE(uPA)-mRNA recognition by RHAU may be 
mediated through its RNA-dependent interaction with the AUBPs HuR and NFAR1. A 
model is presented to describe the action of RHAU in ARE(uPA)-directed mRNA 
turnover.
