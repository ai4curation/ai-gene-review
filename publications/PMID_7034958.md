Osteonectin, a bone-specific protein linking mineral to collagen.

Termine JD, Kleinman HK, Whitson SW, Conn KM, McGarvey ML, Martin GR.

Osteonectin is a 32,000 dalton bone-specific protein that binds selectively to 
both hydroxyapatite and collagen. When osteonectin is bound to insolubilized 
type I collagen, the resultant complex binds synthetic apatite crystals and free 
calcium ions. The osteonectin-collagen complexes also nucleate mineral phase 
deposition from metastable balanced salt solutions, Antibodies to osteonectin 
cross-react with bone and, to a lesser extent, dentin, but not with other 
tissues. The protein is localized to mineralized bone trabeculae and occurs at 
higher levels in the matrix than in the cells of bone. These studies suggest 
that osteonectin is a tissue-specific protein, linking the bone mineral and 
collagen phases, perhaps initiating active mineralization in normal skeletal 
tissue.
