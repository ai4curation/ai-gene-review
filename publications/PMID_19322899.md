BACKGROUND: Interleukin-21 (IL-21) is involved in T and NK cell activation and 
effector response and promotes Th17 cell differentiation. Here we investigated 
IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) expression in inflamed mucosa of inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) and evaluated its role in the induction of NK cell cytotoxicity 
and activation as well as Th17 differentiation.
METHODS: Expression of IL-21R was performed by immunohistochemistry and flow 
cytometry. NK cell cytotoxicity was detected by a standard (51)Cr-release assay. 
Cytokine levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: IL-21R-positive cells were significantly increased in inflamed mucosa 
of IBD compared with controls, and mainly expressed in freshly isolated 
peripheral blood (PB)- and lamina propria (LP)-CD4(+), CD8(+) T, B, and NK 
cells. PB-NK cells from IBD patients produced higher levels of interferon gamma 
(IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) than controls when stimulated with 
immobilized human IgG and IL-21. IL-21-primed IBD NK cells showed a more potent 
antitumor cytotoxicity to NK-sensitive K562 cells than controls. Moreover, PB-T 
and LP-T cells from IBD patients produced large amounts of proinflammatory 
cytokines (e.g., TNF, IFN-gamma) than controls when stimulated with IL-21 and 
anti-CD3. Importantly, IL-21 facilitated IBD CD4(+) T cell to differentiate into 
Th17 cells, characterized by increased expression of IL-17A and ROR gamma t.
CONCLUSIONS: IL-21 enhances IBD NK cell cytotoxic response, triggers T cells to 
produce proinflammatory cytokines, and induces IBD CD4(+) T cells to 
differentiate into Th17 cells, suggesting that IL-21 is involved in the 
pathogenesis of IBD and that blocking IL-21R signaling may have a therapeutic 
potential in IBD.
