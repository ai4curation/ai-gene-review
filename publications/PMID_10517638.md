The stereotyped mating behaviour of the Caenorhabditis elegans male is made up 
of several substeps: response, backing, turning, vulva location, spicule 
insertion and sperm transfer. The complexity of this behaviour is reflected in 
the sexually dimorphic anatomy and nervous system. Behavioural functions have 
been assigned to most of the male-specific sensory neurons by means of cell 
ablations; for example, the hook sensory neurons HOA and HOB are specifically 
required for vulva location. We have investigated how sensory perception of the 
hermaphrodite by the C. elegans male controls mating behaviours. Here we 
identify a gene, lov-1 (for location of vulva), that is required for two male 
sensory behaviours: response and vulva location. lov-1 encodes a putative 
membrane protein with a mucin-like, serine-threonine-rich amino terminus 
followed by two blocks of homology to human polycystins, products of the 
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney-disease loci PKD1 and PKD2. LOV-1 is the 
closest C. elegans homologue of PKD1. lov-1 is expressed in adult males in 
sensory neurons of the rays, hook and head, which mediate response, vulva 
location, and potentially chemotaxis to hermaphrodites, respectively. PKD-2, the 
C. elegans homologue of PKD2, is localized to the same neurons as LOV-1, 
suggesting that they function in the same pathway.
