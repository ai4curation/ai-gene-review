TWEAK is a member of the TNF ligand family that induces angiogenesis in vivo. We 
report cloning of a receptor for TWEAK (TweakR) from a human umbilical vein 
endothelial cell (HUVEC) library. The mature form of TweakR has only one hundred 
and two amino acids and six cysteine residues in its extracellular region. Five 
different assays demonstrate TWEAK-TweakR binding, and the interaction affinity 
constant (Kd) is within a physiologically relevant range of 2.3 +/- 0.1 nM. The 
TweakR cytoplasmic domain binds TRAFs 1, 2, and 3. Cross-linking of TweakR 
induces HUVEC growth, and mRNA levels are upregulated in vitro by a variety of 
agents and in vivo following arterial injury. Soluble TweakR inhibits 
endothelial cell migration in vitro and corneal angiogenesis in vivo.
