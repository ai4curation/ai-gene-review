SKN-1/Nrf plays multiple essential roles in development and cellular 
homeostasis. We demonstrate that SKN-1 executes a specific and appropriate 
transcriptional response to changes in available nutrients, leading to metabolic 
adaptation. We isolated gain-of-function (gf) alleles of skn-1, affecting a 
domain of SKN-1 that binds the transcription factor MXL-3 and the mitochondrial 
outer membrane protein PGAM-5. These skn-1(gf) mutants perceive a state of 
starvation even in the presence of plentiful food. The aberrant monitoring of 
cellular nutritional status leads to an altered survival response in which 
skn-1(gf) mutants transcriptionally activate genes associated with metabolism, 
adaptation to starvation, aging, and survival. The triggered starvation response 
is conserved in mice with constitutively activated Nrf and may contribute to the 
tumorgenicity associated with activating Nrf mutations in mammalian somatic 
cells. Our findings delineate an evolutionarily conserved metabolic axis of 
SKN-1/Nrf, further establishing the complexity of this pathway.
