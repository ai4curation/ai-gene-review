Human Nfu is an iron-sulfur cluster protein that has recently been implicated in 
multiple mitochondrial dysfunctional syndrome (MMDS1). The Nfu family of 
proteins shares a highly homologous domain that contains a conserved active site 
consisting of a CXXC motif. There is less functional conservation between 
bacterial and human Nfu proteins, particularly concerning their Iron-sulfur 
cluster binding and transfer roles. Herein, we characterize the cluster exchange 
chemistry of human Nfu and its capacity to bind and transfer a [2Fe-2S] cluster. 
The mechanism of cluster uptake from a physiologically relevant [2Fe-2S](GS)4 
cluster complex, and extraction of the Nfu-bound iron-sulfur cluster by 
glutathione are described. Human holo Nfu shows a dimer-tetramer equilibrium 
with a protein to cluster ratio of 2:1, reflecting the Nfu-bridging [2Fe-2S] 
cluster. This cluster can be transferred to apo human ferredoxins at relatively 
fast rates, demonstrating a direct role for human Nfu in the process of [2Fe-2S] 
cluster trafficking and delivery.
