Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar and is observed by 
Muslims as a month of fasting. All Muslim adults are expected to fast; 
nevertheless certain subgroups, including sick, frail subjects, and pregnant 
women, among others, are exempted. Ramadan fasting has been shown to impact on 
body systems in different manners. The influence of Ramadan fasting on immune 
system regulation remains elusive; however, immune system changes, such as the 
modulation of body response to various infectious, stressful, and other harmful 
events, are of great interest during fasting. In this paper, we performed an 
extensive systematic literature review of different scholarly databases (ISI/Web 
of Science, Scopus, PubMed,/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Directory of Open Access 
Journals, EbscoHOST, Scirus, Science Direct, the Cochrane Library, and 
ProQuest), using the following key words: "fasting," "Ramadan," "Islam," and 
"immunity." Conclusions drawn from these findings included: (1) Ramadan fasting 
has been shown to only mildly influence the immune system and the alterations 
induced are transient, returning to basal pre-Ramadan status shortly afterward. 
(2) Ramadan fasting during the second trimester of pregnancy was shown to be 
safe and did not result in negative fetal outcomes, or maternal oxidative status 
alterations. (3) In cardiac patients, Ramadan fasting can have beneficial 
effects including lipid profile improvement and alleviation of oxidative stress. 
(4) In asthmatic patients as well as in patients with human immunodeficiency 
virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and autoimmune disorders, fasting was 
safe. (5) In psychiatric patients, such as those suffering from schizophrenia, 
fasting could increase immunologic markers. (6) Fasting Muslim athletes who 
maintain intensive training schedule during Ramadan showed fluctuations of 
immunologic markers.
