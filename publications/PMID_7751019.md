To elucidate the mechanism by which bcl-2 affects apoptosis in post-thymic T 
cells, we investigated the expression of Bcl-2 protein in primary cultures of 
splenic T cells and in the interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent T-cell line CTLL-2. 
The overall level of Bcl-2 was determined by immunoblotting, and the variability 
in Bcl-2 expression was determined by flow cytometry. For a few days after 
concanavalin A (Con A) plus IL-2 activation, the overall level of Bcl-2 in T 
cells remains unchanged, but it becomes more heterogeneous. By 5 days after 
activation, the expression returns to a more homogeneous distribution, but it is 
increased up to threefold above pre-activation levels, depending upon the dose 
of IL-2 supplied. When Con A blasts or CTLL-2 cells are deprived of IL-2 for 24 
hr, there is no change in their overall Bcl-2 levels which remain homogeneous 
even though almost half of the cells are apoptotic. However, when bcl-2 
transfected CTLL-2 cells are deprived of IL-2, they do not undergo apoptosis, 
and their endogenous Bcl-2 protein level slowly decreases relative to their 
total protein. These data document the IL-2-dependent expression of Bcl-2 in 
activated T cells, confirm the ability of deregulated bcl-2 to inhibit the onset 
of apoptosis after IL-2 withdrawal, but suggest that, after IL-2 withdrawal, a 
drop in Bcl-2 levels relative to total protein levels does not precede 
apoptosis.
