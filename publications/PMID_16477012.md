The phenotype of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) plays an important role in vascular 
function in health and disease. We investigated the mechanism of modulation of 
SMC phenotype (from contractile to synthetic) induced by the synergistic action 
of a growth factor (platelet-derived growth factor, PDGF-BB) and a cytokine 
(interleukin, IL-1beta). Human aortic SMCs grown on polymerized collagen showed 
high expression levels of contractile markers (smooth muscle alpha-actin, myosin 
heavy chain, and calponin). These levels were not significantly affected by 
PDGF-BB and IL-1beta individually, but decreased markedly after the combined 
usage of PDGF-BB and IL-1beta. PDGF/IL-1beta costimulation also induced a 
sustained phosphorylation of Akt and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K). The 
effects of PDGF/IL-1beta costimulation on contractile marker expression and Akt 
and p70S6K phosphorylation were blocked by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 and by adenovirus expressing a 
dominant-negative Akt, and they were mimicked by constitutively active Akt. 
PDGF-BB/IL-1beta induced a sustained phosphorylation of PDGF receptor 
(PDGFR)-beta and its association with IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1). Such activation 
and association of receptors were blocked by a PDGFR-beta neutralizing antibody 
(AF385), an IL-1R1 antagonist (IL-1ra), as well as a specific inhibitor of 
PDGFR-beta phosphorylation (AG1295); these agents also eliminated the 
PDGF-BB/IL-1beta-induced signaling and phenotypic modulation. PDGF-BB/IL-1beta 
inhibited the polymerized collagen-induced serum response factor DNA binding 
activity in the nucleus, and this effect was mediated by the PDGFR-beta/IL-1R1 
association and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/p70S6K pathway. Our findings 
provide insights into the mechanism of SMC phenotypic modulation from 
contractile to synthetic, e.g., in atherosclerosis.
