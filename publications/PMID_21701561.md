The cytosolic chaperonin CCT is a 1-MDa protein-folding machine essential for 
eukaryotic life. The CCT interactome shows involvement in folding and assembly 
of a small range of proteins linked to essential cellular processes such as 
cytoskeleton assembly and cell-cycle regulation. CCT has a classic chaperonin 
architecture, with two heterogeneous 8-membered rings stacked back-to-back, 
enclosing a folding cavity. However, the mechanism by which CCT assists folding 
is distinct from other chaperonins, with no hydrophobic wall lining a potential 
Anfinsen cage, and a sequential rather than concerted ATP hydrolysis mechanism. 
We have solved the crystal structure of yeast CCT in complex with actin at 3.8 Å 
resolution, revealing the subunit organisation and the location of discrete 
patches of co-evolving 'signature residues' that mediate specific interactions 
between CCT and its substrates. The intrinsic asymmetry is revealed by the 
structural individuality of the CCT subunits, which display unique 
configurations, substrate binding properties, ATP-binding heterogeneity and 
subunit-subunit interactions. The location of the evolutionarily conserved 
N-terminus of Cct5 on the outside of the barrel, confirmed by mutational 
studies, is unique to eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonins.
