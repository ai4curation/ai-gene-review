Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is unique among the Toll-like receptors in its 
ability to utilize TLR/IL1R-domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), which 
recruits TLR4-MyD88 to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2))-rich sites 
on the plasma membrane, to activate NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways. Here, we show 
that AIP1 disrupts formation of the TLR4- TIRAP-MyD88 complex without directly 
binding to any of the complex components. AIP1 via its pleckstrin homology and 
C2 domains binds to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, a lipid precursor of 
PIP(2). Knock-out of AIP1 in cells increases and overexpression of AIP1 reduces 
cellular PIP(2) levels. We further show that AIP1 is a novel GTPase-activating 
protein (GAP) for Arf6, a small GTPase regulating cellular PIP(2) production and 
formation of the TLR4-TIRAP-MyD88 complex. Thus, deletion of the GAP domain on 
AIP1 results in a loss of its ability to mediate the inhibition of Arf6- and 
TLR4-induced signaling events. We conclude that AIP1 functions as a novel 
Arf6-GAP to negatively regulate PIP(2)-dependent TLR4-TIRAP-MyD88 signaling.

Abstract

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is unique among the Toll-like receptors in its ability to utilize TLR/IL1R-domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), which recruits TLR4-MyD88 to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 )-rich sites on the plasma membrane, to activate NF-κB and MAPK pathways. Here, we show that AIP1 disrupts formation of the TLR4- TIRAP-MyD88 complex without directly binding to any of the complex components. AIP1 via its pleckstrin homology and C2 domains binds to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, a lipid precursor of PIP 2 . Knock-out of AIP1 in cells increases and overexpression of AIP1 reduces cellular PIP 2 levels. We further show that AIP1 is a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Arf6, a small GTPase regulating cellular PIP 2 production and formation of the TLR4-TIRAP-MyD88 complex. Thus, deletion of the GAP domain on AIP1 results in a loss of its ability to mediate the inhibition of Arf6- and TLR4-induced signaling events. We conclude that AIP1 functions as a novel Arf6-GAP to negatively regulate PIP 2 -dependent TLR4-TIRAP-MyD88 signaling.

Introduction

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 4 play certain critical roles in the innate immune response in mammals through the recognition of conserved molecular patterns associated with different pathogens ( 1 – 3 ). TLR4 is one of the best defined TLRs and the central signaling receptor for lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in mammals ( 3 , 4 ). TLR4 recruits the TLR/IL1R (TIR) domain-containing adaptor proteins to activate downstream signals upon ligand stimulation. These adaptors in mammals are MyD88, TIRAP (also called Mal), TRIF, TRAM, and SARM ( 5 – 14 ).

TLR4 is unique among the TLRs because it can utilize all of the TIR domain-containing adaptors and mediate activation of both the MyD88-dependent NF-κB and MAPK cascades as well as the MyD88-independent IRF-3 signaling pathway ( 1 , 12 , 14 ). It had been unclear how these two pathways were coordinated until TIRAP and TRAM were found as two sorting adaptors ( 15 , 16 ). Although the delivery of TLR4 by TRAM from the plasma membrane to endosomes initiates TLR4-mediated IRF-3 activation ( 16 ), targeting of TLR4 and MyD88 to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) sites on the plasma membrane by TIRAP launches the TLR4-mediated MyD88-dependent signaling pathway to activate NF-κB and MAPK. TIRAP has an N-terminal PIP 2 binding domain, which anchors to the plasma membrane, and a C-terminal TIR domain, which recruits MyD88 and TLR4 to the PIP 2 sites to activate downstream signaling. Mutations in the PIP 2 binding domain of TIRAP, or depletion of cellular PIP 2 , can abrogate both the recruitment of TIRAP to the plasma membrane and its capacity to induce cytokine production in response to LPS ( 15 ).

The cellular level of PIP 2 is dynamically regulated. In mammalian cells, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) 5-kinase (PIP5K) phosphorylates PI4P to generate PIP 2 ( 17 ). In response to growth factors or other stimuli, PIP 2 can be hydrolyzed by phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C to diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, or it can be further phosphorylated by PI3K to generate PIP 3 . However, regulation of PIP5K activity, a key step in controlling cellular basal PIP 2 , is critical for PIP 2 -dependent TLR4 signaling. The best characterized activator of PIP5K is Arf6 (ADP-ribosylation factor 6), a small GTPase. As the sole member of the class III ADP-ribosylation factor family, Arf6 resides on the plasma membrane and endosomes and regulates the traffic between these compartments ( 18 , 19 ). Specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors activate Arf6 by promoting its dissociation from GDP and binding of GTP, whereas the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) inactivate Arf6 by promoting GTP hydrolysis. The evidence supporting the role of Arf6 in TLR4 signaling includes the following: Arf6 is activated by β2-integrin; Arf6 is an activator of PIP5K; and most importantly, blockade of Arf6 activity blunted TLR4-MyD88-dependent signaling.

Here, we show AIP1 plays an inhibitory role in the LPS-induced NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. The results suggest that AIP1, initially identified as a member of Ras-GAP family protein in our laboratory, is a novel Arf6 GAP that can promote Arf6-GTP hydrolysis both in vitro and in vivo . Deletion of AIP1 from mouse endothelial cells can enhance cellular PIP 2 levels, in turn enhancing LPS-induced NF-κB and MAPK signaling.
