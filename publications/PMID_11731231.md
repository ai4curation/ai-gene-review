Beta-catenin has a dual role in the cell. At the membrane, it connects 
E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton, while in the nucleus, it controls gene 
expression in concert with Tcf-like transcription factors. Nuclear translocation 
of beta-catenin is induced by the Wnt signal transduction pathway. Control of 
this process is essential since elevated beta-catenin levels interfere with 
differentiation and development, and can initiate cancer in many tissues. An 
important role for beta-catenin during hair follicle related development and 
tumorigenesis has recently been established, though little is known of its 
endogenous expression during the development of these structures. Here, we have 
investigated the expression of beta-catenin in relation to markers for 
proliferation, differentiation and Wnt signaling during the development of three 
hair follicle related structures, i.e. whiskers, normal body hair and the 
preputial gland, and a hair follicle-derived tumor, the epidermal cyst. We 
observed nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, the hallmark of Wnt signaling, in 
the upper matrix, the dermal papilla, the developing ringwulst of the whisker 
and in the tumor, though it was never in association with proliferation or 
terminal differentiation. Co-localization of nuclear beta-catenin with Tcf-3/4 
was found only in the dermal papilla and the developing ringwulst of the 
whisker, but not in the upper matrix or in the tumor. These results further 
elucidate the role of the Wnt signal transduction pathway during hair follicle 
related development and tumorigenesis and illustrate the dynamic role of 
beta-catenin in signal transduction and cell-adhesion.
