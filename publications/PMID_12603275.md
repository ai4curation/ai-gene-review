Dopaminergic systems are thought to mediate the rewarding and reinforcing 
effects of palatable food. However, the relative contribution of different 
dopamine receptor subtypes is not clear. We used dopamine D1 receptor deficient 
mice (D1 -/-) and their wild-type and heterozygous littermates to study the role 
of the D1 receptor in palatable food reinforced behaviour using operant 
responding and free access paradigms. Non-deprived mice were trained to press a 
lever for sucrose pellets under three schedules of reinforcement including fixed 
ratios (FR-1 and FR-4) and a progressive ratio (PR). Responding on one lever was 
reinforced by the delivery of a sucrose pellet or solution while responding on a 
second lever had no programmed consequences. Initially, D1 mutant mice took 
longer to learn to discriminate between the two levers and had significantly 
lower operant responding for sucrose pellets and solution than wild-type and 
heterozygous mice under all schedules of reinforcement. Food deprivation 
enhanced responding on the active lever in all mice although it remained 
significantly lower in D1 -/- mice than in control mice. Following extinction of 
sucrose reinforcement and reversal of the levers, D1 -/- mice showed deficits in 
extinguishing and reversing previously learned responses. Home cage intake and 
preference of sucrose pellets and solutions when given under free-choice access 
paradigms were similar among the groups. These results suggest that the dopamine 
D1 receptor plays a role in the motivation to work for reward (palatable food) 
but not in reward perception and is critical in learning new but relevant 
information and discontinuing previously learned responses.
