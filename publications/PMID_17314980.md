Defining the functional relationships between proteins is critical for 
understanding virtually all aspects of cell biology. Large-scale identification 
of protein complexes has provided one important step towards this goal; however, 
even knowledge of the stoichiometry, affinity and lifetime of every 
protein-protein interaction would not reveal the functional relationships 
between and within such complexes. Genetic interactions can provide functional 
information that is largely invisible to protein-protein interaction data sets. 
Here we present an epistatic miniarray profile (E-MAP) consisting of 
quantitative pairwise measurements of the genetic interactions between 743 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes involved in various aspects of chromosome biology 
(including DNA replication/repair, chromatid segregation and transcriptional 
regulation). This E-MAP reveals that physical interactions fall into two 
well-represented classes distinguished by whether or not the individual proteins 
act coherently to carry out a common function. Thus, genetic interaction data 
make it possible to dissect functionally multi-protein complexes, including 
Mediator, and to organize distinct protein complexes into pathways. In one 
pathway defined here, we show that Rtt109 is the founding member of a novel 
class of histone acetyltransferases responsible for Asf1-dependent acetylation 
of histone H3 on lysine 56. This modification, in turn, enables a ubiquitin 
ligase complex containing the cullin Rtt101 to ensure genomic integrity during 
DNA replication.
