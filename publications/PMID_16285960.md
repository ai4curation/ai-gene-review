BACKGROUND & AIMS: The signal transducers and activators of transcription 
(STATs) are cytoplasmic transcription factors mediating acute-phase response 
(APR) of the human angiotensinogen (hAGT) gene in hepatocytes. The mechanisms of 
how STAT3 activates target genes are unknown. Here we analyzed the biochemistry 
of STAT3 activation by interleukin (IL)-6 in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 and 
Balb/C mice.
METHODS: Immunoprecipitation-Western assays and Matrix Assisted Laser 
Desorption-Time of Flight mass spectrometry determined sites of STAT3 
acetylation by the 300-kilodalton target of E1A (p300) co-activator. The 
subcellular localization of acetylation-deficient STAT3 molecules were studied 
by microscopic imaging, effects on DNA binding measured by gel shift and 
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and gene transactivation by 
Northern blot and reporter assays.
RESULTS: Two Lys residues at amino acids 49 and 87 in the STAT3 NH2 terminus are 
acetylated by p300. Lys-to-Arg point mutations (STAT3 K49R/K87R) had no effect 
on inducible DNA binding, but blocked p300-mediated acetyl(Ac)-STAT3 formation 
and abrogated IL-6-induced hAGT activation. Although STAT3 K49R/K87R rapidly 
translocated into the nucleus, it did not bind p300 and had delayed cytoplasmic 
redistribution. ChIP assays show IL-6-inducible acetylated STAT3 and p300 
binding to the native hAGT promoter. Activation of the APR in mice induces 
nuclear Tyr phosphorylated and acetylated STAT3 in hepatic nuclei. We also 
observed that STAT3 interacts with histone deacetylases (HDACs), specifically 
HDAC 1, that down-regulate IL-6-induced hAGT transactivation.
CONCLUSIONS: IL-6-induced target gene activation requires p300-mediated STAT3 
acetylation, and HDACs are involved in the termination of STAT3 action. These 
studies indicate the acetylation-deacetylation reaction as a novel signaling 
mechanism controlling the IL-6-STAT3 pathway in the hepatic APR.
