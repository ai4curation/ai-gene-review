The multisubunit Mediator, comprising ∼30 distinct proteins, plays an essential 
role in gene expression regulation by acting as a bridge between DNA-binding 
transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription 
machinery. Efforts to uncover the Mediator mechanism have been hindered by a 
poor understanding of its structure, subunit organization, and conformational 
rearrangements. By overcoming biochemical and image analysis hurdles, we 
obtained accurate EM structures of yeast and human Mediators. Subunit 
localization experiments, docking of partial X-ray structures, and biochemical 
analyses resulted in comprehensive mapping of yeast Mediator subunits and a 
complete reinterpretation of our previous Mediator organization model. 
Large-scale Mediator rearrangements depend on changes at the interfaces between 
previously described Mediator modules, which appear to be facilitated by factors 
conducive to transcription initiation. Conservation across eukaryotes of 
Mediator structure, subunit organization, and RNA polymerase II interaction 
suggest conservation of fundamental aspects of the Mediator mechanism.
