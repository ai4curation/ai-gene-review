Monoclonal antibodies raised against DNA topoisomerase I and against 
topoisomerase II alpha and beta isoforms, which have been previously 
demonstrated to be highly specific and capable of detecting cell cycle-related 
variations of the topoisomerase II isoforms (Negri et al., 1992, Exp. Cell Res. 
200, 452-459), have been utilized for a fine subcellular localization. 
Immunocytochemistry by confocal and electron microscopy have been used for a 
topological and quantitative evaluation of the fine distribution of the 
different topoisomerases in HeLa and K562 cells. Topoisomerase I and 
topoisomerase II alpha are present both in the nucleoplasm and in the nucleolus, 
though at different relative ratios, while topoisomerase II beta is exclusively 
present at the nucleolar level. This is further confirmed by immunoblotting and 
immunocytochemical quantitative evaluations performed on purified nuclear matrix 
fractions obtained from K562 cells. In fact, the amount of topoisomerase I and 
topoisomerase II alpha present in the whole cell nuclei is partly lost in 
isolated nuclei but, while topoisomerase I is further significantly reduced in 
nuclear matrix preparations, the topoisomerase II alpha content is only slightly 
decreased. On the other hand, the great majority of topoisomerase II beta is 
retained in the nuclear matrix and can be detected exclusively in association 
with the nucleolar remnant. These results are consistent with specific 
functional roles hypothesized for the different topoisomerase types.
