A strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, defective in small subunit ribosomal RNA 
processing, has a mutation in YOR145c ORF that converts Gly235 to Asp. Yor145c 
is a nucleolar protein required for cell viability and has been reported 
recently to be present in 90S pre-ribosomal particles. The Gly235Asp mutation in 
YOR145c is found in a KH-type RNA-binding domain and causes a marked deficiency 
in 18S rRNA production. Detailed studies by northern blotting and primer 
extension analyses show that the mutant strain impairs the early pre-rRNA 
processing cleavage essentially at sites A1 and A2, leading to accumulation of a 
22S dead-end processing product that is found in only a few rRNA processing 
mutants. Furthermore, U3, U14, snR10 and snR30 snoRNAs, involved in early 
pre-rRNA cleavages, are not destabilized by the YOR145c mutation. As the protein 
encoded by YOR145c is found in pre-ribosomal particles and the mutant strain is 
defective in ribosomal RNA processing, we have renamed it as RRP20.
