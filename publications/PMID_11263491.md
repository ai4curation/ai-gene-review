The recent discovery of a new family of ubiquitous DNA polymerases involved in 
translesion synthesis has shed new light onto the biochemical basis of 
mutagenesis. Among these polymerases, the dinB gene product (Pol IV) is involved 
in mutagenesis in Escherichia coli. We show here that the activity of native Pol 
IV is drastically modified upon interaction with the beta subunit, the 
processivity factor of DNA Pol III. In the absence of the beta subunit Pol IV is 
strictly distributive and no stable complex between Pol IV and DNA could be 
detected. In contrast, the beta clamp allows Pol IV to form a stable initiation 
complex (t 1/2 approximately 2.3 min), which leads to a dramatic increase in the 
processivity of PoI IV reaching an average of 300-400 nucleotides. In vivo, the 
beta processivity subunit may target DNA Pol IV to its substrate, generating 
synthesis tracks much longer than previously thought.
