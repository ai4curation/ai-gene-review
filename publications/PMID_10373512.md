Germ line mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 predispose to 
early-onset breast cancer, but the function of the nuclear protein encoded by 
the gene is ill defined. Using the yeast two-hybrid system with fragments of 
human BRCA2, we identified an interaction with the human DSS1 (deleted in split 
hand/split foot) gene. Yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays showed that DSS1 
can associate with BRCA2 in the region of amino acids 2472 to 2957 in the C 
terminus of the protein. Using coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged BRCA2 and 
DSS1 cDNA constructs transiently expressed in COS cells, we were able to 
demonstrate an association. Furthermore, endogenous BRCA2 could be 
coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous DSS1 in MCF7 cells, demonstrating an in 
vivo association. Apparent orthologues of the mammalian DSS1 gene were 
identified in the genome of the yeasts Schizosaccharomyces pombe and 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast strains in which these DSS1-like genes were 
deleted showed a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype, which was analyzed by 
flow cytometry. This provides evidence for a link between the BRCA2 tumor 
suppressor gene and a gene required for completion of the cell cycle.
