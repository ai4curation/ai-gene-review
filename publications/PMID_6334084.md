Beta-lactamase activity of purified and partially characterized human renal 
dipeptidase.

Human renal dipeptidase has been concentrated from kidneys by homogenization, 
1-butanol solubilization, and (NH4)2SO4 fractionation. Final purification was 
achieved by high-pressure liquid chromatography followed by affinity 
chromatography. The enzyme appeared to be homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis, and its molecular weight was estimated to be 220,000 by 
analytical high-pressure liquid chromatography. The molecular weight of human 
urinary dipeptidase was estimated by agarose gel filtration to be 218,000. 
Dissociation of human renal dipeptidase in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis produced a single polypeptide (Mr 59,000). These results 
suggest that the native enzyme contains four subunits of Mr 59,000. Analysis of 
the peptidase for zinc content gave 3.9 g atoms of zinc/mol of enzyme which 
supports the suggestion of a 4-subunit structure. Carbohydrate analyses of the 
purified human dipeptidase demonstrated that it was not a glycoprotein, a 
characteristic that distinguishes it from porcine and rat renal dipeptidase. 
beta-Lactamase activity of the purified human enzyme was demonstrated by 
measuring its activity against the two beta-lactam antibiotics, imipenem and SCH 
29482. Kinetic analyses indicated that both antibiotics undergo enzyme-catalyzed 
hydrolysis at rates which could produce inactivation of the antibiotics within 
the human kidney. The beta-lactamase inhibitor, cilastatin, demonstrated 
reversible competitive inhibition of the peptidase-catalyzed hydrolysis of both 
antibiotics with the same Ki of 0.7 microM.
