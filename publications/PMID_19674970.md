Endothelial phenotypes are highly regulated in space and time by both 
transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. There is increasing 
evidence that the GATA family of transcription factors function as signal 
transducers, coupling changes in the extracellular environment to changes in 
downstream target gene expression. Here we show that human primary endothelial 
cells derived from large blood vessels express GATA2, -3, and -6. Of these 
factors, GATA3 was expressed at the highest levels. In DNA microarrays of human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), small interfering RNA-mediated 
knockdown of GATA3 resulted in reduced expression of genes associated with 
angiogenesis, including Tie2. At a functional level, GATA3 knockdown inhibited 
angiopoietin (Ang)-1-mediated but not vascular endothelial cell growth factor 
(VEGF)-mediated AKT signaling, cell migration, survival, and tube formation. In 
electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation, 
GATA3 was shown to bind to regulatory regions within the 5'-untranslated region 
of the Tie2 gene. In co-immunoprecipitation and co-transfection assays, GATA3 
and the Ets transcription factor, ELF1, physically interacted and synergized to 
transactivate the Tie2 promoter. GATA3 knockdown blocked the ability of Ang-1 to 
attenuate vascular endothelial cell growth factor stimulation of vascular cell 
adhesion molecule-1 expression and monocytic cell adhesion. Moreover, exposure 
of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
resulted in marked down-regulation of GATA3 expression and reduction in Tie2 
expression. Together, these findings suggest that GATA3 is indispensable for 
Ang-1-Tie2-mediated signaling in large vessel endothelial cells.

Abstract

Endothelial phenotypes are highly regulated in space and time by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. There is increasing evidence that the GATA family of transcription factors function as signal transducers, coupling changes in the extracellular environment to changes in downstream target gene expression. Here we show that human primary endothelial cells derived from large blood vessels express GATA2, -3, and -6. Of these factors, GATA3 was expressed at the highest levels. In DNA microarrays of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of GATA3 resulted in reduced expression of genes associated with angiogenesis, including Tie2. At a functional level, GATA3 knockdown inhibited angiopoietin (Ang)-1-mediated but not vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF)-mediated AKT signaling, cell migration, survival, and tube formation. In electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation, GATA3 was shown to bind to regulatory regions within the 5′-untranslated region of the Tie2 gene. In co-immunoprecipitation and co-transfection assays, GATA3 and the Ets transcription factor, ELF1, physically interacted and synergized to transactivate the Tie2 promoter. GATA3 knockdown blocked the ability of Ang-1 to attenuate vascular endothelial cell growth factor stimulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression and monocytic cell adhesion. Moreover, exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to tumor necrosis factor-α resulted in marked down-regulation of GATA3 expression and reduction in Tie2 expression. Together, these findings suggest that GATA3 is indispensable for Ang-1-Tie2-mediated signaling in large vessel endothelial cells.

DISCUSSION

GATA factors have been shown to play an important role in lineage determination. Indeed, gene disruption studies have shown that all GATA proteins with the exception of GATA5 are required for development (reviewed in Refs. 1 , 2 , 40 ). GATA2 is essential for hematopoiesis, GATA3 for central nervous development and fetal liver hematopoiesis, GATA4 for ventral body plan and formation of linear heart tube, and GATA6 for differentiation of visceral mesoderm and morphogenetic patterning of cardiac outflow tract and large arteries ( 1 , 2 , 40 ).

Previous studies have demonstrated that HUVEC express GATA2, GATA3, and GATA6 ( 41 ). In addition, GATA2 and GATA3 were identified in human coronary artery endothelial cells ( 42 ). Interestingly, GATA3 was reported to be expressed at higher levels in retinal endothelial cells compared with brain capillary endothelial cells ( 43 ). Our data indicate that GATA3 is preferentially expressed in endothelial cells derived from large vessels.

GATA2 has been implicated in the regulation of several genes in endothelial cells ( 9 – 14 ). However, with the possible exception of von Willebrand factor ( 44 ) and VCAM-1 ( 41 ), there is no information about GATA3 or GATA6 target genes in endothelial cells. This study is the first to comprehensively survey endothelial cells for GATA3-responsive transcripts. GATA3 knockdown resulted not only in the down-regulation of many genes but also in the induction of certain transcripts, suggesting that this transcription factor may act both as a positive and negative transacting factor in endothelial cells. In preliminary experiments using HUVEC, we have shown that the expression of some genes is affected by siRNA-mediated knockdown of any of the three GATA factors, whereas the expression of other genes is influenced only by combined knockdown of GATA factors (data not shown). These findings suggest that several GATA target genes were overlapped, but other targets were distinctly regulated by each GATA factor.

Tie2 expression is restricted to endothelial cells. Thus, an understanding of its transcriptional control mechanisms may provide important insights into lineage determination. We have shown that GATA3 binds to and activates the Tie2 promoter, induces expression of Tie2 protein and mRNA, and thus regulates Ang-1-Tie2 signaling. Our data point to a physical interaction and functional synergism between GATA3 and the Ets factor ELF. Both GATA3 and ELF are expressed in multiple cell types. In fact, no transcription factor is unique to the endothelium. A prevailing view is that EC-specific gene expression is mediated by combinations of otherwise nonspecific transacting proteins. For example, De Val et al. ( 45 ) recently demonstrated a role for FoxC2 and the Ets factor, ETV2, in mediating cell type-specific expression in the endothelium. However, compared with ELF1, ETV2 is expressed at very low levels in HUVEC and HDMVEC ( supplemental Fig. VII ). Future studies will be required to determine whether GATA3-ELF1 plays a role in mediating lineage specificity of Tie2 in vivo .

Tie2 expression was observed in all endothelial cell types (see Fig. 1 A ). Compared with large vessel endothelial cells, dermal microvascular endothelial cells express low levels of GATA3 and high levels of GATA2. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that GATA2 rather than GATA3 may play a primary role in mediating Tie2 expression in microvascular endothelial cells. Indeed, GATA2 knockdown in HDMVEC and human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells resulted in >90% reduction in Tie2 mRNA levels ( supplemental Fig. VIII shows HDMVEC). Moreover, GATA2 knockdown in HDMVEC inhibited Ang-1-mediated phosphorylation of AKT, cell migration, and tube formation ( supplemental Fig. VIII ). Together, these data raise the interesting possibility that Tie2 expression is regulated by different GATA factors in distinct blood vessel types. Definitive evidence for such a model will require generation and analysis of mice with conditional endothelial cell-specific knock-out of GATA2 and/or GATA3.

The GATA family of transcription factors has been implicated not only in the early differentiation of the endothelium ( 2 ) but also in the transduction of extracellular signals. For instance, insulin-like growth factor-1, low density lipoprotein, VEGF, TNF-α, and thrombin have each been shown to induce GATA2 activity at a post-transcriptional level without significantly changing GATA2 mRNA levels ( 14 , 46 , 47 ), whereas estrogen and transforming growth factor-β inhibit GATA2 binding ( 48 , 49 ). In contrast to GATA2, we have shown that inflammatory agonists such as TNF-α and thrombin down-regulate GATA3 expression at an mRNA level. Together, these studies suggest that GATA transcription factors may behave like immediate early genes, serving to couple short changes in the extracellular environment to long term changes in downstream gene expression.

The Ang-Tie2 signaling axis plays a critical role in maintaining vascular integrity. Based on our results, it is interesting to speculate that in certain pathological states ( e.g. sepsis, atherosclerosis or cancer), inflammatory mediators may result in GATA3-dependent inhibition of Ang-1-Tie2 signaling, thus contributing to endothelial cell dysfunction. It follows that therapies designed to maintain GATA3 activity might help to blunt the deleterious effects of inflammation on the endothelium.
