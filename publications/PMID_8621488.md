Through the specific binding of a negative calcium-responsive element to its 
binding protein in response to extracellular Ca (Ca2+e), negative 
calcium-responsive element-bearing genes, such as the human parathyroid hormone 
gene, are negatively regulated by Ca2+e. The Ku antigen mediated negative gene 
regulation by Ca2+e by interacting with a redox factor protein, REF1. Although 
sequence-nonspecific DNA binding activity of the Ku antigen has been well 
characterized, the mechanism of its sequence-specific DNA binding remained 
obscure. Here, we report that the specific binding of the Ku antigen to another 
protein, REF1, leads to DNA-protein complex formation with a novel sequence 
specificity and thereby regulates gene expression.
