The upstream Ggamma-globin gene cAMP response element (G-CRE) was previously 
shown to play a role in drug-mediated fetal hemoglobin induction. This effect is 
achieved via p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent CREB1 and 
ATF-2 phosphorylation and G-CRE transactivation. Since this motif is also a 
predicted consensus binding site for cJun we extended our analysis to determine 
the ability of cJun to transactivate gamma-globin through the G-CRE. Using 
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays we showed comparable in vivo cJun and CREB1 
binding to the G-CRE region. Protein-protein interactions were confirmed between 
cJun/ATF-2 and CREB1/ATF-2 but not between CREB1 and cJun. However, we observed 
cJun and CREB1 binding to the G-CRE in vitro by electrophoretic mobility shift 
assay. Promoter pull-down assay followed by sequential western blot analysis 
confirmed co-localization of cJun, CREB1, and ATF-2 on the G-CRE. To show 
functional relevance, enforced expression studies with pLen-cJun and a 
Ggamma-promoter (-1500 to +36) luciferase reporter were completed; we observed a 
concentration-dependent increase in luciferase activity with pLen-cJun similar 
to that produced by CREB1 enforced expression. Moreover, the G/A mutation at 
-1225 in the G-CRE abolished cJun transactivation. Finally, enforced cJun 
expression in K562 cells and normal primary erythroid progenitors enhanced 
endogenous gamma-globin gene expression. We conclude that these data indicate 
that cJun activates the Ggamma-globin promoter via the G-CRE in a manner 
comparable with CREB1 and propose a model for gamma-globin activation based on 
DNA-protein interactions in the G-CRE.
