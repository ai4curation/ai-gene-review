In Drosophila, light affects circadian behavioral rhythms via at least two 
distinct mechanisms. One of them relies on the visual phototransduction cascade. 
The other involves a presumptive photopigment, cryptochrome (cry), expressed in 
lateral brain neurons that control behavioral rhythms. We show here that cry is 
expressed in most, if not all, larval and adult neuronal groups expressing the 
PERIOD (PER) protein, with the notable exception of larval dorsal neurons (DN2s) 
in which PER cycles in antiphase to all other known cells. Forcing cry 
expression in the larval DN2s gave them a normal phase of PER cycling, 
indicating that their unique antiphase rhythm is related to their lack of cry 
expression. We were able to directly monitor CRY protein in Drosophila brains in 
situ. It appeared highly unstable in the light, whereas in the dark, it 
accumulated in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, including some neuritic 
projections. We also show that dorsal PER-expressing brain neurons, the adult 
DN1s, are the only brain neurons to coexpress the CRY protein and the 
photoreceptor differentiation factor GLASS. Studies of various visual system 
mutants and their combination with the cry(b) mutation indicated that the adult 
DN1s contribute significantly to the light sensitivity of the clock controlling 
activity rhythms, and that this contribution depends on CRY. Moreover, all 
CRY-independent light inputs into this central behavioral clock were found to 
require the visual system. Finally, we show that the photoreceptive DN1 neurons 
do not behave as autonomous oscillators, because their PER oscillations in 
constant darkness rapidly damp out in the absence of pigment-dispersing-factor 
signaling from the ventral lateral neurons.
