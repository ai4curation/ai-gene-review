Rosiglitazone, one of the thiazolidinedione (TZD), is an oral antidiabetic drug 
that activates a gamma isoform of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
(PPARγ). To identify target proteins induced by rosiglitazone in adipocytes, we 
first performed simultaneous in-depth proteomic profiling of cytosolic proteins 
and secreted proteins (secretome) from 3T3-L1 adipocytes using a label-free 
quantification method with nano-UPLC MS/MS. In total, we identified 646 proteins 
from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, of which 172 and 162 proteins were upregulated and 
downregulated >1.5-fold, respectively, in rosiglitazone-treated cells, as 
compared to controls. Some differentially expressed proteins in particular, 
including fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, fatty acid binding protein, 
lipoprotein lipase, acetyl CoA acyltransferase, carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 
2, sterol carrier protein, adiponectin, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 
could explain the current action mechanism of TZDs. Furthermore, this study is 
the first to report on two potential target proteins of rosiglitazone, such as 
adenomatosis polyposis coli 2 (APC2), and eukaryotic translation initiation 
factor 5A-1 (eIF5A) related to apoptosis and cell division. Our data clearly 
suggest that in-depth proteomic approaches using cytosolic and secreted proteins 
are important and necessary for identification of drug targets at the protein 
level.
