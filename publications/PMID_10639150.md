Proteins internalized into the endocytic pathway are usually degraded. Efficient 
proteolysis requires denaturation, induced by acidic conditions within 
lysosomes, and reduction of inter- and intrachain disulfide bonds. Cytosolic 
reduction is mediated enzymatically by thioredoxin, but the mechanism of 
lysosomal reduction is unknown. We describe here a lysosomal thiol reductase 
optimally active at low pH and capable of catalyzing disulfide bond reduction 
both in vivo and in vitro. The active site, determined by mutagenesis, consists 
of a pair of cysteine residues separated by two amino acids, similar to other 
enzymes of the thioredoxin family. The enzyme is a soluble glycoprotein that is 
synthesized as a precursor. After delivery into the endosomal/lysosomal system 
by the mannose 6-phosphate receptor, N- and C-terminal prosequences are removed. 
The enzyme is expressed constitutively in antigen-presenting cells and induced 
by IFN-gamma in other cell types, suggesting a potentially important role in 
antigen processing.
