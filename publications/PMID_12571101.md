We designed an automatic system to measure body length, diameters and volume of 
a C. elegans worm. By using this system, mutants with an increased body volume 
exceeding 50% were isolated. Four of them are grossly normal in morphology and 
development, grow longer to be almost twice as big, and have weak egg-laying 
defects and extended lifespan. All the four mutants have a mutation in the egl-4 
gene. We show that the egl-4 gene encodes cGMP-dependent protein kinases. egl-4 
promoter::gfp fusion genes are mainly expressed in head neurons, hypodermis, 
intestine and body wall muscles. Procedures to analyze morphology and volume of 
major organs were developed. The results indicate that volumes of intestine, 
hypodermis and muscle and cell volumes in intestine and muscle are increased in 
the egl-4 mutants, whereas cell numbers are not. Experiments on genetic 
interaction suggest that the cGMP-EGL-4 signaling pathway represses body size 
and lifespan through DBL-1/TGF-beta and insulin pathways, respectively.
