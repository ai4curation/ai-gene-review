Schizosaccharomyces pombe divides by medial fission through the use of an 
actomyosin-based contractile ring. A division septum is formed centripetally, 
concomitant with ring constriction. Although several genes essential for 
cytokinesis have been described previously, enzymes that participate in the 
assembly of the division septum have not been identified. Here we describe a 
temperature-sensitive mutation, drc1-191, that prevents division septum assembly 
and causes mutant cells to arrest with a stable actomyosin ring. Unlike the 
previously characterized cytokinesis mutants, which undergo multiple mitotic 
cycles, drc1-191 is the first cytokinesis mutant that arrests with two 
interphase nuclei. Interestingly, unlike drc1-191, drc1-null mutants proceed 
through multiple mitotic cycles, leading to the formation of large cells with 
many nuclei. drc1 is allelic to cps1, which encodes a 1,3-beta-glucan synthase 
subunit. We conclude that Drc1p/Cps1p is not required for cell elongation and 
cell growth, but plays an essential role in assembly of the division septum. 
Furthermore, it appears that constriction of the actomyosin ring might depend on 
assembly of the division septum. We discuss possible mechanisms that account for 
the differences in the phenotypes of the drc1-191 and the drc1-null mutants and 
also reflect the potential links between Drc1p and other cytokinesis regulators.
