alpha-Crystallin, the major protein of the ocular lens, acts as a molecular 
chaperone by preventing the thermal aggregation of proteins. However, in 
contrast with many other heat shock proteins, alpha-crystallin fails to protect 
proteins from aggregation during refolding reactions. Our results indicate that 
alpha-crystallin has substrate specificity different from other chaperones and 
recognizes specific non-native intermediates formed on the denaturation pathway 
only, with no affinity for intermediates formed on the refolding pathway.
