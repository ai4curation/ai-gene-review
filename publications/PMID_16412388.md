Tom1 (target of Myb 1) and its related proteins (Tom1L1/Srcasm and Tom1L2) 
constitute a protein family and share an N-terminal VHS (Vps27p/Hrs/Stam) domain 
and a following GAT (GGA and Tom1) domain, both of which are also conserved in 
the GGA family proteins. However, the C-terminal half is not significantly 
conserved between the Tom1 and GGA families or even between Tom1 and Tom1L1. We 
have previously shown that the GAT domain of Tom1 interacts with Tollip 
(Toll-interacting protein), which is associated with endosomes, to which it 
recruits Tom1. We here extend the previous data and show that the GAT domains of 
Tom1L1 and Tom1L2 also interact with Tollip, and the C-terminal regions of all 
the Tom1 family proteins interact with clathrin. Furthermore, when coexpressed 
with Tollip, all the Tom1 family proteins recruite clathrin onto endosomes. 
These results indicate that, in conjunction with Tollip, Tom1 family proteins 
play an important role in recruiting clathrin onto endosomes and suggest that 
they modulate endosomal functions.
