Microtubule inhibitors are important cancer drugs that induce mitotic arrest by 
activating the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which, in turn, inhibits the 
ubiquitin ligase activity of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). Here, we 
report a small molecule, tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME), which binds to 
the APC and prevents its activation by Cdc20 and Cdh1. A prodrug of TAME arrests 
cells in metaphase without perturbing the spindle, but nonetheless the arrest is 
dependent on the SAC. Metaphase arrest induced by a proteasome inhibitor is also 
SAC dependent, suggesting that APC-dependent proteolysis is required to 
inactivate the SAC. We propose that mutual antagonism between the APC and the 
SAC yields a positive feedback loop that amplifies the ability of TAME to induce 
mitotic arrest.
