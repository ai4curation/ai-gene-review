Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe neurological disorder, characterized by the 
progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway and the 
presence of Lewy bodies (LBs). The discovery of genes responsible for familial 
forms of the disease has provided insights into its pathogenesis. Mutations in 
the parkin gene, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase involved in the 
ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of specific protein substrates, have 
been found in nearly 50% of patients with autosomal-recessive early-onset 
parkinsonism. The abnormal accumulation of substrates due to loss of Parkin 
function may be the cause of neurodegeneration in parkin-related parkinsonism. 
Here, we demonstrate that Parkin interacts with, ubiquitylates and promotes the 
degradation of p38, a key structural component of the mammalian aminoacyl-tRNA 
synthetase complex. We found that the ubiquitylation of p38 is abrogated by 
truncated variants of Parkin lacking essential functional domains, but not by 
the pathogenic Lys161Asn point mutant. Expression of p38 in COS7 cells resulted 
in the formation of aggresome-like inclusions in which Parkin was systematically 
sequestered. In the human dopaminergic neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cell line, 
Parkin promoted the formation of ubiquitylated p38-positive inclusions. 
Moreover, the overexpression of p38 in SH-SY5Y cells caused significant cell 
death against which Parkin provided protection. Analysis of p38 expression in 
the human adult midbrain revealed strong immunoreactivity in normal dopaminergic 
neurons and the labeling of LBs in idiopathic PD. This suggests that p38 plays a 
role in the pathogenesis of PD, opening the way for a detailed examination of 
its potential non-canonical role in neurodegeneration.
