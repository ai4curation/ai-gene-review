We previously reported a new Toll/IL-1R (TIR)-containing molecule, named TIR 
domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta (TRIF). Although initial study 
indicated that TRIF possesses the ability to activate not only the 
NF-kappaB-dependent but also the IFN-beta promoters, the molecular mechanisms of 
TRIF-induced signaling are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the 
signaling cascades through TRIF. TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)6 
interacted with TRIF through the TRAF domain of TRAF6 and TRAF6-binding motifs 
found in the N-terminal portion of TRIF. Disruption of TRAF6-binding motifs of 
TRIF disabled it from associating with TRAF6, and resulted in a reduction in the 
TRIF-induced activation of the NF-kappaB-dependent but not IFN-beta promoter. 
TANK-binding kinase (TBK)-1, which was recently reported to be a kinase of IFN 
regulatory factor-3, which is an essential transcription factor for IFN-beta 
expression, also associated with the N-terminal region of TRIF. Moreover, the 
association between TRIF and TBK1 appeared to require the kinase activity of 
TBK1, as well as phosphorylation of TRIF. Because TRAF6 and TBK1 bind close the 
region of TRIF, it seems that TRAF6 physically prevents the association between 
TRIF and TBK1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that TRIF associates 
with TRAF6 and TBK1 independently, and activates two distinct transcription 
factors, NF-kappaB and IFN regulatory factor-3, respectively.

The bioavailability of a mineral is mostly regulated by its source and the presence of other interacting micronutrients in the gut. Recently, different varieties of nano-minerals have been synthesized, which appear to be highly bioavailable and hence have the least interaction with other nutrients available in the gut.

However, it cannot be stored in the body, which emphasizes the need for regular dietary intake to avoid any subclinical deficiencies (5, 6). Zinc plays a vital role in prostaglandin metabolism and provides structural rigidity to nucleoproteins (7). It serves as an essential part of approximately 20 metalloenzymes, including alkaline phosphatase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and carbonic anhydrase, among others. In addition, zinc plays a critical role in growth performance, fertility, immune function, wound healing, oxidative stress maintenance, etc. (5, 8, 9). Zinc oxide and nano-zinc oxide have the same chemical structures, which suggests similar zinc and oxygen ratios. However, nano-sized atoms have a wider energy level confinement and, due to size variations, become less interactive with other bulk-sized molecules available in the gut (10). The higher bioavailability of nanostructures ensures adequacy at the tissue level; hence, nano-zinc appears to be more potent for immunomodulation in fish. It can increase the immunoglobulin M level and upregulate the expression of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β (11). This higher immunomodulation may be associated with the increased thymocytes and peripheral T cells, enhancing the production of interferon and interleukin 2. Supplemental dietary zinc can improve the immune biomarkers that lead to a better immune response (12). Zinc oxide nanostructures appear potent immunomodulators even at lower doses compared with their bulk counterparts and organic zinc sources (11). Nano-zinc oxide can also promote the immune response by increasing the extra thymulin activity, which helps in the enhancement of mature T lymphocytes and the activation of B lymphocytes by T helper cells (12, 13). It has often been associated with increased lymphocyte count and phagocytic activity (11).Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are transcription factors of the interferon (IFN) inducible signaling pathway and are crucial for host immunity against antimicrobial infection by both viruses and bacteria (14). IRFs are transcriptional regulators in the antiviral signaling pathway of the cell. When microbes attack the cell, IRFs bind to the IFN regulatory element (IRF-E) within the promoter region and regularize the transcriptional levels of the target genes. Thus, they play a pivotal role in the response to antiviral infections. There are different IRFs that play critical roles in innate immunity. IRF1, IRF3, IRF5, IRF7, IRF8, and IRF9 are among the positive regulators of IFN and other immune-related genes (15). IRF3 was found as a regulator of virus-infected cells 20 years ago (16). It promotes IFN-α/β gene transcription in virus-infected cells (17) and plays a very important role in controlling the IFN response during viral infection in mammals (18). IRF3 can also mediate apoptosis-independent p53 and type l IFN (19). There are nine members of IRF3 present in mammals (20), 10 members present in birds (21), and 11 members found in fish (18, 22). Studies on the innate immunity of fish are of recent interest considering the repeated outbreaks of pathogens in recent times. Several studies have reported that fish, similar to mammals, possess a defense mechanism in their innate immune system (14). Fish utilize the IFN-induced system against viral infections (14, 23). The induction of fish IFN through viral infection promotes antiviral activity and increases the interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression that reduces viral replication (14, 24). Several representative IRFs have been identified in fish, among which Irf3 appears to play the key role in regulating the IFN response (14).

The present experiment aimed to compare the effect of formulated diets fortified with different sources of zinc (organic and nano-zinc) to evaluate its role in IRF3 gene expression, which is essential for the antiviral defense of milkfish.

Materials and methodsThe present study aimed to determine the antiviral activity of nano-zinc in a milkfish (C. chanos) model. We synthesized the zinc nano-structures by employing an environment-benign colloidal chemistry route and characterized what has already been reported (27). They are suitable for mineral supplementation. IRF3 was employed as the molecular marker for assessment. We characterized the IRF3 gene in C. chanos for the first time and assessed the differential messenger RNA (mRNA) expression level in the liver with respect to organic zinc and 10, 20, and 40 ppm nano-zinc.Experimental animals and dietary allocationApparently disease-free, healthy, motile C. chanos fries (0.35 ± 0.05 g) were procured from the pond of the Central Institute of Breakwater Aquaculture (CIBA), Kakdwip Research Centre, and were acclimatized for 15 days in 600-L fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) tanks. The fish were fed twice daily (morning and evening) at 10% of their body weight. The waste was siphoned out and 80% water was exchanged at 3-day intervals to ensure the wellbeing of the fish with the least stress (28). No mortality was recorded during the present acclimatization period. The fish were observed for mortality daily, and dead fish were immediately removed. The water quality parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonia–nitrogen, etc.) were monitored regularly.After the initial acclimatization, a total of 450 fish were randomly allocated into five treatment groups (
Table 1
), each with three replicates and each replicate containing 30 fish. The fish in T1 were fed the basal diet without any zinc supplementation; the fish in T2 were fed the basal diet supplemented with 20 ppm zinc proteinate; and the fish in the other three treatment groups (T3, T4, and T5) were supplemented with 10, 20, and 40 ppm nano-zinc oxide, respectively, as depicted in 
Table 1
. The basal feeder remained isonitrogenous and isocaloric throughout the feeding trial across the treatment groups.Table 1Experimental design.GroupReplicateDietary treatmentT13Basal feed (without zinc)T23Basal feed + 20 ppm organic zincT33Basal feed + 10 ppm nano-zincT43Basal feed + 20 ppm nano-zincT53Basal feed + 40 ppm nano-zincThe feeding trial continued for 120 days and was followed by a digestibility trial extending for 5 days. At the end of the feeding trial, three fish from each replicate were collected in compliance with the guidelines for experimentation on fishes set by the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), Government of India. At the end of the feeding trial, three fish from each replicate were sacrificed by a registered veterinarian (PNC). The fish were firstly taken out from the tank and were euthanized using 0.1% of 100 ml clove oil at a rate of per liter of sterile water.

All other reagents were of analytical and molecular biology grade.Synthesis, confirmation of cDNA, and PCR amplification of the geneThe 20-μl reaction mixture contained 5 μg of total RNA, 0.5 μg of oligo dT primer (16–18 mer), 40 U of ribonuclease inhibitor, 10 M of dNTP mix, 10 mM of DTT, and 5 U of MuMLV reverse transcriptase in reverse transcriptase buffer. The reaction mixture was gently mixed and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by heating the mixture at 70°C for 10 min and chilling on ice. The integrity of the cDNA was assessed by PCR. The primers used are listed in

Prediction of the signal peptide of the genes was conducted using the software SignalP3.0 Server—prediction results (Technical University of Denmark). Analysis of the O-linked glycosylation sites was carried out using the NetOGlyc 4 server (https://www.expassy.org/), whereas the N-linked glycosylation sites were detected using NetNGlyc 1.0 software (https://www.expassy.org/). The regions for the alpha-helix and beta-sheet were predicted using NetSurfP-Protein Surface Accessibility and Secondary Structure Predictions, Technical University of Denmark (33). Domain linker prediction was performed according to the software developed (34). The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding sites (35), as well as the LPS signaling sites (36), were predicted based on homology studies with other species of polypeptide.Three-dimensional structure prediction and model quality assessmentThe templates with the highest sequence ID entity to our target template were identified using PSI-BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast). Homology modeling was used to build a three-dimensional (3D) structure based on homologous template structures using the PHYRE2 server (37). The 3D structures were visualized with PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org/), which is an open-source molecular visualization tool. Subsequently, the mutant model was generated using PyMoL tools. The Swiss PDB Viewer was employed to control energy minimization. Structural evaluation, along with a stereochemical quality assessment of the predicted model, was carried out using SAVES (Structural Analysis and Verification Server), which is an integrated server (http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES/). The ProSA (Protein Structure Analysis) web server (https://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa) was used for the refinement and validation of the protein structure (38). ProSA was used to evaluate the structural quality of the model with potential errors, and the program shows a plot of its residue energies and Z-scores, which determine the overall quality of the model. The solvent accessibility surface area of the genes was generated using the NetSurfP server (https://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetSurfP/) (33). This calculates the relative surface accessibility, the Z-fit score, the probabilities for both the alpha-helix and the beta-strand, and the coil score, among others. TM-align software was used for the alignment of the 3D structure of the IR proteins for different species and for the estimation of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) to assess structural differentiation (39). I-Mutant analysis was conducted for the mutations detected to assess the thermodynamic stability. PROVEAN analysis was conducted to assess the deleterious nature of the mutant amino acid. The PDB structure for the 3D structural prediction of the gene for milkfish was carried out using PHYRE software (38). Protein–protein interactions were examined using STRING analysis (40).Differential mRNA expression profiling of the IRF3 gene in C. chanos

Three-dimensional structure prediction and model quality assessmentThe templates with the highest sequence ID entity to our target template were identified using PSI-BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast). Homology modeling was used to build a three-dimensional (3D) structure based on homologous template structures using the PHYRE2 server (37). The 3D structures were visualized with PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org/), which is an open-source molecular visualization tool. Subsequently, the mutant model was generated using PyMoL tools. The Swiss PDB Viewer was employed to control energy minimization. Structural evaluation, along with a stereochemical quality assessment of the predicted model, was carried out using SAVES (Structural Analysis and Verification Server), which is an integrated server (http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES/). The ProSA (Protein Structure Analysis) web server (https://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa) was used for the refinement and validation of the protein structure (38). ProSA was used to evaluate the structural quality of the model with potential errors, and the program shows a plot of its residue energies and Z-scores, which determine the overall quality of the model. The solvent accessibility surface area of the genes was generated using the NetSurfP server (https://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetSurfP/) (33). This calculates the relative surface accessibility, the Z-fit score, the probabilities for both the alpha-helix and the beta-strand, and the coil score, among others. TM-align software was used for the alignment of the 3D structure of the IR proteins for different species and for the estimation of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) to assess structural differentiation (39). I-Mutant analysis was conducted for the mutations detected to assess the thermodynamic stability. PROVEAN analysis was conducted to assess the deleterious nature of the mutant amino acid. The PDB structure for the 3D structural prediction of the gene for milkfish was carried out using PHYRE software (38). Protein–protein interactions were examined using STRING analysis (40).

The expression of the IRF3 gene gradually increased in three nano-zinc supplement treatments: T3 (10 ppm nano-zinc supplementation), T4 (20 ppm nano-zinc supplementation), and T5 (40 ppm nano-zinc supplementation).Figure 10Differential mRNA Expression profiling of IRF3 gene of Chanos chanos upon feeding with zinc of different sources.

However, the 10- and 20-ppm nano-zinc-supplemented groups showed better expression of IRF3 than the T2 group. When the concentration of nano-zinc increased to 40 ppm, the expression of the IRF3 gene was also highly upregulated.

DiscussionZinc is an extremely critical micronutrient needed in an adequate amount at the tissue level in order to impart proper antioxidant status and optimum immunity to fight against pathogens. The antibacterial effects of nano-zinc have already been established (27, 42, 43). The bioavailability of zinc has been recorded to be quite high and with good antimicrobial potential (27). For dietary fortification, synthesized nano-ZnO was used at up to 40 ppm based on the recommendation of our earlier studies (27, 44).To overcome the issues of bioavailability and to impart a higher antioxidant status, attempts are in vogue (27, 45, 46) to develop different varieties of nano-zinc for use in dietary fortification. A number of researchers have synthesized a zinc nanoparticle (206 nm) and observed its positive impact on the immune response and antioxidant status of fish (47). Different varieties of zinc nanoparticles (size range between 105.7 and 122.4 nm) have also been devised and evaluated for their efficacy in different fish models (48). One special variety of dietary nano-zinc oxide was synthesized with a particle size of 50–60 nm and fortified the diet of grass carp with the aim of imparting better body defense (49). The particle sizes of the synthesized nano-zinc ranged from 10 to 50 nm and from 20 to 120 nm, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies (50).Zinc has already been reported to possess an antiviral effect against retroviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2, among others (51). Several studies have proven that zinc has antiviral activity against hepatitis virus (52). Zinc oxide nanoparticles protected the Madin–Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell culture and experimental rabbits that were infected with herpesvirus (53). It also has the potential to induce varied gene expression related to immunity, including Toll-like receptors, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and IL-1β, among others (54). However, research has been limited at a certain level, and there is no report elucidating the molecular mechanism.We found several reports demonstrating the effect of nano-zinc on viruses and the mechanism of how they destroy a particular virus. However, our aim was to determine the molecular mechanism and the effect of synthesized nano-zinc on the expression of a gene that initiates signaling against viral infection through studying the detailed molecular structure using bioinformatics tools. This experiment attempted to assess the antiviral potential of nano-zinc, with IRF3 as a marker gene. IRF3 is considered to be one of the most important factors in antiviral signaling (15). In aquaculture, virus infection is one of the major threats (55), which often causes serious economic losses (56). When fishes are infected with a virus, severe mortality occurs (57), along with associated morbidity losses. It is a challenge to fight viral diseases in aquaculture. Therefore, there is an urgent need to search for a natural ingredient/additive to provide a considerable degree of protection against sudden viral infections.This study showed that nano-zinc upregulates the expression of the IRF3 gene. IRF3 can fight against both RNA and DNA viruses (58, 59). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that IRF3 is involved in three antiviral signaling pathways: the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. When an RNA virus infects the cell, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway is activated in the cytosol by the activation of IRF3 through MAVS and TRAF3 (60, 61). This activated IRF3 then stimulates the activation of IFNαβ and initiates antiviral activity. When the double-stranded DNA is recognized by TLR3 in the endosome in the Toll-like receptor pathway, IRF3 is stimulated through TRIF, TRAF3, and TBK1 by interacting with TLR3 (62). Subsequently, IFNα and IFNβ are activated by IRF3 and initiate an antiviral signaling pathway. In the case of the cytosolic DNA binding pathway, when the cell is infected with a virus, IRF3 is activated through ZBP1, TBK1, and IKK. Now activated, IRF3 then stimulates the production of IFNα and IFNβ and provides cell antiviral protection (58, 63). IRF3 initiates antiviral activity by activating two factors, i.e., IFNα and IFNβ (14, 15).
IRF3 has a tryptophan pentad domain that helps in the cellular response to viruses. This domain can recognize any change in the state or activity of a cell that is mediated by the stimulus of a virus (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0098586). There is another domain present in IRF3, i.e., the NS3 domain. It plays an important role in viral infection. NS3 hydrolyzes the four peptides bonded in the viral precursor polyprotein; thus, NS3 can destroy the viruses that infect the host cell (https://ftp.expasy.org/databases/prosite). The activated IRF3 functions against viral pathogens through the tryptophan pentad domain and the NS3 domain.Organic zinc and nano-zinc differ in particle size. The smaller size of nano-zinc provides a high surface area, bioavailability, and more efficacy than organic zinc. Organic zinc is always in competition with other micronutrients and cannot be properly absorbed. Due to this, bulk-sized zinc cannot easily enter the IRF3 protein and cannot be placed properly through all the different zinc binding sites of the protein. This is why organic zinc fails to upregulate the expression of the IRF3 gene. On the other hand, nano-zinc is small and there is no chance to compete with other micronutrients. It can also easily enter the protein and properly bind with the different zinc binding sites of the protein. When nano-zinc binds with the IRF3 protein, it activates IRF3 against viral pathogens by activating the tryptophan pentad domain and the NS3 domain and stimulating its expression. When the concentration of nano-zinc increases, more zinc particles can accumulate with the protein and increase its expression.From this experiment, it can be revealed that nano-zinc stimulates the signaling against viral pathogens by upregulating the IRF3 protein expression, and IRF3 stimulates IFNα and IFNβ, which then initiate antiviral signaling. Nano-zinc has the potential to fight against viral infection in the cell.

ConclusionThe IRF3 gene plays an extremely crucial role in the antiviral pathway. In the present study, the highest expression was recorded among fish that received feed fortified with 40 ppm nano-zinc. The corresponding STRING and KEGG pathway analyses revealed the possible mechanism of the higher IRF3 expression as induced by nano-zinc. Due to the higher bioavailability of nano-zinc, it can saturate the zinc binding sites present in IRF3 and can modulate its expression profiling in C. chanos. The present study explored the possible mechanism of action of nano-zinc in conferring antiviral immunity via the upregulation of the IRF3 gene, which could be used as a molecular marker to assess the antiviral protection in C. chanos. Nano-zinc oxide not only acts as an antibacterial agent but can also be used as a potential antiviral agent.Future scopeIn the future, this study could be propagated with challenging studies against pathogenic viruses by maintaining an appropriate biosecurity protocol.
