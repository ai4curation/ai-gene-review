## Abstract

Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta (TRIF) associates 
with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 and TANK-binding kinase 1, and activates 
two distinct transcription factors, NF-kappa B and IFN-regulatory factor-3, in 
the Toll-like receptor signaling.

We previously reported a new Toll/IL-1R (TIR)-containing molecule, named TIR 
domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta (TRIF). Although initial study 
indicated that TRIF possesses the ability to activate not only the 
NF-kappaB-dependent but also the IFN-beta promoters, the molecular mechanisms of 
TRIF-induced signaling are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the 
signaling cascades through TRIF. TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)6 
interacted with TRIF through the TRAF domain of TRAF6 and TRAF6-binding motifs 
found in the N-terminal portion of TRIF. Disruption of TRAF6-binding motifs of 
TRIF disabled it from associating with TRAF6, and resulted in a reduction in the 
TRIF-induced activation of the NF-kappaB-dependent but not IFN-beta promoter. 
TANK-binding kinase (TBK)-1, which was recently reported to be a kinase of IFN 
regulatory factor-3, which is an essential transcription factor for IFN-beta 
expression, also associated with the N-terminal region of TRIF. Moreover, the 
association between TRIF and TBK1 appeared to require the kinase activity of 
TBK1, as well as phosphorylation of TRIF. Because TRAF6 and TBK1 bind close the 
region of TRIF, it seems that TRAF6 physically prevents the association between 
TRIF and TBK1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that TRIF associates 
with TRAF6 and TBK1 independently, and activates two distinct transcription 
factors, NF-kappaB and IFN regulatory factor-3, respectively.
