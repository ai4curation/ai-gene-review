Sleep apnea (SA) is defined as intermittent respiratory arrest during sleep and 
affects up to 20% of the adult population. SA is also associated with an 
increased incidence of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. Exposing 
rodents to intermittent hypoxia during sleep mimics the cyclical 
hypoxia/normoxia of SA. We have previously shown that in mice and rats 
intermittent hypoxia induces ET-1 upregulation and systemic hypertension. 
Furthermore, intermittent hypoxia (IH) in mice increases nuclear factor of 
activated T cells isoform 3 (NFATc3) transcriptional activity in aorta and 
mesenteric arteries, whereas the calcineurin/NFAT inhibitor cyclosporin A 
prevents IH-induced hypertension. More importantly, NFATc3 knockout (KO) mice do 
not develop IH-induced hypertension. The goals of this study were to determine 
the role of NFATc3 in IH-induced arterial remodeling and whether IH-induced 
NFATc3 activation is mediated by ET-1. Oral administration of both a dual 
(bosentan) and a selective endothelin receptor type A antagonist (PD155080) 
during 2 days of IH exposure attenuated NFAT activation in aorta and mesenteric 
arteries. Rho kinase inhibition with fasudil also prevented IH-induced NFAT 
activation. Mesenteric artery cross-sectional wall thickness was increased by IH 
in wild-type (WT) and vehicle-treated mice but not in bosentan-treated and 
NFATc3 KO mice. The arterial remodeling in mesenteric arteries after IH was 
characterized by increased expression of the hypertrophic NFATc3 target smooth 
muscle-alpha-actin in WT but not in KO mice. These results indicate that ET-1 is 
an upstream activator of NFATc3 during intermittent hypoxia, contributing to the 
resultant hypertension and increased wall thickness.
