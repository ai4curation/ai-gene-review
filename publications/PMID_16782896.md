The relationship between translation and mRNA turnover is critical to the 
regulation of gene expression. One major pathway for mRNA turnover occurs by 
deadenylation, which leads to decapping and subsequent 5'-to-3' degradation of 
the body of the mRNA. Prior to mRNA decapping, a transcript exits translation 
and enters P bodies to become a potential decapping substrate. To understand the 
transition from translation to decapping, it is important to identify the 
factors involved in this process. In this work, we identify Sbp1p (formerly 
known as Ssb1p), an abundant RNA binding protein, as a high-copy-number 
suppressor of a conditional allele in the decapping enzyme. Sbp1p overexpression 
restores normal decay rates in decapping-defective strains and increases P-body 
size and number. In addition, Sbp1p promotes translational repression of mRNA 
during glucose deprivation. Moreover, P-body formation is reduced in strains 
lacking Sbp1p. Sbp1p acts in conjunction with Dhh1p, as it is required for 
translational repression and P-body formation in pat1Delta strains under these 
conditions. These results identify Sbp1p as a new protein that functions in the 
transition of mRNAs from translation to an mRNP complex destined for decapping.
