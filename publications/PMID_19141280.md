The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is an eight-subunit protein complex that is found in 
all eukaryotes. Accumulating evidence indicates its diverse biological functions 
that are often linked to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Here we applied an 
emerging mass spectrometry approach to gain insight into the structure of the 
CSN complex. Our results indicate that the catalytically active human complex, 
reconstituted in vitro, is composed of a single copy of each of the eight 
subunits. By forming a total of 35 subcomplexes, we are able to build a 
comprehensive interaction map that shows two symmetrical modules, Csn1/2/3/8 and 
Csn4/5/6/7, connected by interactions between Csn1-Csn6. Overall the stable 
modules and multiple subcomplexes observed here are in agreement with the 
"mini-CSN" complexes reported previously. This suggests that the propensity of 
the CSN complex to change and adapt its subunit composition might underlie its 
ability to perform multiple functions in vivo.
