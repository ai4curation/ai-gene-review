Identification of a tankyrase-binding motif shared by IRAP, TAB182, and human 
TRF1 but not mouse TRF1. NuMA contains this RXXPDG motif and is a novel

Tankyrase-1 and -2 are closely related poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases that use an 
ankyrin-repeat domain to bind diverse proteins, including TRF (telomere-repeat 
binding factor)-1, IRAP (insulin-responsive aminopeptidase), and TAB182 (182-kDa 
tankyrase-binding protein). TRF1 binding allows tankyrase to regulate telomere 
dynamics in human cells, whereas IRAP binding presumably allows tankyrase to 
regulate the targeting of IRAP. The mechanism by which tankyrase binds to 
diverse proteins has not been investigated. Herein we describe a novel RXXPDG 
motif shared by IRAP, TAB182, and human TRF1 that mediates their binding to 
tankyrases. Interestingly, mouse TRF1 lacks this motif and thus does not bind 
either tankyrase-1 or -2. Using the ankyrin domain of tankyrase as a bait in a 
yeast two-hybrid screen, we also found the RXXPDG motif in six candidate 
tankyrase partners, including the nuclear/mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA). We 
verified NuMA as an RXXPDG-mediated partner of tankyrase and suggest that this 
interaction contributes to the known colocalization of tankyrase and NuMA at 
mitotic spindle poles.
