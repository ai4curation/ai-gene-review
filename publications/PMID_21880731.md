finger protein 2 provides insights into the regulation of histone 
acetyltransferases monocytic leukemic zinc-finger protein (MOZ) and MOZ-related 
factor (MORF).

MOZ (monocytic leukemic zinc-finger protein) and MORF (MOZ-related factor) are 
histone acetyltransferases important for HOX gene expression as well as embryo 
and postnatal development. They form complexes with other regulatory subunits 
through the scaffold proteins BRPF1/2/3 (bromodomain-PHD (plant homeodomain) 
finger proteins 1, 2, or 3). BRPF proteins have multiple domains, including two 
PHD fingers, for potential interactions with histones. Here we show that the 
first PHD finger of BRPF2 specifically recognizes the N-terminal tail of 
unmodified histone H3 (unH3) and report the solution structures of this PHD 
finger both free and in complex with the unH3 peptide. Structural analysis 
revealed that the unH3 peptide forms a third antiparallel β-strand that pairs 
with the PHD1 two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. The binding specificity was 
determined primarily through the recognition of arginine 2 and lysine 4 of the 
unH3 by conserved aspartic acids of PHD1 and of threonine 6 of the unH3 by a 
conserved asparagine. Isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR assays showed 
that post-translational modifications such as H3R2me2as, H3T3ph, H3K4me, H3K4ac, 
and H3T6ph antagonized the interaction between histone H3 and PHD1. Furthermore, 
histone binding by PHD1 was important for BRPF2 to localize to the HOXA9 locus 
in vivo. PHD1 is highly conserved in yeast NuA3 and other histone 
acetyltransferase complexes, so the results reported here also shed light on the 
function and regulation of these complexes.
