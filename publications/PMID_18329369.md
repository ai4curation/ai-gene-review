Cytokinesis involves the formation of a cleavage furrow, followed by abscission, 
the cutting of the midbody channel, the final bridge between dividing cells. 
Recently, the midbody ring became known as central for abscission, but its 
regulation remains enigmatic. Here, we identify BRUCE, a 528 kDa multifunctional 
protein, which processes ubiquitin-conjugating activity, as a major regulator of 
abscission. During cytokinesis, BRUCE moves from the vesicular system to the 
midbody ring and serves as a platform for the membrane delivery machinery and 
mitotic regulators. Depletion of BRUCE in cell cultures causes defective 
abscission and cytokinesis-associated apoptosis, accompanied by a block of 
vesicular targeting and defective formation of the midbody and the midbody ring. 
Notably, ubiquitin relocalizes from midbody microtubules to the midbody ring 
during cytokinesis, and depletion of BRUCE disrupts this process. We propose 
that BRUCE coordinates multiple steps required for abscission and that 
ubiquitylation may be a crucial trigger.
