The higher-plant shoot meristem is a dynamic structure whose maintenance depends 
on the coordination of two antagonistic processes, organ initiation and 
self-renewal of the stem cell population. In Arabidopsis shoot and floral 
meristems, the WUSCHEL (WUS) gene is required for stem cell identity, whereas 
the CLAVATA1, 2, and 3 (CLV) genes promote organ initiation. Our analysis of the 
interactions between these key regulators indicates that (1) the CLV genes 
repress WUS at the transcript level and that (2) WUS expression is sufficient to 
induce meristem cell identity and the expression of the stem cell marker CLV3. 
Our data suggest that the shoot meristem has properties of a self-regulatory 
system in which WUS/CLV interactions establish a feedback loop between the stem 
cells and the underlying organizing center.
