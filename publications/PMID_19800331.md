BAG-1, a multifunctional protein, interacts with a plethora of cellular targets 
where the interaction with HSC70 and HSP70, is considered vital. Structural 
studies have demonstrated the C-terminal of BAG-1 forms a bundle of three 
alpha-helices of which helices 2 and 3 are directly involved in binding to the 
chaperones. Here we found peptides derived from helices 2 and 3 of BAG-1 
interfered with BAG-1:HSC70 binding. We confirmed that a 12 amino-acid peptide 
from helix 2 directly interacted with HSC70 and when introduced into MCF-7 and 
ZR-75-1 cells, these peptides inhibited their growth. In conclusion, we have 
identified a small domain within BAG-1 which appears to play a critical role in 
the interaction with HSC70.
