Sin3 and Rpd3 negatively regulate a diverse set of yeast genes. A mouse 
Sin3-related protein is a transcriptional corepressor, and a human Rpd3 homolog 
is a histone deacetylase. Here, we show that Sin3 and Rpd3 are specifically 
required for transcriptional repression by Ume6, a DNA-binding protein that 
regulates genes involved in meiosis. A short region of Ume6 is sufficient to 
repress transcription, and this repression domain mediates a two-hybrid and 
physical interaction with Sin3. Coimmunoprecipitation and two-hybrid experiments 
indicate that Sin3 and Rpd3 are associated in a complex distinct from TFIID and 
Pol II holoenzyme. Rpd3 is specifically required for repression by Sin3, and 
artificial recruitment of Rpd3 results in repression. These results suggest that 
repression by Ume6 involves recruitment of a Sin3-Rpd3 complex and targeted 
histone deacetylation.
