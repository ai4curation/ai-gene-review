The signature domain of thrombospondins consists of tandem epidermal growth 
factor-like modules, 13 calcium-binding repeats, and a lectin-like module. 
Although very similar, the signature domains of thrombospondin-1 and -2 differ 
in several potentially important ways from the domains of thrombospondin-3, -4, 
and -5. We have compared matching recombinant segments representing the 
signature domains of thrombospondin-2 and -4. In the presence of 2 mM CaCl2, the 
far UV circular dichroism spectra of thrombospondin-2 and -4 constructs contain 
a strong negative band at 202 nm, but only the thrombospondin-2 construct has a 
band at 216 nm. Chelation of calcium shifted the negative bands to lower 
magnitudes. Titrations of the spectra demonstrated lower cooperativity and 
affinity for binding of calcium to thrombospondin-4 compared with 
thrombospondin-2. Atomic absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the 
thrombospondin-4 constructs bind seven less calcium than the thrombospondin-2 
construct at 0.6 mM CaCl2. In 2 mM CaCl2, the near UV circular dichroism spectra 
of thrombospondin-2, but not thrombospondin-4, contain a positive band at 292 nm 
that disappears upon calcium chelation. Intrinsic fluorescence spectra for both 
proteins were also sensitive to calcium, but the changes were simpler and more 
marked for thrombospondin-2 than for thrombospondin-4. In differential scanning 
calorimetry, the thrombospondin-2 construct melted in two distinct transitions 
at 53.5 and 81.8 degrees C, whereas the first transition for thrombospondin-4 
constructs was observed at 63.5 degrees C. Thus, the studies revealed 
significant differences between the signature domains of thrombospondin-2 and 
thrombospondin-4 in calcium binding, fine structure, and inter-modular 
interactions.

Abstract

The signature domain of thrombospondins consists of tandem epidermal growth factor-like modules, 13 calcium-binding repeats, and a lectin-like module. Although very similar, the signature domains of thrombospondin-1 and -2 differ in several potentially important ways from the domains of thrombospondin-3, -4, and -5. We have compared matching recombinant segments representing the signature domains of thrombospondin-2 and -4. In the presence of 2 m m CaCl 2 , the far UV circular dichroism spectra of thrombospondin-2 and -4 constructs contain a strong negative band at 202 nm, but only the thrombospondin-2 construct has a band at 216 nm. Chelation of calcium shifted the negative bands to lower magnitudes. Titrations of the spectra demonstrated lower cooperativity and affinity for binding of calcium to thrombospondin-4 compared with thrombospondin-2. Atomic absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the thrombospondin-4 constructs bind seven less calcium than the thrombospondin-2 construct at 0.6 m m CaCl 2 . In 2 m m CaCl 2 , the near UV circular dichroism spectra of thrombospondin -2, but not thrombospondin-4, contain a positive band at 292 nm that disappears upon calcium chelation. Intrinsic fluorescence spectra for both proteins were also sensitive to calcium, but the changes were simpler and more marked for thrombospondin-2 than for thrombospondin-4. In differential scanning calorimetry, the thrombospondin-2 construct melted in two distinct transitions at 53.5 and 81.8 °C, whereas the first transition for thrombospondin-4 constructs was observed at 63.5 °C. Thus, the studies revealed significant differences between the signature domains of thrombospondin-2 and thrombospondin-4 in calcium binding, fine structure, and inter-modular interactions.

RESULTS

For comparisons of the TSP-4 signature domain to the E123CaG-2 signature domain of TSP-2, for which there is a crystal structure ( 4 ), we expressed E122′3CaG-4 containing either Ala or Pro at position 387 in E2′( Fig. 1 ). When the sequences of TSP-2 and -4 are aligned, it is apparent that E2 of TSP-4 is most like E2 of TSP-2, and the extra EGF-like module (E2′), although most like E2, is the EGF-like module that is present in TSP-4 and missing in TSP-2 ( Fig. 2 ). The proteins were cloned and expressed using a baculovirus expression system and purified using nickel chelate chromatography ( 7 , 18 ). The yields of purified TSP-4 proteins were 10–40 mg/liter conditioned medium. This level of expression is comparable with the expression of the TSP-2 proteins ( 7 ) and much higher than the secretion of intact TSP-1 or -2 under the same conditions (data not shown). All truncated proteins were soluble and amenable to structural and functional analyses.

DISCUSSION

Comparison of the TSP-4 E122′3CaG-4 constructs to the analogous TSP-2 construct E123CaG-2 using CD, fluorescence, atomic absorption, and calorimetry reveal significant differences in structure and calcium-binding properties between the signature domains of the two TSPs. Because the signature domain of TSP-4 is most similar to that of TSP-3 and next most similar to TSP-5 ( 3 ), the analyses of TSP-4 structure are pertinent to understanding all three of the pentameric TSPs.

Atomic absorption spectroscopy showed that, in 0.6 m m CaCl 2 , E122′3CaG-4 binds seven less calcium ions than E123CaG-2. The 28 ± 1 calcium ions bound to E123CaG-2 using atomic absorption spectroscopy agrees with the crystal structure of E123CaG-2. The far UV CD titration data indicate that the structural change in E123CaG-2 upon calcium binding is complete by 0.5 m m CaCl 2 , but only 40–50% complete for E122′3CaG-4 ( Fig. 4 ). Therefore, complete binding would not be expected for the TSP-4 constructs at 0.6 m m CaCl 2 , in which case E122′3CaG-4 may lack fewer than 7 calcium-binding sites when fully saturated. Asp 744 and Asn 746 of repeat 3C of TSP-2 are replaced with Ala and Gly, respectively, in TSP-4 ( Fig. 2 ). The crystal structure of E123CaG-2 shows that the side chains of Asp 744 and Asn 746 help coordinate two calcium ions ( 4 ). Loss of at least two calcium-binding sites in TSP-4 is, therefore, predicted. These sites are also likely lacking in TSP-3 and -5. The presence of four extra residues in repeat 11C of E122′3CaG-4 may hinder the repeat from adopting its distinctive calcium-binding fold and further compromise calcium binding to TSP-4 ( 4 ). Because TSP-3 also contains this insertion ( 3 ), its folding would be predicted to be similarly affected. Numerous studies indicate that alterations in one calcium-binding repeat change the kinetics of binding to adjacent repeats. The N700S polymorphism in calcium-binding repeat 1C of TSP-1, which results in the loss of a single calcium-binding site, is associated with lower affinity binding and decreased rate of binding to the next three calcium-binding repeats ( 22 ). In TSP-5, single missense mutations in the calcium-binding repeats associated with pseudoachondroplasia or multiple epiphyseal dysplasia have been found to result in a reduction in the amount of calcium bound, the affinity of binding, and the cooperativity of binding ( 23 – 25 ). It seems reasonable to hypothesize, therefore, that the loss of two binding sites in repeat 3C and the possible altered conformation of repeat 11C lead to the observed decreases in affinity and cooperativity of TSP-4.

Intrinsic fluorescence, near UV CD, and far UV CD data suggest that the structure of G differs in TSP-2 and TSP-4. The far UV CD spectra of both E122′3CaG-4 and E123CaG-2 have a negative band at 202 nm, but only E123CaG-2 has a negative band at 216 nm ( Fig. 3 ). This negative band at 216 nm in TSP-2 can be attributed to G inasmuch as it is present in C-terminal TSP-2 constructs containing G but absent in constructs lacking G ( 7 ). The near UV CD spectra of TSP-4 are lacking a positive band at 292 nm ( Fig. 6 ), which has been shown to be attributable to the tryptophan residues in G of TSP-2 ( 7 ). CD bands in the near UV spectra are observed when aromatic residues are immobilized in an asymmetric environment ( 26 ). The lack of a peak at 292 nm indicates that the tryp-tophan residues are either not immobilized in an asymmetric environment or are immobilized in different orientations, and the resulting CD bands cancel each other out. Such differences in tryptophan, in addition to differences in secondary structure, may contribute to changes in far UV CD spectra as well ( 26 ). Differences in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the TSP-4 and -2 proteins ( Figs. 7 and 8 ) are also primarily due to changes in the environment of the conserved tryptophans of G ( 7 ). Although the calcium-replete fluorescence spectra are similar, with a λmax value of ~332 nm ( Fig. 7 ), removal of calcium red shifts the λmax value of 4.5 nm for E123CaG-2 and only 1.5 nm for E122′3CaG-4 ( TABLE ONE ), and calcium titration curves monitored using fluorescence have two transitions for TSP-4 and only one for TSP-2 ( Fig. 8 ).

DSC revealed differences in the thermal stability of the TSP-4 and -2 proteins. E123CaG-2 melts with transitions at 53.5° and 81.8 °C ( Fig. 5 ). Previously, we found that E3CaG-2 melts with transitions at 50.5° and 82.7 °C ( 7 ). The first transition was assigned to unfolding of the inter-modular interface among E3, the calcium-binding repeats, and G, whereas the second transition was assigned to the unfolding of the calcium-binding repeats ( 7 ). The increase in the first transition, when E12 is added to E3CaG-2, is compatible with the observed interaction between the C-terminal part of the calcium-binding repeats and E2 in the crystal structure of E123CaG-2 ( 4 ). Only one transition at 63.5 °C was observed for the TSP-4 proteins before they precipitated ( Fig. 5 ). Because the proteins precipitated between 75° and 80 °C, it is unknown whether another transition would have occurred if the experiment could have been completed. In other words, the 63.5° transition may be the only transition, thereby corresponding to both the unfolding of the calcium-binding repeats and the unfolding of the intermodular interface, or it may be the first transition corresponding to the unfolding of the interface only. Either way, a difference in stability is apparent between the E122′3CaG-4 constructs and the homologous E123CaG-2 construct. Without a crystal structure for TSP-4, however, the exact nature of the difference is unknown.

Because of the putative role of the A387P TSP-4 polymorphism in premature myocardial infarction ( 14 – 16 ), we expressed the C-terminal region of hTSP-4 as both the common (Ala 387 ) and polymorphic (Pro 387 ) forms. High levels of TSP-4 mRNA have been detected in heart and skeletal muscles ( 9 ), and human endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells from brain blood vessels and coronary arteries have been shown to express TSP-4 mRNA ( 10 ). A recombinant E122′3Ca piece of TSP-4 with the Pro 387 allele suppresses endothelial cell adhesion and proliferation, suggesting that it is a “gain of function” polymorphism that is proatherogenic ( 10 ). Recently, an E122′3 Pro 387 construct has been reported to have an additional Tb 3+ -binding site ( 27 ). However, our analyses failed to reveal significant structural differences in E122′3CaG-4 due to the polymorphism. Atomic absorption spectroscopy indicated that both TSP-4 proteins bind the same number of calcium ions. Far UV CD, near UV CD, and intrinsic fluorescence spectra for E122′3CaG-4 Ala 387 and Pro 387 are virtually identical ( Figs. 3 , 4 , 6 , and 7 ), and DSC showed similar thermal stabilities ( Fig. 5 ). Therefore, the A387P single nucleotide polymorphism does not appear to affect the overall protein structure of E122′3CaG-4 nor does it alter its calcium-binding properties. The polymorphic TSP-4 contains a Pro instead of an Ala at position 387 in the third EGF-like module (E2′) of TSP-4 ( Fig. 2 ). Comparative NMR analysis of a proline to alanine (P1148A) missense mutation in calcium binding EGF13 of fibrillin-1 has revealed that the fibrillin mutation also does not result in a structural defect in EGF13 or the adjacent EGFs ( 28 ). Similar to Pro 1148 of fibrillin-1, Pro 387 of TSP-4 is in a calcium-binding EGF and is expected to be in a turn (not a β-sheet) ( 4 ). The striking differences in the effects of the constructs based on common and polymorphic TSP-4 on the phenotype of endothelial cells ( 10 ) is, therefore, likely due to an altered interaction with some cellular component caused by a local structural change in the third EGF rather than by an overall structural change.

Together, the calcium binding, spectroscopic, and calorimetric data reveal significant structural differences in the C-terminal regions of TSP-2 and -4, especially in the lectin-like G domain. Further analysis of TSP-4 is necessary to determine which structural differences account for the altered calcium-binding properties. It may not be any single difference but rather a combination of differences that leads to fewer calcium-binding sites in TSP-4, a decrease in cooperativity of binding, and differences in fluorescence and CD spectra.
