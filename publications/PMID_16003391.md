Calmodulin (CaM) influences many cellular processes by interacting with various 
proteins. Here, we isolated AtBAG6, an Arabidopsis CaM-binding protein that 
contains a central BCL-2-associated athanogene (BAG) domain. In yeast and 
plants, overexpression of AtBAG6 induced cell death phenotypes consistent with 
programmed cell death (PCD). Recombinant AtBAG6 had higher affinity for CaM in 
the absence of free Ca2 + than in its presence. An IQ motif (IQXXXRGXXXR, where 
X denotes any amino-acid) was required for Ca2 +-independent CaM complex 
formation and single amino-acid changes within this motif abrogated both 
AtBAG6-activated CaM-binding and cell death in yeast and plants. A 
134-amino-acid stretch, encompassing both the IQ motif and BAG domain, was 
sufficient to induce cell death. Agents generating oxygen radicals, which are 
known to be involved in plant PCD, specifically induced the AtBAG6 transcript. 
Collectively, these results suggest that AtBAG6 is a stress-upregulated 
CaM-binding protein involved in plant PCD.
