A three base-pair deletion in the widely expressed TOR1A gene causes the 
childhood onset, neurological disease of DYT1 dystonia. Mouse Tor1a gene 
knockout also specifically affects the developing nervous system. However, in 
both cases, the basis of neuronal tissue specificity is unknown. TorsinA is one 
of four predicted mammalian torsin ATPases associated with assorted cellular 
activities (AAA+) proteins, raising the possibility that expression of a 
functionally homologous torsin compensates for torsinA loss in non-neuronal 
tissues. We find that all four mammalian torsins are endoplasmic reticulum 
resident glycoproteins. TorsinA, torsinB and torsin2 are all present in large 
M(r) complexes, which suggests that each assembles into an oligomeric AAA+ 
enzyme. Introducing a mutation (WB(EQ)) that typically stabilizes AAA+ proteins 
in a substrate-bound state causes torsinA and torsinB to associate with a shared 
nuclear envelope (NE) binding partner and this NE localization requires the 
torsinA interacting protein, lamina associated polypeptide 1. Although torsin 
proteins are widely expressed in the adult mouse, we identified that embryonic 
neuronal tissues contain relatively low torsinB levels. Therefore, our results 
reveal that torsinB expression inversely correlates with the cell and 
developmental requirement for torsinA. In conclusion, multiple cell types appear 
to utilize torsin AAA+ proteins and differential expression of torsinB may 
contribute to both the neuronal specific importance of torsinA and the symptom 
specificity of DYT1 dystonia.
