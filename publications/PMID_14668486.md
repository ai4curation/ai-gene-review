The correlation between longevity and stress resistance observed in long-lived 
mutant animals suggests that the ability to sense and respond to environmental 
challenges could be important for the regulation of life span. We therefore 
examined the role of heat shock factor (HSF-1), a master transcriptional 
regulator of stress-inducible gene expression and protein folding homeostasis, 
in the regulation of longevity. Down-regulation of hsf-1 by RNA interference 
suppressed longevity of mutants in an insulin-like signaling (ILS) pathway that 
functions in the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans to influence aging. 
hsf-1 was also required for temperature-induced dauer larvae formation in an ILS 
mutant. Using tissue-specific expression of wild-type or dominant negative 
HSF-1, we demonstrated that HSF-1 acts in multiple tissues to regulate 
longevity. Down-regulation of individual molecular chaperones, transcriptional 
targets of HSF-1, also decreased longevity of long-lived mutant but not 
wild-type animals. However, suppression by individual chaperones was to a lesser 
extent, suggesting an important role for networks of chaperones. The interaction 
of ILS with HSF-1 could represent an important molecular strategy to couple the 
regulation of longevity with an ancient genetic switch that governs the ability 
of cells to sense and respond to stress.
