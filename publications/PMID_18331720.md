Snail family transcriptional repressors regulate epithelial mesenchymal 
transitions during physiological and pathological processes. A conserved SNAG 
repression domain present in all vertebrate Snail proteins is necessary for 
repressor complex assembly. Here, we identify the Ajuba family of LIM proteins 
as functional corepressors of the Snail family via an interaction with the SNAG 
domain. Ajuba LIM proteins interact with Snail in the nucleus on endogenous 
E-cadherin promoters and contribute to Snail-dependent repression of E-cadherin. 
Using Xenopus neural crest as a model of in vivo Snail- or Slug-induced EMT, we 
demonstrate that Ajuba LIM proteins contribute to neural crest development as 
Snail/Slug corepressors and are required for in vivo Snail/Slug function. 
Because Ajuba LIM proteins are also components of adherens junctions and 
contribute to their assembly or stability, their functional interaction with 
Snail proteins in the nucleus suggests that Ajuba LIM proteins are important 
regulators of epithelia dynamics communicating surface events with nuclear 
responses.
