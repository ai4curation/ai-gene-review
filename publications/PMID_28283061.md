Cytokines are classically thought to stimulate downstream signaling pathways 
through monotonic activation of receptors. We describe a severe anemia resulting 
from a homozygous mutation (R150Q) in the cytokine erythropoietin (EPO). 
Surprisingly, the EPO R150Q mutant shows only a mild reduction in affinity for 
its receptor but has altered binding kinetics. The EPO mutant is less effective 
at stimulating erythroid cell proliferation and differentiation, even at 
maximally potent concentrations. While the EPO mutant can stimulate effectors 
such as STAT5 to a similar extent as the wild-type ligand, there is reduced 
JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of select downstream targets. This impairment in 
downstream signaling mechanistically arises from altered receptor dimerization 
dynamics due to extracellular binding changes. These results demonstrate how 
variation in a single cytokine can lead to biased downstream signaling and can 
thereby cause human disease. Moreover, we have defined a distinct treatable form 
of anemia through mutation identification and functional studies.

INTRODUCTION

The majority of receptor signaling pathways are generally thought to function
through a simple model of activation, which then promotes downstream signal
propagation by a variety of distinct mechanisms ( Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010 ; Spangler
et al., 2015 ). For G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), groundbreaking
insight from human physiologic and pharmacologic responses has revealed the
existence of functional selectivity or biased agonism, whereby a single receptor is
capable of variable activation of distinct downstream pathways in response to
different ligands ( Kenakin, 2011 ; Wisler et al., 2014 ). The extent to which other
receptor signaling pathways utilize such functional selectivity in physiologic
settings remains unclear, particularly for receptor signaling systems that require
either homo- or heterodimerization for activation. Such signaling systems include
receptor tyrosine kinases and cytokine receptors ( Kovacs et al., 2015 ; Kovanen and
Leonard, 2004 ; Lemmon et al.,
2016 ; Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010 ; Spangler et al., 2015 ). Recent studies
have shown that engineered bivalent antibody fragments can display biased agonism
through altered geometry of cytokine receptor interactions ( Moraga et al., 2015b ). Moreover, subtypes of cytokine
classes such as type I interferons, which signal through a common set of receptors,
display selectivity toward specific physiologic responses as a result of alterations
in receptor-ligand binding affinities ( Spangler et
al., 2015 ; Thomas et al., 2011 ; Wilmes et al., 2015 ). How signals from
other natural ligands are ‘tuned’ in this way remains largely
unexplored, however, as do the in vivo consequences of variable
activation of specific signaling pathways downstream of cytokines.

In the context of GPCRs, functional selectivity or biased agonism has been
shown to arise from alteration of equilibrium binding affinity of a ligand to its
receptor or from stabilization of particular receptor confirmations as a result of
ligand binding ( Kenakin, 2011 ; Manglik et al., 2015 ; Wisler et al., 2014 ). A variety of analytic methods have
been developed to formalize this concept and primarily rely upon the measurement of
the dissociation constant that an agonist has for a particular activity (potency)
and the maximal achievable effect downstream of a particular signaling response
(efficacy) ( Kenakin, 2011 ; Rajagopal et al., 2011 ). Indeed, metrics to quantify
biased agonism, such as the “transducer ratio,” have relied upon
comparisons between the efficacy and potency for a particular response ( Kenakin et al., 2012 ). In an analogous manner
with GPCRs, recent studies of cytokine signaling have shown that both alteration of
ligand-receptor affinities or stabilization of alternative conformational states can
lead to biased agonism ( Moraga et al., 2015b ; Wilmes et al., 2015 ). However, emerging
evidence suggests that kinetic parameters may also have a key role in determining
the extent of biased agonism observed in GPCR signaling ( Klein Herenbrink et al., 2016 ). Here, through the investigation
of rare experiments of nature, we uncover a cytokine-receptor binding kinetic
mechanism that alters receptor dimerization dynamics and causes biased downstream
signaling by JAK2. Additionally, the insight gained through these functional studies
has allowed us to successfully apply recombinant cytokine therapy in a patient with
a rare mutation affecting cytokine signaling.

DISCUSSION

By using both genetic and experimental studies ( Casanova et al., 2014 ; MacArthur et al., 2014 ), we identified a missense variant in the EPO gene that results in congenital hypoplastic anemia. These
rare experiments of nature illustrate how functional selectivity in receptor
signaling can have important physiologic consequences, and to the best of our
knowledge provide the first examples of how this can result in human disease.
Despite the ability of the proband and his sibling with the homozygous R150Q
mutations to upregulate EPO production to levels that should offset induced affinity
changes, these patients could not compensate for the defect in EPO signaling to
enable normal erythropoiesis. Our studies show that the R150Q EPO cannot achieve the
same maximal efficacy as WT EPO in terms of promoting erythroid differentiation or
proliferation. Treatment with corticosteroids, which can expand early erythroid
progenitors independently from EPO ( Flygare et al.,
2011 ), allowed the proband to have an improvement in the anemia, which
shows that some signaling through EPOR is still possible with the R150Q mutant, as
we directly demonstrate through in vitro studies. In addition, the
infant sister of the proband who had a reticulocytopenic anemia demonstrated a
robust hematologic response to treatment with recombinant erythropoietin, suggesting
that through the functional studies we have performed, we have been able to define a
treatable form of congenital hypoplastic anemia. This provides a rare example of how
whole exome sequencing and follow up studies can lead to successful and modified
treatment approaches, as has been recently described for specific metabolic disorder
cases ( Tarailo-Graovac et al., 2016 ).

Our results are consistent with a model of altered ligand-receptor binding
kinetics resulting in impaired receptor dimerization dynamics. More rapid
dissociation of the R150Q EPO ligand (t 1/2 of less than 10 seconds for
the R150Q mutant compared to greater than 5 minutes for WT) prevents optimal EPOR
signaling by restricting activation of JAK2 and thereby limiting its ability to
fully activate specific downstream effectors, including STAT1 and STAT3. We observe
that these particular targets are more sensitive to inhibition by the JAK2
inhibitors, ruxolitinib and CHZ868. These findings demonstrate that specific JAK2
targets can have variable propensities for phosphorylation, depending upon the
extent of JAK2 activation. We show that the R150Q EPO ligand behaves as a partial
agonist for JAK2 activation at maximal potency and therefore results in biased
signaling. Overall, our findings from a pathologic case demonstrate a mechanism
through which tuning of intracellular signaling downstream from cytokine receptors
can be achieved via alteration of JAK2 activation. It is likely that other cytokine
signaling systems may take advantage of such tuning mechanisms to alter downstream
signaling responses ( Spangler et al.,
2015 ).

Several analyses have investigated ‘kinetic proofreading’ in
receptors ( Klein Herenbrink et al., 2016 ; Lemmon et al., 2016 ; McKeithan, 1995 ; Thomas
et al., 2011 ), and their findings suggest that productive receptor
signaling can only occur if the activating ligand remains bound for sufficient time
to allow the multiple steps required for downstream receptor signaling to ensue
– against the background of multiple rapid inactivation steps. Our results
show how this mechanism can be of relevance to EPO and other cytokine signaling
pathways. Faster dissociation of the mutant ligand prevents optimal EPOR
dimerization and downstream JAK2 activation, demonstrating that kinetic parameters
have a key role in determining the quality of signaling achieved downstream of such
receptors. An important implication of these findings is that, analogous to biased
agonists identified for various G protein-coupled receptors ( Kenakin, 2011 ; Wisler et
al., 2014 ), cytokine receptors can also display such behavior to altered
ligands and this can have important physiological consequences as shown by the
patient that led us to investigate this phenomenon. This also suggests that beyond
alteration of conformation and affinity, which have previously been suggested as
mechanisms for tuning cytokine signaling ( Moraga et
al., 2015b ; Wilmes et al., 2015 ),
kinetic parameters can have a key role in altering downstream responses.

By applying the principle of functional selectivity, it may also be possible
to design agonists that achieve specific physiologic responses downstream of
endogenous cytokine pathways, while avoiding other untoward effects. Thus,
modification of ligand-receptor kinetic parameters could tune downstream
intracellular signaling responses and lead to more effective therapeutic
manipulation of cytokine signaling. Our findings stress the importance of looking at
downstream signaling using multiparameter approaches, such as through surveys of a
broad array of phosphorylated proteins ( Knapp et
al., 2017 ; Krutzik et al., 2011 ).
As in the case we have examined here, specific targets such as STAT5 show normal
activation at maximally potent concentrations of the mutant ligand. However, the
same extent of erythropoiesis can never be achieved with this mutant as we show in vitro , which is completely consistent with what has been
observed in vivo in the patients. Examining multiple responses
allows for ascertainment of functional selectivity in such settings. Our findings
that began with rare experiments of nature highlight the importance of considering
both dynamic states of activation and the multidimensional nature of downstream
responses in the context of cytokine signaling.
