Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a transcription factor induced under 
severe hypoxia and a component of the PERK pathway involved in the unfolded 
protein response (UPR), a process that protects cells from the negative 
consequences of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In this study, we have used 
small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microarray analysis to provide the first 
whole-genome analysis of genes regulated by ATF4 in cancer cells in response to 
severe and prolonged hypoxic stress. We show that ATF4 is required for ER stress 
and hypoxia-induced expansion of autophagy. MAP1LC3B (LC3B) is a key component 
of the autophagosomal membrane, and in this study we demonstrate that ATF4 
facilitates autophagy through direct binding to a cyclic AMP response element 
binding site in the LC3B promoter, resulting in LC3B upregulation. Previously, 
we have shown that Bortezomib-induced ATF4 stabilization, which then upregulated 
LC3B expression and had a critical role in activating autophagy, protecting 
cells from Bortezomib-induced cell death. We also showed that severe hypoxia 
stabilizes ATF4. In this study, we demonstrate that severe hypoxia leads to ER 
stress and induces ATF4-dependent autophagy through LC3 as a survival mechanism. 
In summary, we show that ATF4 has a key role in the regulation of autophagy in 
response to ER stress and provide a direct mechanistic link between the UPR and 
the autophagic machinery.
