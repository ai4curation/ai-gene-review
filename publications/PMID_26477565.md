We have analyzed the distribution of mitochondrial contact site and cristae 
organizing system (MICOS) complex proteins and mitochondrial intermembrane space 
bridging complex (MIB) proteins over (sub)complexes and over species. The MICOS 
proteins are associated with the formation and maintenance of mitochondrial 
cristae. Indeed, the presence of MICOS genes in genomes correlates well with the 
presence of cristae: all cristae containing species have at least one MICOS gene 
and cristae-less species have none. Mic10 is the most widespread MICOS gene, 
while Mic60 appears be the oldest one, as it originates in the ancestors of 
mitochondria, the proteobacteria. In proteobacteria the gene occurs in clusters 
with genes involved in heme synthesis while the protein has been observed in 
intracellular membranes of the alphaproteobacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. In 
contrast, Mic23 and Mic27 appear to be the youngest MICOS proteins, as they only 
occur in opisthokonts. The remaining MICOS proteins, Mic10, Mic19, Mic25 and 
Mic12, the latter we show to be orthologous to human C19orf70/QIL1, trace back 
to the root of the eukaryotes. Of the remaining MIB proteins, also DNAJC11 shows 
a high correlation with the presence of cristae. In mitochondrial protein 
complexome profiles, the MIB complex occurs as a defined complex and as separate 
subcomplexes, potentially reflecting various assembly stages. We find three main 
forms of the complex: A) The MICOS complex, containing all the MICOS proteins, 
B) a membrane bridging subcomplex, containing in addition SAMM50, MTX2 and the 
previously uncharacterized MTX3, and C) the complete MIB complex containing in 
addition DNAJC11 and MTX1.
