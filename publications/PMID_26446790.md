The activity of the mitochondrial replicase, DNA polymerase γ (Pol γ) is 
stimulated by another key component of the mitochondrial replisome, the 
mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB). We have performed a 
comparative analysis of the human and Drosophila Pols γ with their cognate 
mtSSBs, evaluating their functional relationships using a combined approach of 
biochemical assays and electron microscopy. We found that increasing 
concentrations of both mtSSBs led to the elimination of template secondary 
structure and gradual opening of the template DNA, through a series of visually 
similar template species. The stimulatory effect of mtSSB on Pol γ on these 
ssDNA templates is not species-specific. We observed that human mtSSB can be 
substituted by its Drosophila homologue, and vice versa, finding that a lower 
concentration of insect mtSSB promotes efficient stimulation of either Pol. 
Notably, distinct phases of the stimulation by both mtSSBs are distinguishable, 
and they are characterized by a similar organization of the template DNA for 
both Pols γ. We conclude that organization of the template DNA is the major 
factor contributing to the stimulation of Pol γ activity. Additionally, we 
observed that human Pol γ preferentially utilizes compacted templates, whereas 
the insect enzyme achieves its maximal activity on open templates, emphasizing 
the relative importance of template DNA organization in modulating Pol γ 
activity and the variation among systems.
