Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients are predisposed to learning 
disabilities, macrocephaly, and brain tumors as well as abnormalities on 
magnetic resonance imaging that are postulated to result from abnormal 
myelination. Here we show that Nf1+/- spinal cords in adult mice have more than 
twofold-increased numbers of NG2+ progenitor cells. Nf1-/- embryonic spinal 
cords have increased numbers of Olig2+ progenitors. Also, cultures from Nf1 
mutant embryos with hemizygous and biallelic Nf1 mutations have dramatically 
increased numbers of CNS oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. In medium that allows 
growth of neuroepithelial cells and glial progenitors, mutant cells 
hyper-respond to FGF2, have increased basal and FGF-stimulated Ras-GTP, and fail 
to accumulate when treated with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor. Cell 
accumulation results in part from increased proliferation and decreased cell 
death. In contrast to wild-type cells, Nf1-/- progenitors express the glial 
differentiation marker O4 while retaining expression of the progenitor marker 
nestin. Nf1 mutant progenitors also abnormally coexpress the glial 
differentiation markers O4 and GFAP. Importantly, Nf1-/- spinal cord-derived 
oligodendrocyte progenitors, which are amplified 12-fold, retain the ability to 
form oligodendrocytes after in vivo transplantation. The data reveal a key role 
for neurofibromin and Ras signaling in the maintenance of CNS progenitor cell 
pools and also suggest a potential role for progenitor cell defects in the CNS 
abnormalities of NF1 patients.
