Photoaffinity labeling and site-directed mutagenesis have been used to identify 
amino acid residues of the phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1) N-terminal SH2 
domain involved in recognition of the activated epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR). The photoactive amino acid p-benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa) was incorporated 
into phosphotyrosine-containing peptides derived from EGFR autophosphorylation 
sites Tyr992 and Tyr1068. Irradiation of these labels in the presence of SH2 
domains showed cross-linking which was time-dependent and specific; labeling was 
inhibited with non-Bpa-containing peptides from EGFR in molar excess. The 
phosphotyrosine residue on the peptides was important for SH2 recognition, as 
dephosphorylated peptides did not cross-link. Radiolabeled peptides were used to 
identify sites of cross-linking to the N-terminal SH2 of PLC gamma 1. Bpa 
peptide-SH2 complexes were digested with trypsin, and radioactive fragments were 
purified by HPLC and analyzed by Edman sequencing. These experiments showed 
Arg562 and an additional site in the alpha A-beta B region of the SH2 domain, 
most likely Glu587, to be labeled by the Tyr992-derived peptide. Similar 
analysis of the reaction with the Tyr1068-derived photoaffinity label identified 
Leu653 as the cross-linked site. Mutation of the neighboring residues of Glu587 
decreased photo-cross-linking, emphasizing the importance of this region of the 
molecule for recognition. These results are consistent with evidence from the 
v-Src crystal structure and implicate the loop spanning residues Gln640-Ser654 
of PLC gamma 1 in specific recognition of phosphopeptides.
