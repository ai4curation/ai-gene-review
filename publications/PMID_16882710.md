Apoptotic cells were shown to induce dendritic cell immune tolerance. We applied 
a proteomic approach to identify molecules that are secreted from apoptotic 
monocytes, and thus may mediate engulfment and immune suppression. Supernatants 
of monocytes undergoing apoptosis were collected and compared using sodium 
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and 
differentially expressed proteins were identified using tandem mass 
spectrometry. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and its cleaved 26-kDa heparin-binding 
domain (HBD) were identified. We show that TSP-1 is expressed upon induction of 
monocyte apoptosis in a caspase-dependent pattern and the HBD is cleaved by 
chymotrypsin-like serine protease. We further show that CD29, CD36, CD47, CD51, 
and CD91 simultaneously participate in engulfment induction and generation of an 
immature dendritic cell (iDC) tolerogenic and phagocytic state. We conclude that 
apoptotic cell TSP-1, and notably its HBD, creates a signalosome in iDCs to 
improve engulfment and to tolerate engulfed material prior to the interaction 
with apoptotic cells.
