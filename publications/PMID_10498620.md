Oncogenic RAS alleles encode proteins that accumulate in the guanosine 
triphosphate (GTP)-bound state. Because post-translational processing of Ras by 
farnesyltransferase is essential for biologic function, inhibitors of this 
enzyme have been developed as rational cancer therapeutics. We have investigated 
farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) L-744,832 in an in vivo murine model of 
myeloid leukemia that is associated with inactivation of the Nf1 tumor 
suppressor gene. Nf1 encodes a GTPase activating protein for Ras, and 
Nf1-deficient (Nf1-/-) hematopoietic cells show hyperactive Ras signaling 
through the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. L-744,832 inhibited 
H-Ras prenylation in cell lines and in primary hematopoietic cells and abrogated 
the in vitro growth of myeloid progenitor colonies in response to 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This FTI also 
partially blocked GM-CSF-induced MAP kinase activation, but did not reduce 
constitutively elevated levels of MAP kinase activity in primary Nf1-/- cells. 
Injection of a single dose of 40 or 80 mg/kg of L-744, 832 increased the amount 
of unprocessed H-Ras in bone marrow cells, but had no detectable effect on 
N-Ras. Adoptive transfer of Nf1-/- hematopoietic cells into irradiated mice 
induces a myeloproliferative disorder that did not respond to L-744,832 
treatment. We speculate that the lack of efficacy in this model is due to the 
resistance of N-Ras and K-Ras processing to inhibition by this FTI.
