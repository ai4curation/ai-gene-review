ERp57 is a member of the protein disulphide isomerase family of oxidoreductases, 
which are involved in native disulphide bond formation in the endoplasmic 
reticulum of mammalian cells. This enzyme has been shown to be associated with 
both calnexin and calreticulin and, therefore, has been proposed to be a 
glycoprotein-specific oxidoreductase. Here, we identify endogenous substrates 
for ERp57 by trapping mixed disulphide intermediates between enzyme and 
substrate. Our results demonstrate that the substrates for this enzyme are 
mostly heavily glycosylated, disulphide bonded proteins. In addition, we show 
that the substrate proteins share common structural domains, indicating that 
substrate specificity may involve specific structural features as well as the 
presence of an oligosaccharide side chain. We also show that the folding of two 
of the endogenous substrates for ERp57 is impaired in ERp57 knockout cells and 
that prevention of an interaction with calnexin or calreticulin perturbs the 
folding of some, but not all, substrates with multiple disulphide bonds. These 
results suggest a specific role for ERp57 in the isomerisation of non-native 
disulphide bonds in specific glycoprotein substrates.
