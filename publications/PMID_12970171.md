Mnt is a Max-interacting transcriptional repressor that has been hypothesized to 
function as a Myc antagonist. To investigate Mnt function we deleted the Mnt 
gene in mice. Since mice lacking Mnt were born severely runted and typically 
died within several days of birth, mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from 
these mice and conditional Mnt knockout mice were used in this study. In the 
absence of Mnt, MEFs prematurely entered the S phase of the cell cycle and 
proliferated more rapidly than Mnt(+/+) MEFs. Defective cell cycle control in 
the absence of Mnt is linked to upregulation of Cdk4 and cyclin E and the Cdk4 
gene appears to be a direct target of Mnt-Myc antagonism. Like MEFs that 
overexpress Myc, Mnt(-/-) MEFs were prone to apoptosis, efficiently escaped 
senescence and could be transformed with oncogenic Ras alone. Consistent with 
Mnt functioning as a tumor suppressor, conditional inactivation of Mnt in breast 
epithelium led to adenocarinomas. These results demonstrate a unique negative 
regulatory role for Mnt in governing key Myc functions associated with cell 
proliferation and tumorigenesis.
