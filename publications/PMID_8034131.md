The integral membrane protein synaptophysin is one of the major polypeptide 
components of the small, electron-translucent, transmitter-containing vesicles 
in neurons and of similar vesicles in neuroendocrine (NE) cells. In an attempt 
to identify synaptophysin-related molecules, such as synaptoporin, it was 
noticed in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments that products having the 
expected size could be amplified not only from neuronal and NE cells, but also 
from non-NE cells. Northern blot hybridization analyses demonstrated that 
certain non-NE cells express low amounts of synaptophysin mRNA although the 
encoded polypeptide could not be detected. These observations, however, did not 
explain the consistent amplification of cDNA fragments regardless of cell type. 
PCR products were therefore cloned and a novel type of cDNA was identified in 
rat and human. The partial human cDNA was completed by isolation of phage cDNA 
clones constructed from a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) and by PCR. When 
used in hybridization experiments with genomic DNA, this clone recognized a 
single gene. The 2106 bp cDNA contains an open reading frame coding for a 
polypeptide of calculated molecular weight 28,565 and having an isoelectric 
point of 8.45. This polypeptide is very similar to synaptophysin in the four 
transmembrane domains and the connecting loop regions but lacks the 
characteristic cytoplasmic tail. Extensive PCR analyses and Northern blot 
hybridization experiments demonstrated that the synaptophysin-related gene is 
ubiquitously expressed in vitro and in vivo. To stress the ubiquity of 
expression in contrast to the restricted distribution of synaptophysin and 
synaptoporin, I propose to refer to the encoded polypeptide as pantophysin.
