We previously reported that PGRN directly bound to TNF receptors (TNFR) in vitro 
and in chondrocytes (Tang, et al., Science, 2011). Here we report that PGRN also 
associated with TNFR in splenocytes, and inhibited the binding of TNFα to immune 
cells. Proper folding of PGRN is essential for its binding to TNFR, as DTT 
treatment abolished its binding to TNFR. In contrast, the binding of PGRN to 
Sortilin was enhanced by DTT. Protein interaction assays with mutants of the 
TNFR extracellular domain demonstrated that CRD2 and CRD3 of TNFR are important 
for the interaction with PGRN, similar to the binding to TNFα. Taken together, 
these findings provide the molecular basis underlying PGRN/TNFR interaction and 
PGRN-mediated anti-inflammatory activity in various autoimmune diseases and 
conditions.
