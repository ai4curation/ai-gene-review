Plant development is profoundly regulated by ambient light cues through the 
red/far-red photoreceptors, the phytochromes. Early phytochrome signaling events 
include the translocation of phytochromes from the cytoplasm to subnuclear 
domains called photobodies and the degradation of antagonistically acting 
phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs). We recently identified a key phytochrome 
signaling component, HEMERA (HMR), that is essential for both phytochrome B 
(phyB) localization to photobodies and PIF degradation. However, the signaling 
mechanism linking phytochromes and HMR is unknown. Here we show that 
phytochromes directly interact with HMR to promote HMR protein accumulation in 
the light. HMR binds more strongly to the active form of phytochromes. This 
interaction is mediated by the photosensory domains of phytochromes and two 
phytochrome-interacting regions in HMR. Missense mutations in either HMR or phyB 
that alter the phytochrome/HMR interaction can also change HMR levels and 
photomorphogenetic responses. HMR accumulation in a constitutively active phyB 
mutant (YHB) is required for YHB-dependent PIF3 degradation in the dark. Our 
genetic and biochemical studies strongly support a novel phytochrome signaling 
mechanism in which photoactivated phytochromes directly interact with HMR and 
promote HMR accumulation, which in turn mediates the formation of photobodies 
and the degradation of PIFs to establish photomorphogenesis.

HMR binds more strongly to the active form of phytochromes. This interaction is mediated by the photosensory domains of phytochromes and two phytochrome-interacting regions in HMR. Missense mutations in either HMR or phyB that alter the phytochrome/HMR interaction can also change HMR levels and photomorphogenetic responses. HMR accumulation in a constitutively active phyB mutant ( YHB ) is required for YHB-dependent PIF3 degradation in the dark. Our genetic and biochemical studies strongly support a novel phytochrome signaling mechanism in which photoactivated phytochromes directly interact with HMR and promote HMR accumulation, which in turn mediates the formation of photobodies and the degradation of PIFs to establish photomorphogenesis.

Discussion

Early phy signaling events include the translocation of phys from the cytoplasm to photobodies as well as the rapid degradation of PIFs ( Chen and Chory 2011 ; Leivar and Quail 2011 ). HMR was identified as a phy signaling component required for both of these early events ( M Chen et al. 2010 ). Here, we provide evidence supporting a novel light signaling mechanism by which photoactivated phys directly interact with HMR and promote HMR accumulation in the light, and HMR accumulation facilitates photobody localization of phys and subsequent PIF degradation to establish photomorphogenesis ( Fig. 7 ).

The first light response mediated by phys at the molecular level is the photoconversion of phy from the Pr form to the Pfr form. The conformational changes accompanied by the photoactivation of phys alter the binding affinities between phy and phy-interacting proteins, and these structural and binding property changes mediate early phy signaling events ( Rockwell et al. 2006 ; Bae and Choi 2008 ; Nagatani 2010 ). A number of phy-interacting proteins have been identified that bind preferentially to the Pfr form of phys. One example is FHY1 (far-red elongated hypocotyl 1) and its homolog, FHL (FHY1-like). FHY1 and FHL bind to the Pfr form of phyA and mediate both phyA nuclear accumulation and signaling ( Hiltbrunner et al. 2005 , 2006 ; Genoud et al. 2008 ; Shen et al. 2009 ; Yang et al. 2009 ). Another well-studied example is the family of PIF proteins, which have been suggested to regulate phyB protein levels and mediate the expression of hundreds of light-responsive genes ( Al-Sady et al. 2008 ; Jang et al. 2010 ; Leivar and Quail 2011 ). Here, we show that HMR is another direct binding partner of both phyA and phyB. The phy/HMR interaction is light-regulated, as GST-HMR interacts preferentially with the Pfr form of both phyA and phyB as well as with the constitutively active YHB mutant ( Figs. 2A , 5A ). This light-dependent phy/HMR interaction could be explained by the fact that HMR interacts with the photosensory GAF/PHY domains of phyA and likely phyB as well ( Fig. 3 ). Therefore, conformational changes between the Pr and Pfr forms of phys could have a direct impact on HMR binding. We further confirmed the phy/HMR interaction in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation of HMR-HA and phyA ( Fig. 2C ). The direct interactions between HMR and both phyA and phyB suggest that HMR participates in the early signaling steps downstream from both phyA and phyB. Consistent with this conclusion, previous and current genetic studies show that HMR acts downstream from phyA and phyB and is required for multiple early phy signaling events as well as for YHB signaling in the dark ( Fig. 5 ; M Chen et al. 2010 ). Although we mainly focused on the light-dependent interaction between HMR and phy holoproteins, we also consistently observed that GST-HMR interacted more strongly with the phy apoproteins than with the corresponding holoproteins ( Fig. 2A ). This could be an artifact due to contaminants from the phycocyanobilin extract. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that there is biological significance for the strong interaction between HMR and phy apoproteins. For example, HMR could bind to phy apoproteins and facilitate their chromophorylation. However, our previous result showing YHB fluorescence in the hmr-1 background argues against this hypothesis ( M Chen et al. 2010 ).

The phy/HMR interaction is required for phy signaling, and this conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence. First, the phy/HMR interaction is required for the accumulation of HMR in the light. Supporting the cause/effect relationship between this interaction and HMR accumulation, single amino acid substitutions in either HMR (HMR R293K in hmr-12 ) or phyB (YHB) altered the affinity between phys and HMR and also dramatically affected HMR accumulation ( Figs. 4 , 5 ). In addition, the nuclear pool of HMR was increased in both light-grown Col-0 and dark-grown YHB seedlings relative to the dark-grown controls ( Fig. 1G ; Supplemental Fig. S7), suggesting that the accumulation of HMR in the nucleus might be a direct consequence of the phy/HMR interaction. Second, the phy/HMR interaction may be important in regulating phy localization to photobodies, as HMR is essential for at least phyB to localize to large photobodies. Although the localization of phyA in the hmr mutant has not been investigated, phyA degradation is impaired in hmr mutants ( M Chen et al. 2010 ), which implies that phyA localization to photobodies could also be regulated by HMR.

Light-triggered PIF degradation is a central mechanism to switch from skotomorphogenesis to photomorphogenesis ( Leivar et al. 2008b ; Shin et al. 2009 ). The current model suggests that photoactivated phys interact with PIFs and trigger their phosphorylation as well as their subsequent degradation ( Bauer et al. 2004 ; Shen et al. 2005 , 2007 ; Al-Sady et al. 2006 ; Oh et al. 2006 ; Nozue et al. 2007 ; Lorrain et al. 2008 ). However, the mechanism of PIF degradation is unknown ( Leivar and Quail 2011 ). Because PIF3 localizes to photobodies with phyA and phyB prior to its degradation, it was proposed that PIFs could be recruited to photobodies for degradation ( Bauer et al. 2004 ; Al-Sady et al. 2006 ). This hypothesis has been supported by several lines of evidence. First, mutations in the phyA- and phyB-binding domains of PIF3 block PIF3 localization to photobodies as well as PIF3 degradation during the dark-to-light transition ( Al-Sady et al. 2006 ), suggesting that the recruitment of PIF3 to photobodies is phy-dependent. Second, mutations in the light-sensing knot of phyB disrupt its interaction with multiple PIFs without affecting phyB's localization to photobodies. However, these phyB mutants are not functional ( Oka et al. 2008 ; Kikis et al. 2009 ). These results suggest that the localization of phyB to photobodies does not require the interaction with PIFs and that the recruitment of PIFs to photobodies by phys is required for phy signaling. Third, the role of photobodies in PIF degradation is further supported by the characterization of the hmr mutant, in which phyB-GFP fails to localize to large photobodies. Consequently, both PIF1 and PIF3 fail to be degraded in the light ( M Chen et al. 2010 ). It was also shown that HMR is structurally similar to the yeast multiubiquitin-binding protein Rad23 and that it is localized to the periphery of photobodies, which raises the possibility that HMR itself is directly involved in PIF degradation ( M Chen et al. 2010 ). In this study, we further substantiate this model by characterizing PIF3 levels in the YHB and hmr-1 / YHB double mutants. We showed that the YHB mutant is able to trigger PIF3 degradation in the dark ( Fig. 5C ), suggesting that the constitutively photomorphogenetic phenotype of YHB is at least in part due to the removal of PIFs. More interestingly, we showed that YHB is not sufficient for PIF degradation, as hmr-1 / YHB double mutants partially reversed the PIF3 degradation phenotype of YHB ( Fig. 5C ). This result suggests that the presence of HMR is essential for PIF degradation. We previously reported that HMR is required for YHB to localize to large photobodies in the dark ( M Chen et al. 2010 ). Therefore, our present study, combined with our previous results, supports a model in which HMR accumulation facilitates photobody localization of photoactivated phyB and the subsequent degradation of PIFs ( Fig. 7 ). Although this model suggests that PIFs are degraded on photobodies, there is still a possibility that PIFs are only modified on photobodies and are degraded elsewhere ( Van Buskirk et al. 2012 ). Additional evidence is still needed to discern these possibilities.

The establishment of photomorphogenesis by phys in the light is mediated by not only the removal of the negatively-acting PIFs, but also the accumulation or stabilization of a number of positively acting factors. These factors include HY5 (elongated hypocotyl 5) ( Koornneef et al. 1980 ; Oyama et al. 1997 ), LAF1 (long after far-red light 1) ( Ballesteros et al. 2001 ), HFR1 (long hypocotyl in far-red 1) ( Fairchild et al. 2000 ), and some members of the B-box zinc finger family (BBX) ( Kumagai et al. 2008 ; Khanna et al. 2009 ), such as CONSTANS (CO)/BBX1 ( Laubinger et al. 2006 ; Liu et al. 2008 ), COL3 (CONSTANS-like 3)/BBX4 ( Datta et al. 2006 ), LZF1 (light-regulated zinc finger protein 1)/STH3 (salt tolerance homolog 3)/BBX22 ( Chang et al. 2008 , 2011 ; Datta et al. 2008 ), and BBX21/STH2 (salt tolerance homolog 2) ( Datta et al. 2007 ). These proteins are actively degraded in the dark by the E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1 (constitutively photomorphogenic 1) and/or the Cullin4–DDB1 (damaged DNA-binding protein 1)–COP1–SPA (suppressor of phytochrome A-105 ) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex ( Osterlund et al. 2000 ; Seo et al. 2003 ; Duek et al. 2004 ; Jang et al. 2005 ; Yang et al. 2005 ; Datta et al. 2006 , 2007 ; Laubinger et al. 2006 ; Liu et al. 2008 ; H Chen et al. 2010 ; Chang et al. 2011 ). Here we show that HMR is another key positive phy signaling component that accumulates in the light. Unlike the previously reported positive signaling components, though, HMR directly interacts with phys. In addition, all previously characterized signaling components accumulating in the light are themselves transcriptional regulators and likely assert their function by regulating light-dependent gene expression. However, HMR is not a transcription factor, and so far there is no evidence to suggest that HMR regulates these positively acting transcription factors. Rather, HMR appears to regulate the proteolysis of the negatively acting PIFs. Therefore, the signaling pathway from HMR to PIFs provides a mechanism that bridges two light signaling branches: one promoting light responses and one inhibiting them.

The discovery of HMR as a phy signaling component in the nucleus suggests that additional early-acting phy signaling components as well as their signaling mechanisms have been missed from previous molecular genetic studies. Therefore, the elucidation of phy-mediated HMR accumulation as well as its significance in photobody formation and PIF degradation marks only the beginning of our understanding of the early phy signaling mechanisms. Many questions remain to be addressed. The precise biochemical function of HMR in PIF degradation remains unclear. Although it has been proposed that HMR might work like Rad23 in the delivery of multiubiquitylated proteins to the proteasome ( M Chen et al. 2010 ), this hypothesis still needs to be further tested. In addition, it is also important to understand how the degradation of HMR itself is regulated, as the level of HMR is restricted in both dark and light conditions. These questions will be the focus of our future investigations. However, the current study is a solid step toward understanding the early phy signaling mechanisms that turn on photomorphogenesis.
