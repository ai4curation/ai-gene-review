The tumor suppressor and transcription factor p53 is a key modulator of cellular 
stress responses and can trigger apoptosis in many cell types, including 
neurons. In this study, we have shown that the Microtubule-Associated Protein 1B 
(MAP1B) light chain can interact with the tumor suppressor p53. We also 
demonstrate that both p53 and the MAP1B light chain (MAP1B-LC1) alter their 
localization from the cytoplasm to the nucleus when neuroblastoma cells, 
SH-SY5Y, are treated with doxorubicin. Additionally, we demonstrate that the 
MAP1B-LC1 negatively regulates p53-dependent transcriptional activity of a 
reporter construct driven by the p21 promoter. Consequently, MAP1B-LC1 binds to 
p53 and this interaction leads to the inhibition of doxorubicin-induced 
apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells.
