Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes severe liver disease but the underlying 
mechanisms are incompletely understood. During chronic HBV infection, the liver 
is recurrently injured by immune cells in the quest for viral elimination. To 
compensate tissue injury, liver regeneration represents a vital process which 
requires proliferative insulin receptor signaling. This study aims to 
investigate the impact of HBV on liver regeneration and hepatic insulin receptor 
signaling. After carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury, liver regeneration 
is delayed in HBV transgenic mice. These mice show diminished hepatocyte 
proliferation and increased expression of fibrosis markers. This is in 
accordance with a reduced activation of the insulin receptor although HBV 
induces expression of the insulin receptor via activation of NF-E2-related 
factor 2. This leads to increased intracellular amounts of insulin receptor in 
HBV expressing hepatocytes. However, intracellular retention of the receptor 
simultaneously reduces the amount of functional insulin receptors on the cell 
surface and thereby attenuates insulin binding in vitro and in vivo. 
Intracellular retention of the insulin receptor is caused by elevated amounts of 
α-taxilin, a free syntaxin binding protein, in HBV expressing hepatocytes 
preventing proper targeting of the insulin receptor to the cell surface. 
Consequently, functional analyses of insulin responsiveness revealed that HBV 
expressing hepatocytes are less sensitive to insulin stimulation leading to 
delayed liver regeneration. This study describes a novel pathomechanism that 
uncouples HBV expressing hepatocytes from proliferative signals and thereby 
impedes compensatory liver regeneration after liver injury.
