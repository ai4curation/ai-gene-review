The human homologue of the recently cloned murine IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R 
alpha1) was cloned from a cDNA library derived from the carcinoma cell line 
CAKI-1. The cloned cDNA encodes a 427 amino acid protein with two consensus 
patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a 
short cytoplasmic tail. The human protein is 74% identical to the murine IL-13R 
alpha1, and 27% identical to the human IL-13R alpha2. CHO cells expressing 
recombinant hIL-13R alpha1 specifically bind IL-13 (Kd approximately 4 nM) but 
not IL-4. Co-expression of the cloned cDNA with that of IL-4R alpha resulted in 
a receptor complex that displayed high affinity for IL-13 (Kd approximately 30 
pM), and that allowed cross-competition of IL-13 and IL-4. Electrophoretic 
mobility shift assay showed that IL-13 and IL-4 were able to activate Stat6 in 
cells expressing both IL-4R alpha and IL-13R alpha1, while no activation was 
observed in cells expressing either one or the other alone.
