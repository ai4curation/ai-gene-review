Insulin receptor signalling has a central role in mammalian biology, regulating 
cellular metabolism, growth, division, differentiation and survival. Insulin 
resistance contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the 
onset of Alzheimer's disease; aberrant signalling occurs in diverse cancers, 
exacerbated by cross-talk with the homologous type 1 insulin-like growth factor 
receptor (IGF1R). Despite more than three decades of investigation, the 
three-dimensional structure of the insulin-insulin receptor complex has proved 
elusive, confounded by the complexity of producing the receptor protein. Here we 
present the first view, to our knowledge, of the interaction of insulin with its 
primary binding site on the insulin receptor, on the basis of four crystal 
structures of insulin bound to truncated insulin receptor constructs. The direct 
interaction of insulin with the first leucine-rich-repeat domain (L1) of insulin 
receptor is seen to be sparse, the hormone instead engaging the insulin receptor 
carboxy-terminal α-chain (αCT) segment, which is itself remodelled on the face 
of L1 upon insulin binding. Contact between insulin and L1 is restricted to 
insulin B-chain residues. The αCT segment displaces the B-chain C-terminal 
β-strand away from the hormone core, revealing the mechanism of a long-proposed 
conformational switch in insulin upon receptor engagement. This mode of 
hormone-receptor recognition is novel within the broader family of receptor 
tyrosine kinases. We support these findings by photo-crosslinking data that 
place the suggested interactions into the context of the holoreceptor and by 
isothermal titration calorimetry data that dissect the hormone-insulin receptor 
interface. Together, our findings provide an explanation for a wealth of 
biochemical data from the insulin receptor and IGF1R systems relevant to the 
design of therapeutic insulin analogues.

Abstract

Insulin receptor signalling has a central role in mammalian biology, regulating cellular metabolism, growth, division, differentiation and survival 1 , 2 . Insulin resistance contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the onset of Alzheimer’s disease 3 ; aberrant signalling occurs in diverse cancers, exacerbated by crosstalk with the homologous type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) 4 . Despite more than three decades of investigation, the three-dimensional structure of the insulin–insulin receptor complex has proved elusive, confounded by the complexity of producing the receptor protein. Here we present the first view, to our knowledge, of the interaction of insulin with its primary binding site on the insulin receptor, on the basis of four crystal structures of insulin bound to truncated insulin receptor constructs. The direct interaction of insulin with the first leucine-rich-repeat domain (L1) of insulin receptor is seen to be sparse, the hormone instead engaging the insulin receptor carboxy-terminal α-chain (αCT) segment, which is itself remodelled on the face of L1 upon insulin binding. Contact between insulin and L1 is restricted to insulin B-chain residues. The αCT segment displaces the B-chain C-terminal β-strand away from the hormone core, revealing the mechanism of a long-proposed conformational switch in insulin upon receptor engagement. This mode of hormone–receptor recognition is novel within the broader family of receptor tyrosine kinases 5 . We support these findings by photo-crosslinking data that place the suggested interactions into the context of the holoreceptor and by isothermal titration calorimetry data that dissect the hormone–insulin receptor interface. Together, our findings provide an explanation for a wealth of biochemical data from the insulin receptor and IGF1R systems relevant to the design of therapeutic insulin analogues.

METHODS SUMMARY

IR310.T was produced by proteolysis of an engineered mini-receptor precursor cIR485 expressed from a stable Chinese hamster ovary Lec8 cell line and purified by ion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), followed by combination with 83-7, re-purification by SEC and finally combination with excess αCT peptide and insulin (or analogue). Crystallization conditions for IR310.T-derived complexes A, B and C were 0.9–1.1M tri-sodium citrate, 0.1 M imidazole-HCl (pH 8.0) + 0.02% sodium azide (NaN 3 ). IR593.αCT was expressed from a stable Chinese hamster ovary Lec8 cell line followed by insulin affinity chromatography and then SEC of the resultant bovine insulin complex. Samples were combined with 83-14 and re-purified by SEC. The crystallization condition for the IR593.αCT-derived complex D was 9% polyethylene glycol 3350, 200 mM proline, 100 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5). Diffraction data were collected at the Australian Synchrotron (beamline MX2) and Diamond Light Source (DLS; beamline I24). Structures were solved by molecular replacement. Introduction of Pap residues into the αCT segment used orthogonal tRNA/amber suppression technology. Mutant holoreceptors were expressed transiently using co-transfected 293PEAK rapid cells in Pap-containing medium. Cell detergent lysates were then subjected to wheat-germ agglutinin chromatography; eluates containing the receptor were concentrated before photo-crosslinking to 125 I-[Tyr A14 ] insulin. Photo-crosslinked products were resolved by gel electrophoresis and auto-radiographed. IR468 was produced by transient expression in HEK293 cells. 125 I-photo-activatable insulin analogues were incubated with IR468 in the presence of 10 −5 M αCT(703–719)– Myc and then photo-crosslinked. Samples were resolved by gel electrophoresis and auto-radiographed. For ITC, Ala-substituted αCT peptides (80 µM concentration) were titrated into a sample cell containing IR485 (10 µM concentration); and zinc-free porcine insulin (32–48 µM concentration) was titrated into a sample cell containing IR485 (4–6 µM concentration) pre-incubated with Ala-substituted αCT peptide (10× molar concentration). All samples were in Tris-buffered saline (pH 8.0) plus azide (TBSA).
