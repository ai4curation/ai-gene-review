Calorie restriction (CR) extends the life span of numerous species, from yeast 
to rodents. Yeast Sir2 is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+-dependent 
histone deacetylase that has been proposed to mediate the effects of CR. 
However, this hypothesis has been challenged by the observation that CR can 
extend yeast life span in the absence of Sir2. Here, we show that 
Sir2-independent life-span extension is mediated by Hst2, a Sir2 homolog that 
promotes the stability of repetitive ribosomal DNA, the same mechanism by which 
Sir2 extends life span. These findings demonstrate that the maintenance of DNA 
stability is critical for yeast life-span extension by CR and suggest that, in 
higher organisms, multiple members of the Sir2 family may regulate life span in 
response to diet.
