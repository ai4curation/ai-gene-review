Ischemic preconditioning is a phenomenon in which low-level stressful stimuli 
upregulate endogenous defensive programs, resulting in subsequent resistance to 
otherwise lethal injuries. We previously observed that signal transduction 
systems typically associated with neurodegeneration such as caspase activation 
are requisite events for the expression of tolerance and induction of HSP70. In 
this work, we sought to determine the extent and duration of oxidative and 
energetic dysfunction as well as the role of effector kinases on metabolic 
function in preconditioned cells. Using an in vitro neuronal culture model, we 
observed a robust increase in Raf and p66(Shc) activation within 1 h of 
preconditioning. Total ATP content decreased by 25% 3 h after preconditioning 
but returned to baseline by 24 h. Use of a free radical spin trap or p66(shc) 
inhibitor increased ATP content whereas a Raf inhibitor had no effect. 
Phosphorylated p66(shc) rapidly relocalized to the mitochondria and in the 
absence of activated p66(shc), autophagic processing increased. The 
constitutively expressed chaperone HSC70 relocalized to autophagosomes. 
Preconditioned cells experience significant total oxidative stress measured by 
F(2)-isoprostanes and neuronal stress evaluated by F(4)-neuroprostane 
measurement. Neuroprostane levels were enhanced in the presence of Shc 
inhibitors. Finally, we found that inhibiting either p66(shc) or Raf blocked 
neuroprotection afforded by preconditioning as well as upregulation of HSP70, 
suggesting both kinases are critical for preconditioning but function in 
fundamentally different ways. This is the first work to demonstrate the 
essential role of p66(shc) in mediating requisite mitochondrial and energetic 
compensation after preconditioning and suggests a mechanism by which protein and 
organelle damage mediated by ROS can increase HSP70.
