The breast cancer susceptibility protein BRCA2 is essential for recombinational 
DNA repair. BRCA2 specifically binds to RAD51 via eight BRC repeat motifs and 
delivers RAD51 to double-stranded DNA breaks. In this study, a mammalian 
two-hybrid assay and competitive ELISA showed that the interaction between BRC 
repeat 4 (BRC4) and RAD51 was strengthened by the substitution of a single BRC4 
amino acid from valine to isoleucine (V1532I). However, the cancer-associated 
V1532F mutant exhibited very weak interaction with RAD51. This study used a 
comparative analysis of BRC4 between animal species to identify V1532 as an 
important residue that interacts with RAD51.
