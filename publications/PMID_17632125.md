Yeast Ubp3 and its co-factor Bre5 form a deubiquitylation complex to regulate 
protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments of 
the cell. A novel N-terminal domain of the Ubp3 catalytic subunit forms a 
complex with the NTF2-like domain of the Bre5 regulatory subunit. Here, we 
report the X-ray crystal structure of an Ubp3-Bre5 complex and show that it 
forms a symmetric hetero-tetrameric complex in which the Bre5 NTF2-like domain 
dimer interacts with two L-shaped beta-strand-turn-alpha-helix motifs of Ubp3. 
The Ubp3 N-terminal domain binds within a hydrophobic cavity on the surface of 
the Bre5 NTF2-like domain subunit with conserved residues within both proteins 
interacting predominantly through antiparallel beta-sheet hydrogen bonds and van 
der Waals contacts. Structure-based mutagenesis and functional studies confirm 
the significance of the observed interactions for Ubp3-Bre5 association in vitro 
and Ubp3 function in vivo. Comparison of the structure to other protein 
complexes with NTF2-like domains shows that the Ubp3-Bre5 interface is novel. 
Together, these studies provide new insights into Ubp3 recognition by Bre5 and 
into protein recognition by NTF2-like domains.
