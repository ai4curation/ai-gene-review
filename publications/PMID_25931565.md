DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) block replication fork progression by 
inhibiting DNA strand separation. Repair of ICLs requires sequential incisions, 
translesion DNA synthesis, and homologous recombination, but the full set of 
factors involved in these transactions remains unknown. We devised a technique 
called chromatin mass spectrometry (CHROMASS) to study protein recruitment 
dynamics during perturbed DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts. Using 
CHROMASS, we systematically monitored protein assembly and disassembly on 
ICL-containing chromatin. Among numerous prospective DNA repair factors, we 
identified SLF1 and SLF2, which form a complex with RAD18 and together define a 
pathway that suppresses genome instability by recruiting the SMC5/6 cohesion 
complex to DNA lesions. Our study provides a global analysis of an entire DNA 
repair pathway and reveals the mechanism of SMC5/6 relocalization to damaged DNA 
in vertebrate cells.
