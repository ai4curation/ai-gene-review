Abscisic acid (ABA) is a stress-inducible plant hormone comprising an inevitable 
component of the human diet. Recently, stress-induced accumulation of autocrine 
ABA was shown in humans, as well as ABA-mediated modulation of a number of 
disease-associated systems. Now, the application of a chemical proteomics 
approach to gain further insight into ABA mechanisms of action in mammalian 
cells is reported. An ABA mimetic photoaffinity probe was applied to intact 
mammalian insulinoma and embryonic cells, leading to the identification of heat 
shock protein 70 (HSP70) family members, (including GRP78 and HSP70-2) as 
putative human ABA-binding proteins. In vitro characterization of the ABA-HSP70 
interactions yielded K(d)s in the 20-60 µM range, which decreased several fold 
in the presence of co-chaperone. However, ABA was found to have only variable- 
and co-chaperone-independent effects on the ATPase activity of these proteins. 
The potential implications of these ABA-HSP70 interactions are discussed with 
respect to the intracellular protein folding and extracellular receptor-like 
activities of these stress-inducible proteins. While mechanistic and functional 
relevance remain enigmatic, we conclude that ABA can bind to human HSP70 family 
members with physiologically relevant affinities and in a co-chaperone-dependent 
manner.
