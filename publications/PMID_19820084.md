Lipoic acid is an essential cofactor required for the function of key metabolic 
pathways in most organisms. We report the characterization of a Bacillus 
subtilis mutant obtained by disruption of the lipA (yutB) gene, which encodes 
lipoyl synthase (LipA), the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the de novo 
biosynthesis of this cofactor. The function of lipA was inferred from the 
results of genetic and physiological experiments, and this study investigated 
its role in B. subtilis fatty acid metabolism. Interrupting lipoate-dependent 
reactions strongly inhibits growth in minimal medium, impairing the generation 
of branched-chain fatty acids and leading to accumulation of copious amounts of 
straight-chain saturated fatty acids in B. subtilis membranes. Although 
depletion of LipA induces the expression of the Delta5 desaturase, controlled by 
a two-component system that senses changes in membrane properties, the synthesis 
of unsaturated fatty acids is insufficient to support growth in the absence of 
precursors for branched-chain fatty acids. However, unsaturated fatty acids 
generated by deregulated overexpression of the Delta5 desaturase functionally 
replaces lipoic acid-dependent synthesis of branched-chain fatty acids. 
Furthermore, we show that the cold-sensitive phenotype of a B. subtilis strain 
deficient in Delta5 desaturase is suppressed by isoleucine only if LipA is 
present.
