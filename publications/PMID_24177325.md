OBJECTIVE: Vascular precursor cells with angiogenic potentials are important for 
tissue repair, which is impaired in diabetes mellitus. MicroRNAs are recently 
discovered key regulators of gene expression, but their role in vascular 
precursor cell-mediated angiogenesis in diabetes mellitus is unknown. We tested 
the hypothesis that the microRNA miR-27b rescues impaired bone marrow-derived 
angiogenic cell (BMAC) function in vitro and in vivo in type 2 diabetic mice.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: BMACs from adult male type 2 diabetic db/db and from 
normal littermate db/+ mice were used. miR-27b expression was decreased in db/db 
BMACs. miR-27b mimic improved db/db BMAC function, including proliferation, 
adhesion, tube formation, and delayed apoptosis, but it did not affect 
migration. Elevated thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) protein in db/db BMACs was 
suppressed on miR-27b mimic transfection. Inhibition of miR-27b in db/+ BMACs 
reduced angiogenesis, which was reversed by TSP-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). 
miR-27b suppressed the pro-oxidant protein p66(shc) and mitochondrial oxidative 
stress, contributing to its protection of BMAC function. miR-27b also suppressed 
semaphorin 6A to improve BMAC function in diabetes mellitus. Luciferase binding 
assay suggested that miR-27b directly targeted TSP-1, TSP-2, p66(shc), and 
semaphorin 6A. miR-27b improved topical cell therapy of diabetic BMACs on 
diabetic skin wound closure, with a concomitant augmentation of wound perfusion 
and capillary formation. Normal BMAC therapy with miR-27b inhibition 
demonstrated reduced efficacy in wound closure, perfusion, and capillary 
formation. Local miR-27b delivery partly improved wound healing in diabetic 
mice.
CONCLUSIONS: miR-27b rescues impaired BMAC angiogenesis via TSP-1 suppression, 
semaphorin 6A expression, and p66shc-dependent mitochondrial oxidative stress 
and improves BMAC therapy in wound healing in type 2 diabetic mice.

BMACs from adult male type 2 diabetic db/db and from normal littermate db/+ mice were used. miR-27b expression was decreased in db/db BMACs. miR-27b mimic improved db/db BMAC function, including proliferation, adhesion, tube formation, and delayed apoptosis, but it did not affect migration. Elevated thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) protein in db/db BMACs was suppressed on miR-27b mimic transfection. Inhibition of miR-27b in db/+ BMACs reduced angiogenesis, which was reversed by TSP-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). miR-27b suppressed the pro-oxidant protein p66 shc and mitochondrial oxidative stress, contributing to its protection of BMAC function. miR-27b also suppressed semaphorin 6A to improve BMAC function in diabetes mellitus. Luciferase binding assay suggested that miR-27b directly targeted TSP-1, TSP-2, p66 shc , and semaphorin 6A. miR-27b improved topical cell therapy of diabetic BMACs on diabetic skin wound closure, with a concomitant augmentation of wound perfusion and capillary formation. Normal BMAC therapy with miR-27b inhibition demonstrated reduced efficacy in wound closure, perfusion, and capillary formation. Local miR-27b delivery partly improved wound healing in diabetic mice.

Conclusions

miR-27b rescues impaired BMAC angiogenesis via TSP-1 suppression, semaphorin 6A expression, and p66shc-dependent mitochondrial oxidative stress and improves BMAC therapy in wound healing in type 2 diabetic mice.

Discussion

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that miR-27b rescues impaired BMAC angiogenesis and improves topical BMAC therapy on wound healing in type 2 diabetic mice. Our major findings are the following: decreased miR-27b expression is responsible for the functional loss of BMAC in diabetes mellitus; miR-27b protects BMAC function through ≥3 pathways, via suppression of the antiangiogenic molecules TSP-1 and Sema6A, and via suppression of p66 shc , thus suppressing mitochondrial oxidative stress; miR-27b improves the efficacy of diabetic BMAC therapy on wound closure, wound perfusion, and capillary formation; and direct miR-27b delivery partly determines wound closure and wound perfusion pattern.

In diabetic wounds, natural wound-healing processes are inadequate to prevent tissue ischemia and necrosis. One important reason is impaired angiogenesis. 24 Stem/progenitor cell therapy may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for such a problem. 25 However, outcomes from clinical investigations reveal limited efficacy of patient-derived EPC therapy in treating wounds, partly because of the concern that EPCs are reduced in number and impaired in function. 26 In our studies, diabetic BMAC therapy was less efficient in accelerating wound closure and promoting wound perfusion compared with normal BMAC therapy, suggesting that diabetic BMAC therapies per se may not fully compensate for impaired wound regeneration in diabetes mellitus. Therefore, intrinsic BMAC dysfunction needs to be corrected before BMACs are used for autologous therapy in treating diabetic complications.

Posttranscriptional miRNA gene regulation plays an essential role in angiogenesis. In this study, we found that miR-27b was decreased in angiogenic cells from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and from type 2 diabetic mice. Upregulation of miR-27b rescued diabetic BMAC tube formation, adhesion, and proliferation and delayed apoptosis, suggesting a pivotal role of miR-27b in BMAC function in diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, our data showed that 2 angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal cell–derived factor 1α, were upregulated on miR-27b mimic transfection in BMACs, indicating that miR-27b also enhanced BMAC paracrine functions. miRNA regulation is a complex network. miR-27 belongs to the miR-23/27/24 cluster. This cluster has been shown to be involved in angiogenesis and endothelial apoptosis in cardiac ischemia and retinal vascular development. 20 , 27 We detected miR-23a/b, miR-24, and other angiogenesis-related miRNAs in diabetic BMACs, such as let-7f, miR-221, and miR-222 ( Figure VI in the online-only Data Supplement ). miR-24 was elevated in diabetic BMACs, whereas other miRNAs showed no differences. miR-24 induces endothelial apoptosis and impairs angiogenesis in myocardial infarction. 28 It is possible that multiple miRNAs participate in 1 aspect of cell activity and that other miRNAs, such as miR-24, are involved in revascularization in diabetes mellitus.

In addition, we examined some major causal factors of the development of diabetic complications: high glucose and oxidative. 29 , 30 Normal BMACs were treated with high glucose (25 μmol/L for 7 days starting from day 0 of culture, using mannitol as controls) 29 or LY83583 (a ROS generator, 12 μmol/L for 24 hours starting from day 7 of culture) 30 using established protocols. miR-27b levels were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction after the treatment. Our results demonstrated that high glucose or LY83583 did not significantly alter mir-27b expression in BMACs (data not shown). Because these are artificial interventions and may not represent in vivo situations, future in vivo studies in human and animal models will be needed to verify what aspects of diabetes mellitus causes the downregulation of miR-27b.

miRNAs regulate cell activities by repressing their downstream targets. Our data indicated that miR-27b directly interacted with TSP-1 and TSP-2 mRNA, but the impact of miR-27b on TSP-1 expression was more drastic than that on TSP-2 expression. TSP-1 is a potent, endogenous, and detrimental factor to angiogenesis. 31 Increased TSP-1 levels have been reported in hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus. 32 In diabetes mellitus, increased TSP-1 essentially suppresses the angiogenic responses of multiple cell types to injury and ischemia. 33 Our results showed that diabetic BMACs expressed both enhanced mRNA ( Figure VII in the online-only Data Supplement ) and protein expression of TSP-1, which was significantly suppressed by miR-27b overexpression, indicating that miR-27b suppressed TSP-1 gene expression. Recent research revealed critical roles of the major receptor of TSP, CD47, in acute regulation of cardiovascular dynamics. 34 The TSP1-CD47 ligand receptor axis controls several important cellular processes, inhibiting survival factors such as NO, cGMP, cAMP, and vascular endothelial growth factor. 35 CD47 −/− BMACs showed much better tube formation and less reduction when stimulated by recombinant mouse TSP-1 compared with CD36 −/− BMACs. Western blot analysis suggested that CD47 −/− BMACs possessed higher activation of the Akt/endothelial NO synthase pathway compared with wild-type BMACs and CD36 −/− BMACs, suggesting that CD47 was the major receptor for TSP-1 in db/db BMACs.

Oxidative stress has been implicated in diabetes mellitus–related vascular damage. 36 All main molecular mechanisms seem to reflect the overproduction of superoxide by the mitochondrial electron-transport chain. 37 In our studies, miR-27b mimic suppressed mitochondrial ROS in diabetic BMACs, whereas miR-27b inhibitor increased mitochondrial ROS in normal BMACs, strongly suggesting that miR-27b is crucial for BMAC resistance to oxidative stress. p66 shc is a mammalian adaptor protein from the ShcA family. p66 shc−/− mice exhibit longer life spans compared with their wild-type littermates, with reduced intracellular ROS level and mitochondrial DNA alterations, indicating that p66 shc is a key component of the intracellular redox state. 38 , 39 In our study, diabetic BMACs possessed higher levels of p66 shc protein than normal BMACs, which were suppressed by miR-27b. p66 shc knockdown before miR-27b inhibition partly rescued BMAC proliferation and tube formation as mitochondrial ROS remained low. These data suggest that p66shc serves as an important target of miR-27b in its regulation of redox status in BMACs, which is critical for BMAC angiogenesis. In addition, we found that manganese superoxide dismutase, but not copper/zinc superoxide dismutase or catalase, was increased on miR-27b mimic transfection, further supporting the regulatory role of miR-27b in mitochondrial redox homeostasis.

Sema6A and Sprouty 2 were reported as direct targets of miR-27. 19 , 20 Sema6A is transmembrane axonal guidance protein with many unexplained functional aspects. 40 We observed that Sema6A, but not Sprouty 2, was elevated in diabetes mellitus and suppressed by miR-27b, although miR-27b was bound with both of their mRNA 3′UTRs. Knocking down Sema6A significantly reversed the detrimental effects of miR-27b inhibition on BMAC function, suggesting that Sema6A is one of the miR-27b target molecules in diabetes mellitus. In addition to these 2 molecules, miR-27b has been reported to target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ to regulate adipogenesis and target Sema6A in ECs. 14 miR-27b was also shown to target the Notch ligand Delta-like ligand 4 and Sprouty 2, and to promote venous differentiation in zebrafish. 41 miR-27b may have targeted other molecules involved in angiogenesis and in other cell activities. Specifying each potential target and downstream pathway is interesting and requires future work.

To test the impact of miR-27b on BMAC function in vivo, we used these miR-27b–manipulated BMACs as cell therapy for tissue repair. Our data demonstrated that miR-27b mimic significantly improved the efficacy of db/db BMAC therapy on wound closure and perfusion. CD31 staining indicated an increase in capillary formation on db/db miR-27b mimic –treated BMACs. In contrast, db/+ miR-27b inhibitor -BMAC therapy demonstrated poor efficacy in improving diabetic wounds and decreased wound capillary formation compared with db/+ BMAC therapy. These results suggest that miR-27b is essential for BMACs to function in tissue regeneration. Histological analysis of wounds that received BrdU-labeled BMACs suggested continued existence of donor cells in the wound area. The majority of cells were incorporated into the wound vasculature. In vivo wound healing is a situation in which multiple cellular and molecular components participate in skin structure regeneration. It becomes very difficult to trace the effects of BMAC-derived molecules. However, our in vivo findings are exciting because if modifying cell function by manipulating a single miRNA before transplantation would help to improve wound healing, then autologous cell transplantation in patients with diabetes mellitus may possibly gain favorable efficacy via manipulating ≥2 proangiogenic miRNAs.

We also questioned whether direct delivery of miR-27b can achieve better or at least equal efficacy in diabetic wounds. First, we found that basal miR-27b expression was reduced in diabetic mice and that it was not elevated as in normal mice on wounding. miR-27b overexpression partly accelerated wound healing and increased wound blood flow, whereas miR-27b inhibition significantly delayed normal wound healing. Direct miRNA transfection affects all cell types within the wound area, including keratinocytes. Hildebrand et al 42 observed that miR-27b is 1 of 10 miRNAs associated with human keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo. miR-27b was upregulated in neonatal epidermal keratinocytes and in terminal skin keratinocytes. We tested the effects of miR-27b on keratinocyte functions, including migration, proliferation, and apoptosis ( Figure VIII in the online-only Data Supplement ). Our results demonstrated that miR-27b improved keratinoctye migration and that miR-27b inhibition increased keratinocyte apoptosis and mitochondrial ROS, whereas miR-27b overexpression decreased mitochondrial ROS. Based on these observations, it is thought that miR-27b also directly benefits keratinocyte functions and regulates keratinocyte oxidative stress.

In conclusion, our study suggests that miR-27b rescued impaired BMAC angiogenic function in type 2 diabetic mice, partly via repressing the antiangiogenic molecules TSP-1 and Sema6A, as well as pro-oxidant protein p66 shc ( Figure 8 ). miR-27b gene therapy enhances the efficacy of diabetic angiogenic cells for wound angiogenesis and wound repair in diabetic mice. Understanding the mechanisms by which genes and pathways are regulated by angiogenic cell–expressed miRNAs is a great challenge, but it provides important mechanistic insights into complex regulatory networks underlying biological processes in angiogenesis.
