MDM2 is a multidomain protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, 
transcription repressor, mRNA-binding protein, translation factor, and molecular 
chaperone. The small molecule Nutlin-3 has been engineered to bind to the 
N-terminal hydrophobic pocket domain of MDM2. This binding of Nutlin-3 has two 
consequences: (i) antagonistic effects through competitive disruption of the 
MDM2-p53 complex and (ii) agonist effects that allosterically stabilize MDM2 
protein-protein interactions that increase p53 ubiquitination as well as 
nucleophosmin deoligomerization. We present a methodology using a 
hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange platform that measures Nutlin-3 binding to the 
N-terminal domain of MDM2 (MDM2(1-126)) in order to begin to develop dynamic 
assays that evaluate MDM2 allostery. In order to localize the regions in MDM2 
being suppressed by Nutlin-3, MDM2 was incubated with the ligand and H/D amide 
exchange was measured after pepsin digestion. One dynamic segment containing 
amino acids 55-60 exhibited slower deuterium exchange after Nutlin-3 binding, 
reflecting ligand binding within the hydrophobic pocket. However, another 
dominant suppression of H/D exchange was observed in a motif from amino acids 
103-107 that reflects surface hydrophobic residues surrounding the hydrophobic 
pocket of MDM2. In order to explore the consequences of this latter Nutlin-3 
interaction site on MDM2, the Y104G and L107G mutant series was constructed. The 
MDM2(Y104G) and MDM2(L107G) mutants were fully active in p53 binding. However, 
the authentic p53-derived peptide:MDM2(Y104G) complex exhibited partial 
resistance to Nutlin-3 inhibition, while the p53-mimetic 12.1 
peptide:MDM2(Y104G) complex retained normal Nutlin-3 responsiveness. These data 
reveal the existence of a second functional Nutlin-3-binding site in a surface 
hydrophobic patch of MDM2, flanking the hydrophobic pocket. This reveals two 
modes of peptide binding by MDM2 and highlights the utility of H/D exchange as 
an assay for measuring allosteric effects in MDM2.
