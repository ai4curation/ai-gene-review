The GroEL/GroES chaperonin system mediates protein folding in the bacterial 
cytosol. Newly synthesized proteins reach GroEL via transfer from upstream 
chaperones such as DnaK/DnaJ (Hsp70). Here we employed single molecule and 
ensemble FRET to monitor the conformational transitions of a model substrate as 
it proceeds along this chaperone pathway. We find that DnaK/DnaJ stabilizes the 
protein in collapsed states that fold exceedingly slowly. Transfer to GroEL 
results in unfolding, with a fraction of molecules reaching locally highly 
expanded conformations. ATP-induced domain movements in GroEL cause transient 
further unfolding and rapid mobilization of protein segments with moderate 
hydrophobicity, allowing partial compaction on the GroEL surface. The more 
hydrophobic regions are released upon subsequent protein encapsulation in the 
central GroEL cavity by GroES, completing compaction and allowing rapid folding. 
Segmental chain release and compaction may be important in avoiding misfolding 
by proteins that fail to fold efficiently through spontaneous hydrophobic 
collapse.
