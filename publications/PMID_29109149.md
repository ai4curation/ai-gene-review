Oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses are hallmarks of the 
pathophysiology of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. In these stresses, 
different kinases phosphorylate eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2α, enabling the 
translation of stress response genes; among these is GADD34, the protein product 
of which recruits the α-isoform of protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit 
(PP1α) and eIF2α to assemble a phosphatase complex catalyzing eIF2α 
dephosphorylation and resumption of protein synthesis. Aberrations in this 
pathway underlie the aforementioned disorders. Previous observations indicating 
that GADD34 is induced by arsenite, a thiol-directed oxidative stressor, in the 
absence of eIF2α phosphorylation suggest other roles for GADD34. Here, we report 
that arsenite-induced oxidative stress differs from thapsigargin- or 
tunicamycin-induced ER stress in promoting GADD34 transcription and the 
preferential translation of its mRNA in the absence of eIF2α phosphorylation. 
Arsenite also stabilized GADD34 protein, slowing its degradation. In response to 
oxidative stress, but not ER stress, GADD34 recruited TDP-43, and enhanced 
cytoplasmic distribution and cysteine modifications of TDP-43 promoted its 
binding to GADD34. Arsenite also recruited a TDP-43 kinase, casein kinase-1ϵ 
(CK1ϵ), to GADD34. Concomitant with TDP-43 aggregation and proteolysis after 
prolonged arsenite exposure, GADD34-bound CK1ϵ catalyzed TDP-43 phosphorylations 
at serines 409/410, which were diminished or absent in GADD34-/- cells. Our 
findings highlight that the phosphatase regulator, GADD34, also functions as a 
kinase scaffold in response to chronic oxidative stress and recruits CK1ϵ and 
oxidized TDP-43 to facilitate its phosphorylation, as seen in TDP-43 
proteinopathies.
