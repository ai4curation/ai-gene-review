Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a rare heart disease characterized by 
diastolic dysfunction and atrial enlargement. The genetic etiology of RCM is not 
completely known. We identified by a next-generation sequencing panel the novel 
CRYAB missense mutation c.326A>G, p.D109G in a small family with RCM in 
combination with skeletal myopathy with an early onset of the disease. CRYAB 
encodes αB-crystallin, a member of the small heat shock protein family, which is 
highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle. In addition to in silico 
prediction analysis, our structural analysis of explanted myocardial tissue of a 
mutation carrier as well as in vitro cell transfection experiments revealed 
abnormal protein aggregation of mutant αB-crystallin and desmin, supporting the 
deleterious effect of this novel mutation. In conclusion, CRYAB appears to be a 
novel RCM gene, which might have relevance for the molecular diagnosis and the 
genetic counseling of further affected families in the future.
