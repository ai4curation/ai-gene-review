Changes in chromatin structure have frequently been correlated with changes in 
transcription. However, the cause-and-effect relationship between chromatin 
structure and transcription has been hard to determine. In addition, identifying 
the proteins that regulate chromatin structure has been difficult. Recent 
evidence suggests that a functionally related set of yeast transcriptional 
activators (SNF2/SWI2, SNF5, SNF6, SWI1, and SWI3), required for transcription 
of a diverse set of genes, may affect chromatin structure. We now present 
genetic and molecular evidence that at least two of these transcriptional 
activators, SNF2/SWI2 and SNF5, function by antagonizing repression mediated by 
nucleosomes. First, the transcriptional defects in strains lacking these SNF 
genes are suppressed by a deletion of one of the two sets of genes encoding 
histones H2A and H2B, (hta1-htb1) delta. Second, at one affected promoter 
(SUC2), chromatin structure is altered in snf2/swi2 and snf5 mutants, and this 
chromatin defect is suppressed by (hta1-htb1) delta. Finally, analysis of 
chromatin structure at a mutant SUC2 promoter, in which the TATA box has been 
destroyed, demonstrates that the differences in SUC2 chromatin structure between 
SNF5+ and snf5 mutant strains are not simply an effect of different levels of 
SUC2 transcription. Thus, these results strongly suggest that SNF2/SWI2 and SNF5 
cause changes in chromatin structure and that these changes allow 
transcriptional activation.
