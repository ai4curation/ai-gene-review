Adopting fluorescence of PPIX enhanced by a split G-quadruplex and toehold 
mediated strand displacement reaction, a series of unlabeled fluorescent logic 
gates is set up and some of them are cascaded into circuits. Controlled release 
of PPIX, which is also a photosensitizer in photodynamic diagnosis and therapy, 
is realized by this circuit, making it a wise choice for DNA computing.
