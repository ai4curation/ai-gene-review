Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
an N-terminal expansion of polyglutamine stretch (polyQ) of huntingtin (Htt) 
protein. HAP40 is a huntingtin-associated protein with unknown cellular 
functions. Increased HAP40 expression has been reported in the brain of HD 
patients and HD mouse model. However, the relationship between the elevation of 
HAP40 and HD etiology remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that 
overexpression of HAP40 enhanced accumulation of mutant Htt aggregates and 
caused defects in proteasome function. Specifically, excess HAP40 interfered 
with adhesion-regulating molecule 1 (ADRM1), a proteasome ubiquitin receptor, to 
regulate the proteasome-dependent pathway. Increasing ADRM1 in the presence of 
excess HAP40 alleviated mutant Htt aggregates and at the same time, restored the 
cell viability. Reducing ADRM1 in the absence of excess HAP40; on the other 
hand, increased mutant Htt aggregates and decreased the cell viability. Our data 
provide compelling evidence to support that ADRM1 plays an important role in 
mediating removal of mutant Htt aggregates when excess HAP40 is present. 
ADRM1-dependent ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) may be a general mechanism to 
guard cells from mutant Htt toxicity.
