Sigma28 controls the expression of flagella-related genes and is the most widely 
distributed alternative sigma factor, present in motile Gram-positive and 
Gram-negative bacteria. The distinguishing feature of sigma28 promoters is a 
long -10 region (GCCGATAA). Despite the fact that the upstream GC is highly 
conserved, previous studies have not indicated a functional role for this motif. 
Here we examine the functional relevance of the GCCG motif and determine which 
residues in sigma28 participate in its recognition. We find that the GCCG motif 
is a functionally important composite element. The upstream GC constitutes an 
extended -10 motif and is recognized by R91, a residue in Domain 3 of sigma28. 
The downstream CG is the upstream edge of -10 region of the promoter; two 
residues in Region 2.4, D81 and R84, participate in its recognition. Consistent 
with their role in base-specific recognition of the promoter, R91, D81 and D84 
are universally conserved in sigma28 orthologues. Sigma28 is the second Group 3 
sigma shown to use an extended -10 region in promoter recognition, raising the 
possibility that other Group 3 sigmas will do so as well.
