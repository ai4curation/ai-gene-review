Homeostasis of Smad phosphorylation at its C-terminal SXS motif is essential for 
transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling. Whereas it is known that 
TGFbeta signaling can be terminated by phosphatases, which dephosphorylate 
R-Smads in the nucleus, it is unclear whether there are any cytoplasmic 
phosphatase(s) that can attenuate R-Smad phosphorylation and nuclear 
translocation. Here we demonstrate that myotubularin-related protein 4 (MTMR4), 
a FYVE domain-containing dual-specificity protein phosphatase (DSP), attenuates 
TGFbeta signaling by reducing the phosphorylation level of R-Smads in early 
endosomes. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that endogenous MTMR4 
interacts with phosphorylated R-Smads, and that this interaction is correlated 
with dephosphorylation of R-Smads. Further analysis showed that overexpression 
of MTMR4 resulted in the sequestration of activated Smad3 in the early 
endosomes, thus reducing its nuclear translocation. However, both point 
mutations at the conserved catalytic site of the phosphatase (MTMR4-C407S) and 
small interference RNA of endogenous Mtmr4 expression led to sustained Smad3 
activation. This work therefore suggests that MTMR4 plays an important role in 
preventing the overactivation of TGFbeta signaling by dephosphorylating 
activated R-Smads that have been trafficked to early endosomes.
