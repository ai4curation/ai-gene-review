The Arabidopsis NPR1 protein is a key regulator of salicylic acid (SA)-mediated 
gene expression in systemic acquired resistance. Based on yeast two-hybrid 
analysis, NPR1 has been suggested to interact with members of the TGA family of 
transcription factors, including TGA2 (AHBP-1b). However, genetic evidence 
demonstrating that the NPR1-TGA interaction occurs in planta is still lacking, 
and the role of this interaction in SA-mediated gene activation has yet to be 
determined. In this study, we expressed a truncated form of TGA2 in Arabidopsis 
and found that the resulting transgenic lines displayed phenotypes similar to 
those of npr1 mutants. This dominant-negative effect of the TGA2 mutant shows 
that TGA2 and NPR1 interact in planta. We also present biochemical evidence 
indicating that this interaction is specific and enhanced by SA treatment. 
Moreover, using a chimera reporter system, we found that a chimeric TGA2GAL4 
transcription factor activated a UAS(GAL)::GUS reporter gene in response to SA 
and that this activation was abolished in the npr1 mutant. NPR1 is required for 
the DNA binding activity of the transcription factor. These genetic data clearly 
demonstrate that TGA2 is a SA-responsive and NPR1-dependent transcription 
activator.

Abstract

The Arabidopsis NPR1 protein is a key regulator of salicylic acid (SA)–mediated gene expression in systemic acquired resistance. Based on yeast two-hybrid analysis, NPR1 has been suggested to interact with members of the TGA family of transcription factors, including TGA2 (AHBP-1b). However, genetic evidence demonstrating that the NPR1–TGA interaction occurs in planta is still lacking, and the role of this interaction in SA-mediated gene activation has yet to be determined. In this study, we expressed a truncated form of TGA2 in Arabidopsis and found that the resulting transgenic lines displayed phenotypes similar to those of npr1 mutants. This dominant-negative effect of the TGA2 mutant shows that TGA2 and NPR1 interact in planta. We also present biochemical evidence indicating that this interaction is specific and enhanced by SA treatment. Moreover, using a chimera reporter system, we found that a chimeric TGA2GAL4 transcription factor activated a UAS GAL :: GUS reporter gene in response to SA and that this activation was abolished in the npr1 mutant. NPR1 is required for the DNA binding activity of the transcription factor. These genetic data clearly demonstrate that TGA2 is a SA-responsive and NPR1-dependent transcription activator.

INTRODUCTION

Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a plant defense response induced after a local hypersensitive response to avirulent pathogens or by treatment with signal molecules such as salicylic acid (SA), 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA), and benzothiadiazole ( Ryals et al., 1996 ). Induction of SAR involves the activation of many pathogenesis-related ( PR ) genes, which function in concert to confer resistance against a broad spectrum of pathogens ( Ward et al., 1991 ; Uknes et al., 1992 ). The signal transduction pathway leading to SAR has been studied using both genetic and molecular approaches. The Arabidopsis npr1 (nonexpresser of PR genes) mutants (also known as nim1 and sai1 ) ( Cao et al., 1994 ; Delaney et al., 1995 ; Glazebrook et al., 1996 ; Shah et al., 1997 ) were identified by their loss of PR gene induction and disease resistance under SAR-activating conditions.

The positive role of NPR1 in SAR, suggested by the phenotype of these recessive npr1 mutants, was further demonstrated by overexpression experiments. Overexpression of the NPR1 gene in Arabidopsis and rice rendered the transgenic plants more resistant to various pathogens in the absence of a SAR inducer or after treatment with lower-than-normal concentrations of the inducer ( Cao et al., 1998 ; Chern et al., 2001 ; Friedrich et al., 2001 ). Interestingly, overexpression of NPR1 did not result in constitutive PR gene expression before pathogen challenge, indicating that the NPR1 protein requires activation, perhaps by SA, to be functional in PR gene activation. The derived amino acid sequence of the NPR1 protein ( Cao et al., 1997 ; Ryals et al., 1997 ) has provided some hints about its molecular function.

A bipartite nuclear localization sequence at the carboxyl end of NPR1 mediates its nuclear localization, which is required for the induction of PR genes ( Kinkema et al., 2000 ). NPR1 also contains two protein–protein interaction domains: a BTB/POZ domain ( Aravind and Koonin, 1999 ) at the N-terminal end and an ankyrin-repeat domain (ARD) in the center of the protein ( Cao et al., 1997 ). Although many proteins contain either BTB/POZ or ARD domains, NPR1 belongs to a unique family of proteins that carry both domains. The functional importance of these protein–protein interaction domains is highlighted by the various npr1 mutants identified with amino acid changes in the consensus of these domains ( Cao et al., 1997 ; Ryals et al., 1997 ).

The presence of two protein–protein interaction domains but the lack of a DNA binding domain suggest that NPR1 may exert its regulatory role in PR gene expression through interaction with transcription factors. Indeed, using yeast two-hybrid screens, we and others found that NPR1 interacts with the TGA subclass of basic Leu zipper (bZIP) transcription factors ( Zhang et al., 1999 ; Després et al., 2000 ; Niggeweg et al., 2000b ; Zhou et al., 2000 ; Chern et al., 2001 ), suggesting that TGA factors could be the missing link between NPR1 and its target genes. This notion is supported by several studies in which the binding sites for TGA transcription factors (e.g., the as-1 element) in PR gene promoters were found to be responsible for SA-mediated gene induction ( Qin et al., 1994 ; Shah and Klessig, 1996 ; Lebel et al., 1998 ).

Although the seven known Arabidopsis TGA transcription factors have high degrees of amino acid sequence identity and similarity, they have different affinities toward NPR1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay, with TGA2 (first known as AHBP-1b), TGA3, and TGA6 showing the strongest binding ( Zhang et al., 1999 ; Després et al., 2000 ; Niggeweg et al., 2000b ; Zhou et al., 2000 ). The TGA factors also differ in their binding affinity and specificity to the as-1 element ( Miao et al., 1994 ; Lam and Lam, 1995 ; Xiang et al., 1997 ). These results suggest that some TGA factors may have redundant or overlapping functions, whereas others may play different roles in regulating genes in plant defense and other biological processes. Moreover, TGA factors can form homodimers and heterodimers through their highly conserved bZIP domains, further enhancing the versatility of these transcription factors ( Foster et al., 1994 ; Lam and Lam, 1995 ).

However, these characteristics make it difficult to define the function of any specific TGA factor. Indeed, examination of Arabidopsis mutants in the TGA2 , TGA3 , and TGA6 genes have yet to reveal a detectable phenotype (M. Kesarwani and X. Dong, unpublished data), suggesting that these NPR1-interacting TGA factors are at least partially redundant in function. In addition to the TGA knockout mutants, trans -dominant TGA mutants compromised in their ability to bind to the as-1 element have been created and characterized in tobacco. Transgenic plants overexpressing these TGA mutants showed different phenotypes. In one study, overexpression of a tobacco TGA2.2 mutant (a homolog of Arabidopsis TGA2 ) diminished SA- and auxin-inducible PR gene induction ( Niggeweg et al., 2000a ). In another study, in which an Arabidopsis TGA2 mutant was overexpressed, PR gene induction was enhanced further ( Pontier et al., 2001 ).

Because both mutants used in these studies were defective only in the basic domain involved in DNA binding, they could interact not only with NPR1 but also with other TGA factors. The complexity of the interactions made it difficult to determine the exact cause of the observed phenotypes and to define the specific functions of these TGA transcription factors. Therefore, genetic evidence demonstrating that the NPR1–TGA interaction occurs in planta is still lacking, and the role of this interaction in SA-mediated gene activation has yet to be established.

In this study, we present both genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrating that TGA2 and NPR1 interact specifically in planta and that this interaction is enhanced by SA treatment. Moreover, we provide clear evidence showing that TGA2 is a SA-responsive and NPR1-dependent transcription activator. Based on these new findings, a working model is proposed to explain the molecular mechanism by which NPR1 regulates SAR-related gene expression.

DISCUSSION

TGA2 and other members of the TGA family of bZIP transcription factors, such as TGA3, OBF5, and TGA6, have been shown to interact with NPR1 by several independent yeast two-hybrid screens ( Zhang et al., 1999 ; Després et al., 2000 ; Niggeweg et al., 2000b ; Zhou et al., 2000 ; Chern et al., 2001 ). However, as a result of the artificial nature of the yeast two-hybrid system, it was unclear whether the TGA factors interact with NPR1 in planta and whether they take part in the SAR signaling pathway. It is difficult to use knockout mutants to study these highly conserved transcription factors, because they may have redundant or overlapping transcriptional activities. To remedy this problem, we used a dominant-negative mutant and a chimera reporter system to study the function of a specific TGA factor, TGA2. We chose to focus on the properties of TGA2 because it is one of the strong NPR1 interactors identified in the yeast two-hybrid screens ( Zhang et al., 1999 ; Després et al., 2000 ; Zhou et al., 2000 ) as well as the major component of the as-1 binding activity in Arabidopsis ( Lam and Lam, 1995 ).

To detect the TGA2–NPR1 interaction in planta, we cloned the CT domain–coding region of TGA2 under the control the 35S promoter and expressed the resulting 35S :: TGA2CT gene in wild-type plants. We found that the accumulation of TGA2CT resulted in dosage-dependent phenotypes that resembled those of the npr1 mutants. We showed that this dominant-negative effect of TGA2CT was attributable to in planta complex formation between TGA2CT and NPR1; disruption of this complex formation in the npr1-2 mutant abolished the dominant-negative effect. Copurification experiments showed that formation of the TGA2CT-NPR1 complex did not require the presence of SA but was enhanced by it.

This finding was consistent with the results of a recent study using a transient expression system in tobacco and tomato protoplasts ( Subramaniam et al., 2001 ). The mechanism by which SA enhances NPR1-TGA2 complex formation is unknown. SA may enhance the affinity of the NPR1–TGA2 interaction or increase the availability of NPR1 for TGA2 binding. In a previous experiment, we found that SA treatment increased the distribution of NPR1 protein to the nuclear fraction in which the TGA transcription factors reside ( Kinkema et al., 2000 ). It also is possible that SA releases NPR1 from an inhibitory complex, allowing it to bind TGA2.

The TGA2GAL4/UAS GAL :: GUS chimera reporter system was created to make in planta observations of TGA2 transcriptional activity during SAR induction. Our data clearly demonstrate that TGA2 is a transcription activator and that its activity requires the presence of SA and a functional NPR1. GMSAs showed that SA and NPR1 both are required for the DNA binding activity of TGA2. This is consistent with previous findings that SA treatment causes an increase in as-1 binding activity in protein extracts ( Jupin and Chua, 1996 ; Stange et al., 1997 ; Després et al., 2000 ) and that NPR1 could enhance TGA2 binding to the as-1 element in vitro ( Després et al., 2000 ). Our results now show that changes in the DNA binding of TGA2 result in transcriptional activation in planta.

The TGA2 transcription factor alone is sufficient for SA-responsive, NPR1-dependent gene expression. The CT domain of TGA2 interacts with NPR1 to transduce the SA signal, resulting in enhanced affinity of the bZIP domain for DNA. The transactivation activity of TGA2 seems to reside in the NT domain of the protein, as is the case for the tobacco TGA1a transcription factor ( Johnson et al., 2001 ). When this domain was deleted from TGA2GAL4, the resulting transcription factor no longer activated the UAS GAL :: GUS reporter, even though it still bound NPR1 (data not shown). It remains to be determined whether the NT domain alone is sufficient for TGA2 transactivation activity.

The chimera reporter system generated in this study allowed us to overcome the problem caused by functional redundancy among the TGA transcription factors and effectively determine the regulatory role of the TGA2 transcription factor in SAR-related gene expression. All TGA factors have the potential to bind to the as-1 element; thus, GMSA is unable to distinguish the binding activity of different TGA factors. Moreover, DNA binding does not necessarily result in transcription activation. In a GMSA conducted by Després et al. (2000) using endogenous TGA factors, an increase in as-1 binding activity was observed in the SAR-induced sample. Surprisingly, when extracts made from an npr1 mutant were used, constitutive as-1 binding activity was detected ( Després et al., 2000 ).

These results indicate that under noninducing conditions, wild-type NPR1 may sequester some TGA factors (e.g., TGA2) from binding to the as-1 element through its association with these transcription factors. In the npr1 mutant, the NPR1–TGA interaction is inhibited; therefore, more TGA factors can bind to the as-1 element. Obviously, in the absence of a functional NPR1, this constitutive as-1 binding activity does not lead to transcription activation.

The endogenous PR gene promoters contain both positive and negative regulatory elements ( Lebel et al., 1998 ). Therefore, regulation of these promoters is certainly more complex than that of the UAS GAL :: GUS reporter. When the bacterial pathogen P. syringae pv maculicola ES4326 was used to infect transgenic plants carrying the chimera reporter system, little UAS GAL :: GUS induction was observed (data not shown). The same pathogen infection can cause a significant induction of endogenous PR genes and BGL2 :: GUS ( Bowling et al., 1994 ; Cao et al., 1994 ). This finding indicates that other promoter elements besides as-1 , or other transcription factors in addition to TGA2, are important for enhancing the sensitivity of the PR genes to induction. In addition to positive regulators, PR gene expression also is modulated by negative regulators. We found that a loss-of-function mutation in a SAR-suppressor gene, SNI1 , resulted in increased levels of background PR gene expression and suppression of the npr1 mutant phenotype ( Li et al., 1999 ).

The results of this study place TGA2 solidly in the SAR signaling pathway. However, the target genes for TGA2 have yet to be identified. The binding sites for the TGA factors exist in many genes, responding to diverse signals in pathogen defense, wounding, and xenobiotic stresses ( Xiang et al., 1996 ; Pascuzzi et al., 1998 ; Chen and Singh, 1999 ). In tobacco, TGA1a is involved in regulating several auxin-induced glutathione S -transferase genes such as GNT1 and GNT35 ( Pascuzzi et al., 1998 ; Johnson et al., 2001 ). In contrast, Arabidopsis TGA2 responds only to the SAR inducers INA and SA but not to any of the xenobiotic stresses tested. TGA2 and TGA1a differ in their interacting proteins, with TGA2 binding to NPR1, a positive transcriptional regulator, and TGA1a associating with a negative transcriptional regulator, p120 ( Johnson et al., 2001 ). It is evident from these studies that the specific activity of a TGA factor is determined or modified by its interacting protein. In the case of TGA2, interaction with NPR1 enables it to activate SA-responsive gene expression. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that TGA2 functions as a repressor when it is associated with other TGA factors or regulators.

To summarize our current understanding of the regulatory mechanism of TGA2 in SAR-related gene expression, we propose the model shown in Figure 6 . In wild-type plants, NPR1 forms complexes with TGA2 and other TGA factors. Under noninducing conditions, these complexes are unable to bind to DNA. Upon SAR induction, more NPR1 becomes available to form the NPR1-TGA2 complex. Through an unknown mechanism, NPR1 enhances the DNA binding activity of TGA2, leading to PR gene induction ( Figure 6A ). In an npr1 mutant ( Figure 6B ), the NPR1–TGA2 interaction is disrupted; thus, TGA2 cannot bind to DNA. However, some TGA factors other than TGA2 may be able to bind to DNA in the absence of NPR1, as observed by Després et al. (2000) , but they are not active in inducing PR gene expression. This hypothesis can be tested by applying the chimera reporter system described in this work to other members of the TGA transcription factor family.
