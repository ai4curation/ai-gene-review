gamma-Secretase is involved in the production of amyloid beta-peptide, which is 
the principal component of amyloid plaques in the brains of patients with 
Alzheimer disease. gamma-Secretase is a complex composed of presenilin (PS), 
nicastrin, anterior pharynx-defective phenotype 1 (Aph1) and PS enhancer 2 
(Pen2). We previously proposed a mechanism of complex assembly by which 
unassembled subunits are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and only the 
fully assembled complex is exported from the ER. We have now identified 
Retention in endoplasmic reticulum 1 (Rer1) as a protein that is involved in the 
retention/retrieval of unassembled Pen2 to the ER. Direct binding of unassembled 
Pen2 to Rer1 is mediated by the first transmembrane domain of Pen2, and a 
conserved asparagine in this domain is required. Downregulation of Rer1 leads to 
increased surface localization of Pen2, whereas overexpression of Rer1 
stabilizes unassembled Pen2. To our knowledge, Rer1 is the first identified 
interaction partner of mammalian transmembrane-based retention/retrieval 
signals.
