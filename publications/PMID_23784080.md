Telomerase activity in cancer cells is dependent on the transcriptional 
regulation of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene, encoding 
the catalytic subunit of human telomerase. We have shown previously that HTLV-1 
basic leucine zipper (HBZ), a viral regulatory protein encoded by the human 
retrovirus, human T-cell leukemia virus, type 1 (HTLV-1) cooperates with JunD to 
enhance hTERT transcription in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells. Menin, the 
product of the tumor-suppressor MEN-1 gene, also interacts with JunD, represses 
its transcriptional activity and downregulates telomerase expression. The main 
objective of this study was to examine how menin and HBZ get involved in the 
regulation of hTERT transcription. In this study, we report that JunD and menin 
form a repressor complex of hTERT transcription in HBZ-negative cells. 
Conversely, in HBZ-positive cells, the formation of a JunD/HBZ/menin ternary 
complex and the recruitment of p300 histone acetyl transferase activity by HBZ 
lead to a decreased activity of the JunD-menin suppressor unit that correlates 
with the activation of hTERT transcription. Silencing HBZ or menin expression in 
ATL cells confirms that these proteins are differentially involved in telomerase 
regulation. These results propose that HBZ, by impeding the tumor-suppressor 
activity of menin, functions as a leukemogenic cofactor to upregulate gene 
transcription and promote JunD-mediated leukemogenesis.
