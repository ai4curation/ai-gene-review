The stability of wild-type p53 is critical for its apoptotic function. In some 
cancers, wild-type p53 is inactivated by interaction with viral and cellular 
proteins, and restoration of its activity has therapeutic potential. Here, we 
identify homeobox Msx1 as a p53-interacting protein and show its novel function 
as a p53 regulator. Overexpression of homeobox Msx1 induced apoptosis of cancer 
cells harboring nonfunctional wild-type p53 and suppressed growth of human tumor 
xenografts in nude mice. The homeodomain of Msx1 functions as a protein-protein 
interacting motif rather than a DNA-binding domain and is essential for 
stabilization, nuclear accumulation, and apoptotic function of wild-type p53. 
The identification of a novel function of Msx1 as a p53 regulator may open new 
avenues for developing improved molecular therapies for tumors with a 
nonmutational p53 inactivation mechanism.
