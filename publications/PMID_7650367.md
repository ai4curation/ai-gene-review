Bcl-2, bcl-x, and bax genes code for proteins that affect the susceptibility of 
cells to apoptosis. In general, the expression of bcl-2 or bcl-x inhibits 
apoptosis while bax promotes apoptosis. We examined the levels of these proteins 
by immunoblotting in resting and activated T cells and in thymocytes. Bcl-2 and 
Bax proteins vary coordinately, but Bcl-x varies independently: Bcl-2 and Bax 
are higher in splenic T cells than in thymocytes, and their levels increase even 
more after T cell activation. In contrast, Bcl-x is almost undetectable in 
splenic T cells but is manyfold greater in thymocytes and in activated splenic T 
cells. When CTLL-2 cells or activated T cells are starved of IL (IL-2), the 
level of Bcl-x but not Bcl-2 protein drops before the onset of apoptosis. Stable 
transfection of either bcl-2 or bcl-x expression plasmids promotes the survival 
of CTLL-2 cells in the setting of IL-2 withdrawal. Over 70 to 90% of the 
transfected cells remain viable at 48 h after IL-2 withdrawal when all of the 
control transfected cells are apoptotic. These findings suggest that a decrease 
in Bcl-x protein levels precedes apoptosis after IL-2 withdrawal in T cells and 
that transfected bcl-2 promotes survival after IL-2 withdrawal by functionally 
masking this drop in Bcl-x.
