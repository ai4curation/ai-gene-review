The U2AF-homology motif (UHM) mediates protein-protein interactions between 
factors involved in constitutive RNA splicing. Here we report that the splicing 
factor SPF45 regulates alternative splicing of the apoptosis regulatory gene FAS 
(also called CD95). The SPF45 UHM is necessary for this activity and binds 
UHM-ligand motifs (ULMs) present in the 3' splice site-recognizing factors 
U2AF65, SF1 and SF3b155. We describe a 2.1-A crystal structure of SPF45-UHM in 
complex with a ULM peptide from SF3b155. Features distinct from those of 
previously described UHM-ULM structures allowed the design of mutations in the 
SPF45 UHM that selectively impair binding to individual ULMs. Splicing assays 
using the ULM-selective SPF45 variants demonstrate that individual UHM-ULM 
interactions are required for FAS splicing regulation by SPF45 in vivo. Our data 
suggest that networks of UHM-ULM interactions are involved in regulating 
alternative splicing.
