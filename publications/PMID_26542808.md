The heterotetrameric (ϵ-β4-μ4-σ4) complex adaptor protein 4 (AP-4) is a 
component of a non-clathrin coat involved in protein sorting at the trans-Golgi 
network (TGN). Considerable interest in this complex has arisen from the recent 
discovery that mutations in each of its four subunits are the cause of a 
congenital intellectual disability and movement disorder in humans. Despite its 
physiological importance, the structure and function of this coat remain poorly 
understood. To investigate the assembly of the AP-4 coat, we dissected the 
determinants of interaction of AP-4 with its only known accessory protein, the 
ENTH/VHS-domain-containing protein tepsin. Using a variety of protein 
interaction assays, we found that tepsin comprises two phylogenetically 
conserved peptide motifs, [GS]LFXG[ML]X[LV] and S[AV]F[SA]FLN, within its 
C-terminal unstructured region, which interact with the C-terminal ear (or 
appendage) domains of the β4 and ϵ subunits of AP-4, respectively. 
Structure-based mutational analyses mapped the binding site for the 
[GS]LFXG[ML]X[LV] motif to a conserved, hydrophobic surface on the β4-ear 
platform fold. Both peptide-ear interactions are required for efficient 
association of tepsin with AP-4, and for recruitment of tepsin to the TGN. The 
bivalency of the interactions increases the avidity of tepsin for AP-4 and may 
enable cross-linking of multiple AP-4 heterotetramers, thus contributing to the 
assembly of the AP-4 coat. In addition to revealing critical aspects of this 
coat, our findings extend the paradigm of peptide-ear interactions, previously 
established for clathrin-AP-1/AP-2 coats, to a non-clathrin coat.
