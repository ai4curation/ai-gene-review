Bacteriophage lambda requires the lambda O and P proteins for its DNA 
replication. The rest of the replication proteins are provided by the 
Escherichia coli host. Some of these host proteins, such as DnaK, DnaJ, and 
GrpE, are heat shock proteins. Certain mutations in the dnaK, dnaJ, or grpE gene 
block lambda growth at all temperatures and E. coli growth above 43 degrees C. 
We have isolated bacterial mutants that were shown by Southern analysis to 
contain a defective, mini-Tn10 transposon inserted into either of two locations 
and in both orientations within the dnaJ gene. We have shown that these 
dnaJ-insertion mutants did not grow as well as the wild type at temperatures 
above 30 degrees C, although they blocked lambda DNA replication at all 
temperatures. The dnaJ-insertion mutants formed progressively smaller colonies 
at higher temperatures, up to 42 degrees C, and did not form colonies at 43 
degrees C. The accumulation of frequent, uncharacterized suppressor mutations 
allowed these insertion mutants to grow better at all temperatures and to form 
colonies at 43 degrees C. None of these suppressor mutations restored the 
ability of the host to propagate phage lambda. Radioactive labeling of proteins 
synthesized in vivo followed by immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting with 
anti-DnaJ antibodies demonstrated that no DnaJ protein could be detected in 
these mutants. Labeling studies at different temperatures demonstrated that 
these dnaJ-insertion mutations resulted in altered kinetics of heat shock 
protein synthesis. An additional eight dnaJ mutant isolates, selected 
spontaneously on the basis of blocking phage lambda growth at 42 degrees C, were 
shown not to synthesize DnaJ protein as well. Three of these eight spontaneous 
mutants had gross DNA alterations in the dnaJ gene. Our data provide evidence 
that the DnaJ protein is not absolutely essential for E. coli growth at 
temperatures up to 42 degrees C under standard laboratory conditions but is 
essential for growth at 43 degrees C. However, the accumulation of extragenic 
suppressors is necessary for rapid bacterial growth at higher temperatures.
