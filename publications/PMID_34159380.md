Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global 
health threat since December 2019, and there is still no highly effective drug 
to control the pandemic. To facilitate drug target identification for drug 
development, studies on molecular mechanisms, such as SARS-CoV-2 protein 
interactions, are urgently needed. In this study, we focused on Nsp2, a 
non-structural protein with largely unknown function and mechanism. The 
interactome of Nsp2 was revealed through the combination of affinity 
purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and stable isotope labeling by amino 
acids in cell culture (SILAC), and 84 proteins of high-confidence were 
identified. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that Nsp2-interacting proteins 
are involved in several biological processes such as endosome transport and 
translation. Network analysis generated two clusters, including ribosome 
assembly and vesicular transport. Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay confirmed 
the bindings between Nsp2- and 4-interacting proteins, i.e. STAU2 (Staufen2), 
HNRNPLL, ATP6V1B2, and RAP1GDS1 (SmgGDS), which were randomly selected from the 
list of 84 proteins. Our findings provide insights into the Nsp2-host interplay 
and indicate that Nsp2 may play important roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
serve as a potential drug target for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development.
