Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis induced by a wide variety of stimuli. In contrast, the 
Bcl-2 homologue, Bax, antagonizes Bcl-2's death protecting function. Bcl-2 forms 
protein-protein homodimers with itself and heterodimers with Bax, and previous 
experiments have shown that point mutations in Bcl-2 can abrogate Bax binding 
while leaving homodimerization intact. These mutagenesis results can be 
interpreted to suggest that Bcl-2 has separate binding sites that are 
responsible for homodimer and heterodimer formation. Results from yeast 
two-hybrid studies have also suggested that homodimerization and 
heterodimerization reflect distinct modes of interaction. However, using 
quantitative plate binding assays, we now show that Bax as well as peptides 
derived from the BH3 domains of Bax and Bak block both Bcl-2/Bax binding and 
Bcl-2/Bcl-2 binding. Similar assays demonstrate that Bcl-xL can form both 
homodimers and heterodimers and that these interactions are also inhibited by 
Bax and the BH3-derived peptides. These results demonstrate that the same 
binding motifs are responsible for both homodimerization and heterodimerization 
of Bcl-2 family members.
