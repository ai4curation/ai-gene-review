Mutations of the human BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes encoding tumor suppressors have 
been implicated in inherited predisposition to breast and other cancers. 
Disruption of the homologous mouse genes Brca1 and Brca2 by targeting showed 
that they both have indispensable roles during embryogenesis, because 
nullizygous embryos become developmentally retarded and disorganized, and die 
early in development. In Brca1 mutants, the onset of abnormalities is earlier by 
one day and their phenotypic features and time of death are highly variable, 
whereas the phenotype of Brca2 null embryos is more uniform, and they all 
survive for at least 8.5 embryonic days. Observations with Brca1/Brca2 double 
nullizygotes raise the possibility that the two developmental pathways could be 
linked. Interestingly, the impact of the Brca1 or Brca2 null mutation is less 
severe in a p53 null background.
