The mammalian ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 is the central component of a complex 
facilitating degradation of misfolded proteins during the 
ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent process of ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Hrd1 
associates with cofactors to execute ERAD, but their roles and how they assemble 
with Hrd1 are not well understood. Here, we identify crucial cofactor 
interaction domains within Hrd1 and report a previously unrecognised 
evolutionarily conserved segment within the intrinsically disordered cytoplasmic 
domain of Hrd1 (termed the HAF-H domain), which engages complementary segments 
in the cofactors FAM8A1 and Herp (also known as HERPUD1). This domain is 
required by Hrd1 to interact with both FAM8A1 and Herp, as well as to assemble 
higher-order Hrd1 complexes. FAM8A1 enhances binding of Herp to Hrd1, an 
interaction that is required for ERAD. Our findings support a model of Hrd1 
complex formation, where the Hrd1 cytoplasmic domain and FAM8A1 have a central 
role in the assembly and activity of this ERAD machinery.
