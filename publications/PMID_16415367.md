Histones are essential for the compaction of DNA into chromatin and therefore 
participate in all chromosomal functions. Specific mutations in HTA1, one of the 
two Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes encoding histone H2A, have been previously 
shown to cause chromosome segregation defects, including an increase in ploidy 
associated with altered pericentromeric chromatin structure, suggesting a role 
for histone H2A in kinetochore function. To identify proteins that may interact 
with histone H2A in the control of ploidy and chromosome segregation, we 
performed a genetic screen for suppressors of the increase-in-ploidy phenotype 
associated with one of the H2A mutations. We identified five genes, HHT1, MKS1, 
HDA1, HDA2, and HDA3, four of which encode proteins directly connected to 
chromatin function: histone H3 and each of the three subunits of the Hda1 
histone deacetylase complex. Our results show that Hda3 has functions distinct 
from Hda2 and Hda1 and that it is required for normal chromosome segregation and 
cell cycle progression. In addition, HDA3 shows genetic interactions with 
kinetochore components, emphasizing a role in centromere function, and all three 
Hda proteins show association with centromeric DNA. These findings suggest that 
the Hda1 deacetylase complex affects histone function at the centromere and that 
Hda3 has a distinctive participation in chromosome segregation. Moreover, these 
suppressors provide the basis for future studies regarding histone function in 
chromosome segregation.
