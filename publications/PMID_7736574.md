Two interleukin-2 receptor-dependent signaling pathways have thus far been 
identified: the c-fos/c-jun induction pathway mediated by src family 
protein-tyrosine kinases and the c-myc induction pathway. Here, we provide 
evidence for the existence of a third, rapamycin-sensitive pathway, which 
results in the induction of another proto-oncogene, bcl-2. In the hematopoietic 
cell line BAF-B03, the expression of any two of lckF505 (an active form of 
p56lck), Bcl-2, or c-Myc is sufficient to promote transit of the cell cycle, 
regardless of the activation state of the third pathway. We also provide 
evidence that epidermal growth factor receptor signaling may act through the 
same pathway that involves p56lck. These studies demonstrate a novel approach to 
dissecting signaling pathways regulating cellular proliferation.
