Activation of p53 target genes for tumor suppression depends on the 
stress-specific regulation of transcriptional coactivator complexes. Strap 
(stress-responsive activator of p300) is activated upon DNA damage by ataxia 
telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and Chk2 kinases and is a key regulator of the p53 
response. In addition to antagonizing Mdm2, Strap facilitates the recruitment of 
p53 coactivators, including JMY and p300. Strap is a predicted TPR-repeat 
protein, but shows only limited sequence identity with any protein of known 
structure. To address this and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of Strap 
activity we determined the crystal structure of the full-length protein at 
2.05 Å resolution. The structure of Strap reveals an atypical six 
tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein that also contains an unexpected 
oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB)-fold domain. This previously unseen 
domain organization provides an extended superhelical scaffold allowing for 
protein-protein as well as protein-DNA interaction. We show that both of the TPR 
and OB-fold domains localize to the chromatin of p53 target genes and exhibit 
intrinsic regulatory activity necessary for the Strap-dependent p53 response.

Abstract

Activation of p53 target genes for tumor suppression depends on the stress-specific regulation of transcriptional coactivator complexes. Strap (stress-responsive activator of p300) is activated upon DNA damage by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and Chk2 kinases and is a key regulator of the p53 response. In addition to antagonizing Mdm2, Strap facilitates the recruitment of p53 coactivators, including JMY and p300. Strap is a predicted TPR-repeat protein, but shows only limited sequence identity with any protein of known structure. To address this and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of Strap activity we determined the crystal structure of the full-length protein at 2.05 Å resolution. The structure of Strap reveals an atypical six tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein that also contains an unexpected oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB)-fold domain. This previously unseen domain organization provides an extended superhelical scaffold allowing for protein-protein as well as protein-DNA interaction. We show that both of the TPR and OB-fold domains localize to the chromatin of p53 target genes and exhibit intrinsic regulatory activity necessary for the Strap-dependent p53 response.

Discussion

The structure of Strap represents a substantial revision to published models of domain organization ( 6 , 18 ), with new structural motifs identified throughout the protein, including the atypical TPR1 and TPR4 motifs as well as the C-terminal OB domain. The presence of two distinct domains provides a mechanism for Strap to mediate intermolecular interactions with both protein and DNA as well as a regulatory mechanism for phosphorylation.

Our structure corresponds to the unphosphorylated cytoplasmic form of Strap ( Fig. 7 ). In this form, Strap adopts a closed conformation of both the TPR and OB domains, consistent with its cellular inactivity ( 6 ). Although the target sites for phosphorylation ( 7 , 8 ) map to the outer convex face of TPRs 5 and 6, they remain largely inaccessible to protein kinases. Jiménez et al. have reported that some 15% of the annotated phosphosites in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) exhibited less than 10% solvent accessibility in the unmodified protein ( 19 ). In general agreement with these examples, the sites in Strap occur close to helix termini as well the TPR domain boundary. These positions may be more favorable for local protein unfolding, perhaps coupled to chaperone-assisted nuclear transport, to enable kinase interaction. Domain movements are also supported by our limited proteolysis. Once phosphorylated in DNA-damaged cells, steric constraints would prevent the same TPR packing, potentially leading to a more open structure for protein assembly ( Fig. 7 ).

The OB-fold is a common feature among proteins involved in the DNA damage response and functions widely in DNA binding and protein complex assembly ( 20 ). Our data show that deletion of the OB-fold does not impair the chromatin associating activity of Strap, suggesting that the TPR domain is sufficient for assembly into some transcriptional complexes. However, deletion of the OB-fold was sufficient to impair the p53-checkpoint, underlining the importance of its binding to p300. Interestingly, a positive effect of OB-fold expression was observed in p53-null SAOS2 cells, consistent with Strap involvement in other pathways ( 12 , 18 ). Strap is known to be required for survival under heat shock and functions to assemble the complex between p300 and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) ( 12 ). In addition, Strap exhibits stress-dependent regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) that also appears dependent on both the Strap N- and C-terminal domains ( 18 ). Since p300 is known to be involved in the activity of many transcription factors, it is possible that additional Strap interaction partners remain to be identified.

The p53 response is a multifaceted signal cascade culminating in diverse cellular outcomes ( 2 ). The unpredicted domain organization and structure embodied within Strap highlights the complexity that impacts on p53 control ( 21 ). Under stress conditions, Strap is localized to p53 target genes and assembles the rich repertoire of coactivators and cofactors that influence p53 activity ( Fig. 7 ). Both the TPR and OB domains possess intrinsic regulatory activity and are critically required for an efficient p53 response. As such, the structural and functional characterization of Strap provides new information and hints toward hitherto unexpected levels of control in the p53 response.
