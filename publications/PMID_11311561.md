Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) contains ten nuclear encoded subunits, three of them 
known to show tissue isoforms in mammals. We have now found a fourth isoform, 
for subunit IV, in human, rat and mouse (COX IV-2). Comparison of the two human 
isoform genes shows a similar structural organization, including an overall size 
of about 8 kb, the presence of five exons, and the initiation of translation in 
the second exon, consistent with formation by gene duplication. Also consistent 
is the higher identity of precursor peptides of 78% within the new IV-2 isoform 
(average in the three species) compared to 44% average identity with the IV-1 
isoform. Northern analysis and quantitative PCR with human and rat tissues show 
high IV-2 expression in adult lung and lower expression in all other tissues 
investigated, including fetal lung. In contrast, the IV-1 isoform is 
ubiquitously expressed. In situ hybridizations were performed to localize 
isoform transcripts in rat lung. Both isoforms are found in similar ratios in 
most lung cell types except for smooth muscle and respiratory epithelium, which 
have a IV-2 and a IV-1 preference, respectively. Structural modeling of the IV-2 
isoform from human, based on the bovine crystal data, produces a conformation in 
which two of three conserved cysteine groups, exclusively present in the 
mammalian IV-2 isoform, are in close proximity. The formation of a cysteine bond 
and the implications for function of these sequence differences for subunit IV, 
which plays a pivotal role in COX regulation, are discussed.
