The exon junction complex (EJC) participates in the regulation of many 
post-transcriptional steps of gene expression. EJCs are deposited on messenger 
RNAs (mRNAs) during splicing and their core consists of eIF4A3, MLN51, Y14, and 
MAGOH. Here, we show that two genes encoding MAGOH paralogs (referred to as 
MAGOH and MAGOHB) are expressed in mammals. In macrophages, the expression of 
MAGOHB, but not MAGOH mRNA, increases rapidly after LPS stimulation. Both MAGOH 
proteins interact with other EJC components, incorporate into mRNA-bound EJCs, 
and activate nonsense-mediated decay. Furthermore, the simultaneous depletion of 
MAGOH and MAGOHB, but not individual depletions, impair nonsense-mediated decay 
in human cells. Hence, our results establish that the core composition of 
mammalian EJCs is more complex than previously recognized.
