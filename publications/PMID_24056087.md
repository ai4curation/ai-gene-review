FE65 is an adaptor protein that binds to the amyloid precursor protein (APP). As 
such, FE65 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In 
addition, evidence suggests that FE65 is involved in brain development. It is 
generally believed that FE65 participates in these processes by recruiting 
various interacting partners to form functional complexes. Here, we show that 
via its first phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, FE65 binds to the small 
GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6). FE65 preferentially binds to ARF6-GDP, 
and they colocalize in neuronal growth cones. Interestingly, FE65 stimulates the 
activation of both ARF6 and its downstream GTPase Rac1, a regulator of actin 
dynamics, and functions in growth cones to stimulate neurite outgrowth. We show 
that transfection of FE65 and/or ARF6 promotes whereas small interfering RNA 
knockdown of FE65 or ARF6 inhibits neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons as 
compared to the mock-transfected control cells. Moreover, knockdown of ARF6 
attenuates FE65 stimulation of neurite outgrowth and defective neurite outgrowth 
seen in FE65-deficient neurons is partially corrected by ARF6 overexpression. 
Notably, the stimulatory effect of FE65 and ARF6 on neurite outgrowth is 
abrogated either by dominant-negative Rac1 or knockdown of Rac1. Thus, we 
identify FE65 as a novel regulator of neurite outgrowth via controlling 
ARF6-Rac1 signaling.
