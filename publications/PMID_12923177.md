Liprin-alpha/SYD-2 is a family of multidomain proteins with four known isoforms. 
One of the reported functions of liprin-alpha is to regulate the development of 
presynaptic active zones, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. 
Here we report that liprin-alpha directly interacts with the ERC 
(ELKS-Rab6-interacting protein-CAST) family of proteins, members of which are 
known to bind RIMs, the active zone proteins that regulate neurotransmitter 
release. In vitro results indicate that ERC2/CAST, an active zone-specific 
isoform, interacts with all of the known isoforms of liprin-alpha and that 
liprin-alpha1 associates with both ERC2 and ERC1b, a splice variant of ERC1 that 
distributes to both cytosolic and active zone regions. ERC2 colocalizes with 
liprin-alpha1 in cultured neurons and forms a complex with liprin-alpha1 in 
brain. Liprin-alpha1, when expressed alone in cultured neurons, shows a partial 
synaptic localization. When coexpressed with ERC2, however, liprin-alpha1 is 
redistributed to synaptic sites. Moreover, roughly the first half of ERC2, which 
contains the liprin-alpha-binding region, is sufficient for the synaptic 
localization of liprin-alpha1 while the second half is not. These results 
suggest that the interaction between ERC2 and liprin-alpha may be involved in 
the presynaptic localization of liprin-alpha and the molecular organization of 
presynaptic active zones.
