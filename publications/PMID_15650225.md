Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule between cells which has 
been shown to have an inhibitory effect on some virus infections. The purpose of 
this study was to examine whether NO inhibits the replication cycle of the 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) in vitro. We found that 
an organic NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, significantly inhibited 
the replication cycle of SARS CoV in a concentration-dependent manner. We also 
show here that NO inhibits viral protein and RNA synthesis. Furthermore, we 
demonstrate that NO generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase, an enzyme that 
produces NO, inhibits the SARS CoV replication cycle.
