ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities participate in the alteration of 
chromatin structure during gene regulation. All have DNA- or 
chromatin-stimulated ATPase activity and many can alter the structure of 
chromatin; however, the means by which they do this have remained unclear. Here 
we describe a novel activity for ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities, 
the ability to generate unconstrained negative superhelical torsion in DNA and 
chromatin. We find that the ability to distort DNA is shared by the yeast 
SWI/SNF complex, Xenopus Mi-2 complex, recombinant ISWI, and recombinant BRG1, 
suggesting that the generation of superhelical torsion represents a primary 
biomechanical activity shared by all Snf2p-related ATPase motors. The generation 
of superhelical torque provides a potent means by which ATP-dependent chromatin 
remodeling activities can manipulate chromatin structure.
