Amino-acid transport across cellular plasma membranes depends on several 
parallel-functioning (co-)transporters and exchangers. The widespread transport 
system L accounts for a sodium-independent exchange of large, neutral amino 
acids, whereas the system y(+)L exchanges positively charged amino acids and/or 
neutral amino acids together with sodium. The molecular nature of these 
transporters remains unknown, although expression of the human cell-surface 
glycoprotein 4F2 heavy chain (h4F2hc; CD98 in the mouse) is known to induce low 
levels of L- and/or y(+)L-type transport. This glycoprotein is found in 
activated lymphocytes, together with an uncharacterized, disulphide-linked 
lipophilic light chain with an apparent relative molecular mass of 40,000 (M(r) 
40K). Here we identify the permease-related protein E16 as the first light chain 
of h4F2hc and show that the resulting heterodimeric complex mediates L-type 
amino-acid transport. The homologous protein from Schistosoma mansoni, SPRM1, 
also associates covalently with coexpressed h4F2hc glycoprotein, although it 
induces amino-acid transport of different substrate specificity. The 
coexpression of h4F2hc is required for surface expression of these 
permease-related light chains, which belong to a new family of amino-acid 
transporters that form heterodimers with cell-surface glycoproteins.
