Syntenin, a tandem PDZ domain containing scaffold protein, functions as a 
positive regulator of cancer cell progression in several human cancers. We 
report here that syntenin positively regulates transforming growth factor 
(TGF)-β1-mediated Smad activation and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT) by preventing caveolin-1-mediated internalization of TGF-β type I receptor 
(TβRI). Knockdown of syntenin suppressed TGF-β1-mediated cell migration, 
transcriptional responses and Smad2/3 activation in various types of cells; 
however, overexpression of syntenin facilitated TGF-β1-mediated responses. In 
particular, syntenin knockdown abolished both the basal and TGF-β1-mediated 
repression of E-cadherin expression, as well as induction of vimentin expression 
along with Snail and Slug upregulation; thus, blocking the TGF-β1-induced EMT in 
A549 cells. In contrast, overexpression of syntenin exhibited the opposite 
effect. Knockdown of syntenin-induced ubiquitination and degradation of TβRI, 
but not TGF-β type II receptor, leading to decreased TβRI expression at the 
plasma membrane. Syntenin associated with TβRI at its C-terminal domain and a 
syntenin mutant lacking C-terminal domain failed to increase TGF-β1-induced 
responses. Biochemical analyzes revealed that syntenin inhibited the interaction 
between caveolin-1 and TβRI and knockdown of syntenin induced a massive 
internalization of TβRI and caveolin-1 from lipid rafts, indicating that 
syntenin may increase TGF-β signaling by inhibiting caveolin-1-dependent 
internalization of TβRI. Moreover, a positive correlation between syntenin 
expression and phospho-Smad2 levels is observed in human lung tumors. Taken 
together, these findings demonstrate that syntenin may act as an important 
positive regulator of TGF-β signaling by regulating caveolin-1-mediated 
internalization of TβRI; thus, providing a novel function for syntenin that is 
linked to cancer progression.
