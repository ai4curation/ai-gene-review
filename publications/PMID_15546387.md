Interleukin-21 (IL-21) is the newest member of the common gamma-chain family of 
cytokines, which includes IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-13, and IL-15. Its private 
receptor, IL-21R, has been shown to activate the Janus kinase/signal transducers 
and activators of transcription signaling pathway upon ligand binding. Initial 
studies have demonstrated that IL-21 has pleiotropic effects on the 
proliferation, differentiation, and effector functions of B, T, natural killer, 
and dendritic cells. More recently, the potential therapeutic capacity of IL-21 
in the treatment of cancers has been widely investigated. The biological role of 
IL-21 in the immune system is complex, as IL-21 has been shown to have the 
ability to both promote and inhibit immune responses. Overall, the current data 
point to IL-21 being a novel immunomodulatory cytokine, whose regulation of any 
given immune response is highly dependent on the surrounding environmental 
context.
