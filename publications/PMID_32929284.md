The majority of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) powering cellular processes in 
eukaryotes is produced by the mitochondrial F1Fo ATP synthase. Here, we present 
the atomic models of the membrane Fo domain and the entire mammalian (ovine) 
F1Fo, determined by cryo-electron microscopy. Subunits in the membrane domain 
are arranged in the 'proton translocation cluster' attached to the c-ring and a 
more distant 'hook apparatus' holding subunit e. Unexpectedly, this subunit is 
anchored to a lipid 'plug' capping the c-ring. We present a detailed proton 
translocation pathway in mammalian Fo and key inter-monomer contacts in F1Fo 
multimers. Cryo-EM maps of F1Fo exposed to calcium reveal a retracted subunit e 
and a disassembled c-ring, suggesting permeability transition pore opening. We 
propose a model for the permeability transition pore opening, whereby subunit e 
pulls the lipid plug out of the c-ring. Our structure will allow the design of 
drugs for many emerging applications in medicine.
