Wolfram syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by diabetes 
mellitus and optic atrophy, is caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene encoding an 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, Wolframin. Although its precise 
functions are unknown, Wolframin deficiency increases ER stress, impairs cell 
cycle progression and affects calcium homeostasis. To gain further insight into 
its function and identify molecular partners, we used the WFS1-C-terminal domain 
as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen with a human brain cDNA library. Na+/K+ 
ATPase beta1 subunit was identified as an interacting clone. We mapped the 
interaction to the WFS1 C-terminal and transmembrane domains, but not the 
N-terminal domain. Our mapping data suggest that the interaction most likely 
occurs in the ER. We confirmed the interaction by co-immunoprecipitation in 
mammalian cells and with endogenous proteins in JEG3 placental cells, 
neuroblastoma SKNAS and pancreatic MIN6 beta cells. Na+/K+ ATPase beta1 subunit 
expression was reduced in plasma membrane fractions of human WFS1 mutant 
fibroblasts and WFS1 knockdown MIN6 pancreatic beta-cells compared with 
wild-type cells; Na+/K+ ATPase alpha1 subunit expression was also reduced in 
WFS-depleted MIN6 beta cells. Induction of ER stress in wild-type cells only 
partly accounted for the reduced Na+/K+ ATPase beta1 subunit expression 
observed. We conclude that the interaction may be important for Na+/K+ ATPase 
beta1 subunit maturation; loss of this interaction may contribute to the 
pathology seen in Wolfram syndrome via reductions in sodium pump alpha1 and 
beta1 subunit expression in pancreatic beta-cells.
