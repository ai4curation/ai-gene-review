The binding of Cbl-interacting protein of 85 kDa (CIN85) to c-Cbl is important 
to endocytosis and degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The 
proline-arginine motif PXXXPR in c-Cbl and SH3 domains of CIN85 are essential to 
this interaction. Here, we demonstrated that SH3KBP1-binding protein 1 (SHKBP1), 
which also contains two PXXXPR motifs, constitutively bound to SH3 domains of 
CIN85. Importantly, the binding of SHKBP1 prevented the interaction of CIN85 
with c-Cbl and inhibited the translocation of CIN85 to EGFR-containing vesicles, 
thus reducing EGFR degradation and enhancing EGF-induced serum response element 
transcription activity. Therefore, our results indicated that SHKBP1 could 
promote EGFR signaling pathway by interrupting c-Cbl-CIN85 complex and 
inhibiting EGFR degradation.
