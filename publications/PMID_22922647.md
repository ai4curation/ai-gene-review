Organisms that protect their germ-cell lineages from damage often do so at 
considerable cost: limited metabolic resources become partitioned away from 
maintenance of the soma, leaving the ageing somatic tissues to navigate survival 
amid an environment containing damaged and poorly functioning proteins. 
Historically, experimental paradigms that limit reproductive investment result 
in lifespan extension. We proposed that germline-deficient animals might exhibit 
heightened protection from proteotoxic stressors in somatic tissues. We find 
that the forced re-investment of resources from the germ line to the soma in 
Caenorhabditis elegans results in elevated somatic proteasome activity, 
clearance of damaged proteins and increased longevity. This activity is 
associated with increased expression of rpn-6, a subunit of the 19S proteasome, 
by the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. Ectopic expression of rpn-6 is 
sufficient to confer proteotoxic stress resistance and extend lifespan, 
indicating that rpn-6 is a candidate to correct deficiencies in age-related 
protein homeostasis disorders.
