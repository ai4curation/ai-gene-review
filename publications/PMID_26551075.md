Aberrant activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) contributes to many human cancers 
by activating the Ras-MAPK pathway and other pathways. EGFR signaling is 
augmented by Src-family kinases, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here, 
we show that human EGFR preferentially phosphorylates peptide substrates that 
are primed by a prior phosphorylation. Using peptides based on the sequence of 
the adaptor protein Shc1, we show that Src mediates the priming phosphorylation, 
thus promoting subsequent phosphorylation by EGFR. Importantly, the doubly 
phosphorylated Shc1 peptide binds more tightly than singly phosphorylated 
peptide to the Ras activator Grb2; this binding is a key step in activating the 
Ras-MAPK pathway. Finally, a crystal structure of EGFR in complex with a primed 
Shc1 peptide reveals the structural basis for EGFR substrate specificity. These 
results provide a molecular explanation for the integration of Src and EGFR 
signaling with downstream effectors such as Ras.

Abstract

Aberrant activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) contributes to many human cancers by activating the Ras-MAPK and other pathways. EGFR signaling is augmented by Src-family kinases, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that human EGFR preferentially phosphorylates peptide substrates that are primed by a prior phosphorylation. Utilizing peptides based on the sequence of the adaptor protein Shc1, we show that Src mediates the priming phosphorylation, promoting subsequent phosphorylation by EGFR. Importantly, the doubly phosphorylated Shc1 peptide binds more tightly to the Ras activator Grb2, a key step in activating the Ras-MAPK pathway, than singly phosphorylated peptides. Finally, a crystal structure of EGFR in complex with a primed Shc1 peptide reveals the structural basis for EGFR substrate specificity. These results provide a molecular explanation for the integration of Src and EGFR signaling with downstream effectors such as Ras.

DISCUSSION

Cooperativity with Src is a key element of EGFR signaling and plays an important functional role in EGFR-driven cancers; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we provide a molecular explanation for how Src activity is integrated with EGFR signaling. We found that EGFR preferentially phosphorylates substrates that are primed by a prior phosphorylation and, in the case of the adaptor protein Shc1, we showed that Src mediates the priming phosphorylation. Importantly, the dual phosphorylation of Shc1 by Src and EGFR significantly enhanced Shc1 binding to Grb2, a key step in activating the Ras-MAPK pathway, beyond EGFR phosphorylation alone ( Fig. 4d ).

Evidence that EGFR selectivity for phosphotyrosine primed substrates is relevant in cells comes from the observation that many tyrosine phosphorylation sites in cells driven by EGFR mutations have a phosphotyrosine at the +1 position 35 . We used the PhosphositePlus database to identify a subset of these sites that have also been shown to be sensitive to treatment with EGFR-specific inhibitors ( Table 1 ). In the case of Shc1 Tyr239, we showed that Src can function as the priming kinase and catalyze the priming phosphorylation at Tyr240. However, it is likely that Src primes multiple substrates for EGFR phosphorylation. For example, a recent study showed that EGFR phosphorylation of Mig6, a putative tumor suppressor and feedback inhibitor of EGFR, is enhanced by prior phosphorylation of an adjacent tyrosine by Src 36 . If Src primes multiple EGFR substrates, it will be important to determine if this is a mechanism by which Src promotes signaling through a subset of pathways downstream of EGFR or if Src induces the phosphorylation of a different set of substrates.

The crystal structure of the EGFR kinase domain in complex with a Shc1 peptide phosphorylated at Tyr240 provides a molecular explanation for EGFR specificity for primed substrates. Interestingly, in both this structure and a structure of EGFR in complex with an optimized substrate peptide, the major sequence-specific interaction was between EGFR and the phosphate of the phosphotyrosine at P+1 ( Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). This observation suggests that prior phosphorylation is the dominant sequence feature recognized by EGFR, not the sequence of the surrounding amino acids. A lack of stringent primary sequence requirements suggests that EGFR has the potential to phosphorylate substrates primed by many different tyrosine kinases and this could serve as a mechanism of signal integration with multiple signaling pathways.

In the case of Shc1, we showed that Src preferentially phosphorylates Tyr240 to promote EGFR phosphorylation of Tyr239. However, our PSPL results indicate that Src has relatively strong selectivity for tyrosine at several positions surrounding the phosphorylation site ( Fig. 3a ). These results suggest that Src could potentially catalyze priming phosphorylations at multiple positions flanking tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Substrate priming may therefore be a general characteristic of Src signaling and may be the mechanism by which Src participates in signaling downstream of several receptor tyrosine kinases 5 .

Our current work indicates that the SH2 domain of Grb2 binds doubly phosphorylated Shc1 with greater affinity than Shc1 phosphorylated at Tyr239 alone ( Fig. 4b ). We previously investigated the optimal binding motif for the Grb2 SH2 domain 28 . We found that Asn at the +2 position relative to the phosphotyrosine dominated the binding selectivity (Asn is found at the +2 position relative to pY239 of Shc1) and subsequent work elucidated the structural basis for this specificity 37 . However, our original study only investigated selectivity for the 20 natural amino acids; selectivity for phosphorylated amino acids within the optimal binding motif was not addressed. Our current results, together with several recent studies showing increased affinity of SH2 domains for doubly phosphorylated peptides, raise the possibility that the presence of multiple phosphorylations within an SH2 domain recognition motif may be a common mechanism that enables complex regulation of SH2 domain-target protein interactions 38 – 41 .

Finally, it is well established that protein kinase substrate selectivity is strongly influenced by the sequence immediately surrounding the phosphorylation site. Until recently, selectivity for phosphorylated amino acids was thought to be unique to the serine/threonine protein kinases glycogen synthase kinase-3 and casein kinase 1 42 , 43 . However, recent high-resolution phosphoproteomics analyses have made it clear that the sequences surrounding phosphorylation sites often contain additional sites of phosphorylation 43 . For example, a survey of multiply phosphorylated proteins showed that more than half of all phosphorylation sites are within 4 amino acids of another site 44 . Based on these observations, proximal phosphorylations would be expected to be an important selectivity determinant for far more protein kinases. One explanation for why so few kinases with this selectivity have been identified is that phosphorylated amino acids had to be excluded from previous methods used to determine protein kinase selectivity in vitro . Consistent with this, recent studies utilizing the PSPL approach have identified several additional kinases with selectivity for phosphorylated substrates 46 – 49 . These observations, together with results described here, suggest that coordinated substrate phosphorylation by two or more kinases is likely to be a common mechanism of signal integration that contributes to both normal and oncogenic protein kinase signaling.
