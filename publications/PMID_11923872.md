The p53 tumour suppressor is a short-lived protein that is maintained at low 
levels in normal cells by Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent 
proteolysis. Stabilization of p53 is crucial for its tumour suppressor function. 
However, the precise mechanism by which ubiquitinated p53 levels are regulated 
in vivo is not completely understood. By mass spectrometry of affinity-purified 
p53-associated factors, we have identified herpesvirus-associated 
ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP) as a novel p53-interacting protein. HAUSP 
strongly stabilizes p53 even in the presence of excess Mdm2, and also induces 
p53-dependent cell growth repression and apoptosis. Significantly, HAUSP has an 
intrinsic enzymatic activity that specifically deubiquitinates p53 both in vitro 
and in vivo. In contrast, expression of a catalytically inactive point mutant of 
HAUSP in cells increases the levels of p53 ubiquitination and destabilizes p53. 
These findings reveal an important mechanism by which p53 can be stabilized by 
direct deubiquitination and also imply that HAUSP might function as a tumour 
suppressor in vivo through the stabilization of p53.
