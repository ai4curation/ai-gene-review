Ectodomain shedding of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the two proteases 
alpha- and beta-secretase is a key regulatory event in the generation of the 
Alzheimer disease amyloid beta peptide (Abeta). beta-Secretase catalyzes the 
first step in Abeta generation, whereas alpha-secretase cleaves within the Abeta 
domain, prevents Abeta generation, and generates a secreted form of APP with 
neuroprotective properties. At present, little is known about the cellular 
mechanisms that control APP alpha-secretase cleavage and Abeta generation. To 
explore the contributory pathways, we carried out an expression cloning screen. 
We identified a novel member of the sorting nexin (SNX) family of endosomal 
trafficking proteins, called SNX33, as a new activator of APP alpha-secretase 
cleavage. SNX33 is a homolog of SNX9 and was found to be a ubiquitously 
expressed phosphoprotein. Exogenous expression of SNX33 in cultured cells 
increased APP alpha-secretase cleavage 4-fold but surprisingly had little effect 
on beta-secretase cleavage. This effect was similar to the expression of the 
dominant negative dynamin-1 mutant K44A. SNX33 bound the endocytic GTPase 
dynamin and reduced the rate of APP endocytosis in a dynamin-dependent manner. 
This led to an increase of APP at the plasma membrane, where alpha-secretase 
cleavage mostly occurs. In summary, our study identifies SNX33 as a new 
endocytic protein, which modulates APP endocytosis and APP alpha-secretase 
cleavage, and demonstrates that the rate of APP endocytosis is a major control 
factor for APP alpha-secretase cleavage.
