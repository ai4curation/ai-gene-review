Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) are endothelial-cell-specific organelles that, upon 
fusion with the plasma membrane, release cargo molecules that are essential in 
blood vessel abnormalities, such as thrombosis and inflammation, as well as in 
angiogenesis. Despite the importance of WPBs, the basic mechanisms that mediate 
their secretion are only poorly understood. Rab GTPases play fundamental role in 
the trafficking of intracellular organelles. Yet, the only known WPB-associated 
Rabs are Rab27a and Rab3d. To determine the full spectrum of WPB-associated Rabs 
we performed a complete Rab screening by analysing the localisation of all Rabs 
in WPBs and their involvement in the secretory process in endothelial cells. 
Apart from Rab3 and Rab27, we identified three additional Rabs, Rab15 (a 
previously reported endocytic Rab), Rab33 and Rab37, on the WPB limiting 
membrane. A knockdown approach using siRNAs showed that among these five WPB 
Rabs only Rab3, Rab27 and Rab15 are required for exocytosis. Intriguingly, we 
found that Rab15 cooperates with Rab27a in WPB secretion. Furthermore, a 
specific effector of Rab27, Munc13-4, appears to be also an effector of Rab15 
and is required for WPB exocytosis. These data indicate that WPB secretion 
requires the coordinated function of a specific group of Rabs and that, among 
them, Rab27a and Rab15, as well as their effector Munc13-4, cooperate to drive 
exocytosis.
