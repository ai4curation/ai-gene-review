In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), ethylene is perceived by a receptor 
family consisting of five members. Subfamily 1 members ETHYLENE RESPONSE1 (ETR1) 
and ETHYLENE RESPONSE SENSOR1 (ERS1) have histidine kinase activity, unlike the 
subfamily 2 members ETR2, ERS2, and ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE4 (EIN4), which lack 
amino acid residues critical for this enzymatic activity. To resolve the role of 
histidine kinase activity in signaling by the receptors, we transformed an 
etr1-9;ers1-3 double mutant with wild-type and kinase-inactive versions of the 
receptor ETR1. Both wild-type and kinase-inactive ETR1 rescue the constitutive 
ethylene-response phenotype of etr1-9;ers1-3, restoring normal growth to the 
mutant in air. However, the lines carrying kinase-inactive ETR1 exhibit reduced 
sensitivity to ethylene based on several growth response assays. Microarray and 
real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses of gene expression support a role 
for histidine kinase activity in eliciting the ethylene response. In addition, 
protein levels of the Raf-like kinase CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1), 
which physically associates with the ethylene receptor ETR1, are less responsive 
to ethylene in lines containing kinase-inactive ETR1. These data indicate that 
the histidine kinase activity of ETR1 is not required for but plays a modulating 
role in the regulation of ethylene responses. Models for how enzymatic and 
nonenzymatic regulation may facilitate signaling from the ethylene receptors are

Abstract

In Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ), ethylene is perceived by a receptor family consisting of five members. Subfamily 1 members ETHYLENE RESPONSE1 (ETR1) and ETHYLENE RESPONSE SENSOR1 (ERS1) have histidine kinase activity, unlike the subfamily 2 members ETR2, ERS2, and ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE4 (EIN4), which lack amino acid residues critical for this enzymatic activity. To resolve the role of histidine kinase activity in signaling by the receptors, we transformed an etr1-9;ers1-3 double mutant with wild-type and kinase-inactive versions of the receptor ETR1. Both wild-type and kinase-inactive ETR1 rescue the constitutive ethylene-response phenotype of etr1-9;ers1-3 , restoring normal growth to the mutant in air. However, the lines carrying kinase-inactive ETR1 exhibit reduced sensitivity to ethylene based on several growth response assays. Microarray and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses of gene expression support a role for histidine kinase activity in eliciting the ethylene response. In addition, protein levels of the Raf-like kinase CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1), which physically associates with the ethylene receptor ETR1, are less responsive to ethylene in lines containing kinase-inactive ETR1. These data indicate that the histidine kinase activity of ETR1 is not required for but plays a modulating role in the regulation of ethylene responses. Models for how enzymatic and nonenzymatic regulation may facilitate signaling from the ethylene receptors are discussed.

DISCUSSION

The role that ethylene receptors play in ethylene signal transduction involves their ability to (1) repress ethylene responses in the absence of ethylene (in air) and (2) establish ethylene responses in the presence of ethylene. The ethylene receptors function in concert with the physically associated Raf-like kinase CTR1 to accomplish this purpose ( Clark et al., 1998 ; Cancel and Larsen, 2002 ; Gao et al., 2003 ). CTR1 is a negative regulator of ethylene signaling, and loss-of-function mutations in CTR1 result in a constitutive ethylene response ( Kieber et al., 1993 ; Huang et al., 2003 ). Similarly, higher order loss-of-function mutations in the ethylene receptors also result in a constitutive ethylene-response phenotype ( Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ; Qu et al., 2007 ), apparently due to the loss of CTR1 from the ER membrane location of the ethylene receptor/CTR1 complex ( Gao et al., 2003 ; Qu et al., 2007 ). Thus, the role of ethylene receptors in air involves maintaining both the kinase activity and the correct location for action of CTR1, resulting in the repression of the ethylene response. The role of the ethylene receptors upon binding ethylene is then achieved by transmitting information, whether enzymatic or conformational, to CTR1 to reduce its kinase activity, thereby derepressing the ethylene response.

A characteristic feature of the subfamily 1 ethylene receptors is their conserved His kinase domain, a feature noted after the initial cloning of ETR1 and one that immediately raised the question of what role His kinase activity might play in signaling ( Chang and Meyerowitz, 1995 ). Resolution of this question optimally requires a genetic background that eliminates the endogenous His kinase activity of ETR1 and ERS1 and was initially addressed after the isolation of null etr1 alleles ( Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ) and the T-DNA insertion allele ers1-2 ( Zhao et al., 2002 ; Wang et al., 2003 ). The constitutive ethylene-response phenotype of an etr1-7;ers1-2 double mutant was rescued by subfamily 1 receptors but not by subfamily 2 receptors, indicating that a subfamily 1-specific feature was required for functional complementation, potentially His kinase activity ( Wang et al., 2003 ). However, a kinase-inactive version of ETR1 also rescued the mutant phenotype, indicating that canonical His kinase activity was not required for signaling ( Wang et al., 2003 ). This might have been the end of the story, but isolation of a new T-DNA insertion allele of ERS1 ( ers1-3 ), coupled with molecular and genetic analyses, indicated that the ers1-2 allele is not a complete null (the ers1-2 T-DNA is inserted into the 5â€² untranslated region and the ERS1 transcript is still produced, whereas the ers1-3 T-DNA is inserted into the second exon and disrupts the production of the ERS1 transcript; Xie et al., 2006 ; Qu et al., 2007 ). Thus, the etr1-7;ers1-2 background used by Wang et al. (2003) contains residual activity from ERS1 , and the degree to which His kinase activity contributes to the signal output of the ethylene receptors could not be fully ascertained, prompting models for how His kinase activity might function in concert with CTR1 to mediate signaling ( Lin et al., 2009 ). To resolve the role of His kinase activity in ethylene signaling, we used the double mutant etr1-9;ers1-3 , which is null for both subfamily 1 ethylene receptors, and analyzed the ability of kinase-inactive forms of ETR1 to rescue the constitutive ethylene-response phenotype found in the mutant.

A key conclusion from our study, consistent with the earlier study by Wang et al. (2003) , is that His kinase activity is not absolutely required for signaling by the receptors, either for repressing ethylene responses in air or for establishing ethylene responses upon ethylene binding. The etr1-9;ers1-3 double mutant exhibits substantially reduced levels of membrane-associated CTR1, accounting for its strong constitutive ethylene-response phenotype ( Qu et al., 2007 ). Both wild-type and kinase-inactive versions of ETR1 are capable of binding to CTR1, based on analysis in a yeast model system ( Gao et al., 2003 ) and our immunoblot analysis of the transgenic lines reported here. Thus, the rescue of the double-mutant phenotype is consistent with both wild-type and kinase-inactive versions of ETR1 reforming a functional signaling complex with CTR1, which is then able to repress the constitutive ethylene-response phenotype of the etr1-9;ers1-3 mutant in air. Significantly, kinase-inactive ETR1 can also induce an ethylene response, based on phenotypic and gene expression analyses. This indicates that ETR1 has an alternative mechanism, not involving its His kinase activity, by which to regulate the kinase activity of CTR1. The physical interaction of CTR1 with the receptors ( Clark et al., 1998 ; Cancel and Larsen, 2002 ; Gao et al., 2003 ) suggests that its regulation could be accomplished due to conformational changes in the receptors being transmitted to the associated CTR1.

Although the His kinase is not absolutely required for signaling by ETR1, our study does demonstrate that this enzymatic activity modulates signaling. Kinase-inactive ETR1 was less effective than wild-type ETR1 at inducing an ethylene response, based on phenotypic analysis of dark- and light-grown seedlings as well as the molecular analysis of ethylene-regulated gene expression. A concern with any genetic study involving site-directed mutations is whether the phenotype is due to the known effect of the site-directed mutations or to an unintended side effect. To minimize the possibility of side effects, we made relatively conserved changes in the amino acids in which we incorporated established modifications based on work with bacterial and fungal two-component signaling elements ( Iuchi, 1993 ; Pan et al., 1993 ; Yang and Inouye, 1993 ; Posas et al., 1996 ). In addition, we made use of three mutant versions of ETR1, the effects of these mutations being consistent with a shared mechanistic role in a His-Asp phosphorelay. Specifically, we found that the reduced ethylene sensitivity observed in ETR1-G2 is further accentuated in the ETR1-H/G2 mutant, suggesting that His-353 and the G2 box, although separate in the primary sequence, play a role in the same signaling mechanism. Furthermore, the Asp mutation had no additive effect, consistent with its role being downstream and dependent on the His kinase activity of ETR1.

The decreased ethylene sensitivity of kinase-inactive ETR1 expressed in the etr1-9;ers1-3 background contrasts with the results obtained from expression in the etr1-7;ers1-2 or the etr1-7;etr2-3;ein4-4 background ( Wang et al., 2003 ; Qu and Schaller, 2004 ). No difference was observed between wild-type ETR1 and kinase-inactive ETR1 in their ability to rescue the constitutive ethylene-response phenotype of etr1-7;ers1-2 or in their ability to mediate ethylene responses in the transgenic seedlings ( Wang et al., 2003 ). Our ability to detect differences between wild-type ETR1 and kinase-inactive ETR1 when expressed in the etr1-9;ers1-3 background is likely due to this background being null for both subfamily 1 receptors, whereas the etr1-7;ers1-2 background contains residual levels of ERS1 ( Xie et al., 2006 ; Qu et al., 2007 ). When expressed in the etr1-7;etr2-3;ein4-4 background, kinase-inactive ETR1 was found to be slightly less effective than wild-type ETR1 in rescuing the constitutive ethylene-response phenotype of the background ( Qu and Schaller, 2004 ). Additionally, the transgenic etr1-7;etr2-3;ein4-4 lines containing kinase-inactive ETR1 also exhibited slightly increased ethylene sensitivity compared with lines containing wild-type ETR1 ( Qu and Schaller, 2004 ), an interesting result because it is the opposite of what is found in the etr1-9;ers1-3 background. This difference in ethylene responsiveness likely arises from the substantive differences in receptor makeup of the etr1-7;etr2-3;ein4-4 and etr1-9;ers1-3 backgrounds ( Oâ€™Malley et al., 2005 ; Qu et al., 2007 ), although the specific basis is unknown. It is notable, however, that the phenotype of decreased ethylene sensitivity we associate here with kinase-inactive ETR1 is only uncovered when the His kinase activity of both subfamily 1 receptors ETR1 and ERS1 is eliminated from the background.

Two possibilities, not mutually exclusive, could account for phosphorylation playing a modulating role in ethylene signal transduction ( Mason and Schaller, 2005 ). First, ETR1 could transmit a signal through a multistep phosphorelay involving downstream phosphotransfer proteins (AHPs) and response regulators (ARRs); this alternative and secondary pathway could augment output from the primary CTR1-dependent pathway. Support for such an alternative ethylene-signaling pathway comes from evidence that the ethylene receptors interact with AHP proteins ( Urao et al., 2000 ; Scharein et al., 2008 ), that the response regulator ARR2 may modulate ethylene signaling ( Hass et al., 2004 ; Mason et al., 2005 ), and that mutants of CTR1 still demonstrate a residual ethylene response ( Larsen and Chang, 2001 ; Hall and Bleecker, 2003 ).

A second possibility is that the phosphorylation of ETR1 affects signaling through well-established components of the pathway, a possibility consistent with the broad effect on transcription of ethylene-regulated genes in the kinase-inactive mutant. Phosphorylation is a commonly used mechanism to elicit conformational changes in proteins as well as to modulate interactions between proteins; therefore, phosphorylation could, for instance, modulate the conformational information passed between ETR1 and the physically associated CTR1. Consistent with such a possibility is the finding that both the His kinase and receiver domains of the ethylene receptors associate with CTR1 ( Clark et al., 1998 ; Cancel and Larsen, 2002 ; Gao et al., 2003 ; Zhong et al., 2008 ). Based on our data, the kinase-inactive ETR1 is more effective at suppressing the ethylene response than wild-type ETR1; thus, according to this model, autophosphorylation of ETR1 would serve as a part of the means by which CTR1 is inactivated (i.e. in the kinase-inactive ETR1 lines, CTR1 is more active; thus, it is more difficult to induce an ethylene response). Interestingly, we observed lower levels of CTR1 associated with the kinase-inactive ETR1 lines than with the wild-type ETR1 lines, even though these lines were more effective at suppressing the ethylene response. The reduced levels of CTR1 in the kinase-inactive lines may reflect their reduced ethylene responsiveness, because one of the ethylene responses is to induce increased levels of membrane-associated CTR1 ( Gao et al., 2003 ). Alternatively, the reduced CTR1 levels may reflect part of a feedback mechanism to modulate output from the receptors, we having observed that CTR1 levels do not always directly correlate with the total receptor levels, actually increasing in the etr1-7 and etr1-9 null mutants ( Gao et al., 2003 ; Qu et al., 2007 ).

Other elements of the ethylene signal transduction pathway, including other ethylene receptors, the essential downstream signaling component EIN2, and the signaling modulator RTE1, also physically associate with ETR1 ( Gao et al., 2008 ; Grefen et al., 2008 ; Bisson et al., 2009 ; Chen et al., 2010 ) and could have their activities potentially modified through interactions with phospho-ETR1. Interestingly, in vitro analysis suggests that the phosphorylation of ETR1 may reduce its affinity for EIN2, supporting the possibility that His phosphorylation may affect and modulate interactions among components of the ethylene receptor signaling complex ( Bisson et al., 2009 ).

The simplest mechanistic model, consistent with our data indicating that autophosphorylation serves a role in establishing an ethylene response, is that ethylene stimulates the His kinase activity and autophosphorylation of ETR1. The kinase-inactive ETR1would thus be less effective at initiating an ethylene response, resulting in the reduced sensitivity to ethylene in our growth response assays. Similarly, we also observed a reduced ability by the kinase-inactive ETR1 to regulate gene expression in response to ethylene, particularly when considered on a per protein basis with wild-type ETR1. In some cases, the effects on gene expression were strong enough that the kinase-inactive ETR1 lines differed from the wild-type ETR1 lines, regardless of the ETR1 protein level. This effect was most apparent when examining the basal expression levels of ethylene-induced genes, which were consistently lower in the kinase-inactive ETR1 lines. Only endogenous ethylene is present under basal expression conditions, some ethylene being produced by seedlings even when the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor AVG is incorporated into the growth medium ( Sanders et al., 1991 ). This low level of ethylene is apparently sufficient to induce expression of the genes in the wild-type ETR1 lines to a greater extent than in the kinase-inactive ETR1 lines. A more substantial role for autophosphorylation at low ethylene levels is consistent with our growth response curves ( Fig. 3 ), where growth differences between wild-type ETR1 and kinase-inactive ETR1 lines decreased at the higher ethylene concentrations (e.g. 100 and 1,000 ÂµL L âˆ’1 ). A role of phosphorylation in establishing an ethylene response is consistent with several previous genetic analyses in which phenotypes of kinase-deficient forms of ETR1 were chiefly observed after ethylene treatment ( Binder et al., 2004 ; Qu and Schaller, 2004 ).

On the other hand, this model for the ethylene regulation of kinase activity is not consistent with the in vitro analysis of a bacterially expressed version of ETR1, in which ethylene is reported to repress autophosphorylation of the receptor ( Voet-van-Vormizeele and Groth, 2008 ). If ethylene binding indeed suppresses the kinase activity of ETR1, more complicated models are suggested for how phosphorylation might serve to facilitate the ethylene response. Perhaps phospho-dependent signaling in the absence of ethylene induces the expression of a positive regulator of the ethylene response, with this positive regulator persisting during the time period of the ethylene response. However, it is not certain how well the in vitro bacterially based system mimics native ETR1, as preparation of the recombinant protein involved denaturation and renaturation ( Voet-van-Vormizeele and Groth, 2008 ), potentially separating or perturbing the dimeric structure necessary for signal perception ( Schaller et al., 1995 ; RodrÃ­guez et al., 1999 ). The apparent inconsistency between the genetic and in vitro results suggests that it will be important to biochemically analyze the kinase activity of ETR1 using systems that more closely emulate signaling in plants.
