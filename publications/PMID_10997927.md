Expression and role of sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT-1) in tubulogenesis 
were investigated during renal development. A mouse SGLT-1 cDNA was cloned, and 
it had substantial homology with human and rat forms. Four mRNA transcripts were 
detected, which differed in size from other species. SGLT-1 transcripts were 
detected at day 13 of gestation, and their expression increased during later 
stages extending into the postnatal period. A high mRNA and protein expression 
of SGLT-1 was seen in tubular segments of the inner cortex and outer medulla at 
day 16, and it was developmentally regulated. Treatment with SGLT-1 antisense 
selectively decreased the population of tubules in the metanephric explants. 
Expression of glomerular mRNA and WGA binding were unchanged. SGLT-1 activity, 
as measured by [(14)C]methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside uptake, increased during 
gestation in the tubular segments where it is expressed. Glucose uptake was 
inhibited by the treatment with SGLT-1 antisense and D-galactose. The data 
suggest that SGLT-1 exhibits a restricted spatiotemporal expression with 
functional activity confined to the corresponding tubular segments, and it 
selectively maintains renal tubulogenesis during development.
