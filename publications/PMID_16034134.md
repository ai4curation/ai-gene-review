Vascular endothelial cells (EC) perform critical functions that require a 
balance of cell survival and cell death. EC death by apoptosis and EC activation 
and injury by the membrane attack complex of complement are important mechanisms 
in atherosclerosis and organ graft rejection. Although the effects of various 
cytokines on EC apoptosis have been studied, little is known about their effects 
on complement-mediated EC injury. Therefore, we studied the abilities of various 
cytokines to induce protection of porcine aortic EC against apoptosis and 
killing by human complement, a model of pig-to-human xenotransplantation. We 
found that porcine EC incubated with IL-4 or IL-13, but not with IL-10 or IL-11, 
became protected from killing by complement and apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha 
plus cycloheximide. Maximal protection required 10 ng/ml IL-4 or IL-13, 
developed progressively from 12 to 72 h of incubation, and lasted 48-72 h after 
cytokine removal. Protection from complement was not associated with reduced 
complement activation, C9 binding, or changes in CD59 expression. Inhibition of 
PI3K prevented development of protection; however, inhibition of p38 MAPK or 
p42/44 MAPK had no effect. IL-4 and IL-13 induced rapid phosphorylation of Akt. 
Although protection was inhibited by an Akt inhibitor and a dominant negative 
Akt mutant transduced into EC, it was induced by transduction of EC with the 
constitutively active Akt variant, myristylated Akt. We conclude that IL-4 and 
IL-13 can induce protection of porcine EC against killing by apoptosis and human 
complement through activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
