CsrA is a widely distributed RNA binding protein that regulates translation 
initiation and/or mRNA stability of target transcripts. CsrA activity is 
antagonized by sRNA(s) containing multiple CsrA binding sites in several 
Gram-negative bacterial species. Here we discover FliW, the first protein 
antagonist of CsrA activity that constitutes a partner switching mechanism to 
control flagellin synthesis in the Gram-positive organism Bacillus subtilis. 
Following the flagellar assembly checkpoint of hook completion, secretion of 
flagellin (Hag) releases FliW protein from a FliW-Hag complex. FliW then binds 
to CsrA and relieves CsrA-mediated translational repression of hag for flagellin 
synthesis concurrent with filament assembly. Thus, flagellin homeostatically 
restricts its own translation. Homeostatic autoregulation may be a general 
mechanism to precisely control structural subunits required at specific times 
and in finite amounts such as those involved in the assembly of flagella, type 
III secretion machines and pili. Finally, phylogenetic analysis suggests that 
CsrA, a highly pleiotropic virulence regulator in many bacterial pathogens, had 
an ancestral role in flagellar assembly and evolved to co-regulate various 
cellular processes with motility.
