In preclinical studies, endothelin receptor A (ETA) antagonists (ETAi) 
attenuated the progression of heart failure (HF). However, clinical HF trials 
failed to demonstrate beneficial effects of ETAi. These conflicting data may be 
explained by the possibility that established HF drugs such as adrenergic 
receptor blockers interfered with the mechanism of ETAi action in clinical 
trials. Here we report that mice lacking ETA only in sympathetic neurons (SN-KO) 
showed less adverse structural remodeling and cardiac dysfunction in response to 
pathological pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). 
In contrast, mice lacking ETA only in cardiomyocytes (CM-KO) were not protected. 
TAC led to a disturbed sympathetic nerve function as measured by cardiac 
norepinephrine (NE) tissue levels and [(124)I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine-PET, 
which was prevented in SN-KO. In a rat model of HF, ETAi improved cardiac and 
sympathetic nerve function. In cocultures of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and 
sympathetic neurons (SNs), endothelin-1 (ET1) led to a massive NE release and 
exaggerated CM hypertrophy compared with CM monocultures. ETA-deficient CMs 
gained a hypertrophic response through wild-type SNs, but ETA-deficient SNs 
failed to mediate exaggerated CM hypertrophy. Furthermore, ET1 mediated its 
effects indirectly via NE in CM-SN cocultures through adrenergic receptors and 
histone deacetylases, resulting in activation of the prohypertrophic 
transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2. In conclusion, sympathetic ETA 
amplifies ET1 effects on CMs through adrenergic signaling pathways. Thus, 
antiadrenergic therapies may blunt potentially beneficial effects of ETAi. Taken 
together, this may indicate that patients with β blocker intolerance or 
disturbed sympathetic nerve function could be evaluated for a potential benefit 
from ETAi.
