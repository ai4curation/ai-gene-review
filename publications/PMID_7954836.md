The brain dopaminergic system is a critical modulator of basal ganglia function 
and plasticity. To investigate the contribution of the dopamine D1 receptor to 
this modulation, we have used gene targeting technology to generate D1 receptor 
mutant mice. Histological analyses suggested that there are no major changes in 
general anatomy of the mutant mouse brains, but indicated that the expression of 
dynorphin is greatly reduced in the striatum and related regions of the basal 
ganglia. The mutant mice do not respond to the stimulant and suppressive effects 
of D1 receptor agonists and antagonists, respectively, and they exhibit 
locomotor hyperactivity. These results suggest that the D1 receptor regulates 
the neurochemical architecture of the striatum and is critical for the normal 
expression of motor activity.
