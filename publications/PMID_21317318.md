CpxP is a novel bacterial periplasmic protein with no homologues of known 
function. In gram-negative enteric bacteria, CpxP is thought to interact with 
the two-component sensor kinase, CpxA, to inhibit induction of the Cpx envelope 
stress response in the absence of protein misfolding. CpxP has also been shown 
to facilitate DegP-mediated proteolysis of misfolded proteins. Six mutations 
that negate the ability of CpxP to function as a signaling protein are localized 
in or near two conserved LTXXQ motifs that define a class of proteins with 
similarity to CpxP, Pfam PF07813. To gain insight into how these mutations might 
affect CpxP signaling and/or proteolytic adaptor functions, the crystal 
structure of CpxP from Escherichia coli was determined to 2.85-Å resolution. The 
structure revealed an antiparallel dimer of intertwined α-helices with a highly 
basic concave surface. Each protomer consists of a long, hooked and bent hairpin 
fold, with the conserved LTXXQ motifs forming two diverging turns at one end. 
Biochemical studies demonstrated that CpxP maintains a dimeric state but may 
undergo a slight structural adjustment in response to the inducing cue, alkaline 
pH. Three of the six previously characterized cpxP loss-of-function mutations, 
M59T, Q55P, and Q128H, likely result from a destabilization of the protein fold, 
whereas the R60Q, D61E, and D61V mutations may alter intermolecular 
interactions.
