Ubiquitin-dependent processes can be antagonized by substrate-specific 
deubiquitination enzymes involved in many cellular functions. In this study, we 
show that the yeast Ubp3-Bre5 deubiquitination complex interacts with both the 
chaperone-like Cdc48, a major actor of the ubiquitin and proteasome system, and 
Ufd3, a ubiquitin-binding cofactor of Cdc48. We observed that these partners are 
required for the Ubp3-Bre5-dependent and starvation-induced selective 
degradation of yeast mature ribosomes, also called ribophagy. By contrast, 
proteasome-dependent degradation does not participate in this process. Our data 
favour the idea that these factors cooperate to recognize and deubiquitinate 
specific substrates of ribophagy before their vacuolar degradation.
