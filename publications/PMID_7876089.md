## Abstract

1. J Biol Chem. 1995 Feb 24;270(8):3551-3. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.8.3551.

ERGIC-53, a membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate 
compartment, is identical to MR60, an intracellular mannose-specific lectin of 
myelomonocytic cells.

A mannose-specific membrane lectin (MR60) isolated from human myelomonocytic 
HL60 cells by affinity chromatography is expressed in intracellular organelles 
of immature monocytes (Pimpaneau, V., Midoux, P., Monsigny, M., and Roche, A. C. 
(1991) Carbohydr. Res. 213, 95-108). It is not present at the cell surface and 
is immunochemically and structurally distinct from the M(r) 175,000 mannose 
receptor of mature macrophages. MR60 cDNA was isolated and characterized; on the 
basis of its sequence, MR60 is not related to any known mammalian lectins. 
Surprisingly, MR60 was found to be identical to ERGIC-53 (Schindler, R., Itin, 
C., Zerial, M., Lottspeich, F., and Hauri, H.P. (1993) Eur. J. Cell Biol. 61, 
1-9), a type I integral membrane protein, defined as a marker of the 
intermediate compartment that recycles between the Golgi apparatus and 
endoplasmic reticulum; MR60/ERGIC-53 shares with VIP-36 significant homologies 
with leguminous plant lectins (Fiedler, K., and Simmons, K. (1994) Cell 77, 
625-626). We extend these findings in evidencing a structural homology between 
MR60/ERGIC-53 and mammalian galectins (soluble beta galactose binding proteins). 
MR60/ERGIC-53 is the first lectin characterized as an endoplasmic 
reticulum-Golgi protein. Accordingly, this intracellular mannose binding protein 
could be involved in the traffic of glycoproteins between endoplasmic reticulum 
and the Golgi apparatus.
