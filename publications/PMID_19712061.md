Mutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most 
common cause of autosomal-dominant familial and late-onset sporadic Parkinson's 
disease (PD). LRRK2 is a large multi-domain protein featuring a GTP-binding 
C-terminal of Ras of complex proteins (ROC) (ROCO) domain combination unique for 
the ROCO protein family, directly followed by a kinase domain. Dimerization is a 
well-established phenomenon among protein kinases. Here, we confirm LRRK2 
self-interaction, and provide evidence for general homo- and heterodimerization 
potential among the ROCO kinase family (LRRK2, LRRK1, and death-associated 
protein kinase 1). The ROCO domain was critically, though not exclusively 
involved in dimerization, as a LRRK2 deletion mutant lacking the ROCO domain 
retained dimeric properties. GTP binding did not appear to influence ROCO(LRRK2) 
self-interaction. Interestingly, ROCO(LRRK2) fragments exerted an inhibitory 
effect on both wild-type and the elevated G2019S LRRK2 autophosphorylation 
activity. Insertion of PD mutations into ROCO(LRRK2) reduced self-interaction 
and led to a reduction of LRRK2 kinase inhibition. Collectively, these results 
suggest a functional link between ROCO interactions and kinase activity of 
wild-type and mutant LRRK2. Importantly, our finding of ROCO(LRRK2) 
fragment-mediated LRRK2 kinase inhibition offers a novel lead for drug design 
and thus might have important implications for new therapeutic avenues in PD.
