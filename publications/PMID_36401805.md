Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the photoreceptor protein phytochrome B (phyB) 
play a key role in plant acclimation to stress. However, how phyB that primarily 
functions in the nuclei impacts ROS signaling mediated by respiratory burst 
oxidase homolog (RBOH) proteins that reside on the plasma membrane, during 
stress, is unknown. Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa mutants, RNA-Seq, 
bioinformatics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and whole-plant ROS imaging 
were used to address this question. Here, we reveal that phyB and RBOHs function 
as part of a key regulatory module that controls apoplastic ROS production, 
stress-response transcript expression, and plant acclimation in response to 
excess light stress. We further show that phyB can regulate ROS production 
during stress even if it is restricted to the cytosol and that phyB, respiratory 
burst oxidase protein D (RBOHD), and respiratory burst oxidase protein F (RBOHF) 
coregulate thousands of transcripts in response to light stress. Surprisingly, 
we found that phyB is also required for ROS accumulation in response to heat, 
wounding, cold, and bacterial infection. Our findings reveal that phyB plays a 
canonical role in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, regulating 
apoplastic ROS production, possibly while at the cytosol, and that phyB and 
RBOHD/RBOHF function in the same regulatory pathway.
