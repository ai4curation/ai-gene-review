Synaptic vesicle recycling has long served as a model for the general mechanisms 
of cellular trafficking. We used an integrative approach, combining quantitative 
immunoblotting and mass spectrometry to determine protein numbers; electron 
microscopy to measure organelle numbers, sizes, and positions; and 
super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to localize the proteins. Using these 
data, we generated a three-dimensional model of an "average" synapse, displaying 
300,000 proteins in atomic detail. The copy numbers of proteins involved in the 
same step of synaptic vesicle recycling correlated closely. In contrast, copy 
numbers varied over more than three orders of magnitude between steps, from 
about 150 copies for the endosomal fusion proteins to more than 20,000 for the 
exocytotic ones.
