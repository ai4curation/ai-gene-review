Wnt signaling plays a critical role in embryonic development, and genetic 
aberrations in this network have been broadly implicated in colorectal cancer. 
We find that the Wnt receptor Frizzled2 (Fzd2) and its ligands Wnt5a/b are 
elevated in metastatic liver, lung, colon, and breast cancer cell lines and in 
high-grade tumors and that their expression correlates with markers of 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Pharmacologic and genetic perturbations 
reveal that Fzd2 drives EMT and cell migration through a previously 
unrecognized, noncanonical pathway that includes Fyn and Stat3. A gene signature 
regulated by this pathway predicts metastasis and overall survival in patients. 
We have developed an antibody to Fzd2 that reduces cell migration and invasion 
and inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in xenografts. We propose that 
targeting this pathway could provide benefit for patients with tumors expressing 
high levels of Fzd2 and Wnt5a/b.
