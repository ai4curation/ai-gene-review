The sulfatase enzymes, N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (arylsulfatase B (ASB)) 
and galactose-6-sulfatase (GALNS) hydrolyze sulfate groups of CS. Deficiencies 
of ASB and GALNS are associated with the mucopolysaccharidoses. To determine if 
expression of ASB and GALNS impacts on glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and 
proteoglycans beyond their association with the mucopolysaccharidoses, we 
modified the expression of ASB and GALNS by overexpression and by silencing with 
small interference RNA in MCF-7 cells. Content of total sulfated GAG (sGAG), 
chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S), and total chondroitin sulfates (CSs) was measured 
following immunoprecipitation with C4S and CS antibodies and treatment with 
chondroitinase ABC. Following silencing of ASB or GALNS, total sGAG, C4S, and CS 
increased significantly. Following overexpression of ASB or GALNS, total sGAG, 
C4S, and CS declined significantly. Measurements following chondroitinase ABC 
treatment of the cell lysates demonstrated no change in the content of the other 
sGAG, including heparin, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate. 
Following overexpression of ASB and immunoprecipitation with C4S antibody, 
virtually no sGAG was detectable. Total sGAG content increased to 23.39 
(+/-1.06) microg/mg of protein from baseline of 12.47 (+/-0.68) microg/mg of 
protein following ASB silencing. mRNA expression of core proteins of the 
CS-containing proteoglycans, syndecan-1 and decorin, was significantly 
up-regulated following overexpression of ASB and GALNS. Soluble syndecan-1 
protein increased following increases in ASB and GALNS and reduced following 
silencing, inversely to changes in CS. These findings demonstrate that 
modification of expression of the lysosomal sulfatases ASB and GALNS regulates 
the content of CSs.
