The structural organization of the entire human nuclear encoded gene for 
mitochondrial cytochrome c1 was determined by analyzing a clone obtained from an 
EMBL3 genomic DNA library. The gene spans 2.4-kilobase pairs and contains seven 
exons interrupted by six introns of relatively small sizes. All intron/exon 
splice junctions follow the GT/AG rule. The 5'-flanking region of the gene lacks 
typical transcriptional regulatory sequence elements such as TATA and CAAT boxes 
but contains seven putative GC boxes (Sp1 binding sites) and several sequences 
that resemble another type of the Sp1 responsive element, the enhancer core 
consensus sequence, the AP-1 responsive element, and the cAMP- and phorbol 
ester-inducible element. The region also contains a 15-nucleotide sequence 
highly homologous to the AP-4 consensus sequence and to those in the 5'-flanking 
regions of the genes for two enzymes associated with respiratory function, the 
beta subunit of human ATP synthase and chicken 5-aminolevulinate synthase. The 
presequence, which is essential for the transport of the cytochrome c1 precursor 
into mitochondria, is encoded in both the first and second exons, and the 
nucleotide sequence corresponding to the presequence is separated by the first 
intron. This is the first example of a leader sequence coding for a presequence 
clearly separated into two parts by an intron.
