Cross-linking B cell antigen receptor (BCR) elicits early signal transduction 
events, including activation of protein tyrosine kinases, phosphorylation of 
receptor components, activation of phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma), and 
increases in intracellular free Ca2+. In this article, we report that 
cross-linking the BCR led to a rapid translocation of cytosolic protein tyrosine 
phosphatase (PTP) 1C to the particulate fraction, where it became associated 
with a 140-150-kD tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein. Western blotting analysis 
identified this 140-150-kD protein to be CD22. The association of PTP-1C with 
CD22 was mediated by the NH2-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of PTP-1C. 
Complexes of either CD22/PTP-1C/Syk/PLC-gamma(1) could be isolated from B cells 
stimulated by BCR engagement or a mixture of hydrogen peroxidase and sodium 
orthovanadate, respectively. The binding of PLC-gamma(1) and Syk to 
tyrosyl-phosphorylated CD22 was mediated by the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of 
PLC-gamma(1) and the COOH-terminal SH2 domain of Syk, respectively. These 
observations suggest that tyrosyl-phosphorylated CD22 may downmodulate the 
activity of this complex by dephosphorylation of CD22, Syk, and/or PLC-gamma(1). 
Transient expression of CD22 and a null mutant of PTP-1C (PTP-1CM) in COS cells 
resulted in an increase in tyrosyl phosphorylation of CD22 and its interaction 
with PTP-1CM. By contrast, CD22 was not tyrosyl phosphorylated or associated 
with PTP-1CM in the presence of wild-type PTP-1C. These results suggest that 
tyrosyl-phosphorylated CD22 may be a substrate for PTP-1C regulates tyrosyl 
phosphorylation of CD22.
