Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently emerged as a global health concern owing to its 
widespread diffusion and its association with severe neurological symptoms and 
microcephaly in newborns1. However, the molecular mechanisms that are 
responsible for the pathogenicity of ZIKV remain largely unknown. Here we use 
human neural progenitor cells and the neuronal cell line SK-N-BE2 in an 
integrated proteomics approach to characterize the cellular responses to viral 
infection at the proteome and phosphoproteome level, and use affinity proteomics 
to identify cellular targets of ZIKV proteins. Using this approach, we identify 
386 ZIKV-interacting proteins, ZIKV-specific and pan-flaviviral activities as 
well as host factors with known functions in neuronal development, retinal 
defects and infertility. Moreover, our analysis identified 1,216 phosphorylation 
sites that are specifically up- or downregulated after ZIKV infection, 
indicating profound modulation of fundamental signalling pathways such as AKT, 
MAPK-ERK and ATM-ATR and thereby providing mechanistic insights into the 
proliferation arrest elicited by ZIKV infection. Functionally, our integrative 
study identifies ZIKV host-dependency factors and provides a comprehensive 
framework for a system-level understanding of ZIKV-induced perturbations at the 
levels of proteins and cellular pathways.
