1. Exogenously administered endothelin (ET) modulates the activity of 
cardiovascular and respiratory neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and, 
thus, affects arterial blood pressure (ABP) and ventilation. However, a 
physiological role(s) for endogenous ET in the CNS has not been elucidated. To 
address this question, we examined ABP and ventilation in mutant mice deficient 
in ET-1, ETA and ETB receptors and endothelin-converting enzyme-1, which were 
made by gene targeting. 2. Respiratory frequency and volume was measured in mice 
by whole body plethysmography when animals breathed normal room air and hypoxic 
and hypercapnic gas mixtures. A few days after respiratory measurements, a 
catheter was implanted into the femoral artery under halothane anaesthesia. On 
the following day, the ABP of awake mice was measured through the indwelling 
catheter and heart rate was calculated from the ABP signal. After 2 h ABP 
measurement, arterial blood was collected through the catheter and pH and the 
partial pressures of O2 and CO2 were measured by a blood gas analyser. 3. 
Compared with corresponding controls, the mean (+/- SEM) ABP in ET-1+/- and 
ETB-deficient mice was significantly higher (118 +/- 2 vs 106 +/- 3 mmHg for 
ET-1+/- (n = 22) and ET-1+/+ (n = 17) mice, respectively; 127 +/- 3 vs 109 +/- 4 
mmHg for ETB-/s (n = 9) and ETB+/s (n = 9) mice, respectively; P < 0.05 for 
both). In ET-1+/- mice, PCO2 tended to be higher and PO2 was significantly lower 
than corresponding values in ET-1+/+ mice. Under resting conditions, there was 
no significant difference in respiratory parameters between mutants and their 
corresponding controls. However, reflex increases of ventilation to hypoxia and 
hypercapnia were significantly attenuated in ET-1+/-, ET-1-/- and ETA-/- mice. 
4. In another series of experiments in ET-1+/- mice, we found that sympathetic 
nerve activity (SNA) was augmented and reflex excitation of phrenic nerve 
activity (PNA) in response to hypoxia and hypercapnia was blunted. Attenuation 
of the reflex PNA response to hypercapnia was also observed in the 
medulla-spinal cord preparation from ET-1-/- mice. 5. Elevation of ABP in 
ETB-deficient mice was most likely due to a peripheral mechanism, because SNA 
and respiratory reflexes were not different from those in control animals. 6. We 
conclude that endogenous ET-1 plays an important role in the central neural 
control of circulation and respiration and that ETA receptors mediate this 
mechanism.
