TAFII70, a member of the basal transcription complex implicated in p53-mediated 
transcription, is synthesized as several alternately spliced variants. The 
predominant forms found in normal and neoplastic breast epithelial cells are 
shown to be 72 kDa (TAFII70) and 78 kDa (TAFII80). Most cancers express higher 
levels of the TAFII80 isoform, whereas normal breast epithelia express higher 
levels of the TAFII70 isoform. Expression of TAFII70, but not TAFII80, causes 
dramatic growth suppression of normal and transformed breast epithelial cell 
lines in a p53-independent manner. Growth suppression correlates with mitotic 
inhibition resulting from an increased number of cells in G2. Both isoforms 
induce expression of the G2 arrest associated gene, GADD45a, but a novel 
protein-protein interaction was observed between TAFII70 (not TAFII80) and 
GADD45a, suggesting that this interaction is important for the observed growth 
arrest phenotype induced by the TAFII70 isoform. GADD45a null cells are not 
subject to TAFII70 inhibition, further supporting the relevance of this 
interaction.
