The PRP45 gene has been identified as encoding a protein involved in mRNA 
splicing that is essential in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. PRP45's human homolog 
SKIP has been identified as a mediator of transcriptional programming in a 
variety of signal transduction pathways including TGFbeta, nuclear hormones, 
Notch, and retinoblastoma signaling. However, Skip has been also identified in 
purified spliceosomal complexes but an explicit role in splicing has not been 
identified in mammalian cells. To determine if the Skip protein could function 
as a splicing factor we investigated if the SKIP gene could functionally 
complement the yeast PRP45 gene. We show that SKIP complements the PRP45 
deletion and rescues the lethal phenotype. These results show that the human 
SKIP gene can functionally substitute for the mRNA splicing gene PRP45 of S. 
cerevisiae.
