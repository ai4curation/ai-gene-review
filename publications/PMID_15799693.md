Exposure of unirradiated human keratinocytes to irradiated cell conditioned 
medium (ICCM) is known to cause a cascade of events that leads to reproductive 
death and apoptosis. This study investigates the effect of ICCM on clonogenic 
survival, mitochondrial mass and BCL2 expression in unirradiated keratinocytes. 
Exposure to 5 mGy, 0.5 Gy and 5 Gy ICCM resulted in a significant decrease in 
clonogenic survival. Human keratinocytes incubated with ICCM containing an 
antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, showed no significant decrease in clonogenic 
survival. HPV-G cells incubated with ICCM containing a caspase 9 inhibitor 
showed no significant decrease in clonogenic survival when the ICCM dose was < 
or =0.5 Gy. A significant increase in mitochondrial mass per cell was observed 
after exposure to 5 mGy and 0.5 Gy ICCM. A change in the distribution of the 
mitochondria from a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution to a more densely 
concentrated perinuclear distribution was also observed at these doses. No 
significant increase in mitochondrial mass or change in distribution of the 
mitochondria was found for 5 Gy ICCM. Low BCL2 expression was observed in HPV-G 
cells exposed to 5 mGy or 0.5 Gy ICCM, whereas a large significant increase in 
BCL2 expression was observed in cells exposed to 5 Gy ICCM. This study has shown 
that low-dose irradiation can cause cells to produce medium-borne signals that 
can cause mitochondrial changes and the induction of BCL2 expression in 
unirradiated HPV-G cells. The dose dependence of the mitochondrial changes and 
BCL2 expression suggests that the mechanisms may be aimed at control of response 
to radiation at the population level through signaling pathways.
