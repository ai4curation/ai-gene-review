We characterized human SirT1, one of the human homologs of the budding yeast 
Sir2p, an NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase involved in establishing repressive 
chromatin and increased life span. SirT1 deacetylates histone polypeptides with 
a preference for histone H4 lysine 16 (H4-K16Ac) and H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9Ac) in 
vitro. RNAi-mediated decreased expression of SirT1 in human cells causes 
hyperacetylation of H4-K16 and H3-K9 in vivo. SirT1 interacts with and 
deacetylates histone H1 at lysine 26. Using an inducible system directing 
expression of SirT1 fused to the Gal4-DNA binding domain and a Gal4-reporter 
integrated in euchromatin, Gal4-SirT1 expression resulted in the deacetylation 
of H4-K16 and H3-K9, recruitment of H1 within the promoter vicinity, drastically 
reduced reporter expression, and loss of H3-K79 methylation, a mark restricting 
silenced chromatin. We propose a model for SirT1-mediated heterochromatin 
formation that includes deacetylation of histone tails, recruitment and 
deacetylation of histone H1, and spreading of hypomethylated H3-K79 with 
resultant silencing.
