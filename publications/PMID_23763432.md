Progesterone (P4) regulates a wide range of cognitive, neuroendocrine, 
neuroimmune and neuroprotective functions. Therefore, it is not surprising that 
this ovarian hormone acts through multiple receptors. Ever since the 1980s, 
studies investigating the neural effects of P4 have focused mainly on genomic 
and nongenomic actions of the classical progestin receptor (PGR). More recently, 
two groups of nonclassical P4 signalling molecules have been identified: (i) the 
class II progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family, which includes PAQR 5, 6, 
7, 8 and 9, also called membrane progestin receptor α (mPRα; PAQR7), mPRβ 
(PAQR8), mPRγ (PAQR5), mPRδ (PAQR6) and mPRε (PAQR9), and (ii) the b5-like 
haeme/steroid-binding protein family, which includes progesterone receptor 
membrane component 1 (Pgrmc1), Pgrmc2, neudesin and neuferricin. In this review, 
we describe the structures, neuroanatomical localisation and signalling 
mechanisms of these molecules. We also discuss gonadotrophin-releasing hormone 
regulation as an example of a physiological function regulated by multiple 
progesterone receptors but through different mechanisms.
