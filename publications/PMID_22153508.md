We report structural models for the most abundant oligomers populated by the 
polydisperse molecular chaperone αB-crystallin. Subunit connectivity is 
determined by using restraints obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy and mass spectrometry measurements, enabling the construction of 
various oligomeric models. These candidate structures are filtered according to 
their correspondence with ion-mobility spectrometry data and cross-validated by 
using electron microscopy. The ensuing best-fit structures reveal the polyhedral 
architecture of αB-crystallin oligomers, and provide a rationale for their 
polydispersity and facile interconversion.
