The activation of endothelin-A receptor (ET(A)R) by endothelin-1 (ET-1) has a 
critical role in ovarian tumorigenesis and progression. To define the molecular 
mechanism in ET-1-induced tumor invasion and metastasis, we focused on 
beta-arrestins as scaffold and signaling proteins of G protein-coupled 
receptors. Here, we demonstrate that, in ovarian cancer cells, beta-arrestin is 
recruited to ET(A)R to form two trimeric complexes: one through the interaction 
with Src leading to epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation and 
beta-catenin Tyr phosphorylation, and the second through the physical 
association with axin, contributing to release and inactivation of glycogen 
synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta and beta-catenin stabilization. The engagement of 
beta-arrestin in these two signaling complexes concurs to activate beta-catenin 
signaling pathways. We then demonstrate that silencing of both beta-arrestin-1 
and beta-arrestin-2 inhibits ET(A)R-driven signaling, causing suppression of 
Src, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), AKT activation, as well as EGFR 
transactivation and a complete inhibition of ET-1-induced beta-catenin/TCF 
transcriptional activity and cell invasion. ET(A)R blockade with the specific 
ET(A)R antagonist ZD4054 abrogates the engagement of beta-arrestin in the 
interplay between ET(A)R and the beta-catenin pathway in the invasive program. 
Finally, ET(A)R is expressed in 85% of human ovarian cancers and is 
preferentially co-expressed with beta-arrestin-1 in the advanced tumors. In a 
xenograft model of ovarian metastasis, HEY cancer cells expressing 
beta-arrestin-1 mutant metastasize at a reduced rate, highlighting the 
importance of this molecule in promoting metastases. ZD4054 treatment 
significantly inhibits metastases, suggesting that specific ET(A)R antagonists, 
by disabling multiple signaling activated by ET(A)R/beta-arrestin, may represent 
new therapeutic opportunities for ovarian cancer.
