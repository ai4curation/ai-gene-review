The highly conserved eukaryotic process of macroautophagy (autophagy) is a 
non-specific bulk-degradation program critical for maintaining proper cellular 
homeostasis, and for clearing aged and damaged organelles. This decision is 
inextricably dependent upon prevailing metabolic demands and energy requirements 
of the cell. Soluble monomeric decorin functions as a natural tumor repressor 
that antagonizes a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases. Recently, we discovered 
that decorin induces endothelial cell autophagy, downstream of VEGFR2. This 
process was wholly dependent upon Peg3, a decorin-inducible genomically 
imprinted tumor suppressor gene. However, the signaling cascades responsible 
have remained elusive. In this report we discovered that Vps34, a class III 
phosphoinositide kinase, is an upstream kinase required for Peg3 induction. 
Moreover, decorin triggered differential formation of Vps34/Beclin 1 complexes 
with concomitant dissolution of inhibitive Bcl-2/Beclin 1 complexes. Further, 
decorin inhibited anti-autophagic signaling via suppression of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K 
activity with the concurrent activation of pro-autophagic AMPK-mediated 
signaling cascades. Mechanistically, AMPK is downstream of VEGFR2 and inhibition 
of AMPK signaling abrogated decorin-evoked autophagy. Collectively, these 
findings hint at the complexity of the underlying molecular relays necessary for 
decorin-evoked endothelial cell autophagy and reveal important therapeutic 
targets for augmenting autophagy and combatting tumor angiogenesis.
