The protein encoded by the c-MYC proto-oncogene is a transcription factor that 
can both activate and repress the expression of target genes, but few of its 
transcriptional targets have been identified. Here, c-MYC is shown to repress 
the expression of the heavy subunit of the protein ferritin (H-ferritin), which 
sequesters intracellular iron, and to stimulate the expression of the iron 
regulatory protein-2 (IRP2), which increases the intracellular iron pool. 
Down-regulation of the expression of H-ferritin gene was required for cell 
transformation by c-MYC. These results indicate that c-MYC coordinately 
regulates genes controlling intracellular iron concentrations and that this 
function is essential for the control of cell proliferation and transformation 
by c-MYC.
