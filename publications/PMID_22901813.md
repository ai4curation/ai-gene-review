Due to genome instability, most cancers exhibit loss of regions containing tumor 
suppressor genes and collateral loss of other genes. To identify cancer-specific 
vulnerabilities that are the result of copy number losses, we performed 
integrated analyses of genome-wide copy number and RNAi profiles and identified 
56 genes for which gene suppression specifically inhibited the proliferation of 
cells harboring partial copy number loss of that gene. These CYCLOPS (copy 
number alterations yielding cancer liabilities owing to partial loss) genes are 
enriched for spliceosome, proteasome, and ribosome components. One CYCLOPS gene, 
PSMC2, encodes an essential member of the 19S proteasome. Normal cells express 
excess PSMC2, which resides in a complex with PSMC1, PSMD2, and PSMD5 and acts 
as a reservoir protecting cells from PSMC2 suppression. Cells harboring partial 
PSMC2 copy number loss lack this complex and die after PSMC2 suppression. These 
observations define a distinct class of cancer-specific liabilities resulting 
from genome instability.
