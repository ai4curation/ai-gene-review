Recent studies have implicated interferon signaling in the regulation of 
cellular senescence. However, the role of specific interferon-inducible proteins 
in cellular senescence remains to be defined. Here we report that IFI 16, an 
interferon-inducible transcriptional modulator from the p200-protein family, 
contributes to cellular senescence of prostate epithelial cells. Normal human 
prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) in culture expressed detectable levels of IFI 
16, and the levels increased more than fourfold when cells approached cellular 
senescence. Consistent with a role of IFI 16 in cellular senescence, human 
prostate cancer cell lines either did not express IFI 16 or expressed a variant 
form, which was primarily detected in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer cells and 
not in the nucleus. Moreover, overexpression of functional IFI 16 in human 
prostate cancer cell lines inhibited colony formation. Additionally, ectopic 
expression of IFI 16 in clonal prostate cancer cell lines was associated with a 
senescence-like phenotype, production of senescence-associated 
beta-galactosidase (a biochemical marker for cellular senescence), and reduction 
of S-phase cells in culture. Importantly, upregulation of p21WAF1 and inhibition 
of E2F-stimulated transcription accompanied inhibition of cell growth by IFI 16 
in prostate cancer cell lines. Collectively, our observations support the idea 
that increased levels of IFI 16 in PrECs contribute to senescence-associated 
irreversible cell growth arrest.
