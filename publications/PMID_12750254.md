We identified and characterized two new ING family genes, p29ING4 and 
p28ING5,coding for two proteins of 249 and 240 amino acids, respectively. Both 
p29ING4 and p28ING5 proteins have a plant homeodomain finger motif also found in 
other ING proteins, and which is common in proteins involved in chromatin 
remodeling. p29ING4 or p28ING5 overexpression resulted in a diminished 
colony-forming efficiency, a decreased cell population in S phase, and the 
induction of apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. Both p29ING4 and p28ING5 
activate the p21/waf1 promoter, and induce p21/WAF1 expression. p29ING4 and 
p28ING5 enhance p53 acetylation at Lys-382 residues, and physically interact 
with p300, a member of histone acetyl transferase complexes, and p53 in vivo. 
These results indicate that p29ING4 and p28ING5 may be significant modulators of 
p53 function.
