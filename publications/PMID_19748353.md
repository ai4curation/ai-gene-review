The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a central regulator of eukaryotic 
cell growth that is activated by a variety of hormones (e.g., insulin) and 
nutrients (e.g., amino acids) and is deregulated in various cancers. Here, we 
report that the yeast Rag GTPase homolog Gtr1, a component of the 
vacuolar-membrane-associated EGO complex (EGOC), interacts with and activates 
TORC1 in an amino-acid-sensitive manner. Expression of a constitutively active 
(GTP-bound) Gtr1(GTP), which interacted strongly with TORC1, rendered TORC1 
partially resistant to leucine deprivation, whereas expression of a growth 
inhibitory, GDP-bound Gtr1(GDP), caused constitutively low TORC1 activity. We 
also show that the nucleotide-binding status of Gtr1 is regulated by the 
conserved guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Vam6. Thus, in addition to 
its regulatory role in homotypic vacuolar fusion and vacuole protein sorting 
within the HOPS complex, Vam6 also controls TORC1 function by activating the 
Gtr1 subunit of the EGO complex.
