The role of alphagamma and betagamma dimers as intermediates in the assembly of 
fibrinogen was examined in cell fusion experiments using stably transfected baby 
hamster kidney cell lines expressing one or combinations of fibrinogen chains. 
Fibrinogen was readily formed and secreted into the culture media when cells 
co-expressing beta and gamma chains and generating betagamma complexes were 
fused with cells expressing only the alpha chain. Likewise, when cells 
co-expressing alpha and gamma chains and generating alphagamma complexes were 
fused with cells expressing only the beta chain, fibrinogen was also formed and 
secreted. The relative amounts of alphagamma or betagamma intermediates observed 
during fibrinogen biosynthesis were determined by the levels of the component 
chains; i.e. when the beta chain was limiting, the alphagamma dimer was the 
predominant intermediate; likewise, when the alpha chain was limiting, the 
betagamma complex was the predominant intermediate. The incorporation of 
preformed alphagamma and betagamma complexes into secreted fibrinogen did not 
require concurrent protein synthesis, as shown by experiments employing 
cycloheximide. These data strongly support the role of alphagamma and betagamma 
complexes as functional intermediates in the assembly of fibrinogen.
