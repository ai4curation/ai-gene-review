We recently cloned mouse Thy28 cDNA (mThy28), which is highly conserved among 
vertebrates and plants. The mThy28 mRNA is highly expressed in testis, liver, 
kidney, brain, with moderate expression in thymus, spleen, and heart. In the 
present study, characteristics of mouse Thy28 protein expression were examined 
using rabbit anti-mThy28 polyclonal antibody (Ab). Levels of mThy28 protein 
expression were highest in testis, with moderate expression in liver, spleen, 
and thymus. The Thy28 protein was mainly located in the nucleus, which was 
revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blotting using anti-mThy28 
Ab, and transient expression of the mThy28/EGFP fusion gene. Engagement of 
membrane immunoglobulin with anti-IgM induced down-regulation of human Thy28 
expression at both mRNA and protein levels, accompanied by induction of 
apoptosis in Ramos B lymphoma cells. Expression of protein and mRNA and 
induction of apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry/Western blotting, 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and propidium iodide staining, 
respectively. Anti-IgM also down-regulated the promoter activity of the mThy28 
gene, as demonstrated by luciferase assay. Thus, the anti-IgM-induced 
down-regulation of the nuclear Thy28 expression appears to correlate with the 
induction of apoptosis in Ramos B lymphoma cells.
