Importin beta-type transport receptors mediate the vast majority of transport 
pathways between cell nucleus and cytoplasm. We identify here the translation 
elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) as the predominant nuclear export substrate of 
RanBP21/exportin 5 (Exp5). This cargo-exportin interaction is rather un usual in 
that eEF1A binds the exportin not directly, but instead via aminoacylated tRNAs. 
Exp5 thus represents the second directly RNA-binding exportin and mediates tRNA 
export in parallel with exportin-t. It was suggested recently that 10-15% of the 
cellular translation would occur in the nucleus. Our data rule out such a 
scenario and instead suggest that nuclear translation is actively suppressed by 
the nuclear export machinery. We found that the vast majority of translation 
initiation factors (eIF2, eIF2B, eIF3, eIF4A1, eIF5 and eIF5B), all three 
elongation factors (eEF1A, eEF1B and eEF2) and the termination factor eRF1 are 
strictly excluded from nuclei. Besides Exp5 and importin 13, CRM1 and as yet 
unidentified exportins also contribute to the depletion of translation factors 
from nuclei.
