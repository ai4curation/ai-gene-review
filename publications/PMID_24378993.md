In the recent decades, carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has been developed 
into a credible option for the patients with carotid stenosis. However, 
restenosis remains a severe and unsolved issue after CAS treatment. Restenosis 
is characterized by neointimal hyperplasia, which is partially caused by 
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) proliferation. However, the molecular 
mechanism involved in the restenosis is still unclear. In this study, we 
demonstrated a functional crosstalk between two TGF-β superfamily signaling 
pathway members, Smad3 and BMPR2, in VSMC proliferation. Smad3 plays an 
important role in the TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway, and is significantly 
upregulated in the carotid artery with restenosis to promote VSMC proliferation. 
In contrast, BMP receptor II (BMPR2), an inhibitor of VSMC proliferation is 
downregulated in carotid restenosis. We further found that BMPR2 downregulation 
is mediated by miR-17-92 cluster, which is transcriptionally regulated by Smad3. 
Thus, Smad3 upregulation and Smad3/miR-17-92 cluster-dependent BMPR2 
downregulation are likely to promote VSMC proliferation and restenosis. Taken 
together, our results may provide novel clues for early diagnosis of carotid 
restenosis and developing new therapeutic strategy.
