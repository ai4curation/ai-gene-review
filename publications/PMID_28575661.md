The MUS81-EME1 endonuclease cleaves late replication intermediates at common 
fragile sites (CFSs) during early mitosis to trigger DNA-repair synthesis that 
ensures faithful chromosome segregation. Here, we show that these DNA 
transactions are promoted by RECQ5 DNA helicase in a manner dependent on its 
Ser727 phosphorylation by CDK1. Upon replication stress, RECQ5 associates with 
CFSs in early mitosis through its physical interaction with MUS81 and promotes 
MUS81-dependent mitotic DNA synthesis. RECQ5 depletion or mutational 
inactivation of its ATP-binding site, RAD51-interacting domain, or 
phosphorylation site causes excessive binding of RAD51 to CFS loci and impairs 
CFS expression. This leads to defective chromosome segregation and accumulation 
of CFS-associated DNA damage in G1 cells. Biochemically, RECQ5 alleviates the 
inhibitory effect of RAD51 on 3'-flap DNA cleavage by MUS81-EME1 through its 
RAD51 filament disruption activity. These data suggest that RECQ5 removes RAD51 
filaments stabilizing stalled replication forks at CFSs and hence facilitates 
CFS cleavage by MUS81-EME1.
