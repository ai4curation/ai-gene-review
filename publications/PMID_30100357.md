The kinetochore scaffold 1 (KNL1) protein coordinates the spindle assembly 
checkpoint (SAC), a signaling pathway that delays chromosome segregation until 
all sister chromatids are properly attached to spindle microtubules. Recently, 
microtubules and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which both bind the N-terminal 
domain of KNL1, have emerged as regulators of the SAC; however, how these 
proteins interact to contribute to SAC signaling is unknown. Here, we use X-ray 
crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and biochemical assays 
to show how KNL1 binds both PP1 and microtubules. Unexpectedly, we discovered 
that PP1 and microtubules bind KNL1 via overlapping binding sites. Further, we 
showed that Aurora B kinase phosphorylation results in distinct patterns of KNL1 
complex disruption. Finally, combining this data with co-sedimentation assays 
unequivocally demonstrated that microtubules and PP1 binding to KNL1 is mutually 
exclusive, with preferential formation of the KNL1:PP1 holoenzyme in the 
presence of PP1.
