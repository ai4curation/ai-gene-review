BACKGROUND: Insulin plus glucose, given for 7 days to hypermetabolic burn 
patients, has been shown to stimulate limb protein anabolism. We hypothesized 
that insulin plus glucose given to burn patients would also stimulate wound 
healing.
METHODS: Six patients with burns >40% total body surface area were randomized to 
receive insulin or placebo in a crossover study during the healing of their 
first and second donor sites. Insulin treatment was titrated at 25 to 49 U/h to 
achieve a plasma insulin level of 400 to 900 microU/mL for 7 days. Patients 
receiving insulin received dextrose 50 at 20 to 50 mL/h, titrated to maintain 
euglycemia. Donor-site biopsies were taken at 7 days and evaluated by three 
observers blinded to the treatment.
RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) donor-site healing time was reduced from 6.5 +/- 1.0 
days with placebo to 4.7 +/- 1.2 days during insulin infusion (p < 0.05). 
Laminin showed intense staining along the basal lamina and blood vessels. 
Collagen type IV staining also increased after insulin therapy compared with 
placebo.
CONCLUSION: Data indicate that high doses of insulin and glucose can be safely 
administered to massively burned patients to improve wound matrix formation.
