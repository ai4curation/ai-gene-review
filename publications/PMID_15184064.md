The protein product of growth arrest specific gene 6 (Gas6), is the biological 
ligand for the Axl subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases. We investigated the 
effects of exogenous Gas6 on growth of cardiac fibroblasts isolated from 
genetically Gas6-deficient mice. Recombinant Gas6, containing N terminal 
gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues formed from a vitamin K-dependent reaction, 
stimulated both DNA synthesis and proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts under 
serum-free conditions. Gas6 also markedly enhanced survival of cells during 
prolonged serum starvation. Gas6 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Axl as 
well as phosphorylation of ERK kinase. The mitogenic effects of Gas6 were 
inhibited by neutralising anti-Gas6 antibodies and by a soluble Axl ectodomain 
fusion protein. In contrast, recombinant Gas6 from cells treated with warfarin, 
which prevents the gamma-carboxylation reaction, neither stimulated fibroblast 
proliferation nor activated Axl tyrosine phosphorylation. Gas6-induced cell 
proliferation was additive to the effects of epidermal growth factor, suggesting 
activation of discrete signalling pathways. In conclusion, Gas6 appears to be a 
unique growth factor for fibroblasts and post-translational gamma-carboxylation 
is necessary for its biological activity. These findings implicate vitamin 
K-dependent biochemical reactions in growth processes in development and in 
disease.
