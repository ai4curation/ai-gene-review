The Myc oncoprotein family comprises transcription factors that control multiple 
cellular functions and are widely involved in oncogenesis. Here we report the 
identification of Myc-nick, a cytoplasmic form of Myc generated by 
calpain-dependent proteolysis at lysine 298 of full-length Myc. Myc-nick retains 
conserved Myc box regions but lacks nuclear localization signals and the bHLHZ 
domain essential for heterodimerization with Max and DNA binding. Myc-nick 
induces alpha-tubulin acetylation and altered cell morphology by recruiting 
histone acetyltransferase GCN5 to microtubules. During muscle differentiation, 
while the levels of full-length Myc diminish, Myc-nick and acetylated 
alpha-tubulin levels are increased. Ectopic expression of Myc-nick accelerates 
myoblast fusion, triggers the expression of myogenic markers, and permits 
Myc-deficient fibroblasts to transdifferentiate in response to MyoD. We propose 
that the cleavage of Myc by calpain abrogates the transcriptional inhibition of 
differentiation by full-length Myc and generates Myc-nick, a driver of 
cytoplasmic reorganization and differentiation.

Abstract

The Myc oncoprotein family comprises transcription factors that control multiple cellular functions and are widely involved in oncogenesis. Here we report the identification of Myc-nick, a cytoplasmic form of Myc generated by calpain- dependent proteolysis at lysine 298 of full-length Myc. Myc-nick retains conserved Myc Box regions but lacks nuclear localization signals and the bHLHZ domain essential for heterodimerization with Max and DNA binding. Myc-nick induces α-tubulin acetylation and altered cell morphology by recruiting histone acetyltransferase GCN5 to microtubules. During muscle differentiation, while the levels of full-length Myc diminish, Myc-nick and acetylated α-tubulin levels are increased. Ectopic expression of Myc-nick accelerates myoblast fusion, triggers the expression of myogenic markers, and permits Myc deficient fibroblasts to transdifferentiate in response to MyoD. We propose that the cleavage of Myc by calpain abrogates the transcriptional inhibition of differentiation by full-length Myc and generates Myc-nick, a driver of cytoplasmic reorganization and differentiation.

Introduction

The Myc family (c-Myc, N-Myc, and L-Myc) of basic-helix-loop-helix-zipper (bHLHZ) transcription factors controls the expression of a large number of target genes and non-coding RNA loci. These Myc targets mediate the physiological effects of Myc on cell proliferation, metabolism, apoptosis, growth, and differentiation ( Eilers and Eisenman, 2008 ). To promote transcriptional activation at target genes, Myc forms heterodimers with its partner Max and recruits chromatin-modifying complexes to E-box containing promoters. Myc is also involved in transcriptional repression through the inhibition of the transcriptional activator Miz1 ( Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al., 2006 ). Aberrant elevation of Myc levels has been shown to contribute to the genesis of many types of human tumors ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000 ).

Myc family proteins contain highly conserved regions termed Myc boxes (MB) that are essential for Myc’s biological activities (see Fig. 1E ). A major determinant of Myc transcriptional function is MBII, which is the site of recruitment of co-activator complexes containing histone acetyl transferases (HATs) such as GCN5 ( McMahon et al., 2000 ) and TIP60 ( Frank et al., 2003 ). MBI functions as a phosphorylation-dependent binding site for the ubiquitin ligase Fbw7 ( Welcker et al., 2004 ), while MBII is one of the binding sites for the ligase SKP2 ( Kim et al., 2003 ; von der Lehr et al., 2003 ). Fbw7 and Skp2 both contribute to the rapid degradation of Myc protein (t 1/2 ∼20 minutes). The C-terminus of Myc harbors nuclear localization signals and the bHLHZ motif that mediates dimerization with Max and DNA binding.

Several variant forms of Myc protein have been previously identified. All of them are nuclear localized, low abundance, proteins generated by alternative translation initiation. A weak CUG translational initiation site, upstream and in-frame of the predominant AUG codon, produces an N-terminally extended form of c-Myc called c-Myc1 ( Hann et al., 1988 ). Another Myc protein variant is MycS, generated by internal translational initiations at two AUG codons located ∼100 amino acids from the normal N-terminus ( Spotts et al., 1997 ). MycS lacks MBI but contains MBII and retains much of full-length Myc’s biological activity ( Xiao et al., 1998 ).

As expected, given their broad role as transcriptional regulators, Myc family proteins are predominantly localized to the cell nucleus during proliferation. Surprisingly however, there have been multiple reports of cytoplasmically localized Myc, mostly in differentiated cells. For example, N-Myc localization was shown to change from nuclear to cytoplasmic in differentiating neurons of the neural crest, retinal ganglion cells, neurons of spinal ganglia ( Wakamatsu et al., 1997 ; Wakamatsu et al., 1993 ) and Purkinje cells ( Okano et al., 1999 ; Wakamatsu et al., 1993 ). Cytoplasmic Myc was also reported in tumors with diverse origins ( Bai et al., 1994 ; Calcagno et al., 2009 ; Pietilainen et al., 1995 ). These studies relied on immunostaining protocols and the form of the Myc protein involved was not characterized.

Interestingly, association of Myc with several cytoplasmic proteins has been reported. The best characterized is the interaction of c-Myc with tubulins ( Alexandrova et al., 1995 ) ( Koch et al., 2007 ; Niklinski et al., 2000 ). Myc has also been reported to interact with other proteins that are predominantly cytoplasmic such as cdr2 ( Okano et al., 1999 ) and AMY-1 ( Taira et al., 1998 ). However the nature of the cytoplasmic Myc protein and its potential function remains an enigma. Here we report the identification of Myc-nick, a cytoplasmically localized cleavage product of Myc and provide evidence for its role in cytoskeletal organization and cell differentiation.

Discussion

Recent studies have demonstrated that Myc directly regulates transcriptional activation through the three RNA polymerases, as well as transcriptional repression, and DNA replication ( Eilers and Eisenman, 2008 ). Here we identified and characterized, Myc-nick, a novel form of Myc performing transcription-independent functions in the cytoplasm. One of these functions is to regulate α-tubulin acetylation in cooperation with the HAT GCN5. Moreover, Myc-nick levels are elevated in differentiated muscle tissues and Myc-nick overexpression accelerates muscle cell differentiation.

Despite its widespread expression Myc-nick has not been previously characterized. There are several likely reasons for this. First, the most commonly used antibodies against Myc (such as 9E10) recognize its C-terminus and would not detect Myc-nick. Second, the proportion of Myc-nick to Myc increases when cells are grown as confluent cultures, conditions that are not commonly employed when studying Myc proteins. Third, most studies use total protein or nuclear extracts and have not analyzed the cytoplasmic pool of Myc. Fourth, Myc-nick may have been mistaken for the similarly sized MycS protein ( Hann et al., 1988 ), a nuclear localized product of internal translation initiation.
