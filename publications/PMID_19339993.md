Covalent modification by small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMO) regulates p53 
transcription activity through an undefined mechanism. Using reconstituted 
sumoylation components, we purified SUMO-1-conjugated p53 (Su-p53) to near 
homogeneity. Su-p53 exists in solution as a tetramer and interacts with p300 
histone acetyltransferase as efficiently as the unmodified protein. 
Nevertheless, it fails to activate p53-dependent chromatin transcription because 
of its inability to bind DNA. With sequential modification assays, we found that 
sumoylation of p53 at K386 blocks subsequent acetylation by p300, whereas 
p300-acetylated p53 remains permissive for ensuing sumoylation at K386 and 
alleviates sumoylation-inhibited DNA binding. While preventing the free form of 
p53 from accessing its cognate sites, sumoylation fails to disengage prebound 
p53 from DNA. The sumoylation-deficient K386R protein, when expressed in 
p53-null cells, exhibits higher transcription activity and binds better to the 
endogenous p21 gene compared with the wild-type protein. These studies unravel a 
molecular mechanism underlying sumoylation-regulated p53 function and further 
uncover a new role of acetylation in antagonizing the inhibitory effect of 
sumoylation on p53 binding to DNA.

Introduction

The transcription activity of p53 tumour suppressor protein is regulated by posttranslational modification and its interaction with different proteins. Although modulation of p53 protein stability by oncoprotein association and dissociation appears to be a major way to control p53 activity, a nonproteolytic strategy that is uncoupled from the ubiquitin degradation pathway is also used to regulate p53 function. Covalent modification by small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMO) represents one such alteration that fine-tunes p53 transcription activity. In humans, three mature (i.e. protease-processed) SUMO conjugates, SUMO-1 (97 aa), SUMO-2 (92 aa) and SUMO-3 (93 aa), are expressed in most cell types. Conjugation by SUMO-1 generally results in monosumoylated proteins, whereas polysumoylated chains can be observed with SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 linkages. A consensus sumoylation site, ψKxE (ψ, a large hydrophobic residue; x, any amino acid), has been defined, but a number of proteins are sumoylated through noncanonical lysine residues ( Johnson, 2004 ; Meulmeester et al , 2008 ; Vethantham et al , 2008 ). Although SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 (95% identical to each other and ∼47% identical to SUMO-1) seem interchangeable for conjugation at many lysine residues ( Zhang et al , 2008 ), paralog-specific sumoylation has also been observed ( Saitoh and Hinchey, 2000 ; Meulmeester et al , 2008 ). Like ubiquitination, sumoylation occurs through an enzymatic cascade involving the heterodimeric SUMO-activating enzyme (SAE1/SAE2 in humans, Aos1/Uba2 in yeast), the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and different SUMO E3 ligases that include five protein inhibitors of activated STATs (PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASxα, PIASxβ and PIASy), RanBP2, and the polycomb protein Pc2. This dynamic linkage is reversed by various SUMO-specific proteases, such as SENP1 predominantly present in the nucleus ( Hay, 2007 ). Sumoylation modulates protein function through nucleocytoplasmic translocation, subnuclear localization, and protein–protein and protein–DNA interaction ( Matunis et al , 1996 ; Hoege et al , 2002 ; Yang and Sharrocks, 2004 ; Gill, 2005 ; Pascual et al , 2005 ; Baba et al , 2006 ; Potts and Yu, 2007 ). Most of these events can potentially sequester transcription factors before they reach their destined chromatin targets. Thus, it is important to distinguish between the indirect and the direct effects of sumoylation on transcriptional control. At present, mechanistic studies of direct sumoylation-linked transcriptional control remain mostly unelucidated.

Sumoylation of p53 occurs at lysine 386 in the C-terminal domain (CTD), which is the regulatory region critical for p53 function. The CTD, spanning amino acids 363–393, is thought to be unstructured and accessible for posttranslational modification in several molecular models of full-length p53 tetramers deduced from X-ray structures of individually resolved DNA-binding, oligomerization and N-terminal activation domains, as well as from NMR, small-angle X-ray scattering and three-dimensional cryoelectron micrograph images of wild-type and mutant p53 tetramers ( Kitayner et al , 2006 ; Okorokov et al , 2006 ; Tidow et al , 2007 ). This flexible nature of the CTD, which contains multiple lysine residues (K370, K372, K373, K381, K382, K386), allows p53 to contact DNA nonspecifically, and thus facilitates sequence-specific recognition by its core DNA-binding domain, perhaps through DNA sliding ( McKinney et al , 2004 ). All of these six C-terminal lysine residues are subject to different types of posttranslational modification, including Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination (at all six residues; Rodriguez et al , 2000 ) and neddylation (at K370, K372, K373; Xirodimas et al , 2004 ), p300/CBP-mediated acetylation (primarily at K373 and K382; Gu and Roeder, 1997 ), Set7/9-mediated methylation (K372; Chuikov et al , 2004 ), Smyd2-mediated methylation (K370; Huang et al , 2006 ) and Set8-mediated methylation (K382; Shi et al , 2007 ). Acetylation at K373/K382 and methylation at K372 are linked to p53 activation, whereas other covalent bond formations appear to repress p53 transcription activity. Mice with arginine substitutions of all six lysine residues are viable and appear normal in development, but they exhibit some defects in DNA damage response ( Feng et al , 2005 ; Krummel et al , 2005 ). Thus, the roles of C-terminal lysine modification remain unclear. In the case of p53 sumoylation, cell-based transfection experiments also give controversial results with either an enhancing ( Gostissa et al , 1999 ; Rodriguez et al , 1999 ) or no effect ( Kwek et al , 2001 ) of sumoylation on p53 transcription activity. Considering that <5% of p53 is sumoylated in the cell ( Melchior and Hengst, 2002 ) and that p53 is constantly diverted from reaching its chromatin targets by different paths of intracellular trafficking, it is extremely difficult to unambiguously define the transcriptional effects of sumoylation in vivo .

Using an in vitro sumoylation system reconstituted with recombinant human SUMO-1, SAE1/SAE2, Ubc9, PIASxβ and p53, we purified SUMO-1-conjugated p53 (Su-p53) to near homogeneity. Su-p53 exists in solution as a tetramer and interacts with p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) as efficiently as the unmodified protein. Nevertheless, it fails to activate p53-dependent transcription in an in vitro chromatin-linked transcription system that we have developed ( Thomas and Chiang, 2005 ; Wu et al , 2006 ). When the DNA/chromatin-binding activity of Su-p53 was examined, we found that sumoylation prevents the free, but not DNA-bound, form of p53 from associating with its target sequence. Interestingly, acetylation of p53 by p300 restores the DNA-binding activity of Su-p53, indicating that acetylation antagonizes sumoylation-mediated inhibition of p53 function and thereby accounts for a stimulating role of p300-mediated acetylation in p53-dependent chromatin transcription in vivo and in vitro . Our studies not only provide mechanistic insights into sumoylation-regulated p53 transcription activity but also unravel an intricate crosstalk between acetylation and sumoylation in fine tuning the DNA-binding activity of a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein.

Discussion

Covalent modification on amino-acid residues offers a simple and often nondisruptive way to fine-tune protein activity through conformational changes that regulate protein–protein and protein–nucleic acid interactions. One of the best examples is illustrated by stress-induced modification occurring on the p53 tumour suppressor protein, which is a short-lived, sequence-specific transcription factor modulating cell-cycle progression, DNA repair, apoptosis and senescence ( Riley et al , 2008 ). However, conclusions based on studies performed in vivo and in cultured cells, particularly the biological effects of phosphorylation ( Appella and Anderson, 2001 ), acetylation ( Luo et al , 2004 ) and sumoylation ( Melchior and Hengst, 2002 ) on p53, are sometimes contradictory, in part due to the complexity of the varying cellular environment and the fact that modification typically takes place in a small population of the total protein within a narrow time window.

To overcome this difficulty, we developed in vitro -reconstituted modification assays that allow us to purify sumoylated p53 to near homogeneity and thus define unambiguously the biochemical property of this modification in regulating p53 function. A number of important findings have been uncovered from this study (see the models presented in Figures 5 and 7D ). First, sumoylation occurs in tetrameric p53 with flexible C-terminal conformations inherent in different subunits, providing biochemical evidence supporting molecular modelling of the unstructured C-terminal region inferred from individually resolved subdomains of p53 and the cryoEM structure of p53 tetramers. Second, sumoylation plays a direct role in p53-dependent transcription by inhibiting p53 binding to DNA and chromatin, thereby suppressing p53 target gene transcription. Third, we have discovered a novel role of C-terminal acetylation, which acts primarily to overcome sumoylation-inhibited DNA binding, thereby restoring p53's ability to bind DNA and to support transcription. Although acetylation has been implicated in the regulation of p53 binding to DNA, recruitment of coactivators, enhanced protein stability and dissociation of Mdm2/Mdmx (reviewed in Tang et al , 2008 ), most of these cell-based assays cannot distinguish direct or indirect effects of acetylation on p53 binding to targeted chromatin and on transcription complex assembly. In fact, recent experiments performed in living cells also suggest that acetylation of p53 at its C-terminal lysine residues, K120, or K164, is primarily implicated in corepressor dissociation without truly altering p53 binding to its target sequences ( Tang et al , 2008 ), consistent with our in vitro studies reported here. Fourth, although acetylation does not prevent subsequent sumoylation on the p53 tetramer, sumoylation appears to block acetylation on the adjacent C-terminal lysine residues, likely due to steric hindrance and conformational changes induced by the bulky SUMO moiety. Fifth, unlike its effect on the free form of p53, sumoylation does not actively dissociate DNA-bound p53 from its target site, even though the same lysine residue (K386) is used for SUMO conjugation in both cases. Sixth, the sumoylation-defective K386R mutant indeed exhibits higher transcription activity compared with the wild-type protein, correlating with its enhanced binding to the endogenous p21 gene. Seventh, sumoylation on DNA-bound p53 allows recruitment of the mSin3A transcriptional corepressor (this study) that in turn recruits other inhibitory activity and prolongs the half-life of p53 on targeted chromatin ( Zilfou et al , 2001 ), thereby providing a molecular insight into mSin3A-potentiated p53 repression of pluripotency-associated gene expression ( Lin et al , 2005 ; Wilkinson et al , 2008 ). Our failure to detect SUMO-dependent recruitment of histone deacetyltransferases by DNA-bound SUMO-p53 using HeLa nuclear extract indicates that formation of mSin3A corepressor complex is a multi-step process and additional control mechanisms or stress-induced signalling events typically seen in living cells are necessary to form a stable p53–mSin3A–HDAC complex.

The tetramer is the active form of p53 engaged in transcriptional regulation and appears to be the entity modified by phosphorylation ( Shieh et al , 1999 ), acetylation ( Čes̆ková et al , 2006 ) and sumoylation (this study), maybe through formation of unique conformations accessible to the protein modification machinery. It would be interesting to examine whether other types of posttranslational modification, such as methylation, ubiquitination and neddylation also occur in a tetramer-specific manner, which may provide a molecular basis for the crosstalk among different types of modification seen with p53. In our HAT assay, very little if any acetylation was detected on Su-p53 ( Figure 3C ), suggesting that acetylation and sumoylation take place on the same subunits in a tetramer and the steric hindrance imposed by the bulky SUMO moiety at K386 prevents p300-mediated acetylation at adjacent K382 and K373. Although two of the four subunits in a p53 tetramer seem to be preferentially sumoylated, SUMO modification can also occur on only one or more than two subunits with a similar DNA-binding effect. Although subunit exchange may theoretically generate a small amount of wild-type p53 tetramers in purified Su-p53 and account for a low level of transcription from pWAFMLT chromatin (see Figure 3B , lanes 6 and 7), it does not seem to be kinetically favoured. The barely detectable signal in Su-p53 acetylation reactions indicates that sumoylation may stabilize the unstructured C-terminal region and the entire protein, thereby increasing the stability of an intrinsically unstable p53 tetramer (see the p53 structure review by Joerger and Fersht, 2008 ). Future structural analysis of Su-p53 will provide molecular insight into this intriguing issue.

The crosstalk among different types of p53 modification that has been reported includes phosphorylation-regulated p53 acetylation ( Ou et al , 2005 ; Yang and Seto, 2008 ), methylation-triggered p53 acetylation ( Ivanov et al , 2007 ; Kurash et al , 2008 ), ubiquitination-excluded p53 acetylation ( Ito et al , 2002 ; Li et al , 2002 ; Le Cam et al , 2006 ), ubiquitination-enhanced p53 sumoylation ( Carter et al , 2007 ) and sumoylation-inhibited p53 acetylation (this study). Clearly, the interplay among different covalent modifications creates an intricate circuit and a ‘protein code' for regulating p53 function and the activity of many other transcriptional regulators and components of the general transcription machinery and general cofactors ( Thomas and Chiang, 2006 ). The uncovering of SUMO-inhibited p53 binding to DNA is consistent with the findings in other SUMO-regulated DNA-binding proteins, such as thymine DNA glycosylase ( Baba et al , 2006 ), Sox2 ( Tsuruzoe et al , 2006 ) and heat shock transcription factor 2 ( Anckar et al , 2006 ). Conceivably, sumoylation has a more active role in modulating the DNA-binding activity of selective transcription factors. It is important to note that, although sumoylation blocks the free form of p53 from accessing its target sequence, it fails to actively disengage prebound p53 from DNA. An intriguing role of sumoylation on DNA-bound p53 is likely to recruit coregulator complexes recognizing the SUMO mark on p53, as seen in our mSin3A recruitment ( Figure 6D ) and with other transcription systems ( Gill, 2005 ; Stielow et al , 2008 ). Perhaps, DNA-induced conformational changes provide a better configuration for sumoylation to occur on poised factors as reported for proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( Parker et al , 2008 ). These possibilities remain to be investigated in the future.
