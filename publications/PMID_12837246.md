Telomerase expression is repressed in most somatic cells but is observed in stem 
cells and a high percentage of human cancers and has been hypothesized to 
contribute to tumorigenesis and maintenance of stem cell states. To explore 
telomerase regulation, we employed a general genetic screen to identify negative 
regulators of hTERT. We discovered three tumor suppressor/oncogene pathways 
involved in hTERT repression. One, the Mad1/c-Myc pathway, had been previously 
implicated in hTERT regulation. The second, SIP1, a transcriptional target of 
the TGF-beta pathway, mediates the TGF-beta regulated repression of hTERT. The 
third, the tumor suppressor Menin, is a direct repressor of hTERT. Depleting 
Menin immortalizes primary human fibroblasts and causes a transformation 
phenotype when coupled with expression of SV40 Large and Small T antigen and 
oncogenic ras. These studies suggest that multiple tumor suppressor/oncogene 
pathways coordinately repress hTERT expression and imply that telomerase is 
reactivated in human tumors through oncogenic mutations.
