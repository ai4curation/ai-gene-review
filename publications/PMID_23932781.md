Increased fatty acid synthesis is required to meet the demand for membrane 
expansion of rapidly growing cells. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) is upregulated or 
activated in several types of cancer, and inhibition of ACLY arrests 
proliferation of cancer cells. Here we show that ACLY is acetylated at lysine 
residues 540, 546, and 554 (3K). Acetylation at these three lysine residues is 
stimulated by P300/calcium-binding protein (CBP)-associated factor (PCAF) 
acetyltransferase under high glucose and increases ACLY stability by blocking 
its ubiquitylation and degradation. Conversely, the protein deacetylase sirtuin 
2 (SIRT2) deacetylates and destabilizes ACLY. Substitution of 3K abolishes ACLY 
ubiquitylation and promotes de novo lipid synthesis, cell proliferation, and 
tumor growth. Importantly, 3K acetylation of ACLY is increased in human lung 
cancers. Our study reveals a crosstalk between acetylation and ubiquitylation by 
competing for the same lysine residues in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis 
and cell growth in response to glucose.
