Entactin is an integral and ubiquitous component of the basement membrane. The 
amino acid sequences of the mouse and human molecules have been determined and 
exhibit 85% sequence identity. The molecule is organized into three structural 
domains, an N-terminal globule (I) is linked to a smaller C-terminal globule 
(III) by a rigid stalk (II) largely consisting of cysteine-rich EGF-like 
homology repeats and a cysteine-rich thyroglobulin homology repeat. The molecule 
binds calcium ions and supports cell adhesion. However, its major function may 
be the assembly of the basement membrane. The carboxyl globule binds tightly to 
one of the short arms of laminin at the inner rodlike segment. This same region 
is also believed to be responsible for the attachment of entactin to type IV 
collagen at approximately 80 nm from its carboxyl noncollagenous end. Entactin 
therefore could serve as a bridge between the two most abundant molecules in the 
basement membrane. Supporting evidence for this role has been obtained from 
transfection of human choriocarcinoma, JAR, cells with the entactin gene. JAR 
cells synthesize laminin and type IV collagen but not entactin. Transfection of 
entactin into the cells stimulated incorporation of laminin and type IV collagen 
along with entactin into the extracellular matrix and into structures resembling 
focal contacts. The calcium-binding activity of entactin may play a role in the 
matrix assembly process. The protease sensitivity of entactin suggests that it 
may be a target for proteolytic activity during tissue remodeling, metastasis, 
and other events requiring the turnover of the basement membrane.
