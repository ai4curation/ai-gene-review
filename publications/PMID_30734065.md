At the blood-brain barrier (BBB), claudin (Cldn)-5 is thought to be the dominant 
tight junction (TJ) protein, with minor contributions from Cldn3 and -12, and 
occludin. However, the BBB appears ultrastructurally normal in Cldn5 knock-out 
mice, suggesting that further Cldns and/or TJ-associated marvel proteins (TAMPs) 
are involved. Microdissected human and murine brain capillaries, quickly frozen 
to recapitulate the in vivo situation, showed high transcript expression of 
Cldn5, -11, -12, and -25, and occludin, but also abundant levels of Cldn1 and 
-27 in man. Protein levels were quantified by a novel epitope dilution assay and 
confirmed the respective mRNA data. In contrast to the in vivo situation, Cldn5 
dominates BBB expression in vitro, since all other TJ proteins are at comparably 
low levels or are not expressed. Cldn11 was highly abundant in vivo and 
contributed to paracellular tightness by homophilic oligomerization, but almost 
disappeared in vitro. Cldn25, also found at high levels, neither tightened the 
paracellular barrier nor interconnected opposing cells, but contributed to 
proper TJ strand morphology. Pathological conditions (in vivo ischemia and in 
vitro hypoxia) down-regulated Cldn1, -3, and -12, and occludin in cerebral 
capillaries, which was paralleled by up-regulation of Cldn5 after middle 
cerebral artery occlusion in rats. Cldn1 expression increased after Cldn5 
knock-down. In conclusion, this complete Cldn/TAMP profile demonstrates the 
presence of up to a dozen TJ proteins in brain capillaries. Mouse and human 
share a similar and complex TJ profile in vivo, but this complexity is widely 
lost under in vitro conditions.
