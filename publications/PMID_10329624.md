Tor proteins, homologous to DNA-dependent protein kinases, participate in a 
signal transduction pathway in yeast that regulates protein synthesis and cell 
wall expansion in response to nutrient availability. The anti-inflammatory drug 
rapamycin inhibits yeast cell growth by inhibiting Tor protein signaling. This 
leads to diminished association of a protein, Tap42, with two different protein 
phosphatase catalytic subunits; one encoded redundantly by PPH21 and PPH22, and 
one encoded by SIT4. We show that inactivation of either Cdc55 or Tpd3, which 
regulate Pph21/22 activity, results in rapamycin resistance and that this 
resistance correlates with an increased association of Tap42 with Pph21/22. 
Furthermore, we show Tor-dependent phosphorylation of Tap42 both in vivo and in 
vitro and that this phosphorylation is rapamycin sensitive. Inactivation of 
Cdc55 or Tpd3 enhances in vivo phosphorylation of Tap42. We conclude that Tor 
phosphorylates Tap42 and that phosphorylated Tap42 effectively competes with 
Cdc55/Tpd3 for binding to the phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit. Furthermore, 
Cdc55 and Tpd3 promote dephosphorylation of Tap42. Thus, Tor stimulates 
growth-promoting association of Tap42 with Pph21/22 and Sit4, while Cdc55 and 
Tpd3 inhibit this association both by direct competition and by 
dephosphorylation of Tap42. These results establish Tap42 as a target of Tor and 
add further refinement to the Tor signaling pathway.
