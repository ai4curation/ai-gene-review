Sulfur is an essential element for the synthesis of cysteine, methionine, and 
other organo-sulfur compounds needed by living organisms. Additionally, some 
prokaryotes are capable of exploiting oxidation or reduction of inorganic sulfur 
compounds to energize cellular growth. Several anaerobic genera of Bacteria and 
Archaea produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S), as a result of using sulfate (SO(4)(2 -) 
), elemental sulfur (S(0)), thiosulfate (S₂O(3)(2 -)), and tetrathionate 
(S(4)O(6)(2 -)) as terminal electron acceptors. Some phototrophic and aerobic 
sulfur bacteria are capable of using electrons from oxidation of sulfide to 
support chemolithotrophic growth. For the most part, biosulfur reduction or 
oxidation requires unique enzymatic activities with metal cofactors 
participating in electron transfer. This review provides an examination of 
cytochromes, iron-sulfur proteins, and sirohemes participating in electron 
movement in diverse groups of sulfate-reducing, sulfur-reducing, and 
sulfide-oxidizing Bacteria and Archaea.
