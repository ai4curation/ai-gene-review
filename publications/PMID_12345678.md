Denpasar Declaration on Population and Development.

Ministerial Meeting on Population of the Non-Aligned Movement (1993: Bali).

PIP: Ministers from the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) got together 
at the Ministerial Meeting on Population in Bali, Indonesia, November 11-13, 
1993, to develop the Denpasar Declaration on Population and Development. The 
declaration was made with full consideration and acceptance of the sovereignty 
of individual nations and the decisions on population of the heads of states and 
governments at the tenth conference of Non-Aligned Countries at Jakarta, 1992, 
and the results of the meeting of the Standing Ministerial Committee for 
Economic Cooperation of the NAM in Bali 1993. The ministers recognize that 
population should be an integral part of the development process, population 
policies and development efforts should be designed to improve the quality of 
life for present generations without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs, and the alleviation of poverty is essential 
to the dignity of humankind and fundamental to the achievement of sustainable 
development. They further reaffirm the existence of humans as the center of 
concern for sustainable development, the right to an adequate standard of living 
for all, gender equality, greater multilateral cooperation for development, and 
that all developing countries should participate effectively at the 
International Conference on Population and Development to be convened in Cairo 
in 1994. The text of the declaration is included.

IntroductionViruses, especially respiratory viruses, are common pathogens that can cause life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia. Therefore, they are a major risk factor for human health1–3. Among viral pathogens, excluding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), influenza virus has become the most important viral cause of community-acquired pneumonia in clinical practice. Other common viral pathogens include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus2,4. Seasonal outbreaks and epidemics of influenza viruses cause a large number of hospitalizations and deaths each year5,6. Most of the deaths are caused by rapidly progressive viral pneumonia (VPA), dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and systemic multiple organ failure7,8. Pulmonary fibrosis in surviving patients with VPA affects their quality of life and survival (viral infection-induced pulmonary fibrosis)9. Thus, the treatment of VPA is receiving increased attention. In addition to conventional treatment, such as antiviral and symptomatic supportive therapy, glucocorticoids are used as an adjuvant therapy for VPA because of their ability to inhibit inflammatory factors.Some studies have shown that the use of glucocorticoids will increase the risk of nosocomial infection and prolong the clearance time of the virus, resulting in an increase in the mortality of patients with VPA10–18. Other studies have reported that glucocorticoids, due to their anti-inflammatory effects, can rapidly decrease lung injury and improve oxygenation, thus reducing mortality, which is beneficial to the prognosis of VPA19–21. Some animal models have shown the same result22–25. Therefore, no conclusion can be derived regarding whether glucocorticoids can be used as adjunctive treatment for VPA. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate the benefits of high-dose steroids combined with short-course oral glucocorticoids for survival and improved prognosis in patients with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia.

Introduction

Viruses, especially respiratory viruses, are common pathogens that can cause life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia. Therefore, they are a major risk factor for human health1–3. Among viral pathogens, excluding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), influenza virus has become the most important viral cause of community-acquired pneumonia in clinical practice. Other common viral pathogens include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus2,4. Seasonal outbreaks and epidemics of influenza viruses cause a large number of hospitalizations and deaths each year5,6. Most of the deaths are caused by rapidly progressive viral pneumonia (VPA), dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and systemic multiple organ failure7,8. Pulmonary fibrosis in surviving patients with VPA affects their quality of life and survival (viral infection-induced pulmonary fibrosis)9. Thus, the treatment of VPA is receiving increased attention. In addition to conventional treatment, such as antiviral and symptomatic supportive therapy, glucocorticoids are used as an adjuvant therapy for VPA because of their ability to inhibit inflammatory factors.

Some studies have shown that the use of glucocorticoids will increase the risk of nosocomial infection and prolong the clearance time of the virus, resulting in an increase in the mortality of patients with VPA10–18. Other studies have reported that glucocorticoids, due to their anti-inflammatory effects, can rapidly decrease lung injury and improve oxygenation, thus reducing mortality, which is beneficial to the prognosis of VPA19–21. Some animal models have shown the same result22–25. Therefore, no conclusion can be derived regarding whether glucocorticoids can be used as adjunctive treatment for VPA. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate the benefits of high-dose steroids combined with short-course oral glucocorticoids for survival and improved prognosis in patients with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia.

MethodsStudy design and patientsA retrospective study was performed in patients who were diagnosed with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia (severe pneumonia as defined by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America criteria)26 and treated with glucocorticoids at the Second Hospital of Jilin University from November 2023 to January 2024. Patients were followed up for three months.Eligibility criteriaPatients who were hospitalized for severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia were included in the study. Patients with any other viral infections were excluded.ImagingAll patients received chest imaging examination upon admission; nine of them received lung comprehensive computed tomography (CT) examination, and the other two patients were critically ill and received bedside chest X-ray examination.Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS)All patients received mNGS in the sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) before receiving glucocorticoid therapy.Patient data collectionClinical data and basic information, such as sex and age, were collected. The results of laboratory tests, such as routine blood, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), CT or chest X-ray, and arterial blood gas analysis, were also collected.TreatmentsAfter admission, all patients were given supportive care. Among them, nine patients received high-flow nasal cannula treatment, and two patients received non-invasive ventilator assisted ventilation. After diagnosis, all patients were given an initial dose of methylprednisolone (80–320 mg/day) based on the clinical symptoms (such as respiratory rate), oxygenation, lung imaging, and body weight (following the recommendation of Chinese scholars (methylprednisolone 80 mg, 2–3 times/day27). In one patient, the disease still progressed after initial treatment, and it manifested as increased dyspnea and progressive decrease in the oxygenation index. After ruling out acute aggravation caused by pulmonary embolism, infection, cardiac insufficiency, and other diseases, the dose of hormone was increased to 320 mg/day considering acute respiratory distress syndrome after viral infection. Patients were also treated with oseltamivir. Those infected with bacteria or fungi were given β-lactam antibiotics or targeted therapy, including fluconazole, micafungin, or sulfamethoxazole. The dose of methylprednisolone was reduced by 40 mg/day every 3–5 days according to the clinical symptoms, oxygenation, and imaging conditions of the patients, until the dose of methylprednisolone was reduced to 40 mg/day. The discharge indication was that the patient did not have any fever or resting state breathing difficulty, had low flow oxygen inhalation through the nasal cannula (below 3L/min), with finger pulse oxygen reaching above 95%. After discharge, the patient was asked to take prednisone tablets orally at a dose of 20–30 mg/day, with one tablet being reduced every 3–5 days until discontinuation. The total course of treatment was approximately 1–2 months.Ethics approval and informed consentThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Hospital of Jilin University. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. All the patients gave their written consent for the personal and clinical details along with any identifying images to be published in this study.Statistical analysesWe used SPSS for all analyses (version 21.0, USA). Normally distributed variables were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation, and statistical analysis was performed using a T-test. Categorical variables are presented as counts and percentages. P-values below 0.05 were defined as statistically significant.

All patients had at least one respiratory symptom, such as fever, cough, phlegm, or dyspnea. Fever (10 cases, 90.9%) was the most common symptom, followed by cough (9 cases, 81.8), dyspnea (7 cases, 63.6%), and expectoration (6 cases, 54.5%). All patients had an oxygenation index < 250 mmHg, respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, and inflammation range involving more than two lung lobes. The patients had respiratory symptoms for 3 to 30 days (mean: 15.5 ± 8.7 days) before admission to our hospital (Additional Tables 1 and 2).Laboratory test resultsLaboratory examination (Table 1 and Additional Table 1) showed that four patients had a high white blood cell count (9.33 ± 5.16 109/L) and neutrophil count (7.76 ± 4.75 109/L); six patients had a low lymphocyte count (0.96 ± 0.54 109/L); and up to nine patients had an elevated CRP level (48.9 ± 17.6). Only two patients (mean value 2.2361) had an elevated PCT level. Laboratory examination results showed that white blood cells and neutrophils remained unchanged after viral infection alone, while white blood cells and PCT levels increased after combined bacterial and fungal infections.mNGS resultsThe viruses detected by mNGS were influenza A (six cases) and influenza B (five cases) (Table 1). Only three cases had simple virus infection; one case had bacterial infection; three cases had fungal infection; and four cases had both bacterial and fungal infection. The most common bacteria were gram-negative bacilli, and fungi mainly consisted of Candida albicans (Table 1). Figure 1 details the mNGS results, showing the relative abundance of various pathogens in each patient’s sputum or BALF.Fig. 1Species distribution and relative abundance of pathogens detected by mNGS of the sputum or BALF.

BALF, Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; mNGS, Metagenomic next-generation sequencing; NGS, Next-generation sequencing.Imaging dataThe imaging findings included a variety of patterns, such as spot shadow, ground-glass shadow, and lung consolidation shadow (Fig. 2). Two patients (Fig. 2D,I) showed diffuse ground-glass shadows in all lung lobes.Fig. 2Chest CT scan of patients on admission. On admission, CT and X-ray changes in the patient’s lungs showed obvious ground-glass shadows, some of which were combined with solid shadows. Among them, two patients with severe disease could not receive lung CT, so a bedside X-ray examination was performed instead. CT, comprehensive computed tomography.Treatment-related outcomesLaboratory examination showed no statistical difference in the total white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, calcitonin, urea nitrogen, and CRP in 11 patients (P > 0.05) before and after treatment (Additional Table 3). The clinical symptoms (fever, cough, sputum, and dyspnea), oxygenation, and lung imaging results improved. None of the patients received tracheal intubation and ventilator therapy; among them, two patients (case 2 and case 7) were recommended to receive tracheal intubation and ventilator-assisted ventilation, but the patients and their families refused. After increasing the dosage of glucocorticoids, the oxygen concentration of the patients gradually decreased, and their symptoms gradually improved (Table 2).Table 2Types of pathogenic bacteria and treatment strategies.PatientsHFNCN-IVAntibioticsAntifungalAntiviral(BH)Antiviral(AH)&GSID&TGDT§ SGIDHDOutcomesOTComplication1YNβ-lactamase inhibitorsNANAOseltamivir80decrease2011Improved310EBP2※NYImipenem and Cilastatin SodiumFluconazoleOseltamivirOseltamivir80Increase (160)3022Improved276NA3YNMeropenemFluconazoleNAOseltamivir80decrease3013Improved293Hyperglycemi4NYImipenem and Cilastatin Sodium、EtimicinVoriconazoleNAOseltamivir80decrease2516Improved317NA5YNNANANAOseltamivir80decrease2510Improved285Hyperglycemia, EBP6YNNANANAOseltamivir80decrease3011Improved335NA7※YNβ-lactamase inhibitorsMicafunginOseltamivirOseltamivir80Increase (160)3017Improved261NA8YNβ-lactamase inhibitorsPosaconazoleNAOseltamivir80decrease3015Improved310NA9YNNAFluconazoleOseltamivirOseltamivir320decrease3024Improved352NA10YNNAMicafungin, Paediatric Compound sulfamethoxazoleNAOseltamivir80decrease2015Improved324NA11YNNANANAOseltamivir80decrease3010Improved344NAHFNC: High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy; N-IV: Non-invasive ventilator; BH:(Before admission to hospital; AH: After admission to hospital; &: Methylprednisolone; GSID: Glucocorticoid shock initial dose; TGDT: Trend of glucocorticoid dose adjustment during treatment ;§: Prednisone; SGID: Sequential glucocorticoid initiation dose; HD: Hospitalization days; OT: Oxygenation index (mmHg) after treatment; EBP: Elevated blood pressure; ※: Invasive mechanical ventilation is required.By the time of discharge, all patients showed improved clinical symptoms, no fever, and significantly improved dyspnea and lung imaging results.

A1-E1 was the lung CT before admission; A2-E2 was the lung CT at admission; A3-E3 was the lung CT at one month after discharge; and A4-E4 was the lung CT at three months after discharge; and the findings indicated that the lesion was obviously absorbed after treatment. CT, Comprehensive computed tomograph.ComplicationThe total course of treatment for patients treated with glucocorticoid application was 1–2 months, during which no serious life-threatening adverse reactions were observed. The most common adverse reactions were hypertension and hyperglycemia (Tables 1 and 2). After the adjustment of drugs, the above abnormalities could be controlled.

Laboratory examination (Table 1 and Additional Table 1) showed that four patients had a high white blood cell count (9.33 ± 5.16 109/L) and neutrophil count (7.76 ± 4.75 109/L); six patients had a low lymphocyte count (0.96 ± 0.54 109/L); and up to nine patients had an elevated CRP level (48.9 ± 17.6). Only two patients (mean value 2.2361) had an elevated PCT level. Laboratory examination results showed that white blood cells and neutrophils remained unchanged after viral infection alone, while white blood cells and PCT levels increased after combined bacterial and fungal infections.

mNGS resultsThe viruses detected by mNGS were influenza A (six cases) and influenza B (five cases) (Table 1). Only three cases had simple virus infection; one case had bacterial infection; three cases had fungal infection; and four cases had both bacterial and fungal infection. The most common bacteria were gram-negative bacilli, and fungi mainly consisted of Candida albicans (Table 1). Figure 1 details the mNGS results, showing the relative abundance of various pathogens in each patient’s sputum or BALF.Fig. 1Species distribution and relative abundance of pathogens detected by mNGS of the sputum or BALF.

Imaging dataThe imaging findings included a variety of patterns, such as spot shadow, ground-glass shadow, and lung consolidation shadow (Fig. 2). Two patients (Fig. 2D,I) showed diffuse ground-glass shadows in all lung lobes.Fig. 2Chest CT scan of patients on admission. On admission, CT and X-ray changes in the patient’s lungs showed obvious ground-glass shadows, some of which were combined with solid shadows. Among them, two patients with severe disease could not receive lung CT, so a bedside X-ray examination was performed instead. CT, comprehensive computed tomography.

Treatment-related outcomesLaboratory examination showed no statistical difference in the total white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, calcitonin, urea nitrogen, and CRP in 11 patients (P > 0.05) before and after treatment (Additional Table 3). The clinical symptoms (fever, cough, sputum, and dyspnea), oxygenation, and lung imaging results improved. None of the patients received tracheal intubation and ventilator therapy; among them, two patients (case 2 and case 7) were recommended to receive tracheal intubation and ventilator-assisted ventilation, but the patients and their families refused. After increasing the dosage of glucocorticoids, the oxygen concentration of the patients gradually decreased, and their symptoms gradually improved (Table 2).Table 2Types of pathogenic bacteria and treatment strategies.PatientsHFNCN-IVAntibioticsAntifungalAntiviral(BH)Antiviral(AH)&GSID&TGDT§ SGIDHDOutcomesOTComplication1YNβ-lactamase inhibitorsNANAOseltamivir80decrease2011Improved310EBP2※NYImipenem and Cilastatin SodiumFluconazoleOseltamivirOseltamivir80Increase (160)3022Improved276NA3YNMeropenemFluconazoleNAOseltamivir80decrease3013Improved293Hyperglycemi4NYImipenem and Cilastatin Sodium、EtimicinVoriconazoleNAOseltamivir80decrease2516Improved317NA5YNNANANAOseltamivir80decrease2510Improved285Hyperglycemia, EBP6YNNANANAOseltamivir80decrease3011Improved335NA7※YNβ-lactamase inhibitorsMicafunginOseltamivirOseltamivir80Increase (160)3017Improved261NA8YNβ-lactamase inhibitorsPosaconazoleNAOseltamivir80decrease3015Improved310NA9YNNAFluconazoleOseltamivirOseltamivir320decrease3024Improved352NA10YNNAMicafungin, Paediatric Compound sulfamethoxazoleNAOseltamivir80decrease2015Improved324NA11YNNANANAOseltamivir80decrease3010Improved344NAHFNC: High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy; N-IV: Non-invasive ventilator; BH:(Before admission to hospital; AH: After admission to hospital; &: Methylprednisolone; GSID: Glucocorticoid shock initial dose; TGDT: Trend of glucocorticoid dose adjustment during treatment ;§: Prednisone; SGID: Sequential glucocorticoid initiation dose; HD: Hospitalization days; OT: Oxygenation index (mmHg) after treatment; EBP: Elevated blood pressure; ※: Invasive mechanical ventilation is required.By the time of discharge, all patients showed improved clinical symptoms, no fever, and significantly improved dyspnea and lung imaging results.

DiscussionViruses pose a major threat to human health beyond SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-1928. Not only classic or major viruses (influenza virus, RSV, and rhinovirus) but also minor viruses (parainfluenza, adenovirus, and coronavirus 229E) fit the clinical-microbiological canon, which informs that “a virus is responsible for different diseases; the same disease is caused by different viruses”29.VPA is often a community-acquired infection caused by common pathogens, such as influenza virus, RSV, and adenovirus, and can be identified by chest CT showing airway-centered infection, bronchiolitis, and bronchopneumonia. Influenza viral infection in combination with bacterial and fungal infections can manifest as lung consolidation. Immunocompromised host-related community-acquired influenza virus-associated pneumonia is a common cause of severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome and has a high mortality rate30,31. Our retrospective analysis obtained the same results. Severe patients were mostly elderly or had underlying diseases. Simple influenza viral infections showed normal white blood cell counts and significantly decreased lymphocyte counts. Secondary bacterial and fungal infections may cause elevated white blood cell counts and PCT levels. Chest CT showed bronchopneumonia with multiple lobar involvement, and pulmonary consolidation was present when the viral infection was combined with bacterial and fungal infections.A series of studies have found that viral pneumonia can cause pulmonary fibrosis. One case report found secondary pulmonary fibrosis after ARDS in a patient with Influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia32. In a one-year follow-up study, Avinandan Saha et al., also found that patients with ARDS caused by H1N1 developed pulmonary fibrosis even after recovery. Noriko Nakajima et al. conducted a respiratory histopathological analysis of 20 autopsy cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection from August 2009 to February 2010, and they found that 12 cases (60%) showed pathological changes indicative of pulmonary fibrosis33.Glucocorticoids are recognized as powerful anti-inflammatory drugs, which can regulate the immune function of the body, exert anti-inflammatory function, inhibit the production of inflammatory factors, and reduce the immune response of the body34. However, there is still a lot of disagreement about how to treat severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia; Antoni Torres et al. found that the administration of glucocorticoids during the initial high inflammatory response to severe pneumonia improved treatment success35. A large retrospective study of critically ill influenza patients by Delaney et al. found an increased risk of death among those treated with glucocorticoids; however, there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups after adjusting for time variations36. Also, the potential differences between low-dose and medium-/high-dose glucocorticoid therapy have not been studied in depth. Cao, Bin et al. An observational study of hospitalized patients with VPA caused by the H7N9 avian influenza virus showed that high doses of glucocorticoids rather than low or medium doses of glucocorticoids were associated with increased mortality at 30 and 60 days37. A number of studies have shown that the application of glucocorticoids in severe pneumonia does not increase the mortality rate, but the serum inflammatory factors are more significantly reduced; clinical symptoms improve faster; and the length of hospital stay is shortened38–40.Marco Confalonieri et al. found that the use of glucocorticoids could save lives of critically ill patients infected with the H1N1 virus. In a study of 2 cases of H1N1-related pneumonia, Catherine Roberts et al. found that high-dose corticosteroids provided rapid relief of symptoms and/or complete recovery41. This retrospective study showed that high-dose steroid therapy for SVPA can improve patient symptoms, such as fever and breathing difficulty, improve finger pulse oxygen, and reduce intubation rates (two patients required tracheal intubation treatment, but the patients and their relatives refused the above treatment; hence, we increased the glucocorticoid dose, resulting in significant relief of respiratory distress symptoms and finger pulse oxygen in the patients). Our long-term application strategy of slow reduction of glucocorticoids has also been applied by other scholars in clinical application21. In addition, patients with pulmonary fibrosis were found to recover with combination treatment of pirfenidone, azithromycin, and prednisolone42. Our retrospective study also obtained the same result; we found that prolonged glucocorticoid therapy (oral administration of 20–30 mg prednisone tablets, with reduction of one tablet every 3–5 days) can reduce pulmonary fibrosis. Chest CT scans of the lungs after 4 weeks of discharge showed absorption of pulmonary inflammation in patients (Fig. 3). At the same time, no clear signs of co-infection were observed during glucocorticoid therapy. During hospitalization, we combined anti-infective and antifungal therapy based on the patient’s pathogen results, and some patients were given prophylactic anti-infective treatment with piperacillin-sulbactam, considering the severity of disease in the patients. After discharge, anti-infective or antifungal therapy was not applied. There were no fatal complications, and common complications were hyperglycemia and hypertension, which were due to underlying diseases. Medications could control the hypertension and hyperglycemia caused by glucocorticoids (Tables 1 and 2).The inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on viral pneumonia-induced lung fibrosis may be related to inhibition of the TGF-β/Smad pathway. Pulmonary fibrosis in H1N1 patients may be related to increased fibroblast activity in the post-inflammatory repair pathway. In this process, TGF-β and collagen play an important role. H1N1 infection enhances the expression of TGF-β and MAD-2 in macrophages and alveolar cells, suggesting that H1N1 may induce pulmonary fibrosis by activating the TGF-β/Smad pathway. In addition, influenza A virus infection can induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, triggering multiple reactions, such as Caspase-12-dependent epithelial cell apoptosis and JNK1-dependent TGF-β expression9. Glucocorticoids down-regulate the expression of TGF-β1 and 2 in lung fibroblasts by blocking the intrinsic positive feedback regulatory mechanism of TGF-β. In addition, glucocorticoids and TGF-β1 have a synergistic effect on fibrotic tissue remodeling. It has been confirmed that both Smad2 and Smad3 are involved in the up-regulation of TGF-β1-mediated glucocorticoid binding. Smads up-regulate glucocorticoid binding and signaling by activating protein-143. It can be seen that influenza virus, glucocorticoid, TGF-β/Smad are closely related to fibrosis.In summary, our retrospective study showed that high-dose glucocorticoid therapy was beneficial for the treatment of patients with severe influenza virus-associated pneumonia, and sequential orally administered glucocorticoid therapy was also helpful for reducing the occurrence of lung fibrosis. However, the limitations of our study were the small number of cases, and the potential for bias in patient selection due to the retrospective nature of the analysis. However, our study still provides clinicians with a treatment option, especially for critically ill patients who are unable to cope with the refusal of invasive mechanical ventilation, where glucocorticoid therapy may help save patients’ lives.
