The tumor suppressor gene product BRCA1 is a component of the RNA polymerase II 
(pol II) holoenzyme that is involved, through binding to various regulatory 
proteins, in either activation or repression of transcription. Using a yeast 
two-hybrid screen, we have identified a human zinc-finger-containing protein 
NUFIP that interacts with BRCA1. The ubiquitous, stably expressed, nuclear 
protein NUFIP specifically stimulates activator-independent pol II transcription 
in vitro and in vivo. Immunodepletion of the endogenous NUFIP causes a marked 
decrease of pol II transcription, which is then shown to be restored by stable 
complex of ectopically produced NUFIP and associated factors. NUFIP not only 
interacts with BRCA1 but also associates with the positive elongation factor 
P-TEFb through interaction with the regulatory Cyclin T1 subunit. Cyclin T1 is 
required for BRCA1- and NUFIP-dependent synergistic activation of pol II 
transcription in 293 cells. Mutation of the zinc-finger domain abolishes the 
NUFIP-mediated transcriptional activation. We show that NUFIP is associated with 
preinitiation complexes, open transcription complexes, and elongation complexes. 
In addition, NUFIP facilitates ATP-dependent dissociation of hyperphosphorylated 
pol II from open transcription complexes in vitro.
