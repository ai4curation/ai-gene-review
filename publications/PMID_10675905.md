Cellular morphology is determined by the organization of the intracellular actin 
cytoskeleton, which is influenced by external and internal cues. Focal adhesions 
are sites at which the actin cytoskeleton is linked to the extracellular matrix 
by integrin receptor complexes. In addition to providing structural tethering 
points for cells, integrin receptor complexes transduce signals that influence a 
broad range of cellular processes, including migration, proliferation, 
transformation and apoptosis. The Cas proteins (p130Cas, HEF1/Cas-L and 
Efs/Sin), a family of docking proteins containing multiple interaction domains, 
are important components of integrin receptor signalling and have been 
implicated in all of these processes.
