Type XIII collagen consists of a short N-terminal intracellular domain, a 
transmembrane domain, and a collagenous ectodomain, and it is found at many 
sites of cell adhesion. We report on the characterization of recombinant type 
XIII collagen. The shed ectodomain was purified from insect cell culture medium 
and shown to form 240-kDa trimers with a T(m) of 42 degrees C. Correct chain 
association into a triple-helical conformation was confirmed by limited pepsin 
digestion and CD spectroscopy. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy of the 
ectodomain revealed it to be a 150-nm rod with two flexible hinges separating 
31-, 52-, and 68-nm portions. The rods represent the collagenous domains 1-3, 
and the hinges coincide with the non-collagenous domains 2 and 3. By using 
surface plasmon resonance analysis, the ectodomain showed interaction with 
immobilized fibronectin, nidogen-2, and perlecan with K(D) values in the 
nanomolar range. The binding sites of type XIII collagen for fibronectin were 
localized to the collagenous domains, whereas the binding activities for 
nidogen-2 and perlecan resided in the pepsin-sensitive portions of the 
ectodomain. Furthermore, the ectodomain bound significantly to heparin, which 
also inhibited shedding of the ectodomain in insect cell cultures. The results 
reveal that type XIII collagen is notably distinct in its structure compared 
with other cell-surface proteins, and the in vitro binding with fibronectin, 
heparin, and two basement membrane components is indicative of multiple 
cell-matrix interactions in which this ubiquitously expressed protein 
participates.
