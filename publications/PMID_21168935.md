Breakdown of the inner blood-retinal barrier and the blood-brain barrier is 
associated with changes in tight and adherens junction-associated proteins that 
link vascular endothelial cells. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that 
transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 increases the paracellular permeability of 
vascular endothelial monolayers through tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin 
and claudin-5. Bovine retinal and human brain capillary endothelial cells were 
grown as monolayers on coated polycarbonate membranes. Paracellular permeability 
was studied by measuring the equilibration of (14)C-inulin or 
fluorescence-labelled dextran. Changes in VE-cadherin and claudin-5 expression 
were studied by immunocytochemistry (ICC) and quantified by cell-based enzyme 
linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and 
claudin-5 was studied by ICC, immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. We found 
that exposure of endothelial cells to TGF-β1 caused a dose-dependent increase in 
paracellular permeability as reflected by increases in the equilibration of 
(14)C-inulin. This effect was enhanced by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor 
orthovanadate and attenuated by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lavendustin A. ICC 
and cell-based ELISA revealed that TGF-β1 induced both dose- and time-dependent 
decreases in VE-cadherin and claudin-5 expression. Assessment of cell viability 
indicated that changes in these junction-associated proteins were not due to 
endothelial death or injury. ICC revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of 
endothelial monolayers was greatly enhanced by TGF-β1 treatment, and 
immunoprecipitation of cell lysates showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of 
VE-cadherin and claudin-5. Our results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of 
VE-cadherin and claudin-5 is involved in the increased paracellular permeability 
of central nervous system-derived vascular endothelium induced by TGF-β1.
