Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are linked to familial as well 
as sporadic forms of Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by dysfunction and degeneration of dopaminergic and other types of 
neurons. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying LRRK2 action remain 
poorly defined. Here, we show that LRRK2 controls synaptic morphogenesis at the 
Drosophila neuromuscular junction. Loss of Drosophila LRRK2 results in synaptic 
overgrowth, whereas overexpression of Drosophila LRRK or human LRRK2 has 
opposite effects. Alteration of LRRK2 activity also affects neurotransmission. 
LRRK2 exerts its effects on synaptic morphology by interacting with distinct 
downstream effectors at the presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments. At the 
postsynapse, LRRK2 interacts with the previously characterized substrate 4E-BP, 
an inhibitor of protein synthesis. At the presynapse, LRRK2 phosphorylates and 
negatively regulates the microtubule (MT)-binding protein Futsch. These results 
implicate synaptic dysfunction caused by deregulated protein synthesis and 
aberrant MT dynamics in LRRK2 pathogenesis and offer a new paradigm for 
understanding and ultimately treating PD.
