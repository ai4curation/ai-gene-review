OBJECTIVE: BRCA1, a tumor suppressor gene implicated in breast and ovarian 
cancers, exerts multiple effects on DNA repair and affords resistance against 
cellular stress responses. We hypothesized that BRCA1 limits endothelial cell 
apoptosis and dysfunction, and via this mechanism attenuates atherosclerosis.
METHODS: Loss and gain of function were achieved in cultured endothelial cells 
by silencing and overexpressing BRCA1, respectively. In vivo loss and gain of 
function were performed by generating endothelial cell-specific knockout 
(EC-BRCA1(-/-)) mice and administering a BRCA1 adenovirus. Well-established cell 
and animal models of angiogenesis and atherosclerosis were used.
RESULTS: BRCA1 is basally expressed in endothelial cells. BRCA1 overexpression 
protected and BRCA1 silencing exaggerated inflammation- and doxorubicin-induced 
endothelial cell apoptosis. Key indices of endothelial function were modulated 
in a manner consistent with an effect of BRCA1 to limit endothelial cell 
apoptosis and improve endothelial function. BRCA1 overexpression strongly 
attenuated the production of reactive oxygen species and upregulated endothelial 
nitric oxide synthase, phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase, 
phosphorylated Akt, and vascular endothelial growth factor-a expression. BRCA1 
overexpression also improved capillary density and promoted blood flow 
restoration in mice subjected to hind-limb ischemia. BRCA1-overexpressing 
ApoE(-/-) mice fed a Western diet developed significantly less aortic plaque 
lesions, exhibited reduced macrophage infiltration, and generated less reactive 
oxygen species. Lung sections and aortic segments from EC-BRCA1(-/-) mice 
demonstrated greater inflammation-associated apoptosis and impaired endothelial 
function, respectively. BRCA1 expression was attenuated in the plaque region of 
human atherosclerotic carotid artery samples compared with the adjacent 
plaque-free area.
CONCLUSIONS: These data collectively highlight a previously unrecognized role of 
BRCA1 as a gatekeeper of inflammation-induced endothelial cell function and a 
target to limit atherosclerosis. Translational studies evaluating endothelial 
function and atherosclerosis in individuals with BRCA1 mutations are suggested.
