The presence of multiple homologues of the same yeast Atg protein endows an 
additional layer of complexity on the autophagy pathway in higher eukaryotes. 
The physiological function of the individual genes, however, remains largely 
unknown. Here we investigated the role of the two Caenorhabditis elegans 
homologues of the cysteine protease Atg4 in the pathway responsible for 
degradation of protein aggregates. Loss of atg-4.1 activity causes defective 
degradation of a variety of protein aggregates, whereas atg-4.2 mutants remove 
these substrates normally. LGG-1 precursors accumulate in atg-4.1 mutants, but 
not atg-4.2 mutants. LGG-1 puncta, formation of which depends on lipidation of 
LGG-1, are present in atg-4.1 and atg-4.2 single mutants, but are completely 
absent in atg-4.1; atg-4.2 double mutants. In vitro enzymatic analysis revealed 
that ATG-4.1 processes LGG-1 precursors about 100-fold more efficiently than 
ATG-4.2. Expression of a mutant form LGG-1, which mimics the processed 
precursor, rescues the defective autophagic degradation of protein aggregates in 
atg-4.1 mutants and, to a lesser extent, in atg-4.1; atg-4.2 double mutants. Our 
study reveals that ATG-4.1 and ATG-4.2 are functionally redundant yet display 
differential LGG-1 processing and deconjugating activity in the aggrephagy 
pathway in C. elegans.
