Zinc is an essential nutrient for all organisms. Its requirement in humans is 
illustrated dramatically by the genetic disorder acrodermatitis enteropathica 
(AE). AE is caused by the reduced uptake of dietary zinc by enterocytes, and the 
ensuing systemic zinc deficiency leads to dermatological lesions and immune and 
reproductive dysfunction. The gene responsible for AE, SLC39A4, encodes a member 
of the ZIP family of metal transporters, hZIP4. The mouse ZIP4 protein, mZIP4, 
stimulates zinc uptake in cultured cells, and studies in mice have demonstrated 
that zinc treatment decreases mZIP4 mRNA levels in the gut. In this study, we 
demonstrated using transfected cultured cells that the mZIP4 protein is also 
regulated at a post-translational level in response to zinc availability. Zinc 
deficiency increased mZIP4 protein levels at the plasma membrane, and this was 
associated with increased zinc uptake. Significantly, treating cells with low 
micromolar zinc concentrations stimulated the rapid endocytosis of the 
transporter. Zinc-regulated localization of the human ZIP4 protein was also 
demonstrated in cultured cells. These findings suggest that zinc-regulated 
trafficking of human and mouse ZIP4 is a key mechanism controlling dietary zinc 
absorption and cellular zinc homeostasis.
