Sonic hedgehog (Shh), an organizing signal from ventral midline structures, is 
essential for the induction and maintenance of many ventral cell types in the 
embryonic neural tube. Olig1 and Olig2 are related basic helix-loop-helix 
factors induced by Shh in the ventral neural tube. Although expression analyses 
and gain-of-function experiments suggested that these factors were involved in 
motoneuron and oligodendrocyte development, they do not clearly define the 
functional differences between Olig1 and Olig2. We generated mice with a 
homozygous inactivation of Olig2. These mice did not feed and died on the day of 
birth. In the spinal cord of the mutant mice, motoneurons are largely eliminated 
and oligodendrocytes are not produced. Olig2(-/-) neuroepithelial cells in the 
ventral spinal cord failed to differentiate into motoneurons or oligodendrocytes 
and expressed an astrocyte marker, S100beta, at the time of oligodendrogenesis. 
Olig1 or Olig3, other family members, were expressed in the descendent cells 
that should have expressed Olig2. We concluded that Olig2 is an essential 
transcriptional regulator in motoneuron and oligodendrocyte development. Our 
data provide the first evidence that a single gene mutation leads to the loss of 
two cell types, motoneuron and oligodendrocyte.
