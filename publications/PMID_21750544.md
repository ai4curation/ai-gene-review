Segmentation is an organizing principle of body plans. The segmentation clock, a 
molecular oscillator best illustrated by the cyclic expression of Notch 
signalling genes, controls the periodic cleavage of somites from unsegmented 
presomitic mesoderm during vertebrate segmentation. Wnt3a controls the 
spatiotemporal expression of cyclic Notch genes; however, the underlying 
mechanisms remain obscure. Here we show by transcriptional profiling of Wnt3a 
(-/-) embryos that the bHLH transcription factor, Mesogenin1 (Msgn1), is a 
direct target gene of Wnt3a. To identify Msgn1 targets, we conducted genome-wide 
studies of Msgn1 activity in embryonic stem cells. We show that Msgn1 is a major 
transcriptional activator of a Notch signalling program and synergizes with 
Notch to trigger clock gene expression. Msgn1 also indirectly regulates cyclic 
genes in the Fgf and Wnt pathways. Thus, Msgn1 is a central component of a 
transcriptional cascade that translates a spatial Wnt3a gradient into a temporal 
pattern of clock gene expression.

Introduction

Somites are blocks of paraxial mesoderm that bud from the anterior PSM every 2 hours in the mouse embryo, and ultimately give rise to the musculoskeletal system. The timing of somitogenesis is controlled by a network of oscillating genes in the Notch, Wnt and Fgf signaling pathways 1 . Notch target genes such as Lunatic fringe (Lfng) are amongst the first cyclic genes to be characterized 2 . Lfng is first expressed in the posterior PSM and sweeps anteriorly, arresting as a stripe in the anterior PSM, before a repetitive wave of gene expression begins anew 3 , 4 , 5 . The oscillation frequency matches the rate of somite formation, leading to the proposal that cyclically-expressed genes constitute a segmentation clock that controls the timing of somitogenesis 6 . The demonstration that the Notch/Fgf pathways oscillate out of phase with the Wnt pathway 1 , and that the loss of activity of any one of the signaling pathways adversely affects oscillatory gene expression in all three pathways 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , strongly suggests that these signaling pathways interact in a coordinated and reciprocal fashion. Wnt3a, signaling via ®-catenin, controls oscillatory gene expression in the Notch pathway since cyclic Lfng expression ceases in the absence of either gene 7 , 8 , 11 . Although it has been proposed that Wnt signaling does so through the direct activation of the Notch ligand Dll1 12 , Dll1 levels remain surprisingly robust in Wnt3a mutants despite the dramatic down regulation of other direct Wnt target genes such as Axin2 7 , 11 . These results suggest that alternative mechanisms might account for the regulation of the Notch pathway and the segmentation clock by Wnt3a.

A posterior-anterior gradient of Wnt3a/®-catenin and Fgf activity across the PSM plays an important role in translating the rhythmic output of the segmentation clock into a periodic array of somites 13 , 14 . The Wnt/Fgf gradient positions segment boundaries by establishing a threshold of activity (termed the determination front), below which anterior PSM cells can respond to the segmentation clock by activating the boundary determination genes Mesoderm posterior 2 (Mesp2) and Ripply2 8 , 15 , 16 , 17 . Reduced Wnt3a/®-catenin signaling in the anterior PSM is crucial for determination front activity since the overactivation of ®-catenin in the anterior PSM maintained the clock and blocked Mesp2 / Ripply2 expression, resulting in a profound elongation of the PSM and delayed somitogenesis 8 , 18 . Thus, Wnt3a functions in both the clock and the determination front during somitogenesis, however it remains unclear how Wnt3a performs both functions.

Stimulation of the Wnt/®-catenin signaling pathway stabilizes ®-catenin, which interacts with members of the Lef/Tcf family of DNA-binding factors to activate the transcription of target genes 19 . We show here that the bHLH transcription factor gene Msgn1 is a target of the Wnt3a/®-catenin pathway and that the Wnt3a gradient defines the oscillatory field through the induction of Msgn1 . Msgn1 , in turn, directly activates the expression of Notch pathway genes, including cyclic genes. Thus, Msgn1 directly links the Wnt3a signaling gradient to the Notch signaling pathway and the segmentation clock.

Discussion

The original clock and wavefront model first proposed that the sequential and repetitive formation of somites arises from a cellular oscillator (the clock) periodically interacting with a wavefront of rapid cell change that moves progressively down the embryonic AP axis 42 . The discovery of oscillating genes in the Notch, Wnt3a and Fgf signaling pathways, and the demonstration that Wnt3a/Fgf signaling gradients define the traveling wavefront or determination front, suggests that Wnt3a functions in both the clock and the wavefront during somitogenesis. In this study, we have shown that Wnt3a controls the clock and the wavefront through the activation of the direct target gene Msgn1 and that Msgn1 plays a pivotal role in the segmentation clock by functioning to coordinate the Wnt and Notch pathways.

The expression of Wnt3a in the PS and tailbud 13 , 21 establishes a descending posterior-to-anterior nuclear gradient in the PSM of the transcriptional coactivator ®-catenin 18 . This ®-catenin gradient is reflected in the graded expression of some direct Wnt3a/®-catenin target genes such as Axin2 13 . Axin2 appears to be universally responsive to Wnt/β-catenin signaling since it is expressed at multiple sites of Wnt activity in the embryo and adult, as well as in Wnt/β-catenin-dependent tumors and cancer cell lines 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 . In contrast, Msgn1 expression is restricted to the embryonic PSM and is less graded than Axin2 during early somitogenesis stages, displaying a more defined border in the anterior PSM. The absence of Msgn1 expression at other sites of Wnt activity argues that additional pathways are required for the activation of Msgn1 in the PSM. This is supported by the demonstration that Tbx6, which is coexpressed with Msgn1 in the PSM, cooperates with the Wnt3a/β-catenin pathway to directly regulate the Msgn1 promoter (this work; 24 ). The broad expression of Msgn1 throughout the posterior PSM, collapses into a weak gradient in the absence of Tbx6 , suggesting that a major function of Tbx6 is to convert the “slope” of the Wnt3a gradient into a “step” of Msgn1 expression that displays a defined anterior border.

The anterior Msgn1 border lies immediately caudal to the segmental Mesp2 stripe and therefore marks the position of the determination front. Recent genetic studies have shown that the Wnt3a/β-catenin gradient regulates somitogenesis, at least in part, by positioning the determination front in the anterior PSM 8 , 18 . Our present work demonstrates that these same genetic manipulations of Wnt signaling that alter the determination front position, also correspondingly alter the position of the anterior boundary of Msgn1 expression. This boundary posteriorly regresses at the rate of one somite length during one period of somite formation 47 , indicating that the posterior-ward movement of the Msgn1 expression domain parallels the regression of the wavefront. Importantly, activation of Mesp2 and Ripply2 does not occur in Msgn1 −/− mutants ( Fig. 3 ; 20 ), suggesting that Msgn1 is required for posterior PSM progenitors to transition to anterior PSM fates and establish a segmental pre-pattern. Taken together, the data strongly argue that the Wnt3a/β-catenin gradient controls determination front activity through Msgn1, and that the anterior border of Msgn1 plays a key role in defining this activity.

Recent work has affirmed the essential role that the Notch pathway plays in the mammalian segmentation clock 9 . Wnt3a functions upstream of Notch to control cyclic gene expression in both the Wnt and Notch pathways, leading to the hypothesis that Wnt/β-catenin signaling drives the segmentation clock 13 . Studies of β-catenin mutants support this contention however the demonstration that Lfng continues to oscillate in the presence of a stabilized, non-cyclical form of β-catenin argues that β-catenin is not the clock pacemaker 8 , 18 . How then does the Wnt3a/β-catenin pathway regulate Notch signaling and the segmentation clock? One way is through the direct activation of Dll1 12 , 48 . We show here that Wnt3a, acting via Msgn1 , has a much broader role in Notch regulation, activating almost the entire Notch signaling pathway including cyclic target genes. Thus Msgn1 is a master regulator of the Notch pathway.

Although Msgn1 is required for Notch target gene expression, the Wnt target genes Sp5 and Axin2 were upregulated in Msgn1 mutants. This expression is similar to the enhanced expression previously reported 20 for another Wnt3a target gene T/Brachyury 49 , suggesting that Msgn1 directly, or indirectly, represses some Wnt targets. The divergent response of Wnt and Notch targets suggest that Msgn1 functions to coordinate these pathways in the segmentation clock. Despite our proposal that it plays a central role in the clock, Msgn1 is unlikely to function as the pacemaker since it is not expressed periodically. Our demonstration that Hes7 blocks the synergistic Msgn1-Notch activation of Lfng is consistent with previous suggestions that Hes7 is the pacemaker 29 . We suggest that cyclic gene expression in the Notch pathway requires two primary regulatory components: an activator, arising from the combined activity of Msgn1 and the Notch signaling pathway, and a short-lived periodic repressor, Hes7, which functions in an autoinhibitory feedback loop to periodically repress Hes7 and Lfng ( Fig. 8 ). Although it is well known that the Fgf pathway is also required for cyclic gene expression and for the proper expression of Msgn1 10 , the precise mechanisms remain unclear.

Interactions between the Notch and Wnt pathways are known to regulate the maintenance of stem cells, including hematopoietic and gastrointestinal stem cells 50 , 51 , 52 . This raises the intriguing possibility that a similar relationship between the Wnt and Notch pathways could maintain mesodermal stem cells in the segmenting embryo. Msgn1 regulates the maturation of these mesodermal progenitors since they accumulate as an undifferentiated mass in the tailbud of Msgn1 −/− embryos 20 and display impaired anterior-ward migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT). Since Wnt3a regulates the same processes, then it is possible that Wnt3a regulates mesodermal stem cell homeostasis, migration, EMT, and positional information through Msgn1 . The identification of the interacting proteins, and the genomic targets, of Msgn1 will greatly assist in our understanding of how Wnt signals regulate such numerous and diverse processes.
