The tumor suppressor function of p53 has been attributed to its ability to 
regulate apoptosis and the cell cycle. In mammals, DNA damage, aberrant growth 
signals, chemotherapeutic agents, and UV irradiation activate p53, a process 
that is regulated by several posttranslational modifications. In Drosophila 
melanogaster, however, the regulation modes of p53 are still unknown. 
Overexpression of D. melanogaster p53 (Dmp53) in the eye induced apoptosis, 
resulting in a small eye phenotype. This phenotype was markedly enhanced by 
coexpression with D. melanogaster Chk2 (DmChk2) and was almost fully rescued by 
coexpression with a dominant-negative (DN), kinase-dead form of DmChk2. DN 
DmChk2 also inhibited Dmp53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage, 
whereas overexpression of Grapes (Grp), the Drosophila Chk1-homolog, and its DN 
mutant had no effect on Dmp53-induced phenotypes. DmChk2 also activated the 
Dmp53 transactivation activity in cultured cells. Mutagenesis of Dmp53 amino 
terminal Ser residues revealed that Ser-4 is critical for its responsiveness 
toward DmChk2. DmChk2 activates the apoptotic activity of Dmp53 and Ser-4 is 
required for this effect. Contrary to results in mammals, Grapes, the Drosophila 
Chk1-homolog, is not involved in regulating Dmp53. Chk2 may be the ancestral 
regulator of p53 function.

Abstract

The tumor suppressor function of p53 has been attributed to its ability to regulate apoptosis and the cell cycle. In mammals, DNA damage, aberrant growth signals, chemotherapeutic agents, and UV irradiation activate p53, a process that is regulated by several posttranslational modifications. In Drosophila melanogaster , however, the regulation modes of p53 are still unknown. Overexpression of D. melanogaster p53 (Dmp53) in the eye induced apoptosis, resulting in a small eye phenotype. This phenotype was markedly enhanced by coexpression with D. melanogaster Chk2 (DmChk2) and was almost fully rescued by coexpression with a dominant-negative (DN), kinase-dead form of DmChk2. DN DmChk2 also inhibited Dmp53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage, whereas overexpression of Grapes (Grp), the Drosophila Chk1-homolog, and its DN mutant had no effect on Dmp53-induced phenotypes. DmChk2 also activated the Dmp53 transactivation activity in cultured cells. Mutagenesis of Dmp53 amino terminal Ser residues revealed that Ser-4 is critical for its responsiveness toward DmChk2. DmChk2 activates the apoptotic activity of Dmp53 and Ser-4 is required for this effect. Contrary to results in mammals, Grapes, the Drosophila Chk1-homolog, is not involved in regulating Dmp53. Chk2 may be the ancestral regulator of p53 function.

Discussion

Upon DNA damage, cells respond with cell cycle arrest and  activation of genes that coordinate DNA repair. If these mechanisms  fail, genomic instability and predisposition for the development of  cancer is the consequence.

Central to the execution of the DNA damage response is p53. Regulation  of p53 is coordinated mainly by two mechanisms: regulation of its  stability and its activity. Ionizing irradiation induces  phosphorylation of several amino-terminal amino acids of mammalian p53,  a process that is mediated by both Chk1 and Chk2 ( 7 , 8 ).  Phosphorylation of human p53 at Ser-20 interferes with binding of  murine double minute 2 protein (MDM2) to p53, thereby inhibiting  degradation of p53 and leading to an increase in p53 protein levels ( 5 , 8 , 12 ). The mechanism underlying the regulation of p53 transcriptional  activity is less clear, but phosphorylation of p53 could be involved in  this process as well. In mammals, both regulatory mechanisms are  tightly linked together and are difficult to differentiate. In Drosophila , genomewide searches have not identified an MDM2  homolog, allowing the investigation of the mechanism of p53-regulation  independent of MDM2.

In this study, we demonstrate that DmChk2 is a potent activator of  Dmp53. Expression of both molecules in the Drosophila eye  led to a massive reduction in eye size caused by an increase in the  number of apoptotic cells. Interestingly, the requirement for  DmChk2 to activate Dmp53 was observed only upon overexpression or Dmp53  or after radiation treatment, as overexpression of DmChk2 or DN-DmChk2  alone did not show a phenotype. Du and coworkers ( 28 ) also have shown  that flies homozygously deleted for DmChk2 are viable and lack obvious  phenotype in the absence of irradiation. These observations suggest  that endogenous Dmp53 may function primarily in a DNA  damage response. A kinase-dead, DN-DmChk2 was able to almost fully  rescue the p53-induced phenotype by inhibiting apoptosis in the  eye imaginal discs. A functional interaction between Grp and Dmp53  could not be detected, suggesting that DmChk2 is the principal  activator of Dmp53 in Drosophila . In an attempt to define  the molecular mechanism of the observed interaction between Dmp53 and  DmChk2, several point mutations were introduced into the amino-terminal  part of the Dmp53 molecule and tested for their responsiveness to  wild-type or DN-DmChk2. The transcriptional activity and the eye  phenotype caused by Dmp53-S4A mutant were unaffected by  coexpression with either wild-type or DN-DmChk2. These results indicate  that Ser-4 of Dmp53 confers responsiveness to DmChk2.

We hypothesized that the regulation of Dmp53 by DmChk2 could be  mediated by direct phosphorylation. However, in vitro DmChk2  kinase assays using wild-type or mutant glutathione S -transferase-p53 proteins as substrates did not detect any  differences in phosphorylation between the various p53 molecules (data  not shown). One explanation for this phenomenon is that DmChk2 does not  directly phosphorylate Ser-4 and that a DmChk2-regulated kinase is  involved in this process. Alternatively, DmChk2 may phosphorylate Dmp53  at multiple sites, preventing discrimination between wild-type and  Dmp53-S4A phosphorylation levels.

Dmp53-S4A overexpressing flies exhibited a similar phenotype to Dmp53  wild-type transgenic flies. This finding is surprising given that  DN-DmChk2 almost completely rescued the Dmp53-induced small eye  phenotype. There may be several reasons for this. Other signals not  related to DmChk2 that may or may not involve phosphorylation could be  constitutively active, resulting in p53 stabilization and  transcriptional activity. In this case, mutation of S4 could inhibit  further activation of Dmp53 but would not prevent the constitutive  activating signals present. Alternatively, introduction of the S4  mutation could introduce steric changes that confer increased stability  to the p53 molecule. The increased stability could also account for the  observed phenotype. A further possibility is that DmChk2 additionally  activates a kinase that phosphorylates Dmp53. In this situation,  mutation of Dmp53 Ser-4 would prevent direct activation of p53 but  would not interfere with indirect activation. This also would explain  why DN-DmChk2 could prevent Dmp53-mediated apoptosis.

We have shown that radiation-induced cell death is inhibited by  DN-Dmp53 and DN-DmChk2 and that apoptosis resulting from Dmp53  overexpression can be inhibited by a kinase-dead form of DmChk2. DmChk2  regulation of Dmp53 activity is crucial for γ-radiation-induced  apoptosis, consistent with data showing that DmChk2 functions  upstream of Dmp53 ( 8 ). In favor for this view, Du and coworkers  recently described DmChk2 null flies that are refractory to  apoptosis upon irradiation, suggesting that DmChk2 controls  Dmp53-induced apoptosis ( 28 ). However, we cannot rule out a  scenario in which Dmp53 and DmChk2 make independent contributions to  radiation-induced cell death, functioning in separate pathways.

As Drosophila most likely does not have an MDM2 gene, the  MDM2-mediated p53 degradation pathway could have emerged at a later  point in evolution. The data presented here suggest that  MDM2-independent regulation of Dmp53 is mediated by DmChk2 and  implies that DmChk1 does not function in this process. If  MDM2-independent regulation of p53 is more ancient in evolutionary  terms, then Chk2 may be the ancestral regulator of p53 activation.  Thus, MDM2 and Chk1 probably emerged as regulators of p53 at a later  evolutionary time.

The ability of DmChk2 to regulate transcriptional activity of Dmp53  suggests that in mammals Chk2 might be involved in control of both p53  stability and activity. Generation of mouse “knock-in” mutants  for individual amino-terminal p53 phosphorylation sites should aid in  resolution of apparent multiple roles of Chk2 in p53 regulation.
