Transmembrane and coiled-coil domain family 3 (TMCC3) has been reported to be 
expressed in the human brain; however, its function is still unknown. Here, we 
found that expression of TMCC3 is higher in human whole brain, testis and spinal 
cord compared to other human tissues. TMCC3 was expressed in mouse developing 
hind brain, lung, kidney and somites, with strongest expression in the 
mesenchyme of developing tongue. By expression of recombinant TMCC3 and its 
deletion mutants, we found that TMCC3 proteins self-assemble to oligomerize. 
Immunostaining and confocal microscopy data revealed that TMCC3 proteins are 
localized in endoplasmic reticulum through transmembrane domains. Based on 
immunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopy data, TMCC3 proteins associate with 
TMCC3 and 14-3-3 proteins. This supports the idea that TMCC3 proteins form 
oligomers and that 14-3-3 may be involved in the function of TMCC3. Taken 
together, these results may be useful for better understanding of 
uncharacterized function of TMCC3. [BMB Reports 2016; 49(11): 629-634].
