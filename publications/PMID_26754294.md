MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in regulation of tumor metastasis. 
However, the role of these molecules in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not 
been fully elucidated. In this study, we employed miRNA-sequencing and 
identified 22 miRNAs involved in HCC metastasis. One of these, miR-28-5p, was 
down-regulated in HCCs. This down-regulation correlated with tumor metastasis, 
recurrence, and poor survival. Biofunctional investigations revealed that 
miR-28-5p deficiency promoted tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice without 
altering the in vitro biological characteristics of HCC cells. Through gene 
expression profiles and bioinformatics analysis, we identified interleukin-34 
(IL-34) as a direct target of miR-28-5p, and the effects of miR-28-5p deficiency 
on HCC growth and metastasis was dependent on IL-34-mediated tumor-associated 
macrophage (TAM) infiltration. Moreover, we found that TAMs induced by 
miR-28-5p-IL-34 signaling inhibit miR-28-5p expression on HCC cells by 
transforming growth factor beta 1, resulting in an 
miR-28-5p-IL-34-macrophage-positive feedback loop. In clinical HCC samples, 
miR-28-5p levels were inversely correlated with IL-34 expression and the number 
of TAMs. Patients with low miR-28-5p expression, high IL-34 levels, and high 
numbers of TAMs had a poor prognosis with shorter overall survival and time to 
recurrence.
CONCLUSION: A miR-28-5p-IL-34-macrophage feedback loop modulates HCC metastasis 
and serves as a novel prognostic factor as well as a therapeutic target for HCC.
