Pathological innate and adaptive immune response upon viral infection may lead 
to cardiac injury and dysfunction. Stabilin-1 is a scavenger receptor that 
regulates several aspects of the innate immunity. Whether stabilin-1 affects the 
inflammatory response during viral myocarditis (VM) is entirely unknown. Here, 
we assess the role of stabilin-1 in the pathogenesis of VM and its suitability 
as a therapeutic target. Genetic loss of stabilin-1 increased mortality and 
cardiac necrosis in a mouse model of human Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced 
myocarditis. Absence of stabilin-1 significantly reduced monocyte recruitment 
and strongly reduced the number of alternatively activated anti-inflammatory 
macrophages in the heart, enhancing a pro-inflammatory cardiac niche with a 
detrimental T lymphocyte response during VM. Yeast two-hybrid screening, 
confirmed by affinity chromatography, identified fibronectin as a stabilin-1 
interacting partner. Absence of stabilin-1 specifically decreased monocyte 
adhesion on extracellular fibronectin in vitro. Loss of Type III repeats Extra 
Domain A (EDA) of fibronectin during VM also increased the mortality and cardiac 
necrosis as in stabilin-1 knockout mice, with reduced monocytic cardiac 
recruitment and increased T lymphocyte response. Collectively, stabilin-1 has an 
immune-suppressive role of limiting myocardial damage during VM, regulating 
anti-inflammatory monocyte-recruitment to the site of inflammation.
