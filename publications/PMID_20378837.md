Whereas cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence are traditionally thought 
of as the major functions of the tumor suppressor p53, recent studies revealed 
two unique functions for this protein: p53 regulates cellular energy metabolism 
and antioxidant defense mechanisms. Here, we identify glutaminase 2 (GLS2) as a 
previously uncharacterized p53 target gene to mediate these two functions of the 
p53 protein. GLS2 encodes a mitochondrial glutaminase catalyzing the hydrolysis 
of glutamine to glutamate. p53 increases the GLS2 expression under both 
nonstressed and stressed conditions. GLS2 regulates cellular energy metabolism 
by increasing production of glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate, which in turn 
results in enhanced mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation. Furthermore, 
GLS2 regulates antioxidant defense function in cells by increasing reduced 
glutathione (GSH) levels and decreasing ROS levels, which in turn protects cells 
from oxidative stress (e.g., H(2)O(2))-induced apoptosis. Consistent with these 
functions of GLS2, the activation of p53 increases the levels of glutamate and 
alpha-ketoglutarate, mitochondrial respiration rate, and GSH levels and 
decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in cells. Furthermore, GLS2 
expression is lost or greatly decreased in hepatocellular carcinomas and the 
overexpression of GLS2 greatly reduced tumor cell colony formation. These 
results demonstrated that as a unique p53 target gene, GLS2 is a mediator of 
p53's role in energy metabolism and antioxidant defense, which can contribute to 
its role in tumor suppression.

Abstract

Whereas cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence are traditionally thought of as the major functions of the tumor suppressor p53, recent studies revealed two unique functions for this protein: p53 regulates cellular energy metabolism and antioxidant defense mechanisms. Here, we identify glutaminase 2 (GLS2) as a previously uncharacterized p53 target gene to mediate these two functions of the p53 protein. GLS2 encodes a mitochondrial glutaminase catalyzing the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate. p53 increases the GLS2 expression under both nonstressed and stressed conditions. GLS2 regulates cellular energy metabolism by increasing production of glutamate and α-ketoglutarate, which in turn results in enhanced mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation. Furthermore, GLS2 regulates antioxidant defense function in cells by increasing reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and decreasing ROS levels, which in turn protects cells from oxidative stress (e.g., H 2 O 2 )-induced apoptosis. Consistent with these functions of GLS2, the activation of p53 increases the levels of glutamate and α-ketoglutarate, mitochondrial respiration rate, and GSH levels and decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in cells. Furthermore, GLS2 expression is lost or greatly decreased in hepatocellular carcinomas and the overexpression of GLS2 greatly reduced tumor cell colony formation. These results demonstrated that as a unique p53 target gene, GLS2 is a mediator of p53’s role in energy metabolism and antioxidant defense, which can contribute to its role in tumor suppression.

Discussion

The recent identification of SCO2 and TIGAR as two p53 target genes revealed p53’s role in enhancing mitochondrial respiration and inhibiting glycolysis ( 3 , 4 ). Here, we identified GLS2 as a unique p53 target gene involved in energy metabolism. The induction of GLS2 increases intracellular levels of glutamate and α-ketoglutarate and leads to the enhanced oxygen consumption, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP generation in cells. Through the regulation of GLS2, p53 increases the reliance upon glutamine metabolism, the production of glutamate and α-ketoglutarate, and mitochondrial respiration. Compared with p53-deficient cells, p53 wild-type cells have higher intracellular levels of glutamate and α-ketoglutarate, higher oxygen consumption, and higher rates of mitochondrial respiration, which are consistent with the effects of increased GLS2 expression in cells. These results demonstrated that the regulation of GLS2 and glutamine metabolism is a unique mechanism for p53 to regulate energy metabolism: restoring cells to a greater dependence upon oxidative phosphorylation.

p53 has been reported to modulate up cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms, especially under conditions of no stress or low stress, and this antioxidant activity plays an important role in the overall tumor suppressor function of p53 ( 5 ). Here, p53 promotes the expression of several antioxidant proteins that function to lower ROS levels, including sestrins, TIGAR, GPX1, and ALDH4. Sestrins are a family of proteins required for regeneration of peroxiredoxins, the major reductants of endogenously produced peroxides in cells ( 9 ). TIGAR diverts glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway to lower ROS levels ( 4 ). ALDH4 is a mitochondrial NAD+-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the proline degradation pathway to lower ROS levels ( 11 ). GPX1 is a primary antioxidant enzyme that scavenges hydrogen peroxide or organic hydroperoxides in cells ( 10 ). The identification of GLS2 as a p53-regulated gene that functions to lower ROS levels provides further direct evidence to support the important role of p53 in antioxidant defense in cells. GLS2 increases GSH levels and reduces ROS levels in cells through increasing the levels of glutamate, a precursor of GSH. Furthermore, GLS2 increases the NADH levels. These effects contribute to GLS2’s function in lowering ROS levels in cells and thus protect cells from oxidative stress (H 2 O 2 )-induced cell death. These findings presented here not only provide further strong evidence that p53 plays an important role in cellular antioxidant defense, but also provide a unique mechanism for p53 in the regulation of antioxidant defense mechanisms through regulating glutamine metabolism and GSH production.

Our results that GLS2 levels were significantly decreased in HCC and that overexpression of GLS2 in tumor cells, including HCC cells, significantly reduced tumor cell colony formation strongly suggest a potential role of GLS2 in tumor cell growth suppression. It is known that GLS2 is expressed only in postnatal liver but not in fetal liver ( 12 ). Fetal liver, like cancer cells, use glycolysis to generate ATP and precursors for cell division. GLS2 promotes oxidative phosphorylation and the efficient use of glucose to produce ATP. Therefore, loss of GLS2 expression in HCC suggests that liver tumor cells return to a fetal-like metabolic phenotype after neoplastic transformation. Consistent with our findings, it was recently reported that GLS2 expression is lost in many brain tumors, including highly malignant glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas, and restoration of GLS2 expression in glioblastoma cells inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration ( 20 ). Brain is one of several tissues where GLS2 is highly expressed. These data together strongly suggest a potential role of GLS2 in tumor suppression. Interestingly, the GLS1 gene located in 2q32 shares a considerable degree of sequence similarity with GLS2 and encodes a kidney-type glutaminase isoform (~70 kDa). The oncogene Myc was reported to increase GLS1 expression and promote tumor cell proliferation in human P-493 B lymphoma and PC3 prostate cancer cells ( 21 ). It appears that GLS1 and GLS2 may have contrasting roles in tumorigenesis. Several possible mechanisms may account for this: ( i ) The expression of GLS1 and GLS2 is regulated by different mechanisms in cells under different circumstances. For example, p53 induces the expression of GLS2 but not GLS1 as we observed in various cells. Myc induces the expression of GLS1 but not GLS2 ( 21 ). ( ii ) GLS1 and GLS2 have different kinetic, immunologic, and molecular characteristics. GLS1 is activated by high phosphate levels and strongly inhibited by the end-product glutamate, whereas GLS2 is activated by low phosphate levels and not inhibited by glutamate ( 13 ). Therefore, these two glutaminase isoforms may have different impacts upon the fine regulation of energy metabolism and antioxidant defense. ( iii ) GLS2 has been reported to interact with other proteins through the PDZ domain in its C terminus ( 22 ). GLS2 may exert its anti-tumorigenesis effect through its interaction with other PDZ domain-containing proteins; and further, ( iv ) GLS2 overexpression in cells results in altered expression of genes, suggesting that GLS2 may act indirectly or directly as a transcription factor ( 20 ). Further studies are required to address the quite different roles and mechanisms for GLS1 and GLS2 in tumorigenesis.

In summary, we identified glutaminase 2 as a unique p53 target gene. GLS2 increases mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation. Furthermore, GLS2 increases cellular levels of GSH and NADH and decreases ROS levels in cells. Our results demonstrate that GLS2 is an important component in mediating these two unique functions of p53 in the regulation of energy metabolism and antioxidant defense.
