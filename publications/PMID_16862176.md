Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is an important regulator of epidermal 
homeostasis and repair. Therefore, the identification of KGF target genes in 
keratinocytes should contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms 
underlying these processes. In a search for KGF-regulated genes, we identified 
the gene encoding the nucleoside diphosphate kinase NM23-H1. Apart from a 
housekeeping function, NM23 proteins are involved in the regulation of many 
cellular processes as well as in tumor metastasis, but their functions in 
epidermal homeostasis and repair are largely unknown. Here, we show a high 
expression of NM23-H1 and NM23-H2 in the KGF-responsive keratinocytes of the 
hyperproliferative epidermis of mouse skin wounds and of patients suffering from 
the skin disease psoriasis. To determine if this overexpression is functionally 
important, we generated HaCaT keratinocyte cell lines overexpressing NM23-H1 
and/or -H2. Whereas the enhanced levels of NM23 did not affect cell 
proliferation in monoculture, NM23-H2 and double transfectants but not NM23-H1 
transfectants formed a strongly hyperthickened epithelium in three-dimensional 
organotypic cultures. The abnormal epithelial morphology resulted from enhanced 
proliferation, reduced apoptosis and alterations in the differentiation pattern. 
These findings suggest that epidermal homeostasis depends on a tight regulation 
of the levels of NM23 isoforms.
