The Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multi-subunit 
complex that can be structurally and functionally divided into peripheral (V1) 
and integral membrane (V0) sectors. The vma22-1 mutation was isolated in a 
screen for mutants defective in V-ATPase function vma22 delta cells contain no 
V-ATPase activity due to a failure to assemble the enzyme complex; V1 subunits 
accumulate in the cytosol, and the V0 100-kDa subunit is rapidly degraded. 
Turnover of the 100-kDa integral membrane protein was found to occur in the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of vma22 delta cells. The product of the VMA22 gene, 
Vma22p, is a 21-kDa hydrophilic protein that is not a subunit of the V-ATPase 
but rather is associated with ER membranes. The association of Vma22p with ER 
membranes was perturbed by mutations in VMA12, a gene that encodes an ER 
membrane protein (Vma12p) that is also required for V-ATPase assembly. These 
results indicate that Vma22p, along with Vma21p and Vma12p, form a set of ER 
proteins required for V-ATPase assembly.
