Cysteine oxidation of the two RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) of TDP-43, 
a multi-domain protein involved in neurodegenerative diseases, results in loss 
of function and accumulation of insoluble aggregates under both in vitro and in 
vivo conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms linking cysteine oxidation to 
protein aggregation and functional aberration remain unknown. We report that 
oxidation of cysteines in RRM1, but not in other domains, induced conformational 
changes which subsequently resulted in protein aggregation and loss of nucleic 
acid-binding activity. Thus, oxidation-induced conformational change of RRM1 
plays a key role in TDP-43 aggregation and disease progression.
