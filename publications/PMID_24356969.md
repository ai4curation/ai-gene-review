p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is necessary for proper control of the 
cell cycle and premature senescence. Thus, p21 expression needs to be tightly 
controlled. In this study, we found that Rbm24, an RNA-binding protein and a 
target gene of the p53 protein, can regulate p21 expression via mRNA stability. 
Specifically, we showed that Rbm24 is induced by DNA damage and Mdm2 inhibitor 
Nutlin-3. We also found that p53 protein binds to and activates the promoter of 
the Rbm24 gene. Moreover, we found that overexpression of Rbm24 increases, 
whereas knockdown of Rbm24 decreases, p21 mRNA and protein expression. In 
addition, we demonstrated that overexpression of Rbm24 enhances the half-life of 
p21 transcript. Consistent with this, we provided evidence that Rbm24 binds to 
the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of p21 transcript and an AU/U-rich element 
in the p21 3'-UTR is necessary for Rbm24 to increase p21 expression. Finally, we 
showed that the RNA recognition motif in Rbm24 is required for binding to p21 
transcript and subsequently for inducing p21 expression. Altogether, we 
uncovered that Rbm24 is a novel player in the p53 pathway, which may be explored 
to restore proper cell cycle control in p53-deficient tumors via p21.

Introduction

The p53 tumor suppressor plays a central role in suppressing cancer development. The importance of p53 is evidenced as loss or inactivation of functional p53 in >50% of human cancers ( 1 ). In response to stress signals, such as DNA damage, hypoxia, or activated oncogenes, p53 is activated and functions as a transcriptional factor to induce a number of downstream targets, including p21 waf1/cip1 , PUMA , and DEC1 . These p53 targets mediate diverse cellular functions of p53 tumor suppressor, including cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis ( 2 – 5 ).

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) 2 are known to play a key role in post-transcriptional regulation, including mRNA stabilization and translation ( 6 – 8 ). Many oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are under the control of RBPs in mammalian cancer cell lines ( 9 ). Rbm38, also known as RNPC1, is an RNA-binding protein that has been found to be overexpressed in various types of cancer, including colon carcinoma ( 10 ), esophageal cancer ( 11 ), and lymphoma ( 10 , 12 ). Rbm38 contains a highly conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), which consists of two submotifs, RNP1 and RNP2 ( 13 ). Previous studies showed that Rbm38 is a target of the p53 family and regulates p21 mRNA stability by binding to AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) ( 13 , 14 ). Interestingly, we found that another RBP, Rbm24, shares high similarity with Rbm38 in the RRM region ( Fig. 1 A ). Rbm24 has been found to be preferentially expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues ( 15 , 16 ). Rbm24 is necessary for sarcomere assembly and heart contractility, suggesting that Rbm24 plays an important role in myogenic differentiation and heart development ( 15 – 17 ). Similarly, Rbm24 possesses one conserved RRM, including two submotifs, RNP1 and RNP2 ( 17 ). However, the role of Rbm24 in the p53 pathway is unclear.

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is a major mediator of p53 to induce cell cycle arrest in G 1 ( 5 ). In addition, p21 plays a vital role in cellular senescence and modulation of apoptosis and differentiation ( 5 , 18 – 20 ). Due to these important functions of p21, tight control of p21 expression is essential to maintain proper cell cycle regulation in cells to combat tumorigenesis. Indeed, the level of p21 is highly regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels ( 21 ). For example, the p53 family proteins, including p53, p63, and p73, regulate p21 transcriptionally ( 22 – 24 ), whereas several RBPs, including RRM-containing proteins Rbm38, HuD, and HuR, regulate p21 mRNA stability through binding of AREs in the p21 3′-UTR ( 13 , 14 , 25 – 27 ). Additionally, poly(C)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1), PCBP2, and PCBP4, which all contain several K homology domains, regulate p21 mRNA stability through binding of CU-rich elements in the p21 3′-UTR ( 28 , 29 ). Previously, we found that Rbm38, a target of the p53 family, cooperates with HuR to regulate p21 mRNA stability by binding to AREs in the 3′-UTR ( 13 , 14 ). Consistent with this finding, Rbm38 has been reported to regulate myogenic differentiation via stabilization of the p21 transcript ( 15 ). As Rbm24 and Rbm38 share a similarity in RRM, we hypothesize that Rbm24 may also be a target of p53 and serve as a mediator of p53 to regulate p21 post-transcriptionally.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we showed that Rbm24, an RNA-binding protein that shares a highly similar RRM with Rbm38, is a novel target of p53 and regulates p21 expression via mRNA stability. Specifically, we showed that Rbm24 can be induced upon DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. We also showed that p53 binds to the promoter of the Rbm24 gene and transcriptionally regulates Rbm24 through a p53-responsive element found in the Rbm24 promoter. Moreover, we found that overexpression of Rbm24 increases, whereas knockdown of Rbm24 decreases, p21 expression independent of p53. Importantly, we provided evidence that Rbm24 is required for the maintenance of the stability of p21 transcript through binding to the ARE in the p21 3′-UTR. Finally, we found that the RRM of Rbm24 is required for stabilizing p21 transcript. Together, we hypothesize that in response to stress signals, p53 is activated and induces its target gene Rbm24 , which in turn regulates p21 mRNA stability, leading to enhanced cell cycle arrest ( Fig. 7 C ).

The 3′-UTR of p21 transcript can be directly recognized by several RNA-binding proteins, including Rbm38, HuR, and HuD ( 14 , 25 , 26 ). Previously, we showed that Rbm38 and HuR can bind the ARE in the p21 3′-UTR, and Rbm38 can modulate and cooperate with HuR to regulate p21 mRNA stability ( 14 ). However, Rbm38 may compete with HuD in binding to the ARE in the p21 3′-UTR ( 14 ). The similarity in the regulation of p21 by Rbm24 versus Rbm38 is probably due to their similarity in the RNA-binding domain and the surrounding sequence ( Fig. 1 A ). Moreover, RRM is also known to be involved in protein-protein interaction ( 40 ). Therefore, it is possible that Rbm24 may cooperate or compete with other AU-/CU-rich binding and RRM-containing RBPs, including Rbm38 and HuD, to bind to their corresponding sequences and consequently regulate p21 mRNA stability. In addition, p21 is known to be regulated by PCBP1, PCBP2, and PCBP4 ( 28 , 29 ). Thus, further studies are warranted to examine whether Rbm24 cooperates or antagonizes with the PCBP proteins to regulate p21. Interestingly, our study implies that other Rbm38-regulated targets, such as p53, Mdm2, p63, and p73, may also be regulated by Rbm24. However, several regions, especially the C terminus in Rbm24, are quite different from that in Rbm38 ( Fig. 1 A ), suggesting that their biological functions and the mechanism by which these two RBPs regulate the p53 pathway may be different.

Rbm38 is known to be overexpressed in various human cancers, such as colon carcinoma ( 30 ), lymphoma ( 29 ), and esophageal cancer ( 31 ), but down-regulated due to hypermethylation in the promoter region in some breast tumors ( 26 ). Both Rbm38 and Rbm24 have been shown to play a role in muscle development ( 15 ), and Rbm24 is also found to play a role in myogenic differentiation, sarcomere assembly, and heart contractility ( 15 – 17 ). Here, we have shown that Rbm24 can directly bind to p21 mRNA and regulate its stability, which is consistent with its role in myogenesis ( 15 ). However, the Rbm24 gene has not been found to be altered in cancer. Due to loss of p53 or other factors required for p21 expression, tumor cells may undergo uncontrolled proliferation and eventually form malignant tumors ( 41 ). Because proper cell cycle control in tumors is an active approach to suppress cell transformation and tumorigenesis ( 42 ), the regulation of p21 expression by Rbm24 may be explored to restore normal cell cycle control in p53-deficient tumor cells.
