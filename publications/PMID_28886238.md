Cullin 4 (CUL4) and small ring finger protein ROC1 assemble to form E3 ubiquitin 
ligase (CRL4) complexes. CUL4 interacts with WD-40 proteins through the adaptor 
protein DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1) to target substrates for 
ubiquitylation. Very little is known on how the CUL4 and DDB1 interaction is 
regulated. Here, we show that DDB1 is acetylated and acetylation promotes DDB1 
binding to CUL4. We also identify nucleolar sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) as a major 
deacetylase that negatively regulates DDB1-CUL4 interaction. Following 
inhibition of nucleolar function by actinomycin D or 5-fluorouracil treatment or 
knocking down the gene for the RNA polymerase I component UBF, SIRT7 is 
mobilized from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and promotes DDB1 deacetylation, 
leading to decreased DDB1-CUL4 association and CRL4 activity. This results in 
the accumulation or activation of CRL4 substrates including LATS1 and p73, which 
contribute to cell apoptosis induced by actinomycin D and 5-fluorouracil. Our 
study uncovers a novel regulation of CRL4 E3 ligase complexes.
