DRB is a classic inhibitor of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (pol 
II). Since DRB generally affects class II genes, factors involved in this 
process must play fundamental roles in pol II elongation. Recently, two 
elongation factors essential for DRB action were identified, namely DSIF and 
P-TEFb. Here we describe the identification and purification from HeLa nuclear 
extract of a third protein factor required for DRB-sensitive transcription. This 
factor, termed negative elongation factor (NELF), cooperates with DSIF and 
strongly represses pol II elongation. This repression is reversed by 
P-TEFb-dependent phosphorylation of the pol II C-terminal domain. NELF is 
composed of five polypeptides, the smallest of which is identical to RD, a 
putative RNA-binding protein of unknown function. This study reveals a molecular 
mechanism for DRB action and a regulatory network of positive and negative 
elongation factors.
