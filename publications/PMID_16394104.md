The focal adhesion-associated signaling protein HEF1 undergoes a striking 
relocalization to the spindle at mitosis, but a function for HEF1 in mitotic 
signaling has not been demonstrated. We here report that overexpression of HEF1 
leads to failure of cells to progress through cytokinesis, whereas depletion of 
HEF1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) leads to defects earlier in M phase before 
cleavage furrow formation. These defects can be explained mechanistically by our 
determination that HEF1 regulates the activation cycle of RhoA. Inactivation of 
RhoA has long been known to be required for cytokinesis, whereas it has recently 
been determined that activation of RhoA at the entry to M phase is required for 
cellular rounding. We find that increased HEF1 sustains RhoA activation, whereas 
depleted HEF1 by siRNA reduces RhoA activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 
chemical inhibition of RhoA is sufficient to reverse HEF1-dependent cellular 
arrest at cytokinesis. Finally, we demonstrate that HEF1 associates with the 
RhoA-GTP exchange factor ECT2, an orthologue of the Drosophila cytokinetic 
regulator Pebble, providing a direct means for HEF1 control of RhoA. We conclude 
that HEF1 is a novel component of the cell division control machinery and that 
HEF1 activity impacts division as well as cell attachment signaling events.
