Telomere maintenance is essential for protecting chromosome ends. Aberrations in 
telomere length have been implicated in cancer and aging. Telomere elongation by 
human telomerase is inhibited in cis by the telomeric protein TRF1 and its 
associated proteins. However, the link between TRF1 and inhibition of telomerase 
elongation of telomeres remains elusive because TRF1 has no direct effect on 
telomerase activity. We have previously identified one Pin2/TRF1-interacting 
protein, PinX1, that has the unique property of directly binding and inhibiting 
telomerase catalytic activity (Zhou, X. Z., and Lu, K. P. (2001) Cell 107, 
347-359). However, nothing is known about the role of the PinX1-TRF1 interaction 
in the regulation of telomere maintenance. By identifying functional domains and 
key amino acid residues in PinX1 and TRF1 responsible for the PinX1-TRF1 
interaction, we show that the TRF homology domain of TRF1 interacts with a 
minimal 20-amino acid sequence of PinX1 via hydrophilic and hydrophobic 
interactions. Significantly, either disrupting this interaction by mutating the 
critical Leu-291 residue in PinX1 or knocking down endogenous TRF1 by RNAi 
abolishes the ability of PinX1 to localize to telomeres and to inhibit telomere 
elongation in cells even though neither has any effect on telomerase activity 
per se. Thus, the telomerase inhibitor PinX1 is recruited to telomeres by TRF1 
and provides a critical link between TRF1 and telomerase inhibition to prevent 
telomere elongation and help maintain telomere homeostasis.
