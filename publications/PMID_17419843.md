Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is usually described as a phenomenon whereby 
localized inoculation with a necrotizing pathogen renders a plant more resistant 
to subsequent pathogen infection. Here we show that Pseudomonas syringae strains 
for which Arabidopsis thaliana represents a non-host plant systemically elevate 
resistance although the underlying interactions neither trigger a hypersensitive 
response nor cause necrotic disease symptoms. A similar enhancement of systemic 
resistance was observed when elicitor-active preparations of two typical 
bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), flagellin and 
lipopolysaccharides (LPS), were applied in a localized manner. Several lines of 
evidence indicate that the observed systemic resistance responses are identical 
to SAR. Localized applications of non-adapted bacteria, flagellin or LPS elevate 
levels of the SAR regulatory metabolite salicylic acid (SA) and 
pathogenesis-related (PR) gene expression not only in treated but also in 
distant leaves. All treatments also systemically increase expression of the SAR 
marker gene FLAVIN-DEPENDENT MONOOXYGENASE 1. Further, a whole set of 
SAR-deficient Arabidopsis lines, including mutants in SA biosynthesis and 
signalling, are impaired in establishing the systemic resistance response 
triggered by non-host bacteria or PAMPs. We also show that the magnitude of 
defence reactions such as SA accumulation, PR gene expression or camalexin 
accumulation induced at sites of virulent or avirulent P. syringae inoculation 
but not the extent of tissue necrosis during these interactions determines the 
extent of SAR in distant leaves. Our data indicate that PAMPs significantly 
contribute to SAR initiation in Arabidopsis and that tissue necroses at 
inoculation sites are dispensable for SAR activation.
