GABA(B) receptors are the G-protein-coupled receptors for gamma-aminobutyric 
acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. They are 
expressed in almost all neurons of the brain, where they regulate synaptic 
transmission and signal propagation by controlling the activity of voltage-gated 
calcium (Ca(v)) and inward-rectifier potassium (K(ir)) channels. Molecular 
cloning revealed that functional GABA(B) receptors are formed by the heteromeric 
assembly of GABA(B1) with GABA(B2) subunits. However, cloned GABA(B(1,2)) 
receptors failed to reproduce the functional diversity observed with native 
GABA(B) receptors. Here we show by functional proteomics that GABA(B) receptors 
in the brain are high-molecular-mass complexes of GABA(B1), GABA(B2) and members 
of a subfamily of the KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing) 
proteins. KCTD proteins 8, 12, 12b and 16 show distinct expression profiles in 
the brain and associate tightly with the carboxy terminus of GABA(B2) as 
tetramers. This co-assembly changes the properties of the GABA(B(1,2)) core 
receptor: the KCTD proteins increase agonist potency and markedly alter the 
G-protein signalling of the receptors by accelerating onset and promoting 
desensitization in a KCTD-subtype-specific manner. Taken together, our results 
establish the KCTD proteins as auxiliary subunits of GABA(B) receptors that 
determine the pharmacology and kinetics of the receptor response.
