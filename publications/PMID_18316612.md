Malignant glioma is a consistently fatal brain cancer. The tumor invades the 
surrounding tissue, limiting complete surgical removal and thereby initiating 
recurrence. Identifying molecules critical for glioma invasion is essential to 
develop targeted, effective therapies. The expression of astrocyte elevated 
gene-1 (AEG-1) increases in malignant glioma and AEG-1 regulates in vitro 
invasion and migration of malignant glioma cells by activating the nuclear 
factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. The present studies elucidate the 
domains of AEG-1 important for mediating its function. Serial NH(2)-terminal and 
COOH-terminal deletion mutants were constructed and functional analysis revealed 
that the NH(2)-terminal 71 amino acids were essential for invasion, migration, 
and NF-kappaB-activating properties of AEG-1. The p65-interaction domain was 
identified between amino acids 101 to 205, indicating that p65 interaction alone 
is not sufficient to mediate AEG-1 function. Coimmunoprecipitation assays 
revealed that AEG-1 interacts with cyclic AMP-responsive element binding 
protein-binding protein (CBP), indicating that it might act as a bridging factor 
between NF-kappaB, CBP, and the basal transcription machinery. Chromatin 
immunoprecipitation assays showed that AEG-1 is associated with the NF-kappaB 
binding element in the interleukin-8 promoter. Thus, AEG-1 might function as a 
coactivator for NF-kappaB, consequently augmenting expression of genes necessary 
for invasion of glioma cells. In these contexts, AEG-1 represents a viable 
potential target for the therapy of malignant glioma.
