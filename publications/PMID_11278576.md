Mammalian selenocysteine-containing proteins characterized with respect to 
function are involved in redox processes and exhibit distinct expression 
patterns and cellular locations. A recently identified 15-kDa selenoprotein 
(Sep15) has no homology to previously characterized proteins, and its function 
is not known. Here we report the intracellular localization and identification 
of a binding partner for this selenoprotein which implicate Sep15 in the 
regulation of protein folding. The native Sep15 isolated from rat prostate and 
mouse liver occurred in a complex with a 150-kDa protein. The latter protein was 
identified as UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGTR), the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein, which was previously shown to be 
involved in the quality control of protein folding. UGTR functions by 
glucosylating misfolded proteins, retaining them in the ER until they are 
correctly folded or transferring them to degradation pathways. To determine the 
intracellular localization of Sep15, we expressed a green fluorescent 
protein-Sep15 fusion protein in CV-1 cells, and this protein was localized to 
the ER and possibly other perinuclear compartments. We determined that Sep15 
contained the N-terminal signal peptide that was essential for translocation and 
that it was cleaved in the mature protein. However, C-terminal sequences of 
Sep15 were not involved in trafficking and retention of Sep15. The data suggest 
that the association between Sep15 and UGTR is responsible for maintaining the 
selenoprotein in the ER. This report provides the first example of the 
ER-resident selenoprotein and suggests a possible role of the trace element 
selenium in the quality control of protein folding.
