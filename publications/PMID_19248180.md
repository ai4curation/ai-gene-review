Human GATA3 haploinsufficiency leads to HDR (hypoparathyroidism, deafness, and 
renal dysplasia) syndrome. The development of a specific subset of organs in 
which this transcription factor is expressed appears exquisitely sensitive to 
gene dosage. We report on a 14-year-old patient with symptomatic 
hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural bilateral deafness, unilateral renal 
dysplasia, bilateral palpebral ptosis, and horizontal nystagmus. Fundoscopy 
displayed symmetrical pseudopapilledema, and brain CT scan revealed basal 
ganglia calcifications. FISH analysis did not disclose any microdeletion in the 
22q11.2 or 10p14 regions. GATA3 mutation analysis identified a heterozygous 
deletion of GG nucleotides at codon 36 and 37 (c.108_109delGG) in exon 2 causing 
a frameshift with a premature stop codon after a new 15-aminoacid sequence. 
Restriction endonuclease analysis performed in parents was negative. Our patient 
carries a novel "de novo" GATA3 mutation, providing further evidence that HDR 
syndrome is caused by haploinsufficiency of GATA3, which may be responsible for 
a complex neurologic picture besides the known triad.
