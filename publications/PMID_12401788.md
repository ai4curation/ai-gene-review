The heterotrimeric transcription factor NF-Y recognizes with high specificity 
and affinity the CCAAT regulatory element that is widely represented in 
promoters and enhancer regions. The CCAAT box acts in concert with neighboring 
elements, and its bending by NF-Y is thought to be a major mechanism required 
for transcription activation. We have solved the structure of the NF-YC/NF-YB 
subcomplex of NF-Y, which shows that the core domains of both proteins interact 
through histone fold motifs. This histone-like pair is closely related to the 
H2A/H2B and NC2alpha/NC2beta families, with features that are both common to 
this class of proteins and unique to NF-Y. The structure together with the 
modeling of the nonspecific interaction of NF-YC/NF-YB with DNA and the full 
NF-Y/CCAAT box complex highlight important structural features that account for 
different and possibly similar biological functions of the transcriptional 
regulators NF-Y and NC2. In particular, it emphasizes the role of the newly 
described alphaC helix of NF-YC, which is both important for NF-Y trimerization 
and a target for regulatory proteins, such as MYC and p53.
