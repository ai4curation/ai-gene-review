Complex III (CIII; ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase of the mitochondrial 
respiratory chain) catalyzes electron transfer from succinate and nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide-linked dehydrogenases to cytochrome c. CIII is made up of 
11 subunits, of which all but one (cytochrome b) are encoded by nuclear DNA. 
CIII deficiencies are rare and manifest heterogeneous clinical presentations. 
Although pathogenic mutations in the gene encoding mitochondrial cytochrome b 
have been described, mutations in the nuclear-DNA-encoded subunits have not been 
reported. Involvement of various genes has been indicated in assembly of yeast 
CIII (refs. 8-11). So far only one such gene, BCS1L, has been identified in 
human. BCS1L represents, therefore, an obvious candidate gene in CIII 
deficiency. Here, we report BCS1L mutations in six patients, from four unrelated 
families and presenting neonatal proximal tubulopathy, hepatic involvement and 
encephalopathy. Complementation study in yeast confirmed the deleterious effect 
of these mutations. Mutation of BCS1L would seem to be a frequent cause of CIII 
deficiency, as one-third of our patients have BCS1L mutations.
