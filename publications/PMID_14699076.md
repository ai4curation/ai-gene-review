Batten disease is a neurodegenerative disorder resulting from mutations in CLN3, 
a polytopic membrane protein, whose predominant intracellular destination in 
nonneuronal cells is the lysosome. The topology of CLN3 protein, its lysosomal 
targeting mechanism, and the development of Batten disease are poorly 
understood. We provide experimental evidence that both the N and C termini and 
one large loop domain of CLN3 face the cytoplasm. We have identified two 
lysosomal targeting motifs that mediate the sorting of CLN3 in transfected 
nonneuronal and neuronal cells: an unconventional motif in the long C-terminal 
cytosolic tail consisting of a methionine and a glycine separated by nine amino 
acids [M(X)9G], and a more conventional dileucine motif, located in the large 
cytosolic loop domain and preceded by an acidic patch. Each motif on its own was 
sufficient to mediate lysosomal targeting, but optimal efficiency required both. 
Interestingly, in primary neurons, CLN3 was prominently seen both in lysosomes 
in the cell body and in endosomes, containing early endosomal antigen-1 along 
neuronal processes. Because there are few lysosomes in axons and peripheral 
parts of dendrites, the presence of CLN3 in endosomes of neurons may be 
functionally important. Endosomal association of the protein was independent of 
the two lysosomal targeting motifs.
