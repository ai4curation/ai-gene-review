To physically characterize the web of interactions connecting the Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae proteins suspected to be RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation 
factors, subunits of Spt4/Spt5 and Spt16/Pob3 (corresponding to human DSIF and 
FACT), Spt6, TFIIF (Tfg1, -2, and -3), TFIIS, Rtf1, and Elongator (Elp1, -2, -3, 
-4, -5, and -6) were affinity purified under conditions designed to minimize 
loss of associated polypeptides and then identified by mass spectrometry. 
Spt16/Pob3 was discovered to associate with three distinct complexes: histones; 
Chd1/casein kinase II (CKII); and Rtf1, Paf1, Ctr9, Cdc73, and a previously 
uncharacterized protein, Leo1. Rtf1 and Chd1 have previously been implicated in 
the control of elongation, and the sensitivity to 6-azauracil of strains lacking 
Paf1, Cdc73, or Leo1 suggested that these proteins are involved in elongation by 
RNAPII as well. Confirmation came from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 
assays demonstrating that all components of this complex, including Leo1, 
cross-linked to the promoter, coding region, and 3' end of the ADH1 gene. In 
contrast, the three subunits of TFIIF cross-linked only to the 
promoter-containing fragment of ADH1. Spt6 interacted with the uncharacterized, 
essential protein Iws1 (interacts with Spt6), and Spt5 interacted either with 
Spt4 or with a truncated form of Spt6. ChIP on Spt6 and the novel protein Iws1 
resulted in the cross-linking of both proteins to all three regions of the ADH1 
gene, suggesting that Iws1 is likely an Spt6-interacting elongation factor. 
Spt5, Spt6, and Iws1 are phosphorylated on consensus CKII sites in vivo, 
conceivably by the Chd1/CKII associated with Spt16/Pob3. All the elongation 
factors but Elongator copurified with RNAPII.
