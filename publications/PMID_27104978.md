Rbfox proteins control alternative splicing and posttranscriptional regulation 
in mammalian brain and are implicated in neurological disease. These proteins 
recognize the RNA sequence (U)GCAUG, but their structures and diverse roles 
imply a variety of protein-protein interactions. We find that nuclear Rbfox 
proteins are bound within a large assembly of splicing regulators (LASR), a 
multimeric complex containing the proteins hnRNP M, hnRNP H, hnRNP C, Matrin3, 
NF110/NFAR-2, NF45, and DDX5, all approximately equimolar to Rbfox. We show that 
splicing repression mediated by hnRNP M is stimulated by Rbfox. Virtually all 
the intron-bound Rbfox is associated with LASR, and hnRNP M motifs are enriched 
adjacent to Rbfox crosslinking sites in vivo. These findings demonstrate that 
Rbfox proteins bind RNA with a defined set of cofactors and affect a broader set 
of exons than previously recognized. The function of this multimeric LASR 
complex has implications for deciphering the regulatory codes controlling 
splicing networks.
