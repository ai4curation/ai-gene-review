Myosin II-driven mechanical forces control epithelial cell shape and 
morphogenesis. In particular, the circumferential actomyosin belt, which is 
located along apical cell-cell junctions, regulates many cellular processes. 
Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms regulating the belt are not 
fully understood. In this paper, we characterize Lulu2, a FERM (4.1 protein, 
ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain-containing molecule homologous to Drosophila 
melanogaster Yurt, as an important regulator. In epithelial cells, Lulu2 is 
localized along apical cell-cell boundaries, and Lulu2 depletion by ribonucleic 
acid interference results in disorganization of the circumferential actomyosin 
belt. In its regulation of the belt, Lulu2 interacts with and activates 
p114RhoGEF, a Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchanging factor (GEF), at apical 
cell-cell junctions. This interaction is negatively regulated via 
phosphorylation events in the FERM-adjacent domain of Lulu2 catalyzed by 
atypical protein kinase C. We further found that Patj, an apical cell polarity 
regulator, recruits p114RhoGEF to apical cell-cell boundaries via PDZ 
(PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domain-mediated interaction. These findings therefore reveal a 
novel molecular system regulating the circumferential actomyosin belt in 
epithelial cells.
