Cardiomyocytes of the failing heart undergo profound phenotypic and structural 
changes that are accompanied by variations in the genetic program and profile of 
calcium homeostatic proteins. The underlying mechanisms for these changes remain 
unclear. Because the mammalian counterpart of the fish calcium-regulating 
hormone stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) is expressed in the heart, we reasoned that STC1 
might play a role in the adaptive-maladaptive processes that lead to the heart 
failure phenotype. We examined the expression and localization of STC1 in 
cardiac tissue of patients with advanced heart failure before and after 
mechanical unloading using a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), and we 
compared the results with those of normal heart tissue. STC1 protein is markedly 
upregulated in cardiomyocytes and arterial walls of failing hearts pre-LVAD and 
is strikingly reduced after LVAD treatment. STC1 is diffusely expressed in 
cardiomyocytes, although nuclear predominance is apparent. Addition of 
recombinant STC1 to the medium of cultured rat cardiomyocytes slows their 
endogenous beating rate and diminishes the rise in intracellular calcium with 
each contraction. Furthermore, using whole cell patch-clamp studies in cultured 
rat cardiomyocytes, we find that addition of STC1 to the bath causes reversible 
inhibition of transmembrane calcium currents through L-channels. Our data 
suggest differential regulation of myocardial STC1 protein expression in heart 
failure. In addition, STC1 may regulate calcium currents in cardiomyocytes and 
may contribute to the alterations in calcium homeostasis of the failing heart.
