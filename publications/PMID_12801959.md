BACKGROUND: The exocrine pancreas secretes large volumes of isotonic fluid, most 
of which originates from the ductal system. The role of aquaporin (AQP) water 
channels in this process is unknown.
METHODS: Expression and localisation of known AQP isoforms was examined in 
normal human pancreas, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic cell lines of 
ductal origin (Capan-1, Capan-2, and HPAF) using reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Messenger RNAs for AQP1, -3, -4, -5, and -8 were detected in normal 
pancreas and in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The cell lines expressed AQP3, -4, 
and -5 but lacked AQP1 and AQP8. Immunohistochemistry of normal pancreas 
revealed that AQP1 is strongly expressed in centroacinar cells and in both the 
apical and basolateral domains of intercalated and intralobular duct epithelia. 
AQP1 expression declined with distance along the small interlobular ducts and 
was not detectable in larger interlobular ducts. AQP3 and AQP4 were not 
detectable by immunohistochemistry. AQP5 was observed at the apical membrane of 
intercalated duct cells and also in duct associated mucoid glands. AQP8 was 
confined to the apical pole of acinar cells. Both AQP1 and AQP5 were colocalised 
with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) at the apical 
membrane of intercalated duct cells.
CONCLUSIONS: AQP1 and AQP5 are strongly expressed in the intercalated ducts of 
the human pancreas. Their distribution correlates closely with that of CFTR, a 
marker of ductal electrolyte secretion. This suggests that fluid secretion is 
concentrated in the terminal branches of the ductal tree and that both AQP1 and 
AQP5 may play a significant role.

Abstract

Background: The exocrine pancreas secretes large volumes of isotonic fluid, most of which originates from the ductal system. The role of aquaporin (AQP) water channels in this process is unknown.

Methods: Expression and localisation of known AQP isoforms was examined in normal human pancreas, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic cell lines of ductal origin (Capan-1, Capan-2, and HPAF) using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.

Results: Messenger RNAs for AQP1, -3, -4, -5, and -8 were detected in normal pancreas and in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The cell lines expressed AQP3, -4, and -5 but lacked AQP1 and AQP8. Immunohistochemistry of normal pancreas revealed that AQP1 is strongly expressed in centroacinar cells and in both the apical and basolateral domains of intercalated and intralobular duct epithelia. AQP1 expression declined with distance along the small interlobular ducts and was not detectable in larger interlobular ducts. AQP3 and AQP4 were not detectable by immunohistochemistry. AQP5 was observed at the apical membrane of intercalated duct cells and also in duct associated mucoid glands. AQP8 was confined to the apical pole of acinar cells. Both AQP1 and AQP5 were colocalised with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) at the apical membrane of intercalated duct cells.

Conclusions: AQP1 and AQP5 are strongly expressed in the intercalated ducts of the human pancreas. Their distribution correlates closely with that of CFTR, a marker of ductal electrolyte secretion. This suggests that fluid secretion is concentrated in the terminal branches of the ductal tree and that both AQP1 and AQP5 may play a significant role.

DISCUSSION

Our observations on the distribution of AQP1, -5, -8, and CFTR in the human exocrine pancreas are summarised in table 2 ▶ . The fact that AQP1 is expressed in both the apical and basolateral membrane domains of intercalated duct cells, and also in centroacinar cells, suggests that these are major sites of transepithelial water flow. However, we found no evidence for the presence of AQP1 in acinar cells, as previously reported by Hasegawa and colleagues. 16 AQP5 immunolabelling was observed in the apical plasma membrane of intercalated duct cells and colocalised with CFTR and AQP1, strongly indicating that AQP5 also participates in pancreatic fluid production.

When stimulated with secretin, the exocrine pancreas secretes large volumes of isotonic HCO 3 − rich fluid containing relatively little enzyme activity. 1 As early as 1952, Hollander and Birnbaum proposed that this fluid originates from “flat centro-acinar and terminal-duct cells” rather than from acinar cells. 26 Subsequent studies have supported the ductal origin of the HCO 3 − rich fluid—notably the observation that secretin evoked secretion persists in rats with severe acinar cell atrophy 27 and that fluid and HCO 3 − secretion can be evoked in short segments of interlobular duct isolated from rat and guinea pig pancreas. 28, 29

The aquaporins normally associated with fluid secretion in exocrine glands are AQP5 and AQP8 at the apical membrane 10, 12, 23, 24, 30 and AQP3 and AQP4 at the basolateral membrane. 10, 24 Most of these glands also express AQP1 but this is generally confined to the endothelia of blood vessels. 31 It is therefore perhaps surprising to find AQP1 expressed apically and basolaterally in the ductal epithelial cells of the pancreas. On the other hand, its distribution in the pancreas is quite similar to that in the ductal system of the liver. Cholangiocytes, the epithelial cells that line the bile ductules, share many common features with pancreatic duct cells 32 and they too express AQP1 at both the apical and basolateral membranes 31, 33 and at diffuse intracellular sites. 34, 35 Interestingly, Marinelli et al have suggested that AQP1 is subject to translocation from intracellular membranes to the apical plasma membrane in response to secretin. 34, 35 The cytoplasmic labelling that we have observed in intercalated duct cells might indicate a similar regulated translocation of AQP1 in the pancreas.

The fact that both centroacinar cells and intercalated duct cells show labelling for AQP1 supports the widely held view that centroacinar cells have a phenotype that is similar to that of intercalated duct cells. 36– 39 Indeed, centroacinar cells can probably be regarded as terminal intercalated duct cells which invaginate into the acinar lumen. In addition, we have shown that they may penetrate deeply, sometimes as far as the basement membrane, between adjacent acinar cells. This raises the interesting question of whether centroacinar cells have functionally distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains. 40

Further down the ductal system, AQP1 expression appears to decline (table 2 ▶ ). This suggests that while intercalated and intralobular ducts are likely to be major sites of transepithelial water flow, interlobular and main ducts act principally as conduits for conveying the secreted fluid to the duodenum. Comparing localisation of AQP1 with that of CFTR, which plays an important role in HCO 3 − secretion, supports this hypothesis. In agreement with previous studies, 41– 43 we observed CFTR immunolabelling in the apical membrane of intercalated ducts but it was generally absent from interlobular ducts (table 2 ▶ ). Colocalisation of AQP1 and CFTR in the smaller ducts suggests that both electrolyte secretion and osmotic water flow mainly occur here. Within the acini we also detected some CFTR labelling which did not colocalise with AQP1. This indicates that CFTR is expressed at the apical membrane of acinar cells, as reported in rodents, 44, 45 although previously discounted in human pancreas. 42, 43

A remarkable feature of the human pancreas is coexpression of AQP1 and AQP5 at the apical membrane of intercalated duct cells. Although AQP5 immunolabelling appears relatively sparse compared with AQP1, this is partly because the lumen of intercalated ducts is extremely small, and partly because AQP5, unlike AQP1, is not expressed at the basolateral membrane, which has a much larger area. None the less, this result suggests that water transport across the very small apical surface of the intercalated ducts is facilitated by the presence of two aquaporin isoforms. Such redundancy might account for the lack of any obvious defect in pancreatic function in AQP1 null humans. 46

We also observed strong AQP5 labelling of mucoid glands in the human pancreas where AQP5 was clearly expressed at the apical and lateral surfaces of the cells (fig 6A ▶ ). Glands of this type have been compared with Brunner’s glands 39 and therefore it is interesting that AQP5 expression has recently been reported at the same cellular locations in Brunner’s glands of the duodenum in the rat. 47

In our previous immunohistochemical study of aquaporin expression in the rat pancreas, AQP1 was clearly present in blood vessels but we failed to detect it in the ductal system. 12 AQP1 has however recently been shown to be expressed, albeit at a low level, in interlobular ducts of the rat pancreas. 13, 48 We have now confirmed this, in both the rat and mouse, by using increased concentrations of AQP1 antibody (fig 3J ▶ ). There is however a striking difference in the distribution of AQP1 between the human and rodent pancreas. In the rat, AQP1 is absent from centroacinar cells, intercalated ducts, and intralobular ducts but present in the small and medium sized interlobular ducts. 48 In humans, AQP1 is strongly expressed in centroacinar cells, intercalated ducts, and intralobular ducts, and declines with distance along the interlobular ducts. This suggests that there is a difference in the distribution of transepithelial water flow along the pancreatic ductal systems of humans and rodents. It may of course simply reflect the different sizes of the glands and the presence of a more extensive intralobular ductal system in the larger lobules of the human pancreas.

As anticipated from previous observations in the rat, 12 immunolabelling of AQP8 was observed apically in acinar cells, in close proximity to zymogen granules (fig 6E ▶ ). AQP8 may therefore contribute to the production of a small amount of Cl − rich fluid that is thought to be associated with enzyme secretion. Although positive RT-PCR results were also obtained with primers for AQP3 and AQP4, neither of these isoforms was detected in normal human pancreas by immunohistochemistry. If they are present, they are presumably expressed at low levels and are therefore unlikely to participate significantly in pancreatic fluid secretion.

The two samples of pancreatic adenocarcinoma examined for AQP expression by RT-PCR resembled the normal pancreas closely (fig 1 ▶ ). However, only one of the two showed expression of AQP8 mRNA. As AQP8 is associated with the acinar cell phenotype, and as most tumours are of ductal origin, the absence of AQP8 from one of the samples is not surprising. It is possible that AQP8 mRNA detected in the other sample was derived from some normal acinar tissue associated with the tumour.

An interesting feature of the RT-PCR results from the pancreatic cell lines is the absence of mRNA for AQP1. Many of the well differentiated “ductal” adenocarcinomas of the pancreas are thought to derive from the epithelia of the larger interlobular ducts. 49 As these ducts do not express AQP1, it is perhaps not surprising that the cell lines lack this isoform. Strangely however all three cell lines examined appear to express mRNA for AQP5. In our hands, immunolabelling of AQP5 in normal human pancreas was largely confined to the intercalated ducts, which also expressed abundant AQP1. Furthermore, Capan-1 cells have been shown to express CFTR 50 which is also characteristic of intercalated and intralobular ducts rather than the large interlobular ducts. Taken together, these results suggest that the phenotypes of the cell lines do not exactly correspond to any particular segment of the pancreatic ductal system.

In summary, the principal finding of this study was that both AQP1 and AQP5 are strongly expressed in intercalated ducts of the human exocrine pancreas. Their expression correlates closely with the distribution of CFTR, a marker of ductal electrolyte secretion, and all three decline with distance downstream from the intercalated ducts. This suggests that ductal fluid secretion in the human pancreas is concentrated in the smallest terminal branches of the ductal tree and that both AQP1 and AQP5 may play a significant role in coupling the flow of water to active electrolyte secretion.
