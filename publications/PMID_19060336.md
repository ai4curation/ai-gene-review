The mammalian kidney is organized into a cortex where primary filtration occurs, 
and a medullary region composed of elongated tubular epithelia where urine is 
concentrated. We show that the cortico-medullary axis of kidney organization and 
function is regulated by Wnt7b signaling. The future collecting duct network 
specifically expresses Wnt7b. In the absence of Wnt7b, cortical epithelial 
development is normal but the medullary zone fails to form and urine fails to be 
concentrated normally. The analysis of cell division planes in the collecting 
duct epithelium of the emerging medullary zone indicates a bias along the 
longitudinal axis of the epithelium. By contrast, in Wnt7b mutants, cell 
division planes in this population are biased along the radial axis, suggesting 
that Wnt7b-mediated regulation of the cell cleavage plane contributes to the 
establishment of a cortico-medullary axis. The removal of beta-catenin from the 
underlying Wnt-responsive interstitium phenocopies the medullary deficiency of 
Wnt7b mutants, suggesting a paracrine role for Wnt7b action through the 
canonical Wnt pathway. Wnt7b signaling is also essential for the coordinated 
growth of the loop of Henle, a medullary extension of the nephron that elongates 
in parallel to the collecting duct epithelium. These findings demonstrate that 
Wnt7b is a key regulator of the tissue architecture that establishes a 
functional physiologically active mammalian kidney.

INTRODUCTION

The functional renal circuitry comprises a long tubular epithelial network with distinct origins. The main body of the nephron derives from the metanephric mesenchyme, which epitheliarizes in response to Wnt inductive signals ( Merkel et al., 2007 ). The ureteric epithelium arises from branching growth of the ureteric bud, which establishes the collecting duct network. The collecting duct system and nephrons of the mammalian kidney are organized along a renal cortico-medullary axis, such that different segments of nephrons and collecting ducts are spatially restricted within distinct cortical or medullary domains. The renal corpuscles and the convoluted tubules (proximal and distal) of the nephrons reside in the cortex ( Little et al., 2007 ). The loop of Henle, which connects proximal and distal tubules of the nephron, extends into the medullary zone of the kidney, adjacent to the elongated tubular network of the collecting duct system ( Little et al., 2007 ). The collecting duct epithelium also contains distinct cell types in cortical and medullary domains ( Schuster, 1993 ). The cortico-medullary organization of the kidney is crucial for renal function; for example, the concentration of urine within the medullary compartment. However, the mechanisms that regulate cortico-medullary axis formation are unclear.

Our previous studies documented several Wnt family members that are expressed within subdomains of the developing mammalian kidney, and several of these regulate distinct renal developmental events ( Carroll et al., 2005 ; Kispert et al., 1998 ; Kispert et al., 1996 ; Majumdar et al., 2003 ; Stark et al., 1994 ). Wnt7b encodes a Wnt ligand whose expression is restricted to the non-branching ureteric trunk component of the collecting duct system. Several studies have documented the actions of Wnt7b in multiple aspects of mammalian development, but its role in kidney development has not been addressed. Wnt7b signaling is crucial for placental, lung, eye, dendrite and bone formation ( Lobov et al., 2005 ; Parr et al., 2001 ; Rajagopal et al., 2008 ; Rosso et al., 2005 ; Shu et al., 2002 ; Tu et al., 2007 ). In different tissues, Wnt7b functions via different branches of the Wnt signaling pathway, including the canonical Lef/β-catenin pathway ( Lobov et al., 2005 ; Wang et al., 2005 ), the non-canonical planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway ( Rosso et al., 2005 ), and the newly described G protein-linked PKC delta pathway ( Tu et al., 2007 ). We demonstrate here that Wnt7b is essential for the establishment of the cortico-medullary axis of the mammalian kidney through the regulation of cell cleavage planes within the collecting duct epithelium. Mechanistic analyses suggest that Wnt7b acts indirectly by activating a canonical Wnt signaling pathway in an interstitial mesenchyme cell intermediate that coordinates the elongation of epithelial tubular networks forming the medullary zone.

DISCUSSION

Our work provides the first evidence that signaling by the ureteric epithelium establishes the cortico-medullary axis of the mammalian kidney. We identify Wnt7b as a key paracrine signaling factor in this process. Wnt7b is expressed exclusively in the non-branching collecting duct epithelium. Removal of Wnt7b activity leads to a failure of medullary development while other aspects of kidney development, notably ureteric branching and nephrogenesis, are unaffected. Canonical Wnt signaling targets are expressed in the subjacent interstitial mesenchyme, suggesting a paracrine signaling axis. Consistent with this view, expression of these targets is Wnt7b dependent. Additional support for canonical Wnt signaling in this interstitial population comes from the genetic removal of β-catenin in the renal interstitium. The resulting phenotype, an absence of the medullary area, closely resembles that caused by the loss of Wnt7b activity.

How then does Wnt7b action regulate this key morphogenetic process? The cellular and molecular basis of renal cortico-medullary axis formation is poorly understood. One early event that accompanies renal medulla formation is a significant longitudinal elongation of the renal medullary collecting ducts ( Cebrian et al., 2004 ). One model implicates pelvic contractile forces in this process. In this, the smooth muscle-regulated peristaltic contractions and downward pulling forces from the renal pelvis may influence the longitudinal growth of the renal medulla. In this scenario, Wnt7b would act in some way to promote pelvic contraction, and in the absence of these contractions the pelvic region enlarges, which results in the failure of renal medulla formation. Several observations argue against this model. First, no pelvic enlargement was observed in Wnt7b mutants prior to the defects in renal medulla formation at E15.5. An enlarged renal pelvis was evident at later stages; however, whereas the failure of medullary development was fully penetrant, only 30% of Wnt7b mutants exhibited an expanded pelvic region. Furthermore, the removal of calcineurin (Ppp3r1 - Mouse Genome Informatics) from the pelvic and ureteral mesenchyme, or Angiotensin type 1 receptor (Agtr1a, Agtr1b - Mouse Genome Informatics) disrupts effective peristalsis, but a renal medulla forms and is normal at birth ( Chang et al., 2004 ; Miyazaki et al., 1998 ). Both mutants display defective smooth muscle. Smooth muscle formation initiates at E15.5 in the kidney and ureter ( Yu et al., 2002 ), and peristaltic contractions of the ureter and renal pelvis at a later stage. That the smooth muscle-based activity does not initiate medullary development is evident from sonic hedgehog mutants, where no smooth muscle forms at E15.5 but renal medullary development initiates normally ( Yu et al., 2002 ).

Our study indicates that the emergence of the medullary region correlates with an elongation of the ureteric epithelium caused by a non-random plane of cell division. In this, new cells are added predominantly to a longitudinal axis of growth, as would be expected if the epithelium extends in a cortico-medullary direction. Strikingly, the failure of medulla formation in Wnt7b mutants correlates with a re-orientation of the cleavage plane, such that cells divide predominantly along the radial axis of the collecting duct. This shift in the orientation of cell division is expected to increase the circumferential growth and decrease longitudinal growth. Consistent with this view, a dilation of collecting duct epithelium was the only cellular defect we found associated with the onset of the failure of renal medulla formation in Wnt7b mutants (E15.5), although apoptosis was elevated at a later stage (E17.5). This suggests that oriented cell division is one crucial parameter initiating reorganization of the collecting duct epithelium to elongate the tubular network and establish the renal medulla. Cell death may play a later contributory role in the failure of renal medulla formation in Wnt7b mutants, but by this stage it is less clear whether increased apoptosis is a direct consequence of a failure of a Wnt7b -dependent regulatory function or a secondary consequence of phenotype-correlated defects; for example, a potential increase in intrapelvic pressure due to a higher volume of urine flow.

Oriented cell division has recently been demonstrated during postnatal renal collecting duct elongation ( Fischer et al., 2006 ). In that process, cells also divide predominantly along the longitudinal axis of the duct. Thus, common mechanisms are employed throughout the extended period of kidney growth and development, although the control of orientated cell division is tighter postnatally. In polycystic kidneys, this longitudinal cell division is disrupted, such that cells divide randomly. A causal link is suggested of orientated cell division with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) etiology ( Fischer et al., 2006 ; Saburi et al., 2008 ). In Wnt7b mutants, orientated cell division is also disrupted; however, unlike in PKD, the orientation of cell division appears to be such that cells tend to re-orientate to the plane opposite to that of wild-type cells. This difference may reflect additional regulatory inputs operating at the early stages; for example, a radial cleavage-promoting cue whose activity is masked by a dominant Wnt7b regulatory input. Alternatively, the PKD phenotype may result from a complete failure to sense any position-orientating cues, randomizing the cleavage planes within the collecting duct epithelium. Clearly, other tissues have specific pathways controlling the polarity of epithelial divisions, although these appear to be distinct from those reported here. For example, the removal of α-catenin or integrin β1 activity in skin leads to random cell division, whereas p63 mutants selectively disrupt asymmetric cell divisions ( Lechler and Fuchs, 2005 ).

The primary cilium is a central structure in the etiology of PKD. Mutants that lack a primary cilium or primary cilium-associated proteins that mediate its signaling activity exhibit PKD ( Lina and Satlinb, 2004 ; Siroky and Guay-Woodford, 2006 ; Yoder, 2007 ). Interestingly, unlike in polycystic kidneys, the primary cilium appears structurally normal in Wnt7b mutant kidneys, and is thus unlikely to play a similar role in the action of Wnt7b . Thus, differences in the structure or function of the primary cilium might be associated with the distinct defects in the orientation of cell division between PKD and Wnt7b mutants.

Tissue planar cell polarity (PCP) has been linked to the regulation of orientated cell division in the kidney and other tissue contexts ( Baena-Lopez et al., 2005 ; Gong et al., 2004 ; Saburi et al., 2008 ). Thus, a Wnt/PCP pathway, where the relevant ligands might be regulated by Wnt7b , may be involved in the regulation of oriented cell division in renal collecting duct elongation. Although we cannot rule out an autocrine role for Wnt7b in the medullary collecting duct epithelium, our data indicate that the interstitial mesenchyme is a primary target of Wnt7b signaling, and removing the ability of these cells to respond to a canonical Wnt input replicates the Wnt7b mutant medullary phenotype. These interstitial cells lie in close proximity to the Wnt7b -secreting ureteric epithelium and express at least three Wnt ligands, Wnt5a, Wnt4 and Wnt11 . The expression of each of these is either absent or downregulated in a Wnt7b/β-catenin canonical Wnt signaling-dependent manner (see Fig. S7 in the supplementary material ). Two of these Wnt ligands, Wnt5a and Wnt11 , are predominantly associated with non-canonical planar cell polarity signaling, whereas Wnt4 may act as both a canonical or a non-canonical ligand in a context-dependent manner. Thus, these Wnts are well placed to signal directly to the collecting duct epithelium. The medullary region develops in single mutants of Wnt5a and Wnt11 . In Wnt4 mutants, any medullary role would be obscured by the requirement for Wnt4 in renal vesicle induction: loss of Wnt4 leads to an early arrest in kidney development. Thus, compound mutants and novel genetic strategies will need to be generated to determine whether Wnt7b initiates a reciprocal Wnt/PCP signaling pathway from subjacent mesenchyme to stimulate longitudinal cell division in the overlying collecting duct epithelium. Furthermore, alternative models such as a non-PCP pathway of regulation or a more complex interplay between indirect mesenchymal and direct epithelial Wnt7b signaling cannot be ruled out. Genetic, cellular and biochemical strategies will be required to unravel this novel, critical regulatory interaction in organ biogenesis.

Pod1, p57Kip2 and integrin α3 ( Itga3 ) are three factors that have previously been shown to be involved in renal medulla morphogenesis. Pod1 knockout kidneys have no renal medulla, whereas p57Kip2 and Itga3 knockout kidneys have a reduced renal medulla ( Kreidberg et al., 1996 ; Quaggin et al., 1999 ; Zhang et al., 1997 ). Of these, only p57Kip2 expression is lost in Wnt7b and β-catenin interstitium mutants ( Fig. 7 ; see also Fig. S7 in the supplementary material ), suggesting that p57Kip2 may be a specific downstream target of Wnt7b signaling, whereas Pod1 and Itga3 may act in a parallel pathway or upstream of Wnt7b . Although p57Kip2 is mainly known as a Cdk inhibitor, the kidney defects of p57Kip2 null mice do not appear to directly associate with changes in cell proliferation ( Zhang et al., 1997 ). Furthermore, several reports indicate Cdk inhibitor-independent activities for p57Kip2 ( Chang et al., 2003 ; Joseph et al., 2003 ; Yokoo et al., 2003 ). Importantly, a small renal medulla forms in p57Kip2 mutants. This phenotype is less severe than that of Wnt7b mutants, indicating that there are likely to be additional p57Kip2-independent targets of Wnt7b signaling.

Interestingly, the organizing function of Wnt7b also extends beyond the collecting duct epithelium to the nephron itself. Elongated growth of the loop of Henle is Wnt7b dependent; in the absence of Wnt7b action, little proliferative expansion of the loop of Henle anlage is observed. These data provide evidence for an ongoing role for ureteric epithelial signaling in nephron development downstream of Wnt9b -mediated induction of the nephron precursor ( Carroll et al., 2005 ). In the loop of Henle anlagen, cell proliferation appears to be the crucial cellular response to Wnt7b functions. The different responses of loop of Henle and prospective medullary collecting duct epithelium to Wnt7b activities may result from tissue context-specific effects of a common signal downstream of Wnt7b , or from distinct downstream signals acting on the two epithelial tissues.

In summary, our data point to an integrated control of distinct epithelial networks through diverse cellular processes to generate a functional medullary compartment. In this, Wnt7b plays a pivotal role. Its activity is essential for orientating cell cleavage in the collecting duct epithelium and for normal mitogenic activity in the loop of Henle. Furthermore, the data indicate that some, and possibly all, of these actions may be mediated through a hitherto neglected population of cells in our understanding of kidney development, the interstitial mesenchyme, highlighting the importance of this population in governing the spatiotemporal development of a vital component of functional kidney architecture, the renal medulla. Our findings provide a starting point to understanding how axial polarity in the mammalian kidney contributes to the establishment of a crucial axis of renal structure and function.
