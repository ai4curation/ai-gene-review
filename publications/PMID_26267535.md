Biomarkers for predicting prognosis are critical to treating colorectal cancer 
(CRC) patients. We found that CSN6, a subunit of COP9 signalosome, is 
overexpressed in CRC samples and that CSN6 overexpression is correlated with 
poor patient survival. Mechanistic studies revealed that CSN6 is deregulated by 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, in which ERK2 binds directly 
to CSN6 Leu163/Val165 and phosphorylates CSN6 at Ser148. Furthermore, CSN6 
regulated β-Trcp and stabilized β-catenin expression by blocking the 
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thereby promoting CRC development. High CSN6 
expression was positively correlated with ERK2 activation and β-catenin 
overexpression in CRC samples, and inhibiting CSN6 stability with cetuximab 
reduced colon cancer growth. Taken together, our study's findings indicate that 
the deregulation of β-catenin by ERK2-activated CSN6 is important for CRC 
development.

INTRODUCTION

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality. The primary treatment for CRC patients is surgery, and conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or targeted therapies are routinely used to treat patients who are at high risk of developing recurrent or metastatic disease ( Laurent-Puig et al., 2009 ). The molecular alterations in CRC have been studied extensively. Specific molecular marker analyses (e.g., microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, PIK3CA, RAS and BRAF mutations) are becoming routine clinical practice in determining colorectal cancer treatment ( Cancer Genome Atlas, 2012 ; Karapetis et al., 2008 ; Ogino et al., 2014 ; Walther et al., 2009 ). For example, RAS and BRAF mutations have impact on the clinical management of colorectal cancer ( Amado et al., 2008 ; Bardelli and Siena, 2010 ; Douillard et al., 2013 ; Pietrantonio et al., 2015 ). However, a more detailed picture of the pathways deregulated in CRC has yet to emerge. Defining these molecular alterations can help guide treatment and improve clinical care ( Siena et al., 2009 ).

The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a multiprotein complex involved in protein degradation, transcriptional activation ( Seeger et al., 1998 ; Wei and Deng, 1999 ), signal transduction ( Chen et al., 2012 ; Xue et al., 2012 ; Zhang et al., 2008 ), and tumorigenesis ( Chen et al., 2014 ; Richardson and Zundel, 2005 ; Zhao et al., 2014 ; Zhao et al., 2013 ; Zhao et al., 2011 ). However, the detailed biological functions of the CSN’s subunits have not been well characterized. Several studies have indicated that mammalian CSN subunits are involved in developmental processes; examples include targeted disruptions of mammalian Csn2, Csn3, Csn5 , and Csn8 that resulted in defective embryo development ( Lykke-Andersen et al., 2003 ; Menon et al., 2007 ; Tomoda et al., 2004 ; Yan et al., 2003 ). The role of CSN subunits in cancer biology is emerging ( Lee et al., 2011 ). Our own work has shed some light on the function of the CSN6 subunit specifically. In a previous study, we performed targeted disruption of the Csn6 gene in mice and found that Csn 6-/- mice developed until 7.5 days post-coitus but not beyond this time ( Zhao et al., 2011 ). In that same study, Csn6 +/- mouse tumor experiments showed that Csn6 haplo-insufficiency helps impede the development of cancer ( Zhao et al., 2011 ), suggesting that CSN6 signaling regulation is critical for tumor development. However, the mechanism and biological consequence of CSN6 overexpression in cancer remains unclear. In this study, we characterized the mechanism of CSN6 overexpression during the colorectal cancer tumorigenesis.

DISCUSSION

In the present study, we found that CSN6 is a prognosis-associated marker that is deregulated in colon cancer. CSN6 expression is elevated in colon cancer and leads to worse RFS, suggesting that abnormal CSN6 expression causes treatment resistance. In two cohorts of colon cancer patients, high levels of CSN6 expression resulted in poor overall survival, indicating that CSN6 has a critical role in colon cancer development. CSN6 is a critical ubiquitination regulator involved in cell cycle regulation ( Choi et al., 2011 ; Xue et al., 2012 ) and p53 signaling pathway ( Zhao et al., 2011 ), but its role in colon cancer remains unclear. Noticeably, CSN6 is the major CSN subunit highly deregulated in colon cancer, while CSN5, another subunit frequently deregulated in cancer ( Tomoda et al., 1999 ; Zhao et al., 2014 ), is not particularly overexpressed in colon cancer. In particular, we found that CSN6 has unprecedented biological activity in downregulating β-Trcp, thereby stabilizing β-catenin; this confirms CSN6’s role in promoting colon cancer development by influencing a major molecular defect in the disease.

ERK kinases bind to their substrates through a docking groove, and these substrates usually contain a D-site that interacts with ERK. In the present study, replacing some conserved residues on the D- site compromised CSN6’s capacity to interact with ERK, suggesting that these residues are involved in ERK-CSN6 protein-protein interaction. This interaction leads to a phosphorylation event. Our data show that S148 of CSN6 has an ERK phosphorylation site. This site is located in the end portion of CSN6’s MPN ( M pr1p and P ad1p N -terminal) domain, which is found in the N-terminus of yeast Mpr1 and Pad1 proteins ( Penney et al., 1998 ; Rinaldi et al., 1995 ; Wei and Deng, 1999 ). Although the biological function of the MPN domain remains not well determined, the domain consists of polar residues that resemble the active site residues of metalloproteases ( Maytal-Kivity et al., 2002 ) and is involved in a proteasome-associated deneddylation activity ( Lyapina et al., 2001 ). Whether this phosphorylation event participates in any activity of the MPN domain is unknown; regardless, this phosphorylation is critical to maintaining the stability of CSN6. We previously showed that S60 of CSN6 has an Akt phosphorylation site ( Xue et al., 2012 ) and that Akt increases the steady-state expression of CSN6 ( Xue et al., 2012 ). Together, these results demonstrated that CSN6 is regulated by two major signaling pathways (i.e., the ERK and Akt signaling pathways).

Our studies also showed that CSN6 can function in connection with β-Trcp in a circuit, resulting in the negative regulation of β-catenin protein. We found that CSN6 also associates with β-Trcp and facilitates its degradation. The steady-state protein level of the F-box protein β-Trcp is important in determining the ubiquitin ligase activity of the whole SCF β-Trcp . Cullin-RING ligase (CRL) substrate adaptors, such as F-box proteins, tend to have autocatalytic degradation in vivo ( Wee et al., 2005 ; Zhou et al., 2003 ). Thus, keeping the F-box proteins stable has a positive impact on the CRL, thereby facilitating the degradation of CRL targets. Strikingly, our studies showed that CSN6 expression decreases the steady-state expression of β-Trcp. Because Cullin neddylation, a process controlled by CSN, decreases the steady-state expression levels of F-box proteins ( Wee et al., 2005 ), we rationalized that CSN6 may be involved in Cullin neddylation, thereby increasing the autocatalytic degradation of β-Trcp. Indeed, we recently showed that CSN6 is competing with CSN5 for Cullin binding through its MPN domain ( Chen et al., 2014 ). Structurally, CSN6 and CSN5 form a heterodimer through MPN domain, and the dimer is topologically knotted to engage in Cullin deneddylation ( Lingaraju et al., 2014 ). Reducing CSN6 expression diminishes its competition with CSN5 in terms of Cullin binding, thereby allowing CSN5 to mediate the deneddylation of Cullin efficiently as observed in Csn6 +/– extracts ( Chen et al., 2014 ). On the other hand, it is conceivable that in CSN6-overexpressing cancers abundant CSN6 binds more amounts of Cullin and thus reduces the accessibility of Cullin to CSN5 for deneddylation, thereby preserving Cullin neddylation. More Cullin neddylation increases the autocatalytic degradation of F-box protein such as Fbxw7 ( Chen et al., 2014 ). Here, we provided another example of CSN6-preserved Cullin neddylation in affecting another F-box protein–– β-Trcp and showed how CSN6 can destabilize β-Trcp and subsequently increase the stability of β-catenin.

In our study, cetuximab inhibited tumor growth in xenograft colon cancer mice and prolonged their survival. Tumor sample analysis indicated that cetuximab ablated the CSN6 and β-catenin expression levels as well as ERK activation. Congruently, CSN6 knockdown xenograft tumors had elevated β-Trcp and diminished β-catenin expression and a slower growth rate. Thus, these studies recapitulated the relationships among EGF, ERK, CSN6, and β-catenin in vivo . Activating mutations in KRAS, BRAF , and/or PIK3CA are well-known carcinogenic mechanisms and may predict response to treatment of CRC ( Douillard et al., 2013 ; Mao et al., 2012 ; Nishihara et al., 2013 ; Siena et al., 2009 ). It is known that human colon cancers bearing mutated KRAS do not respond to cetuximab well, whereas those bearing WT KRAS do respond to cetuximab ( Karapetis et al., 2008 ). Our previous data show that AKT signaling pathway stabilizes CSN6 ( Xue et al., 2012 ), and here we show that RAS-MAPK pathway has a positive impact on CSN6 stability. Because KRAS is an upstream regulator of these two pathways, KRAS mutations will continue to activate both RAS-MAPK and AKT pathways to stabilize CSN6, which in turn activates β-catenin activity to cause pathogenesis in colon cancer. The worse prognosis with EGFR antibody therapy (cetuximab) in colon cancer cells/tumors harboring KRAS mutation can, at least in part, be due to CSN6-β-catenin stabilization. CSN6 stabilization and its downstream impact on β-catenin activation may lead to cetuximab resistance. Thus CSN6’s expression level might be used as a predictor for drug selection.

We also found that CSN6 overexpression is quite common in colorectal cancer. Our cohort studies in Figure 1 indicate that CSN6 is overexpressed in about 35-80 % of colorectal cancers depending from mRNA expression or tissue microarray studies. The deregulation rate is comparable to other known markers. For example, Douillard et al. show that RAS mutations (any KRAS or NRAS mutations in exon 2, 3, or 4) in CRC could be about 52 % ( Douillard et al., 2013 ), whereas BRAF V660E mutation is found in 20% of colonic tumors ( Farina-Sarasqueta et al., 2010 ; Pietrantonio et al., 2015 ). CSN6 overexpression was positively correlated with β-catenin protein expression and ERK activation in human colon cancer samples. These findings demonstrate that CSN6 overexpression can at least partially account for β-catenin overexpression in colon cancer and provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying EGFR/ERK pathway deregulation in colon cancer. That CSN6 acts as a positive regulator of β-catenin raises the possibility that inhibiting the CSN6 signaling axis is an efficient therapeutic approach in β-catenin-deregulated colon cancer.
