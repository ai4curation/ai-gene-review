Characterization of the extracellular protein interactome has lagged far behind 
that of intracellular proteins, where mass spectrometry and yeast two-hybrid 
technologies have excelled. Improved methods for identifying receptor-ligand and 
extracellular matrix protein interactions will greatly accelerate biological 
discovery in cell signaling and cellular communication. These technologies must 
be able to identify low-affinity binding events that are often observed between 
membrane-bound coreceptor molecules during cell-cell or cell-extracellular 
matrix contact. Here we demonstrate that functional protein microarrays are 
particularly well-suited for high-throughput screening of extracellular protein 
interactions. To evaluate the performance of the platform, we screened a set of 
89 immunoglobulin (Ig)-type receptors against a highly diverse extracellular 
protein microarray with 686 genes represented. To enhance detection of 
low-affinity interactions, we developed a rapid method to assemble bait Fc 
fusion proteins into multivalent complexes using protein A microbeads. Based on 
these screens, we developed a statistical methodology for hit calling and 
identification of nonspecific interactions on protein microarrays. We found that 
the Ig receptor interactions identified using our methodology are highly 
specific and display minimal off-target binding, resulting in a 70% 
true-positive to false-positive hit ratio. We anticipate that these methods will 
be useful for a wide variety of functional protein microarray users.
