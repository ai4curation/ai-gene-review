Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
caused by an expanding polyglutamine repeat in the IT15 or huntingtin gene. 
Although this gene is widely expressed and is required for normal development, 
the pathology of HD is restricted to the brain, for reasons that remain poorly 
understood. The huntingtin gene product is expressed at similar levels in 
patients and controls, and the genetics of the disorder suggest that the 
expansion of the polyglutamine repeat induces a toxic gain of function, perhaps 
through interactions with other cellular proteins. Here we report the 
identification of a protein (huntingtin-associated protein (HAP)-1) that binds 
to huntingtin. This binding is enhanced by an expanded polyglutamine repeat, the 
length of which is also known to correlate with the age of disease onset. The 
HAP-1 protein is enriched in the brain, suggesting a possible basis for the 
selective brain pathology of HD.
