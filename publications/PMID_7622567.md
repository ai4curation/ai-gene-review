NAP1 is a 60-kD protein that interacts specifically with mitotic cyclins in 
budding yeast and frogs. We have examined the ability of the yeast mitotic 
cyclin Clb2 to function in cells that lack NAP1. Our results demonstrate that 
Clb2 is unable to carry out its full range of functions without NAP1, even 
though Clb2/p34CDC28-associated kinase activity rises to normal levels. In the 
absence of NAP1, Clb2 is unable to efficiently induce mitotic events, and cells 
undergo a prolonged delay at the short spindle stage with normal levels of 
Clb2/p34CDC28 kinase activity. NAP1 is also required for the ability of Clb2 to 
induce the switch from polar to isotropic bud growth. As a result, polar bud 
growth continues during mitosis, giving rise to highly elongated cells. Our 
experiments also suggest that NAP1 is required for the ability of the 
Clb2/p34CDC28 kinase complex to amplify its own production, and that NAP1 plays 
a role in regulation of microtubule dynamics during mitosis. Together, these 
results demonstrate that NAP1 is required for the normal function of the 
activated Clb2/p34CDC28 kinase complex, and provide a step towards understanding 
how cyclin-dependent kinase complexes induce specific events during the cell 
cycle.
