Besides its role in translation and ribosome maturation, human ribosomal protein 
S3 (hS3) is implicated in DNA damage recognition as reflected by its affinity 
for abasic sites and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) residues in DNA in vitro. 
Here, we demonstrate that hS3 is capable of carrying out both roles by its ex 
vivo translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus as a consequence of 
genotoxic stress. The translocation of hS3 is dependent on ERK1/2-mediated 
phosphorylation of a threonine residue (T42) of hS3. Two different ectopically 
expressed site-directed mutants of T42 failed to respond to conditions of 
genotoxic stress, thus providing a link between DNA damage and ERK1/2 dependent 
phosphorylation of hS3. Lastly, hS3 was traced in exposed cells to its 
co-localization with 8-oxoG foci, raising the possibility that hS3 is a member 
of a cellular DNA damage response pathway that results in its interaction with 
sites of DNA damage.
