Arabidopsis COP9 is a component of a large protein complex that is essential for 
the light control of a developmental switch and whose conformation or size is 
modulated by light. The complex is acidic, binds heparin, and is localized 
within the nucleus. Biochemical purification of the complex to near homogeneity 
revealed that it contains 12 distinct subunits. One of the other subunits is 
COP11, mutations in which result in a phenotype identical to cop9 mutants. The 
COP9 complex may act to regulate the nuclear abundance of COP1, an established 
repressor of photomorphogenic development. During the biogenesis of the COP9 
complex, a certain degree of prior subunit association is a prerequisite for 
proper nuclear translocation. Since both COP9 and COP11 have closely related 
human counterparts, the COP9 complex probably represents a conserved 
developmental regulator in higher eukaryotes.
