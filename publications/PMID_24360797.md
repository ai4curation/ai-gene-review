In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), biomarkers for prediction of prognosis and 
response to immunotherapy such as interferon-α (IFN-α) would be very useful in 
the clinic. We found that expression of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), 
an IFN-stimulated gene, was significantly downregulated in human HCC tissues. 
Patients with low RIG-I expression had shorter survival and poorer response to 
IFN-α therapy, suggesting that RIG-I is a useful prognosis and IFN-α response 
predictor for HCC patients. Mechanistically, RIG-I enhances IFN-α response by 
amplifying IFN-α effector signaling via strengthening STAT1 activation. 
Furthermore, we found that RIG-I deficiency promotes HCC carcinogenesis and that 
hepatic RIG-I expression is lower in men than in women. RIG-I may therefore be a 
tumor suppressor in HCC and contribute to HCC gender disparity.
