The transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin mediates Wnt growth factor 
signaling. In the absence of a Wnt signal, casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen 
synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) phosphorylate cytosolic beta-catenin, thereby 
flagging it for recognition and destruction by the ubiquitin/proteosome 
machinery. Phosphorylation occurs in a multiprotein complex that includes the 
kinases, beta-catenin, axin, and the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) protein. 
The role of APC in this process is poorly understood. CK1epsilon and GSK-3beta 
phosphorylate APC, which increases its affinity for beta-catenin. Crystal 
structures of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated APC bound to beta-catenin 
reveal a phosphorylation-dependent binding motif generated by mutual priming of 
CK1 and GSK-3beta substrate sequences. Axin is shown to act as a scaffold for 
substrate phosphorylation by these kinases. Phosphorylated APC and axin bind to 
the same surface of, and compete directly for, beta-catenin. The structural and 
biochemical data suggest a novel model for how APC functions in beta-catenin 
degradation.
