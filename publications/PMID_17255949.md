Introduction

ERK1 and ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are cytoplasmic kinases that become activated in response to a wide array of stimuli, including those that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. ERK1/2 are key elements in the transduction of signals from the surface to the interior of the cell. They lie downstream of a signaling module that includes sequentially Raf family MAPKKKs and MEK 1 and 2 dual-specificity MAPKKs. This cascade is regulated at its origin by Ras GTPases. Once activated, ERK1/2 phosphorylate a broad spectrum of substrates distributed throughout different subcellular compartments ( Pearson et al , 2001 ). The balance among these site-specific components of ERK signals is the determinant for the biological outcomes resulting from ERK activation ( Robinson et al , 1998 ; Ajenjo et al , 2004 ).

Under resting conditions, unphosphorylated ERK1/2 are primarily located in the cytoplasm, largely as a consequence of their interaction with cytoplasmic anchors, including MEK1, certain protein phosphatases and the cytoskeleton ( Reszka et al , 1995 ; Fukuda et al , 1997b ; Blanco-Aparicio et al , 1999 ). Upon stimulation, ERK1/2 lose affinity for these partners and redistribute throughout the cell, including the nucleus. Phosphorylation may be sufficient to promote ERK1/2 transit to the nucleus, but their kinase activity is not necessary ( Lenormand et al , 1993 ). Several models explaining ERK1/2 nuclear import have been suggested: ERK1/2 enter the nucleus, in both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms, by a carrier- and energy-independent mechanism that involves direct interaction with the nuclear pore complex (NPC) ( Matsubayashi et al , 2001 ; Whitehurst et al , 2002 ). The phosphorylated proteins may also enter the nucleus, perhaps in a dimeric form, by active transport ( Khokhlatchev et al , 1998 ; Adachi et al , 1999 ; Ranganathan et al , 2006 ). Some proteins, like PEA15, prevent ERK1/2 translocation by interfering with their binding to the nuclear pore ( Formstecher et al , 2001 ; Whitehurst et al , 2004 ). ERK1/2 nucleocytoplasmic distribution is also dependent on its nuclear export. ERK1/2 nuclear efflux can be mediated by MEK, which has a nuclear export sequence (NES) that complexes with the nuclear export receptor CRM1 ( Fukuda et al , 1997a ). ERK1/2, once dephosphorylated in the nucleus, bind to MEK and are exported to the cytoplasm ( Adachi et al , 2000 ). ERK1/2 nucleocytoplasmic distribution can also be affected by the number and affinity of ERK1/2 binding partners in each compartment ( Pouyssegur and Lenormand, 2003 ; Burack and Shaw, 2005 ). ERK1/2 nuclear translocation and retention requires neosynthesis of nuclear anchoring proteins ( Lenormand et al , 1993 ). Topoisomerase II and kinetochores have been identified as nuclear anchors for ERK1/2 ( Shapiro et al , 1998 ), but the identity of the majority of these remains elusive.

Mxi2 is a splice isoform of p38α. It is identical to p38 from amino acids 1 to 280 and harbors a unique, 17-amino-acid C-terminus ( Zervos et al , 1995 ). We have recently reported that some Mxi2 biochemical properties make it unique among p38 proteins ( Sanz et al , 2000 ). As such, Mxi2 directly binds to ERK1/2 and in so doing it prolongs their activation. This interaction has profound effects on ERK1/2 nuclear but not cytoplasmic signaling ( Sanz-Moreno et al , 2003 ). Herein, we have studied the mechanism of Mxi2 action on ERK1/2 functions. We report that Mxi2 is a nuclear protein with the ability to alter ERK1/2 nucleocytoplasmic distribution by facilitating ERK1/2 nuclear entry. In the absence of additional stimulation, Mxi2 expression is sufficient to promote ERK1/2 nuclear translocation. Our results disclose for the first time a stimulus-independent nuclear shuttle for ERK1/2 capable of modifying ERK1/2 nucleocytoplasmic distribution.

Discussion

In this study, we explored the regulation of ERK1/2 by Mxi2. We have found that Mxi2, both ectopically expressed and endogenous, localizes predominantly to the nucleus. Mxi2 accumulation in the nucleus is not due to its inability to interact with putative cytoplasmic anchors, as Mxi2 is capable of interacting with MKK 3 and 6. We have observed that upon stimulation, Mxi2 is enriched further in the nucleus, unlike p38 that exits the nucleus once activated ( Ben-Levy et al , 1998 ). This difference may be due to Mxi2 being unable to interact with MAPKAP K2 (our unpublished results), which acts as a p38 nuclear exit shuttle ( Ben-Levy et al , 1998 ). Maybe the inability of Mxi2 to couple to this or similar nuclear export mechanisms could contribute to its persistent nuclear localization.

Our results demonstrate that Mxi2 expression evokes a dramatic redistribution of ERK1/2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This is highlighted when examining the endogenous proteins in MDCK cells, in which downregulation of Mxi2 by RNAi results in a marked drop in ERK1/2 nuclear localization. Furthermore, Mxi2 enhances the accumulation of total and phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the nucleus, even under starvation. Our findings suggest that Mxi2 binding to ERK1/2 hinders their interaction with deactivating phosphatases ( Sanz et al , 2000 ; Sanz-Moreno et al , 2003 ; unpublished results). Our results herein hint that Mxi2 could be inhibiting ERK1/2 nuclear but not cytoplasmic phosphatases, since, even though about 20% of Mxi2 is localized at the cytoplasm, this fraction seems unable to affect the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 therein. One possible explanation could be that Mxi2 affinity for ERK1/2 is higher than that of nuclear phosphatases, but lower than the affinity exhibited by cytoplasmic phosphatases. Thus, only a high concentration of Mxi2 could bring about changes in ERK1/2 cytoplasmic signals.

Searching for the mechanisms underlying in Mxi2 effects on ERK1/2 nucleocytoplasmic distribution, we have found that Mxi2 markedly potentiates ERK1/2 binding to nucleoporin 153. This requires a direct interaction between Mxi2 and ERK1/2, as Mxi2 mutants defective for binding to ERK1/2 are unable to enhance either their association with nucleoporins or their translocation into the nucleus. It seems possible that this effect of Mxi2 contributes to enhance the nuclear entry of ERK1/2. However, in vitro import assays suggest that this effect is not sufficient in the absence of nuclear entry of Mxi2 itself. As such, the possibility of Mxi2 also serving as some sort of nuclear anchor for ERK1/2 should be considered. Another implication is that the interaction of Mxi2 with ERK2 may cause conformational changes in ERK2 that affect its capacity to interact with other proteins. Changes in interactions with phosphatases, for example, may be one manifestation of this effect.

It has been proposed that ERK1/2 bind to nucleoporins at the FXF motifs ( Jacobs et al , 1999 ) present in many of these, through a hydrophobic region proximal to the activation lip ( Lee et al , 2004 ; Whitehurst et al , 2004 ). We show that Mxi2 itself can directly bind to nucleoporin 153. The ERK1/2 hydrophobic residues thought to mediate the NPC interaction are conserved in p38α/Mxi2. Thus, it is likely that Mxi2 binds to nucleoporins through this same region, although with a higher affinity than ERK1/2, ∼60 vs ∼200 nM ( Whitehurst et al , 2002 ). In agreement, we demonstrate that Mxi2 can displace ERK1/2 from binding to nucleoporins. In support of this notion, using the in vitro nuclear import assay, we have observed that excess Mxi2 can prevent ERK2 nuclear import. Even though p38α also possesses an FXF-binding region, it cannot promote ERKs nuclear translocation, probably owing to its low affinity towards ERK1/2, compared with Mxi2 ( Sanz-Moreno et al , 2003 ).

The relevance of the influence of Mxi2 on ERK1/2 binding to the NPC is also highlighted by its antagonism with PEA15, which prevents ERK1/2 nuclear entry by interfering with ERK1/2 binding to nucleoporins ( Whitehurst et al , 2004 ). Mxi2 can overcome this inhibition and promote ERK1/2 nuclear translocation even in the presence of PEA15. Mxi2 antagonistic effects on PEA15 can be explained by its ability to outcompete this protein for binding to ERK1/2, as expected from the reported in vitro binding affinities that Mxi2 and PEA15 display for ERK1/2: 20 nM ( Sanz-Moreno et al , 2003 ) and 200 nM ( Callaway et al , 2005 ), respectively. Along these lines, our results indicate that the association between Mxi2 and ERK2 is mediated through the Insert region, similar to PEA15 ( Whitehurst et al , 2004 ), thus demonstrating that Mxi2 and PEA15 share a common binding site on ERK1/2. Interestingly, it has been proposed that PEA15 C-terminal 121–127 amino acids, whereby it binds to ERK1/2, constitute a reverse D domain, with a consensus sequence: R/K-φ a -X 3/4 -φ b (where φ are Leu, Ile or Val) ( Callaway et al , 2005 ). Noticeably, the Mxi2 C-terminus, which mediates its interaction with ERK1/2 ( Sanz-Moreno et al , 2003 ), displays a very similar sequence: K-φ a -X 5 -φ b .

ERK1/2 lack a canonical NLS and have not been found associated with importins ( Adachi et al , 1999 ). Even though canonical ERK1/2 nuclear translocation can take place independently of NPC functionality and Ran ( Adachi et al , 1999 ), our results show that Mxi2-mediated ERK1/2 nuclear transport is dependent on NPC integrity and this GTPase, as it is inhibited by WGA and a Ran inhibitory mutant. The requirement for energy for Mxi2-mediated transport is further supported by our results showing that Mxi2 effects on ERK2 nuclear accumulation require cytosolic factors. Even though Mxi2 does not have an NLS either, at this point, it cannot be discarded that the Mxi2–ERK complex could somehow bind to other proteins that possess that motif, thereby facilitating further its entry to the nucleus.

An enhanced interaction with the NPC by the ERK–Mxi2 complex is likely to be the mechanism whereby Mxi2 promotes ERK1/2 nuclear accumulation. Another possibility worth considering is the blockade of ERK1/2 nuclear export. We have previously shown that Mxi2 sustains the levels of nuclear, phosphorylated ERK1/2 ( Sanz-Moreno et al , 2003 ). As a consequence, the formation of ERK export complexes would be delayed and ERK1/2 would be retained for longer periods in the nucleus. However, our results clearly demonstrate that Mxi2 can induce the nuclear accumulation of ERK1/2 irrespective of their phosphorylation state.

Herein, we demonstrate that Mxi2 can promote ERK1/2 massive translocation into the nucleus, under starvation conditions, in the absence of any additional stimulation. Moreover, we have found that Mxi2 is capable of inducing the nuclear translocation of unphosphorylatable ERK2 mutants as efficiently as that of wild-type ERK2. Our data clearly show that ERK1/2 can be transported into the nucleus in an unphosphorylated form. This notion is further supported by our results showing that Mxi2 can promote the nuclear entry of monomeric ERK2. Thus, even though ERK1/2 phosphorylation can be sufficient to trigger their nuclear import in transformed cells ( Lenormand et al , 1993 ), such an event does not appear not be an essential requirement and, under the right circumstances, unphosphorylated ERK1/2 can also be translocated into the nucleus. Our results point to Mxi2 as a unique protein in retaining unphosphorylated ERK1/2 in the nucleus.

Even though the biological rationale that underlies the stimulus-independent nucleocytoplasmic distribution of ERK1/2, as undertaken by Mxi2, is largely unknown, we demonstrate that altering such an event can have profound physiological implications, as evidenced by its effects on cellular proliferation and by the association of Mxi2 overexpression and ERK1/2 redistribution to renal tumors.

The currently accepted model for ERK1/2 distribution postulates that in the absence of stimuli, unphosphorylated ERK1/2 are retained at the cytoplasm through their interaction with MEK and other cytoplasmic anchors ( Fukuda et al , 1997b ; Blanco-Aparicio et al , 1999 ). It would be expected that in order to promote ERK1/2 nuclear entry without stimulation, Mxi2 should be able to withdraw ERK1/2 from their complexes with MEK. However, our results indicate otherwise. This would seem at odds with the weak affinity that MEK displays for ERK1/2 in vitro ( K d =10–15 μM) ( Bardwell et al , 2001 ) compared with Mxi2. One likely explanation for this discrepancy could be that in physiological contexts MEK–ERK affinity is much greater, probably as a consequence of the stabilizing effect of other proteins, such as scaffolds. Another possibility could be that the presence of MEK–ERK scaffolds could pose some degree of structural hindrance for the interaction of ERK with Mxi2. On the other hand, a recent model suggests that ERK1/2 nucleocytoplasmic distribution would be primarily controlled by changes in the affinity of ERK1/2 towards its nuclear and cytoplasmic anchors and hints for the existence of significant amounts of uncomplexed ERK1/2 in both compartments ( Burack and Shaw, 2005 ; Callaway et al , 2005 ). Under such premises, Mxi2 could bring about ERK1/2 nuclear translocation by the recruitment of the uncomplexed cytoplasmic fraction, without significantly affecting the fraction bound to MEK.

In summary, we propose a model for Mxi2-mediated ERK1/2 nuclear translocation, as depicted in Figure 9 : (a) In the absence of Mxi2 and under mitogenic stimulation, ERK1/2 translocate to the nucleus through the interaction with NPC, taking place between ERK-binding sites at nucleoporins and ERK1/2 hydrophobic residues. Such a process would occur independently of energy and without the participation of Ran and subject to inhibition by PEA15. (b) The presence of Mxi2 is sufficient to drive ERK1/2 into the nucleus, even without stimulation. Mxi2 constitutively binds to ERK1/2, this interaction taking place through the Mxi2 C-terminus and ERK1/2 Insert region. Hydrophobic residues are conserved in Mxi2, whereby it binds ERK-binding sites in nucleoporins, although with much higher affinity. Mxi2 transports ERK1/2 into the nucleus by a high-efficiency mechanism that is dependent on energy and Ran and is unaffected by PEA15. In this respect, we have unveiled Mxi2 as a unique protein in its role of promoting stimulus-independent ERK1/2 nuclear import.
