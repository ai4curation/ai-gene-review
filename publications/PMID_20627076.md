The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is evolutionary conserved signaling system that 
regulates cell differentiation and organogenesis. We show that endothelial 
specific stabilization of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling alters early vascular 
development in the embryo. The phenotype resembles that induced by upregulation 
of Notch signaling, including lack of vascular remodeling, altered elongation of 
the intersomitic vessels, defects in branching, and loss of venous identity. 
Both in vivo and in vitro data show that beta-catenin upregulates Dll4 
transcription and strongly increases Notch signaling in the endothelium, leading 
to functional and morphological alterations. The functional consequences of 
beta-catenin signaling depend on the stage of vascular development and are lost 
when a gain-of-function mutation is induced at a late stage of development or 
postnatally. Our findings establish a link between Wnt and Notch signaling in 
vascular development. We propose that early and sustained beta-catenin signaling 
prevents correct endothelial cell differentiation, altering vascular remodeling 
and arteriovenous specification.

Introduction

The Wnt canonical signaling pathway regulates fundamental aspects of development including cell-fate specification, proliferation, survival, and overall organogenesis (for review, see Angers and Moon, 2009 ; Clevers, 2006 ; Dickinson and McMahon, 1992 ; Junghans et al., 2005 ; Klaus and Birchmeier, 2008 ). Wnt proteins are a large family of secreted signaling molecules that signal through binding to a coreceptor complex formed by the seven-pass transmembrane proteins of the frizzled (Fzd) family and the lipoprotein receptor related 5/6 (Lrp5/6) proteins. This interaction leads to inactivation of a destruction complex that includes glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), the scaffolding protein axin, and adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC). The complex phosphorylates β-catenin and targets it for ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. In the presence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin is not phosphorylated and is therefore free to translocate to the nucleus and modulate cell transcription. β-catenin also links cadherins at cell-to-cell adherens junctions and stabilizes their interaction with the cytoskeleton.

It has been reported that canonical Wnt pathway may regulate cardiac and vascular development in the embryo (for review, see Goodwin and D’Amore [2002 ] and Parmalee and Kitajewski [2008 ]). Endothelial specific deletion of β-catenin alters the development of the embryonic vasculature and results in early lethality in utero at embryonic day (E)12.5 ( Cattelino et al., 2003 ). The vessels show changes in vascular lumen, defects of vascular remodeling, and diffuse hemorrhages in different regions of the vascular tree. Furthermore, loss of β-catenin causes defective endocardial cushion and cardiac valve development due to altered endothelial mesenchymal transformation ( Liebner et al., 2004 ). In absence of β-catenin, endothelial adherens junctions present a different molecular organization, which may contribute to vascular fragility. However, loss of Wnt signaling can also play a role in the observed phenotype. Consistently, ablation of Fzd5 ( Ishikawa et al., 2001 ) and Wnt2 ( Monkley et al., 1996 ) leads to a defective placenta vascularization and, in the case of Fzd5, also to defective remodeling of the yolk sac vasculature after E10.5. Furthermore, Wnt7b is responsible for hyaloid vessel regression in the retina ( Lobov et al., 2005 ), and the binding of norrin to Fzd4 plays an important role in angiogenesis of the eye and the ear through stabilization of β-catenin ( Xu et al., 2004 ; Ye et al., 2009 ). Finally, the differentiation of brain microvasculature to acquire blood brain barrier characteristics requires Wnt signaling and β-catenin transcriptional activity ( Daneman et al., 2009 ; Liebner et al., 2008 ; Stenman et al., 2008 ).

Wnt cooperates frequently with the Notch signaling pathway in different cellular systems such as hemopoietic stem cells and heart development ( Cohen et al., 2008 ; Grego-Bessa et al., 2007 ); however, little is known about the cooperation of Wnt and Notch in vascular development.

It has been reported that Notch signaling controls multiple aspects of endothelial cells (ECs) function such as growth, migration, lumen formation, and arteriovenous determination ( Hellstrom et al., 2007 ; Hofmann and Iruela-Arispe, 2007 ; Lawson et al., 2001 ; Phng and Gerhardt, 2009 ; Roca and Adams, 2007 ; Suchting et al., 2007 ; Thurston et al., 2007 ). Recent studies in several experimental models show that this signaling pathway acts by limiting vascular sprouting. Suppression of Notch signaling by different tools markedly augments vascular density, branching, and hyperfusion of the capillary network.

In this work, we have studied endothelial-specific β-catenin gain-of-function (GOF) mutant mice to obtain a more comprehensive idea of the role of canonical Wnt signaling in ECs and to better define the mechanism of action of this pathway. We report that these β-catenin GOF mutant embryos die in utero with major alterations of vascular development. Vessels were unable to sprout and branch correctly, presented altered lumen, and showed a strongly affected arterial-venous specification. qRT-PCR analysis of ECs isolated from mutant embryos showed a significant increase in Dll4/Notch signaling. Isolated and cultured ECs expressing the same β-catenin GOF mutation also showed a strong increase in Dll4/Notch signaling accompanied by reduced sprouting activity. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays showed β-catenin binding to the Dll4 promoter. These data determine a sequential and direct link between β-catenin and Notch signaling systems to tune ECs differentiation and vascular morphogenesis.

Discussion

Wnt and Notch signaling pathways act in concert during embryo development in patterning processes and in cell fate decisions ( Clevers, 2006 ; Phng and Gerhardt, 2009 ). Although the relevance of these two signaling systems is undoubted, the molecular mechanisms that mediate their reciprocal regulation are still not understood completely. We report that sustained β-catenin signaling in ECs leads to early embryonic death due to severe alterations in the development of the vascular system. The link between these alterations and high or uncontrolled Notch signaling is supported by several evidences: (1) in β-catenin GOF mutants, Dll4 and the downstream effectors are strongly increased in the embryo, in freshly isolated β-catenin GOF embryonic ECs and in β-catenin GOF cultured ECs—in contrast, freshly isolated ECs from LOF β-catenin embryos express decreased amounts of Dll4 and Notch effectors; (2) increased Notch nuclear signaling on β-catenin GOF mutation was detected in the mutant embryos and cultured cells; (3) the morphogenetic defects described in the β-catenin GOF mutants were comparable, at least in part, to those described when Notch signaling was increased by Dll4 upregulation in vivo, including lack of vascular remodeling in the yolk sac and in the head, impaired ECs migration, altered elongation of the intersomitic vessels, defects in branching, and loss of arterial-venous identity causing AV shunts leading to bypass circulation ( Carlson et al., 2005 ; Trindade et al., 2008 ); and (4) DAPT treatment partially reverted the cellular and vascular phenotype.

To better understand the molecular basis of β-catenin and Dll4 interaction and to exclude indirect effects due to altered blood flow or organ perfusion, we focused on cultured β-catenin GOF mutant ECs. These cells showed increased Notch signaling and functional alterations similar to those reported for cells expressing a GOF mutant of Notch ( Trindade et al., 2008 ). These include defects in actin organization and elongation, sprouting activity, upregulation of lamellipodia and abrogation of filopodia. DAPT treatment of β-catenin GOF mutant cells reverted significantly this phenotype.

Besides Notch activation, β-catenin stabilization may act through other pathways such as modification of junction organization and increase in cell-to-cell adhesion strength ( Cattelino et al., 2003 ). Although we cannot fully rule out this possibility, the effect on cell migration and Dll4 expression are blocked by a dominant-negative mutant (dnTCF4) that inhibits only β-catenin transcriptional activity without modifying its recruitment and activity at junctions. Moreover, a β-catenin mutant (LefΔN-βCTA) with strong transcriptional activity but unable to bind cadherins, can reproduce the effect of inhibition of cell sprouting whereas a mutant that is able to link cadherins but unable to translocate to the nucleus (ΔC-Far) is inactive. Finally ChIP and luciferase reporter analysis showed β-catenin binding to Dll4 promoter in parallel with its upregulation.

β-catenin can also modulate the expression of other genes that may contribute to the observed embryo phenotype. This cannot be excluded and deserves further investigation; however, a significant part of the vascular defects detected in this study seems to be comparable to those observed in Dll4 sustained expression in vivo. This aspect and the extensive set of data discussed above make us rather confident that activation of the Notch system contributes at least to a good extent to the observed vascular phenotype in early embryo.

These data introduce what we believe to be a novel and important level of regulation of vascular angiogenesis and endothelial specification mediated by the cross talk between Wnt and Notch signaling pathways. In a previous work ( Phng et al., 2009 ) reported that Notch can upregulate β-catenin signaling through induction of Nrarp. This factor acts as a feed back mechanism by limiting Notch on one side while upregulating Wnt signaling on the other. The final result of loss of Nrarp in vivo is vascular regression. Therefore, Wnt and Notch pathways can reciprocally modulate each other by induction of activators or repressors. Jag1, which is the second Notch ligand present in ECs, can antagonize Dll4 activity in postnatal retina ( Benedito et al., 2009 ). Jag1 was found to be upregulated by β-catenin signaling in non-ECs ( Estrach et al., 2006 ). However, in this study we found only very modest changes in the expression of this ligand in the embryo suggesting that, at early stages of vascular development, β-catenin signaling is switching the equilibrium in favor of Dll4.

In our experimental system, we amplified β-catenin signaling by maintaining high levels of the stabilized protein during vascular development. However, other data suggest that wildtype β-catenin signaling is important also in physiological vascular morphogenesis. In controls embryos, we were able to detect β-catenin signaling in several types of developing vessels. Cultured control ECs show increased nuclear β-catenin and signaling during migration. In the absence of β -catenin, quite a few vascular regions such as the perineural vascular plexus or retina vasculature present altered morphology. Furthermore, β-catenin signaling was shown to be required for brain angiogenesis and for the development of a stable vasculature ( Cattelino et al., 2003 ; Daneman et al., 2009 ; Liebner et al., 2008 ; Lobov et al., 2005 ; Stenman et al., 2008 ).

The observations reported here also show that, surprisingly, activation of β-catenin signaling has different consequences depending on the stage of vascular development in the embryo. Activation of β-catenin does not modify arteriovenous specification in the late embryo or in the postnatal retina. In other cell systems, canonic Wnt signal controls progenitor cell expansion and lineage decision in early embryo in a temporally regulated way (see Clevers [2006 ] and Grigoryan et al. [2008 ]). Wnt signaling plays different and sometimes even opposite activities at different stages of embryo development ( Ueno et al., 2007 ; Grigoryan et al., 2008 ). From E14.5 arteriovenous differentiation of endothelial cells is largely completed (for review, see Oliver and Srinivasan, 2010 ) and this could explain why late activation of β-catenin expression is no longer affecting vascular specification.

In cultured ECs, β-catenin translocation to the nucleus and Notch signaling is stronger in cells at the migrating front. This is detectable already in wild-type endothelium and is more evident in cells expressing β-catenin GOF mutation. This suggests that, because migrating cells have weaker and partially dismantled junctions, β-catenin interaction with cadherins is reduced in strength and the protein may be released in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus. Taddei et al. (2008) showed that β-catenin signaling is increased in sparse cells as compared to confluent stable cell monolayers. Consistently, β-catenin binding to Dll4 promoter is higher in control wounded cell monolayers as compared to confluent cells and this parallels the increase in Notch signaling detected in these cells.

In conclusion, our study introduces canonical Wnt signaling as an important pathway in modulating endothelial differentiation and vascular development in the embryo. We propose that when ECs are activated by canonical Wnt signaling, β-catenin translocates to the nucleus and transcriptionally upregulates Dll4. Wnt and Notch systems are known in other cell systems to act in concert to determine cell fate and a complex system of activators and feedback inhibitors are needed to finely tune this interaction and promote correct vascular development and remodeling.
