Hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor for development of vascular diabetic 
complications. Vascular dysfunction in diabetics manifests in a tissue-specific 
manner; macrovasculature is affected by atherosclerotic lesions, and 
microvascular complications are described as "aberrant angiogenesis": in the 
same patient angiogenesis is increased in some tissues (e.g. retinal 
neovascularization) and decreased in others (e.g. in skin). Molecular cell- and 
tissue-specific mechanisms regulating the response of vasculature to 
hyperglycemia remain unclear. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a potent antiangiogenic 
and proatherogenic protein, has been implicated in the development of several 
vascular diabetic complications (atherosclerosis, nephropathy, and 
cardiomyopathy). This study examines cell type-specific regulation of production 
of thrombospondin-1 by high glucose. We previously reported the increased 
expression of TSP-1 in the large arteries of diabetic animals. mRNA and protein 
levels were up-regulated in response to high glucose. Unlike in macrovascular 
cells, TSP-1 protein levels are dramatically decreased in response to high 
glucose in microvascular endothelial cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells 
(RPE). This down-regulation is post-transcriptional; mRNA levels are increased. 
In situ mRNA hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that the level of 
mRNA is up-regulated in RPE of diabetic rats, whereas the protein level is 
decreased. This cell type-specific posttranscriptional suppression of TSP-1 
production in response to high glucose in microvascular endothelial cells and 
RPE is controlled by untranslated regions of TSP-1 mRNA that regulate coupling 
of TSP-1 mRNA to polysomes and its translation. The cell-specific regulation of 
TSP-1 suggests a potential mechanism for the aberrant angiogenesis in diabetics 
and TSP-1 involvement in development of various vascular diabetic complications.
