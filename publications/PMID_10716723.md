In Arabidopsis, the MADS-box protein encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is a 
repressor of flowering. Vernalization, which promotes flowering in the 
late-flowering ecotypes and many late-flowering mutants, decreases the level of 
FLC transcript and protein in the plant. This vernalization-induced reduction in 
FLC transcript levels is mitotically stable and occurs in all tissues. FLC 
activity is restored in each generation, as is the requirement of a 
low-temperature exposure for the promotion of flowering. The level of FLC 
determines the extent of the vernalization response in the promotion of 
flowering, and there is a quantitative relationship between the duration of cold 
treatment and the extent of down-regulation of FLC activity. We conclude that 
FLC is the central regulator of the induction of flowering by vernalization. 
Other vernalization-responsive late-flowering mutants, which are disrupted in 
genes that encode regulators of FLC, are late-flowering as a consequence of 
their elevated levels of FLC.
