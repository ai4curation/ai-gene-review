Recent years, the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in atrial fibrillation 
(AF) has been gradually elucidated. In the current study, we measured the 
expression of ten AF-related lncRNAs to do qRT-PCR analysis. LncRNA KCNQ1 
overlapping transcript 1 (KCNQ1OT1) was found to be significantly upregulated in 
AF model and Ang-II-induced mice heart. CACNA1C has been reported as a biomarker 
in atrial fibrillation. Here, we found that the expression pattern of CACNA1C 
was consistent with that of KCNQ1OT1. Electrophysiological study was conducted 
to demonstrate the effect of KCNQ1OT1 and CACNA1C on the Effective refractory 
period (ERP), interatrial conduction time (IACT), incidence of AF and AF 
duration of Ang-II-induced mice heart. Mechanically, KCNQ1OT1 contributed to the 
upregulation of CACNA1C by binding with miR-384. Furthermore, YY1 could activate 
the transcription of KCNQ1OT1 and CACNA1C. In conclusion, the present study 
revealed that YY1-induced upregulation of lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 regulates angiotensin 
II-induced atrial fibrillation by regulating miR-384/CACNA1C axis.
