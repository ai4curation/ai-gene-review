Iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster-containing proteins constitute one of the largest 
protein classes, with highly varied function. Consequently, the biosynthesis of 
Fe/S clusters is evolutionarily conserved and mutations in intermediate Fe/S 
cluster scaffold proteins can cause disease, including multiple mitochondrial 
dysfunctions syndrome (MMDS). Herein, we have characterized the impact of 
defects occurring in the MMDS1 disease state that result from a point mutation 
(p.Gly189Arg) near the active site of NFU1, an Fe/S scaffold protein. In vitro 
investigation into the structure-function relationship of the Gly189Arg 
derivative, along with two other variants, reveals that substitution at position 
189 triggers structural changes that increase flexibility, decrease stability, 
and alter the monomer-dimer equilibrium toward monomer, thereby impairing the 
ability of the Gly189X derivatives to receive an Fe/S cluster from 
physiologically relevant sources.
