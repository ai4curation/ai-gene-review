Brca1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains are a common protein-protein interaction motif 
in proteins involved in the DNA damage response and DNA repair. The DNA-damage 
response protein 53BP1 has two BRCT domains that bind to the DNA-binding domain 
of p53. The 53BP1 tandem-BRCT region is homologous to the tandem-BRCT region of 
Brca1, which is involved in double-strand break repair and homologous 
recombination and which binds BACH1, a member of the DEAH helicase family. Here 
we report the structures of a human 53BP1-p53 complex and of the rat Brca1 BRCT 
repeats. The 53BP1-p53 structure shows that the two BRCT repeats are arranged 
tandemly and pack extensively through an interface that also involves the 
inter-repeat linker. The first BRCT repeat and the linker together bind p53 on a 
region that overlaps with the DNA-binding surface of p53 and involves p53 
residues that are mutated in cancer and are important for DNA binding. 
Comparison with the structure of the tandem-BRCT region of Brca1 shows a 
remarkable conservation of the repeat arrangement and of the inter-BRCT repeat 
interface. Analysis of human BRCA1 tumor-derived mutations and conservation 
identifies a potential protein-binding site that we show through mutagenesis is 
involved in BACH1 binding. The BACH1-binding region of Brca1 consists of a 
unique insertion in the first BRCT repeat and the inter-repeat linker and is 
analogous to the region of 53BP1 that binds p53.

Abstract

Brca1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains are a common protein–protein interaction motif in proteins involved in the DNA damage response and DNA repair. The DNA-damage response protein 53BP1 has two BRCT domains that bind to the DNA-binding domain of p53. The 53BP1 tandem-BRCT region is homologous to the tandem-BRCT region of Brca1, which is involved in double-strand break repair and homologous recombination and which binds BACH1, a member of the DEAH helicase family. Here we report the structures of a human 53BP1–p53 complex and of the rat Brca1 BRCT repeats. The 53BP1–p53 structure shows that the two BRCT repeats are arranged tandemly and pack extensively through an interface that also involves the inter-repeat linker. The first BRCT repeat and the linker together bind p53 on a region that overlaps with the DNA-binding surface of p53 and involves p53 residues that are mutated in cancer and are important for DNA binding. Comparison with the structure of the tandem-BRCT region of Brca1 shows a remarkable conservation of the repeat arrangement and of the inter-BRCT repeat interface. Analysis of human BRCA1 tumor-derived mutations and conservation identifies a potential protein-binding site that we show through mutagenesis is involved in BACH1 binding. The BACH1-binding region of Brca1 consists of a unique insertion in the first BRCT repeat and the inter-repeat linker and is analogous to the region of 53BP1 that binds p53.

Discussion

The BRCT motif has been implicated in protein–protein interactions in several proteins involved in DNA repair and recombination. In addition to 53BP1–p53 and Brca1–BACH1 complexes, XRCC1 and DNA ligase III, which are involved in base excision repair, have been shown to interact with each other through their C-terminal single BRCT motifs ( Ljungquist et al. 1994 ; Caldecott et al. 1995 ; Nash et al. 1997 ). In the structure of the 53BP1–p53 complex, both a core BRCT structural element (α4A helix) and a unique linker element mediate p53 binding (Fig. 3 ). The participation of the inter-repeat linker in p53 binding may help explain the conservation of the inter-BRCT repeat interface. As the linker structure folds on the interface, an important functional role for the linker would be reflected in the conservation and integrity of the interface.

Strikingly, the structure of the rat Brca1 tandem-BRCT repeats shows not only a near identical arrangement of the two repeats but also very similar inter-BRCT contacts and an analogous linker structure at the interface (Fig. 2 C). Sequence conservation and tumor-derived mutations suggest that region I, consisting of the inter-BRCT repeat interface, the linker, and a β-hairpin insertion adjacent to the linker is important for Brca1 function, and mutations in solvent-exposed residues of this region demonstrate that it is involved in binding BACH1 (Fig. 4 A–C). Interestingly, region I of Brca1 overlaps with the region of 53BP1 that binds p53 (Figs. 1 A,B, 4C), revealing similarities not only in the structures of the Brca1 and 53BP1 BRCT repeats but also in the way they function in protein–protein interactions. Although both proteins use a similar region to bind their respective partners, the structural details in their protein-binding sites differ. The presence of the insertion hairpin in Brca1 would sterically prevent p53 from binding to this site.

The comparison of the 53BP1 and Brca1 BRCT structures suggests that the BRCT-containing proteins evolved specificity for different proteins not only by evolving different amino acids on structurally conserved portions of the core BRCT motif, but also by evolving divergent structural elements as insertions within or in between BRCT repeats. This is reminiscent of other regularly repeating protein-recognition motifs, where divergence from a canonical structure is often associated with a functional uniqueness and biological specificity. For example, in the four-ankyrin repeat protein p16 INK4A , a divergent region of the second ankyrin repeat that has a helix replaced by a loop has a central role in binding Cdk6 ( Russo et al. 1998 ).

The similar structures of the 53BP1 and rat Brca1 tandem-BRCT regions suggest that the two proteins may be evolutionarily related, possibly having diverged from a common tandem-BRCT ancestral protein. This observation, coupled to the conservation of residues in the inter-BRCT repeat interface between 53BP1, Brca1, and the S. pombe Crb2 and S. cerevisiae Rad9 DNA damage checkpoint genes, supports the proposed model that these proteins may share similarities in their cellular functions as well ( Saka et al. 1997 ).
