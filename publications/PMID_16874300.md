Abstract

Naïve T helper (Th) cells differentiate in response to antigen stimulation into either Th1 or Th2 effector cells, which are characterized by the secretion of different set of cytokines. Th2 differentiation, which is critical for allergic airway disease, is triggered by signals of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the cytokines generated during polarization, particularly IL-4. We determine here the potential role of the signaling adapter p62 in T-cell polarization. We report using p62 −/− mice and cells that p62 acts downstream TCR activation, and is important for Th2 polarization and asthma, playing a significant role in the control of the sustained activation of NF-κB and late synthesis of GATA3 and IL-4 by participating in the activation of the IKK complex.

Introduction

The abnormal activation and/or differentiation of CD4 + T lymphocytes along the T helper 2 cell (Th2) lineage underlie the pathology of asthma and other allergic diseases ( Luster and Tager, 2004 ). Naïve Th cells differentiate in response to antigen stimulation into either Th1 or Th2 effector cells, which secrete different sets of cytokines and perform also different regulatory functions in the immune system ( Mosmann and Coffman, 1989 ; Shuai and Liu, 2003 ). Th1 cells mainly produce IFN-γ and IL-2, and play an essential role in cell-mediated immune responses against intracellular pathogens. On the other hand, Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13, and are important in the control of humoral immunity and allergy. Understanding the signaling pathways controlling Th2 differentiation is of paramount importance not only because it would lead to better therapies for asthma but also because it constitutes a paradigmatic model of cell differentiation in which a large number of signaling cascades have to crosstalk for an adequate control of the process ( Paul and Seder, 1994 ). Th2 differentiation is modulated by signals emanating from the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the cytokines generated during polarization, particularly IL-4, which is added in the culture medium of CD4 + T cells induced to differentiate into the Th2 lineage in vitro ( Ho and Glimcher, 2002 ; Murphy and Reiner, 2002 ). Therefore, IL-4 is important for induction and maintenance of differentiated Th2 cells. It shares with IL-13 interactions with the IL-4R chain and activates the transcription factor Stat6 through a Jak1/Jak3 signaling pathway ( O'Shea et al , 2002 ). The crosstalk between signals generated by the TCR and IL-4 results in the physiological activation of T cells to induce and activate Th2-polarized T cells ( Murphy and Reiner, 2002 ). Recently, we have found that the atypical PKC isoform PKCζ plays a critical role in Th2 differentiation and allergic airway inflammation, acting upstream Jak1 in the IL-4 signaling pathway ( Martin et al , 2005 ). PKCζ and the other atypical PKC isofom PKCλ/ι harbor a PB1 domain at their N-terminal region, which interacts with other PB1 domain-containing proteins, such as p62 and Par-6, that act as scaffolds conferring specificity to the kinase's actions ( Moscat and Diaz-Meco, 2002 ). Thus, the binding of the aPKCs with Par-6 serves to locate these enzymes in the polarity pathways, whereas the aPKC–p62 interaction is important for the sustained activation of NF-κB during osteoclast differentiation ( Moscat and Diaz-Meco, 2002 ; Duran et al , 2004b ). Since PKCζ is important during Th2 polarization and asthma, and because p62 is a scaffold of the aPKCs in several cells systems, we sought to determine here the potential role of p62 in these biological processes. We have found that, in marked contrast to the PKCζ −/− phenotype, the loss of p62 does not lead to an appreciable impairment of the IL-4 signaling pathway but plays an essential role downstream of TCR activation in the stimulation of the late and sustained NF-κB pathway, a required event for Th2 polarization and allergic airway inflammation.

Discussion

Although the presence of IL-12 or IL-4 in the culture media of differentiating T lymphocytes is important for the polarization of these cells along the Th1 or the Th2 lineages, respectively, it is also clear that signals emanating from the TCR are critical for the commitment of these cells along each polarization program ( Murphy and Reiner, 2002 ). Recently, several signaling molecules have been shown to play important roles during Th2 differentiation. These include, for example, SLAM, SAP and SLAT ( Fields and Flavell, 2001 ; Wu et al , 2001 ; Tanaka et al , 2003 ; Cannons et al , 2004 ). Experiments in which SLAT was ectopically expressed demonstrate that it is able to drive Th2 polarization in vitro , which suggests that it may be important in this differentiation process ( Tanaka et al , 2003 ). Consistent with this, SLAT is upregulated in Th2-polarized T cells but the kinetics of its induction indicates that SLAT does not appear to play a selective role in the initial TCR-derived signals required for Th2 polarization but probably in the TCR signals that serve to promote differentiation of already committed Th2 cells ( Tanaka et al , 2003 ). In contrast, SAP does not appear to be induced during lymphocyte differentiation but its genetic ablation impairs Th2 polarization by inhibiting PKCθ recruitment and Bcl-10 phosphorylation, which leads to the impairment of NF-κB signaling without affecting ERK activation ( Cannons et al , 2004 ). These results suggest that the inactivation of NF-κB is sufficient to block Th2 polarization, whereas ERK and the other activities are not sufficient to activate this process. Similar to SAP, p62 is required for NF-κB activation but only at late points in the T-cell differentiation program with no effects on early signaling cascades including Bcl-10 phosphorylation. This could be explained by the fact that, similar to SLAT, p62 is induced relatively late in the differentiation program of naïve T cells although it is more significantly accumulated when cells are polarized along the Th2 than the Th1 program. Therefore, p62 emerges as a novel critical component of the signaling complex controlling NF-κB stimulation and IL-4 synthesis at the level of GATA3 production in the late phases of T-cell activation, which are important for Th2 differentiation events and asthma. Although the precise mechanism whereby late TCR signals activate the sustained phase of NF-κB activation is not totally clear yet and might involve autocrine pathways, what is clear is that p62 is bound to Malt1 and is recruited to the IKK complex at late but not early times following TCR activation. This suggests that this p62-mediated late cascade may be proximal to TCR-triggered events. p62 is a scaffold protein that binds the aPKCs through its PB1 domain ( Moscat and Diaz-Meco, 2002 ; Moscat et al , 2003 ). Interestingly, PKCζ is also important for Th2 differentiation and allergic airway inflammation ( Martin et al , 2005 ); however, both molecules use different pathways to control that function—PKCζ is important for the activation of the IL-4/Jak1/Stat6 pathway ( Duran et al , 2004a ; Martin et al , 2005 ) and p62 is not but participates in NF-κB signaling. Although PKCζ has been demonstrated genetically to impinge in the NF-κB cascade in lung, embryo fibroblasts and B cells ( Leitges et al , 2001 ; Martin et al , 2002 ; Duran et al , 2003 ), it is not essential for the activation of NF-κB in naïve ( Martin et al , 2002 ) or Th2-polarized cells ( Martin et al , 2005 ). This highlights the cell-type-specific functions of signaling molecules and demonstrates the importance of members of the atypical PKC pathways in the control of an appropriate immune response. Therefore, we can speculate that if an aPKC is responsible for the p62 actions on NF-κB in T cells, PKCλ/ι appears to be a good candidate. In this regard, it should be noted that the genetic inactivation of the aPKC inhibitor, Par-4, in mice leads to hyperactivation of T cells and increased generation of Th2 cytokines in ex vivo cultures of T cells ( Garcia-Cao et al , 2003 ; Lafuente et al , 2003 ). Collectively, these results suggest that PKCλ/ι may be a critical component in the p62-mediated pathway to NF-κB activation during Th2 polarization. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that Malt1 controls IKK activity through a process that involves the ubiquitination, in a K63 fashion, of the Nemo/IKKγ subunit of the IKK complex ( Sun et al , 2004 ; Zhou et al , 2004 ). In addition, Nemo/IKKγ binds polyubiquitinated RIP1, which is an important intermediate in TNFα-activated NF-κB ( Ea et al , 2006 ; Wu et al , 2006 ). However, how this novel function of Nemo/IKKγ impinges on the TCR pathway for IKK activation is not clear yet. Nonetheless, the data presented here demonstrate that Malt1, TRAF6, p62 and IKKγ form a complex that is important for the control of IKKγ ubiquitination, IKKα/β phosphorylation and NF-κB activation in Th2-polarized cells. Recent results implicate p62 in the control of ubiquitination during NF-κB activation. However, although important, IKKγ ubiquitination does not seem to be sufficient for triggering the NF-κB pathway, at least in T cells ( Su et al , 2005 ). Whether PKCλ/ι somehow regulates this critical ubiquitination process or stimulates an additional signal for stimulation of the IKK complex is not clear yet and will be addressed as mice with tissue-specific genetic ablation of PKCλ/ι become available.
