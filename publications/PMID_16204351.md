Mutations in the human parkin gene encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase have been 
associated with early-onset recessive forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
However, the molecular mechanisms by which mutations in the parkin gene cause PD 
are still under debate. Here, we identified and characterized the Caenorhabditis 
elegans parkin homolog, pdr-1. PDR-1 protein physically associates and 
cooperates with a conserved degradation machinery to mediate ubiquitin 
conjugation. Strikingly, in contrast to pdr-1 loss-of-function mutants, an 
in-frame deletion variant with altered solubility and intracellular localization 
properties is hypersensitive toward different proteotoxic stress conditions. 
Both endoplasmic reticulum-derived folding stress and cytosolic stress conferred 
by expression of mutant human alpha-synuclein resulted in severe developmental 
defects and lethality in pdr-1(lg103) mutant background. Furthermore, we show 
that the corresponding truncated protein PDR-1(Deltaaa24-247) aggregates in cell 
culture, but still interacts with its ubiquitylation co-enzymes. Thus, it might 
block the cellular degradation/detoxification machinery and therefore renders 
worms highly vulnerable to protein folding stress. In contrast to other complete 
gene knockouts or RNAi models of Parkin function, this C. elegans model 
recapitulates Parkin insolubility and aggregation similar to several autosomal 
recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP)-linked Parkin mutations. We suggest that 
such Parkin variants that either confer a neomorphic function or a partial 
loss-of-function may help to further elucidate the biological function of Parkin 
in vivo and the pathogenic mechanisms resulting in AR-JP. Due to high-throughput 
capacity of C. elegans, this model is particularly well suited to identify 
genetic and chemical modifiers of toxicity.
