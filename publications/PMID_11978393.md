NDRG4, a member of the new NDRG gene family, was originally cloned as a gene 
that was expressed predominantly in the early postnatal rat brain. To determine 
whether the NDRG4 protein contributes to differentiation of neural cells, the 
effect of lowering the cellular NDRG4 protein level on the nerve growth factor 
(NGF)-induced neurite formations and transcription factor activations in PC12 
cells was examined. An antisense construct of rat NDRG4 cDNA was made and 
transfected to PC12 cells, which constitutively express a basal level of the 
NDRG4 protein. Of the stably transfected antisense cell clones that expressed 
exogenous NDRG4 antisense RNA, six clones showed reduced levels of the NDRG4 
protein, but unexpectedly two clones showed quite higher levels of NDRG4 protein 
than the control cells. The clones having decreased levels of the NDRG4 protein 
extended shorter neurites than control cells in response to NGF or dibutyryl 
cAMP. In contrast, the NDRG4 protein-highly expressing clones did not show 
suppressed neurite outgrowth induced by NGF. NGF-mediated activation of the 
transcription factor AP-1 was found to be suppressed in the NDRG4 
protein-diminished clone and enhanced in the NDRG4 protein-upregulated clone as 
compared with those in the control cells. These results suggest that NDRG4 plays 
a role in neurite outgrowth and has an influence on an NGF-stimulated AP-1 
activation by an undefined mechanism in PC12 cells.
