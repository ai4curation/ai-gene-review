Signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα), an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory 
motif (ITIM)-containing receptor, is an essential negative regulator of 
leukocyte inflammatory responses. Here we report that SIRPα cytoplasmic 
signalling ITIMs in neutrophils are cleaved during active inflammation and that 
the loss of SIRPα ITIMs enhances the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) 
inflammatory response. Using human leukocytes and two inflammatory models in 
mice, we show that the cleavage of SIRPα ITIMs in PMNs but not monocytes occurs 
at the post-acute stage of inflammation and correlates with increased PMN 
recruitment to inflammatory loci. Enhanced transmigration of PMNs and 
PMN-associated tissue damage are confirmed in mutant mice expressing SIRPα but 
lacking the ITIMs. Moreover, the loss of SIRPα ITIMs in PMNs during colitis is 
blocked by an anti-interleukin-17 (IL-17) antibody. These results demonstrate a 
SIRPα-based mechanism that dynamically regulates PMN inflammatory responses by 
generating a CD47-binding but non-signalling SIRPα 'decoy'.
