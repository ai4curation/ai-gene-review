We used a substrate-trapping technique to search for substrates of protein 
tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B. A catalytically inactive form of this enzyme 
forms a stable, phosphotyrosine-dependent complex with epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) both in vitro and in cells. PTP1B also interacts with activated 
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) but not with colony-stimulating 
factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R). After binding to EGFR, PTP1B becomes 
tyrosine-phosphorylated at Tyr-66, a site that conforms to the consensus binding 
sequence for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the adapter protein Grb2. This 
tyrosine phosphorylation is correlated with a 3-fold increase in PTP catalytic 
activity. These findings suggest that PTP1B selectively regulates specific 
activated receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) in vivo and might itself be 
regulated by such receptors.

Abstract

We used a substrate-trapping technique to search for substrates of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B. A catalytically inactive form of this enzyme forms a stable, phosphotyrosine-dependent complex with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) both in vitro and in cells. PTP1B also interacts with activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) but not with colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R). After binding to EGFR, PTP1B becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated at Tyr-66, a site that conforms to the consensus binding sequence for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the adapter protein Grb2. This tyrosine phosphorylation is correlated with a 3-fold increase in PTP catalytic activity. These findings suggest that PTP1B selectively regulates specific activated receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) in vivo and might itself be regulated by such receptors.
