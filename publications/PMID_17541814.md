HCCA2 (hepatocellular carcinoma-associated gene 2) was initially identified as a 
HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma)-specific protein and subsequently, a long splice 
variant of HCCA2 was identified as a co-activator of transcription factor YY1 
(Yin Yang 1). To investigate the role of HCCA2 in HCC genesis and progression, 
we screened a human fetal liver cDNA library and identified a novel 
HCCA2-interacting protein, MAD2L2 (MAD2 mitotic arrest deficient-like 2 
(yeast)). The interaction between HCCA2 and MAD2L2 was confirmed by in vitro and 
in vivo binding assays and the interaction domain was mapped to the N-terminus 
of HCCA2 by sequential deletion. HCCA2 and MAD2L2 also colocalized in the 
nucleus of Hela cells. Furthermore, overexpression of HCCA2 led to cell cycle 
arrest at G0/G1 phase and therefore inhibited cell proliferation. Our research 
suggests that HCCA2 may play a novel role in cell cycle regulation.
