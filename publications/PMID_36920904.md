RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) controls expression of all protein-coding genes and 
most noncoding loci in higher eukaryotes. Calibrating RNAPII activity requires 
an assortment of polymerase-associated factors that are recruited at sites of 
active transcription. The Integrator complex is one of the most elusive 
transcriptional regulators in metazoans, deemed to be recruited after initiation 
to help establish and modulate paused RNAPII. Integrator is known to be composed 
of 14 subunits that assemble and operate in a modular fashion. We employed 
proteomics and machine-learning structure prediction (AlphaFold2) to identify an 
additional Integrator subunit, INTS15. We report that INTS15 assembles primarily 
with the INTS13/14/10 module and interfaces with the Int-PP2A module. Functional 
genomics analysis further reveals a role for INTS15 in modulating RNAPII pausing 
at a subset of genes. Our study shows that omics approaches combined with 
AlphaFold2-based predictions provide additional insights into the molecular 
architecture of large and dynamic multiprotein complexes.
