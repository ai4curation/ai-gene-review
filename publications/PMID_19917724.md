The target of rapamycin (TOR) complex 1 (TORC1) signaling pathway is a critical 
regulator of translation and cell growth. To identify novel components of this 
pathway, we performed a kinome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in Drosophila 
melanogaster S2 cells. RNAi targeting components of the p38 stress-activated 
kinase cascade prevented the cell size increase elicited by depletion of the TOR 
negative regulator TSC2. In mammalian and Drosophila tissue culture, as well as 
in Drosophila ovaries ex vivo, p38-activating stresses, such as H(2)O(2) and 
anisomycin, were able to activate TORC1. This stress-induced TORC1 activation 
could be blocked by RNAi against mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 and 6 
(MKK3/6) or by the overexpression of dominant negative Rags. Interestingly, p38 
was also required for the activation of TORC1 in response to amino acids and 
growth factors. Genetic ablation either of p38b or licorne, its upstream kinase, 
resulted in small flies consisting of small cells. Mutants with mutations in 
licorne or p38b are nutrition sensitive; low-nutrient food accentuates the 
small-organism phenotypes, as well as the partial lethality of the p38b null 
allele. These data suggest that p38 is an important positive regulator of TORC1 
in both mammalian and Drosophila systems in response to certain stresses and 
growth factors.
