Like other guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins (GEPs) that activate 
ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPases, brefeldin A-inhibited GEP2, BIG2, 
contains an approximately 200-aa Sec7 domain that is responsible for this 
catalytic activity and its inhibition by brefeldin A. The Sec7 domain is located 
near the center of the molecule and serves to accelerate replacement of GDP 
bound to ARF with GTP. To explore possible functions of the N-terminal region of 
BIG2 (1-832), we used three coding-region constructs as bait to screen a human 
heart cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid system, retrieving two unique clones 
that encode a type I protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit, RI alpha. 
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed interaction of in vitro translated 
BIG2 and RI alpha, as well as of the endogenous proteins in cytosol of cultured 
HepG2 cells. Using 28 deletion mutants, we found three regions of BIG2 that 
interacted with R subunits of PKA. Residues 27-48 (domain A) interacted with RI 
alpha and RI beta, 284-301 (domain B) interacted with RII alpha and RII beta, 
and 517-538 (domain C) interacted with RI alpha, RII alpha, and RII beta. 
Sequence analysis and helical wheel projection of amino acids in the three 
domains revealed potential amphipathic wheel structures characteristic for 
binding of PKA R subunits. Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions 
demonstrated translocation of BIG2 (and BIG1) from cytosol to the Golgi and 
other membrane structures after incubation of cells with 8-Br-cAMP or forskolin. 
All findings are consistent with a role for BIG2 as an A kinase-anchoring 
protein (or AKAP) that could coordinate cAMP and ARF regulatory pathways.
