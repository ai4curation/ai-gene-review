The mechanisms by which the sensitivity of naive CD4+ T cells to stimulation by 
the cognate antigen via the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) determines their 
differentiation into distinct helper T cell subsets remain elusive. Here we 
demonstrate functional collaboration of the ubiquitin E3 ligases Itch and WWP2 
in regulating the strength of the TCR signal. Mice lacking both Itch and WWP2 in 
T cells showed spontaneous autoimmunity and lung inflammation. CD4+ T cells 
deficient in Itch and WWP2 exhibited hypo-responsiveness to TCR stimulation and 
a bias toward differentiation into the TH2 subset of helper T cells. Itch and 
WWP2 formed a complex and cooperated to enhance TCR-proximal signaling by 
catalyzing the conjugation of atypical ubiquitin chains to the phosphatase SHP-1 
and reducing the association of SHP-1 with the tyrosine kinase Lck. These 
findings indicate that targeted ubiquitination regulates the strength of the TCR 
signal and differentiation toward the TH2 lineage.
