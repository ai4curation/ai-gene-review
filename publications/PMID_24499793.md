One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of 
insoluble extracellular amyloid plaques. These plaques are mainly constituted of 
amyloid beta peptide (A beta), a proteolytic product of amyloid precursor 
protein (APP). APP processing also generates the APP intracellular domain 
(AICD). We have previously demonstrated that AICD interacts with FKBP12, a 
peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) ubiquitous in nerve systems. This 
interaction was interfered by FK506, a clinically used immunosuppressant that 
has recently been reported to be neuroprotective. To elucidate the roles of 
FKBP12 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, the effect of FKBP12 
overexpression on APP processing was evaluated. Our results revealed that APP 
processing was shifted towards the amyloidogenic pathway, accompanied by a 
change in the subcellular localization of APP, upon FKBP12 overexpression. This 
FKBP12-overexpression-induced effect was reverted by FK506. These findings 
support our hypothesis that FKBP12 may participate in the regulation of APP 
processing. FKBP12 overexpression may lead to the stabilization of a certain 
isomer (presumably the cis form) of the Thr668-Pro669 peptide bond in AICD, 
therefore change its affinity to flotillin-1 or other raft-associated proteins, 
and eventually change the localization pattern and cause a shift in the 
proteolytic processing of APP.
