PURPOSE: Mutations in BEST1, encoding bestrophin-1 (Best1), cause autosomal 
recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB). Encoding bestrophin-1 is a pentameric anion 
channel localized to the basolateral plasma membrane of the RPE. Here, we 
characterize the effects of the mutations R141H (CGC > CAC) and I366fsX18 
(c.1098_1100+7del), identified in a patient in our practice, on Best1 
trafficking, oligomerization, and channel activity.
METHODS: Currents of Cl- were assessed in transfected HEK293 cells using 
whole-cell patch clamp. Best1 localization was assessed by confocal microscopy 
in differentiated, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE (iPSC-RPE) 
cells following expression of mutants via adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. 
Oligomerization was evaluated by coimmunoprecipitation in iPSC-RPE and MDCK 
cells.
RESULTS: Compared to Best1, Best1 I366fsX18 currents were increased while Best1 
R141H Cl- currents were diminished. Coexpression of Best1 R141H with Best1 or 
Best1 I366fsX18 resulted in rescued channel activity. Overexpressed Best1, Best1 
R141H, and Best1 I366fsX18 were all properly localized in iPSC-RPE cells; Best1 
R141H and Best1 I366fsX18 coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous Best1 in iPSC-RPE 
cells and with each other in MDCK cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The first 366 amino acids of Best1 are sufficient to mediate 
channel activity and homo-oligomerization. The combination of Best1 and Best1 
R141H does not cause disease, while Best1 R141H together with Best1 I366fsX18 
causes ARB. Since both combinations generate comparable Cl- currents, this 
indicates that ARB in this patient is not caused by a loss of channel activity. 
Moreover, Best1 I366fsX18 differs from Best1 in that it lacks most of the 
cytosolic C-terminal domain, suggesting that the loss of this region contributes 
significantly to the pathogenesis of ARB in this patient.
