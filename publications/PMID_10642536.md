Interleukin 9 (IL-9) exerts its pleiotropic effects through the IL-9 receptor 
(IL-9R) complex, which consists of the IL-9R alpha-chain, which determines the 
cytokine specificity, and the IL-2 receptor gamma-chain. In the present study we 
used a modified yeast two-hybrid system to isolate cDNA species encoding 
proteins that interacted with the intracellular domain of the human IL-9R 
alpha-chain (hIL-9Ralpha). We have identified 14-3-3zeta as an 
hIL-9Ralpha-interacting protein. We also mapped residues 518-522 
(Arg-Ser(519)-Trp-Thr(521)-Phe) in hIL-9Ralpha and helix I of 14-3-3zeta as 
being important for interaction. Moreover, peptide competition experi-ments 
suggested that interaction between hIL-9Ralpha and 14-3-3zeta requires the 
phosphorylation of Ser(519) or Thr(521). This is the first demonstration that 
14-3-3 can interact with a non-tyrosine kinase receptor. The interaction between 
14-3-3 and IL-9Ralpha but not IL-4Ralpha also suggests a potential role for 
14-3-3 in determining cytokine specificity.
