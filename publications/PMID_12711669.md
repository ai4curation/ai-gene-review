RNA helicase A (RHA) is a multifunctional protein involved in various nuclear 
processes such as transcription and RNA export. It is believed that the 
interacting factors play important roles in determining the functional 
specificity of RHA. Here we show that RHA directly interacts with 
double-stranded (ds) nucleic acids (NAs) and assembles complexes with 
topoisomerase IIalpha. First, electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrate 
that RHA interacts with dsDNAs of different lengths ranging from 15 to 104 bp. 
Secondly, the binding of RHA to closed circular dsDNA stimulates the relaxation 
reaction catalyzed by either calf thymus topoisomerase I or HeLa topoisomerase 
IIalpha. Thirdly, immunoprecipitation, coupled with western blot analysis using 
anti-RHA and anti-topoisomerase IIalpha antibodies, shows that RHA and 
topoisomerase IIalpha assemble a complex in the presence of as yet unknown RNA 
molecules and additional protein factors such as Ubc9. Our observation suggests 
physical and functional interaction between RHA and topoisomerase IIalpha, 
which, perhaps, play important roles in regulating chromatin structure. The 
putative role of RHA-topoisomerase IIalpha complex in RNA polymerase II-mediated 
transcription is discussed.

Abstract

RNA helicase A (RHA) is a multifunctional protein involved in various nuclear processes such as transcription and RNA export. It is believed that the interacting factors play important roles in determining the functional specificity of RHA. Here we show that RHA directly interacts with double-stranded (ds) nucleic acids (NAs) and assembles complexes with topoisomerase IIα. First, electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrate that RHA interacts with dsDNAs of different lengths ranging from 15 to 104 bp. Secondly, the binding of RHA to closed circular dsDNA stimulates the relaxation reaction catalyzed by either calf thymus topoisomerase I or HeLa topoisomerase IIα. Thirdly, immunoprecipitation, coupled with western blot analysis using anti-RHA and anti-topoisomerase IIα antibodies, shows that RHA and topoisomerase IIα assemble a complex in the presence of as yet unknown RNA molecules and additional protein factors such as Ubc9. Our observation suggests physical and functional interaction between RHA and topoisomerase IIα, which, perhaps, play important roles in regulating chromatin structure. The putative role of RHA–topoisomerase IIα complex in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

RNA helicase A (RHA) belongs to the asp-glu-ala-his (DEAH) helicase family ( 1 ) and unwinds both double-stranded (ds) DNA and dsRNA ( 2 – 5 ). It has been shown previously that RHA plays a critical role in mammalian development ( 6 ) and that RHA mediates the interaction between CBP/p300 and RNA polymerase II ( 7 ). RHA interacts with various nuclear factors, including the tumor suppressor BRCA1 ( 8 ), HAP95, a newly identified protein with extensive homology to AKAP95, a member of the A-kinase anchoring protein family ( 9 ), and the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex ( 10 ). These findings suggest that, in addition to transcription, RHA participates in diverse nuclear processes and that the functional specificity is not inherent but a property endowed by its interacting factors. In particular, the latter possibility can be inferred from MLE (maleless), a Drosophila ortholog of RHA that is critical for dosage compensation ( 11 – 13 ). Although present in both female and male flies, MLE increases the transcription activity of X-linked genes only in male flies through the interaction with male-specific lethal (MSL) complexes and regulatory RNA molecules such as roX1 and roX2 (RNA on X 1 and 2) ( 14 , 15 ).

Recent studies, employing RHA and MLE carrying mutations in the ATP binding motif (GKT), have shown that ATPase activity is essential for both CREB-dependent pathway in mammals and dosage compensation in Drosophila ( 5 , 7 ). Loss of MLE ATPase activity decreases roX2 RNA levels both in the nucleoplasm and in MSL complexes ( 16 ), implying that ATPase activity is required either for the association of roX2 RNA with MSL complexes, for the stability of roX2 RNA, or both. Similar to the functional interaction of MLE with roX2 RNA, RHA is also regulated by RNA molecules such as constitutive transport element ( CTE )-containing RNAs ( 17 ) or TAR encoded by type D retroviruses ( 18 ). Adenoviral VA RNAs suppress the helicase activity of RHA ( 19 ), but the functional significance of the interaction remains unknown.

Although mammalian homologs of Drosophila roX RNAs or virally encoded RNAs have yet to be found, the above observations show that RNA molecules can regulate the function of RHA. In addition to the functional interaction of RNA molecules with RHA and MLE, the importance of RNA molecules in the protein–protein interaction has been shown for topoisomerase IIα, which associates with as yet unidentified complexes in an RNase-sensitive but DNase I-resistant manner ( 20 ). This observation raises an intriguing possibility that, like MLE and MSL complexes, topoisomerase IIα forms multiprotein complexes containing RNA molecules. However, the identity of RNA molecules interacting with topoisomerase IIα and whether RNA binding activity is an intrinsic activity of topoisomerase IIα remain undetermined.

In this report, we show that RHA and topoisomerase IIα form complexes containing RNA molecules in the presence of Ubc9, a functional homolog of E2-type ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ( 21 , 22 ). Like several non-coding (nc) RNA molecules with regulatory function, including XIST/Xist ( 23 , 24 ), SRA ( 25 ) and Air RNA ( 26 ), there can exist specific RNA molecules that play a role in the RHA–topoisomerase IIα interaction. Using purified RHA and topoisomerase IIα, we also show that the binding of RHA to dsDNA augments the relaxation activity of topoisomerase IIα, whereas topoisomerase IIα suppresses the helicase activity of RHA. Our observation suggests that RHA–topoisomerase IIα complexes might regulate both the superhelicity and helicity of DNA, potentially influencing the stability and transcription activity of chromatin.

DISCUSSION

There are many parallels between RHA and MLE. Previously, we have shown that the biochemical properties of RHA and MLE are indistinguishable. The present study exhibits an additional similarity between RHA and MLE: the requirement of RNA molecules for their interaction with other proteins. The interaction between RHA and topoisomerase IIα resembles the assembly of MLE in MSL complexes containing roX1/2 RNAs ( 31 ). RNase A treatment dissociates MLE from the male X chromosome without affecting other MSL proteins or RNA polymerase II associated with the chromosome ( 31 ). In addition to MLE, at least two other MSL proteins, male-absent on the first (MOF) and MSL-3, are capable of interacting with roX2 RNA through the chromodomain ( 37 ). It is, therefore, possible that MLE interacts indirectly with MSL complexes on the X chromosome, bridged by roX2 RNA.

Based on a similar scenario, RHA and topoisomerase IIα may be brought together by RNA molecules. Obviously, the ability of topoisomerase IIα to interact with RNA molecules ( 20 , 38 ) would greatly facilitate this interaction. Alternatively, upon its binding, RNA molecules may induce a conformational change in RHA, which promotes RHA interaction with topoisomerase IIα or with other factors. To date, RNA-induced conformational changes have been shown for a few proteins such as the 40S ribosomal subunit interacting with hepatitis C virus IRES RNA ( 39 ) and PRK, a protein kinase activated by dsRNA ( 40 ).

The interaction between RHA and topoisomerase IIα requires protein factors in addition to RNA molecules. Our study shows that at least Ubc9 needs to be co-expressed to support the interaction between ectopically expressed flag-tagged RHA with topoisomerase IIα. A direct interaction has been demonstrated between Ubc9 and topoisomerase IIα or IIβ by yeast two-hybrid assay and GST pull-down assay ( 35 ). The N‐terminal 137 amino acids of RHA support the interaction of RHA with Ubc9 (K.Zhou, J.Argasinska, R.J.Donnelly, R.T.Hay and C.G.Lee, unpublished data). Thus, Ubc9 may bridge the interaction between RHA and topoisomerase IIα. The physical association with Ubc9 at the N‐terminal domain may activate RHA to recognize and bind both RNA molecules and topoisomerase IIα. Alternatively, the association with Ubc9 may enable topoisomerase IIα to form a complex with flag-tagged RHA. Identification of various factors associated with the RHA–topoisomerase IIα complex, including RNA molecules, will provide clues to the molecular nature of the RHA–topoisomerase IIα interaction.

The functional significance of RHA–topoisomerase IIα complex remains to be established. In Drosophila , topoisomerase II interacts with at least three factors such as supercoiling factor (SCF) ( 41 ), chromatin accessibility complex (CHRAC) ( 42 ) and histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) in nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex ( 43 ). SCF and topoisomerase II function jointly to introduce negative superhelical turns into DNA in vitro and co-localize to puffs on polytene chromosomes ( 2 ), implying a role for the SCF–topoisomerase II complex in gene expression. The role of topoisomerase II in transcription is also implied by the transcriptional repression of genes containing Polycomb group (PcG) target sequences in Drosophila . In general, the PcG proteins are required to preserve the transcriptionally silenced state of affected chromatin region and this process accompanies the interaction of the PcG protein Polyhomeotic with both topoisomerase II and Barren ( 44 ). The function of topoisomerase II as a co-repressor is suggested by its interaction with retinoblastoma protein (Rb) ( 45 ) and histone deacetylases HDAC1/2 in NuRD complex that mediates histone deacetylation and ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling ( 46 ).

As seen with purified RHA and topoisomerase IIα, RHA in complex may stimulate the relaxation reaction either by facilitating the access of topoisomerase IIα to chromatin DNA or by directly binding to chromatin DNA. If complexed RHA and topoisomerase IIα function in a concerted manner, the affected chromatin region may undergo a significant topological alteration due to the reduction in superhelicity. Mechanistically a similar mode of action has been proposed to explain the stimulatory function of topoisomerase IIα in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription on chromatin template ( 46 ). Interestingly, chromatin-dependent transcription is activated when topoisomerase IIα is provided during but not after chromatin assembly ( 46 ). This observation suggests that additional factors may be required for the interaction of topoisomerase IIα with nucleosomal DNA. If the access of topoisomerase IIα to chromatin is facilitated by complexed RHA, it can be predicted that, unlike topoisomerase IIα alone, the RHA–topoisomerase IIα complexes will activate RNA polymersae II-mediated transcription on pre-assembled chromatin template. Moreover, the DNA, once isolated post-transcriptionally, would be highly underwound if RHA–topoisomerase II complexes, operating in front of the transcription machinery, remove the positive supercoiling generated downstream of transcription site as a result of the movement of RNA polymerase II.

Several transcription factors such as ATF-2, CREB, c-Jun and p53 bind and stimulate the catalytic activity of topoisomerase IIα ( 47 , 48 ). In addition, there is increasing evidence indicating the conjoined function of topoisomerases and helicases. The RecQ family of asp-glu-x-his (DExH) DNA helicases act in concert with topoisomerase III ( 49 ). The interactions between two mammalian RecQ-like helicases, Bloom’s syndrome gene product (BLM) and Werner’s syndrome gene product (WRN), and topoisomerase III ( 50 , 51 ) suggest the conserved conjoined function of RecQ helicases and type I topoisomerases in eukaryotic species. Our observations show that RHA functionally and physically interacts with topoisomerase IIα, which suggests that a concerted function might be more general among topoisomerases and helicases. Quantitative isolation and thorough identification of RHA–topoisomerase IIα complex is underway in an effort to define their biochemical and biological functions in more detail.
