OBJECTIVE: To identify the genetic cause of axonal hereditary motor and sensory 
neuropathy (HMSN2) with infrequent giant axons.
METHODS: We studied 11 members of a previously described HMSN2 family with 
infrequent giant axons and variable cardiomyopathy. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) 
was performed on 2 affected persons and 1 unaffected person. Sanger sequencing 
was utilized to confirm the identified novel variant tracking with the affected 
status. Linkage analysis and haplotype mapping were obtained to confirm the 
causal nature of the identified variant. Cotransfection of HEK293 cells and 
co-immunoprecipitation assay were performed to assess the impact of the 
identified mutant protein in the implicated ubiquitin ligase pathway.
RESULTS: Giant axons with neurofilament accumulations were found in 3 affected 
persons who had undergone nerve biopsy evaluations. Six novel variants were 
identified by WES, but only DCAF8 p.R317C tracked with affected status within 
the family. Linkage and haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers 
supported this variant as causal. The mutation is within the DCAF8 WD repeat 
region critical for its binding to DDB1. Functional analysis shows DCAF8 p.R317C 
reduces the association of DCAF8 and DDB1, which is important in Cul4-ubiquitin 
E3 function.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that DCAF8 p.R317C mutation is responsible for 
this specific variety of HMSN2 with infrequent giant axons and mild 
cardiomyopathy. This mutation results in decreased DDB1-DCAF8 association, 
leading to an E3 ubiquitin ligase defect that is likely associated with 
neurofilament degradation.
