Endothelin (ET) synthesis is enhanced at sites of ischemia or in injured 
vessels. The purpose of this study was to explore the possibility of autocrine 
stimulation of endothelial cell migration by members of the endothelin family. 
Experiments with microvascular endothelial cell transmigration in a Boyden 
chemotactic apparatus showed that endothelins 1 and 3, as well as a selective 
agonist of ETB receptor IRL-1620, equipotently stimulated migration. Endothelial 
cell migration was unaffected by the blockade of ETA receptor, but it was 
inhibited by ETB receptor antagonism. Based on our previous demonstration of 
signaling from the occupied ETB receptor to constitutive nitric oxide (NO) 
synthase (Tsukahara, H., Ende, H., Magazine, H. I., Bahou, W. F., and 
Goligorsky, M. S. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 21778-21785), we next examined the 
contribution of ET-stimulated NO production to endothelial cell migration. In 
three independent cellular systems, 1) migration and wound healing by 
microvascular endothelial cells, 2) wound healing by Chinese hamster ovary cells 
stably expressing ETB receptor with or without endothelial NO synthase, and 3) 
application of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting endothelial NO synthase 
in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, an absolute requirement for the 
functional NO synthase in cell migration has been demonstrated. These findings 
establish the permissive role of NO synthesis in endothelin-stimulated migration 
of endothelial cells.
