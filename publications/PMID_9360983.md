Integrin-ligand binding induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins 
including focal adhesion kinase (pp125(FAK)) and Crk-associated substrate (Cas). 
FAK is activated and autophosphorylated by the ligation of integrins, although 
the substrate of FAK has not been revealed. We show here that p130(Cas) and 
Cas-L are FAK substrates. FAK directly phosphorylates Cas proteins primarily at 
the YDYVHL sequence that is conserved among all Cas proteins. Furthermore, the 
phosphorylated YDYVHL sequence is a binding site for Src family protein-tyrosine 
kinases, and the recruited Src family kinase phosphorylates the other tyrosine 
residues within Cas. The Cas-L YDYVHL sequence is phosphorylated upon 
integrin-ligand binding, and this integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation is 
inhibited by the cotransfection of the FAK COOH-terminal domain that does not 
contain a kinase domain. These findings strongly suggest that FAK initiates 
integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas proteins; then, Src family 
tyrosine kinases, which are recruited to phosphorylated Cas and FAK, further 
phosphorylate Cas proteins.
