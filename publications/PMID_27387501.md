Abstract

Interferon signaling plays important roles in both intestinal homeostasis and in the host response to pathogen infection. The extent to which bacterial pathogens inhibit this host pathway is an understudied area of investigation. We characterized Citrobacter rodentium strains bearing deletions in individual type III secretion system effector genes to determine whether this pathogen inhibits the host type I IFN response and which effector is responsible. The NleB effector limited host IFN-β production by inhibiting Lys 63 -linked ubiquitination of TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3). Inhibition was dependent on the glycosyltransferase activity of NleB. GAPDH, a target of NleB during infection, bound to TRAF3 and was required for maximal TRAF3 ubiquitination. NleB glycosyltransferase activity inhibited GAPDH-TRAF3 binding, resulting in reduced TRAF3 ubiquitination. Collectively, our data reveal important interplay between GAPDH and TRAF3 and suggest a mechanism by which the NleB effector inhibits type I IFN signaling.

Introduction

Many bacterial pathogens utilize a type III secretion system (T3SS) 2 to inject virulence proteins (effectors) into host cells to subvert various host functions ( 1 ). Characterizing the identity and mechanism of bacterial effectors expressed by attaching/effacing pathogens, which include enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and Citrobacter rodentium , has been a subject of extensive research in recent years ( 2 ). Effector subversion of host pathways regulated by the transcription factor NF-κB has been relatively well studied ( 3 ), but less attention has been given to the potential inhibition of host interferon signaling, which also functions as an important early mediator of host defense.

Virally infected cells secrete interferon to protect other cells from subsequent infection ( 4 ). Type I IFNs ( e.g. IFN-α and IFN-β) bind to a common IFN-α/β receptor ( 5 ), initiating a signal transduction cascade that ultimately induces the transcription of genes with promoters containing IFN-stimulated response elements ( 6 ). Type I IFNs induce antiviral activity via double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase and 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase to promote viral mRNA degradation and inhibit translation, respectively ( 7 ).

Type I IFN production is stimulated not only by viral infection but also by bacterial components, including LPS and flagellin ( 8 ). LPS binding to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) induces a type I IFN response mediated by the TRIF-related adaptor molecule and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β adaptor proteins ( 9 ). TRIF-related adaptor molecule-TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β signaling results in the activation of TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator-binding kinase (TBK1) and inducible IκB kinase (IKKϵ ( 10 )). Serine phosphorylation of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is mediated by TBK1/IKKϵ to induce IRF3 dimerization and nuclear translocation ( 11 ). Phosphorylated IRF3 (and IRF7) dimers then associate with AP-1, high-mobility group proteins, and NF-κB to form an IFN-β enhanceasome ( 12 ).

IFNs are important for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and for responding to pathogen infection ( 13 ). Accordingly, pathogens have also evolved strategies to interfere with host type I IFN signaling. For example, the anthrax lethal factor inhibits host IFN production by cleaving MAPKK6 ( 14 ) and by inhibiting STAT1 and ISGF3 activation ( 15 ). The deubiquitinating protease activity of Yersinia YopJ blocks TLR induction of type I IFN at the level of TAK1 activation by inhibiting TRAF3/6 ubiquitination ( 16 ). Vaccinia virus protein K7 prevents IRF3 activation by inhibiting the interaction between DEAD box protein 3 and IKKϵ ( 17 ). The Ebola virus VP35 protein blocks TBK1/IKKϵ interaction with IRF3/7 ( 18 ).

A recent study found that IFN-β is induced by EPEC infection and that the T3SS effector NleD both inhibits IFN-β induction and enhances TNF expression to promote barrier disruption ( 19 ). However, whether C. rodentium T3SS effectors may also inhibit host IFN-β induction is unclear. Here, we screened C. rodentium strains bearing deletions in individual effector genes to determine the extent to which this pathogen might inhibit the host IFN-β response. We found that the T3SS effector NleB limits host IFN-β production by inhibiting TRAF3 Lys 63 -linked ubiquitination.

Discussion

NleB is a translocated glycosyltransferase enzyme that was originally studied for its ability to suppress NF-κB activation ( 26 , 27 ). We found previously that NleB disrupts TRAF2 signaling by modifying GAPDH with GlcNAc and preventing GAPDH from binding to and activating TRAF2 ( 25 ). The EPEC NleB1 effector modifies arginine residues of host proteins ( N -GlcNAcylation) rather than the more typical targeting of serine/threonine residues ( O -GlcNAcylation ( 28 , 29 )). In particular, it was found that EPEC NleB1 glycosylates the death domains of TRADD, FADD, RIPK1, and TNFR1, blocking the assembly of the TNFR1 complex. This N -GlcNAcylation disrupts TNF signaling in EPEC-infected cells, thus impacting NF-κB activation, apoptosis, and necroptosis ( 28 , 29 ). A recent paper defined numerous amino acids that are important to the N -GlcNAcylation of FADD by EPEC NleB1 and also used the C. rodentium infection model to show the role of these amino acids in virulence ( 30 ). To date, the studies that have evaluated the arginine-GlcNAcylation of substrates by NleB orthologs have only described a single addition site for each protein. This modification occurs on Arg 117 in FADD ( 29 ) and on Arg 235 in TRADD ( 28 ). Labeling of an arginine residue by NleB1 was also detected for TNFR1 and RIPK1 ( 28 ). It is conceivable that some NleB orthologs could label other substrates, including GAPDH, on single or multiple arginine residues, a topic we are investigating in ongoing studies.

Here we observed an additional role of C. rodentium NleB affecting type I IFN signaling by inhibiting Lys 63 -linked TRAF3 ubiquitination. EPEC suppresses type I IFN production using the T3SS effector NleD ( 19 ), which we did not observe in our screening of C. rodentium mutants. We used the VSV-G/GFP system as the readout for type I IFN production, in which VSV replication is very sensitive to type I IFN secreted from bacterially infected cells. By contrast, Long et al. ( 19 ) measured IFN-β mRNA levels in Caco2 cells 3 h after EPEC infection. Because the expression of innate immunity genes is dynamic, mRNA levels assayed at a single time point might not fully reflect type I IFN production during bacterial infection. Additionally, the activities of the EHEC, EPEC, and C. rodentium NleB proteins may be functionally distinct ( 25 , 28 , 29 ).

TRAF3, a ubiquitin ligase, together with TRAF6, are recruited by the mitochondrion adaptor mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein to activate the non-canonical IKK-related kinase TBK1 with various adaptor proteins, including TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator, NAP1, and NF-κB essential modulator. The TBK1 complex induces the phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF3, which is required for IRF3 nuclear translocation. IRF3 is a master transcriptional regulator of type I IFN gene expression. TLR4 activation induces Lys 63 -linked TRAF3 ubiquitination, which is required for IRF3 activation.

GAPDH is a stress sensor involved in many biological processes, including immune signaling and apoptosis ( 31 ). We showed that the interaction between GAPDH and TRAF2 is enhanced by TNF and is required for maximal NF-κB activation after TNF stimulation ( 25 ). Here we found that GAPDH also interacts with TRAF3 and enhances TRAF3 Lys 63 -linked ubiquitination. Given that TRAF family members are widely involved in mammalian immune signaling pathways, our data suggest that GAPDH may have an unappreciated role in regulating the immune system. There are six distinct TRAF proteins in mammals, each containing a ring finger domain (except TRAF1), a zinc finger motif, an amino-terminal TRAF domain, and a carboxy-terminal TRAF domain (TRAF-C). TRAF-C is highly conserved among all TRAFs and is responsible for the association of TRAFs with other proteins. It will be interesting to investigate whether GAPDH interacts with other TRAFs under different conditions.

NleB inhibited the TRAF3 and GAPDH interaction by modifying GAPDH with GlcNAc. Other studies have shown that EPEC NleB1 glycosylates the death domains of TRADD, FADD, and other death domain-containing proteins ( 28 , 29 ). Although these results are able to explain NleB function in the TNF/NF-κB signaling pathway, they fail to explain the function of NleB in the TLR4/type I IFN pathway we report here. The role of GAPDH in T cell activation has been described recently ( 32 ). GAPDH functions as a “switcher” of T cell activation by binding to AU-rich elements within the 3′ UTR of IFN-γ mRNA to suppress the translation of IFN-γ ( 32 ). Therefore, selective targeting of GAPDH might provide an interesting framework with which to understand the multiple effects of NleB on immune signaling pathways. Overall, our data suggest that C. rodentium NleB affects both NF-κB and interferon signaling.
