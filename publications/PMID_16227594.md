Candida albicans possesses a plasma membrane-localized sensor of extracellular 
amino acids. Here, we show that in response to amino acids, this sensor induces 
the proteolytic processing of two latent transcription factors, Stp1 and Stp2. 
Processing removes negative regulatory motifs present in the N-terminal domains 
of these factors. Strikingly, Stp1 and Stp2 exhibit a clear dichotomy in the 
genes they transactivate. The shorter active form of Stp2 activates genes 
required for amino acid uptake. The processed form of Stp1 activates genes 
required for degradation of extracellular protein and uptake of peptides, and 
cells lacking Stp1 do not express the secreted aspartyl protease SAP2 or the 
oligopeptide transporter OPT1. Consequently, stp1 null mutants are unable to 
grow on media with protein as the sole nitrogen source. Cells expressing the 
STP1* allele that encodes a protein lacking the inhibitory N-terminal domain 
constitutively express SAP2 and OPT1 even in the absence of extracellular 
proteins or peptides. Also, we show that Stp1 levels, but not Stp2 levels, are 
downregulated in the presence of millimolar concentrations of extracellular 
amino acids. These results define the hierarchy of regulatory mechanisms that 
differentially control two discrete pathways for the assimilation of nitrogen.
