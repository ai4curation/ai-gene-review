Immunohistochemical data on 10 of the 14 small heat-shock (smHSPs) proteins in 
fourth larval stage and adult Caenorhabditis elegans show that the tissues 
expressing the greatest number of smHSPs are vulva (HSP12s, HSP43 and, under 
stress, HSP16s) and spermatheca (HSP12s, HSP25, HSP43 and, under stress, 
HSP16s). HSP43 is also expressed in male tail structures, and following 
heat-shock HSP16s are expressed in spermatids and spermatozoa.
