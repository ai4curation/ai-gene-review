PURPOSE: To analyze the occurrence of promoter hypermethylation in primary 
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) on a genome-wide scale, focusing on epigenetic 
alterations with pathogenetic significance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA isolated from biopsy specimens of 28 patients with 
CTCL, including aggressive CTCL entities (transformed mycosis fungoides and 
CD30-negative large T-cell lymphoma) and an indolent entity (CD30-positive large 
T-cell lymphoma), were investigated. For genome-wide DNA methylation screening, 
differential methylation hybridization using CpG island microarrays was applied, 
which allows simultaneous detection of the methylation status of 8640 CpG 
islands. Bisulfite sequence analysis was applied for confirmation and detection 
of hypermethylation of eight selected tumor suppressor genes.
RESULTS: The DNA methylation patterns of CTCLs emerging from differential 
methylation hybridization analysis included 35 CpG islands hypermethylated in at 
least four of the 28 studied CTCL samples when compared with benign T-cell 
samples. Hypermethylation of the putative tumor suppressor genes BCL7a (in 48% 
of CTCL samples), PTPRG (27%), and thrombospondin 4 (52%) was confirmed and 
demonstrated to be associated with transcriptional downregulation. BCL7a was 
hypermethylated at a higher frequency in aggressive (64%) than in indolent (14%) 
CTCL entities. In addition, the promoters of the selected tumor suppressor genes 
p73 (48%), p16 (33%), CHFR (19%), p15 (10%), and TMS1 (10%) were hypermethylated 
in CTCL.
CONCLUSION: Malignant T cells of patients with CTCL display widespread promoter 
hypermethylation associated with inactivation of several tumor suppressor genes 
involved in DNA repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis signaling pathways. In view of 
this, CTCL may be amenable to treatment with demethylating agents.
