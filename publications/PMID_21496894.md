Cytosine methylation is the major covalent modification of mammalian genomic DNA 
and plays important roles in transcriptional regulation. The molecular mechanism 
underlying the enzymatic removal of this epigenetic mark, however, remains 
elusive. Here, we show that 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylase TET1, by 
converting 5mCs to 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmCs), promotes DNA demethylation 
in mammalian cells through a process that requires the base excision repair 
pathway. Though expression of the 12 known human DNA glycosylases individually 
did not enhance removal of 5hmCs in mammalian cells, demethylation of both 
exogenously introduced and endogenous 5hmCs is promoted by the AID 
(activation-induced deaminase)/APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme 
complex) family of cytidine deaminases. Furthermore, Tet1 and Apobec1 are 
involved in neuronal activity-induced, region-specific, active DNA demethylation 
and subsequent gene expression in the dentate gyrus of the adult mouse brain in 
vivo. Our study suggests a TET1-induced oxidation-deamination mechanism for 
active DNA demethylation in mammals.
