SARM1 (sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1) is responsible for depletion of 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in its oxidized form (NAD+) during Wallerian 
degeneration associated with neuropathies. Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich 
repeat (NLR) immune receptors recognize pathogen effector proteins and trigger 
localized cell death to restrict pathogen infection. Both processes depend on 
closely related Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains in these proteins, 
which, as we show, feature self-association-dependent NAD+ cleavage activity 
associated with cell death signaling. We further show that SARM1 SAM (sterile 
alpha motif) domains form an octamer essential for axon degeneration that 
contributes to TIR domain enzymatic activity. The crystal structures of ribose 
and NADP+ (the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) 
complexes of SARM1 and plant NLR RUN1 TIR domains, respectively, reveal a 
conserved substrate binding site. NAD+ cleavage by TIR domains is therefore a 
conserved feature of animal and plant cell death signaling pathways.
