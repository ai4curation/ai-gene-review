The Aurora B kinase is the enzymatic core of the chromosomal passenger complex, 
which is a critical regulator of mitosis. To identify novel regulators of Aurora 
B, we performed a genome-wide screen for suppressors of a temperature-sensitive 
lethal allele of the C. elegans Aurora B kinase AIR-2. This screen uncovered a 
member of the Afg2/Spaf subfamily of Cdc48-like AAA ATPases as an essential 
inhibitor of AIR-2 stability and activity. Depletion of CDC-48.3 restores 
viability to air-2 mutant embryos and leads to abnormally high AIR-2 levels at 
the late telophase/G1 transition. Furthermore, CDC-48.3 binds directly to AIR-2 
and inhibits its kinase activity from metaphase through telophase. While 
canonical p97/Cdc48 proteins have been assigned contradictory roles in the 
regulation of Aurora B, our results identify a member of the Afg2/Spaf AAA 
ATPases as a critical in vivo inhibitor of this kinase during embryonic 
development.
