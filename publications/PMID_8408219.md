A novel microtubule-associated protein (MAP) of M(r) 115,000 has been identified 
by screening of a HeLa cell cDNA expression library with an anti-serum raised 
against microtubule-binding proteins from HeLa cells. Monoclonal and 
affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies were generated for the further 
characterization of this MAP. It is different from the microtubule-binding 
proteins of similar molecular weights, characterized so far, by its 
nucleotide-insensitive binding to microtubules and different sedimentation 
behavior. Since it is predominantly expressed in cells of epithelial origin 
(Caco-2, HeLa, MDCK), and rare (human skin, A72) or not detectable (Vero) in 
fibroblastic cells, we name it E-MAP-115 (epithelial MAP of 115 kD). In HeLa 
cells, E-MAP-115 is preferentially associated with subdomains or subsets of 
perinuclear microtubules. In Caco-2 cells, labeling for E-MAP-115 increases when 
they polarize and form blisters. The molecular characterization of E-MAP-115 
reveals that it is a novel protein with no significant homologies to other known 
proteins. The secondary structure predicted from its sequence indicates two 
domains connected by a putative hinge region rich in proline and alanine (PAPA 
region). E-MAP-115 has two highly charged regions with predicted alpha-helical 
structure, one basic with a pI of 10.9 in the NH2-terminal domain and one 
neutral with a pI of 7.6 immediately following the PAPA region in the acidic 
COOH-terminal half of the molecule. A novel microtubule-binding site has been 
localized to the basic alpha-helical region in the NH2-terminal domain using in 
vitro microtubule-binding assays and expression of mutant polypeptides in vivo. 
Overexpression of this domain of E-MAP-115 by transfection of fibroblasts 
lacking significant levels of this protein with its cDNA renders microtubules 
stable to nocodazole. We conclude that E-MAP-115 is a microtubule-stabilizing 
protein that may play an important role during reorganization of microtubules 
during polarization and differentiation of epithelial cells.
