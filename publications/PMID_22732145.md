Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation is negatively regulated by 
protein kinase C (PKC) signaling. Stimulation of A431 cells with EGF, bradykinin 
or UTP increased EGFR phosphorylation at Thr654 in a PKC-dependent manner. 
Inhibition of PKC signaling enhanced EGFR activation, as assessed by increased 
phosphorylation of Tyr845 and Tyr1068 residues of the EGFR. Diacylglycerol is a 
physiological activator of PKC that can be removed by diacylglycerol kinase 
(DGK) activity. We found, in A431 and HEK293 cells, that the DGKθ isozyme 
translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where it co-localized with 
the EGFR and subsequently moved into EGFR-containing intracellular vesicles. 
This translocation was dependent on both activation of EGFR and PKC signaling. 
Furthermore, DGKθ physically interacted with the EGFR and became 
tyrosine-phosphorylated upon EGFR stimulation. Overexpression of DGKθ attenuated 
the bradykinin-stimulated, PKC-mediated EGFR phosphorylation at Thr654, and 
enhanced the phosphorylation at Tyr845 and Tyr1068. SiRNA-induced DGKθ 
downregulation enhanced this PKC-mediated Thr654 phosphorylation. Our data 
indicate that DGKθ translocation and activity is regulated by the concerted 
activity of EGFR and PKC and that DGKθ attenuates PKC-mediated Thr654 
phosphorylation that is linked to desensitisation of EGFR signaling.
