Insulin inhibits the expression of multiple genes in the liver containing an 
insulin response sequence (IRS) (CAAAA(C/T)AA), and we have reported that 
protein kinase B (PKB) mediates this effect of insulin. Genetic studies in 
Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that daf-16, a forkhead/winged-helix 
transcription factor, is a major target of the insulin receptor-PKB signaling 
pathway. FKHR, a human homologue of daf-16, contains three PKB sites and is 
expressed in the liver. Reporter gene studies in HepG2 hepatoma cells show that 
FKHR stimulates insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 promoter activity 
through an IRS, and introduction of IRSs confers this effect on a heterologous 
promoter. Insulin disrupts IRS-dependent transactivation by FKHR, and 
phosphorylation of Ser-256 by PKB is necessary and sufficient to mediate this 
effect. Antisense studies indicate that FKHR contributes to basal promoter 
function and is required to mediate effects of insulin and PKB on promoter 
activity via an IRS. To our knowledge, these results provide the first report 
that FKHR stimulates promoter activity through an IRS and that phosphorylation 
of FKHR by PKB mediates effects of insulin on gene expression. Signaling to 
FKHR-related forkhead proteins via PKB may provide an evolutionarily conserved 
mechanism by which insulin and related factors regulate gene expression.
