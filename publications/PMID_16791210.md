We examined cell cycle-dependent changes in the proteome of human cells by 
systematically measuring protein dynamics in individual living cells. We used 
time-lapse microscopy to measure the dynamics of a random subset of 20 nuclear 
proteins, each tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) at its endogenous 
chromosomal location. We synchronized the cells in silico by aligning protein 
dynamics in each cell between consecutive divisions. We observed widespread 
(40%) cell-cycle dependence of nuclear protein levels and detected previously 
unknown cell cycle-dependent localization changes. This approach to dynamic 
proteomics can aid in discovery and accurate quantification of the extensive 
regulation of protein concentration and localization in individual living cells.
