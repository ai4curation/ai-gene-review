XPG is a structure-specific endonuclease required for nucleotide excision 
repair, and incision-defective XPG mutations cause the skin cancer-prone 
syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum. Truncating mutations instead cause the 
neurodevelopmental progeroid disorder Cockayne syndrome, but little is known 
about how XPG loss results in this devastating disease. We identify XPG as a 
partner of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in maintaining genomic stability through homologous 
recombination (HRR). XPG depletion causes DNA double-strand breaks, chromosomal 
abnormalities, cell-cycle delays, defective HRR, inability to overcome 
replication fork stalling, and replication stress. XPG directly interacts with 
BRCA2, RAD51, and PALB2, and XPG depletion reduces their chromatin binding and 
subsequent RAD51 foci formation. Upstream in HRR, XPG interacts directly with 
BRCA1. Its depletion causes BRCA1 hyper-phosphorylation and persistent chromatin 
binding. These unexpected findings establish XPG as an HRR protein with 
important roles in genome stability and suggest how XPG defects produce severe 
clinical consequences including cancer and accelerated aging.
