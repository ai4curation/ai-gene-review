Endosomal acidification and transport are essential functions in signal 
transduction. Recent data suggest that Wnt signaling requires intact endosomal 
transport machinery but the effects of endosomal acidification on Wnt signal 
transduction have not been evaluated. Here we report that bafilomycin, a 
specific inhibitor of the vacuolar proton ATPase that blocks endosomal 
acidification, inhibits canonical Wnt signal transduction initiated by Wnt 
ligand and partially inhibits signaling initiated by disheveled. Bafilomycin 
does not affect Tcf promoter activation by beta-catenin. These data indicate 
that endosomal acidification is necessary for Wnt signaling. To identify 
interactions between endosomal transport proteins and Wnt receptors, we 
performed a GST fusion protein pulldown experiment and identified a possible 
indirect interaction between the LRP6 intracellular domain and vacuolar protein 
sorting protein 35 (VPS35). We show that an N-terminal deletion mutant of VPS35 
reduces canonical Wnt signaling in HEK-293 cells expressing exogenous Wnt-1. 
These data suggest that endosomal V-type ATPase activity and retromer 
trafficking proteins are functionally important in Wnt signal transduction.
