Comparison of S100b protein with calmodulin: interactions with melittin and 
microtubule-associated tau proteins and inhibition of phosphorylation of tau 
proteins by protein kinase C.

To gauge similarities between S100b protein and calmodulin, interactions were 
observed between S100b and melittin and between S100b and tau, the 
microtubule-associated proteins. The interaction of melittin with S100b protein 
in the presence and absence of calcium was studied by fluorescence polarization, 
UV difference spectroscopy, and sulfhydryl derivatization. Whether calcium was 
present or not in the solution, melittin and S100b form a complex of molar 
ratios up to 2:1. Further binding of melittin occurred, but it resulted in 
precipitation of S100b, as is true of the corresponding case of melittin binding 
to calmodulin. In the absence of calcium, the interaction of melittin and S100b 
shielded the tryptophan (Trp) of the former protein and exposed cysteine-84 beta 
(Cys-84 beta) of the latter protein, leaving the tyrosine-16 beta (Tyr-16 beta) 
of S100b unaffected. Calcium addition to the complex partially restored the 
exposure of Trp of melittin and caused changes in the environment of Tyr-16 beta 
(unlike the environmental changes induced for Tyr-16 beta by calcium in the 
absence of melittin). The conformational changes induced in S100b by interaction 
with melittin increased its affinity for calcium and offset the inhibition of 
calcium binding otherwise observed in the presence of potassium ions. This 
corroborated the previous finding that S100b affinity for calcium greatly 
depends on the protein conformation. The phenomena described above are similar 
to the interactions of melittin with calmodulin and thus suggest that S100b and 
calmodulin have a common structural domain not only that binds melittin but also 
that may interact with common target proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
