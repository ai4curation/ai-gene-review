Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has been identified by genome-wide 
association studies as being encoded by a major susceptibility gene for Crohn's 
disease. Here we found that LRRK2 deficiency conferred enhanced susceptibility 
to experimental colitis in mice. Mechanistic studies showed that LRRK2 was a 
potent negative regulator of the transcription factor NFAT and was a component 
of a complex that included the large noncoding RNA NRON (an NFAT repressor). 
Furthermore, the risk-associated allele encoding LRRK2 Met2397 identified by a 
genome-wide association study for Crohn's disease resulted in less LRRK2 protein 
post-translationally. Severe colitis in LRRK2-deficient mice was associated with 
enhanced nuclear localization of NFAT1. Thus, our study defines a new step in 
the control of NFAT activation that involves an immunoregulatory function of 
LRRK2 and has important implications for inflammatory bowel disease.
