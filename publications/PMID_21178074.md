The multidomain homotetrameric tumor suppressor p53 has two modes of binding 
dsDNA that are thought to be responsible for scanning and recognizing specific 
response elements (REs). The C termini bind nonspecifically to dsDNA. The four 
DNA-binding domains (DBDs) bind REs that have two symmetric 10 base-pair 
sequences. p53 bound to a 20-bp RE has the DBDs enveloping the DNA, which is in 
the center of the molecule surrounded by linker sequences to the tetramerization 
domain (Tet). We investigated by electron microscopy structures of p53 bound to 
DNA sequences consisting of a 20-bp RE with either 12 or 20 bp nonspecific 
extensions on either end. We found a variety of structures that give clues to 
recognition and scanning mechanisms. The 44- and 60-bp sequences gave rise to 
three and four classes of structures, respectively. One was similar to the known 
20-bp structure, but the DBDs in the other classes were loosely arranged and 
incompatible with specific DNA recognition. Some of the complexes had density 
consistent with the C termini extending from Tet to the DNA, adjacent to the 
DBDs. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments 
detected the approach of the C termini towards the DBDs on addition of DNA. The 
structural data are consistent with p53 sliding along DNA via its C termini and 
the DNA-binding domains hopping on and off during searches for REs. The loose 
structures and posttranslational modifications account for the affinity of 
nonspecific DNA for p53 and point to a mechanism of enhancement of specificity 
by its binding to effector proteins.

Abstract

The multidomain homotetrameric tumor suppressor p53 has two modes of binding dsDNA that are thought to be responsible for scanning and recognizing specific response elements (REs). The C termini bind nonspecifically to dsDNA. The four DNA-binding domains (DBDs) bind REs that have two symmetric 10 base-pair sequences. p53 bound to a 20-bp RE has the DBDs enveloping the DNA, which is in the center of the molecule surrounded by linker sequences to the tetramerization domain (Tet). We investigated by electron microscopy structures of p53 bound to DNA sequences consisting of a 20-bp RE with either 12 or 20 bp nonspecific extensions on either end. We found a variety of structures that give clues to recognition and scanning mechanisms. The 44- and 60-bp sequences gave rise to three and four classes of structures, respectively. One was similar to the known 20-bp structure, but the DBDs in the other classes were loosely arranged and incompatible with specific DNA recognition. Some of the complexes had density consistent with the C termini extending from Tet to the DNA, adjacent to the DBDs. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments detected the approach of the C termini towards the DBDs on addition of DNA. The structural data are consistent with p53 sliding along DNA via its C termini and the DNA-binding domains hopping on and off during searches for REs. The loose structures and posttranslational modifications account for the affinity of nonspecific DNA for p53 and point to a mechanism of enhancement of specificity by its binding to effector proteins.

Materials and Methods

A variant of human p53 (1–393) carrying four mutations (M133L/V203A/N239Y/N268D) in the DNA-binding domain was expressed and purified as described previously ( 42 ). For isolation of p53 tetramers bound to DNA, solutions containing p53 at a concentration of 23 μM and the DNA probe at 30 μM were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and then stored on ice. The reactions were performed in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol (vol/vol). The DNA probes were preannealed and contained the response element for gene GADD45 flanked by random nonspecific sequences. Tetramers of p53 bound to DNA were isolated using GraFix methodology ( 29 ). Selected fractions were adsorbed on carbon coated grids and stained with uranyl formate in double carbon sandwich. EM images were recorded on a 4 k × 4 k CCD resulting in a 2.1 Å final pixel size. Reference-based projection matching was performed in EMAN ( 43 ) using a previously obtained EM model for p53·DNA as a starting reference ( 26 ). Nonsupervised three-dimensional classification of the images for p53·DNA complexes was performed by the maximum-likelihood based method ( 32 ). Resolutions for the EM maps were calculated using cutoffs of 0.5 and in the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) and the estimated values were in the range of 24–30 Å. Atomic coordinates for DBD·DNA complex [pdb code: 2ATA; ( 19 )] and Tet domains [pdb code: 3SAK; ( 44 )] were fitted as rigid bodies in Chimera ( 45 ), which was also used to produce figures. SM-FRET experiments were carried out as described previously ( 37 ). In the gene encoding for the fragment p53CTC (94–393) of human p53 all the surface-exposed cysteines (124, 182, 229, 275, and 277) were mutated to alanine. Two cysteines were introduced at positions 292 and 371. Protein samples were labeled with Alexa fluor 546 and Alexa fluor 647 (Invitrogen, United Kingdom). 60-mer dsDNA, as used in EM studies, was used in single-molecule experiments.
