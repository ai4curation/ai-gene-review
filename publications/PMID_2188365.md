A heat shock protein gene, HSP104, was isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
and a deletion mutation was introduced into yeast cells. Mutant cells grew at 
the same rate as wild-type cells and died at the same rate when exposed directly 
to high temperatures. However, when given a mild pre-heat treatment, the mutant 
cells did not acquire tolerance to heat, as did wild-type cells. Transformation 
with the wild-type gene rescued the defect of mutant cells. The results 
demonstrate that a particular heat shock protein plays a critical role in cell 
survival at extreme temperatures.
