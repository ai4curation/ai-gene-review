Mercury resistant bacteria have developed a system of two enzymes (MerA and 
MerB), which allows them to efficiently detoxify both ionic and organomercurial 
compounds. The organomercurial lyase (MerB) catalyzes the protonolysis of the 
carbon-mercury bond resulting in the formation of ionic mercury and a reduced 
hydrocarbon. The ionic mercury [Hg(II)] is subsequently reduced to the less 
reactive elemental mercury [Hg(0)] by a specific mercuric reductase (MerA). To 
better understand MerB's unique enzymatic activity, we used nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structure of the free enzyme. MerB 
is characterized by a novel protein fold consisting of three noninteracting 
antiparallel beta-sheets surrounded by six alpha-helices. By comparing the NMR 
data of free MerB and the MerB/Hg/DTT complex, we identified a set of residues 
that likely define a Hg/DTT binding site. These residues cluster around two 
cysteines (C(96) and C(159)) that are crucial to MerB's catalytic activity. A 
detailed analysis of the structure revealed the presence of an extensive 
hydrophobic groove adjacent to this Hg/DTT binding site. This extensive 
hydrophobic groove has the potential to interact with the hydrocarbon moiety of 
a wide variety of substrates and may explain the broad substrate specificity of 
MerB.
