Bleach (HOCl) is a powerful oxidant that kills bacteria in part by causing 
protein aggregation. It inactivates ATP-dependent chaperones, rendering cellular 
proteins mostly dependent on holdases. Here we identified Escherichia coli CnoX 
(YbbN) as a folding factor that, when activated by bleach via chlorination, 
functions as an efficient holdase, protecting the substrates of the major 
folding systems GroEL/ES and DnaK/J/GrpE. Remarkably, CnoX uniquely combines 
this function with the ability to prevent the irreversible oxidation of its 
substrates. This dual activity makes CnoX the founding member of a family of 
proteins, the "chaperedoxins." Because CnoX displays a thioredoxin fold and a 
tetratricopeptide (TPR) domain, two structural motifs conserved in all 
organisms, this investigation sets the stage for the discovery of additional 
chaperedoxins in bacteria and eukaryotes that could cooperate with proteins from 
both the Hsp60 and Hsp70 families.
