We used a proteomic approach to identify phosphopeptide-binding modules 
mediating signal transduction events in the DNA damage response pathway. Using a 
library of partially degenerate phosphopeptides, we identified tandem BRCT 
(BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal) domains in PTIP (Pax transactivation 
domain-interacting protein) and in BRCA1 as phosphoserine- or 
phosphothreonine-specific binding modules that recognize substrates 
phosphorylated by the kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) and ATR 
(ataxia telangiectasia- and RAD3-related) in response to gamma-irradiation. PTIP 
tandem BRCT domains are responsible for phosphorylation-dependent protein 
localization into 53BP1- and phospho-H2AX (gamma-H2AX)-containing nuclear foci, 
a marker of DNA damage. These findings provide a molecular basis for BRCT domain 
function in the DNA damage response and may help to explain why the BRCA1 BRCT 
domain mutation Met1775 --> Arg, which fails to bind phosphopeptides, 
predisposes women to breast and ovarian cancer.
