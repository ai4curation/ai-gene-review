The XPF/ERCC1 heterodimer is a DNA structure-specific endonuclease that 
participates in nucleotide excision repair and homology-dependent recombination 
reactions, including DNA single strand annealing and gene targeting. Here we 
show that XPF/ERCC1 is stably associated with hRad52, a recombinational repair 
protein, in human cell-free extracts and that these factors interact directly 
via the N-terminal domain of hRad52 and the XPF protein. Complex formation 
between hRad52 and XPF/ERCC1 concomitantly stimulates the DNA structure-specific 
endonuclease activity of XPF/ERCC1 and attenuates the DNA strand annealing 
activity of hRad52. Our results reveal a novel role for hRad52 as a subunit of a 
DNA structure-specific endonuclease and are congruent with evidence implicating 
both hRad52 and XPF/ERCC1 in a number of homologous recombination reactions. We 
propose that the ternary complex of hRad52 and XPF/ERCC1 is the active species 
that processes recombination intermediates generated during the repair of DNA 
double strand breaks and in homology-dependent gene targeting events.
