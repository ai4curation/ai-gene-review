GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) is rate limiting in the provision of the cofactor 
tetrahydrobiopterin for biosynthesis of catecholamines and NO. We asked whether 
common genetic variation at GCH1 alters transmitter synthesis and predisposes to 
disease. Here we undertook a systematic search for polymorphisms in GCH1, then 
tested variants' contributions to NO and catecholamine release as well as 
autonomic function in twin pairs. Renal NO and neopterin excretions were 
significantly heritable, as were baroreceptor coupling (heart rate response to 
BP fluctuation) and pulse interval (1/heart rate). Common GCH1 variant C+243T in 
the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTRs) predicted NO excretion, as well as 
autonomic traits: baroreceptor coupling, maximum pulse interval, and pulse 
interval variability, though not catecholamine secretion. In individuals with 
the most extreme BP values in the population, C+243T affected both diastolic and 
systolic BP, principally in females. In functional studies, C+243T decreased 
reporter expression in transfected 3'-UTRs plasmids. We conclude that human NO 
secretion traits are heritable, displaying joint genetic determination with 
autonomic activity by functional polymorphism at GCH1. Our results document 
novel pathophysiological links between a key biosynthetic locus and NO 
metabolism and suggest new strategies for approaching the mechanism, diagnosis, 
and treatment of risk predictors for cardiovascular diseases such as 
hypertension.
