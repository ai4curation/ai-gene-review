Impaired clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) is a major pathogenic event for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Aβ depositions in brain parenchyma as senile plaques and along 
cerebrovasculature as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) are hallmarks of AD. A 
major pathway that mediates brain Aβ clearance is the cerebrovascular system 
where Aβ is eliminated through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or degraded by 
cerebrovascular cells along the interstitial fluid drainage pathway. An Aβ 
clearance receptor, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 
(LRP1), is abundantly expressed in cerebrovasculature, in particular in vascular 
smooth muscle cells. Previous studies have indicated a role of LRP1 in 
endothelial cells in transcytosing Aβ out of the brain across the BBB; however, 
whether this represents a significant pathway for brain Aβ clearance remains 
controversial. Here, we demonstrate that Aβ can be cleared locally in the 
cerebrovasculature by an LRP1-dependent endocytic pathway in smooth muscle 
cells. The uptake and degradation of both endogenous and exogenous Aβ were 
significantly reduced in LRP1-suppressed human brain vascular smooth muscle 
cells. Conditional deletion of Lrp1 in vascular smooth muscle cell in amyloid 
model APP/PS1 mice accelerated brain Aβ accumulation and exacerbated Aβ 
deposition as amyloid plaques and CAA without affecting Aβ production. Our 
results demonstrate that LRP1 is a major Aβ clearance receptor in cerebral 
vascular smooth muscle cell and a disturbance of this pathway contributes to Aβ 
accumulation. These studies establish critical functions of the 
cerebrovasculature system in Aβ metabolism and identify a new pathway involved 
in the pathogenesis of both AD and CAA.
