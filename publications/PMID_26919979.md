Correct duplication of stem cell genetic material and its appropriate 
segregation into daughter cells are requisites for tissue, organ and organism 
homeostasis. Disruption of stem cell genomic integrity can lead to developmental 
abnormalities and cancer. Roles of the Smc5/6 structural maintenance of 
chromosomes complex in pluripotent stem cell genome maintenance have not been 
investigated, despite its important roles in DNA synthesis, DNA repair and 
chromosome segregation as evaluated in other model systems. Using mouse 
embryonic stem cells (mESCs) with a conditional knockout allele of Smc5, we 
showed that Smc5 protein depletion resulted in destabilization of the Smc5/6 
complex, accumulation of cells in G2 phase of the cell cycle and apoptosis. 
Detailed assessment of mitotic mESCs revealed abnormal condensin distribution 
and perturbed chromosome segregation, accompanied by irregular spindle 
morphology, lagging chromosomes and DNA bridges. Mutation of Smc5 resulted in 
retention of Aurora B kinase and enrichment of condensin on chromosome arms. 
Furthermore, we observed reduced levels of Polo-like kinase 1 at kinetochores 
during mitosis. Our study reveals crucial requirements of the Smc5/6 complex 
during cell cycle progression and for stem cell genome maintenance.
