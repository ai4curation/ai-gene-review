Oxidative stress induces in endothelial cells a quick and transient coactivation 
of both stress-activated protein kinase-2/p38 and extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinases. We found that inhibiting the ERK 
pathway resulted, within 5 min of oxidative stress, in a misassembly of focal 
adhesions characterized by mislocalization of key proteins such as paxillin. The 
focal adhesion misassembly that followed ERK inhibition with the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD098059 
(2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone) or with a kinase negative mutant of ERK in the 
presence of H(2)O(2) resulted in a quick and intense membrane blebbing that was 
associated with important damage to the endothelium. We isolated by 
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis a PD098059-sensitive phosphoprotein of 38 
kDa that we identified, by mass spectrometry, as tropomyosin-1. In fact, 
H(2)O(2) induced a time-dependent phosphorylation of tropomyosin that was 
sensitive to inhibition by PD098059 and UO126 
(1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio]butanediane). Tropomyosin 
phosphorylation was also induced by expression of a constitutively activated 
form of MEK1 (MEK(CA)), which confirms that its phosphorylation resulted from 
the activation of ERK. In unstimulated cells, tropomyosin-1 was found diffuse in 
the cells, whereas it quickly colocalized with actin and stress fibers upon 
stimulation of ERK by H(2)O(2) or by expression of MEK(CA). We propose that 
phosphorylation of tropomyosin-1 downstream of ERK by contributing to formation 
of actin filaments increases cellular contractility and promotes the formation 
of focal adhesions. Incidentally, ML-7 
(1-[5iodonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl]homopiperazine, HCl), an inhibitor of cell 
contractility, inhibited phosphorylation of tropomyosin and blocked the 
formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, which also led to membrane 
blebbing in the presence of oxidative stress. Our finding that tropomyosin-1 is 
phosphorylated downstream of ERK, an event that modulates its interaction with 
actin, may lead to further understanding of the role of this protein in 
regulating cellular functions associated with cytoskeletal remodeling.
