Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is required for the generation of the tension-sensing 
3F3/2 kinetochore epitope and facilitates kinetochore localization of Mad2 and 
other spindle checkpoint proteins. Here, we investigate the mechanism by which 
Plk1 itself is recruited to kinetochores. We show that Plk1 binds to budding 
uninhibited by benzimidazole 1 (Bub1) in mitotic human cells. The Plk1-Bub1 
interaction requires the polo-box domain (PBD) of Plk1 and is enhanced by 
cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1)-mediated phosphorylation of Bub1 at T609. The 
PBD-dependent binding of Plk1 to Bub1 facilitates phosphorylation of Bub1 by 
Plk1 in vitro. Depletion of Bub1 in HeLa cells by RNA interference (RNAi) 
diminishes the kinetochore localization of Plk1. Ectopic expression of the 
wild-type Bub1, but not the Bub1-T609A mutant, in Bub1-RNAi cells restores the 
kinetochore localization of Plk1. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of 
Bub1 at T609 by Cdk1 creates a docking site for the PBD of Plk1 and facilitates 
the kinetochore recruitment of Plk1.
