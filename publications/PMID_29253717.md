Recent reports in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research suggest that alterations in 
microRNA (miRNA) expression are associated with disease pathology. Our previous 
studies suggest that A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) expression 
is important in AD and could be modulated by an extended regulatory region that 
includes the 3' untranslated region. In this study, we have investigated the 
role of trans-acting factors in ADAM10 gene regulation. Our study shows that 
miRNA-140-5p has enhanced expression in the AD postmortem brain hippocampus 
using high-throughput miRNA arrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction. Interestingly, we have also seen that miRNA-140-5p seed sequence is 
present on 3' untranslated region of both ADAM10 and its transcription factor 
SOX2. The specific interaction of miRNA-140-5p with both ADAM10 and SOX2 
signifies high regulatory importance of this miRNA in controlling ADAM10 
expression. Thus, this investigation unravels mechanisms underlying ADAM10 
downregulation by miR-140-5p and suggests that dysfunctional regulation of 
ADAM10 expression is exacerbated by AD-related neurotoxic effects. These 
findings underscore the importance of understanding the impact of trans-acting 
factors in the modulation of AD pathophysiology.
