Careful regulation of mRNA half-lives is a fundamental mechanism allowing cells 
to quickly respond to changing environmental conditions. The mRNA-binding Hu 
proteins are important for stabilization of short-lived mRNAs. Here we describe 
the identification and mechanistic characterization of the first 
low-molecular-weight inhibitors for Hu protein R (HuR) from microbial broths 
(Actinomyces sp.): dehydromutactin (1), MS-444 (2) and okicenone (3). These 
compounds interfere with HuR RNA binding, HuR trafficking, cytokine expression 
and T-cell activation. A mathematical and experimental analysis of the 
compounds' mode of action suggests that HuR homodimerizes before RNA binding and 
that the compounds interfere with the formation of HuR dimers. Our results 
demonstrate the chemical drugability of HuR; to our knowledge HuR is the first 
example of a drugable protein within the Hu family. MS-444, dehydromutactin and 
okicenone may become valuable tools for studying HuR function. An assessment of 
HuR inhibition as a central node in malignant processes might open up new 
conceptual routes toward combatting cancer.
