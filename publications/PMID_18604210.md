The inhibitory signaling of natural killer (NK) cells is crucial in the 
regulation of innate immune responses. Here we show that the association of 
KIR2DL1, an inhibitory receptor of NK cells, with beta-arrestin 2 mediated 
recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 to KIR2DL1 and 
facilitated 'downstream' inhibitory signaling. Consequently, the cytotoxicity of 
NK cells was higher in beta-arrestin 2-deficient mice but was inhibited in 
beta-arrestin 2-transgenic mice. Moreover, beta-arrestin 2-deficient mice were 
less susceptible than wild-type mice to mouse cytomegalovirus infection, an 
effect that was abolished by depletion of NK cells. Our findings identify a 
previously unknown mechanism by which the inhibitory signaling in NK cells is 
regulated.
