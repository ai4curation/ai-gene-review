Nucleotide sequence of the pbpA gene and characteristics of the deduced amino 
acid sequence of penicillin-binding protein 2 of Escherichia coli K12.

We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the pbpA gene encoding 
penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2 of Escherichia coli. The coding region for 
PBP 2 was 1899 base pairs in length and was preceded by a possible promoter 
sequence and two open reading frames. The primary structure of PBP 2, deduced 
from the nucleotide sequence, comprised 633 amino acid residues. The relative 
molecular mass was calculated to be 70867. The deduced sequence agreed with the 
NH2-terminal sequence of PBP 2 purified from membranes, suggesting that PBP 2 
has no signal peptide. The hydropathy profile suggested that the NH2-terminal 
hydrophobic region (a stretch of 25 non-ionic amino acids) may anchor PBP 2 in 
the cytoplasmic membrane as an ectoprotein. There were nine homologous segments 
in the amino acid sequence of PBP 2 when compared with PBP 3 of E. coli. The 
active-site serine residue of PBP 2 was predicted to be Ser-330. Around this 
putative active-site serine residue was found the conserved sequence of 
Ser-Xaa-Xaa-Lys, which has been identified in all of the other E. coli PBPs so 
far studied (PBPs 1A, 1B, 3, 5 and 6) and class A and class C beta-lactamases. 
In the higher-molecular-mass PBPs 1A, 1B, 2 and 3, Ser-Xaa-Xaa-Lys-Pro was 
conserved. In the putative peptidoglycan transpeptidase domain there were six 
amino acid residues, which are common only in the PBPs of higher molecular mass.
