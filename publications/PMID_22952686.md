Leucine-rich repeat kinase 1 and 2 (LRRK1 and LRRK2) are large multidomain 
proteins containing kinase, GTPase and multiple protein-protein interaction 
domains, but only mutations in LRRK2 are linked to familial Parkinson's disease 
(PD). Independent studies suggest that LRRK2 exists in the cell as a complex 
compatible with the size of a dimer. However, whether this complex is truly a 
homodimer or a heterologous complex formed by monomeric LRRK2 with other 
proteins has not been definitively proven due to the limitations in obtaining 
highly pure proteins suitable for structural characterization. Here, we used 
stable expression of LRRK1 and LRRK2 in HEK293T cell lines to produce 
recombinant LRRK1 and LRRK2 proteins of greater than 90% purity. Both purified 
LRRKs are folded, with a predominantly alpha-helical secondary structure and are 
capable of binding GTP with similar affinity. Furthermore, recombinant LRRK2 
exhibits robust autophosphorylation activity, phosphorylation of model peptides 
in vitro and ATP binding. In contrast, LRRK1 does not display significant 
autophosphorylation activity and fails to phosphorylate LRRK2 model substrates, 
although it does bind ATP. Using these biochemically validated proteins, we show 
that LRRK1 and LRRK2 are capable of forming homodimers as shown by 
single-particle transmission electron microscopy and immunogold labeling. These 
LRRK dimers display an elongated conformation with a mean particle size of 145 Å 
and 175 Å respectively, which is disrupted by addition of 6M guanidinium 
chloride. Immunogold staining revealed double-labeled particles also in the 
pathological LRRK2 mutant G2019S and artificial mutants disrupting GTPase and 
kinase activities, suggesting that point mutations do not hinder the dimeric 
conformation. Overall, our findings indicate for the first time that purified 
and active LRRK1 and LRRK2 can form dimers in their full-length conformation.
