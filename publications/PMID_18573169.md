The concerted interconnection between processes driving DNA synthesis, division 
septum formation and cell wall synthesis and remodelling in rapidly growing 
bacteria requires precise co-ordination by signalling mechanisms that are, for 
the most part, unknown. The YycG (sensor histidine kinase)-YycF (response 
regulator/transcription factor) two-component system of Bacillus subtilis 
controls the synthesis of enzymes and their inhibitors that function in cell 
wall remodelling and cell separation. Here it is shown that the YycG sensor 
histidine kinase is a component of the division septum in growing cells. RT-PCR 
quantification of YycF approximately PO(4)-regulated gene transcription, in wild 
type and FtsZ-depleted, septum-less cells, indicated that YycG kinase activity 
on YycF is dependent on YycG localization to a division septum. The data support 
a model in which the YycG sensor kinase perceives information at the division 
septum and regulates the reciprocal synthesis of autolysins and autolysin 
inhibitors to co-ordinate growth and division with cell wall restructuring.
