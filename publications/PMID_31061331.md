Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family members (ACSLs) are a family of enzymes 
that convert long-chain free fatty acids into their acyl-CoAs. ACSL4 is an ACSL 
isozyme with a strong preference for arachidonic acid (AA) and has been 
hypothesized to modulate the metabolic fates of AA. There are two ACSL4 splice 
variants: ACSL4V1, which is the more abundant transcript, and ACSL4V2, which is 
believed to be restricted to the brain. In the present study, we expressed 
recombinant human ACSL4V1 and V2 in Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cells using 
the baculovirus expression system and then partially purified both variants by 
cobalt affinity column chromatography. We then established a novel ACSL assay 
system with LC-MS/MS, which is highly sensitive and applicable to various kinds 
of fatty acids, and used it to investigate the substrate specificity of 
recombinant human ACSL4V1 and V2. The results showed that both ACSL4 variants 
preferred various kinds of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs), including 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), adrenic acid (docosatetraenoic acid) and 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as well as AA as a substrate. Moreover, our kinetic 
studies revealed that the two variants had similar relative affinities for AA, 
EPA and DHA but different reaction rates for each HUFA. These results confirmed 
the importance of both of ACSL4 variants in the maintenance of membrane 
phospholipids bearing HUFAs. Structural analysis of these variants might reveal 
the molecular mechanism by which they maintain membrane phospholipids bearing 
HUFAs.
