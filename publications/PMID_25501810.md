Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associated with 
Parkinson’s disease, but the precise physiological function of the protein 
remains ill-defined. Recently, our group proposed a model in which LRRK2 kinase 
activity is part of an EndoA phosphorylation cycle that facilitates efficient 
vesicle formation at synapses in the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular 
junctions.Flies harbor only one Lrrk gene, which might encompass the functions 
of both mammalian LRRK1 and LRRK2. We therefore studied the role of LRRK2 in 
mammalian synaptic function and provide evidence that knockout or 
pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 results in defects in synaptic vesicle 
endocytosis, altered synaptic morphology and impairments in neurotransmission. 
In addition, our data indicate that mammalian endophilin A1 (EndoA1,also known 
as SH3GL2) is phosphorylated by LRRK2 in vitro at T73 and S75, two residues in 
the BAR domain. Hence, our results indicate that LRRK2 kinase activity has an 
important role in the regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic 
vesicles and subsequent neurotransmission at the synapse.
