Tripartite motif protein 32 (TRIM32) mRNA has been reported to be highly 
expressed in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, but the involvement of 
TRIM32 in carcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we found 
by using yeast two-hybrid screening that TRIM32 binds to Abl-interactor 2 
(Abi2), which is known as a tumor suppressor and a cell migration inhibitor, and 
we showed that TRIM32 mediates the ubiquitination of Abi2. Overexpression of 
TRIM32 promoted degradation of Abi2, resulting in enhancement of cell growth, 
transforming activity, and cell motility, whereas a dominant-negative mutant of 
TRIM32 lacking the RING domain inhibited the degradation of Abi2. In addition, 
we found that TRIM32 suppresses apoptosis induced by 
cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) in HEp2 cell lines. These findings suggest 
that TRIM32 is a novel oncogene that promotes tumor growth, metastasis, and 
resistance to anticancer drugs.
