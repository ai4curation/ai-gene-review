To better define the function of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SSB1, an abundant 
single-stranded nucleic acid-binding protein, we determined the nucleotide 
sequence of the SSB1 gene and compared it with those of other proteins of known 
function. The amino acid sequence contains 293 amino acid residues and has an Mr 
of 32,853. There are several stretches of sequence characteristic of other 
eucaryotic single-stranded nucleic acid-binding proteins. At the amino terminus, 
residues 39 to 54 are highly homologous to a peptide in calf thymus UP1 and UP2 
and a human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein. Residues 125 to 162 
constitute a fivefold tandem repeat of the sequence RGGFRG, the composition of 
which suggests a nucleic acid-binding site. Near the C terminus, residues 233 to 
245 are homologous to several RNA-binding proteins. Of 18 C-terminal residues, 
10 are acidic, a characteristic of the procaryotic single-stranded DNA-binding 
proteins and eucaryotic DNA- and RNA-binding proteins. In addition, examination 
of the subcellular distribution of SSB1 by immunofluorescence microscopy 
indicated that SSB1 is a nuclear protein, predominantly located in the 
nucleolus. Sequence homologies and the nucleolar localization make it likely 
that SSB1 functions in RNA metabolism in vivo, although an additional role in 
DNA metabolism cannot be excluded.
