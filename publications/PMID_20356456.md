To investigate the differences in the functional roles of peroxiredoxins (Prxs) 
and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we examined the 
peroxidase and molecular chaperone properties of the recombinant proteins. TPx 
(thioredoxin peroxidase) exhibited a capacity for peroxide reduction with the 
thioredoxin system. GPx also showed thioreoxin-dependent peroxidase activity 
rather than GPx activity. The peroxidase activity of BCP (bacterioferritin 
comigratory protein) was similar to that of TPx. However, peroxidase activity 
was not observed for PMP20 (peroxisomal membrane protein 20). TPx, PMP20, and 
GPx inhibited thermal aggregation of citrate synthase at 43(o)C, but BCP failed 
to inhibit the aggregation. The chaperone activities of PMP20 and GPx were 
weaker than that of TPx. The peroxidase and chaperone properties of TPx, BCP, 
and GPx of the fission yeast are similar to those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 
The fission yeast PMP20 without thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase activity may 
act as a molecular chaperone.
