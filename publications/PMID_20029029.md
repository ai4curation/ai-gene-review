Binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to its receptor leads to receptor 
dimerization, assembly of protein complexes, and activation of signaling 
networks that control key cellular responses. Despite their fundamental role in 
cell biology, little is known about protein complexes associated with the EGF 
receptor (EGFR) before growth factor stimulation. We used a modified membrane 
yeast two-hybrid system together with bioinformatics to identify 87 candidate 
proteins interacting with the ligand-unoccupied EGFR. Among them was histone 
deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a cytoplasmic lysine deacetylase, which we found 
negatively regulated EGFR endocytosis and degradation by controlling the 
acetylation status of alpha-tubulin and, subsequently, receptor trafficking 
along microtubules. A negative feedback loop consisting of EGFR-mediated 
phosphorylation of HDAC6 Tyr(570) resulted in reduced deacetylase activity and 
increased acetylation of alpha-tubulin. This study illustrates the complexity of 
the EGFR-associated interactome and identifies protein acetylation as a 
previously unknown regulator of receptor endocytosis and degradation.
