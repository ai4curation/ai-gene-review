Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression is observed in a number 
of malignancies, especially those of esophageal squamous cell origin. However, 
little is known about the biological functions of EGFR in primary esophageal 
squamous epithelial cells. Using newly established primary human esophageal 
squamous epithelial cells as a platform, we overexpressed EGFR through 
retroviral transduction and established novel three-dimensional organotypic 
cultures. Additionally, EGFR was targeted in a cell type- and tissue-specific 
fashion to the esophageal epithelium in transgenic mice. EGFR overexpression in 
primary esophageal keratinocytes resulted in the biochemical activation of Akt 
and STAT pathways and induced enhanced cell migration and cell aggregation. When 
established in organotypic culture, EGFR-overexpressing cells had evidence of 
epithelial cell hyperproliferation and hyperplasia. These effects were also 
observed in EGFR-overexpressing transgenic mice and the esophageal cell lines 
established thereof. In particular, EGFR-induced effects upon aggregation appear 
to be mediated through the relocalization of p120 from the cytoplasm to the 
membrane and increased interaction with E-cadherin. EGFR modulates cell 
migration through the up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 1. Taken 
together, the functional effects of EGFR overexpression help to explain its role 
in the initiating steps of esophageal squamous carcinogenesis.
