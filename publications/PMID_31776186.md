DNA clamp, a highly conserved ring-shaped protein, binds dsDNA within its 
central pore. Also, DNA clamp interacts with various nuclear proteins on its 
front, thereby stimulating their enzymatic activities and biological functions. 
It has been assumed that the DNA clamp is a functionally single-faced ring from 
bacteria to humans. Here, we report the crystal structure of the heterotrimeric 
RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 (9-1-1) checkpoint clamp bound to a peptide of RHINO, a recently 
identified cancer-related protein that interacts with 9-1-1 and promotes 
activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. This is the first structure of 9-1-1 
bound to its partner. The structure reveals that RHINO is unexpectedly bound to 
the edge and around the back of the 9-1-1 ring through specific interactions 
with the RAD1 subunit of 9-1-1. Our finding indicates that 9-1-1 is a 
functionally double-faced DNA clamp.
