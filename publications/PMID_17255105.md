Recent studies confirm that intracellular cAMP concentrations are nonuniform and 
that localized subcellular cAMP hydrolysis by cyclic nucleotide 
phosphodiesterases (PDEs) is important in maintaining these cAMP compartments. 
Human phosphodiesterase 3B (HSPDE3B), a member of the PDE3 family of PDEs, 
represents the dominant particulate cAMP-PDE activity in many cell types, 
including adipocytes and cells of hematopoietic lineage. Although several 
previous reports have shown that phosphorylation of HSPDE3B by either protein 
kinase A (PKA) or protein kinase B (PKB) activates this enzyme, the mechanisms 
that allow cells to distinguish these two activated forms of HSPDE3B are 
unknown. Here we report that PKA phosphorylates HSPDE3B at several distinct 
sites (Ser-73, Ser-296, and Ser-318), and we show that phosphorylation of 
HSPDE3B at Ser-318 activates this PDE and stimulates its interaction with 14-3-3 
proteins. In contrast, although PKB-catalyzed phosphorylation of HSPDE3B 
activates this enzyme, it does not promote 14-3-3 protein binding. 
Interestingly, we report that the PKA-phosphorylated, 14-3-3 protein-bound, form 
of HSPDE3B is protected from phosphatase-dependent dephosphorylation and 
inactivation. In contrast, PKA-phosphorylated HSPDE3B that is not bound to 
14-3-3 proteins is readily dephosphorylated and inactivated. Our data are 
presented in the context that a selective interaction between PKA-activated 
HSPDE3B and 14-3-3 proteins represents a mechanism by which cells can protect 
this enzyme from deactivation. Moreover, we propose that this mechanism may 
allow cells to distinguish between PKA- and PKB-activated HSPDE3B.
