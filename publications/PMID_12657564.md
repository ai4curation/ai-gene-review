Gene-targeting studies in mice demonstrate that the renin-angiotensin system is 
required for the proper development of the renal medulla. In the absence of 
angiotensin II (ANG II) or the ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptor, mice exhibit poor 
papillary development and a severe urinary-concentrating defect. These findings 
imply that the ureteric bud (UB) and its branches are targets for ANG II actions 
during renal development. However, direct evidence linking ANG II with 
UB-branching morphogenesis does not exist. Using immunohistochemistry, we 
demonstrated that UB-derived epithelia express angiotensinogen (Ao) and the AT1 
receptor during murine metanephrogenesis. Ao and AT1 receptors are expressed in 
the UB branches and to a lesser extent in the stromal mesenchyme. AT1 receptor 
expression in UB-derived epithelia increased from embryo day 12 to day 16 and 
was observed on both luminal and basolateral membranes. In accord with these 
findings, cultured murine UB cells express AT1 receptor protein and mRNA. 
Treatment of UB cells cultured in three-dimensional type I collagen gels with 
ANG II (10-7 to 10-5 M) elicits a dose-related increase in the number of cells 
that have primary and secondary branches. These effects of ANG II on UB 
branching are abrogated by pretreatment with the AT1 receptor antagonist 
candesartan. These data demonstrate a direct and independent role for ANG II 
acting via AT1 receptors on UB cell branching in vitro. The presence of Ao in 
the stroma and AT1 on UB cells supports the notion that cross talk between 
stroma and epithelial cells is crucial to epithelial branching morphogenesis in 
the developing kidney.
