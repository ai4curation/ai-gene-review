Caenorhabditis elegans OCR-2 (OSM-9 and capsaicin receptor-related) is a TRPV 
(vanilloid subfamily of transient receptor potential channel) protein that 
regulates serotonin (5-HT) biosynthesis in chemosensory neurons and also 
mediates olfactory and osmotic sensation. Here, we identify the molecular basis 
for the polymodal function of OCR-2 in its native cellular environment. We show 
that OCR-2 function in 5-HT production and osmotic sensing is governed by its 
N-terminal region upstream of the ankyrin repeats domain, but the diacetyl 
sensitivity is mediated by independent mechanisms. The ocr-2(yz5) mutation 
results in a glycine-to-glutamate substitution (G36E) within the N-terminal 
region. The G36E substitution causes dramatic downregulation of 5-HT synthesis 
in the ADF neurons, eliminates osmosensation mediated by the ASH neurons, but 
does not affect the response to the odorant diacetyl mediated by the AWA 
neurons. Conversely, wild-type sequence of the N-terminal segment confers 
osmotic sensitivity and upregulation of 5-HT production to a normally 
insensitive C. elegans homolog, OCR-4, but this chimeric channel does not 
respond to diacetyl stimuli. Furthermore, expression of either the mouse or 
human TRPV2 gene under the ocr-2 promoter can substantially restore 5-HT 
biosynthesis in ocr-2-null mutants but cannot improve the deficits in osmotic or 
olfactory sensation, suggesting that TRPV2 can substitute for the role of OCR-2 
only in serotonergic neurons. Thus, different sensory functions of OCR-2 arise 
from separable intrinsic determinants, and specific functional properties of 
TRPV channel proteins may be selectively conserved across phyla.
