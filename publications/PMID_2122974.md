The mitogenic activity of membrane-associated tyrosine kinases such as Src and 
the PDGF receptor appear to depend on Ras function. Ras biochemical activity 
involves regulation of a GTP/GDP cycle and the GTPase activating protein (GAP). 
Recently, PDGF and v-Src have been shown to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation 
of GAP, linking these pathways at the biochemical level. To test whether PDGF 
and v-Src affect the Ras GTP/GDP cycle, we have measured the guanine nucleotides 
complexed to Ras in NIH3T3 cells and compared the ratio of GTP to total GTP + 
GDP detected (percent GTP). In normal quiescent NIH3T3 cells, PDGF stimulated 
the basal amount of GTP complexed to Ras (7%) by 2.1-fold to 15%. The effect was 
dependent on PDGF concentration and was observed maximally within 10 min 
following PDGF challenge. Ras was complexed to 22% GTP in NIH3T3 cells 
transformed by v-src or v-abl. Overexpression of GAP by 110-fold in NIH3T3 cells 
reduced the basal level of GTP complexed to Ras to 2.4%; upon challenge with 
PDGF, Ras was complexed to 6.6% GTP. These results indicate that PDGF receptor 
activation and tyrosine kinase-encoding oncogene products can stimulate Ras into 
the GTP complex and that GAP in intact mammalian cells can decrease the amount 
of GTP complexed to Ras.
