Bicaudal C homologue 1 (Bicc1) knockout in mice causes polycystic kidney disease 
and pancreas development defects, including a reduction in insulin-producing 
β-cells and ensuing diabetes. We therefore screened 137 patients with renal 
abnormalities or association of early-onset diabetes and renal disease for 
genetic alterations in BICC1. We identified two heterozygous mutations, one 
nonsense in the first K Homology (KH) domain and one missense in the sterile 
alpha motif (SAM) domain. In mice, Bicc1 blocks canonical Wnt signaling, mostly 
via its SAM domain. We show that the human BICC1, similar to its mouse 
counterpart, blocks canonical Wnt signaling. The nonsense mutation identified 
results in a complete loss of Wnt inhibitory activity. The point mutation in the 
SAM domain has a similar effect to a complete SAM domain deletion, resulting in 
a 22% loss of activity.
