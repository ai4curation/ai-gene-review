The CpxA/R two-component signal transduction system of Escherichia coli can 
combat a variety of extracytoplasmic protein-mediated toxicities. The Cpx system 
performs this function, in part, by increasing the synthesis of the periplasmic 
protease, DegP. However, other factors are also employed by the Cpx system for 
this stress-combative function. In an effort to identify these remaining 
factors, we screened a collection of random lacZ operon fusions for those 
fusions whose transcription is regulated by CpxA/R. Through this approach, we 
have identified a new locus, cpxP, whose transcription is stimulated by 
activation of the Cpx pathway. cpxP specifies a periplasmic protein that can 
combat the lethal phenotype associated with the synthesis of a toxic envelope 
protein. In addition, we show that cpxP transcription is strongly induced by 
alkaline pH in a CpxA-dependent manner and that cpxP and cpx mutant strains 
display hypersensitivity to growth in alkaline conditions.
