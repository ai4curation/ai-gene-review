The small GTPase Rab4 is involved in endocytosis through sorting and recycling 
early endosomes. To better understand the role of Rab4 in regulation of 
vesicular trafficking, we searched for effectors that specifically interact with 
Rab4-Q67L, the GTP-bound form of Rab4. We cloned an ubiquitous 80-kDa protein, 
identical to CD2-associated protein/Cas ligand with multiple SH3 domains 
(CD2AP/CMS), that interacts with Rab4-Q67L in the yeast two-hybrid system and in 
vitro. CD2AP/CMS expressed in mammalian cells was localized to punctate 
structures and along actin filaments. None of the known markers of early 
endosomes [Early Endosomes Antigen 1 (EEA1), Rab5 and Rab11] colocalized with 
the CD2AP/CMS-positive vesicles. However, coexpression of Rab4-Q67L with 
CD2AP/CMS induces a significant enlargement of EEA1-positive early endosomes. 
Rab4, CD2AP/CMS and Rab7 colocalized in these modified endosomes. Coexpression 
of c-Cbl and CD2AP/CMS also resulted in an enlargement of early endosomes. Using 
various truncated forms of CD2AP/CMS, we demonstrate that early endosomes 
enlargement requires that CD2AP/CMS interacts with both Rab4 and c-Cbl. The 
expression of a truncated form of CD2AP/CMS that retains the ability to interact 
with Rab4 but not c-Cbl inhibits ligand-induced PDGF receptor degradation. We 
propose that CD2AP/CMS, through interactions with Rab4 and c-Cbl, controls early 
endosome morphology and may play a role in traffic between early and late 
endosomes, and thus in the degradative pathway.
