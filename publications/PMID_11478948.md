cAMP response element binding protein-2 (CREB-2) is a basic leucine zipper 
(bZIP) factor that was originally described as a repressor of CRE-dependent 
transcription but that can also act as a transcriptional activator. Moreover, 
CREB-2 is able to function in association with the viral Tax protein as an 
activator of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) promoter. Here we 
show that CREB-2 is able to interact with C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), a 
bZIP transcription factor known to inhibit CAAT/enhancer-dependent 
transcription. Cotransfection of CHOP with CREB-2 results in decreased 
activation driven by the cellular CRE motif or the HTLV-I proximal 
Tax-responsive element, confirming that CREB-2 and CHOP can interact with each 
other in vivo.
