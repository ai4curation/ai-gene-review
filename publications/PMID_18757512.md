PURPOSE: The effect of a preferential inducer of 78 kDa glucose-regulated 
protein (GRP78)/immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BiP; BiP inducer X, 
BIX) against tunicamycin-induced cell death in RGC-5 (a rat ganglion cell line), 
and also against tunicamycin- or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced retinal 
damage in mice was evaluated.
METHODS: In vitro, BiP mRNA was measured after BIX treatment using 
semi-quantitative RT-PCR or real-time PCR. The effect of BIX on tunicamycin (at 
2 microg/mL)-induced damage was evaluated by measuring the cell-death rate and 
CHOP protein expression. In vivo, BiP protein induction was examined by 
immunostaining. The retinal cell damage induced by tunicamycin (1 microg) or 
NMDA (40 nmol) was assessed by examining ganglion cell layer (GCL) cell loss, 
terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling 
(TUNEL) staining, and CHOP protein expression.
RESULTS: In vitro, BIX preferentially induced BiP mRNA expression both time- and 
concentration-dependently in RGC-5 cells. BIX (1 and 5 microM) significantly 
reduced tunicamycin-induced cell death, and BIX (5 microM) significantly reduced 
tunicamycin-induced CHOP protein expression. In vivo, intravitreal injection of 
BIX (5 nmol) significantly induced BiP protein expression in the mouse retina. 
Co-administration of BIX (5 nmol) significantly reduced both the retinal cell 
death and the CHOP protein expression in GCL induced by intravitreal injection 
of tunicamycin or NMDA.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that this BiP inducer may have the potential 
to be a therapeutic agent for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced retinal 
diseases.
