PROPOSE: IL28B polymorphisms rs12979860 CC genotype was associated to protection 
of HCV infection and sustained virological response (SVR) in HCV infected 
patients treated with pegIFNα/ribavirin (IFNα/RIB), however, this polymorphism 
frequency varies depending on genetic components. Studies with larger number of 
Brazilian individuals, determining IL28B polymorphisms is lacking. Regarding to 
treatment response, the levels of IL10 seem to influence response to IFNα/RIB 
therapy. Thus, the IL28B polymorphism frequency was investigated in health 
controls and infected HCV patients, as well as, in patients who reach SVR vs 
Non-SVR. Also, to gain insight into the interplay between IL28B genotypes, IL10 
levels and therapy response, a subgroup of genotyped HCV patients SVR and 
Non-SVR were analyzed regarding the IL10 production.
METHODS: It was enrolled 487 HCV infected patients and 234 healthy individuals. 
Patients with response to IFNα/RIB were classified as SVR (n = 81) and Non-SVR 
(n = 123). TAQMAN probes were used for genotyping the SNP rs12979860, resulting 
in CC, CT or TT genotypes. In one hundred one patients, the levels IL10 were 
measured at week 4 of IFNα/RIB.
RESULTS: CC genotype was associated to SVR (p = 0.029) and its frequency was 
higher in healthy individuals vs patients (p = 0.02). Patients carrying CT/TT 
with IL10<10 pg/mL, had a chance of 2.72 to achieve SVR in multivariate model (p 
= 0.043).
CONCLUSION: CC genotype was associated to SVR and protection to HCV infection. 
Moreover, IL28B genotyping and IL10 serum levels could be further explored as a 
useful algorithm for identify the CT/TT SVR patients.
