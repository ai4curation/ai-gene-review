The failure of cells to repair damaged DNA can result in genomic instability and 
cancer. To efficiently repair chromosomal DNA lesions, the repair machinery must 
gain access to the damaged DNA in the context of chromatin. Here we report that 
both the RSC and Swi/Snf ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes play key 
roles in double-strand break (DSB) repair, specifically by homologous 
recombination (HR). RSC and Swi/Snf are each recruited to an in vivo DSB site 
but with distinct kinetics. We show that Swi/Snf is required earlier, at or 
preceding the strand invasion step of HR, while RSC is required following 
synapsis for completion of the recombinational repair event.
