The integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein Shr3p is required for 
proper plasma membrane localization of amino acid permeases (AAPs) in yeast. In 
the absence of Shr3p AAPs are uniquely retained in the ER with each of their 
twelve membrane-spanning segments correctly inserted in the membrane. Here, we 
show that the membrane domain of Shr3p specifically prevents AAPs from 
aggregating, and thus, plays a critical role in assisting AAPs to fold and 
correctly attain tertiary structures required for ER exit. Also, we show that 
the integral ER proteins, Gsf2p, Pho86p, and Chs7p, function similarly to Shr3p. 
In cells individually lacking one of these components only their cognate 
substrates, hexose transporters, phosphate transporters, and chitin 
synthase-III, respectively, aggregate and consequently fail to exit the ER 
membrane. These findings indicate that polytopic membrane proteins depend on 
specialized membrane-localized chaperones to prevent inappropriate interactions 
between membrane-spanning segments as they insert and fold in the lipid bilayer 
of the ER membrane.
