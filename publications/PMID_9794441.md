The effect of thrombin receptor activation on monocyte conformation was 
evaluated using the human monocyte cell line, THP-1, and the thrombin mimetic 
peptide, Trap-14. Treatment of THP-1 cells with Trap-14 induced rapid rounding 
of ameboid cells adherent to fibronectin-coated slides, whereas cell rounding 
was abrogated in the presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 
NG-nitro-L-arginine or the endothelin B receptor antagonist, BQ-788. 
Endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels in the culture supernatant increased markedly within 
minutes of Trap-14 exposure with a concomitant loss in cellular ET-1 
immunoreactivity. Importantly, loss of ET-1 immunoreactivity was blocked by 
pretreatment with the vesicle translocation inhibitor, nocodazole. Trap-14 
potently induced the release of NO from THP-1 cells, whereas NO release was 
ablated by preincubation with BQ-788. These data demonstrate that thrombin 
receptor activation may inhibit cellular spreading as a result of autocrine ET-1 
release and subsequent endothelin B receptor-dependent NO production, and 
suggest that initial exposure of inflammatory cells to thrombin may limit 
cellular activation and recruitment.
