Midbrain dopamine neurons project densely to the striatum and form so-called 
dopamine synapses on medium spiny neurons (MSNs), principal neurons in the 
striatum. Because dopamine receptors are widely expressed away from dopamine 
synapses, it remains unclear how dopamine synapses are involved in dopaminergic 
transmission. Here we demonstrate that dopamine synapses are contacts formed 
between dopaminergic presynaptic and GABAergic postsynaptic structures. The 
presynaptic structure expressed tyrosine hydroxylase, vesicular monoamine 
transporter-2, and plasmalemmal dopamine transporter, which are essential for 
dopamine synthesis, vesicular filling, and recycling, but was below the 
detection threshold for molecules involving GABA synthesis and vesicular filling 
or for GABA itself. In contrast, the postsynaptic structure of dopamine synapses 
expressed GABAergic molecules, including postsynaptic adhesion molecule 
neuroligin-2, postsynaptic scaffolding molecule gephyrin, and GABAA receptor α1, 
without any specific clustering of dopamine receptors. Of these, neuroligin-2 
promoted presynaptic differentiation in axons of midbrain dopamine neurons and 
striatal GABAergic neurons in culture. After neuroligin-2 knockdown in the 
striatum, a significant decrease of dopamine synapses coupled with a reciprocal 
increase of GABAergic synapses was observed on MSN dendrites. This finding 
suggests that neuroligin-2 controls striatal synapse formation by giving 
competitive advantage to heterologous dopamine synapses over conventional 
GABAergic synapses. Considering that MSN dendrites are preferential targets of 
dopamine synapses and express high levels of dopamine receptors, dopamine 
synapse formation may serve to increase the specificity and potency of 
dopaminergic modulation of striatal outputs by anchoring dopamine release sites 
to dopamine-sensing targets.
