Abstract

EGFR and its constitutively activated variant EGFRvIII are linked to glioblastoma resistance to therapy, the mechanisms underlying this association, however, are still unclear. We report that in glioblastoma, EGFR/EGFRvIII paradoxically co-expresses with p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins primarily located on the mitochondria. EGFR/EGFRvIII binds to PUMA constitutively and under apoptotic stress, and subsequently sequesters PUMA in the cytoplasm. The EGFR-PUMA interaction is independent of EGFR activation and is sustained under EGFR inhibition. A Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor that mimics PUMA activity sensitizes EGFR/EGFRvIII-expressing glioblastoma cells to Iressa. Collectively, we uncovered a novel kinase-independent function of EGFR/EGFRvIII that leads to tumor drug resistance.

1. Introduction

GBM is the most common and deadliest brain malignancy in adults and, approximately, 90% of patients with these tumors survive only 12-14 months after diagnosis [ 1 ]. It is, therefore, an urgent task to better understand the biology of these aggressive tumors in order to improve their therapy. The gene encoding EGFR is often amplified and over-expressed in human GBM [ 2 ; 3 ; 4 ]. EGFRvIII, the EGFR constitutively active variant, is a product of rearrangement with an in-frame deletion of 801 bp of the coding sequence within the extracellular domain, resulting in a deletion of residues 6 through 273 and a glycine insertion at residue 6 [ 3 ; 5 ; 6 ]. Expression of EGFRvIII is common in GBMs. Both EGFR and EGFRvIII are associated with tumor growth and progression and are, thus, major therapeutic targets for many human cancers, including, GBM [ 7 ; 8 ; 9 ; 10 ].

Small molecule EGFR inhibitors and monoclonal anti-EGFR antibodies have been evaluated clinically for the efficacy against GBM patients both as single agents and in combination with chemotherapeutic agents [ 11 ]. These therapies have, however, demonstrated only modest effects [ 12 ; 13 ; 14 ; 15 ]. The mechanisms underlying these poor results remain unclear. Gain-of-function mutations within the EGFR kinase domain are commonly found in lung cancer and lead to their hyper-sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors [ 16 ; 17 ]. However, such somatic mutations have not been found in gliomas [ 18 ]. These observations indicate that our understanding of the biology of EGFR that underlies its role in tumor drug resistance and its response to EGFR-targeted therapy in GBM is insufficient.

Most anti-cancer agents induce intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptosis rather than extrinsic death receptor-mediated apoptosis [ 19 ; 20 ]. The anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, including, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, are guardians of mitochondrial integrity [ 19 ; 21 ; 22 ]. Conversely, the proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins function by antagonizing the anti-apoptotic proteins and include the multi-BH3 domain proteins (Bax, Bak, and Bok) and the BH3-only proteins (Bid, Bim, Bmf and PUMA). Although, these proapoptotic proteins appear to be functionally redundant, their expression has been shown to be tumor-specific [ 23 ] and one of the main ones, PUMA, has recently been shown to mediate EGFR inhibitor-induced apoptosis in head and neck cancer [ 24 ]. Although, a direct regulatory role of EGFR/EGFRvIII in apoptosis has not been reported, it has been recently shown that ErbB4, a member of the EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases, interacts with the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein to promotes apoptosis [ 25 ].

Therapeutic activation of the apoptotic pathway has emerged as an attractive treatment strategy for a number of cancers, including, GBM [ 26 ; 27 ]. In GBMs, however, to date, a systemic analysis of the expression profile of the proapoptotic members of Bcl-2 family of proteins has not been reported and the relationship between these proapoptotic proteins and EGFR/EGFRvIII remains unclear in GBMs. In this study, we investigated the interaction between PUMA and EGFR and its potential role in EGFR-targeted mono and combinational therapies of GBMs. Our results show that, paradoxically, both wild-type EGFR and EGFRvIII co-express with proapoptotic protein PUMA in GBM cells, in vitro and in vivo . EGFR and EGFRvIII both interact with PUMA constitutively and under apoptotic stress, leading to cytoplasmic sequestration of PUMA in GBM cells. In contrast, PUMA is exclusively localized on the mitochondrial membranes, as expected, in EGFR-negative GBM cells. These results, together with additional data from functional studies provide evidence for a novel inverse functional link between the EGFR/EGFRvIII signaling and the proapoptotic pathway and this can be a mechanism that accounts for EGFR-associated drug resistance in GBM and, potentially, in other cancer types that also co-express EGFR and PUMA.

4. Discussion

Over-expression of EGFR and EGFRvIII is a major hallmark of GBM. Although, both receptors have been linked to GBM resistance to chemotherapy, the mechanisms underlying this association are still unclear. Our findings in this study provide evidence that both EGFR and EGFRvIII negatively regulate intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by binding to PUMA, a proapoptotic protein that is highly expressed in the majority of GBM. Following the interactions of EGFR/EGFRvIII with PUMA, PUMA is sequestered in the cytoplasm, leading to impaired apoptotic response in GBM. Our results also demonstrate that EGFR/EGFRvIII-mediated antagonism of PUMA is independent of EGFR/EGFRvIII kinase activity and thus, may define a novel mechanism of tumor resistance to apoptosis-inducing EGFR inhibitors. Our data also provide a rationale for a novel GBM therapy, in which both the kinase-dependent and -independent activities of EGFR/EGFRvIII are targeted simultaneously in order to improve EGFR-based mono and combinational therapies.

The results in this study showing GBMs, known to be highly resistant to therapy, to express high levels of the proapoptotic protein, PUMA, is paradoxical. To gain insight into this paradox, we investigated EGFR and EGFRvIII, frequently over-expressed in GBM similar to PUMA, and found both pathways to be inversely linked to the apoptotic response of GBM cells. These results allow the speculation that a subset of GBMs (34%) is capable of up-regulating EGFR/EGFRvIII expression in order to negatively regulate PUMA and thereby, escape therapy-induced apoptosis. Our results, however, also indicate that PUMA can be negatively regulated by EGFR/EGFRvIII-independent mechanisms, given the fact ( Fig. 2a ) that a portion of PUMA-expressing GBMs do not express EGFR/EGFRvIII. Future investigation is thus needed to identify these mechanisms in order to augment the apoptotic effects of anti-GBM therapy.

The functional interaction between EGFR/EGFRvIII and PUMA potentially represents a new class of protein-protein interaction that involves a receptor tyrosine kinase and a proapoptotic protein. It is well known that EGFR can engage in protein-protein interactions with a variety of proteins, including, transcription factors, STAT3 [ 43 ], STAT5 [ 44 ] and E2F1 [ 45 ], DNA-dependent protein kinase [ 46 ], and the DNA replication and damage repair protein PCNA [ 47 ]. EGFR-STAT3 interactions lead to transcriptional activation of several cancer-related genes, including, inducible nitric oxide synthase [ 34 ], TWIST [ 48 ] and COX-2 [ 49 ]. EGFR has been shown to interact with and stabilize sodium/glucose cotransporter 1, leading to maintenance of intracellular glucose level and prevention of autophagic cell death [ 50 ], and to bind to and phosphorylate the human GSTP1 protein [ 51 ]. Interestingly, the tumor suppressor, p53, has been shown to translocate onto the mitochondria and bind to anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, leading to apoptosis [ 52 ]. Similarly, ErbB4 undergoes mitochondrial translocalization and subsequently interacts with the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, leading to apoptosis [ 25 ]. Unlike p53 and ErbB4, EGFR and EGFRvIII interact with proapoptotic PUMA to antagonize mitochondrial transport of PUMA, leading to reduced levels of apoptosis and increased cell survival. Together, these findings describe a new class of protein-protein interactions that occurs between Bcl-2 and non-Bcl-2 proteins, and that these interactions regulate intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.

Although EGFR and EGFRvIII are best known for their tyrosine kinase function, the results presented in the current study and from previous reports, indicate that both proteins also have kinase-independent functions. For example, EGFR has been shown to undergo nuclear translocalization and to function as transcriptional regulators, through the transactivation domain and interactions with DNA-binding transcription factors [ 34 ; 45 ; 53 ]. Nuclear EGFRvIII has been shown to interact with STAT3 to promote malignant transformation of glial cells [ 54 ]. EGFR prevents autophagic cell death by maintaining intracellular glucose level through EGFR kinase-independent interaction and stabilization of the sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 [ 50 ]. In line with these observations, PTEN elicits phosphatase-dependent and -independent functions [ 55 ]. These findings indicate that both EGFR and EGFRvIII possess kinase-dependent and -independent activities and have a profound potential to interact with other important pathways in cancers.

Our results showed that Iressa, an EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, fails to disrupt the interaction between EGFR/EGFRvIII and PUMA, suggesting that this kinase-independent anti-apoptotic activity may be an important mechanism underlying the limited clinical efficacy demonstrated by EGFR-targeted therapy. These observations also suggest that a higher therapeutic efficacy may be achieved by targeting both kinase-dependent and -independent functions of EGFR. In support of this premise, our data showed that mimicking PUMA's proapoptotic activity using a Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor sensitized both EGFR- and EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells to Iressa and that most GBM cell lines we analyzed expressed high levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Collectively, these findings provide strong evidence for a novel mechanism by which EGFR confers GBM resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy and potentially other therapies, as well as, provide a rationale for a novel combinational anti-GBM therapy that target both EGFR and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.
