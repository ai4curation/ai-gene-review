The spindle assembly checkpoint monitors microtubule attachment to kinetochores 
and tension across sister kinetochores to ensure accurate division of 
chromosomes between daughter cells. Cytoplasmic dynein functions in the 
checkpoint, apparently by moving critical checkpoint components off 
kinetochores. The dynein subunit required for this function is unknown. Here we 
show that human cells depleted of dynein light intermediate chain 1 (LIC1) delay 
in metaphase with increased interkinetochore distances; dynein remains intact, 
localised and functional. The checkpoint proteins Mad1/2 and Zw10 localise to 
kinetochores under full tension, whereas BubR1 is diminished at kinetochores. 
Metaphase delay and increased interkinetochore distances are suppressed by 
depletion of Mad1, Mad2 or BubR1 or by re-expression of wtLIC1 or a Cdk1 site 
phosphomimetic LIC1 mutant, but not Cdk1-phosphorylation-deficient LIC1. When 
the checkpoint is activated by microtubule depolymerisation, Mad1/2 and BubR1 
localise to kinetochores. We conclude that a Cdk1 phosphorylated form of LIC1 is 
required to remove Mad1/2 and Zw10 but not BubR1 from kinetochores during 
spindle assembly checkpoint silencing.
