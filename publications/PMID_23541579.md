In previous studies, we have shown several lines of evidence that podoplanin 
(PDPN) plays an important role in cell adhesion via its association with 
extracellular components in neoplastic conditions, though there has been no 
trial to search for PDPN-interaction molecules in the extracellular milieu. To 
screen for those molecules, we performed proteomics-based analysis using liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry followed by co-immunoprecipitation for 
PDPN in ZK-1, an oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell system whose cell 
membrane molecules were cross-linked with each other in their extracellular 
compartments, and we identified heat shock protein (HSP) A9 as one of the 
extracellular PDPN bound molecules. Effects of transient PDPN knockdown by siRNA 
in ZK-1 were also comparatively examined for cellular behaviors in terms of 
HSPA9 expression and secretion. Finally, HSPA9 expression modes were 
immunohistochemically visualized in oral SCC tissue specimens. HSPA9 was 
secreted from ZK-1 cells, and the expression and secretion levels of HSPA9 gene 
and protein were well coordinated with those of PDPN. Immunohistochemically, 
HSPA9 and PDPN were co-localized in ZK-1 cells and oral SCC foci, especially in 
the peripheral zone. In conclusion, the results indicate that HSPA9 secreted by 
oral SCC cells interacts with PDPN on their cell surface in an autocrine manner 
and regulates their growth and invasiveness.
