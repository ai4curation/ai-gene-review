Despite its demonstrated potential to both improve quality of care and lower 
costs, the Medicare hospice benefit has been seen as producing savings only for 
patients enrolled 53-105 days before death. Using data from the Health and 
Retirement Study, 2002-08, and individual Medicare claims, and overcoming 
limitations of previous work, we found $2,561 in savings to Medicare for each 
patient enrolled in hospice 53-105 days before death, compared to a matched, 
nonhospice control. Even higher savings were seen, however, with more common, 
shorter enrollment periods: $2,650, $5,040, and $6,430 per patient enrolled 1-7, 
8-14, and 15-30 days prior to death, respectively. Within all periods examined, 
hospice patients also had significantly lower rates of hospital service use and 
in-hospital death than matched controls. Instead of attempting to limit Medicare 
hospice participation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services should 
focus on ensuring the timely enrollment of qualified patients who desire the 
benefit.

Abstract

Despite its demonstrated potential to both improve quality of care and lower costs, the Medicare hospice benefit has been seen as producing savings only for patients enrolled 53–105 days before death. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, 2002–08, and individual Medicare claims, and overcoming limitations of previous work, we found $2,561 in savings to Medicare for each patient enrolled in hospice 53–105 days before death, compared to a matched, nonhospice control. Even higher savings were seen, however, with more common, shorter enrollment periods: $2,650, $5,040, and $6,430 per patient enrolled 1–7, 8–14, and 15–30 days prior to death, respectively. Within all periods examined, hospice patients also had significantly lower rates of hospital service use and in-hospital death than matched controls. Instead of attempting to limit Medicare hospice participation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services should focus on ensuring the timely enrollment of qualified patients who desire the benefit.

Study Data And Methods

We examined data from the Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal survey administered to a nationally representative cohort of adults over age fifty. Serial interviews are conducted every two years and include information on participants’ demographic, economic, social, and functional characteristics. Each interview cycle, participants who died since the last interview are identified, and dates of death are drawn from the National Death Index. More than 80 percent of participants provided authorization to merge their survey data with Medicare claims, 26 , 27 a necessary step in the present analysis.

Discussion

Medicare costs for patients enrolled in hospice were significantly lower than those of nonhospice enrollees across all periods studied: 1–7 days, 8–14 days, and 15–30 days, the most common enrollment periods prior to death, as well as 53–105 days, the period previously shown to maximize Medicare savings. 23

In addition, reductions in the use of hospital services at the end of life both contribute to these savings and potentially improve quality of care and patients’ quality of life. Specifically, hospice enrollment was associated with significant reductions in hospital and intensive care unit admissions, hospital days, and rates of thirty-day hospital readmission and in-hospital death.

Conclusion

Hospice enrollment during the longer period of 53–105 days prior to death and the most common period within 30 days prior to death lowers Medicare expenditures, rates of hospital and intensive care unit use, 30-day hospital readmissions, and in-hospital death. Building upon prior studies of hospice and palliative care that have demonstrated higher quality and improved patient and family satisfaction, 8 , 13 – 15 , 32 – 36 this finding suggests that hospice and palliative care are critical components in achieving greater value through health care reform: namely, improved quality and reduced costs.

Medicare should thus seek to expand access to hospice services so that hospice can contribute to its full potential to the overall value of care. To do so, substantial barriers to timely hospice enrollment must be overcome. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services should abandon efforts to reduce Medicare hospice spending and delay hospice enrollment and should instead focus on ensuring that people who want hospice care receive timely referral.

Within the current Medicare hospice benefit, several approaches may expand access and increase appropriate and timely referral to hospice. These approaches include formalized partnerships between hospital palliative care programs and community hospice programs and the promotion of patient-centered care by educating patients, families, and physicians about the availability and benefits of hospice and palliative care services.

Finally, ongoing demonstration projects and novel models of health care delivery and reimbursement should place a high priority on the rigorous evaluation of hospice service use and its impact on the value of care.
