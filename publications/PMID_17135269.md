The factors and mechanisms that mediate the effects of intracellular signaling 
cascades on alternative pre-mRNA splicing are poorly understood. TIA-1 (T-cell 
intracellular antigen 1) and TIAR (TIA-1-related) proteins regulate alternative 
pre-mRNA splicing by promoting the use of suboptimal 5' splice sites followed by 
uridine-rich intronic enhancer sequences. These proteins promote, for example, 
inclusion of Fas receptor exon 6, which leads to an mRNA encoding a 
pro-apoptotic form of the receptor at the expense of the form that skips exon 6, 
which encodes an anti-apoptotic form. Fas-activated serine/threonine kinase 
(FAST K) is known to interact with and phosphorylate TIA-1. Here we have tested 
the possibility that FAST K influences alternative pre-mRNA splicing by 
affecting the activity of TIA-1/TIAR. Depletion of FAST K form Jurkat cells 
leads to skipping of exon 6 from endogenous Fas transcripts. Conversely, FAST K 
overexpression enhances exon 6 inclusion of Fas reporters transfected in HeLa 
cells. Consistent with the possibility that the effects of FAST K are mediated 
by changes in the function of TIA-1/TIAR, the effects of FAST K overexpression 
(i) are largely suppressed by depletion of TIA-1 and TIAR and (ii) are 
significantly compromised by mutation of a TIA-1/TIAR-responsive enhancer 
present downstream of exon 6 5' splice site. Furthermore, in vitro 
phosphorylation of TIA-1 by FAST K results in enhanced U1 snRNP recruitment. 
Interestingly, this enhancement is not due to increased binding of TIA-1 to the 
pre-mRNA. Taken together, the results connect Fas signaling with the activity of 
splicing factors that modulate Fas alternative splicing, suggesting the 
existence of an autoregulatory loop that could serve to amplify Fas responses.
