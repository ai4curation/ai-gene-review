Tankyrase, a protein with homology to ankyrins and to the catalytic domain of 
poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP), was identified and 
localized to human telomeres. Tankyrase binds to the telomeric protein TRF1 
(telomeric repeat binding factor-1), a negative regulator of telomere length 
maintenance. Like ankyrins, tankyrase contains 24 ankyrin repeats in a domain 
responsible for its interaction with TRF1. Recombinant tankyrase was found to 
have PARP activity in vitro, with both TRF1 and tankyrase functioning as 
acceptors for adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation. ADP-ribosylation of TRF1 
diminished its ability to bind to telomeric DNA in vitro, suggesting that 
telomere function in human cells is regulated by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation.
