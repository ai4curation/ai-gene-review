Neisseria gonorrhoeae opacity-associated (Opa) proteins are a family of outer 
membrane proteins involved in gonococcal adherence to and invasion of human 
cells. We wanted to identify additional roles for Opa in the infectious process 
and used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify human epithelial cell proteins 
that interact with Opa proteins. Although this system has been used successfully 
to identify many types of interacting proteins, it has not been used to screen a 
human cell cDNA library for binding partners of a prokaryotic outer membrane 
protein. Therefore, we were also interested in exploring the versatility of the 
yeast two-hybrid system in identifying bacteria-host interactions. Using OpaP 
from strain F62SF as bait, we screened a HeLa cell cDNA library for 
Opa-interacting proteins (OIPs). We identified five different OIPs, designated 
OIP1-OIP5, two of which are homologous to human proteins--thyroid hormone 
receptor interacting protein (TRIP6) and pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PK). In 
the studies presented here, we investigated the interaction between Opa proteins 
and PK in more depth. Opa-PK interactions were confirmed by in vitro and in vivo 
assays independent of the yeast two-hybrid system. Escherichia coli expressing 
six different Opa proteins from gonococcal strain FA1090 all bound more PK than 
Opa-negative E. coli in in vitro binding assays. Using anti-PK antibody and 
fluorescence microscopy, we showed that human epithelial cell PK co-localizes 
with intracellular Opa+ gonococci and E. coli expressing Opa proteins. Using a 
mutant of N. gonorrhoeae unable to grow on pyruvate or lactate, it appears that 
intracellular pyruvate is essential for gonococcal growth and survival. These 
results suggest a novel mechanism in bacterial pathogenesis, i.e. the 
requirement for direct molecular interaction with a host metabolic enzyme (PK) 
for the acquisition of an essential intracellular carbon source and growth 
substrate (pyruvate). These results demonstrate that the yeast two-hybrid system 
is a valuable tool for identifying biologically relevant interactions between 
bacteria and host proteins, providing valuable leads for further investigations 
into novel mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis.
