Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (Batten disease) is a progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder resulting from mutations in the CLN3 gene, which 
encodes a hydrophobic 438 amino acid protein of unknown function. Prior studies 
have shown that CLN3 is expressed in multiple tissues, with highest levels in 
brain and testis. Experiments using cells overexpressing CLN3 indicate that CLN3 
is a lysosomal resident protein. However, studies to date have not addressed 
trafficking of endogenous CLN3. As such, the purpose of the present study was 
two-fold. First, to develop a culture model to allow evaluation of native CLN3 
transport. Second, to utilize available epitope-specific antibodies to determine 
if CLN3 reaches the plasma membrane en route to the lysosome. Our data using a 
NCCIT (embryonic testicular carcinoma) cell model coupled with surface 
biotinylation and antibody trapping demonstrated that at least a proportion of 
CLN3 trafficks to the lysosome via the cell membrane. Moreover, inhibition of 
the micro3A subunit of the AP-3 adapter protein complex increased levels of CLN3 
at the cell surface.
