Protein folding in mitochondria is mediated by the chaperonin Hsp60, the 
homologue of E. coli GroEL. Mitochondria also contain a homologue of the 
cochaperonin GroES, called Hsp10, which is a functional regulator of the 
chaperonin. To define the in vivo role of the co-chaperonin, we have used the 
genetic and biochemical potential of the yeast S. cerevisiae. The HSP10 gene was 
cloned and sequenced and temperature-sensitive lethal hsp10 mutants were 
generated. Our results identify Hsp10 as an essential component of the 
mitochondrial protein folding apparatus, participating in various aspects of 
Hsp60 function. Hsp10 is required for the folding and assembly of proteins 
imported into the matrix compartment, and is involved in the sorting of certain 
proteins, such as the Rieske Fe/S protein, passing through the matrix en route 
to the intermembrane space. The folding of the precursor of cytosolic 
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), imported into mitochondria as a fusion protein, 
is apparently independent of Hsp10 function consistent with observations made 
for the chaperonin-mediated folding of DHFR in vitro. The temperature-sensitive 
mutations in Hsp10 map to a domain (residues 25-40) that corresponds to a 
previously identified mobile loop region of bacterial GroES and result in a 
reduced binding affinity of hsp10 for the chaperonin at the non-permissive 
temperature.
