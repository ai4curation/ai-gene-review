The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and insulin-like signaling 
play pivotal roles in cellular stress response. Using an anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK 
antibody and a daf-16::GFP-based reporter assay, the present study shows in 
Caenorhabditis elegans that ambient temperature (1-37 degrees C) specifically 
influences the activation (phosphorylation) of the MAP kinase JNK-1 as well as 
the nuclear translocation of DAF-16, the main downstream target of insulin-like 
signaling. Activated JNK-1 was detected only in neuronal cells, and JNK-1 was 
found to be controlled by the MAPK JKK-1 under heat stress. Comparative analyses 
on the wildtype and a jnk-1 deletion mutant revealed a promoting influence of 
JNK-1 on both nuclear DAF-16 translocations and DAF-16 target gene (superoxide 
dismutase 3, sod-3) expressions within peripheral, non-neuronal tissue. 
Consequently, the mutant exhibited a reduced thermal tolerance and reproductive 
fitness at higher temperatures. These results provide evidence of indirect 
interactions between neuronal MAPK and peripheral insulin-like signaling in 
response to environmental stimuli (temperature, H2O2).
