The presence of protein aggregates in the nervous system is associated with 
various pathological conditions, yet their contribution to disease mechanisms is 
poorly understood. One type of aggregate, the aggresome, accumulates misfolded 
proteins destined for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. 
Peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) is a short-lived Schwann cell (SC) protein 
that forms aggresomes when the proteasome is inhibited or the protein is 
overexpressed. Duplication, deletion, or point mutations in PMP22 are associated 
with a host of demyelinating peripheral neuropathies, suggesting that, for 
normal SC cell function, the levels of PMP22 must be tightly regulated. 
Therefore, we speculate that mutant, misfolded PMP22 might overload the 
proteasome and promote aggresome formation. To test this, sciatic nerves of 
Trembler J (TrJ) neuropathy mice carrying a leucine-to-proline mutation in PMP22 
were studied. In TrJ neuropathy nerves, PMP22 has an extended half-life and 
forms aggresome-like structures that are surrounded by molecular chaperones and 
lysosomes. On the basis of these characteristics, we hypothesized that PMP22 
aggresomes are transitory, linking the proteasomal and lysosomal protein 
degradation pathways. Here we show that Schwann cells have the ability to 
eliminate aggresomes by a mechanism that is enhanced when autophagy is activated 
and is primarily prevented when autophagy is inhibited. This mechanism of 
aggresome clearance is not unique to peripheral glia, because L fibroblasts were 
also capable of removing aggresomes. Our results provide evidence for the 
involvement of the proteasome pathway in TrJ neuropathy and for the role of 
autophagy in the clearance of aggresomes.
