Gankyrin, a non-ATPase component of the proteasome and a chaperone of proteasome 
assembly, is also an oncoprotein. Gankyrin regulates a variety of oncogenic 
signaling pathways in cancer cells and accelerates degradation of tumor 
suppressor proteins p53 and Rb. Therefore gankyrin may be a unique hub 
integrating signaling networks with the degradation pathway. To identify new 
interactions that may be crucial in consolidating its role as an oncogenic hub, 
crystal structure of gankyrin-proteasome ATPase complex was used to predict 
novel interacting partners. EEVD, a four amino acid linear sequence seems a hot 
spot site at this interface. By searching for EEVD in exposed regions of human 
proteins in PDB database, we predicted 34 novel interactions. Eight proteins 
were tested and seven of them were found to interact with gankyrin. Affinity of 
four interactions is high enough for endogenous detection. Others require 
gankyrin overexpression in HEK 293 cells or occur endogenously in breast cancer 
cell line- MDA-MB-435, reflecting lower affinity or presence of a deregulated 
network. Mutagenesis and peptide inhibition confirm that EEVD is the common hot 
spot site at these interfaces and therefore a potential polypharmacological drug 
target. In MDA-MB-231 cells in which the endogenous CLIC1 is silenced, 
trans-expression of Wt protein (CLIC1_EEVD) and not the hot spot site mutant 
(CLIC1_AAVA) resulted in significant rescue of the migratory potential. Our 
approach can be extended to identify novel functionally relevant protein-protein 
interactions, in expansion of oncogenic networks and in identifying potential 
therapeutic targets.
