Nicotine is not only a major component in tobacco but is also a survival agonist 
that inhibits apoptosis induced by diverse stimuli including chemotherapeutic 
drugs. However, the intracellular mechanism(s) involved in nicotine suppression 
of apoptosis is unclear. Bcl2 is a potent antiapoptotic protein and tumor 
promotor that is expressed in both small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. It is possible that nicotine may regulate Bcl2 
to stimulate cell survival. Here we report that nicotine can induce Bcl2 
phosphorylation exclusively at the serine 70 site in association with prolonged 
survival of SCLC H82 cells expressing wild-type but not the 
phosphorylation-deficient S70A mutant Bcl2 after treatment with chemotherapeutic 
agents (i.e. cisplatin or VP-16). Nicotine induces activation of PKC alpha and 
the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2, which are physiological Bcl2 kinases. Furthermore, 
ET-18-OCH3, a specific phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, blocks 
nicotine-stimulated Bcl2 phosphorylation and promotes apoptosis, suggesting that 
PLC may be involved in nicotine activation of Bcl2 kinases. Using a genetic 
approach, the gain-of-function S70E mutant, which mimics Ser(70) site 
phosphorylation in the flexible loop domain, potently enhances chemoresistance 
in SCLC cells. Thus, nicotine-induced cell survival results, at least in part, 
from a mechanism that involves Bcl2 phosphorylation. Therefore, novel 
therapeutic strategies for lung cancer in which Bcl2 is expressed may be used to 
abrogate the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl2 by inhibiting multiple upstream 
nicotine-activated pathways.
