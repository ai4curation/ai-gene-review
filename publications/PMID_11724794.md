The small GTPase Rab2 immunolocalizes to vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) that 
function as transport complexes carrying cargo between the endoplasmic reticulum 
and the Golgi complex. Our previous studies showed that Rab2 promotes vesicle 
formation from VTCs and that the released vesicles are enriched in beta-coat 
protein, protein kinase C iota/lambda (PKCiota/lambda), 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and the recycling protein 
p53/gp58. Because PKCiota/lambda kinase activity was necessary for vesicle 
formation, a search was initiated to identify the substrate(s) that potentiate 
Rab2 function within VTCs. In this study, we found that PKCiota/lambda 
phosphorylates GAPDH. Moreover, GAPDH interacts directly with the PKCiota/lambda 
regulatory domain. Based on numerous observations that show (beta-COP) GAPDH 
associates with cytoskeletal elements, we examined the role of phospho-GAPDH in 
promoting microtubule (MT) binding to membrane. Using a quantitative microsomal 
binding assay, we found that membrane association of beta-tubulin was dependent 
on phospho-GAPDH and was blocked by reagents that interfere with Rab2-dependent 
GAPDH membrane recruitment or with PKCiota/lambda kinase activity. Furthermore, 
normal rat kidney cells transfected with a constitutively activated form of Rab2 
(Q65L) or with our anti-GAPDH polyclonal antibody displayed a dramatic change in 
MT organization. These combined results suggest that Rab2 stimulated 
PKCiota/lambda and GAPDH recruitment to VTCs, and the subsequent PKCiota/lambda 
phosphorylation of GAPDH ultimately influences MT dynamics in the early 
secretory pathway.
