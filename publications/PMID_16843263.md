HER2/Neu gene mutations have been identified in lung cancer. Expression of a 
HER2 mutant containing a G776(YVMA) insertion in exon 20 was more potent than 
wild-type HER2 in associating with and activating signal transducers, 
phosphorylating EGFR, and inducing survival, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity. 
HER2(YVMA) transphosphorylated kinase-dead EGFR(K721R) and EGFR(WT) in the 
presence of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Knockdown of mutant HER2 in 
H1781 lung cancer cells increased apoptosis and restored sensitivity to EGFR 
TKIs. The HER2 inhibitors lapatinib, trastuzumab, and CI-1033 inhibited growth 
of H1781 cells and cells expressing exogenous HER2(YVMA). These data suggest 
that (1) HER2(YVMA) activates cellular substrates more potently than HER2(WT); 
and (2) cancer cells expressing this mutation remain sensitive to HER2-targeted 
therapies but insensitive to EGFR TKIs.
