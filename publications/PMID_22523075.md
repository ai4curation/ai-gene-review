Mitotic phosphorylation of the conserved GRASP domain of GRASP65 disrupts its 
self-association, leading to a loss of Golgi membrane tethering, cisternal 
unlinking, and Golgi breakdown. Recently, the structural basis of the GRASP 
self-interaction was determined, yet the mechanism by which phosphorylation 
disrupts this activity is unknown. Here, we present the crystal structure of a 
GRASP phosphomimic containing an aspartic acid substitution for a serine residue 
(Ser-189) that in GRASP65 is phosphorylated by PLK1, causing a block in membrane 
tethering and Golgi ribbon formation. The structure revealed a conformational 
change in the GRASP internal ligand that prevented its insertion into the PDZ 
binding pocket, and gel filtration assays showed that this phosphomimic mutant 
exhibited a significant reduction in dimer formation. Interestingly, the 
structure also revealed an apparent propagation of conformational change from 
the site of phosphorylation to the shifted ligand, and alanine substitution of 
two residues (Glu-145 and Ser-146) at penultimate positions in this chain 
rescued dimer formation by the phosphomimic. These data reveal the structural 
basis of the phosphoinhibition of GRASP-mediated membrane tethering and provide 
a mechanism for its allosteric regulation.
