Thioredoxin, despite its function as an intracellular disulfide reducing enzyme 
and its lack of a signal sequence, has been found to play some roles 
extracellularly. Here we show that thioredoxin is actively secreted by a variety 
of normal and transformed cells, including fibroblasts, airway epithelial cells, 
and activated B and T lymphocytes. Neither brefeldin A nor dinitrophenol, two 
drugs that block transport through the exocytic pathway, inhibit secretion of 
thioredoxin, indicating that the latter does not follow the classical ER-Golgi 
route. The secretory mechanism for thioredoxin shares several features with the 
alternative pathway described for interleukin-1 beta, such as the potentiating 
effect on secretion of several unrelated drugs and the sensitivity to 
methylamine. However, unlike interleukin-1 beta, thioredoxin is not detected in 
membrane-bound compartments of secreting cells. In addition, when COS7 are 
transfected with plasmids encoding pro-interleukin-1 beta or thioredoxin, only 
the latter is detectable extracellularly.
