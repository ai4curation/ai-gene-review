Disturbances in the normal functions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can lead 
to the accumulation of unfolded proteins and disturbance of Ca(2+) regulation 
within the lumen of ER, and arouse a series of complicated response termed 
unfolded protein response (UPR), which is aimed initially at reestablishing 
homeostasis and normal physiology but can ultimately trigger cell death if the 
UPR fails to compensate for damage. Here we show that ER locating human RING 
finger E3 ligase RNF186 participates in the process of ER stress-mediated 
apoptosis. Overexpression of RNF186 stimulates upregulation of ER sensor 
proteins and rapid transmission of ER Ca(2+) in Hela cells, while RNF186 
knockdown exhibits a moderate degree of resistance to ER stress, indicating 
RNF186 can arouse stress signaling at ER. We further identified the Bcl-2 family 
protein BNip1 as one of the substrates of RNF186. BNip1 co-localizes with RNF186 
at ER and is poly-ubiquitinated by RNF186 through K29 and K63 linkage in vivo. 
This modification promotes BNip1 transportation to mitochondria but has no 
influence on its protein level. The half-life of RNF186 is prolonged under ER 
stress, probably because of the inhibition on its self-ubiquitination and 
subsequent degradation by proteasomes. In addition, the ubiquitination of BNip1 
is greatly enhanced when ER stress occurred, possibly due to RNF186 
accumulation. More importantly, knockdown of BNip1 attenuates the stress signals 
at ER induced by RNF186. These results collectively indicate that BNip1 
functions as a downstream modulator of RNF186 to direct ER stress-associated 
apoptotic signaling. Our study might reveal a novel E3 ligase-mediated mechanism 
for modulating ER stress.
