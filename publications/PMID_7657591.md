The murine retroviral oncogene v-cbl induces pre-B cell lymphomas and 
myelogenous leukemias. The protein product of the mammalian c-cbl proto-oncogene 
is a widely expressed cytoplasmic 120-kDa protein (p120cbl) whose normal 
cellular function has not been determined. Here we show that upon stimulation of 
human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, p12ocbl becomes strongly 
tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with activated EGF receptor in vivo. A 
GST fusion protein containing amino acids 1-486 of p120cbl, including a region 
highly conserved in nematodes, binds directly to the autophosphorylated 
carboxyl-terminal tail of the EGF receptor. Platelet-derived growth factor 
(PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), or nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation 
also results in tyrosine phosphorylation of p120cbl. Recent genetic studies in 
Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that Sli-1, a p120cbl homologue, plays a 
negative regulatory role in control of the Ras signaling pathway initiated by 
the C. elegans EGF receptor homologue. Our results indicate that p120cbl is 
involved in an early step in the EGF signaling pathway that is conserved from 
nematodes to mammals.
