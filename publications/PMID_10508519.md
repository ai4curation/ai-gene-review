Muscle contraction results from the force generated between the thin filament 
protein actin and the thick filament protein myosin, which causes the thick and 
thin muscle filaments to slide past each other. There are skeletal muscle, 
cardiac muscle, smooth muscle and non-muscle isoforms of both actin and myosin. 
Inherited diseases in humans have been associated with defects in cardiac actin 
(dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), cardiac myosin 
(hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and non-muscle myosin (deafness). Here we report 
that mutations in the human skeletal muscle alpha-actin gene (ACTA1) are 
associated with two different muscle diseases, 'congenital myopathy with excess 
of thin myofilaments' (actin myopathy) and nemaline myopathy. Both diseases are 
characterized by structural abnormalities of the muscle fibres and variable 
degrees of muscle weakness. We have identified 15 different missense mutations 
resulting in 14 different amino acid changes. The missense mutations in ACTA1 
are distributed throughout all six coding exons, and some involve known 
functional domains of actin. Approximately half of the patients died within 
their first year, but two female patients have survived into their thirties and 
have children. We identified dominant mutations in all but 1 of 14 families, 
with the missense mutations being single and heterozygous. The only family 
showing dominant inheritance comprised a 33-year-old affected mother and her two 
affected and two unaffected children. In another family, the clinically 
unaffected father is a somatic mosaic for the mutation seen in both of his 
affected children. We identified recessive mutations in one family in which the 
two affected siblings had heterozygous mutations in two different exons, one 
paternally and the other maternally inherited. We also identified de novo 
mutations in seven sporadic probands for which it was possible to analyse 
parental DNA.
