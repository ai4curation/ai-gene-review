Programmed cell death protein 5 (PDCD5) has been proposed to act as a 
pro-apoptotic factor and tumor suppressor. However, the mechanisms underlying 
its apoptotic function are largely unknown. A proteomics search for binding 
partners of phosducin-like protein, a co-chaperone for the cytosolic chaperonin 
containing tailless complex polypeptide 1 (CCT), revealed a robust interaction 
between PDCD5 and CCT. PDCD5 formed a complex with CCT and β-tubulin, a key 
CCT-folding substrate, and specifically inhibited β-tubulin folding. 
Cryo-electron microscopy studies of the PDCD5·CCT complex suggested a possible 
mechanism of inhibition of β-tubulin folding. PDCD5 bound the apical domain of 
the CCTβ subunit, projecting above the folding cavity without entering it. Like 
PDCD5, β-tubulin also interacts with the CCTβ apical domain, but a second site 
is found at the sensor loop deep within the folding cavity. These orientations 
of PDCD5 and β-tubulin suggest that PDCD5 sterically interferes with β-tubulin 
binding to the CCTβ apical domain and inhibits β-tubulin folding. Given the 
importance of tubulins in cell division and proliferation, PDCD5 might exert its 
apoptotic function at least in part through inhibition of β-tubulin folding.
