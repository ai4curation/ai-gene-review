Neural tube defects (NTDs) are a heterogeneous group of common severe congenital 
anomalies which affect 1-2 infants per 1000 births. Most genetic and/or 
environmental factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of human NTDs are 
unknown. Recently, however, pathogenic mutations of VANGL1 and VANGL2 genes have 
been associated with some cases of human NTDs. Vangl genes encode proteins of 
the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway that regulates cell behavior during early 
stages of neural tube formation. Homozygous disruption of PCP genes in mice 
results in a spectrum of NTDs, including defects that affect the entire neural 
axis (craniorachischisis), cranial NTDs (exencephaly) and spina bifida. In this 
paper, we report the dynamic expression of another PCP gene, Fuzzy, during 
neural tube formation in mice. We also identify non-synonymous Fuzzy amino acid 
substitutions in some patients with NTDs and demonstrate that several of these 
Fuzzy mutations affect formation of primary cilia and ciliary length or affect 
directional cell movement. Since Fuzzy knockout mice exhibit both NTDs and 
defective primary cilia and Fuzzy is expressed in the emerging neural tube, we 
propose that mutations in Fuzzy may account for a subset of NTDs in humans.
