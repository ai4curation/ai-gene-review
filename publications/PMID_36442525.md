AIMS: Aberrant overactivation/overexpression of NRF2 is implicated as a driving 
event in tumor progression, which has been attributed to its mutation or 
inactivation of the inhibitory protein, KEAP1. However, alternative mechanisms 
responsible for sustained activation of NRF2 are less understood.
MAIN METHODS: Human colon cancer cell lines and tissues obtained from colorectal 
cancer (CRC) patients were used. To examine the expression levels of ARD1 and 
NRF2, Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses were performed. To 
investigate the potential relevance of NRF2 and ARD1 to human CRC, NRF2 and ARD1 
were individually silenced in human colon cancer cells (HCT-116) by transfection 
with their specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). To determine the functional 
role of ARD1 in NRF2 regulation, in situ proximate ligation, 
co-immunoprecipitation, nano-LC-ESI MS/MS, and in vitro acetylation assays were 
performed.
KEY FINDINGS: ARD1 knockdown in human colon cancer cell lines significantly 
reduced the protein levels of NRF2 without affecting its mRNA expression; 
however, silencing of NRF2 did not alter ARD1 protein expression. In addition, 
these two proteins were co-localized and physically interacted with each other 
both in human colon cancer cells (HCT-116) and human colon tumor tissues. 
Mechanistically, ARD1 overexpression increased the acetylation levels of NRF2. 
Moreover, an in vitro acetylation assay and mass spectrometric analysis 
demonstrated that ARD1 could directly acetylate NRF2. Ectopic expression of 
mutant forms of ARD1 with defective acetyltransferase activity reduced the 
stability of NRF2.
SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, ARD1 may potentiate the oncogenic function of NRF2 
in human colon cancer by stabilizing this transcription factor.
