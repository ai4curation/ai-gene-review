PURPOSE: Ionising radiation (IR) can evoke a series of biochemical events inside 
the cell. However, whether IR can directly induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
stress is not clear. In our previous study, we found that there might be a 
causative link between IR and ER stress. In this study, we further characterised 
the type of ER stress induced by IR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat intestinal epithelial cells IEC-6 were irradiated at 
a dose of 10 Gy, and total RNA and proteins were harvested at indicated time 
points. The mRNA and protein expression of immunoglobulin heavy chain binding 
protein (BiP) and glucose regulated protein 94 (GRP94) was detected along with 
proteins associated with ER stress signal pathways.
RESULTS: Our results indicated that IR induced up-regulation of ER stress marker 
including BiP and GRP94 at protein and mRNA levels in IEC-6 cells. Increased 
phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) and 
induced mRNA splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) suggested that PERK 
(interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PRKR) -like 
endoplasmic reticulum kinase) and IRE1 (inositol requirement 1) signal 
transduction pathways were involved in this kind of ER stress. However, the 
active form of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) did not change 
significantly in irradiated cells, which suggested that the ATF6 pathway was not 
involved.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we concluded that IR could induce moderate ER stress directly 
in IEC-6 cells.
