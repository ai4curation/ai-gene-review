Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) have long been thought to play a role in 
tumor suppression due to their ability to antagonize the growth promoting 
protein tyrosine kinases. Recently, a candidate tumor suppressor from 10q23, 
termed P-TEN, was isolated, and sequence homology was demonstrated with members 
of the PTP family, as well as the cytoskeletal protein tensin. Here we show that 
recombinant P-TEN dephosphorylated protein and peptide substrates phosphorylated 
on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, indicating that P-TEN is a 
dual-specificity phosphatase. In addition, P-TEN exhibited a high degree of 
substrate specificity, showing selectivity for extremely acidic substrates in 
vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mutations in P-TEN, identified from 
primary tumors, tumor cells lines, and a patient with Bannayan-Zonana syndrome, 
resulted in the ablation of phosphatase activity, demonstrating that enzymatic 
activity of P-TEN is necessary for its ability to function as a tumor 
suppressor.

Abstract

Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) have long been thought to play a role in tumor suppression due to their ability to antagonize the growth promoting protein tyrosine kinases. Recently, a candidate tumor suppressor from 10q23, termed P-TEN, was isolated, and sequence homology was demonstrated with members of the PTP family, as well as the cytoskeletal protein tensin. Here we show that recombinant P-TEN dephosphorylated protein and peptide substrates phosphorylated on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, indicating that P-TEN is a dual-specificity phosphatase. In addition, P-TEN exhibited a high degree of substrate specificity, showing selectivity for extremely acidic substrates in vitro . Furthermore, we demonstrate that mutations in P-TEN, identified from primary tumors, tumor cells lines, and a patient with Bannayan–Zonana syndrome, resulted in the ablation of phosphatase activity, demonstrating that enzymatic activity of P-TEN is necessary for its ability to function as a tumor suppressor.

RESULTS

Although P-TEN displays structural features of members of the PTP family of enzymes an important, and essential, step toward understanding the function of P-TEN is the characterization of its enzymatic activity. To test whether P-TEN encodes an active phosphatase, we expressed it as a fusion protein in E. coli . As a control, we assayed all substrates with a mutant of P-TEN in which the essential cysteine from the signature motif had been mutated to serine (P-TENC124S). This mutant would be expected to be catalytically inactive, and ensures that any activity seen was the result of P-TEN and not of a copurifying bacterial phosphatase.

DISCUSSION

The most common chromosomal deletion in glioblastoma occurs around 10q22-23, suggesting the presence of a tumor suppressor at this locus ( 26 ). Mapping of the deletions at 10q22-23, as well as representational difference analysis ( 27 ), led to the identification of P-TEN as the tumor suppressor residing at this locus ( 4 , 5 ). P-TEN shares sequence homology with the cytoskeletal protein tensin and with the family of PTPs ( 4 , 5 ). A substantial fraction of all glioblastoma samples tested have either deleted or mutated P-TEN alleles. In addition, P-TEN has been shown to be disrupted in a large number of breast and prostate tumor samples ( 4 , 5 ). Importantly, germ-line mutations in P-TEN give rise to a variety of genetic disorders, most notably Cowden disease, a disorder characterized by the formation of multiple benign tumors (hamartomas), as well as an increased susceptibility to malignant cancers of the breast and thyroid ( 28 ), confirming that P-TEN functions similarly to classical tumor-suppressor genes ( 8 ). Significantly, many of the mutations isolated from tumor samples, as well as from Cowden disease and Bannayan–Zonana syndrome, were predicted to disrupt the phosphatase domain of P-TEN. These studies, however, did not address whether P-TEN is a functional phosphatase or whether these mutations abrogate activity.

To address these issues, we measured the enzymatic activity of recombinant P-TEN. Initially, we were frustrated by the low activity of the fusion proteins when assayed with proteins that are commonly used as PTP substrates, such as RCML or MBP. Recently, another group has also reported weak phosphatase activity when RCML was used as a substrate ( 29 ). However, we demonstrate that P-TEN exhibits robust phosphatase activity when assayed with a random copolymer of glutamate and tyrosine, polyGlu 4 Tyr 1 , suggesting that it exhibits an unusual substrate specificity. P-TEN did not efficiently dephosphorylate the acidic peptide EDNDYINASL, suggesting that the presence of acidic residues may not be sufficient to create an optimal substrate and that higher order structures, such as those found in protein substrates, may be required.

On the basis of the presence of the “AYLL/M” motif found in many dual-specificity phosphatases, as well as the absence of some of the sequence motifs found in PTPs, particularly those that contribute to creating a deep, substrate-binding cleft ( 30 ), one would predict that P-TEN is a dual-specificity phosphatase. P-TEN was shown to exhibit activity against serine/threonine, as well as tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Table 1 ), verifying that it is a dual-specificity phosphatase. Like the tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates, P-TEN dephosphorylated only the most acidic serine/threonine-phosphorylated substrates tested. Even the best serine/threonine substrates, the ETE and DSD peptides, were not as efficiently dephosphorylated as polyGlu 4 Tyr 1 (Table 1 ). Casein, phosphorylated by casein kinase II, was dephosphorylated poorly by P-TEN (Table 1 and Fig. 2 ), suggesting that P-TEN may require multiple acidic residues positioned both N and C terminally to the phosphorylated residue. It is currently unclear if the apparent amino acid selectivity of P-TEN is an intrinsic characteristic or if it is caused by differences in the affinity of P-TEN for polyGlu 4 Tyr 1 and the ETE or DSD peptides, and may reflect a preference for protein over peptide substrates.

Mutations that occur in P-TEN during tumorigenesis fall into three large classes: ( i ) genomic deletions encompassing all or most of P-TEN, ( ii ) frameshift mutations resulting in the production of truncated P-TEN proteins, and ( iii ) point mutations resulting in the substitution of one amino acid for another ( 4 , 5 ). We have chosen to introduce a variety of the point mutations found in tumor samples into P-TEN, because they are less likely than the frameshift deletions to cause unpredictable changes in the conserved secondary structure found in all PTPs ( 30 ). Comparisons of P-TEN with other phosphatases, whose crystal structures have been solved, aids in predicting how these point mutations might disrupt P-TEN activity. For example, the mutation of His-123 → Tyr (H123Y) and Gly-129 → Arg, two residues located in the catalytic motif, resulted in the complete loss of phosphatase activity. One would have predicted that the H123Y mutation, detected in an endometrial cancer, would be catastrophic to activity because of the critical importance of this histidine in correctly orienting the catalytic cysteine so it can act as a nucleophile ( 11 ). Although, Gly-129 is not as highly conserved as other residues found in the catalytic motif, the substitution of the large, positively charged side chain of arginine, a mutation found in a glioblastoma cell line, for the much smaller glycine, is likely to have a deleterious effect on the overall structure of the phosphate-binding loop and is likely to impede the binding of phosphate. In contrast, a mutation that was identified in a prostate tumor cell line, in which Met-134 was changed to Leu (M134L), had no effect on P-TEN activity. However, among the dual-specificity phosphatases, leucine is commonly found at this position ( 25 ), suggesting that the M134L allele may represent a naturally occurring polymorphism rather than a mutation.

Several other mutations that reside outside of the catalytic motif were also tested for their effect on P-TEN activity. A point mutation discovered in a glioblastoma sample that changes Leu-57 → Trp (L57W) also eliminated P-TEN phosphatase activity. This amino acid is located in a conserved α-helix (α2), which is found in both PTP1B and VHR. Although not directly involved in catalysis, this helix helps form the overall secondary structure of the enzyme ( 14 , 15 ). Similarly, mutation of residues in this helix of LAR, a receptor PTP, also resulted in a significant loss of phosphatase activity ( 31 ). A second cluster of point mutations was discovered in the last conserved structural motif found in most PTPs and dual-specificity phosphatases, which also is an α-helix ( 14 , 15 ). In YopH, a PTP isolated from the causative agent of bubonic plague, a hydrophobic residue in this α-helix is important for coordinating the water molecule necessary for regenerating the active enzyme ( 15 ). All three mutations found in this region—Gly-165 → Arg (found in a glioblastoma), Thr-167 → Pro (found in a breast cancer), and Ser-70 → Arg (found in a patient with a Bannayan–Zonana syndrome)—resulted in the loss of P-TEN activity. The G165R and the S170R mutations would result in substitution of relatively small, uncharged amino acids for a much larger positively charged residue, potentially disrupting important interactions between this α-helix and surrounding structures. Moreover, the substitution of Thr-167 → Pro is also likely to disrupt these interactions by interrupting the proper folding of this α-helix. These data indicate that this conserved helix (α7 in YopH and VHR) is a required motif in the dual-specificity phosphatases.

All of the mutations tested were derived from tumor samples that, with two exceptions, resulted in the complete loss of, or greatly reduced, enzymatic activity of P-TEN, even when the mutations resided well outside of the conserved catalytic motif. These observations indicate that the inhibition of enzymatic activity was required for the progression of these cells to a cancerous state.

M134L was one of two mutations found in which activity was not lost. However, leucine is commonly found at this position in other dual-specificity phosphatases ( 25 ) and the wild-type allele was not lost in the tumor from which this mutation derived. Hence, M134L is likely to be a naturally occurring polymorphism.

We were surprised by the finding that the G129E mutation, a mutation found in the germ line of patients suffering from Cowden disease, did not disrupt P-TEN activity, whereas a mutation of this same residue to arginine (found in a glioblastoma) ablated P-TEN activity. Although we were unable to detect a change in the activity of P-TEN carrying the G129E mutation, it is likely that this mutation effects the ability of P-TEN to function in vivo , as this mutation has been isolated from two independent Cowden disease kindreds but not from unaffected patients ( 8 ). Moreover, deletions of the wild-type allele were found in the tumors that develop in this Cowden disease kindred ( 8 ). Although the G129E mutation does not effect activity when measured in vitro using artificial substrates, this mutation may interfere with the ability of P-TEN to dephosphorylate its physiological targets. Furthermore, this mutation may decrease the stability or half-life of P-TEN in the complex environment of the mammalian cell. A full understanding of the effects of this mutation on P-TEN will require the identification of its physiological substrates, regulators and perhaps even the elucidation of the structural changes elicited by this amino acid substitution.

Even though the sample size is small, there does appear to be a correlation between the severity in the disruption of P-TEN activity and the pathology of the disease. In contrast to the G129E mutation, the S170R mutation exhibited a significant reduction in activity and was isolated from a patient suffering from a severe disorder, Bannayan–Zonana, that shares many features with Cowden disease, but also manifests additional pathologies, including early onset of the disease at birth ( 9 ).

To understand how P-TEN functions as tumor suppressor, it will be necessary to identify its physiological substrates. Most dual-specificity phosphatases dephosphorylate and inactivate the MAP kinases ( 13 , 23 , 24 ), and moreover, the MAP kinases are found to be hyperphosphorylated in breast cancer ( 32 ), a cancer that frequently contains P-TEN mutations or deletions ( 8 ). Therefore, we tested if P-TEN could dephosphorylate the MAP kinase ERK2. However, our data indicate that P-TEN was incapable of dephosphorylating ERK2 in vitro , strongly suggesting that the MAP kinases are not regulated by P-TEN in vivo . Thus, the physiological substrates of P-TEN are still unknown. The unique substrate specificity of P-TEN, however, should aid in identifying its in vivo substrates. Importantly, the requirement for acidic residues may be satisfied by the presence of phosphorylated residues, suggesting that multiply phosphorylated proteins may serve as P-TEN substrates.
