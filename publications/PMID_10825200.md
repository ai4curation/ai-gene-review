Interleukin-2 (IL-2) activates several different families of tyrosine kinases, 
but precisely how these kinases interact is not completely understood. We 
therefore investigated the functional relationships among Jak3, Lck, and Syk in 
IL-2 signaling. We first observed that in the absence of Jak3, both Lck and Syk 
had the capacity to phosphorylate Stat3 and Stat5a. However, neither supported 
IL-2-induced STAT activation, nor did dominant negative alleles of these kinases 
inhibit. Moreover, pharmacological abrogation of Lck activity did not inhibit 
IL-2-mediated phosphorylation of Jak3 and Stat5a. Importantly, ligand-dependent 
Syk activation was dependent on the presence of catalytically active Jak3, 
whereas Lck activation was not. Interestingly, Syk functioned as a direct 
substrate of Jak1 but not Jak3. Additionally, Jak3 phosphorylated Jak1, whereas 
the reverse was not the case. Taken together, our data support a model in which 
Lck functions in parallel with Jak3, while Syk functions as a downstream element 
of Jaks in IL-2 signaling. Jak3 may regulate Syk catalytic activity indirectly 
via Jak1. However, IL-2-mediated Jak3/Stat activation is not dependent on Lck or 
Syk. While the essential roles of Jak1 and Jak3 in signaling by gammac-utilizing 
cytokines are clear, it will be important to dissect the exact contributions of 
Lck and Syk in mediating the effects of IL-2 and related cytokines.

Jak3 may regulate Syk catalytic activity indirectly via Jak1. However, IL-2-mediated Jak3/Stat activation is not dependent on Lck or Syk. While the essential roles of Jak1 and Jak3 in signaling by Î³c-utilizing cytokines are clear, it will be important to dissect the exact contributions of Lck and Syk in mediating the effects of IL-2 and related cytokines.
