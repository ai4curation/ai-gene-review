Long-lived organisms tend to be more resistant to various forms of environmental 
stress. An example is the Drosophila longevity mutant, methuselah, which has 
enhanced resistance to heat, oxidants, and starvation. To identify genes 
regulated by these three stresses, we made a cDNA library for each by 
subtraction of "unstressed" from "stressed" cDNA and used DNA hybridization to 
identify genes that are regulated by all three. This screen indeed identified 13 
genes, some already known to be involved in longevity, plus candidate genes. Two 
of these, hsp26 and hsp27, were chosen to test for their effects on lifespan by 
generating transgenic lines and by using the upstream activating sequence/GAL4 
system. Overexpression of either hsp26 or hsp27 extended the mean lifespan by 
30%, and the flies also displayed increased stress resistance. The results 
demonstrate that multiple-stress screening can be used to identify new longevity 
genes.
