MDM4 is a key regulator of p53, whose biological activities depend on both 
transcriptional activity and transcription-independent mitochondrial functions. 
MDM4 binds to p53 and blocks its transcriptional activity; however, the main 
cytoplasmic localization of MDM4 might also imply a regulation of 
p53-mitochondrial function. Here, we show that MDM4 stably localizes at the 
mitochondria, in which it (i) binds BCL2, (ii) facilitates mitochondrial 
localization of p53 phosphorylated at Ser46 (p53Ser46(P)) and (iii) promotes 
binding between p53Ser46(P) and BCL2, release of cytochrome C and apoptosis. In 
agreement with these observations, MDM4 reduction by RNA interference increases 
resistance to DNA-damage-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner and 
independently of transcription. Consistent with these findings, a significant 
downregulation of MDM4 expression associates with cisplatin resistance in human 
ovarian cancers, and MDM4 modulation affects cisplatin sensitivity of ovarian 
cancer cells. These data define a new localization and function of MDM4 that, by 
acting as a docking site for p53Ser46(P) to BCL2, facilitates the p53-mediated 
intrinsic-apoptotic pathway. Overall, our results point to MDM4 as a 
double-faced regulator of p53.

Abstract

MDM4 is a key regulator of p53, whose biological activities depend on both transcriptional activity and transcription-independent mitochondrial functions. MDM4 binds to p53 and blocks its transcriptional activity; however, the main cytoplasmic localization of MDM4 might also imply a regulation of p53-mitochondrial function. Here, we show that MDM4 stably localizes at the mitochondria, in which it (i) binds BCL2, (ii) facilitates mitochondrial localization of p53 phosphorylated at Ser46 (p53Ser46 P ) and (iii) promotes binding between p53Ser46 P and BCL2, release of cytochrome C and apoptosis. In agreement with these observations, MDM4 reduction by RNA interference increases resistance to DNA-damage-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner and independently of transcription. Consistent with these findings, a significant downregulation of MDM4 expression associates with cisplatin resistance in human ovarian cancers, and MDM4 modulation affects cisplatin sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells. These data define a new localization and function of MDM4 that, by acting as a docking site for p53Ser46 P to BCL2, facilitates the p53-mediated intrinsic-apoptotic pathway. Overall, our results point to MDM4 as a double-faced regulator of p53.

Introduction

MDM4, formerly named MDMX, is an inhibitor of p53 with in vitro and in vivo oncogenic potential ( Marine et al , 2006 , 2007 ; Toledo and Wahl, 2006 ). The relevance of MDM4 regulation of p53 has been established by the Mdm4 knock-out (KO) mice ( Parant et al , 2001 ; Finch et al , 2002 ; Migliorini et al , 2002a ). These animals show embryonic lethality, but have a normal development when simultaneously deleted for Trp53 gene.

Different models have been proposed to explain the activity of MDM4 towards p53, particularly to distinguish MDM4 from its analogue MDM2, the best characterized negative regulator of p53. As the most evident phenotype of Mdm4- KO mice is a generalized cell cycle arrest ( Parant et al , 2001 ; Migliorini et al , 2002a ), MDM4 has been considered as a negative regulator of p53 growth arresting function ( Parant et al , 2001 ). Conversely, the control of p53-apoptotic function has been attributed to MDM2 because of the presence of early embryonic cell death in Mdm2 -KO mice ( Jones et al , 1995 ; Montes de Oca-Luna et al , 1995 ). This model, therefore, attributes the control of distinct activities of p53 to different proteins. In contrast to this, a second model is based on the evidence that MDM4 and MDM2 efficiently associate and regulate each other's function. It has been proposed that the interdependence of the two MDM proteins is the basis for the negative non-overlapping regulation of p53 ( Gu et al , 2002 ; Wade and Wahl, 2009 ). The presence of apoptosis in Mdm4 -KO mice in neuronal progenitors ( Migliorini et al , 2002a ; Francoz et al , 2006 ; Xiong et al , 2006 ), an increased transcription of some p53 targets genes ( Francoz et al , 2006 ; Toledo et al , 2006 ; Xiong et al , 2006 ), have raised a third hypothesis: MDM4 controls the transcriptional function of p53, whereas MDM2 controls its protein levels ( Francoz et al , 2006 ; Toledo et al , 2006 ). All these models apply mainly to the regulation of p53 in unstressed conditions and/or during the mouse development, although some data also extend them to stressing situations ( Toledo et al , 2006 ).

After DNA damage, MDM4 protein levels are downregulated by MDM2-degradative activity ( Kawai et al , 2003 ; Pan and Chen, 2003 ; Pereg et al , 2005 ). The dissociation of deubiquitylating enzyme HAUSP from the MDM4â€“MDM2 complex is the primary event ( Meulmeester et al , 2005 ), whereas the increase in MDM2 levels by p53-mediated transcription reinforces this mechanism ( Toledo and Wahl, 2006 ). In agreement with the model of MDM4 as a negative regulator of p53, these events contribute to the release of p53 activity by MDM4 inhibition.

However, a few data have suggested additional activities of MDM4. Survival and proliferation of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) overexpressing Mdm2, plated at low density, are suppressed by the presence of Mdm4. Accordingly, the rate of tumour formation is accelerated in Mdm2 transgenic mice lacking both Mdm4 alleles in comparison to the mice having both alleles ( Steinman et al , 2005 ). Further, both overexpressed and endogenous MDM4 stabilize active p53 by counteracting its MDM2-mediated degradation ( Jackson and Berberich, 2000 ; Stad et al , 2000 ; Barboza et al , 2008 ), and overexpressed MDM4 promotes p53-mediated apoptosis in stressing conditions ( Mancini et al , 2004 ). These data suggest a conflicting activity between MDM4 and MDM2 under some circumstances. As on severe genotoxic stress MDM2 levels and/or activity remain low or even decrease ( Ashcroft et al , 2000 ; Latonen et al , 2001 ; Marchenko et al , 2007 ; Rinaldo et al , 2007 ), we have investigated the function exerted by MDM4 under these conditions. Particularly, as MDM4 is mainly a cytoplasmic protein, we studied its effect on the cytoplasmic function of p53, specifically the transcription-independent mitochondrial apoptosis.

Here, we show that a fraction of the MDM4 protein stably resides at the mitochondria, in which, on a lethal type of stress, it promotes (i) the recruitment of the p53 phosphorylated on Ser46, (ii) its binding to BCL2 and (iii) the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) with release of cytochrome C. Overall, our data point to a novel role of MDM4 as a positive regulator of p53-intrinsic apoptosis.

Discussion

The present study describes a new localization for MDM4 at the mitochondria in which it binds BCL2, and provides evidence that MDM4 acts as a mitochondrial anchor for p53Ser46 P and facilitates p53-intrinsic-apoptotic pathway.

The MDM4 localization at the mitochondria is stable one, is unaffected by genotoxic stress ( Figure 1 ) and is seemingly mediated by the MDM4 COOH terminus where the Ring Finger (RF) domain is located ( Figure 2 ). These data are in agreement with observations by Migliorini et al , who showed that deletion of the MDM4 C-terminal domain causes redistribution of the MDM4 protein to the nucleus and its decreased presence in the cytoplasm ( Migliorini et al , 2002b ). Our data suggest that mitochondrial MDM4 is not associated with MDM2. Indeed, we never observed the latter protein at the mitochondria. As MDM2 interacts with MDM4 through the RF domain ( Sharp et al , 1999 ; Tanimura et al , 1999 ), the engagement of this domain in the association of MDM4 with the mitochondria might prevent MDM2 binding.

Our data are compatible with mitochondrial MDM4 being located in the internal compartments of these organelles. Indeed, MDM4 is protected from enzyme degradation ( Figure 1D and E ). Its binding to BCL2 ( Figure 5 ), which is tail anchored to the outer mitochondrial membrane, suggests that MDM4 is located in the outer membrane. Mitochondrial MDM4 does not apparently function as an anchor for BCL2 as its depletion does not alter the presence of BCL2 at the mitochondria ( Figure 5E and G ). In contrast to this, MDM4 binds to and relocalizes p53 at the mitochondria. It remains to ascertain whether MDM4 contacts the enzyme-protected mitochondrial fraction of p53 or the p53 fraction externally associated with the mitochondria, similarly to the association of p53 with the integral mitochondrial protein Bak ( Leu et al , 2004 ).

Although overexpression experiments indicate that p53 relocalization at the mitochondria mainly correlates with the total p53 levels, reduction of endogenous MDM4 causes a specific decrease of levels of mitochondrial p53 and particularly of the p53Ser46 P ( Figure 7 ), suggesting that MDM4 may function as an anchor for this phosphorylated form at BCL2. Indeed, association of p53S46D with BCL2 is strongly enhanced by the presence of MDM4 ( Figure 6A ). As our data indicate that unmodified MDM4 binds with similar affinity unphosphorylated and phosphorylated p53Ser46 (data not shown), it may be hypothesized that the selectivity towards the p53Ser46 P form resides in the MDM4/Bcl2 complex. It remains to ascertain whether MDM4 directly modifies the levels of this phosphorylated protein or the mitochondrial association of p53Ser46 P with BCL2 affects its stability.

Overall, our data support a role for mitochondrial MDM4 fraction in sustaining its proapoptotic function. Indeed, the requirement of physical interaction between MDM4 and p53 to promote p53/BCL2 association ( Supplementary Figure 5B ), and of the MDM4 presence for the association of endogenous mitochondrial p53 with BCL2, confirms this hypothesis. In addition, experiments with isolated mitochondria re-expressing MDM4 ( Figure 4G and H ) support the role of mitochondrial MDM4 in promoting p53-mediated intrinsic apoptosis.

Our data further indicate that p53Ser46 P is a preferential partner for BCL2 and a more active form in promoting p53-intrinsic apoptosis ( Figure 6A and B ). Thus far, analysis of post-translational modifications of mitochondrial p53 has shown the presence of p53Ser46 P at this subcellular site ( Nemajerova et al , 2005 ). However, the ability of different p53 modifications to mediate the intrinsic-apoptotic pathway has not been tested. Interestingly, the mitochondrial protein WOX1, a WW domain-containing oxidoreductase, was shown to selectively bind p53Ser46 P , conferring cell sensitivity to apoptotic stress ( Chang et al , 2005 ). In addition, Feng et al reported a significant decrease of thymocite apoptosis in transgenic mice carrying the human mutant p53S46A ( Feng et al , 2006 ). As thymus is a tissue in which p53 exerts an important mitochondrial function ( Moll et al , 2005 ), these data support a role of p53Ser46 P in mitochondrial apoptosis.

Overall, our data indicate a positive activity exerted by MDM4 towards p53-intrinsic apoptosis. This finding apparently contradicts two properties so far known for MDM4: (i) a negative regulation of p53 and (ii) its inactivation during the stress response aimed to release p53 activity ( Marine et al , 2006 , 2007 ; Toledo and Wahl, 2006 ). Although different models have been proposed to explain the negative regulation exerted by MDM4 towards p53, they generally apply to regulation under basal or sublethal conditions. Indeed, the antagonistic function of MDM4 towards cell viability concurs often with highly increased levels of MDM2 and p21, events resembling a growth arrest response ( Gilkes et al , 2006 ). On the contrary, the data here reported refer to a function of MDM4 under lethal genotoxic stress, particularly in the p53-intrinsic-apoptotic pathway. In this respect, they are in agreement with the positive effect of overexpressed MDM4 towards p53-mediated apoptosis ( Mancini et al , 2004 ). They might also be considered consistent with the strong apoptotic response observed in Mdm2 -KO mice ( Chavez-Reyes et al , 2003 ). Indeed, although the relevance in vivo of p53-intrinsic apoptosis in the general apoptotic process has not been quantified, cell death in Mdm2 -KO mice might be also caused by the persistence or even the increase of mitochondrial MDM4 and by its ability to promote p53-mitochondrial apoptosis. Of note, MDM4 levels are higher in the thymus, a tissue in which p53 exerts an important mitochondrial function ( Shvarts et al , 1997 ; Moll et al , 2005 ).

With respect to the inactivation of MDM4 occurring during the stress responses, this has been tightly associated with the activation of the degradative activity of MDM2 ( Marine et al , 2007 ). However, various evidences suggest distinct activities of MDM2 under different stress conditions. Indeed, on a sublethal type of damage usually associated with a growth arrest, MDM2 levels are strongly increased. On the contrary, on a lethal damage leading to an apoptotic outcome, MDM2 levels do not increase or even decline ( Ashcroft et al , 2000 ; Latonen et al , 2001 ; Meng et al , 2007 ; Rinaldo et al , 2007 ). Destabilization of the MDM2 protein caused by increased autodegradation after DNA damage has also been described, although the type of cell response associated with it has not been established ( Stommel and Wahl, 2004 ; Tang et al , 2006 ). Finally, impairment of MDM2-degradative activity towards specific proapoptotic targets has also been suggested. Marchenko et al have shown a decrease of MDM2-mediated polyubiquitylation of p53 during the apoptosis ( Marchenko et al , 2007 ). In agreement with all these data, a recent model considers the upregulation of MDM2 during the growth arrest, an event favouring this cell response in respect to cell death ( Shmueli and Oren, 2007 ). In agreement with this model, we observe a strong decrease of MDM2 expression in MCF7 cells after a lethal dose of UV ( Figure 7A ).

MDM4 degradation is also associated with its nuclear translocation and binding to 14-3-3 proteins ( Jin et al , 2006 ; LeBron et al , 2006 ; Pereg et al , 2006 ). In view of a role of MDM4 in the intrinsic apoptosis, an additional interpretation for these observations may be also provided. Both these events may sequester MDM4 from the cytoplasmic pool and consequently from the mitochondrial site, thus preventing p53-proapoptotic activation when cell cycle arrest is required. In fact, 14-3-3 proteins are crucial apoptosis inhibitors that exert their function by binding and inactivating proapoptotic proteins involved in the mitochondrial pathway ( Porter et al , 2006 ).

Noteworthy, our findings indicate that MDM4-proapoptotic activity may have an in vivo relevance by affecting cell susceptibility to DNA-damage induced by cisplatin. Although these data need a confirmation in a large population study, their implication in predicting cancer response to therapy seems relevant.

Finally, the integration of MDM4 inhibition of cell cycle arrest with its proapoptotic function reported here supports and extends to MDM4 the new current model, based on the view of MDM2 as a p53 lifesaver ( Rinaldo et al , 2007 ; Shmueli and Oren, 2007 ), that points to p53 regulators as not only controllers of p53 activity but also important players in the p53-mediated decision between cell life and death.
