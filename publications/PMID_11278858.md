Spheroplasts were used to study the early interactions of newly synthesized 
outer membrane protein PhoE with periplasmic proteins employing a protein 
cross-linking approach. Newly translocated PhoE protein could be cross-linked to 
the periplasmic chaperone Skp at the periplasmic side of the inner membrane. To 
study the timing of this interaction, a PhoE-dihydrofolate reductase hybrid 
protein was constructed that formed translocation intermediates, which had the 
PhoE moiety present in the periplasm and the dihydrofolate reductase moiety 
tightly folded in the cytoplasm. The hybrid protein was found to cross-link to 
Skp, indicating that PhoE closely interacts with the chaperone when the protein 
is still in a transmembrane orientation in the translocase. Removal of 
N-terminal parts of PhoE protein affected Skp binding in a cumulative manner, 
consistent with the presence of two Skp-binding sites in that region. In 
contrast, deletion of C-terminal parts resulted in variable interactions with 
Skp, suggesting that interaction of Skp with the N-terminal region is influenced 
by parts of the C terminus of PhoE protein. Both the soluble as well as the 
membrane-associated Skp protein were found to interact with PhoE. The latter 
form is proposed to be involved in the initial interaction with the N-terminal 
regions of the outer membrane protein.
