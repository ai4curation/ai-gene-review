In this study, we examined the molecular and functional characterization of 
choline transporter in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). 
Choline uptake into hBMECs was a saturable process that was mediated by a 
Na(+)-independent, membrane potential and pH-dependent transport system. The 
cells have two different [(3)H]choline transport systems with Km values of 35.0 
± 4.9 μM and 54.1 ± 8.1 μM, respectively. Choline uptake was inhibited by 
choline, acetylcholine (ACh) and the choline analog hemicholinium-3 (HC-3). 
Various organic cations also interacted with the choline transport system. 
Choline transporter-like protein 1 (CTL1) and CTL2 mRNA were highly expressed, 
while mRNA for high-affinity choline transporter 1 (CHT1) and organic cation 
transporters (OCTs) were not expressed in hBMECs. CTL1 and CTL2 proteins were 
localized to brain microvascular endothelial cells in human brain cortical 
sections. Both CTL1 and CTL2 proteins were expressed on the plasma membrane and 
mitochondria. CTL1 and CTL2 proteins are mainly expressed in plasma membrane and 
mitochondria, respectively. We conclude that choline is mainly transported via 
an intermediate-affinity choline transport system, CTL1 and CTL2, in hBMECs. 
These transporters are responsible for the uptake of extracellular choline and 
organic cations. CTL2 participate in choline transport mainly in mitochondria, 
and may be the major site for the control of choline oxidation.
