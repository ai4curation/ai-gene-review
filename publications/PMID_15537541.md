The SCF ubiquitin ligase complex regulates diverse cellular functions by 
ubiquitinating numerous protein substrates. Cand1, a 120 kDa HEAT repeat 
protein, forms a tight complex with the Cul1-Roc1 SCF catalytic core, inhibiting 
the assembly of the multisubunit E3 complex. The crystal structure of the 
Cand1-Cul1-Roc1 complex shows that Cand1 adopts a highly sinuous superhelical 
structure, clamping around the elongated SCF scaffold protein Cul1. At one end, 
a Cand1 beta hairpin protrusion partially occupies the adaptor binding site on 
Cul1, inhibiting its interactions with the Skp1 adaptor and the 
substrate-recruiting F box protein subunits. At the other end, two Cand1 HEAT 
repeats pack against a conserved Cul1 surface cleft and bury a Cul1 lysine 
residue, whose modification by the ubiquitin-like protein, Nedd8, is able to 
block Cand1-Cul1 association. Together with biochemical evidence, these 
structural results elucidate the mechanisms by which Cand1 and Nedd8 regulate 
the assembly-disassembly cycles of SCF and other cullin-dependent E3 complexes.
