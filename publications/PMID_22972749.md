The tumor suppressor p53 is a homotetramer of 4 × 393 residues. Its core domain 
and tetramerization domain are linked and flanked by intrinsically disordered 
sequences, which hinder its full structural characterization. There is an 
outstanding problem of the state of the tetramerization domain. Structural 
studies on the isolated tetramerization domain show it is in a folded tetrameric 
conformation, but there are conflicting models from electron microscopy of the 
full-length protein, one of which proposes that the domain is not tetramerically 
folded and the tetrameric protein is stabilized by interactions between the N 
and C termini. Here, we present methyl-transverse relaxation optimized NMR 
spectroscopy (methyl-TROSY) investigations on the full-length and separate 
domains of the protein with its methionine residues enriched with (13)C to probe 
its quaternary structure. We obtained high-quality spectra of both the 
full-length tetrameric p53 and its DNA complex, observing the environment at 11 
specific methyl sites. The tetramerization domain was as tetramerically folded 
in the full-length constructs as in the isolated domain. The N and C termini 
were intrinsically disordered in both the full-length protein and its complex 
with a 20-residue specific DNA sequence. Additionally, we detected in the 
interface of the core (DNA-binding) and N-terminal parts of the protein a slow 
conformational exchange process that was modulated by specific recognition of 
DNA, indicating allosteric processes.

Abstract

The tumor suppressor p53 is a homotetramer of 4 × 393 residues. Its core domain and tetramerization domain are linked and flanked by intrinsically disordered sequences, which hinder its full structural characterization. There is an outstanding problem of the state of the tetramerization domain. Structural studies on the isolated tetramerization domain show it is in a folded tetrameric conformation, but there are conflicting models from electron microscopy of the full-length protein, one of which proposes that the domain is not tetramerically folded and the tetrameric protein is stabilized by interactions between the N and C termini. Here, we present methyl-transverse relaxation optimized NMR spectroscopy (methyl-TROSY) investigations on the full-length and separate domains of the protein with its methionine residues enriched with 13 C to probe its quaternary structure. We obtained high-quality spectra of both the full-length tetrameric p53 and its DNA complex, observing the environment at 11 specific methyl sites. The tetramerization domain was as tetramerically folded in the full-length constructs as in the isolated domain. The N and C termini were intrinsically disordered in both the full-length protein and its complex with a 20-residue specific DNA sequence. Additionally, we detected in the interface of the core (DNA-binding) and N-terminal parts of the protein a slow conformational exchange process that was modulated by specific recognition of DNA, indicating allosteric processes.

Conclusions

Methionine methyl labeling allowed us to record high-quality NMR spectra of tetrameric p53 and gave us an unprecedented opportunity to observe site specifically the environment and assess dynamics at 11 sites simultaneously. Using this approach, we were able to integrate previous NMR and biophysical studies on isolated p53 domains and extend the NMR studies to the full-length p53–DNA complex. Our data resolve conflicting models of p53 quaternary structure in favor of those that have tetrameric TET domains, and also reveal a previously unknown p53C–PRR interaction that occurs during DNA recognition. There are no significant deviations in chemical shifts of individual domains, apart from effects associated with formation of p53C primary dimers in tetrameric p53 constructs, and spectra of full-length protein are well-reproduced by superposition of individual domains. Thanks to the small number of methionines in the primary sequence, the NMR spectra of the full-length protein and DNA complex are simple and straightforward to interpret, and so encourage similar investigations of other p53 complexes as well as employing other methyl probes that cover areas not populated by methionines.

NMR Methods.

All spectra were recorded at 293 K on Bruker Avance II+ 700-MHz, Bruker Avance III 600-MHz, or Bruker Avance 800-MHz NMR spectrometers equipped with TXI cryoprobes. 1 H– 15 N and 1 H– 13 C correlations were obtained with 1 H– 15 N-fHSQC ( 37 ) and 1 H– 13 C-HMQC ( 38 ) experiments, respectively. For the full-length protein constructs, typically a 1,024- by 256-point matrix was recorded with 512 transients per row, giving a total experimental time of 72 h per spectrum. Relaxation dispersion spectra of a single-quantum– coherence were obtained according to Lundstrom et al. ( 39 ). Spectra were processed with Topspin 3.0 (Bruker) and plotted with Sparky 3.1 (University of California, San Francisco).
