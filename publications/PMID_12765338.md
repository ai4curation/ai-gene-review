High mobility group box 1 (HMGB), a ubiquitous DNA-binding protein, has been 
implicated as a proinflammatory cytokine and late mediator of lethal 
endotoxemia. HMGB1 is released by activated macrophages. It amplifies and 
extends the inflammatory response by inducing cytokine release and mediating 
acute lung injury, anorexia, and the inflammatory response to tissue necrosis. 
The kinetics of HMGB1 release provide a wide therapeutic window for endotoxemia 
because extracellular levels of HMGB1 begin to increase 12 to 24 h after 
exposure to inflammatory stimuli. Here, we demonstrate that a DNA-binding domain 
of HMGB1, the B box, recapitulates the cytokine activity of full length HMGB1 
and efficiently activates macrophages to release tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and 
other proinflammatory cytokines. Truncation of the B box revealed that the 
TNF-stimulating activity localizes to 20 amino acids (HMGB1 amino acids 89 to 
108). Passive immunization of mice with antibodies raised against B box 
conferred significant protection against lethal endotoxemia or sepsis, induced 
by cecal perforation. These results indicate that a proinflammatory domain of 
HMGB1 maps to the highly conserved DNA-binding B box, making this primary 
sequence a suitable target in the design of therapeutics.
