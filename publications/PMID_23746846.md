The GroEL/ES chaperonin system is required for the assisted folding of many 
proteins. How these substrate proteins are encapsulated within the GroEL-GroES 
cavity is poorly understood. Using symmetry-free, single-particle cryo-electron 
microscopy, we have characterized a chemically modified mutant of GroEL (EL43Py) 
that is trapped at a normally transient stage of substrate protein 
encapsulation. We show that the symmetric pattern of the GroEL subunits is 
broken as the GroEL cis-ring apical domains reorient to accommodate the 
simultaneous binding of GroES and an incompletely folded substrate protein 
(RuBisCO). The collapsed RuBisCO folding intermediate binds to the lower segment 
of two apical domains, as well as to the normally unstructured GroEL C-terminal 
tails. A comparative structural analysis suggests that the allosteric 
transitions leading to substrate protein release and folding involve concerted 
shifts of GroES and the GroEL apical domains and C-terminal tails.
