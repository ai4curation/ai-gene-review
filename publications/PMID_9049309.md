The oncogenic nucleoporin CAN/Nup214 is essential in vertebrate cells. Its 
depletion results in defective nuclear protein import, inhibition of messenger 
RNA export and cell cycle arrest. We recently found that CAN associates with 
proteins of 88 and 112 kDa, which we have now cloned and characterized. The 88 
kDa protein is a novel nuclear pore complex (NPC) component, which we have named 
Nup88. Depletion of CAN from the NPC results in concomitant loss of Nup88, 
indicating that the localization of Nup88 to the NPC is dependent on CAN 
binding. The 112 kDa protein is the human homologue of yeast CRM1, a protein 
known to be required for maintenance of correct chromosome structure. This human 
CRM1 (hCRM1) localized to the NPC as well as to the nucleoplasm. Nuclear 
overexpression of the FG-repeat region of CAN, containing its hCRM1-interaction 
domain, resulted in depletion of hCRM1 from the NPC. In CAN-/- mouse embryos 
lacking CAN, hCRM1 remained in the nuclear envelope, suggesting that this 
protein can also bind to other repeat-containing nucleoporins. Lastly, hCRM1 
shares a domain of significant homology with importin-beta, a cytoplasmic 
transport factor that interacts with nucleoporin repeat regions. We propose that 
hCRM1 is a soluble nuclear transport factor that interacts with the NPC.
