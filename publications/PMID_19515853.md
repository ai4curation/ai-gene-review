Meckel syndrome (MKS) is a lethal disorder characterized by renal cystic 
dysplasia, encephalocele, polydactyly and biliary dysgenesis. It is highly 
genetically heterogeneous with nine different genes implicated in this disorder. 
MKS is thought to be a ciliopathy because of the range of phenotypes and 
localization of some of the implicated proteins. However, limited data are 
available about the phenotypes associated with MKS1 and MKS3, and the published 
ciliary data are conflicting. Analysis of the wpk rat model of MKS3 revealed 
functional defects of the connecting cilium in the eye that resulted in lack of 
formation of the outer segment, whereas infertile wpk males developed spermatids 
with very short flagella that did not extend beyond the cell body. In wpk renal 
collecting duct cysts, cilia were generally longer than normal, with additional 
evidence of cells with multiple primary cilia and centrosome over-duplication. 
Kidney tissue and cells from MKS1 and MKS3 patients showed defects in centrosome 
and cilia number, including multi-ciliated respiratory-like epithelia, and 
longer cilia. Stable shRNA knockdown of Mks1 and Mks3 in IMCD3 cells induced 
multi-ciliated and multi-centrosomal phenotypes. These studies demonstrate that 
MKS1 and MKS3 are ciliopathies, with new cilia-related eye and sperm phenotypes 
defined. MKS1 and MKS3 functions are required for ciliary structure and 
function, including a role in regulating length and appropriate number through 
modulating centrosome duplication.
