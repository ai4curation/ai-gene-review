Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is caused by short expansions of the 
GCG trinucleotide repeat encoding the polyalanine tract of the poly(A)-binding 
protein 2 (PABP2). PABP2 binds to the growing poly(A) tail, stimulating its 
extension during the polyadenylation process, and limits the length of the newly 
synthesized poly(A) tail. Whereas PABP2 is expressed ubiquitously, the clinical 
and pathological features of OPMD patients are restricted to the skeletal 
muscle. To elucidate the possible role of PABP2 in skeletal muscle, we 
established the stable C2 cell lines expressing human PABP2. These stable cell 
lines showed morphologically enhanced myotube formation accompanied by an 
increased expression of myogenic factors, MyoD and myogenin. In nuclear run-on 
assay, the transcription rate of the MyoD gene was significantly increased by 
PABP2 transfection. We found the N-terminal region of PABP2 was responsible for 
the up-regulation of these myogenic factors. Furthermore, Ski-interacting 
protein (SKIP) was isolated as a binding protein for PABP2 using the yeast 
two-hybrid system. The interaction of PABP2 and SKIP was confirmed by 
glutathione S-transferase-pulldown assay and immunoprecipitation. Confocal laser 
scanning showed PABP2 was co-localized with SKIP in nuclear speckles. The 
reporter assays showed that PABP2 co-operated with SKIP to synergistically 
activate E-box-mediated transcription through MYOD: Moreover, both PABP2 and 
SKIP were directly associated with MyoD to form a single complex. These findings 
suggest that PABP2 and SKIP directly control the expression of muscle-specific 
genes at the transcription level.
