The sirtuin family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent (NAD) 
deacetylases plays an important role in aging and metabolic regulation. In 
yeast, the Sir2 gene and its homolog Hst2 independently mediate the action of 
caloric restriction on lifespan extension. The mammalian Sir2 ortholog, SIRT1, 
is up-regulated by caloric restriction and deacetylates a variety of substrates, 
including histones and the forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors. The 
mammalian ortholog of Hst2, SIRT2, was shown to co-localize with microtubules 
and functions as alpha-tubulin deacetylase. During G2/M phase, SIRT2 proteins 
enter nuclei and deacetylate histones. We report here that the expression of 
SIRT2 is elevated in the white adipose tissue and kidney of caloric-restricted 
mice. Oxidative stress, such as hydrogen peroxide treatment, also increases 
SIRT2 expression in cells. We have demonstrated that SIRT2 binds to FOXO3a and 
reduces its acetylation level. SIRT2 hence increases FOXO DNA binding and 
elevates the expression of FOXO target genes, p27(Kip1), manganese superoxide 
dismutase and Bim. As a consequence, SIRT2 decreases cellular levels of reactive 
oxygen species. Furthermore, as Bim is a pro-apoptotic factor, SIRT2 promotes 
cell death when cells are under severe stress. Therefore, mammalian SIRT2 
responds to caloric restriction and oxidative stress to deacetylate FOXO 
transcription factors.
