Amplification of 12q13-14 occurs in a subset of human sarcomas including 
malignant fibrous histiocytoma and liposarcoma. This chromosomal region has 
previously been found to include a number of growth-related genes including the 
GLI proto-oncogene and the p53-associated protein, MDM2. We now report the 
characterization of SAS (sarcoma amplified sequence), a novel transcript found 
in this region. Sequence analysis demonstrates that SAS is a novel member of a 
transmembrane protein family (transmembrane 4 superfamily or TM4SF) thought to 
be involved in growth-related cellular processes. This observation adds a TM4SF 
protein to the cluster of genes at 12q13-14 frequently amplified in human 
sarcomas.
