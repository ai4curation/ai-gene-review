CLN3 is an endosomal/lysosomal transmembrane protein mutated in classical 
juvenile onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a fatal inherited 
neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder. The function of CLN3 in 
endosomal/lysosomal events has remained elusive due to poor understanding of its 
interactions in these compartments. It has previously been shown that the 
localisation of late endosomal/lysosomal compartments is disturbed in cells 
expressing the most common disease-associated CLN3 mutant, CLN3∆ex7-8 
(c.462-677del). We report here that a protracted disease causing mutant, 
CLN3E295K, affects the properties of late endocytic compartments, since 
over-expression of the CLN3E295K mutant protein in HeLa cells induced 
relocalisation of Rab7 and a perinuclear clustering of late endosomes/lysosomes. 
In addition to the previously reported disturbances in the endocytic pathway, we 
now show that the anterograde transport of late endosomal/lysosomal compartments 
is affected in CLN3 deficiency. CLN3 interacted with motor components driving 
both plus and minus end microtubular trafficking: tubulin, dynactin, dynein and 
kinesin-2. Most importantly, CLN3 was found to interact directly with active, 
guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP)-bound Rab7 and with the Rab7-interacting 
lysosomal protein (RILP) that anchors the dynein motor. The data presented in 
this study provide novel insights into the role of CLN3 in late 
endosomal/lysosomal membrane transport.
