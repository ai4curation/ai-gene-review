The adenovirus E1A and SV40 large-T-antigen oncoproteins bind to members of the 
p300/CBP transcriptional coactivator family. Binding of p300/CBP is implicated 
in the transforming mechanisms of E1A and T-antigen oncoproteins. A common 
region of the T antigen is critical for binding both p300/CBP and the tumour 
suppressor p53, suggesting a link between the functions of p53 and p300. Here we 
report that p300/CBP binds to p53 in the absence of viral oncoproteins, and that 
p300 and p53 colocalize within the nucleus and coexist in a stable DNA-binding 
complex. Consistent with its ability to bind to p300, E1A disrupted functions 
mediated by p53. It reduced p53-mediated activation of the p21 and bax 
promoters, and suppressed p53-induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. We 
conclude that members of the p300/CBP family are transcriptional adaptors for 
p53, modulating its checkpoint function in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and 
its induction of apoptosis. Disruption of p300/p53-dependent growth control may 
be part of the mechanism by which E1A induces cell transformation. These results 
help to explain how p53 mediates growth and checkpoint control, and how members 
of the p300/CBP family affect progression from G1 to the S phase of the cell 
cycle.
