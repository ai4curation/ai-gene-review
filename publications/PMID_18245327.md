Chromatin-modifying factors regulate both transcription and DNA replication. The 
yFACT chromatin-reorganizing complex is involved in both processes, and the 
sensitivity of some yFACT mutants to the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) 
is one indication of a replication role. This HU sensitivity can be suppressed 
by disruptions of the SET2 or CHD1 genes, encoding a histone H3(K36) 
methyltransferase and a chromatin remodeling factor, respectively. The additive 
effect of set2 and chd1 mutations in suppressing the HU sensitivity of yFACT 
mutants suggests that these two factors function in separate pathways. The HU 
suppression is not an indirect effect of altered regulation of ribonucleotide 
reductase induced by HU. set2 and chd1 mutations also suppress the HU 
sensitivity of mutations in other genes involved in DNA replication, including 
CDC2, CTF4, ORC2, and MEC1. Additionally, a chd1 mutation can suppress the 
lethality normally caused by disruption of either MEC1 or RAD53 DNA damage 
checkpoint genes, as well as the lethality seen when a mec1 sml1 mutant is 
exposed to low levels of HU. The pob3 defect in S-phase progression is 
suppressed by set2 or chd1 mutations, suggesting that Set2 and Chd1 have 
specific roles in negatively regulating DNA replication.
