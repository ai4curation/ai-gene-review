Multicellular organisms have multiple homologs of the yeast ATG8 gene, but the 
differential roles of these homologs in autophagy during development remain 
largely unknown. Here we investigated structure/function relationships in the 
two C. elegans Atg8 homologs, LGG-1 and LGG-2. lgg-1 is essential for 
degradation of protein aggregates, while lgg-2 has cargo-specific and 
developmental-stage-specific roles in aggregate degradation. Crystallography 
revealed that the N-terminal tails of LGG-1 and LGG-2 adopt the closed and open 
form, respectively. LGG-1 and LGG-2 interact differentially with autophagy 
substrates and Atg proteins, many of which carry a LIR motif. LGG-1 and LGG-2 
have structurally distinct substrate binding pockets that prefer different 
residues in the interacting LIR motif, thus influencing binding specificity. 
Lipidated LGG-1 and LGG-2 possess distinct membrane tethering and fusion 
activities, which may result from the N-terminal differences. Our study reveals 
the differential function of two ATG8 homologs in autophagy during C. elegans 
development.
