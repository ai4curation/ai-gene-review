The Arabidopsis Flowering Locus C (FLC) protein is a repressor of flowering 
regulated by genes in the autonomous and vernalization pathways. Previous 
genetic and transgenic data have suggested that FLC acts by repressing 
expression of the floral integrator genes SOC1 and FT. We have taken an in vivo 
approach to determine whether the FLC protein interacts directly with potential 
DNA targets. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we have shown that FLC binds 
to a region of the first intron of FT that contains a putative CArG box, and 
have confirmed that FLC binds to a CArG box in the promoter of the SOC1 gene. 
MADS box proteins are thought to bind their DNA targets as dimers or 
higher-order multimers. We have shown that FLC is a component of a multimeric 
protein complex in vivo and that more than one FLC polypeptides can be present 
in the complex.
