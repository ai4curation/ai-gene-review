PURPOSE: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a devastating disease. Recent studies 
suggest that the stem cell properties of GBM contribute to the development of 
therapy resistance.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression of Survivin and Ran was evaluated by 
immunohistochemistry with GBM tissues, and quantitative reverse transcriptase 
(qRT)-PCR and immunocytochemistry with patient-derived GBM sphere cultures. With 
a computational structure-based drug design, 11 small-molecule compounds were 
designed, synthesized, and evaluated as inhibitor candidates for the molecular 
interaction of Survivin protein. The molecular mechanism of the lead compound, 
LLP-3, was determined by Western blot, ELISA, in situ proximity ligation assay, 
and immunocytochemistry. The effects of LLP-3 treatment on GSCs were evaluated 
both in vitro and in vivo. Quantitative immunohistochemistry was carried out to 
compare Survivin expression in tissues from 44 newly diagnosed and 31 recurrent 
post-chemoradiation GBM patients. Lastly, the sensitivities of 
temozolomide-resistant GBM spheres to LLP-3 were evaluated in vitro.
RESULTS: Survivin and Ran were strongly expressed in GBM tissues, particularly 
in the perivasculature, and also in patient-derived GSC cultures. LLP-3 
treatment disrupted the Survivin-Ran protein complex in cancer cells and 
abolished the growth of patient-derived GBM spheres in vitro and in vivo. This 
inhibition was dependent on caspase activity and associated with p53 status of 
cells. Immunohistochemistry showed that Survivin expression is significantly 
increased in recurrent GBM compared with newly diagnosed tumors, and 
temozolomide-resistant GBM spheres exhibited high sensitivities to LLP-3 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Disruption of the Survivin-Ran complex by LLP-3 abolishes survival 
and growth of GSCs both in vitro and in vivo, indicating an attractive novel 
therapeutic approach for GBM.
