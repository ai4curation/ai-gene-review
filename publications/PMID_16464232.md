Synaptic plasticity and memory formation involve remodeling of the postsynaptic 
cytoskeleton, a process that is in part based on both local translation of 
dendritic mRNAs and synaptic recruitment of newly synthesized proteins. The 
postsynaptic component Dendrin that is encoded by a dendritically localized mRNA 
is thought to modulate the structure of the synaptic cytoskeleton. However, 
molecular mechanisms that control extrasomatic Dendrin mRNA transport and 
postsynaptic protein recruitment are unknown. The data presented here reveal 
that Dendrin interacts with the cytoskeletal components alpha-actinin and Maguk 
with inverted orientation (MAGI) or synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM). The 
latter retains Dendrin in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells and prevents its 
nuclear import. Furthermore in neurons, postsynaptic clustering of Dendrin 
requires dendritic targeting of its messenger RNA (mRNA), a process that is 
mediated by a sequence motif within the 3' untranslated region. In summary our 
finding suggest that postsynaptic recruitment of Dendrin appears to critically 
depend on both local protein synthesis and association with the synaptic 
scaffolding protein MAGI/S-SCAM. Its nuclear localization capacity further 
points to a function in retrograde signaling from the synapse to the nucleus.
