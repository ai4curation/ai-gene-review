p53, a critical tumor suppressor, regulates mitochondrial respiration, but how a 
nuclear protein can orchestrate the function of an organelle encoded by two 
separate genomes, both of which require p53 for their integrity, remains 
unclear. Here we report that the mammalian homolog of the yeast mitochondrial 
disulfide relay protein Mia40 (CHCHD4) is necessary for the 
respiratory-dependent translocation of p53 into the mitochondria. In the setting 
of oxidative stress, increased CHCHD4 expression partitions p53 into the 
mitochondria and protects its genomic integrity while decreasing p53 nuclear 
localization and transcriptional activity. Conversely, decreased CHCHD4 
expression prevents the mitochondrial translocation of p53 while augmenting its 
nuclear localization and activity. Thus, the mitochondrial disulfide relay 
system allows p53 to regulate two spatially segregated genomes depending on 
oxidative metabolic activity.

Abstract

p53, a critical tumor suppressor, regulates mitochondrial respiration, but how a nuclear protein can orchestrate the function of an organelle encoded by two separate genomes, both of which require p53 for their integrity, remains unclear. Here we report that the mammalian homolog of the yeast mitochondrial disulfide relay protein Mia40 (CHCHD4) is necessary for the respiratory-dependent translocation of p53 into the mitochondria. In the setting of oxidative stress, increased CHCHD4 expression partitions p53 into the mitochondria and protects its genomic integrity while decreasing p53 nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. Conversely, decreased CHCHD4 expression prevents the mitochondrial translocation of p53 while augmenting its nuclear localization and activity. Thus, the mitochondrial disulfide relay system allows p53 to regulate two spatially segregated genomes depending on oxidative metabolic activity.

Discussion

In the present study, we have delineated a specific molecular mechanism by which p53 can translocate into the mitochondria using a disulfide relay system that is conserved in plants and animals ( 15 ). The interaction of p53 with this vectorial import system is dependent on respiration and can be activated by oxidative stress, consistent with the notion that p53 evolved to provide basic adaptive functions against environmental stresses and is involved in redox homeostasis ( 20 , 28 ). This finding is unique among other proposed p53 translocation mechanisms, in that it is dependent on oxidative metabolism, a function that p53 also has been shown to promote in vivo ( 29 , 30 ). Furthermore, our identification of a defined molecular mechanism by which p53 can translocate into mitochondria highlights the direct role of p53 in preserving the integrity of the mitochondrial genome, which is more susceptible to oxidative damage owing to its structure and proximity to electron transfer reactions.

The subcellular partitioning of p53 into the mitochondria, with the potential to substantially affect its nuclear activity, has important implications for basic investigations of the function of this widely studied protein. For example, p53 binding to specific genomic DNA sequences has been shown to be disrupted under conditions of severe oxidative stress that involves disulfide bond formation between C135 and C141 ( 18 ). Given that CHCHD4 substrates typically contain two nonconsecutive intramolecular disulfide bonds ( 19 ), along with our observation that the p53 C135Y mutation abrogrates p53 translocation, it is tempting to speculate that this type of molecular mechanism could seamlessly integrate the redistribution of nuclear DNA-bound p53 to the mitochondria in response to oxidative stress.

Our findings also may provide insight into cancer biology. A recent study elegantly showed that CHCHD4 promotes mitochondrial function and tumor growth, largely attributable to hypoxic HIF1Î± stabilization, and that its increased expression correlates with poor prognosis in cancer patients ( 27 ). We have also found that CHCHD4 promotes cancer cell growth, but that the improvement in mitochondrial metabolism is dependent on p53 in the HCT116 cell line ( Fig. S3 A and C ). We recently reported that germline mutations of TP53 in humans can increase oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle, which may be attributed in part to interactions of CHCHD4 with mutated p53, such as the R175H mutation ( 30 ). In addition, our study raises the possibility that CHCHD4 also directly impacts p53-regulated pathways important for cancer cell proliferation, such as down-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. Further exploration of how the partitioning of p53 activity between the nucleus and the mitochondria by CHCHD4 affects cell metabolism, proliferation, or death is likely to provide more insight into p53 regulation in cancer and aging.
