Huntington's Disease (HD) is caused by an expansion of a polyglutamine tract

nuclear localization. We have investigated potential consequences to nuclear

Abstract

Huntington's Disease (HD) is caused by an expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the huntingtin (htt) protein. Pathogenesis in HD appears to include the cytoplasmic cleavage of htt and release of an amino-terminal fragment capable of nuclear localization. We have investigated potential consequences to nuclear function of a pathogenic amino-terminal region of htt (httex1p) including aggregation, protein–protein interactions, and transcription. httex1p was found to coaggregate with p53 in inclusions generated in cell culture and to interact with p53 in vitro and in cell culture. Expanded httex1p represses transcription of the p53-regulated promoters, p21 WAF1/CIP1 and MDR-1 . httex1p was also found to interact in vitro with CREB-binding protein (CBP) and mSin3a, and CBP to localize to neuronal intranuclear inclusions in a transgenic mouse model of HD. These results raise the possibility that expanded repeat htt causes aberrant transcriptional regulation through its interaction with cellular transcription factors which may result in neuronal dysfunction and cell death in HD.

Discussion

We have examined the possibility that the pathogenic domain of mutant htt interacts with critical cellular transcription factors and potentially modulates p53-induced transcriptional events in cells. Our results indicate that p53 and httex1p coaggregate, interact in vitro and in cell culture, and that httex1p is capable of repressing transcription. In addition, the coactivator CBP and the corepressor mSin3a, known to interact with p53 and mediate p53 transcriptional regulation, were found to weakly interact with httex1p in vitro . Therefore, amino-terminal httex1p has functional properties which may have significant consequences for the p53 pathway in HD neurons.

It has not been determined how mutant htt acts in the neuron to cause neuronal dysfunction and subsequent degeneration, although studies suggest that selective neuronal programmed cell death (apoptosis) may be involved in a manner similar to that observed following induction by p53 ( 20 , 21 , 37 ). Recently, a study of Danish HD patients and controls demonstrated a significantly lower overall cancer incidence in patients with HD ( 38 ). A potential mechanism which could explain these findings is that mutant htt increases the rate of p53-dependent apoptosis in preneoplasic cells.

The mechanism by which p53 induces apoptosis is complex and not completely understood. The proline-rich region of p53 contains five PXXP motifs characteristic of Src homology 3 (SH3) domain interaction sites ( 39 ). This domain of p53 may mediate apoptosis via the transcriptional activation, repression ( 35 , 40 ), or transcription-independent mechanisms ( 41 ). Deletion of all five PXXP domains in the proline-rich region of p53 inhibits its ability to induce apoptosis, whereas deletion of four of the five allows partial apoptotic activity ( 42 ). The amino-terminal region of p53 and httex1p share a proline-rich SH3 recognition site adjacent to mammalian transcriptional activation domains, a polyglutamine repeat in htt and an acidic activation domain in p53, which may have functional consequences in the pathogenic mechanism mediated by nuclear localized htt.

Recent studies suggest that the proline-rich region of p53 may interact with the C-terminal region of p53 ( 41 , 43 ). Through GST pull-down experiments, we determined that both wild-type and expanded httex1p were able to interact in vitro with full-length but not C-terminally truncated p53, an interaction also dependent on the proline-rich region of htt.

Induction of apoptosis may rely, at least in part, on the ability of p53 to repress transcription ( 44 ). Because of the similarity between the proline-rich region and the interaction between p53 and httex1p, the possibility that mutant httex1p might mediate transcriptional repression was examined. Expanded httex1p was found to significantly repress transcription of a p53-activated promoter ( p21 WAF1/CIP1 ) in luciferase assays and did so in a proline-dependent manner. This transcriptional repression may be due to a direct interaction with p53 interfering with transcriptional activation or to mutant htt directly or indirectly repressing transcription. To test this possibility, the transcription of an MDR-1 reporter, which is repressed by p53, was examined ( 30 ). We found that expanded httex1p could repress transcription of MDR-1 even in the absence of p53, potentially through mechanisms similar to p53-mediated repression.

There is precedence for transcriptional repression of specific genes in HD; expression of brain neurotransmitter receptors, in particular glutamate and D1 dopamine receptors, is decreased in brains from HD transgenic mice ( 45 ). Striatal gene expression profiles of HD transgenic mice compared with normal littermate controls, generated using DNA microarrays, show significant repression of genes involved in discrete signaling pathways ( 46 ). In addition, an interaction of the amino-terminal region of mutant htt with transcriptional repressor complex proteins may alter transcription ( 12 ).

A potential mechanism for repression of p53-regulated promoters might be through sequestration of a common coactivator, such as CBP/p300. p53 and other transcriptional activators such as NF-κB p65/RelA and the AR use the coactivators CBP/p300 ( 36 , 47 – 49 ) to activate transcription. p53, NF-κB p65/RelA , and the viral protein E1A may all repress transcription in a sequence-independent fashion through sequestration of CBP/p300 ( 50 , 51 ). Likewise, mutant htt may repress p21 WAF1/CIP1 and MDR-1 transcription through direct interaction with CBP/p300. The direct interaction in vitro between CBP and expanded httex1p and the localization of CBP to neuronal intranuclear inclusions in HD transgenic mice and to inclusions in cell culture ( 10 ) lend credence to the possibility that expanded httex1p may repress transcription through direct interaction with and sequestration of CBP.

A second potential mechanism for repression of specific p53-regulated promoters might also be through interactions with components of corepressor complexes. It has been shown that p53-mediated transcriptional repression of specific promoters utilizes histone deacetylases mediated by a direct interaction of p53 with the corepressor mSin3a ( 25 ). The fact that expanded repeat htt is capable of repressing transcription, even in the absence of p53, and that htt can bind both CBP and mSin3a in vitro , raises the possibility that htt can mimic the function of p53 to alter cellular transcriptional events.

The transcriptional repression of the reporter constructs described here requires the presence of the proline-rich region of htt; however, coaggegration and formation of complexes in cell culture do not. This suggests that additional cellular factors may be involved in the complex formation between p53 and httex1p in vivo . Transcriptional repression may occur independent of inclusion formation and may precede gene expression changes caused by sequestration of basal transcription factors by aggregates. It is also possible that expanded httex1p may alter transcription-independent signaling pathways implicated in p53-mediated apoptosis which may require the SH3 domain interaction sites within the proline-rich region ( 41 ).

Selective neurodegeneration is characteristic of a number of human diseases caused by an expansion of an endogenous glutamine repeat in otherwise unrelated proteins. Besides HD, other such diseases include the spinocerebellular ataxias (spinocerebellular ataxias 1, 2, 3 (MJD), and 7), caused by expansions in the respective ataxin gene, spinocerebellular ataxia 6 (CACNL1A4), spinal bulbar muscular atrophy/Kennedy's disease (AR), and DRPLA (atrophin-1) ( 14 ). With the exception of ataxin-3, for which polymorphic C termini adjacent to the polyglutamine repeat have been reported ( 52 ), each protein sequence contains proline-rich regions adjacent to the polyglutamine repeats that are expanded in the disease states. Within the proline-rich domains, these proteins contain a minimum of one consensus PXXP motif as well, although the majority contain several. The AR, in which an expanded polyglutamine repeat causes Kennedy's disease (spinal bulbar muscular atrophy), was also found to coaggregate in inclusions with CBP in transfected cell lines, spinal bulbar muscular atrophy transgenic mice, and patient brain tissue (A. McCampbell and K. Fischbeck, personal communication). It is possible that these mutant proteins may also interact with p53 and CBP and/or mimic the  function of p53 to cause neuronal cell death. Further study may elucidate a common pathogenic pathway among these diseases.
