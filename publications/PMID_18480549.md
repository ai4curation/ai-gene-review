The exocyst is an octameric complex involved in docking or tethering of 
secretory vesicles to fusion sites of the plasma membrane. Sec6 is the core 
subunit of the exocyst complex. Here we identify an isoform of Sec6, deposited 
as Exocyst complex component 3-like (Exoc3l) in the database, by in silico 
screening using rat Sec6 as a probe. The amino acid sequence of Exoc3l has 31% 
identity and 53% similarity with that of Sec6. RT-PCR analysis reveals that 
Exoc3l is expressed in insulin-secreting MIN6 cells as well as in various 
tissues including pancreatic islets and brain. In co-immunoprecipitation 
experiments, Exoc3l was found to interact with Sec5, Sec8, and Sec10, all of 
which are binding partners of Sec6 in the exocyst complex. Furthermore, 
overexpression of a deletion mutant of Exoc3l in MIN6 cells suppressed 
glucose-stimulated secretion. These results suggest that Exoc3l is involved in 
regulated exocytosis of insulin granules.
