Transfection of rat oligodendrocytes with an oligonucleotide sequence 
complementary to the mRNA encoding the initial ten amino acids of the rat 70-kDa 
heat shock cognate protein (HSC70) resulted in a rapid (within 24 h) and 
significant reduction in HSC70 synthesis (69% of control cells transfected with 
sense oligonucleotide). A further decrease to approximately 44% of controls was 
detected after 2 days. At that time, HSC70 protein content fell to approximately 
49% of controls, and a significant reduction in the synthesis of myelin basic 
protein (MBP) was first detected (66% of controls). After 5 days, HSC70 
synthesis returned to control levels. As HSC70 protein content recovered, so did 
the synthesis of MBP. Throughout the 5-day experimental period, only minor 
changes were detected in cell morphology, overall pattern of protein synthesis 
and the synthesis and content of proteolipid protein (PLP) and the pi isoenzyme 
of glutathione-S-transferase (pi). These data show that when HSC70 protein 
content is sufficiently reduced by antisense oligonucleotide, synthesis of MBP 
(but not PLP or pi) is correspondingly down-regulated, and provide evidence 
consistent with the role of HSC70 as a chaperone for MBP.
