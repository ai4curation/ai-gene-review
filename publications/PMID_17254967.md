The kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 regulates the G1 cell cycle phase. Here, we present 
data indicating that the oncogenic kinase Src regulates p27 stability through 
phosphorylation of p27 at tyrosine 74 and tyrosine 88. Src inhibitors increase 
cellular p27 stability, and Src overexpression accelerates p27 proteolysis. 
Src-phosphorylated p27 is shown to inhibit cyclin E-Cdk2 poorly in vitro, and 
Src transfection reduces p27-cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes. Our data indicate that 
phosphorylation by Src impairs the Cdk2 inhibitory action of p27 and reduces its 
steady-state binding to cyclin E-Cdk2 to facilitate cyclin E-Cdk2-dependent p27 
proteolysis. Furthermore, we find that Src-activated breast cancer lines show 
reduced p27 and observe a correlation between Src activation and reduced nuclear 
p27 in 482 primary human breast cancers. Importantly, we report that in 
tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines, Src inhibition can increase p27 
levels and restore tamoxifen sensitivity. These data provide a new rationale for 
Src inhibitors in cancer therapy.
