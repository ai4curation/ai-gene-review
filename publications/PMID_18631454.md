The mammalian immune system discriminates between modes of cell death; necrosis 
often results in inflammation and adaptive immunity, whereas apoptosis tends to 
be anti-inflammatory and promote immune tolerance. We have examined apoptosis 
for the features responsible for tolerance; specifically, we looked at the roles 
of caspases and mitochondria. Our results show that caspase activation targeted 
the mitochondria to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which were critical 
to tolerance induction by apoptotic cells. ROS oxidized the potential danger 
signal high-mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) released from dying cells and 
thereby neutralized its stimulatory activity. Apoptotic cells failed to induce 
tolerance and instead stimulated immune responses by scavenging or by mutating a 
mitochondrial caspase target protein when ROS activity was prohibited. 
Similarly, blocking sites of oxidation in HMGB1 prevented tolerance induction by 
apoptotic cells. These results suggest that caspase-orchestrated mitochondrial 
events determine the impact of apoptotic cells on the immune response.
