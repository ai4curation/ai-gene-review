Progressive myoclonus epilepsy is a heterogeneous group of disorders 
characterized by myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizures, ataxia and cognitive 
decline. We here present two affected brothers. At 9 months of age the elder 
brother developed ataxia and myoclonic jerks. In his second year he lost the 
ability to walk and talk, and he developed drug-resistant progressive myoclonus 
epilepsy. The cerebrospinal fluid level of glutamate was decreased while 
glutamine was increased. His younger brother manifested similar symptoms from 6 
months of age. By exome sequencing of the proband we identified a novel 
homozygous frameshift variant in the potassium channel tetramerization domain 7 
(KCTD7) gene (NM_153033.1:c.696delT: p.F232fs), which results in a truncated 
protein. The identified F232fs variant is inherited in an autosomal recessive 
manner, and the healthy consanguineous parents carry the variant in a 
heterozygous state. Bioinformatic analyses and structure modelling showed that 
KCTD7 is a highly conserved protein, structurally similar to KCTD5 and several 
voltage-gated potassium channels, and that it may form homo- or heteromultimers. 
By heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we demonstrate that 
wild-type KCTD7 hyperpolarizes cells in a K+ dependent manner and regulates 
activity of the neuronal glutamine transporter SAT2 (Slc38a2), while the F232fs 
variant impairs K+ fluxes and obliterates SAT2-dependent glutamine transport. 
Characterization of four additional disease-causing variants (R94W, R184C, 
N273I, Y276C) bolster these results and reveal the molecular mechanisms involved 
in the pathophysiology of KCTD7-related progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Thus, 
our data demonstrate that KCTD7 has an impact on K+ fluxes, neurotransmitter 
synthesis and neuronal function, and that malfunction of the encoded protein may 
lead to progressive myoclonus epilepsy.
