The functions of the Ndc80/Hec1 subunit of the highly conserved Ndc80 
kinetochore complex are normally restricted to M phase when it exerts a pivotal 
kinetochore-based role. Here, we find that in mouse oocytes, depletion of Hec1 
severely compromises the G2-M transition because of impaired activation of 
cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). Unexpectedly, impaired M phase entry is due to 
instability of the Cdk1-activating subunit, cyclin B2, which cannot be covered 
by cyclin B1. Hec1 protects cyclin B2 from destruction by the Cdh1-activated 
anaphase-promoting complex (APC(Cdh1)) and remains important for cyclin B2 
stabilization during early M phase, required for the initial stages of 
acentrosomal spindle assembly. By late M phase, however, Hec1 and cyclin B2 
become uncoupled, and although Hec1 remains stable, APC(Cdc20) triggers cyclin 
B2 destruction. These data identify another dimension to Hec1 function centered 
on M phase entry and early prometaphase progression and challenge the view that 
cyclin B2 is completely dispensable in mammals.
