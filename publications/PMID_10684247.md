An understanding of how the nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediates 
nucleocytoplasmic exchange requires a comprehensive inventory of the molecular 
components of the NPC and a knowledge of how each component contributes to the 
overall structure of this large molecular translocation machine. Therefore, we 
have taken a comprehensive approach to classify all components of the yeast NPC 
(nucleoporins). This involved identifying all the proteins present in a highly 
enriched NPC fraction, determining which of these proteins were nucleoporins, 
and localizing each nucleoporin within the NPC. Using these data, we present a 
map of the molecular architecture of the yeast NPC and provide evidence for a 
Brownian affinity gating mechanism for nucleocytoplasmic transport.
