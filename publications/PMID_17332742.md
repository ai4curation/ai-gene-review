Little is known about the higher-order structure of prespliceosomal A complexes, 
in which pairing of the pre-mRNA's splice sites occurs. Here, human A complexes 
were isolated under physiological conditions by double-affinity selection. 
Purified complexes contained stoichiometric amounts of U1, U2 and pre-mRNA, and 
crosslinking studies indicated that these form concomitant base pairing 
interactions with one another. A complexes contained nearly all U1 and U2 
proteins plus approximately 50 non-snRNP proteins. Unexpectedly, proteins of the 
hPrp19/CDC5 complex were also detected, even when A complexes were formed in the 
absence of U4/U6 snRNPs, demonstrating that they associate independent of the 
tri-snRNP. Double-affinity purification yielded structurally homogeneous A 
complexes as evidenced by electron microscopy, and allowed for the first time 
the generation of a three-dimensional structure. A complexes possess an 
asymmetric shape (approximately 260 x 200 x 195 angstroms) and contain a main 
body with various protruding elements, including a head-like domain and 
foot-like protrusions. Complexes isolated here are well suited for in vitro 
assembly studies to determine factor requirements for the A to B complex 
transition.
