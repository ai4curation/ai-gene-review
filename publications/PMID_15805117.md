The diverse function of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) may be 
regulated by interactions with different protein partners. Interestingly, the 
binding sites for all known PCNA-associating proteins are on the outer surface 
or the C termini ("front") sides of the PCNA trimer. Using cell extracts and 
purified human PCNA protein, we show here that two PCNA homotrimers form a 
back-to-back doublet. Mutation analysis suggests that the Arg-5 and Lys-110 
residues on the PCNA back side are the contact points of the two homotrimers in 
the doublet. Furthermore, short synthetic peptides encompassing either Arg-5 or 
Lys-110 inhibit double trimer formation. We also found that a PCNA double 
trimer, but not a homotrimer alone, can simultaneously accommodate chromatin 
assembly factor-1 and polymerase delta. Together, our data supports a model that 
chromatin remodeling by chromatin assembly factor-1 (and, possibly, many other 
cellular activities) are tightly coupled with DNA replication (and repair) 
through a PCNA double trimer complex.
