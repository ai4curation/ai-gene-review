Molecular chaperones are involved in a wide range of cellular events, such as 
protein folding and oligomeric protein complex assembly. DnaK- and DnaJ-like 
proteins are the two major classes of molecular chaperones in mammals. Recent 
studies have shown that DnaJ-like family proteins can inhibit polyglutamine 
aggregation, a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, including 
Huntington's disease (HD). Although most DnaJ-like proteins studied are 
ubiquitously expressed, some have restricted expression, so it is possible that 
some specific chaperones may affect polyglutamine aggregation in specific 
neurons. In this report, we describe the isolation of a DnaJ-like protein MRJ 
and the characterization of its chaperone activity. Tissue distribution studies 
showed that MRJ is highly enriched in the central nervous system. In an in vitro 
cell model of HD, overexpressed MRJ effectively suppressed 
polyglutamine-dependent protein aggregation, caspase activity, and cellular 
toxicity. Collectively, these results suggest that MRJ has a relevant functional 
role in neurons.
