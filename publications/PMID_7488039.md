Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for all three isoforms of 
nitric oxide synthase (NOS). However, its binding sites and functional roles 
remain elusive. Here, we demonstrated that cys-99 of human endothelial NOS 
(ecNOS) is critical for BH4 involvement in NOS catalytic activity and stability. 
Mutation of cys-99 to alanine in ecNOS resulted in loss of catalytic activity 
which could be restored to the level of wild type by adding a high concentration 
of exogenous BH4 to the crude extract. Purified C99A mutant was unstable and its 
maximal activity was only about 20% of the purified wild type activity. 
Comparison of BH4 concentration-dependent citrulline formation between C99A and 
the wild type revealed that the BH4 concentrations required for generating 
half-maximal citrulline were 10-fold higher for C99A. Purified C99A had no 
detectable BH4 and had a reduced heme content when compared to the purified wild 
type, but retained the ability of forming CO-ferrous heme complex and had the 
same Km value for L-arginine (approximately 4 microM) as the wild type. These 
findings indicate that Cys-99 is critically involved in BH4 binding. Mutation of 
this residue leads to reduced affinity for BH4 and the resultant enzyme 
instability and irreversible heme loss.
