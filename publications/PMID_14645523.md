The eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) interact with translation initiation factor 
4E to inhibit translation. Their binding to eIF4E is reversed by phosphorylation 
of several key Ser/Thr residues. In Drosophila, S6 kinase (dS6K) and a single 
4E-BP (d4E-BP) are phosphorylated via the insulin and target of rapamycin (TOR) 
signaling pathways. Although S6K phosphorylation is independent of 
phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K) and serine/threonine protein kinase Akt, 
that of 4E-BP is dependent on PI3K and Akt. This difference prompted us to 
examine the regulation of d4E-BP in greater detail. Analysis of d4E-BP 
phosphorylation using site-directed mutagenesis and isoelectric focusing-sodium 
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the regulatory 
interplay between Thr37 and Thr46 of d4E-BP is conserved in flies and that 
phosphorylation of Thr46 is the major phosphorylation event that regulates 
d4E-BP activity. We used RNA interference (RNAi) to target components of the 
PI3K, Akt, and TOR pathways. RNAi experiments directed at components of the 
insulin and TOR signaling cascades show that d4E-BP is phosphorylated in a PI3K- 
and Akt-dependent manner. Surprisingly, RNAi of dAkt also affected 
insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of dS6K, indicating that dAkt may also play a 
role in dS6K phosphorylation.
