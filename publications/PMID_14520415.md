Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder 
characterized primarily by retinal dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, renal 
malformations and learning disabilities. Although five BBS genes have been 
cloned, the molecular basis of this syndrome remains elusive. Here we show that 
BBS is probably caused by a defect at the basal body of ciliated cells. We have 
cloned a new BBS gene, BBS8, which encodes a protein with a prokaryotic domain, 
pilF, involved in pilus formation and twitching mobility. In one family, a 
homozygous null BBS8 mutation leads to BBS with randomization of left-right body 
axis symmetry, a known defect of the nodal cilium. We have also found that BBS8 
localizes specifically to ciliated structures, such as the connecting cilium of 
the retina and columnar epithelial cells in the lung. In cells, BBS8 localizes 
to centrosomes and basal bodies and interacts with PCM1, a protein probably 
involved in ciliogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that all available 
Caenorhabditis elegans BBS homologues are expressed exclusively in ciliated 
neurons, and contain regulatory elements for RFX, a transcription factor that 
modulates the expression of genes associated with ciliogenesis and 
intraflagellar transport.
