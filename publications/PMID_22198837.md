The histone chaperone Rtt106 binds histone H3 acetylated at lysine 56 (H3K56ac) 
and facilitates nucleosome assembly during several molecular processes. Both the 
structural basis of this modification-specific recognition and how this 
recognition informs Rtt106 function are presently unclear. Guided by our crystal 
structure of Rtt106, we identified two regions on its double-pleckstrin homology 
domain architecture that mediated histone binding. When histone binding was 
compromised, Rtt106 localized properly to chromatin but failed to deliver 
H3K56ac, leading to replication and silencing defects. By mutating analogous 
regions in the structurally homologous chromatin-reorganizer Pob3, we revealed a 
conserved histone-binding function for a basic patch found on both proteins. In 
contrast, a loop connecting two β-strands was required for histone binding by 
Rtt106 but was dispensable for Pob3 function. Unlike Rtt106, Pob3 histone 
binding was modification-independent, implicating the loop of Rtt106 in 
H3K56ac-specific recognition in vivo. Our studies described the structural 
origins of Rtt106 function, identified a conserved histone-binding surface, and 
defined a critical role for Rtt106:H3K56ac-binding specificity in silencing and 
replication-coupled nucleosome turnover.
