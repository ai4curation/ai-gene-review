The type III receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 is one of the most commonly mutated 
oncogenes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Inhibition of mutated FLT3 in 
combination with chemotherapy has displayed promising results in clinical 
trials. However, one of the major obstacles in targeting FLT3 is the development 
of resistant disease due to secondary mutations in FLT3 that lead to relapse. 
FLT3 and its oncogenic mutants signal through associating proteins that activate 
downstream signaling. Thus, targeting proteins that interact with FLT3 and their 
downstream signaling cascades can be an alternative approach to treat 
FLT3-dependent AML. We used an SH2 domain array screen to identify novel FLT3 
interacting proteins and identified ABL2 as a potent interacting partner of 
FLT3. To understand the role of ABL2 in FLT3-mediated biological and cellular 
events, we used the murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 as a model system. 
Overexpression of ABL2 in Ba/F3 cells expressing an oncogenic mutant of FLT3 
(FLT3-ITD) resulted in partial inhibition of FLT3-ITD-dependent cell 
proliferation and colony formation. ABL2 expression did not alter the kinase 
activity of FLT3, its ubiquitination or its stability. However, it partially 
blocked FLT3-induced AKT phosphorylation without affecting ERK1/2 and p38 
activation. Taken together our data suggest that ABL2 acts as negative regulator 
of signaling downstream of FLT3.

INTRODUCTIONThe mammalian genome encodes more than 500 protein kinases that contribute to the regulation of almost all cellular events. Around 60 protein kinases are characterized as receptor tyrosine kinases which are regulated by extracellular stimuli including growth factors [1, 2]. The type III receptor tyrosine kinase family includes the receptors for platelet derived growth factors (PDGFRA and PDGFRB), the receptor for stem cell factor (SCFR or KIT), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3, the receptor for FLT3 ligand, FL) and the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). Several members of this family are important regulators of the hematopoietic system and have been implicated in various hematological malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML originates from the myeloid lineage of hematopoietic cells [3] and more than 30% of AML patients carry an oncogenic mutation in the FLT3 gene [4]. FLT3 and other type III receptor tyrosine kinases share common domain arrangements such as an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain and a kinase domain (split by a short kinase insert). Its ligand, FL, forms spontaneous dimers and binds to the extracellular domain of FLT3 and thereby induces dimerization of FLT3 which further promotes activation of its intrinsic kinase activity and autophosphorylation on several tyrosine residues. Phosphotyrosine residues are well-known as docking sites for SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins that regulate, depending on the characteristic of the partner protein, either the activation or inhibition of signaling downstream of the receptor. For instance, ubiquitin E3 ligases such as CBL, SOCS2 and SOCS6 bind to FLT3 and negatively regulate downstream signaling. In contrast, the adaptor proteins GRB10 [5] and GADS [6], and the non-receptor tyrosine kinases SYK [7] and FYN [8], enhance downstream signaling.The mammalian Abelson (ABL) family of non-receptor tyrosine kinase includes the two members ABL and ABL2 (also called ARG, ABL-related gene). ABL and ABL2 transduce signals from upstream receptors and regulate numerous biological processes such as cell survival, apoptosis, response to genotoxic stress, morphogenesis and cell motility [9]. ABL family kinases have been implicated in leukemia as the BCR-ABL fusion gene [10]. The BCR-ABL fusion gene is the major oncogene in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The BCR-ABL fusion gene has also been reported less frequently in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and rarely in AML [11]. Like ABL, ABL2 forms fusion genes with TEL transcription factors. However, this is a rare event in AML [12]. Recent studies suggest that, besides gene fusions, expression of ABL family kinases is upregulated in several cancers such as pancreatic cancer, anaplastic thyroid cancers, colorectal cancer, melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancers [13–16]. ABL family kinases regulate invasion, proliferation and survival mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR), HER2 and SRC kinases [17–21]. However, the role of this family of kinases has not been studied with respect to signaling downstream of FLT3. Here we identify ABL2 as an FLT3 interacting protein and show that ABL2 plays a role in signaling downstream of FLT3.

INTRODUCTION

The mammalian genome encodes more than 500 protein kinases that contribute to the regulation of almost all cellular events. Around 60 protein kinases are characterized as receptor tyrosine kinases which are regulated by extracellular stimuli including growth factors [1, 2]. The type III receptor tyrosine kinase family includes the receptors for platelet derived growth factors (PDGFRA and PDGFRB), the receptor for stem cell factor (SCFR or KIT), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3, the receptor for FLT3 ligand, FL) and the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). Several members of this family are important regulators of the hematopoietic system and have been implicated in various hematological malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML originates from the myeloid lineage of hematopoietic cells [3] and more than 30% of AML patients carry an oncogenic mutation in the FLT3 gene [4]. FLT3 and other type III receptor tyrosine kinases share common domain arrangements such as an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain and a kinase domain (split by a short kinase insert). Its ligand, FL, forms spontaneous dimers and binds to the extracellular domain of FLT3 and thereby induces dimerization of FLT3 which further promotes activation of its intrinsic kinase activity and autophosphorylation on several tyrosine residues. Phosphotyrosine residues are well-known as docking sites for SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins that regulate, depending on the characteristic of the partner protein, either the activation or inhibition of signaling downstream of the receptor. For instance, ubiquitin E3 ligases such as CBL, SOCS2 and SOCS6 bind to FLT3 and negatively regulate downstream signaling. In contrast, the adaptor proteins GRB10 [5] and GADS [6], and the non-receptor tyrosine kinases SYK [7] and FYN [8], enhance downstream signaling.

The mammalian Abelson (ABL) family of non-receptor tyrosine kinase includes the two members ABL and ABL2 (also called ARG, ABL-related gene). ABL and ABL2 transduce signals from upstream receptors and regulate numerous biological processes such as cell survival, apoptosis, response to genotoxic stress, morphogenesis and cell motility [9]. ABL family kinases have been implicated in leukemia as the BCR-ABL fusion gene [10]. The BCR-ABL fusion gene is the major oncogene in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The BCR-ABL fusion gene has also been reported less frequently in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and rarely in AML [11]. Like ABL, ABL2 forms fusion genes with TEL transcription factors. However, this is a rare event in AML [12]. Recent studies suggest that, besides gene fusions, expression of ABL family kinases is upregulated in several cancers such as pancreatic cancer, anaplastic thyroid cancers, colorectal cancer, melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancers [13–16]. ABL family kinases regulate invasion, proliferation and survival mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR), HER2 and SRC kinases [17–21]. However, the role of this family of kinases has not been studied with respect to signaling downstream of FLT3. Here we identify ABL2 as an FLT3 interacting protein and show that ABL2 plays a role in signaling downstream of FLT3.

RESULTSIdentification of ABL2 as a FLT3 binding proteinReceptor tyrosine kinases such as FLT3 signal through proteins that associate with the activated receptor. In order to identify novel FLT3-interacting proteins we used an SH2 domain array [22]. Seventy-four recombinant SH2 domains from 64 different proteins were used. Three different tyrosine phosphorylated peptides corresponding to residues Y726, Y793 and Y842 in FLT3 were used to determine the binding to the SH2 domains. We observed that the ABL2 SH2 domain displayed the highest affinity to the tyrosine phosphorylated FLT3 peptides (Figure 1A). Other associating proteins included several SRC family kinases, SOCS6, ABL, CRK, CRKL etc. Furthermore, we could show that association between ABL2 and FLT3 is FL-dependent and that oncogenic FLT3-ITD displays constitutive association with ABL2 (Figure 1B).Figure 1ABL2 binds to FLT3 in response to FL stimulationA. An SH2 domain array screen identifies ABL2 as a novel FLT3-associating protein. Seventy-four SH2 domains from different proteins were used. B. COS-1 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing FLT3-WT and empty vector or FLAG-tagged ABL2. After 24 hours of transfection cells were stimulated for 5 minutes with 100 ng/ml FL followed by lysis. Lysates were immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG antibody.ABL2 expression negatively regulates FLT3-ITD-mediated cell viability and colony formationTo explore the role of ABL2 in oncogenic FLT3-ITD-mediated biological responses, we generated Ba/F3 cells overexpressing both FLT-ITD and ABL2 or empty control vector (EV). FLT3-ITD surface expression was analyzed by flow cytometry and the total expression was determined by western blotting. The results demonstrate an equal surface (Figure 2A) as well as total (Figure 2B) expression of FLT3-ITD in both ABL2 and EV expressing cells. We used these cell lines to determine the dependency of ABL2 for cell viability and colony formation. Cell viability was determined using the dye PrestoBlue. We observed that cells expressing ABL2 displayed significantly reduced viability when compared to cells expressing empty control vector (Figure 2C). However, ABL2 expression did not affect the apoptotic rate (Figure 2D). The potential to form colonies in semi-solid medium was also reduced in cells expressing ABL2 (Figure 2E).Figure 2ABL2 expression reduces FLT3-ITD-mediated cell viability and colony formationA. Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD cells expressing ABL2, or empty vector were labeled with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-FLT3 antibody. Samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry. B.

Ba/F3-FLT3-EV and Ba/F3-FLT3-ABL2 cells were treated with cycloheximide for 30 minutes, in order to block protein synthesis, and then stimulated with FL for 30 minutes in the presence of cycloheximide. We did not observe any difference in FLT3 degradation whether ABL2 was overexpressed or not (Figure 4A). ABL2 expression neither altered FL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation nor ubiquitination of FLT3 (Figure 4B).Figure 4ABL2 expression does not alter FLT3 activation, ubiquitination or degradationA.

DISCUSSIONSignaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases is tightly controlled by various associating proteins such as kinases, phosphatases, ubiquitin E3 ligases, adaptors and scaffolding proteins. In order to maintain a proper balance in signaling, many interacting proteins enhance receptor signaling, but some of them turn off the signal by dephosphorylating the receptor or directing the receptor for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Thus, the level of signaling is maintained at a level that is appropriate for the cell. Too much RTK signaling can be deleterious and lead to induction of apoptosis [28]. Here we identify ABL2 as a novel FLT3-associating protein using an SH2 domain array screening. We show that ABL2 negatively regulates FLT3-ITD-mediated biological events through partial inhibition of AKT signaling.The recombinant SH2 domain of ABL2 displayed a high affinity for multiple phosphopeptides corresponding to known FLT3 tyrosine phosphorylation sites. In addition to the ABL2 SH2 domain, the SH2 domains of CRK, CRKL, FYN, ABL, LCK, SOCS6, SYK etc. also displayed a considerable affinity for those phosphopeptides. Many of those proteins have already been verified by biochemical methods and identified as critical regulators of FLT3 signaling [7, 8, 29]. ABL2 associates with FLT3 only when FLT3 is activated, suggesting that FLT3 tyrosine phosphorylation is required for the interaction and that the interaction is mediated through pY-SH2 binding.FLT3 and its oncogenic counterpart, FLT3-ITD, exert survival, proliferative and transforming signals by activating mainly three different signaling cascades, i. e. the PI3K/AKT, RAS/ERK and p38 pathways [24, 25]. When ABL family proteins form fusion proteins with BCR or TEL they mediate signals that lead to cell proliferation, survival and transformation [12]. Depletion of ABL2 in non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines led to decreased cell growth [30]. However, the effect of ABL2 expression seems to some extent to be context dependent, since in a breast cancer model, loss of ABL2 accelerated tumor growth by enhancing cell proliferation [21]. In line with these findings, we also observed that overexpression of ABL2 reduced FLT3-ITD-induced cell proliferation as well as colony formation. Although ABL2 is a tyrosine kinase, overexpression of ABL2 did not increase the total tyrosine phosphorylation of FLT3 suggesting that ABL2 is not involved in the FLT3 activation process. Furthermore, association of ABL2 did not affect FLT3 ubiquitination or degradation. Therefore, it is likely that ABL2 has no direct effect on FLT3 but that association of ABL2 with FLT3 disrupts selective downstream signaling pathways e. g. the AKT pathway. In contrast to its close relative ABL1, ABL2 seems to be a negative regulator of signaling and transformation. This observation may have different explanations: ABL2 might compete for binding to FLT3 with proteins essential for activation of the AKT pathway or ABL2 directly targets FLT3 downstream signaling proteins. The mechanism behind these signaling events will be further investigated in future studies.

Signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases is tightly controlled by various associating proteins such as kinases, phosphatases, ubiquitin E3 ligases, adaptors and scaffolding proteins. In order to maintain a proper balance in signaling, many interacting proteins enhance receptor signaling, but some of them turn off the signal by dephosphorylating the receptor or directing the receptor for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Thus, the level of signaling is maintained at a level that is appropriate for the cell. Too much RTK signaling can be deleterious and lead to induction of apoptosis [28]. Here we identify ABL2 as a novel FLT3-associating protein using an SH2 domain array screening. We show that ABL2 negatively regulates FLT3-ITD-mediated biological events through partial inhibition of AKT signaling.

The recombinant SH2 domain of ABL2 displayed a high affinity for multiple phosphopeptides corresponding to known FLT3 tyrosine phosphorylation sites. In addition to the ABL2 SH2 domain, the SH2 domains of CRK, CRKL, FYN, ABL, LCK, SOCS6, SYK etc. also displayed a considerable affinity for those phosphopeptides. Many of those proteins have already been verified by biochemical methods and identified as critical regulators of FLT3 signaling [7, 8, 29]. ABL2 associates with FLT3 only when FLT3 is activated, suggesting that FLT3 tyrosine phosphorylation is required for the interaction and that the interaction is mediated through pY-SH2 binding.

FLT3 and its oncogenic counterpart, FLT3-ITD, exert survival, proliferative and transforming signals by activating mainly three different signaling cascades, i. e. the PI3K/AKT, RAS/ERK and p38 pathways [24, 25]. When ABL family proteins form fusion proteins with BCR or TEL they mediate signals that lead to cell proliferation, survival and transformation [12]. Depletion of ABL2 in non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines led to decreased cell growth [30]. However, the effect of ABL2 expression seems to some extent to be context dependent, since in a breast cancer model, loss of ABL2 accelerated tumor growth by enhancing cell proliferation [21]. In line with these findings, we also observed that overexpression of ABL2 reduced FLT3-ITD-induced cell proliferation as well as colony formation. Although ABL2 is a tyrosine kinase, overexpression of ABL2 did not increase the total tyrosine phosphorylation of FLT3 suggesting that ABL2 is not involved in the FLT3 activation process. Furthermore, association of ABL2 did not affect FLT3 ubiquitination or degradation. Therefore, it is likely that ABL2 has no direct effect on FLT3 but that association of ABL2 with FLT3 disrupts selective downstream signaling pathways e. g. the AKT pathway. In contrast to its close relative ABL1, ABL2 seems to be a negative regulator of signaling and transformation. This observation may have different explanations: ABL2 might compete for binding to FLT3 with proteins essential for activation of the AKT pathway or ABL2 directly targets FLT3 downstream signaling proteins. The mechanism behind these signaling events will be further investigated in future studies.
