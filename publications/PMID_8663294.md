Members of the ICE/Ced-3 gene family are likely effector components of the cell 
death machinery. Here, we characterize a novel member of this family designated 
ICE-LAP6. By phylogenetic analysis, ICE-LAP6 is classified into the Ced-3 
subfamily which includes Ced-3, Yama/CPP32/apopain, Mch2, and 
ICE-LAP3/Mch3/CMH-1. Interestingly, ICE-LAP6 contains an active site QACGG 
pentapeptide, rather than the QACRG pentapeptide shared by other family members. 
Overexpression of ICE-LAP6 induces apoptosis in MCF7 breast carcinoma cells. 
More importantly, ICE-LAP6 is proteolytically processed into an active cysteine 
protease by granzyme B, an important component of cytotoxic T cell-mediated 
apoptosis. Once activated, ICE-LAP6 is able to cleave the death substrate 
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase into signature apoptotic fragments.
