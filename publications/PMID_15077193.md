Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling may be mediated through the modulation of 
Ras activity. We have shown previously that grade III malignant astrocytoma 
biopsy samples exhibit elevated levels of FAK, and that overexpression of FAK in 
U-251MG malignant astrocytoma cells promotes the phosphorylation of Shc, a 
potential upstream mediator of Ras activity. Here, we report that overexpression 
of FAK promotes Ras activity in U-251MG malignant astrocytoma cells cultured in 
aggregate suspension or as monolayers adherent to vitronectin. The 
overexpression of FAK also promoted the association of FAK with p120RasGAP, 
which is a negative regulator of Ras activity, in the U-251MG cells cultured in 
aggregate suspension, with this association being abrogated upon plating of the 
cells onto vitronectin. An association of FAK with p120RasGAP also was observed 
in malignant astrocytoma biopsy samples, but not in normal brain samples. As 
overexpression of FAK in U-251MG cells in aggregate suspension culture reduced 
the amount of p120RasGAP complexed with active Ras, we hypothesize that the 
association of FAK with p120 RasGAP may facilitate Ras activity. The 
overexpression of a mutated FAK in which the Y397 had been mutated to F did not 
result in the formation of the FAK/p120RasGAP complex and did not promote Ras 
activity, indicating that the Y397 residue of FAK plays a role in the formation 
of this complex and in the activation of Ras. Moreover, the overexpression of 
mutated FAK (397F) was found to inhibit anchorage-independent growth. These data 
provide the basis for a previously undescribed mechanism in which the elevated 
expression of FAK can promote Ras activity through its competitive recruitment 
of p120RasGAP, thereby diminishing the association of p120RasGAP with active 
Ras.
