ARK (AXL) is the prototype of a distinctive family of receptor tyrosine kinases 
which contain in their extracellular domains features reminiscent of cell 
adhesion molecules. ARK is capable of homophilic binding, which results in a 
degree of receptor activation, but can also be activated by a heterophilic 
ligand, Gas6, a member of the family of vitamin K dependent proteins that is 
preferentially expressed in quiescent cells. Since a number of tissues and cell 
lines express both ARK and Gas6, we studied the effect of endogenous and 
exogenous Gas6 on the phenotype of ARK expressing cells. Here we show that 
constitutive expression of Gas6 in an NIH3T3 cell line that does not 
spontaneously express this protein does not result in cell transformation or 
uncontrolled growth, but protects from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. 
Recombinant exogenous Gas6 was also capable of protecting cells from apoptosis 
at concentrations that did not result in significant induction of DNA synthesis. 
Activation of ARK phosphorylation and a weak but significant induction of MAP 
kinase activity accompanied the increased survival of cells treated with Gas6. 
The antiapoptotic effect of ARK signaling was confirmed by studies using 
fibroblasts from ARK knock-out mice, that showed that the absence of ARK 
resulted in higher levels of serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, that could not 
be rescued by the addition of Gas6. Interestingly ARK signaling protects from 
apoptosis induced by serum deprivation, myc overexpression, or by TNF alpha but 
not from u.v. irradiation or Staurosporine. These results suggest that a major 
function of Gas6-ARK signaling is that of increasing cell survival under 
conditions which do not allow cell proliferation.
