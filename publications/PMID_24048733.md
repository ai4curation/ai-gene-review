Inflammatory angiogenesis involves the induction of a novel gene ZC3H12A 
encoding monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)-induced protein-1 (MCPIP1) 
that has deubiquitinase and antidicer RNAse activities. If and how these 
enzymatic activities of MCPIP1 mediate the biological functions of MCPIP1 are 
unknown. Present studies with human umbilical vein endothelial cells suggest 
that MCPIP-induced angiogenesis is mediated via hypoxia-inducible factor 
(HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and silent information 
regulator (SIRT-1) induction that results in the inhibition of angiogenesis 
inhibitor thrombospondin-1. MCPIP1 expression inhibited the production of the 
antiangiogenic microRNA (miR)-20b and -34a that repress the translation of 
HIF-1α and SIRT-1, respectively. The RNase-dead MCPIP mutant D141N not only did 
not induce angiogenesis but also failed to inhibit the production of miR-20b and 
-34a suggesting that the antidicer RNase activity of MCPIP1 is involved in 
MCPIP-mediated angiogenesis. Mimetics of miR-20b and -34a inhibited 
MCPIP1-induced angiogenesis confirming that MCPIP1 suppresses the biogenesis of 
miR-20b and -34a. Furthermore, our results indicate that MCPIP expression 
induces nuclear translocation of HIF-1α. We show that under hypoxia angiogenesis 
is mediated via induction of MCPIP1 and under normoxia, in vitro, MCPIP 
deubiquitinates ubiquitinated HIF-1α and the stabilized HIF-1α enters the 
nucleus to promote the transcription of its target genes, cyclooxygenase-2 and 
VEGF, suggesting that the deubiquitinase activity of MCPIP may also promote 
angiogenesis. The present results show for the first time that the antidicer 
RNase activity of MCPIP1 is critical in mediating a biological function of 
MCPIP, namely angiogenesis.
