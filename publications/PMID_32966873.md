The sensitivity to volatile carbon dioxide (CO2) produced by humans and other 
animals is a critical component in the host preference behaviors of the malaria 
vector mosquito Anopheles coluzzii. The molecular receptors responsible for the 
ability to sense CO2 are encoded by three putative gustatory receptor (Gr) genes 
(Gr22,23,24) which are expressed in a distinctive array of sensory neurons 
housed in maxillary palp capitate peg sensilla of An. coluzzii. Despite the 
identification of these components and subsequent studies, there is a paucity of 
understanding regarding the respective roles of these three GRs in the 
mosquito's CO2 transduction process. To address this, we have used 
CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing technique combined with in vivo 
electrophysiological recordings to directly examine the role of Gr22,23,24 in 
detecting CO2 in An. coluzzii. These studies reveal that both Gr23 and Gr24 are 
absolutely required to maintain in vivo CO2 sensitivity while, in contrast, Gr22 
knock out mutants are still able to respond to CO2 stimuli albeit with 
significantly weaker sensitivity. Our data supports a model in which Gr22 plays 
a modulatory role to enhance the functionality of Gr23/24 complexes that are 
responsible for CO2 sensitivity of mosquitoes.
