A mammalian homologue of the PDZ domain containing Caenorhabditis elegans 
protein PAR-6 was found in a yeast two-hybrid system screen as binding to the 
Rho family member Cdc42. PAR-6 contains a PDZ domain and in C. elegans it has 
been shown to be crucial for the asymmetric cleavage and establishment of cell 
polarity during the first cell divisions in the growing embryo. Mammalian PAR-6 
interacted with Cdc42 and Rac1 both in the yeast two-hybrid system and in in 
vitro binding assays. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments, employing transiently 
transfected Cos-1 cells, further confirmed that Cdc42 and Rac1 are physiological 
binding partners for PAR-6. We found that, in epithelial Madin-Darby canine 
kidney cells (MDCK), endogenous PAR-6 was present in the tight junctions, as 
judged from its co-localisation with the tight junction protein ZO-1, however, 
PAR-6 was also detected in the cell nucleus. Stimulation of MDCK cells with 
scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor induced a loss of PAR-6 from the areas 
of cell-cell contacts in conformity with their progressive breakdown. In C. 
elegans PAR-6 co-localises with PAR-3 and has been suggested to form a direct 
complex. In agreement with earlier studies, mammalian PAR-3 was found to be 
present in tight junctions of MDCK cells but, in contrast to PAR-6, the protein 
could not be detected in the nucleus. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation 
experiments, employing Cos-1 cells, demonstrated that mammalian PAR-6 and PAR-3 
formed a direct complex. These findings, together with the reported roles of 
PAR-6 and PAR-3 in C. elegans, suggest that Cdc42 and Rac1 and PAR-6/PAR-3 are 
involved in the establishment of cell polarity in epithelial cells.
