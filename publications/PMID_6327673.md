Nucleotide sequence reveals overlap between T4 phage genes encoding 
dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase.

Purohit S, Mathews CK.

We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a 1075-base-pair HindIII fragment 
of the T4 phage genome. This fragment contains the structural gene (frd) for 
dihydrofolate reductase and part of the gene (td) encoding thymidylate synthase. 
The fragment contains a 579-base-pair open reading frame, encoding a 193-residue 
polypeptide with a calculated mass of 21,603 Da, in agreement with our reported 
subunit molecular mass of 23,000. The deduced amino acid sequence shows partial 
homology with other dihydrofolate reductases, with most of the identities lying 
in regions known to be involved in substrate binding and catalysis. The 3' end 
of the coding strand overlaps the coding region for thymidylate synthase; the 
sequence - ATGA -includes an opal terminator for the frd gene and an initiating 
triplet for the td gene. The deduced amino acid sequence from this initiating 
ATG is identical, for the first 20 residues, with the NH2-terminal 20 residues 
reported for the td protein (M. Belfort , A. Moelleken , G. F. Maley , and F. 
Maley (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2045-2051). The sequenced HindIII fragment was 
transferred into a high expression plasmid vector for large scale production of 
homogeneous T4 dihydrofolate reductase. The experimentally determined sequence 
of 20 residues at the NH2-terminus of this protein is identical with that 
deduced from the nucleotide sequence for T4 dihydrofolate reductase.
