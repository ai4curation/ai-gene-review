Yeast class II Hda1 histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex is an H2B- and 
H3-specific HDAC in Saccharomyces cerevisiae consisting of three previously 
identified subunits, the catalytic subunit scHda1p and two non-catalytic 
structural subunits scHda2p and scHda3p. We co-expressed and co-purified 
recombinant yeast class II HDAC complex from bacteria as a functionally active 
and trichostatin-A-sensitive hetero-tetrameric complex. According to an 
extensive analysis of domain organization and interaction of all subunits (or 
domains), the N-terminal domain of scHda1p associates through the C-terminal 
coiled-coil domains (CCDs) of the scHda2p-scHda3p sub-complex, yielding a 
truncated scHda1pHDAC-scHda2pCCD2-scHda3pCCD3 complex with indistinguishable 
deacetylase activity compared to the full-length complex in vitro. We 
characterized the interaction of the HDAC complex with either single-stranded or 
double-stranded DNA and identified the N-terminal halves of scHda2p and scHda3p 
as binding modules. A high-resolution structure of the scHda3p DNA-binding 
domain by X-ray crystallography is presented. The crystal structure shows an 
unanticipated structural homology with the C-terminal helicase lobes of 
SWI2/SNF2 chromatin-remodeling domains of the Rad54 family enzymes. DNA binding 
is unspecific for nucleotide sequence and structure, similar to the Rad54 
enzymes in vitro. Our structural and functional analyses of the budding yeast 
class II Hda1 HDAC complex provide insight into DNA recognition and 
deacetylation of histones in nucleosomes.
