The Arp2/3 complex generates branched actin networks when activated by 
Nucleation Promoting Factors (NPFs). Recently, the WASH family of NPFs has been 
identified, but its cellular role is unclear. Here, we show that WASH generates 
an actin network on a restricted domain of sorting and recycling endosomes. We 
found that WASH belongs to a multiprotein complex containing seven subunits, 
including the heterodimer of capping protein (CP). In vitro, the purified WASH 
complex activates Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation and binds directly to 
liposomes. WASH also interacts with dynamin. WASH depletion gives rise to long 
membrane tubules pulled out from endosomes along microtubules, as does dynamin 
inhibition. Accordingly, WASH is required for efficient transferrin recycling. 
Together, these data suggest that the WASH molecular machine, integrating CP 
with a NPF, controls the fission of endosomes through an interplay between the 
forces generated by microtubule motors and actin polymerization.
