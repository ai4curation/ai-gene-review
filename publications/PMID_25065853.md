Pathway-targeted cancer drugs can produce dramatic responses that are invariably 
limited by the emergence of drug-resistant cells. We found that many 
drug-treated "oncogene-addicted" cancer cells engage a positive feedback loop 
leading to Stat3 activation, consequently promoting cell survival and limiting 
overall drug response. This was observed in cancer cells driven by diverse 
activated kinases, including EGFR, HER2, ALK, and MET, as well as mutant KRAS. 
Specifically, MEK inhibition led to autocrine activation of Stat3 via the FGF 
receptor and JAK kinases, and pharmacological inhibition of MEK together with 
JAK and FGFR enhanced tumor regression. These findings suggest that inhibition 
of a Stat3 feedback loop may augment the response to a broad spectrum of drugs 
that target pathways of oncogene addiction.
