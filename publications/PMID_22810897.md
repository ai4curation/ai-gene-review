Chemokine signaling is critical for T cell function during homeostasis and 
inflammation and directs T cell polarity and migration through the activation of 
specific intracellular pathways. Here, we uncovered a previously uncharacterized 
role for the Abl family tyrosine kinases Abl and Arg in the regulation of T 
cell-dependent inflammatory responses and showed that the Abl family kinases 
were required for chemokine-induced T cell polarization and migration. Our data 
demonstrated that Abl and Arg were activated downstream of chemokine receptors 
and mediated the chemokine-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of human enhancer of 
filamentation 1 (HEF1), an adaptor protein that is required for the activity of 
the guanosine triphosphatase Rap1, which mediates cell adhesion and migration. 
Phosphorylation of HEF1 by Abl family kinases and activation of Rap1 were 
required for chemokine-induced T cell migration. Mouse T cells that lacked Abl 
and Arg exhibited defective homing to lymph nodes and impaired migration to 
sites of inflammation. These findings suggest that Abl family kinases are 
potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of T cell-dependent immune 
disorders that are characterized by chemokine-mediated inflammation.
