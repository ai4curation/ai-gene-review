Bcl-2 and Bax are cytoplasmic proteins that have antagonistic actions on 
apoptosis. To investigate the extent to which these proteins function 
independently in regulating neuronal apoptosis, we studied the in vivo and in 
vitro development of two populations of sensory neurons of mouse embryos that 
lack one or both proteins. Absence of Bcl-2 increased neuronal apoptosis and 
reduced the number of neurons in both the trigeminal and nodose ganglia during 
the period of naturally occurring neuronal death. Absence of Bax reduced 
neuronal apoptosis and increased the number of surviving neurons in these 
ganglia and promoted sustained neuronal survival in neurotrophin-free cultures. 
In contrast, the elimination of both Bcl-2 and Bax had different consequences 
for these populations of neurons. In nodose ganglia, apoptosis was suppressed 
just as effectively in embryos lacking both proteins as in embryos lacking Bax 
alone, and neurons that lacked both proteins survived just as effectively in 
neurotrophin-free medium as Bax-deficient neurons. This suggests that for nodose 
neurons, the suppression of apoptosis by Bcl-2 is entirely dependent on the 
presence of Bax. In trigeminal ganglia, although neuronal apoptosis was reduced 
in embryos lacking both proteins compared with wild-type embryos, there were 
significantly more apoptotic neurons and significantly fewer surviving neurons 
in embryos lacking both proteins compared with Bax-deficient embryos, and 
significantly fewer trigeminal neurons from embryos lacking both proteins 
survived in neurotrophin-free medium compared with trigeminal neurons that 
lacked Bax alone. This suggests that for trigeminal neurons, Bcl-2 functions 
partly independently of Bax in regulating survival. Our results therefore 
suggest that the relative independence of Bcl-2 and Bax in regulating neuronal 
survival differs from one population of neurons to another.
