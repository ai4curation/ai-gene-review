Frataxin deficiency is the main cause of Friedreich ataxia, an autosomal 
recessive neurodegenerative disorder. Frataxin function in mitochondria has not 
been fully explained yet. In this work, we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
frataxin orthologue Yfh1p interacts physically with succinate dehydrogenase 
complex subunits Sdh1p and Sdh2p of the yeast mitochondrial electron transport 
chain and also with electron transfer flavoprotein complex ETFalpha and ETFbeta 
subunits from the electron transfer flavoprotein complex. Genetic synthetic 
interaction experiments confirmed a functional relationship between YFH1 and 
succinate dehydrogenase genes SDH1 and SDH2. We also demonstrate a physical 
interaction between human frataxin and human succinate dehydrogenase complex 
subunits, suggesting also a key role of frataxin in the mitochondrial electron 
transport chain in humans. Consequently, we suggest a direct participation of 
the respiratory chain in the pathogenesis of the Friedreich ataxia, which we 
propose to be considered as an OXPHOS disease.
