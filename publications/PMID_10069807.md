During mating of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two nuclei fuse to produce a single 
diploid nucleus. Two genes, KAR7 and KAR8, were previously identified by 
mutations that cause defects in nuclear membrane fusion. KAR7 is allelic to 
SEC71, a gene involved in protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. 
Two other translocation mutants, sec63-1 and sec72Delta, also exhibited moderate 
karyogamy defects. Membranes from kar7/sec71Delta and sec72Delta, but not 
sec63-1, exhibited reduced membrane fusion in vitro, but only at elevated 
temperatures. Genetic interactions between kar7 and kar5 mutations were 
suggestive of protein-protein interactions. Moreover, in sec71 mutants, Kar5p 
was absent from the SPB and was not detected by Western blot or 
immunoprecipitation of pulse-labeled protein. KAR8 is allelic to JEMI, encoding 
an endoplasmic reticulum resident DnaJ protein required for nuclear fusion. 
Overexpression of KAR8/JEM1 (but not SEC63) strongly suppressed the mating 
defect of kar2-1, suggesting that Kar2p interacts with Kar8/Jem1p for nuclear 
fusion. Electron microscopy analysis of kar8 mutant zygotes revealed a nuclear 
fusion defect different from kar2, kar5, and kar7/sec71 mutants. Analysis of 
double mutants suggested that Kar5p acts before Kar8/Jem1p. We propose the 
existence of a nuclear envelope fusion chaperone complex in which Kar2p, Kar5p, 
and Kar8/Jem1p are key components and Sec71p and Sec72p play auxiliary roles.
