BACKGROUND: Disabling pansclerotic morphea (DPM) is a rare systemic inflammatory 
disorder, characterized by poor wound healing, fibrosis, cytopenias, 
hypogammaglobulinemia, and squamous-cell carcinoma. The cause is unknown, and 
mortality is high.
METHODS: We evaluated four patients from three unrelated families with an 
autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance of DPM. Genomic sequencing 
independently identified three heterozygous variants in a specific region of the 
gene that encodes signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4). 
Primary skin fibroblast and cell-line assays were used to define the functional 
nature of the genetic defect. We also assayed gene expression using single-cell 
RNA sequencing of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells to identify inflammatory 
pathways that may be affected in DPM and that may respond to therapy.
RESULTS: Genome sequencing revealed three novel heterozygous missense 
gain-of-function variants in STAT4. In vitro, primary skin fibroblasts showed 
enhanced interleukin-6 secretion, with impaired wound healing, contraction of 
the collagen matrix, and matrix secretion. Inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT 
signaling with ruxolitinib led to improvement in the hyperinflammatory 
fibroblast phenotype in vitro and resolution of inflammatory markers and 
clinical symptoms in treated patients, without adverse effects. Single-cell RNA 
sequencing revealed expression patterns consistent with an immunodysregulatory 
phenotype that were appropriately modified through JAK inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: Gain-of-function variants in STAT4 caused DPM in the families that 
we studied. The JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib attenuated the dermatologic and 
inflammatory phenotype in vitro and in the affected family members. (Funded by
