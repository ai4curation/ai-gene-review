The final size of plant organs, such as leaves, is tightly controlled by 
environmental and genetic factors that must spatially and temporally coordinate 
cell expansion and cell cycle activity. However, this regulation of organ growth 
is still poorly understood. The aim of this study is to gain more insight into 
the genetic control of leaf size in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) by 
performing a comparative analysis of transgenic lines that produce enlarged 
leaves under standardized environmental conditions. To this end, we selected 
five genes belonging to different functional classes that all positively affect 
leaf size when overexpressed: AVP1, GRF5, JAW, BRI1, and GA20OX1. We show that 
the increase in leaf area in these lines depended on leaf position and growth 
conditions and that all five lines affected leaf size differently; however, in 
all cases, an increase in cell number was, entirely or predominantly, 
responsible for the leaf size enlargement. By analyzing hormone levels, 
transcriptome, and metabolome, we provide deeper insight into the molecular 
basis of the growth phenotype for the individual lines. A comparative analysis 
between these data sets indicates that enhanced organ growth is governed by 
different, seemingly independent pathways. The analysis of transgenic lines 
simultaneously overexpressing two growth-enhancing genes further supports the 
concept that multiple pathways independently converge on organ size control in 
Arabidopsis.

Abstract

The final size of plant organs, such as leaves, is tightly controlled by environmental and genetic factors that must spatially and temporally coordinate cell expansion and cell cycle activity. However, this regulation of organ growth is still poorly understood. The aim of this study is to gain more insight into the genetic control of leaf size in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) by performing a comparative analysis of transgenic lines that produce enlarged leaves under standardized environmental conditions. To this end, we selected five genes belonging to different functional classes that all positively affect leaf size when overexpressed: AVP1 , GRF5 , JAW , BRI1 , and GA20OX1 . We show that the increase in leaf area in these lines depended on leaf position and growth conditions and that all five lines affected leaf size differently; however, in all cases, an increase in cell number was, entirely or predominantly, responsible for the leaf size enlargement. By analyzing hormone levels, transcriptome, and metabolome, we provide deeper insight into the molecular basis of the growth phenotype for the individual lines. A comparative analysis between these data sets indicates that enhanced organ growth is governed by different, seemingly independent pathways. The analysis of transgenic lines simultaneously overexpressing two growth-enhancing genes further supports the concept that multiple pathways independently converge on organ size control in Arabidopsis.

DISCUSSION

To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that control leaf size, we performed a comparative analysis of five Arabidopsis transgenic lines that had previously been described to display increased leaf growth when compared with the wild type ( Huang et al., 1998 ; Wang et al., 2001 ; Palatnik et al., 2003 ; Horiguchi et al., 2005 ; Li et al., 2005 ). As the published information on these lines is not comparable because of different growth conditions, we quantitatively measured leaf growth parameters, cell area, cell number, and physiological and molecular traits for the five lines grown under identical conditions and excluding “seed” effects. Thus, our data allow a comprehensive comparative analysis of five genes that positively affect the leaf size.

CONCLUSION

This comparative analysis of genes that enhance leaf size reveals that multiple pathways control organ growth in a largely independent manner and provides evidence that combining overexpression of some of these genes leads to additive or near-additive gain in leaf size. Many more IYG lines have been described ( Gonzalez et al., 2009 ; Krizek, 2009 ), and comparative phenotypic and molecular characterization of these lines will allow the identification of downstream molecular mechanisms that trigger increased organ size but will also bring more insight into all the parallel or common pathways controlling organ growth. Combination of these different genes should allow the building of molecular networks of organ growth regulation for better engineering of crops with superior biomass production.
