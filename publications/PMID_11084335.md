BACKGROUND: Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) are a family of cell death inhibitors 
found in viruses and metazoans. All IAPs have at least one baculovirus IAP 
repeat (BIR) motif that is essential for their anti-apoptotic activity. IAPs 
physically interact with a variety of pro-apoptotic proteins and inhibit 
apoptosis induced by diverse stimuli. This allows them to function as sensors 
and inhibitors of death signals that emanate from a variety of pathways.
RESULTS: Here we report the characterization of ML-IAP, a novel human IAP that 
contains a single BIR and RING finger motif. ML-IAP is a powerful inhibitor of 
apoptosis induced by death receptors and chemotherapeutic agents, probably 
functioning as a direct inhibitor of downstream effector caspases. Modeling 
studies of the structure of the BIR domain revealed it to closely resemble the 
fold determined for the BIR2 domain of X-IAP. Deletion and mutational analysis 
demonstrated that integrity of the BIR domain was required for anti-apoptotic 
function. Tissue survey analysis showed expression in a number of embryonic 
tissues and tumor cell lines. In particular, the majority of melanoma cell lines 
expressed high levels of ML-IAP in contrast to primary melanocytes, which 
expressed undetectable levels. These melanoma cells were significantly more 
resistant to drug-induced apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: ML-IAP, a novel human IAP, inhibits apoptosis induced by death 
receptors and chemotherapeutic agents. The BIR of ML-IAP possesses an 
evolutionarily conserved fold that is necessary for anti-apoptotic activity. 
Elevated expression of ML-IAP renders melanoma cells resistant to apoptotic 
stimuli and thereby potentially contributes to the pathogenesis of this 
malignancy.
