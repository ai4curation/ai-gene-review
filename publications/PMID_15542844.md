does not phosphorylate Mdm2. VRK1-mediated p53 stabilization was also detected 
in Mdm2(-/-) cells. VRK1 also has an additive effect with MdmX or p300 to 
stabilize p53, and p300 coactivation and acetylation of p53 is enhanced by VRK1. 
The p53 stabilized by VRK1 is transcriptionally active. Suppression of VRK1 
expression by specific small interfering RNA provokes several defects in 
proliferation, situating the protein in the regulation of this process. VRK1

Abstract

Variations in intracellular levels of p53 regulate many cellular functions and determine tumor susceptibility. Major mechanisms modulating p53 levels include phosphorylation and interaction of p53 with specific ubiquitin ligases that promote its degradation. N-terminal phosphorylation regulates the interaction of p53 with several regulatory molecules. Vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) is the prototype of a new Ser-Thr kinase family in the human kinome. VRK1 is located in the nucleus outside the nucleolus. Overexpression of VRK1 increases the stability of p53 by a posttranslational mechanism leading to its accumulation by a mechanism independent of the Chk2 kinase. Catalytically inactive VRK1 protein (a K179E mutant) does not induce p53 accumulation. VRK1 phosphorylates human p53 in Thr18 and disrupts p53-Mdm2 interaction in vitro, although a significant decrease in p53 ubiquitination by Mdm2 in vivo was not detected. VRK1 kinase does not phosphorylate Mdm2. VRK1-mediated p53 stabilization was also detected in Mdm2 −/− cells. VRK1 also has an additive effect with MdmX or p300 to stabilize p53, and p300 coactivation and acetylation of p53 is enhanced by VRK1. The p53 stabilized by VRK1 is transcriptionally active. Suppression of VRK1 expression by specific small interfering RNA provokes several defects in proliferation, situating the protein in the regulation of this process. VRK1 might function as a switch controlling the proteins that interact with p53 and thus modifying its stability and activity. We propose VRK1 as the first step in a new pathway regulating p53 activity during cell proliferation.

DISCUSSION

In this report, it was shown that a novel kinase, VRK1, a member of a new Ser-Thr kinase family, is able to contribute to the stability and nuclear accumulation of a transcriptionally active p53 molecule. This accumulation is clearly due to a posttranslational effect on p53. Due to the activity of the VRK1 protein and the change in the phosphorylation status of p53 after its stabilization, this effect was likely to be a consequence of the kinase activity of VRK1. Recently, it has been shown that p53 stabilization can occur in the absence of Ser15 or Ser20 phosphorylation ( 2 , 21a ), suggesting that other residues, such as Thr18, might play a more prominent role under these circumstances. Phosphorylation of p53 in Thr18 by VRK1 abolishes the interaction between it and Mdm2 in vitro and can partially prevent the downregulation of p53 by Mdm2. However, VRK1 has no significant effect on Mdm2-dependent p53 ubiquitination, although it could impair the formation of the complex, as seen in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Moreover, the cumulative effect induced by VRK1 is also detected in cells with no expression of Mdm2, as in murine p53-Mdm2 double-null cells. This observation indicates that, although the interruption of the p53-Mdm2 interaction might play a role in promoting p53 transcriptional activity, VRK1 can also stabilize p53 by an alternative mechanism different from its effect on the interaction with Mdm2. This mechanism might also be related to inhibition of the degradation of p53, since it does not have an additive effect with the stabilization induced by the proteasome-specific inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 5D ).

MdmX has been shown to inhibit p53 transactivation activity and to stabilize p53 by an antagonist effect of Mdm2-dependent degradation. The latter effect is exerted without affecting the p53 ubiquitination pattern ( 47 ). MdmX overexpression leads to p53 stabilization, and the view of this protein as a positive regulator of p53 under stress conditions is gaining relevance ( 29 ). In H1299, overexpression of MdmX stabilized the exogenously expressed p53 similarly to VRK1. Furthermore, the overexpression of both VRK1 and MdmX at the same time induces a greater increase in p53 levels (Fig. 6C ). This could mean that VRK1 does not act on p53 by the same mechanism as MdmX, since their effects are additive, although we cannot exclude collaborative effects on p53 activation. Further studies are needed to clarify this point.

Another candidate for VRK1 action is the p300 coactivator. It has been reported that p300 binding to the amino-terminal domain of p53 is regulated by phosphorylation in residues such as Ser20 and Thr18 that promotes its union and impairs the Mdm2 interaction in the same region ( 11 , 12 , 13 ). We show in this report that VRK1-induced stabilized p53 is extensively phosphorylated in Thr18, as is endogenous p53 upon VRK1 overexpression. As we describe, VRK1 overexpression induces p53 acetylation in residues Lys373 and Lys382 (Fig. 6A ), typically acetylated by p300, and enhances the formation of stable p53-p300 complexes (Fig. 6B ). These data suggest a mechanism by which VRK1 can stabilize and induce p53 transcriptional activity. However, VRK1 is able to induce the accumulation of the nonphosphorylatable p53 mutant T18A, a mutant that has been shown to have some of the properties of the phosphorylated protein. This observation leaves the door open to another possible mechanism, in addition to the direct phosphorylation of p53. This mechanism might involve phosphorylation or interaction with other activators of p53, such as p300, linking the two effects. Phosphorylation might favor the binding of p53 to other stabilizing molecules, perhaps by a docking mechanism in which VRK1-p53 transient interaction might favor the activation of p53 by promoting binding to other effectors, with p53 phosphorylation by VRK1 being an indispensable mechanism ( 8 ). VRK1 could also affect the action of other p53 ubiquitin ligases, such as COP1 and Pirh2 ( 14 , 24 ), or another that has not yet been found, leading to p53 stabilization by interfering with proteasome-dependent p53 degradation. These proteins exert their effects independently of Mdm2 and bind to p53 in a different region, explaining why VRK1 is still capable of stabilizing p53 in the absence of Mdm2 or with the T18A mutation. The abolition of the effect of VRK1 on MG132-stabilized p53 even in the absence of Mdm2 might indicate that VRK1 is still acting by disruption of p53 degradation. VRK1 activation of p53 might also involve a cooperative effect with other kinases. Indeed, an increase in Ser15 phosphorylation can be observed after VRK1 overexpression (Fig. 7A ). Nevertheless, the effect of VRK1 on p53 could still be seen in the presence of ATM kinase inhibitors (unpublished data), such as caffeine or wortmannin ( 42 ), indicating that prior phosphorylation of these residues by this kinase is not necessary. This alternative mechanism remains to be elucidated and is under investigation.

The phosphorylation of p53 is probably conditioned by the particular set of kinases activated in response to a specific stimulus. Thr18 phosphorylation is a component of the cell response to genotoxic damage, in which a complex web of signaling pathways converge in several p53 residues, such as Ser15, Thr18, and Ser20 ( 38 ). Thr18 phosphorylation has been reported to be carried out specifically by Chk2 ( 8 ), although the role of this kinase in the p53 pathway is controversial ( 1 , 51 ), and by CK1, with the prior phosphorylation of Ser 15 ( 16 , 39 ). A docking mechanism between p53 and Chk2 has been proposed that leads to p53 phosphorylation in Thr18 and Ser20 by this kinase ( 8 ). VRK1 phosphorylation of p53 is independent of the Chk2 role, as can be seen, for example, when a dominant-negative form of the protein is expressed together with VRK1 (Fig. 2C and 6A ).

The consequence of the p53 accumulation induced by VRK1 is the activation of transcription of p53-dependent promoters, such as a synthetic p53 response element, or some specific promoters, such as the p21 promoter. This observation is consistent with the parallel accumulation of p21 protein when there is phosphorylation of Thr18 in response to irradiation and with the promotion of binding to general transcription factors, such as TAF II 31 ( 20 ).

Nothing is known about the regulation and stimulation of VRK1 activity. VRK1 activity by itself is not affected by genotoxic treatment with adriamycin, etoposide, or hydroxyurea, thus excluding response to these stresses as the physiological connection between VRK1 and p53. VRK1 is ubiquitously expressed, and its expression is high in all cell types tested. The highest levels are detected in proliferating cells, such as the expansion of the murine hematopoietic system ( 49 ), proliferating tumor cell lines ( 34 ), or the proliferation compartment in tumor biopsies (unpublished). The data obtained from the homologous C. elegans protein also point to a role in the regulation of cell proliferation ( 22 ). Using specific siRNA experiments to transiently suppress VRK1 protein expression, we have shown that human VRK1 is also important for normal proliferation. Cells without VRK1 have different defects in proliferation, being unable to complete normal cell division and inducing cell death in some cases (Fig. 8 ). The exact mechanism of this effect needs to be further characterized. We propose a model for VRK1 action on p53 (Fig. 9 ). Under physiological nonstress conditions, the VRK1-p53 connection might function as a basic mechanism that maintains a basal level of p53 protein in a ready status. VRK1 might induce an initial activation of p53 that is not sufficient to trigger a full p53 response but is enough to respond to minor and suboptimal damage, such as an occasional individual replication block, during normal proliferation, and it possibly induces the full activation of p53 in case of severe damage during cell division (Fig. 9 ). This minor activation of p53 by VRK1 could help maintain a basal level of expression of p53. When severe or catastrophic damage occurs, such as exposure to irradiation or chemotherapeutic drugs, additional mechanisms that promote additional effects in addition to repair, such as growth arrest or apoptosis, become active (Fig. 9 ). These secondary mechanisms are very well characterized and implicate well-known kinases, as the ATM-Chk2 or ATR-Chk1 route.

We conclude that VRK1 represents a new regulator of cell proliferation and could also be the first step in a new pathway regulating p53 in normal proliferating cells that might function as a switch controlling the proteins that interact with p53 and thus modify its stability and activity.
