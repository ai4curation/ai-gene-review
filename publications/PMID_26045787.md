Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of neurodegenerative 
disease. There is a growing interest in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) over 
the years due to its involvement in AD. Besides its role in pathological 
mechanisms of AD, APP participates in many signaling pathways as well. APP 
functions through protein-protein interactions, and in this report staufen 1 
(STAU1) is demonstrated to have interaction with APP, using yeast two-hybrid 
screening and co-immunoprecipitation in mammalian system. STAU1 belongs to the 
double-stranded RNA binding protein family and can mediate mRNA degradation in 
mammalian system, implicating that APP may be involved in the regulation of mRNA 
as well.
