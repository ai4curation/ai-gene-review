Exosomes are nanovesicles that are released from cells as a mechanism of 
cell-free intercellular communication. Only a limited number of proteins have 
been identified from the plasma exosome proteome. Here, we developed a 
multi-step fractionation scheme incorporating gel exclusion chromatography, rate 
zonal centrifugation through continuous sucrose gradients, and high-speed 
centrifugation to purify exosomes from human plasma. Exosome-associated proteins 
were separated by SDS-PAGE and 66 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS, which 
included both cellular and extracellular proteins. Furthermore, we identified 
and characterized peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), 
a nuclear receptor that regulates adipocyte differentiation and proliferation, 
as well as immune and inflammatory cell functions, as a novel component of 
plasma-derived exosomes. Given the important role of exosomes as intercellular 
messengers, the discovery of PPARgamma as a component of human plasma exosomes 
identifies a potential new pathway for the paracrine transfer of nuclear 
receptors.
