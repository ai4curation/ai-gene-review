BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Interferons are a family of cytokines with growth 
inhibitory and antiviral functions, which exert their biological actions through 
the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The human ISG12 family of 
proteins comprises ISG12A, ISG12B, ISG12C and ISG6-16. Due to differential 
splicing and a gene variation, the human ISG12A protein exists as a full-length 
ISG12A form and three ISG12A variants. ISG12 genes have been found 
transcriptionally dysregulated in many disorders. High levels of ISG12A mRNA 
have been found in breast and ovarian cancers. Loss of heterozygosity at the 
position of the ISG12 genes often occurs in ovarian carcinomas and lymphoblastic 
leukemias. Both ISG12A and ISG6-16 are up-regulated in psoriasis.
RESULTS: We demonstrate here that expression of the human full-length ISG12A 
protein sensitises cells for TNFα and the BH3 mimetic gossypol induced 
apoptosis, and the other ISG12A variants as well as ISG12B and ISG12C can induce 
apoptosis directly in HEK293 cells. Also ISG6-16 sensitises HEK293 cells for 
gossypol-induced apoptosis. In the ISG12 motif, two putative Bcl-2 homology 
(BH)3 like motifs were found, which may be decisive for the apoptotic properties 
of the ISG12 proteins. A series of BH3 mutants was made in ISG12AΔ-S, the 
smallest apoptosis-inducing ISG12A variant and our results indicate that 
ISG12AΔ-S indeed possesses features resembling those of BH3-only proteins. 
Supporting this notion are our findings that the full-length ISG12A 
co-immunoprecipitates with the Bcl-2 protein, and the apoptotic properties of 
the ISG12A variants are reduced in Bcl-2 expressing HEK293 cells. In addition, 
full-length ISG12A is able to form homodimers, which suggests a possible 
involvement in pore formation during apoptosis. The full-length ISG12A, the 
three ISG12A variants and the ISG12B proteins were found to be localised in the 
mitochondria.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the ISG12 family of proteins has an 
important role for the apoptotic properties induced by type 1 interferon.
SIGNIFICANCE: The ISG12 family constitute small hydrophic proteins involved in 
apoptosis. This is the first comparison of the apoptotic potentials of the 
full-length ISG12A protein and the three ISG12A variants. The differential 
apoptotic potentials of these proteins might have an impact on the strategies to 
monitor and interpret their dysregulation associated with many disorders.
