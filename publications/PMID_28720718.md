Mutations in LRRK2, which encodes leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, are the most 
common genetic cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), a 
degenerative disease of the central nervous system that causes impaired motor 
function and, in advanced stages, dementia. Dementia is a common symptom of 
another neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, and research suggests 
that there may be pathophysiological and genetic links between the two diseases. 
Aggregates of β amyloid [a protein produced through cleavage of amyloid 
precursor protein (APP)] are seen in both diseases and in PD patients carrying 
G2019S-mutant LRRK2. Using patient-derived cells, brain tissue, and PD model 
mice, we found that LRRK2 interacted with and phosphorylated APP at Thr668 
within its intracellular domain (AICD). Phosphorylation of APP at Thr668 
promoted AICD transcriptional activity and correlated with increased nuclear 
abundance of AICD and decreased abundance of a dopaminergic neuron marker in 
cultures and brain tissue. The AICD regulates the transcription of genes 
involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and apoptosis. Overexpression of AICD, but not 
a phosphodeficient mutant (AICDT668A), increased the loss of dopaminergic 
neurons in older mice expressing LRRK2G2019S Moreover, the amount of 
Thr668-phosphorylated APP was substantially greater in postmortem brain tissue 
and dopaminergic neurons (generated by reprogramming skin cells) from 
LRRK2G2019S patients than in those from healthy individuals. LRRK2 inhibitors 
reduced the phosphorylation of APP at Thr668 in the patient-derived dopaminergic 
neurons and in the midbrains of LRRK2G2019S mice. Thus, APP is a substrate of 
LRRK2, and its phosphorylation promotes AICD function and neurotoxicity in PD.
