Cytokine-activated receptors initiate intracellular signaling by recruiting 
protein kinases that phosphorylate the receptors on tyrosine residues, thus 
enabling docking of SH2 domain-bearing activating factors. Here we report that 
in response to type 1 interferon (IFNalpha), IFNalpha receptors recruit 
cytoplasmic CREB-binding protein (CBP). By binding to IFNalphaR2 within the 
region where two adjacent proline boxes bear phospho-Ser364 and phospho-Ser384, 
CBP acetylates IFNalphaR2 on Lys399, which in turn serves as the docking site 
for interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9). IRF9 interacts with the acetyl-Lys399 
motif by means of its IRF homology2 (IH2) domain, leading to formation of the 
ISGF3 complex that includes IRF9, STAT1, and STAT2. All three components are 
acetylated by CBP. Remarkably, acetylation within the DNA-binding domain (DBD) 
of both IRF9 and STAT2 is critical for the ISGF3 complex activation and its 
associated antiviral gene regulation. These results have significant 
implications concerning the central role of acetylation in cytokine receptor 
signal transduction.
