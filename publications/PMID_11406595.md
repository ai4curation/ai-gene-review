Initiation of transcription of protein-encoding genes by RNA polymerase II (Pol 
II) was thought to require transcription factor TFIID, a complex comprised of 
the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAF(II)s). In the 
presence of TBP-free TAF(II) complex (TFTC), initiation of Pol II transcription 
can occur in the absence of TFIID. TFTC containing the GCN5 acetyltransferase 
acetylates histone H3 in a nucleosomal context. We have identified a 130 kDa 
subunit of TFTC (SAP130) that shares homology with the large subunit of 
UV-damaged DNA-binding factor. TFTC preferentially binds UV-irradiated DNA, 
UV-damaged DNA inhibits TFTC-mediated Pol II transcription and TFTC is recruited 
in parallel with the nucleotide excision repair protein XP-A to UV-damaged DNA. 
TFTC preferentially acetylates histone H3 in nucleosomes assembled on UV-damaged 
DNA. In agreement with this, strong histone H3 acetylation occurs in intact 
cells after UV irradiation. These results suggest that the access of DNA repair 
machinery to lesions within chromatin may be facilitated by TFTC via covalent 
modification of chromatin. Thus, our experiments reveal a molecular link between 
DNA damage recognition and chromatin modification.
