Core binding factor (CBF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of 
two distinct subunits. The monomeric beta subunit is ubiquitously expressed, 
whereas expression of the three alpha subunits isolated previously seems to be 
restricted mainly to hematopoietic tissues. To isolate additional alpha genes, 
degenerate oligonucleotides derived from the runt domain--a region shared by all 
alpha genes--were used for screening cDNA libraries. A 228-bp fragment was 
isolated from a mouse thymus cDNA library, which showed 82 and 76% DNA sequence 
identity to the previously isolated murine alpha genes, Cbfa1 and Cbfa2. This 
novel alpha gene was named Cbfa3. The corresponding sequence from the human 
homolog CBFA3 was obtained by cosmid cloning and sequencing of the appropriate 
restriction fragment. The corresponding regions of mouse Cbfa3 and human CBFA3 
show 91% nucleotide identity and 100% protein identity. In situ hybridization 
and physical mapping of somatic cell hybrids localized CBFA3 to chromosome 
1p35-pter.
