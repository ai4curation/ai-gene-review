Type I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) are essential for immune defense against 
viruses and induced through the actions of the cytoplasmic helicases, RIG-I and 
MDA5, and their downstream adaptor molecule IPS-1. TRAF6 and the downstream 
kinase TAK1 have been shown to be essential for the production of 
proinflammatory cytokines through the TLR/MyD88/TRIF pathway. Although binding 
of TRAF6 with IPS-1 has been demonstrated, the role of the TRAF6 pathway in 
IFN-alpha/beta production has not been fully understood. Here, we demonstrate 
that TRAF6 is critical for IFN-alpha/beta induction in response to viral 
infection and intracellular double-stranded RNA, poly(I:C). Activation of 
NF-kappaB, JNK, and p38, but not IRF3, was impaired in TRAF6-deficient mouse 
embryo fibroblasts in response to vesicular stomatitis virus and poly(I:C). 
However, TAK1 was not required for IFN-beta induction in this process, since 
normal IFN-alpha/beta production was observed in TAK1-deficient mouse embryo 
fibroblasts. Instead, another MAP3K, MEKK1, was important for the activation of 
the IFN-beta promoter in response to poly(I:C). Forced expression of MEKK1 in 
combination with IRF3 was sufficient for the induction of IFN-beta, whereas 
suppression of MEKK1 expression by small interfering RNA inhibited the induction 
of IFN-beta by poly(I:C). These data suggest that IPS-1 requires TRAF6 and MEKK1 
to activate NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinases that are critical 
for the optimal induction of type I interferons.

Abstract

Type I interferons (IFN-α/β) are essential for immune defense
 against viruses and induced through the actions of the cytoplasmic helicases,
 RIG-I and MDA5, and their downstream adaptor molecule IPS-1. TRAF6 and the
 downstream kinase TAK1 have been shown to be essential for the production of
 proinflammatory cytokines through the TLR/MyD88/TRIF pathway. Although binding
 of TRAF6 with IPS-1 has been demonstrated, the role of the TRAF6 pathway in
 IFN-α/β production has not been fully understood. Here, we
 demonstrate that TRAF6 is critical for IFN-α/β induction in
 response to viral infection and intracellular double-stranded RNA, poly(I:C).
 Activation of NF-κB, JNK, and p38, but not IRF3, was impaired in
 TRAF6-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts in response to vesicular stomatitis
 virus and poly(I:C). However, TAK1 was not required for IFN-β induction
 in this process, since normal IFN-α/β production was observed in
 TAK1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts. Instead, another MAP3K, MEKK1, was
 important for the activation of the IFN-β promoter in response to
 poly(I:C). Forced expression of MEKK1 in combination with IRF3 was sufficient
 for the induction of IFN-β, whereas suppression of MEKK1 expression by
 small interfering RNA inhibited the induction of IFN-β by poly(I:C).
 These data suggest that IPS-1 requires TRAF6 and MEKK1 to activate NF-κB
 and mitogen-activated protein kinases that are critical for the optimal
 induction of type I interferons.

RESULTS

TRAF6 Is Required for Type I IFN Production Induced by Intracellular
 dsRNA —TRAF6 is an essential adaptor protein for production of
 proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-12, in macrophages and DCs in
 response to TLR ligands ( 24 ).
 However, the role of TRAF6 in antiviral immunity and type I IFN production has
 not been clarified. To address this issue, we first infected TRAF6-deficient
 MEFs with the IFN-sensitive prototypic rhabdovirus, VSV. TRAF6-deficient MEFs
 were more vulnerable to virus infection than wild-type MEFs. Virus-induced
 cytolysis and Annexin V-positive fraction, including early apoptotic cells and
 dead cells, were markedly increased after 12-h infection in TRAF6-deficient
 MEFs compared with wild-type cells ( Fig.
 1 A ). This was probably due to reduced IFN production in
 TRAF6-deficient MEFs, because the enhanced cell death of the mutant MEFs was
 rescued by adding exogenous IFN-β
 ( Fig. 1 A ). To
 investigate the role of TRAF6 in type I IFN induction, MEFs as well as
 conventional DCs (cDCs) from wild-type and TRAF6-deficient mice were infected
 with VSV. Induction of IFN-α, IFN-β, and IP-10 was almost
 completely diminished in TRAF6-deficient cDCs
 ( Fig. 1 B ) and
 remarkably reduced in TRAF6-deficient MEFs
 ( Fig. 1 C , left ). To mimic intracellular dsRNA generated during viral
 replication, we also transfected synthetic dsRNA, poly(I:C), into MEFs, using
 a lipid-based transfection reagent, FuGENE HD. Up-regulation of
 IFN-α/β mRNA, but not IP-10 mRNA, was also severely impaired in
 TRAF6-deficient MEFs in response to poly(I:C)
 ( Fig. 1 C , right ). These data suggest that TRAF6 is required for type I IFN
 production induced by intracellular dsRNA.

TRAF6 Is Involved in the RLH/IPS-1 Pathway to Activate the
 IFN- β Promoter —To understand the molecular mechanism
 by which TRAF6 induces type I IFNs in the context of intracellular dsRNA
 recognition, we first transfected wild-type MEFs with poly(I:C) using FuGENE
 HD and then examined the effect of inhibitors of various signaling molecules
 downstream of TRAF6 on IFN-β production
 ( Fig. 2 A ). The
 up-regulation of mRNA expression for IFN-β and IP-10 induced by poly(I:C)
 was strongly suppressed by inhibitors of IKK (IKK-2 inhibitor VI), JNK
 (SP60025), and p38 (SB203580) but not by an inhibitor of MEK (upstream of ERK)
 (U0126), suggesting that the activation of IKK, p38 and JNK pathways is
 required for IFN-β expression. Next we transfected HEK293T cells with
 IRF3, TRAF6, or both constructs along with an IFN-β promoter-luciferase
 reporter gene ( Fig.
 2 B ). Although overexpression of TRAF6 can activate both
 IKK and MAPK pathways required for IFN-β expression, the IFN-β
 promoter was only marginally activated by TRAF6 overexpression. However,
 cotransfection of TRAF6 and IRF3 exhibited a strong activation of the
 promoter, indicating that TRAF6 and IRF3 cooperatively activate the IFN-β
 promoter. Taken together, these results support the notion that the optimal
 activation of IFN-β promoter by intracellular dsRNA requires the
 coordinate activation of transcription factors IRF3, NF-κB, and
 ATF-2/c-Jun ( 14 , 15 ).

Next we investigated whether TRAF6 functions at the downstream of the
 RIG-I/IPS-1 pathway. Overexpression of either RIG-IN (constitutively active
 form of RIG-I) or IPS-1 activated IFN-β promoter in HEK293T cells,
 whereas this was strongly suppressed by forced expression of the dominant
 negative form of TRAF6 (DN-TRAF6) in a dose-dependent manner
 ( Fig. 2 C , left ). Similarly, DN-TRAF6 suppressed NF-κB activation induced
 by RIG-IN or IPS-1 ( Fig.
 2 C , right ). To ensure the role of TRAF6 in the
 RLH-mediated pathway, we further examined the IFN-β reporter assay in
 TRAF6-deficient MEFs. As shown in Fig.
 2 D , the activation of IFN-β promoter as well as
 NF-κB induced by forced expression of IPS-1 or transfection with
 poly(I:C) was severely impaired in TRAF6-deficient cells. These results
 suggest that RLH/IPS-1 pathway activates NF-κB via TRAF6, which is
 essential for the full activation of the IFN-β promoter.

To further dissect the signaling pathways downstream of TRAF6, we assessed
 the activation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. As shown in Fig. 2 E , the
 homodimerization of IRF3, reflecting the activation of the molecule, was
 induced by poly(I:C) in MEFs even in the absence of TRAF6. To observe the
 nuclear translocation of IRF3 as well as NF-κB subunit, p65, we
 stimulated wild-type and TRAF6-deficent MEFs with poly(I:C) along with FuGENE
 HD and then stained the cells with anti-IRF3 and anti-p65 antibodies
 ( Fig. 2 F ). Three hours
 after stimulation, ∼30% of knock-out MEFs exhibited nuclear translocation
 of IRF3, which was comparable with that of wild-type MEFs. These results
 indicate that the activation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 are independent
 of TRAF6. However, nuclear translocation of p65 was impaired in TRAF6-dficient
 MEFs. Although all of the wild-type MEFs exhibited co-localization of p65 and
 IRF3 in the nucleus, more than 50% of TRAF6-deficient MEFs showed cytoplasmic
 retention of p65 but nuclear translocation of IRF3
 ( Fig. 2 F ). These data
 are consistent with previous results showing a defective NF-κB
 activation in the absence of functional TRAF6 in the reporter assay
 ( Fig. 2, C and D ). Moreover, poly(I:C)-induced phosphorylation of JNK
 and p38 was severely impaired in TRAF6-deficieint MEFs
 ( Fig. 2 G ). Taken
 together, TRAF6 appears to contribute to the activation of NF-κB and
 MAPK pathways rather than IRF3 activation in the RLH/IPS-1 signaling pathway
 in MEFs.

TAK1 Is Not Essential for RLH/IPS-1-mediated IFN- β Induction —TAK1 is essential for the TRAF6-dependent activation
 of NF-κB and MAPKs in Toll-like/IL-1 receptor signaling
 ( 23 ). Hence, we next examined
 whether TAK1 is involved in the RLH/IPS-1 signaling pathway. First we analyzed
 the ability of wild-type and TAK1-deficient MEFs to induce type I IFNs in
 response to VSV infection and poly(I:C) transfection. As shown in Fig. 3 A , the induction
 of IFN-α/β in TAK1-deficient MEFs was comparable with that in
 wild-type MEFs. IFN-β promoter reporter activity enhanced by IPS-1 or
 poly(I:C) was not impaired in TAK1-deficient MEFs
 ( Fig. 3 B , left ). NF-κB activity was also normally elevated by forced
 expression of IPS-1 in TAK1-deficient MEFs
 ( Fig. 3 B , middle ), whereas lipopolysaccharide stimulation failed to up-regulate
 the NF-κB activity in the knock-out cells
 ( Fig. 3 B , right ). The dimerization of IRF3 induced by poly(I:C) was also not
 affected by TAK1 deficiency ( Fig.
 3 C ). When we examined the nuclear translocation of p65
 and IRF3, co-localization of both transcription factors in the nuclei was
 observed in both wild-type and TAK1-deficient MEFs at the same ratio
 ( Fig. 3 D ). These
 results suggest that TAK1 is not required for type I IFN induction in the
 RLH/IPS-1-mediated signaling pathway.

MEKK1 Is a Candidate MAP3K to Induce IFN- β in the
 RLH/IPS-1 Pathway —Since TAK1 was not necessary for type I IFN
 induction in the RLH/IPS-1 pathway, we sought a responsible MAP3K involved in
 the IPS-1/TRAF6-mediated signal. MEKK1 (MEK kinase-1) and MEKK3 have been
 implicated in the activation of IKK and MAPKK, leading to the activation of
 NF-κB and JNK ( 27 ). To
 examine whether MEKK1 or MEKK3 is involved in the RIG-I/IPS-1 pathway, we
 performed an IFN-β and NF-κB reporter assay using kinase-inactive
 mutants of MEKK1 (knMEKK1) and MEKK3 (knMEKK3). As shown in Fig. 4 A , IPS-1- and
 RIG-IN-induced IFN-β promoter and NF-κB activities were inhibited
 efficiently by knMEKK1 and to a lesser extent by knMEKK3. Next we examined the
 effect of overexpression of MEKK1 and MEKK3. The forced expression of IRF3,
 MEKK1, or MEKK3 alone was not sufficient for the activation of the IFN-β
 promoter; however, cotransfection of IRF3 and MEKK1, but not MEKK3
 synergistically activated the promoter activity
 ( Fig. 4 B ). In order to
 confirm the significance of endogenous MEKK1 and MEKK3, we performed
 siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments. Wild-type MEFs were transfected with
 scrambled control, MEKK1, or MEKK3 siRNA construct, and then endogenous gene
 expression of MEKK1 as well as MEKK3 was sufficiently suppressed
 ( Fig. 4 C ). The
 knockdown of MEKK1, but not MEKK3, resulted in a severe reduction of
 IFN-β mRNA expression induced by poly(I:C)
 ( Fig. 4 C ). Induction
 of mRNA for IP-10 was slightly suppressed in the MEKK1 knockdown MEFs.
 Significant reduction of IFN-α and IFN-β levels by knockdown of
 MEKK1 with different siRNA oligonucleotides was also confirmed by real time
 PCR ( Fig. 4 D ).
 Furthermore, the suppression of type I IFNs by siRNA for MEKK1 was reverted by
 forced expression of rat MEKK1 ( Fig.
 4 E ). These results indicate that endogenous MEKK1 but not
 MEKK3 is required for type I IFN production induced by cytoplasmic dsRNA.

DISCUSSION

Recent studies have shown that the RLH family of intracellular receptors
 detect viral nucleic acid and signal through IPS-1 (also known as MAVS,
 CARDIF, and VISA) during viral infection
 ( 1 – 3 ).
 IPS-1 recruits TRAF3, which in turn activates TBK1 and IKK- i , leading
 to the activation of IRF3
 ( 22 ). IPS-1 also activates
 NF-κB via the FADD/RIP1 pathway mediated by caspase-8 and -10
 ( 16 , 28 ). In this study, we have
 found that TRAF6 and MEKK1 were involved in the downstream pathway of IPS-1,
 which facilitates NF-κB and MAPKs to enhance the type I IFN promoter. It
 has been shown that there are two distinct types of TIM; one is the
 P X E XX (acidic or aromatic residue) motif for TRAF6, and the
 other is the P X Q X (T/S) motif for other TRAFs, such as TRAF2
 and TRAF3 ( 29 ). IPS-1 contains
 multiple TIMs, and TRAF1, -2, -3, -5, and -6 can interact with IPS-1 (data not
 shown) (see Refs. 18 and 22 ). Furthermore, TRAF3 is
 required for the activation of IRF3 but not NF-κB
 ( 21 ), whereas TRAF6 is
 required for the activation of NF-κB and MAPK but not IRF3. Thus, the
 IPS-1·TRAF complex is a divergent point of the RLH/IPS-1-mediated
 signal ( Fig. 5 ). A similar case
 of the signal divergence regulated by TRAF6 and TRAF3 in the context of
 MyD88-dependent signaling pathway has been reported
 ( 20 ).

IKK and MAPK activities result from the activation of upstream MAP3Ks, such
 as TAK1, MEKK1, MEKK3, and NIK. In viral infection or dsRNA stimulation,
 TAK1-deficient cells normally induced type I IFN, and we could not detect the
 activation of TAK1 in wild-type cells in response to dsRNA (data not shown).
 Our findings suggest that TAK1 is not very necessary for virus-induced type I
 IFN production. The TAK1-independent mechanism should be controlled by TRAF6
 in the RLH/IPS-1 signal pathway. Thus, we have made an attempt to identify the
 responsible MAP3K. TRAF6-interacting protein, ECSIT, has been shown to mediate
 the activation of NF-κB and JNK in TLR pathway
 ( 30 ). ECSIT binds to and
 activates MEKK1, which in turn activates IKK. MEKK3 has also been implicated
 in the activation of IKK and MAPKK, leading to the activation of NF-κB
 and JNK. For instance, the activation of NF-κB and JNK by TLR8 is
 TAK1-independent but MEKK3-dependent
 ( 31 ). Thus, it might be
 possible that MEKK1 and/or MEKK3 is involved in IPS-1/TRAF6-mediated IKK and
 MAPK activation. Our results indicate that MEKK1 is involved in the activation
 of the IFN-β promoter in the RLH/IPS-1-mediated anti-viral signal
 pathway. Forced expression of MEKK1 and IRF3 cooperatively activated the
 IFN-β promoter, whereas knockdown of MEKK1 resulted in the reduction of
 IFN-β production. The knMEKK1 suppressed the NF-κB activation.
 Therefore, although the precise mechanism currently remains unclear, MEKK1
 seems to be necessary for the activation of IPS-1/TRAF6 pathway. Further
 analysis is necessary to understand how MEKK1, but not TAK1, is activated
 during viral infection. IPS-1 localizes in the outer mitochondrial membrane;
 thus, one possibility is that the localization of IPS-1 may induce the
 downstream kinase differently from that in TLR pathway.

IPS-1-deficient mice were found to be defective in the production of type I
 IFNs in response to all RNA viruses recognized by either RIG-I or MDA5,
 suggesting a central role in the production of type I IFNs upon viral
 infection ( 32 , 33 ). IRF3 and IRF7 were also
 shown to be indispensable for type I IFN production
 ( 34 , 35 ). On the other hand, we
 found that TRAF6-deficient MEFs did not completely lose the ability to induce
 type I IFNs, probably due to partial NF-κB activation by other
 mechanisms. It has been reported that IPS-1 interacts with both FADD and RIP1
 ( 16 ). Both FADD and RIP1 have
 been reported to be critical for the induction of type I IFNs in response to
 poly(I:C) ( 36 ). Thus, we
 speculate that the absence of TRAF6 in the RLH/IPS-1 pathway is compensated
 for by the signal mediated by FADD and RIP1 to induce type I IFNs. Further
 investigation is necessary to clarify this point. dsRNA is also recognized by
 TLR3 in certain cell types, and TRAF6 has been shown to be involved in the
 pathway depending on TRIF. However, the function of TRAF6 in TLR3 signaling
 remains controversial. The activation of NF-κB by poly(I:C) is abrogated
 in TRAF6-deficient MEFs, whereas NF-κB activation occurs normally in
 TRAF6-deficient macrophages in response to dsRNA
 ( 37 , 38 ). Cell type-specific
 involvement of TRAF6 was suggested in the TRIF-mediated NF-κB
 activation. Nevertheless, in our data, TRAF6-deficient cDCs infected with VSV
 showed a severe defect in the production of type I IFNs, indicating that TRAF6
 plays an essential role in cDC for type I IFN production in response to RNA
 viral infection.

In the present study, we examined the role of TRAF6, TAK1, MEKK1, and MEKK3
 in the RLH/IPS-1-mediated IFN-β induction. Based on data published
 recently and presented here, we propose a model for a RLH-IPS-1-mediated
 signaling pathway via TRAF6 ( Fig.
 5 ). Upon RNA viral infection, RIG-I or MAD5 recognizes the viral
 dsRNA and then recruits IPS-1 through the CRAD domain. IPS-1 associates with
 TRAF3, TRAF6, FADD, and RIP1. TRAF3 activates TBK1/IKK- i , leading to
 the activation of IRF3, whereas TRAF6 may interact with MEKK1, which in turn
 contributes to the activation of IKK and MAPKK, leading to the activation of
 NF-κB and AP-1. These transcription factors cooperatively activate the
 IFN-β expression.
