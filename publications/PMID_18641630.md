Although many animals use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and 
navigation, the precise biophysical mechanisms underlying magnetic sensing have 
been elusive. One theoretical model proposes that geomagnetic fields are 
perceived by chemical reactions involving specialized photoreceptors. However, 
the specific photoreceptor involved in such magnetoreception has not been 
demonstrated conclusively in any animal. Here we show that the 
ultraviolet-A/blue-light photoreceptor cryptochrome (Cry) is necessary for 
light-dependent magnetosensitive responses in Drosophila melanogaster. In a 
binary-choice behavioural assay for magnetosensitivity, wild-type flies show 
significant naive and trained responses to a magnetic field under full-spectrum 
light ( approximately 300-700 nm) but do not respond to the field when 
wavelengths in the Cry-sensitive, ultraviolet-A/blue-light part of the spectrum 
(<420 nm) are blocked. Notably, Cry-deficient cry(0) and cry(b) flies do not 
show either naive or trained responses to a magnetic field under full-spectrum 
light. Moreover, Cry-dependent magnetosensitivity does not require a functioning 
circadian clock. Our work provides, to our knowledge, the first genetic evidence 
for a Cry-based magnetosensitive system in any animal.
