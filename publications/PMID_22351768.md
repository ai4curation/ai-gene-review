The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is essential for ensuring the proper 
attachment of kinetochores to the spindle and, thus, the precise separation of 
paired sister chromatids during mitosis. The SAC proteins are recruited to the 
unattached kinetochores for activation of the SAC in prometaphase. However, it 
has been less studied whether activation of the SAC also requires the proteins 
that do not localize to the kinetochores. Here, we show that the nuclear protein 
RED, also called IK, a down-regulator of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) II, 
interacts with the human SAC protein MAD1. Two RED-interacting regions 
identified in MAD1 are from amino acid residues 301-340 and 439-480, designated 
as MAD1(301-340) and MAD1(439-480), respectively. Our observations reveal that 
RED is a spindle pole-associated protein that colocalizes with MAD1 at the 
spindle poles in metaphase and anaphase. Depletion of RED can cause a shorter 
mitotic timing, a failure in the kinetochore localization of MAD1 in 
prometaphase, and a defect in the SAC. Furthermore, the RED-interacting peptides 
MAD1(301-340) and MAD1(439-480), fused to enhanced green fluorescence protein, 
can colocalize with RED at the spindle poles in prometaphase, and their 
expression can abrogate the SAC. Taken together, we conclude that RED is 
required for kinetochore localization of MAD1, mitotic progression, and 
activation of the SAC.
