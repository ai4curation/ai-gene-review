In Drosophila and mammals, insulin signalling can increase growth, progression 
through G1/S, cell size and tissue size. Here, we analyse the way insulin 
affects cell size and cell-cycle progression in two haemocyte-derived Drosophila 
cell lines. Surprisingly, we find that although insulin increases cell size, it 
slows the rate at which these cells increase in number. By using BrdU 
pulse-chase to label S-phase cells and follow their progression through the cell 
cycle, we show that insulin delays progression through G2/M, thereby slowing 
cell division. The ability of insulin to slow progression through G2/M is 
independent of its ability to stimulate progression through G1/S, so is not a 
consequence of feedback by the cell-cycle machinery to maintain cell-cycle 
length. Insulin's effects on progression through G2/M are mediated by 
dTOR/dRaptor signalling. Partially inhibiting dTOR/dRaptor signalling by dsRNAi 
or mild rapamycin treatment can increase cell number in cultured haemocytes and 
the Drosophila wing, respectively. Thus, insulin signalling can influence cell 
number depending on a balance between its ability to accelerate progression 
through G1/S and delay progression through G2/M.
