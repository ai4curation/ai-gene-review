Human glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) is a transmembrane metallopeptidase 
found mainly in the brain, small intestine, and prostate. In the brain, it 
cleaves N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-glutamate, liberating free glutamate. Inhibition of 
GCPII has been shown to be neuroprotective in models of stroke and other 
neurodegenerations. In prostate, it is known as prostate-specific membrane 
antigen, a cancer marker. Recently, human glutamate carboxypeptidase III 
(GCPIII), a GCPII homolog with 67% amino acid identity, was cloned. While GCPII 
is recognized as an important pharmaceutical target, no biochemical study of 
human GCPIII is available at present. Here, we report the cloning, expression, 
and characterization of recombinant human GCPIII. We show that GCPIII lacks 
dipeptidylpeptidase IV-like activity, its activity is dependent on 
N-glycosylation, and it is effectively inhibited by several known inhibitors of 
GCPII. In comparison to GCPII, GCPIII has lower 
N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-glutamate-hydrolyzing activity, different pH and salt 
concentration dependence, and distinct substrate specificity, indicating that 
these homologs might play different biological roles. Based on a molecular 
model, we provide interpretation of the distinct substrate specificity of both 
enzymes, and examine the amino acid residues responsible for the differences by 
site-directed mutagenesis. These results may help to design potent and selective 
inhibitors of both enzymes.
