Mutations in ATP8B1 cause progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 
(PFIC1) and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (BRIC1), forming a 
spectrum of cholestatic disease. Whereas PFIC1 is a progressive, endstage liver 
disease, BRIC1 patients suffer from episodic periods of cholestasis that resolve 
spontaneously. At present it is not clear how the type and location of the 
mutations relate to the clinical manifestations of PFIC1 and BRIC1. ATP8B1 
localizes to the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes where it mediates the 
inward translocation of phosphatidylserine. ATP8B1 interacts with CDC50A, which 
is required for endoplasmic reticulum exit and plasma membrane localization. In 
this study we analyzed a panel of missense mutations causing PFIC1 (G308V, 
D554N, G1040R) or BRIC1 (D70N, I661T). In addition, we included two mutations 
that have been associated with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) 
(D70N, R867C). We examined the effect of these mutations on protein stability 
and interaction with CDC50A in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and studied the 
subcellular localization in WIF-B9 cells. Protein stability was reduced for 
three out of six mutations studied. Two out of three PFIC1 mutant proteins did 
not interact with CDC50A, whereas BRIC1/ICP mutants displayed reduced 
interaction. Importantly, none of the PFIC1 mutants were detectable in the 
canalicular membrane of WIF-B9 cells, whereas all BRIC1/ICP mutants displayed 
the same cellular staining pattern as wild-type ATP8B1. Our data indicate that 
PFIC1 mutations lead to the complete absence of canalicular expression, whereas 
in BRIC1/ICP residual protein is expressed in the canalicular membrane.
CONCLUSION: These data provide an explanation for the difference in severity 
between the phenotypes of PFIC1 and BRIC1.
