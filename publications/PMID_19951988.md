Senescence is a tumor suppression mechanism that is induced by several stimuli, 
including oncogenic signaling and telomere shortening, and controlled by the 
p53/p21(WAF1) signaling pathway. Recently, a critical role for secreted factors 
has emerged, suggesting that extracellular signals are necessary for the onset 
and maintenance of senescence. Conversely, factors secreted by senescent cells 
may promote tumor growth. By using expression profiling techniques, we searched 
for secreted factors that were overexpressed in fibroblasts undergoing 
replicative senescence. We identified WNT16B, a member of the WNT family of 
secreted proteins. We found that WNT16B is overexpressed in cells undergoing 
stress-induced premature senescence and oncogene-induced senescence in both MRC5 
cell line and the in vivo murine model of K-Ras(V12)-induced senescence. By 
small interfering RNA experiments, we observed that both p53 and WNT16B are 
necessary for the onset of replicative senescence. WNT16B expression is required 
for the full transcriptional activation of p21(WAF1). Moreover, WNT16B regulates 
activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. Overall, we 
identified WNT16B as a new marker of senescence that regulates p53 activity and 
the PI3K/AKT pathway and is necessary for the onset of replicative senescence.

Introduction

Replicative senescence is a tumor suppression mechanism characterized by an irreversible growth arrest ( 1 ). This phenomenon, first observed after extended culture in vitro by Leonard Hayflick and Paul Moorhead in 1961, is due to telomere shortening ( 2 ). When telomeres become too short, DNA damage sensor proteins are recruited, inducing the stabilization and activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein and its effector p21 WAF1 (CDKN1A), an inhibitor of cell cycle progression ( 3 ). Several other stress-inducing factors can initiate a similar process independently of telomere shortening. This process, termed stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS), can be induced by events such as DNA damage ( 4 ), oxidative stress ( 5 ), epigenetic modifications ( 6 ), or cytokine stimulation ( 7 ). Moreover, premature senescence can be initiated in response to oncogenic stress. For example, the so-called onco-gene-induced senescence (OIS) can occur in response to the activating G12V mutation in Ras proteins ( 8 ). Depending on the type of inducer, cellular senescence is initiated through two complementary tumor suppressor pathways, p53 or p16 INK4A , both pathways leading to irreversible cell cycle arrest ( 9 ).

More recently, it has been established that secreted factors also contribute to the induction and maintenance of senescence. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is required to induce replicative senescence in fibroblasts in an autocrine fashion ( 10 ). Insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-5, IGFBP-7, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, and CXC chemokine receptor 2 were also described as having a role in senescence ( 7 , 11 – 14 ). IL-8 and IL-6 are part of an inflammatory network induced by B-RAF V600E oncogene activation that stimulates the senescent cells in a cell-autonomous manner for the maintenance of senescence. In the absence of one of these factors, cells bypass senescence. Thus, activation of both intracellular and extracellular signals is necessary for the induction and maintenance of cellular senescence.

Although they are characterized by growth arrest, senescent cells remain metabolically active and acquire specific properties, such as resistance to apoptosis and altered gene expression ( 15 ). They express specific markers that allow for their identification both in vitro and in vivo . The senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (SA-β-Gal) assay, based on the lysosomal β-galactosidase enzyme that is active at pH 6 in senescent cells, is generally accepted as a marker of senescence ( 16 , 17 ).

As a tumor suppression mechanism, senescence is associated with the early stage of tumor development. Indeed, it was shown that senescent cells accumulate in premalignant lesions ( 18 ). Hence, development of tools to detect the accumulation of senescent cells in vivo may allow for the identification of neoplasia at an early stage. The specificity of SA-β-Gal staining for senescent cells is underscored by the requirement of invasive detection techniques. PAI-1, IL-6, and IL-8 are candidate biomarkers of senescence because they are soluble factors overexpressed by senescent cells. However, their expression is not specific to senescence and is related to inflammation or other stimuli.

In the present study, we identified WNT16B as a new secreted factor overexpressed in cells undergoing senescence using two models: fibroblastic cell lines and the in vivo OIS model of KRas V12 –induced premalignant lesions. In fibroblasts, WNT16B inhibition prevented activation of the AKT pathway and abrogated p53 transcriptional activity to delay replicative senescence. Thus, WNT16B is a newly uncovered factor secreted by senescent cells in vitro and in vivo that regulates the onset of replicative senescence.

Discussion

Replicative senescence is a permanent state of proliferative arrest resulting from telomere shortening ( 33 ). In replicative senescence, telomere shortening triggers a DNA damage response and the activation of the p53 transcription factor ( 34 ). In turn, p53 transactivates target genes, such as the CDK inhibitor p21 WAF1 , to induce cell cycle arrest. As observed by expression profiling experiments done by us and others ( 35 ), senescent cells are characterized by the downregulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression and DNA replication ( Supplementary Table S3 ), whereas p53 pathway components are overexpressed ( Supplementary Table S2 ). We identified components of the WNT pathway as being activated in replicative senescence and WNT16B as the most overexpressed gene. The WNT proteins are a family of secreted factors that can signal through either β-catenin–dependent or β-catenin–independent pathways ( 36 ). The WNT pathways have been associated with senescence reversal and cellular transformation (WNT2; ref. 6 ). The WNT pathways may also be involved in the activation of senescence because continuous exposure to WNT3A induces premature senescence in mouse fibroblasts ( 26 ). Our work provides a new insight into the functions of WNT pathways in promoting cellular senescence.

WNT16B was initially described as an oncogene able to activate β-catenin in pre-B acute lymphoblastoid leukemia or to signal in a β-catenin–independent manner in basal cell carcinoma ( 20 , 29 ). In the present study, we observed that WNT16B does not activate βcatenin but the AKT pathway. This can be related to what is observed with WNT5A and WNT10B ( 37 , 38 ). Indeed, WNT5A can activate the PI3K/AKT pathway, which inhibits β-catenin function and suppresses cell growth in colorectal cancer cells ( 37 ). Thus, WNT16B, WNT10B, and WNT5A belong to a subfamily of WNT ligands capable of antagonistic activities depending on which signaling pathway is stimulated.

WNT16B was upregulated in SIPS caused by exposure to H 2 O 2 , X-rays, or oncogenic H-Ras V12 . Thus, WNT16B is a bona fide marker of cellular senescence. Along with p21 WAF1 and p16 INK4A , WNT16B can be used to validate the senescence phenotype together with the SA-β-Gal assay. We further validated WNT16B as a marker of senescence in vivo in K-Ras V12 –induced lung adenomas. This model also associates WNT16B with the initial steps of tumorigenesis and suggests that this new marker could be useful as a diagnostic tool for the early detection of tumor formation. Indeed, because WNT16B is a secreted factor, we could expect that the protein would be detectable in body fluids (e.g., in blood) and allow a noninvasive examination ( 39 ).

Both p53 and WNT16B are necessary for the onset of replicative senescence. When p53 is inactivated, senescence is bypassed and WNT16B gene fails to be upregulated. Similarly, WNT16B knockdown delays the onset of senescence and does not allow the transcriptional activation of p53 target genes. Although WNT16B has never been described as a p53 transcriptional target, a bioinformatic analysis identified putative p53 response elements in the WNT16B promoter (data not shown). However, further experiments are needed to determine whether WNT16B is a direct transcriptional target of p53. Alternatively, WNT16B may be necessary for the maintenance of the p53 transcriptional activity in senescence. Indeed, our results show that despite the activation of p53 in WNT16B kd cells, p21 WAF1 is not fully activated. How is WNT16B regulating the p53 pathway? One candidate WNT16Bdependent pathway highlighted here is the PI3K/AKT pathway. Indeed, acute loss of the phosphatase and tensin homologue, an inhibitor of AKT activation in mouse fibroblasts, is responsible for the induction of senescence through the upregulation of ARF and stabilization of the p53 protein ( 40 – 42 ). AKT activation is responsible for the accumulation of reactive oxygen species that are essential to allow the activation of the p53 pathway and the onset of senescence ( 42 ). Thus, we propose that in replicative senescence WNT16B activation is dependent on telomere shortening and subsequent p53 activation. WNT16 may be necessary for the full and maintained transcriptional activity of p53 perhaps through activation of the AKT pathway. The relationship between WNT16B and p53 is different from that described with PAI-1, which is necessary for the onset of senescence but has no effect on p53 activity ( 10 ).

Overall, our study describes the secreted factor WNT16B as a marker and an actor of cellular senescence in vitro and in vivo .
