Hsp105alpha and Hsp105beta are mammalian members of the Hsp105/110 family, a 
divergent subgroup of the Hsp70 family. Hsp105alpha is expressed constitutively 
and induced by various forms of stress, whereas Hsp105beta is an alternatively 
spliced form of Hsp105alpha that is expressed specifically during mild heat 
shock. In a report, it was shown that Hsp105alpha and Hsp105beta localize to the 
cytoplasm and of nucleus of cells, respectively, and that Hsp105beta, but not 
Hsp105alpha, induces the expression of Hsp70 in mammalian cells. Here, we 
examined the mechanism by which Hsp105beta induces the expression of Hsp70. 
Using a series of deletion mutants of Hsp105beta, it was revealed that the 
region between amino acids 642 and 662 of Hsp105beta is necessary for the 
activation of the hsp70 promoter by Hsp105beta. Furthermore, it was shown that 
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 bound to the sequence 
of the hsp70 promoter between -206 and -187 bp, and that mutations of this 
sequence abrogated the activation of the hsp70 promoter by Hsp105beta. In 
addition, overexpression of Hsp105beta stimulated the phosphorylation of STAT3 
at Tyr705 and its translocation to the nucleus. Downregulation of STAT3 
expression resulted in reduction of the activation of the hsp70 promoter by 
Hsp105beta. Furthermore, downregulation of Hsp105beta reduced the expression of 
Hsp70 in heat-shocked cells. On the basis of these findings, it is suggested 
that Hsp105beta induces Hsp70 expression markedly through the STAT3 pathway in 
heat-shocked cells. This may represent the mechanism that connects the heat 
shock protein and STAT families for cell defense against deleterious stress.
