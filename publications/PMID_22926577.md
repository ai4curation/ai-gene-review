The substantia nigra plays important roles in the brain function and is critical 
in the development of many diseases, particularly Parkinson's disease. 
Pathological changes of the substantia nigra have also been reported in other 
neurodegenerative diseases. Using a quantitative proteomic approach, we 
investigated protein expressions in the substantia nigra of Alzheimer's disease, 
Huntington's disease, and Multiple sclerosis. The expression level of one 
hundred and four proteins that were identified in at least three samples of each 
group were compared with the control group, with nineteen, twenty-two and 
thirteen proteins differentially expressed in Alzheimer's diseases, Huntington's 
disease and Multiple sclerosis respectively. The result indicates that the 
substantia nigra also undergoes functional adaption or damage in these diseases.
