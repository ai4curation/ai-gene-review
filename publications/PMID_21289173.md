Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative 
disorder in which the aggregation and deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in 
the brain are central to its pathogenesis. In healthy brains, Aβ is effectively 
metabolized with little accumulation. Cellular uptake and subsequent degradation 
of Aβ is one of the major pathways for its clearance in the brain. Increasing 
evidence has demonstrated significant roles for the low-density lipoprotein 
receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in the metabolism of Aβ in neurons, glia 
cells, and along the brain vasculatures. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) has 
also been implicated in several pathogenic features of AD, including its 
colocalization with amyloid plaques. Here, we demonstrate that HSPG and LRP1 
cooperatively mediate cellular Aβ uptake. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter and 
confocal microscopy revealed that knockdown of LRP1 suppresses Aβ uptake, 
whereas overexpression of LRP1 enhances this process in neuronal cells. Heparin, 
which antagonizes HSPG, significantly inhibited cellular Aβ uptake. Importantly, 
treatment with heparin or heparinase blocked LRP1-mediated cellular uptake of 
Aβ. We further showed that HSPG is more important for the binding of Aβ to the 
cell surface than LRP1. The critical roles of HSPG in cellular Aβ binding and 
uptake were confirmed in Chinese hamster ovary cells genetically deficient in 
HSPG. We also showed that heparin and a neutralizing antibody to LRP1 suppressed 
Aβ uptake in primary neurons. Our findings demonstrate that LRP1 and HSPG 
function in a cooperative manner to mediate cellular Aβ uptake and define a 
major pathway through which Aβ gains entry to neuronal cells.

Introduction

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles as its pathological hallmarks ( Selkoe, 2001 , 2002 ). Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that accumulation, aggregation, and deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in the brain are critical steps in its pathogenesis ( Selkoe, 2001 ; Shankar and Walsh, 2009 ). Aβ peptide is cleaved from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and secreted into the extracellular space ( Bredesen, 2009 ). It is effectively cleared in healthy brains ( Bu, 2009 ). In vivo microdialysis analysis demonstrated that Aβ in brain interstitial fluid of young mice is cleared within a relatively short half-life (∼2 h) ( Cirrito et al., 2003 ). There are several pathways through which Aβ is cleared from the brain. These include cellular uptake and degradation, clearance along the interstitial fluid drainage pathway, through the blood–brain barrier, and through proteolytic degradation by Aβ-degrading enzymes ( Bu, 2009 ). Members of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family are expressed in different cell types in these pathways and play important roles in Aβ clearance. In particular, the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is shown to mediate the metabolism of Aβ in neurons ( Qiu et al., 1999 ), glia cells ( Wyss-Coray et al., 2003 ), and brain vessels ( Urmoneit et al., 1997 ; Kanekiyo and Bu, 2009 ). LRP1 is a large endocytic receptor that recognizes an array of ligands, including APP, apolipoprotein E (apoE), α2-macroglobulin, and receptor-associated protein (RAP), which are involved in Aβ production and clearance ( Herz and Strickland, 2001 ; Bu et al., 2006 ; Kanekiyo and Bu, 2009 ). Among these LRP1 ligands, an isoform of apoE (apoE4) is a strong genetic risk factor for AD ( Bu, 2009 ).

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are abundant cell surface receptors that interact with a variety of ligands through electrostatic interactions ( Poon and Gariépy, 2007 ). Several HSPGs colocalize with senile plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy ( van Horssen et al., 2003 ). HSPGs found on the surface of almost all mammalian cells are members of the glycosaminoglycan family of polysaccharides and are involved in a large number of biological processes, including development, embryogenesis, cell growth and division, homeostasis, and coagulation ( Turnbull et al., 2001 ). Heparan sulfate (HS) binds to Aβ ( Brunden et al., 1993 ) and heparin attenuates neurotoxicity and inflammatory activity of Aβ, suggesting a potentially important role for HSPG in cellular metabolism of Aβ ( Bergamaschini et al., 2002 ). In addition, LRP1 and HSPG are part of an immunoprecipitable complex at the cell surface to mediate lipid metabolism ( Wilsie and Orlando, 2003 ). Internalization of apoE/lipoprotein particles is partially dependent on the HSPG and LRP1 complex ( Mahley and Ji, 1999 ), suggesting a cooperative function for these apoE receptors at the cell surface.

Although Aβ clearance by its degrading enzymes has been studied extensively, less is known about receptor-mediated endocytic pathways for cellular Aβ uptake. In this study, we focused on both individual and potentially cooperative roles of LRP1 and HSPG in cellular Aβ uptake. We demonstrated that LRP1 and HSPG play critical, cooperative roles in neuronal Aβ uptake.

Discussion

Intracellular or extracellular accumulation, aggregation, and deposition of Aβ in the brain are pathogenic events of AD ( Selkoe, 2001 , 2002 ). One of the major pathways for Aβ clearance is its cellular uptake and degradation by neurons, glia, and cells along the brain vasculature ( Bu, 2009 ). In this study, we focused on investigating individual and cooperative roles of LRP1 and HSPG in neuronal Aβ uptake. Using complementary approaches, we showed that neuronal cell-surface HSPGs constitute major Aβ binding sites and are critical for Aβ uptake. Although not required for Aβ binding, LRP1 cooperates with HSPG in neuronal Aβ uptake.

HSPG is composed of a core protein with long polysaccharide chains of repeated heparan sulfate. There are two groups of HSPGs: extracellular matrix HSPGs (e.g., perlecan, agrin, and collagen XVIII) and cell-surface HSPGs (syndecan and glypican) ( van Horssen et al., 2003 ). Both extracellular matrix and cell-surface HSPGs were detected by immunohistochemistry in senile plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and neurofibrillary tangles ( van Horssen et al., 2003 ). These evidences strongly suggest that HSPGs may interact with Aβ and play some roles in AD pathogenesis. Consistent with this notion, we demonstrated that heparin binds to Aβ (supplemental Fig. 5 A , available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) and significantly inhibits neuronal Aβ binding and uptake. Heparin binds to several classes of extracellular proteins, including growth factors, matrix proteins, and apolipoproteins ( Bergamaschini et al., 2009 ). Heparan sulfate was shown to bind to the amino acid 13–16 region (HHQK) of Aβ ( Brunden et al., 1993 ) and to antagonize the binding of Aβ to HSPG in vitro ( Castillo et al., 1997 ). To block heparin binding proteins and/or displace HSPG binding proteins at the cell surface, GT1-7 cells were pretreated with heparin and then incubated with Aβ 42 after washing. No significant effect of heparin pretreatment on Aβ 42 uptake was detected (supplemental Fig. 5 B , available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), suggesting that heparin antagonizes the interaction of Aβ to HSPG through its binding to Aβ. In addition, HSPG deficiency in CHO cells significantly decreased Aβ binding and uptake. Therefore, our findings indicate that Aβ binding to neuronal cell-surface HSPG may be the first and critical step for its internalization, degradation, accumulation, and/or toxicity. Aβ binding to cell-surface and/or extracellular matrix HSPG may also be important for its aggregation and eventual formation of amyloid plaques.

We showed that heparin suppresses Aβ binding and internalization in neuronal cell lines and mouse primary neurons. Similar findings have been demonstrated in brain vascular smooth muscle cell ( Kanekiyo and Bu, 2009 ) and in microglia ( Giulian et al., 1998 ). However, heparin and heparinase treatment did not affect Aβ uptake in brain capillary endothelial cells ( Yamada et al., 2008 ). Because heparan sulfate biosynthesis differs depending on tissue/cell types ( Kreuger et al., 2006 ), the discrepancies in cellular Aβ uptake may result from differences in tissue/cell-specific HSPG structure. Several studies have demonstrated that heparin and heparan sulfate suppress Aβ cellular toxicity ( Woods et al., 1995 ; Bergamaschini et al., 2002 ), likely by inhibiting cellular Aβ binding and/or uptake. Cells internalize and degrade Aβ through the lysosomal pathway ( Hu et al., 2009 ). We demonstrated that LRP1 and HSPG mediate uptake of Aβ to lysosomes and its subsequent cellular clearance in N2a cells. However, when the capacity is overwhelmed through continuous exposure to high concentrations of extracellular Aβ, intracellular accumulation and aggregation of Aβ may be induced, leading to cellular toxicity. We recently showed that enhancement of Aβ uptake through LRP1 leads to eventual lysosomal accumulation and slightly decreased cell viability when cells were exposed to high Aβ concentrations and long periods of incubation ( Fuentealba et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, the remnants of these aggregates after cell death may induce extracellular amyloid plaque formation through its seeding effect ( Hu et al., 2009 ). In this view, heparin and heparin-like compounds may be promising candidates for AD therapy because of their competitive function against HSPGs. Bergamaschini et al. (2004) demonstrated that the effect of long-term, peripheral treatment with a low-molecular-weight heparin significantly decreased Aβ concentration and deposition in the brain of APP transgenic mice ( Bergamaschini et al., 2004 ).

LRP1 plays critical roles in cellular Aβ uptake in the brain. Harris-White et al. (2004) showed that TGFβ2-mediated intraneuronal accumulation of brain-injected Aβ depends on LRP1 function ( Harris-White et al., 2004 ). We showed that the internalization of Aβ was also decreased in LRP1-deficient neuronal cells and increased in LRP1-overexpressing neuronal cells. LRP1 expression restored Aβ uptake in LRP1 knocked down GT1-7 cells. We also demonstrated that treatment with a neutralizing antibody to LRP1 decreased Aβ uptake in mouse primary cortical neuron. In addition, LRP1 enhanced the Aβ endocytosis rate in N2a cells. Importantly, LRP1-mediated Aβ uptake was also inhibited by heparin, indicating that the function of LRP1 in cellular Aβ uptake depends on HSPG. In contrast to HSPG, we showed that neither LRP1 knockdown nor overexpression affects Aβ binding. These results can be explained by two possibilities. First, HSPG may function as a coreceptor for LRP1. Previous work has shown that LRP1 forms a complex with HSPG ( Wilsie and Orlando, 2003 ). Aβ may initially bind to the HSPG sites on the surface of the complex and then may undergo endocytosis via LRP1, in a process analogous to another LRP1 ligand, coagulation factor VIII ( Sarafanov et al., 2001 ). We have shown that inhibition of LRP1 endocytosis decreases cellular Aβ uptake in N2a cells ( Fuentealba et al., 2010 ). LRP1 is a large endocytotic receptor that recognizes >30 ligands, including lipoproteins, proteinases, proteinase inhibitor complexes, extracellular matrix proteins, bacterial toxins, viruses, and various intracellular proteins ( Herz and Strickland, 2001 ; Bu, 2009 ). Although the ligand-binding sites on LRP1 localize primarily on domains II and IV ( Herz and Strickland, 2001 ), some LRP1 ligands seem to require coreceptors for their interaction ( Nykjaer et al., 1992 ; Sarafanov et al., 2001 ). Aβ was shown to bind directly to domains II and IV of LRP1 ( Sagare et al., 2007 ); however, another study did not support direct Aβ binding to LRP1 ( Yamada et al., 2008 ). Our results suggest that HSPG may be one of the candidate coreceptors of LRP1 for Aβ binding and uptake.

We showed that Aβ had a slower rate of endocytosis than RAP in N2a–mLRP4 cells, indicating that LRP1 mediates Aβ endocytosis through different mechanisms from its other ligands. Therefore, the other possibility is that HSPG, which is abundantly expressed in neurons, may capture Aβ on the cell surface and subsequently internalize Aβ through an LRP1-regulated signaling pathway. Increasing evidence also shows that LRP1 functions as a signal-transducing receptor ( Herz and Strickland, 2001 ) and that LRP1 plays a critical role in neuronal viability by regulating key survival signaling pathways ( Fuentealba et al., 2009 ). In addition, LRP1 regulates cell migration ( Song et al., 2009 ) and the integrity of the blood–brain barrier ( Yepes et al., 2003 ). Aβ binding to HSPG may activate LRP1 signaling pathways, resulting in an enhancement of cellular Aβ uptake. Consistent with an LRP1-mediated signaling function, actin polymerization, which is critical for macropinocytosis and Aβ uptake ( Mandrekar et al., 2009 ), is impaired in LRP1-deficient cells ( Zhou et al., 2009 ). This evidence suggests that LRP1 may mediate Aβ cellular uptake by regulating macropinocytosis.

In summary, we have demonstrated that HSPG and LRP1 function cooperatively in neuronal Aβ binding and uptake. We show that HSPG mediates Aβ binding on the cell surface and that both HSPG and LRP1 play important roles in Aβ uptake. Our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of AD pathogenesis. Additional studies of the HSPG/LRP1-mediated Aβ pathways may lead to novel therapeutic strategies to treat AD.
