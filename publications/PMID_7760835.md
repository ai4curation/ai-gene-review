Recent reports have demonstrated the in vivo association of Raf-1 with members 
of the 14-3-3 protein family. To address the significance of the Raf-1-14-3-3 
interaction, we investigated the enzymatic activity and biological function of 
Raf-1 in the presence and absence of associated 14-3-3. The interaction between 
these two molecules was disrupted in vivo and in vitro with a combination of 
molecular and biochemical techniques. Biochemical studies demonstrated that the 
enzymatic activities of Raf-1 were equivalent in the presence and absence of 
14-3-3. Furthermore, mixing of purified Raf-1 and 14-3-3 in vitro was not 
sufficient to activate Raf-1. With a molecular approach, Cys-165 and Cys-168 as 
well as Ser-259 were identified as residues of Raf-1 required for the 
interaction with 14-3-3. Cys-165 and Cys-168 are located within the conserved 
cysteine-rich region of the CR1 domain, and Ser-259 is a conserved site of 
serine phosphorylation found within the CR2 domain. Mutation of either Cys-165 
and Cys-168 or Ser-259 prevented the stable interaction of Raf-1 with 14-3-3 in 
vivo. Consistent with the model in which a site of serine phosphorylation is 
involved in the Raf-1-14-3-3 interaction, dephosphorylated Raf-1 was unable to 
associate with 14-3-3 in vitro. Phosphorylation may represent a general 
mechanism mediating 14-3-3 binding, because dephosphorylation of the Bcr kinase 
(known to interact with 14-3-3) also eliminated its association with 14-3-3. 
Finally, mutant Raf-1 proteins unable to stably interact with 14-3-3 exhibited 
enhanced enzymatic activity in human 293 cells and Xenopus oocytes and were 
biologically activated, as demonstrated by their ability to induced meiotic 
maturation of Xenopus oocytes. However, in contrast to wild-type Raf-1, 
activation of these mutants was independent of Ras. Our results therefore 
indicate that interaction with 14-3-3 is not essential for Raf-1 function.
