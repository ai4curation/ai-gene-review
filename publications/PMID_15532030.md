The Brn-3a transcription factor is critical for survival and differentiation of 
sensory neurons derived from neural crest cells (NCC). Interaction of Brn-3a 
with p53 results in differential effects on target gene expression, which 
profoundly affects fate of neuronal cells. Here we demonstrate colocalization of 
p53 in a subset of Brn-3a-positive NCC-derived cells fated for the sensory 
neuronal lineage. The distinct morphology of Brn-3a/p53-coexpressing cells 
suggested a differentiated neuronal cell type, and this was confirmed by 
colocalization of p53 with differentiation marker NF-160. Functional effects of 
Brn-3a/p53 coexpression were analyzed in NCC cultured from Brn-3a -/- embryos, 
which showed significantly increased apoptosis upon induction of p53 compared 
with wild-type NCC, suggesting that Brn-3a modulates the p53-mediated fate of 
NCC that coexpress both factors. Thus, p53 is expressed in neuronal cells 
undergoing differentiation as well as apoptosis. Interaction with Brn-3a in 
sensory neurons may be critical for modulating p53-mediated gene expression and 
hence cell fate.
