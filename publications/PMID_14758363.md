The hyh (hydrocephalus with hop gait) mouse shows a markedly small cerebral 
cortex at birth and dies postnatally from progressive enlargement of the 
ventricular system. Here we show that the small hyh cortex reflects altered cell 
fate. Neural progenitor cells withdraw prematurely from the cell cycle, 
producing more early-born, deep-layer cerebral cortical neurons but depleting 
the cortical progenitor pool, such that late-born, upper-layer cortical neurons 
are underproduced, creating a small cortex. hyh mice carry a hypomorphic 
missense mutation in the gene Napa encoding soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive 
factor (NSF) attachment protein alpha (alpha Snap), involved in SNAP receptor 
(SNARE)-mediated vesicle fusion in many cellular contexts. A targeted null Napa 
mutation is embryonically lethal. Altered neural cell fate is accompanied by 
abnormal localization of many apical proteins implicated in regulation of neural 
cell fate, including E-cadherin, beta-catenin, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) 
and INADL (inactivation-no-afterpotential D-like, also known as protein 
associated with Lin7, or Pals1). Apical localization of the SNARE Vamp7 is also 
disrupted. Thus, alpha Snap is essential for apical protein localization and 
cell fate determination in neuroepithelial cells.
