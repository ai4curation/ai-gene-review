Stimulation of death receptors activates the extrinsic apoptotic signaling 
pathway that leads to cell death. Although many steps of this apoptotic 
signaling cascade are known, few mechanisms that counterbalance the death signal 
have been described. We identified an antiapoptotic protein complex associated 
with death receptors that contains glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), DDX3 and 
cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP-1). GSK3, DDX3 and cIAP-1 are 
associated in cells with each other and with death receptors. Blocking the 
actions of GSK3 or DDX3 potentiated caspase-3 activation induced by stimulation 
of four different death receptors in several types of cells. GSK3 restrained 
apoptotic signaling by inhibiting formation of the death-inducing signaling 
complex and caspase-8 activation. Stimulated death receptors surmount the 
antiapoptotic complex by causing GSK3 inactivation and cleavage of DDX3 and 
cIAP-1 to enable progression of the apoptotic signaling cascade, but the 
antiapoptotic complex remains functional in cancer cells resistant to death 
receptor stimulation, a resistance that is overcome by GSK3 inhibitors. Thus, an 
antiapoptotic complex of GSK3, DDX3 and cIAP-1 caps death receptors, providing a 
checkpoint to counterbalance apoptotic signaling.
