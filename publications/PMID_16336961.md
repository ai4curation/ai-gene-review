FLRG and follistatin belong to the family of follistatin proteins involved in 
the regulation of various biological effects, such as hematopoiesis, mediated by 
their binding to activin and BMP, both members of the TGFbeta family. To further 
characterize the function of FLRG, we searched for other possible functional 
partners using a yeast two-hybrid screen. We identified human fibronectin as a 
new partner for both FLRG and follistatin. We also demonstrated that their 
physical interaction is mediated by type I motifs of fibronectin and follistatin 
domains. We then analyzed the biological consequences of these protein 
interactions on the regulation of hematopoiesis. For the first time, we 
associated a biological effect with the regulation of human hematopoietic cell 
adhesiveness of both the type I motifs of fibronectin and the follistatin 
domains of FLRG and follistatin. Indeed, we observed a significant and specific 
dose-dependent increase of cell adhesion to fibronectin in the presence of FLRG 
or follistatin, using either a human hematopoietic cell line or primary cells. 
In particular, we observed a significantly increased adhesion of immature 
hematopoietic precursors (CFC, LTC-IC). Altogether these results highlight a new 
mechanism by which FLRG and follistatin regulate human hematopoiesis.
