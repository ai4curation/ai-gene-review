Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) involves the formation of a 
closed, double membrane structure, called the autophagosome. Most of the Atg 
proteins that are essential for autophagosome formation are evolutionarily 
conserved between yeast and higher eukaryotes. The functions of some Atg 
proteins, however, are mediated by highly divergent proteins in mammalian cells. 
In this study, we identified a novel coiled-coil domain protein, EPG-8, that 
plays an essential role in the autophagy pathway in C. elegans. Mutations in 
epg-8 cause defects in degradation of various autophagy substrates and also 
compromise survival of animals under nutrient-depletion conditions. In epg-8 
mutants, lipidated LGG-1 (the C. elegans Atg8 homolog) accumulates but does not 
form distinct punctate structures. EPG-8 directly interacts with the C. elegans 
Beclin 1 homolog, BEC-1. Our study demonstrates that epg-8 may function as a 
highly divergent homolog of the yeast autophagy gene Atg14.
