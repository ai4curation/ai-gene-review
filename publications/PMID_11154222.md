The serglycin proteoglycan is best known as a hematopoietic cell granule 
proteoglycan. It has been found that serglycin is synthesized by endothelial 
cells, is localized to cytoplasmic vesicles, and is constitutively secreted. 
Serglycin messenger RNA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and 
cultured human aortic endothelial cells was detected by reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. (35)S-sulfate-labeled secreted and 
intracellular proteoglycans were analyzed. It was found that 85% of the 
proteoglycans synthesized during culture were secreted. A core protein of the 
appropriate size for serglycin was detected by analysis of the 
chondroitinase-digested (35)S-sulfate-labeled HUVEC proteoglycans. This was the 
major core protein of the secreted chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. 
Recombinant serglycin core protein was used to generate an antibody in chickens. 
A core protein identified by Western blotting of chondroitinase digests of HUVEC 
proteoglycans corresponded to the major (35)S-sulfate- labeled core protein. 
Identical results were obtained with 2 hematopoietic cell lines. 
Cyto-immunofluorescence showed cytoplasmic vesicular and perinuclear labeling in 
hematopoietic cells and HUVECs. The serglycin-containing vesicles in HUVECs are 
distinct from the Weibel-Palade bodies, which contain von Willebrand factor. 
Confocal microscopy showed that tissue plasminogen activator was distributed 
similarly to serglycin. Serglycin may be important for the function of these 
vesicles and, once secreted, for the modulation of the activity of their 
constituents.
