The p53 tumor suppressor protein regulates many genes that can determine 
different cellular outcomes such as growth arrest or cell death. 
Promoter-selective transactivation by p53, although critical for the different 
cellular outcomes, is not well understood. We report here that the human 
cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein (hCAS/CSE1L) associates with a subset 
of p53 target promoters, including PIG3, in a p53-autonomous manner. 
Downregulation of hCAS/CSE1L decreases transcription from those p53 target 
promoters to which it preferentially binds and reduces apoptosis. In addition, 
hCAS/CSE1L silencing leads to increased methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 
within the PIG3 gene. hCAS/CSE1L was previously shown to function as a 
nucleo-cytoplasmic transport factor, as does its closely related yeast homologue 
Cse1, which can also associate with chromatin and serve as a barrier protein 
that prevents spreading of heterochromatin. Thus, human CAS/CSE1L can bind 
select genes with significant functional consequences for p53-mediated 
transcription and determine cellular outcome.
