Cytochrome c release and the mitochondrial permeability transition (PT), 
including loss of the transmembrane potential (Deltapsi), play an important role 
in apoptosis. Using isolated mitochondria, we found that recombinant Bax and 
Bak, proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, induced mitochondrial Deltapsi 
loss, swelling, and cytochrome c release. All of these changes were dependent on 
Ca2+ and were prevented by cyclosporin A (CsA) and bongkrekic acid, both of 
which close the PT pores (megachannels), indicating that Bax- and Bak-induced 
mitochondrial changes were mediated through the opening of these pores. 
Bax-induced mitochondrial changes were inhibited by recombinant Bcl-xL and 
transgene-derived Bcl-2, antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, as well as 
by oligomycin, suggesting a possible regulatory effect of F0F1-ATPase on 
Bax-induced mitochondrial changes. Proapoptotic Bax- and Bak-BH3 (Bcl-2 
homology) peptides, but not a mutant BH3 peptide nor a mutant Bak lacking BH3, 
induced the mitochondrial changes, indicating an essential role of the BH3 
region. A coimmunoprecipitation study revealed that Bax and Bak interacted with 
the voltage-dependent anion channel, which is a component of PT pores. Taken 
together, these findings suggest that proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, 
including Bax and Bak, induce the mitochondrial PT and cytochrome c release by 
interacting with the PT pores.
