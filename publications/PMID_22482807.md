Kohlschutter-Tonz syndrome (KTS) is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder of 
childhood onset, and it is characterized by global developmental delay, 
spasticity, epilepsy, and amelogenesis imperfecta. In 12 KTS-affected 
individuals from a Druze village in northern Israel, homozygosity mapping 
localized the gene linked to the disease to a 586,513 bp region (with a LOD 
score of 6.4) in chromosomal region 16p13.3. Sequencing of genes (from genomic 
DNA of an affected individual) in the linked region revealed chr16: 4,848,632 
G>A, which corresponds to ROGDI c.469C>T (p.Arg157(∗)). The nonsense mutation 
was homozygous in all affected individuals, heterozygous in 10 of 100 unaffected 
individuals from the same Druze community, and absent from Druze controls from 
elsewhere. Wild-type ROGDI localizes to the nuclear envelope; ROGDI was not 
detectable in cells of affected individuals. All affected individuals suffered 
seizures, were unable to speak, and had amelogenesis imperfecta. However, age of 
onset and the severity of mental and motor handicaps and that of convulsions 
varied among affected individuals homozygous for the same nonsense allele.
