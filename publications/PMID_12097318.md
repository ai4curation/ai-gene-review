Yeast disruptor of telomeric silencing-1 (DOT1) is involved in gene silencing 
and in the pachytene checkpoint during meiotic cell cycle. Here we show that the 
Dot1 protein possesses intrinsic histone methyltransferase (HMT) activity. When 
compared with Rmt1, another putative yeast HMT, Dot1 shows very distinct 
substrate specificity. While Rmt1 methylates histone H4, Dot1 targets histone 
H3. In contrast to Rmt1, which can only modify free histones, Dot1 activity is 
specific to nucleosomal substrates. This was also confirmed using native 
chromatin purified from yeast cells. We also demonstrate that, like its 
mammalian homolog PRMT1, Rmt1 specifically dimethylates an arginine residue at 
position 3 of histone H4 N-terminal tail. In surprising contrast, methylation by 
Dot1 occurs in the globular domain of nucleosomal histone H3. Matrix-assisted 
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis suggests that H3 
lysine 79 is trimethylated by Dot1. The intrinsic nucleosomal histone H3 
methyltransferase activity of Dot1 is certainly a key aspect of its function in 
gene silencing at telomeres, most likely by directly modulating chromatin 
structure and Sir protein localization. In agreement with a role in regulating 
localization of histone deacetylase complexes like SIR, an increase of bulk 
histone acetylation is detected in dot1- cells.
