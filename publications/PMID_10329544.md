Several studies have implicated hepatitis C virus (HCV) core in influencing the
expression of host genes. To identify cellular factors with a possible role in
HCV replication and pathogenesis, we looked for cellular proteins that interact
with the viral core protein. A human liver cDNA library was screened in a yeast
two-hybrid assay to identify cellular proteins that bind to core. Several
positive clones were isolated, one of which encoded the C-terminal 253 amino
acids of a putative RNA helicase, a DEAD box protein designated DDX3.
Bacterially expressed glutathione-S-transferase-DDX3 fusion protein specifically
pulled down in vitro translated and radiolabeled HCV core, confirming a direct
interaction. Immunofluorescent staining of HeLa cells with a polyclonal
antiserum showed that DDX3 is located predominantly in nuclear speckles and at
low levels throughout the cytoplasm. In cells infected with a recombinant
vaccinia virus expressing HCV structural proteins (core, E1, and E2), DDX3 and
core colocalized in distinct spots in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm.
The regions of the proteins involved in binding were found by deletion analysis
to be the N-terminal 59 amino acid residues of core and a C-terminal RS-like
domain of DDX3. The human DDX3 is a putative RNA helicase and a member of a
highly conserved DEAD box subclass that includes murine PL10, Xenopus An3, and
yeast Ded1 proteins. Their role in RNA metabolism or gene expression is unknown.
The significance of core-helicase interaction in HCV replication and
pathogenesis is discussed.
