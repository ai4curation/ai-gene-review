Migrating cells need to make different actin assemblies at the cell's leading 
and trailing edges and to maintain physical separation of signals for these 
assemblies. This asymmetric control of activities represents one important form 
of cell polarity. There are significant gaps in our understanding of the 
components involved in generating and maintaining polarity during chemotaxis. 
Here we characterize a family of complexes (which we term leading edge 
complexes), scaffolded by hematopoietic protein 1 (Hem-1), that organize the 
neutrophil's leading edge. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family 
Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE)2 complex, which mediates activation of actin 
polymerization by Rac, is only one member of this family. A subset of these 
leading edge complexes are biochemically separable from the WAVE2 complex and 
contain a diverse set of potential polarity-regulating proteins. RNA 
interference-mediated knockdown of Hem-1-containing complexes in neutrophil-like 
cells: (a) dramatically impairs attractant-induced actin polymerization, 
polarity, and chemotaxis; (b) substantially weakens Rac activation and 
phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-tris-phosphate production, disrupting the 
(phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-tris-phosphate)/Rac/F-actin-mediated feedback 
circuit that organizes the leading edge; and (c) prevents exclusion of activated 
myosin from the leading edge, perhaps by misregulating leading edge complexes 
that contain inhibitors of the Rho-actomyosin pathway. Taken together, these 
observations show that versatile Hem-1-containing complexes coordinate diverse 
regulatory signals at the leading edge of polarized neutrophils, including but 
not confined to those involving WAVE2-dependent actin polymerization.
