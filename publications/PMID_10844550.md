There is increasing evidence implicating the human NF1 gene in epithelial 
carcinogenesis. To test if NF1 can play a part in skin tumor formation, we 
analyzed effects of the skin cancer initiator dimethylbenz-anthracene and/or the 
tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetylphorbol on mice heterozygous for null 
mutations in Nf1 (Nf1+/-). Mice were on the C57BL/6 background, noted for 
resistance to chemical carcinogens. Nf1+/- mice (18 of 24) developed papillomas 
after treatment with dimethylbenzanthracene and 
12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetylphorbol; papillomas did not develop in wild-type 
C57BL/6 mice nor Nf1+/- mice treated with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetylphorbol 
alone. All papillomas analyzed (six of six) had mutations in codon 61 of H-ras, 
demonstrating strong cooperation between the Nf1 GTPase activating protein for 
Ras, neurofibromin, and Ras-GTP. After exposure to 
12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetylphorbol, Nf1+/- keratinocytes showed significant, 
sustained, increases in proliferation, implicating Nf1 in phorbol ester 
responsive pathways. Thus, Nf1 levels regulate the response of keratinocytes to 
12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetylphorbol. Nf1+/- mice also showed a 2-fold increase 
in the development of pigmented skin patches stimulated by 
dimethylbenzanthracene; patches were characterized by hair follicles in anagen 
phase, implicating keratinocytes in the aberrant hyperpigmentation. Our results 
show that mutation in the Nf1 gene causes abnormal keratinocyte proliferation 
that can be revealed by environmental assaults such as carcinogen exposure. The 
data support a plausible role for NF1 mutation in human epithelial 
carcinogenesis.
