Mitochondrial ATP synthase (F1Fo-ATPase) is regulated by an intrinsic ATPase 
inhibitor protein. In the present study, cDNA coding the human homolog of the 
inhibitor protein was isolated and sequenced. The deduced protein sequence shows 
that the protein was composed of 106 amino acids and had a molecular weight of 
12248. The structural features of the protein show that the cDNA isolated in 
this study codes the human ATPase inhibitor.
