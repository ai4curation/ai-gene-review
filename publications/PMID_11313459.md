Chronic hypoxia induces smooth muscle cell proliferation and vessel wall 
remodeling in the vasculature of the lung. One well-characterized component of 
the hypoxic response is transcriptional activation of genes encoding vascular 
smooth muscle cell (VSMC) mitogens. We report here that chronic hypoxia can also 
prolong the growth of human VSMC by inducing telomerase activity and telomere 
stabilization. We demonstrate that hypoxia induced phosphorylation of the 
telomerase catalytic component (TERT) and sustained high levels of TERT protein 
expression in VSMC compared to normoxia. Furthermore, inhibition of telomerase 
shortened cell life span in hypoxic cultures, whereas constitutive expression of 
TERT extended the life span of cells under normoxic conditions. Our data 
indicate that hypoxic induction of telomerase activity could be involved in 
long-term growth of VSMC and may thus contribute to human vascular disorders.
