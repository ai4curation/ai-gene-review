Human LANCL2, also known as Testis-specific Adriamycin Sensitivity Protein 
(TASP), is a member of the highly conserved and widely distributed lanthionine 
synthetase component C-like (LANCL) protein family. Expression studies of tagged 
LANCL2 revealed the major localization to the plasma membrane, juxta-nuclear 
vesicles, and the nucleus, in contrast to the homologue LANCL1 that was mainly 
found in the cytosol and nucleus. We identified the unique N-terminus of LANCL2 
to function as the membrane anchor and characterized the relevant N-terminal 
myristoylation and a basic phosphatidylinositol phosphate-binding site. 
Interestingly, the non-myristoylated protein was confined to the nucleus 
indicating that the myristoylation targets LANCL2 to the plasma membrane. 
Cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin caused the partial 
dissociation of overexpressed LANCL2 from the plasma membrane in vitro, whereas 
in vivo we observed an enhanced cell detachment from the matrix. We found that 
overexpressed LANCL2 interacts with the cortical actin cytoskeleton and 
therefore may play a role in cytoskeleton reorganization and in consequence to 
cell detachment. Moreover, we confirmed previous data that LANCL2 overexpression 
enhances the cellular sensitivity to the anticancer drug adriamycin and found 
that this sensitivity is dependent on the myristoylation and membrane 
association of LANCL2.
