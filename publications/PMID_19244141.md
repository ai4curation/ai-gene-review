In common with a range of environmental and biological stresses, heat shock 
results in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and a collection of downstream 
consequences for cellular homeostasis and growth. Within this complex array of 
responses, the sensing of and responses to misfolded proteins in specific 
subcellular compartments involves specific chaperones, transcriptional 
regulators, and expression profiles. Using biological (ectopic protein 
expression and virus infection) and chemical triggers for misfolded protein 
accumulation, we have profiled the transcriptional features of the response to 
misfolded protein accumulation in the cytosol (i.e., the cytoplasmic protein 
response [CPR]) and identified the effects as a subcomponent of the wider 
effects induced by heat shock. The CPR in Arabidopsis thaliana is associated 
with the heat shock promoter element and the involvement of specific heat shock 
factors (HSFs), notably HSFA2, which appears to be regulated by alternative 
splicing and non-sense-mediated decay. Characterization of Arabidopsis HSFA2 
knockout and overexpression lines showed that HSFA2 is one of the regulatory 
components of the CPR.

Abstract

In common with a range of environmental and biological stresses, heat shock results in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and a collection of downstream consequences for cellular homeostasis and growth. Within this complex array of responses, the sensing of and responses to misfolded proteins in specific subcellular compartments involves specific chaperones, transcriptional regulators, and expression profiles. Using biological (ectopic protein expression and virus infection) and chemical triggers for misfolded protein accumulation, we have profiled the transcriptional features of the response to misfolded protein accumulation in the cytosol (i.e., the cytoplasmic protein response [CPR]) and identified the effects as a subcomponent of the wider effects induced by heat shock. The CPR in Arabidopsis thaliana is associated with the heat shock promoter element and the involvement of specific heat shock factors (HSFs), notably HSFA2, which appears to be regulated by alternative splicing and non-sense-mediated decay. Characterization of Arabidopsis HSFA2 knockout and overexpression lines showed that HSFA2 is one of the regulatory components of the CPR.

INTRODUCTION

Protein homeostasis is central to normal cellular function. In sessile plants, this is a major challenge since they are subjected to a plethora of diverse biotic and abiotic challenges, many of which impact upon protein stability. To deal with this, plants have evolved a complex regulatory network of transcription factors that interact with specific promoter elements to transcribe multiple families of heat shock proteins (HSPs) that, in turn, act as chaperones for protein repair or targeted degradation. These are not ubiquitous processes within the cell but are compartmentalized. Hence, the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is induced by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), recruits specific genes and pathways to regulate protein repair in that compartment ( Ron and Walter, 2007 ), and a parallel process, the cytosolic protein response (CPR), operates in the cytosol ( Aparicio et al., 2005 ). Although these processes are essential for maintaining normal cellular function under adverse conditions, how they are integrated into the wider response has been little investigated in higher eukaryotes. For example, heat shock is a pervasive stress with diverse impacts on cellular organization and function. It results in the denaturation of extant proteins, a block to further protein translation, destabilization of cellular membranes, and the activation of oxidative stresses ( Morimoto, 1998 ). It is widely held that the flux of denatured proteins acts as a trigger for many of these effects ( Craig and Gross, 1991 ), but how the various functional aspects relate to different subcellular compartments is not well understood.

The eukaryotic heat shock response involves the induction of HSPs and the action of specific subsets of their transcriptional regulators, heat shock factors (HSFs) ( Miller and Mittler, 2006 ; Swindell et al., 2007 ). The main role of HSPs in prokaryotes, plants, and animals relates to the protective repair of proteins, although the association of some HSPs with ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation ( Qian et al., 2006 ) also points to a function with respect to protein turnover. Protein homeostasis is maintained through an interaction between HSPs and HSFs, which is disturbed when HSPs are recruited by misfolded proteins. The release of HSFs allows them to trimerize to form the active transcription factor complex required for induced expression of HSPs. Transcription is activated following the binding of the HSF complex to promoter upstream elements, notably the heat shock element (HSE; a palindromic motif of nGAAn). Unlike budding yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) and fruitfly ( Drosophila melanogaster ), in which a single HSF regulates the expression of heat shock response genes (e.g., HSP70 ) following heat shock or other stresses, in plants there are multiple HSFs; for example, Arabidopsis thaliana encodes 21 HSF-like genes. These are categorized into three classes by their structures. Class A HSF proteins consist of a DNA binding domain, an oligomerization domain, nuclear localization domains, and transcriptional activation domains ( Nover et al., 2001 ). By contrast, classes B and C lack activation domains. It is thought that this proliferation of HSFs in plants is an adaptation to a sessile lifestyle coping with a dynamic environment ( Busch et al., 2005 ). In addition to the large number of HSFs, further flexibility is provided by the use of both homo- and heterotrimers in the formation of the transcription factor complex ( Nover et al., 2001 ; Bharti et al., 2004 ; Baniwal et al., 2007 ).

The UPR is triggered experimentally by treatment with the antibiotic tunicamycin that blocks N-terminal glycosylation, interfering with correct protein folding. Tunicamycin treatment results in the recruitment of BiP (ER-located homologs of HSP70) by misfolded proteins and the induction of larger suites of corrective chaperones. Processes for the proteosome-mediated degradation of terminally misfolded proteins are also activated ( Meusser et al., 2005 ). The CPR is induced by the accumulation of unstable or misfolded proteins in the cytosol and is associated with the induction of a specific subset of HSP70 genes. For example, virus infection in the cytosol in plant or animal cells triggers the induction of HSPs ( Whitham et al., 2003 ), a process that is exacerbated when the virus-encoded proteins are unstable ( Jockusch et al., 2001 ; Jockusch and Wiegand, 2003 ). The Arabidopsis genome encodes five soluble cytosolic HSP70s, HSP70 (referred to as HSP70A in this article) and HSP70B , and three constitutively expressed HSPs, HSC70-1 , HSC70-2 , and HSC70-3 . All of these genes are induced by heat shock treatment, whereas all but HSP70B are induced in the CPR ( Aparicio et al., 2005 ).

We hypothesized that it should be possible to identify specific responses to misfolded proteins within the overall heat shock response and to use this information to dissect the transcriptional features of the CPR. Using the proline analog l -azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC) to generate misfolded proteins ( Trotter et al., 2002 ) throughout the cell, we compared the transcript profiles following heat shock treatment with profiles associated with AZC (inducing the UPR and CPR) and tunicamycin treatment (UPR alone). From our analyses, we identified the HSE as being essential for the induction of the CPR and that the process was partly regulated by HSFA2 . In addition, we identified a novel alternative splicing product of HSFA2 RNA with the potential to modulate HSFA2 activity.

DISCUSSION

Eukaryotes have evolved complex defense pathways to cope with biotic and abiotic stresses, and in many cases these stress responses overlap. This is particularly true for responses involving genes for HSPs and their HSF transcriptional regulators where specific subsets of gene classes may be involved uniquely or collectively in responding to biotic and abiotic stresses ( Miller and Mittler, 2006 ; Swindell et al., 2007 ). A good example is the range of complex consequences and responses associated with temperature stress, which impacts plant cells and tissues independent of spatial organization. A primary consequence of heat stress is the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which trigger responses, notably the CPR and UPR, located within discrete subcellular compartments. The aim of this work was to identify the separate contribution of the CPR to the overall heat stress response and to identify key transcriptional features of the CPR.

To aid the dissection of the CPR, we employed the proline analog AZC. Incorporation of AZC leads to terminally misfolded proteins in both the soluble and ER compartments of the cytosol but is distinct from UPR induction by tunicamycin in that the latter fails to induce genes for the cytosolic HSP70 s or HSF s. Therefore, unlike AZC, the effect of tunicamycin is spatially restricted. Therefore, comparison of the effects of AZC and tunicamycin treatment allowed us to identify factors and processes that were attributable to the CPR alone.
