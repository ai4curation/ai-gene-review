Phenotypic analysis of the daf-11 and daf-21 mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans 
suggests that they have defects in components shared by processes analogous to 
vertebrate taste and olfaction. daf-11 and daf-21 mutations were previously 
shown to cause inappropriate response to the dauer-inducing pheromone. By 
mutational analysis and by disabling specific chemosensory sensilla with a 
laser, we show that neurons in the amphid sensilla are required for this 
pheromone response. Using behavioral assays, we find that daf-11 and daf-21 
mutants are not defective in avoidance of certain non-volatile repellents, but 
are defective in taxis to non-volatile attractants. In addition, both mutants 
are defective in taxis to volatile attractants detected primarily by the amphid 
neuron AWC, but respond normally to volatile attractants detected primarily by 
AWA. We propose that daf-11 and daf-21 mediate sensory transduction for both 
volatile and non-volatile compounds in specific amphid neurons.
