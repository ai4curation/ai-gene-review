The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize tumor removal without injuring 
critical brain structures. Achieving this goal is challenging as it can be 
difficult to distinguish tumor from nontumor tissue. While standard 
histopathology provides information that could assist tumor delineation, it 
cannot be performed iteratively during surgery as freezing, sectioning, and 
staining of the tissue require too much time. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) 
microscopy is a powerful label-free chemical imaging technology that enables 
rapid mapping of lipids and proteins within a fresh specimen. This information 
can be rendered into pathology-like images. Although this approach has been used 
to assess the density of glioma cells in murine orthotopic xenografts models and 
human brain tumors, tissue heterogeneity in clinical brain tumors has not yet 
been fully evaluated with SRS imaging. Here we profile 41 specimens resected 
from 12 patients with a range of brain tumors. By evaluating large-scale 
stimulated Raman imaging data and correlating this data with current clinical 
gold standard of histopathology for 4,422 fields of view, we capture many 
essential diagnostic hallmarks for glioma classification. Notably, in fresh 
tumor samples, we observe additional features, not seen by conventional methods, 
including extensive lipid droplets within glioma cells, collagen deposition in 
gliosarcoma, and irregularity and disruption of myelinated fibers in areas 
infiltrated by oligodendroglioma cells. The data are freely available in a 
public resource to foster diagnostic training and to permit additional 
interrogation. Our work establishes the methodology and provides a significant 
collection of reference images for label-free neurosurgical pathology. Cancer
