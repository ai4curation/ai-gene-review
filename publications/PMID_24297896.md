Entrainment of circadian rhythms in higher organisms relies on light-sensing 
proteins that communicate to cellular oscillators composed of delayed 
transcriptional feedback loops. The principal photoreceptor of the fly circadian 
clock, Drosophila cryptochrome (dCRY), contains a C-terminal tail (CTT) helix 
that binds beside a FAD cofactor and is essential for light signaling. Light 
reduces the dCRY FAD to an anionic semiquinone (ASQ) radical and increases CTT 
proteolytic susceptibility but does not lead to CTT chemical modification. 
Additional changes in proteolytic sensitivity and small-angle X-ray scattering 
define a conformational response of the protein to light that centers at the CTT 
but also involves regions remote from the flavin center. Reduction of the flavin 
is kinetically coupled to CTT rearrangement. Chemical reduction to either the 
ASQ or the fully reduced hydroquinone state produces the same conformational 
response as does light. The oscillator protein Timeless (TIM) contains a 
sequence similar to the CTT; the corresponding peptide binds dCRY in light and 
protects the flavin from oxidation. However, TIM mutants therein still undergo 
dCRY-mediated degradation. Thus, photoreduction to the ASQ releases the dCRY CTT 
and promotes binding to at least one region of TIM. Flavin reduction by either 
light or cellular reductants may be a general mechanism of CRY activation.
