In cell lines from advanced lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma, endogenous 
tensin-3 contributes to cell migration, anchorage-independent growth, and 
tumorigenesis. Although SH2 domains have not been reported previously to be 
phosphorylated, the tensin-3 SH2 domain is a physiologic substrate for Src. 
Tyrosines in the SH2 domain contribute to the biological activity of tensin-3, 
and phosphorylation of these tyrosines can regulate ligand binding. In a mouse 
breast cancer model, tensin-3 tyrosines are phosphorylated in a Src-associated 
manner in primary tumors, and experimental metastases induced by tumor-derived 
cell lines depend on endogenous tensin-3. Thus, tensin-3 is implicated as an 
oncoprotein regulated by Src and possessing an SH2 domain with a previously 
undescribed mechanism for the regulation of ligand binding.
