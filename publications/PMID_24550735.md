Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a well-known ciliopathy with mutations reported 
in 18 different genes. Most of the protein products of the BBS genes localize at 
or near the primary cilium and the centrosome. Near the centrosome, BBS proteins 
interact with centriolar satellite proteins, and the BBSome (a complex of seven 
BBS proteins) is believed to play a role in transporting ciliary membrane 
proteins. However, the precise mechanism by which BBSome ciliary trafficking 
activity is regulated is not fully understood. Here, we show that a centriolar 
satellite protein, AZI1 (also known as CEP131), interacts with the BBSome and 
regulates BBSome ciliary trafficking activity. Furthermore, we show that AZI1 
interacts with the BBSome through BBS4. AZI1 is not involved in BBSome assembly, 
but accumulation of the BBSome in cilia is enhanced upon AZI1 depletion. Under 
conditions in which the BBSome does not normally enter cilia, such as in BBS3 or 
BBS5 depleted cells, knock down of AZI1 with siRNA restores BBSome trafficking 
to cilia. Finally, we show that azi1 knockdown in zebrafish embryos results in 
typical BBS phenotypes including Kupffer's vesicle abnormalities and melanosome 
transport delay. These findings associate AZI1 with the BBS pathway. Our 
findings provide further insight into the regulation of BBSome ciliary 
trafficking and identify AZI1 as a novel BBS candidate gene.
