BACKGROUND: The Rho GTPases Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 regulate the organization of the 
actin cytoskeleton by interacting with multiple, distinct downstream effector 
proteins. Cdc42 controls the formation of actin bundle-containing filopodia at 
the cellular periphery. The molecular mechanism for this remains as yet unclear.
RESULTS: We report here that Cdc42 interacts with IRSp53/BAP2 alpha, an SH3 
domain-containing scaffold protein, at a partial CRIB motif and that an 
N-terminal fragment of IRSp53 binds, via an intramolecular interaction, to the 
CRIB motif-containing central region. Overexpression of IRSp53 in fibroblasts 
leads to the formation of filopodia, and both this and Cdc42-induced filopodia 
are inhibited by expression of the N-terminal IRSp53 fragment. Using affinity 
chromatography, we have identified Mena, an Ena/VASP family member, as 
interacting with the SH3 domain of IRSp53. Mena and IRSp53 act synergistically 
to promote filopodia formation.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that the interaction of Cdc42 with the partial CRIB 
motif of IRSp53 relieves an intramolecular, autoinhibitory interaction with the 
N terminus, allowing the recruitment of Mena to the IRSp53 SH3 domain. This 
IRSp53:Mena complex initiates actin filament assembly into filopodia.
