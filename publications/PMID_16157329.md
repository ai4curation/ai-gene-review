Latent TGF-beta binding proteins (LTBPs) mediate the targeting of latent 
TGF-beta complexes into ECM structures, which is important for TGF-beta 
activation and functions. LTBPs-1, -3 and -4 associate with and regulate the 
bioavailability of TGF-betas. We investigated whether LTBP-3 and -4 are 
associated with pericellular fibrillar structures of human lung fibroblast ECM, 
and which of their domains are important for this function. Immunoblotting 
analyses of isolated insoluble matrices as well as immunofluorescence analyses 
and confocal microscopy indicated that both LTBP-3 and -4 get assembled into the 
ECM. Interestingly, LTBP-4 was not detected until 7-10 days of culture and 
LTBP-3 until 14 days of culture. This was a major difference from the deposition 
kinetics of LTBP-1, which was detected already within 2 days of culture. 
Expression analyses by real time RT-PCR indicated that the slow appearance of 
LTBP-3 and -4 was due to the low expression levels soon after subculture. 
Recombinant N-terminal fragments of LTBP-3 and -4 bound readily to fibroblast 
ECM. The C-terminal domain of LTBP-4, but not of LTBP-3, also associated with 
the matrix structures. The levels of ECM-associated latent complexes of 
TGF-beta1 increased in parallel with the increased production and deposition of 
the LTBPs. The amount of active TGF-beta in the conditioned medium decreased 
during extended culture. Our results suggest that ECM is an important site of 
deposition also for LTBP-3 and -4 and that the temporal and spatial targeting of 
the TGF-beta complexes are associated with ECM maturation.
