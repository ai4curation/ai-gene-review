BACKGROUND: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive inflammatory process 
resulting in exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency in advanced stages. 
Cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP-3) has been identified as a 
defense-associated molecule with predominant expression in the salivary gland, 
pancreas and prostate.
AIMS: In this study, we investigated CRISP-3 expression in normal pancreatic 
tissues, chronic pancreatitis tissues, pancreatic cancer tissues and pancreatic 
cancer cell lines, as well as in other gastrointestinal organs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 normal pancreatic tissues, 14 chronic pancreatitis 
tissues and 14 pancreatic cancer tissues as well as three pancreatic cancer cell 
lines were analyzed. Moreover, hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal, stomach 
and colon cancers were also analyzed together with the corresponding normal 
controls.
RESULTS: CRISP-3 was expressed at moderate to high levels in chronic 
pancreatitis tissues and at moderate levels in pancreatic cancer tissues but at 
low levels in normal pancreatic tissues, and was absent in three pancreatic 
cancer cell lines. CRISP-3 expression was below the level of detection in all 
cancerous gastrointestinal tissues and in all normal tissues except 2 of 16 
colon tissue samples. CRISP-3 mRNA signals and immunoreactivity were strongly 
present in the cytoplasm of degenerating acinar cells and in small proliferating 
ductal cells in CP tissues and CP-like lesions in pancreatic cancer tissues. In 
contrast, CRISP-3 expression was weak to absent in the cytoplasm of cancer cells 
as well as in acinar cells and ductal cells in pancreatic cancer tissues and 
normal pancreatic tissues.
CONCLUSION: These results reveal that the distribution of CRISP-3 in 
gastrointestinal tissues is predominantly in the pancreas. High levels of 
CRISP-3 in acinar cells dedifferentiating into small proliferating ductal cells 
in CP and CP-like lesions in pancreatic cancer suggests a role of this molecule 
in the pathophysiology of CP.
