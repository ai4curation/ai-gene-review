MyD118 and Gadd45 are related genes encoding for proteins that play important 
roles in negative growth control, including growth suppression and apoptosis. 
MyD118 and Gadd45 are related proteins that previously were shown to interact 
with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), implicated in DNA replication, 
DNA repair, and cell cycle progression. To establish the role of MyD118 and 
Gadd45 interactions with PCNA, in this work we sought to identify the 
interacting domains and analyze the significance of this interaction in negative 
growth control. Using complementary in vivo and in vitro interaction assays the 
N-terminal (1-46) and middle (100-127) regions of PCNA were identified as 
harboring MyD118- and Gadd45 interacting domains, whereas PCNA interacting 
domains within MyD118 and Gadd45 were localized to the C termini of these 
proteins (amino acids 114-156 and 137-165, respectively). These findings provide 
first evidence that similar domains within MyD118 and Gadd45 mediate 
interactions with PCNA. Importantly, ectopic expression of MyD118 or Gadd45 
N-terminal peptides, lacking the PCNA interacting domain, was found to suppress 
colony formation or induce apoptosis more efficiently than the full-length 
proteins. These findings suggest that interaction of MyD118 or Gadd45 with PCNA, 
in essence, serves to impede negative growth control.
