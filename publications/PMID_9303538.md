The SKN-1 transcription factor specifies early embryonic cell fates in 
Caenorhabditis elegans. SKN-1 binds DNA at high affinity as a monomer, by means 
of a basic region like those of basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins, which bind 
DNA only as dimers. We have investigated how the SKN-1 DNA-binding domain (the 
Skn domain) promotes stable binding of a basic region monomer to DNA. A flexible 
arm at the Skn domain amino terminus binds in the minor groove, but a support 
segment adjacent to the carboxy-terminal basic region can independently 
stabilize basic region-DNA binding. Off DNA, the basic region and arm are 
unfolded and, surprisingly, the support segment forms a molten globule of four 
alpha-helices. On binding DNA, the Skn domain adopts a tertiary structure in 
which the basic region helix extends directly from a support segment 
alpha-helix, which is required for binding. The remainder of the support segment 
anchors this uninterrupted helix on DNA, but leaves the basic region exposed in 
the major groove. This is similar to how the bZIP basic region extends from the 
leucine zipper, indicating that positioning and cooperative stability provided 
by helix extension are conserved mechanisms that promote binding of basic 
regions to DNA.
