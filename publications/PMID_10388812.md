The Sin3-Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex, conserved between human and yeast, 
represses transcription when targeted by promoter-specific transcription 
factors. SIN3 and RPD3 also affect transcriptional silencing at the HM mating 
loci and at telomeres in yeast. Interestingly, however, deletion of the SIN3 and 
RPD3 genes enhances silencing, implying that the Sin3-Rpd3 complex functions to 
counteract, rather than to establish or maintain, silencing. Here we demonstrate 
that Sin3, Rpd3, and Sap30, a novel component of the Sin3-Rpd3 complex, affect 
silencing not only at the HMR and telomeric loci, but also at the rDNA locus. 
The effects on silencing at all three loci are dependent upon the histone 
deacetylase activity of Rpd3. Enhanced silencing associated with sin3Delta, 
rpd3Delta, and sap30Delta is differentially dependent upon Sir2 and Sir4 at the 
telomeric and rDNA loci and is also dependent upon the ubiquitin-conjugating 
enzyme Rad6 (Ubc2). We also show that the Cac3 subunit of the CAF-I chromatin 
assembly factor and Sin3-Rpd3 exert antagonistic effects on silencing. 
Strikingly, deletion of GCN5, which encodes a histone acetyltransferase, 
enhances silencing in a manner similar to deletion of RPD3. A model that 
integrates the effects of rpd3Delta, gcn5Delta, and cac3Delta on silencing is 
proposed.
