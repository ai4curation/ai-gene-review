The broad family of LEA proteins are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) 
with several potential roles in desiccation tolerance, or anhydrobiosis, one of 
which is to limit desiccation-induced aggregation of cellular proteins. We show 
here that this activity, termed molecular shield function, is distinct from that 
of a classical molecular chaperone, such as HSP70 - while HSP70 reduces 
aggregation of citrate synthase (CS) on heating, two LEA proteins, a nematode 
group 3 protein, AavLEA1, and a plant group 1 protein, Em, do not; conversely, 
the LEA proteins reduce CS aggregation on desiccation, while HSP70 lacks this 
ability. There are also differences in interaction with client proteins - HSP70 
can be co-immunoprecipitated with a polyglutamine-containing client, consistent 
with tight complex formation, whereas the LEA proteins can not, although a loose 
interaction is observed by Förster resonance energy transfer. In a further 
exploration of molecular shield function, we demonstrate that synthetic 
polysaccharides, like LEA proteins, are able to reduce desiccation-induced 
aggregation of a water-soluble proteome, consistent with a steric interference 
model of anti-aggregation activity. If molecular shields operate by reducing 
intermolecular cohesion rates, they should not protect against intramolecular 
protein damage. This was tested using the monomeric red fluorescent protein, 
mCherry, which does not undergo aggregation on drying, but the absorbance and 
emission spectra of its intrinsic fluorophore are dramatically reduced, 
indicative of intramolecular conformational changes. As expected, these changes 
are not prevented by AavLEA1, except for a slight protection at high molar 
ratios, and an AavLEA1-mCherry fusion protein is damaged to the same extent as 
mCherry alone. A recent hypothesis proposed that proteomes from 
desiccation-tolerant species contain a higher degree of disorder than intolerant 
examples, and that this might provide greater intrinsic stability, but a 
bioinformatics survey does not support this, since there are no significant 
differences in the degree of disorder between desiccation tolerant and 
intolerant species. It seems clear therefore that molecular shield function is 
largely an intermolecular activity implemented by specialist IDPs, distinct from 
molecular chaperones, but with a role in proteostasis.

Introduction

Extreme water loss through evaporation imposes severe challenges on biological systems: cell membranes lose integrity or undergo fusion; potentially damaging reactive oxygen species are generated; and protein structure is compromised due to the diminution of the hydrophobic effect at reduced water activity. Despite this, many organisms are able to survive drying, during which they enter a state of suspended animation known as anhydrobiosis. 1 – 4 These organisms are widespread throughout nature and include yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae , 5 , 6 resurrection plants like Craterostigma plantagineum , 7 , 8 and certain invertebrates, exemplified by the nematode Aphelenchus avenae . 9

Since desiccation is highly damaging to non-anhydrobiotic cells and organisms, those that are tolerant of this stress must have mechanisms for minimising injury. In principle, two different strategies might be adopted: either global differences in the genomes and proteomes of desiccation tolerant organisms evolve, such that all the molecular components of anhydrobiotes are individually resistant to water loss; or protection and repair systems exist in anhydrobiotes that prevent permanent damage to other molecules in the cell. A “belt and braces” combination of both approaches is also possible. The former strategy is seen in some extremophiles whose proteins are demonstrably different to mesophile homologues, allowing them to function in extreme environments. 10 , 11 The latter strategy is typified by the mesophilic stress response to heat shock, for example, where molecular chaperones are upregulated to deal with protein denaturation and aggregation. 12 , 13

Whole proteome remodelling seems unlikely as a general strategy for anhydrobiosis, however. In plants, desiccation tolerance has been lost and has re-emerged in single lineages; 14 there is surely insufficient time, even over millions of years, for natural selection to modify a complete proteome in this way. Furthermore, the water soluble proteome of the anhydrobiotic nematode, A. avenae , is no less prone to desiccation-induced aggregation than that of human, 15 suggesting there are no major differences in resistance to desiccation damage at the level of individual proteins. Nevertheless, some researchers 16 have hypothesised that the degree of low complexity, which was assumed to correlate with disorder in prokaryotic proteomes, is linked with resistance to desiccation. In contrast, most work on anhydrobiosis has assumed that a discrete set of molecular adaptations are responsible, and that these act to minimise damage to molecular and cellular architecture. Among these adaptations, recent emphasis has been on intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), chiefly the LEA proteins, which are thought to have various roles in protein homeostasis, membrane stabilisation and bioglass formation, among others, during anhydrobiosis. 17 – 20

LEA proteins are generally small (10–30 kDa), highly hydrophilic IDPs that, on the basis of protein sequence motifs and peptide composition, fall into three main groups. 20 , 21 Evidence is accumulating that LEA proteins and other hydrophilic proteins have a protein stabilisation function since they preserve enzyme activity in vitro after desiccation or freezing. 22 – 28 One mechanism for the protection observed is the prevention of water stress-induced aggregation of sensitive proteins. 15 , 23 , 28 , 29 This anti-aggregation activity extends in vivo to spontaneously aggregating polyglutamine-containing (polyQ) and polyalanine-containing proteins. 15 , 30 Although superficially this anti-aggregation function resembles that of classical molecular chaperones, several fundamental differences are apparent such that we have termed the former molecular shield activity. 21 , 23 For example, molecular chaperones are largely well-structured proteins, unlike the LEA proteins, and in many cases they function through interaction with exposed hydrophobic regions on (partially) unfolded client proteins. 12 , 31 Such interactions are sufficiently robust that co-immunoprecipitation experiments can be performed to recover chaperone-client complexes from cell extracts ( e.g. the interaction of HSP60 with polyQ proteins 32 ). A similar mode of action is unlikely for highly hydrophilic IDPs like the LEA proteins, at least via hydrophobic interfaces. Instead, we have suggested that the anti-aggregation activity of hydrophilic IDPs results from physical interference whereby the IDP reduces the encounter frequency of aggregating protein species. In this report, we explore the characteristics of molecular shield activity and examine this in the context of an intermolecular versus an intramolecular stabilisation function.

Discussion

Maintaining the proper functioning of the proteome, a large and varied set of molecular operations broadly encapsulated by the term protein homeostasis or proteostasis, 13 is crucial for the health and survival of the cell. This becomes particularly critical under environmental conditions that adversely impact protein structure and function, and one of the more extreme stresses that might be imposed is the loss of essentially all cellular water through evaporation, i.e. desiccation. For organisms to survive extreme water loss it is assumed they are able to put in place protection or repair mechanisms to minimise or eliminate permanent damage to cellular components including proteins. 2 The alternative strategy, whereby the anhydrobiotic proteome is engineered through evolution with sufficient stability to withstand desiccation, seems unlikely, given the sporadic occurrence of desiccation tolerance in taxonomic groups. 14

One protection mechanism studied increasingly in recent years is the ability of IDPs to stabilise other proteins during desiccation. 2 , 17 IDPs such as the LEA proteins, whose expression is often associated with the acquisition of desiccation tolerance, 44 , 45 can help maintain protein function under conditions of water stress, at least partly by reducing aggregation of denatured species. 15 , 23 , 28 Superficially, the role of desiccation-relevant IDPs as anti-aggregants resembles that of classical molecular chaperones, but there are several points of difference such that we refer to IDPs in this context as molecular shields. For example, while molecular chaperones do contain disordered regions, 31 , 46 they have three-dimensional structure essential for their activity. In contrast, molecular shield proteins tend to be fully or largely disordered and function as entropic chains. Furthermore, molecular chaperones form transient complexes with their client proteins through specific binding sites, often hydrophobic patches, 12 , 32 whereas both in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that LEA proteins act by slowing the cohesion rate, rather than by sequestration, of aggregating protein species. 30 Any interaction of shield proteins with their clients is loose, although measurable in the case of the nuclear IDP anhydrin 36 and AavLEA1 ( Fig. 2b ), and is unlikely to involve hydrophobic patches given their highly hydrophilic nature. Data presented in this paper illuminate further differences since two molecular shields show reciprocal activity to that of the chaperone HSP70 in heat stress and desiccation aggregation assays ( Fig. 1 ), and the chaperone is able to co-immunoprecipitate with a polyQ-containing protein, while shield proteins do not, indicating differing strengths of interaction with clients ( Fig. 2 ).

We have begun to investigate the mechanism of action of molecular shields using synthetic macromolecules: polysaccharides such as ficoll 70 and Dextran 42 display shield activity in desiccation-induced aggregation experiments, and at low concentrations polysaccharides and LEA proteins can act together to reduce aggregation further than they might alone ( Fig. 3 ). One interpretation of these results is that both types of macromolecule function similarly in this assay. Polysaccharides are not considered to behave as molecular chaperones, but they are known to increase the stability of proteins ( e.g. dextran/horse radish peroxidase mixtures are more stable at high temperatures and low pH than the enzyme alone 47 ), most likely due to solution effects. ficoll and Dextran are neutral molecules, indicating that electrostatic interactions are not essential for the molecular shield function observed and that steric effects are at least partially responsible.

A model for molecular shield function based purely on steric interference ( Fig. 6a and b ), where shield proteins act as non-interacting space fillers that reduce collision rates between aggregating protein species, would address intermolecular effects of desiccation, i.e. aggregation, but not intramolecular effects, i.e. denaturation or structural modification of individual polypeptides. Experiments with the monomeric red fluorescent protein mCherry are relevant to this issue, since mCherry suffers relatively little aggregation on desiccation, while its spectral properties alter markedly, presumably due to conformational changes affecting its fluorescent centre ( Fig. 4 ). To a large extent, the decreased absorbance and emission caused by desiccation occurs whether other proteins, i.e. the LEA protein AavLEA1 or the control protein BSA, are present or not, as expected based on the above model. Intriguingly, however, a very modest reduction in this effect is seen at a 5 : 1 molar ratio of AavLEA1 to mCherry, meaning that the LEA protein offers limited protection against denaturation of the fluorophore. This cannot be explained by a purely steric effect, suggesting the reality of molecular shield function is more complicated. Indeed, it is already clear that this must be the case because proteins such as BSA or RNaseA 15 do not prevent desiccation-induced aggregation, as might be expected if molecular shields were merely non-interacting volume excluders. In fact, the observation that FRET can occur in cells between two different shield proteins, anhydrin 36 and AavLEA1 ( Fig. 2b ), and their targets is consistent with a degree of interaction. In turn, this means that the stabilisation effect of the polysaccharides such as ficoll 70 in desiccation-induced aggregation assays ( Fig. 3 ) is likely to involve some association between polysaccharide and target proteins. Accordingly, it is increasingly recognised that polysaccharides can interact with protein surfaces; one such polymer, polyethylene glycol, has been shown by NMR spectroscopy to interact with hydrophobic surfaces on cytochrome c , for example. 48

Therefore, a modified model would involve a molecular shield associating loosely with the surface of a target protein to form a three-dimensional protective barrier around it that would limit the approach of other proteins ( Fig. 6c ). This arrangement would probably be dynamic, with each shield molecule having a limited residence time on the protein surface, but would lead to an averaged volume exclusion effect similar to that of the entropic bristles of MAP2, tau and neurofilament side arms, which act as spacers of cytoskeletal filaments. 49 A further development of the model might incorporate the ideas of Tompa and Csermely, 46 who postulate that disordered regions of some molecular chaperones can gain structure on interaction with misfolded client proteins, thus allowing the client to partially unfold through an entropy transfer effect, and then follow the correct folding pathway leading to its native conformation. There is evidence for LEA proteins gaining secondary structure on association with membrane surfaces 50 – 52 and it is possible that similar folding could occur on the surface of client proteins. Such an entropy transfer model could explain the limited protection of mCherry fluorophore function by AavLEA1 ( Fig. 4c ).

Such a model of molecular shield function might suggest that the greatest protection would result from a covalent linkage of IDR to a labile protein, providing a shield in cis , rather than in trans . From an analysis of microbial proteomes, this would seem not to be a solution favoured by natural selection ( Table 1 ). The data of Fig. 4d , where the fusion protein AavLEA1-mCherry was no less susceptible to desiccation damage than mCherry alone, indicates that the in cis strategy is not effective against intramolecular damage, but this needs further examination using target proteins more prone to aggregation under stress. Certainly, there is evidence to show that a covalently linked LEA protein can decrease the potential for aggregation under some circumstances: Singh et al. 53 were able to reduce inclusion body formation and improve recovery of otherwise recalcitrant recombinant proteins by fusion with LEA proteins.

Molecular shield activity can be distinguished from that of molecular chaperones, although since it is increasingly recognised that many classical chaperones contain disordered regions apparently necessary for their function, 31 , 46 it can be argued that both shields and chaperones populate a continuum of protein stabilisation activities, involving neutralisation of exposed hydrophobic surfaces by specific interaction, refolding of client proteins driven by ATP hydrolysis or entropy transfer (or both), steric or electrosteric stabilisation of crowded colloidal suspensions, and volume exclusion. 17 In conclusion, we suggest there is a role in proteostasis for the stabilisation of the colloidal protein suspension of the cell interior by molecular shields, and that this is particularly significant under conditions of water stress.
