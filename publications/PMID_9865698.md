The shoot meristem gives rise to the aerial parts of higher plants by 
continuously initiating new organs. The basis of this activity is its ability to 
maintain a pool of pluripotent stem cells, which are the ultimate source of all 
tissues of the shoot. In Arabidopsis plants mutant for the WUSCHEL (WUS) gene, 
the stem cells are misspecified and appear to undergo differentiation. Here, we 
show that WUS encodes a novel homeodomain protein which presumably acts as a 
transcriptional regulator. The pattern of WUS expression suggests that stem 
cells in the shoot meristem are specified by an underlying cell group which is 
established in the 16-cell embryo and becomes localized to its prospective 
domain of function by asymmetric cell divisions.
