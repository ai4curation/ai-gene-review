MCF-7 cells lack caspase-3 but undergo mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis via 
caspase-7 activation. It is assumed that the Apaf-1-caspase-9 apoptosome 
processes caspase-7 in an analogous manner to that described for caspase-3. 
However, this has not been validated experimentally, and we have now 
characterized the caspase-7 activating apoptosome complex in MCF-7 cell lysates 
activated with dATP/cytochrome c. Apaf-1 oligomerizes to produce approximately 
1.4-MDa and approximately 700-kDa apoptosome complexes, and the latter complex 
directly cleaves/activates procaspase-7. This approximately 700-kDa apoptosome 
complex, which is also formed in apoptotic MCF-7 cells, is assembled by rapid 
oligomerization of Apaf-1 and followed by a slower process of procaspase-9 
recruitment and cleavage to form the p35/34 forms. However, procaspase-9 
recruitment and processing are accelerated in lysates supplemented with 
caspase-3. In lysates containing very low levels of Smac and Omi/HtrA2, XIAP 
(X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis) binds tightly to caspase-9 in the apoptosome 
complex, and as a result caspase-7 processing is abrogated. In contrast, in 
MCF-7 lysates containing Smac and Omi/HtrA2, active caspase-7 is released from 
the apoptosome and forms a stable approximately 200-kDa XIAP-caspase-7 complex, 
which apparently does not contain cIAP1 or cIAP2. Thus, in comparison to 
caspase-3-containing cells, XIAP appears to have a more significant 
antiapoptotic role in MCF-7 cells because it directly inhibits caspase-7 
activation by the apoptosome and also forms a stable approximately 200-kDa 
complex with active caspase-7.
