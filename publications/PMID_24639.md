Inactivation of human gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase by cystamine. 
Demonstration and quantification of enzyme-ligand complexes.

Lebo RV, Kredich NM.

Human erythrocyte gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase is inactivated by the 
disulfide cystamine (2,2'-dithiobis-(ethylamine)) at pH 8.2 with a rate constant 
of 1020 min-1 mM-1. Magnesium ion and various combinations of substrates and 
products confer differing degrees of protection against cystamine inactivation, 
thus allowing the detection and quantification of certain enzyme-ligand 
interactions. By measuring inactivation rates as a function of ligand 
concentrations in incomplete reaction mixtures, we have obtained evidence for 
the following complexes: enzyme . Mg2+; enzyme . Mg2+ . MgATP2-; enzyme . Mg2+ . 
L-glutamate; enzyme . Mg2+ . MgATP2- . L-glutamate; enzyme . Mg2+ . 
L-gamma-glutamyl-L-alpha-aminobutyrate. The data also imply the existence of 
enzyme . (Mg2+)2 . MgATP2- . L-glutamate and several enzyme forms resulting from 
the weak binding to L-alpha-aminobutyrate. The methods used permit the 
calculation of cystamine inactivation rates for most of these enzyme forms and 
also give values for the equilibrium constants describing their formation.
