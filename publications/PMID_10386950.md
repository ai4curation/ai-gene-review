We have screened a human cDNA library using an expressed sequence tag related to 
the BM-40/secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC)/osteonectin 
family of proteins and isolated a novel cDNA. It encodes a protein precursor of 
424 amino acids that consists of a signal peptide, a follistatin-like domain, a 
Ca2+-binding domain, a thyroglobulin-like domain, and a C-terminal region with 
two putative glycosaminoglycan attachment sites. The protein is homologous to 
testican-1 and was termed testican-2. Testican-1 is a proteoglycan originally 
isolated from human seminal plasma that is also expressed in brain. Northern 
blot hybridization of testican-2 showed a 6.1-kb mRNA expressed mainly in CNS 
but also found in lung and testis. A widespread expression in multiple neuronal 
cell types in olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, 
cerebellum, and medulla was detected by in situ hybridization. A recombinant 
fragment consisting of the Ca2+-binding EF-hand domain and the 
thyroglobulin-like domain of testican-2 showed a reversible Ca2+-dependent 
conformational change in circular dichroism studies. Testican-1 and -2 form a 
novel Ca2+-binding proteoglycan family built of modular domains with the 
potential to participate in diverse steps of neurogenesis.
