The mammalian retromer complex consists of SNX1, SNX2, Vps26, Vps29 and Vps35, 
and retrieves lysosomal enzyme receptors from endosomes to the trans-Golgi 
network. The structure of human Vps26A at 2.1-A resolution reveals two curved 
beta-sandwich domains connected by a polar core and a flexible linker. Vps26 has 
an unpredicted structural relationship to arrestins. The Vps35-binding site on 
Vps26 maps to a mobile loop spanning residues 235-246, near the tip of the 
C-terminal domain. The loop is phylogenetically conserved and provides a 
mechanism for Vps26 integration into the complex that leaves the rest of the 
structure free for engagements with membranes and for conformational changes. 
Hydrophobic residues and a glycine in this loop are required for integration 
into the retromer complex and endosomal localization of human Vps26, and for the 
function of yeast Vps26 in carboxypeptidase Y sorting.
