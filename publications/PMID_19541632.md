Transcriptional silencing is a crucial process that is mediated through 
chromatin structure. The histone deacetylase Sir2 silences genomic regions that 
include telomeres, ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and the cryptic mating-type loci. Here, 
we report an unsuspected role for the enzyme Gas1 in locus-specific 
transcriptional silencing. GAS1 encodes a beta-1,3-glucanosyltransferase 
previously characterized for its role in cell wall biogenesis. In gas1 mutants, 
telomeric silencing is defective and rDNA silencing is enhanced. We show that 
the catalytic activity of Gas1 is required for normal silencing, and that Gas1's 
role in silencing is distinct from its role in cell wall biogenesis. Established 
hallmarks of silent chromatin, such as Sir2 and Sir3 binding, H4K16 
deacetylation, and H3K56 deacetylation, appear unaffected in gas1 mutants. Thus, 
another event required for telomeric silencing must be influenced by GAS1. 
Because the catalytic activity of Gas1 is required for telomeric silencing, Gas1 
localizes to the nuclear periphery, and Gas1 and Sir2 physically interact, we 
propose a model in which carbohydrate modification of chromatin components 
provides a new regulatory element that may be critical for chromatin function 
but which is virtually unexplored in the current landscape of chromatin 
analysis.
