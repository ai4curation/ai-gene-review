The protein kinase transforming-growth-factor-beta-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) is 
a key regulator in the pro-inflammatory signaling pathway and is activated by 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 
We describe the identification of TAK1 as a client protein of the 90 kDa 
heat-shock protein (Hsp90)/cell division cycle protein 37 (Cdc37) chaperones. 
However, Hsp90 is not required for the activation of TAK1 as short exposure to 
the Hsp90 inhibitor, 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) did not 
affect its activation by LPS or IL-1. Prolonged treatment of cells with 17-AAG 
inhibits Hsp90 and downregulates TAK1. Our results suggest that Hsp90 is 
required for the folding and stability of TAK1 but is displaced and no longer 
required when TAK1 is complexed to TAK1-binding protein-1 (TAB1).
