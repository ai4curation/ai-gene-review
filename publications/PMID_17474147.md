Systematic identification of direct protein-protein interactions is often 
hampered by difficulties in expressing and purifying the corresponding 
full-length proteins. By taking advantage of the modular nature of many 
regulatory proteins, we attempted to simplify protein-protein interactions to 
the corresponding domain-ligand recognition and employed peptide arrays to 
identify such binding events. A group of 12 Src homology (SH) 3 domains from 
eight human proteins (Swiss-Prot ID: SRC, PLCG1, P85A, NCK1, GRB2, FYN, CRK) 
were used to screen a peptide target array composed of 1536 potential ligands, 
which led to the identification of 921 binary interactions between these 
proteins and 284 targets. To assess the efficiency of the peptide array target 
screening (PATS) method in identifying authentic protein-protein interactions, 
we examined a set of interactions mediated by the PLCgamma1 SH3 domain by 
coimmunoprecipitation and/or affinity pull-downs using full-length proteins and 
achieved a 75% success rate. Furthermore, we characterized a novel interaction 
between PLCgamma1 and hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) identified by 
PATS and demonstrated that the PLCgamma1 SH3 domain negatively regulated HPK1 
kinase activity. Compared to protein interactions listed in the online predicted 
human interaction protein database (OPHID), the majority of interactions 
identified by PATS are novel, suggesting that, when extended to the large number 
of peptide interaction domains encoded by the human genome, PATS should aid in 
the mapping of the human interactome.
