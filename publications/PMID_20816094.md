Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 (ACAD9) is a recently identified member of the acyl-CoA 
dehydrogenase family. It closely resembles very long-chain acyl-CoA 
dehydrogenase (VLCAD), involved in mitochondrial beta oxidation of long-chain 
fatty acids. Contrary to its previously proposed involvement in fatty acid 
oxidation, we describe a role for ACAD9 in oxidative phosphorylation. ACAD9 
binds complex I assembly factors NDUFAF1 and Ecsit and is specifically required 
for the assembly of complex I. Furthermore, ACAD9 mutations result in complex I 
deficiency and not in disturbed long-chain fatty acid oxidation. This strongly 
contrasts with its evolutionary ancestor VLCAD, which we show is not required 
for complex I assembly and clearly plays a role in fatty acid oxidation. Our 
results demonstrate that two closely related metabolic enzymes have diverged at 
the root of the vertebrate lineage to function in two separate mitochondrial 
metabolic pathways and have clinical implications for the diagnosis of complex I 
deficiency.
