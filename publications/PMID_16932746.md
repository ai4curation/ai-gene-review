Molecular mimicry of cytokines and cytokine receptors is a strategy used by 
poxviruses and herpesviruses to modulate host immunity. The human 
cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL144 gene, situated in the UL/b' region of the viral 
genome, has amino-acid sequence similarity to members of the tumour necrosis 
factor receptor superfamily. We report that UL144 is a potent activator of 
NFkappaB-induced transcription in a TRAF6-dependent manner. This NFkappaB 
activation enhances expression of the chemokine CCL22 through the NFkappaB 
responsive elements found in its promoter. In contrast to the clinical HCMV 
isolates, extensively passaged laboratory strains lack the UL/b' region and 
hence do not encode UL144. Consistent with this, infection with viruses that 
carry UL/b' causes NFkappaB activation and CCL22 expression, a phenotype that is 
not observed after infections with strains lacking the UL/b' region. Moreover, 
knockdown of UL144, TRAF6 or NFkappaB by specific siRNA in infections with 
UL144-encoding HCMV prevents the activation of CCL22 expression normally 
observed after infection with UL/b' positive HCMV. Upregulation of CCL22, which 
attracts Th2 and regulatory T cells, may help HCMV evade immune surveillance.

Abstract

Molecular mimicry of cytokines and cytokine receptors is a strategy used by poxviruses and herpesviruses to modulate host immunity. The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL144 gene, situated in the UL/b′ region of the viral genome, has amino-acid sequence similarity to members of the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily. We report that UL144 is a potent activator of NFκB-induced transcription in a TRAF6-dependent manner. This NFκB activation enhances expression of the chemokine CCL22 through the NFκB responsive elements found in its promoter. In contrast to the clinical HCMV isolates, extensively passaged laboratory strains lack the UL/b′ region and hence do not encode UL144. Consistent with this, infection with viruses that carry UL/b′ causes NFκB activation and CCL22 expression, a phenotype that is not observed after infections with strains lacking the UL/b′ region. Moreover, knockdown of UL144, TRAF6 or NFκB by specific siRNA in infections with UL144-encoding HCMV prevents the activation of CCL22 expression normally observed after infection with UL/b′ positive HCMV. Upregulation of CCL22, which attracts Th2 and regulatory T cells, may help HCMV evade immune surveillance.

Introduction

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a member of the betaherpesvirus family. It is species-specific and can cause severe disease in neonates and in immunosuppressed individuals such as allograft transplant recipients and patients with AIDS ( Pass, 2001 ), although the exact disease mechanisms are unclear. The HCMV genome comprises 236 kb of dsDNA, one of the largest human virus, and many of its genes are nonessential for replication in fibroblasts ( Dunn et al , 2003 ). The long 15 kb unique region UL/b′ contains at least 19 open reading frames (ORFs) that are found in HCMV clinical isolates but have been lost in extensively passaged laboratory strains and are dispensable for growth in vitro ( Cha et al , 1996 ). The retention of these ORFs in HCMV clinical isolates together with recent evidence that clinical isolates, but not the attenuated laboratory strain AD169, can replicate in SCID mice into which human tissues were implanted suggest that the UL/b′ region is required for viral infection in vivo ( Wang et al , 2005 ). Consistent with this, some of the UL/b′ region genes may be implicated in immune evasion, such as the chemokine homologues UL146 and UL147 ( Hengel et al , 1998 ; Mocarski, 2002 ). The UL144 ORF is encoded in the UL/b′ region and a candidate for a pathogenesis marker because of its sequence similarity to the herpes simplex virus entry mediator (HveA or HVEM) ( Benedict et al , 1999 ) and other members of the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) ( Locksley et al , 2001 ; Ware, 2003 ), which are critical for defence against viral pathogens such as HCMV ( Quinnan et al , 1984 ).

Avoidance of the host immune system by viruses is commonplace ( Alcami and Koszinowski, 2000 ; Tortorella et al , 2000 ). Some viruses, such as Adenovirus, HCMV and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), prevent cell surface expression or colocalization of specific receptors. Mimicry of cytokines and cytokine receptors is a mechanism of immune evasion identified in large DNA viruses (poxviruses and herpesviruses) ( McFadden and Murphy, 2000 ; Alcami, 2003 ). Poxviruses encode secreted decoy receptors for cytokines and chemokines that intercept immune communications. Poxvirus TNFR homologues have amino-acid sequence similarity to the extracellular TNF binding domain of the cellular counterparts but lack the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, and hence they are secreted and neutralize TNF activity. A homologue of CD30, another TNFRSF member, has also been identified in poxviruses. UL144 encoded by HCMV is the only TNFRSF member identified in herpesviruses. In contrast to the poxvirus secreted TNFR homologues, UL144 has a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail, and it is a membrane-anchored glycoprotein retained intracellularly ( Benedict et al , 1999 ). UL144 may act as a decoy receptor but no interaction with members of the TNF superfamily (TNFSF) has been identified so far. Recently, the ectodomian of UL144 has been shown to interact with B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), belonging to the Ig superfamily, and to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro ( Cheung et al , 2005 ).

Viruses also modulate the immune response by interfering with transcription and signalling pathways of the host cell. The V protein of SV5, for example, causes the degradation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and prevents dsRNA signalling to the interferon (IFN) promoter in an IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) dependent manner ( Poole et al , 2002 ). The poxviral protein N1L blocks IRF-3 signalling via the toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway ( DiPerna et al , 2004 ). Viruses also target the NFκB pathway, which is shared by several proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and interleukin 1 (IL-l), and TLRs ( Li and Verma, 2002 ; Dempsey et al , 2003 ; Bonizzi and Karin, 2004 ). TNFR-activated factor 6 (TRAF6) is a mediator of NFκB activation and signals through protein kinase cascades via activation of the TAK1 complex. TAK1 phosphorylates and activates the IκB kinase complex, which then phosphorylates the NFκB inhibitor IκB, targeting it for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. NFκB is then freed to enter the nucleus where it can act as a transcription factor. Viruses may prevent or enhance NFκB activation. For example, poxvirus proteins N1L and K1L interfere with the IκB kinase complex ( DiPerna et al , 2004 ; Shisler and Jin, 2004 ) and prevent NFκB activation whereas latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) protein of EBV activates the TRAF-mediated NFκB pathway ( Schultheiss et al , 2001 ; Nakayama et al , 2004 ).

Here, we report that the UL144 protein of HCMV upregulates NFκB-dependent transcription through a mechanism involving TRAF6. We also show that this UL144-induced NFκB activation is concomitant with an increased expression of CCL22 (macrophage derived chemokine, MDC), a chemokine implicated in the attraction of Th2 cells, which may reduce host Th1 immune responses and be advantageous for HCMV in vivo .

Discussion

The large coding capacity of the genome of herpesviruses and poxviruses enables the acquisition of a variety of genes that modulate the host immune response. Some of these immune evasion genes mimic cytokine and cytokine receptors involved in immune regulation ( McFadden and Murphy, 2000 ; Alcami, 2003 ). Secreted decoy receptors for cytokines have been identified almost exclusively in poxviruses and only three examples have been described in herpesviruses ( Alcami, 2003 ): a granulocyte–macrophage colony stimulating factor binding protein encoded by EBV and three chemokine binding proteins encoded by murine gammaherpesvirus 68, alphaherpesviruses and HCMV ( Alcami, 2003 ; Bryant et al , 2003 ; Wang et al , 2004 ). These herpesvirus decoy receptors lack amino-acid sequence similarity to their cellular counterparts. By contrast, the UL144 protein encoded by HCMV is a homologue of HVEM and other TNFRSF members, and is anchored into cell membranes.

The presence in UL144 of cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) characteristic of TNFRSF members suggests that UL144 may interact with TNFSF members, but previous studies have failed to identify a ligand partner for UL144 by ELISA ( Benedict et al , 1999 ). Here, we have extended those studies to other TNFRSF members and used a different and highly sensitive methodology (SPR) to screen for potential ligands, but we have failed to detect any specific interaction of TNFSF members with UL144. The fact the UL144 lacks CRD3, which has been implicated in binding of TNFR to LTα, led to the suggestion that UL144 may not possess a ligand binding domain ( Benedict et al , 1999 ). Recently, UL144 has been shown to interact with the Ig superfamily member BTLA, mimicking the interaction of HVEM with BTLA, and to inhibit T-cell proliferation in vitro ( Cheung et al , 2005 ). HVEM also interacts with LIGHT but no interaction of UL144 with LIGHT has been detected (this report) ( Benedict et al , 1999 ).

In contrast to the decoy receptor function of the other viral cytokine receptors, the recent demonstration that UL144 interacts with BTLA suggests that UL144 mimics the inhibitory co-signalling function of HVEM and may modulate T-cell responses ( Cheung et al , 2005 ). Here, we report a different and complementary function of UL144, which takes place within the infected cell: the activation of NFκB signalling. This activation was demonstrated by expression of UL144 in cells and, most important, during the infection with UL144-containing HCMV. Altogether, several lines of evidence suggest that UL144 is the only gene responsible for the observed activation of NFκB in HCMV infections: (i) this NFκB activation does not occur in infections with HCMV laboratory strains lacking UL144; (ii) expression of UL144 in cells infected with UL144-deficient viruses induces NFκB activation; and (iii) the HCMV strain-specific inhibition of UL144 expression with siRNA prevented CCL22 upregulation, which is dependent on NFκB activation. The induction of the alternative pathway of NFκB activation by UL144, causing the degradation of NFκB2/p100 into p52 ( Bonizzi and Karin, 2004 ), was also demonstrated in transfected cells.

The mechanism by which UL144 activates NFκB is TRAF6-dependent and UL144 appears to achieve this by sequestering TRAF6 in the perinuclear region. Our results show that TRAF6 and UL144 are part of a larger complex and that they are in close proximity, as indicated by co-precipitation and co-localization analyses. However, we do not know whether UL144 and TRAF6 interact directly and the possibility that this interaction is mediated by other proteins has yet to be determined. The short cytoplasmic tail of UL144 has a YXXZ motif (Z is a hydrophobic amino acid) that is important in sorting of transmembrane proteins, and mutations of the tyrosine residue causes a higher expression of UL144 at the cell surface ( Benedict et al , 1999 ). However, the cytoplasmic tail of UL144 lacks the motifs implicated in interactions with TRAFs. The inhibition of UL144-induced CCL22 upregulation by siRNA specific for TRAF6 or NFκB establishes the requirement of these cellular factors for this function of UL144 within HCMV-infected cells.

The high amino-acid sequence variability in the UL144 protein encoded by HCMV clinical isolates is relevant considering the high conservation of other proteins, and has classified the isolates in three major groups ( Lurain et al , 1999 ). Interestingly, all the amino-acid variability is found in the signal peptide and ectodomain of UL144, with 16–21% of amino-acid substitutions, mostly nonconservative, between isolates belonging to group 1 and groups 2/3. The finding that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of UL144 are identical among 45 clinical isolates, with the exception of a R161K substitution in four isolates, is striking and strongly suggests that these domains are important for the correct function of UL144. The sequence of UL144 from the two UL144-containing viruses tested in our studies belong to the group 1 (Toledo) and group 3 (TB40E) and are highly divergent in their ectodomain ( Dolan et al , 2004 ), with a single L151F substitution in the transmembrane domain of the UL144 from TB40E. Our finding that both these UL144 variants are able to induce NFκB activation, transduce signalling through TRAF6 and upregulate CCL22 production, either after UL144 transfection or upon virus infection, would be consistent with the conserved regions being involved in this function of UL144.

Viral proteins may evade cell signalling immune system pathways ( Goodbourn et al , 2000 ; Andrejeva et al , 2002 ; Poole et al , 2002 ; Iqbal et al , 2004 ; Nakayama et al , 2004 ). Interestingly, like HCMV UL144, the LMP1 protein of EBV also upregulates NFκB but through a different mechanism. LMP1 has six transmembrane segments and is unrelated to members of the TNFRSF, but its long cytoplasmic domain resembles that of TNFRSF members and acts as a docking site for recruiting and activating signalling proteins including TRAFs ( Eliopoulos and Young, 2001 ; Schultheiss et al , 2001 ; Li and Chang, 2003 ). The HVEM homologue UL144 lacks a long cytoplasmic tail, but UL144 appears to act like LMP1 as a constitutive activator of NFκB and also engages TRAF6 ( Schultheiss et al , 2001 ). Thus, different human herpesviruses, EBV and HCMV, have evolved unrelated proteins to subvert the NFκB pathway for their benefit.

The transcription factor NFκB is critical for mounting both innate and adaptive immune responses to infection through induction of immune-related genes ( Li and Verma, 2002 ). In addition, NFκB activation upon HCMV infection facilitates viral immediate-early gene transcription and protein expression at late times of the HCMV replication cycle ( Sambucetti et al , 1989 ; Yurochko et al , 1995 ). Recent evidence shows that NFκB activation is not required for HCMV replication in fibroblasts but NFκB signalling is important for the production and efficiency of antiviral factors such as TNF and IFN ( Benedict et al , 2004 ; Eickhoff and Cotten, 2005 ). HCMV establishes latency in cells of the myeloid lineage and, although NFκB may be involved in virus neutralization, NFκB's exact role in virus reactivation and pathogenesis in vivo is not fully understood ( Jarvis and Nelson, 2002 ). HCMV prevents external signalling to the cell by reducing cell surface expression of the 55-kDa TNFRI, a receptor that activates several signal transduction pathways including NFκB ( Baillie et al , 2003 ). At the same time, we show that HCMV triggers NFκB signalling by expression of UL144, allowing the virus to modulate this pathway for its own benefit.

The biological relevance of the cellular genes affected by UL144-induced NFκB activation for HCMV replication is of great interest. Here, we show that one end result of UL144-mediated NFκB activation is the expression of CCL22, a chemoattractant for Th2 cells and regulatory T cells via CCR4 ( Yoshie et al , 2001 ). Interestingly, this also parallels EBV since LMP1 triggers CCL22 expression ( Nakayama et al , 2004 ). We propose that the upregulation of CCL22 will induce recruitment of Th2 cells that may unbalance an efficient antiviral Th1 response and, in addition, may enhance the migration of T regulatory cells with immunosuppressive properties to sites of infection. This would be complemented by the proposed additional function of UL144 as an inhibitor of T-cell activation through interaction with BTLA ( Cheung et al , 2005 ) and by the ability of the chemokine receptor homologue US28 and the secreted chemokine binding protein UL21.5 encoded by HCMV to sequester CCL5, a chemokine that attracts Th1 cells and cytotoxic T cells via CCR5 ( Bodaghi et al , 1998 ; Yoshie et al , 2001 ; Wang et al , 2004 ). These mechanisms would allow the virus to evade the host immune system. The results reported here establish a new function of UL144 that is demonstrated in the context of HCMV infection and consists of the subversion of the NFκB signalling pathway leading to upregulation of cytokines that may be advantageous for the virus.
