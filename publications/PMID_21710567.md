In prokaryotes, transcription results from the activity of a 400 kDa RNA 
polymerase (RNAP) protein complex composed of at least five subunits (2α, β, β', 
ω). To ensure adequate responses to changing environmental cues, RNAP activity 
is tightly controlled by means of interacting regulatory proteins. Here, we 
report the affinity-purification of the Bacillus subtilis RNAP complexes from 
cells in different growth states and stress conditions, and the quantitative 
assessment by mass spectrometry of the dynamic changes in the composition of the 
RNAP complex. The stoichiometry of RNA polymerase was determined by a comparison 
of two mass spectrometry-based quantification methods: a label-based and a 
label-free method. The validated label-free method was then used to quantify the 
proteins associated with RNAP. The levels of sigma factors bound to RNAP varied 
during growth and exposure to stress. Elongation factors, helicases such as HelD 
and PcrA, and novel unknown proteins were also associated with RNAP complexes. 
The content in 6S RNAs of purified RNAP complexes increased at the onset of the 
stationary phase. These quantitative variations in the protein and RNA 
composition of the RNAP complexes well correlate with the known physiology of B. 
subtilis cells under different conditions.
