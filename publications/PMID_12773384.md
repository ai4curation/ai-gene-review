Insulin stimulates glucose uptake in fat and muscle cells via the translocation 
of the GLUT4 glucose transporter from intracellular storage vesicles to the cell 
surface. The signaling pathways linking the insulin receptor to GLUT4 
translocation in adipocytes involve activation of the Rho family GTPases 
TC10alpha and beta. We report here the identification of TCGAP, a potential 
effector for Rho family GTPases. TCGAP consists of N-terminal PX and SH3 
domains, a central Rho GAP domain and multiple proline-rich regions in the 
C-terminus. TCGAP specifically interacts with cdc42 and TC10beta through its GAP 
domain. Although it has GAP activity in vitro, TCGAP is not active as a GAP in 
intact cells. TCGAP translocates to the plasma membrane in response to insulin 
in adipocytes. The N-terminal PX domain interacts specifically with phos 
phatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate. Overexpression of the full-length and 
C-terminal fragments of TCGAP inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and 
GLUT4 translocation. Thus, TCGAP may act as a downstream effector of TC10 in the 
regulation of insulin-stimulated glucose transport.
