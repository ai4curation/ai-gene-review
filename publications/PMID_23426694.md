Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) play a key role in hearing by rapidly and 
faithfully transmitting signals from the cochlea to the brain. Identification of 
the transcriptional networks that ensure the proper specification and wiring of 
SGNs during development will lay the foundation for efforts to rewire a damaged 
cochlea. Here, we show that the transcription factor Gata3, which is expressed 
in SGNs throughout their development, is essential for formation of the 
intricately patterned connections in the cochlea. We generated conditional 
knock-out mice in which Gata3 is deleted after SGNs are specified. Cochlear 
wiring is severely disrupted in these animals, with premature extension of 
neurites that follow highly abnormal trajectories toward their targets, as shown 
using in vitro neurite outgrowth assays together with time-lapse imaging of 
whole embryonic cochleae. Expression profiling of mutant neurons revealed a 
broad shift in gene expression toward a more differentiated state, concomitant 
with minor changes in SGN identity. Thus, Gata3 appears to serve as an 
"intermediate regulator" that guides SGNs through differentiation and preserves 
the auditory fate. As the first auditory-specific regulator of SGN development, 
Gata3 provides a useful molecular entry point for efforts to engineer SGNs for 
the restoration of hearing.

Abstract

Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) play a key role in hearing by rapidly and faithfully transmitting signals from the cochlea to the brain. Identification of the transcriptional networks that ensure the proper specification and wiring of SGNs during development will lay the foundation for efforts to rewire a damaged cochlea.

We generated conditional knock-out mice in which Gata3 is deleted after SGNs are specified. Cochlear wiring is severely disrupted in these animals, with premature extension of neurites that follow highly abnormal trajectories toward their targets, as shown using in vitro neurite outgrowth assays together with time-lapse imaging of whole embryonic cochleae. Expression profiling of mutant neurons revealed a broad shift in gene expression toward a more differentiated state, concomitant with minor changes in SGN identity. Thus, Gata3 appears to serve as an “intermediate regulator” that guides SGNs through differentiation and preserves the auditory fate. As the first auditory-specific regulator of SGN development, Gata3 provides a useful molecular entry point for efforts to engineer SGNs for the restoration of hearing.

Introduction

The perception of sound is mediated by precisely wired circuits in the inner ear ( Appler and Goodrich, 2011 ). Sound stimuli are detected by hair cells in the cochlea and transmitted to the CNS by spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). SGNs play a central role in auditory perception, because they must faithfully encode and communicate the frequency, duration, and intensity of all sounds to the CNS. For instance, hair cells and SGNs are arranged from low to high sound frequencies along the apical–basal axis, with each SGN innervating a single inner hair cell. This strict tonotopic organization is preserved in the central SGN projections, which exit through the eighth nerve and terminate in the cochlear nucleus, with low-frequency neurons projecting more ventrally than high-frequency neurons. Hence, the intricate wiring of the cochlea is a physical representation of the logic underlying sound perception.

Deciphering the developmental mechanisms that establish cochlear wiring is fundamental for efforts to treat deafness. Hearing loss is a common sensory disorder in humans, ranging from inherited deafness at birth to adult-onset hearing loss attributable to noise, trauma, or aging ( Friedman et al., 2007 ; Konings et al., 2009 ; Bielefeld et al., 2010 ). Although the causes of deafness are diverse, cochlear implants offer a broadly effective treatment, because they circumvent abnormal cochlear function by directly stimulating the cochlear nerve. An exciting possible treatment for deafness is to stimulate hair cell regeneration ( Okano and Kelley, 2012 ). Importantly, both approaches require the presence of SGNs that maintain proper connections with the cochlea and the brain. Although SGNs are an important therapeutic target, we do not yet have a molecular entry point for creating SGNs or controlling their connectivity. Identification of the intrinsic factors that govern auditory-specific features of SGN development would provide an important step forward.

Developing SGNs experience a complex series of generic and cell-type-specific changes in gene expression that unfold over time ( Lu et al., 2011 ). In other systems, programs of gene expression are activated by combinatorial codes of transcription factors that determine the fate of a particular neuron. Subsequently, neurons undergo dramatic changes in gene expression that allow their projections to find their way to the appropriate targets and form synapses. Unfortunately, little is known about how these complex events are broadly orchestrated. Clues from the immune system support the need for additional transcriptional control as differentiation progresses. For instance, ongoing regulation of T-cell identity at intermediate stages is necessary to repress non-T-cell genes and activate pro-T-cell pathways ( David-Fung et al., 2006 ). Moreover, transitions through each stage remain flexible, such that T cells can adapt in response to cues in their environment. Hence, cell identities emerge gradually, with multiple differentiation events coordinated in parallel.

Here, we sought to identify intrinsic regulators of SGN development. We found that the zinc finger transcription factor Gata3 plays a key role by coordinating both the maintenance and execution of SGN cell fates, as well as the formation of their stereotyped patterns of connections in the cochlea.

Discussion

Here, we demonstrate that a single transcription factor, Gata3, orchestrates multiple facets of SGN development to generate the exquisitely wired circuits of the cochlea. In addition to being required for the initial specification of SGNs, continued Gata3 activity controls the timing of SGN neurite outgrowth, as well as their trajectories within the cochlea. This is also evident at the molecular level, in which we found changes in both generic developmental timing and auditory-specific programs of gene expression. Moreover, maintained Gata3 expression is necessary for repression of vestibular genes in SGNs, underscoring the ongoing nature of cell fate determination. Thus, Gata3 ensures that SGNs are both properly specified and wired for the sense of hearing. These studies establish Gata3 as the first auditory-specific regulator of SGN development.
