Necrotic cell death is a common feature in numerous human neurodegenerative 
disorders. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, gain-of-function mutations in 
genes that encode specific ion channel subunits such as the degenerins DEG-1 and 
MEC-4, and the acetylcholine receptor subunit DEG-3 lead to necrotic-like 
degeneration of a subset of neurons. Neuronal demise caused by ion channel 
hyperactivity is accompanied by intense degradation of cytoplasmic contents, 
dramatic membrane infolding and vacuole formation; however, the cellular 
pathways underlying such processes remain largely unknown. Here we show that the 
function of three autophagy genes, whose yeast and mammalian orthologs are 
implicated in cytoplasmic self-degradation, membrane trafficking and the 
cellular response to starvation, contributes to ion-channel-dependent 
neurotoxicity in C. elegans. Inactivation of unc-51, bec-1 and lgg-1, the worm 
counterparts of the yeast autophagy genes Atg1, Atg6 and Atg8 respectively, 
partially suppresses degeneration of neurons with toxic ion channel variants. We 
also demonstrate that the TOR-kinase-mediated signaling pathway, a nutrient 
sensing system that downregulates the autophagy gene cascade, protects neurons 
from undergoing necrotic cell death, whereas nutrient deprivation promotes 
necrosis. Our findings reveal a role for autophagy genes in neuronal cell loss 
in C. elegans.
