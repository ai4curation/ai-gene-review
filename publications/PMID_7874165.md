Hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation (HPD) (also 
known as dopa responsive dystonia) is a dystonia with onset in childhood that 
shows a marked response without any side effects to levodopa. Recently the gene 
for dopa responsive dystonia (DRD) was mapped to chromosome 14q. Here we report 
that GTP cyclohydrolase I is mapped to 14q22.1-q22.2. The identification of four 
independent mutations of the gene for GTP cyclohydrolase I in patients with HPD, 
as well as a marked decrease in the enzyme's activity in mononuclear blood 
cells, confirms that the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene is a causative gene for 
HPD/DRD. This is the first report of a causative gene for the inherited 
dystonias.
