Previous studies indicate an important role for the cellular prion protein 
(PrP(C)) in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In the 
present study, we analyzed the involvement of PrP(C) in different pathological 
mechanisms underlying AD: the processing of the amyloid-β protein precursor 
(AβPP) and its interaction with AβPP, tau, and different phosphorylated forms of 
the tau protein (p-tau). The effect of PrP(C) on tau expression was investigated 
in various cellular compartments using a HEK293 cell model expressing a tau 
mutant (3PO-tau) or wild type (WT)-tau. We could show that PrP(C) reduces AβPP 
cleavage, leading to decreased levels of Aβ40 and sAβPP without changing the 
protein expression of AβPP, β-secretase, or γ-secretase. Tau and its 
phosphorylated forms were identified as interactions partners for PrP(C), 
raising the question as to whether PrP(C) might also be involved in tau 
pathology. Overexpression of PrP(C) in PRNP and 3PO-tau transfected cells 
resulted in a reduction of 3PO-tau and p-tau as well as a decrease of 
3PO-tau-related toxicity. In addition, we used the transgenic PrP(C) knockout 
(Prnp0/0) mouse line to study the dynamics of tau phosphorylation, an important 
pathological hallmark in the pathogenesis of AD in vivo. There, an effect of 
PrP(C) on tau expression could be observed under oxidative stress conditions but 
not during aging. In summary, we provide further evidence for interactions of 
PrP(C) with proteins that are known to be the key players in AD pathogenesis. We 
identified tau and its phosphorylated forms as potential PrP-interactors and 
report a novel protective function of PrP(C) in AD-like tau pathology.
