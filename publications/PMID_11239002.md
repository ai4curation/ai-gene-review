Chromosome 7q22 has been the focus of many cytogenetic and molecular studies 
aimed at delineating regions commonly deleted in myeloid leukemias and 
myelodysplastic syndromes. We have compared a gene-dense, GC-rich sub-region of 
7q22 with the orthologous region on mouse chromosome 5. A physical map of 640 kb 
of genomic DNA from mouse chromosome 5 was derived from a series of overlapping 
bacterial artificial chromosomes. A 296 kb segment from the physical map, 
spanning ACHE: to Tfr2, was compared with 267 kb of human sequence. We 
identified a conserved linkage of 12 genes including an open reading frame 
flanked by ACHE: and Asr2, a novel cation-chloride cotransporter interacting 
protein Cip1, Ephb4, Zan and Perq1. While some of these genes have been 
previously described, in each case we present new data derived from our 
comparative sequence analysis. Adjacent unfinished sequence data from the mouse 
contains an orthologous block of 10 additional genes including three novel cDNA 
sequences that we subsequently mapped to human 7q22. Methods for displaying 
comparative genomic information, including unfinished sequence data, are 
becoming increasingly important. We supplement our printed comparative analysis 
with a new, Web-based program called Laj (local alignments with java). Laj 
provides interactive access to archived pairwise sequence alignments via the 
WWW. It displays synchronized views of a dot-plot, a percent identity plot, a 
nucleotide-level local alignment and a variety of relevant annotations. Our 
mouse-human comparison can be viewed at http://web.uvic.ca/~bioweb/laj.html. Laj 
is available at http://bio.cse.psu.edu/, along with online documentation and 
additional examples of annotated genomic regions.
