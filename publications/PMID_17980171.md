The CDA14, a 45kD protein, is currently annotated as PTX1-like protein or ERGIC 
32. Over expressing CDA14 can slow PC11 cell proliferation rate. In HepG2 cells, 
it had been demonstrated that CDA14 is involved in protein transportation. The 
knowledge about the protein is very limited and not clarified. The CDA14 and its 
homologous proteins form a family and are restricted to eukaryotes. In the 
family, there are no homologous sequences with resolved three-dimensional 
structure and their functions are difficult to predict. Transcriptional 
expression of CDA14 in three hepatoma cell lines, Hu7, HCC and HepG2, was lower 
than normal liver tissue and liver carcinoma tissue. In this study, functional 
proteomic techniques were utilized in searching the interacting counterpart of 
CDA14. Several proteins involved in protein translation and folding were 
selectively precipitated with CDA14 and identified mass spectrometry. 
Interaction of CDA14 and elongation factor 1alpha was confirmed by Western 
blotting and confocal microscopy. Elongation factor 1alpha is a multiple 
function protein and involved in several biological mechanisms, including 
protein synthesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis and tumorigensis. 
Over-expression of CDA14 down regulated the proliferation of HepG2 cells. These 
results suggest that CDA14 participated in the elongation factor 1alpha 
regulated mechanisms.
