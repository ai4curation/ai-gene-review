Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation is a conserved modification that 
generally represses transcription. In Caenorhabditis elegans it is enriched on 
silent tissue-specific genes and repetitive elements. In met-2 set-25 double 
mutants, which lack all H3K9 methylation (H3K9me), embryos differentiate 
normally, although mutant adults are sterile owing to extensive 
DNA-damage-driven apoptosis in the germ line. Transposons and simple repeats are 
derepressed in both germline and somatic tissues. This unprogrammed 
transcription correlates with increased rates of repeat-specific insertions and 
deletions, copy number variation, R loops and enhanced sensitivity to 
replication stress. We propose that H3K9me2 or H3K9me3 stabilizes and protects 
repeat-rich genomes by suppressing transcription-induced replication stress.
