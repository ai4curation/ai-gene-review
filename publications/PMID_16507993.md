Telomerase maintains cell viability and chromosomal stability through the 
addition of telomere repeats to chromosome ends. The reactivation of telomerase 
through the upregulation of TERT, the telomerase protein subunit, is an 
important step during cancer development, yet TERT protein function and 
regulation remain incompletely understood. Despite its close sequence similarity 
to human TERT (hTERT), we find that mouse TERT (mTERT) does not immortalize 
primary human fibroblasts. Here we exploit these differences in activity to 
understand TERT protein function by creating chimeric mouse-human TERT proteins. 
Through the analysis of these chimeric TERT proteins, we find that sequences in 
the human carboxy-terminal domain are critical for telomere maintenance in human 
fibroblasts. The substitution of the human carboxy-terminal sequences into the 
mouse TERT protein is sufficient to confer immortalization and maintenance of 
telomere length and function. Strikingly, we find that hTERT protein accumulates 
to markedly higher levels than does mTERT protein and that the sequences 
governing this difference in protein regulation also reside in the 
carboxy-terminal domain. These elevated protein levels, which are characteristic 
of hTERT, are necessary but not sufficient for telomere maintenance because 
stabilized mTERT mutants cannot immortalize human cells. Thus, the TERT carboxy 
terminus contains sequences that regulate TERT protein levels and determinants 
that are required for productive action on telomere ends.
