Huntingtin has been reported to regulate the nuclear translocation of the 
transcriptional repressor RE1-silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive 
silencer factor (REST/NRSF). The REST/NRSF-interacting LIM domain protein (RILP) 
has also been shown to regulate REST/NRSF nuclear translocation. Therefore, we 
were prompted to address the question of how two distinct proteins could have 
the same function. We initially used a yeast two-hybrid screen to look for an 
interaction between huntingtin and RILP. This screen identified dynactin 
p150(Glued) as an interacting protein. Coimmunoprecipitation of proteins in 
vitro expressed in a reticulocyte lysate system showed an interaction between 
REST/NRSF and RILP as well as between RILP and dynactin p150(Glued). 
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis further showed a complex containing RILP, 
dynactin p150(Glued), and huntingtin. Huntingtin did not interact directly with 
either REST/NRSF or RILP, but did interact with dynactin p150(Glued). The 
N-terminal fragment of wild-type huntingtin did not affect the interaction 
between dynactin p150(Glued) and RILP; however, mutant huntingtin weakened this 
interaction. We further show that HAP1 (huntingtin-associated protein-1) 
prevents this complex from translocating REST/NRSF to the nucleus. Thus, this 
study suggests that REST/NRSF, dynactin p150(Glued), huntingtin, HAP1, and RILP 
form a complex involved in the translocation of REST/NRSF into the nucleus and 
that HAP1 controls REST/NRSF cellular localization in neurons.

Abstract

Huntingtin has been reported to regulate the nuclear translocation of the
 transcriptional repressor RE1-silencing transcription
 factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF). The
 REST/NRSF-interacting LIM domain protein (RILP) has also been shown to
 regulate REST/NRSF nuclear translocation. Therefore, we were prompted to
 address the question of how two distinct proteins could have the same
 function. We initially used a yeast two-hybrid screen to look for an
 interaction between huntingtin and RILP. This screen identified dynactin
 p150 Glued as an interacting protein. Coimmunoprecipitation of
 proteins in vitro expressed in a reticulocyte lysate system showed an
 interaction between REST/NRSF and RILP as well as between RILP and dynactin
 p150 Glued . Coimmunoprecipitation analysis further showed a complex
 containing RILP, dynactin p150 Glued , and huntingtin. Huntingtin did
 not interact directly with either REST/NRSF or RILP, but did interact with
 dynactin p150 Glued . The N-terminal fragment of wild-type huntingtin
 did not affect the interaction between dynactin p150 Glued and RILP;
 however, mutant huntingtin weakened this interaction. We further show that
 HAP1 ( h untingtin- a ssociated p rotein- 1 ) prevents this complex from translocating
 REST/NRSF to the nucleus. Thus, this study suggests that REST/NRSF, dynactin
 p150 Glued , huntingtin, HAP1, and RILP form a complex involved in
 the translocation of REST/NRSF into the nucleus and that HAP1 controls
 REST/NRSF cellular localization in neurons.

RESULTS

To elucidate the function of RILP and its relationship to huntingtin, we
 screened for interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system. A
 C-terminal RILP fragment (amino acids 391–831) was used as bait to
 screen a human brain MATCHMAKER cDNA library. As noted previously, the N
 terminus of RILP contains LIM domains, which are REST/NRSF-interacting
 domains, whereas the C-terminal domain is important for nuclear localization
 of RILP and REST/NRSF ( 16 , 18 ). This yeast two-hybrid
 screen yielded a single partial clone of dynactin p150 Glued . To
 further study the interaction between dynactin p150 Glued and RILP,
 a full-length cDNA of human dynactin p150 Glued was cloned into
 pCMVTag2, in which a FLAG epitope tag was added to the N terminus. The cDNA
 for RILP was cloned into pcDNA3.1-His, in which an N-terminal His tag was
 added. His-RILP and FLAG-dynactin p150 Glued were then coexpressed in vitro using the T n T coupled reticulocyte lysate system.
 An aliquot of the lysate was applied to Ni-NTA-agarose, washed, and eluted
 with 200 m m imidazole, with the fractions subjected to Western blot
 analysis using anti-FLAG or anti-His antibodies. As a result, both RILP and
 dynactin p150 Glued bound to Ni-NTA-agarose and were found in
 eluates ( Fig. 1 , E
 lanes ), suggesting that they directly interact.

Because the above data show that RILP interacts with dynactin
 p150 Glued , we further analyzed the physiological interaction of
 endogenous RILP, dynactin p150 Glued , and huntingtin. Lysates from
 HeLa cells were prepared and incubated with anti-RILP, anti-dynactin
 p150 Glued , or anti-huntingtin antibodies and pulled down with
 protein A/G. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates detected RILP,
 dynactin p150 Glued , and huntingtin in the same immunoprecipitate
 ( Fig. 2 ), indicating they form
 a complex.

Although it was reported that REST/NRSF interacts with both mutant
 huntingtin and wild-type huntingtin and that this interaction controls
 REST/NRSF function ( 8 ), a
 direct interaction was not demonstrated. To determine whether a direct
 interaction between wild-type or mutant huntingtin and REST/NRSF occurs, they
 were coexpressed in vitro . As shown in Fig. 3 a , in
 vitro expressed RILP and REST/NRSF were coimmunoprecipitated with
 anti-RILP or anti-REST/NRSF antibodies, confirming our previous results. RILP
 and dynactin p150 Glued were also coimmunoprecipitated with
 anti-RILP or anti-dynactin p150 Glued antibodies
 ( Fig. 3 a ), confirming
 a direct interaction between RILP and dynactin p150 Glued . In
 contrast, when we analyzed for an interaction between REST/NRSF and either
 wild-type or mutant huntingtin using in vitro translated proteins,
 they were not coimmunoprecipitated ( Fig.
 3 b ), showing that REST/NRSF and wild-type or mutant
 huntingtin do not interact directly.

We then looked for an interaction between huntingtin and RILP to which
 REST/NRSF could bind. Wild-type or mutant huntingtin and RILP were
 coexpressed, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-huntingtin or anti-RILP
 antibodies. As shown in Fig.
 4 a , neither wild-type nor mutant huntingtin interacted
 directly with RILP. However, when mutant or wild-type huntingtin and RILP were
 coexpressed in the presence of dynactin p150 Glued and
 immunoprecipitated with anti-huntingtin, anti-dynactin p150 Glued ,
 or anti-RILP antibodies, all three proteins were found
 ( Fig. 4 b ). These
 results show that mutant or wild-type huntingtin and RILP interact indirectly
 through dynactin p150 Glued . Comparing the intensities of bands, the
 interaction between RILP and mutant huntingtin appeared weaker than the
 interaction between RILP and wild-type huntingtin.

The endogenous RILP-dynactin p150 Glued -huntingtin complex was
 also found in differentiated NT2 cells, a neuron-like cell line that
 expresses, in addition, the neuron-specific huntingtin-associated protein HAP1
 ( 19 , 20 ). As shown in Fig. 5 a , HAP1 was
 coimmunoprecipitated with the endogenous complex from NT2 cells. To study
 direct interactions, wild-type or mutant huntingtin, dynactin
 p150 Glued , and RILP were expressed in vitro in the
 presence or absence of HAP1. After immunoprecipitation with anti-huntingtin or
 anti-RILP antibodies, Western blot analysis was conducted using
 anti-huntingtin or anti-RILP antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5 b , huntingtin
 was coimmunoprecipitated with RILP in the presence or absence of HAP1, but
 mutant huntingtin was precipitated only in the absence of HAP1
 ( Fig. 5 b , fourth and eighth lanes ). The ratio of band densities of
 huntingtin versus RILP were 3.15
 ( Fig. 5 b , seventh
 lane ) and 1.79 ( eighth lane ). Expression of mutant huntingtin
 caused a decrease of ∼50% in the interaction of RILP and wild-type
 huntingtin. This suggests that HAP1 affects the interaction between mutant
 huntingtin, dynactin p150 Glued , and RILP. In vitro translated HAP1 and REST/NRSF or HAP1 and RILP did not coimmunoprecipitate
 ( Fig. 5 c ), showing
 that neither REST/NRSF nor RILP interacts directly with HAP1.

To further analyze the effect of HAP1 on complex formation, mouse striatal
 cells expressing wild-type or mutant huntingtin were used for
 coimmunoprecipitation analysis. Lysates from each cell line were prepared and
 incubated with anti-RILP, anti-dynactin p150 Glued , anti-HAP1, or
 anti-huntingtin antibodies and pulled down with protein A/G. As shown in Fig. 6 ( upper panel ),
 Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates detected RILP, dynactin
 p150 Glued , HAP1, and huntingtin in the same immunoprecipitate,
 indicating they form a complex. In striatal cell lines expressing mutant
 huntingtin, most of the RILP did not coimmunoprecipitate with anti-dynactin
 p150 Glued , anti-HAP1, or anti-huntingtin antibodies, suggesting
 that mutant huntingtin causes a dissociation of RILP from the complex.

Because HAP1 is expressed predominantly in neuronal cells, it may play an
 important role in regulating the activity of the complex. The effect of HAP1
 on the translocation of REST/NRSF to the nucleus was thus studied using an
 RE1/NRSE-containing reporter gene. This reporter gene (pXP2-EX) is composed of
 the cholinergic gene locus RE1-containing promoter element linked to a
 luciferase reporter gene ( 14 ).
 As shown in Fig. 7 a ,
 expression of this pXP2-EX reporter gene was suppressed in HeLa cells, whereas
 the same construct in which the RE1 element was inactivated by mutation
 (pXP2-EX mut ) was not repressed. This confirms that in HeLa cells
 REST/NRSF localizes to the nucleus and binds to RE1/NRSE, leading to
 repression of RE1/NRSE-containing genes. Interestingly, overexpression of HAP1
 in HeLa cells led to a significant increase in pXP2-EX expression almost to
 the level of inactive pXP2-EX mut . This shows that, in the presence
 of HAP1, REST/NRSF is not functional and likely was not translocated to the
 nucleus. As expected, an siRNA for HAP1 did not change reporter gene
 expression in HeLa cells because these cells do not express HAP1. Similarly,
 overexpression of HAP1 in NT2 cells did not significantly change the
 expression of both pXP2-EX and pXP2-EX mut . However, lowering HAP1
 expression with an siRNA in NT2 cells led to repression of reporter gene
 expression ( Fig. 7 a ),
 consistent with the requirement for HAP1 to prevent REST/NRSF nuclear
 translocation.

To directly show the effect of HAP1 expression on the intracellular
 localization of REST/NRSF, expression or repression of HAP1 by siRNA was
 performed. HeLa or NT2 cells were treated with HAP1 siRNA or a HAP1 expression
 construct for 24 h, and then REST/NRSF was transfected into cells. The
 localization of REST/NRSF was determined by immunostaining with anti-REST/NRSF
 antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, whereas
 HAP1 was analyzed using anti-HAP1 antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 488-linked
 antibody. As shown in Fig. 8 ,
 in HeLa cells, REST/NRSF was detected in the nucleus. Expression of HAP1 in
 HeLa cells caused a shift of REST/NRSF and HAP1 to the cytosol. Used as a
 control, expression of HAP1 siRNA did not change REST/NRSF localization in
 HeLa cells. No cross-reactivity of anti-HAP1 and anti-REST/NRSF antibodies was
 determined. On the other hand, in NT2 cells, REST/NRSF was detected in the
 cytosol ( Fig. 8 , upper
 panels ). Expression of HAP1 was also detected in the cytosol. Repression
 of HAP1 in NT2 cells treated with siRNA caused REST/NRSF to mislocalize to the
 nucleus. HAP1 was barely detectable, indicating that siRNA treatment
 effectively lowers intracellular HAP1.

DISCUSSION

A new role for the huntingtin protein had been elucidated by showing its
 modulation of the nuclear translocation of the transcriptional repressor
 REST/NRSF ( 8 ). Loss of this
 activity in mutant huntingtin may contribute to disease pathogenesis in
 Huntington disease ( 21 ).
 However, a direct interaction between huntingtin and REST/NRSF was not shown,
 and the mechanism by which huntingtin controls REST/NRSF localization was
 unclear. We reported that RILP is also required for the translocation of
 REST/NRSF into the nucleus and controls neuronal gene expression
 ( 16 ). Thus, both RILP and
 huntingtin appear to have the same function. To elucidate the role of RILP, we
 identified dynactin p150 Glued as its interacting protein.
 Similarly, it was reported that dynactin p150 Glued and huntingtin
 interact ( 22 , 23 ). It was also suggested
 that REST/NRSF interacts with huntingtin, whereas mutant huntingtin causes
 abnormal neuronal REST/NRSF nuclear localization
 ( 8 ). We have employed
 coimmunoprecipitation analysis using HeLa cells to show that RILP, dynactin
 p150 Glued , and huntingtin interact and form a complex.

Using in vitro expression of these proteins, we have shown that
 huntingtin does not directly interact with REST/NRSF, but instead interacts
 with dynactin p150 Glued , which interacts in turn with RILP, a
 protein shown to directly interact with REST/NRSF. Thus, our data suggest that
 REST/NRSF, dynactin p150 Glued , huntingtin, and RILP form a
 quaternary complex involved in the translocation of REST/NRSF, likely through
 a microtubule pathway, into the nucleus.

In NT2 neuronal cells, we found that the complex additionally contains
 HAP1, consistent with reports that HAP1 interacts with dynactin
 p150 Glued and huntingtin
 ( 20 , 22 , 24 ). Our results further
 suggest that HAP1 affects the interaction of mutant huntingtin with the
 complex and leads to a weakening of the interaction of RILP with the complex.
 However, HAP1 does not affect this interaction in the presence of wild-type
 huntingtin.

This study further suggests that mutant polyQ-huntingtin binding to the
 REST/NRSF-RILP-dynactin-HAP1 complex alters its conformation, permitting
 REST/NRSF to inappropriately be transported to the nucleus, resulting in the
 repression of a host of neuronal genes. To support this hypothesis, we used
 mouse striatal cell lines established from wild-type and mutant huntingtin
 knock-in embryos ( 25 ). Gel
 filtration of extracts from these cells showed that RILP in the cell line
 expressing wild-type huntingtin is detected in a high molecular weight
 fraction indicative of a complex with dynactin p150 Glued ,
 huntingtin, and RILP. However, in mutant huntingtin-expressing cells, the
 majority of RILP is detected in a lower molecular weight fraction than found
 in wild-type huntingtin-expressing
 cells. 3 This is
 consistent with the data in this study showing that HAP1 affected the
 interaction between mutant huntingtin, dynactin p150 Glued , and RILP
 in the complex and caused release of RILP from the complex.

Reporter gene analysis showed that when HAP1 is overexpressed in a
 non-neuronal cell line such as HeLa, REST/NRSF gene repression is reversed.
 Conversely, lowering HAP1 expression in a neuronal cell such as NT2 leads to
 REST/NRSF repression of an RE1/NRSE-containing gene. In accordance with these
 data, our results clearly show that in non-neuronal cells, which do not
 express HAP1, REST/NRSF localizes to the nucleus. However, REST/NRSF localizes
 to the cytosol when HAP1 is overexpressed. In NT2 neuronal cells, REST/NRSF
 localizes normally to the cytosol. Repression of HAP1 causes REST/NRSF to
 abnormally localize to the nucleus. These results show that HAP1, likely
 through its interaction with the RILP-dynactin-huntingtin complex, prevents
 the complex from translocating REST/NRSF to the nucleus, making HAP1 a key
 regulator of REST/NRSF activity.

Thus, the paradox of how both RILP and huntingtin affect REST/NRSF
 trafficking to the nucleus appears to be answered. This study, coupled with
 others, shows that both RILP and huntingtin interact directly with dynactin
 p150 Glued to form a complex. REST/NRSF binds to this complex
 through a direct interaction with RILP. In the absence of HAP1, as in
 non-neuronal cells, this complex traffics REST/NRSF to the nucleus. In
 neuronal cells, HAP1 binds to huntingtin and causes the retention of the
 complex in the cytosol. There are undoubtedly other proteins involved in this
 process, which can now be sought. Finally, this study has described a
 previously unidentified trafficking complex; provided new insights into the
 roles of huntingtin, HAP1, dynactin p150 Glued , and RILP in the
 regulation of neuron-specific gene expression by controlling REST/NRSF
 trafficking; and suggested a new target for Huntington disease.
