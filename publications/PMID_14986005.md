Immunoreactivity of the Na+-D-glucose cotransporter SGLT1 was demonstrated in 
intracerebral capillaries of rat and pig. Immunostaining suggested that SGLT1 is 
located in the luminal membrane of the endothelial cells and in intracellular 
vesicles. Using in situ hybridization, SGLT1 mRNA was not detectable in 
intracerebral capillaries of non-treated or sham-operated Wistar rats. However, 
1 day after a transient occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery, SGLT1 
mRNA was detected in capillaries of both brain hemispheres. Expression of SGLT1 
was also demonstrated in primary cultures of capillary endothelial cells from 
pig using polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription and western 
blotting. The data suggest that SGLT1 participates in transport of D-glucose 
across the blood-brain barrier and is upregulated after brain ischemia and 
reperfusion.
