Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a serine/threonine 
protein kinase critically involved in synaptic plasticity in the brain. It is 
highly concentrated in the postsynaptic density fraction, exceeding the amount 
of any other signal transduction molecules. Because kinase signaling can be 
amplified by catalytic reaction, why CaMKII exists in such a large quantity has 
been a mystery. Here, we provide biochemical evidence that CaMKII is capable of 
bundling F-actin through a stoichiometric interaction. Consistent with this 
evidence, in hippocampal neurons, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of CaMKII leads 
to a reduction in the volume of dendritic spine head that is mediated by F-actin 
dynamics. An overexpression of CaMKII slowed down the actin turnover in the 
spine head. This activity was associated with beta subunit of CaMKII in a manner 
requiring its actin-binding and association domains but not the kinase domain. 
This finding indicates that CaMKII serves as a central signaling molecule in 
both functional and structural changes during synaptic plasticity.

Abstract

Ca 2+ -calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a serine/threonine protein kinase critically involved in synaptic plasticity in the brain. It is highly concentrated in the postsynaptic density fraction, exceeding the amount of any other signal transduction molecules. Because kinase signaling can be amplified by catalytic reaction, why CaMKII exists in such a large quantity has been a mystery. Here, we provide biochemical evidence that CaMKII is capable of bundling F-actin through a stoichiometric interaction. Consistent with this evidence, in hippocampal neurons, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of CaMKII leads to a reduction in the volume of dendritic spine head that is mediated by F-actin dynamics. An overexpression of CaMKII slowed down the actin turnover in the spine head. This activity was associated with β subunit of CaMKII in a manner requiring its actin-binding and association domains but not the kinase domain. This finding indicates that CaMKII serves as a central signaling molecule in both functional and structural changes during synaptic plasticity.

Discussion

We describe here a role for CaMKII as a structural protein bundling F-actin. This requires the presence of the β subunit in the CaMKII oligomer but not kinase activity itself. This feature of CaMKII is necessary for maintaining the dendritic spine structure. Not only that, when kinase is activated, CaMKII looses the ability to bundle F-actin. Both binding with Ca 2+ /calmodulin and autophosphorylation of CaMKII contribute to this event. It has been speculated that CaMKII might have a structural role because of its abundance in the postsynaptic density ( 2 , 14 ); our report demonstrates a specific structural role for CaMKII as an F-actin-bundling protein necessary for maintenance of postsynaptic structure.

Previous reports indicate that the overexpression of CaMKIIβ but not α in neurons in dissociated culture increases filopodia motility, dendritic arborization, and spine density ( 27 , 28 ). These effects were abolished by blocking kinase activity with a point mutation or a kinase inhibitor. Whereas it is possible that the precise location of kinase activity is important for these effects ( 27 ), it is also possible that the bundling of F-actin and its dynamic regulation by a mechanism involving kinase activity may be important.

CaMKII accumulates on the dendritic spine upon neuronal stimulation ( 19 , 20 , 29 – 31 ). Because CaMKIIα does not bundle F-actin but still shows activity dependent accumulation, the accumulation is independent of F-actin binding ( 19 ). Instead, self-association of CaMKII ( 20 , 30 ) or binding with the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptors ( 31 ), densin-180 ( 32 , 33 ), and/or α-actinin ( 32 – 34 ) may play a role in such activity-dependent synaptic delivery of CaMKII.

In view of these results, we suggest the following model for the role of CaMKII in structural plasticity ( Fig. 6 ). At resting synapses, F-actin is bundled by CaMKII, thereby maintaining a stable structure. When CaMKII is activated by neuronal activity and the resultant Ca 2+ influx, it detaches from F-actin and allows its reorganization by other signal transduction machineries, such as small G proteins. Meanwhile, more CaMKII are recruited to the synapse by self-association or interaction of NR2B to play a role as a signal transduction molecule. Such mechanism may also set a new level for the amount of CaMKII at dendritic spines, which may in turn affect the amount of bundled F-actin in the spines, and consequently the structure of the dendritic spines. Upon returning to the unphosphorylated state, CaMKII bundles the newly reorganized F-actin and maintains the remodeled spine structure. In this way, CaMKII may have a serve as a “gating” mechanism that keeps dendritic spine structure constant at resting Ca 2+ levels, allowing modification when the Ca 2+ level increases, and subsequently preserving the plastic change. Duration of activated CaMKII gives a time-window during which actin can be remodeled. Consistent with this view, the structural plasticity of dendritic spines requires CaMKII activation ( 13 ). In this way, CaMKII plays a dual role in excitatory synaptic plasticity: a signaling role during neuronal activity, and an actin-bundling role during the basal state in dendritic spines, thereby affecting both functional and structural plasticity of dendritic spines
