The amyloid protein, Abeta, which accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer 
patients, is derived by proteolysis of the amyloid protein precursor (APP). APP 
can undergo endoproteolytic processing at three sites, one at the amino terminus 
of the Abeta domain (beta-cleavage), one within the Abeta domain 
(alpha-cleavage), and one at the carboxyl terminus of the Abeta domain 
(gamma-cleavage). The enzymes responsible for these activities have not been 
unambiguously identified. By the use of gene disruption (knockout), we now 
demonstrate that TACE (tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme), a member 
of the ADAM family (a disintegrin and metalloprotease-family) of proteases, 
plays a central role in regulated alpha-cleavage of APP. Our data suggest that 
TACE may be the alpha-secretase responsible for the majority of regulated 
alpha-cleavage in cultured cells. Furthermore, we show that inhibiting this 
enzyme affects both APP secretion and Abeta formation in cultured cells.
