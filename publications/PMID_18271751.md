The yeast Tsa1 peroxiredoxin, like other 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, has dual 
activities as a peroxidase and as a molecular chaperone. Its peroxidase function 
predominates in lower-molecular-mass forms, whereas a super-chaperone form 
predominates in high-molecular-mass complexes. Loss of TSA1 results in 
aggregation of ribosomal proteins, indicating that Tsa1 functions to maintain 
the integrity of the translation apparatus. In the present study we report that 
Tsa1 functions as an antioxidant on actively translating ribosomes. Its 
peroxidase activity is required for ribosomal function, since mutation of the 
peroxidatic cysteine residue, which inactivates peroxidase but not chaperone 
activity, results in sensitivity to translation inhibitors. The peroxidatic 
cysteine residue is also required for a shift from ribosomes to its 
high-molecular-mass form in response to peroxide stress. Thus Tsa1 appears to 
function predominantly as an antioxidant in protecting both the cytosol and 
actively translating ribosomes against endogenous ROS (reactive oxygen species), 
but shifts towards its chaperone function in response to oxidative stress 
conditions. Analysis of the distribution of Tsa1 in thioredoxin system mutants 
revealed that the ribosome-associated form of Tsa1 is increased in mutants 
lacking thioredoxin reductase (trr1) and thioredoxins (trx1 trx2) in parallel 
with the general increase in total Tsa1 levels which is observed in these 
mutants. In the present study we show that deregulation of Tsa1 in the trr1 
mutant specifically promotes translation defects including hypersensitivity to 
translation inhibitors, increased translational error-rates and ribosomal 
protein aggregation. These results have important implications for the role of 
peroxiredoxins in stress and growth control, since peroxiredoxins are likely to 
be deregulated in a similar manner during many different disease states.
