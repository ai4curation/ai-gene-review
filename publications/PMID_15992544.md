Impaired translocation of the glucose transporter isoform 4 (Glut4) to the 
plasma membrane in fat and skeletal muscle cells may represent a primary defect 
in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Glut4 is localized in 
specialized storage vesicles (GSVs), the biological nature and biogenesis of 
which are not known. Here, we report that GSVs are formed in differentiating 
3T3-L1 adipocytes upon induction of sortilin on day 2 of differentiation. Forced 
expression of Glut4 prior to induction of sortilin leads to rapid degradation of 
the transporter, whereas overexpression of sortilin increases formation of GSVs 
and stimulates insulin-regulated glucose uptake. Knockdown of sortilin decreases 
both formation of GSVs and insulin-regulated glucose uptake. Finally, we have 
reconstituted functional GSVs in undifferentiated cells by double transfection 
of Glut4 and sortilin. Thus, sortilin is not only essential, but also sufficient 
for biogenesis of GSVs and acquisition of insulin responsiveness in adipose 
cells.
