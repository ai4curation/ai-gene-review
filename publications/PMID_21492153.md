The human intestinal cell line Caco-2 is a well-established model system to 
study cellular differentiation of human enterocytes of intestinal origin, 
because these cells have the capability to differentiate spontaneously into 
polarized cells with morphological and biochemical features of small intestinal 
enterocytes. Therefore, the cells are widely used as an in vitro model for the 
human intestinal barrier. In this study, a proteomic approach was used to 
identify the molecular marker of intestinal cellular differentiation. The 
proteome of proliferating Caco-2 cells was compared with that of fully 
differentiated cells. Two-dimensional gel analysis yielded 53 proteins that were 
differently regulated during the differentiation process. Pathway analysis 
conducted with those 34 proteins that were identified by matrix-assisted laser 
desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis revealed subsets of 
proteins with common molecular and cellular function. It was shown that proteins 
involved in xenobiotic and drug metabolism as well as in lipid metabolism were 
upregulated upon cellular differentiation. In parallel, proteins associated with 
proliferation, cell growth and cancer were downregulated, reflecting the loss of 
the tumorigenic phenotype of the cells. Thus, the proteomic approach in 
combination with a literature-based pathway analysis yielded valuable 
information about the differentiation process of Caco-2 cells on the molecular 
level that contributes to the understanding of the development of colon cancer 
or inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis--diseases associated with an 
imbalanced differentiation process of intestinal cells.
