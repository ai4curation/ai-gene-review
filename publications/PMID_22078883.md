The transport of Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) to various organelles has emerged as 
an essential means by which innate immunity is regulated. While most of our 
knowledge is restricted to regulators that promote the transport of newly 
synthesized receptors, the regulators that control TLR transport after microbial 
detection remain unknown. Here, we report that the plasma membrane localized 
Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) CD14 is required for the microbe-induced 
endocytosis of TLR4. In dendritic cells, this CD14-dependent endocytosis pathway 
is upregulated upon exposure to inflammatory mediators. We identify the tyrosine 
kinase Syk and its downstream effector PLCγ2 as important regulators of TLR4 
endocytosis and signaling. These data establish that upon microbial detection, 
an upstream PRR (CD14) controls the trafficking and signaling functions of a 
downstream PRR (TLR4). This innate immune trafficking cascade illustrates how 
pathogen detection systems operate to induce both membrane transport and signal 
transduction.

Introduction

The endocytosis of immunity-related receptors has emerged as a critical control step in the signal transduction process. The first receptors activated during any host-pathogen interaction are members of the Toll-like Receptor (TLR) family, which are responsible for detecting microbial products and inducing innate and adaptive immunity ( Akira and Takeda, 2004 ). Different TLR family members are found in different subcellular compartments, ranging from the plasma membrane to early, late and recycling endosomes ( Barton and Kagan, 2009 ). While it was believed originally that the endocytosis of plasma membrane-localized TLRs downregulates their signaling functions after a microbial encounter ( Husebye et al., 2006 ; Latz et al., 2003 ), new evidence indicates that receptor delivery to endosomes also activates specific signal transduction pathways ( Kagan et al., 2008 ; Tanimura et al., 2008 ).

Virtually all of our knowledge of TLR transport is limited to regulators that promote the folding or transport of newly synthesized receptors ( e.g. GP96, PRAT4a, UNC93B1) ( Kim et al., 2008 ; Takahashi et al., 2007 ; Yang et al., 2007 ). In the absence of each of these regulators, specific sets of TLRs cannot exit the endoplasmic reticulum after translation and, consequently, TLR ligands present in the extracellular and endosomal spaces are not detected. Unlike the emerging knowledge on the trafficking of newly synthesized receptors, almost nothing is known about the regulators that control TLR endocytosis or transport after microbial detection. Filling this gap in our knowledge is of fundamental importance, as microbe-induced receptor transport is a critical control step in the TLR-mediated signal transduction.

The first-described example of microbe-induced TLR transport came from studies of the LPS receptor TLR4, which induces distinct signaling pathways from two different organelles ( Kagan et al., 2008 ; Tanimura et al., 2008 ). The first signaling pathway is activated from the plasma membrane after TLR4 encounters LPS ( Latz et al., 2003 ). This pathway is mediated by a pair of sorting and signaling adaptor proteins called TIRAP and MyD88, respectively ( Kagan and Medzhitov, 2006 ). These adaptors induce pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by linking TLR4 to downstream enzymes that activate NF-κB and AP-1 ( Akira and Takeda, 2004 ). TLR4 is then internalized into the endosomal network where the second signaling pathway is triggered through the adaptors TRAM and TRIF ( Kagan et al., 2008 ; Tanimura et al., 2008 ). These adaptors mediate the activation of the transcription factor Interferon Regulatory Factor-3 (IRF3), which regulates Type I Interferon (IFN) expression ( Akira and Takeda, 2004 ). Thus, in the case of TLR4, the LPS-induced endocytosis of the receptor is essential for its signaling functions. While the general endocytic machinery is undoubtedly involved in internalization of plasma membrane-localized TLRs, there are no known membrane proteins that regulate TLR endocytosis specifically upon microbial recognition.

In considering this problem, we reasoned that since TRIF-mediated IFN expression requires TLR4 endocytosis, cell surface proteins that control endosomal signaling may do so by regulating TLR4 entry into the cell. One such regulator is CD14. CD14 is a GPI-linked protein that is found on the surface of many (but not all) TLR4 expressing cells ( Wright et al., 1990 ). CD14 was the first identified Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) that binds directly to LPS ( Wright et al., 1990 ), and is known to chaperone LPS molecules to the TLR4-MD-2 signaling complex ( da Silva Correia et al., 2001 ; Gioannini et al., 2004 ; Moore et al., 2000 ). Notably, while CD14 is marginally important for MyD88-dependent TNFα expression, it is essential for TRIF-mediated IFN expression ( Jiang et al., 2005 ). Thus, we hypothesized that CD14 specifically regulates TRIF-mediated IFN expression because it regulates TLR4 endocytosis.

Discussion

The role of endocytosis in TLR signaling has attracted much attention in recent years. Despite its importance, the only known regulators of TLR endocytosis are dynamins, clathrin and their associated proteins ( Husebye et al., 2006 ; Kagan et al., 2008 ). While these regulators control many general endocytic processes, they cannot provide insight into the specific means by which microbial products can induce TLRs to enter mammalian cells. Our discovery that the LPS-binding protein CD14 is a regulator of TLR4 endocytosis therefore fills an important gap in our knowledge of how microbial binding can be coordinated with TLR endocytosis.

CD14 was identified originally as being important for MyD88-dependent signal transduction ( Moore et al., 2000 ; Wright et al., 1990 ). As many others have reported, we have found that CD14 is only necessary for MyD88-dependent signaling at low concentrations of LPS, an observation that is likely explained by the function of this PRR in transporting LPS to the TLR4-MD-2 complex ( da Silva Correia et al., 2001 ; Gioannini et al., 2004 ). The LPS-transport and TLR4-transport functions of CD14 can be distinguished by the means by which we can bypass their requirement in TLR4 signaling. For example, while the defects in MyD88-dependent TNFα expression can be rescued by increasing the concentration of LPS, the defects in TLR4 endocytosis and TRIF signaling cannot. These data clearly distinguish the two roles of CD14, one in transporting LPS to the receptor (which can be overcome by increasing LPS dose) and one in transporting the receptor into the cell (which can be overcome by forcing the receptor into phagosomes of DCs). Taken together these data suggest that CD14 initiates a cascade of trafficking events ( Figure 7D ). This cascade begins with CD14 transporting LPS to TLR4, and culminates with CD14 delivering TLR4 to the endosomal signaling machinery that is needed to induce IFN expression ( Figure 7D ). This “innate immune trafficking cascade” may also apply to other non-signaling PRRs that function to deliver microbial ligands to downstream PRRs with signaling capabilities. Since CD36 and the Mannose Binding Lectin are thought to serve analogous functions to CD14 for TLR2 ( Hoebe et al., 2005 ; Ip et al., 2009 ), this suggestion may explain why CD14 is not required for TLR2-mediated IFN expression.

CD14 is not only required for TLR4 endocytosis in naïve antigen presenting cells, but also in mature DCs. When compared to immature DCs, mature DCs exhibited an enhanced capacity to internalize TLR4 and induce the expression of TRIF-dependent genes. All of these activities were dependent on CD14, and were observed in DCs matured with either self-encoded or microbial ligands. These data suggest that CD14-dependent endocytosis is broadly important for the functions of both immature and mature DCs. In addition, our data reveal that mature DCs retain the ability to sense and respond to microbial encounters. CD14 has recently been implicated in regulating the differentiation of monocyte-derived DCs (Mo-DCs) upon encountering LPS (Cheong et al.). Once differentiated, Mo-DCs express high levels of CD14 and are potent antigen presenting cells. Thus, a trend is emerging whereby mature DCs exhibit higher levels of CD14 expression than their immature counterparts, and we suspect that the function of this activity is to enhance the ability of Mo-DCs to induce of T-cell differentiation.

For many years, TLR4 has been considered the sole mediator of CD14-dependent responses because all well-studied activities of LPS were dependent on TLR4 and its signaling adaptors. Thus, after delivery of LPS to TLR4, it is thought that the function of CD14 is complete and TLR4 can then act independently of any extracellular factors to promote MyD88 and TRIF signaling. Our discovery that TLR4 actually depends on CD14 for its own endocytosis represents a significant shift in our understanding of the hierarchy of PRRs that regulate responses to endotoxin. Since TLR4 is cargo for a CD14-dependent endocytic pathway, we propose that TLR4 is not the “king” of all LPS responses. Rather TLR4 is subservient to CD14 and must rely on this upstream PRR to not only receive its ligand (LPS) but also to be delivered to endosomes where TRIF-mediated signaling can occur. Thus, CD14 sits at the apex of all cellular responses to LPS and functions to induce an innate immune trafficking cascade that involves the transport of both TLR4 and its ligand LPS.

The endocytic pathway activated by CD14 appears to be ITAM-mediated, and requires Syk and its downstream effector PLCγ2. Evidence in support of this claim comes from observations that inhibition of either Syk or PLCγ2 largely phenocopy CD14-deficiency. Moreover, our finding that CD14 is necessary for Syk-activation in response to LPS provides a direct biochemical link between CD14 and this kinase. It is possible that conditions exist whereby alternative pathways would play a role in promoting the delivery of TLR4 to endosomes, where TRIF signaling can occur. In this regard, we would like to emphasize that our use of the term endosomes does not exclude a possibility that TLR4 signaling may also occur from macropinosomes, which can be formed upon LPS treatment and are likely important in promoting the capture of microbial products. However, since TRIF signaling can occur from at least two distinct endosomal vesicles (endosomes and phagosomes), it is unlikely that TRIF signaling would be restricted to macropinosomes or any specific type of endosome. Rather, we suggest that the TLR4 network is designed such that any means of generating a TLR4 containing endosomal vesicle is sufficient to induce TRIF signaling. The possible number of different means by which TLR4 can be delivered into endosomes is difficult to predict, as evidenced by our unexpected finding that even when using a common means of internalization (phagocytosis), BMDM and DCs differ in their ability allow TLR4 and FcγR1 to enter phagosomes. Despite this possibility of endocytic heterogeneity, the fact that the CD14-PLCγ2-Syk pathway is activated specifically by LPS suggests that this pathway represents the primary means of promoting TLR4 internalization and signaling in cell types as diverse a phagocytes and fibroblasts.

From an evolutionary perspective, our identification of Syk and PLCγ2 as regulators of LPS-induced endocytosis draws similarities to other immunity-related endocytosis receptors that also depend on these factors, such as Dectin-1 and FcγR1 ( Crowley et al., 1997 ; Rogers et al., 2005 ; Underhill et al., 2005 ). A unifying theme that could link these observations is the idea of an “inflammatory endocytosis pathway” that is mediated by Syk/PLCγ2 and can be engaged by diverse upstream receptors. Our work provides a mandate to consider the role of this potential inflammatory endocytosis pathway in diverse pathogenic interactions.
