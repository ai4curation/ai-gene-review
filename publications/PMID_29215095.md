Homozygosity for a nonsense variant in AIMP2 is associated with a progressive 
neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, seizures, and spastic 
quadriparesis.

We ascertained two unrelated consanguineous families with two affected children 
each having microcephaly, refractory seizures, intellectual disability, and 
spastic quadriparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed atrophy of cerebrum, 
cerebellum and spinal cord, prominent cisterna magna, symmetric T2 
hypo-intensities in the bilateral basal ganglia and thinning of corpus callosum. 
Whole-exome sequencing of three affected individuals revealed c.105C>A 
[p.(Tyr35Ter)] variant in AIMP2. The variant lies in a common homozygous region 
of 940 kb on chromosome 7 and is likely to have been inherited from a common 
ancestor. The phenotype noted in our subjects' shares marked similarity with 
that of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-3 caused by mutations in closely related 
gene AIMP1. We hereby report the first human disease associated with deleterious 
mutations in AIMP2.
