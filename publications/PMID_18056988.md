It has recently been realized that animal cryptochromes (CRYs) fall into two 
broad groups. Type 1 CRYs, the prototype of which is the Drosophila CRY, that is 
known to be a circadian photoreceptor. Type 2 CRYs, the prototypes of which are 
human CRY 1 and CRY 2, are known to function as core clock proteins. The 
mechanism of photosignaling by the Type 1 CRYs is not well understood. We 
recently reported that the flavin cofactor of the Type 1 CRY of the monarch 
butterfly may be in the form of flavin anion radical, FAD(*-), in vivo. Here we 
describe the purification and characterization of wild-type and mutant forms of 
Type 1 CRYs from fruit fly, butterfly, mosquito, and silk moth. Cryptochromes 
from all four sources contain FAD(ox) when purified, and the flavin is readily 
reduced to FAD(*-) by light. Interestingly, mutations that block photoreduction 
in vitro do not affect the photoreceptor activities of these CRYs, but mutations 
that reduce the stability of FAD(*-) in vitro abolish the photoreceptor function 
of Type 1 CRYs in vivo. Collectively, our data provide strong evidence for 
functional similarities of Type 1 CRYs across insect species and further support 
the proposal that FAD(*-) represents the ground state and not the excited state 
of the flavin cofactor in Type 1 CRYs.
