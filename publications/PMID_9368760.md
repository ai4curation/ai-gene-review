BACKGROUND: The activation of protein kinase B (PKB, also known as c-Akt) is 
stimulated by insulin or growth factors and results from its phosphorylation at 
Thr308 and Ser473. We recently identified a protein kinase, termed PDK1, that 
phosphorylates PKB at Thr308 only in the presence of lipid vesicles containing 
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3) or 
phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (Ptdlns(3,4)P2).
RESULTS: We have cloned and sequenced human PDK1. The 556-residue monomeric 
enzyme comprises a catalytic domain that is most similar to the PKA, PKB and PKC 
subfamily of protein kinases and a carboxy-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) 
domain. The PDK1 gene is located on human chromosome 16p13.3 and is expressed 
ubiquitously in human tissues. Human PDK1 is homologous to the Drosophila 
protein kinase DSTPK61, which has been implicated in the regulation of sex 
differentiation, oogenesis and spermatogenesis. Expressed PDK1 and DSTPK61 
phosphorylated Thr308 of PKB alpha only in the presence of Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3 or 
Ptdlns(3,4)P2. Overexpression of PDK1 in 293 cells activated PKB alpha and 
potentiated the IGF1-induced phosphorylation of PKB alpha at Thr308. Experiments 
in which the PH domains of either PDK1 or PKB alpha were deleted indicated that 
the binding of Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3 or Ptdlns(3,4)P2 to PKB alpha is required for 
phosphorylation and activation by PDK1. IGF1 stimulation of 293 cells did not 
affect the activity or phosphorylation of PDK1.
CONCLUSIONS: PDK1 is likely to mediate the activation of PKB by insulin or 
growth factors. DSTPK61 is a Drosophila homologue of PDK1. The effect of 
Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3/Ptdlns(3,4)P2 in the activation of PKB alpha is at least partly 
substrate directed.
