Extending axons in the developing nervous system are guided in part by repulsive 
cues. Genetic analysis in Drosophila, reported in a companion to this paper, 
identifies the Slit protein as a candidate ligand for the repulsive guidance 
receptor Roundabout (Robo). Here we describe the characterization of three 
mammalian Slit homologs and show that the Drosophila Slit protein and at least 
one of the mammalian Slit proteins, Slit2, are proteolytically processed and 
show specific, high-affinity binding to Robo proteins. Furthermore, recombinant 
Slit2 can repel embryonic spinal motor axons in cell culture. These results 
support the hypothesis that Slit proteins have an evolutionarily conserved role 
in axon guidance as repulsive ligands for Robo receptors.
