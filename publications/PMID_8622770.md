Transcriptional silencing of the HM mating-type loci in the yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae is caused by the localized formation of an altered chromatin 
structure, analogous to heterochromatin in higher eukaryotes. Silencing depends 
on cis-acting sequences, termed silencers, as well as several trans-acting 
factors, including histones H4 and H3, proteins RAP1 and ABF1, and the four SIR 
proteins (SIR1-4). Each of the four HM silencers contains an autonomously 
replicating sequence (ARS) to which the origin replication complex (ORC) binds. 
This six-protein complex is required for initiation of DNA replication, as well 
as for silencing. Efficient establishment of the silenced state requires both 
passage through the S phase of the cell cycle and SIR1 protein. Previous 
experiments suggested that SIR1 might be localized to the silencers by binding 
to ORC and/or RAP1. Here we report that SIR1 can bind directly to ORC1, the 
largest of the ORC subunits, and that targeting of SIR1 to ORC1 at a silencer is 
sufficient to establish a silenced state.
