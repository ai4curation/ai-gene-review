Temperature compensation contributes to the accuracy of biological timing by 
preventing circadian rhythms from running more quickly at high than at low 
temperatures. We previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) with 
temperature-specific effects on the circadian rhythm of leaf movement, including 
a QTL linked to the transcription factor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). We have now 
analyzed FLC alleles in near-isogenic lines and induced mutants to eliminate 
other candidate genes. We showed that FLC lengthened the circadian period 
specifically at 27 degrees C, contributing to temperature compensation of the 
circadian clock. Known upstream regulators of FLC expression in flowering time 
pathways similarly controlled its circadian effect. We sought to identify 
downstream targets of FLC regulation in the molecular mechanism of the circadian 
clock using genome-wide analysis to identify FLC-responsive genes and 3503 
transcripts controlled by the circadian clock. A Bayesian clustering method 
based on Fourier coefficients allowed us to discriminate putative regulatory 
genes. Among rhythmic FLC-responsive genes, transcripts of the transcription 
factor LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX) correlated in peak abundance with the circadian 
period in flc mutants. Mathematical modeling indicated that the modest change in 
peak LUX RNA abundance was sufficient to cause the period change due to FLC, 
providing a molecular target for the crosstalk between flowering time pathways 
and circadian regulation.

Abstract

Temperature compensation contributes to the accuracy of biological timing by preventing circadian rhythms from running more quickly at high than at low temperatures. We previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) with temperature-specific effects on the circadian rhythm of leaf movement, including a QTL linked to the transcription factor FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ). We have now analyzed FLC alleles in near-isogenic lines and induced mutants to eliminate other candidate genes. We showed that FLC lengthened the circadian period specifically at 27°C, contributing to temperature compensation of the circadian clock. Known upstream regulators of FLC expression in flowering time pathways similarly controlled its circadian effect. We sought to identify downstream targets of FLC regulation in the molecular mechanism of the circadian clock using genome-wide analysis to identify FLC -responsive genes and 3503 transcripts controlled by the circadian clock. A Bayesian clustering method based on Fourier coefficients allowed us to discriminate putative regulatory genes. Among rhythmic FLC -responsive genes, transcripts of the transcription factor LUX ARRHYTHMO ( LUX ) correlated in peak abundance with the circadian period in flc mutants. Mathematical modeling indicated that the modest change in peak LUX RNA abundance was sufficient to cause the period change due to FLC , providing a molecular target for the crosstalk between flowering time pathways and circadian regulation.

INTRODUCTION

Circadian clocks provide organisms with a means of temporally organizing their daily metabolic and physiological activities relative to the day/night cycle. Such organization is believed to impart a selective advantage ( Ouyang et al., 1998 ; Dodd et al., 2005 ). Nearly all eukaryotes and some prokaryotes possess circadian clocks, and comparison between diverse model species shows that although their components and construction are varied, they do share a unified set of defining properties: all circadian clocks are self-sustaining, entrainable, and temperature compensated ( Pittendrigh, 1960 ). Transcription-translation feedback loops involving multiple positive and negative interacting components are important in the clock mechanisms of these model species (reviewed in Young and Kay, 2001 ). The Arabidopsis thaliana clock is putatively based on the feedback loop involving the genes TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 ( TOC1 ), CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 ( CCA1 ), and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL ( LHY ), where TOC1 induces the transcription of LHY and CCA1 , which are translated into proteins that feed back to repress the expression of TOC1 ( Alabadi et al., 2001 ). Modeling of this clock suggested that it was insufficient to explain the experimental data ( Locke et al., 2005a ). As a result, Locke et al. (2005b) added two further components to the model: a gene X , which lies between TOC1 and LHY / CCA1 , and a gene Y , which forms a coupled loop and is likely to correspond to the evening-expressed gene GIGANTEA ( GI ).

Temperature compensation, a defining feature of circadian rhythms, results in the period of the clock changing very little when measured over a broad range of constant temperatures ( Pittendrigh, 1954 ; Rensing and Ruoff, 2002 ). Natural genetic variation in the Drosophila melanogaster central clock gene period was shown to affect the temperature compensation of the fly clock ( Sawyer et al., 1997 ). Analysis of circadian period in Arabidopsis accessions revealed natural genetic variation in the temperature compensation of the plant clock ( Edwards et al., 2005 ). This variation was used to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for circadian period in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between the accessions Landsberg erecta (L er ) and Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) ( Edwards et al., 2005 ).

FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ) was suggested as a candidate for the period QTL PerCv5b , mapped on the upper arm of chromosome 5 ( Edwards et al., 2005 ). FLC is a MADS box transcription factor that inhibits the transition to flowering by repressing the expression of the floral integrators AGAMOUS LIKE20 ( AGL20 ) and FLOWERING LOCUS T ( Samach et al., 2000 ; Michaels et al., 2005 ). Prolonged cold treatment, such as a winter, represses the expression of FLC in a process called vernalization, allowing plants to flower in the subsequent warmer conditions (reviewed in Bastow et al., 2004 ; Sung and Amasino, 2004 ). FLC is also regulated by a suite of autonomous pathway genes, including FRIGIDA ( FRI ), LUMINIDEPENDENS ( LD ), and FLOWERING LOCUS D ( FLD ; Michaels and Amasino, 1999 ; He et al., 2003 ).The L er allele of flc was shown to be weakly expressed as the result of a transposable element within the first intron of the gene ( Gazzani et al., 2003 ), making it a strong candidate for a QTL in the Cvi crossed with L er RILs. Indeed, Swarup et al. (1999) previously identified a circadian period QTL (named ANDANTE ) linked to FLC and showed a slight (∼0.8 h) short circadian period phenotype in flc mutant seedlings, indicating that FLC could also affect the circadian clock. The molecular target of FLC function was unknown.

Microarray assays have enabled the large-scale identification of transcripts regulated by the circadian clock in Arabidopsis , Drosophila , and mouse ( Harmer et al., 2000 ; Ceriani et al., 2002 ; Panda et al., 2002 ). Identifying rhythmic patterns in the short time courses and sparse samples typical of circadian array data has been challenging; a number of approaches have been adopted for different experimental designs ( Akhtar et al., 2002 ; Langmead et al., 2002 ; Straume, 2004 ). Harmer et al. (2000) suggested that ∼6% of the Arabidopsis genome was regulated by the circadian clock. Clustering the rhythmic expression patterns using the time of the peak allowed the identification of an overrepresented regulatory sequence (the evening element) and of functional relationships among some coexpressed genes, though this study tested only ∼8000 genes ( Harmer et al., 2000 ).

We now pursue the analysis of the PerCv5b QTL, using near-isogenic lines (NILs) and mutants to identify natural variation at FLC as the cause of the 27°C-specific QTL effect on circadian period. Using genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, we identify the likely mechanism by which FLC alters the period of the circadian clock at this higher temperature. Our results illustrate the benefits of functional genomics approaches, combined with dedicated data analysis methods and mathematical modeling, in understanding the quantitative molecular mechanisms downstream of a QTL of moderate effect.

DISCUSSION

FLC 's involvement in the circadian clock was first suggested by QTL mapping ( Swarup et al., 1999 ), and further analysis revealed the PerCv5b QTL overlapping FLC 's map location, with a high-temperature-specific effect on circadian period ( Edwards et al., 2005 ). The similarity of temperature specificity, direction, and extent of the period phenotype in the QTL, in NILs carrying the weak FLC- L er allele or functional FLC- Cvi allele, as well as in single or double mutant combinations of induced flc and fri alleles strongly support FLC as the cause of the PerCv5b QTL. Temperature compensation keeps the circadian period relatively constant over a wide temperature range and is a ubiquitous property of circadian rhythms. Shorter periods are commonly observed at the upper end of the physiological temperature range due to increased biochemical reaction rates ( Rensing and Ruoff, 2002 ). FLC expression contributes to normal temperature compensation of the Arabidopsis circadian clock by counteracting the period shortening observed in flc mutants at 27°C.

As aberrant circadian timing impairs plant growth ( Dodd et al., 2005 ), this suggests that the circadian function of FLC is likely to be relevant to fitness in some habitats. The period change caused by FLC at 27°C is at least as great as the effects of natural allelic variants in Drosophila that are distributed in a latitudinal cline ( Sawyer et al., 1997 ). FLC expression could be lost either by epigenetic repression of FLC following vernalization ( Bastow et al., 2004 ; Sung and Amasino, 2004 ) or in the early flowering accessions that carry mutations of FLC or its activator FRI ( Michaels and Amasino, 1999 ; Johanson et al., 2000 ; Gazzani et al., 2003 ). Selective pressure for such downregulation of FLC function in flowering time appears to have overridden secondary effects of altered circadian timing, at least in these cases. The multiple QTL that affect circadian period at 27°C ( Edwards et al., 2005 ) might in part reflect compensating mechanisms to balance selection on flowering time and circadian timing.

Transcriptomic analysis comparing the fri ; flc and FRI ; FLC genotypes at 27°C was used to identify FLC -responsive genes. A list of 1000 candidate genes showing greatest change in expression between the two genotypes included FLC and AGL20 , but few other genes known to be involved in the regulation of flowering time or, for that matter, of the circadian clock. Further microarray assays were used to identify circadian-regulated transcripts and highlight a subset of candidate genes to mediate FLC 's effect on the clock. Some differences were apparent between the two methods of scoring rhythmic transcripts, COSOPT and BFC. Overall, COSOPT gave a more reliable indication of rhythmicity, which suggested that ∼16% of the Arabidopsis genome was clock regulated. Clustering by BFC enabled identification of genes with higher amplitude profiles, similar to those of known important clock genes, as a means of targeting potentially important rhythmic regulators. Even the high-amplitude BFC clusters included several genes that were not scored as rhythmic by COSOPT ( Table 3 ). A consensus of the two methods indicated that a minimum of 8.7% of the genes on the array showed a circadian expression pattern under our experimental conditions.

GO and promoter analysis of the genes scored rhythmic by COSOPT and clustered by BFC revealed that the data contained considerable information on functional clustering and potential regulatory sequences. Both methods used in concert enabled wider sampling of this information. Clearly, not all the important clock-affecting genes are rhythmically regulated at the transcript level, but BFC provides a means of targeting a few genes from a large number, as is often required from array data. This identified LUX as a strong candidate to mediate FLC 's effect on the clock. Mathematical modeling suggested that a modest increase in peak LUX expression, as observed in FRI ; FLC , would be sufficient to explain FLC 's effect on the clock at 27°C. One caveat to this is that plants constitutively overexpressing LUX did not show a long period phenotype but rather wild-type period oscillations that damped into arrhythmia ( Onai and Ishiura, 2005 ). However, rhythmic overexpression of LUX , as in FRI ; FLC , may alter the clock in a different way to constitutive overexpression of the gene. Indeed, increasing rhythmically expressed LUX gene dosage does appear to increase circadian period, consistent with our prediction, because plants heterozygous for a lux mutation have a shorter period than wild-type LUX homozygotes ( Onai et al., 2004 ).

Natural genetic variation is a valuable resource, and its importance for understanding plant biology is increasingly being recognized (reviewed in Koornneef et al., 2004 ). Pinpointing the mechanisms of small effect QTL, starting with the identification of the underlying genes, is not a trivial matter ( Weigel and Nordborg, 2005 ). As demonstrated for FLC , mathematical modeling provides a useful complement to experiments in understanding quantitative changes in plant response networks.
