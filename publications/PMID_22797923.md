Here, we describe a phosphorylation-based reverse myristoyl switch for mammalian 
ZNRF2, and show that this E3 ubiquitin ligase and its sister protein ZNRF1 
regulate the Na(+)/K(+) pump (Na(+)/K(+)ATPase). N-myristoylation localizes 
ZNRF1 and ZNRF2 to intracellular membranes and enhances their activity. However, 
when ZNRF2 is phosphorylated in response to agonists including insulin and 
growth factors, it binds to 14-3-3 and is released into the cytosol. On 
membranes, ZNRF1 and ZNRF2 interact with the Na(+)/K(+)ATPase α1 subunit via 
their UBZ domains, while their RING domains interact with E2 proteins, 
predominantly Ubc13 that, together with Uev1a, mediates formation of 
Lys63-ubiquitin linkages. ZNRF1 and ZNRF2 can ubiquitylate the cytoplasmic loop 
encompassing the nucleotide-binding and phosphorylation regions of the 
Na(+)/K(+)ATPase α1 subunit. Ouabain, a Na(+)/K(+)ATPase inhibitor and 
therapeutic cardiac glycoside, decreases ZNRF1 protein levels, whereas knockdown 
of ZNRF2 inhibits the ouabain-induced decrease of cell surface and total 
Na(+)/K(+)ATPase α1 levels. Thus, ZNRF1 and ZNRF2 are new players in regulation 
of the ubiquitous Na(+)/K(+)ATPase that is tuned to changing demands in many 
physiological contexts.
