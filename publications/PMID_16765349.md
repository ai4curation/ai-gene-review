Cip/Kip family protein p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, is 
directly transactivated by retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) upon retinoic 
acid (RA):RARalpha binding. Yet the role of p21 upregulation by RA in lymphoma 
cells remains unknown. Here, we show that, in human pre-B lymphoma Nalm6 cells, 
RA-induced proliferation inhibition results from massive cell death 
characterized by apoptosis. Upregulated p21 by RA accompanies caspase-3 
activation and precedes the occurrence of apoptosis. p21 induction leads to 
increased p21 complex formation with cyclin E/CDK2, which occurs when cyclin E 
and CDK2 levels remain constant. CDK2 can alternatively promote apoptosis, but 
the mechanisms remain unknown. Data presented here suggest a novel RA-signaling, 
by which RA-induced p21 induction and complex formation with cyclin E/CDK2 
diverts CDK2 function from normally driving proliferation to alternatively 
promoting apoptosis.
