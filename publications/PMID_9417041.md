ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) constitute a family of small monomeric GTPases. 
ARFs 1 and 3 function in the recruitment of coat proteins to membranes of the 
Golgi apparatus, whereas ARF6 is localized to the plasma membrane, where it 
appears to modulate both the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis. 
Like other GTPases, ARF activation is facilitated by specific guanine nucleotide 
exchange factors (GEFs). ARNO (ARF nucleotide-binding site opener) is a member 
of a growing family of ARF-GEFs that share a common, tripartite structure 
consisting of an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, a central domain with homology 
to the yeast protein Sec7p, and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain. 
Recently, ARNO and its close homologue cytohesin-1 were found to catalyze in 
vitro nucleotide exchange on ARF1 and ARF3, respectively, raising the 
possibility that these GEFs function in the Golgi. However, the actual function 
of these proteins may be determined in part by their ability to interact with 
specific ARFs and in part by their subcellular localization. We report here that 
in vitro ARNO can stimulate nucleotide exchange on both ARF1 and ARF6. 
Furthermore, based on subcellular fractionation and immunolocalization 
experiments, we find that ARNO is localized to the plasma membrane in mammalian 
cells rather than the Golgi. It is therefore likely that ARNO functions in 
plasma membrane events by modulating the activity of ARF6 in vivo. These 
findings are consistent with the previous observation that cytohesin-1 regulates 
the adhesiveness of alphaLbeta2 integrins at the plasma membrane of lymphocytes.
