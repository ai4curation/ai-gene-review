In the eukaryotic cytosol, Hsp70 and Hsp90 cooperate with various co-chaperone 
proteins in the folding of a growing set of substrates, including the 
glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Here, we analyse the function of the co-chaperone 
Tpr2, which contains two chaperone-binding TPR domains and a DnaJ homologous J 
domain. In vivo, an increase or decrease in Tpr2 expression reduces GR 
activation, suggesting that Tpr2 is required at a narrowly defined expression 
level. As shown in vitro, Tpr2 recognizes both Hsp70 and Hsp90 through its TPR 
domains, and its J domain stimulates ATP hydrolysis and polypeptide binding by 
Hsp70. Furthermore, unlike other co-chaperones, Tpr2 induces ATP-independent 
dissociation of Hsp90 but not of Hsp70 from chaperone-substrate complexes. 
Excess Tpr2 inhibits the Hsp90-dependent folding of GR in cell lysates. We 
propose a novel mechanism in which Tpr2 mediates the retrograde transfer of 
substrates from Hsp90 onto Hsp70. At normal levels substoichiometric to Hsp90 
and Hsp70, this activity optimizes the function of the multichaperone machinery.
