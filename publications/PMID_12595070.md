The receptor for parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) 
regulates calcium homeostasis, bone remodeling and skeletal development. 14-3-3 
proteins bind to signaling proteins and act as molecular scaffolds and 
regulators of subcellular localization. We show that the parathyroid hormone 
receptor (PTHR) interacts with 14-3-3 and the proteins colocalize within the 
cell. 14-3-3 interacts with the C-terminal tail of the receptor containing a 
consensus 14-3-3 binding motif, but additional binding sites are also used. 
Protein kinase-A treatment of the receptor and especially the C-terminal tail 
reduces 14-3-3 binding. The expressed C-terminal tail is primarily localized in 
the nucleus, supporting the function of a putative nuclear localization signal 
that could be involved in the previously described nuclear localization of PTHR. 
The observed interaction between PTHR and the 14-3-3 protein implies that 14-3-3 
could contribute to regulation of PTHR signaling.
