A polyglutamine repeat expansion of more than 36 units in a protein called 
huntingtin (htt) is the only known cause of Huntington's disease (HD). The 
expanded repeat length is inversely correlated with the age-at-onset (AAO), 
however, the onset age among HD patients with CAG repeats below 60 units varies 
considerably. In addition to environmental factors, genetic factors different 
from the expanded CAG repeat length can modify the AAO of HD. We hypothezised 
that htt interacting proteins might contribute to this variation in the AAO and 
investigated human htt-associated protein-1 (HAP1) using genetic and functional 
assays. We identified six polymorphisms in the HAP1 gene including one that 
substitutes methionine (M441) for threonine (T441) at amino acid 441. Analyzing 
980 European HD patients, we found that patients homozygous for the M441 
genotype show an 8-year delay in the AAO. Functional assays demonstrated that 
human M441-HAP1 interacts with mutant htt more tightly than does human 
T441-HAP1, reduces soluble htt degraded products and protects against 
htt-mediated toxicity. We thus provide genetic and functional evidence that the 
M441-HAP1 polymorphism modifies the AAO of HD.
