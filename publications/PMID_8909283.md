Recently, a human cDNA clone with high sequence homology to the 
photolyase/blue-light photoreceptor family was identified. The putative protein 
encoded by this gene exhibited a strikingly high (48% identity) degree of 
homology to the Drosophila melanogaster (6-4) photolyase [Todo et al. (1996) 
Science 272, 109-112]. We have now identified a second human gene whose amino 
acid sequence displays 73% identity to the first one and have named the two 
genes CRY1 and CRY2, respectively. The corresponding proteins hCRY1 and hCRY2 
were purified and characterized as maltose-binding fusion proteins. Similar to 
other members of the photolyase/blue-light photoreceptor family, both proteins 
were found to contain FAD and a pterin cofactor. Like the plant blue-light 
photoreceptors, both hCRY1 and hCRY2 lacked photolyase activity on the 
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer and the (6-4) photoproduct. We conclude that these 
newly discovered members of the photolyase/photoreceptor family are not 
photolyases and instead may function as blue-light photoreceptors in humans.
