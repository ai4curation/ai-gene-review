Molecular chaperones may promote cell survival, but how this process is 
regulated, especially in cancer, is not well understood. Using high throughput 
proteomics screening, we identified the cell cycle regulator and apoptosis 
inhibitor survivin as a novel protein associated with the molecular chaperone 
Hsp60. Acute ablation of Hsp60 by small interfering RNA destabilizes the 
mitochondrial pool of survivin, induces mitochondrial dysfunction, and activates 
caspase-dependent apoptosis. This response involves disruption of an Hsp60-p53 
complex, which results in p53 stabilization, increased expression of 
pro-apoptotic Bax, and Bax-dependent apoptosis. In vivo, Hsp60 is abundantly 
expressed in primary human tumors, as compared with matched normal tissues, and 
small interfering RNA ablation of Hsp60 in normal cells is well tolerated and 
does not cause apoptosis. Therefore, Hsp60 orchestrates a broad cell survival 
program centered on stabilization of mitochondrial survivin and restraining of 
p53 function, and this process is selectively exploited in cancer. Hsp60 
inhibitors may function as attractive anticancer agents by differentially 
inducing apoptosis in tumor cells.
