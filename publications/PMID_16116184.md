Maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) is critical for initiation of immune 
responses and is regulated by various stimulatory signals. We assessed the role 
of galectin (Gal)-9 in DC maturation. Culture of immature DCs with exogenous 
Gal-9 markedly increased the surface expression of CD40, CD54, CD80, CD83, CD86, 
and HLA-DR in a dose-dependent manner, although Gal-9 had no or little effect on 
differentiation of human monocytes into immature DCs. Gal-9-treated DCs secreted 
IL-12 but not IL-10, and they elicited the production of Th1 cytokines 
(IFN-gamma and IL-2) but not that of the Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) by 
allogeneic CD4+ T cells. These effects of Gal-9 on immature DCs were not 
essentially dependent on its lectin properties, given that they were inhibited 
only slightly by lactose. We further found that a Gal-9 mutant that lacks 
beta-galactoside binding activity reproduced the above activities and that an 
anti-Gal-9 mAb suppressed them. Gal-9 induced phosphorylation of the MAPK p38 
and ERK1/2 in DCs, and an inhibitor of p38 signaling, but not inhibitors of 
signaling by either ERK1/2 or PI3K, blocked Gal-9-induced up-regulation of 
costimulatory molecule expression and IL-12 production. These findings suggest 
that Gal-9 plays a role not only in innate immunity but also in acquired 
immunity by inducing DC maturation and promoting Th1 immune responses.
