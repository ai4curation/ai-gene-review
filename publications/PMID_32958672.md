While near-cognate codons are frequently used for translation initiation in 
eukaryotes, their efficiencies are usually low (<10% compared to an AUG in 
optimal context). Here, we describe a rare case of highly efficient near-cognate 
initiation. A CUG triplet located in the 5' leader of POLG messenger RNA (mRNA) 
initiates almost as efficiently (∼60 to 70%) as an AUG in optimal context. This 
CUG directs translation of a conserved 260-triplet-long overlapping open reading 
frame (ORF), which we call POLGARF (POLG Alternative Reading Frame). Translation 
of a short upstream ORF 5' of this CUG governs the ratio between POLG (the 
catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase) and POLGARF synthesized from 
a single POLG mRNA. Functional investigation of POLGARF suggests a role in 
extracellular signaling. While unprocessed POLGARF localizes to the nucleoli 
together with its interacting partner C1QBP, serum stimulation results in rapid 
cleavage and secretion of a POLGARF C-terminal fragment. Phylogenetic analysis 
shows that POLGARF evolved ∼160 million y ago due to a mammalian-wide 
interspersed repeat (MIR) transposition into the 5' leader sequence of the 
mammalian POLG gene, which became fixed in placental mammals. This discovery of 
POLGARF unveils a previously undescribed mechanism of de novo protein-coding 
gene evolution.
