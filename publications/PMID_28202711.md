Binding of 14-3-3 proteins to leucine-rich repeat protein kinase 2 (LRRK2) is 
known to be impaired by many Parkinson's disease (PD)-relevant mutations. 
Abrogation of this interaction is connected to enhanced LRRK2 kinase activity, 
which in turn is implicated in increased ubiquitination of LRRK2, accumulation 
of LRRK2 into inclusion bodies and reduction in neurite length. Hence, the 
interaction between 14-3-3 and LRRK2 is of significant interest as a possible 
drug target for the treatment of PD. However, LRRK2 possesses multiple sites 
that, upon phosphorylation, can bind to 14-3-3, thus rendering the interaction 
relatively complex. Using biochemical assays and crystal structures, we 
characterize the multivalent interaction between these two proteins.
