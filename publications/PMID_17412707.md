The exosome is a complex of 3'-5' exoribonucleases and RNA-binding proteins, 
which is involved in processing or degradation of different classes of RNA. 
Previously, the characterization of purified exosome complexes from yeast and 
human cells suggested that C1D and KIAA0052/hMtr4p are associated with the 
exosome and thus might regulate its functional activities. Subcellular 
localization experiments demonstrated that C1D and KIAA0052/hMtr4p co-localize 
with exosome subunit PM/Scl-100 in the nucleoli of HEp-2 cells. Additionally, 
the nucleolar accumulation of C1D appeared to be dependent on PM/Scl-100. 
Protein-protein interaction studies showed that C1D binds to PM/Scl-100, whereas 
KIAA0052/hMtr4p was found to interact with MPP6, a previously identified 
exosome-associated protein. Moreover, we demonstrate that C1D, MPP6 and 
PM/Scl-100 form a stable trimeric complex in vitro. Knock-down of C1D, MPP6 and 
KIAA0052/hMtr4p by RNAi resulted in the accumulation of 3'-extended 5.8S rRNA 
precursors, showing that these proteins are required for rRNA processing. 
Interestingly, C1D appeared to contain RNA-binding activity with a potential 
preference for structured RNAs. Taken together, our results are consistent with 
a role for the exosome-associated proteins C1D, MPP6 and KIAA052/hMtr4p in the 
recruitment of the exosome to pre-rRNA to mediate the 3' end processing of the 
5.8S rRNA.
