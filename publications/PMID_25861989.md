DNA damage-induced NF-κB activation plays a critical role in regulating cellular 
response to genotoxic stress. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the 
magnitude and duration of this genotoxic NF-κB signaling cascade are poorly 
understood. We recently demonstrated that genotoxic NF-κB activation is 
regulated by reversible ubiquitination of several essential mediators involved 
in this signaling pathway. Here we show that TRAF family member-associated NF-κB 
activator (TANK) negatively regulates NF-κB activation by DNA damage via 
inhibiting ubiquitination of TRAF6. Despite the lack of a deubiquitination 
enzyme domain, TANK has been shown to negatively regulate the ubiquitination of 
TRAF proteins. We found TANK formed a complex with MCPIP1 (also known as 
ZC3H12A) and a deubiquitinase, USP10, which was essential for the 
USP10-dependent deubiquitination of TRAF6 and the resolution of genotoxic NF-κB 
activation upon DNA damage. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated deletion of TANK in human cells significantly 
enhanced NF-κB activation by genotoxic treatment, resulting in enhanced cell 
survival and increased inflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, we found 
that the TANK-MCPIP1-USP10 complex also decreased TRAF6 ubiquitination in cells 
treated with IL-1β or LPS. In accordance, depletion of USP10 enhanced NF-κB 
activation induced by IL-1β or LPS. Collectively, our data demonstrate that TANK 
serves as an important negative regulator of NF-κB signaling cascades induced by 
genotoxic stress and IL-1R/Toll-like receptor stimulation in a manner dependent 
on MCPIP1/USP10-mediated TRAF6 deubiquitination.

Introduction

DNA-damaging agents such as genotoxic chemotherapeutics and ionizing radiation are widely used as the mainstay of cancer therapy to treat various types of human malignancies such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer. However, acquired therapeutic resistance to the genotoxic agents significantly limits the efficacy of cancer treatments, resulting in cancer relapse and metastasis. DNA damage-induced activation of transcription factor NF-κB plays a critical role in mediating therapeutic resistance in cancer cells ( 1 , 2 ). Genotoxic treatment-activated NF-κB has been shown to modulate the transcription of antiapoptotic genes, proinflammatory cytokines, and oncogenic microRNAs, which collaboratively attenuate DNA damage-induced cancer cell apoptosis and promote cancer cell invasion ( 3 – 5 ). Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the activation and resolution of NF-κB activation by genotoxic anticancer agents may provide pivotal insights into developing novel therapeutic approaches to counteract acquired drug resistance and improve therapeutic efficacy.

The mechanisms involved in regulating NF-κB signaling cascades following activation of membrane-bound receptors have been well established ( 6 , 7 ). Nevertheless, how genotoxic agents, which initiate a DNA damage response in the nucleus, activate the cytoplasmic NF-κB signaling cascade is still not completely understood ( 2 , 8 ). It has been found that NF-κB essential modifier (NEMO, 4 also known as IKKγ), the regulatory subunit of the canonical IκB kinase complex, was modified by SUMO-1 in the nucleus upon genotoxic stress ( 9 ), which was facilitated by PARP1, protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIASy), and the PIDD (p53-induced protein with a death domain)/RIP1 (receptor-interacting protein 1) complex ( 10 – 12 ). Then SUMOylated NEMO could further interact with the DNA damage response apical kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), which directly phosphorylates and facilitates cIAP1/2-mediated monoubiquitination of NEMO ( 13 , 14 ). The nuclear monoubiquitination of NEMO promotes the export of the NEMO-ATM complex into the cytoplasm, where it further activates the cytoplasmic IKK and downstream NF-κB signaling pathways. Moreover, Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of ELKS, RIP1, and TRAF6 as well as the M1-linked linear ubiquitination of NEMO have been shown to modulate TAK1/IKK kinase complex activation in the cytoplasm upon genotoxic stimulation ( 15 – 18 ).

The extent and duration of NF-κB activation is controlled by a dynamic balance between activation signaling and negative regulatory mechanisms, leading to the resolution of NF-κB activation ( 19 ). Compared with signaling events mediating NF-κB activation upon DNA damage, even less was known about how this signaling cascade is resolved. Lee et al. ( 20 ) found that a Sentrin/SUMO-specific protease, SENP2, was up-regulated in response to genotoxic NF-κB activation, which served as a negative feedback response to inhibit NF-κB activation by attenuating NEMO SUMOylation in response to genotoxic stress. We showed recently that NF-κB-dependent MCPIP1 (also known as ZC3H12A) induction negatively regulated the genotoxic NF-κB signaling cascade by promoting USP10-mediated deubiquitination of NEMO, resulting in decreased NF-κB activation upon DNA damage ( 21 ). Nevertheless, genetic deletion of either SENP2 or MCPIP1 in MEF cells was not sufficient to completely block the resolution of genotoxic NF-κB activation, suggesting that additional negative regulatory mechanisms controlling genotoxic NF-κB signaling remain to be elucidated.

TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK, also known as I-TRAF) could interact with the TRAF family members TRAF2 and TRAF3, thereby regulating TRAF-mediated signaling pathways ( 22 – 24 ). In the antiviral immune response following retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 activation, TANK may serve as an adaptor bridging TRAF3 with TBK1 and IKKϵ, which promotes phosphorylation and activation of IRF3/IRF7 as well as induction of NF-κB activation, leading to effective type I IFN production ( 25 – 27 ). Nevertheless, TANK has also been shown to negatively regulate NF-κB activation ( 28 , 29 ). It has been found that NF-κB activation upon TLR or BCR (B cell receptor) stimulation was augmented in macrophages and B cells isolated from Tank −/− mice compared with their wild-type counterparts. Moreover, TANK deficiency increased TRAF6 ubiquitination in response to TLR activation in macrophages, which may contribute to enhanced NF-κB activation. However, the mechanism by which TANK inhibits TRAF6 ubiquitination remains enigmatic because TANK lacks the deubiquitination enzyme (DUB) domain and TANK does not interact with A20 and CYLD (cylindromatosis), two common DUBs that have been shown to inhibit NF-κB signaling ( 28 ).

In this report, we show that TANK inhibits genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB activation, which may be dependent on inhibition of TRAF6 ubiquitination. The TRAF2/3-interacting domain of TANK and the TRAF-C domain of TRAF6 are essential for TANK association with TRAF6. Mechanistically, TANK forms a complex with MCPIP1 and USP10, which promotes USP10-dependent deubiquitination of TRAF6 in cells treated with genotoxic stimuli. TANK is indispensable for TRAF6 deubiquitination by USP10 because deletion of TANK disrupts the association between USP10 and TRAF6, thereby stabilizing TRAF6 ubiquitination upon DNA damage. Moreover, the TANK-MCPIP1-USP10 complex is also responsible for inhibition of TRAF6 ubiquitination in cells treated with LPS or IL-1β. Collectively, our data suggest that TANK may serve as the adaptor for recruiting the USP10-MCPIP1 complex to polyubiquitinated TRAF6, which, in turn, disassembles the polyubiquitin chains anchored on TRAF6, resulting in the termination of NF-κB activation in response to genotoxic stress and IL-1R/TLR activation.

Discussion

Studies in the last decade have provided significant insights into how genotoxic stress induces NF-κB activation through an atypical nuclear-to-cytoplasmic signaling cascade that may play critical roles in mediating acquired therapeutic resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cancer cells ( 2 , 8 ). In this genotoxic NF-κB signaling pathway, a variety of protein posttranslational modifications, such as SUMOylation, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, were found to be involved in mediating signal transduction. Multiple forms of ubiquitination, including monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination with Lys-63, Met-1, and Lys-48 linkages, have been shown to play distinct roles in transducing the nuclear DNA damage signal to the cytoplasmic IKK complex, leading to NF-κB activation ( 2 , 40 ). Because these posttranslational modifications are reversible, they may serve as signaling switches to regulate the extent and duration of genotoxic NF-κB activation. Indeed, a recent study showed that a SUMO protease, SENP2, was induced by NF-κB activation in response to DNA damage, which, in turn, inhibited NEMO SUMOylation, leading to decreased genotoxic NF-κB activation ( 20 ). We found that MCPIP1 transcription was enhanced by NF-κB upon genotoxic stress, which served as a scaffold protein to promote USP10-dependent deubiquitination of NEMO, thereby attenuating NF-κB activation ( 21 ). In this study, we further showed that TANK was a member of the MCPIP1-USP10-associated complex induced by genotoxic stress. NF-κB-mediated up-regulation of MCPIP1 enhanced complex formation among MCPIP1, USP10, and TANK, which played an important role as a negative feedback response to attenuate NF-κB activation by diminishing polyubiquitination of both NEMO and TRAF6 ( Fig. 8 F ). Although TANK is indispensable for MCPIP1/USP10-dependent TRAF6 deubiquitination upon genotoxic stress, USP10 was still able to partially decrease NEMO ubiquitination in TANK KO cells, suggesting that a TANK-independent mechanism may also promote the deubiquitination of NEMO. Nevertheless, TANK deletion remarkably reduced the interaction between NEMO and MCPIP1-USP10 and USP10-promoted NEMO deubiquitination, indicating that the interaction between TANK and NEMO may further reinforce NEMO association with the MCPIP1-USP10 complex, thereby enhancing the removal of polyubiquitin chains anchored on NEMO.

The polyubiquitin chains attached on TRAF6 and NEMO in response to genotoxic stress have been characterized as a Lys-63-linked chain and linear chain, respectively ( 15 , 18 ). Recent studies from Keusekotten et al. ( 41 ) and Rivkin et al. ( 42 ) demonstrated that OTU deubiquitinase with linear linkage specificity (OTULIN/Gumby/FAM105B) is a linear ubiquitin chain-specific DUB that disassembles a linear ubiquitin chain by cleaving the peptide bond-linked ubiquitin molecules ( 41 , 42 ). We found that MCPIP1-associated USP10 was able to remove the linear polyubiquitin chain from NEMO in cells exposed to genotoxic stimuli, likely by cleaving isopeptide bond between NEMO and the first ubiquitin and having the Met-1-linked linear chain removed en bloc . In contrast, USP10 was able to disassemble the Lys-63-linked chain by cleaving the individual ubiquitin moiety ( 21 ). Another well characterized DUB, CYLD, was also found to cleave both the Lys-63 chain and linear chain in vitro ( 43 ) and form a complex with OTULIN to suppress linear ubiquitination in cells ( 44 ). We found that overexpression of CYLD or OTULIN diminished NEMO linear ubiquitination by genotoxic stress, whereas deletion of TANK had little impact on CYLD/OTULIN-dependent deubiquitination of NEMO (data not shown). These observations suggest that TANK selectively participates in USP10-dependent deubiquitination of NEMO, likely through interaction with MCPIP1.

USP10 has been shown to regulate the cellular response to DNA damage by deubiquitinating and stabilizing p53, which requires its translocation into the nucleus and phosphorylation by ATM ( 45 ). Moreover, USP10 could stabilize Beclin1 by inhibiting its ubiquitination, which reciprocally stabilizes USP10 and promotes p53-dependent apoptosis ( 46 ). A recent report found that USP10 could interact with and deubiquitinates SIRT6, which enhanced SIRT6 stability and resulted in SIRT6/p53-dependent suppression of c-Myc oncogenic activity ( 47 ). All of these studies indicate that USP10 may play a tumor-suppressive role by deubiquitinating and stabilizing critical tumor suppressors. Here we show that USP10 may also suppress tumor progression by inhibiting NF-κB signaling. In cancer cells exposed to genotoxic treatment, USP10 may diminish NF-κB activation by removing polyubiquitin chains attached on NEMO and TRAF6, which disrupts the signaling scaffold required for effective IKK activation, thereby sensitizing cancer cells to cytotoxic treatment.

Our data indicate that TANK-associated MCPIP1-USP10 may also suppress NF-κB activation in the inflammatory response upon IL1R/TLR activation. It has been found that LPS-induced ubiquitination of TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6 was increased substantially in MCPIP1 −/− macrophages ( 39 ). Similarly, TRAF6 ubiquitination was enhanced significantly in Tank −/− B cells and macrophages upon TLR stimulation ( 28 ). Consistently, escalated NF-κB activation and hyperinflammation were observed in both Zc3h12a −/− and Tank −/− mice. Although both TANK and MCPIP1 were implicated in promoting the deubiquitination of TRAF proteins, the underlying mechanism was elusive because neither of the proteins harbor a well defined DUB domain. Our study demonstrated that USP10 forms a complex with TANK and MCPIP1 and is essential for TANK-dependent deubiquitination of TRAF6 in response to IL-1β treatment and genotoxic stress, suggesting that USP10 may be the missing link responsible for the DUB activity of the TANK-MCPIP1-associated complex.

In summary, the results presented in this study imply that TANK negatively regulates genotoxic NF-κB activation by diminishing the ubiquitination of TRAF6 and NEMO, which relies on the formation of a deubiquitinating complex comprised of TANK, MCPIP1, and USP10. TANK plays an essential role as a scaffold protein, bridging the interaction between TRAF6 and MCPIP1-USP10, which facilitates USP10-dependent deubiquitination. Our data further suggest that this TANK-MCPIP1-USP10 complex may also be responsible for inhibiting the ubiquitination of TRAF family proteins in response to IL-1R/TLR activation, which may prevent hyperinflammation and other pathological processes because of uncontrolled activation of NF-κB signaling. Therefore, modulating the TANK-mediated inhibition of NF-κB activation may serve as a valuable therapeutic approach to mitigate cancer therapeutic resistance and prevent autoimmune diseases.
