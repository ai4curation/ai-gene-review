We isolated a cDNA encoding a novel protein, XB51, that interacts with the 
amino-terminal domain of the neuron-specific X11-like protein (X11L). The 
protein XB51 inhibited the association of X11L with amyloid precursor protein 
through a non-competitive mechanism and abolished the suppression of 
beta-amyloid production by X11L. The majority of XB51 is localized around the 
nucleus and recovered in 
3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS) 
buffer-insoluble fraction when XB51 is expressed in cells. Association of XB51 
with X11L changed the intracellular distribution of XB51 and resulted in 
redistribution of XB51 into the CHAPS buffer-soluble fraction. These 
observations suggest that XB51, together with X11L, plays an important role in 
the regulatory system of amyloid precursor protein metabolism and beta-amyloid 
generation.
