Estrogen, which has been strongly implicated in breast cancer, suppresses 
apoptosis in estrogen receptor (ER) positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. 
Phospholipase D (PLD), which is commonly elevated in ER negative breast cancer 
cells, also suppresses apoptosis. Survival signals generated by both estrogen 
and PLD are dependent upon elevated Myc expression. We report here that 
estrogen- and PLD-induced increases in Myc expression are due to reduced 
turnover of Myc protein. Estrogen and PLD suppressed phosphorylation of Myc at 
Thr58--a site that targets Myc for degradation by the proteasome. The data 
provide a mechanism for elevated Myc expression in hormone-dependent and 
hormone-independent breast cancer.

Abstract

Estrogen, which has been strongly implicated in breast cancer, suppresses apoptosis in estrogen receptor (ER) positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Phospholipase D (PLD), which is commonly elevated in ER negative breast cancer cells, also suppresses apoptosis. Survival signals generated by both estrogen and PLD are dependent upon elevated Myc expression. We report here that estrogen- and PLD-induced increases in Myc expression are due to reduced turnover of Myc protein. Estrogen and PLD suppressed phosphorylation of Myc at Thr58 - a site that targets Myc for degradation by the proteasome. The data provide a mechanism for elevated Myc expression in hormone-dependent and hormone-independent breast cancer.

1. Introduction

One of the most common defects in human cancer cells is deregulated expression of the Myc oncogene. Myc is a transcription factor that stimulates the transcription of factors that facilitate progression through critical cell cycle checkpoints and suppresses transcription of factors that suppress cell cycle progression [ 1 ]. Elevated Myc expression has been reported in a wide variety of human cancer [ 2 , 3 ]. Expression of Myc is regulated at many levels including: transcriptional, post-transcriptional (mRNA stability and translation), and post-translational (protein stability) [ 4 - 7 ]. Thus, there are many ways in which Myc expression can be altered in human cancers. In addition, there are mutations to the Myc gene that significantly enhance Myc stability and therefore expression [ 8 , 9 ]. Most significantly, mutations at Thr58 lead to a stabilized Myc protein [ 8 , 10 ]. Moreover, phosphorylation of Myc at Thr58 has been shown to regulate Myc stability by targeting Myc for degradation by the proteasome [ 11 ]. Thr58 is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), which phosphorylates many proteins fated for degradation by the protaseome [ 12 ].

We reported previously that treatment with 17-β-estradiol (E2) led to a bi-modal increase in Myc expression in the estrogen receptor (ER) positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line [ 13 ]. There was a short-term transient increase in Myc expression that peaked at about two hours. More striking however was a large sustained stable increase in Myc expression that peaked at five days of treatment. This long-term increase in Myc expression was critical for E2 to suppress apoptosis in MCF-7 cells subjected to the stress of serum withdrawal [ 13 ]. We also reported that elevated phospholipase D (PLD) activity could suppress apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, and that PLD similarly increased Myc expression [ 13 , 14 ]. PLD activity, like Myc expression, has been reported to be elevated in a substantial percentage of human breast cancers [ 15 , 16 ] and has been proposed to provide a survival signal in breast and other cancers [ 17 - 19 ]. Significantly, PLD activity is elevated in several breast cancer cell lines that are ER negative [ 14 , 20 - 22 ], suggesting the possibility that elevated PLD activity in breast cancer cells facilitates progression to hormone independence. In this report, we provide evidence that the induction of Myc expression by both E2 and PLD activity is due to stabilization.

4. Discussion

Suppression of apoptosis is critical in tumor progression [ 32 ]. Myc has been implicated in the suppression of apoptosis and progression past cell cycle checkpoints where apoptosis is regulated [ 3 ]. The regulation of Myc expression is complex and is controlled at the level of transcription, translation and stabilization [ 33 ]. We reported previously that prolonged exposure to E2 leads to very high levels of Myc expression that peaked at five days and that elevated Myc expression was required for the suppression of apoptosis in ER positive MCF-7 cells subjected to the stress of serum withdrawal [ 13 ]. E2 could be replaced with elevated PLD expression, which similarly increased Myc expression and suppressed apoptosis in MCF-7 cells subjected to serum withdrawal. In this report, we have characterized the mechanism for the sustained induction of Myc. We found that the increased Myc expression induced by both E2 and PLD was due to stabilization. Both E2 and PLD suppressed phosphorylation of Myc at Thr58 - a site that targets Myc for degradation by the proteasome [ 8 , 34 ]. Myc is phosphorylated at Thr58 by GSK-3β [ 26 , 27 ], and consistent with the reduced phosphorylation of Myc at Thr58, both E2 and PLD stimulated a substantial increase in the phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser9, which suppresses GSK-3β activity [ 28 - 30 ]. A model for the E2 and PLD stabilization of Myc through suppression of GSK-3β is shown schematically in Figure 4 .

The phosphorylation of Myc at Ser62 was elevated in response to both E2 and PLD. The effect was not as dramatic as observed for Thr58, but the increased phosphorylation at Ser62 is also consistent with increased stability of Myc. Myc must be first phosphorylated at Ser62 before it can be phosphorylated at Thr58 [ 11 ], and then it must subsequently be dephosphorylated by PP2A before it can be ubiquitinated. Consistent with this model we previously reported that PLD activity suppresses PP2A activity in MCF-7 cells [ 24 ]. Thus, the increased phosphorylation of Myc at Ser62 in response to PLD likely reflects the suppression of PP2A activity by PLD. We did not see a significant effect of E2 on PP2A activity in the MCF-7 cells. Thus, at this time we are not sure as to how E2 increases phosphorylation of Myc at Ser62.

We have proposed that elevated PLD activity in human breast cancer provides a means for progression to hormone independence [ 17 ]. This was largely based on the observation that breast cancer cell lines with highly elevated PLD activity were all ER negative and most breast cancer cell lines with low PLD activity were ER negative [ 13 , 14 , 20 - 22 ]. While these observations only provide correlative evidence for the involvement PLD in progression to hormone independence in breast cancer, there is increasing evidence that PLD generates survival signals that would compensate for the loss of hormone responsiveness and dependence. As we reported previously, and observed by others, E2 provides a survival signal in ER positive breast cancer cells [ 13 , 34 - 36 ]. PLD similarly provides a survival signal in breast cancer cells subjected to the stress of serum withdrawal [ 14 , 22 ], conditions that occur in an emerging solid tumor prior to vascularization. The lack of serum would also restrict access to E2 and select for cells that could survive these conditions. Cells with elevated PLD activity would have the ability to survive these conditions. The finding here that PLD, like E2 can promote the stabilization of Myc further supports a critical role for the elevated PLD activity commonly seen in ER negative breast cancer cells for survival as tumors progress to hormone independence. The study suggests that in hormone resistant breast cancers, targeting PLD survival signals could be an effective therapeutic strategy for inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells dependent on PLD activity for survival.
