C1q, the first component of the classical pathway of the complement system, 
interacts with various cell types and triggers a variety of cell-specific 
cellular responses, such as oxidative burst, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, etc. 
Different biological responses are attributed to the interaction of C1q with 
more than one putative cell-surface C1q receptor/C1q-binding protein. 
Previously, it has been shown that C1q-mediated oxidative burst by neutrophils 
is not linked to G-protein-coupled fMet-Leu-Phe-mediated response. In the 
present study, we have investigated neutrophil migration brought about by C1q 
and tried to identify the signal-transduction pathways involved in the 
chemotactic response. We found that C1q stimulated neutrophil migration in a 
dose-dependent manner, primarily by enhancing chemotaxis (directed movement) 
rather than chemokinesis (random movement). This C1q-induced chemotaxis could be 
abolished by an inhibitor of G-proteins (pertussis toxin) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 
kinase (wortmannin and LY294002). The collagen tail of C1q appeared to mediate 
chemotaxis. gC1qR, a C1q-binding protein, has recently been reported to 
participate in C1q-mediated chemotaxis of murine mast cells and human 
eosinophils. We observed that gC1qR enhanced binding of free C1q to adherent 
neutrophils and promoted C1q-mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils by nearly 
seven-fold. Our results suggests C1q-mediated chemotaxis involves gC1qR as well 
as G-protein-coupled signal-transduction mechanisms operating downstream to 
neutrophil chemotaxis.
