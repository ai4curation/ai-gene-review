The function of cytosolic AtHsp90.3 was characterized by complementing the 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae endogenous Hsp90 genes and overexpressing it in 
Arabidopsis thaliana. Though AtHsp90.3 supported the yeast growth under heat 
stress, in Arabidopsis, compared to the wild type, the transgenic plants 
overexpressing cytosolic AtHsp90.3 were more sensitive to heat stress with a 
lower germination rate and higher mortality but and more tolerant to high 
Ca(2+). Transcriptional expression of heat stress transcription factors, 
AtHsfA1d, AtHsfA7a and AtHsfB1, and two Hsps, AtHsp101 and AtHsp17, was delayed 
by constitutive overexpression of cytosolic AtHsp90.3 under heat stress. These 
results indicate that overexpressing AtHsp90.3 impaired plant tolerance to heat 
stress and proper homeostasis of Hsp90 was critical for cellular stress response 
and/or tolerance in plants.
