BRCA1 interacts in vivo with a novel protein, BACH1, a member of the DEAH 
helicase family. BACH1 binds directly to the BRCT repeats of BRCA1. A BACH1 
derivative, bearing a mutation in a residue that was essential for catalytic 
function in other helicases, interfered with normal double-strand break repair 
in a manner that was dependent on its BRCA1 binding function. Thus, BACH1/BRCA1 
complex formation contributes to a key BRCA1 activity. In addition, germline 
BACH1 mutations affecting the helicase domain were detected in two early-onset 
breast cancer patients and not in 200 matched controls. Thus, it is conceivable 
that, like BRCA1, BACH1 is a target of germline cancer-inducing mutations.

## Full Text

G-quadruplex (G4) DNA or RNA poses a unique nucleic acid structure in genomic transactions. Because of the unique topology presented by G4, cells have exquisite mechanisms and pathways to metabolize G4 that arise in guanine-rich regions of the genome such as telomeres, promoter regions, ribosomal DNA, and other chromosomal elements. G4 resolvases are often represented by a class of molecular motors known as helicases that disrupt the Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in G4 by harnessing the chemical energy of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis. Of special interest to researchers in the field, including us, is the human FANCJ DNA helicase that efficiently resolves G4 DNA structures. Notably, FANCJ mutations are linked to Fanconi Anemia and are prominent in breast and ovarian cancer. Since our discovery that FANCJ efficiently resolves G4 DNA structures 15 years ago, we and other labs have characterized mechanistic aspects of FANCJ-catalyzed G4 resolution and its biological importance in genomic integrity and cellular DNA replication. In addition to its G4 resolvase function, FANCJ is also a classic DNA helicase that acts on conventional duplex DNA structures, which are relevant to the enzymeâ€™s role in interstrand cross link repair, double-strand break repair via homologous recombination, and response to replication stress. Here, we describe detailed procedures for the purification of recombinant FANCJ protein and characterization of its G4 resolvase and duplex DNA helicase activity.
