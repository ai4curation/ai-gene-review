BRCA1 interacts in vivo with a novel protein, BACH1, a member of the DEAH 
helicase family. BACH1 binds directly to the BRCT repeats of BRCA1. A BACH1 
derivative, bearing a mutation in a residue that was essential for catalytic 
function in other helicases, interfered with normal double-strand break repair 
in a manner that was dependent on its BRCA1 binding function. Thus, BACH1/BRCA1 
complex formation contributes to a key BRCA1 activity. In addition, germline 
BACH1 mutations affecting the helicase domain were detected in two early-onset 
breast cancer patients and not in 200 matched controls. Thus, it is conceivable 
that, like BRCA1, BACH1 is a target of germline cancer-inducing mutations.

Abstract

G-quadruplex (G4) DNA or RNA poses a unique nucleic acid structure in genomic transactions. Because of the unique topology presented by G4, cells have exquisite mechanisms and pathways to metabolize G4 that arise in guanine-rich regions of the genome such as telomeres, promoter regions, ribosomal DNA, and other chromosomal elements. G4 resolvases are often represented by a class of molecular motors known as helicases that disrupt the Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in G4 by harnessing the chemical energy of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis. Of special interest to researchers in the field, including us, is the human FANCJ DNA helicase that efficiently resolves G4 DNA structures. Notably, FANCJ mutations are linked to Fanconi Anemia and are prominent in breast and ovarian cancer. Since our discovery that FANCJ efficiently resolves G4 DNA structures 15 years ago, we and other labs have characterized mechanistic aspects of FANCJ-catalyzed G4 resolution and its biological importance in genomic integrity and cellular DNA replication. In addition to its G4 resolvase function, FANCJ is also a classic DNA helicase that acts on conventional duplex DNA structures, which are relevant to the enzyme’s role in interstrand cross link repair, double-strand break repair via homologous recombination, and response to replication stress. Here, we describe detailed procedures for the purification of recombinant FANCJ protein and characterization of its G4 resolvase and duplex DNA helicase activity.

INTRODUCTION

A surge of interest in the biological roles of alternatively structured nucleic acids deviating from the conventional B-form DNA double helix over recent decades has prompted a plethora of biochemical, genetic and cell biological research studies and lines of investigation ( Wang & Vasquez, 2023 ). DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes (G4), stabilized by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds and a central monovalent cation (typically Na + or K + ), have attracted notoriety as the field comes to appreciate even more how these guanine-rich four-stranded DNA or RNA configurations impact nucleic acid metabolism at multiple levels, i.e., genomic stability, DNA replication and repair, recombination, transcriptional regulation and translational efficiency ( Varshney et al., 2020 ). Our lab has been particularly interested in the biological importance of G4 nucleic acid metabolic pathways involving G4-resolving helicases that utilize the chemical energy of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis to disrupt the G4 structure ( Estep et al., 2019 ; Liu et al., 2021 ; Mendoza et al., 2016 ; Sato & Knipscheer, 2023 ; Sauer & Paeschke, 2017 ). In a much broader sense, helicases are molecular motors that harness the chemical energy of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis to fuel the mechanical energy of disrupting noncovalent hydrogen bonds to alter the conformations of structured nucleic acids, and have been studied in various biochemical, biophysical, structural and biological contexts for nearly a half century ( Brosh & Matson, 2020 ).

In this special Methods in Enzymology series dedicated to G-quadruplexes, we will focus on a prominent G4-resolving helicase designated FANCJ/BRIP1/BACH1, first discovered by its protein interaction with the tumor suppressor BRCA1 ( Cantor et al., 2001 ). Bi-allelic mutations in FANCJ are linked to the progressive bone marrow failure disorder Fanconi Anemia (FA) in which individuals are highly predisposed to cancer( Levitus et al., 2005 ; Levran et al., 2005 ; Litman et al., 2005 ). In addition, somatic mutations in FANCJ are associated with cancer, particularly the breast and ovary( Calvo et al., 2021 ), suggesting its classification as a tumor suppressor gene. Indeed, FANCJ interacts with a growing number of proteins important for genomic stability, DNA repair and the response to replication stress( Brosh & Wu, 2021 ; Cantor & Nayak, 2016 ) ( Fig. 1A ). There continues to be much research activity to fully characterize FANCJ’s role in cellular DNA metabolism and maintenance of genomic stability. Currently, there are four prominent DNA metabolic pathways involving FANCJ: G4 DNA synthesis bypass, double-strand break (DSB) repair, interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair, and permissive replication ( Fig. 1B ).

Fifteen years ago, we discovered that FANCJ biochemically resolves intermolecular G4 DNA structures and provided the first experimental evidence that FANCJ-catalyzed G4 resolution is critical for genomic stability, suppression of DNA damage induced by G4 ligands, and efficient DNA replication in human cells ( Wu et al., 2008 ). We also confirmed the original observations by Cantor et al. that FANCJ catalytically unwinds duplex DNA structures in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner ( Cantor et al., 2004 ), and extended these observations to characterize FANCJ’s substrate specificity ( Gupta et al., 2005 ). In subsequent studies, we analyzed FANCJ helicase activity mechanistically and determined that its optimal catalytic activity for unwinding duplex DNA substrates is achieved as a dimer ( Wu et al., 2012 ), and characterized how FANCJ’s helicase activity is affected by various forms of DNA damage ( Gupta et al., 2006 ; Khan et al., 2014 ; Suhasini et al., 2009 ; Suhasini et al., 2012 ), which together provided new insights to its mechanism of action. These findings bear significance as it was suggested in an early study that FANCJ only acts upon G4 structures ( London et al., 2008 ), which turned out to be inconsistent with findings from our group (see ( Gupta et al., 2005 ) and references herein) and others ( Odermatt et al., 2020 ; Wu & Spies, 2016 ), who also characterized FANCJ’s duplex DNA helicase activity. Therefore, in this Methods in Enzymology paper we describe step-by-step biochemical assays to purify recombinant human FANCJ protein using a baculovirus system with insect cells and analyze FANCJ resolution of G4 substrates as well as FANCJ helicase activity on more conventional forked duplex DNA substrates.

Beyond the characterization of FANCJ’s ability to resolve G4 DNA substrates and unwind partial duplex DNA substrates, we have determined that FANCJ uses its motor ATPase function to disrupt triplex DNA and efficiently remove proteins bound to DNA ( Sommers et al., 2014 ; Sommers et al., 2009 ). In addition, we found that FANCJ catalytically branch-migrates three-stranded DNA substrates that represent a critical early intermediate of homologous recombination (HR) which occurs during DSB repair ( Awate et al., 2020 ). In the broader context, FANCJ’s role in genome biology involves not only its catalytic activities but also its protein interactions with key factors that facilitate the processing of DNA repair and replication intermediates ( Fig. 1 ). Some proteins (e.g., RPA ( Gupta et al., 2007 ), MSH2/6( Wu et al., 2008 )) regulate FANCJ’s catalytic functions, including it G4 DNA resolvase activity. An important work from the Spies’ lab ( Wu & Spies, 2016 ) determined that FANCJ’s G4-binding pocket overlaps with its MLH1 protein interaction site( Peng et al., 2007 ), suggesting that the regulation of FANCJ’s roles in cellular DNA metabolism is complex and involves both binding to DNA structure and DNA repair machinery, sometimes at the same site in FANCJ. In addition, FANCJ undergoes site-specific post-translational modifications that affect its protein interactions and biological functions in DNA repair ( Gong et al., 2010 ; Nath & Nagaraju, 2020 ; Xie et al., 2012 ; Yu et al., 2003 ), indicating a higher tier of modulation ( Fig. 1 ).

From a G4 biology and nucleic acids transactions perspective, it is very satisfying to witness FANCJ’s characterization as a quintessential G4 resolvase, as demonstrated by single-molecule studies in vitro ( Bharti et al., 2018 ; Wu & Spies, 2016 ) and in a biological context via the implementation of reconstituted or genetic model systems to further elucidate the importance of FANCJ’s G4 resolvase activity to allow smooth DNA synthesis during replication ( Castillo Bosch et al., 2014 ; Lee et al., 2021 ; Odermatt et al., 2020 ). Given the strong interest in FANCJ’s biochemical activities and cellular roles in DNA metabolism, we believe that a detailed methods-oriented description of recombinant FANCJ protein expression/purification and characterization of its G4 resolvase and duplex DNA helicase activity is important and timely. The methods provided should be useful as a guide for developing a robust purification method of other G4-resolving enzymes using the affinity tag described, and the characterization of their catalytic activities, keeping in mind that optimal reaction conditions and substrate specificity may differ among helicase proteins. For example, we determined that FANCJ has a distinctive ability to efficiently resolve entropically favored intramolecular G4 substrates that certain other Fe-S cluster helicases are poorly active upon ( Bharti et al., 2013 ). Therefore, in the procedural sections below we provide detailed information for preparing various G4 DNA substrates, including uni-molecular, bi-molecular, and tetra-molecular G4 DNA substrates, and describe assays we used to detect and quantitate resolution of the substrates with the various G4 topologies by purified recombinant FANCJ protein. In addition, the described purification scheme for recombinant FANCJ and battery of substrates/assays to characterize its catalytic function can be useful for the characterization of disease relevant FANCJ mutant proteins, which we have reported ( Bharti et al., 2018 ; Gupta et al., 2006 ; Wu et al., 2012 ; Wu et al., 2010 ).
