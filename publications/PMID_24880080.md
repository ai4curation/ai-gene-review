Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a highly conserved molecular chaperone that 
facilitates the maturation of a wide range of proteins, and it has been 
recognized as a crucial facilitator of oncogene addiction and cancer cell 
survival. Although HSP90 function is regulated by a variety of 
post-translational modifications, the physiological significance of methylation 
has not fully been elucidated. Here we demonstrate that HSP90AB1 is methylated 
by the histone methyltransferase SMYD2 and that it plays a critical role in 
human carcinogenesis. HSP90AB1 and SMYD2 can interact through the C-terminal 
region of HSP90AB1 and the SET domain of SMYD2. Both in vitro and in vivo 
methyltransferase assays revealed that SMYD2 could methylate HSP90AB1 and mass 
spectrometry analysis indicated lysines 531 and 574 of HSP90AB1 to be 
methylated. These methylation sites were shown to be important for the 
dimerization and chaperone complex formation of HSP90AB1. Furthermore, 
methylated HSP90AB1 accelerated the proliferation of cancer cells. Our study 
reveals a novel mechanism for human carcinogenesis via methylation of HSP90AB1 
by SMYD2, and additional functional studies may assist in developing novel 
strategies for cancer therapy.
