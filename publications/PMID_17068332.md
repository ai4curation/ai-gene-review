The zinc finger protein ZPR1 is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. 
Cell cycle analysis demonstrates that ZPR1 undergoes major changes in 
subcellular distribution during proliferation. ZPR1 is diffusely localized 
throughout the cell during the G(1) and G(2)/M phases of the cell cycle. In 
contrast, ZPR1 redistributes to the nucleus during S phase and ZPR1 exhibits 
prominent co-localization with the survival motor neurons protein and the 
histone gene-specific transcription factor NPAT in subnuclear foci, including 
Cajal bodies that associate with histone gene clusters. ZPR1 deficiency causes 
disruption of survival motor neurons and NPAT localization within the nucleus, 
blocks S phase progression, and arrests cells in both the G(1) and G(2) phases 
of the cell cycle. These changes in subnuclear architecture and cell cycle 
progression may be caused by transcriptional defects in ZPR1-deficient cells, 
including decreased histone gene expression.
