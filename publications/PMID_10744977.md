The RAD52 epistasis group was identified in yeast as a group of genes required 
to repair DNA damaged by ionizing radiation [1]. Genetic evidence indicates that 
Rad52 functions in Rad51-dependent and Rad51-independent recombination pathways 
[2] [3] [4]. Consistent with this, purified yeast and human Rad52 proteins have 
been shown to promote single-strand DNA annealing [5] [6] [7] and to stimulate 
Rad51-mediated homologous pairing [8] [9] [10] [11]. Electron microscopic 
examinations of the yeast [12] and human [13] Rad52 proteins have revealed their 
assembly into ring-like structures in vitro. Using both conventional 
transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy 
(STEM), we found that the human Rad52 protein forms heptameric rings. A 
three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction revealed that the heptamer has a large 
central channel. Like the hexameric helicases such as Escherichia coli DnaB [14] 
[15], bacteriophage T7 gp4b [16] [17], simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen 
[18] and papilloma virus E1 [19], the Rad52 rings show a distinctly chiral 
arrangement of subunits. Thus, the structures formed by the hexameric helicases 
may be a more general property of other proteins involved in DNA metabolism, 
including those, such as Rad52, that do not bind and hydrolyze ATP.
