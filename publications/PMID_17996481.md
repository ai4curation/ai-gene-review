Thrombospondin-1, an antiangiogenic matricellular protein, binds with high 
affinity to the angiogenic fibroblast growth factor-2, affecting its 
bioavailability and activity. The present work aimed at further locating the 
fibroblast growth factor-2 binding site of thrombospondin-1 and investigating 
its activity, using recombinant thrombospondin-1 proteins. Only recombinant 
constructs containing the thrombospondin-1 type III repeats bound fibroblast 
growth factor-2, whereas other domains, including the known anti-angiogenic type 
I repeats, were inactive. Binding was specific and inhibited by the anti 
thrombospondin-1 monoclonal antibody B5.2. Surface plasmon resonance analysis on 
BIAcore revealed a binding affinity (K(d)) of 310nM for the type III repeats and 
11nM for intact thrombospondin-1. Since the type III repeats bind calcium, the 
effect of calcium on thrombospondin-1 binding to fibroblast growth factor-2 was 
investigated. Binding was modulated by calcium, as thrombospondin-1 or the type 
III repeats bound to fibroblast growth factor-2 only in calcium concentrations 
<0.3mM. The type III repeats inhibited binding of fibroblast growth factor-2 to 
endothelial cells, fibroblast growth factor-2-induced endothelial cell 
proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane assay in 
vivo, thus indicating the antiangiogenic activity of the domain. In conclusion, 
this study demonstrates that the fibroblast growth factor-2 binding site of 
thrombospondin-1 is located in the type III repeats. The finding that this 
domain is active in inhibiting angiogenesis indicates that the type III repeats 
represent a novel antiangiogenic domain of thrombospondin-1.

INTRODUCTION

Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a matricellular protein ( Bornstein, 2001 ). Through its modular structure, it binds simultaneously to cell surface receptors, matrix components, proteolytic enzymes, cytokines and growth factors, modulating the cell response to the environment ( Bornstein & Sage, 2002 ). As with other matricellular proteins, TSP-1 is involved in complex biological processes including development, response to injury and several pathologies. It plays a complex role in physiological and pathological angiogenesis, particularly in tumor angiogenesis and consequently in tumor progression ( Lawler & Detmar, 2004 ).

TSP-1 belongs to a family of 5 related vertebrate proteins ( Adams & Lawler, 2004 ). It is a homotrimer. Each monomer consists of an N-terminal globular module, followed by the coiled-coil oligomerization domain, a procollagen module, three properdin-like type I repeats, the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like type II repeats, the type III repeats, and the C-terminal globular domain. The type I repeats, which are present in TSP-1, TSP-2 and many other molecules, are responsible for most of the antiangiogenic activities ( Lawler & Detmar, 2004 ).

Sequence identity/homology among the 5 TSPs is highest at the C-terminal end. Thus, the most conserved region among TSPs is the carboxy-terminal cassette - consisting of the type II and type III repeats and the C-terminal globular end - considered the hallmark of all TSPs ( Adams, 2004 ). The type III, aspartate-rich repeats constitute the calcium-binding domain of TSPs. Several active sequences have been mapped in this domain ( Adams, 2004 ), including the cell adhesion RGD sequence, the binding sites for neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G ( Hogg, 1994 ), and attachments site for neutrophils ( Majluf-Cruz et al., 2000 ) and sickle red blood cells ( Watkins, Du, Scott, Ouwehand & Hillery, 2003 ).

TSP-1 directly binds to growth factors and angiogenesis regulatory factors, including fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) ( Taraboletti et al., 1997 ), transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), and Tat (reviewed in( Rusnati & Presta, 2006 )). Binding of TSP-1 to growth factors affects their location, activation, and biological activity. We previously reported that binding of TSP-1 to FGF-2 affects the growth factor’s interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, ultimately affecting FGF-2 bioavailability and activity ( Margosio et al., 2003 ; Taraboletti et al., 1997 ).

Our previous studies indicated that the FGF-2 binding site is located in the 140-kDa carboxy-terminal fragment of TSP-1 ( Taraboletti et al., 1997 ). In the present study we used recombinant portions of TSP-1 to further locate the FGF-2 binding site of TSP-1 and to investigate the activity of the identified domain in FGF-2-induced angiogenesis.

DISCUSSION

TSP-1 directly binds to growth factors, including FGF-2 ( Margosio et al., 2003 ; Taraboletti et al., 1997 ). In this study, by using recombinant portions of TSP-1, we have shown that the FGF-2-binding site is located in the type III repeats, and that this domain is active in inhibiting FGF-2 angiogenic activity. The major antiangiogenic site of TSP-1 has been localized in the type I repeats. Our findings therefore provide evidence of the presence of a different, novel antiangiogenic site of TSP-1, located on a different domain.

The type III repeats, together with the EGF-like type II repeats and the carboxy terminal globular end, constitutes the most conserved portion of TSPs. The most remarkable activity discerned for the repeats to date has been cooperative binding of calcium ions ( Adams, 2004 ). Analysis of the crystal structure of type III repeat-containing proteins has revealed a peculiar protein “wire” structure organized around a metal core ( Carlson et al., 2005 ; Kvansakul, Adams & Hohenester, 2004 ). Up to 30 calcium ions bind each TSP-1 or TSP-2 subunit ( Hannah, Misenheimer, Pranghofer & Mosher, 2004 ; Kvansakul, Adams & Hohenester, 2004 ). Some of the bound calciums are not readily exchangeable in equilibrium dialysis experiments ( Misenheimer, Hannah, Annis & Mosher, 2003 ). We found that calcium-saturated TSP-1, E3Ca-1 and Ca-1 did not bind to FGF-2. The finding that the transitions for binding of E3Ca-1 and Ca-1 to FGF-2 and alterations of secondary structure occur over the same ranges of calcium concentration indicates that TSP-1/FGF-2 binding requires the type III repeats to be in a calcium-depleted structure. Nevertheless, the presence of EDTA, which presumably removes all bound calcium and causes maximal loss of structure, abolished binding of FGF-2 to TSP-1 or E3Ca-1. This finding implies that TSP-1/FGF-2 binding is controlled by a structural change of TSP-1 that is induced by reduction in calcium ion concentration in the environment but requires the presence of residual bound calcium.

Other activities of TSP type III repeats are regulated by calcium, including attachment of neutrophils ( Majluf-Cruz et al., 2000 ) and binding to collagen ( Galvin, Vance, Dixit, Fink & Frazier, 1987 ), neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G ( Hogg, 1994 ). In most cases, the induced activity is ascribed to a calcium-dependent structural modification that allows the exposure of the active site ( Kvansakul, Adams & Hohenester, 2004 ). Similarly, it is conceivable that the FGF-2 binding site is cryptic in calcium-saturated TSP-1, and becomes exposed in low calcium concentrations, supporting the concept that the readily exchangeable calcium ions have a critical role in controlling TSP structure and functions ( Adams, 2004 ).

In experimental settings, calcium loading of TSP-1 is modulated by varying the calcium concentration in the environment. Little is known about the physiological mechanisms that regulate calcium loading of TSP in vivo. The local concentration of extracellular calcium undergoes dynamic fluctuations under physiological conditions, and in highly specialized tissues calcium concentrations transiently drop to levels compatible with the TSP/FGF binding ( Hofer, 2005 ). However, the actual relevance of local calcium fluctuation (for example in the tumor environment) in determining the ability of TSP-1 to bind to FGF-2 still remains to be elucidated. Besides calcium, other factors can induce the exposure of active TSP sequences, by altering the tertiary structure of the type III repeats. The status of disulphide bonds between consecutive type III repeats regulates the exposure of the RGD sequence ( Kvansakul, Adams & Hohenester, 2004 ) and the binding sites for neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G ( Hogg, 1994 ). The conformation of TSP type III repeats is also affected by the binding of certain molecules to TSP, even at sites distant from this domain ( Dardik & Lahav, 1999 ; Watkins, Du, Scott, Ouwehand & Hillery, 2003 ). Altogether, these considerations suggest that the exposure of the FGF-2 binding site is achieved through both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent mechanisms.

Binding of TSP-1 to FGF-2 prevents the growth factor interaction with HSPG on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix ( Margosio et al., 2003 ; Taraboletti et al., 1997 ). Since HSPG modulate the activity of heparin-binding factors ( Iozzo, 2005 ) the binding of TSP-1 to FGF-2 might have important biological consequences. Indeed we previously found that the interaction of TSP-1 with FGF-2 prevented FGF-2 binding to endothelial cells, internalization, interaction with the extracellular matrix and proliferative activity ( Margosio et al., 2003 ; Taraboletti et al., 1997 ). In agreement, in this study we have found that the FGF-2 binding type III repeat inhibit FGF-2 binding to endothelial cells and FGF-2-induced endothelial cell proliferation, suggesting that this domain has the potential to affect the growth factor bioavailability and activity. The finding that the type III repeat prevent FGF-2-induced angiogenesis in the CAM further point to a role for this domain in angiogenesis.

This study further indicates that the activity of TSP-1 depends on the environmental conditions. Local fluctuations of calcium concentration, the presence of TSP-1-degrading proteases, TSP-1 ligands or receptors might modulate the bioavailability of functional sites of TSP-1, dictating the final effect of TSP-1 on cell invasion, adhesion and angiogenesis. The complex role of TSP-1 in angiogenesis - through the proangiogenic N-terminal domain or the anti-angiogenic type I and type III repeats - has been analyzed in several experimental models, including angiogenesis assays in the CAM and cornea (this study and ( Taraboletti et al., 2000 )). The isolated, recombinant domains provide a useful tool to dissect the role of each domain in various experimental conditions, and will help clarify the impact of TSP-1 on angiogenesis in different settings, including tumor angiogenesis.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the presence of a novel FGF-2-binding antiangiogenic site in the TSP-1 type III repeats. Binding to FGF-2 is affected by local conformational changes induced by calcium concentration. Moreover, we have found that this domain is active in inhibiting FGF-2-induced angiogenesis. Additional investigations are warranted to fully clarify the relevance of the FGF-2 /type III repeats interaction in the physiological and pathological roles of thrombospondin.
