In the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, activin A, 
TGF-beta1, and bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP-4) have various effects on 
hematopoiesis, including early mesodermo-hematogenesis. After these cytokines 
bind to their respective receptor, a regulatory Smad is phosphorylated and 
becomes associated with Smad4, the common Smad, and the resulting complex 
translocates to the nucleus to regulate transcription. DLX1 is the product of a 
member of the distal-less homeobox gene family, which is known to have important 
roles in embryogenesis, particularly in craniofacial development, and in 
GABAergic neurogenesis. DLX1 has been reported to be temporally and spatially 
coexpressed with BMP-4 during embryogenesis in selected contexts. We report here 
that, in addition to the previously reported regions/cells, DLX1 is expressed in 
hematopoietic cells in a lineage-dependent manner and that DLX1 interacts with 
Smad4 through its homeodomain. We show that it blocks multiple signals from 
TGF-beta superfamily cytokines such as activin A, TGF-beta1, and BMP-4, 
including differentiation of a hematopoietic cell line by activin A. Taken 
together, these data suggest that DLX1 may function as a regulator of multiple 
signals from TGF-beta superfamily members in broad biological contexts during 
blood production.
