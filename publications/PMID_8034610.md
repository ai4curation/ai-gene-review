Members of the Hsp60 chaperonin family, such as Escherichia coli GroEL/S and the 
eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin complex, TRiC (TCP ring complex), are double 
toroid complexes capable of assisting the folding of proteins in vitro in an 
ATP-dependent fashion. TRiC differs from the GroEL chaperonin in that it has a 
hetero rather than homo-oligomeric subunit composition and lacks a GroES-like 
regulatory cofactor. We have established greater than 57% identity between a 
protein encoded by the TCP20 gene from a human cDNA library and the newly 
identified protein encoded by the TCP20 gene located on the right arm of 
chromosome IV of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These Tcp20 proteins showed 
approximately 30% identity to Tcp1, a known subunit of TRiC. Gel filtration, 
followed by Western analysis of purified bovine testis TRiC with a 
Tcp20-specific antibody, indicated that Tcp20 is a subunit of the 
hetero-oligomeric TRiC. Gene disruption experiments showed that TCP20, like 
TCP1, is an essential gene in yeast, consistent with the view that TRiC is 
required for folding of key proteins. The amino acid sequence similarities and 
the derived evolutionary relationships established that the human and yeast 
Tcp20 proteins represent members of a new family of subunits of TRiC 
chaperonins.
