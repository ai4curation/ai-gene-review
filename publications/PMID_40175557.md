The human spastizin (spastic paraplegia 15, SPG15) and spatacsin (spastic 
paraplegia 11, SPG11) complex is involved in the formation of lysosomes, and 
mutations in these two proteins are linked with hereditary autosomal-recessive 
spastic paraplegia. SPG11-SPG15 can cooperate with the fifth adaptor protein 
complex (AP5) involved in membrane sorting of late endosomes. We employed 
cryogenic-electron microscopy and in silico predictions to investigate the 
structural assemblies of the SPG11-SPG15 and AP5-SPG11-SPG15 complexes. The 
W-shaped SPG11-SPG15 intertwined in a head-to-head fashion, and the N-terminal 
region of SPG11 is required for AP5 complex interaction and assembly. The AP5 
complex is in a super-open conformation. Our findings reveal that the 
AP5-SPG11-SPG15 complex can bind PI3P molecules, sense membrane curvature and 
drive membrane remodeling in vitro. These studies provide insights into the 
structure and function of the spastic paraplegia AP5-SPG11-SPG15 complex, which 
is essential for the initiation of autolysosome tubulation.
