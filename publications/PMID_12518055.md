Protein folding in the cell involves the action of different molecular 
chaperones and folding-facilitating enzymes. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 
the folding status of glycoproteins is stringently controlled by a 
glucosyltranferase enzyme (GT) that creates monoglucosylated structures 
recognized by ER resident lectins (calnexincalreticulin, CNXCRT). GT serves as a 
folding sensor because it only glucosylates misfolded or partly folded 
glycoproteins. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism behind this recognition 
process remains largely unknown. In this paper we explore the structural 
determinants for GT recognition by using a single domain model protein. For this 
purpose we used a family of chemically glycosylated proteins derived from 
chymotrypsin inhibitor-2 as GT substrates. Structural characterization of 
species showing higher glucose acceptor capacity suggests that GT recognizes 
solvent accessible hydrophobic patches in molten globule-like conformers 
mimicking intermediate folding stages of nascent glycoproteins. It was further 
confirmed that BiP (binding protein, a chaperone of the heat shock protein 70 
family) preferentially recognized neoglycoproteins displaying extended 
conformations, thus providing a molecular rationale for the sequential 
BiP-CNXCRT interaction with folding glycoproteins observed in vivo.
