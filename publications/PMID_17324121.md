The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan is important in many tissuerepair processes. We 
have investigated the synthesis of hyaluronan in a panel of cell lines of 
fibroblastic and epithelial origin in response to PDGF (platelet-derived growth 
factor)-BB and other growth factors. Human dermal fibroblasts exhibited the 
highest hyaluronan-synthesizing activity in response to PDGF-BB. Analysis of HAS 
(hyaluronan synthase) and HYAL (hyaluronidase) mRNA expression showed that 
PDGF-BB treatment induced a 3-fold increase in the already high level of HAS2 
mRNA, and increases in HAS1 and HYAL1 mRNA, whereas the levels of HAS3 and HYAL2 
mRNA were not affected. Furthermore, PDGF-BB also increased the amount and 
activity of HAS2 protein, but not of HYAL1 and HYAL2 proteins. Using inhibitors 
for MEK1/2 [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK 
(extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) kinase 1/2] (U0126) and for PI3K 
(phosphoinositide 3-kinase) (LY294002), as well as the SN50 inhibitor, which 
prevents translocation of the active NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) to the 
nucleus, we observed a complete inhibition of both HAS2 transcriptional activity 
and hyaluronan synthesis, whereas inhibitors of other signalling pathways were 
without any significant effect. TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1) did 
not increase the activity of hyaluronan synthesis in dermal fibroblasts, but 
increased the activity of HYALs. Importantly, inhibition of hyaluronan binding 
to its receptor CD44 by the monoclonal antibody Hermes-1, inhibited 
PDGF-BB-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation of dermal fibroblasts. We 
conclude that the ERK MAPK and PI3K signalling pathways are necessary for the 
regulation of hyaluronan synthesis by PDGF-BB, and that prevention of its 
binding to CD44 inhibits PDGF-BB-induced cell growth.
