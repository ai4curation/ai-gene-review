The murine Pten prostate cancer model described in this study recapitulates the 
disease progression seen in humans: initiation of prostate cancer with prostatic 
intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), followed by progression to invasive 
adenocarcinoma, and subsequent metastasis with defined kinetics. Furthermore, 
while Pten null prostate cancers regress after androgen ablation, they are 
capable of proliferating in the absence of androgen. Global assessment of 
molecular changes caused by homozygous Pten deletion identified key genes known 
to be relevant to human prostate cancer, including those "signature" genes 
associated with human cancer metastasis. This murine prostate cancer model 
provides a unique tool for both exploring the molecular mechanism underlying 
prostate cancer and for development of new targeted therapies.
