The tumor suppressor gene product p53 can activate and repress transcription. 
Both transcriptional activation and repression are thought to involve the direct 
interaction of p53 with the basal transcriptional machinery. Previous work has 
demonstrated an in vitro interaction between p53 and the TATA-binding protein 
that requires amino acids 20 to 57 of p53 and amino acids 220 to 271 of the 
TATA-binding protein. The present results show that a 75-amino-acid segment from 
the carboxy terminus of p53 also can bind to the TATA-binding protein in vitro, 
and this interaction requires amino acids 217 to 268 of the TATA-binding 
protein, essentially the same domain that is required for interaction with the 
amino-terminal domain of p53. A carboxy-terminal segment of p53 can mediate 
repression when bound to DNA as a GAL4-p53 fusion protein. The amino- and 
carboxy-terminal p53 interactions occur within the domain on the TATA-binding 
protein to which the adenovirus 13S E1A oncoprotein has previously been shown to 
bind. The 13S E1A oncoprotein can dissociate the complex formed between the 
carboxy-terminal domain of p53 and the TATA-binding protein and relieve 
p53-mediated transcriptional repression. These results demonstrate that two 
independent domains of p53 can potentially interact with the TATA-binding 
protein, and they define a mechanism--relief of repression--by which the 13S E1A 
oncoprotein can activate transcription through the TATA motif.
