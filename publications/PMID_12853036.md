Testican-1 is a highly conserved, multidomain, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 
that is most abundantly transcribed in the brain by neurons. This testican 
messenger RNA is not detected in normal quiescent astrocytes, but is up 
regulated when these cells are activated in response to injury such as cerebral 
stroke. Other chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans found in glial scars, including 
neurocan, have been shown to inhibit neural cell attachment and neurite 
extensions and may thus impede axonal regeneration. Here we report the 
expression and purification of a proteoglycan form of recombinant testican and 
its effects on neuron-derived cells in culture. We demonstrate that testican 
inhibits attachment of Neuro-2a cells and their ability to form neurite 
extensions. Both testican proteoglycan and the core glycoprotein that has been 
depleted of chondroitin sulfate inhibit cell attachment. Pre-treatment of the 
culture substratum with testican inhibits Neuro-2a attachment, but pre-treatment 
of the cells with testican does not inhibit their attachment. Testican, 
therefore, blocks attachment sites on cultureware and may also block attachment 
sites in the extracellular matrix of the brain.
