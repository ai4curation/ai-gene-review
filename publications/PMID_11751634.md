Histone methylation is known to be associated with both transcriptionally active 
and repressive chromatin states. Recent studies have identified SET 
domain-containing proteins such as SUV39H1 and Clr4 as mediators of H3 lysine 9 
(Lys9) methylation and heterochromatin formation. Interestingly, H3 Lys9 
methylation is not observed from bulk histones isolated from asynchronous 
populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Tetrahymena thermophila. In contrast, 
H3 lysine 4 (Lys4) methylation is a predominant modification in these smaller 
eukaryotes. To identify the responsible methyltransferase(s) and to gain insight 
into the function of H3 Lys4 methylation, we have developed a histone H3 Lys4 
methyl-specific antiserum. With this antiserum, we show that deletion of SET1, 
but not of other putative SET domain-containing genes, in S. cerevisiae, results 
in the complete abolishment of H3 Lys4 methylation in vivo. Furthermore, loss of 
H3 Lys4 methylation in a set1 Delta strain can be rescued by SET1. Analysis of 
histone H3 mutations at Lys4 revealed a slow-growth defect similar to a set1 
Delta strain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that H3 Lys4 methylation 
is present at the rDNA locus and that Set1-mediated H3 Lys4 methylation is 
required for repression of RNA polymerase II transcription within rDNA. Taken 
together, these data suggest that Set1-mediated H3 Lys4 methylation is required 
for normal cell growth and transcriptional silencing.
