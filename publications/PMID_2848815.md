The receptor for human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was isolated from 
a subclone of the human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937. These cells exhibit 
a single class of high affinity receptors (Kd = 0.51 +/- 0.25 nM) with an 
average density of 55,000 +/- 5,000 binding sites/cell. After solubilization 
with detergent, the receptor retained its ability to bind free TNF-alpha but 
failed to bind to TNF-alpha immobilized on various solid supports. For receptor 
purification, 125I-TNF-alpha was covalently attached to the receptor on intact 
cells by the bifunctional cross-linking reagents ethylene 
glycolbis(succinimidylsuccinate) or 3,3-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate). 
The cells were then solubilized with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100, and 
the supernatants, clarified by centrifugation, were passed over an IgG-Sepharose 
column prepared from TNF-alpha antiserum. The receptor-rich fraction from the 
antibody column was further purified by preparative sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These two steps together provided 
approximately 165,000-fold purification of the TNF-alpha receptor. The TNF-alpha 
receptor-ligand complex obtained by this method had a subunit molecular weight 
of 100,000 +/- 5,000 when examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis but on gel filtration the complex migrated with an apparent 
molecular weight of 480,000 +/- 32,000. However, the receptor showed a molecular 
weight of 65,000 +/- 32,000 when gel filtration was performed in the absence of 
ligand. Additional characteristics of the receptor are discussed.
