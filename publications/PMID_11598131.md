Wnt-1-induced secreted protein 1 (WISP-1) is a member of the CCN (connective 
tissue growth factor, Cyr61, NOV) family of growth factors. Structural and 
experimental evidence suggests that CCN family member activities are modulated 
by their interaction with sulfated glycoconjugates. To elucidate the mechanism 
of action for WISP-1, we characterized the specificity of its tissue and 
cellular interaction and identified binding factors. WISP-1 binding was 
restricted to the stroma of colon tumors and to cells with a fibroblastic 
phenotype. By using a solid phase assay, we showed that human skin fibroblast 
conditioned media contained WISP-1 binding factors. Competitive inhibition with 
different glycosaminoglycans and treatment with glycosaminoglycan lyases and 
proteases demonstrated that binding to the conditioned media was mediated by 
dermatan sulfate proteoglycans. Mass spectrometric analysis identified the 
isolated binding factors as decorin and biglycan. Decorin and biglycan 
interacted directly with WISP-1 and inhibited its binding to components in the 
conditioned media. Similarly, WISP-1 interaction with human skin fibroblasts was 
inhibited by dermatan sulfate, decorin, and biglycan or by treatment of the cell 
surface with dermatan sulfate-specific lyases. Together these results 
demonstrate that decorin and biglycan are WISP-1 binding factors that can 
mediate and modulate its interaction with the surface of fibroblasts. We propose 
that this specific interaction plays a role in the regulation of WISP-1 
function.
