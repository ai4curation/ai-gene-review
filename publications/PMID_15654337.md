Proteins with polyglutamine (polyQ) expansions accumulate in the nucleus and 
affect gene expression. The mechanism by which mutant huntingtin (htt) 
accumulates intranuclearly is not known; wild-type htt, a 350-kDa protein of 
unknown function, is normally found in the cytoplasm. N-terminal fragments of 
mutant htt, which contain a polyQ expansion (>37 glutamines), have no conserved 
nuclear localization sequences or nuclear export sequences but can accumulate in 
the nucleus and cause neurological problems in transgenic mice. Here we report 
that N-terminal htt shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus in a Ran 
GTPase-independent manner. Small N-terminal htt fragments interact with the 
nuclear pore protein translocated promoter region (Tpr), which is involved in 
nuclear export. PolyQ expansion and aggregation decrease this interaction and 
increase the nuclear accumulation of htt. Reducing the expression of Tpr by RNA 
interference or deletion of ten amino acids of N-terminal htt, which are 
essential for the interaction of htt with Tpr, increased the nuclear 
accumulation of htt. These results suggest that Tpr has a role in the nuclear 
export of N-terminal htt and that polyQ expansion reduces this nuclear export to 
cause the nuclear accumulation of htt.
