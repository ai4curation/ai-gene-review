Myofibrillar myopathies (MFM) are progressive diseases of human heart and 
skeletal muscle with a severe impact on life quality and expectancy of affected 
patients. Although recently several disease genes for myofibrillar myopathies 
could be identified, today most genetic causes and particularly the associated 
mechanisms and signaling events that lead from the mutation to the disease 
phenotype are still mostly unknown. To assess whether the zebrafish is a 
suitable model system to validate MFM candidate genes using targeted 
antisense-mediated knock-down strategies, we here specifically inactivated known 
human MFM disease genes and evaluated the resulting muscular and cardiac 
phenotypes functionally and structurally. Consistently, targeted ablation of MFM 
genes in zebrafish led to compromised skeletal muscle function mostly due to 
myofibrillar degeneration as well as severe heart failure. Similar to what was 
shown in MFM patients, MFM gene-deficient zebrafish showed pronounced 
gene-specific phenotypic and structural differences. In summary, our results 
indicate that the zebrafish is a suitable model to functionally and structurally 
evaluate novel MFM disease genes in vivo.
