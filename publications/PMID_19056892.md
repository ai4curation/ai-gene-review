Loss of the CDK inhibitor p27(KIP1) is widely linked with poor prognosis in 
human cancer. In Wnt10b-expressing mammary tumors, levels of p27(KIP1) were 
extremely low; conversely, Wnt10b-null mammary cells expressed high levels of 
this protein, suggesting Wnt-dependent regulation of p27(KIP1). Interestingly we 
found that Wnt-induced turnover of p27(KIP1) was independent from classical 
SCF(SKP2)-mediated degradation in both mouse and human cells. Instead, turnover 
required Cullin 4A and Cullin 4B, components of an alternative E3 ubiquitin 
ligase induced in response to active Wnt signaling. We found that CUL4A was a 
novel Wnt target gene in both mouse and human cells and that CUL4A physically 
interacted with p27(KIP1) in Wnt-responding cells. We further demonstrated that 
both Cul4A and Cul4B were required for Wnt-induced p27(KIP1) degradation and 
S-phase progression. CUL4A and CUL4B are therefore components of a conserved 
Wnt-induced proteasome targeting (WIPT) complex that regulates p27(KIP1) levels 
and cell cycle progression in mammalian cells.

Abstract

Loss of the CDK inhibitor p27 KIP1 is widely linked with poor prognosis in human cancer. In Wnt10b -expressing mammary tumors, levels of p27 KIP1 were extremely low; conversely, Wnt10b -null mammary cells expressed high levels of this protein, suggesting Wnt -dependent regulation of p27 KIP1 . Interestingly we found that Wnt -induced turnover of p27 KIP1 was independent from classical SCF SKP2 -mediated degradation in both mouse and human cells. Instead, turnover required Cullin 4A and Cullin 4B , components of an alternative E3 ubiquitin ligase induced in response to active Wnt signaling. We found that CUL4A was a novel Wnt target gene in both mouse and human cells and that CUL4A physically interacted with p27 KIP1 in Wnt -responding cells. We further demonstrated that both Cul4A and Cul4B were required for Wnt -induced p27 KIP1 degradation and S-phase progression. CUL4A and CUL4B are therefore components of a conserved Wnt -induced proteasome targeting (WIPT) complex that regulates p27 KIP1 levels and cell cycle progression in mammalian cells.

Discussion

Wnt signaling regulates cell proliferation, cell fate, and stem cell maintenance in multiple tissues ( Cadigan and Nusse 1997 ). In addition, a clear link has been established between aberrant Wnt signaling and human cancer ( Clevers 2004 ). In the present study, we demonstrate that Wnt10b -mediated transformation of mammary epithelial cells is associated with nuclear localization of β-catenin and enhanced expression of several Wnt target genes and basal cell markers. Novel to this work was the observation that this pattern of gene expression was associated with post-translational loss of p27 KIP1 in S-phase cells. This turnover of p27 KIP1 was shown to be independent of CRM1 function and to occur in the absence of SKP2. Subsequently, we identified CUL4A as a new Wnt target gene in both human and mouse mammary cells and provide evidence that Wnt10b -mediated turnover of p27 KIP1 requires expression of both CUL4A and the related CUL4B . These results indicated that induction of CUL4A and loss of p27 KIP1 are unique characteristics of Wnt -responding cells, and may represent features of the basal tumor phenotype in breast cancer. We also found that Wnt10b expression levels correlated inversely with p27 KIP1 in a series of mice expressing graded levels of WNT10B protein. This indicates that reduction of p27 KIP1 is regulated by a Wnt -dependent mechanism in both normal mammary development and Wnt10b -associated tumor progression.

The data from our experiments demonstrate the dispensability of SKP2 in Wnt10b -mediated p27 KIP1 turnover in vitro and a lack of significant SKP2 expression in an in vivo model of Wnt -mediated breast cancer. These results provide evidence that an alternative mechanism of p27 KIP1 turnover may exist in Wnt -responsive cells. SKP2 and p27 KIP1 have been shown to be important prognostic markers in multivariate analysis correlating with poor survivability in breast cancer patients. In one study, 34% of breast cancers correlated with high levels of SKP2 and low levels of p27 KIP1 . However, an additional 33.7% of tumors scored negative for both p27 KIP1 and SKP2, suggestive of alternative pathways to degrade p27 KIP1 protein levels in a large percentage of breast cancer patients ( Traub et al. 2006 ).

We hypothesized that the Wnt -induced degradation of p27 KIP1 would alleviate the restriction to enter M in Skp2-null cells ( Nakayama et al. 2004 ). We found that Wnt10b could lessen the accumulation of cells at G 2 and reduce the sensitivity of Skp2 −/− MEFs responding to serum deprivation. This suggests a link between Wnt signaling and protection from chromosomal abnormalities in situations where SKP2 expression is limiting during development. More importantly, these findings uncover a potential for SCF SKP2 -independent p27 KIP1 turnover in other stages of the cell cycle.

Since p27 turnover in Wnt10b -expressing cells requires proteasome function and similar p27 KIP1 polyubiquitination sites, we searched expression microarray data from Wnt10b TG -induced tumors to identify additional E3-like complexes expressed by these cells. The analysis revealed enhanced expression of Cullin 4A and Cullin 4B . CUL4 genes represent components of a new class of ubiquitin E3 ligases, distinct from the Cullin 1-associated SCF SKP2 complex ( Lee and Zhou 2007 ). CUL4A previously had been found amplified in primary breast cancers and is also amplified and/or overexpressed in a large percentage of breast cancer cell lines ( Chen et al. 1998 ; Schindl et al. 2007 ). Interestingly, CUL4A has been shown to degrade p27 KIP1 during erythropoiesis and is critical for early embryonic development ( Li et al. 2006 ). Cul4A -null embryos die ∼4.5–7.5 d in development ( Li et al. 2002 ). Since Wnt10b is expressed at high levels in 3.5- to 4.5-d blastocysts ( Kemp et al. 2005 ), we hypothesize that CUL4A might be a direct target of Wnt signaling and play a role in Wnt10b -mediated degradation of p27 KIP1 .

To test this hypothesis, we conducted ChIP assays to identify regulators of Cul4A promoter activity. We observed enhanced recruitment of LEF1 and β-catenin to the Cul4A promoter. RNA pol II holoenzyme was also recruited to the Cul4A promoter and correlated with production of Cul4A mRNA. CUL4A mRNA and protein were similarly enhanced in human MCF7 cells in response to Wnt10b signaling, and CUL4A protein was induced by exposure to LiCl, an activator of canonical Wnt signaling. These results demonstrate that CUL4A is a novel Wnt target gene in mammary epithelial cells.

Using an shRNA strategy to produce siRNA against Cul4A , we were able to directly test if CUL4A was required for the degradation of p27 KIP1 and S-phase progression in Wnt10b -expressing cells. No clones were isolated showing complete knockdown of Cul4A mRNA, but clones were recovered with significantly lower levels of Cul4A mRNA expression. Importantly, siCul4A blocked p27 KIP1 turnover and restored p27 KIP1 protein concentrations in these partially silenced clones. Concurrently, we observed that Cul4A -silenced clones of Wnt10b -expressing cells proliferated at rates ∼2.6-fold slower than control cells. In similar studies, we demonstrated that siCul4B had a similar phenotype as siCul4A , but the effect was less pronounced than in the Cul4A knockdown experiment. In human mammary cells, we found that DN-CUL4A and DN-CUL4B were able to restore endogenous p27 KIP1 in S-phase cells.

The loss of CUL4 in Drosophila cells causes G 1 accumulation and restoration of the CDK inhibitor Dacapo (p27 KIP1 ), and in human cells silencing of CUL4A restore p27 KIP1 in G 1 cells ( Higa et al. 2006 ). Previous work has shown that Cul4A–DDB1 cooperates with SCF SKP2 , partitioning p27 KIP1 degradation between G 1 /S boundary and S phase ( Bondar et al. 2006 ). Bondar et al. (2006) found that CUL4A–DDB1 plays a role in G 1 turnover of p27 KIP1 , but proposed that SKP2 was still required for S-phase turnover. Our findings represent the first example that illustrates degradation of p27 KIP1 -mediated by CUL4A in S-phase cells and that demonstrates independence from SKP2 activity. Consequently, we propose that a CUL4-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (potentially including CUL4A–DDB1) functions to reprogram S-phase progression and functionally replace at least some functions of SCF SKP2 in Wnt- responding cells.

In conclusion, we provide evidence that a Wnt -dependent breast cancer model correlates with nuclear β-catenin, cyclin D1-high, p27 KIP1 -low, and SKP2-low protein expression. The degradation of p27 KIP1 in this model appears independent of SKP2 and correlates with induction of a functional CUL4A-E3 ligase complex. These results define a previously unrecognized post-translational component of the Wnt response and define a novel WIPT pathway. The link is significant because a large percentage of human breast cancers have been identified with low p27 KIP1 and low SKP2, and their origin is currently unclear. Furthermore, nuclear β-catenin in combination with cycD1 high , p27 low , and SKP2 low may define a subgroup of human breast cancer that are currently not targeted effectively by current therapies. Pharmaceutical suppressors of CUL4A-associated E3 ligase activity could provide a therapeutic target for this subset of cancers, as they would increase p27 KIP1 expression and delay proliferation. Such inhibitors could also reduce the genetic instability resulting from SKP2 inhibition. The concept of cancer as a disease of stem or progenitor cells is well illustrated in human mammary carcinogenesis. Mouse tumor models of Wnt- activation should continue to provide insight into the mechanism of basal breast cancer since these tumors are heavily dependent on stem cell progenitors.
