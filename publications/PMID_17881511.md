Dendritic cells (DCs) isolated from patients with chronic hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) infection display an impaired capacity to generate type 1 CD4(+) T cell 
immunity. Several reports have described an immunomodulatory function for the 
HCV core protein, and circulating core has been shown to associate with the 
putative gC1q receptor, gC1qR, expressed on host immune cells. However, the 
molecular mechanism(s) of HCV core-mediated DC dysfunction has not been defined. 
Herein, ligation of gC1qR on human monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) with HCV core or 
anti-gC1qR agonist antibody was shown to inhibit TLR-induced IL-12 production 
but not the production of other TLR-stimulated cytokines. Furthermore, 
engagement of gC1qR on MDDCs resulted in reduced IFN-gamma secretion by 
allogeneic CD4(+) T lymphocytes during mixed lymphocyte culture. Differentiation 
of CD4(+) T cells cocultured with HCV core- or anti-gC1qR antibody-treated MDDCs 
was also skewed toward production of Th2 cytokines, including IL-4. Importantly, 
that addition of IL-12 rescued IFN-gamma production and Th1 differentiation by 
CD4(+) T cells. Therefore, engagement of gC1qR on DCs by HCV core limits the 
induction of Th1 responses and may contribute to viral persistence.
