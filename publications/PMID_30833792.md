Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) form the backbone of the innate immune system 
and are important for limiting intra- and intercellular viral replication and 
spread. We conducted a mass-spectrometry-based survey to understand the 
fundamental organization of the innate immune system and to explore the 
molecular functions of individual ISGs. We identified interactions between 104 
ISGs and 1,401 cellular binding partners engaging in 2,734 high-confidence 
interactions. 90% of these interactions are unreported so far, and our survey 
therefore illuminates a far wider activity spectrum of ISGs than is currently 
known. Integration of the resulting ISG-interaction network with published 
datasets and functional studies allowed us to identify regulators of immunity 
and processes related to the immune system. Given the extraordinary robustness 
of the innate immune system, this ISG network may serve as a blueprint for 
therapeutic targeting of cellular systems to efficiently fight viral infections.
