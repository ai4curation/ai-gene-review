The SNF2h-containing chromatin-remodeling complex NoRC is responsible for 
silencing a fraction of mammalian rRNA genes (rDNA). NoRC silences transcription 
by establishing heterochromatic features-including DNA methylation, 
hypoacetylation of histone H4, and methylation of H3K9-at the rDNA promoter []. 
We have investigated the mechanism of NoRC-mediated rDNA silencing and show that 
binding of the bromodomain of TIP5, the large subunit of NoRC, to acetylated 
nucleosomes is a prerequisite for NoRC function. A point mutation within the 
bromodomain impairs the association of NoRC with chromatin, prevents 
heterochromatin formation, and abolishes transcriptional repression. Moreover, 
the association of NoRC with chromatin requires acetylation of histone H4 at 
lysine 16 (acH4K16), and binding to acH4K16 is required for subsequent 
deacetylation of H4K5, H4K8, and H4K12, indicating that acetylation of H4K16 
plays an active role in NoRC-mediated heterochromatin formation. The bromodomain 
cooperates with an adjacent PHD finger to recruit HDAC1, DNMT1, DNMT3, and SNF2h 
to rDNA. If specifically targeted to the rDNA promoter, the PHD 
finger/bromodomain is capable of establishing heterochromatic features and rDNA 
silencing. Thus, the PHD finger/bromodomain represents an autonomous unit that 
binds to acH4K16 and coordinates the chain of events that establish the 
repressed state of rDNA.
