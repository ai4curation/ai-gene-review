The E3 ubiquitin ligase membrane-associated ring-CH-type finger 2 (MARCH2) is 
known to be involved in intracellular vesicular trafficking, but its role in the 
early secretory pathway between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi 
compartments is largely unknown. Human ER-Golgi intermediate compartment protein 
2 (ERGIC2) and ERGIC3 are orthologs of Erv41 and Erv46 in yeast, proteins that 
form a heteromeric complex, cycle between the ER and Golgi, and function as 
cargo receptors in both anterograde and retrograde protein trafficking. Here, we 
report that MARCH2 directs ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of ERGIC3 
and that MARCH2 depletion increases endogenous ERGIC3 levels. We provide 
evidence that the lysine residues at positions 6 and 8 of ERGIC3 are the major 
sites of MARCH2-mediated ubiquitination. Of note, MARCH2 did not significantly 
decrease the levels of an ERGIC3 variant with lysine-to-arginine substitutions 
at residues 6 and 8. We also show that ERGIC3 binds to itself or to ERGIC2, 
whereas ERGIC2 is unable to interact with itself. Our results indicate that 
α1-antitrypsin and haptoglobin are likely to be cargo proteins of ERGIC3. We 
further observed that α1-antitrypsin and haptoglobin specifically bind to ERGIC3 
and that ERGIC3 depletion decreases their secretion. Moreover, MARCH2 reduced 
secretion of α1-antitrypsin and haptoglobin, and coexpression of the 
ubiquitination-resistant ERGIC3 variant largely restored their secretion, 
suggesting that MARCH2-mediated ERGIC3 ubiquitination is the major cause of the 
decrease in trafficking of ERGIC3-binding secretory proteins. Our findings 
provide detailed insights into the regulation of the early secretory pathway by 
MARCH2 and into ERGIC3 function.
