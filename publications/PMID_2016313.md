Yeast DNA coding for nucleosome assembly protein I (NAP-I), which facilitates 
nucleosome assembly in vitro at physiological ionic conditions, was cloned and 
its gene product was characterized. A monoclonal antibody against NAP-I (58 kDa) 
from human HeLa cells was used to screen a genomic library of Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae constructed into lambda gt11. A 60-kDa protein was detected by 
immunoblotting in the extracts of Escherichia coli lysogenized with a positive 
clone. The 60-kDa protein purified from the extracts had an activity equivalent 
to that of NAP-I from mouse and human cells. The amino acid sequence deduced 
from the gene coding for the yeast NAP-I defines a polypeptide of molecular mass 
47,848 Da with three negatively charged regions. While the two regions contain 8 
and 10 acidic amino acids out of 13 amino acid residues, the longest stretch has 
15 glutamic and 13 aspartic acids out of 38 residues. These regions are probably 
involved in the interaction with histones. Proteins recognized by the anti-NAP-I 
antibody were also present in Xenopus oocytes and Drosophila cultured cells. 
Possible roles of NAP-I are discussed in relation to other nucleosome assembly 
proteins.
