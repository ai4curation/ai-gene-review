Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, the aetiological agent of porcine enzootic pneumonia, 
regulates the presentation of proteins on its cell surface via endoproteolysis, 
including those of the cilial adhesin P123 (MHJ_0194). These proteolytic 
cleavage events create functional adhesins that bind to proteoglycans and 
glycoproteins on the surface of ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells and 
to the circulatory host molecule plasminogen. Two dominant cleavage events of 
the P123 preprotein have been previously characterized; however, immunoblotting 
studies suggest that more complex processing events occur. These extensive 
processing events are characterized here. The functional significance of the P97 
cleavage fragments is also poorly understood. Affinity chromatography using 
heparin, fibronectin and plasminogen as bait and peptide arrays were used to 
expand our knowledge of the adhesive capabilities of P123 cleavage fragments and 
characterize a novel binding motif in the C-terminus of P123. Further, we use 
immunohistochemistry to examine in vivo, the biological significance of 
interactions between M. hyopneumoniae and fibronectin and show that M. 
hyopneumoniae induces fibronectin deposition at the site of infection on the 
ciliated epithelium. Our data supports the hypothesis that M. hyopneumoniae 
possesses the molecular machinery to influence key molecular communication 
pathways in host cells.
