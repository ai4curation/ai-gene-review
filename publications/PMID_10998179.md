Both FliH and the ATPase FliI are cytoplasmic components of the Salmonella type 
III flagellar export apparatus. Dominance and inhibition data have suggested 
that the N-terminus of FliI interacts with FliH and that this interaction is 
important for the ATPase function of the C-terminal domain of FliI. N-terminally 
histidine-tagged, wild-type FliI retarded untagged FliH in a Ni-NTA affinity 
chromatography assay, as did N-His-tagged versions of FliI carrying catalytic 
mutations. In contrast, N-His-tagged FliI carrying the double mutation R7C/L12P 
did not, further indicating that the N-terminus of FliI is responsible for 
interaction with FliH. Native agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed that FliH 
and FliI form a complex. Analytical gel filtration with in-line multiangle light 
scattering indicated that FliH alone forms a dimer, FliI alone remains as a 
monomer, and FliH and FliI together form a (FliH)2FliI complex. Ni-NTA affinity 
chromatography using N-His-tagged FliH and a large excess of untagged FliH 
confirmed that FliH forms a homodimer. The ATPase activity of the FliH-FliI 
complex was about 10-fold lower than that of FliI alone; the presence or absence 
of ATP did not affect the formation of the complex. We propose that FliH 
functions as a negative regulator to prevent FliI from hydrolysing ATP until the 
flagellar export apparatus is competent to link this hydrolysis to the 
translocation of export substrates across the plane of the cytoplasmic membrane 
into the lumen of the nascent flagellar structure.
