p75(NTR), a nerve growth factor co-receptor that has been implicated in 
apoptosis of neurons, is structurally related to Fas and the receptors for tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha that display ligand independent assembly into trimers. 
Using embryonic day 17 fetal rat cortical neurons and p75(NTR)-expressing 
NIH-3T3 cells, we now show that p75(NTR) exists as a trimer as well as a 
monomer. Furthermore, we have reported and others have confirmed that amyloid 
beta binds p75(NTR), and that this binding leads to apoptotic cell death. We now 
report that amyloid beta binds to trimers of p75(NTR) as well as to p75(NTR) 
monomers but not to the p140(trkA), the nerve growth factor co-receptor that 
mediates neuronal survival. Furthermore, amyloid beta activates p75(NTR), 
strongly inducing the transcription of c-Jun mRNA and stimulating the 
stress-activated c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, as measured by phosphorylation of 
its substrate (glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun-(1-79)). Our data suggest that 
p75(NTR) may be present as a preformed trimer that binds amyloid beta to induce 
receptor activation, and support the hypothesis that p75(NTR) activation by 
amyloid beta is causally related to Alzheimer's disease.
