All three kingdoms of life employ two methionine tRNAs, one for translation 
initiation and the other for insertion of methionines at internal positions 
within growing polypeptide chains. We have used a reconstituted yeast 
translation initiation system to explore the interactions of the initiator tRNA 
with the translation initiation machinery. Our data indicate that in addition to 
its previously characterized role in binding of the initiator tRNA to eukaryotic 
initiation factor 2 (eIF2), the initiator-specific A1:U72 base pair at the top 
of the acceptor stem is important for the binding of the eIF2.GTP.Met-tRNA(i) 
ternary complex to the 40S ribosomal subunit. We have also shown that the 
initiator-specific G:C base pairs in the anticodon stem of the initiator tRNA 
are required for the strong thermodynamic coupling between binding of the 
ternary complex and mRNA to the ribosome. This coupling reflects interactions 
that occur within the complex upon recognition of the start codon, suggesting 
that these initiator-specific G:C pairs influence this step. The effect of these 
anticodon stem identity elements is influenced by bases in the T loop of the 
tRNA, suggesting that conformational coupling between the D-loop-T-loop 
substructure and the anticodon stem of the initiator tRNA may occur during AUG 
codon selection in the ribosomal P-site, similar to the conformational coupling 
that occurs in A-site tRNAs engaged in mRNA decoding during the elongation phase 
of protein synthesis.
