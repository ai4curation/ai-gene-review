The process of cold acclimation is an important adaptive response whereby many 
plants from temperate regions increase their freezing tolerance after being 
exposed to low non-freezing temperatures. The correct development of this 
response relies on proper accumulation of a number of transcription factors that 
regulate expression patterns of cold-responsive genes. Multiple studies have 
revealed a variety of molecular mechanisms involved in promoting the 
accumulation of these transcription factors. Interestingly, however, the 
mechanisms implicated in controlling such accumulation to ensure their adequate 
levels remain largely unknown. In this work, we demonstrate that prefoldins 
(PFDs) control the levels of HY5, an Arabidopsis transcription factor with a key 
role in cold acclimation by activating anthocyanin biosynthesis, in response to 
low temperature. Our results show that, under cold conditions, PFDs accumulate 
into the nucleus through a DELLA-dependent mechanism, where they interact with 
HY5, triggering its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. The degradation 
of HY5 would result, in turn, in anthocyanin biosynthesis attenuation, ensuring 
the accurate development of cold acclimation. These findings uncover an 
unanticipated nuclear function for PFDs in plant responses to abiotic stresses.
