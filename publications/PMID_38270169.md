The α-arrestins form a large family of evolutionally conserved modulators that 
control diverse signaling pathways, including both G-protein-coupled receptor 
(GPCR)-mediated and non-GPCR-mediated pathways, across eukaryotes. However, 
unlike β-arrestins, only a few α-arrestin targets and functions have been 
characterized. Here, using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we 
constructed interactomes for 6 human and 12 Drosophila α-arrestins. The 
resulting high-confidence interactomes comprised 307 and 467 prey proteins in 
human and Drosophila, respectively. A comparative analysis of these interactomes 
predicted not only conserved binding partners, such as motor proteins, 
proteases, ubiquitin ligases, RNA splicing factors, and GTPase-activating 
proteins, but also those specific to mammals, such as histone modifiers and the 
subunits of V-type ATPase. Given the manifestation of the interaction between 
the human α-arrestin, TXNIP, and the histone-modifying enzymes, including HDAC2, 
we undertook a global analysis of transcription signals and chromatin structures 
that were affected by TXNIP knockdown. We found that TXNIP activated targets by 
blocking HDAC2 recruitment to targets, a result that was validated by chromatin 
immunoprecipitation assays. Additionally, the interactome for an uncharacterized 
human α-arrestin ARRDC5 uncovered multiple components in the V-type ATPase, 
which plays a key role in bone resorption by osteoclasts. Our study presents 
conserved and species-specific protein-protein interaction maps for α-arrestins, 
which provide a valuable resource for interrogating their cellular functions for 
both basic and clinical research.
