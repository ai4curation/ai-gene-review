The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase is a major 
regulator of cell growth that responds to numerous environmental cues. A key 
input is amino acids, which act through the heterodimeric Rag GTPases (RagA or 
RagB bound to RagC or RagD) in order to promote the translocation of mTORC1 to 
the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. GATOR2 is a complex of unknown 
function that positively regulates mTORC1 signaling by acting upstream of or in 
parallel to GATOR1, which is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RagA or RagB 
and an inhibitor of the amino-acid-sensing pathway. Here, we find that the 
Sestrins, a family of poorly understood growth regulators (Sestrin1-Sestrin3), 
interact with GATOR2 in an amino-acid-sensitive fashion. Sestrin2-mediated 
inhibition of mTORC1 signaling requires GATOR1 and the Rag GTPases, and the 
Sestrins regulate the localization of mTORC1 in response to amino acids. Thus, 
we identify the Sestrins as GATOR2-interacting proteins that regulate the 
amino-acid-sensing branch of the mTORC1 pathway.
