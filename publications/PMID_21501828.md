Virus entry into cells is typically initiated by binding of virally encoded 
envelope proteins to specific cell surface receptors. Studying infectivity of 
lentivirus pseudotypes lacking envelope binding, we still observed high 
infectivity for some cell types. On further investigation, we discovered that 
this infectivity is conferred by the soluble bovine protein S in fetal calf 
serum, or Gas6, its human homolog. Gas6 enhances native infectivity of 
pseudotypes of multiple viral envelope proteins. Gas6 mediates binding of the 
virus to target cells by bridging virion envelope phosphatidylserine to Axl, a 
TAM receptor tyrosine kinase on target cells. Phagocytic clearance of apoptotic 
cells is known to involve bridging by Gas6. Replication of vaccinia virus, which 
was previously reported to use apoptotic mimicry to enter cells, is also 
enhanced by Gas6. These results reveal an alternative molecular mechanism of 
viral entry that can broaden host range and enhance infectivity of enveloped 
viruses.
