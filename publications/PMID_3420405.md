Hormone-sensitive lipase, a key enzyme in fatty acid mobilization, overall 
energy homeostasis, and possibly steroidogenesis, is acutely controlled through 
reversible phosphorylation by catecholamines and insulin. The 757-amino acid 
sequence predicted from a cloned rat adipocyte complementary DNA showed no 
homology with any other known lipase or protein. The activity-controlling 
phosphorylation site was localized to Ser563 in a markedly hydrophilic domain, 
and a lipid-binding consensus site was tentatively identified. One or several 
messenger RNA species (3.3, 3.5, or 3.9 kilobases) were expressed in adipose and 
steroidogenic tissues and heart and skeletal muscle. The human hormone-sensitive 
lipase gene mapped to chromosome 19 cent-q13.3.
