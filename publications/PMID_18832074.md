Correlative evidence links stress, accumulation of oxidative cellular damage, 
and aging in several species. Genetic studies in species ranging from yeast to 
mammals revealed several pathways regulating stress response and life span, 
including caloric intake, mitochondrial respiration, insulin/IGF-1 (IIS), and 
JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) signaling. How IIS and JNK signaling cross-talk to 
defend against diverse stressors contributing to aging is of critical importance 
but, so far, only poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the 
adaptor protein SHC-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of human p52Shc, 
coordinates mechanisms of stress response and aging. Using genetic and 
biochemical approaches, we discover that SHC-1 not only opposes IIS but also 
activates JNK signaling. Loss of shc-1 function results in accelerated aging and 
enhanced sensitivity to heat, oxidative stress, and heavy metals, whereas 
expression of human p52Shc rescues the shc-1 mutant phenotype. SHC-1 acts 
upstream of the insulin/IGF receptor DAF-2 and the PI3 kinase AGE-1 and directly 
interacts with DAF-2. Moreover, SHC-1 activates JNK signaling by binding to 
MEK-1 kinase. Both aspects converge on controlling the nuclear translocation and 
activation of the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. Our findings establish C. 
elegans SHC-1 as a critical scaffold that directly cross-connects the two 
parallel JNK and IIS pathways and help to explain how these signaling cascades 
cooperate to ascertain normal stress response and life span in C. elegans.
