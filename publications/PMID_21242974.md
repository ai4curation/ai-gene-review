Axin, a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, is a key scaffold protein for the 
β-catenin destruction complex. It has been previously shown that multiple 
post-translational modification enzymes regulate the level of Axin. Here, we 
provide evidence that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) directly 
interacts with and methylates the 378th arginine residue of Axin both in vitro 
and in vivo. We found that the transient expression of PRMT1 led to an increased 
level of Axin and that knockdown of endogenous PRMT1 by short hairpin RNA 
reduced the level of Axin. These results suggest that methylation by PRMT1 
enhanced the stability of Axin. Methylation of Axin by PRMT1 also seemingly 
enhanced the interaction between Axin and glycogen synthase kinase 3β, leading 
to decreased ubiquitination of Axin. Consistent with the role of PRMT1 in the 
regulation of Axin, knockdown of PRMT1 enhanced the level of cytoplasmic 
β-catenin as well as β-catenin-dependent transcription activity. In summary, we 
show that the methylation of Axin occurred in vivo and controlled the stability 
of Axin. Therefore, methylation of Axin by PRMT1 may serve as a finely tuned 
regulation mechanism for Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
