Wnt signaling is involved in numerous processes during vertebrate CNS 
development. In this study, we used conditional Cre/loxP system in mouse to 
ablate or activate beta-catenin in the telencephalon in two time windows: before 
and after the onset of neurogenesis. We show that beta-catenin mediated Wnt 
signals are required to maintain the molecular identity of the pallium. 
Inactivation of beta-catenin in the telencephalon before neurogenesis results in 
downregulated expression of dorsal markers Emx1, Emx2 and Ngn2, and in ectopic 
up-regulation of ventral markers Gsh2, Mash1 and Dlx2 in the pallium. In 
contrast, ablation of ss-catenin after the onset of cortical neurogenesis 
(E11.5) does not result in a dorso-ventral fate shift. In addition, activation 
of canonical Wnt signaling in the subpallium leads to a repression of ventral 
telencephalic cell identities as shown by the down-regulation of subpallial 
markers Dlx2, Nkx2.1, Gsh2, Olig2 and Mash1. This was accompanied with an 
expansion of dorsal identities ventrally as shown by the expanded expression 
domains of pallial markers Pax6 and Ngn2. Thus, our data suggest that canonical 
Wnt signals are involved in maintaining the identity of the pallium by 
controlling expression of dorsal markers and by suppressing ventral programs 
from being activated in pallial progenitor cells.
