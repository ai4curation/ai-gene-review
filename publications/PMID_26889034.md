The UL47 gene product, VP8, is the most abundant tegument protein of bovine 
herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1). Previously, we demonstrated that a UL47-deleted BoHV-1 
mutant (BoHV1-ΔUL47) exhibits 100-fold-reduced virulence in vitro and is 
avirulent in vivo In this study, we demonstrated that VP8 expression or BoHV-1 
infection inhibits interferon beta (IFN-β) signaling by using an 
IFN-α/β-responsive plasmid in a luciferase assay. As transducer and activator of 
transcription (STAT) is an essential component in the IFN-signaling pathways, 
the effect of VP8 on STAT was investigated. An interaction between VP8 and STAT1 
was established by coimmunoprecipitation assays in both VP8-transfected and 
BoHV-1-infected cells. Two domains of VP8, amino acids 259 to 482 and 632 to 
686, were found to be responsible for its interaction with STAT1. The expression 
of VP8 did not induce STAT1 ubiquitination or degradation. Moreover, VP8 did not 
reduce STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation to downregulate IFN-β signaling. However, 
the expression of VP8 or a version of VP8 (amino acids 219 to 741) that contains 
the STAT1-interacting domains but not the nuclear localization signal prevented 
nuclear accumulation of STAT1. Inhibition of nuclear accumulation of STAT1 also 
occurred during BoHV-1 infection, while nuclear translocation of STAT1 was 
observed in BoHV1-ΔUL47-infected cells. During BoHV-1 infection, VP8 was 
detected in the cytoplasm at 2 h postinfection without any de novo protein 
synthesis, at which time STAT1 was already retained in the cytoplasm. These 
results suggest that viral VP8 downregulates IFN-β signaling early during 
infection, thus playing a role in overcoming the antiviral response of 
BoHV-1-infected cells.
IMPORTANCE: Since VP8 is the most abundant protein in BoHV-1 virions and thus 
may be released in large amounts into the host cell immediately upon infection, 
we proposed that it might have a function in the establishment of conditions 
suitable for viral replication. Indeed, while nonessential in vitro, it is 
critical for BoHV-1 replication in vivo In this study, we determined that VP8 
plays a role in downregulation of the antiviral host response by inhibiting 
IFN-β signaling. VP8 interacted with and prevented nuclear accumulation of STAT1 
at 2 h postinfection in the absence of de novo viral protein synthesis. Two 
domains of VP8, amino acids 259 to 482 and 632 to 686, were found to be 
responsible for this interaction. These results provide a new functional role 
for VP8 in BoHV-1 infection and a potential explanation for the lack of viral 
replication of the UL47 deletion mutant in cattle.
