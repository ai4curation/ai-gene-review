In open places, plants are exposed to higher fluence rates of photosynthetically 
active radiation and to higher red to far-red ratios than under the shade of 
neighbor plants. High fluence rates are known to increase stomata density. Here 
we show that high, compared to low, red to far-red ratios also increase stomata 
density in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). High red to far-red ratios 
increase the proportion of phytochrome B (phyB) in its active form and the phyB 
mutant exhibited a constitutively low stomata density. phyB increased the 
stomata index (the ratio between stomata and epidermal cells number) and the 
level of anphistomy (by increasing stomata density more intensively in the 
adaxial than in the abaxial face). phyB promoted the expression of FAMA and TOO 
MANY MOUTHS genes involved in the regulation of stomata development in young 
leaves. Increased stomata density resulted in increased transpiration per unit 
leaf area. However, phyB promoted photosynthesis rates only at high fluence 
rates of photosynthetically active radiation. In accordance to these 
observations, phyB reduced long-term water-use efficiency estimated by the 
analysis of isotopic discrimination against (13)CO(2). We propose a model where 
active phyB promotes stomata differentiation in open places, allowing plants to 
take advantage of the higher irradiances at the expense of a reduction of 
water-use efficiency, which is compensated by a reduced leaf area.

Abstract

In open places, plants are exposed to higher fluence rates of photosynthetically active radiation and to higher red to far-red ratios than under the shade of neighbor plants. High fluence rates are known to increase stomata density. Here we show that high, compared to low, red to far-red ratios also increase stomata density in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ). High red to far-red ratios increase the proportion of phytochrome B (phyB) in its active form and the phyB mutant exhibited a constitutively low stomata density. phyB increased the stomata index (the ratio between stomata and epidermal cells number) and the level of anphistomy (by increasing stomata density more intensively in the adaxial than in the abaxial face). phyB promoted the expression of FAMA and TOO MANY MOUTHS genes involved in the regulation of stomata development in young leaves. Increased stomata density resulted in increased transpiration per unit leaf area. However, phyB promoted photosynthesis rates only at high fluence rates of photosynthetically active radiation. In accordance to these observations, phyB reduced long-term water-use efficiency estimated by the analysis of isotopic discrimination against 13 CO 2 . We propose a model where active phyB promotes stomata differentiation in open places, allowing plants to take advantage of the higher irradiances at the expense of a reduction of water-use efficiency, which is compensated by a reduced leaf area.

DISCUSSION

In Arabidopsis, the density of stomata and the stomata index increase in response to PAR and in response to low CO 2 ( Willmer and Fricker, 1996 ; Lake et al., 2001 ). Low R/FR ratios are typical of canopy shade light and establish low proportions of active phytochrome ( Holmes and Smith, 1977a , 1977b ). Here we show that light treatments (+FR) that reduce the proportion of phytochrome in its active form also reduce stomata density and stomata index of Arabidopsis leaves ( Fig. 2, A and C ). The phyB mutants having reduced or null levels of phyB, the main photoreceptor of R/FR ratios, showed low stomata density and stomata index under high R/FR ratios ( Fig. 2, B, D, and E ). The level of amphistomy (i.e. the presence of stomata on both leaf blade surfaces) can increase with PAR ( Mott et al., 1982 ). The +FR treatment and the phyB mutation reduced stomata density more in the adaxial than in the abaxial face and therefore reduced the level of amphistomy ( Fig. 3 ). This picture is completed by the observation that lines overexpressing the PHYB gene increased stomata density, stomata index, and the level of amphistomy compared to the wild type (Supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, active phyB increases stomata density, stomata index, and amphistomy in Arabidopsis.

Low irradiance or low R/FR ratio do not change stomata density in the leaves of C. communis ( Assmann, 1992 ), indicating that not all the species follow the pattern of response to shade light signals exhibited by Arabidopsis. However, given the contribution of Arabidopsis as a model experimental system to study the regulation of transpiration and drought tolerance ( Nilson and Assmann, 2007 ), it is important to uncover the environmental signals and the receptors controlling stomatal density and the physiological consequences of this regulation in Arabidopsis.

Stomata index is defined relatively early during the development of the leaves ( Larkin et al., 1997 ; Serna et al., 2002 ) and therefore, the adjustment to the future conditions that the leaf is more likely to face would be beneficial. In closing canopies, the reduction in R/FR ratio anticipates actual shading among neighbors due to selective FR reflection on green leaves ( Ballaré et al., 1987 ). The perception of low R/FR signals by phyB would provide a mechanism to adjust stomata density of developing leaves to the likely occurrence of shade, before mutual shading (i.e. reduced irradiance) actually takes place.

We are largely ignorant of the genes that relate environmental signals to the control of stomata density ( Wang et al., 2007 ). One exception is the HIGH CARBON DIOXIDE gene, which encodes a putative 3-keto acyl coenzyme A synthase involved in the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids, involved in the response to carbon dioxide ( Gray et al., 2000 ). Here we place phyB between light quality signals and genes involved in stomata differentiation. The expression of FAMA , a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that promotes stomata differentiation ( MacAlister et al., 2007 ; Casson and Gray, 2008 ), is reduced in developing leaves of the phyB mutant compared to the wild type ( Fig. 5A ). SPEECHLESS ( SPCH ) is a bHLH transcription factor that positively regulates the asymmetric divisions that form stomata and the expression of FAMA ( MacAlister et al., 2007 ; Casson and Gray, 2008 ). The expression of SPCH in 8-d-old seedlings with very young primordia is reduced by exposure to 1 h or 4 d to low R/FR ratio ( Carabelli et al., 2007 ). Based on these observations we propose a model where phyB-mediated promotion of stomata differentiation involves positive regulation of bHLH transcription factors that play a key role in stomata development. Interestingly, the expression of TMM , a putative cell-surface Leu-rich repeat-containing receptor-like protein that negatively regulates stomata differentiation ( Geisler et al., 2000 ; Nadeau and Sack, 2002 ) was also lower in the phyB mutant than in the wild type ( Fig. 5B ). The analysis of the expression levels of FAMA and TMM across different developmental, abiotic, and biotic conditions revealed that, despite their opposite effects on stomata density, the positive expression correlation between these genes is not limited to the comparison between the wild type and the phyB mutant ( Fig. 5C ). TMM is not only a repressor of stomatal development, it also seems to provide competence to enter into the stomatal pathway ( Nadeau and Sack, 2002 ). It is likely that phyB positively regulates stomata formation by increasing the number of cells from which the stomatal lineage may develop. The fact that TMM also represses stomatal development, playing an opposite role to phyB, suggests that its expression might be positively controlled by a feedback mechanism during stomata differentiation. These findings suggest that the expression of TMM might be positively controlled by a feedback mechanism during stomata differentiation. There are several examples where an environmental cue initiates downstream signaling and sets into motion mechanisms that negatively regulate that signaling ( Casal et al., 2004 ). The complex interaction among TMM and three ERECTA family of Leu-rich repeat-containing receptor kinases revealed by the mutant phenotypes is not fully understood ( Nadeau, 2008 ) and these sort of feedback regulations could be part of the complexity. The ERECTA gene product is a putative partner of TMM in the regulation of stomata development ( Casson and Gray, 2008 ). We observed changes in stomata density and index in response to +FR or to the phyB mutation in the Landsberg erecta background, indicating that phyB-mediated responses of these traits can occur in the absence of a functional ERECTA gene.

Changes in stomata density do not necessarily translate into changes in water vapor and carbon dioxide fluxes. In transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the STOMATAL DENSITY AND DISTRIBUTION1 ( SDD1 ) gene and in the sdd1 mutant stomata density is significantly decreased or increased, respectively, compared to the wild type ( Bussis et al., 2006 ). However, carbon dioxide assimilation rate and stomatal conductance of overexpressers and sdd1 mutant were unchanged compared with wild type because changes in stomatal density were compensated for by opposite changes in stomatal aperture ( Bussis et al., 2006 ). Conversely, the control of stomatal density by phyB correlated with changes in the rate of transpiration when the wild type is compared to either the phyB mutant ( Fig. 1B ) or the PHYB OX (Supplemental Fig. S1). This resulted in a negative regulation of water-use efficiency by phyB ( Fig. 4 ; Supplemental Fig. S1) consistent with the positive regulation by ERECTA , which reduces stomata density ( Masle et al., 2005 ).

The activity of phyB is higher in open places, where the radiation load is stronger and atmospheric water demand is more intense. Therefore, the increased stomatal density caused by phyB, which results in reduced water-use efficiency, cannot easily be associated with a strategy aimed to conserve water. Along the same line of arguments, increased amphistomy is a feature often linked to adequate water availability ( Mott et al., 1982 ; Lynn and Waldren, 2002 ). Low R/FR ratios and the phyB mutation increased leaf area per plant ( Fig. 1A ). Increased leaf area in response to +FR has been observed in other species such us Cucumis sativus ( López Juez et al., 1990 ), Taraxacum officinale ( Cogliatti and Sánchez, 1987 ), Terminalia ivorensis ( Kwesiga and Grace, 1986 ), and Petunia axilaris ( Casal et al., 1987 ), and for some leaf positions in Arabidopsis ( Robson et al., 1993 ). However, the opposite pattern has also been found ( Kasperbauer, 1971 ; Holmes and Smith, 1977b ; Frankland and Letendre, 1978 ; Robson et al., 1993 ; Devlin et al., 1999 ), suggesting that the actual effect may depend on the species and growing conditions. The negative regulation of leaf area by phyB observed here would help to reduce water loss per plant in open places. However, the opposite regulation of leaf area and transpiration per unit leaf area by phyB largely compensate each other, indicating that the main function of these changes is not the adjustment of water use. Rather, phyB perception of the high R/FR ratios of open places allows Arabidopsis plants to increase photosynthesis in response to the higher PAR levels that the plant may experience in those conditions ( Fig. 6 ). The increased stomata density and amphistomy mediated by phyB would be an adaptation to the high PAR of open places by favoring the diffusion of carbon dioxide ( Fig. 7B ) and by facilitating leaf cooling due to the concomitant increase in transpiration rate reducing the stress imposed by high radiation loads ( Mott et al., 1982 ; Parkhurst and Mott, 1990 ; Mott and Michaelson, 1991 ). Excitation energy that is not used for photochemistry and not dissipated as fluorescence or heat can be transferred to molecular oxygen, creating highly damaging reactive oxygen species ( Golan et al., 2006 , and refs. therein). Therefore, the higher rate of photosynthesis at high PAR caused by phyB could also reduce the diversion of excitation energy to the generation of reactive species of oxygen in open places.
