Calcium-dependent proteolytic calpains are implicated in a variety of 
physiological processes, as well as pathologies associated with calcium 
overload. However, the mechanism by which calpain is activated remains elusive 
since intracellular calcium levels under physiological conditions do not reach 
the high concentration range required to trigger calpain activation. From a 
candidate screening using the abundance of the calpain target glutamate receptor 
GluRIIA at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction as a readout, we uncovered that 
calpain activity was inhibited upon knockdown of Ttm50, a subunit of the Tim23 
complex known to be involved in the import of proteins across the mitochondrial 
inner membrane. Unexpectedly, Ttm50 and calpain are co-localized at calcium 
stores Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Ttm50 interacts with calpain 
via its C-terminal domain. This interaction is required for calpain localization 
at Golgi/ER, and increases calcium sensitivity of calpain by roughly an order of 
magnitude. Our findings reveal the regulation of calpain activation by Ttm50, 
and shed new light on calpain-associated pathologies.
