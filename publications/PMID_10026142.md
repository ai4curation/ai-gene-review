The catalytic subunit of protein serine/threonine phosphatase 4 (PP4C) has 
greater than 65% amino acid identity to the catalytic subunit of protein 
phosphatase 2A (PP2AC). Despite this high homology, PP4 does not appear to 
associate with known PP2A regulatory subunits. As a first step toward 
characterization of PP4 holoenzymes and identification of putative PP4 
regulatory subunits, PP4 was purified from bovine testis soluble extracts. PP4 
existed in two complexes of approximately 270-300 and 400-450 kDa as determined 
by gel filtration chromatography. The smaller PP4 complex was purified by 
sequential phenyl-Sepharose, Source 15Q, DEAE2, and Superdex 200 gel filtration 
chromatographies. The final product contained two major proteins: the PP4 
catalytic subunit plus a protein that migrated as a doublet of 120-125 kDa on 
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The associated protein, termed PP4R1, 
and PP4C also bound to microcystin-Sepharose. Mass spectrometry analysis of the 
purified complex revealed two major peaks, at 35 (PP4C) and 105 kDa (PP4R1). 
Amino acid sequence information of several peptides derived from the 105 kDa 
protein was utilized to isolate a human cDNA clone. Analysis of the predicted 
amino acid sequence revealed 13 nonidentical repeats similar to repeats found in 
the A subunit of PP2A (PP2AA). The PP4R1 cDNA clone engineered with an 
N-terminal Myc tag was expressed in COS M6 cells and PP4C co-immunoprecipitated 
with Myc-tagged PP4R1. These data indicate that one form of PP4 is similar to 
the core complex of PP2A in that it consists of a catalytic subunit and a 
"PP2AA-like" structural subunit.
