Two siblings from consanguineous parents died perinatally with a condition 
characterized by generalized hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, 
arthrogryposis, microcephaly, congenital brain malformations and 
hyperglycinemia. Catalytic activities of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes 
I and II were deficient in skeletal muscle, a finding suggestive of an inborn 
error in mitochondrial biogenesis. Homozygosity mapping identified IBA57 located 
in the largest homozygous region on chromosome 1 as a culprit candidate gene. 
IBA57 is known to be involved in the biosynthesis of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] 
proteins. Sequence analysis of IBA57 revealed the homozygous mutation c.941A > 
C, p.Gln314Pro. Severely decreased amounts of IBA57 protein were observed in 
skeletal muscle and cultured skin fibroblasts from the affected subjects. HeLa 
cells depleted of IBA57 showed biochemical defects resembling the ones found in 
patient-derived cells, including a decrease in various mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] 
proteins and in proteins covalently linked to lipoic acid (LA), a cofactor 
produced by the [4Fe-4S] protein LA synthase. The defects could be complemented 
by wild-type IBA57 and partially by mutant IBA57. As a result of the mutation, 
IBA57 protein was excessively degraded, an effect ameliorated by protease 
inhibitors. Hence, we propose that the mutation leads to partial functional 
impairment of IBA57, yet the major pathogenic impact is due to its proteolytic 
degradation below physiologically critical levels. In conclusion, the ensuing 
lethal complex biochemical phenotype of a novel metabolic syndrome results from 
multiple Fe/S protein defects caused by a deficiency in the Fe/S cluster 
assembly protein IBA57.
