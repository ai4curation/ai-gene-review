We report here the functional analysis of human Regulator of Ribosome Synthesis 
1 (RRS1) protein during mitosis. We demonstrate that RRS1 localizes in the 
nucleolus during interphase and is distributed at the chromosome periphery 
during mitosis. RNA interference experiments revealed that RRS1-depleted cells 
show abnormalities in chromosome alignment and spindle organization, which 
result in mitotic delay. RRS1 knockdown also perturbs the centromeric 
localization of Shugoshin 1 and results in premature separation of sister 
chromatids. Our results suggest that a nucleolar protein RRS1 contributes to 
chromosome congression.
