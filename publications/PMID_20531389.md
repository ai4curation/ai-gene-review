The exosome is an exoribonuclease complex involved in the degradation and 
maturation of a wide variety of RNAs. The nine-subunit core of the eukaryotic 
exosome is catalytically inactive and may have an architectural function and 
mediate substrate binding. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the associated Dis3 and 
Rrp6 provide the exoribonucleolytic activity. The human exosome-associated Rrp6 
counterpart contributes to its activity, whereas the human Dis3 protein is not 
detectably associated with the exosome. Here, a proteomic analysis of 
immunoaffinity-purified human exosome complexes identified a novel 
exosome-associated exoribonuclease, human Dis3-like exonuclease 1 (hDis3L1), 
which was confirmed to associate with the exosome core by 
co-immunoprecipitation. In contrast to the nuclear localization of Dis3, hDis3L1 
exclusively localized to the cytoplasm. The hDis3L1 isolated from transfected 
cells degraded RNA in an exoribonucleolytic manner, and its RNB domain seemed to 
mediate this activity. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of hDis3L1 in HeLa cells 
resulted in elevated levels of poly(A)-tailed 28S rRNA degradation 
intermediates, indicating the involvement of hDis3L1 in cytoplasmic RNA decay. 
Taken together, these data indicate that hDis3L1 is a novel exosome-associated 
exoribonuclease in the cytoplasm of human cells.
