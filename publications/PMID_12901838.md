A neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of amyloid 
plaques. The major constituent of these plaques, occurring largely in brain 
areas important for memory and cognition, is the 40-42 amyloid residues (Abeta). 
Abeta is derived from the amyloid protein precursor after cleavage by the 
recently identified beta-secretase (BACE1) and the putative gamma-secretase 
complex containing presenilin 1 (PS1). In an attempt to develop a functional 
secretase enzymatic assay in yeast we demonstrate a direct binding between BACE1 
and PS1. This interaction was confirmed in vivo using coimmunoprecipitation and 
colocalization studies in human cultured cells. Our results show that PS1 
preferably binds immature BACE1, thus possibly acting as a functional regulator 
of BACE1 maturation and/or activity.
