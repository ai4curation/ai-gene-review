Yeast Spt16/Cdc68 and Pob3 form a heterodimer that acts in both DNA replication 
and transcription. This is supported by studies of new alleles of SPT16 
described here. We show that Spt16-Pob3 enhances HO transcription through a 
mechanism that is affected by chromatin modification, since some of the defects 
caused by mutations can be suppressed by deleting the histone deacetylase Rpd3. 
While otherwise conserved among many eukaryotes, Pob3 lacks the HMG1 DNA-binding 
motif found in similar proteins such as the SSRP1 subunit of human FACT. SPT16 
and POB3 display strong genetic interactions with NHP6A/B, which encodes an HMG1 
motif, suggesting that these gene products function coordinately in vivo. While 
Spt16-Pob3 and Nhp6 do not appear to form stable heterotrimers, Nhp6 binds to 
nucleosomes and these Nhp6-nucleosomes can recruit Spt16-Pob3 to form 
SPN-nucleosomes. These complexes have altered electrophoretic mobility and a 
distinct pattern of enhanced sensitivity to DNase I. These results suggest that 
Spt16-Pob3 and Nhp6 cooperate to function as a novel nucleosome reorganizing 
factor.
