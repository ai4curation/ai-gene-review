Interactome maps are valuable resources to elucidate protein function and 
disease mechanisms. Here, we report on an interactome map that focuses on 
neurodegenerative disease (ND), connects ∼5,000 human proteins via ∼30,000 
candidate interactions and is generated by systematic yeast two-hybrid 
interaction screening of ∼500 ND-related proteins and integration of literature 
interactions. This network reveals interconnectivity across diseases and links 
many known ND-causing proteins, such as α-synuclein, TDP-43, and ATXN1, to a 
host of proteins previously unrelated to NDs. It facilitates the identification 
of interacting proteins that significantly influence mutant TDP-43 and HTT 
toxicity in transgenic flies, as well as of ARF-GEP100 that controls misfolding 
and aggregation of multiple ND-causing proteins in experimental model systems. 
Furthermore, it enables the prediction of ND-specific subnetworks and the 
identification of proteins, such as ATXN1 and MKL1, that are abnormally 
aggregated in postmortem brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, suggesting 
widespread protein aggregation in NDs.

Abstract

Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) in the brain play critical roles across all aspects of the central nervous system, from synaptic transmission, glial development, myelination, to cell-to-cell communication, and more. Understanding these interactions is crucial for deciphering neurological mechanisms and the underlying biochemical machinery affected in neurological disorders. Recently, advances in proteomics techniques have significantly enhanced our ability to study interactions among the proteins expressed in the brain. Here, we review some of the high-throughput studies characterizing brain PPIs, using affinity purification, proximity labeling, co-fractionation, and chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry methods, as well as yeast two-hybrid assays. We present the current state of the field, discuss challenges, and highlight promising future directions.

Introduction

While proteins play important roles in the structure and function of every organ, they do not carry out these tasks alone, and the brain is no exception. In the central nervous system (CNS), an intricate network of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) underpins a myriad of cellular functions. Both stable and transient interactions are essential for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of neurons and other brain cell types, modulating signaling pathways, regulating neurotransmitter release, and ensuring proper neural connectivity.

For instance, neurofilaments are heteropolymers composed at their core of four protein subunits: neurofilament heavy, medium, and light chains, as well as α-internexin [ 1 , 2 ]. These subunits polymerize to form a robust and stable network of cytoskeletal filaments within the neurons, maintaining cell shape and integrity, particularly in the axon. In turn, neurofilaments are crucial for the radial growth of axons during development, for preserving axon size, and for transmitting electrical impulses along axons, which affects nerve conduction speed [ 3 , 4 ].

Disruption of PPIs has been linked to impairments of synaptic communication, protein aggregation, and dysregulation of cell death, contributing to varied neurological diseases (NDs) and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) [ 5–7 ]. For example, deletions, duplications, and point mutations in SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (SHANK3)—a gene encoding a major scaffolding protein—are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as well as several other NDDs and neuropsychiatric disorders [ 8 ]. Located in the postsynaptic density, Shank3 interacts with many proteins and complexes downstream through its component domains, regulating the formation of dendritic spines and synapses [ 8 , 9 ]. Although not fully understood, it is likely that disrupting different specific Shank3 PPIs may contribute to phenotypic diversity across these disorders.

Despite significant challenges in studying the interactions among endogenous proteins in the brain, not least due to the high complexity in terms of cells, composition, and connectivity, analytical biochemical methods have begun demonstrating good progress at accurately mapping brain PPIs. The technologies available for examining PPIs in the context of both cell lines and native tissues are diverse and have evolved significantly in the last two decades, offering scientists a range of methods to study these interactions with varying levels of detail and throughput [ 10 , 11 ]. Here, we mainly discuss studies based on high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS)-based experiments, which have emerged as powerful tools for proteomics and protein research [ 11 ]. These large-scale studies provide systematic and reasonably unbiased views of the molecular organization of the highly specialized and unique neural architectures, from dendritic trees to synaptic structures, including the postsynaptic density. We discuss the advantages and limitations of individual assays applied to fruit fly, mouse, and human brains, to human and mouse neural cell lines, and to both diseased and healthy brain tissues. Additionally, we highlight important findings from these studies that are advancing our understanding of normal neuronal biology and disease mechanisms.

Conclusions

Advances in technology are enabling increasingly detailed studies of neural connections, yet the global mapping of the molecular equivalent—the PPIs and protein functional networks in the brain—remains challenging. Recently, proteomics strategies have begun illuminating the extensive networks of protein interactions that underpin both healthy and diseased states in the CNS. In this review, we highlighted four MS-based techniques and a non-MS method that have been instrumental in mapping brain interactomes ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ). These approaches have revealed the critical roles of both stable and transient PPIs in neural function. Ongoing innovations in PPI discovery techniques are poised to enhance sensitivity and throughput, paving the way to uncover functions for many uncharacterized brain proteins.

Complementing these experimental advancements, artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools such as AlphaFold [ 65 ] and AlphaFold-Multimer [ 66 ] are revolutionizing the field of protein structure prediction and PPI research. Traditional methods for studying PPIs and protein structures, including X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, are limited in scalability, while AI-driven approaches offer unprecedented opportunities to model protein complexes with high accuracy on a large scale. In the context of brain research, where the proteome is exceptionally complex, AI predictions can aid in mapping synaptic protein networks, exploring neurodevelopmental pathways, and understanding disease mechanisms. Integrating AI-generated predictions with experimental data from proteomics approaches, such as CF-MS, PL-MS, and structural insights from XL-MS, offers the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and depth of interactome maps. As AI algorithms continue to evolve and integrate multi-modal datasets, they hold the potential to accelerate discoveries in understanding the molecular basis of neural function and dysfunction.
