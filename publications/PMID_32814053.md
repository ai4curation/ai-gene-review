Interactome maps are valuable resources to elucidate protein function and 
disease mechanisms. Here, we report on an interactome map that focuses on 
neurodegenerative disease (ND), connects ∼5,000 human proteins via ∼30,000 
candidate interactions and is generated by systematic yeast two-hybrid 
interaction screening of ∼500 ND-related proteins and integration of literature 
interactions. This network reveals interconnectivity across diseases and links 
many known ND-causing proteins, such as α-synuclein, TDP-43, and ATXN1, to a 
host of proteins previously unrelated to NDs. It facilitates the identification 
of interacting proteins that significantly influence mutant TDP-43 and HTT 
toxicity in transgenic flies, as well as of ARF-GEP100 that controls misfolding 
and aggregation of multiple ND-causing proteins in experimental model systems. 
Furthermore, it enables the prediction of ND-specific subnetworks and the 
identification of proteins, such as ATXN1 and MKL1, that are abnormally 
aggregated in postmortem brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, suggesting 
widespread protein aggregation in NDs.
