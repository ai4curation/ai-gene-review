The tumour suppressor p53, which accumulates in response to DNA damage and 
induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, has a key function in the maintenance 
of genome integrity. Under normal conditions, the antiproliferative effects of 
p53 are inhibited by MDM2, a ubiquitin ligase that promotes p53 ubiquitination 
and degradation. MDM2 is also self-ubiquitinated and degraded. Here, we show 
that the tumour suppressor RASSF1A regulates G(1)-S cell-cycle progression in a 
p53-dependent manner by promoting MDM2 self-ubiquitination and preventing p53 
degradation. Importantly, RASSF1A associates with MDM2 and 
death-domain-associated protein (DAXX) in the nucleus, thereby disrupting the 
interactions between MDM2, DAXX, and the deubiquitinase, HAUSP, and enhancing 
the self-ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2. Moreover, RASSF1A partially 
contributes to p53-dependent checkpoint activation at early time points in 
response to DNA damage. These findings reveal a new and important function for 
RASSF1A in regulating the p53-MDM2 pathway.

Abstract

The tumour suppressor p53, which accumulates in response to DNA damage and induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, has a key function in the maintenance of genome integrity. Under normal conditions, the antiproliferative effects of p53 are inhibited by MDM2, a ubiquitin ligase that promotes p53 ubiquitination and degradation. MDM2 is also self-ubiquitinated and degraded. Here, we show that the tumour suppressor RASSF1A regulates G 1 –S cell-cycle progression in a p53-dependent manner by promoting MDM2 self-ubiquitination and preventing p53 degradation. Importantly, RASSF1A associates with MDM2 and death-domain-associated protein (DAXX) in the nucleus, thereby disrupting the interactions between MDM2, DAXX, and the deubiquitinase, HAUSP, and enhancing the self-ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2. Moreover, RASSF1A partially contributes to p53-dependent checkpoint activation at early time points in response to DNA damage. These findings reveal a new and important function for RASSF1A in regulating the p53–MDM2 pathway.

Introduction

The tumour suppressor p53 has an important function in protecting the integrity of the genome. In response to various types of stress, p53 is stabilized and activated, resulting in cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or senescence ( Vogelstein et al , 2000 ; Michael and Oren, 2003 ). The stability of p53 is mainly regulated by the RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, MDM2 ( Haupt et al , 1997 ; Kubbutat et al , 1997 ), and in normal unstressed cells p53 has a short half-life. The MDM2 gene is also transactivated by p53; thus, MDM2 and p53 together form a negative feedback loop ( Prives, 1998 ). Several pathways leading to inhibition of MDM2 action have been identified, including the phosphorylation of MDM2 by DNA-damage-induced kinases ( Khosravi et al , 1999 ; Maya et al , 2001 ; Stommel and Wahl, 2004 ) and the interaction of MDM2 with other proteins ( Brooks and Gu, 2006 ; Toledo and Wahl, 2006 ), including ARF, which disrupts MDM2 regulation of p53 by inhibiting MDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity ( Kamijo et al , 1998 ; Pomerantz et al , 1998 ; Zhang et al , 1998 ; Sherr and Weber, 2000 ). Ribosomal proteins, such as L11, L23, and L5, also inhibit MDM2 activity and disrupt p53 regulation ( Lohrum et al , 2003 ; Zhang et al , 2003 ; Dai and Lu, 2004 ; Dai et al , 2004 ; Jin et al , 2004 ). Protein YY1 and the oncoprotein gankyrin have also been suggested as potentiating cofactors for MDM2, facilitating MDM2–p53 interaction and p53 ubiquitination ( Sui et al , 2004 ; Higashitsuji et al , 2005 ). Interestingly, MDM2 is an unstable protein that is ubiquitinated in an autocatalytic manner ( Fang et al , 2000 ; Stommel and Wahl, 2004 ). MDM2 distinguishes between self-ubiquitination and target p53 ubiquitination, and thus mechanisms that regulate these respective activities are important for regulation of p53 activity.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that death-domain-associated protein (DAXX), together with the deubiquitinating enzyme, HAUSP, can prevent MDM2 self-ubiquitination and enhance the activity of MDM2 towards p53, thereby promoting p53 degradation ( Tang et al , 2006 ). DAXX is also an apoptosis regulatory protein that links the death receptor Fas to c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) ( Yang et al , 1997 ). However, Daxx -null mice die at early embryonic stages because of extensive cell death, indicating an additional function for Daxx in regulating cell survival during development ( Michaelson et al , 1999 ). HAUSP (also known as USP7) interacts with p53, leading to p53 deubiquitination and stabilization ( Li et al , 2002 ). However, the ablation of HAUSP expression results in an increase in p53 and p53-dependent G 1 arrest, as well as a marked reduction in MDM2, indicating that HAUSP also has a key function in regulating MDM2 stability ( Cummins et al , 2004 ; Li et al , 2004 ; Meulmeester et al , 2005 ). Furthermore, the MDM2-related protein, MDMX, also regulates MDM2 activity, with implications for MDM2-dependent regulation of p53 ( Parant et al , 2001 ). MDMX does not directly mediate the ubiquitination and destruction of p53, but rather appears to be required for MDM2 stability and MDM2-mediated p53 degradation. However, an excess of MDMX stabilizes p53 ( Linares et al , 2003 ; Marine and Jochemsen, 2004 ).

RASSF1A is a tumour suppressor gene that is inactivated in many human cancers ( Dammann et al , 2000 ). Mice with homozygous deletions of RASSF1A are prone to tumour development ( Tommasi et al , 2005 ; van der Weyden et al , 2005 ). Both RASSF1A and RASSF1C contain C-terminal SARAH protein–protein interaction and RA domains, but differ in their N-terminal sequences. Interestingly, only RASSF1A, which serves multiple functions in a diverse series of critical cellular processes by interacting with other proteins, has been shown to function as a tumour suppressor ( Agathanggelou et al , 2005 ; Donninger et al , 2007 ). RASSF1A regulates mitotic progression by influencing microtubule dynamics and the activity of APC–Cdc20 ( Liu et al , 2003 ; Rong et al , 2004 ; Song et al , 2004 ; Vos et al , 2004 ). RASSF1A also binds the p120 E4F transcription factor, which forms a complex with both the Rb and p53 tumour suppressors ( Fenton et al , 2004 ). In addition, RASSF1A induces a G 1 arrest through inhibition of cyclin D1, thereby suggesting a function for RASSF1A in the G1–S transition ( Shivakumar et al , 2002 ). In fact, RASSF1A undergoes ubiquitin-mediated degradation by Skp2 at the G 1 –S transition ( Song et al , 2008 ). RASSF1A has also been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis, acting to link death receptor signaling to the apoptosis machinery and serving as a part of the mammalian Hippo complex, which is involved in apoptosis and cell proliferation ( Baksh et al , 2005 ; Oh et al , 2006 ; Guo et al , 2007 ). Moreover, RASSF1A induces apoptosis by promoting the dissociation of MST2 from Raf and facilitating MST2 interaction with LATS1 after Fas treatment ( Matallanas et al , 2007 ). RASSF1A and RASSF1C bind to DAXX, and RASSF1C is released from DAXX after DNA damage, subsequently translocating to cytoplasmic microtubules and activating SAPK/JNK ( Kitagawa et al , 2006 ). However, the full spectrum of RASSF1A functions, particularly in DNA-damaged cells, remains unclear. Here, we show that RASSF1A disrupts interactions among MDM2, DAXX, and HAUSP, thus enhancing MDM2 self-ubiquitination and stabilizing p53 during an early stage in response to DNA damage.

Discussion

The results described in this study demonstrate an important function for the tumour suppressor RASSF1A in controlling the MDM2–p53 pathway. RASSF1A regulated G 1 –S cell-cycle progression in a p53-dependent manner and had a function in regulating the MDM2–p53 pathway by promoting MDM2 self-ubiquitination and preventing p53 degradation at an early stage in response to DNA damage. Importantly, RASSF1A is associated with both MDM2 and DAXX in the nucleus, thereby disrupting MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP interactions and enhancing the intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2 ( Figure 8D ).

When cells are under certain types of stress, MDM2 is prevented from inhibiting p53 function, thus ensuring that p53 can execute an appropriate stress response ( Vogelstein et al , 2000 ). Here, we show that the tumour suppressor RASSF1A is associated with MDM2 and promoted MDM2 destabilization. There is considerable evidence that MDM2 trans- and self-ubiquitinating activities can be differentially regulated through MDM2 interactions with other proteins. For example, MDM2 self-ubiquitination is regulated by MDM2-selective deubiquitination by the ubiquitin hydrolase, HAUSP ( Li et al , 2004 ; Meulmeester et al , 2005 ). Intriguingly, the balance between self- and p53-ubiquitinating activities of MDM2 can be regulated by the combined actions of DAXX and HAUSP ( Tang et al , 2006 ). Both DAXX and HAUSP stabilize MDM2 and increase MDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity towards p53, and thereby trigger p53 destabilization. Here, we demonstrate that RASSF1A bound to MDM2 and DAXX and disrupted this complex ( Figure 6A ), resulting in increased MDM2 self-ubiquitination and degradation, and p53 stabilization. By contrast, both siRNA-mediated depletion of RASSF1A and genetic ablation of Rassf1a prevented dissociation of MDM2 from the complex, even after adriamycin treatment ( Figure 7C and D ). Thus, it is likely that RASSF1A contributes to the dissociation of MDM2 from DAXX and HAUSP, and increases MDM2 self-ubiquitination, at an early time point after DNA damage.

How does RASSF1A prevent DAXX–HAUSP-mediated MDM2 stabilization and stabilize p53 after DNA damage? First, consistent with a previous report ( Tang et al , 2006 ), our study showed that DAXX is a key component of the MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP complex. RASSF1A binds to both the MDM2 C-terminal region, which contains the RING finger domain, and the DAXX N-terminal region, which contains the MDM2- and HAUSP-interacting domain ( Figures 4 and 5 ) ( Tang et al , 2006 ). Thus, RASSF1A may competitively bind to the DAXX–MDM2–HAUSP complex and sequester DAXX from MDM2 and vice versa. Second, the regulation of DAXX–MDM2 dissociation by RASSF1A in response to DNA damage may be more complex than suggested by this simple competition model; other factors may be involved. It has been proposed that MDM2 dissociation from DAXX and HAUSP is partially dependent on ATM kinase ( Tang et al , 2006 ). In addition, transient destabilization of MDM2 appears to depend on the activities of kinases such as ATM, ATR, or DNA-PK, which are activated upon DNA damage ( Khosravi et al , 1999 ; Maya et al , 2001 ; Stommel and Wahl, 2004 ). However, because the phosphorylation of MDM2 at Ser395 by ATM kinase is not likely to be essential for MDM2 release from DAXX in response to DNA damage ( Tang et al , 2006 ), it is tempting to speculate that RASSF1A may function as a cofactor for DNA-damage-induced kinases in the regulation of the MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP complex. Intriguingly, we found that the interaction of MDM2 with RASSF1A was slightly increased upon DNA damage, whereas DNA damage led to a decrease in DAXX–MDM2 interactions ( Figure 7A ). Although the significance is not clear in this context, it is noteworthy that RASSF1A contains a putative phosphorylation site for ATM kinase ( Kim et al , 1999 ). In any case, the functional relationship between RASSF1A and the MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP complex and potential modulation of these interactions, by DNA-damage-induced kinases warrant further investigation. Recently, RASSF1A has been shown to disrupt the Raf1–MST2 kinase complex, thereby enhancing MST2–LATS1 interactions ( Matallanas et al , 2007 ). RASSF1A-mediated LATS1 activation promotes p73-directed transcription of the proapoptotic gene puma . Because the functions of p53 overlap with those of the p53-related proteins, p63 and p73, it is tempting to speculate that RASSF1A-activated MST2–LATS1 kinase also regulates the p53–MDM2 pathway.

RASSF1C has been shown to associate with DAXX in the nucleus ( Kitagawa et al , 2006 ). Upon DNA damage, RASSF1C dissociates from DAXX, translocates to cytoplasmic microtubules, and participates in the activation of SAPK/JNK. However, because RASSF1A remains localized to the nucleus (MS Song and D-S Lim, unpublished data), whereas RASSF1C translocates to the cytoplasm upon DNA damage, RASSF1A and RASSF1C might have distinct functions following genotoxic stress. RASSF1C associated with DAXX in vivo , but interestingly failed to disrupt the MDM2–DAXX complex in vitro and in vivo ( Figure 6D and Supplementary Figure S7A ). Moreover, RASSF1C did not affect cell-cycle distribution or the stability of MDM2 or p53 ( Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 ). It is not entirely clear why RASSF1C fails to dissociate the MDM2–DAXX complex even it is able to associate with DAXX. However, differences in the N-terminal regions of RASSF1C and RASSF1A led us to speculate that the ability of RASSF1A to interfere with MDM2–DAXX interactions might require both MDM2 binding to the N terminus of RASSF1A and DAXX binding to the C terminus of RASSF1A. Moreover, the interaction of the deubiquitination enzyme, HAUSP, with either DAXX or MDM2 was not affected by exogenous RASSF1C ( Supplementary Figure S7B and C ), suggesting that RASSF1C alone is insufficient to both completely disrupt the MDM2–DAXX–HAUSP complex and regulate MDM2 and p53 stability.

The tumour suppressor ARF binds to MDM2 and preferentially inhibits MDM2 p53-ubiquitinating activity ( Zhang et al , 1998 ; Sherr and Weber, 2000 ). The ARF-binding region of MDM2 is distinct from the RASSF1A-binding region, but the E1A-regulated transcription factor, E4F1, physically interacts with ARF and RASSF1A ( Rizos et al , 2003 ; Fenton et al , 2004 ). Thus, it will be of interest to investigate the effects of RASSF1A on the binding of ARF to MDM2. Because it has been proposed that E4F1 is an atypical p53 ubiquitin ligase that regulates p53 effector functions independently of proteolysis ( Le Cam et al , 2006 ), the effect of RASSF1A on E4F1-mediated p53 activation also warrants further investigation. The RING finger protein, MDMX, inhibits p53 transcriptional activity by directly interacting with p53 ( Shvarts et al , 1996 ; Laurie et al , 2006 ). MDMX also binds to MDM2, but whether the main effect of this binding is to stabilize MDM2, and thus indirectly inhibit p53, or whether the interaction is more important for MDMX activity by MDM2, remains to be determined. Notably, RASSF1A binds directly to the RING domain of MDM2 but not to that of MDMX (MS Song and D-S Lim, unpublished data). Future studies will be required to address the possible role of RASSF1A in regulating MDMX–MDM2 interactions.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates an important function for RASSF1A in the negative regulation of MDM2. Because MDM2 destabilization is required for a proper p53 response at early time points after DNA damage, the tumour suppressor, RASSF1A, may have an important function in the early stages of the cellular response to genotoxic stress.
