Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma 
worldwide. However, the strategy of HBV to escape from the host immune system 
remains largely unknown. In this study, we examined extracellular vesicles (EVs) 
secreted from human hepatocytes infected with HBV. EVs includeing exosomes are 
nano-size vesicles with proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs), which can be 
transmitted to different cells. We found that 104 EV associated miRNAs were 
increased in hepatocytes more than 2-fold by HBV infection. We then selected 
those that were potentially implicated in immune regulation. Among them, five 
HBV-induced miRNAs were found to potentially target multiple sequences in the 
3'UTR of IL-21, a cytokine that induces anti-viral immunity. Moreover, 
expression of a reporter gene with the 3' UTR of human IL-21 mRNA was suppressed 
by the five miRNAs individually. Finally, IL-21 expression in cloned human T 
cells was down-regulated by the five miRNAs. Collectively, this study identified 
the novel 3' UTR sequences of human IL-21 mRNA and potential binding sites of 
HBV-induced EV-miRNAs.
