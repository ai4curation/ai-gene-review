OBJECTIVE: The obesity epidemic in the United States, as well as the 
accompanying condition of type 2 diabetes, puts a majority of the population at 
an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases including coronary 
artery disease, stroke, and myocardial infarction. In contrast to white adipose 
tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) is well vascularized, rich in 
mitochondria, and highly oxidative. While it is known that the angiogenic factor 
VEGF-A is required for brown adipocyte development, the functional consequences 
and exact mechanism remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that VEGF-A plays an 
essential autocrine role in the function of BAT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mouse models were generated with an adipose-specific and 
macrophage-specific ablation of VEGF-A. Adipose tissue characteristics and 
thermogenic response were analyzed in vivo, and mitochondrial morphology and 
oxidative respiration were analyzed in vitro to assess effects of endogenous 
VEGF-A ablation.
RESULTS: VEGF-A expression levels are highest in adipocyte precursors compared 
to immune or endothelial cell populations within both WAT and BAT. Loss of 
VEGF-A in adipocytes, but not macrophages, results in decreased adipose tissue 
vascularization, with remarkably diminished thermogenic capacity in vivo. 
Complete ablation of endogenous VEGF-A decreases oxidative capacity of 
mitochondria in brown adipocytes. Further, acute ablation of VEGF-A in brown 
adipocytes in vitro impairs mitochondrial respiration, despite similar 
mitochondrial mass compared to controls.
CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that VEGF-A serves to orchestrate the 
acquisition of thermogenic capacity of brown adipocytes through mitochondrial 
function in conjunction with the recruitment of blood vessels.
