Fibroblasts are the principal cellular component of connective tissue and are 
associated with cancer cells at all stages of tumor progression. Structural and 
functional contributions of fibroblasts to the growth, survival, and invasive 
capacity of cancer cells are beginning to emerge. In breast carcinoma, 
approximately 80% of stromal fibroblasts termed cancer-associated fibroblasts 
(CAF) are thought to manifest an activated phenotype that promotes cancer cell 
proliferation tumor growth at metastatic sites similar to the primary tumor. In 
this report, we show that CAFs respond to physiologic concentrations of 
17beta-estradiol (E2) by rapidly inducing extracellular signal-regulated kinase 
phosphorylation and immediate early gene expression, including c-fos and 
connective tissue growth factor, and cyclin D1. Notably, the E2 response is 
mediated by the alternate estrogen receptor GPR30, which interfaces with the 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. In particular, E2 
stimulates a physical interaction between GPR30 and phosphorylated EGFR, 
recruiting them to the cyclin D1 gene promoter. Nuclear localization induced by 
E2 was confirmed by cellular immunofluorescence methods. GPR30 was required for 
CAF proliferation and migration induced by E2. Our results provide important new 
mechanistic insights into how CAFs are stimulated by estrogen through a 
GPR30-mediated nuclear signaling pathway. More generally, they define estrogenic 
GPR30 signaling as a functionally important component of the tumor 
microenvironment.
