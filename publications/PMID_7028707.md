## Abstract

1. J Anat. 1981 Jun;132(Pt 4):597-605.

Localization of Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein in the human kidney using 
immuno-fluorescence and immuno-electron microscopical techniques.

Sikri KL, Foster CL, MacHugh N, Marshall RD.

Small pieces of tissue obtained from apparently normal areas of four surgically 
removed adult human kidneys were used in the present study. The results obtained 
by immuno-fluorescence and immuno-electron microscopical techniques show that 
Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THP) is present in the thick ascending limbs of the 
loops of Henle and the distal convoluted tubules. Within the cells concerned, 
the protein is associated with the luminal, lateral as well as basal, plasma 
membranes and their infoldings. The cells of the macula densa are completely 
negative as are those of proximal convoluted tubules, glomeruli and collecting 
ducts. The possible significance of these findings in relation to the process of 
urine dilution in the nephron is discussed.
