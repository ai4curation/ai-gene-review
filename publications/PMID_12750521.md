The Caenorhabditis elegans transcription factor HSF-1, which regulates the 
heat-shock response, also influences aging. Reducing hsf-1 activity accelerates 
tissue aging and shortens life-span, and we show that hsf-1 overexpression 
extends lifespan. We find that HSF-1, like the transcription factor DAF-16, is 
required for daf-2-insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutations to extend life-span. Our 
findings suggest this is because HSF-1 and DAF-16 together activate expression 
of specific genes, including genes encoding small heat-shock proteins, which in 
turn promote longevity. The small heat-shock proteins also delay the onset of 
polyglutamine-expansion protein aggregation, suggesting that these proteins 
couple the normal aging process to this type of age-related disease.
