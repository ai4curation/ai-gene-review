OBJECTIVE: We have shown previously that the expression of peroxisome 
proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC1α) increases 
significantly in the white and brown adipose tissue of activating transcription 
factor 4 (ATF4) global knockout mice, which suggests that ATF4 is involved in 
the regulation of PGC1α expression. The goal of the current study is to 
investigate this possibility and elucidate the underlying cellular mechanisms.
MATERIAL/METHODS: The effects of ATF4 on PGC1α expression and on PGC1α promoter 
activity were analyzed in vivo and in vitro using mice, HIB-1B, and 293T cell 
line. The physiological functions of ATF4 in the regulation of PGC1α expression 
were confirmed by analysis of body temperature of Atf4(-/-) and Atf4(+/+) mice 
in response to cold stress as well as expression of Complex I, II, III, V in 
BAT.
RESULTS: In this study, we showed ATF4 to be a negative regulator of PGC1α 
expression through competitive binding with cAMP response element binding 
protein (CREB) at a cAMP response element (CRE) site in the PGC1α promoter. ATF4 
was also found to influence the expression of mitochondria-related proteins, 
including Complex I, II, III, and IV through regulation of PGC1α. Finally, we 
showed that Atf4(-/-) mice have higher core body temperatures in 
reduced-temperature environments than control mice.
CONCLUSION: This study describes the mechanisms underlying ATF4 regulating PGC1α 
expression. We demonstrate a novel function of ATF4 in the regulation of 
thermogenesis. Taken together, these observations provide new insight into the 
physiological functions of ATF4, especially the regulation of thermogenesis and 
the response to cold stress.
