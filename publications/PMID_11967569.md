HtrA2/Omi, a mitochondrial serine protease in mammals, is important in 
programmed cell death. However, the underlining mechanism of HtrA2/Omi-mediated 
apoptosis remains unclear. Analogous to the bacterial homolog HtrA (DegP), the 
mature HtrA2 protein contains a central serine protease domain and a C-terminal 
PDZ domain. The 2.0 A crystal structure of HtrA2/Omi reveals the formation of a 
pyramid-shaped homotrimer mediated exclusively by the serine protease domains. 
The peptide-binding pocket of the PDZ domain is buried in the intimate interface 
between the PDZ and the protease domains. Mutational analysis reveals that the 
monomeric HtrA2/Omi mutants are unable to induce cell death and are deficient in 
protease activity. The PDZ domain modulates HtrA2/Omi-mediated cell death 
activity by regulating its serine protease activity. These structural and 
biochemical observations provide an important framework for deciphering the 
mechanisms of HtrA2/Omi-mediated apoptosis.
