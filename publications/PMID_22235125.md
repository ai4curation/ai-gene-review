ETS-related gene (ERG) is a member of the ETS transcription factor family. Our 
previous studies have shown that ERG expression is highly enriched in 
endothelial cells (EC) both in vitro and in vivo. ERG expression is markedly 
repressed in response to inflammatory stimuli. It has been shown that ERG is a 
positive regulator of several EC-restricted genes including VE-cadherin, 
endoglin, and von Willebrand factor, and a negative regulator of other genes 
such as interleukin (IL)-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. In this 
study we have identified a novel role for ERG in the regulation of EC barrier 
function. ERG knockdown results in marked increases in EC permeability. This is 
associated with a significant increase of stress fiber and gap formation in EC. 
Furthermore, we identify CLDN5 as a downstream target of ERG in EC. Thus, our 
results suggest that ERG plays a pivotal role in regulating EC barrier function 
and that this effect is mediated in part through its regulation of CLDN5 gene 
expression.
