Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a type I cytokine that plays essential 
roles in allergic/inflammatory skin and airway disorders, in helminth 
infections, and in regulating intestinal immunity. TSLP signals via IL-7Rα and a 
specific TSLPR subunit that is highly related to the common cytokine receptor γ 
chain, γ(c). Although TSLP has effects on a broad range of hematopoetic cells 
and can induce STAT5 phosphorylation, TSLP was reported to not signal via JAK 
kinases, and the mechanism by which TSLP regulates STAT5 phosphorylation has 
been unclear. We now demonstrate the role of JAK1 and JAK2 in TSLP-mediated 
STAT5 phosphorylation in mouse and human primary CD4(+) T cells, in contrast to 
the known activation of JAK1 and JAK3 by the related cytokine, IL-7. We also 
show that just as JAK1 interacts with IL-7Rα, JAK2 is associated with TSLPR 
protein. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of STAT5 activation for 
TSLP-mediated survival and proliferation of CD4(+) T cells. These findings 
clarify the basis for TSLP-mediated signaling and provide an example wherein a 
cytokine uses JAK1 and JAK2 to mediate the activation of STAT5.

Abstract

Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a type I cytokine that plays essential roles in allergic/inflammatory skin and airway disorders, in helminth infections, and in regulating intestinal immunity. TSLP signals via IL-7Rα and a specific TSLPR subunit that is highly related to the common cytokine receptor γ chain, γ c . Although TSLP has effects on a broad range of hematopoetic cells and can induce STAT5 phosphorylation, TSLP was reported to not signal via JAK kinases, and the mechanism by which TSLP regulates STAT5 phosphorylation has been unclear. We now demonstrate the role of JAK1 and JAK2 in TSLP-mediated STAT5 phosphorylation in mouse and human primary CD4 + T cells, in contrast to the known activation of JAK1 and JAK3 by the related cytokine, IL-7. We also show that just as JAK1 interacts with IL-7Rα, JAK2 is associated with TSLPR protein. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of STAT5 activation for TSLP-mediated survival and proliferation of CD4 + T cells. These findings clarify the basis for TSLP-mediated signaling and provide an example wherein a cytokine uses JAK1 and JAK2 to mediate the activation of STAT5.

Discussion

The mode of signaling by TSLP has been controversial. Unlike other four α-helical bundle type 1 cytokines, TSLP was reported to not activate JAK kinases in TSLP-dependent NAG8/7 cells ( 22 ), and kinase-deficient JAK constructs were reported to not inhibit TSLP signaling in human hepatoma HepG2 cells transfected with components of the TSLP receptor and STAT5B ( 28 ). However, using transfected EPOR-TSLPR or MPL-TSLPR fusion protein constructs in cell lines and EPO- or TPO-induced homodimerization, JAK2 but not JAK1 phosphorylation was observed ( 14 , 40 ). JAK1 phosphorylation was not detected; presumably because these studies used homodimeric constructs to which JAK1 could not be recruited. Our studies included experiments that evaluated TSLP-signaling in primary mouse and human cells. Using specific antibodies, siRNA technology, and cells derived from knockout mice, we now have established the critical roles of JAK1 and JAK2 for TSLP-mediated STAT5 activation, without involvement of JAK3 and TYK2. The noninvolvement of JAK3 was anticipated as JAK3 uniquely associates with γ c , a component of the IL-7 receptor but not the TSLP receptor complex. The phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2 by TSLP correlates with the ability of these JAKs to associate with IL-7Rα and TSLPR, respectively, mediating the docking of STAT5 to IL-7Rα within the receptor complex and its phosphorylation ( Fig. 8 A ). In contrast, IL-7 induces the activation of JAK1 and JAK3, also resulting in the phosphorylation of STAT5 ( Fig. 8 B ). The differential use of ubiquitous and constitutive JAK2 versus lineage-restricted and inducible JAK3 may help to explain some of the differences in the actions of TSLP and IL-7. However, this distinction does not immediately explain differences in the biological actions of these cytokines, such as the greater effect of IL-7 than TSLP on T-cell development ( 15 , 19 ) and maintenance ( 18 , 43 ) versus the proinflammatory characteristics of TSLP in pathological conditions ( 1 , 3 , 4 ). When and where each cytokine is produced and each receptor complex is expressed and the relative affinities are major determinants of the actions of each cytokine.

Because of the suggestion that Tec family kinases might contribute to TSLP-mediated activation of STAT5 ( 28 ), we also examined TSLP signaling in T cells derived from Tec -, Itk -, and Rlk -deficient mice; however, we found no defects in TSLP-dependent STAT5 activation in any of these cells ( Fig. S2 ), confirming that JAK1 and JAK2 uniquely are required for TSLP-induced STAT5 activation.

Interestingly, JAK1 and JAK2 cooperatively mediate the signaling in response to other cytokines in addition to TSLP. For example, IFN-γ and IL-6 also signal via JAK1 and JAK2, but in these cases, STAT1 and STAT3, respectively, are the major STAT proteins that are activated ( 29 , 44 ), rather than STAT5 proteins. This difference in STAT protein utilization is consistent with differences in actions of these various cytokines. To our knowledge, TSLP is the only cytokine that uses the combination of JAK1 and JAK2 to principally activate STAT5 proteins. Our findings thus not only clarify the basis of TSLP signaling, resolving a dilemma in the literature, but together with the IFN-γ/STAT1 and IL-6/STAT3 systems underscore that multiple STAT proteins can be phosphorylated after JAK1/JAK2 activation, depending on the specific context. Moreover, we have elucidated a signaling difference between TSLP and IL-7, which has potential implications for differentially controlling the actions of these two cytokines, both of which share IL-7Rα as a critical receptor component.
