In a search for novel transcriptional intermediary factors for the estrogen 
receptor (ER), we used the ligand-binding domain and hinge region of ER as bait 
in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a cDNA library derived from tamoxifen-resistant 
MCF-7 human breast tumors from an in vivo athymic nude mouse model. Here we 
report the isolation and characterization of the forkhead homologue in 
rhabdomyosarcoma (FKHR), a recently described member of the hepatocyte nuclear 
factor 3/forkhead homeotic gene family, as a nuclear hormone receptor (NR) 
intermediary protein. FKHR interacts with both steroid and nonsteroid NRs, 
although the effect of ligand on this interaction varies by receptor type. The 
interaction of FKHR with ER is enhanced by estrogen, whereas its interaction 
with thyroid hormone receptor and retinoic acid receptor is ligand-independent. 
In addition, FKHR differentially regulates the transactivation mediated by 
different NRs. Transient transfection of FKHR into mammalian cells dramatically 
represses transcription mediated by the ER, glucocorticoid receptor, and 
progesterone receptor. In contrast, FKHR stimulates rather than represses 
retinoic acid receptor- and thyroid hormone receptor-mediated transactivation. 
Most intriguingly, overexpression of FKHR dramatically inhibits the 
proliferation of ER-dependent MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Therefore, FKHR 
represents a bifunctional NR intermediary protein that can act as either a 
coactivator or corepressor, depending on the receptor type.
