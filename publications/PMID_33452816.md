The lysosome is a cellular signalling hub at the point of convergence of 
endocytic and autophagic pathways, where the contents are degraded and recycled. 
Pleckstrin homology domain-containing family member 1 (PLEKHM1) acts as an 
adaptor to facilitate the fusion of endocytic and autophagic vesicles with the 
lysosome. However, it is unclear how PLEKHM1 function at the lysosome is 
controlled. Herein, we show that PLEKHM1 coprecipitates with, and is directly 
phosphorylated by, mTOR. Using a phosphospecific antibody against Ser432/S435 of 
PLEKHM1, we show that the same motif is a direct target for ERK2-mediated 
phosphorylation in a growth factor-dependent manner. This dual regulation of 
PLEKHM1 at a highly conserved region points to a convergence of both growth 
factor- and amino acid-sensing pathways, placing PLEKHM1 at a critical juncture 
of cellular metabolism.
