Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) are a subclass of cysteine proteases that 
catalyze the removal of ubiquitin (either monomeric or chains) from substrates, 
thus counteracting the activity of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Although the importance 
of USPs in a multitude of processes, from hereditary cancer to 
neurodegeneration, is well established, our knowledge on their mode of 
regulation, substrate specificity and biological function is quite limited. In 
this study we identify USP47 as a novel interactor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, 
Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein beta-transducin repeat-containing protein 
(SCF(beta-Trcp)). We found that both beta-Trcp1 and beta-Trcp2 bind specifically 
to USP47, and point mutations in the beta-Trcp WD-repeat region completely 
abolished USP47 binding, indicating an E3-substrate-type interaction. However, 
unlike canonical beta-Trcp substrates, USP47 protein levels were neither 
affected by silencing of beta-Trcp nor modulated in a variety of processes, such 
as cell-cycle progression, DNA damage checkpoint responses or tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF) pathway activation. Notably, genetic or siRNA-mediated depletion of 
USP47 induced accumulation of Cdc25A, decreased cell survival and augmented the 
cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs. In conclusion, we showed that USP47, a 
novel beta-Trcp interactor, regulates cell growth and survival, potentially 
providing a novel target for anticancer therapies.
