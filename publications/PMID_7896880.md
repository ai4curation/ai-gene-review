A family of genes related to the bcl-2 protooncogene has recently emerged. One 
member of this family, mcl-1, was cloned from a human myeloblastic leukemia cell 
line (ML-1) undergoing differentiation. The intracellular localization of mcl-1, 
as well as the kinetics of its expression during differentiation, have now been 
studied. These studies show that the intracellular distribution of mcl-1 
overlaps with, but is not identical to, that of bcl-2: mcl-1 is similar to bcl-2 
in that the mcl-1 protein has a prominent mitochondrial localization, and in 
that it associates with membranes through its carboxyl hydrophobic tail. mcl-1 
differs from bcl-2, however, in its relative distribution among other 
(nonmitochondrial/heavy membrane) compartments, mcl-1 also being abundant in the 
light membrane fraction of immature ML-1 cells while bcl-2 is abundant in the 
nuclear fraction. Similarly, in differentiating ML-1 cells, the timing of 
expression of mcl-1 overlaps with, but is not identical to, that of bcl-2: the 
mcl-1 protein increases rapidly as cells initiate differentiation, and mcl-1 is 
a labile protein. In contrast, bcl-2 decreases gradually as cells complete 
differentiation. Overall, the mcl-1 and bcl-2 proteins have some properties in 
common and others tht are distinct. A burst of expression of mcl-1, prominently 
associated with mitochondria, complements the continued expression of bcl-2 in 
ML-1 cells differentiating along the monocyte/macrophage pathway.
