The results of in vivo and in organellar experiments indicate that the Hsp70 
Ssq1 and the J-protein Jac1 function together to assist in the biogenesis of 
iron-sulfur (Fe/S) centers in the mitochondrial matrix. Here we present 
biochemical evidence supporting this idea. Isu, the proposed scaffold on which 
Fe/S centers are assembled, is a substrate for both Jac1 and Ssq1. Jac1 and Isu1 
cooperatively stimulate the ATPase activity of Ssq1. In addition, Jac1 
facilitates the interaction of Ssq1 with Isu1 in the presence of ATP. These 
findings are consistent with the role in Fe/S biogenesis previously proposed for 
the bacterial Hsp70 Hsc66 and J-protein Hsc20 that interact with the bacterial 
Isu homologue IscU. However, unlike the bacterial Hsp70, we found that Ssq1 has 
a high affinity for nucleotide, and shares a nucleotide exchange factor, Mge1, 
with a second mitochondrial Hsp70, Ssc1. Thus, whereas the bacterial and 
mitochondrial chaperone systems share critical features, they possess 
significant biochemical differences as well.
