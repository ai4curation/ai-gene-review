Tumor hypoxia is linked to increased metastatic potential, but the molecular 
mechanisms coupling hypoxia to metastasis are poorly understood. Here, we show 
that Notch signaling is required to convert the hypoxic stimulus into 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), increased motility, and invasiveness. 
Inhibition of Notch signaling abrogated hypoxia-induced EMT and invasion, and, 
conversely, an activated form of Notch could substitute for hypoxia to induce 
these processes. Notch signaling deploys two distinct mechanisms that act in 
synergy to control the expression of Snail-1, a critical regulator of EMT. 
First, Notch directly up-regulated Snail-1 expression by recruitment of the 
Notch intracellular domain to the Snail-1 promoter, and second, Notch 
potentiated hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) recruitment to the 
lysyl oxidase (LOX) promoter and elevated the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of 
LOX, which stabilizes the Snail-1 protein. In sum, these data demonstrate a 
complex integration of the hypoxia and Notch signaling pathways in regulation of 
EMT and open up perspectives for pharmacological intervention with 
hypoxiainduced EMT and cell invasiveness in tumors.
