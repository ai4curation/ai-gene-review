Transcriptional corepressors are frequently aberrantly over-expressed in 
prostate cancers. However, their crosstalk with the Androgen receptor (AR), a 
key player in prostate cancer development, is unclear. Using ChIP-Seq, we 
generated extensive global binding maps of AR, ERG, and commonly over-expressed 
transcriptional corepressors including HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and EZH2 in prostate 
cancer cells. Surprisingly, our results revealed that ERG, HDACs, and EZH2 are 
directly involved in androgen-regulated transcription and wired into an AR 
centric transcriptional network via a spectrum of distal enhancers and/or 
proximal promoters. Moreover, we showed that similar to ERG, these corepressors 
function to mediate repression of AR-induced transcription including 
cytoskeletal genes that promote epithelial differentiation and inhibit 
metastasis. Specifically, we demonstrated that the direct suppression of 
Vinculin expression by ERG, EZH2, and HDACs leads to enhanced invasiveness of 
prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our results highlight a novel mechanism 
by which, ERG working together with oncogenic corepressors including HDACs and 
the polycomb protein, EZH2, could impede epithelial differentiation and 
contribute to prostate cancer progression, through directly modulating the 
transcriptional output of AR.
