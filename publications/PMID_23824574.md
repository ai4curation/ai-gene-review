Several signalling cascades are implicated in the formation and patterning of 
the three principal germ layers, but their precise temporal-spatial mode of 
action in progenitor populations remains undefined. We have used conditional 
gene deletion of mouse β-catenin in Sox17-positive embryonic and extra-embryonic 
endoderm as well as vascular endothelial progenitors to address the function of 
canonical Wnt signalling in cell lineage formation and patterning. Conditional 
mutants fail to form anterior brain structures and exhibit posterior body axis 
truncations, whereas initial blood vessel formation appears normal. Tetraploid 
rescue experiments reveal that lack of β-catenin in the anterior visceral 
endoderm results in defects in head organizer formation. Sox17 lineage tracing 
in the definitive endoderm (DE) shows a cell-autonomous requirement for 
β-catenin in midgut and hindgut formation. Surprisingly, wild-type posterior 
visceral endoderm (PVE) in midgut- and hindgut-deficient tetraploid chimera 
rescues the posterior body axis truncation, indicating that the PVE is important 
for tail organizer formation. Upon loss of β-catenin in the visceral endoderm 
and DE lineages, but not in the vascular endothelial lineage, Sox17 expression 
is not maintained, suggesting downstream regulation by canonical Wnt signalling. 
Strikingly, Tcf4/β-catenin transactivation complexes accumulated on Sox17 
cis-regulatory elements specifically upon endoderm induction in an embryonic 
stem cell differentiation system. Together, these results indicate that the 
Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway regulates Sox17 expression for visceral 
endoderm pattering and DE formation and provide the first functional evidence 
that the PVE is necessary for gastrula organizer gene induction and posterior 
axis development.
