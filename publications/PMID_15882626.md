The microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) is reoriented between the nucleus and 
the leading edge in many migrating cells and contributes to directional 
migration. Models suggest that the MTOC is moved to its position during 
reorientation. By direct imaging of wound-edge fibroblasts after triggering MTOC 
reorientation with soluble factors, we found instead that the nucleus moved away 
from the leading edge to reorient the MTOC, while the MTOC remained stationary. 
Rearward nuclear movement was coupled with actin retrograde flow and was 
regulated by a pathway involving Cdc42, MRCK, myosin, and actin. Nuclear 
movement was unaffected by the inhibition of dynein, Par6, or PKCzeta, yet these 
components were essential for MTOC reorientation, as they maintained the MTOC at 
the cell centroid. These results show that nuclear repositioning is an initial 
polarizing event in migrating cells and that the positions of the nucleus and 
the MTOC are established by separate regulatory pathways.
