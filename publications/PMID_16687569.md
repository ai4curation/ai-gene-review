Cajal bodies (CBs) have been implicated in the nuclear phase of the biogenesis 
of spliceosomal U small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U snRNPs). Here, we have 
investigated the distribution of the CB marker protein coilin, U snRNPs, and 
proteins present in C/D box small nucleolar (sno)RNPs in cells depleted of 
hTGS1, SMN, or PHAX. Knockdown of any of these three proteins by RNAi interferes 
with U snRNP maturation before the reentry of U snRNA Sm cores into the nucleus. 
Strikingly, CBs are lost in the absence of hTGS1, SMN, or PHAX and coilin is 
dispersed in the nucleoplasm into numerous small foci. This indicates that the 
integrity of canonical CBs is dependent on ongoing U snRNP biogenesis. 
Spliceosomal U snRNPs show no detectable concentration in nuclear foci and do 
not colocalize with coilin in cells lacking hTGS1, SMN, or PHAX. In contrast, 
C/D box snoRNP components concentrate into nuclear foci that partially 
colocalize with coilin after inhibition of U snRNP maturation. We demonstrate by 
siRNA-mediated depletion that coilin is required for the condensation of U 
snRNPs, but not C/D box snoRNP components, into nucleoplasmic foci, and also for 
merging these factors into canonical CBs. Altogether, our data suggest that CBs 
have a modular structure with distinct domains for spliceosomal U snRNPs and 
snoRNPs.
