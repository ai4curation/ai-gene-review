The KRAB-type zinc-finger protein Apak (ATM and p53 associated KZNF protein) 
specifically suppresses p53-mediated apoptosis. Upon DNA damage, Apak is 
phosphorylated and inhibited by ATM kinase, resulting in p53 activation. 
However, how Apak is regulated in response to oncogenic stress remains unknown. 
Here we show that upon oncogene activation, Apak is inhibited in the tumor 
suppressor ARF-dependent but ATM-independent manner. Oncogene-induced ARF 
protein directly interacts with Apak and competes with p53 to bind to Apak, 
resulting in Apak dissociation from p53. Thus, Apak is differentially regulated 
in the ARF and ATM-dependent manner in response to oncogenic stress and DNA 
damage, respectively.
