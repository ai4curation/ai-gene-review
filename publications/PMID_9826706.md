This study investigated whether endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor, 
which also stimulates cell proliferation, contributes to endothelial dysfunction 
and atherosclerosis. Apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice and C57BL/6 control 
mice were treated with a Western-type diet to accelerate atherosclerosis with or 
without ETA receptor antagonist LU135252 (50 mg/kg/d) for 30 wk. Systolic blood 
pressure, plasma lipid profile, and plasma nitrate levels were determined. In 
the aorta, NO-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation, atheroma formation, ET 
receptor-binding capacity, and vascular ET-1 protein content were assessed. In 
apoE-deficient but not C57BL/6 mice, severe atherosclerosis developed within 30 
wk. Aortic ET-1 protein content (P < 0.0001) and binding capacity for ETA 
receptors was increased as compared with C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, NO-mediated, 
endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (56 +/- 3 vs. 99 +/- 2%, P < 
0.0001) and plasma nitrate were reduced (57.9 +/- 4 vs. 93 +/- 10 
micromol/liter, P < 0.01). Treatment with the ETA receptor antagonist LU135252 
for 30 wk had no effect on the lipid profile or systolic blood pressure in 
apoE-deficient mice, but increased NO-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation 
(from 56 +/- 3 to 93 +/- 2%, P < 0.0001 vs. untreated) as well as circulating 
nitrate levels (from 57.9 +/- 4 to 80 +/- 8.3 micromol/liter, P < 0.05). Chronic 
ETA receptor blockade reduced elevated tissue ET-1 levels comparable with those 
found in C57BL/6 mice and inhibited atherosclerosis in the aorta by 31% without 
affecting plaque morphology or ET receptor-binding capacity. Thus, chronic ETA 
receptor blockade normalizes NO-mediated endothelial dysfunction and reduces 
atheroma formation independent of plasma cholesterol and blood pressure in a 
mouse model of human atherosclerosis. ETA receptor blockade may have therapeutic 
potential in patients with atherosclerosis.
