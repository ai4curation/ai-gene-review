Centrosomes and their associated microtubules direct events during mitosis and 
control the organization of animal cell structures and movement during 
interphase. The centrosome replicates during the cell cycle, directs the 
assembly of bipolar mitotic spindles, and plays an important role in maintaining 
the fidelity of cell division. Recently, tumor suppressors such as p53 and 
retinoblastoma protein pRB have been localized to the centrosome in a cell 
cycle-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence microscopy and analysis of isolated 
centrosomes now provide evidence that BRCA1 protein, a suppressor of 
tumorigenesis in breast and ovary, also is associated with centrosomes during 
mitosis. Our results indicate that BRCA1 localizes with the centrosome during 
mitosis and coimmunoprecipitates with gamma-tubulin, a centrosomal component 
essential for nucleation of microtubules. Furthermore, gamma-tubulin associates 
preferentially with a hypophosphorylated form of BRCA1.

Abstract

Centrosomes and their associated microtubules direct events during mitosis and control the organization of animal cell structures and movement during interphase. The centrosome replicates during the cell cycle, directs the assembly of bipolar mitotic spindles, and plays an important role in maintaining the fidelity of cell division. Recently, tumor suppressors such as p53 and retinoblastoma protein pRB have been localized to the centrosome in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence microscopy and analysis of isolated centrosomes now provide evidence that BRCA1 protein, a suppressor of tumorigenesis in breast and ovary, also is associated with centrosomes during mitosis. Our results indicate that BRCA1 localizes with the centrosome during mitosis and coimmunoprecipitates with γ-tubulin, a centrosomal component essential for nucleation of microtubules. Furthermore, γ-tubulin associates preferentially with a hypophosphorylated form of BRCA1.

DISCUSSION

We provide here evidence demonstrating an association of BRCA1 protein with the centrosome in mitotic cells. This evidence includes the results of immunofluorescence microscopy using polyclonal and monoclonal BRCA1-specific antibodies that recognize a C-terminal and an N-terminal domain of the protein respectively (Figs. 1 and 2 ). Biochemical analysis of isolated centrosomes further supports the presence of 220-kDa BRCA1 protein in the centrosomes (Fig. 3 A ). Furthermore, quantitative analysis of the 220-kDa BRCA1 protein associated with centrosomes isolated from equal numbers of exponentially growing control cells and cells arrested in G 2 /M (Fig. 3 B ) indicates that the enrichment of BRCA1 in arrested cells is proportional to the enrichment of the G 2 /M population. This observation is consistent with results of immunofluorescence staining that localize BRCA1 to centrosomes in mitotic cells but not in interphase cells.

Coimmunoprecipitation of BRCA1 with γ-tubulin (Fig. 4 ) suggests an interaction between these two proteins. γ-Tubulin, a crucial component of the centrosome, is responsible for nucleation of microtubules. It forms complexes with other components of the centrosome such as pericentrin ( 37 ), and mammalian homologues of the yeast spindle pole body components Spc97p and Spc98p ( 38 , 39 ). However, to our knowledge, BRCA1 is the first tumor suppressor protein found to be associated with γ-tubulin, albeit perhaps indirectly, an observation that suggests that BRCA1 may be a regulator of mitotic-spindle assembly and of the G 2 /M checkpoint. Supporting evidence for involvement of BRCA1 in regulation of G 2 /M comes from a discovery by Larson et al. ( 40 ) that overexpression of a dominant-negative C-terminal peptide containing amino acids 1,293–1,863 alters G 2 /M progression and results in a decrease of the G 2 /M population and a reduction in the efficacy of colchicine in inducing G 2 /M arrest ( 40 ). It is also possible that BRCA1 associates with centrosomes during mitosis as a way to achieve appropriate distribution between the two daughter cells, as may be the case with other nuclear proteins such as NuMA ( 41 ), a molecule that also is required for the proper completion of mitosis ( 42 ). We also show that the BRCA1 protein associated with the centrosomes is hypophosphorylated (Fig. 5 ), suggesting that phosphorylation status may be important in determining the centrosome functions and/or subcellular distribution of BRCA1, or may be the result of its association with the centrosome.

BRCA1 is involved in progression of the cell cycle. Its expression and phosphorylation are cell cycle dependent, and overexpression induces growth arrest ( 43 ) or apoptosis ( 44 ). On the other hand, cellular proliferation is accelerated when BRCA1 expression is suppressed by antisense oligonucleotides ( 45 ) or by overexpression of dominant-negative BRCA1 peptides ( 40 ). Furthermore, breast tumors carrying BRCA1 mutations accumulate more chromosomal abnormalities ( 46 ) compared with breast tumors without BRCA1 mutations. It is likely that BRCA1 plays a continuous role throughout the cell cycle: expression and phosphorylation is induced at G 1 /S transition, and a complex with rad51 is associated with chromosomes during S phase and participates in DNA repair ( 10 ). Moreover, as a component of RNA polymerase II ( 8 ) or as a coactivator of p53-mediated transcription ( 9 ), BRCA1 may regulate the expression of other genes required for cell cycle progression. An increasing number of proteins involved in the G 2 /M checkpoint are found to associate with centrosomes during cell cycling, e.g., cyclin B ( 26 ), p34 cdc2 ( 27 , 28 ), p53 ( 30 ), and 14-3-3 ( 29 ). Therefore, it is possible that BRCA1 also plays a functional role with mitotic centrosomes.
