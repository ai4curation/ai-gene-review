The human Ska complex (Ska) localizing to both spindle microtubules and 
kinetochores is essential for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. 
Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how Ska is recruited 
to kinetochores, it is still not fully understood. By analyzing Ska3 
phosphorylation, we identified six critical Cdk1 sites, including the previously 
identified Thr358 and Thr360. Mutations of these sites to phospho-deficient 
alanine (6A) in cells completely abolished Ska3 localization to kinetochores and 
Ska functions in chromosome segregation. In vitro, Cdk1 phosphorylation on Ska 
enhanced WT, not phospho-deficient 6A, binding to Ndc80C. Strikingly, the 
phosphomimetic Ska 6D complex formed a stable macro-complex with Ndc80C, but Ska 
WT failed to do so. These results suggest that multisite Cdk1 
phosphorylation-enabled Ska-Ndc80 binding is decisive for Ska localization to 
kinetochores and its functions. Moreover, we found that Ska decrease at 
kinetochores triggered by the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole is 
independent of Aurora B but can be overridden by Ska3 overexpression, suggestive 
of a role of spindle microtubules in promoting Ska kinetochore recruitment. 
Thus, based on the current and previous results, we propose that multisite Cdk1 
phosphorylation is critical for the formation of Ska-Ndc80 macro-complexes that 
are essential for chromosome segregation.
