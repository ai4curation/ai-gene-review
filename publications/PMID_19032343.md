The products encoded by ski and its related gene, sno, (Ski and Sno) act as 
transcriptional co-repressors and interact with other co-repressors such as 
N-CoR/SMRT and mSin3A. Ski and Sno mediate transcriptional repression by various 
repressors, including Mad, Rb and Gli3. Ski/Sno also suppress transcription 
induced by multiple activators, such as Smads and c-Myb. In particular, the 
inhibition of TGF-beta-induced transcription by binding to Smads is correlated 
with the oncogenic activity of Ski and Sno. However, the molecular mechanism by 
which Ski and Sno mediate transcriptional repression remains unknown. In this 
study, we report the purification and characterization of Ski complexes. The Ski 
complexes purified from HeLa cells contained histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and 
protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), in addition to multiple Smad 
proteins (Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays 
indicated that these components of the Ski complexes were localized on the SMAD7 
gene promoter, which is the TGF-beta target gene, in TGF-beta-untreated HepG2 
cells. Knockdown of these components using siRNA led to up-regulation of SMAD7 
mRNA. These results indicate that Ski complexes serve to maintain a 
TGF-beta-responsive promoter at a repressed basal level via the activities of 
histone deacetylase and histone arginine methyltransferase.
