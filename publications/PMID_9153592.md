Overproduced Bcl-2 oncoprotein has been shown to suppress cell death induced by 
a variety of stimuli in many cell types, including neuronal cells. Because bcl-2 
is expressed in the nervous system where massive cell death is observed during 
development, endogenous Bcl-2 is likely to be involved in regulating neuronal 
cell death. Here we examined the possible role of endogenous Bcl-2 in the 
regulation of neuronal cell survival in the central nervous system using primary 
cultured cerebellar granule neurons from bcl-2-deficient, wild-type and 
NSE-bcl-2-transgenic mice. Cerebellar granule neurons from bcl-2-deficient mice 
were more susceptible than those from normal littermates to death induced by 
reducing the K+ concentration of the medium from high (25 mM) to low (5 mM), and 
neurons from bcl-2-transgenic mice were least susceptible. Similar results were 
obtained when cell death was induced by serum withdrawal under high K+ 
conditions or by the presence of etoposide, A23187 or nimodipine. Consistently, 
bcl-2 deficiency reduced the number of cerebellar granule neurons per mouse. 
These results indicate that Bcl-2 impedes neuronal cell death induced by various 
stimuli in a dose-dependent manner, and that endogenous levels of Bcl-2 are able 
to regulate neuronal cell survival in the central nervous system.
