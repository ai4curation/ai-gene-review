Two previously unidentified human cdc25 genes have been isolated, cdc25A and 
cdc25B. Both genes rescue a cdc25ts mutant of fission yeast. Microinjection of 
anti-cdc25A antibodies into HeLa cells causes their arrest in mitosis. cdc25A 
and cdc25B display endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity that is stimulated 
several-fold, in the absence of cdc2, by stoichiometric addition of either 
cyclin B1 or B2 but not A or D1. Association between cdc25A and cyclin B1/cdc2 
was detected in the HeLa cells. These findings indicate that B-type cyclins are 
multifunctional proteins that not only act as M phase regulatory subunits of the 
cdc2 protein kinase, but also activate the cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase, of which 
cdc2 is the physiological substrate. A region of amino acid similarity between 
cyclins and tyrosine PTPases has been detected. This region is absent in cdc25 
phosphatases. The motif may represent an activating domain that has to be 
provided to cdc25 by intermolecular interaction with cyclin B.
