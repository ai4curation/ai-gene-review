NM23-H1 is a member of the NM23/NDP kinase gene family and a putative metastasis 
suppressor. Previously, a screen for NM23-H1-interacting proteins that could 
potentially modulate its activity identified serine-threonine kinase 
receptor-associated protein (STRAP), a transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 
receptor-interacting protein. Through the use of cysteine to serine amino acid 
substitution mutants of NM23-H1 (C4S, C109S, and C145S) and STRAP (C152S, C270S, 
and C152S/C270S), we demonstrated that the association between these two 
proteins is dependent on Cys(145) of NM23-H1 and Cys(152) and Cys(270) of STRAP 
but did not appear to involve Cys(4) and Cys(109) of NM23-H1, suggesting that a 
disulfide linkage involving Cys(145) of NM23-H1 and Cys(152) or Cys(270) of 
STRAP mediates complex formation. The interaction was dependent on the presence 
of dithiothreitol or beta-mercaptoethanol but not H(2)O(2). Ectopic expression 
of wild-type NM23-H1, but not NM23-H1(C145S), negatively regulated TGF-beta 
signaling in a dose-dependent manner, enhanced stable association between the 
TGF-beta receptor and Smad7, and prevented nuclear translocation of Smad3. 
Similarly, wild-type NM23-H1 inhibited TGF-beta-induced apoptosis and growth 
inhibition, whereas NM23-H1(C145S) had no effect. Knockdown of NM23-H1 by small 
interfering RNA stimulated TGF-beta signaling. Coexpression of wild-type STRAP, 
but not STRAP(C152S/C270S), significantly stimulated NM23-H1-induced growth of 
HaCaT cells. These results suggest that the direct interaction of NM23-H1 and 
STRAP is important for the regulation of TGF-beta-dependent biological activity 
as well as NM23-H1 activity.
