The class II deacetylase histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) negatively regulates the 
transcription factor MEF2. HDAC4 is believed to repress MEF2 transcriptional 
activity by binding to MEF2 and catalyzing local histone deacetylation. Here we 
report that HDAC4 also controls MEF2 by a novel SUMO E3 ligase activity. We show 
that HDAC4 interacts with the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and is itself 
sumoylated. The overexpression of HDAC4 leads to prominent MEF2 sumoylation in 
vivo, whereas recombinant HDAC4 stimulates MEF2 sumoylation in a reconstituted 
system in vitro. Importantly, HDAC4 promotes sumoylation on a lysine residue 
that is also subject to acetylation by a MEF2 coactivator, the acetyltransferase 
CBP, suggesting a possible interplay between acetylation and sumoylation in 
regulating MEF2 activity. Indeed, MEF2 acetylation is correlated with MEF2 
activation and dynamically induced upon muscle cell differentiation, while 
sumoylation inhibits MEF2 transcriptional activity. Unexpectedly, we found that 
HDAC4 does not function as a MEF2 deacetylase. Instead, the NAD+-dependent 
deacetylase SIRT1 can potently induce MEF2 deacetylation. Our studies reveal a 
novel regulation of MEF2 transcriptional activity by two distinct classes of 
deacetylases that affect MEF2 sumoylation and acetylation.
