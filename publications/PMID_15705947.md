Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings undergo photomorphogenesis in the light and 
etiolation in the dark. Long Hypocotyl in Far-Red 1 (HFR1), a basic 
helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is required for both phytochrome 
A-mediated far-red and cryptochrome 1-mediated blue light signaling. Here, we

26S proteasome-dependent pathway. Light, irrespective of its quality, enhances 
HFR1 protein accumulation via promoting its stabilization. We demonstrate that 
HFR1 physically interacts with Constitutive Photomorphogenesis 1 (COP1) and that 
COP1 exhibits ubiquitin ligase activity toward HFR1 in vitro. In addition, we 
show that COP1 is required for degradation of HFR1 in vivo. Furthermore, plants 
overexpressing a C-terminal 161-amino acid fragment of HFR1 (CT161) display 
enhanced photomorphogenesis, suggesting an autonomous function of CT161 in 
promoting light signaling. This truncated HFR1 gene product is more stable than 
the full-length HFR1 protein in darkness, indicating that the COP1-interacting 
N-terminal portion of HFR1 is essential for COP1-mediated destabilization of 
HFR1. These results suggest that light enhances HFR1 protein accumulation by 
abrogating COP1-mediated degradation of HFR1, which is necessary and sufficient 
for promoting light signaling. Additionally, our results substantiate the E3 
ligase activity of COP1 and its critical role in desensitizing light signaling.

Abstract

Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings undergo photomorphogenesis in the light and etiolation in the dark. Long Hypocotyl in Far-Red 1 (HFR1), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is required for both phytochrome A–mediated far-red and cryptochrome 1–mediated blue light signaling. Here, we report that HFR1 is a short-lived protein in darkness and is degraded through a 26S proteasome-dependent pathway. Light, irrespective of its quality, enhances HFR1 protein accumulation via promoting its stabilization. We demonstrate that HFR1 physically interacts with Constitutive Photomorphogenesis 1 (COP1) and that COP1 exhibits ubiquitin ligase activity toward HFR1 in vitro. In addition, we show that COP1 is required for degradation of HFR1 in vivo. Furthermore, plants overexpressing a C-terminal 161–amino acid fragment of HFR1 (CT161) display enhanced photomorphogenesis, suggesting an autonomous function of CT161 in promoting light signaling. This truncated HFR1 gene product is more stable than the full-length HFR1 protein in darkness, indicating that the COP1-interacting N-terminal portion of HFR1 is essential for COP1-mediated destabilization of HFR1. These results suggest that light enhances HFR1 protein accumulation by abrogating COP1-mediated degradation of HFR1, which is necessary and sufficient for promoting light signaling. Additionally, our results substantiate the E3 ligase activity of COP1 and its critical role in desensitizing light signaling.

INTRODUCTION

As sessile organisms, plants have evolved a high degree of developmental plasticity to optimize their growth and reproduction in response to their environment and various biotic and abiotic stresses. Light is one of the major environmental signals that influences diverse aspects of plant growth and development throughout their life cycle, such as seed germination, seedling deetiolation, gravitropism and phototropism, chloroplast movement, shade avoidance, circadian rhythms, and flowering time ( Deng and Quail, 1999 ; Wang and Deng, 2003 ).

One of the best-studied plant photoresponses is seedling photomorphogenic development. In the dark, Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings undergo skotomorphogenesis (etiolation) and exhibit long hypocotyls, closed cotyledons, and apical hooks and development of the proplastids into etioplasts. By contrast, light-grown seedlings undergo photomorphogenesis (deetiolation) and typically exhibit short hypocotyls, open and expanded cotyledons, and development of the proplastids into green mature chloroplasts ( McNellis and Deng, 1995 ).

Arabidopsis uses two major classes of photoreceptors to mediate seedling deetiolation. The cryptochromes (cry1 and cry2) absorb the blue/UV-A (320 to 500 nm) light, whereas the phytochromes (phyA to phyE) predominantly regulate responses to red (600 to 700 nm) and far-red light (700 to 750 nm) ( Kendrick and Kronenberg, 1994 ; Briggs and Olney, 2001 ; Lin, 2002 ). phyB to phyE predominantly regulate light responses under continuous red and white light, whereas phyA primarily regulates various far-red light responses, including inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, opening of the apical hook, expansion of cotyledons, accumulation of anthocyanin, and far-red light preconditioned blocking of greening ( Nagatani et al., 1993 ; Whitelam et al., 1993 ; Neff et al., 2000 ).

Molecular and genetic studies in Arabidopsis have identified numerous light signaling intermediates, including both positive and negative regulators of light signaling (for review, see Quail, 2002 ; Wang and Deng, 2004 ). Notably, a group of proteins named Constitutive Photomorphogenic/De-Etiolated/Fusca (COP/DET/FUS) function downstream of multiple photoreceptors (including both phytochromes and cryptochromes) to repress photomorphogenesis ( Wei and Deng, 1996 ). Among them, the RING finger protein Constitutive Photomorphogenesis 1 (COP1) seems to be a key regulator ( Deng et al., 1992 ). It was shown that COP1 possesses E3 ligase activity toward a group of photomorphogenesis-promoting factors, including HY5, LAF1, and phyA, and is responsible for their targeted degradation, thus desensitizing light signaling ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ; Saijo et al., 2003 ; Seo et al., 2003 , 2004 ).

In addition to these negative regulators of light signaling, one positive regulator, HY5, also acts downstream of both phytochromes and cryptochromes ( Oyama et al., 1997 ). HY5 encodes a basic domain/leucine zipper transcription factor whose abundance is correlated with the extent of photomorphogenesis ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ). Moreover, many signaling components specific for individual photoreceptors have been identified, and most of them have been characterized at the molecular level. Among them, PIF3, NDPK2, PKS1, COG1, PFT1, and PRR7 are shared by both phyA and phyB; GI, ELF3, ELF4, ARR4, PIF4, and SRR1 are specific for phyB signaling; and FHY1, FHY3, FAR1, PAT1, Long Hyopocotyl in Far-Red 1 (HFR1), LAF1, LAF3, LAF6, FIN219, SPA1, and EID1 are specific for phyA signaling. SUB1, a Ca 2+ binding protein, represses cryptochrome signaling and modulates phytochrome signaling, whereas PP7 is a positive regulator of blue light signaling (for review, see Quail, 2002 ; Wang and Deng, 2004 ). At present, the biochemical functions and the mechanisms dictating the specificity of these signaling molecules are largely unknown.

HFR1/REP1/RSF1 (hereafter, we used HFR1 ) was originally identified as a positive regulator of phyA signaling. It encodes an atypical basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor of 292 amino acids. hfr1 loss-of-function mutants are defective in a subset of phyA-mediated far-red light responses, including inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, suppression of hypocotyl negative gravitropism, and induction of CAB (encoding chlorophyll a / b binding protein) gene expression, without affecting far-red light preconditioned blocking of greening and induction of CHS (encoding chalcone synthase) gene expression ( Fairchild et al., 2000 ; Fankhauser and Chory, 2000 ; Soh et al., 2000 ). More recently, it was reported that hfr1 alleles also have reduced deetiolation responses when grown in blue light, including hypocotyl elongation, cotyledon opening, and anthocyanin accumulation. The analysis of double mutants between hfr1 and different blue light photoreceptor mutants demonstrated that, in addition to its role in phyA signaling, HFR1 is a component of cry1-mediated blue light signaling ( Duek and Fankhauser, 2003 ). Thus, HFR1 may represent a point of signal integration from phyA and cry1, either as a convergence of two independent signaling pathways or as a result of interaction of phyA and cry1 at the photoreceptor molecule level ( Ahmad et al., 1998 ).

It was previously demonstrated that HFR1 mRNA levels are high in seedlings grown under continuous darkness, far-red, and blue light, whereas HFR1 transcript levels are very low in seedlings grown in continuous red light, irrespective of their fluence rates ( Fairchild et al., 2000 ; Soh et al., 2000 ; Duek and Fankhauser, 2003 ). Thus, light-quality control of HFR1 transcript levels could serve as a mechanism for specifying HFR1 activity in far-red and blue light signaling. Kinetic analysis of HFR1 accumulation demonstrated that HFR1 transcript levels increase in response to far-red or blue light, but decrease in response to red or white light. However, the levels of HFR1 transcript change slowly. HFR1 mRNA levels are not apparently affected by a 2-h red light treatment, slight reductions are seen in seedlings treated with red light for 4 h, and there is a twofold decline after 18 h of red light treatment. Prolonged red light treatment is required to further reduce HFR1 transcript levels ( Duek and Fankhauser, 2003 ). Considering the rapidity of plant responses to changes in their light environment, the slow kinetics of HFR1 transcript level change might not be the sole or primary mechanism for regulating HFR1 activity. Consistent with this notion, a recent report showed that transgenic plants overexpressing a full-length HFR1 gene display no apparent phenotypic alternations under far-red light ( Yang et al., 2003 ), supporting the notion that HFR1 activity might be regulated at the translational or posttranslational level.

In this study, we show that the level of HFR1 protein correlates with the magnitude of Arabidopsis seedling photomorphogenesis and is a key regulator of this process. We demonstrate that HFR1 is a short-lived protein in darkness and its accumulation is enhanced by light. Regulated degradation of HFR1 is mediated by the 26S proteasome. We present genetic, molecular, and biochemical evidence to support that COP1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting HFR1 for degradation, thus desensitizing light signaling. Together with previously reported data, our study suggests that control of HFR1 activity in light signaling involves regulation of its message RNA and protein at the posttranscriptional and posttranslational levels.
