The Wilms' tumor gene, WT1, is expressed in few tissues, mainly the developing 
kidney, genitourinary system, and mesothelium, and in immature hematopoietic 
cells. To develop an understanding of the role of WT1 in development and 
tumorigenesis, we have identified transcriptional regulatory elements that 
function in transient reporter gene constructs transfected into kidney and 
hematopoietic cell lines. We found three transcription start sites of the WT1 
gene and have identified an essential promoter region by deletion analysis. The 
WT1 promoter is a member of the GC-rich, TATA-less, and CCAAT-less class of 
polymerase II promoters. Whereas the WT1 promoter is similar to other tumor 
suppressor gene promoters, the WT1 expression pattern (unlike Rb and p53) is 
tissue-restricted. The WT1 GC-rich promoter is promiscuous, functioning in all 
cell lines tested, independent of WT1 expression. This finding suggests that the 
promoter is not tissue-specific, but that tissue-specific expression of WT1 is 
modulated by additional regulatory elements. Indeed, we have identified a 
transcriptional enhancer located 3' of the WT1 gene > 50 kilobases downstream 
from the promoter. This orientation-independent enhancer increases the basal 
transcription rate of the WT1 promoter in the human erythroleukemia cell line 
K562, but not in any of the other cell lines tested.
