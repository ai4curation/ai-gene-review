Promoter-specific recruitment of histone acetyltransferase activity is often 
critical for transcriptional activation. We present a detailed study of the 
interaction between the histone acetyltransferase complexes SAGA and NuA4, and 
transcription activators. We demonstrate by affinity chromatography and 
photo-cross-linking label transfer that acidic activators directly interact with 
Tra1p, a shared subunit of SAGA and NuA4. Mutations within the COOH-terminus of 
Tra1p disrupted its interaction with activators and resulted in gene-specific 
transcriptional defects that correlated with lowered promoter-specific histone 
acetylation. These data demonstrate that the essential Tra1 protein serves as a 
common target for activators in both SAGA and NuA4 acetyltransferases.
