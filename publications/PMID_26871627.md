The amyloid hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease (AD) posits a neuron-centric, 
linear cascade initiated by Aβ and leading to dementia. This direct causality is 
incompatible with clinical observations. We review evidence supporting a long, 
complex cellular phase consisting of feedback and feedforward responses of 
astrocytes, microglia, and vasculature. The field must incorporate this holistic 
view and take advantage of advances in single-cell approaches to resolve the 
critical junctures at which perturbations initially amenable to compensatory 
feedback transform into irreversible, progressive neurodegeneration.
