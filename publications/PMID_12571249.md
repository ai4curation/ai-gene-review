Syndecan-4 is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that acts as a 
coreceptor with integrins in focal adhesion formation. The central region of 
syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain (4V; LGKKPIYKK) binds phosphatidylinositol 
4,5-bisphosphate, and together they regulate protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha) 
activity. Syndecan 4V peptide directly potentiates PKC alpha activity, leading 
to "superactivation" of the enzyme, apparently through an interaction with its 
catalytic domain. We now have performed yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding 
assays to determine the interaction sites between 4V and PKC alpha. Full-length 
PKC alpha weakly interacted with 4V by yeast two-hybrid assays, but PKC alpha 
constructs that lack the pseudosubstrate region or constructs of the whole 
catalytic domain interacted more strongly. A mutated 4V sequence (4V(YF): 
LGKKPIFKK) did not interact with PKC alpha, indicating that tyrosine 192 in the 
syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain might be critical for this interaction. Further 
assays identified a novel interaction site in the C terminus of the catalytic 
domain of PKC alpha (amino acid sequence 513-672). This encompasses the 
autophosphorylation sites, which are implicated in activation and stability. 
Yeast two-hybrid data were confirmed by in vitro binding and 
coimmunoprecipitation assays. The interaction of syndecan-4 with PKC alpha 
appears unique since PKC delta and epsilon did not interact with 4V in yeast 
two-hybrid assays or coimmunoprecipitate with syndecan-4. Finally, 
overexpression of syndecan-4 in rat embryo fibroblast cells, but not expression 
of the YF mutant, increased PKC alpha localization to focal adhesions. The data 
support a mechanism where syndecan-4 binds PKC alpha and localizes it to focal 
adhesions, whose assembly may be regulated by the kinase.
