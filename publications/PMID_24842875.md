Histone acetyl transferases (HATs) play distinct roles in many cellular 
processes and are frequently misregulated in cancers. Here, we study the 
regulatory potential of MYST1-(MOF)-containing MSL and NSL complexes in mouse 
embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and neuronal progenitors. We find that both 
complexes influence transcription by targeting promoters and TSS-distal 
enhancers. In contrast to flies, the MSL complex is not exclusively enriched on 
the X chromosome, yet it is crucial for mammalian X chromosome regulation as it 
specifically regulates Tsix, the major repressor of Xist lncRNA. MSL depletion 
leads to decreased Tsix expression, reduced REX1 recruitment, and consequently, 
enhanced accumulation of Xist and variable numbers of inactivated X chromosomes 
during early differentiation. The NSL complex provides additional, 
Tsix-independent repression of Xist by maintaining pluripotency. MSL and NSL 
complexes therefore act synergistically by using distinct pathways to ensure a 
fail-safe mechanism for the repression of X inactivation in ESCs.DOI:
