Using differential mRNA display (DD-PCR), a novel cDNA, FxC1 (Fracture Callus 1) 
was isolated from the early stages of a healing fractured femur. Utilizing 5' 
RACE PCR, a 598-bp full-length cDNA was obtained for FxC1 that contains an open 
reading frame (ORF) of 243 bp, encoding for an 80 amino acid protein. Within 
this ORF, a leucine zipper motif was present. In vitro transcription/translation 
of the full-length cDNA generated the expected 9-kDa protein. Northern analysis 
reveals that this gene is expressed in calluses harvested from post-fracture day 
5, 7 and 10, as well as in several other tissues and bone-derived cell lines. 
During the differentiation of MC3T3 cells along the osteoblast lineage, FxC1 
expression increases 3- to 4-fold during the production and deposition of matrix 
proteins, suggesting a possible role for this protein in cell differentiation.
