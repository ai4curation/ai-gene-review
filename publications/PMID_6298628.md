Relaxin is a peptide hormone synthesized in the corpora lutea of ovaries during 
pregnancy and is released into the blood stream prior to parturition. Its major 
biological effect is to remodel the mammalian reproductive tract to facilitate 
the birth process. Determination of the structure of human relaxin is thus a 
first step in opening up the possibility of clinical intervention in cases of 
difficult labour. However, the limited availability of human ovaries during 
pregnancy has prevented both direct amino acid sequence determination and 
isolation of cDNA clones obtained from relaxin producing tissue. Our approach 
has therefore been to screen directly for a human relaxin gene using an 
homologous porcine relaxin cDNA probe. We report here the successful 
identification of a genomic clone from which the structure of the entire coding 
region of a human preprorelaxin gene has been determined. Synthesis of 
biologically active relaxin has shown that the novel gene structure described 
herein codes for an authentic human relaxin. We believe this is the first 
successful synthesis of a biologically active hormone whose structure was 
predicted solely from the structure of a genomic clone.
