During cardiac excitation contraction coupling, the arrival of an action 
potential at the ventricular myocardium triggers voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ 
(CaV1.2) channels in individual myocytes to open briefly. The level of this Ca2+ 
influx tunes the amplitude of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from ryanodine receptors 
(RyR2) on the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum and thus the magnitude of the 
elevation in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and ultimately the downstream 
contraction. The number and activity of functional CaV1.2 channels at the 
t-tubule dyads dictates the amplitude of the Ca2+ influx. Trafficking of these 
channels and their auxiliary subunits to the cell surface is thus tightly 
controlled and regulated to ensure adequate sarcolemmal expression to sustain 
this critical process. To that end, recent discoveries have revealed the 
existence of internal reservoirs of preformed CaV1.2 channels that can be 
rapidly mobilized to enhance sarcolemmal expression in times of acute stress 
when hemodynamic and metabolic demand increases. In this review, we provide an 
overview of the current thinking on CaV1.2 channel trafficking dynamics in the 
heart. We highlight the numerous points of control including the biosynthetic 
pathway, the endosomal recycling pathway, ubiquitination, and lysosomal and 
proteasomal degradation pathways, and discuss the effects of β-adrenergic and 
angiotensin receptor signaling cascades on this process.
