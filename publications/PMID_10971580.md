Human HtrA2 is a novel member of the HtrA serine protease family and shows 
extensive homology to the Escherichia coli HtrA genes that are essential for 
bacterial survival at high temperatures. HumHtrA2 is also homologous to human 
HtrA1, also known as L56/HtrA, which is differentially expressed in human 
osteoarthritic cartilage and after SV40 transformation of human fibroblasts. 
HumHtrA2 is upregulated in mammalian cells in response to stress induced by both 
heat shock and tunicamycin treatment. Biochemical characterization of humHtrA2 
shows it to be predominantly a nuclear protease which undergoes autoproteolysis. 
This proteolysis is abolished when the predicted active site serine residue is 
altered to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. In human cell lines, it is 
present as two polypeptides of 38 and 40 kDa. HumHtrA2 cleaves beta-casein with 
an inhibitor profile similar to that previously described for E. coli HtrA, in 
addition to an increase in beta-casein turnover when the assay temperature is 
raised from 37 to 45 degrees C. The biochemical and sequence similarities 
between humHtrA2 and its bacterial homologues, in conjunction with its nuclear 
location and upregulation in response to tunicamycin and heat shock suggest that 
it is involved in mammalian stress response pathways.
