The enzymatic activity of yeast gene product Deg1 was identified using both 
disrupted yeast strain and cloned recombinant protein expressed in yeast and in 
Escherichia coli. The results show that the DEG1-disrupted yeast strain lacks 
synthase activity for the formation of pseudouridines psi 38 and psi 39 in tRNA 
whereas the other activities, specific for psi formation at positions 13, 27, 
28, 32, 34, 35, 36, and 55 in tRNA, remain unaffected. Also, the His6-tagged 
recombinant yeast Deg1p expressed in E. coli as well as a protein fusion with 
protein A in yeast display the enzymatic activity only toward psi 38 and psi 39 
formation in different tRNA substrates. Therefore, Deg1p is the third 
tRNA:pseudouridine synthase (Pus3p) characterized so far in yeast. Disruption of 
the DEG1 gene is not lethal but reduces considerably the yeast growth rate, 
especially at an elevated temperature (37 degrees C). Deg1p localizes both in 
the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. 
Identification of the pseudouridine residues present (or absent) in selected 
naturally occurring cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs from DEG1-disrupted 
strain points out a common origin of psi 38- and psi 39-synthesizing activity in 
both of these two cellular compartments. The sensitivity of Pus3p (Deg1p) 
activity to overall three-dimensional tRNA architecture and to a few individual 
mutations in tRNA was also studied. The results indicate the existence of subtle 
differences in the tRNA recognition by yeast Pus3p and by its homologous 
tRNA:pseudouridine synthase truA from E. coli (initially called hisT or PSU-I 
gene product).
