Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling is frequently deregulated in a variety 
of cancers and is constitutively active in estrogen receptor negative (ER-) 
breast cancer subtypes. These molecular subtypes of breast cancer are associated 
with poor overall survival. We focused on mechanisms of NF-κB regulation by 
microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate eukaryotic gene expression at the 
post-transcriptional level. In a previous genome-wide miRNA screen, we had 
identified miR-30c-2-3p as one of the strongest negative regulators of NF-κB 
signaling. Here we have uncovered the underlying molecular mechanisms and its 
consequences in breast cancer. In vitro results show that miR-30c-2-3p directly 
targets both TNFRSF1A-associated via death domain (TRADD), an adaptor protein of 
the TNFR/NF-κB signaling pathway, and the cell cycle protein Cyclin E1 (CCNE1). 
Ectopic expression of miR-30c-2-3p downregulated essential cytokines IL8, IL6, 
CXCL1, and reduced cell proliferation as well as invasion in MDA-MB-231 breast 
cancer cells. RNA interference (RNAi) induced silencing of TRADD phenocopied the 
effects on invasion and cytokine expression caused by miR-30c-2-3p, while 
inhibition of CCNE1 phenocopied the effects on cell proliferation. We further 
confirmed the tumor suppressive role of this miRNA using a dataset of 781 breast 
tumors, where higher expression was associated with better survival in breast 
cancer patients. In summary we have elucidated the mechanism by which 
miR-30c-2-3p negatively regulates NF-κB signaling and cell cycle progression in 
breast cancer.
