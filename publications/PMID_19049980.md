Chromosomal amplification occurs frequently in solid tumors and is associated 
with poor prognosis. Several reports demonstrated the cooperative effects of 
oncogenic factors in the same amplicon during cancer development. However, the 
functional correlation between the factors remains unclear. Transforming growth 
factor (TGF)-beta signaling plays important roles in cytostasis and normal 
epithelium differentiation, and alterations in TGF-beta signaling have been 
identified in many malignancies. Here, we demonstrated that transcriptional 
co-repressors of TGF-beta signaling, SKI and MDS1/EVI1-like gene 1 (MEL1), were 
aberrantly expressed in MKN28 gastric cancer cells by chromosomal 
co-amplification of 1p36.32. SKI and MEL1 knockdown synergistically restored 
TGF-beta responsiveness in MKN28 cells and reduced tumor growth in vivo. MEL1 
interacted with SKI and inhibited TGF-beta signaling by stabilizing the inactive 
Smad3-SKI complex on the promoter of TGF-beta target genes. These findings 
reveal a novel mechanism where distinct transcriptional co-repressors are 
co-amplified and functionally interact, and provide molecular targets for 
gastric cancer treatment.
