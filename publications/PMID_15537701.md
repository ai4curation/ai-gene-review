Neurons express adaptor (AP)-3 complexes assembled with either ubiquitous 
(beta3A) or neuronal-specific (beta3B) beta3 isoforms. However, it is unknown 
whether these complexes indeed perform distinct functions in neuronal tissue. 
Here, we explore this hypothesis by using genetically engineered mouse models 
lacking either beta3A- or beta3B-containing AP-3 complexes. Somatic and 
neurological phenotypes were specifically associated with the ubiquitous and 
neuronal adaptor deficiencies, respectively. At the cellular level, AP-3 
isoforms were localized to distinct neuronal domains. beta3B-containing AP-3 
complexes were preferentially targeted to neuronal processes. Consistently, 
beta3B deficiency compromised synaptic zinc stores assessed by Timm's staining 
and the synaptic vesicle targeting of membrane proteins involved in zinc uptake 
(ZnT3 and ClC-3). Surprisingly, despite the lack of neurological symptoms, 
beta3A-deficient mouse brain possessed significantly increased synaptic zinc 
stores and synaptic vesicle content of ZnT3 and ClC-3. These observations 
indicate that the functions of beta3A- and beta3B-containing complexes are 
distinct and divergent. Our results suggest that concerted nonredundant 
functions of neuronal and ubiquitous AP-3 provide a mechanism to control the 
levels of selected membrane proteins in synaptic vesicles.
