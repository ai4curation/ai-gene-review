Ethylene behaves as a hormone in plants, regulating such aspects of growth and 
development as fruit ripening, flower senescence, and abscission. Ethylene 
insensitivity is conferred by dominant mutations in the ETR1 gene early in the 
ethylene signal transduction pathway of Arabidopsis thaliana. The ETR1 gene was 
cloned by the method of chromosome walking. Each of the four known etr1 mutant 
alleles contains a missense mutation near the amino terminus of the predicted 
protein. Although the sequence of the amino-terminal half of the deduced ETR1 
protein appears to be novel, the carboxyl-terminal half is similar in sequence 
to both components of the prokaryotic family of signal transducers known as the 
two-component systems. Thus, an early step in ethylene signal transduction in 
plants may involve transfer of phosphate as in prokaryotic two-component 
systems. The dominant etr1-1 mutant gene conferred ethylene insensitivity to 
wild-type Arabidopsis plants when introduced by transformation.
