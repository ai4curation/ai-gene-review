PIWI proteins and piRNAs have been linked to transposon silencing in the 
primordial mouse testis, but their function in the adult testis remains elusive. 
Here we report the cytological characterization of piRNAs in the adult mouse 
testis and the phenotypic analysis of Miwi(-/-); Mili(-/-) mice. We show that 
piRNAs are specifically present in germ cells, especially abundant in 
spermatocytes and early round spermatids, regardless of the type of the genomic 
sequences to which they correspond. piRNAs and PIWI proteins are present in both 
the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the cytoplasm, they are enriched in the chromatoid 
body; whereas in the nucleus they are enriched in the dense body, a 
male-specific organelle associated with synapsis and the formation of the XY 
body during meiosis. Moreover, by generating Miwi(-/-); Mili(-/-) mice, which 
lack all PIWI proteins in the adult, we show that PIWI proteins and presumably 
piRNAs in the adult are required only for spermatogenesis. Spermatocytes without 
PIWI proteins are arrested at the pachytene stage, when the sex chromosomes 
undergo transcriptional silencing to form the XY body. These results pinpoint a 
function of the PIWI protein subfamily to meiosis during spermatogenesis.
