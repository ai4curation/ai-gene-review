Oxidative damage to neutrophils in glutathione synthetase deficiency.

Spielberg SP, Boxer LA, Oliver JM, Allen JM, Schulman JD.

Several episodes of neutropenia were observed in a child with glutathione 
synthetase deficiency (5-oxoprolinuria). Studies of the patient's 
glutathione-deficient neutrophils were undertaken to examine the responses of 
the cells to oxidative stress associated with phagocytosis. The patient's 
neutrophils contained 10--20% of normal glutathione content. Circulating 
neutrophils in infection-free periods appeared less mature than normal by 
morphologic criteria, suggesting increased cell turnover. The cells ingested 
particles, responded to chemotactic stimuli, and oxidized 1-14C glucose 
normally. However, following ingestion of particles, the cells accumulated 
excess hydrogen peroxide compared with normal cells, and showed impaired protein 
iodination and bacterial killing. Electron micrographs revealed damage to 
microtubules and membranous structures in the patient's neutrophils during 
phagocytosis. The level of glutathione in the cells appears inadequate to 
protect against peroxide generated during normal cell function, and the cells 
are thus damaged and rendered less effective in bacterial killing. The data 
provide evidence for a protective role of glutathione in normal neutrophil 
function.
