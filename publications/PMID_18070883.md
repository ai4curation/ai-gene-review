Sprouty (SPRY) proteins modulate receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling and, 
thereby, regulate cell migration and proliferation. Here, we have examined the 
role of endogenous human SPRY2 (hSPRY2) in the regulation of cellular apoptosis. 
Small inhibitory RNA-mediated silencing of hSPRY2 abolished the anti-apoptotic 
action of serum in adrenal cortex adenocarcinoma (SW13) cells. Silencing of 
hSPRY2 decreased serum- or epidermal growth factor (EGF)-elicited activation of 
AKT and ERK1/2 and reduced the levels of EGF receptor. Silencing of hSPRY2 also 
inhibited serum-induced activation of p90RSK and decreased phosphorylation of 
pro-apoptotic protein BAD (BCL2-antagonist of cell death) by p90RSK. Inhibiting 
both the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways abolished the ability of serum to protect 
against apoptosis, mimicking the effects of silencing hSPRY2. Serum 
transactivated the EGF receptor (EGFR), and inhibition of the EGFR by a 
neutralizing antibody attenuated the anti-apoptotic actions of serum. Consistent 
with the role of EGFR and perhaps other growth factor receptors in the 
anti-apoptotic actions of serum, the tyrosine kinase binding domain of c-Cbl 
(Cbl-TKB) protected against down-regulation of the growth factor receptors such 
as EGFR and preserved the anti-apoptotic actions of serum when hSpry2 was 
silenced. Additionally, silencing of Spry2 in c-Cbl null cells did not alter the 
ability of serum to promote cell survival. Moreover, reintroduction of wild type 
hSPRY2, but not its mutants that do not bind c-Cbl or CIN85 into SW13 cells 
after endogenous hSPRY2 had been silenced, restored the anti-apoptotic actions 
of serum. Overall, we conclude that endogenous hSPRY2-mediated regulation of 
apoptosis requires c-Cbl and is manifested by the ability of hSPRY2 to sequester 
c-Cbl and thereby augment signaling via growth factor receptors.

Abstract

Sprouty (SPRY) proteins modulate receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling and, thereby, regulate cell migration and proliferation. Here, we have examined the role of endogenous human SPRY2 (hSPRY2) in the regulation of cellular apoptosis. Small inhibitory RNA-mediated silencing of hSPRY2 abolished the anti-apoptotic action of serum in adrenal cortex adenocarcinoma (SW13) cells. Silencing of hSPRY2 decreased serum- or epidermal growth factor (EGF)-elicited activation of AKT and ERK1/2 and reduced the levels of EGF receptor. Silencing of hSPRY2 also inhibited serum-induced activation of p90RSK and decreased phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic protein BAD (BCL2-antagonist of cell death) by p90RSK. Inhibiting both the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways abolished the ability of serum to protect against apoptosis, mimicking the effects of silencing hSPRY2. Serum transactivated the EGF receptor (EGFR), and inhibition of the EGFR by a neutralizing antibody attenuated the anti-apoptotic actions of serum. Consistent with the role of EGFR and perhaps other growth factor receptors in the anti-apoptotic actions of serum, the tyrosine kinase binding domain of c-Cbl (Cbl-TKB) protected against down-regulation of the growth factor receptors such as EGFR and preserved the anti-apoptotic actions of serum when hSpry2 was silenced. Additionally, silencing of Spry2 in c-Cbl null cells did not alter the ability of serum to promote cell survival. Moreover, reintroduction of wild type hSPRY2, but not its mutants that do not bind c-Cbl or CIN85 into SW13 cells after endogenous hSPRY2 had been silenced, restored the anti-apoptotic actions of serum. Overall, we conclude that endogenous hSPRY2-mediated regulation of apoptosis requires c-Cbl and is manifested by the ability of hSPRY2 to sequester c-Cbl and thereby augment signaling via growth factor receptors.

DISCUSSION

In this report we have investigated the role of endogenous hSPRY2 in the regulation of cell survival. Although significant amounts of other hSPRY isoforms (hSPRY4 and hSPRY1) are also expressed in SW13 cells ( supplemental Fig. S2 ), it is the specific knock down of hSPRY2 that abolishes the anti-apoptotic actions of serum. This suggests that there is not much redundancy among the expressed hSPRY isoforms and that the functions of each isoform may be selective and specific. In this context a recent report ( 48 ) has shown that although all four isoforms of mammalian Sprouty proteins interact with caveolin-1, they differ in their cooperation with caveolin-1 in regulating signaling from specific growth factors.

An important finding reported here is that endogenous hSPRY2 plays a crucial, permissive role in the anti-apoptotic actions of serum. Thus, the depletion of endogenous SPRY2 in SW13 cells or PMEFs by siRNA or genetic manipulations, respectively, abolished the anti-apoptotic actions of serum. We also show that serum mediates its actions via activation of growth factor receptors, such as the EGFR, and the inhibition of the EGFR attenuates both the transactivation of the EGFR and the anti-apoptotic actions of serum. Concerning the downstream signaling processes, silencing of hSPRY2 markedly attenuates the activation of the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways in response to both serum and growth factors such as EGF with a concomitant decrease in activation of p90RSK and phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein BAD. Notably, in SW13 cells both the AKT and ERK1/2 pathways appear to contribute to the anti-apoptotic action of serum, and inhibition of either pathway partly attenuated the ability of serum to protect against apoptosis. However, when both the AKT and ERK1/2 pathways were inhibited, the ability of serum to protect against apoptosis was obliterated.

Mechanistically, the attenuation of serum-elicited downstream signaling after silencing of hSPRY2 is related to the amount of growth factor receptors such as EGFR. Thus, it is now well established that hSPRY2 provides an alternate docking site for c-Cbl on Tyr-55 after this residue is phosphorylated ( 31 , 33 ). The sequestration of c-Cbl in this manner decreases ubiquitylation and degradation of growth factor receptors, such as the EGFR. Indeed, when hSPRY2 was silenced, the amount of EGFR was decreased ( Fig. 2 D ), and because serum mediates its actions via activation of EGFR ( Fig. 5 ) and possibly other growth factor receptors, the downstream signaling is also diminished. Consistent with a role for c-Cbl in mediating the permissive actions of hSPRY2 in the anti-apoptotic actions of serum, the expression of the dominant negative c-Cbl (Cbl-TKB) in cells when hSPRY2 was silenced mimicked the actions of hSPRY2 and permitted serum to protect against apoptosis. Moreover, Cbl-TKB also restored the amount of EGFR ( Fig. 6 A ). A role for c-Cbl in mediating the actions of Spry2 is clearly shown by the experiments using wild type and c-Cbl null MEFs. Thus, ablation of c-Cbl expression obliterated the ability of Spry2 to modulate cell survival in response to serum ( Fig. 6 E ). That the hSPRY2 regulates c-Cbl activity and function is shown by our findings that when hSPRY2 was silenced, the activation of c-Cbl by both EGF and serum was markedly enhanced ( Figs. 6, C and D ).

Further evidence for the involvement of c-Cbl in the modulation of the anti-apoptotic actions of hSPRY2 is provided by our experiments with the Y55F mutant of hSPRY2. Hence, the Y55F mutant of hSPRY2 that does not bind c-Cbl ( 31 , 33 ) but acts as a dominant negative form of hSPRY2 mimicked the actions of silencing hSPRY2. Thus, the Y55F hSPRY2 decreased AKT and ERK1/2 activation by EGF as well as serum ( supplemental Fig. S3 ) and also obliterated the anti-apoptotic actions of serum ( Fig. 7 B ). Additionally, Y55F hSPRY2 also decreased the amount of EGFR ( supplemental Fig. S3 , D and E ). Moreover, when hSPRY2 was silenced, TAT-HA-hSPRY2, but not TAT-HA-hSPRY2 Y55F mutant, was able to rescue the anti-apoptotic actions of serum. Together these data demonstrate that endogenous hSPRY2, by modulating the amount of growth factor receptors (via c-Cbl), plays an important role in regulating cell survival in response to serum.

The C-terminal proline-rich region of hSPRY2 ( 304 P XX- PPR 309 ) has been shown to bind CIN85, and the mutation of this region or the c-Cbl binding Tyr-55 attenuates the ability of hSPRY2 to inhibit internalization and degradation of growth factor receptors ( 31 , 46 ). In keeping with the findings of Haglund et al. ( 46 ) that both the CIN85 and c-Cbl binding on hSPRY2 are necessary to protect growth factor receptor degradation, our data also show that mutation of either the proline-rich region (hSPRY2 CT-3A) or the c-Cbl binding site (hSPRY2 Y55F) abrogates the ability of hSPRY2 to restore the anti-apoptotic actions of serum. Thus, although the c-Cbl binding site (Tyr-55) is intact in the hSPRY2 CT-3A mutant, unlike the wt-hSPRY2, this mutant cannot restore the anti-apoptotic actions of serum. These findings lend further credence to the contention that hSPRY2, by sequestering c-Cbl, reduces growth factor receptor degradation and permits serum to activate downstream signaling that protects cells from apoptosis.

Interestingly, in the context of the CT-3A mutations, the Y55F mutation also loses its ability to act as a dominant negative, suggesting that the C-terminal proline-rich region is necessary for the dominant-negative actions of Y55F mutant of hSPRY2. Recently, in studies involving the overexpression of hSPRY2 and fibroblast growth factor, the C-terminal proline-rich region of hSPRY2 has also shown to be the site of Grb2 interaction ( 49 ). By binding Grb2, this proline-rich region has been shown to attenuate the activation of ERK1/2 by growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor ( 49 ). Notably in our studies, silencing of hSPRY2 diminishes the activation of ERK1/2 as well as AKT and not augment them. Thus, it would appear that the hSPRY2/Grb2 interactions that would inhibit ERK1/2 activation do not play a role in the functions of endogenous hSPRY2 studied in this report. In this respect, recently the N-terminal region comprising amino acid 50–60 of hSPRY2 has also been shown to bind protein phosphatase 2A and dephosphorylate hSPRY2 on two serine residues and expose the C-terminal proline-rich region ( 50 ). Interestingly, although both protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and c-Cbl compete for binding the N-terminal region encompassed by amino acid 50–60, there are distinct cellular pools of hSPRY2 that either bind PP2A or c-Cbl ( 50 ). Our evidence, especially the experiments with Cbl-TKB and c-Cbl null MEFs, suggest a central role for c-Cbl in preserving the amount of growth factor receptors and in reinstating the ability of serum to protect cells from apoptosis when endogenous hSPRY2 is depleted. Thus, it would appear that the pool of hSPRY2 that is accessible for c-Cbl interaction is the predominant pool of hSPRY2 that regulates the ability of serum to induce cell survival.

In conclusion, our data show that serum-mediated anti-apoptotic actions in SW13 cells involve the activation of receptor-tyrosine kinases such as the EGFR. Silencing of endogenous hSPRY2 by decreasing the amount of growth factor receptors attenuates the activation of the pro-survival downstream signaling processes such as ERK1/2, AKT, and RSK. As determined by genetic ablation, c-Cbl is required to mediate the regulatory actions of hSPRY2 on cellular apoptosis. Endogenous hSPRY2, by sequestering c-Cbl, protects growth factor receptors such as EGFR from degradation and permits serum to protect cells from apoptosis. The mutation of either the c-Cbl or CIN85 binding region on hSPRY2 abrogates its ability to restore the anti-apoptotic function of serum, confirming the role of c-Cbl/CIN85/hSPRY2 interactions in this process. In this context this is the first report demonstrating a novel role for hSPRY2 in regulating cell survival.
