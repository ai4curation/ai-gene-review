In gene silencing, Hsp90 chaperone machinery assists Argonaute (Ago) binding and 
unwinding of silencing small RNA (sRNA) duplexes. This enables the formation of 
effector RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that often displays cargo 
preferences. Hence, in Drosophila, microRNAs (miRNAs) and small-interfering RNAs 
(siRNAs) are differentially sorted into Ago1-RISC and Ago2-RISC, respectively. 
Here, we identify fly Cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40) as a testis-specialized Hsp90 
co-chaperone essential for spermatogenesis and for modulating Ago2-RISC 
formation. We show that testis-distinctive Ago-sorting and strand-selection 
mechanisms accumulate a unique set of miRNAs on Ago2. Cyp40 interacts with 
duplex-incorporating Ago2 through Hsp90 in vitro and selectively promotes the 
build-up of Ago2-bound miRNAs, but not endogenous siRNAs, in vivo. Moreover, one 
of Cyp40-dependent Ago2-sorted miRNAs is required for late spermatogenesis, 
unraveling the physiological relevance of the unconventional yet conserved 
Drosophila miRNA-Ago2 sorting pathway. Collectively, these results identify 
RISC-regulatory roles for Hsp90 machinery and, more generally, highlight the 
tissue-specific adaptation of sRNA pathways through chaperone diversification.
