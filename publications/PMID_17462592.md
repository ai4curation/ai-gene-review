The TOR signaling pathway regulates cell growth and metabolism in response to 
various nutrient signals by forming complexes with either rictor or raptor. To 
distinguish the physiological roles of the complexes formed by the two different 
TOR partners, we compared the in vivo functions of rictor and raptor in 
Drosophila. In rictor-null mutants, Akt-induced tissue hyperplasia was reduced 
and Akt-Ser-505 phosphorylation was decreased. Furthermore, FOXO-dependent 
apoptosis, which is inhibited by Akt, was augmented in the rictor-null 
background, indicating that rictor is essential for the Akt-FOXO signaling 
module. We found that neither S6K-dependent cell growth nor S6K-Thr-398 
phosphorylation was affected in rictor-null mutants. However, the knockdown of 
another TOR binding partner, raptor, decreased S6K-Thr-398 phosphorylation and 
inhibited S6K-induced cell overgrowth. Collectively, our findings strongly 
support that the association of TOR with rictor or raptor plays pivotal roles in 
TOR-mediated cell apoptosis and growth control by differentially regulating Akt- 
and S6K-dependent signaling pathways, respectively.
