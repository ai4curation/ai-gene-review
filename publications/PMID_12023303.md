Arabidopsis COP1 acts to repress photomorphogenesis in the absence of light. It 
was shown that in the dark, COP1 directly interacts with the bZIP transcription 
factor HY5, a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis, and promotes its 
proteasome-mediated degradation. Here we identify a novel bZIP protein HYH, as a 
new target of COP1. We identify a physical and genetic interaction between HYH 
and COP1 and show that this interaction results in dark-specific degradation of 
HYH. Genetic analysis indicates that HYH is predominantly involved in blue-light 
regulation of development and gene expression, and that the function of HYH in 
part overlaps with that of HY5. The accumulation of HYH protein, not the mRNA, 
is dependent on the presence of HY5. Our data suggest that HYH and HY5 can, 
respectively, act as heterodimers and homodimers, thus mediating light-regulated 
expression of overlapping as well as distinct target genes. We propose that COP1 
mediates light control of gene expression through targeted degradation of 
multiple photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription factors in the nucleus.

Abstract

Arabidopsis COP1 acts to repress photomorphogenesis in the absence of light. It was shown that in the dark, COP1 directly interacts with the bZIP transcription factor HY5, a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis, and promotes its proteasome-mediated degradation. Here we identify a novel bZIP protein HYH, as a new target of COP1. We identify a physical and genetic interaction between HYH and COP1 and show that this interaction results in dark-specific degradation of HYH. Genetic analysis indicates that HYH is predominantly involved in blue-light regulation of development and gene expression, and that the function of HYH in part overlaps with that of HY5. The accumulation of HYH protein, not the mRNA, is dependent on the presence of HY5. Our data suggest that HYH and HY5 can, respectively, act as heterodimers and homodimers, thus mediating light-regulated expression of overlapping as well as distinct target genes. We propose that COP1 mediates light control of gene expression through targeted degradation of multiple photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription factors in the nucleus.

The HYH–COP1 interaction results in degradation of HYH in the dark

So far the only known target of COP1-mediated protein degradation is the HY5 transcription factor. Because HYH, like HY5, interacts with the WD40 domain of COP1, we set out to examine whether HYH might be a target of COP1-mediated protein degradation in darkness. To this end we grew wild-type seedlings and seedlings overexpressing HYH (HYH-OE) in white light for 3 d and then transferred them to darkness for 24, 48, and 72 h. Protein extracts were prepared 3 days after germination (DAG) and after indicated time in darkness. The protein concentration was normalized, and the levels of HYH protein were assayed by Western blot using HYH-specific polyclonal antibodies.

As seen in Figure 3 A, the endogenous HYH protein is detected in 3-DAG seedlings. The polyclonal HYH antisera consistently detect two protein bands of ∼27 kD and 21 kD, respectively. Both bands are lost in the hyh mutant (Fig. 4 ), suggesting that they are encoded by the HYH gene. However, the relative level of the 21-kD protein differed between experiments, suggesting that this protein could be a degradation product. The apparent molecular mass of HYH is higher than the predicted 16.9 kD. We do not know the reason for the higher apparent molecular weight, but it is worth noting that the related HY5 protein, predicted to be ∼18 kD, migrated as a 30-kD band in SDS-PAGE.

Interestingly, when the 3-DAG light-grown seedlings were transferred to darkness for 24 h, the level of HYH protein was reduced to below the detection level. This indicates a dark-specific reduction of HYH protein levels. When the HYH protein was overexpressed from the constitutive 35S promoter, the level was also dramatically reduced upon transfer to darkness. This suggests that the reduction is regulated at a posttranscriptional level (Fig. 3 A).

Discussion

This study identifies HYH as a target of COP1-mediated protein degradation in the dark. We show that HYH mediates light-dependent transcription and revealed a functional relationship between HYH and HY5.

The interaction with the WD40 domain of COP1 results in COP1-dependent degradation of HYH

We identified HYH in a yeast two-hybrid screen using full-length COP1 protein as a bait. We characterized the interaction between HYH and COP1 in yeast and found that the interactions require both the WD40 domain in COP1 and a functional COP1-interacting motif in HYH. Additional and independent support for the interaction between HYH and COP1 was obtained using GFP and BFP fusions of the proteins in living plant cells. Furthermore, the allele-specific ability of an hyh mutation to suppress the block-of-greening phenotype in viable cop1 alleles shows a genetic interaction between the two genes, thus providing genetic support for the interaction.

Previous work suggested that the interaction between COP1 and HY5 resulted in COP1-dependent degradation of HY5 in the dark ( Osterlund et al. 2000 ). In an effort to analyze a potential functional role of the interaction between COP1 and HYH, we assayed the levels of HYH protein upon transfer to darkness. As with HY5, we found that the level of endogenous HYH protein is dramatically decreased after 24 h in the dark. Our results suggest that the decrease occurs on a posttranscriptional level because a similar decrease in HYH protein levels was seen in seedlings overexpressing the HYH protein from a heterologous promoter. Similar to HY5, the reduction of HYH protein levels requires the activity of the COP/DET/FUS proteins, and no reduction of HYH protein is seen in cop/det/fus mutants after 20 h in darkness. Finally, we show a direct correlation between HYH interaction with amino-acid-substituted COP1 proteins in yeast two-hybrid assays and the ability of the same substituted COP1 proteins to mediate dark-dependent degradation of HYH. This strongly supports the notion that the interaction between COP1 and HYH, like the interaction between COP1 and HY5, results in a direct COP1-mediated degradation of HYH in the dark.

Yeast two-hybrid methods and onion experiments

The λACT cDNA expression library (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center no. CD4-22) was converted into a pACT library according to Durfee et al. (1993) . The two-hybrid screen was performed essentially as described in Kim et al. (1997) . The β-galactosidase assays were performed as previously described ( Holm et al. 2001 ). The pRTL2–S65TGFP–HYH and pRTL2–BFP–COP1 constructs, containing versions of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) that have optimum excitations by blue and UV light and have maximum emission for green and blue light, respectively ( von Arnim et al. 1998 ), were introduced into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment as previously described ( Ang et al. 1998 ). After bombardment, the onion cell layers were incubated at 22°C for 48 h in darkness. The cell layers were then mounted in water and examined by epifluorescence microscopy as previously described ( Ang et al. 1998 ).
