Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations are found in low-grade gliomas, and the 
product of the IDH mutant (MT), 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), is the first known 
oncometabolite. However, the roles of the IDH wild type (WT) in high-grade 
glioblastoma, which rarely has the IDH mutation, are still unknown. To 
investigate possible pathways related to IDH WT in gliomas, we carried out 
bioinformatics analysis, and found that IDH1 has several putative calmodulin 
(CaM) binding sites. Pull-down and quantitative dissociation constant (Kd) 
measurements using recombinant proteins showed that IDH1 WT indeed binds to CaM 
with a higher affinity than IDH1 R132H MT. This biochemical interaction was 
demonstrated also in the cellular environment by immunoprecipitation with 
glioblastoma cell extracts. A synthetic peptide for the suggested binding region 
interfered with the interaction between CaM and IDH1, confirming the specificity 
of the binding. Direct binding between the synthetic peptide and CaM was 
observed in an NMR binding experiment, which additionally revealed that the 
peptide initially binds to the C-lobe of CaM. The physiological meaning of the 
CaM-IDH1 WT binding was shown with trifluoperazine (TFP), a CaM antagonist, 
which disrupted the binding and inhibited survival and migration of glioblastoma 
cells with IDH1 WT. As CaM signaling is activated in glioblastoma, our results 
suggest that IDH1 WT may be involved in the CaM-signaling pathway in the 
tumorigenesis of high-grade gliomas.
