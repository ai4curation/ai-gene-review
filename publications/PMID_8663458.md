In eukaryotic cells, accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) results in a transcriptional induction of a number of ER 
chaperone proteins. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the putative transmembrane 
receptor kinase, Ire1p (Ern1p), has been implicated as the sensor of unfolded 
proteins in the ER that initiates transmittance of the unfolded protein signal 
from the ER to the nucleus. We have shown that the cytoplasmic domain of Ire1p 
receptor indeed has intrinsic Ser/Thr kinase activity and contains Ser/Thr 
phosphorylation sites as well. The cytoplasmic domain is also shown to form 
oligomers in vivo and in vitro. The ability to form oligomers primarily resides 
within the last 130 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain, a region that is 
dispensable for in vitro kinase activity of the receptor. Oligomerization of the 
cytoplasmic domains is required for receptor trans-phosphorylation and 
subsequent activation of the kinase function. The activated kinase may transmit 
the unfolded protein signal from the ER to the nucleus to activate the 
transcription of the chaperone genes in the nucleus.
