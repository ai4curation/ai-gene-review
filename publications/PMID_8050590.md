The alpha-subunit of the TRAP complex (TRAP alpha) is a single-spanning membrane 
protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which is found in proximity of nascent 
polypeptide chains translocating across the membrane. Here, we demonstrate the 
widespread occurrence of TRAP alpha in eukaryotes as indicated by its existence 
in man, fish and plants. Despite the fact that the sequence homology is much 
lower than for other proteins in the translocation site, the overall topology, 
the location of the glycosylation sites and, most interestingly, the 
distribution of charges are conserved. These data indicate that the TRAP complex 
has a ubiquitous function.
