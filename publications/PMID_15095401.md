Formin homology-2-domain containing protein 1 (FHOD1) regulates gene 
transcription, actin-cytoskeleton structure, and cell migration. To gain insight 
into the mechanisms by which FHOD1 mediates these diverse activities, a 
yeast-two-hybrid screen was performed to identify FHOD1-binding proteins. Three 
proteins specifically interacted with the carboxy-terminal two-thirds of FHOD1, 
which includes the FH1, FH2, and diaphanous activating domains (DAD). The newly 
identified FHOD1-binding proteins are protein kinase C binding protein 1 
(PRKCBP1), cyclophilin B, and an isoform of WASP-interacting SH3-domain 
protein/diaphanous-interacting protein 1 (WISH/DIP1), named WISH-B. The 
proline-rich FH1 domain of FHOD1 was sufficient to interact with the central 
portion of PRKCP1 and full-length cyclophilin B. The FH1 domain also interacted 
with full-length WISH-B, but the extreme amino-terminus was sufficient to 
associate with WISH-B as well. WISH-B altered the solubility of FHOD1 in vitro 
and a truncation mutant containing the amino-terminal 227 residues of WISH-B 
disrupted FHOD1-induced stress fibers. WISH-B did not affect FHOD1-induced gene 
transcription through the serum response factor (SRF) recognition site on the 
skeletal alpha actin promoter (SkA). However, stabilization of F-actin prevented 
FHOD1 dependent activation of this promoter in presence of high, but not low 
serum concentrations. Thus, the identification of a new FHOD1-binding protein 
provides insight into the mechanisms by which FHOD1 regulates actin 
polymerization and transcription.
