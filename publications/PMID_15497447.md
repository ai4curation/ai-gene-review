Present work reported the cloning and characterization of a human novel RNA 
binding gene Partner of NOB1 (PNO1), with a length of 1637bp and a putative open 
reading frame of 759 bp, isolated from human kidney. It is composed of seven 
exons and is localized on chromosome 2p14. Western blot showed that the 
molecular weight of PNO1 is about 35kDa. RT-PCR results in 16 human tissues 
indicated that PNO1 is expressed mainly in liver, lung, spleen and kidney, 
slightly in thymus, testis, ovary, respectively, but not in heart, brain, 
skeletal muscle, placenta, pancreas, prostate, small intestine, colon and 
peripheral blood leukocytes. GFP fusion expression in mammalian cells exhibited 
its localization in the nucleus, especially in nucleoli. Subcellular 
localization of thirteen GFP fusion PNO1 deletion proteins showed that the 
region of 92-230 aa is solely responsible for its nucleolar retention, and KH 
domain alone is not sufficient for nucleolar retention. The PNO1 family shows 
significant conservation in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
