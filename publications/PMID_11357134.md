Cryptochromes are flavin/pterin-containing proteins that are involved in 
circadian clock function in Drosophila and mice. In mice, the cryptochromes Cry1 
and Cry2 are integral components of the circadian oscillator within the brain 
and contribute to circadian photoreception in the retina. In Drosophila, 
cryptochrome (CRY) acts as a photoreceptor that mediates light input to 
circadian oscillators in both brain and peripheral tissue. A Drosophila cry 
mutant, cryb, leaves circadian oscillator function intact in central circadian 
pacemaker neurons but renders peripheral circadian oscillators largely 
arrhythmic. Although this arrhythmicity could be caused by a loss of light 
entrainment, it is also consistent with a role for CRY in the oscillator. A 
peripheral oscillator drives circadian olfactory responses in Drosophila 
antennae. Here we show that CRY contributes to oscillator function and 
physiological output rhythms in the antenna during and after entrainment to 
light-dark cycles and after photic input is eliminated by entraining flies to 
temperature cycles. These results demonstrate a photoreceptor-independent role 
for CRY in the periphery and imply fundamental differences between central and 
peripheral oscillator mechanisms in Drosophila.
