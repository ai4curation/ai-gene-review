Endothelin-1 (Edn1), originally identified as a vasoconstrictor peptide, is 
involved in the development of cranial/cardiac neural crest-derived tissues and 
organs. In craniofacial development, Edn1 binds to Endothelin type-A receptor 
(Ednra) to induce homeobox genes Dlx5/Dlx6 and determines the mandibular 
identity in the first pharyngeal arch. However, it remains unsolved whether this 
pathway is also critical for pharyngeal arch artery development to form thoracic 
arteries. Here, we show that the Edn1/Ednra signaling is involved in pharyngeal 
artery development by controlling the fate of neural crest cells through a 
Dlx5/Dlx6-independent mechanism. Edn1 and Ednra knock-out mice demonstrate 
abnormalities in pharyngeal arch artery patterning, which include persistent 
first and second pharyngeal arteries, resulting in additional branches from 
common carotid arteries. Neural crest cell labeling with Wnt1-Cre transgene and 
immunostaining for smooth muscle cell markers revealed that neural crest cells 
abnormally differentiate into smooth muscle cells at the first and second 
pharyngeal arteries of Ednra knock-out embryos. By contrast, Dlx5/Dlx6 knockout 
little affect the development of pharyngeal arch arteries and coronary arteries, 
the latter of which is also contributed by neural crest cells through an 
Edn-dependent mechanism. These findings indicate that the Edn1/Ednra signaling 
regulates neural crest differentiation to ensure the proper patterning of 
pharyngeal arch arteries, which is independent of the regional identification of 
the pharyngeal arches along the dorsoventral axis mediated by Dlx5/Dlx6.
