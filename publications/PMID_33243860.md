The 14-subunit metazoan-specific Integrator contains an endonuclease that 
cleaves nascent RNA transcripts. Here, we identified a complex containing 
Integrator and protein phosphatase 2A core enzyme (PP2A-AC), termed INTAC. The 
3.5-angstrom-resolution structure reveals that nine human Integrator subunits 
and PP2A-AC assemble into a cruciform-shaped central scaffold formed by the 
backbone and shoulder modules, with the phosphatase and endonuclease modules 
flanking the opposite sides. As a noncanonical PP2A holoenzyme, the INTAC 
complex dephosphorylates the carboxy-terminal repeat domain of RNA polymerase II 
at serine-2, -5, and -7 and thus regulates transcription. Our study extends the 
function of PP2A to transcriptional regulation and reveals how dual enzymatic 
activities-RNA cleavage and RNA polymerase II dephosphorylation-are structurally 
and functionally integrated into the INTAC complex.
