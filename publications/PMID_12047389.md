The effect of the extracellular chaperone, clusterin, on amyloid fibril 
formation by lipid-free human apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) was investigated. 
Sub-stoichiometric levels of clusterin, derived from either plasma or semen, 
potently inhibit amyloid formation by apoC-II. Inhibition is dependent on 
apoC-II concentration, with more effective inhibition by clusterin observed at 
lower concentrations of apoC-II. The average sedimentation coefficient of 
apoC-II fibrils formed from apoC-II (0.3 mg.mL-1) is reduced by coincubation 
with clusterin (10 microg x mL(-1)). In contrast, addition of clusterin (0.1 mg 
x mL(-1)) to preformed apoC-II amyloid fibrils (0.3 mg x mL(-1)) does not affect 
the size distribution after 2 days. This sedimentation velocity data suggests 
that clusterin inhibits fibril growth but does not promote fibril dissociation. 
Electron micrographs indicate similar morphologies for amyloid fibrils formed in 
the presence or absence of clusterin. The substoichiometric nature of the 
inhibition suggests that clusterin interacts with transient amyloid nuclei 
leading to dissociation of the monomeric subunits. We propose a general role for 
clusterin in suppressing the growth of extracellular amyloid.
