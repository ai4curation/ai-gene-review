B7-H4 is a recently identified B7 family member. We previously showed that 
ovarian tumor and associated macrophages expressed B7-H4; tumor B7-H4+ 
macrophages and CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) suppressed 
tumor-associated antigen-specific T-cell immunity. To determine the pathologic 
relationship between B7-H4, macrophages, and Treg cells in the tumor 
environment, in addition to Treg cell numbers, we quantified B7-H4 expression in 
the tumor and tumor-associated macrophages in 103 patients with ovarian 
carcinoma. We observed that the intensity of B7-H4 expression in macrophages was 
significantly correlated with Treg cell numbers in the tumor. Further, both Treg 
cells and macrophage B7-H4, but not tumor B7-H4, were negatively associated with 
patient outcome. Tumor Treg cells enabled macrophages to spontaneously produce 
interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-6. Tumor macrophages stimulated B7-H4 expression in 
an autocrine manner through IL-10 and IL-6. Our previous work showed that 
tumor-associated macrophages spontaneously produced chemokine CCL22 to mediate 
Treg cell trafficking into tumor, and Treg cells induced B7-H4 on 
antigen-presenting cells (APC) including macrophages. Altogether, our data 
support the concept that there is a mechanistic interaction between Treg cells 
and macrophage, and that Treg cells may convey the suppressive activity to APCs 
through B7-H4 induction in human ovarian cancer.
