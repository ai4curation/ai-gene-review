Salmonella's success at proliferating intracellularly and causing disease 
depends on the translocation of a major virulence protein, SifA, into the host 
cell. SifA recruits membranes enriched in lysosome associated membrane protein 1 
(LAMP1) and is needed for growth of Salmonella induced filaments (Sifs) and the 
Salmonella containing vacuole (SCV). It directly binds a host protein called 
SKIP (SifA and kinesin interacting protein) which is critical for membrane 
stability and motor dynamics at the SCV. SifA also contains a WxxxE motif, 
predictive of G protein mimicry in bacterial effectors, but whether and how it 
mimics the action of a host G protein is not known. We show that SKIP's 
pleckstrin homology domain, which directly binds SifA, also binds to the late 
endosomal GTPase Rab9. Knockdown studies suggest that both SKIP and Rab9 
function to maintain peripheral LAMP1 distribution in cells. The Rab9:SKIP 
interaction is GTP-dependent and is inhibited by SifA binding to the SKIP 
pleckstrin homology domain, suggesting that SifA may be a Rab9 antagonist. 
SifA:SKIP binding is significantly tighter than Rab9:SKIP binding and may thus 
allow SifA to bring SKIP to the SCV via SKIP's Rab9-binding site. Rab9 can 
measurably reverse SifA-dependent LAMP1 recruitment and the perinuclear location 
of the SCV in cells. Importantly, binding to SKIP requires SifA residues W197 
and E201 of the conserved WxxxE signature sequence, leading to the speculation 
that bacterial G protein mimicry may result in G protein antagonism.
