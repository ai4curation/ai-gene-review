Neural systems encode information in the frequency of action potentials, which 
is then decoded by synaptic transmission. However, the rapid, synchronous 
release of neurotransmitters depletes synaptic vesicles (SVs), limiting release 
at high firing rates. How then do synapses convey information about frequency? 
Here, we show in mouse hippocampal neurons and slices that the adaptor protein 
AP-3 makes a subset of SVs that respond specifically to high-frequency 
stimulation. Neurotransmitter transporters slot onto these SVs in different 
proportions, contributing to the distinct properties of release observed at 
different excitatory synapses. Proteomics reveals that AP-3 targets the 
phospholipid flippase ATP8A1 to SVs; loss of ATP8A1 recapitulates the defect in 
SV mobilization at high frequency observed with loss of AP-3. The mechanism 
involves recruitment of synapsin by the cytoplasmically oriented 
phosphatidylserine translocated by ATP8A1. Thus, ATP8A1 enables the subset of 
SVs made by AP-3 to release at high frequency.
