In metazoa, the spatio-temporal translation of diverse mRNAs is essential to 
guarantee proper oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis. The eukaryotic 
translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which binds the 5' cap structure of 
eukaryotic mRNAs, associates with either stimulatory or inhibitory factors to 
modulate protein synthesis. In order to identify novel factors that might act at 
the translational level during Drosophila oogenesis, we have undertaken a 
functional proteomic approach and isolated the product of the Hsp83 gene, the 
evolutionarily conserved chaperone Hsp90, as a specific component of the 
cap-binding complex. Here we report that Hsp90 interacts in vitro with the 
translational repressor Cup. In addition, we show that Hsp83 and cup interact 
genetically, since lowering Hsp90 activity enhances the oogenesis alterations 
linked to diverse cup mutant alleles. Hsp90 and Cup co-localize in the cytoplasm 
of the developing germ-line cells within the germarium, thus suggesting a common 
function from the earliest stages of oogenesis. Taken together, our data start 
elucidating the role of Hsp90 during Drosophila female germ-line development and 
strengthen the idea that Cup has multiple essential functions during egg chamber 
development.
