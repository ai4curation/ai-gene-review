The genetic disease cystic fibrosis is caused by defects in the chloride channel 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR belongs to the 
family of ABC transporters. In contrast to most other members of this family 
which transport substrates actively across a membrane, the main function of CFTR 
is to regulate passive flux of substrates across the plasma membrane. Chloride 
channel activity of CFTR is dependent on protein phosphorylation and presence of 
nucleoside triphosphates. From electrophysiological studies of CFTR detailed 
models of its regulation by phosphorylation and nucleotide interaction have 
evolved. These investigations provide ample evidence that ATP hydrolysis is 
crucial for CFTR gating. It becomes apparent that the two nucleotide binding 
domains on CFTR not only diverge strongly in sequence, but also in function. 
Based on previous models and taking into account new data from pre-steady-state 
experiments, a refined model for the action of nucleotides at two nucleotide 
binding domains was recently proposed.
