Cold hardening treatment - a brief exposure to low temperatures - can protect 
certain insects against subsequent exposure to temperatures sufficiently low to 
cause damage or lethality. Microarray analysis to examine the changes in 
transcript abundance associated with cold hardening treatment (0 degrees C for 2 
h followed by 30 min recovery at 25 degrees C) was undertaken in Drosophila 
melanogaster in order to gain insight into this phenomenon. Transcripts 
associated with 36 genes were identified, a subset of which appeared to be also 
differentially expressed after heat shock treatment. Quantitative RT-PCR was 
used to independently determine transcript abundance of a subset of these 
sequences. Taken together, these assays suggest that stress proteins, including 
Hsp23, Hsp26, Hsp83 and Frost as well as membrane-associated proteins may 
contribute to the cold hardening response.
