Numerous studies focus on the tumor suppressor p53 as a protector of genomic 
stability, mediator of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and target of mutation 
in 50% of all human cancers. The vast majority of information on p53, its 
protein-interaction partners and regulation, comes from studies of 
tumor-derived, cultured cells where p53 and its regulatory controls may be 
mutated or dysfunctional. To address regulation of endogenous p53 in normal 
cells, we created a mouse and stem cell model by knock-in (KI) of a 
tandem-affinity-purification (TAP) epitope at the endogenous Trp-53 locus. Mass 
spectrometry of TAP-purified p53-complexes from embryonic stem cells revealed 
Tripartite-motif protein 24 (Trim24), a previously unknown partner of p53. 
Mutation of TRIM24 homolog, bonus, in Drosophila led to apoptosis, which could 
be rescued by p53-depletion. These in vivo analyses establish TRIM24/bonus as a 
pathway that negatively regulates p53 in Drosophila. The Trim24-p53 link is 
evolutionarily conserved, as TRIM24 depletion in human breast cancer cells 
caused p53-dependent, spontaneous apoptosis. We found that Trim24 ubiquitylates 
and negatively regulates p53 levels, suggesting Trim24 as a therapeutic target 
to restore tumor suppression by p53.

Abstract

Numerous studies focus on the tumor suppressor p53 as a protector of genomic stability, mediator of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and target of mutation in 50% of all human cancers. The vast majority of information on p53, its protein-interaction partners and regulation, comes from studies of tumor-derived, cultured cells where p53 and its regulatory controls may be mutated or dysfunctional. To address regulation of endogenous p53 in normal cells, we created a mouse and stem cell model by knock-in (KI) of a tandem-affinity-purification (TAP) epitope at the endogenous Trp-53 locus. Mass spectrometry of TAP-purified p53-complexes from embryonic stem cells revealed Tripartite-motif protein 24 (Trim24), a previously unknown partner of p53. Mutation of TRIM24 homolog, bonus , in Drosophila led to apoptosis, which could be rescued by p53-depletion. These in vivo analyses establish TRIM24/bonus as a pathway that negatively regulates p53 in Drosophila . The Trim24-p53 link is evolutionarily conserved, as TRIM24 depletion in human breast cancer cells caused p53-dependent, spontaneous apoptosis. We found that Trim24 ubiquitylates and negatively regulates p53 levels, suggesting Trim24 as a therapeutic target to restore tumor suppression by p53.
