Rot1 is an essential yeast protein originally shown to be implicated in such 
diverse processes such as β-1,6-glucan synthesis, actin cytoskeleton dynamics or 
lysis of autophagic bodies. More recently also a role as a molecular chaperone 
has been discovered. Here, we report that Rot1 interacts in a synthetic manner 
with Ost3, one of the nine subunits of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) 
complex, the key enzyme of N-glycosylation. The deletion of OST3 in the rot1-1 
mutant causes a temperature sensitive phenotype as well as sensitivity toward 
compounds interfering with cell wall biogenesis such as Calcofluor White, 
caffeine, Congo Red and hygromycin B, whereas the deletion of OST6, a functional 
homolog of OST3, has no effect. OST activity in vitro determined in membranes 
from rot1-1ost3Δ cells was found to be decreased to 45% compared with wild-type 
membranes, and model glycoproteins of N-glycosylation, like carboxypeptidase Y, 
Gas1 or dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B, displayed an underglycosylation pattern. By 
affinity chromatography, a physical interaction between Rot1 and Ost3 was 
demonstrated. Moreover, Rot1 was found to be involved also in the 
O-mannosylation process, as the glycosylation of distinct glycoproteins of this 
type were affected as well. Altogether, the data extend the role of Rot1 as a 
chaperone required to ensure proper glycosylation.
