An elaborate network of dynamic lipid membranes, termed tubular recycling 
endosomes (TRE), coordinates the process of endocytic recycling in mammalian 
cells. The C-terminal Eps15 homology domain (EHD)-containing proteins have been 
implicated in the bending and fission of TRE, thus regulating endocytic 
recycling. EHD proteins have an EH domain that interacts with proteins 
containing an NPF motif. We found that NPF-containing EHD1 interaction partners 
such as molecules interacting with CasL-like1 (MICAL-L1) and Syndapin2 are 
essential for TRE biogenesis. Also crucial for TRE biogenesis is the generation 
of phosphatidic acid, an essential lipid component of TRE that serves as a 
docking point for MICAL-L1 and Syndapin2. EHD1 and EHD3 have 86% amino acid 
identity; they homo- and heterodimerize and partially co-localize to TRE. 
Despite their remarkable identity, they have distinct mechanistic functions. 
EHD1 induces membrane vesiculation, whereas EHD3 supports TRE biogenesis and/or 
stabilization by an unknown mechanism. While using phospholipase D inhibitors 
(which block the conversion of glycerophospholipids to phosphatidic acid) to 
deplete cellular TRE, we observed that, upon inhibitor washout, there was a 
rapid and dramatic regeneration of MICAL-L1-marked TRE. Using this 
"synchronized" TRE biogenesis system, we determined that EHD3 is involved in the 
stabilization of TRE rather than in their biogenesis. Moreover, we identify the 
residues Ala-519/Asp-520 of EHD1 and Asn-519/Glu-520 of EHD3 as defining the 
selectivity of these two paralogs for NPF-containing binding partners, and we 
present a model to explain the atomic mechanism and provide new insight for 
their differential roles in vesiculation and tubulation, respectively.
