The present work examines whether insulin and NO can act as regulators of 
glucose transport in placenta. Glucose uptake (2-deoxy D-[(3)H]glucose) was 
measured in the absence (control or basal values) and in the presence of insulin 
(1200 microU/ml) or SNP (20 microM) in isolated perfused cotyledons and tissue 
slices preparations of human placenta. Both insulin and NO significantly 
increased glucose uptake by 20 and 27 per cent, respectively. Insulin decreased 
the Km of glucose transport from 42.5 +/- 2.69 to 35.1 +/- 2.58 mM. The 
stimulatory effect of SNP was mimicked by 8-CPT-cGMP and was completely blocked 
by the guanylate cyclase inhibitor, ODQ (10 microM). ODQ and the NOS inhibitor, 
L-NAME (100 microM), decreased basal glucose uptake but did not affect 
insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Taken together, these findings indicate 
that insulin and NO stimulate glucose uptake in human placenta and suggest that 
both potential regulators of glucose transport use different signaling pathways.
