The type I lissencephaly gene product LIS1, a key regulator of cytoplasmic 
dynein, is critical for cell proliferation, survival, and neuronal migration. 
However, little is known about the regulation of LIS1. Here, we identify a 
previously uncharacterized mammalian homolog of Aspergillus NudC, NudCL2 
(NudC-like protein 2), as a regulator of LIS1. NudCL2 is localized to the 
centrosome in interphase, and spindle poles and kinetochores during mitosis, a 
pattern similar to the localization of LIS1 and cytoplasmic dynein. Depletion of 
NudCL2 destabilized LIS1 and led to phenotypes resembling those of either dynein 
or LIS1 deficiency. NudCL2 complexed with and enhanced the interaction between 
LIS1 and Hsp90. Either disruption of the LIS1-Hsp90 interaction with the C 
terminus of NudCL2 or inhibition of Hsp90 chaperone function by geldanamycin 
decreased LIS1 stability. Thus, our results suggest that NudCL2 regulates the 
LIS1/dynein pathway by stabilizing LIS1 with Hsp90 chaperone. This represents a 
hitherto undescribed mechanism of the LIS1/dynein regulation in mammalian cells.

Abstract

The type I lissencephaly gene product LIS1, a key regulator of cytoplasmic dynein, is critical for cell proliferation, survival, and neuronal migration. However, little is known about the regulation of LIS1. Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized mammalian homolog of Aspergillus NudC, NudCL2 (NudC-like protein 2), as a regulator of LIS1. NudCL2 is localized to the centrosome in interphase, and spindle poles and kinetochores during mitosis, a pattern similar to the localization of LIS1 and cytoplasmic dynein. Depletion of NudCL2 destabilized LIS1 and led to phenotypes resembling those of either dynein or LIS1 deficiency. NudCL2 complexed with and enhanced the interaction between LIS1 and Hsp90. Either disruption of the LIS1-Hsp90 interaction with the C terminus of NudCL2 or inhibition of Hsp90 chaperone function by geldanamycin decreased LIS1 stability. Thus, our results suggest that NudCL2 regulates the LIS1/dynein pathway by stabilizing LIS1 with Hsp90 chaperone. This represents a hitherto undescribed mechanism of the LIS1/dynein regulation in mammalian cells.

Discussion

In this study, we have identified NudCL2 as a regulator of LIS1 and found that NudCL2 forms a complex with LIS1 and Hsp90. NudCL2 modulates the LIS1/dynein pathway by stabilizing LIS1 with Hsp90 chaperone, which represents a previously uncharacterized mechanism of LIS1 regulation.
