Several bioactive peptides are encrypted within the sequence of major milk 
proteins, requiring enzymatic proteolysis for release and activation. The 
present study aimed at the identification of potential anti-inflammatory 
activities in tryptic hydrolysates of bovine β-casein. Inflammatory processes 
involve in most cases an activation of Nuclear factor Kappa-light-chain enhancer 
of activated B cells (NFκB), which is a pro-inflammatory transcription factor of 
several genes. Hence, a NFκB reporter cell line was established, and TNF-α 
mediated activation of NFκB was used as a measurement. Bovine β-casein (β-CN) 
was hydrolysed by trypsin and fractionated by ultrafiltration. Total 
proteolysate as well as the fraction containing peptides between 1 and 5 kDa 
showed an inhibitory effect in the cell-based assay, while the fraction 
containing molecules smaller than 1 kDa did not. This anti-inflammatory effect 
was ascribed to a group of large, hydrophobic peptides, which were identified 
using LC-MS. The main peptide was synthesised and showed a significant 
anti-inflammatory effect in HEK(nfkb-RE)-cells. Thus, for the first time, a 
casein-derived peptide having an anti-inflammatory effect in vitro has been 
identified.
