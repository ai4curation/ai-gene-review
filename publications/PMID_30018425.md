Cell cycle progression in mammals is modulated by two ubiquitin ligase 
complexes, CRL4 and SCF, which facilitate degradation of chromatin substrates 
involved in the regulation of DNA replication. One member of the CRL4 complex, 
the WD-40 containing protein RepID (DCAF14/PHIP), selectively binds and 
activates a group of replication origins. Here we show that RepID recruits the 
CRL4 complex to chromatin prior to DNA synthesis, thus playing a crucial 
architectural role in the proper licensing of chromosomes for replication. In 
the absence of RepID, cells rely on the alternative ubiquitin ligase, 
SKP2-containing SCF, to progress through the cell cycle. RepID depletion 
markedly increases cellular sensitivity to SKP2 inhibitors, which triggered 
massive genome re-replication. Both RepID and SKP2 interact with distinct, 
non-overlapping groups of replication origins, suggesting that selective 
interactions of replication origins with specific CRL components execute the DNA 
replication program and maintain genomic stability by preventing re-initiation 
of DNA replication.
