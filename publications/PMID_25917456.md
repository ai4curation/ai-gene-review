Haploinsufficiency of the Gata3 gene, which encodes a zinc-finger transcription 
factor, is associated with the disorder hypoparathyroidism, deafness, and renal 
dysplasia (HDR) syndrome in humans. However, the roles of Gata3 in 
transcriptional regulation in the parathyroid glands are not well-understood. In 
this study, we show that Gata3 activates transcription of parathyroid hormone 
(PTH), which is secreted from parathyroid glands and is critical for regulating 
serum calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Gata3 interacted with Gcm2 and MafB, 
two known transcriptional regulators of parathyroid development, and 
synergistically stimulated the PTH promoter. An SP1-binding element (GC box) 
located within the PTH-promoter proximal region was critical for activating 
transcription by Gata3. In addition, the ubiquitous transcription factor SP1 
also interacted with Gata3 as well as MafB and Gcm2, and HDR syndrome-associated 
Gata3 mutants were defective in activating the PTH promoter. These results 
suggest that Gata3 is a critical regulator of PTH gene expression.
