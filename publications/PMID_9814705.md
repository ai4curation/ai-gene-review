Kinase suppressor of ras (ksr) is required for efficient signal transmission 
within the RAS/MAPK cascade. A screen for mutations that modify a ksr-dependent 
phenotype identified a novel gene, connector enhancer of ksr (cnk), that 
functions upstream or in parallel to RAF in the RAS pathway. cnk encodes a 
protein containing several protein-protein interaction domains, suggesting that 
it brings different signaling molecules together. CNK is required in multiple 
receptor tyrosine kinase pathways where it appears to be a tyrosine 
phosphorylation target. Finally, CNK physically interacts with RAF and appears 
to localize to cell-cell contact regions. Together, these findings suggest that 
CNK is a novel component of a RAS-dependent signaling pathway that regulates RAF 
function and/or targets RAF to a specific subcellular compartment upon RAS 
activation.
