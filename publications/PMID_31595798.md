Objective: To investigate changes in retinal capillary density (RCD) that occur 
in Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) and explore their association with the clinical 
manifestations for GO.Material and Methods: A total of 125 participants (93 GO 
patients and 32 normal subjects) were enrolled. All participants underwent 
ophthalmology and endocrinology examinations. Retinal microvasculature was 
imaged by spectral domain optical coherence tomographic angiography (OCT-A). The 
RCDs in the superficial and deep retinal capillary plexuses (SRCP and DRCP) were 
quantified by the custom software from the OCT-A images, which were divided into 
total annular zones (TAZ) and four quadrants. Multiple linear regression 
analysis was used to explore the associations between RCD and the relevant 
factors.Results: Significant reduction was seen in the TAZ zone in SRCP and DRCP 
of GO group (P < .05) when compared to the healthy subjects; significant 
differences remained after adjustment of vascular relevant factors. According to 
the univariate analysis, the relevant factors of higher IOP, larger proptosis, 
higher clinical activity scoring (CAS), thyroid stimulating hormone-receptor 
autoantibodies (TRAb), and 131I therapy were significantly associated with 
decreased RCDs in GO patients (P < .05). Multivariate linear regression analysis 
showed that CAS and TRAb were the most important relevant factors for decreased 
RCDs.Conclusions: The RCD of GO patients was significantly decreased compared to 
the healthy controls. The activity status and serum antibodies associated with 
GO were the relevant factors for reduced RCD.
