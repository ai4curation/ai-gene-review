CD146, an endothelial biomarker, has been shown to be aberrantly upregulated 
during pathological angiogenesis and functions as a coreceptor for vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) to promote disease progression. 
However, the regulatory mechanisms of CD146 expression during angiogenesis 
remain unclear. Using a microRNA screening approach, we identified a novel 
negative regulator of angiogenesis, microRNA 329 (miR-329), that directly 
targeted CD146 and inhibited CD146-mediated angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. 
Endogenous miR-329 expression was downregulated by VEGF and tumor necrosis 
factor alpha (TNF-α), resulting in the elevation of CD146 in endothelial cells. 
Upregulation of CD146 facilitated an endothelial response to VEGF-induced SRC 
kinase family (SKF)/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/NF-κB activation 
and consequently promoted endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Our 
animal experiments showed that treatment with miR-329 repressed excessive CD146 
expression on blood vessels and significantly attenuated neovascularization in a 
mouse model of pathological angiogenesis. Our findings provide the first 
evidence that CD146 expression in angiogenesis is regulated by miR-329 and 
suggest that miR-329 could present a potential therapeutic tool for the 
treatment of angiogenic diseases.
