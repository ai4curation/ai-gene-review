Silencing within the yeast ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats protects the integrity 
of this highly repetitive array by inhibiting hyperrecombination and repressing 
transcription from foreign promoters. Using affinity purification combined with 
highly sensitive mixture mass spectrometry, we have analyzed the protein 
interaction network involved in suppressing homologous recombination within the 
rDNA locus. We show that the Net1 and Sir2 subunits of the RENT (regulator of 
nucleolar silencing and telophase exit) silencing complex, and Fob1, which 
recruits RENT to the nontranscribed spacer I (NTS1) region of rDNA, are 
physically associated with Tof2. In addition to RENT components and Fob1, Tof2 
copurified with a two-subunit complex composed of Lrs4 and Csm1. Tof2, Lrs4, and 
Csm1 are recruited to the NTS1 region by Fob1 and are specifically required for 
silencing at this rDNA region. Moreover, Lrs4 and Csm1 act synergistically with 
Sir2 to suppress unequal crossover at the rDNA and are released from the 
nucleolus during anaphase. Together with previous observations showing that Csm1 
physically associates with cohesin, these findings suggest a possible model in 
which RENT, Tof2, and Lrs4/Csm1 physically clamp rDNA to the cohesin ring, 
thereby restricting the movement of rDNA sister chromatids relative to each 
other to inhibit unequal exchange.
