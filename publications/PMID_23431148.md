Glaucoma, a major cause of blindness worldwide, is a neurodegenerative optic 
neuropathy in which vision loss is caused by loss of retinal ganglion cells 
(RGCs). To better define the pathways mediating RGC death and identify targets 
for the development of neuroprotective drugs, we developed a high-throughput RNA 
interference screen with primary RGCs and used it to screen the full mouse 
kinome. The screen identified dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) as a key 
neuroprotective target in RGCs. In cultured RGCs, DLK signaling is both 
necessary and sufficient for cell death. DLK undergoes robust 
posttranscriptional up-regulation in response to axonal injury in vitro and in 
vivo. Using a conditional knockout approach, we confirmed that DLK is required 
for RGC JNK activation and cell death in a rodent model of optic neuropathy. In 
addition, tozasertib, a small molecule protein kinase inhibitor with activity 
against DLK, protects RGCs from cell death in rodent glaucoma and traumatic 
optic neuropathy models. Together, our results establish a previously 
undescribed drug/drug target combination in glaucoma, identify an early marker 
of RGC injury, and provide a starting point for the development of more specific 
neuroprotective DLK inhibitors for the treatment of glaucoma, nonglaucomatous 
forms of optic neuropathy, and perhaps other CNS neurodegenerations.

Abstract

Glaucoma, a major cause of blindness worldwide, is a neurodegenerative optic neuropathy in which vision loss is caused by loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). To better define the pathways mediating RGC death and identify targets for the development of neuroprotective drugs, we developed a high-throughput RNA interference screen with primary RGCs and used it to screen the full mouse kinome. The screen identified dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) as a key neuroprotective target in RGCs. In cultured RGCs, DLK signaling is both necessary and sufficient for cell death. DLK undergoes robust posttranscriptional up-regulation in response to axonal injury in vitro and in vivo. Using a conditional knockout approach, we confirmed that DLK is required for RGC JNK activation and cell death in a rodent model of optic neuropathy. In addition, tozasertib, a small molecule protein kinase inhibitor with activity against DLK, protects RGCs from cell death in rodent glaucoma and traumatic optic neuropathy models. Together, our results establish a previously undescribed drug/drug target combination in glaucoma, identify an early marker of RGC injury, and provide a starting point for the development of more specific neuroprotective DLK inhibitors for the treatment of glaucoma, nonglaucomatous forms of optic neuropathy, and perhaps other CNS neurodegenerations.

Discussion

Large-scale RNAi-based phenotypic screens in lower organisms have successfully identified genes involved in the rescue of neuronal degenerations ( 46 – 48 ). Parallel screens using primary vertebrate neurons, however, have been more difficult because of the challenges in working with and transfecting primary neuronal cell cultures. Using a magnetic nanoparticle-based method that is easily compatible with automation, we have overcome these challenges and performed a kinome-wide survival screen using a disease-relevant primary neuron. This global and unbiased approach led to the identification of DLK signaling as a key cell death pathway in RGC degeneration. Moreover, it establishes the proof of principle for a whole-genome scan in primary RGCs to identify additional potential neuroprotective pathways and drug targets.

Several previous studies have implicated the JNK pathway in both traumatic and glaucomatous models of optic neuropathy ( 9 – 12 ). However, the mechanism by which axonal injury leads to JNK activation in RGC cell bodies has been unclear. Our results, as well as those by Watkins et al. ( 49 ), suggest that DLK may be the as-yet-unidentified trigger for JNK activation and cell death in injured RGCs. Such a role for DLK integrates well with accumulating data about the involvement of DLK in axonal injury and neuronal apoptosis. DLK has been shown to mediate developmental apoptosis in peripheral motor and sensory neurons ( 17 , 18 ). In adult peripheral neurons, it has been implicated as an important mediator of distal axonal degeneration ( 22 ) and proximal axonal regeneration ( 16 , 19 , 20 ) after axonal injury. It is required for the retrograde transmission of injury mediators such as the JNK scaffold protein JNK interacting protein 3 (JIP3) and phosphorylated STAT3 and plays a role in the induction of expression of proregenerative genes ( 21 ).

The work by Watkins et al. suggests that DLK is also involved in the regeneration of optic nerve axons after optic nerve crush ( 49 ). It remains to be determined whether DLK is involved in glaucoma-related axonal degeneration. If axonal degeneration persists even in the setting of DLK inhibition-mediated soma preservation, then associated inhibition of axonal regeneration might a priori seem like an undesirable adverse effect. However, as there is little evidence that regeneration occurs as part of the natural history of glaucoma, such a strategy is unlikely to be harmful At the very least, preservation of RGC cell bodies would provide an important component of a comprehensive neuroprotective therapy. Furthermore, definition of what determines whether activation of DLK signaling leads to primarily axonal regeneration and/or neuronal cell death may make possible the separation of these signals and the development of treatment strategies that could inhibit cell death without interfering with regeneration.

An advantage of promoting RGC survival through DLK-mediated inhibition of JNK signaling, rather than directly inhibiting JNK, is that JNK signaling has a number of important physiologic roles, such as tumor suppression ( 50 ). Because multiple independent pathways feed into JNK activation ( 51 ), the finding that the DLK branch is the major pathway leading to proapoptotic JNK activation after RGC injury makes possible a more fine-tuned and specific approach. Our demonstration that tozasertib is neuroprotective in both glaucoma and traumatic optic neuropathy models can be seen as a proof of principle indicating that such a strategy can succeed. It also supports the possibility that pharmacologic inhibition of DLK could provide a therapeutic approach for other forms of CNS neurodegeneration.
