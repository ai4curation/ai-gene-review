The periplasmic hydrogenase of Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Hildenbourough) is an all 
Fe-containing hydrogenase. It contains two ferredoxin type [4Fe-4S] clusters, 
termed the F clusters, and a catalytic H cluster. Recent X-ray crystallographic 
studies on two Fe hydrogenases revealed that the H cluster is composed of two 
sub-clusters, a [4Fe-4S] cluster ([4Fe-4S](H)) and a binuclear Fe cluster 
([2Fe](H)), bridged by a cysteine sulfur. The aerobically purified D. vulgaris 
hydrogenase is stable in air. It is inactive and requires reductive activation. 
Upon reduction, the enzyme becomes sensitive to O(2), indicating that the 
reductive activation process is irreversible. Previous EPR investigations showed 
that upon reoxidation (under argon) the H cluster exhibits a rhombic EPR signal 
that is not seen in the as-purified enzyme, suggesting a conformational change 
in association with the reductive activation. For the purpose of gaining more 
information on the electronic properties of this unique H cluster and to 
understand further the reductive activation process, variable-temperature and 
variable-field Mössbauer spectroscopy has been used to characterize the Fe-S 
clusters in D. vulgaris hydrogenase poised at different redox states generated 
during a reductive titration, and in the CO-reacted enzyme. The data were 
successfully decomposed into spectral components corresponding to the F and H 
clusters, and characteristic parameters describing the electronic and magnetic 
properties of the F and H clusters were obtained. Consistent with the X-ray 
crystallographic results, the spectra of the H cluster can be understood as 
originating from an exchange coupled [4Fe-4S]-[2Fe] system. In particular, 
detailed analysis of the data reveals that the reductive activation begins with 
reduction of the [4Fe-4S](H) cluster from the 2+ to the 1+ state, followed by 
transfer of the reducing equivalent from the [4Fe-4S](H) subcluster to the 
binuclear [2Fe](H) subcluster. The results also reveal that binding of exogenous 
CO to the H cluster affects significantly the exchange coupling between the 
[4Fe-4S](H) and the [2Fe](H) subclusters. Implication of such a CO binding 
effect is discussed.
