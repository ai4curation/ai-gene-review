directs D1-induced cAMP production to adenylyl cyclase 7 through mobilizing 
G(βγ) subunits in human embryonic kidney 293T cells.

The mechanism underlying the crosstalk between multiple G protein-coupled 
receptors remains poorly understood. We previously reported that prostaglandin E 
receptor EP1 facilitates dopamine D1 receptor signaling in striatal slices and 
promotes behavioral responses induced by D1 receptor agonists. Here, using human 
embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells expressing D1 and EP1, we have analyzed the 
mechanism underlying EP1-mediated facilitation of D1 receptor signaling. 
Fluorescent immunostaining showed that EP1 and D1 receptors are partly 
colocalized in the cells, and coprecipitation experiments revealed a molecular 
complex of EP1 and D1 receptors. Treatment of the cells with 
17S,17,20-dimethyl-2,5-ethano-6-oxo-PGE₁ (ONO-DI-004), an EP1-selective agonist, 
enhanced cAMP production induced by D1 agonists 
(±)-6-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine hydrobromide 
(SKF-81297) and 
6-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-(3-methylphenyl)-3-(2-propenyl)-1H-3-benzazepine-7,8-diol 
hydrobromide (SKF-83822). Although this facilitative effect of EP1 stimulation 
was not affected by pharmacologic blockade of EP1-induced Ca²⁺ increase, it was 
blocked by overexpression of G(tα) as a G(βγ) scavenger. Consistently, depletion 
of adenylyl cyclase (AC) 7, a G(βγ)-sensitive AC isoform, abolished the 
facilitative action of EP1 on D1-induced cAMP production. Notably, neither G(tα) 
overexpression nor AC7 depletion affected cAMP production induced by D1 
stimulation alone. In contrast, depletion of AC6, another AC isoform, reduced 
cAMP production induced by D1 stimulation alone, but spared its facilitation by 
EP1 stimulation. Collectively, these data suggest that, through complex 
formation with D1, EP1 signaling directs the D1 receptor through G(βγ) to be 
coupled to AC7, an AC isoform distinct from those used by the D1 receptor alone, 
in HEK-293T cells.
