A novel immunoglobulin-type protein expressed in blood vessels has been 
identified. The cDNA for AAMP (angio-associated, migratory cell protein) was 
first isolated from a human melanoma cell line during a search for 
motility-associated cell surface proteins. Upon analysis of the tissue 
distribution of AAMP, it was found to be expressed strongly in endothelial 
cells, cytotrophoblasts, and poorly differentiated colon adenocarcinoma cells 
found in lymphatics. The sequence of AAMP predicts a protein (M(r) 49,000) with 
distant identity (25%) to known proteins. It contains immunoglobulin-like 
domains [one with multiple homologies to deleted in colon carcinoma (DCC) 
protein], the WD40 repeat motif, and a heparin-binding consensus sequence. A 
1.6-kilobase mRNA transcript of AAMP is detected in tissue culture cell lines 
and tissues. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies, anti-recombinant AAMP, and 
anti-peptide 189 (AAMP derived) recognize a M(r) 52,000 protein in human tissue 
and cellular extracts. The protein size is in keeping with the mRNA and 
predicted sequence. The AAMP-derived peptide, P189, contains a heparin-binding 
domain (dissociation constant, 14 pmol) and mediates heparin-sensitive cell 
adhesion. The shared expression of AAMP in endothelial cells, trophoblasts, and 
tumor cells implies a common function in migrating cells.
