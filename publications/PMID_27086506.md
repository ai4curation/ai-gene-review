Recent advances in mass-spectrometry-based proteomics are now facilitating 
ambitious large-scale investigations of the spatial and temporal dynamics of the 
proteome; however, the increasing size and complexity of these data sets is 
overwhelming current downstream computational methods, specifically those that 
support the postquantification analysis pipeline. Here we present HiQuant, a 
novel application that enables the design and execution of a postquantification 
workflow, including common data-processing steps, such as assay normalization 
and grouping, and experimental replicate quality control and statistical 
analysis. HiQuant also enables the interpretation of results generated from 
large-scale data sets by supporting interactive heatmap analysis and also the 
direct export to Cytoscape and Gephi, two leading network analysis platforms. 
HiQuant may be run via a user-friendly graphical interface and also supports 
complete one-touch automation via a command-line mode. We evaluate HiQuant's 
performance by analyzing a large-scale, complex interactome mapping data set and 
demonstrate a 200-fold improvement in the execution time over current methods. 
We also demonstrate HiQuant's general utility by analyzing proteome-wide 
quantification data generated from both a large-scale public tyrosine kinase 
siRNA knock-down study and an in-house investigation into the temporal dynamics 
of the KSR1 and KSR2 interactomes. Download HiQuant, sample data sets, and
