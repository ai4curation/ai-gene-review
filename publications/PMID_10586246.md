The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene product, neurofibromin, regulates 
activation of the Ras intracellular signaling pathway in Schwann cells. Schwann 
cells purified from mouse embryos with null mutations in the Nf1 gene increase 
expression of the major myelin glycoprotein P0. v-Ras expression in cultured 
Schwann cells partially mimics loss of Nf1, suggesting a role for Ras in 
upregulation of P0 expression in Nf1-deficient cells. We tested whether loss of 
Nf1 alters the ability of Schwann cells to form myelin. No significant changes 
in myelin formation resulted when Nf1-deficient or v-Ras-expressing Schwann 
cells were cultured with normal neurons. Yet, in organotypic cultures of 
neurons, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts without neurofibromin, myelination was 
dramatically reduced. We suggest that Nf1-dependent signaling cascades in 
neurons and/or fibroblasts, as well as Schwann cells, are required for normal 
myelination.
