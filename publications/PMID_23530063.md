Mitochondria are the main engine that generates ATP through oxidative 
phosphorylation within the respiratory chain. Mitochondrial respiration is 
regulated according to the metabolic needs of cells and can be modulated in 
response to metabolic changes. Little is known about the mechanisms that 
regulate this process. Here, we identify MCJ/DnaJC15 as a distinct cochaperone 
that localizes at the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it interacts 
preferentially with complex I of the electron transfer chain. We show that MCJ 
impairs the formation of supercomplexes and functions as a negative regulator of 
the respiratory chain. The loss of MCJ leads to increased complex I activity, 
mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP production. Although MCJ is 
dispensable for mitochondrial function under normal physiological conditions, 
MCJ deficiency affects the pathophysiology resulting from metabolic alterations. 
Thus, enhanced mitochondrial respiration in the absence of MCJ prevents the 
pathological accumulation of lipids in the liver in response to both fasting and 
a high-cholesterol diet. Impaired expression or loss of MCJ expression may 
therefore result in a "rapid" metabolism that mitigates the consequences of 
metabolic disorders.
