We recently reported the positional cloning of a candidate gene for hereditary 
hemochromatosis called HFE. The gene product, a member of the major 
histocompatibility complex class I-like family, was found to have a mutation, 
Cys-282 --> Tyr (C282Y), in 85% of patient chromosomes. This mutation eliminates 
the ability of HFE to associate with beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) and prevents 
cell-surface expression. A second mutation that has no effect on beta2m 
association, H63D, was found in eight out of nine patients heterozygous for the 
C282Y mutant. In this report, we demonstrate in cultured 293 cells 
overexpressing wild-type or mutant HFE proteins that both the wild-type and H63D 
HFE proteins form stable complexes with the transferrin receptor (TfR). The 
C282Y mutation nearly completely prevents the association of the mutant HFE 
protein with the TfR. Studies on cell-associated transferrin at 37 degrees C 
suggest that the overexpressed wild-type HFE protein decreases the affinity of 
the TfR for transferrin. The overexpressed H63D protein does not have this 
effect, providing the first direct evidence for a functional consequence of the 
H63D mutation. Addition of soluble wild-type HFE/beta2m heterodimers to cultured 
cells also decreased the apparent affinity of the TfR for its ligand under 
steady-state conditions, both in 293 cells and in HeLa cells. Furthermore, at 4 
degrees C, the added soluble complex of HFE/beta2m inhibited binding of 
transferrin to HeLa cell TfR in a concentration-dependent manner. Scatchard 
plots of these data indicate that the added heterodimer substantially reduced 
the affinity of TfR for transferrin. These results establish a molecular link 
between HFE and a key protein involved in iron transport, the TfR, and raise the 
possibility that alterations in this regulatory mechanism may play a role in the 
pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis.

Abstract

We recently reported the positional cloning of a candidate gene for hereditary hemochromatosis called HFE . The gene product, a member of the major histocompatibility complex class I-like family, was found to have a mutation, Cys-282 → Tyr (C282Y), in 85% of patient chromosomes. This mutation eliminates the ability of HFE to associate with β 2 -microglobulin (β 2 m) and prevents cell-surface expression. A second mutation that has no effect on β 2 m association, H63D, was found in eight out of nine patients heterozygous for the C282Y mutant. In this report, we demonstrate in cultured 293 cells overexpressing wild-type or mutant HFE proteins that both the wild-type and H63D HFE proteins form stable complexes with the transferrin receptor (TfR). The C282Y mutation nearly completely prevents the association of the mutant HFE protein with the TfR. Studies on cell-associated transferrin at 37°C suggest that the overexpressed wild-type HFE protein decreases the affinity of the TfR for transferrin. The overexpressed H63D protein does not have this effect, providing the first direct evidence for a functional consequence of the H63D mutation. Addition of soluble wild-type HFE/β 2 m heterodimers to cultured cells also decreased the apparent affinity of the TfR for its ligand under steady-state conditions, both in 293 cells and in HeLa cells. Furthermore, at 4°C, the added soluble complex of HFE/β 2 m inhibited binding of transferrin to HeLa cell TfR in a concentration-dependent manner. Scatchard plots of these data indicate that the added heterodimer substantially reduced the affinity of TfR for transferrin. These results establish a molecular link between HFE and a key protein involved in iron transport, the TfR, and raise the possibility that alterations in this regulatory mechanism may play a role in the pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We initially utilized cell-surface labeling to detect potential HFE interacting proteins. Human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells), engineered to overexpress either wild-type or mutant forms of HFE, were treated with biotin-conjugated N -hydroxysuccinimide to label proteins expressed on the cell-surface. Subsequently, total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with previously characterized antibodies directed toward the C-terminal peptide sequence of HFE or monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG epitope tag that had been engineered into the HFE protein ( 10 ). Biotinylated proteins were detected with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase. Lysates from parental 293 cells displayed little surface-labeling in accordance with previous results demonstrating undetectable levels of HFE protein in these cells (Fig. 1 A and B ) ( 10 ). In contrast, prominent bands at 49 and 100 kDa and the less intense bands at 12 and 200 kDa, were observed in immunoprecipitates from lysates of cells overexpressing the wild-type HFE; these bands were absent in immunoprecipitates from cells overexpressing the C282Y mutant form of HFE (Fig. 1 A and B ). In previous studies it was demonstrated that the plasma membrane-bound form of HFE was 49 kDa in molecular mass and associated with β 2 m, a 12-kDa protein ( 10 , 11 ). The presence of 49- and 12-kDa-labeled bands in HFE-specific immune-complexes from wild-type HFE expressing cells and their virtual absence in parental and C282Y mutant expressing cells is consistent with their identity as HFE and β 2 m. The fact that only trace amounts of the 100- and 200-kDa proteins coimmunoprecipitated from lysates of the C282Y mutant expressing cells suggests a specific interaction of these proteins with the cell-surface form of HFE.

To further examine the specificity of the above protein interactions with HFE, we performed immunoprecipitations with antibodies that recognize the related HLA-A, B and C proteins. These antibodies detected proteins at ≈45 kDa and 12 kDa, the predicted molecular masses of the HLA heavy chain and β 2 m, but failed to coimmunoprecipitate the 100- and 200-kDa bands (Fig. 1 D ).

To identify the 100- and 200-kDa proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with HFE, we investigated proteins known to participate in iron homeostasis. Interestingly, the major carrier of transferrin-bound iron, the TfR is known to display a characteristic pattern of monomers and dimers migrating at ≈100 and 200 kDa in denaturing gel electrophoresis ( 13 – 15 ). To determine whether HFE could associate with the TfR, we utilized TfR antibodies to immunoprecipitate surface-labeled proteins from the three cell lines. A prominent protein of molecular mass corresponding to the monomeric TfR and a smaller amount of one corresponding to the dimeric form of the TfR were seen in the parental 293 as well as the wild-type HFE overexpressing cells. The C282Y mutant protein expressing cell line had less of both, (Fig. 1 C ). [However, studies of cell-associated transferrin suggest that these cells had equivalent numbers of receptors (see Fig. 3 , compare A and B )]. Two proteins with masses corresponding to those of HFE and β 2 m (49 kDa and 12 kDa, respectively) were observed in immunoprecipitates from the cells that overexpress wild-type HFE protein. By contrast, little or no HFE protein was seen in immunoprecipitates from parental 293 or C282Y mutant protein expressing cells.

The HFE/TfR association results were corroborated by performing coimmunoprecipitation experiments on unlabeled total cell lysates. Immunoprecipitation with HFE antibodies followed by blotting and probing with antibodies to TfR demonstrated that the TfR was complexed with the wild-type form of HFE. In contrast, very little TfR was observed in the immunoprecipitates from the C282Y mutant cells (Fig. 2 A ). Reprobing blots with the FLAG epitope antibodies to detect HFE demonstrated that equivalent amounts of HFE were being expressed and immunoprecipitated from each of the cell lines except the parental 293 cells, as expected (Fig. 2 B ). Performing the inverse experiment, wherein cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with TfR antibodies followed by blotting with HFE antibodies, revealed that HFE coimmunoprecipitated with the TfR from wild-type HFE expressing cells; only a trace band was observed with C282Y and none with the parental 293 cell line (Fig. 2 C ). The absence of HFE in immunoprecipitates with TfR in parental 293 and near absence in the C282Y mutant cell lines was not due to failure to precipitate TfR; reprobing the blot with TfR antibodies demonstrated that TfR protein was precipitated from each of the cell lines, including C282Y (Fig. 2 D ). To further control for the specificity of the HFE antibodies, we first immunoprecipitated cell lysates with FLAG epitope antibodies to specifically precipitate the HFE/FLAG fusion proteins followed by blotting with TfR antibodies. As was observed in Fig. 2 A, the TfR was coimmunoprecipitated from cells expressing the FLAG-tagged wild-type HFE protein, but not from cells expressing the FLAG-tagged C282Y mutant HFE protein (Fig. 2 E ). Experiments performed on an independent series of cell lines engineered to express wild-type and mutant HFE that lacked the FLAG epitope tag yielded identical results to those shown in Fig. 2 when immunoprecipitations were carried out with HFE and TfR antibodies (data not shown).

In immunoprecipitation experiments on unlabeled cell lysates we included as a further control another mutant of HFE wherein His-63 was replaced by aspartate (H63D). As with wild-type HFE, the H63D protein is also expressed on the cell surface and associates with β 2 m ( 10 , 11 ). The association of HFE with the TfR as assessed by coimmunoprecipitation appeared unaffected by the H63D mutation (Fig. 2 A, C, and E ).

To assess the biological effect of the HFE/TfR interaction, we characterized the transferrin-binding properties of the TfR in the presence or absence of HFE. For these studies we examined the amount of [ 125 I]-transferrin (diferric form) associated with intact 293 cells engineered to overexpress both β 2 m and either wild-type HFE or one of two HFE mutant forms, C282Y or H63D. The initial binding experiments were performed at 37°C under which conditions the total cell-associated [ 125 I]-transferrin represents both surface-bound and internalized ligand at steady-state ( 20 , 21 ). The cell-association of [ 125 I]-transferrin saturated at 150–250 nM on both C282Y mutant and wild-type HFE expressing cells (Fig. 3 A and B insets, which present data from two separate cell clones for each the wild-type and mutant HFE). When subjected to Scatchard analysis, the C282Y HFE mutant expressing clones showed a K cell association for transferrin of ≈12 and 14 nM (Fig. 3 A ). A similar K cell association for transferrin was found in parental 293 cells (19 nM) (data not shown). By contrast, the K cell association for transferrin in the wild-type HFE expressing clones, appeared to be increased 3- and 15-fold to K cell association values of 40 and 180 nM, respectively.

In contrast to the effect of wild-type HFE on K cell association for transferrin, the H63D mutation, while retaining the ability to interact with the TfR (Figs. 1 and 2 ), did not appear to increase the K cell association for transferrin. Two clonal lines expressing the H63D mutant protein had apparent K cell association for transferrin of ≈12 and 20 nM (Fig. 3 C ). These values are nearly identical to those obtained with the cell lines expressing the C282Y mutant in which the HFE protein was absent from the cell surface ( K cell association = 12 and 14 nM). The total amount of cell-associated transferrin in cell lines expressing the H63D mutant (1. 8 × 10 −10 M) was 2 to 3-fold lower when compared with the C282Y expressing cells (4–6 × 10 −10 M) (Fig. 3 A and C ). This may reflect clonal variation or may reflect an altered TfR trafficking. Regardless, these data suggest that one functional consequence of the H63D mutation appears to be the loss of the ability of the HFE protein to increase the K cell association for transferrin. In lacking this property of the wild-type HFE protein, HFE with the H63D mutation functionally resembles the C282Y mutation.

As an alternative method to assess the effect of HFE on the K cell association for transferrin, we added a soluble form of HFE/β 2 m heterodimers to the culture medium of parental 293 cells. The addition of the HFE/β 2 m heterodimers at 37°C reduced cell-associated transferrin in a concentration-dependent manner with maximal inhibition at 2 μM heterodimer (Fig. 3 D ). The apparent K i for inhibition was 87 nM. Similarly, in the presence of 2 μM soluble HFE/β 2 m heterodimers the K cell association for transferrin was increased 5-fold to 100 nM (data not shown). Control experiments using an identical amount of an MHC class I, H-2K d ( 22 ) protein complexed with human β 2 m failed to have any effect on the cell-associated transferrin to 293 cells (data not shown).

To corroborate the inhibitory effects observed with soluble HFE/β 2 m heterodimers on 293 cells we performed similar studies on HeLa cells. Scatchard analysis of the cell-associated transferrin data obtained for HeLa cells at 37°C revealed an apparent K cell association of 4.7 nM (Fig. 4 A ). In the presence of either 150 nM or 1 μM soluble HFE/β 2 m heterodimers, the apparent K cell association increased to 11 nM or 50 nM, respectively (Fig. 4 A ). An apparent K i for inhibition of cell-associated transferrin for the soluble HFE/β 2 m heterodimers was calculated to be 39 nM (Fig. 4 B ). To determine whether the increase in the K cell association for transferrin was specific for the HFE protein, we added to the assay a classical MHC class I protein, a purified soluble form of HLA-B27, complexed with β 2 m ( 23 ). Addition of 100 nM HLA-B27 had no effect on the K cell association of transferrin binding to the TfR (Fig. 4 A ), demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of the HFE/β 2 m heterodimers was specific to HFE, and was not attributable solely to the presence of excess amounts of MHC class I molecules in the assay.

The transferrin binding studies were repeated at 4°C where internalization of ligand is negligible, to determine whether the observed effects of the soluble HFE/β 2 m heterodimers were due to changes in the K D of the TfR for transferrin ( 24 – 26 ). We utilized HeLa cells for these studies because of the high nonspecific transferrin binding in 293 cells observed at 4°C. Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed that in the absence of HFE, the TfR bound transferrin with an apparent K D of 5 nM, which was similar to the K cell association of 4.2 nM observed at 37°C (Fig. 4 C ). In the presence of either 35nM or 1 μM soluble HFE/β 2 m heterodimers the apparent K D increased to 12 and 75 nM, respectively, indicating that the principal effect of added HFE/β 2 m heterodimers is to reduce the affinity of the TfR for transferrin. Further, as was the case for K cell association at 37°C, addition of 100 nM soluble HLA-B27/β 2 m heterodimers to the assay had no effect on transferrin binding at 4°C, supporting the specificity of the inhibition by HFE (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that wild-type HFE can lower the affinity of TfR for transferrin.

The primary defects in hereditary hemochromatosis appear to be both increased iron absorption in the small intestine and increased iron deposition in major organs ( 4 , 5 ). We have demonstrated here that HFE forms a stable complex with the TfR and decreases the affinity of transferrin binding. The C282Y mutation largely eliminates this interaction. We have also shown that the second missense mutation associated with hemochromatosis, H63D, appears to have a similar functional consequence in that it alters the ability of HFE to increase the K cell association for transferrin. The loss of HFE-repressor function for transferrin uptake could result in increased cellular uptake of iron by some tissues, and contribute to iron deposition in HH. How these mutations lead to increased iron absorption in the intestine is unclear. Recent immunohistochemical studies have localized HFE to the intracellular portion of the cells in the deep crypts of the duodenum ( 27 ), the same region where previous studies have localized the TfR ( 28 , 29 ). The role of the TfR in the cells of the deep crypts has long been thought to be limited to servicing the proliferative needs of these cells. In light of the association of HFE and the TfR, one must now reconsider the role of transferrin and its receptor in regulating intestinal iron absorption. Regardless of the actual mechanism, the observations described here provide a molecular link between HFE and iron metabolism and raise the possibility that perturbation of the transferrin/TfR system of iron transport is a previously unrecognized component of HH disease. Furthermore, these results demonstrated that by administering HFE protein in situ , the amount of transferrin taken up by cells can be attenuated. Possibly the HFE/TfR interaction provides a new target for therapeutic agents aimed at influencing iron absorption and/or tissue distribution in iron overload disorders.
