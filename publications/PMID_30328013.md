Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase that interacts 
with the matrix protein (M1) of influenza A virus (IAV) and restricts virus 
replication by regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of M1. 
However, the mechanism by which CypA regulates M1 ubiquitination remains 
unknown. In this study, we reported that E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4 promoted 
K48-linked ubiquitination of M1 at K102 and K104, and accelerated 
ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of M1. The recombinant IAV with mutant 
M1 (K102R/K104R) could not be rescued, suggesting that the ubiquitination of M1 
at K102/K104 was essential for IAV replication. Furthermore, CypA inhibited 
AIP4-mediated M1 ubiquitination by impairing the interaction between AIP4 and 
M1. More importantly, both the mutations of M1 (K102R/K104R) and CypA inhibited 
the nuclear export of M1, indicating that CypA regulates the cellular 
localization of M1 via inhibition of AIP4-mediated M1 ubiquitination at K102 and 
K104, which results in the reduced replication of IAV. Collectively, our 
findings reveal a novel ubiquitination-based mechanism by which CypA regulates 
the replication of IAV.

Abstract

Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase that interacts with the matrix protein (M1) of influenza A virus (IAV) and restricts virus replication by regulating the ubiquitin–proteasome-mediated degradation of M1. However, the mechanism by which CypA regulates M1 ubiquitination remains unknown. In this study, we reported that E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4 promoted K48-linked ubiquitination of M1 at K102 and K104, and accelerated ubiquitin–proteasome-mediated degradation of M1. The recombinant IAV with mutant M1 (K102R/K104R) could not be rescued, suggesting that the ubiquitination of M1 at K102/K104 was essential for IAV replication. Furthermore, CypA inhibited AIP4-mediated M1 ubiquitination by impairing the interaction between AIP4 and M1. More importantly, both the mutations of M1 (K102R/K104R) and CypA inhibited the nuclear export of M1, indicating that CypA regulates the cellular localization of M1 via inhibition of AIP4-mediated M1 ubiquitination at K102 and K104, which results in the reduced replication of IAV. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel ubiquitination-based mechanism by which CypA regulates the replication of IAV.

Introduction

The influenza A virus (IAV) undergoes high mutation rates and has strong seasonal transmission characteristics resulting in high morbidity and mortality in both human and animal hosts (Liu et al. 2013 ; Zhu et al. 2013 ). Deeper insights into the pathogenic mechanism of IAV are urgently required for promoting the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. IAV belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae and its genome consists of eight single-stranded negative sense RNA fragments. The viral RNA (vRNA), nucleoprotein (NP), and three viral polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, and PA) form the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex that is responsible for viral replication, transcription, and packaging (Klumpp et al. 1997 ; Arranz et al. 2012 ). The matrix protein (M1), an abundant structural component of the influenza A viral particle, acts as an essential anchor for regulating nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of vRNP (Martin and Helenius 1991 ).

Ubiquitination is an enzymatic posttranslational modification that targets proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation and is tightly linked to extracellular signaling (Calistri et al. 2014 ). The process is orchestrated by a series of enzymes starting with the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, followed by the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, and finally, by E3 ubiquitin ligase that covalently links ubiquitin to the lysine (K) residue of target proteins (Chau et al. 1989 ; Rudnicka and Yamauchi 2016 ). Ubiquitination plays a vital role in IAV infection and it has been reported that the ubiquitination and de-ubiquitination of NP plays a critical role in the regulation of RNA replication of IAV (Liao et al. 2010 ). Furthermore, IAV RNA synthesis depends on the ubiquitin–proteasome system (Widjaja et al. 2010 ). There is however, very little data reported on M1 ubiquitination and its function during IAV replication.

SUMOylation is an important post-translational modification that functions similar to ubiquitination. SUMOylation of M1 at K242 ensures IAV assembly and release by forming M1-vRNP complex (Wu et al. 2011 ). Additionally, NS2 interaction with AIMP2 facilitates the switch from ubiquitination to SUMOylation of IAV M1 at K242 (Gao et al. 2015 ). E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch/AIP4 has been found to regulate M1 ubiquitination and plays important roles in IAV release from the endosome during virus entry (Su et al. 2013 ).

Cyclophilin A (CypA), a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, is an important host factor that participates in viral infection, protein folding, cell signaling, inflammation, and tumorigenesis (Handschumacher et al. 1984 ; Luban 2007 ; Sun et al. 2014 ). Our previous studies showed that CypA could inhibit IAV replication by promoting the RIG-I-mediated antiviral immune responses (Liu et al. 2017 ). Moreover, CypA interacted with IAV M1 protein and inhibited virus replication by regulating ubiquitin–proteasome degradation of the M1 protein (Liu et al. 2009 ; Xu et al. 2010 ; Liu et al. 2012 ). However, the precise mechanism by which CypA affects M1 ubiquitination still remains less understood. In this study, we found that E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4 mediated M1 ubiquitination at K102 and K104 and affected M1 stability via ubiquitin–proteasome degradation pathway, while CypA inhibited M1 ubiquitination by impairing the interaction of M1 with AIP4. Furthermore, the immunofluorescence co-localization results showed that both the mutations of M1 (K102R/K104R) and CypA had strong influence on the cellular localization of M1.

Discussion

In our previous study, we had reported that CypA inhibited the replication of IAV (Liu et al. 2009 ). We had also attempted to elucidate the antiviral mechanism of CypA and reported that CypA increased the interaction between E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 and RIG-I, promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I. Furthermore, CypA and TRIM25 interacted with MAVS in a competitive manner, inhibiting TRIM25-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of MAVS. Thus, CypA could inhibit virus replication via enhancing RIG-I-mediated antiviral immune responses (Liu et al. 2017 ). Moreover, we also found that CypA inhibited IAV replication through degradation of M1 (Liu et al. 2012 ). In the current study, we further elaborate that CypA inhibited AIP4-mediated ubiquitination of M1 at K102 and K104 by impairing the interaction of AIP4 with M1. It is possible that the ubiquitination of M1 as one of the modifications to modify target proteins can improve the IAV replication by inhibiting the functions of M1, which played a major role in viral replication. As the degradation of M1 is only one of the outcomes M1 ubiquitination, its role in inhibiting viral replication may only be a minor one. The above studies reveal a ubiquitination-based mechanism by which CypA regulates the replication of IAV.

Ubiquitination, a dynamic and reversible post-translational modification that plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis. During their evolution, many viruses attempt to escape immune responses of the infected host cells. They can establish a successful infection by hijacking the ubiquitination pathway of the host. For example, the influenza virus selectively exploits the ubiquitin–vacuolar protein sorting system to entry into the host cells successfully (Khor et al. 2003 ). Compared with the phosphorylation of influenza virus proteins, there are few studies focusing on their ubiquitination. K184 mono-ubiquitination of nucleoprotein (NP) increases IAV RNA replication and cellular deubiquitinating enzyme USP11 decreases polymerase activity and viral replication. (Liao et al. 2010 ). Ectopically overexpressing ubiquitin up-regulates polymerase function in a dose-dependent fashion causing increased accumulation of vRNA, cRNA and mRNA and enhanced viral gene expression during infection (Kirui et al. 2016 ). E3 ligase TRIM22 was reported to inhibit influenza A virus infection by targeting NP for degradation (Di Pietro et al. 2013 ). AIMP2 interacts with nonstructural protein 2 (NS2, also named NEP) of IAV and suppresses M1 ubiquitination at K242 and protein degradation by an unknown mechanism, and then promotes IAV replication (Gao et al. 2015 ). Collectively, ubiquitination can positively or negatively regulate viral replication via different mechanisms. Here, we showed that CypA impaired AIP4-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of M1 and reduced the replication of IAV, suggesting that the ubiquitination and degradation of M1 played a positive role during viral replication. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2 B and Fig. 3 C, the K102R/K104R mutations resulted in dramatic but not complete inhibition of M1 degradation, indicating that there may be other ways in which M1 undergoes degradation. We speculated that other E3 ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitination sites on M1 might participate in the ubiquitination of M1 and play different roles. Further studies on the ubiquitination mechanism of IAV proteins may yield exciting results.

At the early stage of IAV infection, newly synthesized M1 translocates to the nucleus to mediate vRNP nuclear export (Ye et al. 1987 ; Sha and Luo 1997 ; Bui et al. 2000 ; Baudin et al. 2001 ). While at the late stage, M1 is exported from the nucleus to block the reentry of vRNPs into the nucleus, mediate viral assembly and budding, and control virus morphology (Martin and Helenius 1991 ; Burleigh et al. 2005 ; Calder et al. 2010 ; Wu et al. 2011 ). In this study, we observed that CypA and K102R/K104R altered the cellular localization of M1. It has been reported that K102 and K104 are located within the NLS and NEP binding domain of M1, and NEP binding to M1 is essential for the nuclear export of vRNP in infected cells (Shimizu et al. 2011 ). Therefore, it is possible that CypA could regulate the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of vRNP by affecting the NLS of M1 and/or NEP binding to M1, which need to be further explored.

In summary, we show that CypA inhibited AIP4-mediated M1 ubiquitination at K102 and K104 by impairing the interaction of AIP4 with M1, followed by the suppression of the nuclear export of M1, and finally reduction of the replication of IAV. Essentially our study provides deeper insights of the ubiquitination regulation mechanism of IAV proteins and replication. Studies such as this pave the way for more sophisticated therapeutic approach to combat influenza infection.
