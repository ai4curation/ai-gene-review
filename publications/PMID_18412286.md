Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited disease characterized by pure 
erythroid aplasia. Thirty percent (30%) of patients display malformations, 
especially of the hands, face, heart, and urogenital tract. DBA has an autosomal 
dominant pattern of inheritance. De novo mutations are common and familial cases 
display wide clinical heterogeneity. Twenty-five percent (25%) of patients carry 
a mutation in the ribosomal protein (RP) S19 gene, whereas mutations in RPS24, 
RPS17, RPL35A, RPL11, and RPL5 are rare. These genes encode for structural 
proteins of the ribosome. A link between ribosomal functions and erythroid 
aplasia is apparent in DBA, but its etiology is not clear. Most authors agree 
that a defect in protein synthesis in a rapidly proliferating tissue, such as 
the erythroid bone marrow, may explain the defective erythropoiesis. A total of 
77 RPS19 mutations have been described. Most are whole gene deletions, 
translocations, or truncating mutations (nonsense or frameshift), suggesting 
that haploinsufficiency is the basis of DBA pathology. A total of 22 missense 
mutations have also been described and several works have provided in vitro 
functional data for the mutant proteins. This review looks at the data on all 
these mutations, proposes a functional classification, and describes six new 
mutations. It is shown that patients with RPS19 mutations display a poorer 
response to steroids and a worse long-term prognosis compared to other DBA 
patients.
