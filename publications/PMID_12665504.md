Various neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, stimulate adenylyl cyclase to 
produce cAMP, which regulates neuronal functions. Genetic disruption of the type 
5 adenylyl cyclase isoform led to a major loss of adenylyl cyclase activity in a 
striatum-specific manner with a small increase in the expression of a few other 
adenylyl cyclase isoforms. D1 dopaminergic agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase 
activity was attenuated, and this was accompanied by a decrease in the 
expression of the D1 dopaminergic receptor and G(s)alpha. D2 dopaminergic 
agonist-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity was also blunted. Type 
5 adenylyl cyclase-null mice exhibited Parkinsonian-like motor dysfunction, i.e. 
abnormal coordination and bradykinesia detected by Rotarod and pole test, 
respectively, and to a lesser extent locomotor impairment was detected by open 
field tests. Selective D1 or D2 dopaminergic stimulation improved some of these 
disorders in this mouse model, suggesting the partial compensation of each 
dopaminergic receptor signal through the stimulation of remnant adenylyl cyclase 
isoforms. These findings extend our knowledge of the role of an effector enzyme 
isoform in regulating receptor signaling and neuronal functions and imply that 
this isoform provides a site of convergence of both D1 and D2 dopaminergic 
signals and balances various motor functions.
