The transcription factor c-Myc is a cellular oncoprotein generally upregulated 
in most of human cancers. NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) caused 
phosphorylation and stabilization of c-Myc protein in the nucleus through direct 
interaction. The interaction caused reduced ubiquitination of c-Myc by 
inhibiting ubiquitinating activity of Fbw7 without blocking the interaction 
between c-Myc and Fbw7. As a consequence, NEMO enhanced the expression of 
several selected c-Myc targets. Compared to the classical role as an essential 
subunit for the activity of IKK complex, stabilization of c-Myc by direct 
interaction is a unique function of NEMO, representing a new mechanism to 
regulate c-Myc activity.
