Environmental injury has been associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, 
a response characterized by activation of the unfolded protein response, 
proteasomal degradation of proteins, and induction of HSPA5, also known as GRP78 
or BiP. Although HSPA5 has been implicated in the stress response to 
environmental injury in several cell types, its role in the glomerular ER stress 
response is unknown. In this study, we evaluated HSPA5 activation profiles in 
rat glomerular mesangial cells (rGMCs) challenged with heavy metals (HgCl2 or 
Pb2+ acetate) or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, ie, benzo(a)pyrene 
[BaP]). Challenge of rGMCs with 1 or 10 microM HgCl2 or Pb2+ acetate increased 
HSPA5 mRNA and protein levels. The induction response was sensitive to 
transcriptional and translational inhibition by actinomycin D (AD) and 
cyclohexamide, respectively. HSPA5 mRNA was induced by 3 microM BaP in an 
AD-sensitive manner, but this response was unaffected by the presence of heavy 
metals. A promoter construct containing sequences that mediate thapsigargin (TH) 
inducibility of the HSPA5 promoter was refractory to both heavy metals and BaP. 
The HSPA5 induction response in rGMCs is conserved because it was reproduced 
with fidelity in immunolocalization experiments of HSPA5 protein in M15 and 
HEK293 cells in embryonic lines of murine and human origin, respectively. 
Collectively, these findings identify HSPA5 in the stress response of rGMCs and 
implicate regulatory mechanisms that are distinct from those involved in TH 
inducibility.
