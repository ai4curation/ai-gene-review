Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is a 524,000-Da protein that is 
expressed at high levels in the territorial matrix of chondrocytes. The 
sequences of rat and bovine COMP indicate that it is a member of the 
thrombospondin gene family. In this study, we have cloned and sequenced human 
COMP. Phylogenetic analysis using progressive sequence alignment and two 
parsimony-based algorithms indicates that the COMP gene and a precursor of the 
thrombospondin-3 and -4 genes were produced by a gene duplication that occurred 
750 million years ago. An interspecific backcross mapping panel has been used to 
map the murine COMP gene to the central region of mouse chromosome 8. Southern 
blot analysis of a somatic cell hybrid DNA panel and in situ hybridization to 
human metaphase chromosomes indicate that the human COMP gene is located on 
chromosome 19 in band p13.1. These data confirm and extend the known regions of 
homology between human and mouse chromosomes and establish that COMP, like 
thrombospondin-1, -2, -3, and -4, is present in the human and mouse genomes.
