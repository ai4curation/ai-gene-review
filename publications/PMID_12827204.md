Far-red light regulates many aspects of seedling development, such as inhibition 
of hypocotyl elongation and the promotion of greening, acting in part through 
phytochrome A (phyA). The RING motif protein COP1 is also important because cop1 
mutants exhibit constitutive photomorphogenesis in darkness. COP1 is present in 
the nucleus in darkness but is gradually relocated to the cytoplasm upon 
illumination. Here we show that COP1 functions as an E3 ligase ubiquitinating 
both itself and the myb transcription activator LAF1, which is required for 
complete phyA responses. In transgenic plants, inducible COP1 overexpression 
leads to a decrease in LAF1 concentrations, but is blocked by the proteasome 
inhibitor MG132. The coiled-coil domain of SPA1, a negative regulator of phyA 
signalling, has no effect on COP1 auto-ubiquitination but facilitates LAF1 
ubiquitination at low COP1 concentrations. These results indicate that, in 
darkness, COP1 functions as a repressor of photomorphogenesis by promoting the 
ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of a subset of positive regulators, including 
LAF1. After the activation of phyA, SPA1 stimulates the E3 activity of residual 
nuclear COP1 to ubiquitinate LAF1, thereby desensitizing phyA signals.
