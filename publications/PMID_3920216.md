Binding and activation of plasminogen on the platelet surface.

Miles LA, Plow EF.

A mechanism by which platelets might participate in fibrinolysis by binding 
plasminogen and influencing its activation has been examined. Binding of 
radioiodinated human Glu-plasminogen to washed human platelets was 
time-dependent and was enhanced 3-9-fold by stimulation of platelets with 
thrombin but not with ADP. The interaction with both stimulated and unstimulated 
cells was specific, saturable, divalent ion-independent, and reversible. The 
platelet-bound ligand had the molecular weight of plasminogen, and no conversion 
to plasmin was detected. Scatchard analyses provided evidence for a single class 
of plasminogen-binding sites on both stimulated and unstimulated cells. The Kd 
for thrombin-stimulated platelets was 2.6 +/- 1.3 microM, and 190,000 +/- 45,000 
molecules were bound per cell, whereas unstimulated platelets bound 37,000 +/- 
10,500 molecules/cell with a Kd of 1.9 +/- 0.15 microM. Plasminogen binding was 
inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by omega-aminocarboxylic acids at 
concentrations consistent with a requirement for an unoccupied high affinity 
lysine-binding site for plasminogen binding to the cells. When platelet-bound 
plasminogen was incubated with tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase, or 
streptokinase, gel analysis established that plasmin was preferentially 
associated with the platelet relative to the supernatant. Plasminogen and 
plasmin interacted with thrombin-stimulated platelets with similar binding 
characteristics, and there was no evidence for a binding site for plasmin which 
did not also bind plasminogen. Therefore, the results suggest that plasminogen 
activation is enhanced on the cell surface. In sum, these results indicate that 
platelets bind plasminogen at physiologic zymogen concentrations and this 
interaction may serve to localize and promote plasminogen activation.
