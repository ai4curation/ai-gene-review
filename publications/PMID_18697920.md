Production of ribosomes is a fundamental process that occurs in all dividing 
cells. It is a complex process consisting of the coordinated synthesis and 
assembly of four ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) with about 80 ribosomal proteins 
(r-proteins) involving more than 150 nonribosomal proteins and other factors. 
Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited red cell aplasia caused by 
mutations in one of several r-proteins. How defects in r-proteins, essential for 
proliferation in all cells, lead to a human disease with a specific defect in 
red cell development is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of r-proteins in 
ribosome biogenesis in order to find out whether those mutated in DBA have any 
similarities. We depleted HeLa cells using siRNA for several individual 
r-proteins of the small (RPS6, RPS7, RPS15, RPS16, RPS17, RPS19, RPS24, RPS25, 
RPS28) or large subunit (RPL5, RPL7, RPL11, RPL14, RPL26, RPL35a) and studied 
the effect on rRNA processing and ribosome production. Depleting r-proteins in 
one of the subunits caused, with a few exceptions, a decrease in all r-proteins 
of the same subunit and a decrease in the corresponding subunit, fully assembled 
ribosomes, and polysomes. R-protein depletion, with a few exceptions, led to the 
accumulation of specific rRNA precursors, highlighting their individual roles in 
rRNA processing. Depletion of r-proteins mutated in DBA always compromised 
ribosome biogenesis while affecting either subunit and disturbing rRNA 
processing at different levels, indicating that the rate of ribosome production 
rather than a specific step in ribosome biogenesis is critical in patients with 
DBA.
