Activation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is believed to be the 
mechanism by which the pharmaceuticals, metformin and phenformin, exert their 
beneficial effects for treatment of type 2 diabetes. These biguanide drugs 
elevate 5'-AMP, which allosterically activates AMPK and promotes phosphorylation 
on Thr172 of AMPK catalytic α subunits. Although kinases phosphorylating this 
site have been identified, phosphatases that dephosphorylate it are unknown. The 
aim of this study is to identify protein phosphatase(s) that dephosphorylate 
AMPKα-Thr172 within cells. Our initial data indicated that members of the 
protein phosphatase Mg/Mn(2+)-dependent [corrected] (PPM) family and not those 
of the PPP family of protein serine/threonine phosphatases may be directly or 
indirectly inhibited by phenformin. Using antibodies raised to individual Ppm 
phosphatases that facilitated the assessment of their activities, phenformin 
stimulation of cells was found to decrease the Mg(2+)/Mn(2+)-dependent 
[corrected] protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity of Ppm1E and Ppm1F, 
but not that attributable to other PPM family members, including Ppm1A/PP2Cα. 
Depletion of Ppm1E, but not Ppm1A, using lentiviral-mediated stable gene 
silencing, increased AMPKα-Thr172 phosphorylation approximately three fold in 
HEK293 cells. In addition, incubation of cells with low concentrations of 
phenformin and depletion of Ppm1E increased AMPK phosphorylation 
synergistically. Ppm1E and the closely related Ppm1F interact weakly with AMPK 
and assays with lysates of cells stably depleted of Ppm1F suggest [corrected] 
that this phosphatase contributes to dephosphorylation of AMPK. The data 
indicate that Ppm1E and probably PpM1F are in cellulo AMPK phosphatases and that 
Ppm1E is a potential anti-diabetic drug target.
