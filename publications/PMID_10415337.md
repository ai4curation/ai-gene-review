p53 exerts important physiological functions in cell-cycle control, gene 
regulation, cell differentiation, apoptosis and tumor suppression by interacting 
with many cellular proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we screened a 
HeLa cDNA library and identified a novel gene encoding a p53-binding protein 
(p53BP3). The full-length cDNA of p53BP3 was isolated from a HeLalambdagt10 cDNA 
library. This predicted protein was composed of 815 amino acids. Sequence 
analysis indicated that p53BP3 contained two bipartite nuclear localization 
signals and was confirmed to be a nuclear protein. FISH mapping results showed 
that this novel gene was located at human chromosome 12, region p11.2-p12.1. 
Northern blot analysis suggested that p53BP3 was broadly expressed in human 
tissues. A further study showed that p53BP3 had a homologue in mouse.
