Plants have circadian oscillations in the concentration of cytosolic free 
calcium ([Ca(2+)](cyt)). To dissect the circadian Ca(2+)-signaling network, we 
monitored circadian [Ca(2+)](cyt) oscillations under various light/dark 
conditions (including different spectra) in Arabidopsis thaliana wild type and 
photoreceptor and circadian clock mutants. Both red and blue light regulate 
circadian oscillations of [Ca(2+)](cyt). Red light signaling is mediated by 
PHYTOCHROME B (PHYB). Blue light signaling occurs through the redundant action 
of CRYPTOCHROME1 (CRY1) and CRY2. Blue light also increases the basal level of 
[Ca(2+)](cyt), and this response requires PHYB, CRY1, and CRY2. Light input into 
the oscillator controlling [Ca(2+)](cyt) rhythms is gated by EARLY FLOWERING3. 
Signals generated in the dark also regulate the circadian behavior of 
[Ca(2+)](cyt). Oscillations of [Ca(2+)](cyt) and CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING 
PROTEIN2 (CAB2) promoter activity are dependent on the rhythmic expression of 
LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL and CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1, but [Ca(2+)](cyt) and 
CAB2 promoter activity are uncoupled in the timing of cab1 (toc1-1) mutant but 
not in toc1-2. We suggest that the circadian oscillations of [Ca(2+)](cyt) and 
CAB2 promoter activity are regulated by distinct oscillators with similar 
components that are used in a different manner and that these oscillators may be 
located in different cell types in Arabidopsis.

Abstract

Plants have circadian oscillations in the concentration of cytosolic free calcium ([Ca 2+ ] cyt ). To dissect the circadian Ca 2+ -signaling network, we monitored circadian [Ca 2+ ] cyt oscillations under various light/dark conditions (including different spectra) in Arabidopsis thaliana wild type and photoreceptor and circadian clock mutants. Both red and blue light regulate circadian oscillations of [Ca 2+ ] cyt . Red light signaling is mediated by PHYTOCHROME B (PHYB). Blue light signaling occurs through the redundant action of CRYPTOCHROME1 (CRY1) and CRY2. Blue light also increases the basal level of [Ca 2+ ] cyt , and this response requires PHYB, CRY1, and CRY2. Light input into the oscillator controlling [Ca 2+ ] cyt rhythms is gated by EARLY FLOWERING3. Signals generated in the dark also regulate the circadian behavior of [Ca 2+ ] cyt . Oscillations of [Ca 2+ ] cyt and CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN2 ( CAB2 ) promoter activity are dependent on the rhythmic expression of LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL and CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1 , but [Ca 2+ ] cyt and CAB2 promoter activity are uncoupled in the timing of cab1 ( toc1 -1) mutant but not in toc1 -2. We suggest that the circadian oscillations of [Ca 2+ ] cyt and CAB2 promoter activity are regulated by distinct oscillators with similar components that are used in a different manner and that these oscillators may be located in different cell types in Arabidopsis .

INTRODUCTION

In plants, cytosolic free Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] cyt ) can oscillate in response to extracellular stimuli and circadian signals. Stimulus-induced oscillations of [Ca 2+ ] cyt with periods of minutes occur in root hairs in response to NOD factors ( Ehrhardt et al., 1996 ; Sun et al., 2006 ) and in guard cells in response to external Ca 2+ , abscisic acid, cold, fungal elicitors, and CO 2 ( McAinsh et al., 1995 ; Staxén et al., 1999 ; Klüsener et al., 2002 ; Young et al., 2006 ). Cytosolic and chloroplastic [Ca 2+ ] also have oscillations with a period of ∼24 h ( Johnson et al., 1995 ). Circadian oscillations of [Ca 2+ ] cyt persist in constant light and light/dark cycles, are phase-shifted by light/dark signals, and have different patterns in amplitude, phase, and waveform according to photoperiod and light intensity ( Johnson et al., 1995 ; Love et al., 2004 ). Oscillations in [Ca 2+ ] cyt are thought to be important in encoding information in Ca 2+ signaling networks, and it has been suggested that circadian oscillations of [Ca 2+ ] cyt might encode temporal information to regulate cellular physiology ( Johnson et al., 1995 ; Webb, 2003 ; Dodd et al., 2005a ; Gardner et al., 2005 ) and/or contribute to the control of the photoperiodic regulation of flowering ( Johnson et al., 1995 ; Love et al., 2004 ).

The function of circadian oscillations of [Ca 2+ ] cyt is not known, but this is a common feature of many frequently measured circadian outputs in plants, such as CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN2 ( CAB2 ) promoter activity, leaf movement, and hypocotyl elongation. It is also often a matter of speculation how these circadian outputs contribute to the competitive advantage conferred by a correctly functioning circadian clock ( Dodd et al., 2005b ; Hotta et al., 2007 ). In order to understand further the role of circadian oscillations of [Ca 2+ ] cyt , we wished to establish the genetic basis for the control of these oscillations and their relationship with both the core components of the plant circadian oscillator and photoreceptor pathways. These experiments were designed to determine whether Ca 2+ functions as an input or output of the circadian system. In addition, we wished to determine whether the same genetic oscillator regulates [Ca 2+ ] cyt and CAB2 promoter activity, because there are differences in the circadian regulation of these outputs; most notably, CAB2:luciferase ( CAB2:luc ) rhythms can persist in the absence of [Ca 2+ ] cyt rhythms in undifferentiated tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum ) calli ( Sai and Johnson, 1999 ).

In Arabidopsis thaliana , a feedback loop composed of CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1), LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), and TIMING OF CAB1 (TOC1) is thought to underlie most circadian behavior ( Alabadí et al., 2001 ; Gardner et al., 2006 ; for review, see McClung, 2006 ). CCA1 and LHY are related MYB-like transcription factors whose protein and mRNA abundance have a circadian rhythm that peaks around dawn. Overexpression of either CCA1 or LHY disrupts circadian clock function, including leaf movement and transcription of CAB2 , CATALASE3 , and COLD AND CIRCADIAN REGULATED2 ( CCR2 ), and delays flowering ( Schaffer et al., 1998 ; Wang and Tobin, 1998 ). The expression of TOC1 , which encodes a pseudo-response regulator (PRR), peaks around dusk and indirectly promotes CCA1/LHY expression at dawn ( Alabadí et al., 2001 ). toc1 -1 shortens the period of circadian rhythms, while overexpression of TOC1 causes arrhythmia ( Millar et al., 1995 ; Más et al., 2003a ). CCA1 and LHY downregulate their own expression by repressing that of TOC1 ( Alabadí et al., 2001 ). Therefore, CCA1, LHY, and TOC1 could constitute a negative-feedback loop that can act as a circadian timing mechanism. Degradation of TOC1, an essential requirement for rhythmicity, is thought to be mediated by ZEITLUPE (ZTL) ( Somers et al., 2000 ; Más et al., 2003b ; Kevei et al., 2006 ). In agreement with this hypothesis, ztl-1 lengthens circadian period in a light-dependent manner ( Más et al., 2003b ). The circadian oscillator is entrained by red and blue light via the PHYTOCHROMES (PHY) and CRYPTOCHROMES (CRY) ( Millar, 2004 ; Salomé and McClung, 2005 ). Light input to the clock is gated by EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) to ensure correct entrainment of the clock to dawn ( Hicks et al., 1996 ; McWatters et al., 2000 ).

Genetic and mathematical studies have elaborated the CCA1/LHY/TOC1 model, identifying new components and suggesting a system of interlocking loops. One of the interconnecting loops may involve ELF4. ELF4 is necessary for light-induced expression of both CCA1 and LHY , and ELF4 is expressed with a similar phase as TOC1 , suggesting that ELF4, together with CCA1/LHY, might form yet another negative-feedback loop ( Kikis et al., 2005 ). On the basis of mathematical modeling, a hypothetical light-induced factor Y has been proposed to form a loop with TOC1 ( Locke et al., 2005a , 2005b ). Y is thought to both activate TOC1 expression and be required for TOC1-induced expression of LHY . Y is subsequently repressed by TOC1 and CCA1/LHY. GIGANTEA is thought to fulfill at least some of the roles of Y ( Locke et al., 2005a , 2005b ; Gould et al., 2006 ). Recently, two different groups independently suggested that there is a further negative-feedback loop between CCA1/LHY and PRR7/PRR9 ( Locke et al., 2006 ; Zeilinger et al., 2006 ). Finally, a MYB transcription factor, LUX ARRHYTHMO, can also be part of the central oscillator ( Hazen et al., 2005 ; Onai and Ishiura, 2005 ). Thus, the Arabidopsis circadian system comprises more than one transcriptional feedback loop to regulate different clock output pathways and provide robustness.

In this study, we analyzed the pattern of circadian oscillations of [Ca 2+ ] cyt in wild-type and mutant lines for photoreceptor and clock genes of Arabidopsis carrying the transgenic bioluminescent reporter of Ca 2+ , aequorin ( Knight et al., 1991 ). Our data indicate that Ca 2+ is an output of the circadian clock, which is regulated by similar clock genes and photoreceptors to other outputs. Differences in the regulation of [Ca 2+ ] cyt by light, dark, and clock gene mutations compared with other circadian outputs in Arabidopsis indicate that multiple circadian oscillators with common components are present.

DISCUSSION

Our data demonstrate that in Arabidopsis seedlings, the circadian oscillation of [Ca 2+ ] cyt is regulated by red and blue light through CRY1, CRY2, PHYB, and, possibly, PHYA. Red and blue light regulate both the amplitude of the oscillations and also the basal level of [Ca 2+ ] cyt . Additionally, unknown signals regulate the basal level of [Ca 2+ ] cyt at night and in prolonged darkness. Circadian oscillations of [Ca 2+ ] cyt are regulated by several core clock genes ( LHY , CCA1 , TOC1 , ELF3 , and ZTL ), which contribute to the control of a wide range of circadian outputs, including leaf and stomatal movements, gene expression, and rhythms of photosynthesis ( Gardner et al., 2006 ). Surprisingly, [Ca 2+ ] cyt rhythms are unaffected by toc1 -1; this and other genetic differences in the regulation of circadian oscillations of [Ca 2+ ] cyt from other circadian outputs suggest the presence of multiple circadian oscillators in Arabidopsis .
