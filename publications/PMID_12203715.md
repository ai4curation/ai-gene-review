Previously, we demonstrated that chick embryos treated with antisense 
oligonucleotides against a striated muscle-specific Xin exhibit abnormal cardiac 
morphogenesis (Wang et al. [1999] Development 126:1281-1294); therefore, we 
surmised a role for Xin in cardiac development. Herein, we examine the 
developmental expression of Xin through immunofluorescent staining of 
whole-mount mouse embryos and frozen heart sections. Xin expression is first 
observed within the heart tube of embryonic day 8.0 (E8.0) mice, exhibiting a 
peripheral localization within the cardiomyocytes. Colocalization of Xin with 
both beta-catenin and N-cadherin is observed throughout embryogenesis and into 
adulthood. Additionally, Xin is found associated with beta-catenin within the 
N-cadherin complex in embryonic chick hearts by coimmunoprecipitation. Xin is 
detected earlier than vinculin in the developing heart and colocalizes with 
vinculin at the intercalated disc but not at the sarcolemma within embryonic and 
postnatal hearts. At E10.0, Xin is also detected in the developing somites and 
later in the myotendon junction of skeletal muscle but not within the costameric 
regions of muscle. In cultured C2C12 myotubes, the Xin protein is found in many 
speckled and filamentous structures, coincident with tropomyosin in the stress 
fibers. Additionally, Xin is enriched in the regions of cell-cell contacts. 
These data demonstrate that Xin is one of the components at the adherens 
junction of cardiac muscle, and its counterpart in skeletal muscle, the 
myotendon junction. Furthermore, temporal and spatial expressions of Xin in 
relation to intercalated disc proteins and thin filament proteins suggest roles 
for Xin in the formation of cell-cell contacts and possibly in 
myofibrillogenesis.
