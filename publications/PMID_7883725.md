The recombinant CelS (rCelS), the most abundant catalytic subunit of the 
Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome, displayed typical exoglucanase 
characteristics, including (i) a preference for amorphous or crystalline 
cellulose over carboxymethyl cellulose, (ii) an inability to reduce the 
viscosity of a carboxymethyl cellulose solution, and (iii) the production of few 
bound reducing ends on the solid substrate. The hydrolysis products from 
crystalline cellulose were cellobiose and cellotriose at a ratio of 5:1. The 
rCelS activity on amorphous cellulose was optimal at 70 degrees C and at pH 5 to 
6. Its thermostability was increased by Ca2+. Sulfhydryl reagents had only a 
mild adverse effect on the rCelS activity. Cellotetraose was the smallest 
oligosaccharide substrate for rCelS, and the hydrolysis rate increased with the 
substrate chain length. Many of these properties were consistent with those of 
the cellulosome, indicating a key role for CelS.
