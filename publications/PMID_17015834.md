DJ-1/PARK7, a cancer- and Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated protein, protects 
cells from toxic stresses. However, the functional basis of this protection has 
remained elusive. We found that loss of DJ-1 leads to deficits in NQO1 [NAD(P)H 
quinone oxidoreductase 1], a detoxification enzyme. This deficit is attributed 
to a loss of Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor), a master 
regulator of antioxidant transcriptional responses. DJ-1 stabilizes Nrf2 by 
preventing association with its inhibitor protein, Keap1, and Nrf2's subsequent 
ubiquitination. Without intact DJ-1, Nrf2 protein is unstable, and 
transcriptional responses are thereby decreased both basally and after 
induction. This effect of DJ-1 on Nrf2 is present in both transformed lines and 
primary cells across human and mouse species. DJ-1's effect on Nrf2 and 
subsequent effects on antioxidant responses may explain how DJ-1 affects the 
etiology of both cancer and PD, which are seemingly disparate disorders. 
Furthermore, this DJ-1/Nrf2 functional axis presents a therapeutic target in 
cancer treatment and justifies DJ-1 as a tumor biomarker.
