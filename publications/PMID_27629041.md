In response to diverse stress stimuli, eukaryotic cells activate a common 
adaptive pathway, termed the integrated stress response (ISR), to restore 
cellular homeostasis. The core event in this pathway is the phosphorylation of 
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) by one of four members 
of the eIF2α kinase family, which leads to a decrease in global protein 
synthesis and the induction of selected genes, including the transcription 
factor ATF4, that together promote cellular recovery. The gene expression 
program activated by the ISR optimizes the cellular response to stress and is 
dependent on the cellular context, as well as on the nature and intensity of the 
stress stimuli. Although the ISR is primarily a pro-survival, homeostatic 
program, exposure to severe stress can drive signaling toward cell death. Here, 
we review current understanding of the ISR signaling and how it regulates cell 
fate under diverse types of stress.
