Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is crucial in numerous cellular 
processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. 
TGF-beta signaling is transduced by intracellular Smad proteins that are 
regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 2 
(Smurf2) prevents TGF-beta and bone morphogenetic protein signaling by 
interacting with Smads and inducing their ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Here 
we identified Pin1, a peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase, as a novel protein 
binding Smads. Pin1 interacted with Smad2 and Smad3 but not Smad4; this 
interaction was enhanced by the phosphorylation of (S/T)P motifs in the Smad 
linker region. (S/T)P motif phosphorylation also enhanced the interaction of 
Smad2/3 with Smurf2. Pin1 reduced Smad2/3 protein levels in a manner dependent 
on its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. Knockdown of Pin1 increased 
the protein levels of endogenous Smad2/3. In addition, Pin1 both enhanced the 
interaction of Smurf2 with Smads and enhanced Smad ubiquitination. Pin1 
inhibited TGF-beta-induced transcription and gene expression, suggesting that 
Pin1 negatively regulates TGF-beta signaling by down-regulating Smad2/3 protein 
levels via induction of Smurf2-mediated ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation.
