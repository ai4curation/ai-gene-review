We have purified to homogeneity a cytosolic factor from Escherichia coli that is 
required for the translocation of a preprotein into inverted vesicles of the E. 
coli plasma membrane. The preprotein used is a precursor of mutant 
maltose-binding protein. This mutant contains alterations of the carboxyl 
terminus. Unlike the precursor for wild-type maltose-binding protein, the mutant 
precursor does not acquire a protease-resistant conformation after synthesis and 
retains posttranslational translocation competence. The purified cytosolic 
factor, added posttranslationally, is necessary and sufficient to yield 
virtually 100% translocation of the mutant precursor into inverted vesicles. The 
purified factor amounts to 0.08% of the cytosolic proteins and is a 64-kDa 
tetramer consisting of four identical 16-kDa subunits. Amino-terminal sequence 
analysis revealed that it is identical to the secB gene product. The purified 
SecB homotetramer is part of a larger 150-kDa complex that represents the 
"export" factor activity. During purification, the export factor activity 
dissociates into a 64-kDa SecB homotetramer and unidentified component(s). For 
the posttranslational integration of another preprotein, the precursor for the 
lamB gene product, into inverted vesicles, the 64-kDa SecB homotetramer is also 
required but additional factor(s) makes integration more efficient.
