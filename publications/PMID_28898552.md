The ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP) family of proteins 
mediates purinergic signaling by degrading extracellular nucleotides and also 
participates in phospholipid metabolism. NPP5 (ENPP5) is the least characterized 
member of this group and its specific role is unknown. This enzyme does not 
display activity on certain nucleotides and on other typical NPP substrates. In 
order to gain insights into its function, we determined the crystal structure of 
human and murine NPP5. Structural comparison with close homologs revealed a key 
phenylalanine to tyrosine substitution that prevents efficient hydrolysis of 
nucleotide diphosphates and triphosphates; reversal of this mutation enabled 
degradation of these molecules. Interestingly, NPP5 is able to cleave 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), suggesting a potential role of this 
enzyme in NAD-based neurotransmission. An NPP5-specific metal binding motif is 
found adjacent to the active site, although its significance is unclear. These 
findings expand our understanding of substrate specificity within the NPP 
family.
