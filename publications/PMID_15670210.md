Human WRNIP1, a Werner DNA helicase interacting protein 1, was expressed in 
insect cells and E. coli. The purified protein behaved as a homo-oligomeric 
complex with a native molecular mass indicative of an octamer, and the complex 
copurified with an ATPase activity that was stimulated by double-stranded DNA 
ends. As suggested by genetic studies of budding yeast WRNIP1/Mgs1, the purified 
human WRNIP1 complex interacted physically with human DNA polymerase delta (pol 
delta), stimulating its DNA synthesis activity more than fivefold in the 
presence or absence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Analysis of reaction 
products demonstrated the stimulation to be partly due to an increased 
processivity of pol delta but more importantly to an increase in its initiation 
frequency. Addition of ATP to reactions partially suppressed stimulation by 
WRNIP1. Furthermore, a mutant WRNIP1 lacking ATPase activity could stimulate pol 
delta normally but was insensitive to suppression by ATP. These results indicate 
that WRNIP1 functions as a modulator for initiation or restart events during pol 
delta-mediated DNA synthesis and that its ATPase activity is utilized to sense 
DNA ends and to regulate the extent of stimulation.
