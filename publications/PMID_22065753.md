The heat shock protein 70 kDa (Hsp70)/DnaJ/nucleotide exchange factor system 
assists in intracellular protein (re)folding. Using solution NMR, we obtained a 
three-dimensional structure for a 75-kDa Hsp70-DnaJ complex in the ADP state, 
loaded with substrate peptide. We establish that the J domain (residues 1-70) 
binds with its positively charged helix II to a negatively charged loop in the 
Hsp70 nucleotide-binding domain. The complex shows an unusual "tethered" binding 
mode which is stoichiometric and saturable, but which has a dynamic interface. 
The complex represents part of a triple complex of Hsp70 and DnaJ both bound to 
substrate protein. Mutagenesis data indicate that the interface is also of 
relevance for the interaction of Hsp70 and DnaJ in the ATP state. The solution 
complex is completely different from a crystal structure of a disulfide-linked 
complex of homologous proteins [Jiang, et al. (2007) Mol Cell 28:422-433].
