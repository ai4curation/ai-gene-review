BRCA1 encodes a familial breast cancer suppressor that has a critical role in 
cellular responses to DNA damage. Mouse cells deficient for Brca1 show genetic 
instability, defective G2-M checkpoint control and reduced homologous 
recombination. BRCA1 also directly interacts with proteins of the DNA repair 
machinery and regulates expression of both the p21 and GADD45 genes. However, it 
remains unclear how DNA damage signals are transmitted to modulate the repair 
function of BRCA1. Here we show that the BRCA1-associated protein CtIP becomes 
hyperphosphorylated and dissociated from BRCA1 upon ionizing radiation. This 
phosphorylation event requires the protein kinase (ATM) that is mutated in the 
disease ataxia telangiectasia. ATM phosphorylates CtIP at serine residues 664 
and 745, and mutation of these sites to alanine abrogates the dissociation of 
BRCA1 from CtIP, resulting in persistent repression of BRCA1-dependent induction 
of GADD45 upon ionizing radiation. We conclude that ATM, by phosphorylating CtIP 
upon ionizing radiation, may modulate BRCA1-mediated regulation of the DNA 
damage-response GADD45 gene, thus providing a potential link between ATM 
deficiency and breast cancer.
