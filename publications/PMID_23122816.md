We conducted a high throughput screening for glyoxalase I (GLO1) inhibitors and 
identified 4,6-diphenyl-N-hydroxypyridone as a lead compound. Using a binding 
model of the lead and public X-ray coordinates of GLO1 enzymes complexed with 
glutathione analogues, we designed 4-(7-azaindole)-substituted 
6-phenyl-N-hydroxypyridones. 7-Azaindole's 7-nitrogen was expected to interact 
with a water network, resulting in an interaction with the protein. We validated 
this inhibitor design by comparing its structure-activity relationship (SAR) 
with that of corresponding indole derivatives, by analyzing the binding mode 
with X-ray crystallography and by evaluating its thermodynamic binding 
parameters.
