Mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mthsp70) functions as a mitochondrial 
import motor and is essential in mitochondrial biogenesis and energy generation 
in eukaryotic cells. HSP-6 (hsp70F) is a nematode orthologue of mthsp70. 
Knockdown of HSP-6 by RNA interference in young adult nematodes caused a 
reduction in the levels of ATP-2, HSP-60 and CLK-1, leading to abnormal 
mitochondrial morphology and lower ATP levels. As a result, RNA 
interference-treated worms had lower motility, defects in oogenesis, earlier 
accumulation of autofluorescent material, and a shorter life span. These are the 
major phenotypes observed during the aging of worms, suggesting that the 
reduction of HSP-6 causes early aging or progeria-like phenotypes. The amount of 
HSP-6 became dramatically reduced at the expected mean life span in not only 
wild-type but also in long and short life span mutant worms (wild-type, daf-2, 
and daf-16). Mitochondrial HSP-60 and ATP-2 were also reduced following the 
reduction of HSP-6 during aging. These results suggest that the reduction of 
HSP-6 causes defects in mitochondrial function at the final stage of aging, 
leading to mortality.
