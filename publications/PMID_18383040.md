IL-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory molecule, which regulates TNF-alpha at 
multiple levels. We investigated whether IL-10 also modulated the activity of 
the TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE). Using an ex vivo fluorogenic assay we 
observed that LPS rapidly induced TACE activity in monocytes coinciding with 
release of soluble TNF-alpha. In the presence of IL-10, TNF-alpha production and 
activation of surface TACE was significantly inhibited. Paradoxically, both LPS 
with or without IL-10 led to accumulation of surface TACE (albeit catalytically 
inactive) over a 24 h period. We investigated whether this was mediated through 
induction of endogenous tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3). We found 
that the inhibition of TACE activity at 2 h by IL-10 was not TIMP-3 dependent 
but that the late accumulation of surface TACE was prevented with TIMP-3 
antibodies. Furthermore, induction of endogenous TIMP-3 was observed by western 
blotting in both LPS- and in LPS with IL-10-treated monocytes from 6 to 8 h of 
culture. These results indicate that IL-10 further regulates TNF-alpha by 
modulating TACE activation at early time points and by contributing to the 
induction of TIMP-3, the natural inhibitor of active TACE, at later time points. 
These observations add to our understanding of inflammation and the importance 
of homeostatic regulators of these events.
