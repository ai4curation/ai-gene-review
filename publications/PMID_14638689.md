Although calmodulin is known to be a component of the Hsp70/Hsp90 multichaperone 
complex, the functional role of the protein remains uncertain. In this study, we 
have identified S100A1, but not calmodulin or other S100 proteins, as a potent 
molecular chaperone and a new member of the multichaperone complex. Glutathione 
S-transferase pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated 
the formation of stable complexes between S100A1 and Hsp90, Hsp70, FKBP52, and 
CyP40 both in vitro and in mammalian cells. S100A1 potently protected citrate 
synthase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and rhodanese from 
heat-induced aggregation and suppressed the aggregation of chemically denatured 
rhodanese and citrate synthase during the refolding pathway. In addition, S100A1 
suppressed the heat-induced inactivation of citrate synthase activity, similar 
to that for Hsp90 and p23. The chaperone activity of S100A1 was antagonized by 
calmodulin antagonists, such as fluphenazine and prenylamine, that is, indeed an 
intrinsic function of the protein. The overexpression of S100A1 in COS-7 cells 
protected transiently expressed firefly luciferase and Escherichia coli 
beta-galactosidase from inactivation during heat shock. The results demonstrate 
a novel physiological function for S100A1 and bring us closer to a comprehensive 
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the Hsp70/Hsp90 multichaperone 
complex.
