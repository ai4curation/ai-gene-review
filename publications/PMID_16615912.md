Heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) plays an essential role in both the assembly of 
higher-order chromatin structure and epigenetic inheritance. The C-terminal 
chromo shadow domain (CSD) of HP1 is responsible for homodimerization and 
interaction with a number of chromatin-associated nonhistone proteins, including 
EMSY, which is a BRCA2-interacting protein that has been implicated in the 
development of breast and ovarian cancer. We have determined the crystal 
structure of the HP1beta CSD in complex with the N-terminal domain of EMSY at 
1.8 A resolution. Surprisingly, the structure reveals that EMSY is bound by two 
HP1 CSD homodimers, and the binding sequences differ from the consensus HP1 
binding motif PXVXL. This structural information expands our understanding of 
HP1 binding specificity and provides insights into interactions between HP1 
homodimers that are likely to be important for heterochromatin formation.
