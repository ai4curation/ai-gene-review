Insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) is an insulin superfamily peptide hormone, 
primarily expressed in the testes and playing a key role in the fetus testes 
descent and suppression of male germ cell apoptosis. Insulin-degrading enzyme 
(IDE) is a zinc-metalloprotease, responsible for in vivo degradation of insulin, 
Abeta, and other peptide hormones. IDE has high expression level in the testes, 
implying it might be involved in INSL3 turnover in vivo. In present work, we 
studied in vitro degradation of INSL3 by IDE. Recombinant human IDE degraded 
human INSL3, but its degradation rate for INSL3 is more than a magnitude lower 
than that for insulin. However, IDE bound INSL3 and insulin with almost same 
affinity. IDE cleaved the peptide bond between B26R and B27W of INSL3, and 
released a pentapeptide, WSTEA, from the C-terminal of B-chain. Our present work 
suggested that IDE might play a role in INSL3 degradation in vivo.
