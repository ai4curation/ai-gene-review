Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are neurodegenerative storage diseases 
characterized by mental retardation, visual failure, and brain atrophy as well 
as accumulation of storage material in multiple cell types. The diseases are 
caused by mutations in the ubiquitously expressed genes, of which six are known. 
Herein, we report that three NCL disease forms with similar tissue pathology are 
connected at the molecular level: CLN5 polypeptides directly interact with the 
CLN2 and CLN3 proteins based on coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro binding 
assays. Furthermore, disease mutations in CLN5 abolished interaction with CLN2, 
while not affecting association with CLN3. The molecular characterization of 
CLN5 revealed that it was synthesized as four precursor forms, due to usage of 
alternative initiator methionines in translation. All forms were targeted to 
lysosomes and the longest form, translated from the first potential methionine, 
was associated with membranes. Interactions between CLN polypeptides were shown 
to occur with this longest, membrane-bound form of CLN5. Both intracellular 
targeting and posttranslational glycosylation of the polypeptides carrying human 
disease mutations were similar to wild-type CLN5.
