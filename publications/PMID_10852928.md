Mutations in residues in the type 3 calcium-binding repeats and COOH-terminal 
globular region of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) lead to two 
skeletal dysplasias, pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. It 
has been hypothesized that these mutations cause COMP to misfold and to be 
retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, this hypothesis is not supported 
by previous reports that COMP, when purified in the presence of EDTA, shows no 
obvious difference in electron microscopic appearance in the presence or absence 
of calcium ions. Since this discrepancy may be due to the removal of calcium 
during purification, we have expressed wild-type COMP and the most common mutant 
form found in pseudoachondroplasia, MUT3, using a mammalian expression system 
and have purified both proteins in the presence of calcium. Both proteins are 
expressed as pentamers. Direct calcium binding experiments demonstrate that 
wild-type COMP, when purified in the presence of calcium, is a calcium-binding 
protein. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy and limited trypsin digestion at 
various calcium concentrations show that there are conformational changes 
associated with calcium binding to COMP. Whereas COMP exists in a more compact 
conformation in the presence of calcium, it shows a more extended conformation 
when calcium is removed. MUT3, with a single aspartic acid deletion in the type 
3 repeats, binds less calcium and presents an intermediate conformation between 
the calcium-replete and calcium-depleted forms of COMP. In conclusion, we show 
that a single mutation in the type 3 repeats of COMP causes the mutant protein 
to misfold. Our data demonstrate the importance of calcium binding to the 
structure of COMP and provide a plausible explanation for the observation that 
mutations in the type 3 repeats and COOH-terminal globular region lead to 
pseudoachondroplasia.
