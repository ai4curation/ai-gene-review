Omi/HtrA2 is a nuclear encoded mitochondrial serine protease with dual and 
opposite functions that depend entirely on its subcellular localization. During 
apoptosis, Omi/HtrA2 is released into the cytoplasm where it participates in 
cell death. While confined in the inter-membrane space of the mitochondria, 
Omi/HtrA2 has a pro-survival function that may involve the regulation of protein 
quality control (PQC) and mitochondrial homeostasis. Loss of Omi/HtrA2's 
protease activity causes the neuromuscular disorder of the mnd2 (motor neuron 
degeneration 2) mutant mice. These mice develop multiple defects including 
neurodegeneration with parkinsonian features. Loss of Omi/HtrA2 in non-neuronal 
tissues has also been shown to cause premature aging. The normal function of 
Omi/HtrA2 in the mitochondria and how its deregulation causes neurodegeneration 
or premature aging are unknown. Here we report that the mitochondrial Mulan E3 
ubiquitin ligase is a specific substrate of Omi/HtrA2. During exposure to 
H(2)O(2), Omi/HtrA2 degrades Mulan, and this regulation is lost in cells that 
carry the inactive protease. Furthermore, we show accumulation of Mulan protein 
in various tissues of mnd2 mice as well as in Omi/HtrA2(-/-) mouse embryonic 
fibroblasts (MEFs). This causes a significant decrease of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) 
protein, and increased mitophagy. Our work describes a new stress-signaling 
pathway that is initiated in the mitochondria and involves the regulation of 
Mulan by Omi/HtrA2 protease. Deregulation of this pathway, as it occurs in mnd2 
mutant mice, causes mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy, and could be 
responsible for the motor neuron disease and the premature aging phenotype 
observed in these animals.
