Altered T cell function in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is determined by 
various molecular and cellular abnormalities, including increased IL-17 
production. Recent evidence suggests a crucial role for signaling lymphocyte 
activation molecules (SLAMs) in the expression of autoimmunity. In this study, 
we demonstrate that SLAMF3 and SLAMF6 expression is increased on the surface of 
SLE T cells compared with normal cells. SLAM coengagement with CD3 under Th17 
polarizing conditions results in increased IL-17 production. SLAMF3 and SLAMF6 T 
cell surface expression and IL-17 levels significantly correlate with disease 
activity in SLE patients. Both naive and memory CD4(+) T cells produce more 
IL-17 in response to SLAM costimulation as compared with CD28 costimulation. In 
naive CD4(+) cells, IL-17 production after CD28 costimulation peaks on day 3, 
whereas costimulation with anti-SLAMF3 and anti-SLAMF6 Abs results in a 
prolonged and yet increasing production during 6 d. Unlike costimulation with 
anti-CD28, SLAM costimulation requires the presence of the adaptor molecule 
SLAM-associated protein. Thus, engagement of SLAMF3 and SLAMF6 along with 
Ag-mediated CD3/TCR stimulation represents an important source of IL-17 
production, and disruption of this interaction with decoy receptors or blocking 
Abs should mitigate disease expression in SLE and other autoimmune conditions.
