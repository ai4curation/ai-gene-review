Sporulation in Bacillus subtilis is a primitive differentiation process 
involving two cell types, the forespore and the mother cell. Each cell 
implements two successive transcription programmes controlled by specific sigma 
factors. We report that activity of sigma(G), the late forespore sigma factor, 
is kept in check by Gin, the product of csfB, a gene controlled by sigma(F), the 
early forespore sigma factor. Gin abolishes sigma(G) transcriptional activity 
when sigma(G) is artificially synthesized during growth, but has no effect on 
sigma(F). Gin interacts strongly with sigma(G) but not with sigma(F) in a yeast 
two-hybrid experiment. The absence of Gin allows sigma(G) to be active during 
sporulation independently of the mother-cell development to which it is normally 
coupled. Premature sigma(G) activity leads to the formation of slow-germinating 
spores, and complete deregulation of sigma(G) synthesis is lethal when combined 
with gin inactivation. Gin allows sigma(F) to delay the switch to the late 
forespore transcription programme by preventing sigma(G) to take over before the 
cell has reached a critical stage of development. A similar strategy, following 
a completely unrelated route, is used by the mother cell.
