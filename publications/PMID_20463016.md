The heavy chain (HC) subunits of the bikunin proteins are covalently attached to 
a single chondroitin sulfate (CS) chain originating from bikunin and can be 
transferred to different hyaluronan (HA) molecules by TSG-6/HC2. In the present 
study, we demonstrate that HCs transferred to HA may function as HC donors in 
subsequent transfer reactions, and we show that the CS of bikunin may serve as 
an HC acceptor, analogous to HA. Our data suggest that TSG-6/HC2 link HCs 
randomly on the CS chain of bikunin, in contrast to the ordered attachment 
observed during the biosynthesis. Moreover, the results show that the transfer 
activity is indifferent to the new HC position, and the relocated HCs are thus 
prone to further TSG-6/HC2-induced transfer reactions. The data suggest that HCs 
may be transferred directly from HA to HA without the involvement of the bikunin 
CS chain. The results demonstrate reversibility of the interactions between HCs 
and glycosaminoglycans and suggest that a dynamic shuffling of the HCs occur in 
vivo.

Abstract

The heavy chain (HC) subunits of the bikunin proteins are covalently attached to a single chondroitin sulfate (CS) chain originating from bikunin and can be transferred to different hyaluronan (HA) molecules by TSG-6/HC2. In the present study, we demonstrate that HCs transferred to HA may function as HC donors in subsequent transfer reactions, and we show that the CS of bikunin may serve as an HC acceptor, analogous to HA. Our data suggest that TSG-6/HC2 link HCs randomly on the CS chain of bikunin, in contrast to the ordered attachment observed during the biosynthesis. Moreover, the results show that the transfer activity is indifferent to the new HC position, and the relocated HCs are thus prone to further TSG-6/HC2-induced transfer reactions. The data suggest that HCs may be transferred directly from HA to HA without the involvement of the bikunin CS chain. The results demonstrate reversibility of the interactions between HCs and glycosaminoglycans and suggest that a dynamic shuffling of the HCs occur in vivo .

Introduction

The bikunin proteins are proteoglycans present in plasma ( 1 – 3 ). They are heterodimers or -trimers composed of the serine protease inhibitor bikunin (MEROPS database; MEROPS classification, LI02-001) ( 4 ) and one or two other subunits picked from a homologous group of heavy chains (HCs) 2 ( 1 , 2 ). The C termini of the HCs are covalently attached to a single chondroitin sulfate (CS) chain originating from Ser-10 of bikunin ( 5 – 7 ) forming a protein-glycosaminoglycan-protein cross-link ( 5 ). The most abundant bikunin protein in plasma is the heterotrimer inter-α-inhibitor (IαI) composed of bikunin, HC1, and HC2 ( 1 , 2 ). The two HCs are positioned in close proximity, with HC2 toward the reducing end of the CS chain ( 8 ). The CS chain is 12–18 disaccharides long, and on average, every fourth disaccharide is sulfated (C-4-S) ( 8 , 9 ). The remaining disaccharides are unsulfated (C-0-S) ( 8 , 9 ).

Tumor necrosis factor stimulated gene-6 protein (TSG-6) is an ∼35-kDa, secreted glycoprotein expressed during inflammation and inflammation-like conditions ( 10 ). The protein contains a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding Link domain ( 11 , 12 ), and TSG-6 belongs to the family of hyaladherins ( 13 ). In concert with HC2, TSG-6 have a unique catalytic activity transferring HCs from bikunin proteins to hyaluronan (HA). The reaction involves two divalent cation-dependent transesterifications and a covalent intermediate composed of TSG-6 and the HC to be transferred ( 14 – 16 ). In the first reaction, the ester bond, between the C termini of the HCs and the CS chain in IαI is cleaved, and a new transient ester bond is formed between the C termini of the HCs and Ser-28 (numbered according to the preprotein) in TSG-6 ( 15 , 17 ). In the second transesterification, the transient ester bond is cleaved and reformed between the C terminus of the HCs and HA ( 14 ). HC2 is required during both transesterification reactions, but the molecular mechanism is currently unknown ( 16 ). In addition to HA, C-0-S and the CS chain of the bikunin proteins may also function as HC acceptors during this reaction ( 15 , 16 , 18 ). The attachment of HCs to the bikunin CS chain generates new proteins designated HMW bikunin proteins ( 15 , 16 ). The physiological importance of TSG-6 and of the unique interactions between TSG-6, bikunin proteins, and HA have been underlined in many different studies ( 19 – 24 ), particularly the importance during the formation of the HA-rich extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte in mammals ( 25 – 27 ).

In the present study, we show that TSG-6/HC2 is able to continuously shuffle HCs to and from different glycosaminoglycan chains. This suggests that the initial transfer of HCs from the bikunin proteins to HA may be transient as the HC can be moved again to occupy another position on the same HA or to another GAG molecule. This may create a dynamic situation in the extracellular matrix where the HCs are moved around to facilitate the most favorable interactions.

DISCUSSION

In concert, TSG-6 and HC2 transfer HCs from bikunin proteins to HA in a reaction that involves two sequential transesterifications ( 14 – 16 ). Previously, the generated HC·HA was regarded as the final product of the reactions. In the present study, we show that the HC·HA complex also serves as HC donor in a new cycle of TSG-6/HC2-promoted HC-transfer reactions.

If an excess of HA is present during the incubation of IαI and TSG-6, neither HC1·bikunin nor HC2·bikunin is generated ( 15 ), suggesting that these products also serve as HC donors. The finding that HC2 derived from HC2·bikunin is transferred to HA supports this conclusion ( 16 ). The TSG-6/HC2 reaction thus strips the CS chain of the HCs ( 15 , 36 ). Whether the CS chain is stripped of the HCs in vivo probably depends on the ratio between bikunin proteins and HA. In the present study, we show that the generated free bikunin also serves as HC acceptor. Interestingly, free bikunin is synthesized in large amounts by hepatocytes ( 37 ). Our results suggest that bikunin proteins could be assembled extracellularly if an HC donor, bikunin, and TSG-6 co-localize at low HA concentrations.

HA is a better HC acceptor than C-0-S ( 18 ) suggesting that transfer of HCs to HA is an irreversible event. However, in the present study, we show that TSG-6/HC2 is able to remove HA-associated HCs, revealing that HC·HA complexes also serve as HC donors, analogous to IαI. Because the HC transfer between HA molecules does not require an intermediate HC·CS complex, the HC shuffling may occur independent of the bikunin proteins in vivo , after the initial transfer of HCs from bikunin proteins to HA. The findings in the present study suggest that the TSG-6/bikunin protein interaction in HA-rich extracellular matrix is dynamic. As long as the reactants co-localize, a continuous shuffling of HCs between GAGs probably takes place.

In the present study, we have analyzed the interactions between IαI, TSG-6, and HA. The results show no significant difference between the requirements for acceptor GAG and donor GAG. The TSG-6/HC2-generated HC·GAG complexes are able to function as donor HC·GAG complexes. Contrariwise, is the TSG-6/HC2-stripped CS chain from IαI able to function as an HC acceptor GAG. Taken together, the study demonstrates the reversibility of the TSG-6/HC2-mediated transfer of HCs to GAGs.
