Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is enriched in the striatal projection 
neurons (SPNs). We found that LRRK2 negatively regulates protein kinase A (PKA) 
activity in the SPNs during synaptogenesis and in response to dopamine receptor 
Drd1 activation. LRRK2 interacted with PKA regulatory subunit IIβ (PKARIIβ). A 
lack of LRRK2 promoted the synaptic translocation of PKA and increased 
PKA-mediated phosphorylation of actin-disassembling enzyme cofilin and glutamate 
receptor GluR1, resulting in abnormal synaptogenesis and transmission in the 
developing SPNs. Furthermore, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of GluR1 was also 
aberrantly enhanced in the striatum of young and aged Lrrk2(-/-) mice after 
treatment with a Drd1 agonist. Notably, a Parkinson's disease-related Lrrk2 
R1441C missense mutation that impaired the interaction of LRRK2 with PKARIIβ 
also induced excessive PKA activity in the SPNs. Our findings reveal a 
previously unknown regulatory role for LRRK2 in PKA signaling and suggest a 
pathogenic mechanism of SPN dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
