Two rounds of chromosome segregation after only a single round of DNA 
replication enable the production of haploid gametes from diploid precursors 
during meiosis. To identify genes involved in meiotic chromosome segregation, we 
developed an efficient strategy to knock out genes in the fission yeast on a 
large scale. We used this technique to delete 180 functionally uncharacterized 
genes whose expression is upregulated during meiosis. Deletion of two genes, 
sgo1 and mde2, caused massive chromosome missegregation. sgo1 is required for 
retention of centromeric sister-chromatid cohesion after anaphase I. We show 
here that mde2 is required for formation of the double-strand breaks necessary 
for meiotic recombination.
