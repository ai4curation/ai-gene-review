Expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor (p27(Kip1)) is 
frequently reduced in human tumors, often correlating with poor prognosis. 
p27(Kip1) functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor; however, the 
mechanism by which one allele of p27(Kip1) regulates oncogenic signaling in vivo 
is not well understood. We therefore investigated the mechanisms by which 
p27(Kip1) inhibits mammary tumor onset. Using the common background strain of 
FVB, p27(Kip1) heterozygosity (p27(+/-)) accelerated ErbB2-induced mammary 
tumorigenesis. We conducted microarray analyses of mammary tumors developing in 
mice with genetic haploinsufficiency for p27(Kip1) expressing a mammary-targeted 
ErbB2 oncogene. Global gene expression profiling and Western blot analysis of 
ErbB2/p27(+/-) tumors showed that the loss of p27(Kip1) induced genes promoting 
lymphangiogenesis, cellular proliferation, and collaborative oncogenic signaling 
(Wnt/beta-catenin/Tcf, Cdc25a, Smad7, and Skp2). Skp2 expression was induced by 
ErbB2 and repressed by p27(Kip1). Degradation of p27(Kip1) involves an SCF-type 
E3 ubiquitin ligase, including Skp2. The Skp2 component of the SCF(SKP2) complex 
that degrades p27(Kip1) was increased in ErbB2 tumors correlating with earlier 
tumor onset. In both murine and human ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers, 
p27(Kip1) levels correlated inversely with Skp2. p27(Kip1) haploinsufficiency 
activated Wnt/beta-catenin/hedgehog signaling. Reintroduction of p27(Kip1) 
inhibited beta-catenin induction of Tcf-responsive genes (Siamosis, c-Myc, and 
Smad7). p27(Kip1) is haploinsufficient for ErbB2 mammary tumor suppression in 
vivo and functions to repress collaborative oncogenic signals including Skp2 and 
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.
