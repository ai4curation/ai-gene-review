PDCD4 is a tumor suppressor induced by apoptotic stimuli that regulates both 
translation and transcription. Previously, we showed that overexpression of 
PDCD4 leads to decreased anchorage-independent growth in glioblastoma 
(GBM)-derived cell lines and decreased tumor growth in a GBM xenograft model. In 
inflammatory cells, PDCD4 stimulates tumor necrosis factor-induced activation of 
the transcription factor NF-κB, an oncogenic driver in many cancer sites. 
However, the effect of PDCD4 on NF-κB transcriptional activity in most cancers 
including GBM is still unknown. We studied the effect of PDCD4 on 
NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity in GBM by stably overexpressing PDCD4 
in U251 and LN229 cells. Stable PDCD4 expression inhibits NF-κB transcriptional 
activation measured by a luciferase reporter. The molecular mechanism by which 
PDCD4 inhibits NF-κB transcriptional activation does not involve inhibited 
expression of NF-κB p65 or p50 proteins. PDCD4 does not inhibit pathways 
upstream of NF-κB including the activation of IKKα and IKKβ kinases or 
degradation of IκBα, events needed for nuclear transport of p65 and p50. PDCD4 
overexpression does inhibit localization of p65 but not p50 in the nucleus. 
PDCD4 protein interacts preferentially with p65 protein as shown by 
co-immunoprecipitation and confocal imaging. PDCD4 overexpression inhibits the 
mRNA expression of two NF-κB target genes in a p65-dependent manner. These 
results suggest that PDCD4 can significantly inhibit NF-κB activity in GBM cells 
by a mechanism that involves direct or indirect protein-protein interaction 
independent of the expected mRNA-selective translational inhibition. These 
findings offer novel opportunities for NF-κB-targeted interventions to prevent 
or treat cancer.
