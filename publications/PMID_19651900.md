E3 ubiquitin ligases, which target specific molecules for proteolytic 
destruction, have emerged as key regulators of immune functions. Several E3 
ubiquitin ligases, including c-Cbl, Cbl-b, GRAIL, Itch, and Nedd4, have been 
shown to negatively regulate T-cell activation. Here, we report that the 
HECT-type E3 ligase AIP2 positively regulates T-cell activation. Ectopic 
expression of AIP2 in mouse primary T cells enhances their proliferation and 
interleukin-2 production by suppressing the apoptosis of T cells. AIP2 interacts 
with and promotes ubiquitin-mediated degradation of EGR2, a zinc finger 
transcription factor that has been found to regulate Fas ligand (FasL) 
expression during activation-induced T-cell death. Suppression of AIP2 
expression by small RNA interference upregulates EGR2, inhibits EGR2 
ubiquitination and FasL expression, and enhances the apoptosis of T cells. 
Therefore, AIP2 regulates activation-induced T-cell death by suppressing 
EGR2-mediated FasL expression via the ubiquitin pathway.
