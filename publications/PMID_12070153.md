The cytoplasmic region of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) contains 
an intrinsic tyrosine kinase (697-955) followed by a 231-residue-long 
COOH-terminal tail (C-tail), which contains multiple tyrosine residues. To 
examine the role of the EGFR C-tail in signal transducer and activator of 
transcription (STAT) activation, a series of EGFR C-tail truncations were 
constructed. Transient transfection of 293 cells with EGFR lacking the C-tail, 
i.e. Y974DeltaEGFR or Y992DeltaEGFR, led to EGF-independent or constitutive STAT 
activation, whereas EGF-dependent STAT activation was restored with truncations 
made COOH-terminal to the next tyrosine residue, i.e. EGFR-Y1045Delta. 
Transfection with the-truncated form EGFR-Y954Delta resulted in the loss of STAT 
activation, suggesting that the sequence between Tyr(974) and Tyr(954) is 
essential for STAT activation. Phosphopeptide competition analysis revealed 
multiple tyrosine residues within the C-tail that can act as the docking sites 
for both Stat1 and Stat3. A region that negatively regulated STAT activation was 
also identified, extending from Tyr(1114) to Glu(1172), consistent with the 
ability of this region to recruit a suppressor of cytokine signaling factors 
SOCS1 and SOCS3. When cotransfected with the full-length EGFR, but not 
Y992DeltaEGFR, SOCS1 or SOCS3 inhibited STAT activation by EGF in 293 cells. 
This suggests that both SOCS1 and SOCS3 can negatively regulate EGFR activation, 
presumably by inducing ubiquitination-dependent EGFR degradation upon ligand 
binding. These findings may therefore offer clues to how the EGF receptor C-tail 
regulates STAT activity.
