Neuronal specification is regulated by the activity of transcription factors 
containing the basic helix-loop-helix motif (bHLH); these regulating proteins 
include, among others, the neurogenin (Ngn) family, related to the atonal family 
of genes. Neurogenin 1 (NGN1) is a 237-residue protein that contains a bHLH 
domain and is involved in neuronal differentiation. In this work, we synthesized 
the bHLH region of NGN1 (bHLHN) comprising residues 90-150 of the full-length 
NGN1. The domain is a monomeric natively unfolded protein with a pH-dependent 
premolten globule conformation, as shown by several spectroscopic techniques 
(namely, NMR, fluorescence, FTIR, and circular dichroism). The unfolded 
character of the domain also explains, first, the impossibility of its 
overexpression in several Escherichia coli strains and, second, its insolubility 
in aqueous buffers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive 
study of the conformational preferences of a bHLH domain under different 
solution conditions. Upon binding to two DNA E-boxes, the protein forms "fuzzy" 
complexes (that is, the complexes were not fully folded). The affinities of 
bHLHN for both DNA boxes were smaller than those of other bHLH domains, which 
might explain why the protein-DNA complexes were not fully folded.
