PURPOSE: In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), high CD38 expression has 
been associated with unfavorable clinical course, advanced disease, resistance 
to therapy, shorter time to first treatment, and shorter survival. However, the 
genes associated with CLL patient subgroups with high and low CD38 expression 
and their potential role in disease progression is not known.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To identify the genes associated with the clinical 
disparity in CLL patients with high versus low CD38 expression, transcriptional 
profiles were obtained from CLL cells from 39 different patients using 
oligonucleotide microarray. Gene expression was also compared between CLL cells 
and B cells from healthy individuals.
RESULTS: Gene expression analysis identified 76 differentially expressed genes 
in CD38 high versus low groups. Out of these genes, HEM1, CTLA4, and MNDA were 
selected for further studies and their differential expression was confirmed by 
real-time PCR. HEM1 overexpression was associated with poor outcome, whereas the 
overexpression of CTLA4 and MNDA was associated with good outcome. 
Down-regulation of HEM1 expression in patient CLL cells resulted in a 
significant increase in their susceptibility to fludarabine-mediated killing. In 
addition, when gene expression patterns in CD38 high and low CLL cells were 
compared with normal B-cell profiles, ATM expression was found to be 
significantly lower in CD38 high compared with CD38 low CLL as confirmed by 
real-time reverse transcription-PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: These results identify the possible genes that may be involved in 
cell proliferation and survival and, thus, determining the clinical behavior of 
CLL patients expressing high or low CD38.
