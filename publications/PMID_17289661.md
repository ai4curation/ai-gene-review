Localized mRNAs are transported to sites of local protein synthesis in large 
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules, but their molecular composition is 
incompletely understood. Insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein 
(IMP) zip code-binding proteins participate in mRNA localization, and in motile 
cells IMP-containing granules are dispersed around the nucleus and in cellular 
protrusions. We isolated the IMP1-containing RNP granules and found that they 
represent a unique RNP entity distinct from neuronal hStaufen and/or fragile X 
mental retardation protein granules, processing bodies, and stress granules. 
Granules were 100-300 nm in diameter and consisted of IMPs, 40 S ribosomal 
subunits, shuttling heterologous nuclear RNPs, poly(A)-binding proteins, and 
mRNAs. Moreover granules contained CBP80 and factors belonging to the exon 
junction complex and lacked eIF4E, eIF4G, and 60 S ribosomal subunits, 
indicating that embodied mRNAs are not translated. Granules embodied mRNAs 
corresponding to about 3% of the human embryonic kidney 293 mRNA transcriptome. 
Messenger RNAs encoding proteins participating in the secretory pathway and 
endoplasmic reticulum-associated quality control, as well as ubiquitin-dependent 
metabolism, were enriched in the granules, reinforcing the concept of RNP 
granules as post-transcriptional operons.
