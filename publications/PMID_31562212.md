Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are strategically positioned at mucosal barrier 
surfaces where they respond quickly to infection or injury. Therefore, we 
hypothesized that ILCs are key contributors to the early immune response in the 
intestine against Listeria monocytogenes Using a modified strain of L. 
monocytogenes that mimics human gastrointestinal listeriosis in mice, we find 
ILCs to be essential for control of early replication of L. monocytogenes in the 
intestine as well as for restricted dissemination of bacteria to peripheral 
tissues. Specifically, group 1 ILCs (ILC1s) and group 3 ILCs (ILC3s) respond to 
infection with proliferation and IFN-γ and IL-22 production. Mechanistically, we 
show that the transcription factor STAT4 is required for the proliferative and 
IFN-γ effector response by ILC1s and ILC3s, and loss of STAT4 signaling in the 
innate immune compartment results in an inability to control bacterial growth 
and dissemination. Interestingly, STAT4 acts acutely as a transcription factor 
to promote IFN-γ production. Together, these data illustrate a critical role for 
ILCs in the early responses to gastrointestinal infection with L. monocytogenes 
and identify STAT4 as a central modulator of ILC-mediated protection.
