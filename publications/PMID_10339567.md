Cas ligand with multiple Src homology (SH) 3 domains (CMS) is an ubiquitously 
expressed signal transduction molecule that interacts with the focal adhesion 
protein p130(Cas). CMS contains three SH3 in its NH2 terminus and proline-rich 
sequences in its center region. The latter sequences mediate the binding to the 
SH3 domains of p130(Cas), Src-family kinases, p85 subunit of 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Grb2. The COOH-terminal region contains 
putative actin binding sites and a coiled-coil domain that mediates 
homodimerization of CMS. CMS is a cytoplasmic protein that colocalizes with 
F-actin and p130(Cas) to membrane ruffles and leading edges of cells. Ectopic 
expression of CMS in COS-7 cells resulted in alteration in arrangement of the 
actin cytoskeleton. We observed a diffuse distribution of actin in small dots 
and less actin fiber formation. Altogether, these features suggest that CMS 
functions as a scaffolding molecule with a specialized role in regulation of the 
actin cytoskeleton.
