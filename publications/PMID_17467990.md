The GINS complex is the most recently identified component of the eukaryotic DNA 
replication machinery and is required both for the initiation of chromosome 
replication and also for the normal progression of DNA replication forks. 
Several recent studies suggest that GINS associates at replication forks with 
the MCM helicase that is responsible for unwinding the parental DNA duplex. 
Archaea also have an equivalent GINS complex that can interact with MCM and 
other replisome components. It seems likely that GINS couples MCM to other key 
proteins at forks, and we discuss here the current literature regarding this 
important late-comer to the DNA replication field.
