Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene expression is modulated by both 
viral and cellular factors. A regulatory element in the HIV-1 long terminal 
repeat known as TAR, which extends from nucleotides -18 to +80, is critical for 
the activation of gene expression by the transactivator protein, Tat. RNA 
transcribed from TAR forms a stable stem-loop structure which serves as the 
binding site for both Tat and cellular factors. Although TAR RNA is critical for 
Tat activation, the role that TAR DNA plays in regulating HIV-1 gene expression 
is not clear. Several studies have demonstrated that TAR DNA can bind cellular 
proteins, such as UBP-1/LBP-1, which repress HIV-1 gene expression and other 
factors which are involved in the generation of short, nonprocessive 
transcripts. In an attempt to characterize additional cellular factors that bind 
to TAR DNA, a lambda gt11 expression cloning strategy involving the use of a 
portion of TAR DNA extending from -18 to +28 to probe a HeLa cDNA library was 
used. We identified a cDNA, designated TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), which 
encodes a cellular factor of 43 kDa that binds specifically to pyrimidine-rich 
motifs in TAR. Antibody to TDP-43 was used in gel retardation assays to 
demonstrate that endogenous TDP-43, present in HeLa nuclear extract, also bound 
to TAR DNA. Although TDP-43 bound strongly to double-stranded TAR DNA via its 
ribonucleoprotein protein-binding motifs, it did not bind to TAR RNA extending 
from +1 to +80. To determine the function of TDP-43 in regulating HIV-1 gene 
expression, in vitro transcription analysis was performed. TDP-43 repressed in 
vitro transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat in both the presence and 
absence of Tat, but it did not repress transcription from other promoters such 
as the adenovirus major late promoter. In addition, transfection of a vector 
which expressed TDP-43 resulted in the repression of gene expression from an 
HIV-1 provirus. These results indicate that TDP-43 is capable of modulating both 
in vitro and in vivo HIV-1 gene expression by either altering or blocking the 
assembly of transcription complexes that are capable of responding to Tat.
