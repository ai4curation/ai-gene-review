MADS-box transcription factors are key regulators of several plant development 
processes. Analysis of the complete Arabidopsis genome sequence revealed 107 
genes encoding MADS-box proteins, of which 84% are of unknown function. Here, we 
provide a complete overview of this family, describing the gene structure, gene 
expression, genome localization, protein motif organization, and phylogenetic 
relationship of each member. We have divided this transcription factor family 
into five groups (named MIKC, Malpha, Mbeta, Mgamma, and Mdelta) based on the 
phylogenetic relationships of the conserved MADS-box domain. This study provides 
a solid base for functional genomics studies into this important family of plant 
regulatory genes, including the poorly characterized group of M-type MADS-box 
proteins. MADS-box genes also constitute an excellent system with which to study 
the evolution of complex gene families in higher plants.
