Identification of complex molecular networks underlying common human phenotypes 
is a major challenge of modern genetics. In this study, we develop a method for 
network-based analysis of genetic associations (NETBAG). We use NETBAG to 
identify a large biological network of genes affected by rare de novo CNVs in 
autism. The genes forming the network are primarily related to synapse 
development, axon targeting, and neuron motility. The identified network is 
strongly related to genes previously implicated in autism and intellectual 
disability phenotypes. Our results are also consistent with the hypothesis that 
significantly stronger functional perturbations are required to trigger the 
autistic phenotype in females compared to males. Overall, the presented analysis 
of de novo variants supports the hypothesis that perturbed synaptogenesis is at 
the heart of autism. More generally, our study provides proof of the principle 
that networks underlying complex human phenotypes can be identified by a 
network-based functional analysis of rare genetic variants.
