We have used mitotic spindle forces to examine the role of Sir2 and Ku in 
chromatin compaction. Escherichia coli lac operator DNA was placed between two 
centromeres on a conditional dicentric chromosome in budding yeast cells and 
made visible by expression of a lac repressor-green fluorescent fusion protein. 
Centromeres on the same chromatid of a dicentric chromosome attach to opposite 
poles approximately 50% of the time, resulting in chromosome bridges during 
anaphase. In cells deleted for yKU70, yKU80, or SIR2, a 10-kb region of the 
dicentric chromosome stretched along the spindle axis to a length of 6 microm 
during anaphase. On spindle disassembly, stretched chromatin recoiled to the bud 
neck and was partitioned to mother and daughter cells after cytokinesis and cell 
separation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that Sir2 localizes to the 
lacO region in response to activation of the dicentric chromosome. These 
findings indicate that Ku and Sir proteins are required for proper chromatin 
compaction within regions of a chromosome experiencing tension or DNA damage. 
The association of Sir2 with the affected region suggests a direct role in this 
process, which may include the formation of heterochromatic DNA.
