Upon stimulation by the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), Smad2 and 
Smad3 are phosphorylated at their C termini and assemble into stable heteromeric 
complexes with Smad4. These complexes are the functional entities that 
translocate into the nucleus and regulate the expression of TGF-beta target 
genes. Here we report that the TGF-beta-activated phospho-Smad3/Smad4 complex 
utilizes an importin-independent mechanism for nuclear import and engages 
different nucleoporins for nuclear import compared with the monomeric Smad4. 
Within the heteromeric complex, phospho-Smad3 appears to dominate over Smad4 in 
the nuclear import process and guides the complex to its nuclear destination. We 
also demonstrate that the binding of phospho-Smad3 to Smad4 prevents Smad4 from 
interacting with the nuclear export receptor chromosome region maintenance 1. In 
this way, TGF-beta signaling suppresses nuclear export of Smad4 by chromosome 
region maintenance 1 and thereby targets Smad4 into the nucleus. Indeed 
tumorigenic mutations in Smad4 that affect its interaction with Smad2 or Smad3 
impair nuclear accumulation of Smad4 in response to TGF-beta.
