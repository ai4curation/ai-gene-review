To identify Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes important for nucleocytoplasmic 
export of messenger RNA, we screened mutant strains to identify those in which 
poly(A)+ RNA accumulated in nuclei under nonpermissive conditions. We describe 
the identification of DBP5 as the gene defective in the strain carrying the 
rat8-1 allele (RAT = ribonucleic acid trafficking). Dbp5p/Rat8p, a previously 
uncharacterized member of the DEAD-box family of proteins, is closely related to 
eukaryotic initiation factor 4A(eIF4A) an RNA helicase essential for protein 
synthesis initiation. Analysis of protein databases suggests most eukaryotic 
genomes encode a DEAD-box protein that is probably a homolog of yeast 
Dbp5p/Rat8p. Temperature-sensitive alleles of DBP5/RAT8 were prepared. In rat8 
mutant strains, cells displayed rapid, synchronous accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA 
in nuclei when shifted to the non-permissive temperature. Dbp5p/Rat8p is located 
within the cytoplasm and concentrated in the perinuclear region. Analysis of the 
distribution of Dbp5p/Rat8p in yeast strains where nuclear pore complexes are 
tightly clustered indicated that a fraction of this protein associates with 
nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The strong mutant phenotype, association of the 
protein with NPCs and genetic interaction with factors involved in RNA export 
provide strong evidence that Dbp5p/Rat8p plays a direct role in RNA export.
