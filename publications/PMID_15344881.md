The F11 receptor (F11R) (a.k.a. Junctional Adhesion Molecule, JAM) was first 
identified in human platelets as a 32/35 kDa protein duplex that serves as 
receptor for a functional monoclonal antibody that activates platelets. We have 
sequenced and cloned the F11R and determined that it is a member of the 
immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. The signaling 
pathways involved in F11R-induced platelet activation were examined in this 
investigation. The binding of M.Ab.F11 to the platelet F11R resulted in granule 
secretion and aggregation. These processes were found to be dependent on the 
crosslinking of F11R with the Fc gammaRII by M.Ab.F11. This crosslinking induced 
actin filament assembly with the conversion of discoidal platelets to activated 
shapes, leading to the formation of platelet aggregates. We demonstrate that 
platelet secretion and aggregation through the F11R involves actin filament 
assembly that is dependent on phosphoinositide-3 kinase activation, and 
inhibitable by wortmannin. Furthermore, such activation results in an increase 
in the level of free intracellular calcium, phosphorylation of the 32 and 35 kDa 
forms of the F11R, F11R dimerization coincident with a decrease in monomeric 
F11R, and association of the F11R with the integrin GPIIIa and with CD9. On the 
other hand, F11R-mediated events resulting from the binding of platelets to an 
immobilized surface of M.Ab.F11 lead to platelet adhesion and spreading through 
the development of filopodia and lammelipodia. These adhesive processes are 
induced directly by interaction of M.Ab.F11 with the platelet F11R and are not 
dependent on the Fc gammaRII. We also report here that the stimulation of the 
F11R in the presence of nonaggregating (subthreshold) concentrations of the 
physiological agonists thrombin and collagen, results in supersensitivity of 
platelets to natural agonists by a F11R-mediated process independent of the Fc 
gammaRII. The delineation of the two separate F11R-mediated pathways is 
anticipated to reveal significant information on the role of this cell adhesion 
molecule in platelet adhesion, aggregation and secretion, and F11R-dependent 
potentiation of agonist-induced platelet aggregation. The participation of F11R 
in the formation and growth of platelet aggregates and plaques in cardiovascular 
disorders, resulting in enhanced platelet adhesiveness and hyperaggregability, 
may serve in the generation of novel therapies in the treatment of inflammatory 
thrombosis, heart attack and stroke, and other cardiovascular disorders.
