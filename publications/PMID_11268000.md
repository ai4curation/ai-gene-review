Ebp1, an ErbB-3 binding protein, inhibits the proliferation and induces the 
differentiation of human breast cancer cells. The mechanisms of these effects 
are unknown. Rb, the product of the retinoblastoma gene, is an important 
modulator of cell cycle progression and cellular differentiation. We report that 
Rb is a binding target for Ebp1. Ebp1 was localized to both the nucleus and the 
cytoplasm of logarithmically growing AU565 breast cancer cells and HeLa cells as 
determined by confocal immunofluorescent microscopy. Ebp1 was present in Rb 
immunoprecipitates derived from AU565 breast cancer cells. GST-Rb also bound 
endogenous Ebp1. Using GST-Ebp1 constructs, we determined that the 72 C-terminal 
amino acids of Ebp1 were sufficient to bind Rb. Dephosphorylation of Ebp1 
enhanced the interaction of Ebp1 with Rb. The overexpression of Ebp1 in MCF-7 
and AU565 (Rb(+)) cells inhibited the activity of the E2F1 regulated cyclin-E 
promoter. Ebp1 bound E2F1 indirectly via Rb in lysates of MCF-7 cells. The 
interaction of Ebp1 with Rb may prove to be an important mechanism of Ebp1 
induced changes in cell proliferation and differentiation.
