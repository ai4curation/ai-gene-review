BACKGROUND: Current bariatric surgery models primarily utilize mice with 
obesity, overlooking those with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). These models have 
limitations in replicating clinical procedures accurately and achieving broad 
applicability. This study aimed to develop novel mouse models of Roux-en-Y 
gastric bypass (RYGB) and one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) surgeries 
specifically designed for T2DM research, utilizing simplified surgical 
techniques closely resembling clinical procedures.
METHODS: Eight-week-old C57/Bl6 mice, except for the Blank-Control group, were 
induced with T2DM by combining a high-fat diet and streptozotocin injection. 
RYGB involved creating a 10% gastric pouch, a 4-cm biliopancreatic limb (BL), 
and a 4-cm Roux limb (RL). Similarly, OAGB maintained a 10% gastric pouch and a 
4-cm BL. To assess the efficacy of these models, we measured the body weight and 
fasting blood glucose (FBG) and conducted intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test 
(IPGTT), insulin tolerance test (ITT), and liver B-ultrasound, as well as a 
histopathological analysis of multiple organs 12 weeks post-operation.
RESULTS: The survival rates in the Blank-Control, T2DM-Sham, T2DM-RYGB, and 
T2DM-OAGB groups were 100% (6/6), 100% (6/6), 85.7% (6/7), and 100% (6/6), 
respectively. Both RYGB and OAGB surgeries similarly led to sustained weight 
loss, reduced the FBG levels, improved the IPGTT and ITT results, and alleviated 
the histopathological manifestations in multiple organs.
CONCLUSION: The innovative mouse models of RYGB and OAGB surgeries effectively 
improve T2DM. Both surgeries demonstrate comparable efficacy in ameliorating 
T2DM, even when utilizing a gastric pouch of the same size and the same length 
of BL in OAGB.
