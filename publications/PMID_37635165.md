BACKGROUND: Current bariatric surgery models primarily utilize mice with 
obesity, overlooking those with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). These models have 
limitations in replicating clinical procedures accurately and achieving broad 
applicability. This study aimed to develop novel mouse models of Roux-en-Y 
gastric bypass (RYGB) and one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) surgeries 
specifically designed for T2DM research, utilizing simplified surgical 
techniques closely resembling clinical procedures.
METHODS: Eight-week-old C57/Bl6 mice, except for the Blank-Control group, were 
induced with T2DM by combining a high-fat diet and streptozotocin injection. 
RYGB involved creating a 10% gastric pouch, a 4-cm biliopancreatic limb (BL), 
and a 4-cm Roux limb (RL). Similarly, OAGB maintained a 10% gastric pouch and a 
4-cm BL. To assess the efficacy of these models, we measured the body weight and 
fasting blood glucose (FBG) and conducted intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test 
(IPGTT), insulin tolerance test (ITT), and liver B-ultrasound, as well as a 
histopathological analysis of multiple organs 12 weeks post-operation.
RESULTS: The survival rates in the Blank-Control, T2DM-Sham, T2DM-RYGB, and 
T2DM-OAGB groups were 100% (6/6), 100% (6/6), 85.7% (6/7), and 100% (6/6), 
respectively. Both RYGB and OAGB surgeries similarly led to sustained weight 
loss, reduced the FBG levels, improved the IPGTT and ITT results, and alleviated 
the histopathological manifestations in multiple organs.
CONCLUSION: The innovative mouse models of RYGB and OAGB surgeries effectively 
improve T2DM. Both surgeries demonstrate comparable efficacy in ameliorating 
T2DM, even when utilizing a gastric pouch of the same size and the same length 
of BL in OAGB.

One-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) has gained importance as a simple, safe, and effective operation to treat morbid obesity. We previously found that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery with a long compared with a short biliopancreatic limb (BPL) leads to improved weight loss and glucose tolerance in obese mice. However, it is not known whether a long BPL in OAGB surgery also results in beneficial metabolic outcomes. Five-week-old male C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks underwent OAGB surgery with defined BPL lengths (5.5 cm distally of the duodenojejunal junction for short and 9.5 cm for long BPL), or sham surgery combined with caloric restriction. Weight loss, glucose tolerance, obesity-related comorbidities, endocrine effects, gut microbiota, and bile acids were assessed. Total weight loss was independent of the length of the BPL after OAGB surgery. However, a long BPL was associated with lower glucose-stimulated insulin on day 14, and an improved glucose tolerance on day 35 after surgery. Moreover, a long BPL resulted in reduced total cholesterol, while there were no differences in the resolution of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and adipose tissue inflammation. Tendencies of an attenuated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and aldosterone were present in the long BPL group. With both the short and long BPL, we found an increase in primary conjugated bile acids (pronounced in long BPL) along with a loss in bacterial Desulfovibrionaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae and simultaneous increase in Akkermansiaceae, Sutterellaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae. In summary, OAGB surgery with a long compared with a short BPL led to similar weight loss, but improved glucose metabolism, lipid, and endocrine outcomes in obese mice, potentially mediated through changes in gut microbiota and related bile acids. Tailoring the BPL length in humans might help to optimize metabolic outcomes after bariatric surgery.

NEW & NOTEWORTHY Weight loss following OAGB surgery in obese mice was not influenced by BPL length, but a longer BPL was associated with improved metabolic outcomes, including glucose and lipid homeostasis. These changes could be mediated by bile acids upon altered gut microbiota. Further validation of these findings is required through a randomized human study.
