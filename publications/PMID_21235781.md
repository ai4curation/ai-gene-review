BACKGROUND: Exosomes are 30-100 nm membrane vesicles of endocytic origin 
produced by numerous cells. They can mediate diverse biological functions, 
including antigen presentation. Exosomes have recently been shown to contain 
functional RNA, which can be delivered to other cells. Exosomes may thus mediate 
biological functions either by surface-to-surface interactions with cells, or by 
the delivery of functional RNA to cells. Our aim was therefore to determine the 
presence of RNA in exosomes from human saliva, plasma and breast milk and 
whether these exosomes can be taken up by macrophages.
METHOD: Exosomes were purified from human saliva, plasma and breast milk using 
ultracentrifugation and filtration steps. Exosomes were detected by electron 
microscopy and examined by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed by 
capturing the exosomes on anti-MHC class II coated beads, and further stain with 
anti-CD9, anti-CD63 or anti-CD81. Breast milk exosomes were further analysed for 
the presence of Hsc70, CD81 and calnexin by Western blot. Total RNA was detected 
with a Bioanalyzer and mRNA was identified by the synthesis of cDNA using an 
oligo (dT) primer and analysed with a Bioanalyzer. The uptake of PKH67-labelled 
saliva and breast milk exosomes by macrophages was examined by measuring 
fluorescence using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: RNA was detected in exosomes from all three body fluids. A portion of 
the detected RNA in plasma exosomes was characterised as mRNA. Our result 
extends the characterisation of exosomes in healthy humans and confirms the 
presence of RNA in human saliva and plasma exosomes and reports for the first 
time the presence of RNA in breast milk exosomes. Our results also show that the 
saliva and breast milk exosomes can be taken up by human macrophages.
CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes in saliva, plasma and breast milk all contain RNA, 
confirming previous findings that exosomes from several sources contain RNA. 
Furthermore, exosomes are readily taken up by macrophages, supporting the notion 
that exosomal RNA can be shuttled between cells.
