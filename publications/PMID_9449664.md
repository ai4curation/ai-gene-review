Neural crest cells arise in the dorsal aspect of the neural tube and migrate 
extensively to differentiate into a variety of neural and non-neural tissues. 
While interactions between neural crest cells and their local environments are 
required for the proper development of these tissues, little information is 
available about the molecular nature of the cell-cell interactions in cephalic 
neural crest development. Here we demonstrate that mice deficient for one type 
of endothelin receptor, ETA, mimic the human conditions collectively termed 
CATCH 22 or velocardiofacial syndrome, which include severe craniofacial 
deformities and defects in the cardiovascular outflow tract. We show that ETA 
receptor mRNA is expressed by the neural crest-derived ectomesenchymal cells of 
pharyngeal arches and cardiac outflow tissues, whereas ET-1 ligand mRNA is 
expressed by arch epithelium, paraxial mesoderm-derived arch core and the arch 
vessel endothelium. This suggests that paracrine interaction between neural 
crest-derived cells and both ectoderm and mesoderm is essential in forming the 
skeleton and connective tissue of the head. Further, we find that pharyngeal 
arch expression of goosecoid is absent in ETA receptor-deficient mice, placing 
the transcription factor as one of the possible downstream signals triggered by 
activation of the ETA receptor. These observations define a novel genetic 
pathway for inductive communication between cephalic neural crest cells and 
their environmental counterparts.
