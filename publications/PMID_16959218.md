Histone H3 methyltransferases are involved in the epigenetic control of 
transcription and heterochromatin maintenance. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
deletion of a histone H3 methyltransferase SET1 leads to the induction of a 
subset of stress responsive genes in a Rad53 dependent manner. This type of 
induction was observed only in the absence of SET1 and not in the absence of 
other histone methyltransferases, SET2 or DOT1. We show that the increased 
expression of the stress responsive genes results from a lack of histone H3 
lysine (K) 4 methylation. The loss of mono-methylation on H3 K4 is necessary to 
increase the expression of the stress responsive genes, while the loss of di- or 
tri-methylation induced by deletion of either RRM domain of Set1 or the upstream 
effector molecules hardly affected their expression. These results suggest that 
mono- and multiple methylation of H3 K4 have different roles. The 
mono-methylation of H3 K4 might be required for the global integrity of 
chromatin structure, which is normally monitored by the Rad53 dependent 
chromatin surveillance system.
