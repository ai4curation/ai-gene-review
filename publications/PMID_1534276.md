Genetic evidence indicates central roles for Hsp70 chaperones in the regulation 
of heat shock gene expression. This regulatory function has been postulated for 
Escherichia coli to rely on the direct association of DnaK (Hsp70) with the heat 
shock transcription factor sigma 32. This report presents evidence for the 
physical association of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE chaperones with sigma 32 in vivo. 
Surprisingly, an interaction of DnaJ with sigma 32 exists that is 
distinguishable from an interaction of DnaK and GrpE with sigma 32: addition of 
ATP disrupts the association of DnaK and GrpE with sigma 32, but not the 
association of DnaJ with sigma 32. Furthermore, DnaJ-sigma 32 and DnaK-sigma 32 
associations occur independent of DnaK and DnaJ, respectively. These results 
suggest distinct regulatory functions of DnaJ and DnaK/GrpE.
