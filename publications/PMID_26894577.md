Mutations in the gene coding for the multi-domain protein leucine-rich repeat 
kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the leading cause of genetically inherited Parkinson's 
disease (PD). Two of the common found mutations are the R1441C and G2019S. In 
this study we identified protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as an interacting partner 
of LRRK2. We were able to demonstrate that the Ras of complex protein (ROC) 
domain is sufficient to interact with the three subunits of PP2A in human 
neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and in HeLa cells. The alpha subunit of PP2A is 
interacting with LRRK2 in the perinuclear region of HeLa cells. Silencing the 
catalytic subunit of PP2A by shRNA aggravated cellular degeneration induced by 
the pathogenic R1441C-LRRK2 mutant expressed in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. A 
similar enhancement of apoptotic nuclei was observed by downregulation of the 
catalytic subunit of PP2A in cultured cortical cells derived from neurons 
overexpressing the pathogenic mutant G2019S-LRRK2. Conversely, pharmacological 
activation of PP2A by sodium selenate showed a partial neuroprotection from 
R1441C-LRRK2-induced cellular degeneration. All these data suggest that PP2A is 
a new interacting partner of LRRK2 and reveal the importance of PP2A as a 
potential therapeutic target in PD.
