All eukaryotic cells present at the cell surface a specific set of plasma 
membrane proteins that modulate responses to internal and external cues and 
whose activity is also regulated by protein degradation. We characterized the 
lytic vacuole-dependent degradation of membrane proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana 
by means of in vivo visualization of vacuolar targeting combined with 
quantitative protein analysis. We show that the vacuolar targeting pathway is 
used by multiple cargos including PIN-FORMED (PIN) efflux carriers for the 
phytohormone auxin. In vivo visualization of PIN2 vacuolar targeting revealed 
its differential degradation in response to environmental signals, such as 
gravity. In contrast to polar PIN delivery to the basal plasma membrane, which 
depends on the vesicle trafficking regulator ARF-GEF GNOM, PIN sorting to the 
lytic vacuolar pathway requires additional brefeldin A-sensitive ARF-GEF 
activity. Furthermore, we identified putative retromer components SORTING NEXIN1 
(SNX1) and VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING29 (VPS29) as important factors in this 
pathway and propose that the retromer complex acts to retrieve PIN proteins from 
a late/pre-vacuolar compartment back to the recycling pathways. Our data suggest 
that ARF GEF- and retromer-dependent processes regulate PIN sorting to the 
vacuole in an antagonistic manner and illustrate instrumentalization of this 
mechanism for fine-tuning the auxin fluxes during gravitropic response.

Abstract

All eukaryotic cells present at the cell surface a specific set of plasma membrane proteins that modulate responses to internal and external cues and whose activity is also regulated by protein degradation. We characterized the lytic vacuole-dependent degradation of membrane proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana by means of in vivo visualization of vacuolar targeting combined with quantitative protein analysis. We show that the vacuolar targeting pathway is used by multiple cargos including PIN-FORMED (PIN) efflux carriers for the phytohormone auxin. In vivo visualization of PIN2 vacuolar targeting revealed its differential degradation in response to environmental signals, such as gravity. In contrast to polar PIN delivery to the basal plasma membrane, which depends on the vesicle trafficking regulator ARF-GEF GNOM, PIN sorting to the lytic vacuolar pathway requires additional brefeldin A-sensitive ARF-GEF activity. Furthermore, we identified putative retromer components SORTING NEXIN1 (SNX1) and VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING29 (VPS29) as important factors in this pathway and propose that the retromer complex acts to retrieve PIN proteins from a late/pre-vacuolar compartment back to the recycling pathways. Our data suggest that ARF GEF- and retromer-dependent processes regulate PIN sorting to the vacuole in an antagonistic manner and illustrate instrumentalization of this mechanism for fine-tuning the auxin fluxes during gravitropic response.

Conclusions

Our data provide insights into the turnover mechanism of plant plasma membrane proteins, including the PIN auxin efflux carriers. The PIN proteins regulate important decisions during plant development by limiting rate and direction of the polar auxin transport ( 2 , 3 ). The PIN-dependent auxin transport can be controlled at the level of PIN transcription ( 18 , 19 ), polar targeting ( 7 , 8 , 43 , 44 ), endocytosis ( 17 ), or protein stability ( 22 ).

We show that degradation of PIN proteins is mediated by their targeting to the vacuole that depends on the actin cytoskeleton and most likely on PI3K activity. PIN2 vacuolar trafficking and its polar recycling to the plasma membrane are interdependent, yet molecularly distinct, thus enabling the independent modulation of PIN2 protein abundance and polar localization. The ARF GEF GNOM regulates the PIN recycling rate to the basal plasma membrane ( 11 , 13 ), whereas (an) additional partially BFA-sensitive ARF GEF(s) appear(s) to regulate the vacuolar degradation of PIN2, most probably upon trafficking from endosomes to the PVC. On the other hand, activities of the putative retromer components SNX1 and VPS29 appear to regulate the defined rate of PIN2 translocation from the PVC to the vacuole. Notably, during Drosophila development a similar retromer-dependent mechanism regulates late endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of Wntless/Evi/Sprinter that is instrumental for Wingless (Wnt) transport to the plasma membrane. In the absence of the retromer, Wntless is degraded in lysosomes and Wnt secretion is impaired ( 45 ). In plants, the retromer complex similarly appears to promote PIN2 retrieval from the PVC most likely to the TGN but is not directly involved in polar PIN targeting to the plasma membrane ( Fig. S8 ).

PIN vacuolar trafficking and, henceforth, PIN levels can be controlled by external signals, such as light and gravity, providing an additional mechanism, besides transcytosis-like PIN polarity changes ( 12 , 13 ), for translating environmental signals into modulation of auxin fluxes and, consequently, auxin-dependent development.
