It is well known that the dopamine D(3) receptor plays a critical role in 
several psychological disorders, such as drug dependence. The present study was 
designed to investigate the influence of lacking dopamine D(3) receptors in 
dopamine-induced G-protein activation and Ca(2+) influx in the mouse forebrain. 
The deletion of dopamine D(3) receptor gene caused the enhancement of 
dopamine-induced G-protein activation in the limbic forebrain of dopamine D(3) 
receptor knockout (D(3)KO) mice. Furthermore, the dopamine-induced Ca(2+) influx 
was enhanced in the coculture of neuron/glia cells obtained from the forebrain 
of D(3)KO mice. The present data provide direct evidence that a deletion of 
central dopamine D(3) receptor enhances the dopamine D(1)/D(2) receptor-mediated 
intracellular signaling.
