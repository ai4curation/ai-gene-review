Isolation and characterization of a manganese-containing superoxide dismutase 
from yeast.

Ravindranath SD, Fridovich I.

The cyanide-insensitive superoxide dismutase of yeast has been shown to be 
localized in the mitochondrial matrix. This enzyme has been isolated in good 
yield from bakers' yeast. Its molecular weight is 96,000. It is a tetramer, 
being composed of four subunits of equal size. Exposure to sodium dodecyl 
sulfate at 100 degrees caused dissociation into dimers, while similar treatment 
but in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol caused complete dissociation into 
monomers. This enzyme contains 1 atom of manganese per subunit and its 
absorption in the visible suggests Mn(III) in the resting enzyme. Ascorbate 
caused partial bleaching, presumably by reduction to Mn(II). The amino acid 
composition was determined. This enzyme has activity comparable to that of other 
previously reported superoxide dismutases and like the chicken mitochondrial and 
the bacterial enzymes, its rate of reaction with O2 falls as the pH is raised 
above 7.8. Crystals of high quality were easily prepared.
