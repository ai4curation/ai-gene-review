High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a prototype damage-associated molecular 
pattern (DAMP) that can induce inflammatory and immune responses alone as well 
as in combination with other molecules such as DNA. However, the intricate 
molecular mechanisms underlying HMGB1-DNA complex-mediated innate immune 
response remains largely elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that HMGB1-DNA 
complex initially induced absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-dependent inflammasome 
activation, and promoted rapid release of inflammasome-dependent early 
proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β). Subsequently, 
HMGB1-DNA complex stimulated an ATG5-dependent cellular degradation process, 
autophagy, which was paralleled by a cessation of AIM2 inflammasome activation 
and IL-1β release. These HMGB1-DNA complex-induced inflammasome activation and 
autophagy were both dependent on the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts 
(RAGE) that recognizes a wide array of ligands (including HMGB1 and DNA). Thus, 
autophagy may function as a negative counter-regulatory mechanism for HMGB1-DNA 
complex-induced inflammasome activation, and provide a checkpoint to limit the 
development of inflammation.
