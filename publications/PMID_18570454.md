Exosomes, small membrane vesicles secreted by a multitude of cell types, are 
involved in a wide range of physiological roles such as intercellular 
communication, membrane exchange between cells, and degradation as an 
alternative to lysosomes. Because of the small size of exosomes (30-100 nm) and 
the limitations of common separation procedures including ultracentrifugation 
and flow cytometry, size-based fractionation of exosomes has been challenging. 
In this study, we used flow field-flow fractionation (FlFFF) to fractionate 
exosomes according to differences in hydrodynamic diameter. The exosome 
fractions collected from FlFFF runs were examined by transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) to morphologically confirm their identification as exosomes. 
Exosomal lysates of each fraction were digested and analyzed using nanoflow 
LC-ESI-MS-MS for protein identification. FIFFF, coupled with mass spectrometry, 
allows nanoscale size-based fractionation of exosomes and is more applicable to 
primary cells and stem cells since it requires much less starting material than 
conventional gel-based separation, in-gel digestion and the MS-MS method.
