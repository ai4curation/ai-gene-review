The fms-like tyrosine kinase (Flt) is a transmembrane receptor in the tyrosine 
kinase family. Expression of flt complementary DNA in COS cells conferred 
specific, high-affinity binding of vascular endothelial growth factor, also 
known as vascular permeability factor (VEGF-VPF), a factor that induces vascular 
permeability when injected in the guinea pig skin and stimulates endothelial 
cell proliferation. Expression of Flt in Xenopus laevis oocytes caused the 
oocytes to release calcium in response to VEGF-VPF. These findings show that flt 
encodes a receptor for VEGF-VPF.
