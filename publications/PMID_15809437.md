The extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD) is the largest region of NMDA 
receptors; however, biological roles for this ectodomain remain unknown. Here, 
we determined that the F-box protein, Fbx2, bound to high-mannose glycans of the 
NR1 ectodomain. F-box proteins specify ubiquitination by linking protein 
substrates to the terminal E3 ligase. Indeed, ubiquitination of NR1 was 
increased by Fbx2 and diminished by an Fbx2 dominant-negative mutant. When 
expressed in hippocampal neurons, this Fbx2 dominant-negative mutant augmented 
NR1 subunit levels and NMDA receptor-mediated currents in an activity-dependent 
fashion. These results suggest that homeostatic control of synaptic NR1 involves 
receptor retrotranslocation and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
