Using mouse osteoclast-like cells (OCs), we have shown that short exposure to 
calcitonin (CT) resulted in prolonged reduction of CT binding by inhibiting de 
novo CT receptor (CTR) synthesis. Additionally, CT-treated OCs demonstrated 
resistance to CT rechallenge on the inhibitory effect of CT in osteoclastic bone 
resorption. There is, however, scant information on CT effects on human 
osteoclasts. In this study, we examined the features of CTR down-regulation and 
its recovery after short exposure to CT of human OCs. OCs were prepared by 
treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro with osteoclast 
differentiation factor and macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Treatment of 
OCs with salmon CT (sCT) and human CT (hCT) resulted in a dose-dependent 
reduction in [125I]sCT binding capacity. Continued receptor occupancy by ligand 
was excluded by using a glycine-acid washing procedure. Treatment with sCT 
reduced CTR messenger RNA expression, suggesting that CTR down-regulation is, at 
least partly, attributable to an inhibition of de novo CTR synthesis. To 
investigate the intracellular signal transduction pathways that mediate these 
effects, we examined the effects of activation of the protein kinase (PK)A, PKC, 
and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinases. Treatment with PKC activators mimicked 
CT, whereas neither activation of PKA nor elevation of intracellular Ca2+ did 
so. We further investigated the intracellular signaling pathways responsible for 
the inhibitory effects of CT on bone resorption, which showed that treatment 
with PKC activators reproduced the effects of CT. These data suggest that the 
PKC pathway plays an important role in homologous CTR down-regulation, as well 
as inhibition of bone-resorbing activity by CT, in human OCs. Short exposure of 
OCs to CT (10(-9) M, 1 h) reduced [125I]sCT-specific binding for a prolonged 
period, as we have shown previously in mouse OCs. The reduced specific binding, 
CTR messenger RNA levels, and CT-sensitive adenylate cyclase responsiveness 
returned to the control levels by 96 h after removal of CT. These results 
strongly support the notion that escape from CT inhibition of osteoclastic bone 
resorption in humans is attributable to the development of resistance by OCs to 
CT. This study also showed that even short exposure to CT induced prolonged 
desensitization to CT rechallenge, although the OCs eventually regained 
responsiveness to sCT rechallenge.
