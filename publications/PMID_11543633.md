We have identified LASS2, a previously unknown human homologue of the yeast 
longevity assurance gene LAG1. The LASS2 transcript is highly expressed in liver 
and kidney, which is very different from the expression of the previously 
identified human LAG1 homologue LAG1Hs-1. Radiation hybrid mapping studies 
indicated that LASS2 is located on chromosome 1q11. Yeast two-hybrid screening 
and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays showed that the LASS2 protein 
interacts with several membrane-associated receptors or transporters. 
Furthermore, LASS2 protein was able to inhibit the colony formation of human 
hepatoma cells in vitro, which suggests that this gene may be involved in the 
regulation of cell growth.
