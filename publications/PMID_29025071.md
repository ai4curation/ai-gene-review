STUDY QUESTION: What are the features of FAM71D (Family with sequence similarity 
71, member D) expression and is there an association between FAM71D expression 
and sperm motility?
SUMMARY ANSWER: FAM71D, a novel protein exclusively expressed in the testis, is 
located in sperm flagella and is functionally involved in sperm motility.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Some testis-specific proteins have been reported as 
potential diagnostic biomarkers to evaluate the spermatogenesis process and 
sperm quality. We have identified a novel testis-specific protein, FAM71D, 
through microarray data analysis, yet little is known about its expression and 
function.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: FAM71D mRNA and protein expression was quantified 
during mouse testis development. Its localization in germ cells was detected by 
dual-labeled immunostaining in testis sections and sperm smears. The clinical 
significance was assessed by comparing FAM71D expression in spermatozoa from 
normozoospermic controls and asthenozoospermic patients.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Testes were dissected from C57BL/6 J 
male mice at postnatal ages of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 weeks and 6 months, and sperm 
was collected from cauda epididymides of adult mice by the swim-up method. Human 
spermatozoa were isolated from 100 human semen samples by density gradient 
Percoll centrifugation. RT-qPCR and western blot were performed to semi-quantify 
the expression of FAM71D in mouse testis, and in the ejaculated spermatozoa of 
normozoospermic controls and asthenozoospermic patients. Immunofluorescence 
staining was used to detect the localization of FAM71D. Co-immunoprecipitation 
assay was performed to evaluate the interaction between FAM71D and calmodulin. 
An antibody blocking assay was employed to assess the role of FAM71D in sperm 
motility.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Our results showed that FAM71D was 
exclusively expressed in the testis in an age-dependent manner. FAM71D 
expression exhibited dynamic change in the cytoplasm of spermatids during 
spermiogenesis and was finally retained in sperm flagella. FAM71D could interact 
with calmodulin. Use of anti-FAM71D antibody on sperm significantly decreased 
sperm motility. Expression level of FAM71D was markedly reduced in the 
ejaculated spermataozoa of asthenozoospermic patients (P < 0.05), and this was 
correlated with sperm progressive motility (r = 0.7435, P < 0.0001).
LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The sample size was limited and it is 
necessary to verify the correlation of FAM71D expression with sperm motility in 
larger cohorts. Furthermore, our results were descriptive and follow-up studies 
would be needed to elucidate the detailed role of FAM71D in sperm motility.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the first systematic study to 
document the expression of endogenous FAM71D and a function for FAM71D in sperm 
motility. It provides new insights into our understanding of sperm motility 
regulation and causes of male infertility.
