Hepcidin is a key iron-regulatory hormone produced by the liver. Inappropriately 
low hepcidin levels cause iron overload, while increased hepcidin expression 
plays an important role in the anemia of inflammation (AI) by restricting 
intestinal iron absorption and macrophage iron release. Its expression is 
modulated in response to body iron stores, hypoxia, and inflammatory and 
infectious stimuli involving at least in part cytokines secreted by macrophages. 
In this study we established and characterized IL6-mediated hepcidin activation 
in the human liver cell line Huh7. We show that the proximal 165 bp of the 
hepcidin promoter is critical for hepcidin activation in response to exogenously 
administered IL6 or to conditioned medium from the monocyte/macrophage cell line 
THP-1. Importantly, we show that hepcidin activation by these stimuli requires a 
STAT3 binding motif located at position -64/-72 of the promoter. The same STAT 
binding site is also required for high basal-level hepcidin mRNA expression 
under control culture conditions, and siRNA-mediated RNA knockdown of STAT3 
strongly reduces hepcidin mRNA expression. These results identify a missing link 
in the acute-phase activation of hepcidin and establish STAT3 as a key effector 
of baseline hepcidin expression and during inflammatory conditions.
