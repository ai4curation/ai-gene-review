Protein complexes from the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system are 
assembled with the help of proteins called assembly factors. We here delineate 
the function of the inner mitochondrial membrane protein TMEM70, in which 
mutations have been linked to OXPHOS deficiencies, using a combination of BioID, 
complexome profiling and coevolution analyses. TMEM70 interacts with complex I 
and V and for both complexes the loss of TMEM70 results in the accumulation of 
an assembly intermediate followed by a reduction of the next assembly 
intermediate in the pathway. This indicates that TMEM70 has a role in the 
stability of membrane-bound subassemblies or in the membrane recruitment of 
subunits into the forming complex. Independent evidence for a role of TMEM70 in 
OXPHOS assembly comes from evolutionary analyses. The TMEM70/TMEM186/TMEM223 
protein family, of which we show that TMEM186 and TMEM223 are mitochondrial in 
human as well, only occurs in species with OXPHOS complexes. Our results 
validate the use of combining complexome profiling with BioID and evolutionary 
analyses in elucidating congenital defects in protein complex assembly.
