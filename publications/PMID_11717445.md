A role for caspase-10, previously implicated in the autoimmune 
lymphoproliferative syndrome, in death receptor signaling has not been directly 
shown. Here we show that caspase-10 can function independently of caspase-8 in 
initiating Fas- and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing 
ligand-receptor-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, Fas crosslinking in primary human 
T cells leads to the recruitment and activation of caspase-10. Fluorescent 
resonance energy transfer analysis indicates that the death-effector domains of 
caspase-8 and -10 both interact with the death-effector domain of FADD. 
Nonetheless, we find that caspase-8 and -10 may have different apoptosis 
substrates and therefore potentially distinct roles in death receptor signaling 
or other cellular processes.
