Germ line alterations in BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 1) are 
associated with an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 
acts as a scaffold protein implicated in multiple cellular functions, such as 
transcription, DNA repair, and ubiquitination. However, the molecular mechanisms 
responsible for tumorigenesis are not yet fully understood. We have recently 
demonstrated that BRCA1 interacts in vivo with acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase 
alpha (ACCA) through its tandem of BRCA1 C terminus (BRCT) domains. To 
understand the biological function of the BRCA1.ACCA complex, we sought to 
determine whether BRCA1 is a regulator of lipogenesis through its interaction 
with ACCA. We showed here that RNA inhibition-mediated down-regulation of BRCA1 
expression induced a marked increase in the fatty acid synthesis. We then 
delineated the biochemical characteristics of the complex and found that BRCA1 
interacts solely with the phosphorylated and inactive form of ACCA (P-ACCA). 
Finally, we demonstrated that BRCA1 affects lipid synthesis by preventing P-ACCA 
dephosphorylation. These results suggest that BRCA1 affects lipogenesis through 
binding to P-ACCA, providing a new mechanism by which BRCA1 may exert a tumor 
suppressor function.
