Germ line alterations in BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 1) are 
associated with an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 
acts as a scaffold protein implicated in multiple cellular functions, such as 
transcription, DNA repair, and ubiquitination. However, the molecular mechanisms 
responsible for tumorigenesis are not yet fully understood. We have recently 
demonstrated that BRCA1 interacts in vivo with acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase 
alpha (ACCA) through its tandem of BRCA1 C terminus (BRCT) domains. To 
understand the biological function of the BRCA1.ACCA complex, we sought to 
determine whether BRCA1 is a regulator of lipogenesis through its interaction 
with ACCA. We showed here that RNA inhibition-mediated down-regulation of BRCA1 
expression induced a marked increase in the fatty acid synthesis. We then 
delineated the biochemical characteristics of the complex and found that BRCA1 
interacts solely with the phosphorylated and inactive form of ACCA (P-ACCA). 
Finally, we demonstrated that BRCA1 affects lipid synthesis by preventing P-ACCA 
dephosphorylation. These results suggest that BRCA1 affects lipogenesis through 
binding to P-ACCA, providing a new mechanism by which BRCA1 may exert a tumor 
suppressor function.

Abstract

The role of BRCA1 in cellular metabolism is not fully characterized and what we do understand has been primarily demonstrated in vitro . Our studies aimed to characterize the role of BRCA1 in metabolic pathways in a whole-body system. In vivo studies using C57BL/6 wild-type and transgenic humanized BRCA1 mice demonstrate the effect of human BRCA1 on the whole-body metabolic phenotype and start to elucidate the mechanism by which this occurs. Promethion metabolic chambers and glucose tolerance tests measured a number of metabolic outputs of male and female mice that were either wild-type (normal mouse Brca1 gene) or humanized BRCA1 mice (knock-out Brca1 /knock-in human BRCA1 gene). Humanized BRCA1 mice are more lean, hyperactive, display higher energy expenditure, and demonstrate a sexual dimorphism in lean mass and glucose tolerance when compared to wild-type mice on the same genetic background. To begin to elucidate the mechanisms behind the observed metabolic phenotype, we performed mass spectrometry, SuperArray, and Western blot analysis using skeletal muscle, a metabolic organ that significantly impacts energy metabolism. Proteomic and genomic analysis revealed changes in a number of metabolic pathways that may be implicated in the observed whole body metabolic phenotype. We concluded that substituting BRCA1 for Brca1 in an in vivo model altered the overall metabolic profile of humanized BRCA1 mice. Thus, the Brca1/BRCA1 gene appears to have a significant impact on metabolic pathways and these effects differ from mouse to human.

Introduction

Breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1) is an established tumor suppressor gene that when mutated causes a 70–80% increased risk of breast and a 50% increased risk of ovarian cancers. BRCA1 has been most widely characterized for its role in DNA repair, but BRCA1 has been shown to have a role in multiple cellular functions, including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle regulation, E3 ubiquitination, and apoptosis ( 1 ). Our understanding of the vast functionality of BRCA1 has primarily come from studies in breast cancer cell lines. However, both BRCA1 RNA and protein are expressed in many different tissues, including, but not limited to, the brain, skin, muscle, liver, thymus, lung, and prostate ( 2 ).

The structure of the BRCA1 protein is the primary reason BRCA1 participates in so many different cellular functions. BRCA1 is located on Chromosome 17 and the mRNA measures 7.8 kb, with 22 coding and two non-coding exons, producing a 220 kDa protein of 1863 amino acids. The BRCA1 protein contains several important functional domains such as the RING domain (encoded by exons 2–5), a serine cluster domain (encoded by exons 11–13) and a BRCT domain (encoded by exons 15–23) ( 3 ). BRCA1 also contains nuclear localization and nuclear export signal motifs. These domains allow BRCA1 to interact with many different proteins and influence many cellular functions.

More recently, BRCA1 has been shown to have a role in metabolic function ( 4 ). BRCA1 interacts with Acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACCA) in its phosphorylated form to regulate de novo fatty acid synthesis ( 5 ). Expression of BRCA1 can increase the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, decrease glycolysis and lipid storage, and loss of CtBP-regulation of BRCA1 transcription leads to a metabolic switch ( 6 , 7 ). Furthermore, studies have demonstrated the role of BRCA1 in metabolism in other tissues, such as skeletal muscle and cardiac and neuronal tissues. Specifically, skeletal muscle knockout of BRCA1 influences mitochondrial function ( 8 ).

Cell lines and mouse models have played a critical role in determining the numerous functions of BRCA1. However, it is important to note that mouse Brca1 and human BRCA1 have 50–74% similarity. While there is more than 85% similarity at the carboxy-terminal domain, no significant homologies exist to other gene products or functional motifs ( 9 ). Importantly, the mouse and human BRCA1 promoters have significantly diverged. Both genes have bidirectional promoters, however, human BRCA1 has two promoters (α and β), while mouse Brca1 has only the alpha promoter and potential binding sites for transcription factors present in the human gene are absent in the mouse gene. These differences have major implications for the interpretation and translation of animal model experiments ( 10 ). However, it has been demonstrated that while the human and murine genes have diverged, the two proteins have similar functions. Chandler et al. generated a humanized BRCA1 mouse model and established that the human BRCA1 gene could rescue the embryonic lethality of Brca1 mutant mice ( 11 ).

While the role of BRCA1 in metabolic pathways has been mostly demonstrated in vitro , we demonstrate herein the effect of human BRCA1 on the whole-body metabolic phenotype in vivo . Humanized BRCA1 mice are more lean, hyperactive and demonstrate a sexual dimorphism in glucose tolerance when compared to wild-type mice on the same genetic background. Proteomic and genomic studies using skeletal muscle revealed changes in a number of metabolic pathways that may be implicated in the observed whole-body metabolic phenotype. We can conclude that substituting BRCA1 for Brca1 in an in vivo model altered the overall metabolic profile of humanized BRCA1 mice.

CME bHPLC TMT Methods – Orbitrap Eclipse

Total protein from each tissue sample was reduced, alkylated, and purified by chloroform/methanol extraction prior to digestion with MS-grade porcine trypsin/LysC (Promega). The resulting peptides were labeled using a tandem mass tag 10-plex isobaric label reagent set (Thermo) and enriched using High-Select TiO2 following the manufacturer’s instructions. Both enriched and un-enriched labeled peptides were separated into 46 fractions on a 100 × 1.0 mm Acquity BEH C18 column (Waters) using an UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo) with a 40 min gradient from 99:1 to 60:40 buffer A:B ratio under basic pH conditions, and then consolidated into 18 super-fractions. Each super-fraction was then further separated by reverse phase XSelect CSH C18 2.5 um resin (Waters) on an in-line 150 × 0.075 mm column using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo). Peptides were eluted using a 75 min gradient from 98:2 to 60:40 buffer A:B ratio. Eluted peptides were ionized by electrospray (2.4 kV) followed by mass spectrometric analysis on an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo) using multi-notch MS3 parameters. MS data were acquired using the FTMS analyzer in top-speed profile mode at a resolution of 120,000 over a range of 375 to 1500 m/z. Following CID activation with normalized collision energy of 31.0, MS/MS data were acquired using the ion trap analyzer in centroid mode and normal mass range. Using synchronous precursor selection, up to 10 MS/MS precursors were selected for HCD activation with a normalized collision energy of 55.0, followed by the acquisition of MS3 reporter ion data using the FTMS analyzer in profile mode at a resolution of 50,000 over a range of 100–500 m/z. Buffer A = 0.1% formic acid, 0.5% acetonitrile, Buffer B = 0.1% formic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile. Both buffers were adjusted to pH 10 with ammonium hydroxide for offline separation.

Results

Indirect calorimetry is used to measure multiple aspects of small animal energy balance ( 18 ). To describe the influence of BRCA1 on the metabolic phenotype of the mouse, female and male wild-type C57BL/6 and humanized BRCA1 mice were housed in Promethion indirect calorimetry chambers for 72 hours in thermoneutral conditions at six months and one year of age. At six months of age, there was no significant difference in weight between the humanized BRCA1 female mice and wild-type C57BL/6 female mice ( Figure 1 , panel A ). However, at this same time point, the humanized BRCA1 males weighed significantly less than wild-type C57BL/6 males ( Figure 1 , panel B ). At one year of age, both humanized BRCA1 female and male mice weighed significantly less than their wild-type counterparts ( Figure 1 , panels A and B ). Using ECHO MRI to measure percent body fat, the trend was similar. At six months of age, there was no difference in percent body fat between the humanized BRCA1 female mice and wild-type females ( Figure 1 , panel C ). However, at this same time point, the humanized BRCA1 male mice had significantly lower percent body fat than wild-type males ( Figure 1 , panel D ). At one year of age, both humanized BRCA1 female and male mice had significantly less body fat than their wild-type counterparts ( Figure 1 , panels C and D ). ECHO MRI data also demonstrated that the difference in body weight was due to a loss of body fat and not lean mass ( Figure 1 , panels E and F ). Figure 1 panel E displays data from the female mice and indicates there was no difference in lean mass between the humanized BRCA1 or wild-type female mice at either six months or one year of age. However, the humanized BRCA1 male mice had significantly more lean mass compared to their wild-type counterparts at both six months and one year of age ( Figure 1 , panel F ). The demonstrated difference in weight and body fat was not due to significant differences in food uptake. At six months of age, both humanized BRCA1 female and male mice consumed a higher quantity of food during a 24-hour cycle than their wild-type counterparts, but these differences were not observed at one year of age ( Supplemental Data , Figure 1 , panels A and B ). Analysis of feeding bouts over a 24-hour cycle indicated humanized BRCA1 female and male mice at six months of age had significantly more feeding bouts than their wild-type counterparts ( Supplemental Data , Figure 1 , panels C and D ). At one year of age, there was no difference between the humanized BRCA1 female and wild-type mice, but the humanized BRCA1 male mice still demonstrated more feeding bouts than wild-type male mice. Additionally, humanized BRCA1 female and male mice drank more water than their wild-type counterparts at both six months and one year of age ( Supplemental Data , Figure 1 , panels E and F ). These data indicate humanized BRCA1 female and male mice weigh less and have less body fat when compared to wild-type mice and the humanized BRCA1 male mice have more lean mass than their wild-type counterparts. Furthermore, the observed differences in weight, body fat, and lean mass are not due to eating less. Rather, data indicates humanized BRCA1 mice had more feeding bouts over a 24-hour cycle and consumed more food and water than their wild-type counterparts.

Indirect calorimetry cages also provide data quantifying incurrent and excurrent gas concentrations. By comparing this exchange, and thus measuring the reduction in oxygen concentration and increase in CO 2 concentration caused by the animal, it is possible to derive accurate measurements of the animal’s O 2 consumption rate (VO 2 ) and CO 2 production rate (VCO 2 ), from which its respiratory quotient (RQ = VCO 2 /VO 2 ) and energy expenditure (EE) can be calculated. Respiratory quotient (RQ) is a dimensionless number used in a calculation for basal metabolic rate when estimated from CO 2 production to O 2 absorption ( 19 ). The RQ, which typically ranges between 0.7 and 1.0, is an indicator of metabolic fuel or substrate use in tissues relative to the participation of glucose, lipid, and proteins in energy production ( 18 , 20 ). A ratio of 0.7 is indicative of fat utilization as the primary substrate, whereas a ratio of 1.0 indicates the exclusive use of carbohydrates. Both female and male humanized BRCA1 mice at six months and one year of age significantly consumed more O 2 and produced higher concentrations of CO 2 compared to their wild-type counterparts ( Figure 2 , panels A-D ). The humanized BRCA1 female mice displayed a significantly higher RQ value at six months of age (0.780 vs 0.746) but at one year of age humanized BRCA1 and wild-type C57BL/6 female mice had similar RQ values (range: 0.76–0.79) ( Figure 2 , panel E ). This data indicates these female mice are equally oxidizing fat as their energy source. In the male mice, at six months the humanized BRCA1 males had a significantly higher RQ value than their wild-type counterparts (0.77 vs. 0.81) ( Figure 2 , panel F ). However, this difference is not observed between the one-year-old male mice. These data indicate that humanized BRCA1 female and male mice consume more O 2 and produce more CO 2 than their wild-type counterparts. However, RQ values would indicate fuel utilization is similar between the groups. Interestingly, when the data was analyzed in 12-hour increments, the humanized BRCA1 female mice had a significantly higher RQ value at six months during the daytime period only ( Supplemental Figure 2, panel A ). In contrast, at six months, the humanized BRCA1 males displayed a significantly higher RQ value during the daytime and nighttime periods over their wild-type counterparts. At one year, the wild-type C57BL/6 males measured a higher RQ during the daytime period, but the humanized BRCA1 males recorded a higher RQ during the nighttime period ( Supplemental Figure 2, panel B ). The 12-hour data analysis supports the 24-hour data analysis at the six-month time point and likely accounts for the lack of significant change observed at the one-year time point.

Indirect calorimetry also revealed that humanized BRCA1 female and male mice expend significantly more energy than their wild-type counterparts ( Figure 3 , panels A and B ). Notably, humanized BRCA1 female and male mice also record higher resting energy expenditure compared to their wild-type counterparts ( Supplemental Figure 3, panels A and B ). For the humanized BRCA1 male mice, the increase in energy expenditure correlates with higher ambulatory activity as indicated by greater ped meters at both six month and one-year time points ( Figure 3 , panel D ). This is not the case for the humanized BRCA1 female mice ( Figure 3 , panel C ). However, both female and male humanized BRCA1 mice are sleeping less than their wild-type counterparts ( Figure 3 , panels E and F ). This data suggests that humanized BRCA1 mice expend more energy, log more ped meters and sleep less. When the data was analyzed over two twelve-hour periods (day and night), both the humanized BRCA1 females and males demonstrated a higher energy expenditure over their wild-type counterparts at all time points during the daytime and nighttime cycles ( Supplemental Figure 3, panels C and D ). The humanized BRCA1 males also displayed greater ped meters during day and night while the humanized BRCA1 females only displayed greater ped meters during the nighttime period at one year of age ( Supplemental Figure 3, panels E and F ). Collectively, the data presented thus far indicate humanized BRCA1 female and male mice have a hyperactive phenotype when compared to their wild-type C57BL/6 counterparts and this is impacting their overall metabolic phenotype to some degree.

Differences in body mass can contribute to the observed differences in resting energy expenditure ( 21 ). Therefore, we performed an ANCOVA analysis to determine the impact of body mass on energy expenditure within the humanized BRCA1 and wild-type mice at each sex and time point ( Table 1 A – D ). ANCOVA analysis revealed that body weight did not impact energy expenditure in the humanized BRCA1 female mice or male mix at six months of age. However, body weight did influence energy expenditure in the humanized BRCA1 male mice at one year of age (p = 0.009103). Additionally, the ANCOVA analysis revealed that body weight did influence energy expenditure in the wild-type mice but only males (p = 0.02341 and 0.0001798). Thus, we conclude that the difference in body mass only impacts the energy expenditure phenotype found in the one-year-old humanized BRCA1 male mice vs. wild-type mice.

In addition to their metabolic phenotype as defined by indirect calorimetry, glucose tolerance tests were performed with careful consideration of methodology and interpretation ( 22 ). At six months of age, there was no difference in glucose clearance between humanized BRCA1 female or male mice when compared to their wild-type counterparts ( Figure 4 , panels A-D ). At one-year of age, this remained true for the female mice. However, at one year of age, humanized BRCA1 male mice had a significantly higher area under the curve (Avg. = 48,615) compared to wild-type C57BL/6 male mice (Avg. = 35,897) ( Figure 4 , panels B and D ). This data indicates that at one year of age the humanized BRCA1 male mice have impaired glucose tolerance compared to wild-type males of the same age.

To elucidate the molecular details behind the observed metabolic phenotypes, we performed proteomics and characterized gene expression specific to metabolic pathways in skeletal muscle. Proteomic analysis was performed on skeletal muscle from five wild-type C57BL/6 female mice and five humanized BRCA1 female mice ( Figure 5 ). Figure 5 , panel A is a hierarchical cluster heat map of relative protein abundance in each sample and demonstrates that the five samples from the wild-type mice had similar proteomic profiles, the five samples from the humanized BRCA1 mice had similar proteomic profiles, but the proteomic profiles of humanized BRCA1 mice were found to be different from those of the wild-type mice (red is upregulated, blue is downregulated). Figure 5 , panel B is a volcano plot of the differential analysis of the proteomic data and plots the average log 2 (fold change) of each protein against its −log 10 (p-value). Out of 1,298 proteins analyzed, 47 proteins were significantly (more than 2-fold) upregulated (red) and 121 were significantly downregulated (blue) in the samples from the humanized BRCA1 mice. Reactome Pathway enrichment analysis plots ( Figures 6A and B ) identified the relative abundance of proteins associated with specific functional pathways. Figure 6A plots the top Reactome pathways enriched in proteins that were upregulated in the samples from the humanized BRCA1 mice: interferon gamma signaling, glycogen metabolism, RAF activation, gluconeogenesis, metabolism of carbohydrates, ion homeostasis, muscle contraction, and fatty acid metabolism. Figure 6B plots the top 15 pathways enriched in proteins that were downregulated in the samples from the humanized BRCA1 mice. Notably, several metabolic pathways were influenced including fatty acid metabolism, metabolisms of carbohydrates, glycogen metabolism, and O 2 /CO 2 exchange. Modulation of these pathways provide some insight to the genotype-phenotype relationship observed in the metabolic studies. To further focus, the mouse glucose metabolism RT 2 Profiler PCR array was used to interrogate 84 key genes involved in the regulation of glucose and glycogen metabolism. Analysis was performed on RNA extracted from skeletal muscle from four wild-type C57BL/6 female mice and four humanized BRCA1 female mice ( Supplemental Table 1 ). Figure 7 plots the fold change versus the significance value and shows 11 genes that are significantly upregulated in the humanized BRCA1 mice (G6pdx, Gsk3a, Gsk3b, Idh1, Idh3b, Ogdh, Pdha1, Pdpr, Pgm1, Pgm2, Rpe). Collectively, these genes promote glycolysis and the TCA cycle while at the same time inhibit glycogen synthesis. While there were genes that were downregulated, they did not meet significance criteria. Both the proteomic and genomic studies have provided pathways and proteins to further pursue to deepen our understanding of the influence of BRCA1 on metabolic pathways.

To determine if any observed protein changes in the mass spectrometry data contributed to the observed differences in glucose tolerance, we searched the data for proteins involved in the insulin signaling pathway. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) was identified to be slightly increased (1.35-fold) in female humanized BRCA1 mice. While this increase does not meet our 2-fold criteria, we considered the possibility of gender differences. IGFBP5 is one of six in a family of binding proteins which bind to insulin-like growth factors, inhibit their interaction with their receptors, ultimately reducing signaling activity ( 23 ). Similar to what was observed in the mass spectrometry data, Western blot analysis of skeletal muscle from three wild-type C57BL/6 female mice and three humanized BRCA1 female mice revealed a slight increase in IGFBP5 protein expression in the humanized BRCA1 mouse samples (1.37-fold) ( Figure 8 , A and C ). Notably, analysis of skeletal muscle samples from two wild-type C57BL/6 male mice and three humanized BRCA1 male mice demonstrated a larger increase in IGFBP5 expression in the humanized BRCA1 male mice (2.43-fold) as compared to the wild-type controls ( Figure 8 , B and C ). Further analysis of proteins downstream of the IGFBP5/IGF signaling pathway revealed a slight decrease in Ras (0.79-fold) and p44/42 MAPK (0.52-fold) in the female humanized BRCA1 mice as compared to the wild-type control mice ( Figure 8 , A and C ). This change was amplified in the humanized BRCA1 male mice with an observed 0.38-fold decrease in Ras expression and a 0.14-fold decrease in p44/42 MAPK ( Figure 8 , B and C ). The phosphorylated form of p44/42 MAPK was increased in both the female humanized BRCA1 mice (4.53-fold), and the male humanized BRCA1 mice (2.63-fold) as compared to the wild-type controls ( Figure 8 , A , B , C , and D ). The increase in IGFBP5 protein expression coupled with a decrease in proteins involved in the IGF signaling pathway (Ras and p44/42 MAPK) could be a mechanism behind the impaired glucose tolerance observed in the humanized BRCA1 male mice. The increase in the phospho/total p44/42 MAPK ratio ( Figure 8 , D ) observed in both the humanized BRCA1 male and female mice could be attributed to their increased energy expenditure ( 24 , 25 ).

Discussion

In the early 1990s, BRCA1 was mapped to chromosome 17q21 as a gene responsible for predisposition to early-onset breast and ovarian cancer ( 26 – 28 ). At that time, little was known about the function of BRCA1. We now know BRCA1 is a multifaceted protein involved in checkpoint regulation, transcriptional regulation, replication, protein ubiquitination, apoptosis, and its most widely characterized role, homologous DNA repair ( 29 ). In 2014, it was demonstrated BRCA1 modulates cellular metabolic pathways ( 6 ). Specifically, BRCA1 has been shown to regulate de novo fatty acid synthesis through its interaction with acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCA) ( 30 ), reprogram breast epithelial cells toward mitochondrial-dependent biosynthesis ( 31 ), and promote oxidative metabolism and restrict tumorigenicity ( 32 ).

Some of what we know about BRCA1 function comes from mouse studies. Brca1 , the mouse homolog, is located on chromosome 11 and the protein shows a 58% amino acid identify to the human homolog. Mice with homozygous mutations in BRCA1 die between embryonic days (E)5.5–13.5 ( 33 ). Therefore, BRCA1 deficiency has been modeled in mice in many different ways and there is large phenotypic variation ( 34 ). Specifically, more than 20 BRCA1 mouse models have been developed to investigate the role of BRCA1 in mammary tumor development ( 35 ). With the large phenotypic variation in these mouse models, differences in mouse and human breast tumor development in different mouse models should be carefully interpreted as preclinical evidence ( 36 ).

While we understand obesity and weight changes can increase the risk of breast cancer development, no mouse models have investigated the influence of BRCA1 on the in vivo metabolic phenotype. To fully understand the influence of a genetic alteration, we need a complex biological system, the ability to alter environmental influences, and the ability to translate findings to humans. The use of humanized mice has emerged as a valuable tool in providing a model system that translates to patients in the clinic ( 37 ). These mice more efficiently translate discoveries between two different biological systems. Humanized mice provide improved platforms for understanding of immunity, infectious diseases, autoimmunity, drug development, and tumor microenvironment ( 38 ). We described the metabolic phenotype of a humanized BRCA1 mouse model and shed light on the physiological consequences of human BRCA1 expression. Indirect calorimetry data demonstrated humanized BRCA1 mice weigh less, have less body fat and more lean mass than wild-type mice. Humanized BRCA1 mice also expend more energy and sleep, eat, and drink less. ANCOVA analysis revealed body weight did influence energy expenditure in the humanized BRCA1 male mice at one year of age. When compared to their wild-type counterpart, humanized BRCA1 male mice also have increased plasma glucose levels while this is not observed in the humanized BRCA1 female mice. Collectively, these data provide additional insight into the impact BRCA1 has on whole body metabolism and provide opportunities for further studies.

Metabolism involves many different cellular pathways collaborating to provide cells with enough energy to function efficiently ( 39 ). Glycolysis, the Citric Acid Cycle, Oxidative Phosphorylation, and synthesis pathways for fatty acids, triglycerides, amino acids, and proteins all interact and regulate one another so that there is a sustainable, effective balance between catabolic and anabolic reactions. Recent studies have demonstrated BRCA1 has a role in these metabolic pathways. Specifically, BRCA1 interacts with Acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACCA) in its phosphorylated form to regulate de novo fatty acid synthesis ( 30 ). In vivo , it has been demonstrated that Brca1 knockout in skeletal muscle results in reduced insulin-induced glucose uptake and decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption ( 8 ) and prevents high-fat diet induced alterations in glucose and insulin tolerance ( 40 ). Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of Brca1 alters fatty acid and glucose metabolism such that the heart was energy starved ( 41 ). Recently, it was demonstrated that BRCA1 can regulate glucose and lipid metabolism in mouse primary hepatocytes via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway ( 42 ). Therefore, the data contributes to the growing concept that BRCA1 is a regulator of metabolic function ( 5 , 6 ).

Our proteomic and genomic data suggests BRCA1 influences the expression of a number of genes that promote glycolysis and the TCA cycle while at the same time inhibit glycogen synthesis. Furthermore, proteins in the insulin pathway are modulated and it is well established that insulin signaling can influence metabolic pathways ( 43 ). Specifically, we observed insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5) is upregulated in humanized BRCA1 mice, more so in the male mice than females. The IGFBPs serve to regulate the activity of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway ( 44 , 45 ). Studies in human breast cancer cell lines have demonstrated BRCA1 suppresses promoter activity and endogenous levels of IGFR-1 and represses IGF1 expression ( 46 ). Our studies also indicate Ras and p44/42 MAPK, downstream signaling targets of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGFR-1), are downregulated in the humanized BRCA1 mice. There is precedence to suggest the increase in IGFBP-5 sequesters insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) in circulation thereby reducing activation of IGFR-1 and subsequently the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway ( 44 , 47 ). The increased levels of phospho-p44/42 MAPK were initially unexpected in this study as total p44/22 MAPK protein levels were decreased. However, a study by Galpin et al. demonstrated high-intensity physical exercise induces phospho-p44/42 MAPK while maintaining total p44/42 MAPK levels ( 25 ). Additionally, a study of high-intensity physical exercise in humans demonstrated an activation of the MAPK pathway that was localized to the skeletal muscle ( 24 ). We hypothesize the observed increase in phospho-p44/42 MAPK and decrease in total p44/42 MAPK could be related to the increased activity observed in both the female and male humanized BRCA1 mice. Collectively, these findings could contribute to the glucose intolerance observed in the humanized BRCA1 male mice, however further confirmatory studies are needed.

Our study has some limitations, including the humanized BRCA1 model. While the mouse Brca1 has been knocked out and the human BRCA1 rescued embryonic lethality, there are 2–5 copies of BRCA1 in the humanized mice. While our observations align with observations in human cell lines where BRCA1 is knocked out or overexpressed, we will need to extend our studies to other models. Measuring additional metabolic parameters such as body temperature and white and brown adipose tissue would have helped explore the effect of thermogenesis in our model. Furthermore, insulin tolerance tests would have been a nice complement to our glucose tolerance findings. Additionally, we need to fully detail the impact of top proteomic and genomic data findings. Understanding the way proteins from interferon gamma signaling, neutrophil degranulation, and the innate immune system pathways contribute to the observed metabolic phenotype are critical next steps. Studies have demonstrated that inflammation modulates skeletal muscle regeneration ( 48 ). Interestingly, Spangenburg’s review highlights the role of IGF-1 in skeletal muscle physiology and suggests IGF-1 significantly contributes to hypertrophy ( 49 ). There is still much to learn about the interplay between metabolic pathways, insulin signaling, and BRCA1 function.

The correlation between metabolic syndrome and breast cancer risk has been well described ( 50 ). Furthermore, obesity and diabetes are associated with multiple factors that contribute to an increased risk of breast cancer ( 51 ). However, these correlations are less understood when specifically related to women who carry a mutation in BRCA1 ( 52 ). Studies in BRCA1 mutation carriers indicate various levels of association with metabolic risk factors ( 53 , 54 ). Our in vivo data indicates a clear role for BRCA1 in whole-body metabolism and provides insight into the potential mechanism by which BRCA1 influences metabolic and insulin pathways. Deepening our understanding of the complex influence of BRCA1 on these signaling pathways will have considerable basic and translational relevance, specifically on women who carry a mutation in BRCA1 .
