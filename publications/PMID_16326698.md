Germ line alterations in BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 1) are 
associated with an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 
acts as a scaffold protein implicated in multiple cellular functions, such as 
transcription, DNA repair, and ubiquitination. However, the molecular mechanisms 
responsible for tumorigenesis are not yet fully understood. We have recently 
demonstrated that BRCA1 interacts in vivo with acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase 
alpha (ACCA) through its tandem of BRCA1 C terminus (BRCT) domains. To 
understand the biological function of the BRCA1.ACCA complex, we sought to 
determine whether BRCA1 is a regulator of lipogenesis through its interaction 
with ACCA. We showed here that RNA inhibition-mediated down-regulation of BRCA1 
expression induced a marked increase in the fatty acid synthesis. We then 
delineated the biochemical characteristics of the complex and found that BRCA1 
interacts solely with the phosphorylated and inactive form of ACCA (P-ACCA). 
Finally, we demonstrated that BRCA1 affects lipid synthesis by preventing P-ACCA 
dephosphorylation. These results suggest that BRCA1 affects lipogenesis through 
binding to P-ACCA, providing a new mechanism by which BRCA1 may exert a tumor 
suppressor function.

## Full Text

The role of BRCA1 in cellular metabolism is not fully characterized and what we do understand has been primarily demonstrated in vitro. Our studies aimed to characterize the role of BRCA1 in metabolic pathways in a whole-body system. In vivo studies using C57BL/6 wild-type and transgenic humanized BRCA1 mice demonstrate the effect of human BRCA1 on the whole-body metabolic phenotype and start to elucidate the mechanism by which this occurs. Promethion metabolic chambers and glucose tolerance tests measured a number of metabolic outputs of male and female mice that were either wild-type (normal mouse Brca1 gene) or humanized BRCA1 mice (knock-out Brca1/knock-in human BRCA1 gene). Humanized BRCA1 mice are more lean, hyperactive, display higher energy expenditure, and demonstrate a sexual dimorphism in lean mass and glucose tolerance when compared to wild-type mice on the same genetic background. To begin to elucidate the mechanisms behind the observed metabolic phenotype, we performed mass spectrometry, SuperArray, and Western blot analysis using skeletal muscle, a metabolic organ that significantly impacts energy metabolism. Proteomic and genomic analysis revealed changes in a number of metabolic pathways that may be implicated in the observed whole body metabolic phenotype. We concluded that substituting BRCA1 for Brca1 in an in vivo model altered the overall metabolic profile of humanized BRCA1 mice. Thus, the Brca1/BRCA1 gene appears to have a significant impact on metabolic pathways and these effects differ from mouse to human.

This is the first in vivo evidence demonstrating the complex effects of BRCA1 expression in whole-body metabolism.
