An inflammatory bowel disease-risk variant in INAVA decreases pattern 
recognition receptor-induced outcomes.

Yan J, Hedl M, Abraham C.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by dysregulation in both 
cytokines and responses to intestinal microbes, and proper regulation of pattern 
recognition receptor (PRR) signaling is critical for intestinal immune 
homeostasis. Altered functions for the IBD risk locus containing rs7554511, 
which encompasses the C1orf106 gene (recently named INAVA), and roles for the 
protein encoded by the INAVA gene are unknown. Here, we investigated the role of 
INAVA and INAVA genotype in regulating PRR-initiated outcomes in primary human 
cells. Both peripheral and intestinal myeloid cells expressed INAVA. Upon PRR 
stimulation, INAVA was required for optimal MAPK and NF-κB activation, cytokine 
secretion, and intracellular bacterial clearance. INAVA recruited 14-3-3τ, 
thereby contributing to recruitment of a signaling complex that amplified 
downstream signals and cytokines. Further, INAVA enhanced bacterial clearance by 
regulating reactive oxygen, reactive nitrogen, and autophagy pathways. 
Macrophages from rs7554511 C risk carriers expressed lower levels of INAVA RNA 
and protein. Lower expression was attributed in part to decreased transcription 
mediated directly by the intronic region containing the rs7554511 C variant. In 
rs7554511 C risk carrier macrophages, lower INAVA expression led to decreased 
PRR-induced activation of MAPK and NF-κB pathways, cytokines, and bacterial 
clearance pathways. Thus, IBD-associated polymorphisms in INAVA modulate 
PRR-initiated signaling, cytokines, and intracellular bacterial clearance, 
likely contributing to intestinal immune homeostasis.
