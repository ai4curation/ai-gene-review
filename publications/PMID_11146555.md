Interferons are important in regulating cell growth and differentiation, immune 
function and initiating anti-viral responses. While the pleotrophic actions of 
interferons have been well documented, the molecular mechanisms underpinning 
their biological effects have not been fully characterized. IFI 16 is a member 
of the interferon-inducible HIN-200 family of nuclear proteins, which we have 
recently shown can function as a potent transcriptional repressor. A murine 
member of the HIN-200 family, p202, can indirectly interact with p53 via the p53 
binding protein (p53bp) and inhibit p53-mediated transcriptional activation. The 
binding activity of p202 to p53bp was shown to require the conserved MFHATVAT 
motif present in all 200 amino acid repeat regions of HIN-200 proteins. Given 
that IFI 16 contains two MFHATVAT motifs, we sought to determine whether IFI 16 
may form a complex with p53 and if so to ascertain the functional significance 
of this interaction. We demonstrate that IFI 16 can directly bind to the 
C-terminal region of p53 and augment p53-mediated transcriptional activation 
without altering the steady state levels of p53. Thus, in addition to its 
ability to directly regulate gene expression, IFI 16 can also modulate the 
transcription function of other cellular transcription factors. These findings 
demonstrate a possible link between gene induction following interferon 
stimulation and p53-mediated cellular events.
