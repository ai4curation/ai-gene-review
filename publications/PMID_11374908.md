Two novel heart-specific genes, C3orf3 (chromosome 3 open reading frame 3) and 
MMGL (myomegalin-like), were isolated using BodyMap, a gene expression database 
based on site-directed 3' expressed sequence tags (3'-ESTs) which were collected 
from nonbiased cDNA libraries of various tissues. The cDNA of C3orf3 was 1667 bp 
and was composed of 12 exons within a 10-kb-long genomic sequence. MMGL 
consisted of 8 exons within a genomic sequence of over 70 kb, leading to four 
alternatively spliced transcripts. Both genes were strongly expressed in heart 
and also in skeletal muscle. C3orf3 and MMGL were mapped to 3p22 and 1q1, 
respectively. Subcellular localizations of their putative proteins were 
determined as being in the cytoplasm for C3orf3 and in the cytoplasm and nucleus 
for MMGL. This study showed that BodyMap is a useful database for the isolation 
of tissue-specific genes.
