FoxO Forkhead transcription factors are shown here to act as signal transducers 
at the confluence of Smad, PI3K, and FoxG1 pathways. Smad proteins activated by 
TGF-beta form a complex with FoxO proteins to turn on the growth inhibitory gene 
p21Cip1. This process is negatively controlled by the PI3K pathway, a known 
inhibitor of FoxO localization in the nucleus, and by the telencephalic 
development factor FoxG1, which we show binds to FoxO-Smad complexes and blocks 
p21Cip1 expression. We suggest that the activity of this network confers 
resistance to TGF-beta-mediated cytostasis during the development of the 
telencephalic neuroepithelium and in glioblastoma brain tumor cells.
