Autosomal dominant mutations in leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the 
most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the presence of 
multiple domains, the kinase activity of LRRK2 is thought to represent the 
primary function of the protein. Alterations in LRRK2 kinase activity are 
thought to underlie the pathogenesis of its PD-linked mutations; however, many 
questions regarding basic aspects of LRRK2 function remain unclear, including 
the cellular mechanisms of LRRK2 regulation and the importance of its unique 
distribution within the cell. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the 
subcellular localization of wild-type LRRK2 is associated with changes in four 
distinct biochemical properties likely crucial for LRRK2 function. Our data 
demonstrate for the first time that the wild-type LRRK2 dimer possesses greater 
kinase activity than its more abundant monomeric counterpart. Importantly, we 
show that this activated form of LRRK2 is substantially enriched at the membrane 
of cells expressing endogenous or exogenous LRRK2, and that the 
membrane-associated fraction of LRRK2 likewise possesses greater kinase activity 
than cytosolic LRRK2. In addition, membrane-associated LRRK2 binds GTP more 
efficiently than cytosolic LRRK2 but demonstrates a lower degree of 
phosphorylation. Our observations suggest that multiple events, including 
altered protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications, 
contribute to the regulation of LRRK2 function, through modulation of membrane 
association and complex assembly. These findings may have implications for the 
sites of LRRK2 function within the cell, the identification and localization of 
bona fide LRRK2 substrates, and efforts to design small molecule inhibitors of 
LRRK2.
