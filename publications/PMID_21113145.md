Loss of parkin function is responsible for the majority of autosomal recessive 
parkinsonism. Here, we show that parkin is not only a stress-protective, but 
also a stress-inducible protein. Both mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) stress induce an increase in parkin-specific mRNA and protein levels. The 
stress-induced upregulation of parkin is mediated by ATF4, a transcription 
factor of the unfolded protein response (UPR) that binds to a specific CREB/ATF 
site within the parkin promoter. Interestingly, c-Jun can bind to the same site, 
but acts as a transcriptional repressor of parkin gene expression. We also 
present evidence that mitochondrial damage can induce ER stress, leading to the 
activation of the UPR, and thereby to an upregulation of parkin expression. Vice 
versa, ER stress results in mitochondrial damage, which can be prevented by 
parkin. Notably, the activity of parkin to protect cells from stress-induced 
cell death is independent of the proteasome, indicating that proteasomal 
degradation of parkin substrates cannot explain the cytoprotective activity of 
parkin. Our study supports the notion that parkin has a role in the 
interorganellar crosstalk between the ER and mitochondria to promote cell 
survival under stress, suggesting that both ER and mitochondrial stress can 
contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.
