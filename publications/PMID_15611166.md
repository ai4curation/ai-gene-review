In a screen for suppressors of activated GOA-1 (Galpha(o)) under the control of 
the hsp-16.2 heat-shock promoter, we identified three genetic loci that affected 
heat-shock-induced GOA-1 expression. The cyl-1 mutants are essentially wild type 
in appearance, while hsf-1 and sup-45 mutants have egg-laying defects. The hsf-1 
mutation also causes a temperature-sensitive developmental arrest, and hsf-1 
mutants have decreased life span. Western analysis indicated that mutations in 
all three loci suppressed the activated GOA-1 transgene by decreasing its 
expression. Heat-shock-induced expression of hsp-16.2 mRNA was reduced in cyl-1 
mutants and virtually eliminated in hsf-1 and sup-45 mutants, as compared to 
wild-type expression. The mutations could also suppress other transgenes under 
heat-shock control. cyl-1 and sup-45, but not hsf-1, mutations suppressed a 
defect caused by a transgene not under heat-shock control, suggesting a role in 
general transcription or a post-transcriptional aspect of gene expression. hsf-1 
encodes the C. elegans homolog of the human heat-shock factor HSF1, and cyl-1 
encodes a cyclin most similar to cyclin L. We believe HSF-1 acts in 
heat-shock-inducible transcription and CYL-1 acts more generally in gene 
expression.
