Cataracts, the loss of lens transparency, are the leading cause of human 
blindness. The zebrafish embryo, with its transparency and relatively large 
eyes, is an excellent model for studying ocular disease in vivo. We found that 
the zebrafish cloche mutant, both the cloche(m39) and cloche(S5) alleles, which 
have defects in hematopoiesis and blood vessel development, also have lens 
cataracts. Quantitative examination of the living zebrafish lens by confocal 
microscopy showed significant increases in lens reflectance. Histological 
analysis revealed retention of lens fiber cell nuclei owing to impeded terminal 
differentiation. Proteomics identified gamma-crystallin as a protein that was 
substantially diminished in cloche mutants. Crystallins are the major structural 
proteins in mouse, human and zebrafish lens. Defects in crystallins have 
previously been shown in mice and humans to contribute to cataracts. The loss of 
gamma-crystallin protein in cloche was not due to lowered mRNA levels but rather 
to gamma-crystallin protein insolubility. AlphaA-crystallin is a chaperone that 
protects proteins from misfolding and becoming insoluble. The cloche lens is 
deficient in both alphaA-crystallin mRNA and protein during development from 2-5 
dpf. Overexpression of exogenous alphaA-crystallin rescued the cloche lens 
phenotype, including solubilization of gamma-crystallin, increased lens 
transparency and induction of lens fiber cell differentiation. Taken together, 
these results indicate that alphaA-crystallin expression is required for normal 
lens development and demonstrate that cataract formation can be prevented in 
vivo. In addition, these results show that proteomics is a valuable tool for 
detecting protein alterations in zebrafish.
