Metastatic Lymph Node 51 (MLN51) cDNA was isolated by differential screening of 
a human breast cancer metastasis cDNA library. MLN51 cDNA encodes a novel human 
protein of 703 residues that shares no significant homology to any known 
protein. However MLN51 is well conserved between vertebrate and invertebrate 
species suggesting an important biological function. The amino terminal half of 
the protein contains a coiled-coil domain and two potential nuclear localization 
signals (NLS). The carboxy terminal half contains one SH2 and four SH3 binding 
motifs. The coiled-coil domain promotes MLN51 oligomerization in transfected 
cells. When transiently expressed, the MLN51 protein is mainly found in the 
cytoplasm with a weak nuclear staining. However, deletion of the carboxy 
terminal half of the protein allows the targeting of the protein to the nucleus, 
demonstrating that the NLSs are functional. MLN51 is ubiquitously expressed in 
normal tissues. Human breast carcinomas show MLN51 overexpression in malignant 
epithelial cells. The uncommon association of protein-protein interaction 
domains often found either in nuclear or in cytoplasmic signaling proteins 
raises a possible nucleo-cytoplasmic function for MLN51.
