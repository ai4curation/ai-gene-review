Kremen1 and 2 (Krm1/2) are coreceptors for Dickkopf1 (Dkk1), an antagonist of 
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and play a role in head induction during early 
Xenopus development. In a proteomic approach we identified Erlectin, a novel 
protein that interacts with Krm2. Erlectin (XTP3-B) is member of a protein 
family containing mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH-, or PRKCSH-) 
domains implicated in N-glycan binding. Like other members of the MRH family, 
Erlectin is a luminal resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. It contains 
two MRH domains, of which one is essential for Krm2 binding, and this 
interaction is abolished by Krm2 deglycosylation. The overexpression of Erlectin 
inhibits transport of Krm2 to the cell surface. Analysis of its embryonic 
expression pattern in Xenopus reveals that Erlectin is member of the endoplasmic 
reticulum synexpression group. Erlectin morpholino antisense injection leads to 
head and axial defects during organogenesis stages in Xenopus embryos. The 
results indicate that Erlectin functions in N-glycan recognition in the 
endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that it may regulate glycoprotein traffic.
