Aggregating evidence suggests that genetic determinants play a pivotal role in 
the pathogenesis of the congenitally bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). BAV is of 
pronounced genetic heterogeneity, and the genetic components underlying BAV in 
an overwhelming majority of patients remain elusive. In the current study, the 
whole coding exons and adjacent introns, as well as 5' and 3' untranslated 
regions of the GATA4 gene, which codes for a zinc-finger transcription factor 
crucial for the normal development of the aortic valve, were screened by direct 
sequencing in 150 index patients with congenital BAV. The available family 
members of an identified mutation carrier and 300 unrelated, ethnically matched 
healthy individuals used as controls were also genotyped for GATA4. The 
functional effect of the mutation was characterized using a dual-luciferase 
reporter assay system. As a result, a novel heterozygous GATA4 mutation, 
p.E147X, was identified in a family with BAV transmitted in an autosomal 
dominant pattern. The nonsense mutation was absent in 600 control chromosomes. 
Functional deciphers revealed that the mutant GATA4 protein lost transcriptional 
activity compared with its wild-type counterpart. Furthermore, the mutation 
disrupted the synergistic transcriptional activation between GATA4 and NKX2.5, 
another transcription factor responsible for BAV. In conclusion, this study 
associates the GATA4 loss-of-function mutation with enhanced susceptibility to a 
BAV, thus providing novel insight into the molecular mechanism underpinning the 
BAV.
