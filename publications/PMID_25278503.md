Human mitochondrial ribosomes are highly divergent from all other known 
ribosomes and are specialized to exclusively translate membrane proteins. They 
are linked with hereditary mitochondrial diseases and are often the unintended 
targets of various clinically useful antibiotics. Using single-particle 
cryogenic electron microscopy, we have determined the structure of its large 
subunit to 3.4 angstrom resolution, revealing 48 proteins, 21 of which are 
specific to mitochondria. The structure unveils an adaptation of the exit tunnel 
for hydrophobic nascent peptides, extensive remodeling of the central 
protuberance, including recruitment of mitochondrial valine transfer RNA 
(tRNA(Val)) to play an integral structural role, and changes in the tRNA binding 
sites related to the unusual characteristics of mitochondrial tRNAs.
