To further understand how the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans defends itself 
against pathogen attack, we analyzed enhanced pathogen resistance (epr) mutants 
obtained from a forward genetic screen. We also examined several 
well-characterized sterile mutants that exhibit an Epr phenotype. We found that 
sterility and pathogen resistance are highly correlated and that resistance in 
both epr and sterile mutants is dependent on DAF-16 activity. Our data indicate 
that a DAF-16-dependent signaling pathway distinct from previously described 
pathways is involved in the activation of genes that confer resistance to 
bacterial pathogens. The timing of DAF-16-dependent gene activation in sterile 
mutants coincides with the onset of embryonic development in wild-type animals, 
suggesting that signals from developing embryos normally downregulate the immune 
response.
