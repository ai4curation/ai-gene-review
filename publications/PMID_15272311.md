BNIP1, a member of the BH3-only protein family, was first discovered as one of 
the proteins that are capable of interacting with the antiapoptotic adenovirus 
E1B 19-kDa protein. Here we disclose a totally unexpected finding that BNIP1 is 
a component of the complex comprising syntaxin 18, an endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER)-located soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein 
(SNAP) receptor (SNARE). Functional analysis revealed that BNIP1 participates in 
the formation of the ER network structure, but not in membrane trafficking 
between the ER and Golgi. Notably, a highly conserved leucine residue in the BH3 
domain of BNIP1 plays an important role not only in the induction of apoptosis 
but also in the binding of alpha-SNAP, an adaptor that serves as a link between 
the chaperone ATPase NSF and SNAREs. This predicts that alpha-SNAP may suppress 
apoptosis by competing with antiapoptotic proteins for the BH3 domain of BNIP1. 
Indeed, overexpression of alpha-SNAP markedly delayed staurosporine-induced 
apoptosis. Our results shed light on possible crosstalk between apparently 
independent cellular events, apoptosis and ER membrane fusion.
