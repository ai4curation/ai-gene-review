A novel lymphocyte-specific immunoglobulin superfamily protein (19A) has been 
cloned. The predicted 335-amino-acid sequence of 19A represents a Type 1 
membrane protein with homology with the CD2 family of receptors. A molecular 
model of the two predicted extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains of 19A has 
been generated using the crystal structure of CD2 as a template. In isolated 
lymphocytes, expression of 19A is induced by various activation stimuli, and 
enforced expression of the 19A gene promotes homotypic cell adhesion in a 
B-cell-line model. Collectively these data imply that the 19A protein plays a 
role in regulation of lymphocyte adhesion.
