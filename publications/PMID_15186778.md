Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release promote 
caspase activation and execution of apoptosis through cleavage of specific 
caspase substrates in the cell. Among the first targets of activated caspases 
are the permeabilized mitochondria themselves, leading to disruption of electron 
transport, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim), decline in 
ATP levels, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and loss of 
mitochondrial structural integrity. Here, we identify NDUFS1, the 75 kDa subunit 
of respiratory complex I, as a critical caspase substrate in the mitochondria. 
Cells expressing a noncleavable mutant of p75 sustain DeltaPsim and ATP levels 
during apoptosis, and ROS production in response to apoptotic stimuli is 
dampened. While cytochrome c release and DNA fragmentation are unaffected by the 
noncleavable p75 mutant, mitochondrial morphology of dying cells is maintained, 
and loss of plasma membrane integrity is delayed. Therefore, caspase cleavage of 
NDUFS1 is required for several mitochondrial changes associated with apoptosis.
