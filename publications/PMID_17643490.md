Subunits of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex are expressed on the surface 
of tumors, bind the TCR of human Vgamma9/Vdelta2 lymphocytes and promote their 
cytotoxicity. Present experiments show that detection of the complex (called 
ecto-F1-ATPase) at the cell surface by immunofluorescence correlates with low 
MHC-class I antigen expression. Strikingly, the alpha and beta chains of 
ecto-F1-ATPase are detected in membrane protein precipitates from 
immunofluorescence-negative cells, suggesting that ATPase epitopes are masked. 
Removal of beta2-microglobulin by mild acid treatment so that most surface MHC-I 
molecules become free heavy chains reveals F1-ATPase epitopes on MHC-I+ cell 
lines. Ecto-F1-ATPase is detected by immunofluorescence on primary fibroblasts 
which express moderate levels of MHC-I antigens. Up-regulation of MHC-I on these 
cells following IFN-gamma and/or TNF-alpha treatment induces a dose-dependent 
disappearance of F1-ATPase epitopes. Finally, biotinylated F1-ATPase cell 
surface components co-immunoprecipitate with MHC-I molecules confirming the 
association of both complexes on Raji cells. Confocal microscopy analysis of 
MHC-I and ecto-F1-ATPase beta chain expression on HepG2 cells shows a 
co-localization of both complexes in punctate membrane domains. This 
demonstrates that the TCR target F1-ATPase is in close contact with MHC-I 
antigens which are known to control Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cell activity through 
binding to natural killer inhibitory receptors.
