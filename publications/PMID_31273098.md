The N-terminal residue influences protein stability through N-degron pathways. 
We used stability profiling of the human N-terminome to uncover multiple 
additional features of N-degron pathways. In addition to uncovering extended 
specificities of UBR E3 ligases, we characterized two related Cullin-RING E3 
ligase complexes, Cul2ZYG11B and Cul2ZER1, that act redundantly to target 
N-terminal glycine. N-terminal glycine degrons are depleted at native N-termini 
but strongly enriched at caspase cleavage sites, suggesting roles for the 
substrate adaptors ZYG11B and ZER1 in protein degradation during apoptosis. 
Furthermore, ZYG11B and ZER1 were found to participate in the quality control of 
N-myristoylated proteins, in which N-terminal glycine degrons are conditionally 
exposed after a failure of N-myristoylation. Thus, an additional N-degron 
pathway specific for glycine regulates the stability of metazoan proteomes.
