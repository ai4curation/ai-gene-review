Eighteen human histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been identified, and according 
to their sequence similarity to yeast homologs, these enzymes are grouped into 
distinct classes. Within class II, HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9 share similar 
domain organization both within the N-terminal extension and the C-terminal 
catalytic domain, thus forming a subclass known as class IIa. These HDACs 
function as signal-responsive transcriptional corepressors. To gain further 
insight into their function and regulation, we utilized an N-terminal fragment 
of HDAC4 as bait in yeast two-hybrid screens, which uncovered myocyte enhancer 
factor 2C, 14-3-3zeta, and ankyrin repeat family A protein (ANKRA). ANKRA is a 
poorly characterized protein with an ankyrin repeat domain similar to RFXANK, a 
subunit of the trimeric transcription factor RFX. Mutations on genes of the RFX 
subunits and the coactivator CIITA are responsible for the bare lymphocyte 
syndrome, an immunodeficiency disorder attributed to the lack of major 
histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) antigens. Through its ankyrin repeat 
domain, RFXANK interacted with HDAC4. Two RFXANK-binding sites were found on 
HDAC4 with one located within residues 118-279 and another within residues 
448-666. Interestingly, this deacetylase also interacted with CIITA. Consistent 
with the physical interaction with RFXANK and CIITA, HDAC4 and homologs 
repressed MHCII expression. These results identify ANKRA, RFXANK, and CIITA as 
novel targets of class IIa HDACs and suggest that these deacetylases play a role 
in regulating MHCII expression.
