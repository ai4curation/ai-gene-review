c-Myc.

Simian virus 40 (SV40) is a tumor virus and its early gene product large 
T-antigen (LT) is responsible for the transforming activity of SV40. Parkinson's 
disease causative gene DJ-1 is also a ras-dependent oncogene, but the mechanism 
of its oncogene function is still not known. In this study, we found that there 
were no transformed foci when fibroblasts from DJ-1-knockout mice were 
transfected with LT. We also found that DJ-1 directly bound to LT and that the 
expression level of c-Myc in transformed cells was parallel to that of DJ-1. 
These findings indicate that DJ-1 is essential for SV40 transformation.
