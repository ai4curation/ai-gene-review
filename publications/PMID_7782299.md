The bacteriophage T4 dam gene, encoding the Dam DNA 
[N6-adenine]methyltransferase (MTase), has been subcloned into the plasmid 
expression vector, pJW2. In this construct, designated pINT4dam, transcription 
is from the regulatable phage lambda pR and pL promoters, arranged in tandem. A 
two-step purification scheme using DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose columns 
in series, followed by hydroxyapatite chromatography, was developed to purify 
the enzyme to near homogeneity. The yield of purified protein was 2 mg/g of cell 
paste. The MTase has an s20,w of 3.0 S and a Stokes radius of 23 A and exists in 
solution as a monomer. The Km for the methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine, is 0.1 
x 10(-6) M, and the Km for substrate nonglucosylated, unmethylated T4 gt- dam 
DNA is 1.1 x 10(-12) M. The products of DNA methylation, 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and methylated DNA, are competitive inhibitors of the 
reaction; Ki values of 2.4 x 10(-6) M and 4.6 x 10(-12) M, respectively, were 
observed. T4 Dam methylates the palindromic tetranucleotide, GATC, designated 
the canonical sequence. However, at high MTase:DNA ratios, T4 Dam can methylate 
some noncanonical sequences belonging to GAY (where Y represents cytosine or 
thymine).
