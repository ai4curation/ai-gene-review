The human CDC2L5 gene encodes a protein of unknown physiological function. This 
protein is closely related to the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdks) family and 
contains an arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain. The Cdks were first identified as 
crucial regulators of cell-cycle progression, more recently they were found to 
be involved in transcription and mRNA processing. RS domains are mainly present 
in proteins regulating pre-mRNA splicing, suggesting CDC2L5 having a possible 
role in this process. In this study, we demonstrate that CDC2L5 is located in 
the nucleoplasm, at a higher concentration in speckles, the storage sites for 
splicing factors. Furthermore, this localization is dependent on the presence of 
the N-terminal sequence including the RS domain. Then, we report that CDC2L5 
directly interacts with the ASF/SF2-associated protein p32, a protein involved 
in splicing regulation. Overexpression of CDC2L5 constructs disturbs 
constitutive splicing and switches alternative splice site selection in vivo. 
These results argue in favor of a functional role of the CDC2L5 kinase in 
splicing regulation.
