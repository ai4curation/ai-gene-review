Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is the prototype of the ErbB (HER) family 
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which regulate cell growth and differentiation 
and are implicated in many human cancers. EGF activates its receptor by inducing 
dimerization of the 621 amino acid EGF receptor extracellular region. We 
describe the 2.8 A resolution crystal structure of this entire extracellular 
region (sEGFR) in an unactivated state. The structure reveals an autoinhibited 
configuration, where the dimerization interface recently identified in activated 
sEGFR structures is completely occluded by intramolecular interactions. To 
activate the receptor, EGF binding must promote a large domain rearrangement 
that exposes this dimerization interface. This contrasts starkly with other RTK 
activation mechanisms and suggests new approaches for designing ErbB receptor 
antagonists.
