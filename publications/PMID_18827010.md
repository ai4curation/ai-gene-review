Mitochondrial homeostasis reflects a dynamic balance between membrane fission 
and fusion events thought essential for mitochondrial function. We report here 
that altered expression of the C. elegans BCL2 homolog CED-9 affects both 
mitochondrial fission and fusion. Although striated muscle cells lacking CED-9 
have no alteration in mitochondrial size or ultrastructure, these cells appear 
more sensitive to mitochondrial fragmentation. By contrast, increased CED-9 
expression in these cells produces highly interconnected mitochondria. This 
mitochondrial phenotype is partially suppressed by increased expression of the 
dynamin-related GTPase DRP-1, with suppression dependent on the BH3 binding 
pocket of CED-9. This suppression suggests that CED-9 directly regulates DRP-1, 
a model supported by our finding that CED-9 activates the GTPase activity of 
human DRP1. Thus, CED-9 is capable of regulating the mitochondrial 
fission-fusion cycle but is not essential for either fission or fusion.
