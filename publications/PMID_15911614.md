The extremely acidic environment of the mammalian stomach, with a pH range 
usually between 1 and 3, represents a stressful challenge for enteric pathogenic 
bacteria such as Escherichia coli before they enter into the intestine. The hdeA 
gene of E. coli was found to be acid inducible and was revealed by genetic 
studies to be important for the acid survival of the strain. This study was 
performed in an attempt to characterize the mechanism of the activity of the 
HdeA protein. Our data provided in this report strongly suggest that HdeA 
employs a novel strategy to modulate its chaperone activity: it possesses an 
ordered conformation that is unable to bind denatured substrate proteins under 
normal physiological conditions (i.e. at neutral pH) and transforms into a 
globally disordered conformation that is able to bind substrate proteins under 
stress conditions (i.e. at a pH below 3). Furthermore, our data indicate that 
HdeA exposes hydrophobic surfaces that appear to be involved in the binding of 
denatured substrate proteins at extremely low pH values. In light of our 
observations, models are proposed to explain the action of HdeA in both a 
physiological and a molecular context.
