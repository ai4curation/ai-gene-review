Epilepsy is estimated to affect 1-2% of the world population, yet remains poorly 
understood at a molecular level. We have previously established the roundworm 
Caenorhabditis elegans as a model for investigating genetic susceptibilities to 
seizure-like convulsions in vivo. Here we investigate the behavioral 
consequences of decreasing the activity of nematode gene homologs within the 
LIS1 pathway that are associated with a human cortical malformation termed 
lissencephaly. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the nud-2 gene, encoding the worm 
homolog of mammalian effectors of LIS1, termed NDE1 and NDEL1. Phenotypic 
analysis of animals targeted by RNA interference (RNAi) was performed using a 
pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) exposure paradigm to induce convulsions. Worms depleted 
for LIS1 pathway components (NUD-1, NUD-2, DHC-1, CDK-5, and CDKA-1) exhibited 
significant convulsions following PTZ and RNAi treatment. Strains harboring 
fluorescent markers for GABAergic neuronal architecture and synaptic vesicle 
trafficking were employed to discern putative mechanisms accounting for observed 
convulsion behaviors. We found that depletion of LIS1 pathway components 
resulted in defective GABA synaptic vesicle trafficking. We also utilized 
combinations of specific genetic backgrounds to create a sensitized state for 
convulsion susceptibility and discovered that convulsion effects were 
significantly enhanced when LIS-1 and other pathway components were compromised 
within the same animals. Thus, interactions among gene products with LIS-1 may 
mediate intrinsic thresholds of neuronal synchrony.
