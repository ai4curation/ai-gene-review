Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) is an enzyme of intermediary metabolism that 
converts 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate in glycolysis. Here, we 
discovered PGAM5 that is anchored in the mitochondrial membrane lacks PGAM 
activity and instead associates with the MAP kinase kinase kinase ASK1 and acts 
as a specific protein Ser/Thr phosphatase that activates ASK1 by 
dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites. Mutation of an active site His-105 in 
PGAM5 abolished phosphatase activity with ASK1 and phospho-Thr peptides as 
substrates. The Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans orthologs of PGAM5 also 
exhibit specific Ser/Thr phosphatase activity and activate the corresponding 
Drosophila and C. elegans ASK1 kinases. PGAM5 is unrelated to the other known 
Ser/Thr phosphatases of the PPP, MPP, and FCP families, and our results suggest 
that this member of the PGAM family has crossed over from small molecules to 
protein substrates and been adapted to serve as a specialized activator of ASK1.
