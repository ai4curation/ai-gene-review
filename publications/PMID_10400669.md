The interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR is the 
prototype of a class of double-stranded (dsRNA)-binding proteins (DRBPs) which 
share a dsRNA-binding motif conserved from Drosophila to humans. Here we report 
the purification of DRBP76, a new human member of this class of proteins. 
Sequence from the amino terminus of DRBP76 matched that of the M phase-specific 
protein, MPP4. DRBP76 was also cloned by the yeast two-hybrid screening of a 
cDNA library using a mutant PKR as bait. Analysis of the cDNA sequence revealed 
that it is the full-length version of MPP4, has a bipartite nuclear localization 
signal, two motifs that can mediate interactions with both dsRNA and PKR, five 
epitopes for potential M phase-specific phosphorylation, two potential sites for 
phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases, a RG2 motif present in many 
RNA-binding proteins and predicts a protein of 76 kDa. DsRNA and PKR 
interactions of DRBP76 were confirmed by analysis of in vitro translated and 
purified native proteins. Cellular expression of an epitope-tagged DRBP76 
demonstrated its nuclear localization, and its co-immunoprecipitation with PKR 
demonstrated that the two proteins interact in vivo. Finally, purified DRBP76 
was shown to be a substrate of PKR in vitro, indicating that this protein's 
cellular activities may be regulated by PKR-mediated phosphorylation.
