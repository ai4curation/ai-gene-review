Nutrient starvation or rapamycin treatment, through inhibition of target of 
rapamycin, causes condensation of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) array and nucleolar 
contraction in budding yeast. Here we report that under such conditions, 
condensin is rapidly relocated into the nucleolus and loaded to rDNA tandem 
repeats, which is required for rDNA condensation. Rpd3-dependent histone 
deacetylation is necessary and sufficient for condensin's relocalization and 
loading to rDNA array, suggesting that histone modification plays a regulatory 
role for condensin targeting. Rapamycin independently, yet coordinately, 
inhibits rDNA transcription and promotes condensin loading to rDNA array. 
Unexpectedly, we found that inhibition of rDNA transcription in the absence of 
condensin loading leads to rDNA instability. Our data suggest that enrichment of 
condensin prevents rDNA instability during nutrient starvation. Together, these 
observations unravel a novel role for condensin in the maintenance of regional 
genomic stability.
