Bcl-2 is a cytoplasmic protein that blocks apoptosis in a wide variety of cell 
types. Here we report a novel role for Bcl-2 in the early stages of neuronal 
development. Shortly after differentiating from progenitor cells, sensory 
neurons undergo a distinct morphological change; initially they have small, 
spindle-shaped, phase-dark cell bodies that become large, spherical, and 
phase-bright. Early sensory neurons cultured from the trigeminal ganglia of 
bcl-2-/- embryos at embryonic day 11 (E11) and E12 underwent this change more 
slowly than trigeminal neurons of wild-type embryos of the same ages. The delay 
was not attributable to the well documented role of Bcl-2 in preventing 
apoptosis, because Bcl-2-deficient early sensory neurons survived as well as 
wild-type neurons. Accordingly, there was a significantly smaller number of the 
more mature type of neuron in the early trigeminal ganglia of bcl-2-/- embryos, 
yet the number of neurons in the trigeminal ganglia of bcl-2-/- and wild-type 
embryos was similar. The absence of Bcl-2 did not cause a uniform delay in the 
developmental program of sensory neurons, because the time course of nerve 
growth factor receptor expression (both trkA and p75) was unaffected in the 
trigeminal neurons of bcl-2-/- embryos. These findings indicate that Bcl-2 
expression is required for the normal progression of a particular early 
maturational change in embryonic sensory neurons.
