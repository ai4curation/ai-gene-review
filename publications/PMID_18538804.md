Hydroponic isotope labelling of entire plants (HILEP) is a cost-effective method 
enabling metabolic labelling of whole and mature plants with a stable isotope 
such as (15)N. By utilising hydroponic media that contain (15)N inorganic salts 
as the sole nitrogen source, near to 100% (15)N-labelling of proteins can be 
achieved. In this study, it is shown that HILEP, in combination with mass 
spectrometry, is suitable for relative protein quantitation of seven week-old 
Arabidopsis plants submitted to oxidative stress. Protein extracts from pooled 
(14)N- and (15)N-hydroponically grown plants were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, 
digested and analysed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Proteins were identified and the spectra of 
(14)N/(15)N peptide pairs were extracted using their m/z chromatographic 
retention time, isotopic distributions, and the m/z difference between the (14)N 
and (15)N peptides. Relative amounts were calculated as the ratio of the sum of 
the peak areas of the two distinct (14)N and (15)N peptide isotope envelopes. 
Using Mascot and the open source trans-proteomic pipeline (TPP), the data 
processing was automated for global proteome quantitation down to the isoform 
level by extracting isoform specific peptides. With this combination of 
metabolic labelling and mass spectrometry it was possible to show differential 
protein expression in the apoplast of plants submitted to oxidative stress. 
Moreover, it was possible to discriminate between differentially expressed 
isoforms belonging to the same protein family, such as isoforms of xylanases and 
pathogen-related glucanases (PR 2).
