Cranial neural crest cells (NCCs) play an intimate role in craniofacial 
development. Multiple signaling cascades participate in patterning cranial NCCs, 
some of which are regulated by endothelin-A receptor (Ednra) signaling. 
Ednra(-/-) embryos die at birth from severe craniofacial defects resulting from 
disruption of neural crest cell patterning and differentiation. These defects 
include homeotic transformation of lower jaw structures into upper jaw-like 
structures, suggesting that some cephalic NCCs alter their "identity" in the 
absence of Ednra signaling. To elucidate the temporal necessity for Ednra 
signaling in vivo, we undertook two strategies. We first used a conditional 
knockout strategy in which mice containing a conditionally targeted Ednra allele 
(Ednra(fl)) were bred with mice from the Hand2-Cre and Wnt1-Cre transgenic mouse 
strains, two strains in which Cre expression occurs at different time periods 
within cranial NCCs. In our second approach, we used an Ednra-specific 
antagonist to treat wild type pregnant mice between embryonic days E8.0 and 
E10.0, a time frame encompassing the early migration and proliferation of 
cranial NCCs. The combined results suggest that Ednra function is crucial for 
NCC development between E8.25 and E9.0, a time period encompassing the arrival 
of NCCs in the arches and/or early post-migratory patterning. After this time 
period, Ednra signaling is dispensable. Interestingly, middle ear structures are 
enlarged and malformed in a majority of Ednra(fl/fl);Wnt1-Cre embryos, instead 
resembling structures found in extinct predecessors of mammals. These 
observations suggest that the advent of Ednra signaling in cranial NCCs may have 
been a crucial event in the evolution of the mammalian middle ear ossicles.
