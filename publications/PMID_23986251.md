The synaptic toxicity of soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers plays a critical role 
in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report that 
overexpressed α1-takusan, which we previously identified as a protein that 
enhances synaptic activity via interaction with PSD-95, mitigates oligomeric 
Aβ-induced synaptic loss. In contrast, takusan knockdown results in enhanced 
synaptic damage. α1-Takusan interacts with tau either directly or indirectly, 
and prevents Aβ-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and mitochondrial 
fragmentation. Deletion analysis identified the second domain (D2) within the 
takusan protein that is required for PSD-95 clustering and synaptic protection 
from Aβ. A 51 aa sequence linking D2 to the PDZ-binding C terminus was found to 
be as effective as full-length takusan in protecting synapses from Aβ-induced 
damage. Moreover, a sequence containing the D2 from the human protein discs 
large homolog 5, when linked to a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, can also 
increase the clustering of PSD-95 in cortical dendrites. In summary, α1-takusan 
protects synapses from Aβ-induced insult via interaction with PSD-95 and tau. 
Thus, takusan-based protein sequences from either mouse or human may be of 
potential therapeutic benefit in AD.
