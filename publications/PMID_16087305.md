Wolfram Syndrome is an autosomal recessive degenerative disorder of the 
neuroendocrine system. Diabetes mellitus is its lead symptom. Patients show 
mutations in the wolframin (WFS1) gene coding for a hydrophobic transmembrane 
protein of 890 amino acids. This protein was preliminarily localised in the 
endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) in cells of mice and rats. Mice lacking the WFS1 
gene display degeneration of pancreatic beta-cells following induction of ER 
stress. We here used antibodies against substructures of the wolframin protein 
in order to analyse its expression and localisation. Expression was detected in 
both pancreatic beta-cells and the limbic system of mice. Using the rat 
insulinoma cell line RIN 5AH and fractionated mouse brain tissue, we confirmed 
wolframin localisation to the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression profiling on 
patient's primary fibroblasts revealed down-regulation of the diabetes 
associated plasma membrane glycoprotein (PC-1) gene, and up-regulation of 
fibulin-3, a gene connected to senescence. However, cell proliferation was 
indistinguishable from non-mutated cells. In contrast to data obtained on murine 
pancreatic islets, we found no increased apoptosis following induction of ER 
stress but rather by staurosporine treatment in the absence of WFS1 function. 
This indicates a new role of WFS1 deficiency in programmed cell death.
