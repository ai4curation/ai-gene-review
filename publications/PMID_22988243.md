Malectin is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident lectin, which recognizes 
di-glucosylated Glc(2)Man(9)GlcNAc(2) (G2M9) N-glycans on newly synthesized 
glycoproteins. We previously demonstrated that malectin preferentially 
associates with misfolded glycoproteins and inhibits their secretion (Chen, Y., 
Hu, D., Yabe, R., Tateno, H., Qin, S. Y., Matsumoto, N., Hirabayashi, J., and 
Yamamoto, K. (2011) Mol. Biol. Cell 22, 3559-3570). The sugar binding activity 
of malectin is required for this process. However, because G2M9 N-glycans are 
generated at the very early stage of processing and are typically found on both 
misfolded glycoproteins and glycoproteins undergoing folding, other mechanisms 
must underlie the preference of malectin for misfolded glycoproteins. Here, we 
searched for proteins that were co-immunoprecipitated with malectin, and we 
found that malectin formed a stable complex with an endoplasmic 
reticulum-resident transmembrane protein, ribophorin I. Co-expression of 
malectin and ribophorin I significantly enhanced the association between 
malectin and a folding-defective α1-antitrypsin variant (null Hong Kong) and 
reduced its secretion; however, secretion of wild-type α1-antitrypsin was not 
affected. The enhanced association and reduced secretion were counteracted by 
siRNA-mediated down-regulation of ribophorin I. Also, a reporter assay revealed 
that ribophorin I preferentially interacted with misfolded ribonuclease A but 
not with the native form, suggesting that ribophorin I may function as a 
chaperone that recognizes misfolded proteins inside cells. These results provide 
the first evidence of the mechanism by which malectin preferentially associates 
with misfolded glycoproteins.
