TSC2, or tuberin, is the product of the tuberous sclerosis tumor suppressor gene 
TSC2 and acts downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling 
pathway to negatively regulate cellular growth. One mechanism underlying its 
function is to assemble into a heterodimer with the TSC1 gene product TSC1, or 
hamartin, resulting in a reduction in phosphorylation, and hence activation, of 
the ribosomal subunit S6 kinase (S6K). We identified a novel interaction between 
TSC2 and 14-3-3beta. We found that 14-3-3beta does not interfere with TSC1-TSC2 
binding and can form a ternary complex with these two proteins. Association 
between 14-3-3beta and TSC2 requires phosphorylation of TSC2 at a unique residue 
that is not a known Akt phosphorylation site. The overexpression of 14-3-3beta 
compromises the ability of the TSC1-TSC2 complex to reduce S6K phosphorylation. 
The antagonistic activity of 14-3-3beta toward TSC is dependent on the 
14-3-3beta-TSC2 interaction, since a mutant of TSC2 that is not recognized by 
14-3-3beta is refractory to 14-3-3beta. We suggest that 14-3-3 proteins interact 
with the TSC1-TSC2 complex and negatively regulate the function of the TSC 
proteins.
