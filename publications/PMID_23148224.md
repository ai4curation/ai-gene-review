In pulmonary hypertension the loss of precapillary arterioles results from 
vascular injury causing endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial cell migration and 
proliferation are critical for vascular regeneration. This study focused on the 
effect of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) on these critical processes. 
HMGB1 had no effect on human pulmonary artery endothelial cell (HPAEC) 
proliferation. In contrast, treatment of HPAECs with HMGB1 dose-dependently 
inhibited VEGF-stimulated HPAEC migration. The effect of HMGB1 on HPAEC 
migration was TLR4-dependent because it was reversed by TLR4 siRNA or 
TLR4-neutralizing antibody. Exposure of HPAECs to hypoxia caused translocation 
and release of HMGB1 and inhibition of HPAEC migration. The effect of hypoxia on 
HPAEC migration was mediated by HMGB1 because HMGB1-neutralizing antibody but 
not control IgG restored HPAEC migration. Likewise, TLR4 siRNA but not control 
siRNA reversed the inhibitory effect of hypoxia in HPAECs. The canonical TLR4 
signaling pathway requires the adaptor protein MyD88 and leads to downstream 
NFκB activation. Interestingly, HMGB1 failed to stimulate NFκB translocation to 
the nucleus, but instead activated an alternative pathway characterized by 
activation of interferon response factor 3 (IRF3). This was in contrast to human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells in which HMGB1 stimulated nuclear translocation 
of NFκB but not IRF3. IRF3 siRNA, but not MyD88 siRNA, reversed the inhibitory 
effect of HMGB1 on HPAEC migration. These data demonstrate that HMGB1 inhibits 
HPAEC migration, a critical process for vascular regeneration, via TLR4- and 
IRF3-dependent mechanisms.
