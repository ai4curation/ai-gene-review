Cytokinesis in fission yeast involves the coordination of septum deposition with 
the contraction of a cytokinetic actomyosin ring. We have examined the role of 
the type V myosin Myo52 in the coupling of these two events by the construction 
of a series of deletion mutants of the Myo52 tail and a further mutant within 
the ATP binding domain of the head. Each mutant protein was ectopically 
expressed in fission yeast cells. Each truncation was assayed for the ability to 
localize to the cell poles and septum (the normal cellular locations of Myo52) 
and to rescue the morphology defects and temperature sensitivity of a myo52Delta 
strain. A region within the Myo52 tail (amino acids 1320-1503), with a high 
degree of similarity to the vesicle-binding domain of the budding yeast type V 
myosin Myo2p, was essential for Myo52's role in the maintenance of growth 
polarity and cell division. A separate region (amino acids 1180-1320) was 
required for Myo52 foci to move throughout the cytoplasm; however, constructs 
lacking this region, but which retained the ability to dimerize still associated 
with actin at sites of cell growth. Not all of the Myo52 truncations which 
localized rescued the morphological defects of myo52Delta, demonstrating that 
loss of function was not simply brought about by an inability of mutant proteins 
to target the correct cellular location. By contrast, Myo52 motor activity was 
required for both localization and cellular function. myo52Delta cells were 
unable to efficiently localize the beta-1,3-glucan synthase, Bgs1, either at the 
cell poles or at the division septum, regions of cell wall deposition. Bgs1 and 
Myo52 localized to vesicle-like dots at the poles in interphase and these moved 
together to the septum at division. These data have led to the formulation of a 
model in which Myo52 is responsible for the delivery of Bgs1 and associated 
molecules to polar cell growth regions during interphase. On the commencement of 
septum formation, Myo52 transports Bgs1 to the cell equator, thus ensuring the 
accurate deposition of beta-1,3-glucan at the leading edge of the primary 
septum.
