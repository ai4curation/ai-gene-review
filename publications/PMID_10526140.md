The pathological process in Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves amyloid beta 
(Abeta) deposition and neuronal cell degeneration. The neurotoxic Abeta peptide 
is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a member of a larger gene 
family including the amyloid precursor-like proteins, APLP1 and APLP2. The APP 
and APLP2 molecules contain metal binding sites for copper and zinc. The zinc 
binding domain (ZnBD) is believed to have a structural rather than a catalytic 
role. The activity of the copper binding domain (CuBD) is unknown, however, APP 
reduces copper (II) to copper (I) and this activity could promote 
copper-mediated neurotoxicity. The expression of APP and APLP2 in the brain 
suggests they could have an important direct or indirect role in neuronal metal 
homeostasis. To examine this, we measured copper, zinc and iron levels in the 
cerebral cortex, cerebellum and selected non-neuronal tissues from APP 
(APP(-/-)) and APLP2 (APLP2(-/-)) knockout mice using atomic absorption 
spectrophotometry. Compared with matched wild-type (WT) mice, copper levels were 
significantly elevated in both APP(-/-) and APLP2(-/-) cerebral cortex (40% and 
16%, respectively) and liver (80% and 36%, respectively). Copper levels were not 
significantly different between knockout and WT cerebellum, spleen or serum 
samples. There were no significant differences observed between APP(-/-), 
APLP2(-/-) and WT mice zinc or iron levels in any tissue examined. These 
findings indicate APP and APLP2 expression specifically modulates copper 
homeostasis in the liver and cerebral cortex, the latter being a region of the 
brain particularly involved in AD. Perturbations to APP metabolism and in 
particular, its secretion or release from neurons may alter copper homeostasis 
resulting in increased Abeta accumulation and free radical generation. These 
data support a novel mechanism in the APP/Abeta pathway which leads to AD.
