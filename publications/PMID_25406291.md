PURPOSE: Mutations in human fibrillin-1 and -2, which are major constituents of 
tissue microfibrils, can affect multiple ocular components, including the 
ciliary zonule, lens, drainage apparatus, cornea, and retina. However, the 
expression pattern of the three human fibrillins and an integral microfibrillar 
component, MAGP1, during human eye development is not known.
METHODS: We analyzed sections from human eyes at gestational weeks (GWs) 6, 8, 
and 11 and at 1 and 3 years of age with antibodies specific for each human 
fibrillin isoform or MAGP1, using immunofluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: During embryonic development, each fibrillin isoform was detected in 
vascular structures bridging the ciliary body and the developing lens, hyaloid 
vasculature, and retina. In addition, they were present in the developing 
corneal basement membranes and lens capsule. MAGP1 codistributed with the 
fibrillin isoforms. In contrast, the juvenile zonule was composed of fibrillin-1 
microfibrils containing MAGP1, but fibrillin-2 was absent and fibrillin-3 was 
only sparsely detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Fibrillin-1, -2, and, unique to humans, fibrillin-3 are found in 
various ocular structures during human embryonic eye development, whereas 
fibrillin-1 dominates the postnatal zonule. We speculate that vasculature 
spanning the ciliary body and lens, which elaborates fibrillin-2 and -3, may 
provide an initial scaffold for fibrillin assembly and zonule formation.
