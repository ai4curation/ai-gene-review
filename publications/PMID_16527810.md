Iron-sulfur clusters are prosthetic groups composed of sulfur and iron that are 
found in respiratory chain complexes and numerous enzymes. Iron-sulfur clusters 
are synthesized in a multistep process that utilizes cysteine desulfurases, 
scaffold proteins, chaperones, and iron donors. Assembly of iron-sulfur clusters 
occurs in the mitochondrial matrix of mammalian cells, but cytosolic isoforms of 
three major mammalian iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly components have been 
found, raising the possibility that de novo iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis also 
occurs in cytosol. The human cysteine desulfurase, ISCS, has two isoforms, one 
of which targets to the mitochondria, whereas the other less abundant form is 
cytosolic and nuclear. The open-reading frame of cytosolic mammalian ISCS begins 
at the second AUG of the transcript and lacks mitochondrial targeting 
information. Yeast complementation experiments have suggested that the human 
cytosolic ISCS isoform (c-ISCS) cannot be functional. To evaluate function of 
c-ISCS, we overexpressed the human cytosolic ISCS in yeast Pichia pastoris and 
showed that the cytosolic form of ISCS is an active cysteine desulfurase that 
covalently binds 35S acquired from desulfuration of radiolabeled cysteine. Human 
cytosolic ISCS dimerized as efficiently as bacterial ISCS and formed a complex 
in vitro with overexpressed cytosolic human ISCU. When incubated with iron 
regulatory protein 1, cysteine, and iron, the cytosolic forms of ISCS and ISCU 
facilitated efficient formation of a [4Fe-4S] cluster on IRP1. Thus, the 
cytosolic form of ISCS is a functional cysteine desulfurase that can collaborate 
with cytosolic ISCU to promote de novo iron-sulfur cluster formation.
