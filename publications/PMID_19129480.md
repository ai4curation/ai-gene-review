The last steps of multivesicular body (MVB) formation, human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV)-1 budding and cytokinesis require a functional endosomal sorting 
complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery to facilitate topologically 
equivalent membrane fission events. Increased sodium tolerance (IST) 1, a new 
positive modulator of the ESCRT pathway, has been described recently, but an 
essential function of this highly conserved protein has not been identified. 
Here, we describe the previously uncharacterized KIAA0174 as the human homologue 
of IST1 (hIST1), and we report its conserved interaction with VPS4, CHMP1A/B, 
and LIP5. We also identify a microtubule interacting and transport (MIT) domain 
interacting motif (MIM) in hIST1 that is necessary for its interaction with 
VPS4, LIP5 and other MIT domain-containing proteins, namely, MITD1, AMSH, UBPY, 
and Spastin. Importantly, hIST1 is essential for cytokinesis in mammalian cells 
but not for HIV-1 budding, thus providing a novel mechanism of functional 
diversification of the ESCRT machinery. Last, we show that the hIST1 MIM 
activity is essential for cytokinesis, suggesting possible mechanisms to explain 
the role of hIST1 in the last step of mammalian cell division.

Abstract

The last steps of multivesicular body (MVB) formation, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 budding and cytokinesis require a functional endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery to facilitate topologically equivalent membrane fission events. Increased sodium tolerance ( IST ) 1 , a new positive modulator of the ESCRT pathway, has been described recently, but an essential function of this highly conserved protein has not been identified. Here, we describe the previously uncharacterized KIAA0174 as the human homologue of IST1 (hIST1), and we report its conserved interaction with VPS4, CHMP1A/B, and LIP5. We also identify a microtubule interacting and transport (MIT) domain interacting motif (MIM) in hIST1 that is necessary for its interaction with VPS4, LIP5 and other MIT domain-containing proteins, namely, MITD1, AMSH, UBPY, and Spastin. Importantly, hIST1 is essential for cytokinesis in mammalian cells but not for HIV-1 budding, thus providing a novel mechanism of functional diversification of the ESCRT machinery. Last, we show that the hIST1 MIM activity is essential for cytokinesis, suggesting possible mechanisms to explain the role of hIST1 in the last step of mammalian cell division.

INTRODUCTION

Multivesicular bodies (MVBs) are endocytic organelles characterized by their ability to bud away from the cytosol to generate intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). The MVB is a major protein sorting station in the cell, in which specific membrane proteins are sorted into the ILVs, whereas others remain on the limiting membrane. The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery mediates sorting of ubiquitinated cargo proteins into the forming ILVs ( Gruenberg and Stenmark, 2004 ; Hurley and Emr, 2006 ). These sorting and vesicle formation events require the sequential assembly of ESCRT-I, -II, and -III on the endosomal membranes, and the whole process is regulated by the essential activity of VPS4, an AAA-ATPase that mediates the disassembly of the ESCRT complexes for recycling purposes ( Babst et al. , 1998 ; Katzmann et al. , 2001 ; Babst et al. , 2002a , b ). Thus, spatial and temporal regulation of VPS4 seems essential for the function of the ESCRT machinery. In fact, a conserved mechanism of VPS4 regulation by Vta1/LIP5 has been described, showing that a dimeric form of Vta1 stimulates the ATPase activity of Vps4 by promoting its multimerization into a catalytically active double hexameric ring that pulls the ESCRT complexes into the central channel of the lower ring, releasing the disassembled subunits into the cytoplasm ( Azmi et al. , 2006 , 2008 ; Xiao et al. , 2008 ).

ESCRT-III seems to be the core machinery that mediates the membrane deformation and fission events required for ILV formation during sorting of the ubiquitinated cargo into the MVB ( Hurley and Emr, 2006 ; Hanson et al. , 2008 ). After completion of the process, VPS4 is recruited by ESCRT-III through the direct interaction of the MIT domain in VPS4 with a conserved MIT-interacting motif (MIM) present at the C-terminal region of some of the ESCRT-III subunits ( Obita et al. , 2007 ; Stuchell-Brereton et al. , 2007 ). In addition to binding VPS4, these MIMs coordinate the interaction of ESCRT-III with other activities encoded by MIT domain-containing proteins, such as deubiquitinating enzymes ( Agromayor and Martin-Serrano, 2006 ; McCullough et al. , 2006 ; Tsang et al. , 2006 ; Row et al. , 2007 ). A further regulatory mechanism in the pathway is provided by Vps46/CHMP1A,-1B, a peripherally associated ESCRT-III protein that regulates the interaction of VPS4 with endosomal membranes ( Lottridge et al. , 2006 ; Nickerson et al. , 2006 ).

Many enveloped viruses, including human pathogens such as HIV-1 and Ebola virus, recruit the ESCRT machinery to facilitate the final steps of infectious viral particle formation (reviewed in Demirov and Freed, 2004 ; Morita and Sundquist, 2004 ; Bieniasz, 2006 ), a process that requires a membrane fission event that is topologically identical to MVB formation. An understanding of the MVB protein sorting machinery has provided essential clues to unmasking the cellular machinery recruited by different short amino acid sequences called late budding domains (L-domains). It is now established that many enveloped viruses encode four known types of L-domains (PT/SAP, PP X Y, LYP X L, or FPIV motifs), which use ESCRT-III via the direct interaction with adaptor proteins such as TSG101 (PTAP motif) ( Garrus et al. , 2001 ; Martin-Serrano et al. , 2001 ; VerPlank et al. , 2001 ; Demirov et al. , 2002 ), ALIX (LYPxL motif) ( Martin-Serrano et al. , 2003 ; Strack et al. , 2003 ; von Schwedler et al. , 2003 ), or HECT ubiquitin ligases (PPXY motif) ( Freed, 2002 ; Martin-Serrano, 2007 ) and unknown adaptor (FPIV) ( Schmitt et al. , 2005 ). One emerging theme is the possibility that, in addition to these adaptor proteins, L-domain activity requires only the ESCRT proteins that are involved in membrane fission, as suggested by the fact that ESCRT-II, CHMP6, or AMSH are dispensable for HIV-1 egress ( Agromayor and Martin-Serrano, 2006 ; Langelier et al. , 2006 ).

Recent work has identified a functional requirement for the ESCRT complexes during the last step of cell division, another membrane scission event that is topologically similar to MVB formation and retroviral budding ( Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007 ; Morita et al. , 2007 ; Carlton et al. , 2008 ). Completion of cytokinesis requires abscission of the midbody, a microtubule-rich cytoplasmic bridge that connects the daughter cells preceding their separation ( Glotzer, 2001 ; Barr and Gruneberg, 2007 ). Many proteins required for abscission localize at the Flemming body, a protein-dense structure at the central region of the midbody that also contains interdigitating microtubules ( Eggert et al. , 2006 ). Importantly, the ESCRT components TSG101 and ALIX are recruited to the Flemming body via the interaction with CEP55, a midbody component required for abscission ( Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007 ; Morita et al. , 2007 ; Carlton et al. , 2008 ). Functional studies using small interfering RNA (siRNA) have shown that both Tsg101 and ALIX are required for midbody abscission, and a role for ESCRT-III is also suggested by the inhibition of cytokinesis in cells overexpressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-CHMP4 or a catalytically inactive VPS4 ( Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007 ; Morita et al. , 2007 ; Carlton et al. , 2008 ). More direct evidence supporting the essential role of ESCRT-III in abscission is provided by the cytokinetic defects in cells expressing an ALIX mutant that is specifically mutated in the CHMP4-binding surface ( Morita et al. , 2007 ; Carlton et al. , 2008 ).

We have now identified human increased sodium tolerance (hIST)1 as an evolutionarily conserved component of the mammalian ESCRT machinery that binds to VPS4, LIP5, CHMP1A, and CHMP1B. In agreement with recent reports ( Dimaano et al. , 2008 ; Rue et al. , 2008 ), we show that yeast Ist1 is not essential for endosomal sorting, although a synthetic interaction with Vta1 is observed, suggesting that Ist1 is a positive modulator of the class E vps pathway. We also demonstrate a specific requirement of hIST1 for cytokinesis in mammalian cells but not for HIV-1 budding, showing a novel mechanism of functional diversification in the ESCRT pathway. We show for the first time that the function of hIST1 in the last step of mammalian cell division requires a novel MIM capable of binding to a wide array of MIT-containing proteins.

DISCUSSION

In the present study, we characterize KIAA0174, a human protein of previously unknown function, as the homologue of S. cerevisiae Ist1; thus, we have named it hIST1. We also describe the conserved interaction of hIST1 with several components of the ESCRT machinery, namely, CHMP1A, -1B, VPS4, and LIP5. Remarkably, hIST1 binds the yeast homologues of CHMP1A/B, VPS4 and LIP5, and the converse interactions were also observed with yeast Ist1, suggesting a highly conserved function of IST1 in the ESCRT pathway. In despite of this functional conservation, the data presented in this and other studies ( Dimaano et al. , 2008 ; Rue et al. , 2008 ) show that ist1 Δ yeasts present no obvious phenotype in endosomal cargo sorting, perhaps explaining why IST1 was not identified in previous genetic screens. The functional studies in human cells also show a nonessential role of hIST1 in endosomal sorting and HIV-1 budding. Interestingly, hIST knockdown by RNAi in mammalian cells has revealed an essential role of hIST1 in late events of cytokinesis, but yeast strains lacking IST1 or essential components of the ESCRT machinery do not exhibit apparent defects in cell growth, suggesting that the role of IST1 and the ESCRT complexes may not be conserved in yeast cell division. The high degree of sequence and functional conservation, together with the lack of a phenotype in ist1 Δ yeasts, raises the possibility that IST1 might also play an essential role in currently unidentified biological processes other than MVB formation in eukaryotic cells.

The genetic interaction of IST1 with VTA1 has been observed in this and recent studies ( Dimaano et al. , 2008 ; Rue et al. , 2008 ), suggesting a role of IST1 as a positive regulator of the MVB protein sorting pathway. Indeed, extensive genetic analyses suggest that Ist1-Vps46 and Vta1-Vps60 form two separate functional complexes that provide alternative ways to modulate late events during MVB sorting ( Rue et al. , 2008 ). An additional negative regulation of the cytoplasmic pool of Vps4 by Ist1 has also been reported and a competition of Ist1 with Vta1 for binding Vps4 has been proposed to explain the negative regulation of Vps4 by Ist1 ( Dimaano et al. , 2008 ). However, the Vta1 structure shows a C-terminal Vps4 binding domain and two N-terminal MIT domains that might be located at the periphery of the Vps4 double ring structure ( Xiao et al. , 2008 ). We describe here the requirement of the hIST1 MIM in the conserved interaction of hIST1 (Ist1) with LIP5 (Vta1), suggesting a requirement of the Vta1/LIP5 MIT domain in this interaction, thus arguing against a competition of hIST1 and LIP5 for binding VPS4.

The ESCRT-III subunits and ESCRT-III-associated proteins Vps2 and Vps46 in yeast and CHMP1A/B, CHMP2A/B, and CHMP3 in humans have recently been described to contain MIMs ( Obita et al. , 2007 ; Stuchell-Brereton et al. , 2007 ). Interestingly, IST1 is the first non-ESCRT-III protein that contains an MIM, raising the possibility that additional proteins unrelated to ESCRTs might also encode functional MIMs. Our results show that the hIST1 MIM is essential in cytokinesis, as demonstrated by the finding that a hIST1 MIM mutant (hIST1 L375A/K376A) is not able to rescue the cytokinesis defects induced by siRNA depletion of the endogenous hIST1 ( Figure 6 ). Vps4 activation can occur either through the interaction of its MIT domain with the MIMs found in the ESCRT-III subunits or via the binding of its β-domain to Vta1, providing several modes for ESCRT disassembly ( Scott et al. , 2005 ; Azmi et al. , 2006 , 2008 ). In this context, the specific role of hIST1 in cytokinesis might be explained by a direct activation of VPS4 by the hIST1 MIM during late stages of cell division. The mapping studies and the colocalization results shown in Figure 2 suggest that hIST1 can bind simultaneously to CHMP1A/B- and MIT-containing proteins, perhaps providing another mechanism to regulate ESCRT-III disassembly whereby hIST1 might stabilize LIP5-VPS4-ESCRT-III complexes by creating a network of MIMs. Accordingly, MIMs bind MIT domains with a modest affinity (∼30 μM) ( Obita et al. , 2007 ; Stuchell-Brereton et al. , 2007 ) and a network of MIMs, provided both by ESCRT-III and hIST1, might increase the avidity for MIT-containing proteins, such as VPS4 and LIP5, thus increasing the local stability of active VPS4 in the midbody. In agreement with this hypothesis, Ist1 displays synthetic genetic interactions with a Vps2 point mutant in its MIM that renders it unable to bind Vps4 ( Rue et al. , 2008 ).

In addition to stabilizing the ESCRT–III/VPS4 complex, hIST1 might provide a platform at the midbody to recruit a different array of MIT-containing proteins required for cytokinesis. Interestingly, a recent report shows that overexpression of a catalytically inactive form of one of the MIT-containing proteins that binds to hIST1, namely, UBPY, leads to the appearance of multinucleated cells ( Pohl and Jentsch, 2008 ), perhaps suggesting that ubiquitin modification at the midbody is needed for efficient cytokinesis. We show in this study that deletion of Ist1, Vps4, or other ESCRT components does not result in apparent defects in cell growth in yeast, suggesting that the role of the ESCRT machinery in cytokinesis has been acquired later in evolution. Hence, it will be of great interest to characterize further whether the MIT-containing proteins that bind to hIST1 and do not have a yeast homologue, such as MITD1 or Spastin, provide nonconserved functions needed for late steps in mammalian cell division.

Last, the role of the ESCRT pathway in sorting of ubiquitinated cargo rises the possibility that this machinery might be involved in trafficking events during cytokinesis ( Prekeris and Gould, 2008 ) or, alternatively, it might also be required for selective retrieval of ubiquitinated cargo from the midbody ( Van Damme et al. , 2008 ). However, based on the evidence presented in this and other reports ( Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007 ; Morita et al. , 2007 ; Carlton et al. , 2008 ), we favor a model whereby the mammalian ESCRT machinery is recruited by different adaptor proteins to facilitate several topologically similar membrane scission events that include abscission. The first level of specificity for the different processes seems to be mediated by the nature of the different adaptor proteins, namely, HRS in endosomal sorting, Gag proteins in viral budding and CEP55 in cytokinesis. A second level of specificity in this pathway would be mediated by the multiple isoforms of some ESCRT components that are present in the human pathway ( Carlton et al. , 2008 ) and the differential requirement for hIST1 in MVB sorting, HIV-1 budding and mammalian cell division indicates another way of acquiring functional diversification, suggesting that different components of the ESCRT machinery might modulate VPS4 activity and/or other activities of the pathway at specific cellular compartments.
