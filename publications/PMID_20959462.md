Abstract

NIR ( n ovel I NHAT r epressor) is a transcriptional co-repressor with inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT) activity and has previously been shown to physically interact with and suppress p53 transcriptional activity and function. However, the mechanism by which NIR suppresses p53 is not completely understood. Using a proteomic approach, we have identified the Aurora kinase B as a novel binding partner of NIR. We show that Aurora B, NIR and p53 exist in a protein complex in which Aurora B binds to NIR, thus also indirectly associates with p53. Functionally, overexpression of Aurora B or NIR suppresses p53 transcriptional activity, and depletion of Aurora B or NIR causes p53-dependent apoptosis and cell growth arrest, due to the up-regulation of p21 and Bax. We then demonstrate that Aurora B phosphorylates multiple sites in the p53 DNA-binding domain in vitro , and this phosphorylation probably also occurs in cells. Importantly, the Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation on Ser 269 or Thr 284 significantly compromises p53 transcriptional activity. Taken together, these results provide novel insight into NIR-mediated p53 suppression and also suggest an additional way for p53 regulation.

Introduction

The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that regulates various important biological processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence ( 1 , 2 ), and p53 mutations have been identified in over 50% of human cancers ( 3 , 4 ). The steady-state level of p53 in unstressed cells is low; in response to DNA damage, the stability and activity of p53 is modulated by various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation ( 5 , 6 ). Activated p53 can induce the transcription of subsets of genes. Putative p53 target genes include the p21 and some proapoptotic genes, such as Bax , Puma , and NOXA ( 2 ). Induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 leads to G 1 phase cell growth arrest ( 7 ), and the proapoptotic genes cause caspase activation and ultimately apoptotic cell death ( 4 ). Suppression of p53 function in the germinal center (GC) is important for high rate B cell proliferation ( 8 ). Physiologic DNA breaks occur when germinal center B cells undergo immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) 2 and somatic hypermutation ( 9 – 11 ); in this situation, inhibition of p53 can protect B cells from p53-dependent apoptosis.

p53 is composed of an N-terminal transactivation domain, a central specific DNA-binding domain (DBD), and a C-terminal tetramerization domain followed by a regulatory domain ( 6 ). At least 20 phosphorylation sites have been reported for human p53; the majority of these sites are modified in response to DNA damage or stress, but some are phosphorylated under normal growth conditions. Most of the N-terminal-specific phosphorylation sites prevent MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and stabilize p53; in contrast, phosphorylation of p53 at its C-terminal and some N-terminal sites more often suppresses its function, in most cases by promoting its degradation, for example phosphorylation of Ser 362/366 by inhibitor of NF-κB kinase ( 12 ) and Thr 55 by TAF1 ( 13 ). To date, little is known about phosphorylation in the p53 DBD.

NIR ( n ovel I NHAT r epressor) has been identified as a potent transcriptional co-repressor with inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT) activity ( 14 ). As a nuclear protein, NIR has been shown to directly bind to nucleosomes and core histones and prevent acetylation by histone acetyltransferases. Moreover, NIR also physically interacts with p53 and localizes to the promoter regions of some p53-targeted genes, thus suppressing p53 transcriptional activity and p53-dependent apoptosis ( 14 ). We previously found that the expression level of NIR (DKFZp564C186 ) increased in normal B cells upon stimulation with CD40L plus IL-4 ( 15 ). Using tandem affinity purification, we identified Aurora B as a novel NIR-interacting protein. Aurora B is a serine/threonine kinase that is highly expressed during mitosis ( 16 , 17 ) and is the catalytic component of the chromosome passenger complex, the Aurora B-INCENP-Survivin-Borealin complex ( 18 , 19 ). The kinase activity of Aurora B is regulated through autophosphorylation ( 20 ). It is well established that Aurora B is required for chromosome condensation, alignment, and cytokinesis ( 19 ). Here, we demonstrate that Aurora B, NIR, and p53 exist in a protein complex in vivo . NIR functions to mediate the indirect association between Aurora B and p53 within this complex, therefore facilitating Aurora B-mediated p53 phosphorylation on multiple sites in the DBD and thus causes significantly impaired p53 transcriptional activity.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we aimed to better understand the mechanism underlying NIR-mediated suppression of p53, a key protein already known to interact with NIR. With this in mind, we performed tandem affinity purification using a two-step protocol and identified Aurora B as a novel NIR-interacting protein. We then showed that Aurora B exists in a complex with NIR and p53, in which NIR might mediate the indirect association between Aurora B and p53 ( Fig. 2 ). In further studies, we provide several lines of evidence that p53 is functionally suppressed in this protein complex. First, overexpression of wild-type Aurora B or NIR suppresses p53 transcriptional activity and the induction of p21 and Bax in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 3 , A and B ). Second, depletion of Aurora B or NIR causes p53-dependent apoptosis and cell growth arrest through induction of p53 key target genes, such as p21 and Bax ( Fig. 3 , C and D ). Finally, Aurora B-mediated p53 suppression requires its kinase activity ( Fig. 4 , A and C ). Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Aurora B is able to directly phosphorylate p53 and that phosphorylation on Ser 269 and Thr 284 significantly compromised p53 activity ( Figs. 4 , D–G , and 5 , A–D ). Based on these results, we propose a model in which, under normal growth conditions and other specific conditions ( e.g. in cells with spontaneous DNA damage or in B cells undergoing CSR), p53 is functionally suppressed within the Aurora B-NIR-p53 protein complex, mainly through constitutive phosphorylation within the DBD domain by Aurora B ( Fig. 5 E ).

Previous studies indicated that NIR binds to two regions of p53 and suppresses p53 function ( 14 ). Our results showed that NIR binds to the kinase domain of Aurora B and that both the N terminus (amino acids 1–250) and C terminus (amino acids 500–749) of NIR are involved in the interaction with Aurora B. Under normal growth conditions, depletion of NIR causes p53-dependent apoptosis and cell growth arrest ( supplemental Fig. S3, B and C , and Fig. 3 ). We speculate that NIR mainly functions to mediate the indirect association between Aurora B and p53, leading to constitutive p53 phosphorylation and functional suppression. At present, it is unclear whether NIR play a direct role in regulating Aurora B kinase activity, and due to the poor expression of NIR fusion protein in bacteria, we are currently unable to address this question in in vitro assays.

A functional connection between Aurora B and p53 has been documented previously. For example, overexpression of Aurora B kinase has been reported in colorectal ( 31 ) and prostate cancers ( 32 ), and treatment of cells with Aurora B inhibitors induces p53-dependent apoptosis in human leukemia cells ( 33 ). In this study, we demonstrate that Aurora B suppresses p53 through direct phosphorylation. Furthermore, we have identified the Aurora B-mediated p53 phosphorylation sites in vitro and shown that these sites are also most likely phosphorylated in vivo ( Fig. 4 G ). Interestingly, all three phosphorylation sites (Ser 183 , Ser 269 , Thr 284 ) are located in the p53 DBD domain. Functional assays further defined that phosphorylation on Ser 269 and Thr 284 plays a major role in this p53-negative regulation ( Fig. 5 , A–D ). Phosphorylation of these sites is unlikely to cause p53 degradation as depletion of Aurora B did not increase endogenous p53 protein levels ( Fig. 3 C ) and the expression levels of WT p53 and its phosphomimetic mutants are similar ( Fig. 5 D ). Previous structural studies indicated that Ser 269 and Thr 284 are located in the DBD core domain S10 strand and H2 helix region, respectively ( 34 , 35 ). Thus, it is likely that phosphorylation at these sites affects p53 binding to some specific promoter regions of its target genes. In addition, although phosphorylation mimicking of either Ser 269 or Thr 284 is sufficient to abolish the induction of p21 and proapoptotic Bax protein ( Fig. 5 , A–D ), it is unclear whether phosphorylation on Ser 269 or Thr 284 occurs simultaneously in vivo or exhibits some preference under certain conditions.

It is noteworthy that, although the expression level of Aurora B protein peaks at the late G 2 to M phase ( 16 , 17 , 36 ), Aurora B is expressed at a basal level throughout the cell cycle ( 36 ). Therefore, it is likely that in most of the cell population, Aurora B levels are comparable with the basal level of p53 and indispensable for p53 phosphorylation and suppression in the absence of DNA damage. Our results indicate that p53-NIR-Aurora B form a protein complex separate from MDM2 ( Fig. 2 A ), and it is possible that upon DNA damage, p53 is stabilized and most “free” p53 can “escape” the suppression within this protein complex. Subsequently, the function of this free p53 is gradually down-regulated, partially through the phosphorylation by Aurora B. In favor of this notion, previous studies have reported slow kinetics of p53 phosphorylation after DNA damage, for example the phosphorylation of Ser 366 , Ser 378 , and Thr 387 by Chk1/Chk2 ( 37 ).

Double-stranded DNA breaks trigger p53-mediated cell cycle arrest or apoptosis pathways. B cells undergoing CSR and somatic hypermutation have physiologic double-stranded DNA breaks, and suppression of p53 function is necessary to allow efficient rearrangement of antigen receptors and generation of neutralizing antibody responses ( 9 – 11 ). The oncogene BCL6 has been shown to inhibit p53 function by suppressing its expression in germinal center B cells ( 38 ). However, significant p53 protein levels can be observed in germinal center B cells ( 38 ), suggesting that additional factors independent of BCL6 may be required for further inhibition of p53 function and B cell terminal differentiation. Because NIR functions to suppress p53 and shows increased expression upon CD40L and IL-4 stimulation in normal B cells ( supplemental Fig. S1, A and B ), NIR may be such a factor. In support of this, we have shown that NIR forms a complex with Aurora B and facilitates p53 protein phosphorylation and suppression. Additionally, B cells from EDI patients with defects in CSR fail to express NIR upon stimulation ( 15 ). Because NIR-deficient mice are embryonic lethal, 3 it will be important to make NIR-conditional knock-out mice and examine whether specific depletion of NIR expression in the B cell lineage impairs germinal center formation and the development of neutralizing antibody responses.
