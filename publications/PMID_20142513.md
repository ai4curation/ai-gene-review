Combined deficiency of coagulation factors V and VIII (F5F8D), an autosomal 
recessive disorder characterized by coordinate reduction in the plasma levels of 
factor V (FV) and factor VIII (FVIII), is genetically linked to mutations in the 
transmembrane lectin ERGIC-53 and the soluble calcium-binding protein MCFD2. 
Growing evidence indicates that these two proteins form a complex recycling 
between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment 
and thereby function as a cargo receptor in the early secretory pathway of FV 
and FVIII. For better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the functional 
coordination of ERGIC-53 and MCFD2, we herein characterize their interaction by 
x-ray crystallographic analysis in conjunction with NMR and ultracentrifugation 
analyses. Inspection of the combined data reveals that ERGIC-53-CRD binds MCFD2 
through its molecular surface remote from the sugar-binding site, giving rise to 
a 11 complex in solution. The interaction is independent of sugar-binding of 
ERGIC-53 and involves most of the missense mutation sites of MCFD2 so far 
reported in F5F8D. Comparison with the previously reported uncomplexed structure 
of each protein indicates that MCFD2 but not ERGIC-53-CRD undergoes significant 
conformational alterations upon complex formation. Our findings provide a 
structural basis for the cooperative interplay between ERGIC-53 and MCFD2 in 
capturing FV and FVIII.

Abstract

Combined deficiency of coagulation factors V and VIII (F5F8D), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by coordinate reduction in the plasma levels of factor V (FV) and factor VIII (FVIII), is genetically linked to mutations in the transmembrane lectin ERGIC-53 and the soluble calcium-binding protein MCFD2. Growing evidence indicates that these two proteins form a complex recycling between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and thereby function as a cargo receptor in the early secretory pathway of FV and FVIII. For better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the functional coordination of ERGIC-53 and MCFD2, we herein characterize their interaction by x-ray crystallographic analysis in conjunction with NMR and ultracentrifugation analyses. Inspection of the combined data reveals that ERGIC-53-CRD binds MCFD2 through its molecular surface remote from the sugar-binding site, giving rise to a 1∶1 complex in solution. The interaction is independent of sugar-binding of ERGIC-53 and involves most of the missense mutation sites of MCFD2 so far reported in F5F8D. Comparison with the previously reported uncomplexed structure of each protein indicates that MCFD2 but not ERGIC-53-CRD undergoes significant conformational alterations upon complex formation. Our findings provide a structural basis for the cooperative interplay between ERGIC-53 and MCFD2 in capturing FV and FVIII.

Discussion

In the present study, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the complex between MCFD2 and the CRD of ERGIC-53. In human, ERGIC-53 together with VIP36 and its homolog VIPL constitute a family of leguminous type lectins ( 20 , 21 ). These proteins have different intracellular distributions and dynamics in the ER-Golgi system in the secretory pathway ( 22 – 25 ). Among these three lectins, only ERGIC-53 interacts with MCFD2 despite the structural similarities of their CRDs ( 3 , 13 , 15 ). Our structural data indicate that ERGIC-53 binds MCFD2 primarily through the segment spanning from β1a to β2 strands of the CRD. The amino acid residues located in this region are much less conserved between ERGIC-53 and VIP36/VIPL ( Fig. S1 A ). In addition, comparison of the crystal structures of the CRDs demonstrates that the loops connecting β1b and β2 strands exhibit marked conformational differences between ERGIC-53 and VIP36 despite their overall structural similarities ( Fig. S1 B ). These structural differences account for the specific binding of MCFD2 to ERGIC-53.

So far, seven missense mutations of MCFD2 have been reported in F5F8D families ( 2 , 9 ). These mutations cause amino acid substitutions in the first EF-hand motif (D81Y and D89A) and the second EF-hand motif (D122V, D129E, Y135N, and I136T/V). All the mutations except for Y135N have already been tested for in vitro and/or in vivo interactions with ERGIC-53 and shown to result in impaired binding ( 3 , 10 , 12 , 17 ). The present study also confirmed the negative effects of these mutations on the binding capability to ERGIC-53-CRD ( Figs. S4 – S6 ). Our crystal structure revealed that, four of these amino acid residues, D81, D89, D122, and Y135 are directly involved in the intermolecular interaction with ERGIC-53, whereas the remaining two residues (D129 and I136) are involved in Ca 2+ -coordination and therefore crucial for structural integrity of MCFD2 ( Fig. 1 D ). A recently reported nonsense mutation of MCFD2 results in deletion of the C-terminal three residues Ser144, Leu145, and Gln146. This truncated MCFD2 mutant also exhibits impaired binding to ERGIC-53 ( 26 ). In the crystal structure, the C-terminal residues of MCFD2 gave no electron density but are obviously remote from the binding site for ERGIC-53-CRD. As shown by the previous CD data ( 26 ), the C-terminal residues are likely to confer structural integrity of MCFD2 and thereby contribute to the interaction with ERGIC-53 in an indirect manner.

Our present data also indicate that MCFD2 undergoes significant conformational alteration upon binding to the ERGIC-53, whereas MCFD2 binding has little impact on the conformation of ERGIC-53-CRD. In addition, the MCFD2 binding site is located remotely from the sugar-binding site on ERGIC-53-CRD ( Fig. S1 B ). These observations suggest that sugar-binding affinity and specificity of ERGIC-53 are influenced neither directly nor allosterically by the interaction with MCFD2. Indeed, our ITC data indicate that the sugar-binding to ERGIC-53-CRD is independent of its interaction with MCFD2 ( Fig. S7 ). In accordance with these results, ERGIC-53 has been shown to be able to bind cathepsin Z and cathepsin C as cargo glycoproteins in an MCFD2-independent fashion ( 11 ). This strongly implies that MCFD2 operates as a recruitment factor for FV and FVIII.

In many cases, EF-hand domains use their finger-motifs to form ligand-binding pockets on the opposite face of the Ca 2+ -binding sites ( 27 ). MCFD2, however, does not adopt this typical mode of ligand-binding but uses the back of the EF-hand for the interaction with ERGIC-53-CRD, which results in the allosteric conformational change of the canonical ligand-binding site. Our structural data lead us to propose a model of functional coordination between ERGIC-53 and MCFD2. MCFD2 is converted into the active form upon complex formation with ERGIC-53 and thereby becomes able to capture polypeptide segments of FV and FVIII in cooperation with ERGIC-53 interacting with their carbohydrate moieties. These coagulation factors are heavily glycosylated and therefore bind the ERGIC-53 oligomer avidly in the ER but become released upon arrival to acidic postER compartments because the sugar-binding of ERGIC-53 is pH-dependent ( 28 ). Thus, this study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying sorting and trafficking of the two coagulation factors mediated by the ERGIC-53/MCFD2 cargo receptor complex. Targeting the ERGIC-53/MCFD2 complex has been proposed as a therapeutic approach to anticoagulation ( 9 ). Considering our finding of a conformational change of MCFD2 upon complex formation with ERGIC-53, it appears that such an undertaking should focus on MCFD2.
