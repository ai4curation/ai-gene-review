While probing the role of RNA for the function of SET1C/COMPASS histone 
methyltransferase, we identified SET1RC (SET1 mRNA-associated complex), a 
complex that contains SET1 mRNA and Set1, Swd1, Spp1 and Shg1, four of the eight 
polypeptides that constitute SET1C. Characterization of SET1RC showed that SET1 
mRNA binding did not require associated Swd1, Spp1 and Shg1 proteins or RNA 
recognition motifs present in Set1. RNA binding was not observed when Set1 
protein and SET1 mRNA were derived from independent genes or when SET1 
transcripts were restricted to the nucleus. Importantly, the protein-RNA 
interaction was sensitive to EDTA, to the translation elongation inhibitor 
puromycin and to the inhibition of translation initiation in prt1-1 mutants. 
Taken together, our results support the idea that SET1 mRNA binding was 
dependent on translation and that SET1RC assembled on nascent Set1 in a 
cotranslational manner. Moreover, we show that cellular accumulation of Set1 is 
limited by the availability of certain SET1C components, such as Swd1 and Swd3, 
and suggest that cotranslational protein interactions may exert an effect in the 
protection of nascent Set1 from degradation.
