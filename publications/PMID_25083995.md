Canonical WNT signaling components in vascular development and barrier 
formation.

Canonical WNT signaling is required for proper vascularization of the CNS during 
embryonic development. Here, we used mice with targeted mutations in genes 
encoding canonical WNT pathway members to evaluate the exact contribution of 
these components in CNS vascular development and in specification of the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-retina barrier (BRB). We determined that 
vasculature in various CNS regions is differentially sensitive to perturbations 
in canonical WNT signaling. The closely related WNT signaling coreceptors LDL 
receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) and LRP6 had redundant functions in brain 
vascular development and barrier maintenance; however, loss of LRP5 alone 
dramatically altered development of the retinal vasculature. The BBB in the 
cerebellum and pons/interpeduncular nuclei was highly sensitive to decrements in 
canonical WNT signaling, and WNT signaling was required to maintain plasticity 
of barrier properties in mature CNS vasculature. Brain and retinal vascular 
defects resulting from ablation of Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling were ameliorated 
by stabilizing β-catenin, while inhibition of β-catenin-dependent transcription 
recapitulated the vascular development and barrier defects associated with loss 
of receptor, coreceptor, or ligand, indicating that Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling 
acts predominantly through β-catenin-dependent transcriptional regulation. 
Together, these data strongly support a model in which identical or nearly 
identical canonical WNT signaling mechanisms mediate neural tube and retinal 
vascularization and maintain the BBB and BRB.

Abstract

Canonical WNT signaling is required for proper vascularization of the CNS during embryonic development. Here, we used mice with targeted mutations in genes encoding canonical WNT pathway members to evaluate the exact contribution of these components in CNS vascular development and in specification of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-retina barrier (BRB). We determined that vasculature in various CNS regions is differentially sensitive to perturbations in canonical WNT signaling. The closely related WNT signaling coreceptors LDL receptor–related protein 5 (LRP5) and LRP6 had redundant functions in brain vascular development and barrier maintenance; however, loss of LRP5 alone dramatically altered development of the retinal vasculature. The BBB in the cerebellum and pons/interpeduncular nuclei was highly sensitive to decrements in canonical WNT signaling, and WNT signaling was required to maintain plasticity of barrier properties in mature CNS vasculature. Brain and retinal vascular defects resulting from ablation of Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling were ameliorated by stabilizing β-catenin, while inhibition of β-catenin–dependent transcription recapitulated the vascular development and barrier defects associated with loss of receptor, coreceptor, or ligand, indicating that Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling acts predominantly through β-catenin–dependent transcriptional regulation. Together, these data strongly support a model in which identical or nearly identical canonical WNT signaling mechanisms mediate neural tube and retinal vascularization and maintain the BBB and BRB.

Introduction

In vertebrates, vascular endothelial cells (ECs) exhibit characteristic structural and functional differences among tissues ( 1 , 2 ). For example, in renal glomeruli, numerous fenestrations pack the surfaces of capillary ECs, an arrangement that maximizes serum filtration ( 3 ). In contrast, in regions of the CNS with a blood-brain barrier (BBB) or blood-retina barrier (BRB), capillary ECs lack fenestrations, are joined by tight junctions, and are impermeable to serum constituents ( 4 ). Barrier competent CNS ECs express a distinctive set of plasma membrane pumps to actively extrude a wide variety of organic molecules and a distinctive set of transporters to facilitate CNS uptake of essential nutrients such as glucose. The physical and physiologic underpinnings of the BBB/BRB have been objects of fascination among biologists since their existence was first demonstrated by intravenous dye injection more than a century ago ( 4 ).

CNS vascular invasion and BBB development depend critically on canonical WNT signaling, as determined by eliminating WNT7a and WNT7b in the developing neuroepithelium and by eliminating or stabilizing β-catenin in ECs ( 5 – 7 ). In the retina and cerebellum, barrier integrity depends on Norrin, a TGF-β family member that is produced by glia and functions as a high-affinity WNT-like ligand for its EC receptor Frizzled4 (FZ4; refs. 8 , 9 ). Mosaic deletion of FZ4 in mature retinal or cerebellar ECs leads to a cell-autonomous loss of the BRB or the BBB, respectively ( 10 ). Conversely, in mice lacking endogenous Norrin, initiating ectopic production of Norrin in adulthood restores BBB integrity in the cerebellum. Taken together, these data imply that BBB/BRB integrity depends on multiple canonical WNT signaling components and that this system remains plastic throughout life.

In addition to its role in CNS vascular integrity, Norrin/FZ4 signaling also plays a central role in retinal vascular growth. In mice, loss-of-function mutations in the genes coding for FZ4, Norrin, the coreceptor LDL receptor–related protein 5 (LRP5), or the integral membrane protein TSPAN12 lead to hypovascularization of the retina ( 8 , 11 – 14 ). In humans, loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked Norrie disease gene ( NDP , the gene coding for Norrin) causes severe hypovascularization of the retina, with persistence of the hyaloid vasculature, compensatory neovascularization, intraocular bleeding, retinal scarring, and blindness ( 15 ). Milder hypovascularization is associated with heterozygosity for mutations in FZD4 , LRP5 , and TSPAN12 ( 16 – 20 ) and is referred to as familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR).

In the present paper, we address the role that different WNT signaling components play in BBB/BRB integrity and in retinal vascular development. We observe a variety of anatomic patterns and severities of BBB/BRB breakdown with different combinations of mutations in genes coding for WNT signaling components, implying a previously unappreciated molecular heterogeneity within the CNS vasculature. We also provide strong evidence that Norrin/FZ4 signaling acts via the canonical WNT pathway by demonstrating that defects in Ndp or Fz4 can be rescued by stabilizing β-catenin and can be phenocopied by ectopic expression of a dominant negative version of T cell factor-4 (TCF4).

Discussion

In this paper, we describe the responses of different subsets of developing and mature ECs to changes in the abundance of canonical WNT signaling components. These experiments reveal previously unappreciated region-specific and EC cell type–specific differences in sensitivity to perturbations in canonical WNT signaling. We also present evidence that Norrin/FZ4 signaling in the retina and cerebellum occurs predominantly or exclusively via activation of canonical WNT signaling (β-catenin stabilization) and that β-catenin mediates most of its effects on vascular development and BBB homeostasis via transcriptional regulation.
