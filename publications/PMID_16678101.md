While the biological roles of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in 
development and disease are well documented, understanding the molecular logic 
underlying the functionally distinct nuclear transcriptional programs mediating 
the diverse functions of beta-catenin remains a major challenge. Here, we report 
an unexpected strategy for beta-catenin-dependent regulation of cell-lineage 
determination based on interactions between beta-catenin and a specific 
homeodomain factor, Prop1, rather than Lef/Tcfs. beta-catenin acts as a binary 
switch to simultaneously activate expression of the critical lineage-determining 
transcription factor, Pit1, and to repress the gene encoding the 
lineage-inhibiting transcription factor, Hesx1, acting via TLE/Reptin/HDAC1 
corepressor complexes. The strategy of functionally distinct actions of a 
homeodomain factor in response to Wnt signaling is suggested to be prototypic of 
a widely used mechanism for generating diverse cell types from pluripotent 
precursor cells in response to common signaling pathways during organogenesis.
