Comment on
    Hsu SF, Lai HC, Jinn TL. Cytosolic-localized heat shock factor binding 
protein, AtHSBP, functions as a negative regulator of heat shock response by 
translocation to the nucleus and is required for seed development in 
Arabidopsis. Plant Physiol. 2010;153:773–784. doi: 10.1104/pp.109.151225.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, heat shock factor binding protein (AtHSBP) is a 
negative regulator of the heat shock response (HSR), and defective AtHSBP leads 
to seed abortion. We found that the wild-type and AtHSBP-knockout plants did not 
differ in ovule phenotypes at flower position 3, which indicates that the seed 
abortion occurs after fertilization and during embryogenesis. The conserved 
residues of the hydrophobic heptad repeat (HR) domains in AtHSBP were mutated 
and examined for their subcellular localization and interacting ability with 
heat shock factors (AtHSFs). The HR domains at the C terminus of AtHSBP are 
important for retaining AtHSBP in the cytoplasm under normal growth conditions 
and for interacting with AtHSFs, which negatively affects the DNA-binding 
capacity and transactivation activity of AtHSFs during the HSR.

Abstract

In Arabidopsis thaliana , heat shock factor binding protein (AtHSBP) is a negative regulator of the heat shock response (HSR), and defective AtHSBP leads to seed abortion. We found that the wild-type and AtHSBP -knockout plants did not differ in ovule phenotypes at flower position 3, which indicates that the seed abortion occurs after fertilization and during embryogenesis. The conserved residues of the hydrophobic heptad repeat (HR) domains in AtHSBP were mutated and examined for their subcellular localization and interacting ability with heat shock factors (AtHSFs). The HR domains at the C terminus of AtHSBP are important for retaining AtHSBP in the cytoplasm under normal growth conditions and for interacting with AtHSFs, which negatively affects the DNA-binding capacity and transactivation activity of AtHSFs during the HSR.

The DefectiveAtHSBPMay Not Affect Ovule Development but May Influence Embryogenesis After Fertilization to Result in Seed Abortion

We examined the ovules in the ovary of different Arabidopsis flower positions that reflect the relative developmental stages on an inflorescence from the top to the bottom 10 , 11 ( Fig. 1A ). Flower position 1 represents the opened youngest flower with visible petals between sepals. Flower positions 1 and 2 are self-pollinated flowers, and pollen tubes grow to fertilize the ovules. At and after flower position 3, the ovules enter embryogenesis and seed development. Semi-thin sections of the wild-type and AtHSBP -knockout ( Athsbp-1 ) plants revealed no difference in ovule phenotypes at flower position 3 ( Fig. 1B ), whereas seed abortion phenotype was observed at and after flower position 6 ( Fig. 1C ). Thus, AtHSBP may not affect ovule development but may regulate embryogenesis and seed development after fertilization.

The HSR is known to affect various developmental stages among different species. The emp2 mutant kernels in maize lead to unattenuated HSR and are also aborted at the coleoptile stage/stage 1, followed by necrosis and reabsorption of kernel contents. 6 Overexpression of HSP70 in Drosophila cells has been found to reduce cell division rate and growth. 12 We found that the defective AtHSBP upregulated HSP expression 9 and affected embryogenesis to cause a seed abortion phenotype, which indicates that the mutant seeds of Athsbp-1 may exhibit an unattenuated HSR to cause aborted seeds. However, which embryonic stage is affected by AtHSBP needs to be confirmed.

Conclusions and Perspectives

During the recovery from HS, AtHSBP, without a nuclear localization signal, translocates to the nucleus and functions to negatively mediate the DNA-binding capacity and transactivation activity of AtHSFs. 9 The conserved residue Ser31 of HsHSBP1 has been suggested to play an important role in its structure and function. 14 Regardless of HS treatment, we found that the AtHSBP-S35A mutation may alter its structure for expression only in the cytoplasm, but does not affect the interacting ability with AtHSFs. 9 The AtHSBP-I42K/M45K and AtHSBP-I49K/L52K mutations on the HR domain were detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, similar to that of the overexpressed GFP control (data not shown), and significantly lost the interacting activity with AtHSFs. We propose that (1) AtHSBP may interact with the specific factor(s) through the coiled-coil structure for retention in the cytoplasm under normal growth conditions, and the mutations of the AtHSBP-HR domain may lose the interacting ability and lead the overexpressed proteins to diffuse to the nucleus; and (2) the residue Ser35 can confer a specific conformation/structure of AtHSBP, which may be essential to associate with HS-related factor(s) for nuclear localization during the recovery from HS. However, the potential cytoplasmic interacting factor(s) mediating AtHSBP translocation in response to the HSR remain unclear, and additional studies are necessary to address this issue.
