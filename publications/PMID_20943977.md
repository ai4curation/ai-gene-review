Tetherin and IFITM3 are recently identified interferon-induced cellular proteins 
that restrict infections by retroviruses and filoviruses and of influenza virus 
and flaviviruses, respectively. In our efforts to further explore their 
antiviral activities against other viruses and determine their antiviral 
mechanisms, we found that the two antiviral proteins potently inhibit the 
infection of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a prototype member of the 
Rhabdoviridae family. Taking advantage of this well-studied virus infection 
system, we show that although both tetherin and IFITM3 are plasma membrane 
proteins, tetherin inhibits virion particle release from infected cells, while 
IFITM3 disrupts an early event after endocytosis of virion particles but before 
primary transcription of incoming viral genomes. Furthermore, we demonstrate 
that both the N-terminal 21 amino acid residues and C-terminal transmembrane 
region of IFITM3 are required for its antiviral activity. Collectively, our work 
sheds light on the mechanisms by which tetherin and IFITM3 restrict infection 
with rhabdoviruses and possibly other pathogenic viruses.
