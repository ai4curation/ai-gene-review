HSP40s are a subfamily of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and play important roles in 
regulation of cell proliferation, survival and apoptosis by serving as 
chaperones for HSP70s. Up to date hundreds of HSP40 proteins derived from 
various species ranging from Escherichia coli to homo sapiens have been 
identified. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel human 
type C DnaJ homologue, HDJC9, containing a typical N-terminal J domain. HDJC9 is 
upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels upon various stress and mitogenic 
stimulations. HDJC9 is mainly localized in cell nuclei under normal culture 
conditions while it is transported into cytoplasm and plasma membrane upon heat 
shock stress through a non-classical and lipid-dependent pathway. HDJC9 can 
interact with HSP70s and activate the ATPase activity of HSP70s, both of which 
are dependent on the J domain. Our data suggest that HDJC9 is a novel 
cochaperone for HSP70s.
