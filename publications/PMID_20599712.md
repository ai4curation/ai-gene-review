BACKGROUND AND AIMS: AT motif binding factor 1 (ATBF1), a homeotic transcription 
factor, was identified as a tumor suppressor, and loss of heterozygosity at 
ATBF1 locus occurs frequently in gastric cancers. We previously showed that 
ATBF1 expression inversely correlated with the malignant character of gastric 
cancer and that ATBF1 enhanced the promoter activity of p21Waf1/Cip1. We also 
found that ATBF1 moves between cytoplasm and nucleus, but the precise mechanism 
of translocation is unknown. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of 
ATBF1 translocation to the nucleus with the runt domain transcription factor 3 
(RUNX3) in cooperation with TGF-beta signal transduction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To analyze the expression of ATBF1 and RUNX3 in gastric 
cancer cells, we performed immunohistochemistry on 98 resected gastric cancer 
tissue samples and scored the nuclear staining intensity as grade 0 to grade 5. 
Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of ATBF1 and RUNX3 was performed. Dual luciferase 
assays were performed by transfecting ATBF1 and RUNX3 with a p21Waf1/Cip1 
reporter vector. To investigate the nuclear translocation of endogenous ATBF1 
and RUNX3 in response to TGF-beta signal, we examined the subcellular 
localization of ATBF1 and RUNX3 in gastric cancer cells treated with recombinant 
TGF-beta1 using confocal laser scanning microscopy.
RESULTS: Strong immunohistochemical nuclear staining of ATBF1 was observed in 37 
(37.8%) of the gastric cancer tissue samples, and RUNX3 nuclear staining was 
observed in 15 (15.3%). There was a statistically significant correlation 
between ATBF1 and RUNX3 nuclear localization (rs=0.433, p<0.001). Co-IP revealed 
a physical association between ATBF1 and RUNX3. ATBF1 and RUNX3 up-regulated 
p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter activity synergistically. In SNU16 gastric cancer cells, 
ATBF1 and RUNX3 were cytoplasmic before TGF-beta1 stimulation, but after 24h of 
TGF-beta1 stimulation, endogenous ATBF1 and RUNX3 translocated to the nucleus.
CONCLUSION: ATBF1 associates with RUNX3 and translocates to the nucleus in 
response to TGF-beta signal transduction and might function in the nucleus as 
tumor suppressor and transcriptional regulator.
