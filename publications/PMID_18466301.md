Based on our previous findings, we proposed a pathway for the participation of 
Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM) in heat-shock (HS) signal transduction. The specific 
mechanism by which CaM regulates activation of heat-shock transcription factors 
(HSFs) is not known. CaM-binding protein kinases (CBK) are the most poorly 
understood of the CaM target proteins in plants. In this study, using a yeast 
two-hybrid assay, we found that AtCBK3 interacts with AtHSFA1a. Fluorescence 
resonance energy transfer was used to confirm the interaction between AtCBK3-YFP 
and AtHSFA1a-CFP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that purified recombinant AtCBK3 
phosphorylated recombinant AtHSFA1a in vitro. We also describe the results of 
both downregulation of AtCBK3 expression and ectopic overexpression in 
Arabidopsis thaliana. The T-DNA insertion AtCBK3 knockout lines had impaired 
basal thermotolerance, which could be complemented by transformation of plants 
with the native gene. Overexpression of AtCBK3 resulted in plants with increased 
basal thermotolerance. Results from real-time quantitative PCR and protein 
gel-blot analyses suggest that AtCBK3 regulates transcription of heat-shock 
protein (HSP) genes and synthesis of HSPs. The binding activity of HSF to the 
heat-shock element (HSE), the mRNA level of HSP genes and synthesis of HSPs were 
upregulated in AtCBK3-overexpressing lines after HS, but downregulated in AtCBK3 
null lines. These results indicate that AtCBK3 controls the binding activity of 
HSFs to HSEs by phosphorylation of AtHSFA1a, and is an important component of 
the HS signal transduction pathway.
