The F(0)F(1)-ATPase complex of yeast mitochondria contains three mitochondrial 
and at least 17 nuclear gene products. The coordinate assembly of mitochondrial 
and cytosolic translation products relies on chaperones and specific factors 
that stabilize the pools of some unassembled subunits. Atp10p was identified as 
a mitochondrial inner membrane component necessary for the biogenesis of the 
hydrophobic F(0) sector of the ATPase. Here we show that, following its 
synthesis on mitochondrial ribosomes, subunit 6 of the ATPase (Atp6p) can be 
cross-linked to Atp10p. This interaction is required for the integration of 
Atp6p into a partially assembled subcomplex of the ATPase. Pulse labeling and 
chase of mitochondrial translation products in vivo indicate that Atp6p is less 
stable and more rapidly degraded in an atp10 null mutant than in wild type. 
Based on these observations, we propose Atp10p to be an Atp6p-specific chaperone 
that facilitates the incorporation of Atp6p into an intermediate subcomplex of 
ATPase subunits.
