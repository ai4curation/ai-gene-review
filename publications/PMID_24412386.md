AIMS: The role of vascular smooth muscle endothelin A receptors (ETA) in 
development and normal physiology remains incompletely understood. To address 
this, mice were generated with smooth muscle-specific knockout (KO) of ETA.
MAIN METHODS: Mice were homozygous for loxP-flanked exons 6-8 of the EDNRA gene 
(floxed) or were also hemizygous for a transgene expressing Cre recombinase 
under control of the smooth muscle-specific SM22 promoter (KO mice).
KEY FINDINGS: Genotyping at 17 days postnatal yielded a 10:1 ratio of floxed:KO 
mice. Smooth muscle actin staining of embryos at day E10.5 revealed increased 
tortuosity in dorsal aortae while E12.5 embryos had mandibular, vascular and 
thymic abnormalities. Mice surviving to weaning developed and bred normally. ETA 
KO mice aged 2-3 months manifested EDNRA gene recombination in all organs 
tested. Aortas from KO mice had a >90% reduction in ETA mRNA content, but no 
differences in ET-1 or ETB mRNA levels. Addition of 0.01-100 nM ET-1 to isolated 
femoral arteries from floxed, but not KO, mice dose-dependently decreased vessel 
diameter (up to 80% reduction in the presence of ETB blockade). Intravenous 
infusion of ET-1 into floxed, but not KO, mice increased mean arterial pressure 
(MAP) (by ~10 mm Hg). Telemetric analysis revealed decreased MAP in KO mice 
(reduced by ~7-10 mm Hg) when fed a high salt diet.
SIGNIFICANCE: Smooth muscle ETA is important for normal vascular, mandibular and 
thymic development and is involved in the maintenance of arterial pressure under 
physiological conditions.
