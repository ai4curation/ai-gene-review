The Notch signaling pathway governs many distinct cellular processes by 
regulating transcriptional programs. The transcriptional response initiated by 
Notch is highly cell context dependent, indicating that multiple factors 
influence Notch target gene selection and activity. However, the mechanism by 
which Notch drives target gene transcription is not well understood. Herein, we 
identify and characterize a novel Notch-interacting protein, Notch activation 
complex kinase (NACK), which acts as a Notch transcriptional coactivator. We 
show that NACK associates with the Notch transcriptional activation complex on 
DNA, mediates Notch transcriptional activity, and is required for Notch-mediated 
tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that Notch1 and NACK are coexpressed during mouse 
development and that homozygous loss of NACK is embryonic lethal. Finally, we 
show that NACK is also a Notch target gene, establishing a feed-forward loop. 
Thus, our data indicate that NACK is a key component of the Notch 
transcriptional complex and is an essential regulator of Notch-mediated 
tumorigenesis and development.
