Mutations in transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) cause a rare form of the hereditary 
hemochromatosis, resulting in iron overload predominantly in the liver. TfR2 is 
primarily expressed in hepatocytes and is hypothesized to sense iron levels in 
the blood to positively regulate the expression of hepcidin through activation 
of the BMP signaling pathway. Hepcidin is a peptide hormone that negatively 
regulates iron egress from cells and thus limits intestinal iron uptake. In this 
study, a yeast two-hybrid approach using the cytoplasmic domain of TfR2 
identified CD81 as an interacting protein. CD81 is an abundant tetraspanin in 
the liver. Co-precipitations of CD81 with different TfR2 constructs demonstrated 
that both the cytoplasmic and ecto-transmembrane domains of TfR2 interact with 
CD81. Knockdown of CD81 using siRNA significantly increased TfR2 levels by 
increasing the half-life of TfR2, indicating that CD81 promotes degradation of 
TfR2. Previous studies showed that CD81 is targeted for degradation by GRAIL, an 
ubiquitin E3 ligase. Knockdown of GRAIL in Hep3B-TfR2 cells increased TfR2 
levels, consistent with inhibition of CD81 ubiquitination. These results suggest 
that down-regulation of CD81 by GRAIL targets TfR2 for degradation. 
Surprisingly, knockdown of CD81 decreased hepcidin expression, implying that the 
TfR2/CD81 complex is involved in the maintenance of hepcidin mRNA. Moreover, 
knockdown of CD81 did not affect the stimulation of hepcidin expression by BMP6 
but increased both the expression of ID1 and SMAD7, direct targets of BMP 
signaling pathway, and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, indicating that the CD81 
regulates hepcidin expression differently from the BMP and ERK1/2 signaling 
pathways.
