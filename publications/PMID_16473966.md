Arabidopsis thaliana SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1 (SERK1) is a 
leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) involved in the acquisition 
of embryogenic competence and in male sporogenesis. To determine the composition 
of the SERK1 signaling complex in vivo, we generated plants expressing the SERK1 
protein fused to cyan fluorescent protein under SERK1 promoter control. The 
membrane receptor complex was immunoprecipitated from seedlings, and the 
coimmunoprecipitating proteins were identified using liquid 
chromatography/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight/mass 
spectrometry of the trypsin-released peptides. This approach identified two 
other LRR-RLKs, the BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) receptor and its 
coreceptor, the SERK3 or BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE1 protein. In addition, 
KINASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE, CDC48A, and 14-3-3nu were found. Finally, 
the MADS box transcription factor AGAMOUS-LIKE15 and an uncharacterized zinc 
finger protein, a member of the CONSTANS family, were identified as part of the 
SERK1 complex. Using blue native gel electrophoresis, we show that SERK1 and 
SERK3 are part of BRI1-containing multiple protein complexes with relative 
masses between 300 and 500 kD. The SERK1 mutant allele serk1-1 enhances the 
phenotype of the weak BRI1 allele bri1-119. Collectively, these results suggest 
that apart from SERK3, SERK1 is also involved in the brassinolide signaling 
pathway.
