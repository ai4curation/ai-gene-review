PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to elucidate the signaling pathway 
through which cationic antimicrobial protein of 37 kDa (CAP37) mediates human 
corneal epithelial cell (HCEC) chemotaxis.
METHODS: Immortalized HCECs were treated with pertussis toxin (10 and 1000 
ng/mL), protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors (calphostin c, 50 nM and Ro-31-8220, 
100 nM), phorbol esters (phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, 200 nM and phorbol 
12-myristate 13-acetate, 1 μM) known to deplete PKC isoforms, and siRNAs (400 
nM) before a modified Boyden chamber assay was used to determine the effect of 
these inhibitors and siRNAs on CAP37-directed HCEC migration. PKCδ protein 
levels, PKCδ-Thr(505) phosphorylation, and PKCδ kinase activity was assessed in 
CAP37-treated HCECs using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and a kinase 
activity assay, respectively.
RESULTS: Chemotaxis studies revealed that treatment with pertussis toxin, PKC 
inhibitors, phorbol esters, and siRNAs significantly inhibited CAP37-mediated 
chemotaxis compared with untreated controls. CAP37 treatment increased PKCδ 
protein levels and led to PKCδ phosphorylation on residue Thr(505). Direct 
activation of PKCδ by CAP37 was demonstrated using a kinase activity assay.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings lead us to conclude that CAP37 is an important 
regulator of corneal epithelial cell migration and mediates its effects through 
PKCδ.
