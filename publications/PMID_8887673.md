The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
contains a well-characterized, essential member of the Hsp70 family of molecular 
chaperones, Kar2p. Kar2p has been shown to be involved in the translocation of 
proteins into the ER as well as the proper folding of proteins in that 
compartment. We report the characterization of a novel Hsp70 of the ER, Ssi1p. 
Ssi1p, which shares 24% of the amino acids of Kar2p, is not essential for growth 
under normal conditions. However, deletion of SSI1 results in cold sensitivity 
as well as enhanced resistance to manganese. The localization of Ssi1p to the 
ER, suggested by the presence of a conserved S. cerevisiae ER retention signal 
at its C terminus, was confirmed by subcellular fractionation, protease 
protection assays, and immunofluorescence. The SSI1 promoter contains an element 
with similarity to the unfolded protein response element of KAR2. Like KAR2, 
SSI1 is induced both in the presence of tunicamycin and in a kar2-159 mutant 
strain, conditions which lead to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. 
Unlike KAR2, however, SSI1 is not induced by heat shock. Deletion of SSI1 shows 
a complex pattern of genetic interactions with various conditional alleles of 
KAR2, ranging from synthetic lethality to synthetic rescue. Interestingly, SSI1 
deletion strains show a partial block in translocation of multiple proteins into 
the ER, suggesting that Ssi1p plays a direct role in the translocation process.
