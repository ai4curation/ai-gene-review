Although chromosomal instability characterizes the majority of human colorectal 
cancers, the contribution of genes such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), 
KRAS, and p53 to this form of genetic instability is still under debate. Here, 
we have assessed chromosomal imbalances in tumors from mouse models of 
intestinal cancer, namely Apc(+/1638N), Apc(+/1638N)/KRAS(V12G), and 
Apc(+/1638N)/Tp53-/-, by array comparative genomic hybridization. All intestinal 
adenomas from Apc(+/1638N) mice displayed chromosomal alterations, thus 
confirming the presence of a chromosomal instability defect at early stages of 
the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Moreover, loss of the Tp53 tumor suppressor 
gene, but not KRAS oncogenic activation, results in an increase of gains and 
losses of whole chromosomes in the Apc-mutant genetic background. Comparative 
analysis of the overall genomic alterations found in mouse intestinal tumors 
allowed us to identify a subset of loci syntenic with human chromosomal regions 
(eg, 1p34-p36, 12q24, 9q34, and 22q) frequently gained or lost in familial 
adenomas and sporadic colorectal cancers. The latter indicate that, during 
intestinal tumor development, the genetic mechanisms and the underlying 
functional defects are conserved across species. Hence, our array comparative 
genomic hybridization analysis of Apc-mutant intestinal tumors allows the 
definition of minimal aneuploidy regions conserved between mouse and human and 
likely to encompass rate-limiting genes for intestinal tumor initiation and 
progression.

Abstract

Although chromosomal instability characterizes the majority of human colorectal cancers, the contribution of genes such as adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ), KRAS , and p53 to this form of genetic instability is still under debate. Here, we have assessed chromosomal imbalances in tumors from mouse models of intestinal cancer, namely Apc +/1638N , Apc +/1638N / KRAS V12G , and Apc +/1638N / Tp53 −/− , by array comparative genomic hybridization. All intestinal adenomas from Apc +/1638N mice displayed chromosomal alterations, thus confirming the presence of a chromosomal instability defect at early stages of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Moreover, loss of the Tp53 tumor suppressor gene, but not KRAS oncogenic activation, results in an increase of gains and losses of whole chromosomes in the Apc -mutant genetic background. Comparative analysis of the overall genomic alterations found in mouse intestinal tumors allowed us to identify a subset of loci syntenic with human chromosomal regions (eg, 1p34-p36, 12q24, 9q34, and 22q) frequently gained or lost in familial adenomas and sporadic colorectal cancers. The latter indicate that, during intestinal tumor development, the genetic mechanisms and the underlying functional defects are conserved across species. Hence, our array comparative genomic hybridization analysis of Apc -mutant intestinal tumors allows the definition of minimal aneuploidy regions conserved between mouse and human and likely to encompass rate-limiting genes for intestinal tumor initiation and progression.

Discussion

Extensive genome-wide chromosomal alterations, indicative of CIN, characterize the vast majority of human CRCs. 26,27 However, the molecular basis of CIN in CRC is still poorly understood, and although a number of genes have been characterized that may underlie aneuploidy (eg, BUB1 , BUBR1 , and CDC4 ), 5,28,29 the frequency at which mutations have been found in their coding regions is too low to justify the high CIN incidence found in human CRC. 29 Notably, loss of APC function results in microtubule plus-end attachment defects during mitosis and consequent chromosome misalignment and CIN. 7–9 These observations, made in cultured mammalian cells, indicate a potential role for the APC tumor suppressor gene in triggering CIN right from the start of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Accordingly, our array CGH analysis of early-stage adenomas from FAP patients carrying germline APC mutations 2 and from Apc -mutant mouse models (this study) confirm that aneuploidy is indeed found in nascent benign tumors.

It is generally accepted that the main tumor-suppressing activity of the APC gene resides in its capacity to regulate intracellular β-catenin levels as part of the canonical Wnt signal transduction pathway. 1 Hence, the observation that aneuploidy occurs at very early stages of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence is in agreement with a model in which the initial loss of APC function triggers intestinal tumor formation by constitutive activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and simultaneously results in a low but significant level of CIN. At later stages of tumor progression, somatic mutations in genes involved in mitotic and cell cycle checkpoints, telomere shortening and telomerase expression, centrosome number regulation, and double-strand break repair may work synergistically with the kinetochore and chromosome segregation defects caused by APC mutation in eliciting full-blown CIN. 1,10

Overall, our array CGH analysis has revealed chromosomal aberrations in each of the 30 mouse GI polyps analyzed. Even in the case of small low dysplastic Apc +/1638N adenomas (2 mm 3 ), an average of 12 events (gains and losses) per tumor sample is found. Notably, both in Apc +/1638N as well as in FAP adenomas, loss events were more frequently observed than gains. 2 This relatively high incidence of aneuploid changes at very early stages of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence appears to be in contrast with previous reports in which intestinal adenomas from Apc +/Min mice 30 and from FAP patients with known APC mutations 31 were shown to have stable karyotypes. This apparent discrepancy is likely to result from the different methods used in these studies. Conventional karyotype analysis and fluorescence-activated cell sorting are less sensitive than array CGH in detecting more subtle subchromosomal changes leading to allelic imbalance. Accordingly, by using a more sensitive PCR-based method, Shih and colleagues 11 also reported widespread allelic imbalance in human sporadic adenomas. As shown in the present and previous study, 2 the quantitative analysis of genomic changes by coupled LCM and whole genome BAC arrays, allows the detection of gain/loss events in small intestinal lesions (1 to 2 mm 2 ) with relatively high sensitivity and without the noise introduced by contaminating normal lymphocytes and stromal cells.

Although our results do not allow us to speculate on the mechanisms underlying this early genomic instability, we have established that aneuploid changes are observed at early stages of APC / Apc -driven intestinal tumorigenesis in both human 2 and mouse (this study). The question remains whether this genomic instability precedes the rate-limiting second hit at the Apc gene or it arises as a consequence of it. In the mouse genome, the Apc gene maps to chromosome 18. In agreement with the Knudson’s two hit model, the vast majority of intestinal tumors from Apc -mutant mice show LOH at the chromosome 18 region encompassing the wild-type Apc allele. 13,32,33 As elegantly shown by Haigis and Dove, 24 somatic mitotic recombination (and not aneuploidy) is the principal mechanism underlying loss of the wild-type Apc allele in the Apc +/Min mouse model. Because mitotic recombination does not affect copy number, it cannot be detected by array CGH analysis. Accordingly, our array CGH analysis revealed aneuploidy at chromosome 18 only in a minority of adenomas from Apc +/1638N (10%) and from Apc +/1638N / KRAS V12G and Apc +/1638N / Tp53 −/− (25%) animals. Hence, our results indirectly confirm that, in the majority of the cases, the rate-limiting LOH event at the Apc locus does not occur by interstitial deletion or nondisjunction, and is likely to result from mitotic recombination as shown for Apc +/Min . However, aneuploid changes at the Apc locus on chromosome 18 still take place in a fraction of the intestinal adenomas initiated by the Apc 1638N targeted mutation, possibly as the result of low but significant CIN levels. That APC mutations may act in a dominant-negative manner in eliciting mitotic defects 9,34 may underlie the chromosome 18 aneuploid changes observed by array CGH in adenomas from Apc +/1638N . In these cases, genomic instability may even precede the rate-limiting second hit at the wild-type Apc allele. Nevertheless, in the majority of the cases, more significant CIN levels will occur only on complete loss of Apc function, ie, after the somatic hit.

During the adenoma-carcinoma progression in CRC, genetic instability progressively increases with the accumulation of somatic mutations at specific tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. 35 The occurrence of KRAS mutations already at early adenoma stages 36–38 suggests the possibility that this oncogene may partly contribute to CIN. In fact, few studies have reported positive correlations between KRAS mutations and aneuploidization. 39,40 It has been postulated that constitutive KRAS activation may induce genomic instability via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which affects G 1 and G 2 /M cell-cycle transit times and apoptosis. 41 Moreover, KRAS can also have a role in cytoskeletal and microtubule organization of the mitotic spindle, through the regulation of Rho-like GTPases. 42 Notwithstanding these data, our results do not demonstrate any increase in the incidence and type of allelic imbalance in tumors from compound Apc +/1638N / KRAS V12G mice when compared with Apc +/1638N animals. These results are also corroborated by other studies on human CRC: no association was found between the mutational status of the KRAS gene and the number of chromosomal aberrations 43 or genomic instability. 44

The case for loss of p53 function and CIN is a more solid one. First, the p53 tumor suppressor protein has a well-characterized role as DNA damage checkpoint. 45 Moreover, several cancers characterized by aneuploidy harbor p53 mutations both in human 46–48 and in mouse models. 49 Loss of p53 function is also known to result in an increase in tetraploid and polyploid cells. 50,51 Although the CGH array technique used here does not allow to detect tetraploidy, our results indicate a significant increase in whole chromosome gains and losses among Apc +/1638N / Tp53 −/− adenomas when compared with tumors from Apc +/1638N and Apc +/1638N / KRAS V12G mice. It has been shown that p53-deficient cells fail to arrest in G 1 leading to tetraploidization and, on further progression through the cell cycle, to abnormal mitoses and aneuploidy. 52 This mechanism seems to be corroborated by the increased incidence of whole chromosome loss and gain in p53-deficient intestinal tumors.

The array CGH analysis of mouse intestinal adenomas revealed a number of chromosomal loci where allelic imbalances recurrently occur in independent tumors and throughout the three genotypes. It is therefore likely that mutations in genes encompassed within these chromosomal regions are selected at early developmental stages of intestinal tumor onset and progression. However, the chromosomal intervals affected by these recurrent aneuploidy events are usually very large, which makes the identification of individual genes underlying tumor onset and progression a formidable task. Throughout the mouse intestinal adenomas analyzed here, loss of chromosome 10 (Mb 80.1 to 80.6) and of the distal region of chromosome 15 (Mb 74.6 to 102.3) were the most frequent alterations with frequencies of 86 and 70%, respectively. The limited size (∼500 kb) delineated by the loss events within chromosome 10 somewhat facilitates the search for putative candidate cancer-related mapping within the Mb 80.1 to 80.6 interval. In silico analysis of the mouse genome sequence ( http://www.informatics.jax.org/ ) revealed 40 annotated expressed sequences, 26 of which are known genes. The localization of the Stk11 gene within this region is of particular interest in view of the causative role of this serine/threonine kinase in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, an inherited susceptibility to intestinal cancer characterized by multiple hamartomatous polyps throughout the upper GI tract and a high risk of developing cancer in the intestine and other organs. 53

To further restrict the size of the chromosomal intervals affected by gain/loss events and pinpoint specific conserved genes that play rate-limiting roles in intestinal adenoma formation in the mouse and human, we compared array CGH profiles from early FAP adenomas (obtained from carriers of known APC germline mutations) and from histology-matched intestinal tumors from Apc +/1638N mice. The results of this comparative analysis (Table 2) have indicated the presence of a surprisingly high number of chromosomal aberrations shared between mouse upper GI and human colorectal adenomas, notwithstanding the different anatomical location of these two groups of GI tumors. The above-mentioned mouse chromosome 10 region (Mb 80.1 to 80.6), where aneuploid changes have been observed in 86% of the mouse adenomas here analyzed, is orthologous to human chromosome 19p13.3, where LOH has been reported in 73% of FAP adenomas. Besides STK11 , also the APC2 gene, 54,55 previously proposed as potential tumor suppressor gene in ovarian and lung cancer, 56,57 map to the 19p13.3 chromosomal interval.

Another example is provided by the interval on mouse chromosome 15 (Mb 74 to 102), the second most frequent (70%) site of allelic imbalance in tumors from Apc +/1638N mice. This region is syntenic to human chromosomes 22q12-q13 and 12q12-q13, both previously reported to undergo LOH in FAP adenomas at high frequencies (67 and 50%, respectively). 2 Notably, at least three genes with known tumor suppressor functions in the GI tract map in human to chromosome 22q13. ST13 (suppression of tumorigenicity 13) maps to chromosome 22q13.2 and was reported to be down-regulated in CRC tissue when compared with its expression in adjacent normal tissue. 58 Bi-allelic mutations of p300, a transcriptional co-activator binding E1A also localized to chromosome 22q13.2, have been shown in several human cancers. In particular, this gene seems to function as a tumor suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium, 59 and mutations in its coding region are found at high frequency among CRC cell lines. 60 NBK/BIK is another putative tumor suppressor gene localized within a 0.5-cM region of chromosome 22q13 known as the target of frequent allelic loss in human CRC. 61 The proapoptotic function of this BCL-2 family member indeed suggests a role in tumor suppression for this protein. 62

The frequently lost interval on mouse chromosome 4 (Mb 117 to 153) is orthologous to human chromosome 1p34-p36. Among FAP adenomas, chromosome 1p36 shows loss in ∼60% of the cases, 2 thus restricting the candidate tumor suppressor genes in this 24-Mb region, to a total of 392 transcripts. Among these, the meningioma suppressor gene ALPL , 63 the prostate cancer susceptibility gene HSPG2 , 64 and CASP9 , a proapoptotic component of the caspase cascade, 65 represent interesting and worth investigating candidates.

In addition, the mouse chromosome 2 region (Mb 25 to 33) lost in 50% of the Apc 1638N adenomas, is syntenic with human chromosome 9q34. Again, chromosome 9q is frequently lost among FAP polyps. 2 The additional information obtained from the analysis of mouse intestinal tumors allows restriction of the search for candidate tumor suppressor genes to the chromosome 9q34 interval where cancer-related genes such as TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis 1) 66 and DAPK1 (death-associated protein kinase 1), 67 are known to be localized. The use of additional comparative tools, such as expression profiling analysis, is likely to further pinpoint critical genes among the still large number of transcripts ( n = 227) mapping to this subchromosomal region.

In conclusion, we have shown that allelic imbalance and aneuploid changes occur at early stages of Apc -driven intestinal tumorigenesis in mouse. Whereas introduction of an oncogenic KRAS mutation does not alter the overall frequency and type of aneuploid changes, loss of Tp53 function increases the incidence of whole chromosome loss and gain events. Notably, the chromosomal intervals frequently affected by aneuploid changes in Apc -mutant tumors are syntenic to genomic regions known to be frequently lost or gained in adenomatous polyps from FAP carriers of germline APC mutations. This comparative genomic profiling approach, when combined with gene expression signatures from human and mouse tumors and coupled with functional tumor suppression assays, will allow the identification of novel genes involved in intestinal tumor onset and progression.
