Tail-anchored (TA) membrane proteins destined for the endoplasmic reticulum are 
chaperoned by cytosolic targeting factors that deliver them to a membrane 
receptor for insertion. Although a basic framework for TA protein recognition is 
now emerging, the decisive targeting and membrane insertion steps are not 
understood. Here we reconstitute the TA protein insertion cycle with purified 
components, present crystal structures of key complexes between these components 
and perform mutational analyses based on the structures. We show that a 
committed targeting complex, formed by a TA protein bound to the chaperone 
ATPase Get3, is initially recruited to the membrane through an interaction with 
Get2. Once the targeting complex has been recruited, Get1 interacts with Get3 to 
drive TA protein release in an ATPase-dependent reaction. After releasing its TA 
protein cargo, the now-vacant Get3 recycles back to the cytosol concomitant with 
ATP binding. This work provides a detailed structural and mechanistic framework 
for the minimal TA protein insertion cycle.
