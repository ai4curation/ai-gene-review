BACKGROUND: Survivin is a mammalian protein that carries a motif typical of the 
inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)proteins, first identified in baculoviruses. 
Although baculoviral IAP proteins regulate cell death, the yeast Survivin 
homolog Bir1 is involved in cell division. To determine the function of Survivin 
in mammals, we analyzed the pattern of localization of Survivin protein during 
the cell cycle, and deleted its gene by homologous recombination in mice.
RESULTS: In human cells, Survivin appeared first on centromeres bound to a novel 
para-polar axis during prophase/metaphase, relocated to the spindle midzone 
during anaphase/telophase, and disappeared at the end of telophase. In the 
mouse, Survivin was required for mitosis during development. Null embryos showed 
disrupted microtubule formation, became polyploid, and failed to survive beyond 
4.5days post coitum. This phenotype, and the cell-cycle localization of 
Survivin, resembled closely those of INCENP. Because the yeast homolog of 
INCENP, Sli15, regulates the Aurora kinase homolog Ipl1p, and the yeast Survivin 
homolog Bir1 binds to Ndc10p, a substrate of Ipl1p, yeast Survivin, INCENP and 
Aurora homologs function in concert during cell division.
CONCLUSIONS: In vertebrates, Survivin and INCENP have related roles in mitosis, 
coordinating events such as microtubule organization, cleavage-furrow formation 
and cytokinesis. Like their yeast homologs Bir1 and Sli15, they may also act 
together with the Aurora kinase.
