Most eukaryotic cells elaborate several proteoglycans critical for transmitting 
biochemical signals into and between cells. However, the regulation of 
proteoglycan biosynthesis is not completely understood. We show that the 
atypical secretory kinase family with sequence similarity 20, member B (Fam20B) 
phosphorylates the initiating xylose residue in the proteoglycan tetrasaccharide 
linkage region, and that this event functions as a molecular switch to regulate 
subsequent glycosaminoglycan assembly. Proteoglycans from FAM20B knockout cells 
contain a truncated tetrasaccharide linkage region consisting of a disaccharide 
capped with sialic acid (Siaα2-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1) that cannot be further elongated. 
We also show that the activity of galactosyl transferase II (GalT-II, B3GalT6), 
a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the tetrasaccharide linkage region, is 
dramatically increased by Fam20B-dependent xylose phosphorylation. Inactivating 
mutations in the GALT-II gene (B3GALT6) associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 
cause proteoglycan maturation defects similar to FAM20B deletion. Collectively, 
our findings suggest that GalT-II function is impaired by loss of 
Fam20B-dependent xylose phosphorylation and reveal a previously unappreciated 
mechanism for regulation of proteoglycan biosynthesis.

Abstract

Most eukaryotic cells elaborate several proteoglycans critical for transmitting biochemical signals into and between cells. However, the regulation of proteoglycan biosynthesis is not completely understood. We show that the atypical secretory kinase family with sequence similarity 20, member B (Fam20B) phosphorylates the initiating xylose residue in the proteoglycan tetrasaccharide linkage region, and that this event functions as a molecular switch to regulate subsequent glycosaminoglycan assembly. Proteoglycans from FAM20B knockout cells contain a truncated tetrasaccharide linkage region consisting of a disaccharide capped with sialic acid (Siaα2–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1) that cannot be further elongated. We also show that the activity of galactosyl transferase II (GalT-II, B3GalT6), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the tetrasaccharide linkage region, is dramatically increased by Fam20B-dependent xylose phosphorylation. Inactivating mutations in the GALT-II gene ( B3GALT6 ) associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome cause proteoglycan maturation defects similar to FAM20B deletion. Collectively, our findings suggest that GalT-II function is impaired by loss of Fam20B-dependent xylose phosphorylation and reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism for regulation of proteoglycan biosynthesis.
