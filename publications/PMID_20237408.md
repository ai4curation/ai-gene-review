Antibody deficiencies constitute the largest group of symptomatic primary 
immunodeficiency diseases. In several patients, mutations in CD19 have been 
found to underlie disease, demonstrating the critical role for the protein 
encoded by this gene in antibody responses; CD19 functions in a complex with 
CD21, CD81, and CD225 to signal with the B cell receptor upon antigen 
recognition. We report here a patient with severe nephropathy and profound 
hypogammaglobulinemia. The immunodeficiency was characterized by decreased 
memory B cell numbers, impaired specific antibody responses, and an absence of 
CD19 expression on B cells. The patient had normal CD19 alleles but carried a 
homozygous CD81 mutation resulting in a complete lack of CD81 expression on 
blood leukocytes. Retroviral transduction and glycosylation experiments on 
EBV-transformed B cells from the patient revealed that CD19 membrane expression 
critically depended on CD81. Similar to CD19-deficient patients, CD81-deficient 
patients had B cells that showed impaired activation upon stimulation via the B 
cell antigen receptor but no overt T cell subset or function defects. In this 
study, we present what we believe to be the first antibody deficiency syndrome 
caused by a mutation in the CD81 gene and consequent disruption of the CD19 
complex on B cells. These findings may contribute to unraveling the genetic 
basis of antibody deficiency syndromes and the nonredundant functions of CD81 in 
humans.
