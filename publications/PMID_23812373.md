The Hsp70-interacting protein, Hip, cooperates with the chaperone Hsp70 in 
protein folding and prevention of aggregation. Hsp70 interacts with non-native 
protein substrates in an ATP-dependent reaction cycle regulated by J-domain 
proteins and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). Hip is thought to delay 
substrate release by slowing ADP dissociation from Hsp70. Here we present 
crystal structures of the dimerization domain and the tetratricopeptide repeat 
(TPR) domain of rat Hip. As shown in a cocrystal structure, the TPR core of Hip 
interacts with the Hsp70 ATPase domain through an extensive interface, to form a 
bracket that locks ADP in the binding cleft. Hip and NEF binding to Hsp70 are 
mutually exclusive, and thus Hip attenuates active cycling of Hsp70-substrate 
complexes. This mechanism explains how Hip enhances aggregation prevention by 
Hsp70 and facilitates transfer of specific proteins to downstream chaperones or 
the proteasome.
