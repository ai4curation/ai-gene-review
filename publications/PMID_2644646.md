The genes specifying chemotaxis, motility, and flagellar function in Escherichia 
coli are coordinately regulated and form a large and complex regulon. Despite 
the importance of these genes in controlling bacterial behavior, little is known 
of the molecular mechanisms that regulate their expression. We have identified a 
minor form of E. coli RNA polymerase that specifically transcribes several E. 
coli chemotaxis/flagellar genes in vitro and is likely to carry out 
transcription of these genes in vivo. The enzyme was purified to near 
homogeneity based on its ability to initiate transcription of the E. coli tar 
chemotaxis gene at start sites that are used in vivo. Specific tar transcription 
activity is associated with a polypeptide of apparent 28-kDa molecular mass that 
remains bound to the E. coli RNA polymerase throughout purification. This 
peptide behaves as a secondary sigma factor--designated sigma F--because it 
restores specific tar transcription activity when added to core RNA polymerase. 
The sigma F holoenzyme also transcribes the E. coli tsr and flaAI genes in vitro 
as well as several Bacillus subtilis genes that are transcribed specifically by 
the sigma 28 form of B. subtilis RNA polymerase. The latter holoenzyme is 
implicated in transcription of flagellar and chemotaxis genes in B. subtilis. 
Hence E. coli sigma F holoenzyme appears to be analogous to the B. subtilis 
sigma 28 RNA polymerase, both in its promoter specificity and in the nature of 
the regulon it controls.
