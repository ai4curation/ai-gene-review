A high protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity is required to maintain 
circulating T lymphocytes in a resting phenotype, and to limit the initiation of 
T cell activation. We report that 15 of the currently known 24 intracellular 
PTPases are expressed in T cells, namely HePTP, TCPTP, SHP1, SHP2, PEP, 
PTP-PEST, PTP-MEG2, PTEN, PTPH1, PTP-MEG1, PTP36, PTP-BAS, LMPTP, PRL-1 and 
OV-1. Most were found in the cytosol and many were enriched at the plasma 
membrane. Only TCPTP and PTP-MEG2 had subcellular localizations that essentially 
excludes them from a direct role in early T cell antigen receptor signaling 
events. Overexpression of 6 of the PTPases reduced IL-2 gene activation, 3 of 
them thereby identified as novel candidates for negative regulators of TCR 
signaling. Our findings expand the repertoire of PTPases that should be 
considered for a regulatory role in T cell activation.
