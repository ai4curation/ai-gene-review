Oral estrogen administration attenuates the metabolic action of growth hormone 
(GH) in humans. To investigate the mechanism involved, we studied the effects of 
estrogen on GH signaling through Janus kinase (JAK)2 and the signal transducers 
and activators of transcription (STATs) in HEK293 cells stably expressing the GH 
receptor (293GHR), HuH7 (hepatoma) and T-47D (breast cancer) cells. 293GHR cells 
were transiently transfected with an estrogen receptor-alpha expression plasmid 
and luciferase reporters with binding elements for STAT3 and STAT5 or the 
beta-casein promoter. GH stimulated the reporter activities by four- to sixfold. 
Cotreatment with 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) resulted in a dose-dependent reduction 
in the response of all three reporters to GH to a maximum of 49-66% of control 
at 100 nM (P < 0.05). No reduction was seen when E(2) was added 1-2 h after GH 
treatment. Similar inhibitory effects were observed in HuH7 and T-47D cells. 
E(2) suppressed GH-induced JAK2 phosphorylation, an effect attenuated by 
actinomycin D, suggesting a requirement for gene expression. Next, we 
investigated the role of the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) in E(2) 
inhibition. E(2) increased the mRNA abundance of SOCS-2 but not SOCS-1 and 
SOCS-3 in HEK293 cells. The inhibitory effect of E(2) was absent in cells 
lacking SOCS-2 but not in those lacking SOCS-1 and SOCS-3. In conclusion, 
estrogen inhibits GH signaling, an action mediated by SOCS-2. This paper 
provides evidence for regulatory interaction between a sex steroid and the 
GHJAKSTAT pathway, in which SOCS-2 plays a central mechanistic role.
