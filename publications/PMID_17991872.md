BACKGROUND: We have previously reported the potentiation of PDGF-BB-induced 
chemotaxis of fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells 
by FVIIa. Here we studied the role of TF/FVIIa and the induced signaling 
pathways in regulation of chemotaxis of human monocytes, fibroblasts, and 
porcine aorta endothelial cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Human monocytes were obtained by using Ficoll-Paque 
gradient and the MACS system (for highly purified population), fibroblasts and 
PAE cells have been characterized previously. Inhibitors of selected signaling 
intermediates were used, and the effect of TF/FVIIa on the migratory response of 
all cells to chemotactic agents was analyzed. The induced signaling was studied 
by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. TF/FVIIa complex selectively 
enhanced PDGF-BB-induced chemotaxis in a Src-family, PLC, and PAR-2-dependent 
manner. Using PAE cells we identified c-Src and c-Yes as the Src-family members 
activated by TF/FVIIa. We report for the first time the PAR-2 and Src 
family-dependent transactivation of PDGFRbeta by TF/FVIIa involving 
phosphorylation of a subset of PDGFRbeta tyrosines.
CONCLUSIONS: The described transactivation is a likely mechanism of 
TF/FVIIa-mediated regulation of PDGF-BB-induced chemotaxis. Similar behavior of 
3 principally different cell types in our experimental setup may reflect a 
general function of TF in regulation of cell migration.
