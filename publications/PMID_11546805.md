The insulin and the endothelin type A (ETA) receptor both can couple into the 
heterotrimeric G protein alpha(q/11) (Galpha(q/11)), leading to Galpha(q/11) 
tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, and 
subsequent stimulation of glucose transport. In this study, we assessed the 
potential role of Src kinase in ET-1 signaling to glucose transport in 3T3-L1 
adipocytes. Src kinase inhibitor PP2 blocked ET-1-induced Src kinase activity, 
Galpha(q/11) tyrosine phosphorylation, and glucose transport stimulation. To 
determine which Src family kinase member was involved, we microinjected 
anti-c-Src, -c-Fyn, or -c-Yes antibody into these cells and found that only 
anti-c-Yes antibody blocked GLUT4 translocation (70% decreased). Overexpression 
or microinjection of a dominant negative mutant (K298M) of Src kinase also 
inhibited ET-1-induced Galpha(q/11) tyrosine phosphorylation and GLUT4 
translocation. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that 
beta-arrestin 1 associated with the ETA receptor in an agonist-dependent manner 
and that beta-arrestin 1 recruited Src kinase to a molecular complex that 
included the ETA receptor. Microinjection of beta-arrestin 1 antibody inhibited 
ET-1- but not insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. In conclusion, 1) the Src 
kinase Yes can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Galpha(q/11) in response to 
ET-1 stimulation, and 2) beta-arrestin 1 and Src kinase form a molecular complex 
with the ETA receptor to mediate ET-1 signaling to Galpha(q/11) with subsequent 
glucose transport stimulation.
