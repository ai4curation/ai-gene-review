Binding of the protein tyrosine kinase p56(lck) to T-cell co-receptors CD4 and 
CD8alpha is necessary for T-lymphocyte development and activation. Association 
of p56(lck) with CD4 requires two conserved cysteine residues in the cytosolic 
domain of CD4 and two in the amino terminus of p56(lck), consistent with the 
notion that these four residues coordinate a single metal atom (1-5). Here we 
demonstrate that Zn2+ is essential for complex formation. In an in vitro binding 
reaction, Zn2+ mediates p56(lck) association with a glutathione S-transferase 
(GST) fusion protein containing the cytosolic domains of CD4 or CD8alpha; no 
other metals tested support binding. Treatment of preformed GST-CD4.p56(lck) 
dimers with the Zn2+ chelators 1,10-O-phenanthroline or 
8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid results in dissociation of GST-CD4 from 
p56(lck), consistent with the finding of Huse et al. (5) that Zn2+ is contained 
within similar complexes. Furthermore, we show that, within live cells, 
CD4.p56(lck) and CD8alpha.p56(lck) interactions occur in a zinc-dependent 
fashion. Specifically, pretreatment of the human Jurkat T-cell line with 
membrane permeable zinc chelators disrupts CD4.p56(lck) complexes, and treatment 
of COS cells co-expressing CD8alpha and p56(lck) with such chelators likewise 
leads to dissociation of CD8alpha.p56(lck) complexes. CD4. p56(lck) and 
CD8alpha.p56(lck) represent the first examples of intracellular proteins that 
require zinc as a bridge for heterodimerization.
