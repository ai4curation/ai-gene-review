During transduction of an apoptotic (death) signal into the cell, there is an 
alteration in the permeability of the membranes of the cell's mitochondria, 
which causes the translocation of the apoptogenic protein cytochrome c into the 
cytoplasm, which in turn activates death-driving proteolytic proteins known as 
caspases. The Bcl-2 family of proteins, whose members may be anti-apoptotic or 
pro-apoptotic, regulates cell death by controlling this mitochondrial membrane 
permeability during apoptosis, but how that is achieved is unclear. Here we 
create liposomes that carry the mitochondrial porin channel (also called the 
voltage-dependent anion channel, or VDAC) to show that the recombinant 
pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak accelerate the opening of VDAC, whereas the 
anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x(L) closes VDAC by binding to it directly. Bax and 
Bak allow cytochrome c to pass through VDAC out of liposomes, but passage is 
prevented by Bcl-x(L). In agreement with this, VDAC1-deficient mitochondria from 
a mutant yeast did not exhibit a Bax/Bak-induced loss in membrane potential and 
cytochrome c release, both of which were inhibited by Bcl-x(L). Our results 
indicate that the Bcl-2 family of proteins bind to the VDAC in order to regulate 
the mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c during 
apoptosis.
