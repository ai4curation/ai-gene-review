Ribosomes are highly sophisticated translation machines that have been 
demonstrated to be heterogeneous in the regulation of protein synthesis1,2. Male 
germ cell development involves complex translational regulation during sperm 
formation3. However, it remains unclear whether translation during sperm 
formation is performed by a specific ribosome. Here we report a ribosome with a 
specialized nascent polypeptide exit tunnel, RibosomeST, that is assembled with 
the male germ-cell-specific protein RPL39L, the paralogue of core ribosome 
(RibosomeCore) protein RPL39. Deletion of RibosomeST in mice causes defective 
sperm formation, resulting in substantially reduced fertility. Our comparison of 
single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of ribosomes from mouse 
kidneys and testes indicates that RibosomeST features a ribosomal polypeptide 
exit tunnel of distinct size and charge states compared with RibosomeCore. 
RibosomeST predominantly cotranslationally regulates the folding of a subset of 
male germ-cell-specific proteins that are essential for the formation of sperm. 
Moreover, we found that specialized functions of RibosomeST were not replaceable 
by RibosomeCore. Taken together, identification of this sperm-specific ribosome 
should greatly expand our understanding of ribosome function and tissue-specific 
regulation of protein expression pattern in mammals.
