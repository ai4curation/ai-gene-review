Many types of human cancers having hyperactivated Wnt signaling display no 
causative alterations in known effectors of this pathway. Here, we report a 
function of TGIF in Wnt signaling. TGIF associates with and diverts Axin1 and 
Axin2 from the β-catenin destruction complex, therefore allowing β-catenin 
accrual. Intriguingly, activation of Wnt signaling induces the expression of 
TGIF, which unveils a feed-forward loop that ensures effective integration of 
Wnt signaling. In triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), elevated levels of TGIF 
correlate with high Wnt signaling and poor survival of patients. Moreover, 
genetic experiments revealed that Tgif1 ablation impeded mammary tumor 
development in MMTV-Wnt1 mice, further underscoring a requirement of TGIF for 
oncogenic Wnt signaling.

INTRODUCTION

The Wnt signaling pathway regulates a plethora of important cellular processes, such as specification of developmental fate, proliferation, and differentiation. For example, Wnt signaling coordinates proliferation and differentiation of stem/progenitor cells in a variety of epithelial tissues, including the mammary gland ( Clevers and Nusse, 2012 ; MacDonald et al., 2009 ; Moon et al., 2004 ). The broad theme that has emerged from extensive examination of Wnt signaling is that any perturbation in this circuitry disturbs tissue homeostasis, culminating in many diseases, most prominent among them cancer. Broadly recognized mechanisms behind Wnt signaling hyperactivation in cancers include mutations of pathway components and elevated autocrine signaling due to constitutive production of Wnt ligands ( Clevers and Nusse, 2012 ; MacDonald et al., 2009 ; Moon et al., 2004 ).

Wnt ligands initiate signaling by binding to two types of cell surface receptors: the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6), and the Frizzled (Fz) family of serpentine proteins ( Clevers and Nusse, 2012 ; MacDonald et al., 2009 ; Moon et al., 2004 ). Over the past few years, there have been tremendous advances in elucidating the molecular mechanisms operating downstream of Wnt receptors to trigger activation of canonical β-Catenin signaling. The most prevalent model implies that engagement of Wnt with the Fz/LRP5/6 receptor complex provokes squelching of Axin1, which functions in resting cells as a scaffold for the β-Catenin destruction complex, bringing together adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), β-Catenin, casein kinase 1 (CK1), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and ubiquitin E3 ligase βTRCP, among others. Within this destruction complex, CK1 and GSK3 sequentially phosphorylate β-Catenin, resulting in its recognition by βTRCP, and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Upon ligand binding, recruitment of Axin1 to LRP5/6 leads to disassembly of the destruction complex, resulting in increased β-Catenin accumulation ( Clevers and Nusse, 2012 ; MacDonald et al., 2009 ; Moon et al., 2004 ). An alternative model emerged recently is that activation of Wnt signaling does not merely affect assembly or composition of the destruction complex but instead hinders ubiquitination and clearance of β-Catenin within an intact complex, leading to saturation and inactivation of the destruction complex by phosphorylated β-Catenin ( Li et al., 2012 ). Consequently, newly synthesized, non-phosphorylated β-Catenin escapes degradation by the saturated destruction complex and accumulates in the nucleus. Irrespective of the molecular mechanisms by which activated Wnt signaling achieves accumulation and translocation of β-Catenin into the nucleus, recruitment of β-Catenin to promoters of target genes via interaction with enhancer factor/T cell family (TCF) transcription factors stands as the main apparatus fulfilling the canonical Wnt transcriptional program ( Clevers and Nusse, 2012 ; MacDonald et al., 2009 ; Moon et al., 2004 ).

Transforming growth-interacting factor (TGIF) belongs to the superfamily of TALE homeodomain proteins that control many biological processes, including embryonic development, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Genetic ablation of Tgif1 in mice resulted in a large spectrum of phenotypes, including placental defects, craniofacial abnormalities, and runting ( Bartholin et al., 2008 ; Taniguchi et al., 2012 ). Perhaps the most extensively studied function of TGIF is suppression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling, which has prominent and widespread roles in cancer ( Massague, 2008 ; Seo et al., 2006 ; Wotton et al., 1999 ). TGF-β initiates responses by binding to and activating a cell surface receptor complex composed of TβRI and TβRII serine threonine kinases, which then propagate signals by phosphorylating the downstream effectors Smad2 and Smad3 ( Feng and Derynck, 2005 ; Massague, 2008 ). The mechanism of TGIF-induced suppression of TGF-β signaling has been primarily attributed to its ability to recruit a complex of general transcriptional corepressors to DNA-bound Smad transcription complexes ( Wotton et al., 1999 ). However, our recent findings argued that TGIF can also function through mechanisms unrelated to transcriptional repression ( Faresse et al., 2008 ; Seo et al., 2006 ; Seo et al., 2004 ). Together, these observations highlighted an ability of TGIF to antagonize TGF-β signaling in multiple fashions.

Besides its ability to restrict the TGF-β tumor suppressor network, there is evidence that TGIF may function as an oncogenic protein in multiple settings, as exemplified by its ability to confer a full malignant phenotype upon ectopic expression in cell systems ( Ettahar et al., 2013 ; Seo et al., 2006 ). Notwithstanding these intriguing hints, it is becoming increasingly clear that additional efforts should be put into discovery of molecular mechanisms of TGIF-induced carcinogenesis, as they remain mostly enigmatic. In this study, we sought to investigate whether TGIF contributes to oncogenic Wnt signaling in the mammary gland.

DISCUSSION

A key regulatory step in Wnt signaling is the regulation of β-Catenin abundance by a cytoplasmic destruction complex composed of Axin1 or Axin2, APC, GSK3, CK1, and βTRCP. Axin1 and Axin2 function as scaffolding platforms for this β-Catenin destruction complex, coordinating consecutive phosphorylations of β-Catenin by CK1 and GSK3 that marks β-Catenin for ubiquitination by βTRCP, leading to β-Catenin degradation by the proteasome ( Clevers and Nusse, 2012 ; MacDonald et al., 2009 ; Moon et al., 2004 ). Because Axin1 and Axin2 are deemed to be the rate-limiting constituents of the destruction complex, the vast majority of the destruction complex-oriented studies were devoted to delineating the mechanisms governing the availability and/or abundance of Axin1 and Axin2 in the cytoplasm, including sequestration by LRP5/6, ADP-ribosylation by tankyrase, or phosphorylation by GSK3 ( Huang et al., 2009 ; Kim et al., 2013 ; Mao et al., 2001 ). However, since Axin1 and Axin2 shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus ( Cong and Varmus, 2004 ; Yook et al., 2006 ), one would envision that other mechanisms might also impose a control over assembly of the destruction complex. Our present study reveals an interaction between TGIF and Axin1 or Axin2 in the nucleus that seems to play an important role in Wnt signaling.

Our results clearly demonstrate that TGIF sequesters Axin1 or Axin2 into the nucleus and thereby interfering with the assembly of the β-Catenin destruction complex, leading to β-Catenin accrual. Consistent with this observation, TGIF is essential for activation of the Wnt transcriptional program both in vitro and in vivo. Intriguingly, activation of Wnt signaling induces expression of TGIF, suggesting that TGIF might function to coordinate a feed-forward loop that ensures effective integration of Wnt signaling. Congruent with our findings, Tgif1 knockout mice display phenotypes similar to those observed in Wnt2 knockout mice, including abnormal placental defects, premature death, and runting ( Bartholin et al., 2008 ; Monkley et al., 1996 ). Likewise, both Tgif1 and Axin2 knockout mice display craniofacial abnormalities ( Taniguchi et al., 2012 ; Yu et al., 2005 ), further supporting the link of TGIF to canonical Wnt signaling.

Based on our findings, we propose a model in which TGIF plays active roles in both the absence and presence of Wnt signaling by limiting the cytosolic pools of Axin1 or Axin2 that are typically dedicated to the assembly of the β-Catenin destruction complex ( Figure 8C ). Taking into consideration the current prevailing models of Wnt signaling ( Clevers and Nusse, 2012 ; Li et al., 2012 ; MacDonald et al., 2009 ; Moon et al., 2004 ), we speculated that this antagonistic mechanism might function to fine tune the destruction complex assembly to enable β-Catenin to accumulate to an extent that ensures integration of suitable levels of endogenous Wnt signaling needed to maintain normal cell function and tissue homeostasis. Alternatively, TGIF could function at steady state conditions to facilitate saturation of the destruction complex by newly synthesized β-Catenin, which in turn enables cells to respond efficiently to an acute activation of Wnt signaling. Finally, it is also conceivable that TGIF might function to implement sustained Wnt signaling depending on the pathophysiological setting, cell behaviors, or alterations in components of the destruction complex other than Axin1 or Axin2. As such, the molecular framework that we propose will likely contribute to the elucidation of mechanistic paradigms of the destruction complex irrespective of its fate (i.e., saturation, disassembly) subsequent to activation of Wnt signaling.

Our study also underscores an ability of TGIF to promote Wnt-driven mammary tumor pathogenesis. Interestingly, both pharmacological and genetic experiments demonstrate that TGIF promotes mammary hyperplasia in MMTV-Wnt1 mice by activating Wnt signaling rather than repressing TGF-β signaling. Recent xenograft studies showed that activation of Wnt signaling can either promote growth or trigger squamous differentiation of human breast cancer cells depending on the cellular context ( Green et al., 2013 ). Since deletion of Tgif1 in MMTV-Wnt1 mice was effective in blocking mammary tumor, one would suggest that TGIF might function as a key component of oncogenic Wnt signaling, although we cannot rule out the possibility that TGIF also contributes to Wnt-driven squamous cell differentiation under other conditions. Further studies will be required to clarify this issue.

Although our analyses revealed increased TGIF expression in TNBC, we did not find TGIF1 amplification. Moreover, we found only one missense mutation (substitution R228 to I) in TGIF1 in the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) database, further ruling out the existence of significant genetic alterations that could account for the deregulation of TGIF expression in this malignancy. Recently, we reported that the gene encoding PHRF1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that drives TGIF degradation, was deleted in 21.6% of human breast cancers ( Ettahar et al., 2013 ). On the basis of this observation, it is appealing to speculate that recurrent deletion of PHRF1 in breast cancer could represent one potential mechanism that governs TGIF accumulation. However, initial analysis of datasets available in public databases failed to reveal any significant correlation between PHRF1 deletion and TGIF1 gene expression in TNBC or other breast cancer subtypes, suggesting that accumulation of TGIF may involve additional mechanisms. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the increased TGIF expression in TNBC will require more extensive and comprehensive investigations.

From a translational perspective, we validated the relationship between TGIF and Wnt signaling in human breast cancer. Notably, we found a correlation between the TGIF expression levels and activation of Wnt signaling in breast cancers ( Miller et al., 2005 ; Pawitan et al., 2005 ; Wang et al., 2005 ; Yu et al., 2008 ). Moreover, our analyses revealed that TGIF and β-Catenin are overexpressed in a high proportion of TNBC samples as compared to normal tissue or other breast cancer subtypes. Finally, we detected a trend toward a poorer outcome for the TNBC with a higher expression of TGIF. Besides these findings with potential prognostic impact, our data also highlighted a requirement of TGIF for Wnt-driven mammary tumor formation in vivo, giving rise to another framework for future investigation of TGIF as a potential target for anti-cancer drug design to curb aberrant Wnt signaling in TNBC, and possibly other malignancies harboring hyperactive Wnt signaling.

In summary, our data unveil a functional interplay between TGIF and Axin1 or Axin2 that appears to evolve into a feed-forward loop to sustain Wnt signaling. Since TGIF appeared to contribute to Wnt-induced mammary hyperplasia, this amplification mechanism could conceptually deepen oncogenic Wnt signaling capabilities to an extent that ultimately compromises tissue homeostasis, culminating in neoplasia. Thus, by identifying TGIF as an essential component of Wnt signaling, our findings provide important insights into mechanistic paradigms of aberrant Wnt signaling in human malignancies.
