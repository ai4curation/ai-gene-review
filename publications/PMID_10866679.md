We examined the relationship between polarized growth and division site 
selection, two fundamental processes important for proper development of 
eukaryotes. Diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells exhibit an ellipsoidal shape 
and a specific division pattern (a bipolar budding pattern). We found that the 
polarity genes SPA2, PEA2, BUD6, and BNI1 participate in a crucial step of bud 
morphogenesis, apical growth. Deleting these genes results in round cells and 
diminishes bud elongation in mutants that exhibit pronounced apical growth. 
Examination of distribution of the polarized secretion marker Sec4 demonstrates 
that spa2Delta, pea2Delta, bud6Delta, and bni1Delta mutants fail to concentrate 
Sec4 at the bud tip during apical growth and at the division site during 
repolarization just prior to cytokinesis. Moreover, cell surface expansion is 
not confined to the distal tip of the bud in these mutants. In addition, we 
found that the p21-activated kinase homologue Ste20 is also important for both 
apical growth and bipolar bud site selection. We further examined how the 
duration of polarized growth affects bipolar bud site selection by using 
mutations in cell cycle regulators that control the timing of growth phases. The 
grr1Delta mutation enhances apical growth by stabilizing G(1) cyclins and 
increases the distal-pole budding in diploids. Prolonging polarized growth 
phases by disrupting the G(2)/M cyclin gene CLB2 enhances the accuracy of bud 
site selection in wild-type, spa2Delta, and ste20Delta cells, whereas shortening 
the polarized growth phases by deleting SWE1 decreases the fidelity of bipolar 
budding. This study reports the identification of components required for apical 
growth and demonstrates the critical role of polarized growth in bipolar bud 
site selection. We propose that apical growth and repolarization at the site of 
cytokinesis are crucial for establishing spatial cues used by diploid yeast 
cells to position division planes.
