Histone acetylation is maintained through the action of histone 
acetyltransferases and deacetylases and has been correlated with increased gene 
activity. To investigate the functional role of these enzymes in the regulation 
of transcription, we have purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae two histone 
deacetylase activities, HDA and HDB, with molecular masses of approximately 350 
and 600 kDa, respectively. In vitro, the HDA activity deacetylates all four core 
histones, has a preference for histone H3, and is strongly inhibited by 
trichostatin A (a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases). HDB is 
considerably less sensitive to trichostatin A. We report the extensive 
purification of the HDA activity and the identification of peptides (p75, p73, 
p72, and p71) whose presence correlates with deacetylase activity on native 
polyacrylamide gels. An antibody to p75 immunoprecipitates peptides with 
molecular masses similar to those in the 350-kDa complex. Additionally, 
antibodies to p75 and p71 specifically precipitate histone deacetylase activity 
and co-immunoprecipitate each other. Gene disruptions of p75 (HDA1) or p71 
(HDA3) cause the loss of the 350-kDa (but not the 600-kDa) activity from our 
chromatography profiles. These data argue strongly that HDA1 and HDA3 are 
subunits of the HDA complex, which is structurally distinct from the second, HDB 
complex.
