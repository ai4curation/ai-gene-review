Selection of aptamers from nucleic acid libraries by in vitro evolution 
represents a powerful method of identifying high-affinity ligands for a broad 
range of molecular targets. Nevertheless, a sizeable fraction of proteins remain 
difficult targets due to inherently limited chemical diversity of nucleic acids. 
We have exploited synthetic nucleotide modifications that confer protein-like 
diversity on a nucleic acid scaffold, resulting in a new generation of binding 
reagents called SOMAmers (Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamers). Here we report a 
unique crystal structure of a SOMAmer bound to its target, platelet-derived 
growth factor B (PDGF-BB). The SOMAmer folds into a compact structure and 
exhibits a hydrophobic binding surface that mimics the interface between PDGF-BB 
and its receptor, contrasting sharply with mainly polar interactions seen in 
traditional protein-binding aptamers. The modified nucleotides circumvent the 
intrinsic diversity constraints of natural nucleic acids, thereby greatly 
expanding the structural vocabulary of nucleic acid ligands and considerably 
broadening the range of accessible protein targets.
