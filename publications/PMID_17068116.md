Unlike the small intestine and colon where gamma-radiation-induced apoptosis has 
previously been well characterized, the response of murine gastric epithelium to 
gamma-radiation has not been investigated in detail. Apoptosis was therefore 
assessed on a cell positional basis in gastric antral and corpus glands from 
adult male mice following gamma-radiation. Maximum numbers of apoptotic cells 
were observed in both antrum and corpus at 48 h and at radiation doses greater 
than 12 Gy. However, the number of apoptotic cells observed in the gastric 
epithelium was much lower than observed in the small intestine or colon after 
similar doses of radiation. Hematoxylin and eosin, caspase 3 
immunohistochemistry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 
deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling detected similar numbers and cell 
positional distributions of apoptotic cells, hence hematoxylin and eosin was 
used for subsequent studies. The highest numbers of apoptotic cells were 
observed at cell positions 5-6 in the antrum and cell positions 15-18 in the 
corpus. These distributions coincided with the distributions of PCNA-labeled 
proliferating cells, but not with the distributions of H(+)-K(+)-ATPase-labeled 
parietal cells or TFF2-labeled mucous neck cells. Decreased numbers of apoptotic 
gastric epithelial cells were observed in p53-null, bak-null, and bax-null mice 
compared with wild-type counterparts 6 and 48 h after 12 Gy gamma-radiation. 
Significantly increased numbers of apoptotic gastric epithelial cells were 
observed in bcl-2-null mice compared with wild-type littermates 6 h after 12 Gy 
gamma-radiation. Radiation therefore induces apoptosis in the proliferative zone 
of mouse gastric epithelium. This response is regulated by the expression of 
p53, bak, bax, and bcl-2.
