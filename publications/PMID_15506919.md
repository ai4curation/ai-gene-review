Epigenetics is the alteration of phenotype without affecting the genotype. An 
underlying molecular mechanism of epigenetics is the changes of chromatin 
structure by covalent histone modifications and nucleosome reorganization. In 
the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two of the most well-studied macromolecular 
complexes that perform these epigenetic changes are the ATP-dependent Swi/Snf 
chromatin-remodelling complex and the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex. To 
understand fully the mechanism by which these large protein complexes perform 
their functions in the cell, it is crucial that all the subunits of these 
complexes are identified. In an attempt to identify new subunits associated with 
SAGA and Swi/Snf, we used tandem affinity purification, followed by a 
multidimensional protein identification technology to analyse the subunit 
composition. Our analysis identified two novel proteins, one associated with 
SAGA, YPL047W (Sgf11), and another associated with Swi/Snf, Rtt102.
