Hypertonicity activates the transcription factor TonEBP/OREBP, resulting in 
increased expression of osmoprotective genes, including those responsible for 
accumulation of organic osmolytes and heat-shock proteins. Phosphorylation of 
TonEBP/OREBP contributes to its activation. Several of the kinases that are 
involved were previously identified, but the phosphatases were not. In the 
present studies we screened a genomewide human phosphatase siRNA library in 
human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells for effects on TonEBP/OREBP 
transcriptional activity. We found that siRNAs against 57 phosphatases 
significantly alter TonEBP/OREBP transcriptional activity during normotonicity 
(290 mosmol/kg) or hypertonicity (500 mosmol/kg, NaCl added) or both. Most 
siRNAs increase TonEBP/OREBP activity, implying that the targeted phosphatases 
normally reduce that activity. We further studied in detail SHP-1, whose 
knockdown by its specific siRNA increases TonEBP/OREBP transcriptional activity 
at 500 mosmol/kg. We confirmed that SHP-1 is inhibitory by overexpressing it, 
which reduces TonEBP/OREBP transcriptional activity at 500 mosmol/kg. SHP-1 
dephosphorylates TonEBP/OREBP at a known regulatory site, Y143, both in vivo and 
in vitro. It inhibits TonEBP/OREBP by both reducing TonEBP/OREBP nuclear 
localization, which is Y143 dependent, and by lowering high NaCl-induced 
TonEBP/OREBP transactivating activity. SHP-1 coimmunoprecipitates with 
TonEBP/OREBP and vice versa, suggesting that they are physically associated in 
the cell. High NaCl inhibits the effect of SHP-1 on TonEBP/OREBP by increasing 
phosphorylation of SHP-1 on Ser591, which reduces its phosphatase activity and 
localization to the nucleus. Thus, TonEBP/OREBP is extensively regulated by 
phosphatases, including SHP-1, whose inhibition by high NaCl increases 
phosphorylation of TonEBP/OREBP at Y143, contributing to the nuclear 
localization and activation of TonEBP/OREBP.
