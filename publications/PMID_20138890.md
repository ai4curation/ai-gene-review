Based on sequence and phylogenetic analyses, glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 3 
can be divided into several clusters that differ in the length of their primary 
sequences. However, structural data on representatives of GH3 are still scarce, 
since only three of their structures are known and only one of them has been 
thoroughly characterized-that of an exohydrolase from barley. To allow a deeper 
structural understanding of the GH3 family, we have determined the crystal 
structure of the thermostable beta-glucosidase from Thermotoga neapolitana, 
which has potentially important applications in environmentally friendly 
industrial biosynthesis at a resolution of 2.05 A. Selected active-site mutants 
have been characterized kinetically, and the structure of the mutant D242A is 
presented at 2.1 A resolution. Bgl3B from Th. neapolitana is the first example 
of a GH3 glucosidase with a three-domain structure. It is composed of an 
(alpha/beta)(8) domain similar to a triose phosphate isomerase barrel, a 
five-stranded alpha/beta sandwich domain (both of which are important for 
active-site organization), and a C-terminal fibronectin type III domain of 
unknown function. Remarkably, the direction of the second beta-strand of the 
triose phosphate isomerase barrel domain is reversed, which has implications for 
the active-site shape. The active site, at the interface of domains 1 and 2, is 
much more open to solvent than the corresponding site in the structurally 
homologous enzyme from barley, and only the -1 site is well defined. The 
structures, in combination with kinetic studies of active-site variants, allow 
the identification of essential catalytic residues (the nucleophile D242 and the 
acid/base E458), as well as other residues at the -1 subsite, including D58 and 
W243, which, by mutagenesis, are shown to be important for substrate 
accommodation/interaction. The position of the fibronectin type III domain 
excludes a direct participation of this domain in the recognition of small 
substrates, although it may be involved in the anchoring of the enzyme on large 
polymeric substrates and in thermostability.
