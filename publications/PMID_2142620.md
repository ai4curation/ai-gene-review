The S. cerevisiae CLN genes encode cyclin homologs essential for progression 
from G1 to S phase. The CLN2 gene encodes a 62 kd polypeptide that accumulates 
periodically, peaking during G1 and decreasing rapidly thereafter, and is 
rapidly lost following exposure of cells to mating pheromone. Cln2 abundance can 
be explained by the G1-specific accumulation of the CLN2 transcript coupled with 
instability of the Cln2 protein. The abundance of the CLN1 and CLN2 transcripts 
increases greater than 5-fold during the G1 interval, decreasing dramatically as 
cells enter S phase. Both transcripts decrease in cells responding to mating 
pheromone. Finally, we demonstrate that the Cln2 polypeptide interacts with 
p34CDC28 to form an active protein kinase complex. This physical interaction is 
consistent with the genetic interaction between the CLN genes and CDC28 and 
suggests that Cln proteins are an essential component of the active protein 
kinase complex required for the G1 to S transition.
