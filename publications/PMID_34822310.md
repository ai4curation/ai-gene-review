Recognition of the intron branch site (BS) by the U2 small nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) is a critical event during spliceosome assembly. In 
mammals, BS sequences are poorly conserved, and unambiguous intron recognition 
cannot be achieved solely through a base-pairing mechanism. We isolated human 
17S U2 snRNP and reconstituted in vitro its adenosine 5´-triphosphate 
(ATP)–dependent remodeling and binding to the pre–messenger RNA substrate. We 
determined a series of high-resolution (2.0 to 2.2 angstrom) structures 
providing snapshots of the BS selection process. The substrate-bound U2 snRNP 
shows that SF3B6 stabilizes the BS:U2 snRNA duplex, which could aid binding of 
introns with poor sequence complementarity. ATP-dependent remodeling uncoupled 
from substrate binding captures U2 snRNA in a conformation that competes with BS 
recognition, providing a selection mechanism based on branch helix stability.
