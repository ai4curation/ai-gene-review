Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is a crucial 
signaling transducer that regulates a diverse array of physiological processes, 
including adaptive immunity, innate immunity, and bone metabolism. Importantly, 
it is essential for activating NF-kappaB signaling pathway in response to 
interleukin-1 and Toll-like receptor ligands. Previously, we characterized TRAF6 
to be a ubiquitin ligase. In combination with the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 
complex Ubc13/Uev1A, TRAF6 could catalyze the formation on itself of unique 
Lys-63 linked polyubiquitin chain that positively regulated NF-kappaB signaling 
pathway. However, it remains unknown how this auto-ubiquitination process is 
regulated. In this study, we found that the coiled-coil domain of TRAF6 was 
essential for its auto-ubiquitination and activating NF-kappaB signaling 
pathway. This domain served not as the specific target where the polyubiquitin 
chain was linked, but as a specific bridge to recruit Ubc13/Uev1A.
