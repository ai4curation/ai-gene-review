We have identified two new genes, neuroD2 and neuroD3, on the basis of their 
similarity to the neurogenic basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) gene neuroD. The 
predicted amino acid sequence of neuroD2 shows a high degree of homology to 
neuroD and MATH-2/NEX-1 in the bHLH region, whereas neuroD3 is a more distantly 
related family member. neuroD3 is expressed transiently during embryonic 
development, with the highest levels of expression between days 10 and 12. 
neuroD2 is initially expressed at embryonic day 11, with persistent expression 
in the adult nervous system. In situ and Northern (RNA) analyses demonstrate 
that different regions of the adult nervous system have different relative 
amounts of neuroD and neuroD2 RNA. Similar to neuroD, expression of neuroD2 in 
developing Xenopus laevis embryos results in ectopic neurogenesis, indicating 
that neuroD2 mediates neuronal differentiation. Transfection of vectors 
expressing neuroD and neuroD2 into P19 cells shows that both can activate 
expression through simple E-box-driven reporter constructs and can activate a 
reporter driven by the neuroD2 promoter region, but the GAP-43 promoter is 
preferentially activated by neuroD2. The noncongruent expression pattern and 
target gene specificity of these highly related neurogenic bHLH proteins make 
them candidates for conferring specific aspects of the neuronal phenotype.
