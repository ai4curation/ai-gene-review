Cancer chemotherapy inhibits tumor growth, in part, by triggering apoptosis, and 
anti-apoptotic proteins reduce the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Clusterin, a 
chaperone-like protein that binds to apoptotic and DNA repair proteins, is 
induced by chemotherapy and promotes tumor cell survival. Histone deacetylase 
inhibitors (HDIs) such as sodium butyrate and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid 
(SAHA) are pharmacological agents that induce differentiation and apoptosis in 
cancer cells by altering chromatin structure, and we have found that 
combinations of chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin and HDIs efficiently 
induce apoptosis, even though they paradoxically induce high levels of 
clusterin. The hyper-expressed form of clusterin localizes to mitochondria, 
inhibits cytochrome c release, and is inhibited by the proteasome. When HDIs are 
used as single agents, clusterin suppresses cytochrome c release and apoptosis. 
However, doxorubicin/HDI-induced apoptosis is not inhibited by clusterin, and 
clusterin-resistant apoptosis corresponds with markers of the 
extrinsic/receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway. Thus, chemotherapy-HDI 
combinations are capable of overcoming an innate anti-apoptotic pathway of tumor 
cells, suggesting that chemotherapy-HDI combinations have potential for treating 
advanced stage breast cancer.
