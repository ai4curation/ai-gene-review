FoxO transcription factors regulate the transcription of genes that control 
metabolism, cellular proliferation, stress tolerance, and possibly life span. A 
number of posttranslational modifications within the forkhead DNA-binding domain 
regulate FoxO-mediated transcription. We describe the crystal structures of 
FoxO1 bound to three different DNA elements and measure the change in FoxO1-DNA 
affinity with acetylation and phosphorylation. The structures reveal additional 
contacts and increased DNA distortion for the highest affinity DNA site. The 
flexible wing 2 region of the forkhead domain was not observed in the structures 
but is necessary for DNA binding, and we show that p300 acetylation in wing 2 
reduces DNA affinity. We also show that MST1 phosphorylation of FoxO1 prevents 
high-affinity DNA binding. The observation that FoxO-DNA affinity varies between 
response elements and with posttranslational modifications suggests that 
modulation of FoxO-DNA affinity is an important component of FoxO regulation in 
health and misregulation in disease.
