CD28 has a crucial role in regulating immune responses by enhancing T cell 
activation and differentiation. Recent studies have shown that the transmembrane 
helix (TMH) of CD28 mediates receptor assembly and activity, but a structural 
characterization of TMH is still lacking. Here, we determined the dimeric 
helix-helix packing of CD28-TMH using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
technology. Unexpectedly, wild-type CD28-TMH alone forms stable tetramers in 
lipid bicelles instead of dimers. The NMR structure of the CD28-TMH C165F mutant 
reveals that a GxxxA motif, which is highly conserved in many dimeric 
assemblies, is located at the dimerization interface. Mutating G160 and A164 can 
disrupt the transmembrane helix assembly and reduces CD28 enhancement in cells. 
In contrast, a previously proposed YxxxxT motif does not affect the dimerization 
of full-length CD28, but it does affect CD28 activity. These results imply that 
the transmembrane domain of CD28 regulates the signaling transduction in a 
complicated manner.
