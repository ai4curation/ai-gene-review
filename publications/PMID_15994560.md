Cell signaling that culminates in posttranslational modifications directs 
protein activity. Here we report how multiple Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation 
sites within the transcription activator Ets-1 act additively to produce graded 
DNA binding affinity. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analyses show 
that phosphorylation shifts Ets-1 from a dynamic conformation poised to bind DNA 
to a well-folded inhibited state. These phosphates lie in an unstructured 
flexible region that functions as the allosteric effector of autoinhibition. 
Variable phosphorylation thus serves as a "rheostat" for cell signaling to 
fine-tune transcription at the level of DNA binding.
