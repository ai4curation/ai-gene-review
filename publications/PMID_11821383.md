Caspase-associated recruitment domains (CARD) are protein-protein interaction 
modules found extensively in proteins that play important roles in apoptosis, 
NFkappaB activation, and cytokine regulation. In this study we identified a 
novel human protein, CARD-8, which contains a C-terminal CARD domain with high 
similarity to the CARD domain of caspase-1/ICE. We demonstrate that CARD-8 
interacts physically with caspase-1 and negatively regulates caspase-1-dependent 
IL-1beta generation in the THP-1 monocytic cell line. CARD-8 binds also to 
ICEBERG and pseudo-ICE, two other recently identified proteins, which bind to 
the CARD domain of caspase-1 and negatively regulate its activity. Reverse 
transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed that CARD-8 is expressed mainly in 
monocytes, placenta, lymph nodes, and spleen. This pattern of expression is 
consistent with caspase-1 expression in the same cells and tissues. CARD-8 was 
also found to negatively regulate NF-kappaB activation by TNF-alpha stimulation 
and by ectopically expressed RICK, suggesting that this protein may control cell 
survival. Consistent with these results, stable expression of CARD-8 in U937 or 
THP-1 cells sensitizes the cells to differentiation-induced apoptosis. 
Overexpression of CARD-8 can also induce apoptosis in transfected cells. The 
results suggest that CARD-8 represents a new signaling molecule involved in the 
regulation of caspase-1 and NF-kappaB activation.
