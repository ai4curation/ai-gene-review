A novel, large-scale method for the purification of cytochrome-c oxidase from 
the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is described. The isolation procedure gave 
highly pure and active enzyme at high yields. The purified enzyme exhibited a 
heme a/protein ratio of 9.1 mmol/mg and revealed twelve protein bands after 
Tricine/SDS/PAGE. N-terminal sequencing showed that eleven of the corresponding 
proteins were identical to those recently described by Taanman and Capaldi 
[Taanman, J.-W. & Capaldi, R.A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 22,481-22,485]. 15 of 
the N-terminal residues of the 12th band were identical to subunit VIII 
indicating that this band represents a dimer of subunit VIII (M(r) 5364). We 
conclude that subunit XII postulated by Taanman and Capaldi is the subunit VIII 
dimer and that cytochrome-c oxidase contains eleven rather than twelve subunits. 
We obtained the complete sequence of subunit VIa by Edman degradation. The 
protein contains more than 25% of charged amino acids and hydropathy analysis 
predicts one membrane-spanning helix. The purified enzyme had a turnover number 
of 1500 s-1 and the ionic-strength dependence of the Km value for cytochrome-c 
was similar to that described for other preparations of cytochrome-c oxidase. 
This was also true for the cyanide-binding characteristics of the preparation. 
When the enzyme was isolated in the presence of chloride, more than 90% of the 
preparation showed fast cyanide-binding kinetics and was resistant to formate 
incubation, indicating that chloride was bound to the binuclear center. When the 
enzyme was isolated in the absence of chloride, approximately 70% of the 
preparation was in the fast form. This high content of fast enzyme was also 
reflected in the characteristics of optical and EPR spectra for cytochrome-c 
oxidase purified with our method.
