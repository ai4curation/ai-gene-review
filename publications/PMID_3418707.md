We have isolated clones of human genomic DNA which contain the structural 
elements of the hTMnm gene. In non-muscle tissue this gene produces a 2.5 kb (1 
kb = 10(3) bases or base-pairs) mRNA encoding TM30nm, a 248 amino acid 
cytoskeletal tropomyosin. In muscle, alternative splicing of this gene results 
in the expression of a 1.3 kb mRNA encoding a 285 amino acid skeletal muscle 
alpha-tropomyosin. The hTMnm gene spans at least 42 kb of DNA and consists of 13 
exons, only five of which are common to both the 2.5 kb and 1.3 kb transcripts. 
The boundaries of the exons giving rise to the muscle-specific isoform are 
identical to the base to those of other genes encoding muscle tropomyosins. A 
comparison of the structures of exons encoding the amino-terminal sequences of 
the muscle and non-muscle isoforms suggests that the hTMnm gene has evolved by a 
specific pattern of exon duplication with alternative splicing.
