The first identified Gadd45 gene, Gadd45a, encodes a ubiquitously expressed 
protein that is often induced by DNA damage and other stress signals associated 
with growth arrest and apoptosis. This protein and the other two members of this 
small gene family, Gadd45b and Gadd45g, have been implicated in a variety of the 
responses to cell injury including cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, and DNA 
repair. In vivo, many of the prominent roles for the Gadd45 proteins are 
associated with signaling mediated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases 
(MAPK). Gadd45 proteins can contribute to p38 activation either by activation of 
upstream kinase(s) or by direct interaction. In vivo, there are important tissue 
and cell-type-specific differences in the roles for Gadd45 in MAPK signaling. In 
addition to being p53-regulated, Gadd45a has been found to contribute to p53 
activation via p38. Like other stress and signaling proteins, Gadd45 proteins 
show complex regulation and numerous effectors.
