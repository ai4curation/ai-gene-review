Mutations in a new gene, secB, cause defective protein localization in 
Escherichia coli.

Kumamoto CA, Beckwith J.

We isolated a new class of Escherichia coli mutants with pleiotropic defects in 
protein secretion. Using a previously described selection procedure (Oliver et 
al., Ann. Microbiol. [Paris] 133A:105-110, 1982), we obtained a large collection 
of strains containing mutations that affect protein localization. In many cases, 
the lesions causing the secretion defects were mapped in or near the previously 
identified gene, secA (Oliver and Beckwith, Cell 25:765-772, 1981). However, the 
selection also yielded mutants with mutations in a new locus, which was 
designated secB. These secB mutants were defective in the localization of 
maltose-binding protein and, in at least one case, OmpF protein. Double mutants 
with lesions in both secA and secB had strong defects in the secretion of 
maltose-binding protein and OmpF protein. The secB locus mapped near cysE at min 
80.5 on the E. coli genetic map. The properties of secB mutants suggest that the 
secB product could be a component of the E. coli secretory apparatus.
