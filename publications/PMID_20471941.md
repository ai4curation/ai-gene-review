Eukaryotic cell proliferation is controlled by growth factors and essential 
nutrients, in the absence of which cells may enter into a quiescent (G(0)) 
state. In yeast, nitrogen and/or carbon limitation causes downregulation of the 
conserved TORC1 and PKA signaling pathways and, consequently, activation of the 
PAS kinase Rim15, which orchestrates G(0) program initiation and ensures proper 
life span by controlling distal readouts, including the expression of specific 
genes. Here, we report that Rim15 coordinates transcription with 
posttranscriptional mRNA protection by phosphorylating the paralogous Igo1 and 
Igo2 proteins. This event, which stimulates Igo proteins to associate with the 
mRNA decapping activator Dhh1, shelters newly expressed mRNAs from degradation 
via the 5'-3' mRNA decay pathway, thereby enabling their proper translation 
during initiation of the G(0) program. These results delineate a likely 
conserved mechanism by which nutrient limitation leads to stabilization of 
specific mRNAs that are critical for cell differentiation and life span.
