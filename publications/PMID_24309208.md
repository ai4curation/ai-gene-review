Broad dermal Wnt signaling is required for patterned induction of hair follicle 
placodes and subsequent Wnt signaling in placode stem cells is essential for 
induction of dermal condensates, cell clusters of precursors for the hair 
follicle dermal papilla (DP). Progression of hair follicle formation then 
requires coordinated signal exchange between dermal condensates and placode stem 
cells. However, it remains unknown whether continued Wnt signaling in DP 
precursor cells plays a role in this process, largely due to the long-standing 
inability to specifically target dermal condensates for gene ablation. Here we 
use the Tbx18(Cre) knockin mouse line to ablate the Wnt-responsive transcription 
factor β-catenin specifically in these cells at E14.5 during the first wave of 
guard hair follicle formation. In the absence of β-catenin, canonical Wnt 
signaling is effectively abolished in these cells. Sox2(+) dermal condensates 
initiate normally; however by E16.5 guard hair follicle numbers are strongly 
reduced and by E18.5 most whiskers and guard hair follicles are absent, 
suggesting that active Wnt signaling in dermal condensates is important for hair 
follicle formation to proceed after induction. To explore the molecular 
mechanisms by which Wnt signaling in dermal condensates regulates hair follicle 
formation, we analyze genome-wide the gene expression changes in embryonic 
β-catenin null DP precursor cells. We find altered expression of several 
signaling pathway genes, including Fgfs and Activin, both previously implicated 
in hair follicle formation. In summary, these data reveal a functional role of 
Wnt signaling in DP precursors for embryonic hair follicle formation and 
identify Fgf and Activin signaling as potential effectors of Wnt 
signaling-regulated events.

INTRODUCTION

During embryonic development stem cells give rise to a multitude of complex organs and tissues. To accomplish this, stem cells undergo multiple fate decisions that strike a balance between self-renewal and differentiation into all cell lineages that make up each tissue ( Fuchs and Chen, 2013 ; Li and Clevers, 2010 ). These cell fate choices are thought to be highly regulated by the microenvironment, or stem cell niche ( Moore and Lemischka, 2006 ; Voog and Jones, 2010 ; Xie and Li, 2007 ). Niche influences can include neuronal and humoral inputs, structural aspects and extracellular matrix composition, and typically also involve cell-cell communication and paracrine signal exchange of niche cells with neighboring stem cells ( Jones and Wagers, 2008 ; Scadden, 2006 ). Stem cell niches have been described in several tissues ( Jahoda and Christiano, 2011 ; Simons and Clevers, 2011 ; Wang and Wagers, 2011 ). In skin, dermal papilla (DP) cells are thought to instruct matrix progenitors during hair growth and bulge stem cells during adult hair regeneration in the hair cycle (reviewed in Lee and Tumbar, 2012 ; Sennett and Rendl, 2012 ), but the precise molecular mechanisms of DP niche function remain elusive. Likewise, during embryonic hair follicle formation the precursors of DP cells in dermal condensates ( Grisanti et al., 2013a ) are thought to instruct epidermal placode cells that contain the future hair follicle stem cells ( Lee and Tumbar, 2012 ; Sennett and Rendl, 2012 )

During embryonic hair follicle induction, unknown dermal signals downstream of broad dermal Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity are thought to induce epidermal stem cells to switch to a hair placode fate ( Chen et al., 2012 ). Nascent epithelial hair placodes signal back to induce dermal condensates that are clustering DP precursor cells. Fgf20 was recently identified as a crucial placode signal ( Huh et al., 2013 ). For hair follicle formation to proceed, continued signal exchange between the two compartments initiates proliferation and downgrowth, with DP precursor cells at the leading edge ( Schmidt-Ullrich and Paus, 2005 ; Schneider et al., 2009 ) and hair follicle stem cells set aside at the upper portion of developing follicles ( Nowak et al., 2008 ). At the lower tip of new follicles, stem cell progeny engulf DP cells before starting to proliferate and migrate upwards while differentiating into outgrowing visible hair shafts. In mouse back skin, hair development occurs in three consecutive waves giving rise to four hair follicle types ( Schlake, 2007 ; Sennett and Rendl, 2012 ) ( Fig. 1A ). The 1 st wave starts around embryonic day (E)14.5 forming primary guard hair follicles that represent ~1–3% of the complete hair coat. The 2 nd wave that forms awl/auchene hairs starts at E16.5 (~20%). Finally, the 3 rd wave at E18.5 generates zigzag hairs, which comprise the majority (80%) of the down undercoat ( Schneider et al., 2009 ; Sennett and Rendl, 2012 ). Besides Fgf and Wnt/β-catenin signaling (more details below), Shh, Tgf/Bmp and Eda/Edar/NFkB signaling pathways play an important role in the earliest steps of hair follicle morphogenesis ( Botchkarev et al., 1999 ; Headon and Overbeek, 1999 ; St-Jacques et al., 1998 ; Woo et al., 2012 ; Zhang et al., 2009 ).

Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the hair placode is essential for hair follicle formation ( Alonso and Fuchs, 2003 ). Transgenic mice expressing stabilized β-catenin in the epidermis form excessive hair follicles ( Gat et al., 1998 ), with premature and expanded placode development ( Zhang et al., 2008 ). By contrast, epidermis-specific genetic ablation of β-catenin results in a failure of hair follicle initiation ( Huelsken et al., 2001 ). Similarly, epidermis-specific ectopic expression of Dkk1, a competitive Wnt inhibitor, results in a failure to form hair follicles ( Andl et al., 2002 ). Recent evidence suggests that active Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the dermis plays an important role for hair follicle induction even prior to placode Wnt signaling activity. Several Wnt reporter mice show broad dermal Wnt/β-catenin signaling at E13.5 ( Chen et al., 2012 ; Zhang et al., 2009 ) that is dependent on epidermal Wnt ligand secretion ( Chen et al., 2012 ). Importantly, this broad dermal Wnt/β-catenin activity is required for hair placode induction by as of yet unidentified downstream target signals ( Chen et al., 2012 ). After placode induction, dermal Wnt/β-catenin activity becomes more focused in DP precursor cells of dermal condensates at E14.5 ( Chen et al., 2012 ; DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999 ; Zhang et al., 2009 ), as nuclear Wnt pathway transcription factors Lef1 and β-catenin are also detected in these cells ( DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999 ; Zhang et al., 2009 ; Zhou et al., 1995 ). However, the role of Wnt signaling in directing dermal condensates to interact with placode cells during the progression of hair follicle formation is still unexplored, due to the long-standing lack of DP precursor-specific genetic drivers for gene ablation experiments. Here we utilize our recently characterized Tbx18 Cre knockin mouse line ( Clavel et al., 2012 ; Grisanti et al., 2013a ; Grisanti et al., 2013b ) to express Cre recombinase specifically in embryonic DP precursor cells and ablate the Wnt-responsive transcription factor β-catenin. We report that without β-catenin, whisker and backskin 1 st wave guard hair follicles fail to form. Molecular exploration suggests the involvement of Fgf and Activin signaling pathways as potential effectors of Wnt signaling within the DP niche cells. This study reveals that Wnt signaling is required specifically for dermal condensate and early DP niche function during hair follicle morphogenesis, mirroring the known essential role of Wnt signaling within hair follicle stem cells.

DISCUSSION

After initial hair follicle induction in embryonic skin, the progression of hair follicle formation relies on dynamic interactions between placode cells and the specialized DP precursor cells in dermal condensates. Although multiple signaling pathways have been implicated for several years (reviewed in Lee and Tumbar, 2012 ; Schneider et al., 2009 ; Sennett and Rendl, 2012 ), the precise mechanisms behind this crosstalk remain unclear. Numerous studies firmly established an essential role of canonical Wnt signaling within the broad dermis and in placode cells for hair follicle induction; however, the significance of Wnt signaling in dermal condensates in their interaction with placode cells for progression of hair follicle formation remained unresolved. Our present study utilizes the Tbx18 Cre mouse model to specifically ablate β-catenin in DP precursor cells at E14.5, thus abrogating canonical Wnt signaling in the dermal niche compartment at the earliest stages of hair follicle development. The results from this work demonstrate that Wnt signaling within the dermal compartment is required for morphogenesis of 1 st wave guard hair follicles, in addition to implementing precise technology that allows genetic targeting of the dermal niche during hair development.

Studies of Wnt signaling in early embryonic skin have previously revealed widespread activation of Wnt signaling in E10.5–13.5 dermis ( Chen et al., 2012 ; Zhang et al., 2009 ) and more focused activity in dermal condensates at E14.5 ( Chen et al., 2012 ; Zhang et al., 2009 ). To examine the patterns of Wnt signaling in relation to the development of all hair follicle types, we quantitatively assessed BATGAL Wnt reporter activity in both epidermis and dermis of newly forming follicles from E14.5 onwards. Histological examination of embryo back skins conclusively demonstrates that Wnt signaling is active in both compartments during the earliest stages of placode-condensate crosstalk at all three waves of hair morphogenesis. Interestingly, although many nascent follicles display positive LacZ staining in both placode cells and the DP niche, follicles with only one labeled compartment can also be observed, indicating dynamic Wnt activation during hair morphogenesis.

Targeted β-catenin ablation at E14.5 compromised Wnt signaling in dermal condensate cells and severely impaired hair follicle formation, thus emphasizing the requirement for functional Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the dermal niche during the 1 st wave of hair morphogenesis. Based on hair follicle type counts from P10 backskin, 2 nd wave auchene hair formation appeared to be compromised as well. At first it was surprising to observe 2 nd wave awl and 3 rd wave zigzag hair follicles forming normally in knockout embryos, but further analysis in a BATGAL reporter background revealed Wnt signaling was not completely abrogated in these corresponding dermal condensates during the earliest formation of these hair types. Therefore we cannot evaluate the requirement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in these hair types at that stage. However, signaling activity was missing in the DPs of 2 nd and 3 rd wave follicles in P5 cKO pups, resulting in postnatal hair shaft phenotypes consistent with previous studies exploring the role of Wnt/β-catenin in the DP niche during postnatal hair growth ( Enshell-Seijffers et al., 2010 ).

The significant reduction in 1 st wave guard hair formation following dermal condensate β-catenin ablation is the most striking finding in our cKO embryos. Importantly, the mouse genetic tools we use allow us to target the dermal condensate at a specific stage during hair morphogenesis, so we can exactly address the role of Wnt signaling in early hair follicle formation. Recent studies examining the role of Wnt signaling in back skin and hair development used widely-acting genetic tools to ablate β-catenin broadly throughout the dermis at an earlier embryonic time point, before hair follicles were initiated, and subsequently blocked all stages of hair morphogenesis. Our tools address the importance of Wnt signaling in DP niche precursor cells in a more specific place and time to definitively establish the crucial role of this molecular pathway in promoting early hair formation once placode and condensate have already appeared.

To better understand how Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the DP niche drives hair morphogenesis, we used genome-wide analysis to compare gene expression differences between wild-type and knockout dermal condensate cells. The results from this study identify Fgf and Activin signaling as putative downstream targets of Wnt signaling in the mesenchyme, as expression of factors from both pathways are decreased in cKO condensate cells. Several studies have highlighted the crucial role of Fgf signaling in hair follicle development, including Fgf10 knockout mice that fail to grow whiskers ( Ohuchi et al., 2003 ) and FGFR2 null mice that similarly display deficient hair growth ( De Moerlooze et al., 2000 ; Petiot et al., 2003 ). In this study, Fgf10 expression is diminished in β-catenin depleted condensate cells, suggesting that the intersection of Fgf and Wnt signaling could be important for mediating the instructive effects of condensate niche cells during early hair morphogenesis. Future studies will be necessary to determine the extent and dynamic nature of this interaction.

This study additionally identifies decreased Inhba expression in β-catenin depleted condensate cells. Inhba forms dimeric complexes, also known as Activin A, previously implicated in tooth and hair follicle morphogenesis ( Ferguson et al., 1998 ; McDowall et al., 2008 ). These morphogens from the TGF-β family appear to modulate hair follicle formation, which has been demonstrated by the generation of Activin knockout mice that lack whiskers at birth ( Matzuk et al., 1995b ). Interestingly, when the Activin receptor type IB is knocked out specifically in the epidermis, mice display a hair loss phenotype that worsens with age ( Qiu et al., 2011 ), suggesting that DP Activin signaling to a receptive epidermis might be an important component of the epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk that drives hair maintenance. Although the Activin signaling pathway has clearly been linked to hair follicle formation and maintenance, the detailed molecular mechanisms behind its action have yet to be deciphered.

While this study emphasizes the requirement for Wnt signaling in the dermal niche during hair follicle morphogenesis by specifically ablating β-catenin in dermal condensate cells during early hair formation, the interconnections between Wnt activation and the concurrent or sequential activation of other major signaling pathways remain to be explored. Mechanistically, this study provides further evidence that the modulation of multiple major signaling pathways in dermal-epidermal crosstalk is crucial for driving hair morphogenesis during embryonic skin development.
