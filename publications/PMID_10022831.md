Interaction between integrin alphavbeta3 and extracellular matrix is crucial for 
endothelial cells sprouting from capillaries and for angiogenesis. Furthermore, 
integrin-mediated outside-in signals co-operate with growth factor receptors to 
promote cell proliferation and motility. To determine a potential regulation of 
angiogenic inducer receptors by the integrin system, we investigated the 
interaction between alphavbeta3 integrin and tyrosine kinase vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) in human endothelial cells. We 
report that tyrosine-phosphorylated VEGFR-2 co-immunoprecipitated with beta3 
integrin subunit, but not with beta1 or beta5, from cells stimulated with 
VEGF-A165. VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and mitogenicity induced by VEGF-A165 were 
enhanced in cells plated on the alphavbeta3 ligand, vitronectin, compared with 
cells plated on the alpha5beta1 ligand, fibronectin or the alpha2beta1 ligand, 
collagen. BV4 anti-beta3 integrin mAb, which does not interfere with endothelial 
cell adhesion to vitronectin, reduced (i) the tyrosine phosphorylation of 
VEGFR-2; (ii) the activation of downstream transductor phosphoinositide 3-OH 
kinase; and (iii) biological effects triggered by VEGF-A165. These results 
indicate a new role for alphavbeta3 integrin in the activation of an in vitro 
angiogenic program in endothelial cells. Besides being the most important 
survival system for nascent vessels by regulating cell adhesion to matrix, 
alphavbeta3 integrin participates in the full activation of VEGFR-2 triggered by 
VEGF-A, which is an important angiogenic inducer in tumors, inflammation and 
tissue regeneration.
