Keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) form a fibrous polymer network that helps 
epithelial cells withstand external mechanical forces. Recently, we established 
a correlation between the structure of the KIF network and its local mechanical 
properties in alveolar epithelial cells. Shear stress applied across the cell 
surface resulted in the structural remodeling of KIF and a substantial increase 
in the elastic modulus of the network. This study examines the mechanosignaling 
that regulates the structural remodeling of the KIF network. We report that the 
shear stress-mediated remodeling of the KIF network is facilitated by a twofold 
increase in the dynamic exchange rate of KIF subunits, which is regulated in a 
PKC zeta and 14-3-3-dependent manner. PKC zeta phosphorylates K18pSer33, and 
this is required for the structural reorganization because the KIF network in 
A549 cells transfected with a dominant negative PKC zeta, or expressing the 
K18Ser33Ala mutation, is unchanged. Blocking the shear stress-mediated 
reorganization results in reduced cellular viability and increased apoptotic 
levels. These data suggest that shear stress mediates the phosphorylation of 
K18pSer33, which is required for the reorganization of the KIF network, 
resulting in changes in mechanical properties of the cell that help maintain the 
integrity of alveolar epithelial cells.
