Mdj1p, a DnaJ homolog in the mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is 
involved in the folding of proteins in the mitochondrial matrix. In this 
capacity, Mdj1p cooperates with mitochondrial Hsp70 (mt-Hsp70). Here, we 
analyzed the role of Mdj1p as a chaperone for newly synthesized proteins encoded 
by mitochondrial DNA and for nucleus-encoded proteins as they enter the 
mitochondrial matrix. A series of conditional mutants of mdj1 was constructed. 
Mutations in the various functional domains led to a partial loss of Mdj1p 
function. The mutant Mdj1 proteins were defective in protecting the tester 
protein firefly luciferase against heat-induced aggregation in isolated 
mitochondria. The mitochondrially encoded var1 protein showed enhanced 
aggregation after synthesis in mdj1 mutant mitochondria. Mdj1p and mt-Hsp70 were 
found in a complex with nascent polypeptide chains on mitochondrial ribosomes. 
Mdj1p was not found to interact with translocation intermediates of imported 
proteins spanning the two membranes and exposing short segments into the matrix, 
in accordance with the lack of requirement of Mdj1p in the mt-Hsp70-mediated 
protein import into mitochondria. On the other hand, precursor proteins in 
transit which had further entered the matrix were found in a complex with Mdj1p. 
Our results suggest that Mdj1p together with mt-Hsp70 plays an important role as 
a chaperone for mitochondrially synthesized polypeptide chains emerging from the 
ribosome and for translocating proteins at a late import step.
