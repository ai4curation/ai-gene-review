Lysosomes are degradation and signalling centres crucial for homeostasis, 
development and ageing1. To meet diverse cellular demands, lysosomes remodel 
their morphology and function through constant fusion and fission2,3. Little is 
known about the molecular basis of fission. Here we identify HPO-27, a conserved 
HEAT repeat protein, as a lysosome scission factor in Caenorhabditis elegans. 
Loss of HPO-27 impairs lysosome fission and leads to an excessive tubular 
network that ultimately collapses. HPO-27 and its human homologue MROH1 are 
recruited to lysosomes by RAB-7 and enriched at scission sites. Super-resolution 
imaging, negative-staining electron microscopy and in vitro reconstitution 
assays reveal that HPO-27 and MROH1 self-assemble to mediate the constriction 
and scission of lysosomal tubules in worms and mammalian cells, respectively, 
and assemble to sever supported membrane tubes in vitro. Loss of HPO-27 affects 
lysosomal morphology, integrity and degradation activity, which impairs animal 
development and longevity. Thus, HPO-27 and MROH1 act as self-assembling 
scission factors to maintain lysosomal homeostasis and function.
