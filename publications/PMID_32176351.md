Brassinosteroids (BRs) are known to improve salt tolerance of plants, but not in 
all situations. Here, we show that a certain concentration of 24-epibrassinolide 
(EBL), an active BR, can promote the tolerance of canola under high-salt stress, 
but the same concentration is disadvantageous under low-salt stress. We define 
this phenomenon as hormonal stress-level-dependent biphasic (SLDB) effects. The 
SLDB effects of EBL on salt tolerance in canola are closely related to H2 O2 
accumulation, which is regulated by polyamine metabolism, especially putrescine 
(Put) oxidation. The inhibition of EBL on canola under low-salt stress can be 
ameliorated by repressing Put biosynthesis or diamine oxidase activity to reduce 
H2 O2 production. Genetic and phenotypic results of bri1-9, bak1, bes1-D, and 
bzr1-1D mutants and overexpression lines of BRI1 and BAK1 in Arabidopsis 
indicate that a proper enhancement of BR signaling benefits plants in countering 
salt stress, whereas excessive enhancement is just as harmful as a deficiency. 
These results highlight the involvement of crosstalk between BR signaling and 
Put metabolism in H2 O2 accumulation, which underlies the dual role of BR in 
plant salt tolerance.
