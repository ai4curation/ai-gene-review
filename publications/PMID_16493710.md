We have developed a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based protein microarray to 
study protein-protein interactions in a high-throughput mode. As a model system, 
triple protein interactions have been explored with human papillomaviral E6 
protein, tumor suppressor p53, and ubiquitin ligase E6AP. Human papillomavirus 
(HPV) is known to be a causative agent of cervical cancer. Upon infection, the 
viral E6 protein forms a heterotrimeric protein complex with p53 and E6AP. The 
formation of the complex eventually results in the degradation of p53. In the 
present study, a GST-fused E6AP protein was layered onto a glutathione 
(GSH)-modified gold chip surface. The specific binding of GST-E6AP protein onto 
the gold chip surface was facilitated through the affinity of GST to its 
specific ligand GSH. The interacting proteins (E6 and/or p53) were then spotted. 
Detection of the interaction was performed using a SPR imaging (SPRI) technique. 
The resulting SPRI intensity data showed that the protein-protein interactions 
of E6AP, E6, and p53 were detected in a concentration-dependent manner, 
suggesting that the SPRI-based microarray system can be an effective tool to 
study protein-protein interactions where multiple proteins are involved.
