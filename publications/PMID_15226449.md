The antiapoptotic function of the interleukin-7 (IL-7) receptor is related to 
regulation of three members of the Bcl2 family: synthesis of Bcl2, 
phosphorylation of Bad, and cytosolic retention of Bax. Here we show that, in an 
IL-7-dependent murine T-cell line, different regions of the IL-7 receptor 
initiate the signal transduction pathways that regulate these proteins. Both 
Box1 and Y449 are required to signal Bcl2 synthesis and Bax cytosolic retention. 
This suggests a sequential model in which Jak1, which binds to Box1, is first 
activated and then phosphorylates Y449, leading to Bcl2 and Bax regulation, 
accounting for approximately 90% of the survival function. Phosphorylation of 
Bad required Box1 but not Y449, suggesting that Jak1 also initiates an 
additional signaling cascade that accounts for approximately 10% of the survival 
function. Stat5 was activated from the Y449 site but only partially accounted 
for the survival signal. Proliferation required both Y449 and Box1. Thymocyte 
development in vivo showed that deletion of Y449 eliminated 90% of alphabeta 
T-cell development and completely eliminated gammadelta T-cell development, 
whereas deleting Box 1 completely eliminated both alphabeta and gammadelta 
T-cell development. Thus the IL-7 receptor controls at least two distinct 
pathways, in addition to Stat5, that are required for cell survival.

Stat5 was activated from the Y449 site but only partially accounted for the survival signal. Proliferation required both Y449 and Box1. Thymocyte development in vivo showed that deletion of Y449 eliminated 90% of αβ T-cell development and completely eliminated γδ T-cell development, whereas deleting Box 1 completely eliminated both αβ and γδ T-cell development. Thus the IL-7 receptor controls at least two distinct pathways, in addition to Stat5, that are required for cell survival.
