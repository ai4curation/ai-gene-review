Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) is a small serine/threonine kinase that 
displays close sequence homology to the mitotically active cyclin-dependent 
kinases. Cdk5 has been shown to play an essential role in the development of the 
nervous system, including neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth. Cdk5 
activation requires the presence of a regulatory activator such as p35. cdk5 -/- 
mice have much more extensive defects in the development of the nervous system 
than p35 -/- mice, leading to the speculation that other regulatory activators 
of cdk5 exist. Indeed, p39 is a p35 related protein isolated by sequence 
homology to p35. We show here that p39 associates with cdk5 in brain lysates, 
and that this complex is active in phosphorylation of histone H1. By extensive 
characterization of p39 subcellular localization in different cell types, we 
demonstrate the presence of p39 in lamellipodial and fillopodial structures of 
cells and in growth cones of neurons. We show that p39 colocalizes with actin, 
and cofractionates with the detergent insoluble cytoskeleton from brain. 
Further, p39 coimmunoprecipitates with actin in brain lysates. Finally, 
disruption of the actin cytoskeleton alters p39 subcellular localization as well 
as kinase activity of the p39/cdk5 complex. Therefore, our results reveal the 
existence of the p39/cdk5 complex in vivo and suggest that it might play a role 
in regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics in cells.
