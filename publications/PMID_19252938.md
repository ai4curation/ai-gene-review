Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are thought to be a driving force in the aging 
process. In transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans expressing green fluorescent 
protein (GFP) under control of the hsp-16.2 promoter (CL2070) 100 muM of the 
ROS-generator juglone induced GFP-expression. This was associated with 
translocation of DAF-16 to the nucleus as visualized in a transgenic strain 
expressing a DAF-16::GFP fusion protein (TJ356) and with increased cellular 
levels of reduced glutathione. RNA-interference for DAF-16 in CL2070 blocked the 
juglone-induced HSP-16.2 expression and the increase in glutathione levels. 
Higher concentrations of juglone did not further increase the adaptive responses 
but caused premature death, indicating hormetic adaptations unless the stressor 
exceeds the intrinsic protective capacity. The addition of the ROS-scavenger 
ascorbic acid finally blocked lifespan reductions and all of the adaptations to 
juglone stressing that ROS are indeed the molecular species that require 
protective response.
