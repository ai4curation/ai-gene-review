SLP-76 (Src homology (SH) 2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa) and 
FYB/SLAP (FYN-T-binding protein/SLP-76-associated protein) are two hemopoietic 
cell-specific adaptor proteins downstream of TCR-activated protein tyrosine 
kinases. SLP-76 has been implicated as an essential component in T cell 
signaling. FYB is selectively phosphorylated by FYN-T, providing a template for 
the recruitment of FYN-T and SLP-76 SH2 domains. Coexpression of FYN-T, FYB, and 
SLP-76 can synergistically up-regulate IL-2 production in T cells upon TCR 
ligation. In this report, we show that two tyrosines, Tyr595 and Tyr651, of FYB 
are major sites of phosphorylation by FYN-T and mediate binding to SLP-76 in 
Jurkat T cells. Furthermore, the synergistic up-regulation of IL-2 promoter 
activity in the FYN-T-FYB-SLP-76 pathway is contingent upon the interaction 
between FYB and SLP-76, but not the interaction between FYB and FYN-T. These 
observations define a pathway by which SLP-76 interacts with downstream 
components in the up-regulation of T cell cytokine production.
