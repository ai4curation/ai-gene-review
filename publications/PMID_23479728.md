Identification of new anti-apoptotic genes is important for understanding the 
molecular mechanisms underlying apoptosis and tumorigenesis. The present study 
identified a novel anti-apoptotic gene named AREL1, which encodes a HECT 
(homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus) family E3 ubiquitin ligase. AREL1 
interacted with and ubiquitinated IAP antagonists such as SMAC, HtrA2, and ARTS. 
However, AREL1 was cytosolic and did not localize to nuclei or mitochondria. The 
interactions between AREL1 and the IAP antagonists were specific for 
apoptosis-stimulated cells, in which the IAP antagonists were released into the 
cytosol from mitochondria. Furthermore, the ubiquitination and degradation of 
SMAC, HtrA2, and ARTS were significantly enhanced in AREL1-expressing cells 
following apoptotic stimulation, indicating that AREL1 binds to and 
ubiquitinates cytosolic but not mitochondria-associated forms of IAP 
antagonists. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic role of AREL1-mediated degradation 
of SMAC, HtrA2, and ARTS was shown by simultaneous knockdown of three IAP 
antagonists, which caused the inhibition of caspase-3 cleavage, XIAP 
degradation, and induction of apoptosis. Therefore, the present study suggests 
that AREL1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of cytosolic forms of three 
IAP antagonists plays an important role in the regulation of apoptosis.
