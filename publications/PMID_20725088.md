Ret finger protein-like 1 (RFPL1) is a primate-specific target gene of Pax6, a 
key transcription factor for pancreas, eye and neocortex development. However, 
its cellular activity remains elusive. In this article, we report that 
Pax6-elicited expression of the human (h)RFPL1 gene in HeLa cells can be 
enhanced by in vivo p53 binding to its promoter and therefore investigated the 
hypothesis that hRFPL1 regulates cell-cycle progression. Upon expression in 
these cells, hRFPL1 decreased cell number through a kinase-dependent mechanism 
as PKC activates and Cdc2 inhibits hRFPL1 activity. hRFPL1 antiproliferative 
activity led to an increased cell population in G(2)/M phase and specific cyclin 
B1 and Cdc2 downregulations, which were precluded by a proteasome inhibitor. 
Specifically, cytoplasm-localized hRFPL1 prevented cyclin B1 and Cdc2 
accumulation during interphase. Consequently, cells showed a delayed entry into 
mitosis and cell-cycle lengthening resulting from a threefold increase in G(2) 
phase duration. Given previous reports that RFPL1 is expressed during cell 
differentiation, its impact on cell-cycle lengthening therefore provides novel 
insights into primate-specific development.

Abstract

Ret finger protein-like 1 ( RFPL1 ) is a primate-specific target gene of Pax6, a key transcription factor for pancreas, eye and neocortex development. However, its cellular activity remains elusive. In this article, we report that Pax6-elicited expression of the human (h) RFPL1 gene in HeLa cells can be enhanced by in vivo p53 binding to its promoter and therefore investigated the hypothesis that hRFPL1 regulates cell-cycle progression. Upon expression in these cells, hRFPL1 decreased cell number through a kinase-dependent mechanism as PKC activates and Cdc2 inhibits hRFPL1 activity. hRFPL1 antiproliferative activity led to an increased cell population in G 2 /M phase and specific cyclin B1 and Cdc2 downregulations, which were precluded by a proteasome inhibitor. Specifically, cytoplasm-localized hRFPL1 prevented cyclin B1 and Cdc2 accumulation during interphase. Consequently, cells showed a delayed entry into mitosis and cell-cycle lengthening resulting from a threefold increase in G 2 phase duration. Given previous reports that RFPL1 is expressed during cell differentiation, its impact on cell-cycle lengthening therefore provides novel insights into primate-specific development.

Discussion

Cell-cycle regulation is a crucial and tightly regulated cellular mechanism involved in a wide range of biological processes. Here we show that h RFPL1 transcriptional level can be regulated downstream of Pax6 signaling by the prototypical cell-cycle-regulating p53 transcription factor in a cell-specific manner and hRFPL1 exerts a phosphorylation-dependent antiproliferative effect that is positively regulated by PKC and abrogated by Cdc2. We further report that hRFPL1 controls G 2 –M phase transition by preventing the accumulation of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 proteins during interphase through a proteasome-dependent mechanism. Thus, such an activity lengthens G 2 phase duration, which accumulates cell population in G 2 phase and delays cell entry into mitosis.

So far, little was known about the cellular activity of the RFPL proteins. The reported expression of the murine (m)RFPL in germ cells, its putative role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase based on its predicted secondary structure and its biochemical interaction with cyclin B1 as well as with HR6A, PMSB1 and ubiquitin B proteins of the proteasomal degradation pathway led to the conclusion that it could regulate meiosis progression. 5 , 6 However, the expression of RFPL genes in other tissues 4 suggested that they could regulate other aspects of cell division. Upon gain of function in HeLa cells, we report here that hRFPL1 elicited cyclin B1 and Cdc2 downregulations that were precluded by a proteasome inhibitor, in line with the previous biochemical identification of mRFPL-interacting proteins. 6 However, in contrast to the classical view that cyclin B1 degradation occurs during anaphase to allow mitosis exit and cell-cycle progression, 18 our study data indicate that hRFPL1 prevented the accumulation of cyclin B1 and its partner Cdc2 during interphase, leading to an antiproliferative activity by an increase in G 2 phase duration, a cell accumulation in G 2 phase and thus a delay of cell entry into mitosis.

Despite our observations were primarily found in an hRFPL1-overexpressing cell system, we also observed, in a model where Pax6 directly induces h RFPL1 endogenous expression and elicits a decrease in cyclin B1 and Cdc2 levels, that the latter was prevented by h RFPL1 RNA interference, supporting the physiological relevance of this hRFPL1 activity. Given that these data were obtained following Pax6 gain of function, it is noteworthy that, in progenitor cells endogenously expressing Pax6, the physiological levels of this latter are highly dynamic during cell-cycle progression, and an increase in Pax6 during G 2 phase can notably occur to specify their differentiation. 19 Increase in Pax6 levels, either physiological or ectopic, has been shown to direct cell-cycle exit and differentiation. 19 , 20 , 21 Accordingly, we previously observed that ectopic Pax6 expression provoked a postmitotic G 0 /G 1 cell-cycle arrest in HeLa cells. 9 This was however not altered by h RFPL1 RNA interference (data not shown), suggesting that hRFPL1 influence on cell-cycle progression is not sufficient to produce cell-cycle exit and differentiation in Pax6-expressing cells.

Indirectly supporting the specificity of hRFPL1 cellular function, we also observed that hRFPL1 did not alter the protein levels of cyclins or CDKs controlling the progression of other cell-cycle phases, nor those of other regulators of G 2 –M phase transition.

In respect with our data, it has been previously reported that cells failing to accumulate cyclin B1 have an increased cell population in G 2 /M phase due to an altered G 2 –M phase transition. 22 , 23 Such a failure in cyclin B1 accumulation could rely on p53 activity 22 or on interphasic activation of E3 ubiquitin protein ligases. 23 We however did not find any change in the protein levels of p53 or of its canonical effector, p21 WAF1/CIP1 .

We also observed that the decreased cell proliferation elicited by hRFPL1 was accompanied by apoptotic cell death. Although apoptosis may be considered as a nonspecific, toxic effect of hRFPL1 overexpression, it is known that cyclin B1 inhibition, by arresting cells in G 2 phase, leads to apoptosis. 24 , 25 Hence, hRFPL1-mediated cell death could be the consequence of its influence on cyclin B1 levels. The fact that Cdc2 levels were concomitantly regulated by hRFPL1 is also of importance. Indeed, Cdc2 is the most important CDK for cell-cycle regulation: it is the only one controlling cell-cycle progression in simple eukaryotes 26 and it has been shown in multiple knockout mice that Cdc2 is the only mandatory CDK to promote the mammalian cycle whereas the lack of other CDKs can be overcome by compensating mechanisms. 27 This indicates that hRFPL1-mediated control of cell cycle through the regulation of Cdc2 protein level could not be overruled by other cyclin/CDK-dependent processes, therefore making it a very tight and precise mechanism.

This also emphasizes the importance of Cdc2 regulation of hRFPL1 activity. Such a post-translational regulatory mechanism is traditionally described to pinpoint the oscillatory activity of proteins controlling cell-cycle progression. 28 Accordingly, we propose that hRFPL1 activity would oscillate during cell-cycle progression to exert a finely tuned effect, first through a PKC-dependent phosphorylation allowing its activation during S and G 2 phases to prevent cyclin B1 and Cdc2 accumulation. Then, a Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation would terminate hRFPL1 action, probably on M phase triggering cyclin B1/Cdc2 activation. Moreover, hRFPL1 regulation could reach another degree of complexity as we also observed that PKCs could be involved in Pax6 signaling mediating h RFPL1 transcription.

Our observations also showed that h RFPL1 expression level could be regulated by a Pax6-dependent p53 activation. Pax6-mediated h RFPL1 expression appeared to be cell specific and could rely, among other hypotheses, on chromatin state of the h RFPL1 locus or on the presence of specific interacting partners. Although p53 could not transactivate h RFPL1 promoter in any tested cell line, it was able to enhance Pax6-elicited h RFPL1 levels in HeLa cells. Such an enhancing activity offers a first mechanistic hypothesis to support the previously reported importance of RFPL1,2,3 gene-dosage effect. 4 It also suggests the involvement of other transcription factors or protein partners for recruiting p53 activity. Fitting with this hypothesis, it has been previously reported a transcriptional cooperation between p53 and a ligand-bound estrogen receptor to result in a regulatory cross talk synergistically transactivating VEGFR1/FLT1 , whereas p53 alone has relatively no effect. 29 , 30 In addition, Pax6-downregulated FOXM1 and MCM5 genes were not affected by p53 RNA interference despite it has been reported in other cell systems that p53 could also repress their expression independently of Pax6 signaling. 31 , 32 Thus, cross talk between Pax6 signaling and p53 activity appears to regulate specific genes in a given environment as the identification of either Pax6 or p53 target genes greatly varies depending on the cell system used. 4 , 13 , 33 , 34 , 35

Although we observed that hRFPL1 impact on cell number and on cyclin B1 and Cdc2 levels was shared by hRFPL2, hRFPL3 and mRFPL, indicating that this activity was conserved during the evolution of this gene family, it is noteworthy that such an activity involved the RDM domain. This RDM, present in all RFPL proteins but restricted to them, is the result of a neofunctionalization event that occurred after the emergence of the RFPL gene ancestor. 4 Thus, RDM acquisition likely retained the functionality of the ancestral gene after its emergence by conferring it its antiproliferative activity. Further, RDM forms together with the RING domain a large zinc-finger structure of the RING/U-Box superfamily. RING-containing proteins are known to exert an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase activity with the zinc-finger structure being mandatory for binding to the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. 36 Hence, our study data suggest that the C-terminal part of the RING-RDM-formed zinc finger is crucial for hRFPL1 antiproliferative activity, fitting with the concept that the RFPL proteins function as E3 ubiquitin protein ligases. Although this domain was crucial, it was not sufficient to exert any intrinsic effect as hRFPL1-mediated antiproliferation also relied on SPRY N-terminal part that has been reported to be the region in which cyclin B1 binds to mRFPL. 6 Thus, SPRY would function as the recognition domain for proteasome-targeted substrates.

In line with a possible influence of hRFPL1 on development and cell differentiation, it has been reported that hRFPL1 protein expression is induced during chemically mediated differentiation of human gastric carcinoma cells. 36 , 37 We also detected a striking increase in h RFPL1 transcript level in differentiating human embryonic stem cells at the onset of neurogenesis, 4 during which regulation of cell-cycle lengthening is a key event to trigger transition from proliferation to differentiation. 38 , 39 The potential ability of hRFPL1 to trigger cell death is also of interest, as it has been reported that some cell-cycle regulators can elicit a key pro-apoptotic activity during diverse processes such as developmental morphogenesis 40 or tumor suppression. 41 Thus, this report that the primate-restricted RFPL1 modulates G 2 –M phase transition could provide novel insights into understanding developmental changes over the course of evolution.
