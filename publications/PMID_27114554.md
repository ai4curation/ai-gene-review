Regulation of nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of oncoproteins is critical for 
growth homeostasis. Dysregulated trafficking contributes to malignancy, whereas 
understanding the process can reveal unique therapeutic opportunities. Here, we 
focus on eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a prooncogenic 
protein highly elevated in many cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 
Typically, eIF4E is localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it acts 
in export and translation of specific methyl 7-guanosine (m(7)G)-capped mRNAs, 
respectively. Nuclear accumulation of eIF4E in patients who have AML is 
correlated with increased eIF4E-dependent export of transcripts encoding 
oncoproteins. The subcellular localization of eIF4E closely correlates with 
patients' responses. During clinical responses to the m(7)G-cap competitor 
ribavirin, eIF4E is mainly cytoplasmic. At relapse, eIF4E reaccumulates in the 
nucleus, leading to elevated eIF4E-dependent mRNA export. We have identified 
importin 8 as a factor that directly imports eIF4E into the nucleus. We found 
that importin 8 is highly elevated in untreated patients with AML, leading to 
eIF4E nuclear accumulation. Importin 8 only imports cap-free eIF4E. 
Cap-dependent changes to the structure of eIF4E underpin this selectivity. 
Indeed, m(7)G cap analogs or ribavirin prevents nuclear entry of eIF4E, which 
mirrors the trafficking phenotypes observed in patients with AML. Our studies 
also suggest that nuclear entry is important for the prooncogenic activity of 
eIF4E, at least in this context. These findings position nuclear trafficking of 
eIF4E as a critical step in its regulation and position the importin 8-eIF4E 
complex as a novel therapeutic target.
