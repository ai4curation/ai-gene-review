The MEN2A oncogene encodes for a constitutive active member of the RET receptor 
tyrosine kinase family. Here, we report that MEN2A-RET activates Signal 
Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) via two YxxV/Q STAT3 docking 
sites, Tyr752 and Tyr928. MEN2A-RET induces both Tyr705 and Ser727 
phosphorylation of STAT3, and STAT3 serine phosphorylation is required for its 
maximal transcriptional activity. Stable NIH3T3 cell lines expressing both 
MEN2A-RET and STAT3alpha but not STAT3beta, are characterized by enhanced 
proliferation and cyclin-D1 promoter activity, and enhanced growth in soft agar. 
These data indicate that malignant cell growth induced by MEN2A-RET involves its 
activation of STAT3.
