Coilin is a nuclear protein that plays a role in Cajal body formation. The 
function of nucleoplasmic coilin is unknown. Here we report that coilin 
interacts with Ku70 and Ku80, which are major players in the DNA repair process. 
Ku proteins compete with SMN and SmB' proteins for coilin interaction sites. The 
binding domain on coilin for Ku proteins cannot be localized to one discrete 
region, and only full-length coilin is capable of inhibiting in vitro 
non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ). Since Ku proteins do not accumulate in 
CBs, these findings suggest that nucleoplasmic coilin participates in the 
regulation of DNA repair.
