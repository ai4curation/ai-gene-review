Mutations in the phosphotyrosine binding domain protein ARH cause autosomal 
recessive hypercholesterolemia, a disorder caused by defective internalization 
of low density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) in the liver. To examine the 
function of ARH, we used pull-down experiments to test for interactions between 
ARH, the LDLR, and proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The 
phosphotyrosine binding domain of ARH interacted with the internalization 
sequence (NPVY) in the cytoplasmic tail of LDLR in a sequence-specific manner. 
Mutations in the NPVY sequence that were previously shown to decrease LDLR 
internalization abolished in vitro binding to ARH. Recombinant ARH bound 
purified bovine clathrin with high affinity (K(D), approximately 44 nm). The 
interaction between ARH and clathrin was mapped to a canonical clathrin box 
sequence (LLDLE) in ARH and to the N-terminal domain of the clathrin heavy 
chain. A highly conserved 20-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal region of ARH 
bound the beta(2)-adaptin subunit of AP-2. Mutation of a glutamic acid residue 
in the appendage domain of beta(2)-adaptin that is required for interaction with 
the adapter protein beta-arrestin markedly reduced binding to ARH. These data 
are consistent with the hypothesis that ARH functions as an adaptor protein that 
couples LDLR to the endocytic machinery.
