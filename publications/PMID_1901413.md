The SNF2, SNF5, and SNF6 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are required for 
expression of a variety of differently regulated genes. Previous evidence 
implicated the SNF5 protein in transcriptional activation, and a DNA-bound 
LexA-SNF5 fusion protein was shown to activate expression of a nearby promoter. 
Here, we examine the functional relationship of the SNF2, SNF5, and SNF6 
proteins. Activation by DNA-bound LexA-SNF5 fusion protein was greatly reduced 
in snf2 and snf6 mutants, indicating that activation by LexA-SNF5 requires SNF2 
and SNF6 function. An spt6 mutation, which suppresses transcriptional defects 
caused by snf2, restored activation by LexA-SNF5 in a snf2 mutant. The SNF2 gene 
was sequenced and encodes a 194-kDa protein that is targeted to the nucleus. 
DNA-bound LexA-SNF2 fusion protein also activated transcription, dependent on 
SNF5 and SNF6. These findings suggest that SNF2, SNF5, and SNF6 function 
interdependently in transcriptional activation, possibly forming a heteromeric 
complex.
