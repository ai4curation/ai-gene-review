Autophagy, the degradation of cytoplasmic components, is an evolutionarily 
conserved homeostatic process involved in environmental adaptation, lifespan 
determination and tumour development. The tumor suppressor Beclin1 is part of 
the PI(3) kinase class III (PI(3)KC3) lipid-kinase complex that induces 
autophagy. The autophagic activity of the Beclin1-PI(3)KC3 complex, however, is 
suppressed by Bcl-2. Here, we report the identification of a novel coiled-coil 
UV irradiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG) as a positive regulator of the 
Beclin1-PI(3)KC3 complex. UVRAG, a tumour suppressor candidate that is 
monoallelically mutated at high frequency in human colon cancers, associates 
with the Beclin1-Bcl-2-PI(3)KC3 multiprotein complex, where UVRAG and Beclin1 
interdependently induce autophagy. UVRAG-mediated activation of the 
Beclin1-PI(3)KC3 complex promotes autophagy and also suppresses the 
proliferation and tumorigenicity of human colon cancer cells. These results 
identify UVRAG as an essential component of the Beclin1-PI(3)KC3 lipid kinase 
complex that is an important signalling checkpoint for autophagy and tumour-cell 
growth.
