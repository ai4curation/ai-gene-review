Regulated interactions between short, unstructured amino acid sequences and 
modular protein domains are central to cell signaling. Here we use synthetic 
peptides in "active" (e.g. phosphorylated) and "control" (e.g. 
non-phosphorylated) forms as baits in affinity pull-down experiments to 
determine such interactions by quantitative proteomics. Stable isotope labeling 
by amino acids in cell culture distinguishes specific binders directly by the 
isotope ratios determined by mass spectrometry (Blagoev, B., Kratchmarova, I., 
Ong, S.-E., Nielsen, M., Foster, L. J., and Mann, M. (2003) Nat. Biotechnol. 21, 
315-318). A tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide of the epidermal growth factor 
receptor specifically retrieved the Src homology domain (SH) 2- and SH3 
domain-containing adapter protein Grb2. A proline-rich sequence of Son of 
Sevenless also specifically bound Grb2, demonstrating that the screen maintains 
specificity with low affinity interactions. The proline-rich Sos peptide 
retrieved only SH3 domain containing proteins as specific binding partners. Two 
of these, Pacsin 3 and Sorting Nexin 9, were confirmed by immunoprecipitation. 
Our data are consistent with a change in the role of Sos from Ras-dependent 
signaling to actin remodeling/endocytic signaling events by a proline-SH3 domain 
switch.
