The mouse double minute 2 (MDM2)-p53 interaction regulates the activity of p53 
and is a potential target for human cancer therapy. Here, we report that RYBP 
(RING1- and YY1-binding protein), a member of the polycomb group (PcG), 
interacts with MDM2 and decreases MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, leading to

Abstract

The mouse double minute 2 (MDM2)–p53 interaction regulates the activity of p53 and is a potential target for human cancer therapy. Here, we report that RYBP (RING1- and YY1-binding protein), a member of the polycomb group (PcG), interacts with MDM2 and decreases MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, leading to stabilization of p53 and an increase in p53 activity. RYBP induces cell-cycle arrest and is involved in the p53 response to DNA damage. Expression of RYBP is decreased in human cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. These results show that RYBP is a new regulator of the MDM2–p53 loop and that it has tumour suppressor activity.

Introduction

Tumour suppressor p53 helps to maintain genomic integrity, regulates the cell-stress response, and controls human cancer development and progression. The loss of normal functional p53 can result in malignancies. In response to cellular stress, p53 stabilization and activation lead to cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis and/or senescence ( Harris & Levine, 2005 ). Approximately half of all human malignancies carry mutant p53, and many tumours containing wild-type p53 have abnormalities in p53 regulators such as mouse double minute 2 (MDM2; Vogelstein et al , 2000 ).

The MDM2 oncogene is amplified and/or overexpressed in a wide range of human cancers (reviewed by Rayburn et al , 2005 ). MDM2 inhibits the activities of p53, and promotes its ubiquitination and degradation ( Haupt et al , 1997 ). In turn, the transcription of MDM2 is activated by p53. This MDM2–p53 feedback loop is one of the main mechanisms of p53 regulation, and it has been considered a target for human cancer therapy and prevention ( Poyurovsky & Prives, 2006 ). The molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating the MDM2–p53 feedback loop are not fully understood; however, we and others have identified several regulators of the MDM2–p53 loop ( Zhang et al , 2003 , 2004 ; Dai et al , 2004 ; Chen et al , 2007 ; He & Sun, 2007 ; Sun et al , 2008 ; Zhang & Zhang, 2008 ). Here, we identified RYBP (RING1 and YY1 binding protein), a polycomb group (PcG) complex member, as a new modulator of the MDM2–p53 interaction.

Discussion

The regulation of p53 has been a major focus for human cancer research ( Poyurovsky & Prives, 2006 ). The p53 protein is primarily regulated at the post-translational level through the ubiquitination–proteasome system, and its ubiquitination is largely induced by MDM2 ( Jones et al , 1995 ; Kubbutat et al , 1997 ). This study represents our continuing efforts in determining the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of the MDM2–p53 interaction. Herein, we show that RYBP is a new regulator of the MDM2–p53 loop, and provide evidence that it functions as a tumour suppressor.

Although several studies have indicated that RYBP is a ubiquitin-binding protein ( Arrigoni et al , 2006 ) that induces apoptosis ( Zheng et al , 2001 ; Danen-van Oorschot et al , 2004 ; Novak & Phillips, 2008 ), its precise function remains unclear. Here, we used human tissue samples to show that RYBP is downregulated or modified in tumour tissues compared with corresponding control tissues. We also showed an increase in RYBP and p53 following exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. Our studies suggest that the activation of p53 following etoposide-induced DNA damage requires RYBP.

We speculate that RYBP binding to MDM2 results in changes in the conformation of MDM2, leading to an alteration of its interaction with p53, precluding its function in the ubiquitination and degradation of p53. In addition, we suggest that there is a distinct role for the ternary complex of RYBP, MDM2 and p53, beyond its main activity in inhibiting the MDM2–p53 interaction. As RYBP binds to MDM2 but not to p53, it is likely that the ternary complex acts as a reservoir of both p53 and MDM2, maintaining a basal level of the proteins. Following cellular stress such as DNA damage, the ternary complex might undergo conformational changes, allowing p53 to be released—to respond to the stress—while limiting the free MDM2 pool, thereby reducing the rate of p53 degradation. In addition, the ternary complex might be required for the functions of both RYBP and p53 in regulating gene expression ( García et al , 1999 ). These hypotheses should be tested in future studies.

We cannot exclude other effects of RYBP on MDM2. Our results indicate that RYBP stabilizes MDM2, independently of p53. In the absence of p53, MDM2 is able to repress transcription when tethered to a reporter gene promoter ( Minsky & Oren, 2004 ). Therefore, RYBP and MDM2 might form a protein complex in which RYBP recruits MDM2 to its target gene promoters. Furthermore, as the PcG complex is necessary for the repression of important developmental genes, and as RYBP, MDM2 and p53 are all involved in apoptosis, future studies should investigate the functional consequences of the link between the PcG complex, RYBP, MDM2 and p53 in mammalian development and carcinogenesis, as well as their implications in disease prevention and treatment.

Methods

Plasmids and reagents. The yeast two-hybrid assay was described previously ( Chen et al , 2007 ). The amplified RYBP sequence was cloned into pGADT7 and pCMV-3Tag vectors. The preparation and sources of other plasmids, reagents, qRT–PCR primers and conditions are described in the supplementary information online.

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Plasmids were transfected with Lipofectin ® into cells as indicated. Cells were collected at the indicated times post-transfection, and lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). Cell lysates were used for immunoblotting as described previously ( Zhang & Zhang, 2008 ). Immunoprecipitation was conducted using the indicated antibodies. Beads were washed, and bound proteins were detected by immunoblotting as reported previously ( Zhang & Zhang, 2008 ).

Ni-NTA ubiquitination assay. Ni-NTA ubiquitination assays were conducted as described previously with minor modifications ( Zhang et al , 2004 ).

Generation of GST fusion proteins and pull-down assays. Binding between the MDM2 protein and RYBP in vitro was assessed using glutathione S -transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The bound proteins were captured by glutathione-agarose beads and resolved using SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( Zhang & Zhang, 2008 ).

Cell-cycle distribution assay. The cell-cycle distribution assay was accomplished as described previously ( Zhang & Zhang, 2008 ).

Analysis of RYBP levels in human cancer tissues and controls. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nantong Hospital. Fresh surgical specimens of hepatocellular ( n =6) and lung ( n =6) cancer tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were obtained from Nantong Cancer Hospital, Nantong, China. All the diagnoses were histologically confirmed. Western blot analyses with fresh tissues, as well as immunohistochemical analyses of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections, were conducted as described in the supplementary information online.
