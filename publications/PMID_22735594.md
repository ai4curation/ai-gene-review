Dermokine-β is abundant in stratified epithelia and in differentiating cultured 
keratinocytes. In this study, we investigated the role of dermokine-β in 
differentiation of keratinocytes. Treatment of keratinocytes or skin tumor cells 
with dermokine-β attenuated phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated 
kinase (ERK). Exposure of cells to dermokine-β, as well as its carboxyl-terminus 
domain peptide, interrupted phosphorylation of ERK and stimulated dermokine gene 
expression. Inhibition of ERK signaling by its specific inhibitor also increased 
dermokine expression level. A combination of chemical cross-linking and 
immunoprecipitation, followed by proteomics analyses, identified 
glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) as a dermokine-β-associated protein. 
Blockage of GRP78 expression by a specific siRNA abrogated actions of 
dermokine-β. These findings provide novel insights into the physiological 
significance of dermokine-β in the epidermis.
