Cycling proteins play important roles in the organization and function of the 
early secretory pathway by participating in membrane traffic and selective 
transport of cargo between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the intermediate 
compartment (ERGIC), and the Golgi. To identify new cycling proteins, we have 
developed a novel procedure for the purification of ERGIC membranes from HepG2 
cells treated with brefeldin A, a drug known to accumulate cycling proteins in 
the ERGIC. Membranes enriched 110-fold over the homogenate for ERGIC-53 were 
obtained and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Major proteins corresponded to 
established and putative cargo receptors and components mediating protein 
maturation and membrane traffic. Among the uncharacterized proteins, a 32-kDa 
protein termed ERGIC-32 is a novel cycling membrane protein with sequence 
homology to Erv41p and Erv46p, two proteins enriched in COPII vesicles of yeast. 
ERGIC-32 localizes to the ERGIC and partially colocalizes with the human 
homologs of Erv41p and Erv46p, which mainly localize to the cis-Golgi. ERGIC-32 
interacts with human Erv46 (hErv46) as revealed by covalent cross-linking and 
mistargeting experiments, and silencing of ERGIC-32 by small interfering RNAs 
increases the turnover of hErv46. We propose that ERGIC-32 functions as a 
modulator of the hErv41-hErv46 complex by stabilizing hErv46. Our novel approach 
for the isolation of the ERGIC from BFA-treated cells may ultimately lead to the 
identification of all proteins rapidly cycling early in the secretory pathway.
