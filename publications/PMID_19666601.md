In addition to its cellular homeostasis function, autophagy is emerging as a 
central component of antimicrobial host defense against diverse infections. To 
counteract this mechanism, many pathogens have evolved to evade, subvert, or 
exploit autophagy. Here, we report that autophagy proteins (i.e., Beclin-1, 
Atg4B, Atg5, and Atg12) are proviral factors required for translation of 
incoming hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA and, thereby, for initiation of HCV 
replication, but they are not required once infection is established. These 
results illustrate a previously unappreciated role for autophagy in the 
establishment of a viral infection and they suggest that different host factors 
regulate the translation of incoming viral genome and translation of progeny HCV 
RNA once replication is established.
