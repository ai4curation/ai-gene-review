Sorting nexins (SNX) comprise a family of proteins with homology to several 
yeast proteins, including Vps5p and Mvp1p, that are required for the sorting of 
proteins to the yeast vacuole. Human SNX1, -2, and -4 have been proposed to play 
a role in receptor trafficking and have been shown to bind to several receptor 
tyrosine kinases, including receptors for epidermal growth factor, 
platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin as well as the long form of the 
leptin receptor, a glycoprotein 130-associated receptor. We now describe a novel 
member of this family, SNX6, which interacts with members of the transforming 
growth factor-beta family of receptor serine-threonine kinases. These receptors 
belong to two classes: type II receptors that bind ligand, and type I receptors 
that are subsequently recruited to transduce the signal. Of the type II 
receptors, SNX6 was found to interact strongly with ActRIIB and more moderately 
with wild type and kinase-defective mutants of TbetaRII. Of the type I 
receptors, SNX6 was found to interact only with inactivated TbetaRI. SNXs 1-4 
also interacted with the transforming growth factor-beta receptor family, 
showing different receptor preferences. Conversely, SNX6 behaved similarly to 
the other SNX proteins in its interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases. 
Strong heteromeric interactions were also seen among SNX1, -2, -4, and -6, 
suggesting the formation in vivo of oligomeric complexes. These findings are the 
first evidence for the association of the SNX family of molecules with receptor 
serine-threonine kinases.
