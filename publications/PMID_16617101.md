strong signal in the nucleus under unstressed control conditions when fused to 
constitutive active DREB2A but only a weak signal when fused to full-length 
DREB2A. The region between DREB2A residues 136 and 165 plays a role in the 
stability of this protein in the nucleus, which is important for protein 
activation.

INTRODUCTION

Plant growth and productivity are affected by various abiotic stresses, such as drought, high salinity, and low temperature. Plants respond and adapt to these stresses at the physiological and biochemical levels. Moreover, many genes that function in stress tolerance are induced under stress conditions ( Thomashow, 1999 ; Bray et al., 2000 ; Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2003 ). Most of these stress-inducible genes are controlled by abscisic acid (ABA), but some are not, indicating the involvement of both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent regulatory systems in stress-responsive gene expression ( Zhu, 2002 ; Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 2005 ). Several stress-inducible genes, such as RD29A and COR15A , are induced through the ABA-independent pathway. A 9-bp conserved sequence, TACCGACAT, named the dehydration-responsive element (DRE), is an essential cis -acting element for regulation of RD29A induction in the ABA-independent response to dehydration, high salinity, and cold ( Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1994 ). Similar cis -acting elements, named C-repeat (CRT) and low-temperature-responsive element, both containing an A/GCCGAC motif that forms the core of the DRE sequence, regulate cold-inducible gene expression ( Baker et al., 1994 ; Jiang et al., 1996 ; Thomashow, 1999 ).

Three cDNAs encoding DRE binding proteins, CBF1 , DREB1A , and DREB2A , have been isolated by the yeast one-hybrid screening method ( Stockinger et al., 1997 ; Liu et al., 1998 ). The proteins showed significant sequence similarity in the conserved DNA binding domain found in the ERF/AP2 proteins. They specifically bind to the DRE/CRT sequence and activate the transcription of genes driven by the DRE/CRT sequence in Arabidopsis thaliana . We isolated two cDNA clones homologous to DREB1A ( DREB1B and DREB1C ) and one cDNA homologous to DREB2A ( DREB2B ; Liu et al., 1998 ; Shinwari et al., 1998 ). Gilmour et al. (1998) also reported cloning of two CBF1 homologues, CBF2 and CBF3 , from Arabidopsis. CBF1 is identical to DREB1B , and its two homologues, CBF2 and CBF3 , are identical to DREB1C and DREB1A , respectively. Expression of the DREB1/CBF genes is induced by cold stress but not by drought and high-salinity stress. By contrast, expression of the DREB2 genes is induced by drought or high-salt stresses ( Liu et al., 1998 ). Both DREB1/CBF and DREB2 proteins bind to DRE/CRT, but DREB1/CBF are thought to function in cold-responsive gene expression, whereas DREB2 proteins are involved in drought-responsive gene expression. More recently, Sakuma et al. (2002) reported three novel DREB1/CBF -related genes that were not expressed at high levels under various stress conditions. However, one of them, CBF4/DREB1D , is induced by osmotic stress ( Haake et al., 2002 ; Sakuma et al., 2002 ), and the other two, DDF1/DREB1F and DDF2/DREB1E , are induced by high-salinity stress ( Sakuma et al., 2002 ; Magome et al., 2004 ), suggesting the existence of crosstalk between the CBF/DREB1 and DREB2 pathways.

Overexpression of DREB1/CBF driven by the 35S promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus ( CaMV ) caused growth retardation under normal growth conditions and increased tolerance to dehydration, high salinity, and freezing in transgenic Arabidopsis ( Jaglo-Ottosen et al., 1998 ; Liu et al., 1998 ; Kasuga et al., 1999 ), suggesting that the DREB1A/CBF proteins function without modification in cold stress–responsive gene expression. More than 40 genes downstream of DREB1/CBF have been identified through the use of both cDNA and GeneChip microarrays ( Seki et al., 2001 ; Fowler and Thomashow, 2002 ; Maruyama et al., 2004 ). Many of their protein products are probably responsible for the stress tolerance of transgenic plants. The downstream genes also include genes for transcription factors, such as C2H2 zinc-finger-type and AP2/ERF-type transcription factors, suggesting the existence of further regulation of gene expression downstream of the DRE/DREB1 (CRT/CBF) regulon ( Fowler and Thomashow, 2002 ; Maruyama et al., 2004 ). Conserved sequences in the promoter regions of the genes directly downstream of DREB1A were analyzed, and A/GCCGACNT was found in their promoter regions between −51 and −450 as a consensus DRE ( Maruyama et al., 2004 ). DREB homologues have been reported from various species of both monocots and dicots, such as Brassica napus , tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ), barley ( Hordeum vulgare ), maize ( Zea mays ), rice ( Oryza sativa ), rye ( Secale cereale ), and wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) ( Jaglo et al., 2001 ; Choi et al., 2002 ; Gao et al., 2002 ; Xue, 2002 ; Dubouzet et al., 2003 ; Qin et al., 2004 ). These genes have also been shown to function in cold stress tolerance in those plants.

The DREB2 protein also has a conserved ERF/AP2 DNA binding domain and recognizes the DRE sequence. A database search of the Arabidopsis whole-genome sequence found at least six DREB2 homologues encoded in the Arabidopsis genome other than DREB2A and DREB2B. DREB2A and DREB2B are induced strongly by drought and high salinity, but the others are not. In addition, expression levels of the other six DREB2 homologues under stress conditions are very low. Therefore, among the eight DREB2-type proteins, DREB2A and DREB2B are thought to be major transcription factors that function under drought and high-salinity stress conditions ( Nakashima et al., 2000 ; Sakuma et al., 2002 ). However, overexpression of DREB2A in transgenic plants neither caused growth retardation nor improved stress tolerance, suggesting that the DREB2A protein requires posttranslational modification, such as phosphorylation, for its activation ( Liu et al., 1998 ), but the activation mechanism has not been elucidated yet.

In this study, we performed domain analysis of the DREB2A protein and found that its C-terminal region functions as a transcriptional activation domain and that its middle region functions as a negative regulatory domain in the regulation of DREB2A activity. We succeeded in producing a constitutive active form of DREB2A by deletion of this negative regulatory domain. We analyzed genes downstream of DREB2A using transgenic plants overexpressing the constitutive active form of DREB2A and identified many drought-inducible genes lying downstream of DREB2A. We also analyzed the stress tolerance of the transgenic plants and found improvement of drought stress tolerance. These results indicate that DREB2A plays important roles in stress response and tolerance to drought in Arabidopsis .

DISCUSSION

DREB2A and DREB1A were simultaneously isolated as transcription factors that recognize a cis -acting element, DRE/CRT, through the use of a yeast one-hybrid screening method ( Liu et al., 1998 ). Although the function of DREB1A in cold stress–responsive gene expression has been analyzed extensively, that of DREB2A has not been elucidated yet ( Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2003 ). DREB2A seems to function mainly in ABA-independent water stress–inducible gene expression, since expression of DREB2A is strongly induced by drought and high-salinity stresses but not by ABA treatment ( Liu et al., 1998 ). However, we could not detect any phenotypic changes in a T-DNA insertion mutant of DREB2A under water stress conditions (data not shown). The DREB2A family consists of eight members, and at least DREB2B is strongly induced by drought and high-salinity stresses like DREB2A ( Sakuma et al., 2002 ). Thus, the function of the DREB2A family genes may be redundant under water stress conditions, and a loss-of-function approach may not be effective. In this study, we have made important progress in the understanding of the function of DREB2A in water stress–responsive gene expression using a gain-of-function approach with DREB2A CA.

We showed that an acidic region (amino acids 254 to 335) in the C terminus of DREB2A plays an important role as a transcriptional activation domain of the DREB2A protein in transactivation experiments using protoplasts ( Figure 2 ). An acidic region in the C terminus of DREB1A was also reported to function as an activation domain ( Liu et al., 1998 ). Although both DREB1A and DREB2A contain an acidic activation domain, overexpression of these proteins showed different phenotypic changes in transgenic plants ( Liu et al., 1998 ). Overexpression of DREB1A not only induced strong expression of the downstream genes under unstressed conditions but also caused dwarfed phenotypes in the plants. These transgenic plants were tolerant to freezing and drought. By contrast, overexpression of DREB2A FL cDNA did not induce expression of the downstream genes under unstressed conditions and showed few phenotypic changes in transgenic plants ( Figure 3 ; Liu et al., 1998 ). Therefore, the translated DREB2A protein seems to be an inactive form under unstressed conditions, and modification under stress seems to be necessary for its activation. We showed that the deletion of the 136 to 165 amino acid region significantly increased DREB2A activity in Arabidopsis protoplasts ( Figure 1 ), and the resultant protein is active in transgenic plants even under unstressed control conditions ( Figure 3 ). Therefore, this region may function negatively in the activation of the DREB2A protein under unstressed control conditions.

Using microarray and RNA gel blot analyses of the 35S : DREB2A CA plants, we identified 21 genes that were upregulated by overexpression of DREB2A CA ( Table 1 , Figure 4 ). However, it may be difficult to determine the downstream genes of DREB2A accurately using only array and RNA gel blot analyses, as we used the strong constitutive CaMV 35S promoter to overexpress DREB2A CA. Therefore, we analyzed expression of these 21 upregulated genes under stress conditions and searched for the DRE core motif in their promoter region. Among these 21 upregulated genes in the 35S : DREB2A CA plants, 12 genes ( RD29B , At1g52690 , At1g69870 , and At3g53990 [ Figure 4B ]; RD29A , RD17 , LEA14 , and At2g23120 [ Figure 4C ]; and COR15A , KIN1 , KIN2 , and COR15B [ Figure 4D ]) were upregulated under drought stress, and their promoter regions carry the DRE core motif(s) ( Table 1 ). The other two genes, MT2A and At1g22985 ( Figure 4B ), were upregulated weakly under drought stress, and we found the DRE core motif(s) in their promoter regions ( Table 1 ).

These results suggest that these 14 genes are candidates for direct targets of DREB2A. Nine of these 14 genes encode LEA class proteins, which are thought to protect macromolecules, such as enzymes and lipids, from dehydration ( Table 1 ; Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 1999 ). Overproduction of these proteins probably improves drought stress tolerance in the transgenic plants.

Both DREB1A and DREB2A have been reported to recognize a core sequence of DRE, G/ACCGAC ( Liu et al., 1998 ; Sakuma et al., 2002 ). However, we revealed that some DREB2A downstream genes are not DREB1A downstream genes, and some DREB1A downstream genes are not DREB2A downstream genes ( Figures 4B and 4D ). Moreover, although some genes downstream of DREB1A, such as COR15A , COR15B , KIN1 , and KIN2 , are recognized by DREB2A also, their expression levels in the 35S : DREB2A CA plants were significantly lower than those in the 35S : DREB1A plants ( Figure 4D ). These differences in species or expression level of the downstream genes between the two DREB proteins may be a reason for the lower freezing tolerance of the 35S : DREB2A CA plants than that of the 35S : DREB1A plants. COR15A , COR15B , KIN1 , KIN2 , and two genes that are overexpressed only in the 35S : DREB1A-b plants, At2g02100 and COR414-TM1 , may play important roles in improving freezing stress tolerance of DREB1A overexpressors. Recently, we have elucidated that the DREB1A protein has the highest affinity to the A/GCCGACNT sequence by detailed analysis of the promoter region of the DREB1A downstream genes ( Maruyama et al., 2004 ). To understand why some of the genes downstream of DREB1A and DREB2A differ, we performed promoter analysis of the DREB1A- and DREB2A-upregulated genes and gel mobility shift assay with DNA fragments containing the DRE core sequence. We found that the DREB2A protein could recognize not only A/GCCGACNT, but also A/GCCGACNA/G/C, and prefers ACCGAC to GCCGAC. These different binding specificities between DREB1A and DREB2A may explain why these proteins control some different downstream genes.

Chimeric genes with sGFP fused to DREB2A FL or DREB2A CA were expressed in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Although only weak green fluorescence was observed in the nucleus of the 35S : GFP-DREB2A FL plants, strong signals were observed in the nucleus of the 35S : GFP-DREB2A CA plants ( Figure 8 ). Both full-length and active-form DREB2A proteins contain nuclear localization signals in their N-terminal regions ( Figure 2C , NLS); the DREB2A FL protein is probably also targeted at the nucleus. We suspected that the DREB2A FL protein is unstable in the transgenic plants compared with its constitutive active form. DREB2A CA does not contain the negative regulatory domain between amino acids 136 and 165 of DREB2A. Using the PESTfind program ( https://emb1.bcc.univie.ac.at/content/section/6/45/ ), we found a PEST sequence (RSDASEVTSTSSQSEVCTVETPGCV) in this region. The PEST sequence exists in rapid-turnover proteins and regulates the activity of proteins that require a rapid change of activity by controlling their accumulation ( Rechsteiner and Rogers, 1996 ). The DREB2A FL protein containing the PEST sequence may be degraded rapidly by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, whereas DREB2A CA may have a long lifetime in the nucleus.

Figure 9 shows a model of the induction of genes regulated by DREB1A and DREB2A under drought, high-salinity, and cold stress conditions. The DREB1A gene is induced by cold stress, and DREB2A is induced by drought and high-salinity stresses. Modification of the DREB2A protein may be necessary for its activation under drought and high-salinity stress conditions. The genes downstream of the DREB proteins are categorized into three groups. The first group consists of downstream genes shared by DREB1A and DREB2A; most of these have ACCGACNT in their promoter regions. The second group consists of DREB1A-specific downstream genes; these genes have A/GCCGACNT in their promoters. The third group consists of DREB2A-specific downstream genes; we found ACCGACNA/G/C frequently in their promoter regions. These different downstream genes between the DREB1A and DREB2A proteins result in different stress tolerance to cold and drought in plants.

In conclusion, the DREB2A protein has a negative regulatory domain in its central region, and the deletion of this domain transforms DREB2A into the constitutive active form. Overexpression of DREB2A CA activated the expression of many stress-inducible genes and improved tolerance to drought in transgenic Arabidopsis . We found that both DREB2A and DREB1A can bind to the DRE sequence, but the DNA binding specificities of each to the neighboring sequences of the DRE core motif were slightly different; therefore, the downstream genes of each are partially different. Green fluorescent signals of the sGFP fused to DREB2A CA were remarkably higher than those of the sGFP fused to the DREB2A FL in the nucleus of the transgenic plants under unstressed control conditions. Thus, these results suggest that stability of the DREB2A protein is important for its activation, and the activated DREB2A regulates drought stress–responsive gene expression, which enhances drought stress tolerance in plants.
