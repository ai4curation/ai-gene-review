Biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1) is a ubiquitously 
expressed multisubunit protein complex required for the normal biogenesis of 
specialized organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system, such as melanosomes 
and platelet dense granules. The complex is known to contain the 
coiled-coil-forming proteins, Pallidin, Muted, Cappuccino, and Dysbindin. The 
genes encoding these proteins are defective in inbred mouse strains that serve 
as models of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), a genetic disorder characterized 
by hypopigmentation and platelet storage pool deficiency. In addition, mutation 
of human Dysbindin causes HPS type 7. Here, we report the identification of 
another four subunits of the complex. One is Snapin, a coiled-coil-forming 
protein previously characterized as a binding partner of synaptosomal-associated 
proteins 25 and 23 and implicated in the regulation of membrane fusion events. 
The other three are previously uncharacterized proteins, which we named BLOC 
subunits 1, 2, and 3 (BLOS1, -2, and -3). Using specific antibodies to detect 
endogenous proteins from human and mouse cells, we found that Snapin, BLOS1, 
BLOS2, and BLOS3 co-immunoprecipitate, and co-fractionate upon size exclusion 
chromatography, with previously known BLOC-1 subunits. Furthermore, steady-state 
levels of the four proteins are significantly reduced in cells from pallid mice, 
which carry a mutation in Pallidin and display secondary loss of other BLOC-1 
subunits. Yeast two-hybrid analyses suggest a network of binary interactions 
involving all of the previously known and newly identified subunits. 
Interestingly, the HPS mouse model strain, reduced pigmentation, carries a 
nonsense mutation in the gene encoding BLOS3. As judged from size exclusion 
chromatographic analyses, the reduced pigmentation mutation affects BLOC-1 
assembly less severely than the pallid mutation. Mutations in the human genes 
encoding Snapin and the BLOS proteins could underlie novel forms of HPS.
