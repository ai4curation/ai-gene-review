Two populations of rat liver lysosomes can be distinguished on the basis of 
their density. A major difference between these populations is that one contains 
the heat shock cognate protein of 73 kDa (hsc73) within the lysosomal lumen. The 
lysosomal fraction containing hsc73 exhibits much higher efficiencies in the in 
vitro uptake and degradation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 
ribonuclease A, two well established substrates of the selective lysosomal 
pathway of intracellular protein degradation. Preloading of the lysosomal 
population that is devoid of lumenal hsc73 with hsc73 isolated from cytosol 
activated the selective transport of substrate proteins into these lysosomes. 
Furthermore, treatment of animals with leupeptin, an inhibitor of lysosomal 
cathepsins, or 88 h of starvation also increased the amount of hsc73 within 
their lysosomal lumen, and these in vivo treatments also activated the selective 
transport of substrate proteins in vitro. Thus, the hsc73 located within 
lysosomes appears to be required for efficient uptake of cytosolic proteins by 
these organelles. The difference in hsc73 content between the lysosomal 
populations appears to be due to differences in their ability to take up hsc73 
combined with differences in the intralysosomal degradation rates of hsc73. The 
increased stability of hsc73 in one population of lysosomes is primarily a 
consequence of this lysosomal population's more acidic pH.
