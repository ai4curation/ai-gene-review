The degradation of mRNA is an important regulatory step in the control of gene 
expression. However, mammalian RNA decay pathways remain poorly characterized. 
To provide a framework for studying mammalian RNA decay, a two-hybrid protein 
interaction map was generated using 54 constructs from 38 human proteins 
predicted to function in mRNA decay. The results provide evidence for 
interactions between many different proteins required for mRNA decay. Of 
particular interest are interactions between the poly(A) ribonuclease and the 
exosome and between the Lsm complex, decapping factors, and 5'-->3' 
exonucleases. Moreover, multiple interactions connect 5'-->3' and 3'-->5' decay 
proteins to each other and to nonsense-mediated decay factors, providing the 
opportunity for coordination between decay pathways. The interaction network 
also predicts the internal organization of the exosome and Lsm complexes. 
Additional interactions connect mRNA decay factors to many novel proteins and to 
proteins required for other steps in gene expression. These results provide an 
experimental insight into the organization of proteins required for mRNA decay 
and their coupling to other cellular processes, and the physiological relevance 
of many of these interactions are supported by their evolutionary conservation. 
The interactions also provide a wealth of hypotheses to guide future research on 
mRNA degradation and demonstrate the power of exhaustive protein interaction 
mapping in aiding understanding of uncharacterized protein complexes and 
pathways.
