TPPP/p25 (tubulin polymerization-promoting protein/p25) is an unstructured 
protein that induces microtubule polymerization in vitro and is aligned along 
the microtubule network in transfected mammalian cells. In normal human brain, 
TPPP/p25 is expressed predominantly in oligodendrocytes, where its expression is 
proved to be crucial for their differentiation process. Here we demonstrated 
that the expression of TPPP/p25 in HeLa cells, in doxycycline-inducible CHO10 
cells, and in the oligodendrocyte CG-4 cells promoted the acetylation of 
alpha-tubulin at residue Lys-40, whereas its down-regulation by specific small 
interfering RNA in CG-4 cells or by the withdrawal of doxycycline from CHO10 
cells decreased the acetylation level of alpha-tubulin. Our results indicate 
that TPPP/p25 binds to HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6), an enzyme responsible for 
tubulin deacetylation. Moreover, we demonstrated that the direct interaction of 
these two proteins resulted in the inhibition of the deacetylase activity of 
HDAC6. The measurement of HDAC6 activity showed that TPPP/p25 is able to induce 
almost complete (90%) inhibition at 3 microM concentration. In addition, 
treatment of the cells with nocodazole, vinblastine, or cold exposure revealed 
that microtubule acetylation induced by trichostatin A, a well known HDAC6 
inhibitor, does not cause microtubule stabilization. In contrast, the 
microtubule bundling activity of TPPP/p25 was able to protect the microtubules 
from depolymerization. Finally, we demonstrated that, similarly to other HDAC6 
inhibitors, TPPP/p25 influences the microtubule dynamics by decreasing the 
growth velocity of the microtubule plus ends and also affects cell motility as 
demonstrated by time lapse video experiments. Thus, we suggest that TPPP/p25 is 
a multiple effector of the microtubule organization.
