Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs) catalyze the thioesterification of 
long-chain FAs into their acyl-CoA derivatives. Purified ACSL4 is an arachidonic 
acid (20:4)-preferring ACSL isoform, and ACSL4 is therefore a probable regulator 
of lipid mediator production in intact cells. Eicosanoids play important roles 
in vascular homeostasis and disease, yet the role of ACSL4 in vascular cells is 
largely unknown. In the present study, the ACSL4 splice variant expressed in 
human arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) was identified as variant 1. To 
investigate the function of ACSL4 in SMCs, ACSL4 variant 1 was overexpressed, 
knocked-down by small interfering RNA, or its enzymatic activity acutely 
inhibited in these cells. Overexpression of ACSL4 resulted in a markedly 
increased synthesis of arachidonoyl-CoA, increased 20:4 incorporation into 
phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and triacylglycerol, and reduced 
cellular levels of unesterified 20:4. Accordingly, secretion of prostaglandin E₂ 
(PGE₂) was blunted in ACSL4-overexpressing SMCs compared with controls. 
Conversely, acute pharmacological inhibition of ACSL4 activity resulted in 
increased release of PGE₂. However, long-term downregulation of ACSL4 resulted 
in markedly reduced PGE₂ secretion. Thus, ACSL4 modulates PGE₂ release from 
human SMCs. ACSL4 may regulate a number of processes dependent on the release of 
arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediators in the arterial wall.
