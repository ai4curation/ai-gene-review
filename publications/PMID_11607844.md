Since Cas was first identified as a highly phosphorylated 130 kilodalton protein 
that associated with the v-Src and v-Crk-oncoproteins, considerable effort has 
been made to determine its function. Its predicted role as a scaffolding 
molecule based on its domain structure has been largely confirmed. Through its 
ability to undergo rapid changes in phosphorylation, subcellular localization 
and association with heterologous proteins, Cas may spatially and temporally 
regulate the function of its binding partners. Numerous proteins have been 
identified that bind to Cas in vitro and/or in vivo, but in only a few cases is 
there an understanding of how Cas may function in these protein complexes. To 
date, Cas-Crk and Cas-Src complexes have been most frequently implicated in Cas 
function, particularly in regards to processes involving regulation of the actin 
cytoskeleton and proliferation. These and other Cas protein complexes contribute 
to the critical role of Cas in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and 
survival of normal cycling cells. However, under conditions in which these 
processes are deregulated, Cas appears to play a role in oncogenic 
transformation and perhaps metastasis. Therefore, in its capacity as an adapter 
protein, Cas serves as a point of convergence for many distinct signaling 
inputs, ultimately contributing to the generation of specific cellular 
responses.
