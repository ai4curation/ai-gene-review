Atrophin-1-interacting protein 4 (AIP4) is the human homolog of the mouse Itch 
protein (hItch), an E3 ligase for Notch and JunB. Human enhancer of 
filamentation 1 (HEF1) has been implicated in signaling pathways such as those 
mediated by integrin, T cell receptor, and B cell receptor and functions as a 
multidomain docking protein. Recent studies suggest that HEF1 is also involved 
in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathways, by 
interacting with Smad3, a key signal transducer downstream of the TGF-beta type 
I receptor. The interaction of Smad3 with HEF1 induces HEF1 proteasomal 
degradation, which was further enhanced by TGF-beta stimulation. The detailed 
molecular mechanisms of HEF1 degradation regulated by Smad3 were poorly 
understood. Here we report our studies that demonstrate the function of AIP4 as 
an ubiquitin E3 ligase for HEF1. AIP4 forms a complex with both Smad3 and HEF1 
through its WW domains in a TGF-beta-independent manner and regulates HEF1 
ubiquitination and degradation, which can be enhanced by TGF-beta stimulation. 
These findings reveal a new mechanism for Smad3-regulated proteasomal 
degradation events and also broaden the network of cross-talk between the 
TGF-beta signaling pathway and those involving HEF1 and AIP4.
