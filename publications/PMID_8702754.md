Insulin and insulin-like growth factors belong to a family of polypeptides 
involved in essential physiological processes. Placentin, a new member of the 
insulin family, was recently identified as a 139-amino acid open reading frame 
from a cDNA clone isolated from a subtracted library of first trimester human 
placenta. Tris/Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot 
analyses of histidine-tagged recombinant placentin indicate that it is composed 
of two peptide chains of apparent molecular masses of 4 and 13 kDa. Conditioned 
media produced by recombinant expression of placentin cDNA in the placental 
3AsubE cell line were assayed for biological activity and found to stimulate 
tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA synthesis. While these effects closely mimicked 
those of insulin, they were not mediated by the insulin receptor as shown by the 
lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of this receptor upon placentin treatment. 
Moreover, in cytotrophoblast primary culture, production of chorionic 
gonadotropin, a marker of trophoblast differentiation, was increased upon 
treatment with placentin-conditioned media, while unaffected by insulin. These 
results suggest that placentin might participate in the cellular proliferation 
and/or differentiation processes during placental development.
