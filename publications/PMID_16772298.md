The enzymatic degradation of the plant cell wall is central both to the natural 
carbon cycle and, increasingly, to environmentally friendly routes to biomass 
conversion, including the production of biofuels. The plant cell wall is a 
complex composite of cellulose microfibrils embedded in diverse polysaccharides 
collectively termed hemicelluloses. Xyloglucan is one such polysaccharide whose 
hydrolysis is catalyzed by diverse xyloglucanases. Here we present the structure 
of the Clostridium thermocellum xyloglucanase Xgh74A in both apo and 
ligand-complexed forms. The structures, in combination with mutagenesis data on 
the catalytic residues and the kinetics and specificity of xyloglucan hydrolysis 
reveal a complex subsite specificity accommodating seventeen monosaccharide 
moieties of the multibranched substrate in an open substrate binding terrain.
