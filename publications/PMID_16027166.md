Transmembrane proteins BRI2 and amyloid precursor protein (APP) co-localize with 
amyloid beta (Abeta) lesions in sporadic Alzheimer disease and mutations in both 
precursor proteins are linked to early-onset familial cases of cerebral 
amyloidosis associated with dementia and/or cerebral hemorrhage. A specific 
interaction between BRI2 and APP was unveiled by immunoprecipitation experiments 
using transfected and non-transfected cells. The use of deletion mutants further 
revealed that stretches 648-719 of APP751 and 46-106 of BRI2, both inclusive of 
the full transmembrane domains, are sufficient for the interaction. Removal of 
most of the APP and BRI2 extracellular domains without affecting the interaction 
implies that both proteins interact when are expressed on the same cell membrane 
(cis) rather than on adjacent cells (trans). The presence of BRI2 had a 
modulatory effect on APP processing, specifically increasing the levels of 
cellular APP as well as beta-secretase-generated COOH-terminal fragments while 
decreasing the levels of alpha-secretase-generated COOH-terminal fragments as 
well as the secretion of total APP and Abeta peptides. Determining the precise 
molecular pathways affected by the specific binding between APP and BRI2 could 
result in the identification of common therapeutic targets for these sporadic 
and familial neurodegenerative disorders.
