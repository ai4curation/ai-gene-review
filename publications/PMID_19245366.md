for the asparaginyl hydroxylase factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 
(FIH).

The asparaginyl hydroxylase FIH [factor inhibiting HIF (hypoxia-inducible 
factor)] was first identified as a protein that inhibits transcriptional 
activation by HIF, through hydroxylation of an asparagine residue in the CAD 
(C-terminal activation domain). More recently, several ARD [AR (ankyrin repeat) 
domain]-containing proteins were identified as FIH substrates using FIH 
interaction assays. Although the function(s) of these ARD hydroxylations is 
unclear, expression of the ARD protein Notch1 was shown to compete efficiently 
with HIF CAD for asparagine hydroxylation and thus to enhance HIF activity. The 
ARD is a common protein domain with over 300 examples in the human proteome. 
However, the extent of hydroxylation among ARD proteins, and the ability of 
other members to compete with HIF-CAD for FIH, is not known. In the present 
study we assay for asparagine hydroxylation in a bioinformatically predicted FIH 
substrate, the targeting subunit of myosin phosphatase, MYPT1. Our results 
confirm hydroxylation both in cultured cells and in endogenous protein purified 
from animal tissue. We show that the extent of hydroxylation at three sites is 
dependent on FIH expression level and that hydroxylation is incomplete under 
basal conditions even in the animal tissue. We also show that expression of 
MYPT1 enhances HIF-CAD activity in a manner consistent with competition for FIH 
and that this property extends to other ARD proteins. These results extend the 
range of FIH substrates and suggest that cross-competition between ARDs and 
HIF-CAD, and between ARDs themselves, may be extensive and have important 
effects on hypoxia signalling.
