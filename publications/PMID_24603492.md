The RabGAP protein TBC1D5 controls cellular endomembrane trafficking processes 
and binds the retromer subunit VPS29 and the ubiquitin-like protein ATG8 (LC3). 
Here, we describe that TBC1D5 also associates with ATG9 and the active ULK1 
complex during autophagy. Moreover, ATG9 and TBC1D5 interact with clathrin and 
the AP2 complex. Depletion of TBC1D5 leads to missorting of ATG9 to late 
endosomes upon activation of autophagy, whereas inhibition of clathrin-mediated 
endocytosis or AP2 depletion alters ATG9 trafficking and its association with 
TBC1D5. Taken together, our data show that TBC1D5 and the AP2 complex are 
important novel regulators of the rerouting of ATG9-containing vesicular 
carriers toward sites of autophagosome formation.
