Physical, genetic, and chemical-genetic interactions centered on the conserved 
chaperone Hsp90 were mapped at high resolution in yeast using systematic 
proteomic and genomic methods. Physical interactions were identified using 
genome-wide two hybrid screens combined with large-scale affinity purification 
of Hsp90-containing protein complexes. Genetic interactions were uncovered using 
synthetic genetic array technology and by a microarray-based chemical-genetic 
screen of a set of about 4700 viable yeast gene deletion mutants for 
hypersensitivity to the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. An extended network, 
consisting of 198 putative physical interactions and 451 putative genetic and 
chemical-genetic interactions, was found to connect Hsp90 to cofactors and 
substrates involved in a wide range of cellular functions. Two novel Hsp90 
cofactors, Tah1 (YCR060W) and Pih1 (YHR034C), were also identified. These 
cofactors interact physically and functionally with the conserved AAA(+)-type 
DNA helicases Rvb1/Rvb2, which are key components of several chromatin 
remodeling factors, thereby linking Hsp90 to epigenetic gene regulation.
