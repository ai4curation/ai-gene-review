p53 is a frequent target for mutation in human tumors, and mutant p53 proteins 
can actively contribute to tumorigenesis. We employed a three-dimensional 
culture model in which nonmalignant breast epithelial cells form spheroids 
reminiscent of acinar structures found in vivo, whereas breast cancer cells 
display highly disorganized morphology. We found that mutant p53 depletion is 
sufficient to phenotypically revert breast cancer cells to a more acinar-like 
morphology. Genome-wide expression analysis identified the mevalonate pathway as 
significantly upregulated by mutant p53. Statins and sterol biosynthesis 
intermediates reveal that this pathway is both necessary and sufficient for the 
phenotypic effects of mutant p53 on breast tissue architecture. Mutant p53 
associates with sterol gene promoters at least partly via SREBP transcription 
factors. Finally, p53 mutation correlates with highly expressed sterol 
biosynthesis genes in human breast tumors. These findings implicate the 
mevalonate pathway as a therapeutic target for tumors bearing mutations in p53.

INTRODUCTION

The TP53 gene, which encodes the p53 protein, is the most frequent target for mutation in tumors, with over half of all human cancers exhibiting mutation at this locus ( Vogelstein et al., 2000 ). Wild-type p53 functions primarily as a transcription factor and possesses an N-terminal transactivation domain, a centrally located sequence specific DNA binding domain, followed by a tetramerization domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain ( Laptenko and Prives, 2006 ).

Unlike most tumor suppressor genes, which are predominantly inactivated as a result of deletion or truncation, the majority of mutations in TP53 are missense mutations, a few of which cluster at “hotspot” residues in the DNA binding core domain ( Petitjean et al., 2007 ). In contrast to wild-type p53, which under unstressed conditions is a very short-lived protein, these missense mutations lead to the accumulation of full-length p53 protein with a prolonged half-life ( Brosh and Rotter, 2009 ). While many tumor-derived mutant forms of p53 can exert a dominant-negative effect on the remaining wild-type allele, the end result in many forms of human cancer is frequently loss of heterozygosity, where only the mutant form is retained, suggesting that there is a selective advantage conferred by losing the remaining wild-type p53, even after one allele has been mutated ( Brosh and Rotter, 2009 ).

Mutant forms of p53 can exert oncogenic, or gain-of-function, activities independent of their effects on wild-type p53. In vivo knock-in mice harboring two tumor-derived mutants of p53 (equivalent to R175H and R273H in humans) display an altered tumor spectrum as well as more metastatic tumors when compared to p53 null mice ( Lang et al., 2004 ; Olive et al., 2004 ). The mutational status of p53 has been shown to predict poor outcomes in multiple types of human tumors, including breast cancer, and certain p53 mutants associate with an even worse prognosis ( Olivier et al., 2006 ; Petitjean et al., 2007 ). Mutant p53 expression correlates with increased survival, invasion, migration and metastasis in preclinical breast cancer models ( Adorno et al., 2009 ; Muller et al., 2009 ; Stambolsky et al., 2010 ). Nonetheless, mutant p53-induced phenotypic alterations in mammary tissue architecture have not been fully explored.

Breast cancer is thought to arise from mammary epithelial cells found in structures referred to as acini, which collectively form terminal ductal lobular units. Each acinus consists of a single layer of polarized luminal epithelial cells surrounding a hollow lumen ( Bissell et al., 2002 ). While traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture has provided insight into the process of breast carcinogenesis, such in vitro culture conditions differ from the microenvironment that a cell would experience in vivo ( Bissell et al., 2002 ). By contrast, a laminin-rich extracellular matrix allows normal mammary epithelial cells to form three-dimensional structures reminiscent of acinar structures found in vivo ( Petersen et al., 1992 ). Since one of the hallmarks of breast tumorigenesis is the disruption of mammary tissue architecture, three-dimensional (3D) culture conditions allow one to readily distinguish normal and tumorigenic tissue by morphological phenotype ( Petersen et al., 1992 ). In addition, inhibition of key oncogenic signaling pathways is sufficient to phenotypically revert breast cancer cells grown in 3D culture ( Bissell et al., 2005 ). Here we implicate mutant p53 and the mevalonate pathway in the disruption of acinar morphology and our data have also revealed a potential mechanism by which mutant p53 increases expression of the genes in the mevalonate pathway.

DISCUSSION

Despite being one of the most well studied tumor suppressors, there is much evidence that once mutated, p53 can actively promote the progression of many cancers. With respect to breast cancer, tumor-derived mutants of p53 have been implicated in survival, chemoresistance, invasion, migration and metastasis ( Brosh and Rotter, 2009 ). Since mammary tissue architecture is invariably disrupted during breast carcinogenesis, we sought to delineate the phenotypic effects of mutant p53 in breast cancer. This study describes a possible oncogenic role for certain missense mutants of p53 in disrupting acinar morphogenesis of breast cells, explored using a 3D culture system. In addition, we show that mutant p53 elevates expression of many mevalonate pathway genes and flux through the mevalonate pathway is both necessary and sufficient for the phenotypic effects of mutant p53 on breast cancer cell morphology in 3D culture.

The mevalonate pathway has recently been implicated in multiple aspects of tumorigenesis, including proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis ( Clendening et al., 2010 ; Kidera et al., 2010 ; Koyuturk et al., 2007 ). Competitive inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, HMG-CoA reductase, collectively known as statins, have been reported to be cancer-protective for certain malignancies, including breast cancer ( Ahern et al., 2011 ; Blais et al., 2000 ; Cauley et al., 2003 ). Yet the cancer-protective effects of statins are not without debate ( Baigent et al., 2005 ; Browning and Martin, 2007 ). Statins have already been employed in multiple preclinical models of breast cancer ( Kubatka et al., 2011 ; Shibata et al., 2004 ). In line with this, we were also able to confirm a significant impact of Simvastatin treatment on MDA-231 breast cancer cells in vivo .

It is interesting to note that at least one clinical study investigating the effect of statins in breast cancer noted a subgroup-specific protective effect: specifically, a significantly decreased incidence of hormone receptor-negative (ER−/PR−) tumors was documented in patients takings statins, while no such effect was observed for hormone receptor-positive tumors ( Kumar et al., 2008 ). Preclinical models, employing either breast cancer cell lines or mouse models of breast cancer, also support a more dramatic role for statins in ER−/PR− breast cancers ( Campbell et al., 2006 ; Garwood et al., 2010 ). Since the majority of breast tumors that bear p53 mutations most commonly are also immunohistochemically classified as ER−/PR− ( Sorlie et al., 2001 ), it is tempting to speculate that the observed anti-tumorigenic effects of statins are a consequence of mutant p53’s upregulation of the mevalonate pathway.

Gene expression profiling of breast cancers has identified specific subtypes with important clinical, biologic and therapeutic implications ( Perou et al., 2000 ). Using these expression signatures, most p53 mutations cluster in the basal-like subgroup of breast cancers, which has the poorest prognosis and is notoriously difficult to treat ( Sorlie et al., 2001 ). Fascinatingly, using a combination of expression signatures and data from over 40,000 compounds screened in the NCI-60 cell lines, three FDA-approved drugs were predicted to be most effective for treating basal-like breast cancers, two of which, Simvastatin and Lovastatin, are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase ( Mori et al., 2009 ). It will be exciting to examine whether stratifying breast cancer patients based on their p53 mutational status can resolve the apparent discrepancies within the rich body of literature linking statins and cancer.

Although we have implicated the mevalonate pathway in the phenotypic effects of mutant p53, it will be of great interest to further delineate the metabolite(s) as well as the downstream signaling pathways that are responsible for these phenotypic effects. While we have demonstrated that metabolic flux through the mevalonate pathway is necessary to maintain the malignant state, with a specific reliance on geranylgeranylation, we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more other metabolites are involved in the phenotypic effects that we observe in 3D culture. If geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate is in fact the key metabolite, it will be very interesting to delineate the geranylgeranylated protein target(s) that mediate the oncogenic effects of the mevalonate pathway in breast cancer cells in 3D culture.

It is interesting to note that, in addition to the mevalonate pathway, a number of fatty acid biosynthesis genes were also significantly affected by mutant p53 depletion from breast cancer cells in 3D culture ( Figure 3B and S6E ). Intriguingly, this is the other major pathway controlled by the SREBP family of transcription factors ( Horton et al., 2002 ). While much of our data points to a role for SREBP proteins in the regulation of the mevalonate pathway by mutant p53, a direct link is yet to be established. This regulation is likely to occur through one or more of the SREBP proteins, but we cannot rule out the possibility that another factor or factors may also be involved. Mutant p53 may interact directly with elements in the promoters of the sterol biosynthesis genes or alternatively be recruited by a known mutant p53 interacting partner such as NF-Y, SP1, Ets-1 or VDR, which have been shown to recruit mutant p53 to their cognate binding sites ( Brosh and Rotter, 2009 ; Stambolsky et al., 2010 ).

A number of scenarios have been proposed to explain why human tumors select for mutations in p53. First, mutant p53 may simply be selected for due to loss of wild-type p53 tumor suppressive activity. Second, mutant p53 may acquire neomorphic (i.e. novel gain-of-function) activities which promote tumor growth, many of which have actually been shown to be diametrically opposed to those performed by wild-type p53 ( Peart and Prives, 2006 ; Stambolsky et al., 2010 ). In line with this hypothesis are the findings that Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (encoded by SCD ) is a repression target of wild-type p53 ( Mirza et al., 2003 ) and that wild-type p53 can suppress a subset of SREBP target genes in a mouse model of obesity ( Yahagi et al., 2003 ). As the pro-survival roles of wild-type p53 are becoming more apparent ( Kim et al., 2009 ), a third scenario can be envisaged in which mutant p53 may retain and exaggerate certain wild-type p53 functions, while selectively losing certain tumor suppressive mechanisms such as the ability to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Regarding the latter two hypotheses, it will be interesting for future studies to examine whether wild-type p53 and/or its family members (p63 and p73) serve to repress sterol biosynthesis genes. Alternatively, the maintenance of high levels of sterol biosynthesis genes by mutant p53 may be a remnant of an unrecognized wild-type p53 function.

These speculations raise another important consideration, that not all p53 mutations are equivalent. Genetic alterations in p53 are often grouped into two classes based on the type of mutant p53 that they produce. Contact mutants, exemplified by p53-R273H, involve mutation of residues that are directly involved in protein-DNA contacts. Conformational mutants, typified by p53-R175H, result in structural distortions in the p53 protein. Our findings that a subset of the sterol biosynthesis genes are significantly higher in large cohorts of human breast tumors bearing mutant p53 suggests that the ability of mutant p53 to upregulate the sterol biosynthesis genes is not constrained to a single class of mutations; however, it will be very interesting for follow-up studies to examine which tumor-derived mutants of p53 can regulate the levels of sterol biosynthesis genes.

In summary, our results demonstrate that mutant p53 can disrupt mammary acinar morphology and that downregulation of mutant p53 from malignant cells is sufficient to phenotypically revert these cells. Here we propose one mechanism, the upregulation of the mevalonate pathway, although one or more additional pathways may play a role. Specifically, we demonstrate that mutant p53 is recruited to the promoters of many sterol biosynthesis genes leading to their upregulation. We hypothesize that tumors bearing p53 mutations evolve to become highly reliant on metabolic flux through the mevalonate pathway, making them particularly sensitive to inhibition of this pathway. At a clinical level, inhibition of the mevalonate pathway, either alone or in combination with other therapies, may offer a novel, and much needed, therapeutic option for tumors bearing mutant p53.
