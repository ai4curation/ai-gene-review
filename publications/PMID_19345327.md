NF-kappaB (RelA) is constitutively active in many cancers, where it upregulates 
antiapoptotic and other oncogenic genes. While proinflammatory stimulus-induced 
NF-kappaB activation involves IKK-dependent nuclear translocation, mechanisms 
for maintaining constitutive NF-kappaB activity in tumors have not been 
elucidated. We show here that maintenance of NF-kappaB activity in tumors 
requires Stat3, which is also frequently constitutively activated in cancer. 
Stat3 prolongs NF-kappaB nuclear retention through acetyltransferase 
p300-mediated RelA acetylation, thereby interfering with NF-kappaB nuclear 
export. Stat3-mediated maintenance of NF-kappaB activity occurs in both cancer 
cells and tumor-associated hematopoietic cells. Both murine and human cancers 
display highly acetylated RelA, which is associated with Stat3 activity. This 
Stat3/NF-kappaB interaction is thus central to both the transformed and 
nontransformed elements in tumors.
