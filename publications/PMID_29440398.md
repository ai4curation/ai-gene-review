The ATP synthase in human mitochondria is a membrane-bound assembly of 29 
proteins of 18 kinds. All but two membrane components are encoded in nuclear 
genes, synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes, and imported into the matrix of the 
organelle, where they are assembled into the complex with ATP6 and ATP8, the 
products of overlapping genes in mitochondrial DNA. Disruption of individual 
human genes for the nuclear-encoded subunits in the membrane portion of the 
enzyme leads to the formation of intermediate vestigial ATPase complexes that 
provide a description of the pathway of assembly of the membrane domain. The key 
intermediate complex consists of the F1-c8 complex inhibited by the ATPase 
inhibitor protein IF1 and attached to the peripheral stalk, with subunits e, f, 
and g associated with the membrane domain of the peripheral stalk. This 
intermediate provides the template for insertion of ATP6 and ATP8, which are 
synthesized on mitochondrial ribosomes. Their association with the complex is 
stabilized by addition of the 6.8 proteolipid, and the complex is coupled to ATP 
synthesis at this point. A structure of the dimeric yeast Fo membrane domain is 
consistent with this model of assembly. The human 6.8 proteolipid (yeast j 
subunit) locks ATP6 and ATP8 into the membrane assembly, and the monomeric 
complexes then dimerize via interactions between ATP6 subunits and between 6.8 
proteolipids (j subunits). The dimers are linked together back-to-face by DAPIT 
(diabetes-associated protein in insulin-sensitive tissue; yeast subunit k), 
forming long oligomers along the edges of the cristae.
