Data from the Arabidopsis genome project suggest that more than 5% of the genes 
of this plant encode transcription factors. The necessity for the use of genomic 
analytical approaches becomes clear when it is considered that less than 10% of 
these factors have been genetically characterized. A variety of tools for 
functional genomic analyses in plants have been developed over the past few 
years. The availability of the full complement of Arabidopsis transcription 
factors, together with the results of recent studies that illustrate some of the 
challenges to their functional characterization, now provides the basic 
framework for future analyses of transcriptional regulation in plants.
