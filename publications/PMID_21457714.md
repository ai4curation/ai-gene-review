The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ras2p has been suggested to be a target in the 
feedback regulation of Ras-cAMP pathway. This work proves that the Ras2p 
localization is regulated by PKA activity, and that PKA down-regulates Ras2p 
activity and the protein association between Cdc25p and Ras2-GTP, which is due 
to a reduced Ras2-GEF Cdc25p activity. These results suggest that Ras2p 
localization and Ras2-GEF activity of Cdc25p play roles in the feedback 
regulation of Ras2p in the Ras-cAMP pathway.
