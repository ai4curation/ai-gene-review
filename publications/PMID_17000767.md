Nascent ribosome biogenesis is required during cell growth. To gain insight into 
the importance of this process during mouse oogenesis and embryonic development, 
we deleted one allele of the ribosomal protein S6 gene in growing oocytes and 
generated S6-heterozygous embryos. Oogenesis and embryonic development until 
embryonic day 5.5 (E5.5) were normal. However, inhibition of entry into M phase 
of the cell cycle and apoptosis became evident post-E5.5 and led to 
perigastrulation lethality. Genetic inactivation of p53 bypassed this checkpoint 
and prolonged development until E12.5, when the embryos died, showing decreased 
expression of D-type cyclins, diminished fetal liver erythropoiesis, and 
placental defects. Thus, a p53-dependent checkpoint is activated during 
gastrulation in response to ribosome insufficiency to prevent improper execution 
of the developmental program.
