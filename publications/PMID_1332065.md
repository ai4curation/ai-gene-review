Wilms tumor, an embryonic kidney malignancy, accounts for approximately 6% of 
all pediatric neoplasms. A gene implicated in the genesis of this tumor, the 
Wilms tumor suppressor gene (WT1), encodes a zinc-finger DNA-binding protein 
(WT1) that functions as a transcriptional repressor. In certain Wilms tumors, 
the platelet-derived growth factor A chain (PDGF-A) is overexpressed; it has 
therefore been suggested that it may play an autocrine role in development of 
these neoplasms. Since the PDGF-A promoter contains putative binding sites for 
WT1, we explored the role of WT1 in regulating A-chain expression. The major 
PDGF-A promoter activity was localized in transient transfection assays to a 
region spanning from -643 to + 8 relative to the transcription start site. WT1 
bound to several sites in this region of the promoter, as demonstrated by 
gel-shift analysis and DNase I footprinting, and functioned as a powerful 
repressor of PDGF-A transcription in vivo. Maximal repression (> 50-fold) of the 
PDGF-A promoter was dependent on the presence of multiple WT1 binding sites in 
transient transfection assays. Our observations suggest a mechanism for normal 
downregulation of a growth factor gene and of an autocrine growth process of 
import in kidney development and other biological systems.
