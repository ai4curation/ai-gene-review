Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is a member of the sirtuin family of proteins that promote 
longevity in many organisms. Increased expression of SIRT3 has been linked to an 
extended life span in humans. Here, we have shown that Sirt3 protects the mouse 
heart by blocking the cardiac hypertrophic response. Although Sirt3-deficient 
mice appeared to have normal activity, they showed signs of cardiac hypertrophy 
and interstitial fibrosis at 8 weeks of age. Application of hypertrophic stimuli 
to these mice produced a severe cardiac hypertrophic response, whereas 
Sirt3-expressing Tg mice were protected from similar stimuli. In primary 
cultures of cardiomyocytes, Sirt3 blocked cardiac hypertrophy by activating the 
forkhead box O3a-dependent (Foxo3a-dependent), antioxidant-encoding genes 
manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and catalase (Cat), thereby decreasing 
cellular levels of ROS. Reduced ROS levels suppressed Ras activation and 
downstream signaling through the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. This resulted 
in repressed activity of transcription factors, specifically GATA4 and NFAT, and 
translation factors, specifically eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (elf4E) and S6 
ribosomal protein (S6P), which are involved in the development of cardiac 
hypertrophy. These results demonstrate that SIRT3 is an endogenous negative 
regulator of cardiac hypertrophy, which protects hearts by suppressing cellular 
levels of ROS.
