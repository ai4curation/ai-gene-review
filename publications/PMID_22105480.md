In mammals, the inheritance of mitochondrion and its DNA (mtDNA) is strictly 
maternal, despite the fact that a sperm can inject up to 100 functional 
mitochondria into the oocyte during fertilization. The mechanisms responsible 
for the elimination of the paternal mitochondria remain largely unknown. We 
report here that this paternal mitochondrial elimination process is conserved in 
Caenorhabditis elegans, and that the lysosomal pathway actively participates in 
this process. Molecular and cell biological analyses indicate that in wild-type 
animals paternal mitochondria and mtDNA are destroyed within two hours after 
fertilization. In animals with compromised lysosomes, paternal mitochondria 
persist until late embryonic stages. Therefore, the lysosomal pathway plays an 
important role in degrading paternal mitochondria introduced into the oocyte 
during fertilization. Our study indicates that C. elegans is an excellent animal 
model for understanding and dissecting this conserved biological process 
critical for animal development and reproduction.
