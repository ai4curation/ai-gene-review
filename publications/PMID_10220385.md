Gene expression is in part controlled by chromatin remodeling factors and the 
acetylation state of nucleosomal histones. The latter process is regulated by 
histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Previously, three 
human and five yeast HDAC enzymes had been identified. These can be categorized 
into two classes: the first class represented by yeast Rpd3-like proteins and 
the second by yeast Hda1-like proteins. Human HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 proteins 
are members of the first class, whereas no class II human HDAC proteins had been 
identified. The amino acid sequence of Hda1p was used to search the 
GenBank/expressed sequence tag databases to identify partial sequences from 
three putative class II human HDAC proteins. The corresponding full-length cDNAs 
were cloned and defined as HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC6. These proteins possess 
certain features present in the conserved catalytic domains of class I human 
HDACs, but also contain additional sequence domains. Interestingly, HDAC6 
contains an internal duplication of two catalytic domains, which appear to 
function independently of each other. These class II HDAC proteins have 
differential mRNA expression in human tissues and possess in vitro HDAC activity 
that is inhibited by trichostatin A. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate 
that these HDAC proteins are not components of the previously identified HDAC1 
and HDAC2 NRD and mSin3A complexes. However, HDAC4 and HDAC5 associate with 
HDAC3 in vivo. This finding suggests that the human class II HDAC enzymes may 
function in cellular processes distinct from those of HDAC1 and HDAC2.
