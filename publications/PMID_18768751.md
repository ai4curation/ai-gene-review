The mammalian DOCK180 protein belongs to an evolutionarily conserved protein 
family, which together with ELMO proteins, is essential for activation of Rac 
GTPase-dependent biological processes. Here, we have analyzed the DOCK180-ELMO1 
interaction, and map direct interaction interfaces to the N-terminal 200 amino 
acids of DOCK180, and to the C-terminal 200 amino acids of ELMO1, comprising the 
ELMO1 PH domain. Structural and biochemical analysis of this PH domain reveals 
that it is incapable of phospholipid binding, but instead structurally resembles 
FERM domains. Moreover, the structure revealed an N-terminal amphiphatic 
alpha-helix, and point mutants of invariant hydrophobic residues in this helix 
disrupt ELMO1-DOCK180 complex formation. A secondary interaction between ELMO1 
and DOCK180 is conferred by the DOCK180 SH3 domain and proline-rich motifs at 
the ELMO1 C-terminus. Mutation of both DOCK180-interaction sites on ELMO1 is 
required to disrupt the DOCK180-ELMO1 complex. Significantly, although this does 
not affect DOCK180 GEF activity toward Rac in vivo, Rac signaling is impaired, 
implying additional roles for ELMO in mediating intracellular Rac signaling.
