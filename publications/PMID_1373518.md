Lymphocytes must proliferate and differentiate in response to low concentrations 
of a vast array of antigens. The requirements of broad specificity and 
sensitivity conflict because the former is met by low-affinity antigen 
receptors, which precludes achieving the latter with high-affinity receptors. 
Coligation of the membrane protein CD19 with the antigen receptor of B 
lymphocytes decreased the threshold for antigen receptor-dependent stimulation 
by two orders of magnitude. B lymphocytes proliferated when approximately 100 
antigen receptors per cell, 0.03 percent of the total, were coligated with CD19. 
The B cell resolves its dilemma by having an accessory protein that enables 
activation when few antigen receptors are occupied.
