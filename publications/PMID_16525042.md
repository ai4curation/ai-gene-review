Ca2+ channel beta subunits regulate cell-surface expression and gating of 
voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel alpha1 subunits. Based on primary sequence 
comparisons, beta subunits are predicted to be modular structures composed of 
five domains (A-E) that are related to the large family of membrane-associated 
guanylate kinase proteins. The crystal structure of the beta subunit core B-D 
domains has been reported recently; however, little is known about the 
structures of the A and E domains. The N-terminal A domain differs among the 
four subtypes of Ca2+ channel beta subunits (beta1-beta4) primarily as the 
result of two duplications of an ancestral gene containing multiple 
alternatively spliced exons. At least nine A domain sequences can be generated 
by alternative splicing. In this report, we focus on one A domain sequence, the 
highly conserved beta4a A domain. We solved its three-dimensional structure and 
show that it is expressed in punctate structures throughout the molecular layer 
of the cerebellar cortex. We also demonstrate that it does not participate 
directly in Cav2.1 Ca2+ channel gating but serves as a binding site in 
protein-protein interactions with synaptotagmin I and the LC2 domain of 
microtubule-associated protein 1A. With respect to beta4 subunits, the 
interactions are specific for the beta4a splice variant, because they do not 
occur with the beta4b A domain. These results have strong bearing on our current 
understanding of the structure of alternatively spliced Ca2+ channel beta 
subunits and the cell-specific roles they play in the CNS.
