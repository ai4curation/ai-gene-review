Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) eliminates mRNAs containing a premature 
translation termination codon through the recruitment of the conserved NMD 
factors UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3. In humans, a dynamic assembly pathway allows UPF1 
to join UPF2 and UPF3 recruited to the mRNA by the exon-junction complex (EJC). 
Here we show that the recombinant EJC core is sufficient to reconstitute, with 
the three UPF proteins, a stable heptameric complex on RNA. The EJC proteins 
MAGOH, Y14 and eIF4AIII provide a composite binding site for UPF3b that serves 
as a bridge to UPF2 and UPF1. In the UPF trimeric complex, UPF2 and UPF3b 
cooperatively stimulate both ATPase and RNA helicase activities of UPF1. This 
work demonstrates that the EJC core is sufficient to stably anchor the UPF 
proteins to mRNA and provides insights into the regulation of its central 
effector, UPF1.
