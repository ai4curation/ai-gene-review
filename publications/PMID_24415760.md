TRF1, a telomere-binding protein, is important for telomere protection and 
homeostasis. PinX1 interacts with TRF1, but the physiological consequences of 
their interaction in telomere protection are not yet understood. Here we 
investigated PinX1 function on TRF1 stability in HeLa cells. PinX1 
overexpression stabilized TRF1, but PinX1 depletion by siRNA led to TRF1 
degradation, TRF1 ubiquitination, and less TRF1 telomere association. The 
depletion also induced DNA damage responses at telomeres and chromosome 
instability. These telomere dysfunctional phenotypes were in fact due to TRF1 
deficiency. We also report that hTERT, a catalytic component of telomerase, 
plays dual roles in the TRF1 steady state pathway. PinX1-mediated TRF1 stability 
was not observed in hTERT-negative immortal cells, but was pronounced when hTERT 
was ectopically expressed in the cells, suggesting that hTERT may be needed in 
the PinX1-mediated TRF1 stability pathway. Interestingly, the knockdown of both 
PinX1 and hTERT in HeLa cells stabilized TRF1, suppressed DNA damage response 
activation, and restored chromosome stability. In summary, our findings 
suggested that PinX1 may maintain telomere integrity by regulating TRF1 
stability and that hTERT may act as both a positive and a negative regulator of 
TRF1 homeostasis in a PinX1-dependent manner.
