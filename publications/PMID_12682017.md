Transcription in eukaryotes is influenced by the chromatin state of the 
template, and chromatin remodeling factors have well-documented roles in 
regulating transcription initiation by RNA polymerase (pol) II. Chromatin also 
influences transcription elongation; however, little is known about the role of 
chromatin remodeling factors in this process. Here, we present evidence that the 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromatin remodeling factor Chd1 functions during 
transcription elongation. First, we identified Chd1 in a two-hybrid screen for 
proteins that interact with Rtf1, a member of the Paf1 complex that associates 
with RNA pol II and regulates transcription elongation. Secondly, we show 
through co-immunoprecipitation studies that Chd1 also interacts with components 
of two essential elongation factors, Spt4-Spt5 and Spt16-Pob3. Thirdly, we 
demonstrate that deletion of CHD1 suppresses a cold-sensitive spt5 mutation that 
is also suppressed by defects in the Paf1 complex and RNA pol II. Finally, we 
demonstrate that Chd1, Rtf1 and Spt5 associate with actively transcribed regions 
of chromatin. Collectively, these findings suggest an important role for Chd1 
and chromatin remodeling in the control of transcription elongation.
