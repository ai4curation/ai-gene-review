A novel protein, RTN-XS, interacts with both Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 on endoplasmic 
reticulum and reduces their anti-apoptotic activity.

Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL serve as critical inhibitors of apoptosis triggered by a broad 
range of stimuli, mainly acting on the mitochondria. We identified two members 
of the reticulon (RTN) family as Bcl-XL binding proteins, i.e., NSP-C (RTN1-C) 
and a new family member, RTN-XS, both of which did not belong to the Bcl-2 
family and were predominantly localized on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 
RTN-XS interacted with both Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, increased the localization of 
Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 on the ER, and reduced the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-XL 
and Bcl-2. On the other hand, NSP-C interacted only with Bcl-XL, affected the 
localization of Bcl-XL, and reduced Bcl-XL activity, but had no effect on Bcl-2. 
These results suggest that RTN family proteins can modulate the anti-apoptotic 
activity of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 by binding with them and can change their 
localization to the ER.
