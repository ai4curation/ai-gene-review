Mammalian CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) are generally known as 
regulators in adipocyte differentiation. However, more understanding of the role 
of C/EBPs in lipid and glucose metabolism remains to be discovered. In this 
study, we verified the effect of CEBP-2, the homolog of CEBPs, on fat storage in 
Caenorhabditis elegans. Expressions of 85 genes that encode the major enzymes in 
energy metabolic pathways were then screened in cebp-2-deficient worms using a 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Our data implied 
that loss of function of CEBP-2 displayed a low-fat phenotype in C. elegans 
owing to increased expression of ech-1.1 and decreased expression of fat-5. Our 
findings indicated that cebp-2 controls total body fat content by governing 
fatty acid mitochondrial β-oxidation and desaturation in C. elegans. These data 
provide insights into how C/EBPs may affect lipid metabolism in mammals in 
addition to regulating adipocyte differentiation.
