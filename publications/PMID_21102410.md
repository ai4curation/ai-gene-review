Star-PAP is a poly (A) polymerase (PAP) that is putatively required for 3'-end 
cleavage and polyadenylation of a select set of pre-messenger RNAs (mRNAs), 
including heme oxygenase (HO-1) mRNA. To investigate the underlying mechanism, 
the cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNA was reconstituted with nuclear 
lysates. siRNA knockdown of Star-PAP abolished cleavage of HO-1, and this 
phenotype could be rescued by recombinant Star-PAP but not PAPα. Star-PAP 
directly associated with cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) 
160 and 73 subunits and also the targeted pre-mRNA. In vitro and in vivo 
Star-PAP was required for the stable association of CPSF complex to pre-mRNA and 
then CPSF 73 specifically cleaved the mRNA at the 3'-cleavage site. This 
mechanism is distinct from canonical PAPα, which is recruited to the cleavage 
complex by interacting with CPSF 160. The data support a model where Star-PAP 
binds to the RNA, recruits the CPSF complex to the 3'-end of pre-mRNA and then 
defines cleavage by CPSF 73 and subsequent polyadenylation of its target mRNAs.
