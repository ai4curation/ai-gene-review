MTJ1/ERdj1 and its human homologue HTJ1 are membrane proteins that interact with 
the molecular chaperone BiP through their J-domain. HTJ1 also contains a 
C-terminal cytosolic region of unknown function that consists of two SANT 
domains separated by a spacer region. We recently showed that the second SANT 
domain of HTJ1 (SANT2) binds to alpha1-antichymotrypsin and alters its serpin 
activity [B. Kroczynska, C.M. Evangelista, S.S. Samant, E.C. Elguindi, S.Y. 
Blond, The SANT2 domain of the murine tumor cell DnaJ-like protein 1 human 
homologue interacts with alpha1-antichymotrypsin and kinetically interferes with 
its serpin inhibitory activity, J. Biol. Chem. 279 (2004) 11432-11443]. Here, we 
identified a new variant of human inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4 
(ITIH4) that also interacts with the SANT2 domain of HTJ1. Biochemical, 
mutagenesis, and fluorescence studies demonstrate that SANT2 binds to a 
carboxyl-terminal fragment that corresponds to the last third of the new ITIH4 
isoform sequence (residues 588-930). ITIH4 and MTJ1 co-immunoprecipitate from 
total liver protein extracts and SANT2 protects the ITIH4(588-930) recombinant 
fragment from being processed by kallikrein in vitro. This work reveals that the 
SANT2 domain of HTJ1 is a genuine protein-protein interaction module.
