The 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) family comprises the most abundant and 
important group of molecular chaperones. Hsp70s cooperate with a number of 
cofactors, which define their functions. We recently reported that a yeast 
protein, Rot1, is a putative cofactor of BiP, an endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER)-localized Hsp70. Rot1 is an essential ER membrane protein and may be 
involved in protein folding. Mutation of the ROT1 gene caused defects in cell 
wall synthesis and lysis of autophagic bodies. We suggest that Rot1 is required 
for folding of proteins engaged in these cellular processes.
