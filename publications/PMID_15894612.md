The activating NKG2D receptor plays a critical role in innate and adaptive 
immune responses by natural killer cells and subpopulations of T cells. The 
human receptor assembles with the DAP10 signaling dimer, and it is thought that 
one NKG2D homodimer pairs with a single DAP10 dimer by formation of two salt 
bridges between charged transmembrane (TM) residues. However, direct 
stoichiometry measurements demonstrated that one NKG2D homodimer assembles with 
four DAP10 chains. Selective mutation of one of the basic TM residues of NKG2D 
resulted in loss of two DAP10 chains, indicating that each TM arginine serves as 
an interaction site for a DAP10 dimer. Assembly of the hexameric structure was 
cooperative because this mutation also significantly reduced NKG2D dimerization. 
A monomeric NKG2D TM peptide was sufficient for assembly with a DAP10 dimer, 
indicating that the interaction between these proteins occurs in the membrane 
environment. Formation of a three-helix interface among the TM domains involved 
ionizable residues from all three chains, the TM arginine of NKG2D and both TM 
aspartic acids of the DAP10 dimer. The organization of the TM domains thus shows 
similarities to the T cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex, in particular to the 
six-chain assembly intermediate between T cell antigen receptor and the CD3delta 
epsilon and CD3gamma epsilon dimers. Binding of a single ligand can thus result 
in phosphorylation of four DAP10 chains, which may be relevant for the 
sensitivity of NKG2D receptor signaling, in particular in situations of low 
ligand density.
