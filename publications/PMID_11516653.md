Cell movement is mediated by the protrusion of cytoplasm in the form of sheet- 
and rod-like extensions, termed lamellipodia and filopodia. Protrusion is driven 
by actin polymerization, a process that is regulated by signaling complexes that 
are, as yet, poorly defined. Since actin assembly is controlled at the tips of 
lamellipodia and filopodia [1], these juxtamembrane sites are likely to harbor 
the protein complexes that control actin polymerization dynamics underlying cell 
motility. An understanding of the regulation of protrusion therefore requires 
the characterization of the molecular components recruited to these sites. The 
Abl interactor (Abi) proteins, targets of Abl tyrosine kinases [2-4], have been 
implicated in Rac-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization in response to growth 
factor stimulation [5]. Here, we describe the unique localization of Abi 
proteins in living, motile cells. We show that Abi-1 and Abi-2b fused to 
enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) are recruited to the tips of 
lamellipodia and filopodia. We identify the targeting domain as the homologous N 
terminus of these two proteins. Our findings are the first to suggest a direct 
involvement of members of the Abi protein family in the control of actin 
polymerization in protrusion events, and establish the Abi proteins as potential 
regulators of motility.
