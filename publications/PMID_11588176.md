Heterotetrameric adaptor complexes vesiculate donor membranes. One of the 
adaptor protein complexes, AP-3, is present in two forms; one form is expressed 
in all tissues of the body, whereas the other is restricted to brain. Mice 
lacking both the ubiquitous and neuronal forms of AP-3 exhibit neurological 
disorders that are not observed in mice that are mutant only in the ubiquitous 
form. To begin to understand the role of neuronal AP-3 in neurological disease, 
we investigated its function in in vitro assays as well as its localization in 
neural tissue. In the presence of GTPgammaS both ubiquitous and neuronal forms 
of AP-3 can bind to purified synaptic vesicles. However, only the neuronal form 
of AP-3 can produce synaptic vesicles from endosomes in vitro. We also 
identified that the expression of neuronal AP-3 is limited to varicosities of 
neuronal-like processes and is expressed in most axons of the brain. Although 
the AP-2/clathrin pathway is the major route of vesicle production and the 
relatively minor neuronal AP-3 pathway is not necessary for viability, the 
absence of the latter could lead to the neurological abnormalities seen in mice 
lacking the expression of AP-3 in brain. In this study we have identified the 
first brain-specific function for a neuronal adaptor complex.
