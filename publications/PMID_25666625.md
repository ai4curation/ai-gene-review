The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a well characterized 
receptor-tyrosine kinase that functions in development and serves a vital role 
in many human cancers. Understanding EGFR regulatory mechanisms, and hence 
approaches for clinical intervention, has focused on ligand-receptor 
interactions and tyrosine kinase activity. Here, we show using the NCI-H460 lung 
and A431 epidermoid human cancer cell lines that EGFR binding to anterior 
gradient homolog 2 (AGR2) in the endoplasmic reticulum is required for receptor 
delivery to the plasma membrane and thus EGFR signaling. Reduced AGR2 protein 
levels or mutation of an essential cysteine in the active site result in 
decreased cell surface EGFR and a concomitant decrease in signaling as reflected 
by AREG, EGR1, and FOS expression. Similar to previously described EGFR nulls, 
an AGR2 null also resulted in embryonic lethality. Consistent with its role in 
regulating EGFR-mediated signaling, AGR2 expression is also enhanced in many 
human cancers and promotes the transformed phenotype. Furthermore, EGFR-mediated 
signaling in NCI-H460 cells, which are resistant to the tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor AG1478, is also disrupted with reduced AGR2 expression. The results 
provide insights into why cancer prognosis or response to therapy often does not 
correlate with EGFR protein or RNA levels because they do not reflect delivery 
to the cell surface where signaling is initiated. AGR2, therefore, represents a 
novel post-translational regulator of EGFR-mediated signaling and a promising 
target for treating human cancers.

Abstract

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a well characterized receptor-tyrosine kinase that functions in development and serves a vital role in many human cancers. Understanding EGFR regulatory mechanisms, and hence approaches for clinical intervention, has focused on ligand-receptor interactions and tyrosine kinase activity. Here, we show using the NCI-H460 lung and A431 epidermoid human cancer cell lines that EGFR binding to anterior gradient homolog 2 ( AGR2 ) in the endoplasmic reticulum is required for receptor delivery to the plasma membrane and thus EGFR signaling. Reduced AGR2 protein levels or mutation of an essential cysteine in the active site result in decreased cell surface EGFR and a concomitant decrease in signaling as reflected by AREG , EGR1 , and FOS expression. Similar to previously described EGFR nulls, an AGR2 null also resulted in embryonic lethality. Consistent with its role in regulating EGFR-mediated signaling, AGR2 expression is also enhanced in many human cancers and promotes the transformed phenotype. Furthermore, EGFR-mediated signaling in NCI-H460 cells, which are resistant to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478, is also disrupted with reduced AGR2 expression. The results provide insights into why cancer prognosis or response to therapy often does not correlate with EGFR protein or RNA levels because they do not reflect delivery to the cell surface where signaling is initiated. AGR2, therefore, represents a novel post-translational regulator of EGFR-mediated signaling and a promising target for treating human cancers.

Introduction

EGFR 2 -mediated signal transduction is initiated by soluble growth factors that bind the receptor at the cell surface ( 1 – 4 ). This binding promotes receptor dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domain that initiates EGFR-mediated signaling and is followed by endocytosis and receptor degradation ( 5 , 6 ). Since its discovery, EGFR has been closely linked with cancer pathogenesis ( 3 ). Most studies have focused on ligand-receptor binding, receptor kinase activation, and endocytosis as a means of regulating EGFR signaling ( 7 ). Another potential opportunity to regulate EGFR is through its presentation to the cell surface by the secretory pathway, a process for which little was known.

AGR2 is a 17-kDa protein that is expressed by many human cancers ( 8 – 15 ). AGR2 expression promotes the transformed phenotype of adenocarcinoma cell lines by activating the Hippo signaling pathway co-activator YAP1, which in turn induces expression of an EGFR ligand, Amphiregulin ( AREG ) ( 16 , 17 ). The specific mechanism by which AGR2 achieved its biological actions was unknown.

The AGR2 amino acid sequence is highly conserved across species from Xenopus to humans and contains a signal peptide and sequence homology to the thioredoxin superfamily ( 8 , 18 – 20 ). We previously determined that AGR2's effects on signaling requires its residence in the endoplasmic reticulum ( 21 ). Seventeen members of the thioredoxin superfamily reside within the endoplasmic reticulum and function in protein folding by facilitating disulfide bond formation ( 20 , 22 ). AGR2 features a CPHS amino acid sequence in its putative active site, which differs from the prototypic C XX C motif present in most thioredoxins. Only the first cysteine in the active site motif, however, is required for disulfide isomerase activity ( 23 ). A functional role for AGR2 as a thioredoxin had not been established, which led to a hypothesis that it serves such a role in the endoplasmic reticulum, and identification of its substrates would likely reveal how it directly affects signal transduction and cell transformation. In the present study we identify EGFR as an AGR2 substrate and show that this interaction is required for receptor presentation to the plasma membrane and signaling activity.

DISCUSSION

This study presents a novel mechanism for controlling EGFR-mediated signal transduction. We demonstrate that an endoplasmic reticulum-based thioredoxin is able to dictate signaling activity by determining whether EGFR is delivered to the plasma membrane from the secretory pathway. Consistent with the endoplasmic reticulum's established role, proteins must attain the appropriate conformation before they can proceed to the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane. Protein folding and assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum is largely facilitated by the heat shock and thioredoxin protein families ( 29 ). AGR2's homology to other thioredoxins, its formation of mixed disulfides with EGFR, and loss of AGR2 function after mutating the putative active site cysteine are consistent with a role in establishing the appropriate disulfide bonds in EGFR. Appropriately assembled EGFR is then able to exit the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane where signaling is transduced ( 44 ). AGR2 enables EGFR transport to the cell surface and thus impacts cell signaling without affecting receptor RNA or protein levels.

The discovery of EGFR as a substrate is consistent with our previous observations that characterized AGR2's effects on signal transduction ( 16 ). Induced AREG expression by AGR2 is compatible with the activation of EGFR-mediated signaling. Recent gene expression studies revealed that AREG is one of the most highly induced genes by EGFR signaling and thus may serve as a marker of signaling activity ( 27 , 28 ). With respect to the previously reported impact of AGR2 expression on YAP1 activity, recent studies of Drosophila and human cells demonstrated that EGF signaling induces YAP1 activation by inhibiting its phosphorylation through the Ajuba proteins ( 45 ). It is also likely that induced AREG expression by EGFR is mediated by YAP1 activation as previously described ( 16 ).

The absence of another dominant AGR2 mixed disulfide ( Figs. 1 , A , C , and D , and 5 D ) suggests that EGFR is a major substrate for AGR2. None of the proteins previously reported to bind AGR2 such as LYPD3 (C4.4a), DAG1, or MUC2 ( 33 , 46 ) were detected in the mass spectrometry analysis of AGR2 mixed disulfides. Re-evaluation of MUC2 in a recent study also concluded that it is not a AGR2-binding protein and that AGR2 served no role in its folding ( 47 ). The present study differed from previously identified AGR2 binding proteins by the ability to measure a biologic outcome that is shared by its substrate. In the present study similar outcomes were achieved whether AGR2 or EGFR expression was reduced, thus supporting an essential functional relationship between the two proteins. Other AGR2 binding proteins are expected such as potential oxidases that will recycle AGR2 or other chaperones that may also participate in EGFR folding. We conclude, however, that AGR2's major biological effect is mediated through EGFR signaling because of the overlap in cellular effects.

EGFR's dependence on AGR2 is also supported by the newly generated knock-out mice. The approach used to generate AGR2 null mice in the present study ensured that AGR2 expression was disrupted, which resulted in a high rate of embryonic lethality, and closely resembled the outcome of previously generated EGFR null mice ( 41 , 42 ). It is likely the previously published conditional null mice expressed some AGR2 at early developmental stages that increased viability ( 32 , 33 , 43 ). In summary, the results of the null mice support an essential role for AGR2 in EGFR-mediated signaling.

AGR2's expression pattern is also consistent with that of a regulated process. In contrast to other endoplasmic reticulum-based thioredoxins, AGR2 is not constitutively expressed in all cells. In fact, AGR2 is rarely expressed in most normal cells, indicating that its expression is regulated. In contrast, AGR2 expression is present in cell lines and tissues where EGFR-mediated signaling is active. Considering the absence of AGR2 protein and transcript in most normal tissues and the widespread expression of EGFR transcripts, AGR2 expression represents a novel and possibly dominant post-translational mechanism for regulating EGFR-mediated cell signaling. The identification of EGFR as an AGR2 substrate provides insights into why cancer prognosis or response to therapy often does not correlate with EGFR protein or RNA levels because such measures do not reflect delivery to the cell surface ( 7 , 48 ).

The number of publications reporting AGR2 expression in tumors has increased significantly and includes non-small cell lung cancer, colon cancer, breast adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, papillary thyroid tumors, prostate adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, oral cancer, and esophageal cancers ( 9 – 15 , 49 – 52 ). EGFR-mediated signaling has been reported to serve a significant role in all of these tumors. Based on this study's findings, we hypothesize that AGR2 is expressed in all tumors with active EGFR-mediated signaling and serves as a major regulatory factor.

The present work also features AGR2 as a novel therapeutic target because it regulates EGFR at a very early stage in its life cycle. Recent studies have suggested that most, if not all, EGFR-mediated signaling occurs at the plasma membrane ( 5 , 6 ), which this study demonstrates can only be achieved with AGR2 expression. Manipulation of AGR2 expression successfully disrupted EGFR-mediated signaling in cells that were resistant to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Other factors that may also weaken the effectiveness of current therapies include tyrosine kinase-independent EGFR functions that affect DNA synthesis, glucose uptake, and cell proliferation ( 53 , 54 ). AGR2 as a therapeutic target is positioned to impact both kinase-dependent and -independent EGFR functions and represents a novel approach for inhibiting all EGFR-related activities.
