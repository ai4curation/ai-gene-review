Functional analysis of a Bcl-xL phosphorylation mutant series has revealed that 
cells expressing Bcl-xL(Ser49Ala) mutant are less stable at G2 checkpoint after 
DNA damage and enter cytokinesis more slowly after microtubule poisoning, than 
cells expressing wild-type Bcl-xL. These effects of Bcl-xL(Ser49Ala) mutant seem 
to be separable from Bcl-xL function in apoptosis. Bcl-xL(Ser49) phosphorylation 
is cell cycle-dependent. In synchronized cells, phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser49) appears 
during the S phase and G2, whereas it disappears rapidly in early mitosis during 
prometaphase, metaphase and early anaphase, and re-appears during telophase and 
cytokinesis. During DNA damage-induced G2 arrest, an important pool of 
phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser49) accumulates in centrosomes which act as essential decision 
centers for progression from G2 to mitosis. During telophase/cytokinesis, 
phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser49) is found with dynein motor protein. In a series of in 
vitro kinase assays, specific small interfering RNA and pharmacological 
inhibition experiments, polo kinase 3 (PLK3) was implicated in Bcl-xL(Ser49) 
phosphorylation. These data indicate that, during G2 checkpoint, 
phospho-Bcl-xL(Ser49) is another downstream target of PLK3, acting to stabilize 
G2 arrest. Bcl-xL phosphorylation at Ser49 also correlates with essential PLK3 
activity and function, enabling cytokinesis and mitotic exit.
