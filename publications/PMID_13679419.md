Stimulation of dopamine (DA) receptors in the striatum is essential for 
voluntary motor activity and for the generation of plasticity at corticostriatal 
synapses. In the present study, mice lacking DA D1 receptors have been used to 
investigate the involvement of the D1-like class (D1 and D5) of DA receptors in 
locomotion and corticostriatal long-term depression (LTD) and long-term 
potentiation (LTP). Our results suggest that D1 and D5 receptors exert distinct 
actions on both activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and spontaneous motor 
activity. Accordingly, the ablation of D1 receptors disrupted corticostriatal 
LTP, whereas pharmacological blockade of D5 receptors prevented LTD. On the 
other side, genetic ablation of D1 receptors increased locomotor activity, 
whereas the D1/D5 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 decreased motor activity in both 
control mice and mice lacking D1 receptors. Endogenous DA stimulated D1 and D5 
receptors in distinct subtypes of striatal neurons to induce, respectively, LTP 
and LTD. In control mice, in fact, LTP was blocked by inhibiting the D1-protein 
kinase A pathway in the recorded spiny neuron, whereas the striatal nitric 
oxide-producing interneuron was presumably the neuronal subtype stimulated by D5 
receptors during the induction phase of LTD. Understanding the role of DA 
receptors in striatal function is essential to gain insights into the neural 
bases of critical brain functions and of dramatic pathological conditions such 
as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.
