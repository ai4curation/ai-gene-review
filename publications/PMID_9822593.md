Tim10p, a protein of the yeast mitochondrial intermembrane space, was shown 
previously to be essential for the import of multispanning carrier proteins from 
the cytoplasm into the inner membrane. We now identify Tim9p, another essential 
component of this import pathway. Most of Tim9p is associated with Tim10p in a 
soluble 70 kDa complex. Tim9p and Tim10p co-purify in successive chromatographic 
fractionations and co-immunoprecipitated with each other. Tim9p can be 
cross-linked to a partly translocated carrier protein. A small fraction of Tim9p 
is bound to the outer face of the inner membrane in a 300 kDa complex whose 
other subunits include Tim54p, Tim22p, Tim12p and Tim10p. The sequence of Tim9p 
is 25% identical to that of Tim10p and Tim12p. A Ser67-->Cys67 mutation in Tim9p 
suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth defect of tim10-1 and tim12-1 
mutants. Tim9p is a new subunit of the TIM machinery that guides hydrophobic 
inner membrane proteins across the aqueous intermembrane space.
