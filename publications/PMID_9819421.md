Cyclophilins are cis-trans-peptidyl-prolyl isomerases that bind to and are 
inhibited by the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA). The toxic effects of CsA 
are mediated by the 18-kDa cyclophilin A protein. A larger cyclophilin of 40 
kDa, cyclophilin 40, is a component of Hsp90-steroid receptor complexes and 
contains two domains, an amino-terminal prolyl isomerase domain and a 
carboxy-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. There are two 
cyclophilin 40 homologs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encoded by the 
CPR6 and CPR7 genes. Yeast strains lacking the Cpr7 enzyme are viable but 
exhibit a slow-growth phenotype. In addition, we show here that cpr7 mutant 
strains are hypersensitive to the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. When 
overexpressed, the TPR domain of Cpr7 alone complements both cpr7 mutant 
phenotypes, while overexpression of the cyclophilin domain of Cpr7, full-length 
Cpr6, or human cyclophilin 40 does not. The open reading frame YBR155w, which 
has moderate identity to the yeast p60 homolog STI1, was isolated as a 
high-copy-number suppressor of the cpr7 slow-growth phenotype. We show that this 
Sti1 homolog Cns1 (cyclophilin seven suppressor) is constitutively expressed, 
essential, and found in protein complexes with both yeast Hsp90 and Cpr7 but not 
with Cpr6. Cyclosporin A inhibited Cpr7 interactions with Cns1 but not with 
Hsp90. In summary, our findings identify a novel component of the Hsp90 
chaperone complex that shares function with cyclophilin 40 and provide evidence 
that there are functional differences between two conserved sets of Hsp90 
binding proteins in yeast.
