The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) is critical for muscle membrane 
stability. The sarcoglycans are transmembrane proteins within the DGC, and the 
function of the sarcoglycans is unknown. Mutations in sarcoglycan genes cause 
autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy. We have identified a new sarcoglycan 
gene with high homology to alpha-sarcoglycan highlighting the redundancy of the 
DGC. This gene, named epsilon-sarcoglycan, has an identical intron-exon 
structure to alpha-sarcoglycan, and is more broadly expressed. The 
characterization of epsilon-sarcoglycan should make it possible to determine if 
it, like the other sarcoglycan genes, is mutated in muscular dystrophy.
