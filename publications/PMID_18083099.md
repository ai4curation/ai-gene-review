COMPASS, the yeast homolog of the mammalian MLL complex, is a histone H3 lysine 
4 (H3K4) methylase consisting of Set1 (KMT2) and seven other polypeptides, 
including Cps35, the only essential subunit. Histone H2B monoubiquitination by 
Rad6/Bre1 is required for both H3K4 methylation by COMPASS, and H3K79 
methylation by Dot1. However, the molecular mechanism for such histone crosstalk 
is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that histone H2B monoubiquitination 
controls the binding of Cps35 with COMPASS complex. Cps 35 is required for 
COMPASS' catalytic activity in vivo, and the addition of exogenous purified 
Cps35 to COMPASS purified from a Deltarad6 background results in the generation 
of a methylation competent COMPASS. Cps35 associates with the chromatin of 
COMPASS-regulated genes in a H2BK123 monoubiquitination-dependent but 
Set1-independent manner. Cps35 is also required for proper H3K79 trimethylation. 
These findings offer insight into the molecular role of Cps35 in translating the 
H2B monoubiquitination signal into H3 methylation.
