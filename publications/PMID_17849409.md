Binding and activation of human plasminogen (Plg) to generate the proteolytic 
enzyme plasmin (Plm) have been associated with the invasive potential of certain 
bacteria. In this work, proteomic analysis together with ligand blotting assays 
identified several major Plg-binding spots in Mycobacterium tuberculosis soluble 
extracts (SEs) and culture filtrate proteins. The identity of 15 different 
proteins was deduced by N-terminal and/or MS and corresponded to DnaK, GroES, 
GlnA1, Ag85 complex, Mpt51, Mpt64, PrcB, MetK, SahH, Lpd, Icl, Fba, and EF-Tu. 
Binding of Plg to recombinant M. tuberculosis DnaK, GlnA1, and Ag85B was further 
confirmed by ELISA and ligand blotting assays. The binding was inhibited by 
epsilon-aminocaproic acid, indicating that the interaction involved lysine 
residues. Plg bound to recombinant mycobacterial proteins was activated to Plm 
by tissue-type Plg activator. In contrast with recombinant proteins, M. 
tuberculosis SE enhanced several times the Plg activation mediated by the 
activator. Interestingly, GlnA1 was able to bind the extracellular matrix (ECM) 
protein fibronectin. Together these results show that M. tuberculosis posses 
several Plg receptors suggesting that bound Plg to bacteria surface, can be 
activated to Plm, endowing bacteria with the ability to break down ECM and basal 
membranes proteins contributing to tissue injury in tuberculosis.
