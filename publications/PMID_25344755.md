Cyclin C was cloned as a growth-promoting G1 cyclin, and was also shown to 
regulate gene transcription. Here we report that in vivo cyclin C acts as a 
haploinsufficient tumour suppressor, by controlling Notch1 oncogene levels. 
Cyclin C activates an 'orphan' CDK19 kinase, as well as CDK8 and CDK3. These 
cyclin-C-CDK complexes phosphorylate the Notch1 intracellular domain (ICN1) and 
promote ICN1 degradation. Genetic ablation of cyclin C blocks ICN1 
phosphorylation in vivo, thereby elevating ICN1 levels in cyclin-C-knockout 
mice. Cyclin C ablation or heterozygosity collaborates with other oncogenic 
lesions and accelerates development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
(T-ALL). Furthermore, the cyclin C encoding gene CCNC is heterozygously deleted 
in a significant fraction of human T-ALLs, and these tumours express reduced 
cyclin C levels. We also describe point mutations in human T-ALL that render 
cyclin-C-CDK unable to phosphorylate ICN1. Hence, tumour cells may develop 
different strategies to evade inhibition by cyclin C.
