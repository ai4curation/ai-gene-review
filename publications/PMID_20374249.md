Enterohaemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EHEC and EPEC 
respectively) are diarrhoeal pathogens that cause the formation of attaching and 
effacing (A/E) lesions on infected host cells. These pathogens encode a type III 
secretion system (T3SS) used to inject effector proteins directly into host 
cells, an essential requirement for virulence. In this study, we identified a 
function for the type III secreted effector EspZ. Infection with EPEC DeltaespZ 
caused increased cytotoxicity in HeLa and MDCK cells compared with wild-type 
EPEC, and expressing espZ in cells abrogated this effect. Using yeast 
two-hybrid, proteomics, immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation, it was 
demonstrated that EspZ interacts with the host protein CD98, which contributes 
to protection against EPEC-mediated cytotoxicity. EspZ enhanced phosphorylation 
of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and AKT during infection with EPEC, but CD98 only 
appeared to facilitate FAK phosphorylation. This study provides evidence that 
EspZ and CD98 promote host cell survival mechanisms involving FAK during A/E 
pathogen infection.
