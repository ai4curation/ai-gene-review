We isolated two proteins, ECP-51 and ECP-54, from human erythrocyte cytosol by 
affinity chromatography using a peptide of the integral membrane protein 
stomatin as bait. Partial amino acid sequence information obtained by 
microsequencing allowed us to clone the respective cDNAs. Analysis of the 
nucleotide sequences revealed that ECP-51 and ECP-54 are homologous (44.2% amino 
acid identity) and contain ATP-binding sites. ECP-54 was identified as 
TIP49/RUVBL1/NMP238, which is a component of a large nuclear protein complex, 
possibly the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme; ECP-51 is a novel protein. Using the 
two-hybrid system, we showed that these proteins interact with each other. The 
interaction of ECP-51 and ECP-54 with the stomatin peptide and the localization 
to the nucleus and cytoplasm suggest an additional function for these proteins 
as chaperone components.
