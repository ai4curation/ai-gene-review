Lipid rafts are microdomains of the phospholipid bilayer, proposed to form 
semi-stable "islands" that act as a platform for several important cellular 
processes; major classes of raft-resident proteins include signalling proteins 
and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. Proteomic studies into 
lipid rafts have been mainly carried out in mammalian cell lines and single cell 
organisms. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the model organism with a 
well-defined developmental profile, is ideally suited for the study of this 
subcellular locale in a complex developmental context. A study of the lipid raft 
proteome of C. elegans is presented here. A total of 44 proteins were identified 
from the lipid raft fraction using geLC-MS/MS, of which 40 have been determined 
to be likely raft proteins after analysis of predicted functions. Prediction of 
GPI-anchoring of the proteins found 21 to be potentially modified in this way, 
two of which were experimentally confirmed to be GPI-anchored. This work is the 
first reported study of the lipid raft proteome in C. elegans. The results show 
that raft proteins, including numerous GPI-anchored proteins, may have a variety 
of potentially important roles within the nematode, and will hopefully lead to 
C. elegans becoming a useful model for the study of lipid rafts.
