Members of the syntaxin protein family participate in the docking-fusion step of 
several intracellular vesicular transport events. Tlg1p has been identified as a 
nonessential protein required for efficient endocytosis as well as the 
maintenance of normal levels of trans-Golgi network proteins. In this study we 
independently describe Tlg1p as an essential protein required for cell 
viability. Depletion of Tlg1p in vivo causes a defect in the transport of the 
vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y through the early Golgi. 
Temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of Tlg1p also accumulate the endoplasmic 
reticulum/cis-Golgi form of carboxypeptidase Y at the nonpermissive temperature 
(38 degrees C) and exhibit underglycosylation of secreted invertase. 
Overexpression of Tlg1p complements the growth defect of vti1-11 at the 
nonpermissive temperature, whereas incomplete complementation was observed with 
vti1-1, further suggesting a role for Tlg1p in the Golgi apparatus. 
Overexpression of Sed5p decreases the viability of tlg1 ts mutants compared with 
wild-type cells, suggesting that tlg1 ts mutants are more susceptible to 
elevated levels of Sed5p. Tlg1p is able to bind His6-tagged Sec17p (yeast 
alpha-SNAP) in a dose-dependent manner and enters into a SNARE complex with 
Vti1p, Tlg2p, and Vps45p. Morphological analyses by electron microscopy reveal 
that cells depleted of Tlg1p or tlg1 ts mutants incubated at the restrictive 
temperature accumulate 40- to 50-nm vesicles and experience fragmentation of the 
vacuole.
