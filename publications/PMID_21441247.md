Several genes predisposing to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) with or without 
epilepsy have been identified, many of which are implicated in synaptic 
function. Here we report a Q555X mutation in synapsin 1 (SYN1), an X-linked gene 
encoding for a neuron-specific phosphoprotein implicated in the regulation of 
neurotransmitter release and synaptogenesis. This nonsense mutation was found in 
all affected individuals from a large French-Canadian family segregating 
epilepsy and ASDs. Additional mutations in SYN1 (A51G, A550T and T567A) were 
found in 1.0 and 3.5% of French-Canadian individuals with autism and epilepsy, 
respectively. The majority of these SYN1 mutations were clustered in the 
proline-rich D-domain which is substrate of multiple protein kinases. When 
expressed in synapsin I (SynI) knockout (KO) neurons, all the D-domain mutants 
failed in rescuing the impairment in the size and trafficking of synaptic 
vesicle pools, whereas the wild-type human SynI fully reverted the KO phenotype. 
Moreover, the nonsense Q555X mutation had a dramatic impact on phosphorylation 
by MAPK/Erk and neurite outgrowth, whereas the missense A550T and T567A mutants 
displayed impaired targeting to nerve terminals. These results demonstrate that 
SYN1 is a novel predisposing gene to ASDs, in addition to epilepsy, and 
strengthen the hypothesis that a disturbance of synaptic homeostasis underlies 
the pathogenesis of both diseases.
