Behavioral plasticity induced by the integration of two sensory signals, such as 
associative learning, is an important issue in neuroscience, but its 
evolutionary origin and diversity have not been explored sufficiently. We report 
here a new type of such behavioral plasticity, which we call butanone 
enhancement, in Caenorhabditis elegans adult hermaphrodites: C. elegans 
specifically enhances chemotaxis to butanone by preexposure to butanone and 
food. Mutant analysis revealed that this plasticity requires the AWC(ON) 
olfactory neuron, whose fate is known to be determined by the NSY-1/ASK1 MAPKKK 
(mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase) cascade as well as the DAF-11 
and ODR-1 guanylyl cyclases. These proteins also control many aspects of 
olfactory sensation/plasticity in AWC neurons and seem to provide appropriate 
cellular conditions for butanone enhancement in the AWC(ON) neuron. Butanone 
enhancement also required the functions of Bardet-Biedl syndrome genes in the 
AWC(ON) neuron but not other genes that control ciliary transport. Furthermore, 
preexposure to butanone and the odor of food was enough for the enhancement of 
butanone chemotaxis. These results suggest that the AWC(ON) olfactory neuron may 
conduct a behavioral plasticity resembling associative learning and that the 
functions of Bardet-Biedl syndrome genes in sensory cilia may play an important 
role in this plasticity.
