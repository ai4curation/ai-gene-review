Germline mutations in BRCA1 are responsible for most cases of inherited breast 
and ovarian cancer. However, the function of the BRCA1 protein has remained 
elusive. We now show that BRCA1 encodes a 190-kD protein with sequence homology 
and biochemical analogy to the granin protein family. Interestingly, BRCA2 also 
includes a motif similar to the granin consensus at the C terminus of the 
protein. Both BRCA1 and the granins localize to secretory vesicles, are secreted 
by a regulated pathway, are post-translationally glycosylated and are responsive 
to hormones. As a regulated secretory protein, BRCA1 appears to function by a 
mechanism not previously described for tumour suppressor gene products.
