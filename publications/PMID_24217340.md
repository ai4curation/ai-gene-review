Hedgehog (Hh) signalling regulates embryonic development and adult tissue 
homoeostasis. Mutations of its pathway components including Suppressor of Fused 
(Sufu) and Gli/Ci predispose to cancers and congenital anomalies. The Sufu-Gli 
protein complex occupies a central position in the vertebrate Hh signalling 
pathway, especially in mammals. Here structures of full-length human and 
Drosophila Sufu, the human Sufu-Gli complex, along with normal mode analysis and 
FRET measurement results, reveal that Sufu alternates between 'open' and 
'closed' conformations. The 'closed' form of Sufu is stabilized by Gli binding 
and inhibited by Hh treatment, whereas the 'open' state of Sufu is promoted by 
Gli-dissociation and Hh signalling. Mutations of critical interface residues 
disrupt the Sufu-Gli complex and prevent Sufu from repressing Gli-mediated 
transcription, tethering Gli in the cytoplasm and protecting Gli from the 26S 
proteasome-mediated degradation. Our study thus provides mechanistic insight 
into the mutual recognition and regulation between Sufu and Gli/Ci.
