Modifier of transcription 1 (Mot1) is a conserved and essential Swi2/Snf2 ATPase 
that can remove TATA-binding protein (TBP) from DNA using ATP hydrolysis and in 
so doing exerts global effects on transcription. Spt16 is also essential and 
functions globally in transcriptional regulation as a component of the 
facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) histone chaperone complex. Here we 
demonstrate that Mot1 and Spt16 regulate a largely overlapping set of genes in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As expected, Mot1 was found to control TBP levels at 
co-regulated promoters. In contrast, Spt16 did not affect TBP recruitment. On a 
global scale, Spt16 was required for Mot1 promoter localization, and Mot1 also 
affected Spt16 localization to genes. Interestingly, we found that Mot1 has an 
unanticipated role in establishing or maintaining the occupancy and positioning 
of nucleosomes at the 5' ends of genes. Spt16 has a broad role in regulating 
chromatin organization in gene bodies, including those nucleosomes affected by 
Mot1. These results suggest that the large scale overlap in Mot1 and Spt16 
function arises from a combination of both their unique and shared functions in 
transcription complex assembly and chromatin structure regulation.
