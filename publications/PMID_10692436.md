In vitro protein binding assays identified two distinct calmodulin (CaM) binding 
sites within the NH(2)-terminal 30-kDa domain of erythrocyte protein 4.1 (4.1R): 
a Ca(2+)-independent binding site (A(264)KKLWKVCVEHHTFFRL) and a 
Ca(2+)-dependent binding site (A(181)KKLSMYGVDLHKAKDL). Synthetic peptides 
corresponding to these sequences bound CaM in vitro; conversely, deletion of 
these peptides from a 30-kDa construct reduced binding to CaM. Thus, 4.1R is a 
unique CaM-binding protein in that it has distinct Ca(2+)-dependent and 
Ca(2+)-independent high affinity CaM binding sites. CaM bound to 4.1R at a 
stoichiometry of 1:1 both in the presence and absence of Ca(2+), implying that 
one CaM molecule binds to two distinct sites in the same molecule of 4.1R. 
Interactions of 4.1R with membrane proteins such as band 3 is regulated by 
Ca(2+) and CaM. While the intrinsic affinity of the 30-kDa domain for the 
cytoplasmic tail of erythrocyte membrane band 3 was not altered by elimination 
of one or both CaM binding sites, the ability of Ca(2+)/CaM to down-regulate 4. 
1R-band 3 interaction was abrogated by such deletions. Thus, regulation of 
protein 4.1 binding to membrane proteins by Ca(2+) and CaM requires binding of 
CaM to both Ca(2+)-independent and Ca(2+)-dependent sites in protein 4.1.
