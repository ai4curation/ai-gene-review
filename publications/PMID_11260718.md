Most organisms, from cyanobacteria to mammals, use circadian clocks to 
coordinate their activities with the natural 24-h light/dark cycle. The clock 
proteins of Drosophila and mammals exhibit striking homology but do not show 
similarity with clock proteins found so far from either cyanobacteria or 
Neurospora. Each of these organisms uses a transcriptionally regulated negative 
feedback loop in which the messenger RNA levels of the clock components cycle 
over a 24-h period. Proteins containing PAS domains are invariably found in at 
least one component of the characterized eukaryotic clocks. Here we describe 
ADAGIO1 (ADO1), a gene of Arabidopsis thaliana that encodes a protein containing 
a PAS domain. We found that a loss-of-function ado1 mutant is altered in both 
gene expression and cotyledon movement in circadian rhythmicity. Under constant 
white or blue light, the ado1 mutant exhibits a longer period than that of 
wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings, whereas under red light cotyledon movement and 
stem elongation are arrhythmic. Both yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding 
studies show that there is a physical interaction between ADO1 and the 
photoreceptors CRY1 and phyB. We propose that ADO1 is an important component of 
the Arabidopsis circadian system.
