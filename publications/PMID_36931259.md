14-3-3 proteins are highly conserved regulatory proteins that interact with 
hundreds of structurally diverse clients and act as central hubs of signaling 
networks. However, how 14-3-3 paralogs differ in specificity and how they 
regulate client protein function are not known for most clients. Here, we map 
the interactomes of all human 14-3-3 paralogs and systematically characterize 
the effect of disrupting these interactions on client localization. The loss of 
14-3-3 binding leads to the coalescence of a large fraction of clients into 
discrete foci in a client-specific manner, suggesting a central chaperone-like 
function for 14-3-3 proteins. Congruently, the engraftment of 14-3-3 binding 
motifs to nonclients can suppress their aggregation or phase separation. 
Finally, we show that 14-3-3s negatively regulate the localization of the 
RNA-binding protein SAMD4A to cytoplasmic granules and inhibit its activity as a 
translational repressor. Our work suggests that 14-3-3s have a more prominent 
role as chaperone-like molecules than previously thought.
