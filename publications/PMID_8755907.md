Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cell wall and cytosolic extracts obtained 
from parental and ssa1 and ssa2 single- and double-mutant strains of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) products 
of these genes, previously thought to be restricted to the cell interior, are 
also present in the cell wall. A cell wall location was further confirmed by 
indirect immunofluorescence with intact cells and biotinylation of extracellular 
Hsp70. Hsp70s have been implicated in translocation across the membrane and as 
molecular chaperones, and changes in the profile of cell wall proteins suggested 
that these proteins may have a similar role in the cell wall.
