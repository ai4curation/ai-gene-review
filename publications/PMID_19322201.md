The RNA-binding protein HuR regulates the stability and translation of numerous 
mRNAs encoding stress-response and proliferative proteins. Although its 
post-transcriptional influence has been linked primarily to its cytoplasmic 
translocation, here we report that moderate heat shock (HS) potently reduces HuR 
levels, thereby altering the expression of HuR target mRNAs. HS did not change 
HuR mRNA levels or de novo translation, but instead reduced HuR protein 
stability. Supporting the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in this 
process were results showing that (1) HuR was ubiquitinated in vitro and in 
intact cells, (2) proteasome inhibition increased HuR abundance after HS, and 
(3) the HuR kinase checkpoint kinase 2 protected against the loss of HuR by HS. 
Within a central, HS-labile approximately 110-amino-acid region, K182 was found 
to be essential for HuR ubiquitination and proteolysis as mutant HuR(K182R) was 
left virtually unubiquitinated and was refractory to HS-triggered degradation. 
Our findings reveal that HS transiently lowers HuR by proteolysis linked to K182 
ubiquitination and that HuR reduction enhances cell survival following HS.
