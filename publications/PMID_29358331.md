The pluripotency-controlling stem-cell protein SRY-box 2 (SOX2) plays a pivotal 
role in maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells 
and also of teratocarcinoma or embryonic carcinoma cells. SOX2 is monomethylated 
at lysine 119 (Lys-119) in mouse embryonic stem cells by the SET7 
methyltransferase, and this methylation triggers ubiquitin-dependent SOX2 
proteolysis. However, the molecular regulators and mechanisms controlling 
SET7-induced SOX2 proteolysis are unknown. Here, we report that in human ovarian 
teratocarcinoma PA-1 cells, methylation-dependent SOX2 proteolysis is 
dynamically regulated by the LSD1 lysine demethylase and a methyl-binding 
protein, PHD finger protein 20-like 1 (PHF20L1). We found that LSD1 not only 
removes the methyl group from monomethylated Lys-117 (equivalent to Lys-119 in 
mouse SOX2), but it also demethylates monomethylated Lys-42 in SOX2, a reaction 
that SET7 also regulated and that also triggered SOX2 proteolysis. Our studies 
further revealed that PHF20L1 binds both monomethylated Lys-42 and Lys-117 in 
SOX2 and thereby prevents SOX2 proteolysis. Down-regulation of either LSD1 or 
PHF20L1 promoted SOX2 proteolysis, which was prevented by SET7 inactivation in 
both PA-1 and mouse embryonic stem cells. Our studies also disclosed that LSD1 
and PHF20L1 normally regulate the growth of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem 
cells and PA-1 cells by preventing methylation-dependent SOX2 proteolysis. In 
conclusion, our findings reveal an important mechanism by which the stability of 
the pluripotency-controlling stem-cell protein SOX2 is dynamically regulated by 
the activities of SET7, LSD1, and PHF20L1 in pluripotent stem cells.
