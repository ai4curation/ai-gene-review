The human homolog of the Drosophila headcase (HECA) belongs to a new class of 
cell differentiation regulators. In Drosophila, the HECA protein regulates the 
proliferation and differentiation of cells during adult morphogenesis. There is 
growing evidence that HECA plays an important role in human carcinogenesis. In 
different tumor entities, an altered HECA expression was found (colorectal, 
pancreatic and renal cancer). Colorectal cancer studies also suggested HECA as a 
marker for early disease stages. Therefore, we speculated whether human HECA 
affects cell cycle progression and proliferation in head and neck cancer cells. 
In vivo, we found a distinct HECA protein expression in basal and superficial 
cells of a healthy oral epithelium via immunohistochemistry, whereas in tissues 
of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a weaker staining was observed, 
particularly in basal cells. In vitro, mRNA and protein expression analyses of 
OSCC cell lines exhibited that HECA expression correlates with the state of 
cellular differentiation. In further investigations, we overexpressed HECA in 
the OSCC cell line PCI 13 and performed functional assays. HECA-overexpressing 
OSCC cells revealed a significant extended doubling time (up to 45%, 17 h) and 
yielded a lower number of proliferating cells (up to 30%) than controls. Flow 
cytometry analyses have shown that HECA-overexpressing OSCC cells forced to hold 
in the G(2)/M-Phase. In summary, our results show that human HECA slows down 
cell division of OSCC cells and may therefore act as a tumor suppressor in head 
and neck cancer.
