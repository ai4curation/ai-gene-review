Cytoskeletal proteins are crucial in maintaining cellular structure and, in 
certain cell types, also play an essential role in motility and shape change. 
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important paracrine mediator of vascular and platelet 
function and is produced in the vasculature by the enzyme NO synthase type 3 
(NOS-3). Here, we demonstrate in human platelets that the polymerization state 
of beta-actin crucially regulates the activation state of NOS-3, and hence NO 
formation, through altering its binding of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). We 
found that NOS-3 binds to the globular, but not the filamentous, form of 
beta-actin, and the affinity of NOS-3 for globular beta-actin is, in turn, 
increased by Hsp90. Formation of this ternary complex among NOS-3, globular 
beta-actin, and Hsp90, in turn, results in an increase in both NOS activity and 
cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate, an index of bioactive NO, as well as an 
increased rate of Hsp90 degradation, thus limiting the duration for which NOS-3 
remains activated. These observations suggest that beta-actin plays a critical 
role in regulating NO formation and signaling in platelets.

Abstract

Cytoskeletal proteins are crucial in maintaining cellular structure and, in certain cell types, also play an essential role in motility and shape change. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important paracrine mediator of vascular and platelet function and is produced in the vasculature by the enzyme NO synthase type 3 (NOS-3). Here, we demonstrate in human platelets that the polymerization state of β-actin crucially regulates the activation state of NOS-3, and hence NO formation, through altering its binding of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). We found that NOS-3 binds to the globular, but not the filamentous, form of β-actin, and the affinity of NOS-3 for globular β-actin is, in turn, increased by Hsp90. Formation of this ternary complex among NOS-3, globular β-actin, and Hsp90, in turn, results in an increase in both NOS activity and cyclic guanosine-3′,5′-monophosphate, an index of bioactive NO, as well as an increased rate of Hsp90 degradation, thus limiting the duration for which NOS-3 remains activated. These observations suggest that β-actin plays a critical role in regulating NO formation and signaling in platelets.
