The LAMTOR [late endosomal and lysosomal adaptor and MAPK (mitogen-activated 
protein kinase) and mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) activator] complex, 
also known as "Ragulator," controls the activity of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) on 
the lysosome. The crystal structure of LAMTOR consists of two roadblock/LC7 
domain-folded heterodimers wrapped and apparently held together by LAMTOR1, 
which assembles the complex on lysosomes. In addition, the Rag guanosine 
triphosphatases (GTPases) associated with the pentamer through their 
carboxyl-terminal domains, predefining the orientation for interaction with 
mTORC1. In vitro reconstitution and experiments with site-directed mutagenesis 
defined the physiological importance of LAMTOR1 in assembling the remaining 
components to ensure fidelity of mTORC1 signaling. Functional data validated the 
effect of two short LAMTOR1 amino acid regions in recruitment and stabilization 
of the Rag GTPases.
