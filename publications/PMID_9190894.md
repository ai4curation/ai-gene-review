The Tax protein of the Human T-cell Leukemia Virus (HTLV) activates the 
expression of viral mRNA through a three 21 bp repeat enhancer located within 
the HTLV-1 LTR. Since Tax does not bind to the 21 bp DNA repeats directly, it 
has been speculated that Tax interacts with cellular protein(s) which mediate 
binding to the enhancer. We employed the yeast two hybrid system to identify 
host proteins that are potentially relevant to Tax transactivation. We 
identified a Tax binding protein encoded from a cDNA expression library derived 
from peripheral blood lymphocytes. The corresponding cDNA has sequence identity 
with a known transcription factor, activating factor-4 (ATF-4). ATF-4 also binds 
to GST-Tax fusion protein in vitro. Tax mutants that did not transactivate the 
HTLV-1 LTR also failed to bind ATF-4. The critical domain for Tax binding 
resides in a 85 amino acid stretch in the C-terminus of ATF-4, which contains 
the basic domain and leucine zipper. We further demonstrated that both full 
length and N-terminal truncated ATF-4 were able to enhance Tax transactivation. 
Thus, ATF-4 may act as an adapter between Tax and the TRE (Tax responsive 
element), and play an important role in Tax-mediated transactivation.
