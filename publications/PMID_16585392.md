BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data strongly indicate that diabetes increases the 
incidence of heart failure. Although the benefit of angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) treatment during and after myocardial infarction has 
been found to be greater in diabetics than nondiabetics and activation of the 
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated, the molecular basis of these 
actions remains unclear.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated transgenic mice with cardiac-specific 
overexpression of wild-type p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (WT-p90RSK-Tg) and a 
dominant-negative form of p90RSK (DN-p90RSK-Tg). Recovery of cardiac function 
after ischemia/reperfusion in WT-p90RSK-Tg isolated mouse hearts was 
significantly impaired. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization 
time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed specific induction of 
prorenin-converting enzyme (PRECE) in WT-p90RSK-Tg mice. mRNA induction of PRECE 
was confirmed with serial angiotensinogen protein reduction after perfusion in 
WT-p90RSK-Tg mice, suggesting an increase of angiotensinogen cleavage and 
subsequent RAS activation in WT-p90RSK-Tg mice. We investigated the role of the 
RAS in WT-p90RSK-Tg animals after ischemia/reperfusion with the use of an ACE-I 
(captopril) and an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (olmesartan). We did 
not observe any effect of these inhibitors in non-Tg littermate controls, thus 
corroborating other reports in rodents. In contrast, both captopril and 
olmesartan significantly improved cardiac function and reduced infarct size in 
WT-p90RSK-Tg mice. At 8 months of age, WT-p90RSK-Tg mice developed cardiac 
dysfunction. p90RSK activity and PRECE mRNA were both increased by 
streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia in non-Tg littermate controls, whereas 
DN-p90RSK-Tg animals exposed to streptozotocin did not have PRECE induction.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the critical role of p90RSK in 
hyperglycemia-mediated myocardial PRECE induction, which may explain the 
augmentation of the RAS in diabetic hearts and provide an alternative 
therapeutic approach to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy.
