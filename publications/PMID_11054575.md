The deletion of the TOM1 gene encoding a putative ubiquitin ligase causes a 
temperature sensitive cellular growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The arrested 
cells exhibit pleiotropic defects in nuclear division, maintenance of nuclear 
structure and heat stress responses. We previously identified a zuo1 mutation as 
an extragenic suppressor of the tom1 mutant. ZUO1 encodes a DnaJ-related Hsp40. 
Here we show that a recessive cold sensitive mutation in PDR13 coding for an 
Hsp70 suppressed the tom1 mutation. The pdr13 deletion mutant was sensitive to 
high osmolarity, just like the zuo1 deletion mutant. A zuo1 pdr13 double 
deletion mutant did not show additive phenotypes. Furthermore, a tagged-Zuo1p 
was co-immunoprecipitated with a tagged-Pdr13p. Taken together, we propose that 
Pdr13p and Zuo1p are a new pair of Hsp70:Hsp40 molecular chaperones. In 
addition, Pdr13p co-sedimented with translating ribosomes and this association 
was independent of the presence of Zuo1p.
