BACKGROUND: Spastin significantly influences microtubule regulation in neurons 
and is implicated in the pathogenesis of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). 
However, post-translational regulation of the spastin protein remains nebulous. 
The association between E3 ubiquitin ligase and spastin provides a potential 
therapeutic strategy.
RESULTS: As evidenced by protein chip analysis, FBXL17 inversely correlated with 
SPAST-M1 at the protein level in vitro and, also in vivo during embryonic 
developmental stage. SPAST-M1 protein interacted with FBXL17 specifically via 
the BTB domain at the N-terminus of SPAST-M1. The SCFFBXL17 E3 ubiquitin ligase 
complex degraded SPAST-M1 protein in the nuclear fraction in a 
proteasome-dependent manner. SPAST phosphorylation occurred only in the 
cytoplasmic fraction by CK2 and was involved in poly-ubiquitination. Inhibition 
of SCFFBXL17 E3 ubiquitin ligase by small chemical and FBXL17 shRNA decreased 
proteasome-dependent degradation of SPAST-M1 and induced axonal extension. The 
SPAST Y52C mutant, harboring abnormality in BTB domain could not interact with 
FBXL17, thereby escaping protein regulation by the SCFFBXL17 E3 ubiquitin ligase 
complex, resulting in loss of functionality with aberrant quantity. Although 
this mutant showed shortening of axonal outgrowth, low rate proliferation, and 
poor differentiation capacity in a 3D model, this phenotype was rescued by 
inhibiting SCFFBXL17 E3 ubiquitin ligase.
CONCLUSIONS: We discovered that a novel pathway, FBXL17-SPAST was involved in 
pathogenicity of HSP by the loss of function and the quantitative regulation. 
This result suggested that targeting FBXL17 could provide new insight into HSP 
therapeutics.
