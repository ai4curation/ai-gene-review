Isolation and dissection of native multiprotein complexes is a central theme in 
functional genomics. The development of the tandem affinity purification (TAP) 
tag has enabled an efficient and large-scale purification of native protein 
complexes. However, the TAP tag features a size of 21 kDa and requires time 
consuming cleavage. By combining a tandem Strep-tag II with a FLAG-tag we were 
able to reduce the size of the TAP (SF-TAP) tag to 4.6 kDa. Both moieties have a 
medium affinity and avidity to their immobilised binding partners. This allows 
the elution of SF-tagged proteins under native conditions using desthiobiotin in 
the first step and the FLAG octapeptide in the second step. The SF-TAP protocol 
represents an efficient, fast and straightforward purification of protein 
complexes from mammalian cells within 2.5 h. The power of this novel method is 
demonstrated by the purification of Raf associated protein complexes from HEK293 
cells and subsequent analysis of their protein interaction network by dissection 
of interaction patterns from the Raf binding partners MEK1 and 14-3-3.
