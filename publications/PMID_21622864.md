Human studies using Abs to two different, nonoverlapping epitopes of IL-13 
suggested that epitope specificity can have a clinically significant impact on 
clearance of IL-13. We propose that Ab modulation of IL-13 interaction with 
IL-13Rα2 underlies this effect. Two Abs were administered to healthy subjects 
and mild asthmatics in separate dose-ranging studies and allergen-challenge 
studies. IMA-638 allows IL-13 interaction with IL-13Rα1 or IL-13Rα2 but blocks 
recruitment of IL-4Rα to the IL-13/IL-13Rα1 complex, whereas IMA-026 competes 
with IL-13 interaction with IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2. We found ∼10-fold higher 
circulating titer of captured IL-13 in subjects treated with IMA-026 compared 
with those administered IMA-638. To understand how this difference could be 
related to epitope, we asked whether either Ab affects IL-13 internalization 
through cell surface IL-13Rα2. Humans inducibly express cell surface IL-13Rα2 
but lack the soluble form that regulates IL-13 responses in mice. Cells with 
high IL-13Rα2 expression rapidly and efficiently depleted extracellular IL-13, 
and this activity persisted in the presence of IMA-638 but not IMA-026. The 
potency and efficiency of this clearance pathway suggest that cell surface 
IL-13Rα2 acts as a scavenger for IL-13. These findings could have important 
implications for the design and characterization of IL-13 antagonists.
