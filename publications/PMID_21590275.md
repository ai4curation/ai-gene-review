Calreticulin (CRT)-1 is a major Ca(2+)-buffering protein in the lumen of the 
endoplasmic reticulum. Human and murine CRT-2 was isolated in 2002, but the 
subcellular localization and function is still unclear. Here, we studied the 
intracellular localization and function of CRT-2 with hemagglutinin-tagged (HA-) 
human CRT-2. Western blotting revealed HA-CRT-2 as a single band at 50 kDa. 
Using immunofluorescence microscopy of cultured fibroblasts and epithelial cells 
transfected with HA-CRT-2 cDNA, labeling for HA-CRT-2 was seen as a reticular 
network with a nuclear envelope pattern that colocalized with calnexin and 
protein disulfide isomerase. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that HA-CRT-2 
was localized in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Stains-all staining, a 
method to detect Ca(2+)-binding proteins, could not stain the immunoprecipitate 
of HA-CRT-2, although HA-CRT-1 immunoprecipitate was stained blue. These results 
indicate that the molecular weight of the non-tagged CRT-2 on SDS-PAGE is 49 
kDa, and that CRT-2, as well as CRT-1, is localized in the lumen of the 
endoplasmic reticulum, but that CRT-2 capacity for Ca(2+)-binding may be absent 
or much lower than that of CRT-1.
