The assembly of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules with 
peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a critical step in the 
presentation of viral antigens to CD8+ T cells. This process is subject to 
quality control restrictions that prevent free class I heavy chains (HCs) and 
peptide-free HC-beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) dimers from exiting the ER. The 
lectin-like chaperone calreticulin associates with HC-beta(2)m heterodimers 
prior to peptide binding, but its precise role in regulating the subsequent 
events of peptide association and ER to Golgi transport remains undefined. In 
vitro analysis of the assembly process has been limited by the specificity of 
calreticulin for monoglucosylated N-linked glycans, which are transient 
biosynthetic intermediates. To address this problem, we developed a novel 
expression system using Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycosylation mutants to 
produce class I HC bearing N-linked oligosaccharides with the specific structure 
Glc(1)Man(9)GlcNAc(2). The monoglucosylated glycan proved to be both necessary 
and sufficient for in vitro binding of calreticulin to MHC class I molecules. 
Calreticulin bound as efficiently to peptide-loaded MHC class I complexes as it 
did to folding intermediates created in vitro, namely free class I HC and empty 
HC-beta(2)m heterodimers. Thus, calreticulin is unable to discriminate between 
native and non-native MHC class I conformations and therefore unlikely to play a 
role in the recognition and release of peptide-loaded complexes from the ER. 
Furthermore, the recombinant expression system developed in this study can be 
used to produce a broad range of calreticulin substrates to elucidate its 
general mechanism of activity in vitro.
