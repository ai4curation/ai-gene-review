Diabetic nephropathies are characterized by glycogen accumulation in distal 
tubular cells, which eventually leads to their apoptosis. The present study aims 
to determine whether adiponectin and AMPK are involved in the regulation of 
glycogen synthase (GS) in these structures. Western blots of isolated distal 
tubules revealed the presence of adiponectin receptor ADIPOR1, catalytic AMPK 
subunits alpha(1) and alpha(2), their phosphorylated active forms, and the 
glycogen-binding AMPK subunit beta(2). ADIPOR2 was not detected. Expression 
levels of ADIPOR1, AMPKalpha(1), AMPKalpha(2), and AMPKbeta(2) were increased in 
streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats, whereas phosphorylated active AMPK levels 
were strongly decreased. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of ADIPOR1 
on the luminal portion of distal tubules and thick ascending limb cells. 
Catalytic subunits alpha(1) and alpha(2), their phosphorylated active forms, and 
the glycogen-binding subunit beta(2) were also found in the same cells, 
confirming immunoblot results. In vitro, 
5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR; 2 mM) and 
globular adiponectin (10 mug/ml) activated catalytic AMPK in distal tubules 
isolated from kidneys of normal rats but much more weakly in those from diabetic 
rats. GS inhibition paralleled AMPK activation in both groups of animals: active 
GS levels were low in control animals and elevated in diabetic ones. Finally, 
glucose-6-phosphate, an allosteric activator of GS, was also increased in 
diabetic rats. These results demonstrate that in distal tubular cells, 
adiponectin through luminal ADIPOR1 activates AMPK, leading to the inhibition of 
GS. During hyperglycemia, this regulation is altered, which may explain, at 
least in part, the accumulation of large glycogen deposits.
