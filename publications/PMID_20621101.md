Protein-protein interactions between the Bcl2 family proteins regulate 
apoptosis. An imbalance of this interaction network due to the upregulation of 
the proto-oncogene Bcl2 leads to a resistance to apoptosis associated with tumor 
formation. Bcl2 overexpression inhibits BAX oligomerization and mitochondrial 
outer membrane (MOM) permeabilization. However, Bcl2 effects on earlier steps of 
BAX-mediated apoptosis are not fully understood. Bcl2 overexpression inhibits 
BAX insertion into the MOM but spontaneously increases BAX relocalization to the 
mitochondria. Also, a physical interaction between BAX and Bcl2 is necessary for 
these two effects to occur. Taken together, these results suggest upregulated 
Bcl2 stabilizes BAX loose binding to mitochondrial membranes, inhibiting its 
insertion into the MOM and consequently cytochrome c release.
