It has been proposed that mutations in copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), 
the only proven cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), induce the disease 
by a toxic property that promotes apoptosis. Consistent with this, we have 
demonstrated that overexpression of Bcl-2, a protein that inhibits apoptosis, 
attenuates neurodegeneration produced by the familial ALS-linked SOD1 mutant 
G93A (mSOD1). Herein, we assessed the status of key members of the Bcl-2 family 
in the spinal cord of transgenic mSOD1 mice at different stages of the disease. 
In asymptomatic transgenic mSOD1 mice, expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bad, and Bax 
does not differ from that in nontransgenic mice. In contrast, in symptomatic 
mice, expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, which inhibit apoptosis, is reduced, 
whereas expression of Bad and Bax, which stimulate apoptosis, is increased. 
These alterations are specific to affected brain regions and are caused by the 
mutant and not by the normal SOD1 enzyme. Relevant to the neuroprotective 
effects of Bcl-2 in transgenic mSOD1 mice, overexpression of Bcl-2 increases the 
formation of Bcl-2:Bax heterodimers, which abolish the Bax proapoptotic 
property. This study demonstrates significant alterations in the expression of 
key members of the Bcl-2 family associated with mSOD1 deleterious effects. That 
these changes contribute to the neurodegenerative process in this model of ALS 
is supported by our observations in double transgenic mSOD1/Bcl-2 mice in which 
the pernicious increase of Bax is tempered by an increase in formation of 
Bcl-2:Bax heterodimers. Based on these findings, it may be concluded that Bcl-2 
family members appear as invaluable targets for the development of new 
neuroprotective therapies in ALS.
