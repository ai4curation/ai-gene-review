The Arp2/3 complex consists of seven evolutionarily conserved subunits (Arp2, 
Arp3 and ARPC1-5) and plays an essential role in generating branched actin 
filament networks during many different cellular processes. In mammals, however, 
the ARPC1 and ARPC5 subunits are each encoded by two isoforms that are 67% 
identical. This raises the possibility that Arp2/3 complexes with different 
properties may exist.  We found that Arp2/3 complexes containing ARPC1B and 
ARPC5L are significantly better at promoting actin assembly than those with 
ARPC1A and ARPC5, both in cells and in vitro. Branched actin networks induced by 
complexes containing ARPC1B or ARPC5L are also disassembled ∼2-fold slower than 
those formed by their counterparts. This difference reflects the ability of 
cortactin to stabilize ARPC1B- and ARPC5L- but not ARPC1A- and ARPC5-containing 
complexes against coronin-mediated disassembly. Our observations demonstrate 
that the Arp2/3 complex in higher eukaryotes is actually a family of complexes 
with different properties.
