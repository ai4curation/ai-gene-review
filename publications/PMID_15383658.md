FKHRL1 (FOXO3a) and p53 are two potent stress-response regulators. Here we show 
that these two transcription factors exhibit "crosstalk" in vivo. In response to 
DNA damage, p53 activation led to FKHRL1 phosphorylation and subcellular 
localization change, which resulted in inhibition of FKHRL1 transcription 
activity. AKT was dispensable for p53-dependent suppression of FKHRL1. By 
contrast, serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) was significantly 
induced in a p53-dependent manner after DNA damage, and this induction was 
through extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2-mediated posttranslational 
regulation. Furthermore, inhibition of SGK1 expression by a small interfering 
RNA knockdown experiment significantly decreased FKHRL1 phosphorylation in 
response to DNA damage. Taken together, our observations reveal previously 
unrecognized crosstalk between p53 and FKHRL1. Moreover, our findings suggest a 
new pathway for understanding aging and the age dependency of human diseases 
governed by these two transcription factors.

FKHRL1 (FOXO3a) and p53 are two potent stress-response regulators. Here we show that these two transcription factors exhibit “crosstalk” in vivo. In response to DNA damage, p53 activation led to FKHRL1 phosphorylation and subcellular localization change, which resulted in inhibition of FKHRL1 transcription activity. AKT was dispensable for p53-dependent suppression of FKHRL1. By contrast, serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) was significantly induced in a p53-dependent manner after DNA damage, and this induction was through extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2-mediated posttranslational regulation. Furthermore, inhibition of SGK1 expression by a small interfering RNA knockdown experiment significantly decreased FKHRL1 phosphorylation in response to DNA damage. Taken together, our observations reveal previously unrecognized crosstalk between p53 and FKHRL1. Moreover, our findings suggest a new pathway for understanding aging and the age dependency of human diseases governed by these two transcription factors.
