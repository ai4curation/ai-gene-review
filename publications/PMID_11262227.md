beta-Catenin is a central component of both the cadherin-catenin cell adhesion 
complex and the Wnt signaling pathway. We have investigated the role of 
beta-catenin during brain morphogenesis, by specifically inactivating the 
beta-catenin gene in the region of Wnt1 expression. To achieve this, mice with a 
conditional ('floxed') allele of beta-catenin with required exons flanked by 
loxP recombination sequences were intercrossed with transgenic mice that 
expressed Cre recombinase under control of Wnt1 regulatory sequences. 
beta-Catenin gene deletion resulted in dramatic brain malformation and failure 
of craniofacial development. Absence of part of the midbrain and all of the 
cerebellum is reminiscent of the conventional Wnt1 knockout (Wnt1(-/-)), 
suggesting that Wnt1 acts through beta-catenin in controlling midbrain-hindbrain 
development. The craniofacial phenotype, not observed in embryos that lack Wnt1, 
indicates a role for beta-catenin in the fate of neural crest cells. Analysis of 
neural tube explants shows that (beta-catenin is efficiently deleted in 
migrating neural crest cell precursors. This, together with an increased 
apoptosis in cells migrating to the cranial ganglia and in areas of 
prechondrogenic condensations, suggests that removal of beta-catenin affects 
neural crest cell survival and/or differentiation. Our results demonstrate the 
pivotal role of beta-catenin in morphogenetic processes during brain and 
craniofacial development.
