Three mitochondria-encoded subunits form the catalytic core of cytochrome c 
oxidase, the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain. COX1 and COX2 contain 
heme and copper redox centers, which are integrated during assembly of the 
enzyme. Defects in this process lead to an enzyme deficiency and manifest as 
mitochondrial disorders in humans. Here we demonstrate that COA6 is specifically 
required for COX2 biogenesis. Absence of COA6 leads to fast turnover of newly 
synthesized COX2 and a concomitant reduction in cytochrome c oxidase levels. 
COA6 interacts transiently with the copper-containing catalytic domain of newly 
synthesized COX2. Interestingly, similar to the copper metallochaperone SCO2, 
loss of COA6 causes cardiomyopathy in humans. We show that COA6 and SCO2 
interact and that corresponding pathogenic mutations in each protein affect 
complex formation. Our analyses define COA6 as a constituent of the 
mitochondrial copper relay system, linking defects in COX2 metallation to 
cardiac cytochrome c oxidase deficiency.
