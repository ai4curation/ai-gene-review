Pancreas cancer cells escape most treatment options. Heat shock protein (Hsp)90 
is frequently over-expressed in pancreas carcinomas and protects a number of 
cell-cycle regulators such as the proto-oncogene Cdc25A. We show that inhibition 
of Hsp90 with geldanamycin (GD) destabilizes Cdc25A independent of Chk1/2, 
whereas the standard drug for pancreas carcinoma treatment, gemcitabine (GEM), 
causes Cdc25A degradation through the activation of Chk2. Both agents applied 
together additively inhibit the expression of Cdc25A and the proliferation of 
pancreas carcinoma cells thereby demonstrating that both 
Cdc25A-destabilizing/degrading pathways are separated. The role of Hsp90 as 
stabilizer of Cdc25A in pancreas carcinoma cells is further supported by two 
novel synthetic inhibitors 4-tosylcyclonovobiocic acid and 
7-tosylcyclonovobiocic acid and specific Hsp90AB1 (Hsp90β) shRNA. Our data show 
that targeting Hsp90 reduced the resistance of pancreas carcinoma cells to 
treatment with GEM.
