The L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1; also known as SLC7A5) catalyses the 
cross-membrane flux of large neutral amino acids in a sodium- and pH-independent 
manner1-3. LAT1, an antiporter of the amino acid-polyamine-organocation 
superfamily, also catalyses the permeation of thyroid hormones, pharmaceutical 
drugs, and hormone precursors such as L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine across 
membranes2-6. Overexpression of LAT1 has been observed in a wide range of tumour 
cells, and it is thus a potential target for anti-cancer drugs7-11. LAT1 forms a 
heteromeric amino acid transporter complex with 4F2 cell-surface antigen heavy 
chain (4F2hc; also known as SLC3A2)-a type II membrane glycoprotein that is 
essential for the stability of LAT1 and for its localization to the plasma 
membrane8,9. Despite extensive cell-based characterization of the LAT1-4F2hc 
complex and structural determination of its homologues in bacteria, the 
interactions between LAT1 and 4F2hc and the working mechanism of the complex 
remain largely unknown12-19. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy 
structures of human LAT1-4F2hc alone and in complex with the inhibitor 
2-amino-2-norbornanecarboxylic acid at resolutions of 3.3 Å and 3.5 Å, 
respectively. LAT1 exhibits an inward open conformation. Besides a disulfide 
bond association, LAT1 also interacts extensively with 4F2hc on the 
extracellular side, within the membrane, and on the intracellular side. 
Biochemical analysis reveals that 4F2hc is essential for the transport activity 
of the complex. Together, our characterizations shed light on the architecture 
of the LAT1-4F2hc complex, and provide insights into its function and the 
mechanisms through which it might be associated with disease.
