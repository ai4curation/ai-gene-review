Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a well established preparation 
enabling quantitative analyses of synaptic physiology at identifiable synapses. 
Here, we report the first characterization of synaptic long-term depression 
(LTD) at the Drosophila NMJ. LTD can be reliably induced by specific patterns of 
tetanic stimulation, and the level of LTD depends on both stimulus frequency and 
Ca2+ concentration. We provide evidence that LTD is likely a result of 
presynaptic changes. Through screening of targeted mutants with defects in 
memory or signal transduction pathways, we found that LTD is strongly reduced in 
the akt mutants. This defect can be rescued by acutely induced expression of the 
normal akt transgene, suggesting that altered LTD is not attributable to 
developmental abnormalities and that Akt is critical for the induction of LTD. 
Our study also indicates that the molecular mechanisms of LTD are distinct from 
that of short-term synaptic plasticity, because akt mutants showed normal 
short-term facilitation and posttetanic potentiation, whereas LTD was unaffected 
in mutants that exhibit defective short-term synaptic plasticity, such as dunce 
and rutabaga. The characterization of LTD allows genetic analysis of the 
molecular mechanisms of long-term synaptic plasticity in Drosophila and provides 
an additional assay for studying functions of genes pertaining to synaptic and 
behavioral plasticity.
