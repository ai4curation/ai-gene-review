The multistep, coordinated process of T-cell chemotaxis requires chemokines, and 
their chemokine receptors, to invoke signaling events to direct cell migration. 
Here, we examined the role for CCL5-mediated initiation of mRNA translation in 
CD4(+) T-cell chemotaxis. Using rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, our data show 
the importance of mTOR in CCL5-mediated T-cell migration. Cycloheximide, but not 
actinomycin D, significantly reduced chemotaxis, suggesting a possible role for 
mRNA translation in T-cell migration. CCL5 induced phosphorylation/activation of 
mTOR, p70 S6K1, and ribosomal protein S6. In addition, CCL5 induced PI-3'K-, 
phospholipase D (PLD)-, and mTOR-dependent phosphorylation and deactivation of 
the transcriptional repressor 4E-BP1, which resulted in its dissociation from 
the eukaryotic initiation factor-4E (eIF4E). Subsequently, eIF4E associated with 
scaffold protein eIF4G, forming the eIF4F translation initiation complex. 
Indeed, CCL5 initiated active translation of mRNA, shown by the increased 
presence of high-molecular-weight polysomes that were significantly reduced by 
rapamycin treatment. Notably, CCL5 induced protein translation of cyclin D1 and 
MMP-9, known mediators of migration. Taken together, we describe a novel 
mechanism by which CCL5 influences translation of rapamycin-sensitive mRNAs and 
"primes" CD4(+) T cells for efficient chemotaxis.
