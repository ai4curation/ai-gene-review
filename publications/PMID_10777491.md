Human damage-specific DNA-binding (DDB) protein can be purified as a heterodimer 
(p48 and p127) that binds to DNA damaged by ultraviolet light. We report here 
the effects of UV irradiation on the cellular localization of each DDB subunit 
as a function of time using green fluorescent fusion proteins in three diploid 
fibroblast strains: repair-proficient IMR-90 and two repair-deficient xeroderma 
pigmentosum group E strains (XP95TO and XP3RO). Although p48 remained in the 
nucleus after UV irradiation, a dynamic nuclear accumulation of p127 from the 
cytoplasm was found after 24 h. In IMR-90 cells, the nuclear localization of 
p127 corresponded to the up-regulation of p48 mRNA and protein levels and of DDB 
activity. XP3RO cells showed delayed but similar kinetics with less transport, 
whereas XP95TO cells appeared to have different kinetics, suggesting that these 
cells exhibit different defects in p127 translocation. We propose that p48 might 
act as the transporter for nuclear entry of p127 but that a third factor might 
be necessary for efficient transportation.
