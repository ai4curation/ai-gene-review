AIMS: We have recently reported that microRNA-34a (miR-34a) regulates vascular 
smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation from stem cells in vitro and in vivo. 
However, little is known about the functional involvements of miR-34a in VSMC 
functions and vessel injury-induced neointima formation. In the current study, 
we aimed to establish the causal role of miR-34a and its target genes in VSMC 
proliferation, migration and neointima lesion formation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Various pathological stimuli regulate miR-34a expression in 
VSMCs through a transcriptional mechanism, and the P53 binding site is required 
for miR-34a gene regulation by these stimuli. miR-34a over-expression in 
serum-starved VSMCs significantly inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration, 
while knockdown of miR-34a dramatically promoted VSMC proliferation and 
migration, respectively. Notch homolog 1 (Notch1), a well-reported regulator in 
VSMC functions and arterial remodeling, was predicted as one of the top targets 
of miR-34a by using several computational miRNA target prediction tools, and was 
negatively regulated by miR-34a in VSMCs. Luciferase assay showed miR-34a 
substantially repressed wild type Notch1-3'-UTR-luciferase activity in VSMCs, 
but not mutant Notch1-3'-UTR-luciferease reporter, confirming the Notch1 is the 
functional target of miR-34a in VSMCs. Data from co-transfection experiments 
also revealed that miR-34a inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration through 
modulating Notch gene expression levels. Importantly, the expression level of 
miR-34a was significantly down-regulated in injured arteries, and miR-34a 
perivascular over-expression significantly reduced Notch1 expression levels, 
decreased VSMC proliferation, and inhibited neointima formation in wire-injured 
femoral arteries.
CONCLUSION: Our data have demonstrated that miR-34a is an important regulator in 
VSMC functions and neointima hyperplasia, suggesting its potential therapeutic 
application for vascular diseases.
