Assemblies of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides are pathological mediators of Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD) and are produced by the sequential cleavages of amyloid precursor 
protein (APP) by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. The generation of Aβ is 
coupled to neuronal activity, but the molecular basis is unknown. Here, we 
report that the immediate early gene Arc is required for activity-dependent 
generation of Aβ. Arc is a postsynaptic protein that recruits endophilin2/3 and 
dynamin to early/recycling endosomes that traffic AMPA receptors to reduce 
synaptic strength in both hebbian and non-hebbian forms of plasticity. The 
Arc-endosome also traffics APP and BACE1, and Arc physically associates with 
presenilin1 (PS1) to regulate γ-secretase trafficking and confer activity 
dependence. Genetic deletion of Arc reduces Aβ load in a transgenic mouse model 
of AD. In concert with the finding that patients with AD can express anomalously 
high levels of Arc, we hypothesize that Arc participates in the pathogenesis of 
AD.
