Transcriptional activation by many eukaryotic sequence-specific regulators 
appears to be mediated through transcription factors which do not directly bind 
to DNA. BmFTZ-F1 is a silkworm counterpart of FTZ-F1, a sequence-specific 
activator of the fushi tarazu gene in Drosophila melanogaster. We report here 
the isolation of 18- and 22-kDa polypeptides termed MBF1 and MBF2, respectively, 
that form a heterodimer and mediate activation of in vitro transcription from 
the fushi tarazu promoter by BmFTZ-F1. Neither MBF1, MBF2, nor a combination of 
them binds to DNA. MBF1 interacts with BmFTZ-F1 and stabilizes the BmFTZ-F1-DNA 
complex. MBF1 also makes direct contact with TATA-binding protein (TBP). Both 
MBF1 and MBF2 are necessary to form a complex between BmFTZ-F1 and TBP. We 
propose a model in which MBF1 and MBF2 form a bridge between BmFTZ-F1 and TBP 
and mediate transactivation by stabilizing the protein-DNA interactions.

Abstract

Transcriptional activation by many eukaryotic sequence-specific regulators appears to be mediated through transcription factors which do not directly bind to DNA. BmFTZ-F1 is a silkworm counterpart of FTZ-F1, a sequence-specific activator of the fushi tarazu gene in Drosophila melanogaster. We report here the isolation of 18- and 22-kDa polypeptides termed MBF1 and MBF2, respectively, that form a heterodimer and mediate activation of in vitro transcription from the fushi tarazu promoter by BmFTZ-F1. Neither MBF1, MBF2, nor a combination of them binds to DNA. MBF1 interacts with BmFTZ-F1 and stabilizes the BmFTZ-F1-DNA complex. MBF1 also makes direct contact with TATA-binding protein (TBP). Both MBF1 and MBF2 are necessary to form a complex between BmFTZ-F1 and TBP. We propose a model in which MBF1 and MBF2 form a bridge between BmFTZ-F1 and TBP and mediate transactivation by stabilizing the protein-DNA interactions.
