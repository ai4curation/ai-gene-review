Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is critical for normal brain morphogenesis and 
may be triggered by neurotrophic factor deprivation or irreparable DNA damage. 
Members of the Bcl2 and caspase families regulate neuronal responsiveness to 
trophic factor withdrawal; however, their involvement in DNA damage-induced 
neuronal apoptosis is less clear. To define the molecular pathway regulating DNA 
damage-induced neural precursor cell apoptosis, we have examined the effects of 
drug and gamma-irradiation-induced DNA damage on telencephalic neural precursor 
cells derived from wild-type embryos and mice with targeted disruptions of 
apoptosis-associated genes. We found that DNA damage-induced neural precursor 
cell apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo, was critically dependent on p53 and 
caspase 9, but neither Bax nor caspase 3 expression. Neural precursor cell 
apoptosis was also unaffected by targeted disruptions of Bclx and Bcl2, and 
unlike neurotrophic factor-deprivation-induced neuronal apoptosis, was not 
associated with a detectable loss of cytochrome c from mitochondria. The 
apoptotic pathway regulating DNA damage-induced neural precursor cell death is 
different from that required for normal brain morphogenesis, which involves both 
caspase 9 and caspase 3 but not p53, indicating that additional apoptotic 
stimuli regulate neural precursor cell numbers during telencephalic development.
