Many cytosolic proteins lacking a signal peptide, called leaderless cargoes, are 
secreted through unconventional secretion. Vesicle trafficking is a major 
pathway involved. It is unclear how leaderless cargoes enter into the vesicle. 
Here, we find a translocation pathway regulating vesicle entry and secretion of 
leaderless cargoes. We identify TMED10 as a protein channel for the vesicle 
entry and secretion of many leaderless cargoes. The interaction of TMED10 
C-terminal region with a motif in the cargo accounts for the selective release 
of the cargoes. In an in vitro reconstitution assay, TMED10 directly mediates 
the membrane translocation of leaderless cargoes into the liposome, which is 
dependent on protein unfolding and enhanced by HSP90s. In the cell, TMED10 
localizes on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment and 
directs the entry of cargoes into this compartment. Furthermore, cargo induces 
the formation of TMED10 homo-oligomers which may act as a protein channel for 
cargo translocation.
