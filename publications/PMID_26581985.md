Latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is a conserved, multifunctional 
protein encoded by members of the rhadinovirus subfamily of gammaherpesviruses, 
including Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine 
gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68). We previously demonstrated that MHV68 LANA (mLANA) 
is required for efficient lytic replication. However, mechanisms by which mLANA 
facilitates viral replication, including interactions with cellular and viral 
proteins, are not known. Thus, we performed a mass spectrometry-based 
interaction screen that defined an mLANA protein-protein interaction network for 
lytic viral replication consisting of 15 viral proteins and 191 cellular 
proteins, including 19 interactions previously reported in KSHV LANA interaction 
studies. We also employed a stable-isotope labeling technique to illuminate 
high-priority mLANA-interacting host proteins. Among the top prioritized 
mLANA-binding proteins was a cellular chaperone, heat shock cognate protein 70 
(Hsc70). We independently validated the mLANA-Hsc70 interaction through 
coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown 
assays. Immunofluorescence and cellular fractionation analyses comparing 
wild-type (WT) to mLANA-null MHV68 infections demonstrated mLANA-dependent 
recruitment of Hsc70 to nuclei of productively infected cells. Pharmacologic 
inhibition and small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of Hsc70 impaired 
MHV68 lytic replication, which functionally correlated with impaired viral 
protein expression, reduced viral DNA replication, and failure to form viral 
replication complexes. Replication of mLANA-null MHV68 was less affected than 
that of WT virus by Hsc70 inhibition, which strongly suggests that Hsc70 
function in MHV68 lytic replication is at least partially mediated by its 
interaction with mLANA. Together these experiments identify proteins engaged by 
mLANA during the MHV68 lytic replication cycle and define a previously unknown 
role for Hsc70 in facilitating MHV68 lytic replication.
IMPORTANCE: Latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is a conserved 
gamma-2-herpesvirus protein important for latency maintenance and pathogenesis. 
For MHV68, this includes regulating lytic replication and reactivation. While 
previous studies of KSHV LANA defined interactions with host cell proteins that 
impact latency, interactions that facilitate productive viral replication are 
not known. Thus, we performed a differential proteomics analysis to identify and 
prioritize cellular and viral proteins that interact with the MHV68 LANA homolog 
during lytic infection. Among the proteins identified was heat shock cognate 
protein 70 (Hsc70), which we determined is recruited to host cell nuclei in an 
mLANA-dependent process. Moreover, Hsc70 facilitates MHV68 protein expression 
and DNA replication, thus contributing to efficient MHV68 lytic replication. 
These experiments expand the known LANA-binding proteins to include MHV68 lytic 
replication and demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for Hsc70 in 
regulating viral replication.
