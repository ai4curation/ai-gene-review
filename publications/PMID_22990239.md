Accumulation of aggregation-prone misfolded proteins disrupts normal cellular 
function and promotes ageing and disease. Bacteria, fungi and plants counteract 
this by solubilizing and refolding aggregated proteins via a powerful cytosolic 
ATP-dependent bichaperone system, comprising the AAA+ disaggregase Hsp100 and 
the Hsp70-Hsp40 system. Metazoa, however, lack Hsp100 disaggregases. We show 
that instead the Hsp110 member of the Hsp70 superfamily remodels the human 
Hsp70-Hsp40 system to efficiently disaggregate and refold aggregates of heat and 
chemically denatured proteins in vitro and in cell extracts. This Hsp110 effect 
relies on nucleotide exchange, not on ATPase activity, implying ATP-driven 
chaperoning is not required. Knock-down of nematode Caenorhabditis elegans 
Hsp110, but not an unrelated nucleotide exchange factor, compromises dissolution 
of heat-induced protein aggregates and severely shortens lifespan after heat 
shock. We conclude that in metazoa, Hsp70-Hsp40 powered by Hsp110 nucleotide 
exchange represents the crucial disaggregation machinery that reestablishes 
protein homeostasis to counteract protein unfolding stress.
