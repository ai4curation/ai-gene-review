Regulation of gene expression by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) is 
essential for proper cell adaptation to extracellular stimuli. Exposure of yeast 
cells to high osmolarity results in rapid activation of the MAPK Hog1, which 
coordinates the transcriptional programme required for cell survival on 
osmostress. The mechanisms by which Hog1 and MAPKs in general regulate gene 
expression are not completely understood, although Hog1 can modify some 
transcription factors. Here we propose that Hog1 induces gene expression by a 
mechanism that involves recruiting a specific histone deacetylase complex to the 
promoters of genes regulated by osmostress. Cells lacking the Rpd3-Sin3 histone 
deacetylase complex are sensitive to high osmolarity and show compromised 
expression of osmostress genes. Hog1 interacts physically with Rpd3 in vivo and 
in vitro and, on stress, targets the deacetylase to specific 
osmostress-responsive genes. Binding of the Rpd3-Sin3 complex to specific 
promoters leads to histone deacetylation, entry of RNA polymerase II and 
induction of gene expression. Together, our data indicate that targeting of the 
Rpd3 histone deacetylase to osmoresponsive promoters by the MAPK Hog1 is 
required to induce gene expression on stress.
