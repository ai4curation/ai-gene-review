Integrin regulation of neutrophils is essential for appropriate adhesion and 
transmigration into tissues. Vav proteins are Rho family guanine nucleotide 
exchange factors that become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to adhesion. 
Using Vav1/Vav3-deficient neutrophils (Vav1/3ko), we show that Vav proteins are 
required for multiple beta2 integrin-dependent functions, including sustained 
adhesion, spreading, and complement-mediated phagocytosis. These defects are not 
attributable to a lack of initial beta2 activation as Vav1/3ko neutrophils 
undergo chemoattractant-induced arrest on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 
under flow. Accordingly, in vivo, Vav1/3ko leukocytes arrest on venular 
endothelium yet are unable to sustain adherence. Thus, Vav proteins are 
specifically required for stable adhesion. beta2-induced activation of Cdc42, 
Rac1, and RhoA is defective in Vav1/3ko neutrophils, and phosphorylation of 
Pyk2, paxillin, and Akt is also significantly reduced. In contrast, Vav proteins 
are largely dispensable for G protein-coupled receptor-induced signaling events 
and chemotaxis. Thus, Vav proteins play an essential role coupling beta2 to Rho 
GTPases and regulating multiple integrin-induced events important in leukocyte 
adhesion and phagocytosis.
