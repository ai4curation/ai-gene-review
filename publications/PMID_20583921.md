BACKGROUND: T cell differentiation determines susceptibility and resistance to 
experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis, yet mixed T1/Th2 responses characterize 
the clinical spectrum of human infection with Leishmania (Viannia) species.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To discern the interrelationship of T cell 
differentiation and outcome of human infection, we examined factors that 
regulate T cell differentiation and Th1/Th2 cytokine responses in asymptomatic 
infection, active and historical chronic and recurrent cutaneous leishmaniasis. 
T-bet, GATA-3, Foxp3, and cytokine gene expression were quantified by real-time 
polymerase chain reaction and correlated with interleukin 2, interferon gamma, 
tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 4, interleukin 13, and interleukin 10 
secretion during in vitro response to live Leishmania panamensis.
RESULTS: Higher GATA-3 expression than T-bet expression occurred throughout the 
15 days of coculture with promastigotes; however, neither transcription nor 
secretion of interleukin 4 was detected. A sustained inverse correlation between 
GATA-3 expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interferon gamma 
and tumor necrosis factor alpha was observed in asymptomatic infection. In 
contrast, higher T-bet expression and a higher ratio of T-bet to GATA-3 
characterized active recurrent disease. Down-regulation of T-bet and GATA-3 
expression and increased interleukin 2 secretion, compared with control 
subjects, was directly correlated with Foxp3 expression and interleukin 13 
secretion in chronic disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Regulation of the inflammatory response rather than biased Th1/Th2 
response distinguished asymptomatic and recalcitrant outcomes of infection with 
Leishmnania viannia species.

Materials and Methods

To discern the inter-relationship of T cell differentiation and outcome of human infection, we examined factors that regulate T cell differentiation and Th1/Th2 cytokine responses in asymptomatic infection, active and historical chronic and recurrent cutaneous leishmaniasis. T-bet, GATA-3, Foxp3 and cytokine gene expression were quantified by real time PCR, and correlated with IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-13, IL-10 secretion during in vitro response to live L. panamensis .

Results

Higher GATA-3 than T-bet expression occurred throughout the 15 days of co-culture with promastigotes, however neither transcription nor secretion of IL-4 was detected. Sustained, inverse correlation between GATA-3 expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α was observed in asymptomatic infection. In contrast, higher T-bet expression and T-bet:GATA-3 ratio characterized active recurrent disease. Down-regulation of T-bet and GATA-3 expression and increased IL-2 secretion compared to control was directly correlated with Foxp3 expression and IL-13 secretion in chronic disease.

Conclusions

Regulation of the inflammatory response rather than biased Th1/Th2 response distinguished asymptomatic and recalcitrant outcomes of infection with Leishmnania Viannia species.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic disease with a propensity to reactivate, and persistent infection characterize human dermal leishmaniasis caused by species of the Viannia subgenus [ 1 – 5 ]. Subclinical or asymptomatic infection, manifest as cutaneous delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) to Leishmania antigen, occurs with variable frequency in different epidemiological settings [ 6 – 8 ]. Exuberant DTH responses have long been noted in chronic disease, whether mucosal or cutaneous [ 9 , 10 , 11 ], and the inflammatory response has been clinically [ 12 ] and experimentally linked with activation of subclinical infection and pathogenesis [ 13 , 14 ]. Although the host response to infection is known to be a primary determinant of the outcome of infection, the immunological mechanisms that are conducive to non-healing dermal disease versus asymptomatic infection in the human host have yet to be deciphered.

Contrary to the dichotomy of protective Th1 and non-healing Th2 responses induced by L. major infection in mouse models of cutaneous leishmaniasis [ 15 , 16 ], a mixed Th1/Th2 response is found across the spectrum of human infection with L. (Viannia) species [ 9 , 17 , 18 ]. In vitro and in situ analyses of cytokine responses during active human dermal Leishmaniasis including localized disease caused by L. mexicana have revealed diverse profiles of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines, however no clear or consistent bias towards one or the other [ 19 , 20 – 22 ]. Marked cutaneous hypersensitivity generally characterizes mucosal disease [ 10 , 11 ] and has been linked with a poorly regulated Th1- like proinflammatory response, yet occurs in the presence of Th2 cytokines [ 23 ]. Differentiation of the T cell response and its impact on pathogenesis or protection from disease in human dermal leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania of the Viannia subgenus, or indeed any species of Leishmania , has not been discernable based on cytokine production alone.

Transcription factors T-bet, GATA-3 and Foxp3 are master regulators of Th1, Th2 and T regulatory cell development respectively. These factors cross regulate one another and are selectively expressed in the corresponding cell populations [ 24 – 27 ]. T-bet modulates GATA-3 function and Th2 cytokines block Th1 differentiation [ 28 ]. Additionally, GATA-3 has recently been shown to inhibit Foxp3 transcription by binding to the Foxp3 gene promoter [ 29 ]. The interrelationship of these molecules and the effector responses that they regulate define the host response and could therefore, determine the clinical outcome of infection.

This study evaluated the interplay of transcription factors regulating T cell differentiation and Th1/Th2 cytokines in the outcome of human infection with Leishmania (Viannia) species.

Discussion

This study revealed distinctive interrelationships between transcription factors that regulate T cell differentiation, and cytokine gene expression and secretion during asymptomatic infection, active chronic and recurrent disease, and following clinical resolution of the latter disease presentations. Differences in T cell differentiation in relation with clinical outcomes were not discernable by cytokine gene transcription or secretion alone. The results also established that IL-4 was not induced during in vitro recall in human infection with L. panamensis , rather IL-13.

Asymptomatic infection was distinguished by a controlled pro-inflammatory response that was inversely correlated with GATA-3 transcription, and positively correlated with the T-bet/β-actin to GATA-3/β-actin ratio. This finding concurs with the report of lower pro-inflammatory cytokines in asymptomatic infection with L. braziliensis [ 18 ]. Validation of the inverse relationship between GATA-3 expression and secretion of TNF-α and IFN-γ as a marker of clinical resistance could provide a correlate of protective response.

Although both active chronic and recurrent disease presented mixed Th1/Th2 cytokine responses, concomitant analysis of transcription factor expression yielded evidence of ongoing negative regulation of the pro-inflammatory response in chronic disease, and positive regulation in recurrent disease. High IL-2 secretion was elicited in PBMCs during active chronic disease, and IL-2 correlated with Foxp3 expression. In contrast, T-bet transcription and the T-bet/β-actin to GATA-3/β-actin ratio were highest in active recurrent disease. These findings indicate involvement of distinct immunoregulatory mechanisms in these two “non-healing” manifestations of human cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania (Viannia) species. Mucosal leishmaniasis, which is also a non-healing manifestation if untreated, has been associated with defective regulation of a Th1 type CD4 mediated response [ 23 ].

IL-2 has recently been shown to participate in the induction of the negative transcriptional regulator Foxp3, Treg cell development, expansion and maintenance [ 35 – 37 ]. The positive correlation between IL-2 and Foxp3 in active chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis in this study is consistent with this finding and encourages the investigation of the participation of Treg cells during chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis. In experimental infection of BALB/c mice with L. major , IFN-γ producing CD4 + CD25 − effector lymphocytes and Treg cells (Foxp3+, CD4+CD25+) producing IL-10 accumulated in the pro-inflammatory site of infection [ 38 ]. IL-10-producing CD4 + CD25 − Foxp3 − Th1 cells are also an important source of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and contribute to the persistence of Leishmania [ 39 ]. Although Treg cells have been detected in acute cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions [ 40 ] their role in the resolution or perpetuation of human leishmaniasis is unknown.

The prominent expression of T-bet and high T-bet/β-actin to GATA-3/β-actin ratio elicited during active recurrent cutaneous disease suggests that reactivation of disease may involve a T-bet regulated shift in response from the immunologic homeostasis achieved during asymptomatic infection or following resolution of lesions. Significantly lower cutaneous DTH responses to leishmanin were found in patients with recurrent disease than chronic disease [ 3 ] and immunosuppressive disease can lead to reactivation of cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis [ 41 ]. However since inflammatory stimuli also induce activation of leishmaniasis, in asymptomatically infected humans [ 12 ] and experimental models [ 13 , 14 ], the observed upregulation of T-bet expression during recurrence could signal an ongoing proinflammatory response.

The profuse secretion of Th1 and Th2 cytokines and low cytokine gene and transcription factor expression elicited by restimulation of PBMCs from donors who had resolved prior chronic or recurrent disease, likely corresponds with a long term memory response. In contrast with primary activation of T helper cells, which requires T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, co-stimulation and differentiation signaling, antigen experienced cells re-express cytokines with only TCR stimulation and cytokine memory [ 42 ]. Supporting this interpretation, transcription and secretion of cytokines were not correlated in the groups of patients with a prior history of disease.

We did not detect IL-4, the principal cytokine driving the differentiation of specific CD4+T cells toward Th2 development, at either transcriptional or protein levels in PBMCs from the different clinical groups. In contrast, IL-13 was detected in all clinical groups at both levels of analysis, perhaps due in part to upregulation of IL-13 production by GATA-3 [ 43 ]. IL-4 has been detected with low frequency or been absent in most reports on cytokine response in human cutaneous leishmaniasis [ 20 , 21 , 44 ]. Infecting species of Leishmania could conceivably influence the repertoire of cytokines elicited and corresponding regulatory mechanisms, however this has not been evaluated. Because IL-13 shares many functions with IL-4 [ 21 , 45 , 46 ] it may effectively replace IL-4 in human cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. (Viannia) species.

IL-4 and IL-13 negatively regulate pro-inflammatory responses, yet IL-13 together with IL-2 enhances IFN-γ production by NK cells [ 47 ], which produce IL-12 and IFN-γ on exposure to live Leishmania promastigotes [ 48 ]. Concomitantly high levels of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-13 observed during the recall response of human PBMCs to promastigotes might reflect such a synergistic effect. The importance of IL-13 in pathogenesis is substantiated by the conversion of resistant C57BL/6 mice to susceptible to L. major by over-expression of IL-13 [ 49 ]. Evidence that IL-13 contributes to pathogenesis has also been reported for human cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. guyanensis [ 21 ]. In the current study, IL-13 was secreted by PBMCs of participants in all study groups but correlation of expression and secretion of IL-13 was found only in active chronic and recurrent disease. This finding does not allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the role of IL-13 in these non-healing presentations. Nevertheless, the relationship of this anti-inflammatory cytokine with T regulatory cells merits investigation since IL-13 as well as IL-4, can induce CD25+CD4+ regulatory T cells from CD25-CD4+ precursors in an Ag-dependent manner [ 48 ] and T regulatory cells produce IL-13 [ 50 ].

This study provides evidence of regulatory differences in the T cell mediated response in humans during chronic and recurrent disease and asymptomatic infection with Leishmania Viannia species. Therapeutic interventions targeting regulatory mechanisms may allow more effective management of clinically susceptible individuals.
