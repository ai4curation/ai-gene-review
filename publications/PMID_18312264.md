The oligomeric AAA+ chaperone Hsp104 is essential for thermotolerance 
development and prion propagation in yeast. Thermotolerance relies on the 
ability of Hsp104 to cooperate with the Hsp70 chaperone system in the 
reactivation of heat-aggregated proteins. Prion propagation requires the 
Hsp104-dependent fragmentation of prion fibrils to create infectious seeds. It 
remained elusive whether both processes rely on common or different activities 
of Hsp104. Specifically, protein reactivation has been suggested to require a 
substrate threading activity of Hsp104 whereas fibril fragmentation may be 
mediated by a crowbar activity. Here we engineered an Hsp104 variant, HAP, which 
cooperates with the bacterial peptidase ClpP to form a novel proteolytic system. 
HAP threads aggregated model substrates as well as the yeast prion Sup35 through 
its central pore into associated ClpP. HAP variants that harbour a reduced 
threading activity were affected in both protein disaggregation and prion 
propagation, demonstrating that substrate threading represents the common 
mechanism for the processing of both substrate classes.
