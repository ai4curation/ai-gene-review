Eukaryotic translation initiation begins with ribosomal recruitment of 
aminoacylated initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA(Met)(i)) by eukaryotic initiation factor 
eIF2. In cooperation with eIF3, eIF1, and eIF1A, Met-tRNA(Met)(i)/eIF2/GTP binds 
to 40S subunits yielding 43S preinitiation complexes that attach to the 
5'-terminal region of mRNAs and then scan to the initiation codon to form 48S 
initiation complexes with established codon-anticodon base-pairing. 
Stress-activated phosphorylation of eIF2alpha reduces the level of active eIF2, 
globally inhibiting translation. However, translation of several viral mRNAs, 
including Sindbis virus (SV) 26S mRNA and mRNAs containing hepatitis C virus 
(HCV)-like IRESs, is wholly or partially resistant to inhibition by eIF2 
phosphorylation, despite requiring Met-tRNA(Met)(i). Here we report the 
identification of related proteins that individually (Ligatin) or together (the 
oncogene MCT-1 and DENR, which are homologous to N-terminal and C-terminal 
regions of Ligatin, respectively) promote efficient eIF2-independent recruitment 
of Met-tRNA(Met)(i) to 40S/mRNA complexes, if attachment of 40S subunits to the 
mRNA places the initiation codon directly in the P site, as on HCV-like IRESs 
and, as we show here, SV 26S mRNA. In addition to their role in initiation, 
Ligatin and MCT-1/DENR can promote release of deacylated tRNA and mRNA from 
recycled 40S subunits after ABCE1-mediated dissociation of post-termination 
ribosomes.
