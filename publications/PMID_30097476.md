OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the methods by which 
neurology physician-scientists are quantified through applying author-level 
metrics to commonly used definitions when discussing funding efforts aimed at 
the attrition of the physician-scientist workforce.
METHODS: Neurology residency alumni from institutions with the highest National 
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke funding were identified for 
2003-2005, and their funding records, publishing history, and impact factor 
(h-index) were obtained via the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools 
and Scopus Author Profile. The group differences of total publications, yearly 
publication rate, and h-index between R01-funded, non-R01-funded, and nonfunded 
individuals were analyzed via analysis of variance models, and a 
publications-per-research hour rate was calculated and similarly compared across 
groups.
RESULTS: From 15 programs, and from a total of 252 neurologists, 186 were 
identified as having demonstrated an interest in research. The mean h-index, 
yearly publication rate, and cumulative number of publications were 
significantly higher in those who eventually received an R01 grant compared to 
those without R01 funding and those with no research funding. Within the top 50 
performers by yearly publication rate, there was an equal mix of the 3 groups of 
neurologists: R01 (19, 38%), non-R01 (15, 30%), and nonfunded (16, 32%). Those 
who were nonfunded (10% research effort) had an estimated 4.9 publications per 
1,000 research hours compared to 3.0 for those with non-R01 (40% research 
effort) funding and 3.2 for those with R01 funding (80% research effort).
CONCLUSIONS: While eventual R01 grant and early career funding pathways were 
confirmed as important components of higher h-index and larger publication 
numbers, the classic definition of a physician-scientist was questioned through 
these findings. Those presumed to be without funding and generally excluded from 
the physician-scientist pool because of lack of protected research time, in some 
instances, outperformed their R01-funded colleagues and had a higher 
publications-per-research hour than those with an R01 and those with non-R01 
funding, when estimating a 10% research effort. This reflects a potentially 
erroneous assumption and indicates the important contribution of these 
neurologists.
