The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway controls a variety of developmental 
processes and is implicated in tissue homeostasis maintenance and neurogenesis 
in adults. Recently, we identified Ulk3 as an active kinase able to positively 
regulate Gli proteins, mediators of the Shh signaling in mammals. Here, we 
provide several lines of evidence that Ulk3 participates in the transduction of 
the Shh signal also independently of its kinase activity. We demonstrate that 
Ulk3 through its kinase domain interacts with Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), a 
protein required for negative regulation of Gli proteins. Sufu blocks Ulk3 
autophosphorylation and abolishes its ability to phosphorylate and positively 
regulate Gli proteins. We show that Shh signaling destabilizes the Sufu-Ulk3 
complex and induces the release of Ulk3. We demonstrate that the Sufu-Ulk3 
complex, when co-expressed with Gli2, promotes generation of the Gli2 repressor 
form, and that reduction of the Ulk3 mRNA level in Shh-responsive cells results 
in higher potency of the cells to transmit the Shh signal. Our data suggests a 
dual function of Ulk3 in the Shh signal transduction pathway and propose an 
additional way of regulating Gli proteins by Sufu, through binding to and 
suppression of Ulk3.
