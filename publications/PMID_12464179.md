Understanding the cell type-specific molecular mechanisms by which distinct 
signaling pathways combinatorially control proliferation during organogenesis is 
a central issue in development and disease. Here, we report that the 
bicoid-related transcription factor Pitx2 is rapidly induced by the 
Wnt/Dvl/beta-catenin pathway and is required for effective cell-type-specific 
proliferation by directly activating specific growth-regulating genes. Regulated 
exchange of HDAC1/beta-catenin converts Pitx2 from repressor to activator, 
analogous to control of TCF/LEF1. Pitx2 then serves as a competence factor 
required for the temporally ordered and growth factor-dependent recruitment of a 
series of specific coactivator complexes that prove necessary for Cyclin D2 gene 
induction. The molecular strategy underlying interactions between the Wnt and 
growth factor-dependent signaling pathways in cardiac outflow tract and 
pituitary proliferation is likely to be prototypic of cell-specific 
proliferation strategies in other tissues.
