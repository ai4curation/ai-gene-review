Detection and identification of transcription factors as interaction partners of 
alien in vivo.

Kob R, Baniahmad A, Escher N, von Eggeling F, Melle C.

Interacting proteins are often involved in the same cellular processes, and thus 
the identification of interacting partners of a given protein with unknown 
function may give insight into the physiological role of this protein. For the 
detection of protein-protein interactions of the corepressor Alien we used a 
proteomic approach comprising mass spectrometry and immunological techniques. We 
assessed solely endogenously expressed proteins. In this study we present for 
the first time that Alien is interacting within a network of proteins involved 
in transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and cell cycle in vivo. In this way 
we detected protein interactions of Alien involving nucleophosmin, ERCC3, 
TRIP11, as well as CRSP3.
