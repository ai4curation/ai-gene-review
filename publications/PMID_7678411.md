Stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) synthase in endothelial cells by Ca2+ influx 
leads to increased intracellular levels of cGMP. NO synthase from various 
sources is known to use tetrahydrobiopterin, flavins, and NADPH as cofactors. We 
studied the effect of interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and 
lipopolysaccharide on tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthetic activities in human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). These stimuli led to an up to 40-fold 
increase of GTP cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16) activity and to increased 
accumulation of neopterin and tetrahydrobiopterin in HUVEC. Further enzyme 
activities of tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis, i.e. 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin 
synthase and sepiapterin reductase (EC 1.1.1.153), remained unchanged. NO 
synthase activity in protein fractions from homogenates of cells treated with 
interferon-gamma plus tumor necrosis factor-alpha was not influenced as compared 
with untreated controls. However, interferon-gamma alone or in combination with 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha significantly increased intracellular cGMP formation 
in intact HUVEC by 50 and 80%, respectively. These stimuli increased 
intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin concentrations up to 14-fold. NO-triggered 
cGMP formation was similarly increased by incubation of otherwise untreated 
cells with sepiapterin, leading to elevated intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin 
levels. Thus, cytokines indirectly stimulate the activity of constitutive NO 
synthase in HUVEC by upregulating production of the cofactor 
tetrahydrobiopterin.
