Protein acetylation emerged as a key regulatory mechanism for many cellular 
processes. We used genetic analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify Esa1 
as a histone acetyltransferase required for autophagy. We further identified the 
autophagy signaling component Atg3 as a substrate for Esa1. Specifically, 
acetylation of K19 and K48 of Atg3 regulated autophagy by controlling Atg3 and 
Atg8 interaction and lipidation of Atg8. Starvation induced transient K19-K48 
acetylation through spatial and temporal regulation of the localization of 
acetylase Esa1 and the deacetylase Rpd3 on pre-autophagosomal structures (PASs) 
and their interaction with Atg3. Attenuation of K19-K48 acetylation was 
associated with attenuation of autophagy. Increased K19-K48 acetylation after 
deletion of the deacetylase Rpd3 caused increased autophagy. Thus, protein 
acetylation contributes to control of autophagy.
