Although the BBAP E3 ligase and its binding partner BAL are overexpressed in 
chemotherapy-resistant lymphomas, the role of these proteins in DNA damage 
responses remains undefined. Because BAL proteins modulate promoter-coupled 
transcription and contain structural motifs associated with chromatin remodeling 
and DNA repair, we reasoned that the BBAP E3 ligase might target nucleosomal 
proteins. Herein, we demonstrate that BBAP selectively monoubiquitylates histone 
H4 lysine 91 and protects cells exposed to DNA-damaging agents. Disruption of 
BBAP-mediated monoubiquitylation of histone H4K91 is associated with the loss of 
chromatin-associated H4K20 methylase, mono- and dimethyl H4K20, and a delay in 
the kinetics of 53BP1 foci formation at sites of DNA damage. Because 53BP1 
localizes to DNA damage sites, in part, via an interaction with dimethyl H4K20, 
these data directly implicate BBAP in the monoubiquitylation and additional 
posttranslational modification of histone H4 and an associated DNA damage 
response.
