Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant neuro 
degrees enerative disorder associated with CAG/glutamine repeat expansion. While 
the DRPLA gene is ubiquitously expressed, neuron death occurs in specific 
anatomical areas of the brain. This predicts that the DRPLA protein interacts 
with other proteins and that these interactions may play a role in pathogenesis. 
Here, we describe a protein that binds to the DRPLA product. One of the clones 
isolated with a yeast two-hybrid system was identified as a human homolog of the 
insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate protein of 53 kDa (IRSp53). The gene 
produced two mRNA forms by differential splicing and encoded 552 and 521 amino 
acids, respectively. The longer form was mainly expressed in the brain and the 
shorter one in other tissues. The products were phosphorylated upon stimulation 
of cultured cells with insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1. Binding of the 
DRPLA protein to IRSp53 was ascertained by co-immunoprecipitation with 
antibodies and also by co-localization in perinuclear oval dots in cells 
expressing engineered constructs. A proline-rich region near the polyglutamine 
tract of the DRPLA protein and the SH3 domain of IRSp53 were involved in the 
binding. An extended polyglutamine tract significantly reduced binding ability 
in yeast cells, but not in in vitro binding assays. The identification of IRSp53 
and other proteins detected by the yeast hybrid system predicts that DRPLA 
functions in a signal transduction pathway coupled with insulin/IGF-1.
