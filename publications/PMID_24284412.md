FE65 is a cytosolic adapter protein and an important binding partner of amyloid 
precursor protein. Dependent on Thr668 phosphorylation in amyloid precursor 
protein, which influences amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein processing, 
FE65 undergoes nuclear translocation, thereby transmitting a signal from the 
cell membrane to the nucleus. As this translocation may be relevant in Alzheimer 
disease, and as FE65 consists of three protein-protein interaction domains able 
to bind and affect a variety of other proteins and downstream signaling 
pathways, the identification of the FE65 interactome is of central interest in 
Alzheimer disease research. In this study, we identified 121 proteins as new 
potential FE65 interacting proteins in a pulldown/mass spectrometry approach 
using human post-mortem brain samples as protein pools for recombinantly 
expressed FE65. Co-immunoprecipitation assays further validated the interaction 
of FE65 with the candidates SV2A and SERCA2. In parallel, we investigated the 
whole cell proteome of primary hippocampal neurons from FE65/FE65L1 double 
knockout mice. Notably, the validated FE65 binding proteins were also found to 
be differentially abundant in neurons derived from the FE65 knockout mice 
relative to wild-type control neurons. SERCA2 is an important player in cellular 
calcium homeostasis, which was found to be up-regulated in double knockout 
neurons. Indeed, knock-down of FE65 in HEK293T cells also evoked an elevated 
sensitivity to thapsigargin, a stressor specifically targeting the activity of 
SERCA2. Thus, our results suggest that FE65 is involved in the regulation of 
intracellular calcium homeostasis. Whereas transfection of FE65 alone caused a 
typical dot-like phenotype in the nucleus, co-transfection of SV2A significantly 
reduced the percentage of FE65 dot-positive cells, pointing to a possible role 
for SV2A in the modulation of FE65 intracellular targeting. Given that SV2A has 
a signaling function at the presynapse, its effect on FE65 intracellular 
localization suggests that the SV2A/FE65 interaction might play a role in 
synaptic signal transduction.
