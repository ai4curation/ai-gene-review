Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that selective interactions between 
the Jun, Fos, and activating transcription factor (ATF) components of 
transcription factor activating protein 1 (AP-1) exhibit specific and critical 
functions in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and 
survival. For instance, the ratio between c-Jun/c-Fos and c-Jun/ATF2 dimers in 
the cell can be a determining factor in the cellular response to oncogenic or 
apoptotic stimuli. Until recently, no methods were available to detect 
endogenous AP-1 complexes in cells and tissues in situ. Here, we validated the 
proximity ligation assay (PLA) for its ability to specifically visualize and 
quantify changes in endogenous c-Jun/c-Fos, c-Jun/ATF2, and c-Jun/Fra1 complexes 
by using, among others, partner-selective c-Jun mutants. Furthermore, we 
examined the levels of c-Jun/AP-1 dimers in cell lines representing different 
types of human breast cancer and found that aggressive basal-like breast cancer 
cells can be discriminated from much less invasive luminal-like cells by PLA 
detection of c-Jun/Fra1 rather than of c-Jun/ATF2 and c-Jun/c-Fos. Also in tumor 
tissue derived from highly metastatic basal-like MDA-MB231 cells, high levels of 
c-Jun/Fra1 complexes were detected. Together, these results demonstrate that in 
situ PLA is a powerful diagnostic tool to analyze and quantify the amounts of 
biologically critical AP-1 dimers in fixed cells and tissue material.
