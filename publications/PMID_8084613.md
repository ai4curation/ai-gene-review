The t(14;18) translocation is found in the majority follicular lymphomas and 
some high grade B-cell lymphomas. This is results in deregulation of the BCL-2 
gene and appears to play a role in oncogenesis. Various numbers of cells from a 
cell line derived spontaneously from a patient with B-cell lymphoma bearing the 
t(14;18) translocation and negative for the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were 
injected by IP, IV, and SC routes into SCID mice. The mice developed lymphoma 
bearing the t(14;18) translocation with as few as 5 x 10(6) cells within 28 
days. This was determined by histological examination. The higher the cell 
inoculation the more rapidly the lymphoma developed. Engraftment of the tumour 
cells was determined by PCR for the t(14;18) breakpoint region on peripheral 
blood samples and could be detected prior to development of overt lymphoma. 
Having established a lymphoma model the cells were treated with antisense 
oligonucleotides to the first open reading frame of the BCL-2 gene prior to 
inoculation of the SCID mice. Control treatments with sense and nonsense 
oligonucleotides was also performed. At 28 days the sense, nonsense and 
untreated cell SCID mice had developed lymphoma, however, the antisense treated 
group failed to develop lymphoma. The findings demonstrate the modelling of 
B-cell lymphoma bearing the t(14;18) translocation and the ability to modify the 
lymphoma process with the use of antisense oligonucleotides to the BCL-2 gene. 
Reduction of the BCL2 protein suppresses the oncogenic potential of these 
lymphoma cells confirming that it plays an essential role in the development of 
malignancy.
