Members of a family of highly conserved proteins, termed 14-3-3 proteins, were 
found by several experimental approaches to associate with Raf-1, a central 
component of a key signal transduction pathway. Optimal complex formation 
required the amino-terminal regulatory domain of Raf-1. The association of 
14-3-3 proteins and Raf-1 was not substantially affected by the activation state 
of Raf.
