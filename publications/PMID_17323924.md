The 26S proteasome is a multisubunit complex responsible for degradation of 
ubiquitinated substrates, which plays a critical role in regulating various 
biological processes. To fully understand the function and regulation of the 
proteasome complex, an important step is to elucidate its subunit composition 
and posttranslational modifications. Toward this goal, a new affinity 
purification strategy has been developed using a derivative of the HB tag for 
rapid isolation of the human 26S proteasome complex for subsequent proteomic 
analysis. The purification of the complex is achieved from stable 293 cell lines 
expressing a HB-tagged proteasome subunit and by high-affinity streptavidin 
binding with TEV cleavage elution. The complete composition of the 26S 
proteasome complex, including recently assigned new subunits, is identified by 
LC-MS/MS. In addition, all known proteasome activator proteins and components 
involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway are identified. Aside 
from the subunit composition, the N-terminal modification and phosphorylation of 
the proteasome subunits have been characterized. Twelve novel phosphorylation 
sites from eight subunits have been identified, and N-terminal modifications are 
determined for 25 subunits, 12 of which have not been previously reported in 
mammals. We also observe different N-terminal processing of subunit Rpn2, which 
results in identification of two different N-termini of the protein. This work 
presents the first comprehensive characterization of the human 26S proteasome 
complex by affinity purification and tandem mass spectrometry. The detailed 
proteomic profiling obtained here is significant to future studies aiming at a 
complete understanding of the structure-function relationship of the human 26S 
proteasome complex.
