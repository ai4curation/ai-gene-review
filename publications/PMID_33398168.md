Degrons are elements within protein substrates that mediate the interaction with 
specific degradation machineries to control proteolysis. Recently, a few classes 
of C-terminal degrons (C-degrons) that are recognized by dedicated cullin-RING 
ligases (CRLs) have been identified. Specifically, CRL2 using the related 
substrate adapters FEM1A/B/C was found to recognize C degrons ending with 
arginine (Arg/C-degron). Here, we uncover the molecular mechanism of 
Arg/C-degron recognition by solving a subset of structures of FEM1 proteins in 
complex with Arg/C-degron-bearing substrates. Our structural research, 
complemented by binding assays and global protein stability (GPS) analyses, 
demonstrates that FEM1A/C and FEM1B selectively target distinct classes of 
Arg/C-degrons. Overall, our study not only sheds light on the molecular 
mechanism underlying Arg/C-degron recognition for precise control of substrate 
turnover, but also provides valuable information for development of chemical 
probes for selectively regulating proteostasis.
