Calreticulin (CRT) is located predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of 
cells, where it functions as a quality control controller of protein folding. 
However, CRT is also a prevalent autoantigen in patients with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE), where its release from the cell may arise as a results of 
dysfunctional apoptosis and inefficient removal of ER vesicles, which are an 
abundant source of CRT and other autoantigens. Indicative of this is the 
presence of autoantibodies against CRT in the sera of 40-60% of all SLE 
patients. Once released into the circulation, CRT might bind directly to C1q and 
we have suggested that this association may result in a defect in C1q-mediated 
clearance of antigen-antibody complexes. It has been previously shown that CRT 
under physiological salt conditions binds to the globular head of C1q. It is 
known that the globular head region of C1q binds to the CH2 domain in the Fc 
portion of immunoglobulin gamma (IgG). The N-terminal half of CRT contains a 
number of short regions of 7-10 amino acids that show sequence similarity to the 
putative C1q binding region in the CH2 domain of IgG. By use of a series of 92 
overlapping CRT synthetic peptides, a number of C1q binding sites on the CRT 
molecule have been identified, including several containing a CH2-like motif 
similar to the ExKxKx C1q binding motif found in the CH2 domain of IgG. A number 
of these peptides were shown to inhibit binding of C1q to IgG and reduce binding 
of native CRT to C1q. Moreover, several of the peptides were capable of 
inhibiting the classical pathway of complement activation. These studies have 
identified specific binding sites on the CRT molecule for C1q and lend support 
to the hypothesis that interaction of CRT with C1q may interfere with the 
ability of C1q to associate with immune complexes in autoimmune-related 
disorders.
