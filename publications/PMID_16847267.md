The MAGE gene family is characterized by a conserved domain (MAGE Homology 
Domain). A subset of highly homologous MAGE genes (group A; MAGE-A) belong to 
the chromosome X-clustered cancer/testis antigens. MAGE-A genes are normally 
expressed in the human germ line and overexpressed in various tumor types; 
however, their biological function is largely unknown. Here we present evidence 
indicating that MageA2 protein, belonging to the MAGE-A subfamily, confers 
wild-type-p53-sensitive resistance to etoposide (ET) by inducing a novel p53 
inhibitory loop involving recruitment of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to 
MageA2/p53 complex, thus strongly down-regulating p53 transactivation function. 
In fact, enhanced MageA2 protein levels, in addition to ET resistance, correlate 
with impaired acetylation of both p53 and histones surrounding p53-binding 
sites. Association between MAGE-A expression levels and resistance to ET 
treatment is clearly shown in short-term cell lines obtained from melanoma 
biopsies harboring wild-type-p53, whereas cells naturally, or siRNA-mediated 
expressing low MAGE-A levels, correlate with enhanced p53-dependent sensitivity 
to ET. In addition, combined trichostatin A/ET treatment in melanoma cells 
expressing high MAGE-A levels reestablishes p53 response and reverts the 
chemoresistance.

Abstract

The MAGE gene family is characterized by a conserved domain (MAGE Homology Domain). A subset of highly homologous MAGE genes (group A; MAGE-A) belong to the chromosome X-clustered cancer/testis antigens. MAGE-A genes are normally expressed in the human germ line and overexpressed in various tumor types; however, their biological function is largely unknown. Here we present evidence indicating that MageA2 protein, belonging to the MAGE-A subfamily, confers wild-type-p53-sensitive resistance to etoposide (ET) by inducing a novel p53 inhibitory loop involving recruitment of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to MageA2/p53 complex, thus strongly down-regulating p53 transactivation function. In fact, enhanced MageA2 protein levels, in addition to ET resistance, correlate with impaired acetylation of both p53 and histones surrounding p53-binding sites. Association between MAGE-A expression levels and resistance to ET treatment is clearly shown in short-term cell lines obtained from melanoma biopsies harboring wild-type-p53, whereas cells naturally, or siRNA-mediated expressing low MAGE-A levels, correlate with enhanced p53-dependent sensitivity to ET. In addition, combined trichostatin A/ET treatment in melanoma cells expressing high MAGE-A levels reestablishes p53 response and reverts the chemoresistance.

Discussion

p53 is an important tumor suppressor, playing a key role in maintaining genomic stability and controlling cell transformation. Thus, it is a common target for several viral oncoproteins such as HPV-E6, adenovirus E1B, and SV40 large T ( 25 , 26 ). Besides the high mutation/inactivation rate of p53 as found in human cancers, p53 knockout mice are susceptible to various enhanced spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumors ( 27 ).

p53 function has been shown to be tightly regulated through many different mechanisms dependent on specific modifications ( 28 ), subcellular localization ( 29 – 31 ), or the cell-cycle phase ( 32 ). Emerging data have highlighted the important role of HDACs in controlling p53 activity whereby the specificity of HDACs in regulating p53 transcription usually requires the assembling of protein complexes. For example, Mdm2, the major p53 regulator, as well as the oncogenic form of PML, PML-RAR, and the metastasis-associated MTA2/PID, have been shown to recruit HDACs to exert their negative control on p53 function ( 33 – 35 ). Here, we have provided evidence that MageA2/HDAC3 is a p53-repressing complex, where the tumor antigen MageA2 acts as p53–HDAC3 assembling protein, giving survival advantage to cells treated with DNA-damaging agents.

The effectiveness of deacetylation-mediated repression complex is based on the well known ability of HDACs to simultaneously affect both the specific transcription factor and the surrounding chromatin ( 36 ). p53/chromatin deacetylation has been shown to effectively repress p53 function. Our data suggest that deacetylation of histones surrounding p53-binding sites should represent the main mechanism by which MageA2 represses p53. Still, we cannot discard a contribution of endogenous p53 deacetylation because no cellular systems are available to evaluate the effects of MageA2 on endogenous unacetylable p53 mutant.

Little is known about the function of MAGE-A proteins. Presumably, the most conserved MAGE-A genes could share some related functions. Early activation of MAGE-A genes in cancer could be due to genomewide DNA hypomethylation, which is a frequently observed epigenetic event during carcinogenesis ( 37 ) and directly associated with induction of tumors in mice ( 38 ). Remarkably, it was recently reported that BORIS protein is able to induce epigenetic reprogramming ( 39 ), behaving as a potent activator for the expression of several MAGE-A genes ( 17 ). In this context, deregulated BORIS (found in numerous human cancers) could induce expression of MageA1, -A2, and/or -A6, possibly contributing to suppression of the p53 response. Correlation between MageA3/6 and MageC1 expression and the plasma–cell proliferating compartment of multiple myeloma was recently reported ( 40 ), pointing to a potential function of MAGE-A products in cell-cycle control of the clonogenic stem cell compartment.

Our work has focused on the mechanistic relationship among MageA2, p53, and HDAC3. However, the scenario on how the expression of MAGE-A proteins confer resistance to p53-dependent apoptosis should become more complex when the respective protein family members are considered. First, as we showed here, different MAGE-A proteins can repress both p53 and p73 function. Second, more than one class-I HDAC could be recruited by MAGE-A proteins ( 14 ) to p53-binding sites. Finally, most cancer cells coexpress several MAGE-A genes, thus increasing their ability to specifically regulate the p53 family members mainly involved in the DNA-damage response (i.e., p53 and p73). HDAC inhibitors therefore should be useful to counteract effects of massive MAGE-A expression at least in treatment of human melanoma.
