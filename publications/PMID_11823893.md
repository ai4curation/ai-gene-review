RATIONALE: The role played by D(1)-like receptors in amphetamine-induced 
behavioral sensitization has been examined using both the D(1)-like receptor 
antagonist, SCH 23390, and the D(1A) receptor knockout mouse (i.e. 
D(1A)-deficient mice). Studies using these two approaches have provided 
conflicting evidence about the importance of D(1)-like receptors for 
amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine: (a) whether 
D(1A)-deficient mice exhibit amphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization after 3 
and 17 drug abstinence days, and (b) whether SCH 23390, which binds to both 
D(1A) and D(1B) receptor subtypes, blocks development of amphetamine 
sensitization in wild-type and D(1A)-deficient mice.
METHODS: In the first experiment, adult wild-type and D(1A)-deficient mice were 
injected with amphetamine (0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/kg, IP) for 7 consecutive days. 
In the second experiment, wild-type and D(1A)-deficient mice were pretreated 
with SCH 23390 (0, 0.15, or 0.5 mg/kg, IP) 30 min prior to being injected with 
amphetamine (0 or 8 mg/kg, IP). After each daily amphetamine injection, mice 
were placed in activity chambers where distance traveled (i.e. horizontal 
locomotor activity) was measured for 60 min. On the test days, which occurred 
after 3 or 17 drug abstinence days, mice were injected with 1 mg/kg amphetamine 
and locomotion was measured for 120 min.
RESULTS: Both wild-type and D(1A)-deficient mice exhibited amphetamine-induced 
locomotor sensitization. Pretreatment with 0.5 mg/kg SCH 23390 blocked the 
development of locomotor sensitization in wild-type mice, but did not alter the 
sensitized responding of D(1A)-deficient mice.
CONCLUSIONS: It appears that D(1)-like receptors are necessary for the 
development of amphetamine sensitization in wild-type mice, while neither the 
D(1A) nor D(1B) receptor subtypes are necessary for the amphetamine-induced 
locomotor sensitization of D(1A)-deficient mice. A possible explanation for 
these conflicting results is that D(1A)-deficient mice may have a compensatory 
mechanism (not involving D(1B) receptors) that allows them to exhibit 
amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization in the absence of the D(1A) 
receptor.
