Heat stress transcription factors (Hsfs) regulate gene expression in response to 
environmental stress. The Hsf network in plants is controlled at the 
transcriptional level by cooperation of distinct Hsf members and by interaction 
with chaperones. We found two general mechanisms of Hsf regulation by chaperones 
while analyzing the three major Hsfs, A1, A2, and B1, in tomato (Solanum 
lycopersicum). First, Hsp70 and Hsp90 regulate Hsf function by direct 
interactions. Hsp70 represses the activity of HsfA1, including its DNA binding, 
and the coactivator function of HsfB1 in the complex with HsfA2, while the DNA 
binding activity of HsfB1 is stimulated by Hsp90. Second, Hsp90 affects the 
abundance of HsfA2 and HsfB1 by modulating hsfA2 transcript degradation involved 
in regulation of the timing of HsfA2 synthesis. By contrast, HsfB1 binding to 
Hsp90 and to DNA are prerequisites for targeting this Hsf for proteasomal 
degradation, which also depends on a sequence element in its carboxyl-terminal 
domain. Thus, HsfB1 represents an Hsp90 client protein that, by interacting with 
the chaperone, is targeted for, rather than protected from, degradation. Based 
on these findings, we propose a versatile regulatory regime involving Hsp90, 
Hsp70, and the three Hsfs in the control of heat stress response.
