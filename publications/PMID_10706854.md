Eotaxin and other CC chemokines acting via CC chemokine receptor-3 (CCR3) are 
believed to play an integral role in the development of eosinophilic 
inflammation in asthma and allergic inflammatory diseases. However, little is 
known about the intracellular events following agonist binding to CCR3 and the 
relationship of these events to the functional response of the cell. The 
objectives of this study were to investigate CCR3-mediated activation of the 
mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 
(ERK2), p38, and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in eosinophils and to assess the 
requirement for MAP kinases in eotaxin-induced eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) 
release and chemotaxis. MAP kinase activation was studied in eotaxin-stimulated 
eosinophils (more than 97% purity) by Western blotting and immune-complex kinase 
assays. ECP release was measured by radioimmunoassay. Chemotaxis was assessed 
using Boyden microchambers. Eotaxin (10(-11) to 10(-7) mol/L) induced 
concentration-dependent phosphorylation of ERK2 and p38. Phosphorylation was 
detectable after 30 seconds, peaked at about 1 minute, and returned to baseline 
after 2 to 5 minutes. Phosphorylation of JNK above baseline could not be 
detected. The kinase activity of ERK2 and p38 paralleled phosphorylation. PD980 
59, an inhibitor of the ERK2-activating enzyme MEK (MAP ERK kinase), blocked 
phosphorylation of ERK2 in a concentration-dependent manner. The functional 
relevance of ERK2 and p38 was studied using PD98 059 and the p38 inhibitor SB202 
190. PD98 059 and SB202 190 both caused inhibition of eotaxin-induced ECP 
release and chemotaxis. We conclude that eotaxin induces a rapid 
concentration-dependent activation of ERK2 and p38 in eosinophils and that the 
activation of these MAP kinases is required for eotaxin-stimulated degranulation 
and directed locomotion. (Blood. 2000;95:1911-1917)
