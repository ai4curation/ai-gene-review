Escherichia coli contains two thioredoxins, Trx1 and Trx2, and a 
thioredoxin-like protein, YbbN, which presents a strong homology in its 
N-terminal part with thioredoxin 1 and 2. YbbN, however, does not possess the 
canonical Cys-x-x-Cys active site of thioredoxins, but instead a Ser-x-x-Cys 
site. In addition to Cys-38, located in the SxxC site, it contains a second 
cysteine, Cys-63, close to Cys-38 in the 3D model. Cys-38 and Cys-63 undergo an 
oxidoreduction process, suggesting that YbbN functions with two redox cysteines. 
Accordingly, YbbN catalyzes the oxidation of reduced RNase and the isomerization 
of scrambled RNase. Moreover, upon oxidation, its oligomeric state changes from 
dimers to tetramers and higher oligomers. YbbN also possesses chaperone 
properties, promoting protein folding after urea denaturation and forming 
complexes with unfolded proteins. This is the first biochemical characterization 
of a member of the YbbN class of bacterial thioredoxin-like proteins, and in 
vivo experiments will allow to determine the importance of its redox and 
chaperone properties in the cellular physiology.
