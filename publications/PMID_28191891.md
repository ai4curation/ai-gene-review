To ensure efficient genome duplication, cells have evolved numerous factors that 
promote unperturbed DNA replication and protect, repair and restart damaged 
forks. Here we identify downstream neighbor of SON (DONSON) as a novel fork 
protection factor and report biallelic DONSON mutations in 29 individuals with 
microcephalic dwarfism. We demonstrate that DONSON is a replisome component that 
stabilizes forks during genome replication. Loss of DONSON leads to severe 
replication-associated DNA damage arising from nucleolytic cleavage of stalled 
replication forks. Furthermore, ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR)-dependent signaling 
in response to replication stress is impaired in DONSON-deficient cells, 
resulting in decreased checkpoint activity and the potentiation of chromosomal 
instability. Hypomorphic mutations in DONSON substantially reduce DONSON protein 
levels and impair fork stability in cells from patients, consistent with 
defective DNA replication underlying the disease phenotype. In summary, we have 
identified mutations in DONSON as a common cause of microcephalic dwarfism and 
established DONSON as a critical replication fork protein required for mammalian 
DNA replication and genome stability.
