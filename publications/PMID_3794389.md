Effect of basement membrane entactin on epidermal cell attachment and growth.

Alstadt SP, Hebda PA, Chung AE, Eaglstein WH.

A preparation of laminin and entactin (Matrix), extracted from the basement 
membrane of the murine cell line M1536-B3 was used to evaluate the effect of 
entactin on epidermal cell attachment and growth in culture. Cell growth on 
Matrix was significantly higher than on laminin or plastic, in the presence or 
absence of serum. In attachment assays, the attachment of cells to laminin (137% 
of control) or to Matrix (158% of control) was significantly higher when 
compared with plastic (p less than 0.01), and the attachment to Matrix was 
higher than to laminin (p less than 0.05). Varying the amount of laminin or 
Matrix used as a substratum showed each enhanced cell attachment to the same 
maximum value (approximately 50% attached cells or 160% of control), but maximal 
attachment was achieved with lower amounts of Matrix (15 micrograms Matrix vs 
15-30 micrograms laminin, p less than 0.05). Inhibition studies with 
anti-entactin and anti-laminin antibodies were used to assay the specific 
contribution of entactin to cell attachment to Matrix. Pretreatment of the 
substratum with increasing amounts of anti-entactin antibody decreased cell 
attachment to Matrix in a concentration-dependent manner, with cell attachment 
to Matrix eventually falling to the same level as that obtained with laminin. 
There was no effect with anti-entactin on cell attachment to laminin or to 
plastic controls, and nonspecific rabbit IgG had no effect on any group. Similar 
experiments were performed using 2 different concentrations of anti-laminin 
antibody. At a low concentration, anti-laminin antibody decreased attachment to 
laminin (to a level equivalent to the plastic control). At a higher 
concentration anti-laminin decreased attachment to Matrix, but to a level that 
was still greater than the plastic control. The anti-laminin antibody had no 
effect on attachment to the plastic control and nonspecific rat IgG in 
equivalent amounts had no effect on attachment to any of the substrata. These 
results indicate that Matrix, containing laminin and entactin, enhanced cell 
attachment above the level seen with laminin alone, and that this effect was 
probably due to the presence of entactin in the Matrix.
