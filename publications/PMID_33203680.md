The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of organ growth and 
tumorigenesis. In Drosophila, oncogenic RasV12 cooperates with loss-of-cell 
polarity to promote Hippo pathway-dependent tumor growth. To identify additional 
factors that modulate this signaling, we performed a genetic screen utilizing 
the Drosophila RasV12/lgl-/- in vivo tumor model and identified Rox8, a 
RNA-binding protein (RBP), as a positive regulator of the Hippo pathway. We 
found that Rox8 overexpression suppresses whereas Rox8 depletion potentiates 
Hippo-dependent tissue overgrowth, accompanied by altered Yki protein level and 
target gene expression. Mechanistically, Rox8 directly binds to a target site 
located in the yki 3' UTR, recruits and stabilizes the targeting of miR-8-loaded 
RISC, which accelerates the decay of yki messenger RNA (mRNA). Moreover, TIAR, 
the human ortholog of Rox8, is able to promote the degradation of yki mRNA when 
introduced into Drosophila and destabilizes YAP mRNA in human cells. Thus, our 
study provides in vivo evidence that the Hippo pathway is posttranscriptionally 
regulated by the collaborative action of RBP and microRNA (miRNA), which may 
provide an approach for modulating Hippo pathway-mediated tumorigenesis.
