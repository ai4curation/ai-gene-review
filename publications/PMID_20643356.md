The mammalian PCP pathway regulates diverse developmental processes requiring 
coordinated cellular movement, including neural tube closure and cochlear 
stereociliary orientation. Here, we show that epidermal wound repair is 
regulated by PCP signaling. Mice carrying mutant alleles of PCP genes Vangl2, 
Celsr1, PTK7, and Scrb1, and the transcription factor Grhl3, interact 
genetically, exhibiting failed wound healing, neural tube defects, and 
disordered cochlear polarity. Using phylogenetic analysis, ChIP, and gene 
expression in Grhl3(-)(/-) mice, we identified RhoGEF19, a homolog of a RhoA 
activator involved in PCP signaling in Xenopus, as a direct target of GRHL3. 
Knockdown of Grhl3 or RhoGEF19 in keratinocytes induced defects in actin 
polymerization, cellular polarity, and wound healing, and re-expression of 
RhoGEF19 rescued these defects in Grhl3-kd cells. These results define a role 
for Grhl3 in PCP signaling and broadly implicate this pathway in epidermal 
repair.
