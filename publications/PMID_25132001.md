Angiogenesis is a hallmark of various pathological conditions and is controlled 
by a variety of angiogenic factors. Blockade of vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) as the most pivotal stimulator of angiogenesis offers a promising 
therapeutic approach for some diseases, typically cancer. In the present study, 
a heterodimeric antagonistic VEGF was precisely designed based on structural 
information of recently-crystallized VEGF/VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2/fetal liver 
kinase 1/kinase domain region) complex. Directed blocking of kinase domain 
region occurs via substitution of a VEGF receptor binding site by two peptide 
segments in one pole, whereas the binding domain of the other pole of VEGF was 
intact. Candidate peptides for substitution were selected considering to some 
sequence and structural criteria. A reliable model of modified VEGF was built, 
refined using molecular dynamics simulation and docked with VEGFR-2. Docking 
analysis revealed that binding affinity of mutant VEGF was notably diminished, 
corroborating our design. Heterodimeric VEGF was expressed, refolded and highly 
purified by two-step affinity chromatography. Dimerization of this antagonist 
was confirmed using some analytical techniques. Spectroscopic studies assured us 
to obtain the heterodimeric form of VEGF. Some angiogenic in vitro assays such 
endothelial cell proliferation and tube formation indicated that this antagonist 
is not only strongly capable of inhibiting angiogenesis (half maximal inhibitory 
concentration of 33 and 24 ng · mL(-1) , respectively), but also showed the 
highest inhibitory effect compared to all other heterodimeric VEGF variants. The 
high anti-angiogenic potency of this VEGF antagonist may allow its future use as 
an anti-tumor agent.
