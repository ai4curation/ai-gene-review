Human chromosome 11p15.5 harbors an intriguing imprinted gene cluster of 1 Mb. 
This imprinted domain is implicated in a wide variety of malignancies and 
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Recently, several lines of evidence have 
suggested that the BWS-associated imprinting cluster consists of separate 
chromosomal domains. We have previously identified LIT1, a paternally expressed 
antisense RNA within the KvLQT1 locus through a positional screening approach 
using human monochromosomal hybrids. KvLQT1 encompasses the translocation 
breakpoint cluster in BWS and patients exhibit frequent loss of maternal 
methylation at the LIT1 CpG island, implying a regulatory role for the LIT1 
locus in coordinate control of the imprinting cluster. Here we generated 
modified human chromosomes carrying a targeted deletion of the LIT1 CpG island 
using recombination-proficient chicken DT40 cells. Consistent with the 
prediction, this mutation abolished LIT1 expression on the paternal chromosome, 
accompanied by activation of the normally silent paternal alleles of multiple 
imprinted loci at the centromeric domain including KvLQT1 and p57(KIP2). The 
deletion had no effect on imprinting of H19 located at the telomeric end of the 
cluster. Our findings demonstrate that the LIT1 CpG island can act as a negative 
regulator in cis for coordinate imprinting at the centromeric domain, thereby 
suggesting a role for the LIT1 locus in a BWS pathway leading to functional 
inactivation of p57(KIP2). Thus, the targeting and precise modification of human 
chromosomal alleles using the DT40 cell shuttle system can be used to define 
regulatory elements that confer long-range control of gene activity within 
chromosomal domains.
