The assembly and function of mitotic spindles require poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of 
spindle components by tankyrase, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase that aggregates 
to spindle poles during mitosis. Tankyrase itself is phosphorylated during 
mitosis, but the kinases involved remain undefined. Herein we report that 
mitotic phosphorylation of tankyrase is abrogated in cells treated with the GSK3 
inhibitors LiCl and indirubin. Moreover, the electrophoretic mobility-shift of 
tankyrase arising from mitotic phosphorylation can be reproduced in vitro by 
GSK3-mediated phosphorylation. Lastly, mutagenesis study suggested that GSK3 in 
vitro phosphorylates tankyrase on S978, T982, S987, and S991, residues that 
comprise two adjacent copies of the canonical GSK3 phospho-acceptor motif 
[S/T]-X-X-X-[S/T]. Collectively, our data suggest that GSK3 contributes to 
mitotic tankyrase phosphorylation, raising the possibility that this 
phosphorylation might mediate some of the established roles of GSK3 in spindle 
assembly and mitotic progression.
