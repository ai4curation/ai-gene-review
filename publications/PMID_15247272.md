Mutations in the Drg1/RTP/Rit42 gene are commonly identified in hereditary 
neuropathies of the motor and sensory systems. This gene was also identified as 
a p53 target gene and a differentiation-related, putative metastatic suppressor 
gene in human colon and prostate cancer. In this study, we show that the Rit42 
protein is a microtubule-associated protein that localizes to the centrosomes 
and participates in the spindle checkpoint in a p53-dependent manner. When 
ectopically expressed and exposed to spindle inhibitors, Rit42 inhibited 
polyploidy in several p53-deficient tumor cell lines and increased the 
population of cells in mitotic arrest. Blocking endogenous Rit42 expression by 
small interfering RNA in normal human mammary epithelial cells resulted in the 
disappearance of astral microtubules, and dividing spindle fiber formation was 
rarely detected. Moreover, these cells underwent microtubule inhibitor-induced 
reduplication, leading to a polyploidy state. Our findings imply that Rit42 
plays a role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and the maintenance of 
euploidy.
