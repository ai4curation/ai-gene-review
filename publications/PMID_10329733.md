The Brn-3a POU family transcription factor has been shown to strongly activate 
expression of the Bcl-2 proto-oncogene and thereby protect neuronal cells from 
programmed cell death (apoptosis). This activation of the Bcl-2 promoter by 
Brn-3a is strongly inhibited by the p53 anti-oncogene protein. This inhibitory 
effect of p53 on Brn-3a-mediated transactivation is observed with nonoverlapping 
gene fragments containing either the Bcl-2 p1 or p2 promoters but is not 
observed with other Brn-3a-activated promoters such as in the gene encoding 
alpha-internexin or with an isolated Brn-3a binding site from the Bcl-2 promoter 
linked to a heterologous promoter. In contrast, p53 mutants, which are incapable 
of binding to DNA, do not affect Brn-3a-mediated activation of the Bcl-2 p1 and 
p2 promoters. Moreover, Brn-3a and p53 have been shown to bind to adjacent sites 
in the p2 promoter and to directly interact with one another, both in vitro and 
in vivo, with this interaction being mediated by the POU domain of Brn-3a and 
the DNA binding domain of p53. The significance of these effects is discussed in 
terms of the antagonistic effects of Bcl-2 and p53 on the rate of apoptosis and 
the overexpression of Brn-3a in specific tumor cell types.
