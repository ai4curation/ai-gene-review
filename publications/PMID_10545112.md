Aminopeptidase I (API) is imported into the yeast vacuole/lysosome by a 
constitutive non-classical vesicular transport mechanism, the cytoplasm to 
vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. Newly synthesized precursor API is sequestered 
in double-membrane cytoplasmic Cvt vesicles. The Cvt vesicles fuse with the 
vacuole, releasing single-membrane Cvt bodies containing proAPI into the 
vacuolar lumen, and maturation of API occurs when the Cvt body is degraded, 
releasing mature API. Under starvation conditions, API is transported to the 
vacuole by macroautophagy, an inducible, non-selective mechanism that shares 
many similarities with the Cvt pathway. Here we show that Tlg2p, a member of the 
syntaxin family of t-SNARE proteins, and Vps45p, a Sec1p homologue, are required 
in the constitutive Cvt pathway, but not in inducible macroautophagy. 
Fractionation and protease protection experiments indicate that Tlg2p is 
required prior to or at the step of API segregation into the Cvt vesicle. Thus, 
the early Vps45-Tlg2p-dependent step of the Cvt pathway appears to be 
mechanistically distinct from the comparable stage in macroautophagy. Vps45p 
associates with both the Tlg2p and Pep12p t-SNAREs, but API maturation is not 
blocked in a pep12(ts) mutant, indicating that Vps45p independently regulates 
the function of multiple t-SNARES at distinct trafficking steps.
