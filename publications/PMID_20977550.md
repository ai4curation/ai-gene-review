UBX (ubiquitin regulatory X) domain-containing proteins act as cofactors for 
CDC-48/p97. CDC-48/p97 is essential for various cellular processes including 
retro-translocation in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, homotypic 
membrane fusion, nuclear envelope assembly, degradation of ubiquitylated 
proteins, and cell cycle progression. CDC-48/p97-dependent processes are 
determined by differential binding of cofactors including UBX proteins, but the 
cellular functions of UBX proteins have not yet been elucidated, especially in 
multicellular organisms. Therefore, we investigated the functions of UBX family 
members using Caenorhabditis elegans, which expresses six UBX proteins, UBXN-1 
to UBXN-6. All six UBXN proteins directly interacted with CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2, 
and simultaneous knockdown of the expression of three genes, ubxn-1, ubxn-2 and 
ubxn-3, induced embryonic lethal and sterile phenotypes, but knockdown of either 
one or two did not. The sterile worms had a feminized germ-line phenotype, 
producing oocytes but no sperm. UBXN-1, UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 colocalized with 
CDC-48 in spermatocytes but not mature sperm. TRA-1A, which is a key factor in 
the sex determination pathway and inhibits spermatogenesis, accumulated in worms 
in which UBXN-1, UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 had been simultaneously knocked down. Taken 
together, these results suggest that UBXN-1, UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are redundant 
cofactors for CDC-48/p97 and control spermatogenesis via the degradation of 
TRA-1A.
