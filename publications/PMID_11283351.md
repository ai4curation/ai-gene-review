Protein-protein interactions play crucial roles in the execution of various 
biological functions. Accordingly, their comprehensive description would 
contribute considerably to the functional interpretation of fully sequenced 
genomes, which are flooded with novel genes of unpredictable functions. We 
previously developed a system to examine two-hybrid interactions in all possible 
combinations between the approximately 6,000 proteins of the budding yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we have completed the comprehensive analysis 
using this system to identify 4,549 two-hybrid interactions among 3,278 
proteins. Unexpectedly, these data do not largely overlap with those obtained by 
the other project [Uetz, P., et al. (2000) Nature (London) 403, 623-627] and 
hence have substantially expanded our knowledge on the protein interaction space 
or interactome of the yeast. Cumulative connection of these binary interactions 
generates a single huge network linking the vast majority of the proteins. 
Bioinformatics-aided selection of biologically relevant interactions highlights 
various intriguing subnetworks. They include, for instance, the one that had 
successfully foreseen the involvement of a novel protein in spindle pole body 
function as well as the one that may uncover a hitherto unidentified 
multiprotein complex potentially participating in the process of vesicular 
transport. Our data would thus significantly expand and improve the protein 
interaction map for the exploration of genome functions that eventually leads to 
thorough understanding of the cell as a molecular system.

Protein–protein interactions play crucial roles in the execution
of various biological functions. Accordingly, their comprehensive
description would contribute considerably to the functional
interpretation of fully sequenced genomes, which are flooded with novel
genes of unpredictable functions. We previously developed a system to
examine two-hybrid interactions in all possible combinations between
the ≈6,000 proteins of the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. Here we have completed the comprehensive analysis
using this system to identify 4,549 two-hybrid interactions among 3,278
proteins. Unexpectedly, these data do not largely overlap with those
obtained by the other project [Uetz, P., et al. (2000)
Nature (London) 403, 623–627] and hence have
substantially expanded our knowledge on the protein interaction space
or interactome of the yeast. Cumulative connection of these binary
interactions generates a single huge network linking the vast majority
of the proteins. Bioinformatics-aided selection of biologically
relevant interactions highlights various intriguing subnetworks. They
include, for instance, the one that had successfully foreseen the
involvement of a novel protein in spindle pole body function as well as
the one that may uncover a hitherto unidentified multiprotein complex
potentially participating in the process of vesicular transport. Our
data would thus significantly expand and improve the protein
interaction map for the exploration of genome functions that eventually
leads to thorough understanding of the cell as a molecular system.
