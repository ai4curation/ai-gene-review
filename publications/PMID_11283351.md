Protein-protein interactions play crucial roles in the execution of various 
biological functions. Accordingly, their comprehensive description would 
contribute considerably to the functional interpretation of fully sequenced 
genomes, which are flooded with novel genes of unpredictable functions. We 
previously developed a system to examine two-hybrid interactions in all possible 
combinations between the approximately 6,000 proteins of the budding yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we have completed the comprehensive analysis 
using this system to identify 4,549 two-hybrid interactions among 3,278 
proteins. Unexpectedly, these data do not largely overlap with those obtained by 
the other project [Uetz, P., et al. (2000) Nature (London) 403, 623-627] and 
hence have substantially expanded our knowledge on the protein interaction space 
or interactome of the yeast. Cumulative connection of these binary interactions 
generates a single huge network linking the vast majority of the proteins. 
Bioinformatics-aided selection of biologically relevant interactions highlights 
various intriguing subnetworks. They include, for instance, the one that had 
successfully foreseen the involvement of a novel protein in spindle pole body 
function as well as the one that may uncover a hitherto unidentified 
multiprotein complex potentially participating in the process of vesicular 
transport. Our data would thus significantly expand and improve the protein 
interaction map for the exploration of genome functions that eventually leads to 
thorough understanding of the cell as a molecular system.

Abstract

Protein–protein interactions play crucial roles in the execution
of various biological functions. Accordingly, their comprehensive
description would contribute considerably to the functional
interpretation of fully sequenced genomes, which are flooded with novel
genes of unpredictable functions. We previously developed a system to
examine two-hybrid interactions in all possible combinations between
the ≈6,000 proteins of the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae . Here we have completed the comprehensive analysis
using this system to identify 4,549 two-hybrid interactions among 3,278
proteins. Unexpectedly, these data do not largely overlap with those
obtained by the other project [Uetz, P., et al. (2000) Nature (London) 403, 623–627] and hence have
substantially expanded our knowledge on the protein interaction space
or interactome of the yeast. Cumulative connection of these binary
interactions generates a single huge network linking the vast majority
of the proteins. Bioinformatics-aided selection of biologically
relevant interactions highlights various intriguing subnetworks. They
include, for instance, the one that had successfully foreseen the
involvement of a novel protein in spindle pole body function as well as
the one that may uncover a hitherto unidentified multiprotein complex
potentially participating in the process of vesicular transport. Our
data would thus significantly expand and improve the protein
interaction map for the exploration of genome functions that eventually
leads to thorough understanding of the cell as a molecular system.

Materials and Methods

The comprehensive two-hybrid screening system has been described
( 10 ) and is summarized briefly below. We amplified each ORF by PCR
using Pfu DNA polymerase and cloned into pGBK-RC, a Gal4
DNA-binding domain-based bait vector, and pGAD-RC, a Gal4 activation
domain-based prey vector. We confirmed that all of these plasmids bear
inserts of the expected sizes by using colony PCR followed by agarose
gel electrophoresis. By our unique transformation procedure using
96-well plates, each bait plasmid was introduced into a MAT a two-hybrid strain PJ69–2A bearing GAL2 ∷ ADE2 and GAL1 ∷ HIS3 reporter genes ( 12 ). Similarly, we
transformed a MAT α two-hybrid strain MaV204K, harboring SPAL10 ∷ URA3 and UASGAL1 ∷ HIS3 reporters ( 13 ), with individual
prey plasmids. Each transformant was cultured in the well of
flat-bottom 96-well plates filled with appropriate liquid media. After
the removal of clones that activate reporter genes even in the absence
of any interacting partners, those left in each plate were collected
into a single tube to make a pool for screening: each pool is thus an
equivolume mixture of cultures containing up to 96 independent clones.
Because some ORFs were refractory to PCR amplification or cloning, we
finally prepared 62 pools for both bait and prey, thereby covering
≈95% of the budding yeast ORFs.

To examine all possible combinations between the pools, we performed
3,844 mating reactions in total by using a multisample filtration
apparatus (Millipore 1225 sampling manifold) to collect both bait and
prey clones onto Millipore HA membrane, on which cells were allowed to
mate. After the mating, diploid cells formed were selected for the
activation of ADE2 , HIS3 , and URA3 reporter genes. Positive colonies were restreaked onto another
selection plate that was supplemented with
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α- d -galactopyranoside to
confirm the activation of the three reporter genes and
endogenous MEL1 gene, another target of the
transcription factor Gal4. The selected clones then were subjected to
colony PCR with primers flanking the cloning sites of pGBK-RC and
pGAD-RC. For the clones that are refractory to direct amplification
from colonies, we isolated plasmid DNAs to use as the templates for
PCR. Amplified inserts were directly read to obtain sequence tags,
which subsequently were subjected to a blast search to decode interactions.

The description and various data for each protein were retrieved
from the Yeast Proteome Database (YPD) (ref. 14 , http://www.proteome.com/databases/index.html ). The data for
interactions between the orthologs and expression similarity were
retrieved from the Database of Interacting Proteins (ref. 15 , http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/ ) and the Biomolecular Relations in
Information Transmission and Expression database
( http://www.genome.ad.jp/brite/ ) of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes ( 16 ), respectively. The software tool to support the
modeling interaction networks has been described ( 17 ).

Discussion

The large-scale two-hybrid analysis is currently the only feasible
approach for comprehensive interaction mapping ( 19 , 25 , 26 ). Its power
has been well demonstrated in this and other studies ( 10 , 11 , 18 , 23 , 24 ). Systematic interaction mapping provides various hypothetical
networks that are biologically intriguing and/or unexpected, as
exemplified by those extracted from our data (Fig. 3 ). These networks
provide testable hypotheses, which eventually would improve our
understanding of the cell as molecular machinery. Such hypothetical
networks or protein complexes also would serve as the most appropriate
targets for proteomics-based analysis ( 8 ).

On the other hand, this study demonstrates limitation of the
large-scale two-hybrid approach as well. The data of two independent
projects fail to largely overlap (Fig. 2 ). The reasons for this small
overlap are not clear, but there are a number of plausible
explanations. First, both projects used PCR-amplified ORFs and some of
them would inevitably bear mutations abolishing interactions. Second,
each project used unique plasmid construct, which may significantly
affect the folding of hybrid proteins: some are folded correctly in our
collection but not in that of Uetz et al . ( 11 ) and vice
versa. However, it is impossible to predict or examine the folding for
each of the ≈12,000 hybrid proteins. Third, strategy and stringency
of the selection was different between the two projects. While we used
three reporter genes and multicopy two-hybrid plasmids, Uetz et
al . used a single reporter and low-copy vectors. Fourth, both
screenings were obviously not saturated. We observed that some
interactions, which had escaped the large-scale screen, could be
detected when assayed in a one-to-one manner using our constructs.
Finally, stochastic activation of reporter genes, more or less inherent
to two-hybrid system, generates false signals, which would appear as
low-hit ISTs unique to each project.

These results indicate that any single IST project is difficult to
complete. For the exploration of protein interactome, it would be
better to have several independent IST projects using different
constructs and to combine their results. It is also important to
integrate the results of an alternative approach for large-scale
two-hybrid analysis, the protein array-based approach, which is
sensitive but rather slow ( 11 ).

These large-scale approaches have, of course, various limitations
inherent to the two-hybrid method itself. The most serious problem
would be its reliability: the two-hybrid system is generally claimed to
show many false positive or biologically meaningless signals. How are
our comprehensive data reliable? To provide a rough estimate for the
reliability, we analyzed our core data composed of 841 interactions
(Table 1 ), which contain 415 interactions occurring between two
“named” proteins from this dataset. Because most of such named
proteins are associated with, at least, the minimum functional
description, interactions between them would allow us to evaluate
relevance of the interactions. Of the 415 interactions, 103 are
previously shown to interact or to occur in the same complex by the
conventional studies, according to YPD. We thus inspected each of the
remaining 312 interactions and found that 85 are likely to occur,
judging from the function of the proteins. In addition, this dataset
contains 24 novel homotypic or oligomeric interactions. We thus assume
that more than half of the interactions in the core dataset are of some
biological relevance.

On the other hand, a number of false negatives are evident. Our
analysis of two-hybrid interaction data deposited in the YPD indicates
that, while providing a huge number of novel interactions, systematic
two-hybrid projects have failed to recapitulate as much as ≈90% of
the two-hybrid interactions that are identified in conventional
studies. Note that this low coverage is not only due to the
insufficient depth of the screening and potential misfolding or
mutations abolishing the interactions, but also due to the use of
full-length proteins, which often obscure a sizable fraction of
interactions ( 10 , 27 ). It becomes increasingly evident that, in many
cases, interaction surfaces are usually masked and become exposed only
when activation signals, such as phosphorylation or allosteric effector
binding, induce conformational change in either or both of the
proteins.

A plausible way to unmask such interactions is to screen
libraries of fragmented preys using the baits that are preselected on
the basis of specific function or structure. For instance, an
exhaustive two-hybrid screening of a fragmented prey library with baits
involved in RNA splicing has revealed a number of novel interactions
which the whole-genome approaches with full-length ORFs have failed to
detect ( 23 , 24 ). Similarly, a computationally directed screen aiming at
the comprehensive analysis of the association between coiled-coils also
has uncovered many interactions, all but one of which escaped the
detection by the genomewide approach ( 28 ). We also performed a directed
screening of a high-quality genomic library ( 12 ) using all of the yeast
Src homology 3 domains and WW domains as baits to identify many novel
interactions (T.I., unpublished results).

However, the success of such screenings totally depends on the
design of baits: some can reproduce all of the previously reported
interactions whereas others not at all. It is, unfortunately,
impossible to tell which boundaries should be used to ensure correct
folding of each domain. Ideally, one should use both bait and prey in
variously truncated forms to maximize the chance of correct folding and
hence successful interactions, although the combinations to be examined
will obviously explode in such screens. Thus, in practice, both
genomewide screening with full-length ORFs and a variety of directed
approaches using conventional fragmented libraries should be conducted
as parts of a continued effort toward the exploration the protein
interactome.

To uncover as many types of interactions as possible, it may be also
effective to use other two-hybrid methods including the bacterial
systems, those based on the reconstitution of transcription by RNA
polymerase III, Ras signaling pathway, and ubiquitin function (see ref. 29 for a review). Emerging technologies such as protein chips ( 30 ) or a
high-throughput mass spectrometric analysis of protein complex ( 8 ) also
would considerably expand our knowledge on protein interactome.

These large-scale projects have been drastically increasing the
number of putative protein–protein interactions in the database.
Integration of these data leads to a huge network involving most
proteins, which may well indicate the crosstalks between proteins, but
is too big to interpret (Table 3 ). Others also noted the emergence of
such a huge network, although they used a combined dataset containing
interactions revealed by both conventional studies and large-scale
screens ( 31 , 32 ). While our analysis indicates that the huge cluster is
not inherent to large-scale analysis, it may be artificially
overextended by the incorporation of low-quality two-hybrid data (Table 3 ). Thus, careful evaluation of the network by the aid of
bioinformatics is necessary. Various approaches would be plausible to
draw useful information from such a huge network. For instance, one may
color each node based on the assigned functional category.
Alternatively, only the proteins preselected for particular functions
are used for network construction, although such restriction may well
miss a chance of totally unexpected discovery. Careful editing of
network models is vital to draw hypotheses worth further pursuit from
the huge network. Accordingly, bioinformatic tools to support such a
process would become increasingly important.

One also should bear in mind that the current network models are
totally lacking spatial and temporal resolution. Several distinct
complexes sharing a common protein component may be artificially linked
with each other in silico . To avoid this, we have to collect
data on the architecture of each native protein complex as well as its
spatiotemporal occurrence. It is also important to know quantitative
aspects of interactions: what fraction of each protein is actually
participating in the complex formation? Such interaction profiling
would follow the cataloging phase in the protein interactome research.
Furthermore, to learn the biology of each interaction, one has to
examine the effect of its disruption (i.e., interaction targeting). The
cataloging, profiling, and targeting of interactions eventually will
allow one to draw a truly functional and dynamic map of
protein–protein interactions that would undoubtedly lead us one step
forward to comprehensive understanding of the cell as a molecular
system.
