Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) causes tissue and organ injury, in part, 
through alterations in tissue blood flow and the production of reactive oxygen 
species. The cell surface receptor signal-regulatory protein-α (SIRP-α) is 
expressed on inflammatory cells and suppresses phagocytosis, but the function of 
SIRP-α in IRI has not been determined. We reported previously that the 
matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 is upregulated in IRI. Here, we report a 
novel interaction between thrombospondin-1 and SIRP-α on nonphagocytic cells. In 
cell-free experiments, thrombospondin-1 bound SIRP-α. In vascular smooth muscle 
cells and renal tubular epithelial cells, treatment with thrombospondin-1 led to 
phosphorylation of SIRP-α and downstream activation of Src homology domain 
2-containing phosphatase-1. Thrombospondin-1 also stimulated phosphorylation of 
p47(phox) (an organizer subunit for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 
(NADPH) oxidase 1/2) and increased production of superoxide, both of which were 
abrogated by knockdown or antibody blockade of SIRP-α. In rodent aortic rings, 
treatment with thrombospondin-1 increased the production of superoxide and 
inhibited nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation in a SIRP-α-dependent manner. Renal 
IRI upregulated the thrombospondin-1-SIRP-α signaling axis and was associated 
with increased superoxide production and cell death. A SIRP-α antibody that 
blocks thrombospondin-1 activation of SIRP-α mitigated the effects of renal IRI, 
increasing blood flow, suppressing production of reactive oxygen species, and 
preserving cellular architecture. A role for CD47 in SIRP-α activation in these 
pathways is also described. Overall, these results suggest that thrombospondin-1 
binding to SIRP-α on nonphagocytic cells activates NADPH oxidase, limits 
vasodilation, and promotes renal IRI.

Abstract

Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) causes tissue and organ injury, in part, through alterations in tissue blood flow and the production of reactive oxygen species. The cell surface receptor signal-regulatory protein- α (SIRP- α ) is expressed on inflammatory cells and suppresses phagocytosis, but the function of SIRP- α in IRI has not been determined. We reported previously that the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 is upregulated in IRI. Here, we report a novel interaction between thrombospondin-1 and SIRP- α on nonphagocytic cells. In cell-free experiments, thrombospondin-1 bound SIRP- α . In vascular smooth muscle cells and renal tubular epithelial cells, treatment with thrombospondin-1 led to phosphorylation of SIRP- α and downstream activation of Src homology domain 2–containing phosphatase-1. Thrombospondin-1 also stimulated phosphorylation of p47 phox (an organizer subunit for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 1/2) and increased production of superoxide, both of which were abrogated by knockdown or antibody blockade of SIRP- α . In rodent aortic rings, treatment with thrombospondin-1 increased the production of superoxide and inhibited nitric oxide–mediated vasodilation in a SIRP- α –dependent manner. Renal IRI upregulated the thrombospondin-1–SIRP-α signaling axis and was associated with increased superoxide production and cell death. A SIRP- α antibody that blocks thrombospondin-1 activation of SIRP- α mitigated the effects of renal IRI, increasing blood flow, suppressing production of reactive oxygen species, and preserving cellular architecture. A role for CD47 in SIRP- α activation in these pathways is also described. Overall, these results suggest that thrombospondin-1 binding to SIRP- α on nonphagocytic cells activates NADPH oxidase, limits vasodilation, and promotes renal IRI.

Discussion

In a myeloid leukemia cell line, SIRP- α inhibits expression of the Nox2 subunit and is associated with decreased hydrogen peroxide production. 54 However, nonphagocytic SIRP- α has not previously been linked directly to pathologic ROS production. Our present results implicate a role for SIRP- α in the stimulation of Nox-mediated O 2 ·− production in multiple nonphagocytic cell types. The data indicate that cells treated with a physiologically relevant concentration of TSP1 demonstrate a SIRP- α –dependent increase in O 2 ·− production. Either siRNA knockdown or antibody blockade of SIRP- α inhibited both TSP1-mediated phosphorylation of the Nox organizer subunit p47 phox and O 2 ·− production without changing basal ROS production, consistent with SIRP- α playing an active role in stimulating O 2 ·− production.

Signaling through SIRP- α is reported to occur via interactions with integrins, 55 growth factors and CD47. 56 , 57 In myeloid cells, SIRP- α phosphorylation has been demonstrated in the absence of CD47. 55 Our data indicate that in nonmyeloid cells, TSP1 stimulates the phosphorylation of SIRP- α and its downstream effector SHP1 through a process that may depend on interaction with CD47. Gene suppression of CD47 by 37% and CD47 monoclonal Ab blockade did not prevent TSP1-mediated activation of SIRP-α in VSMCs. It is still possible that a residual amount of CD47 in gene-silenced cells is still sufficient to mediate TSP1-induced SIRP- α phosphorylation. Moreover, the pharmacologic properties of the employed CD47 Ab has to be more fully characterized using protein binding experiments to determine whether the Ab inhibits TSP1–SIRP- α binding or the Ab modifies CD47–SIRP- α interaction. Interestingly, treatment of murine CD47 null rTEC with 2.2 nmol/L TSP1 for 60 minutes did not stimulate SIRP- α phosphorylation. Also, CD47 null mice treated with a SIRP- α antibody did not exhibit further improvement in serum creatinine after renal IRI compared with isotype control-treated animals. Together, these data suggest an interaction between TSP1 and SIRP- α , and they also suggest an important role of CD47. Indeed, our previous studies showed that TSP1 activates Nox1-dependent ROS production in a CD47-dependent manner. 58 In conjunction with the current data, it would appear that TSP1 could mediate its ROS-inducing effect via several mechanisms, including ( 1 ) parallel activation of CD47 and SIRP- α with these two pathways exhibiting cross-talk or ( 2 ) activation of CD47 followed by downstream activation of SIRP- α . Future studies are required to further delineate the precise molecular mechanisms by which TSP1 stimulates ROS generation.

In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, angiotensin II–stimulated ROS production was associated with increased SHP1 activity. 59 We now find in two distinct nonphagocytic cell types, VSMCs and rTECs, that TSP1 treatment stimulates SIRP- α and downstream SHP1 and increased O 2 ·− production. VSMCs and rTECs, depending on the vascular bed, express both Nox1 and Nox2, and the assembly of both of these enzyme complexes is promoted by the serine phosphorylation of the p47 phox subunit. 60 , 61 TSP1 phosphorylated p47 phox , whereas a SIRP- α Ab blocked TSP1-mediated phosphorylation of this essential Nox organizing subunit, and both the SIRP- α –blocking Ab and SIRP- α siRNA abrogated TSP1-stimulated O 2 ·− production. These data identify SIRP- α as a new, physiologically important activator of Nox-derived O 2 ·− production in vascular and epithelial cells. Further work will define the dominant Nox isoform responsible for TSP1–SIRP- α –induced ROS following renal IRI.

We have reported that TSP1 limits arterial vasodilation via inhibition of NO signaling. 14 , 62 Results from our present study suggest that TSP1 inhibits arterial vasodilation, in part by stimulating pathologic O 2 ·− production. The O 2 ·− scavenger Tempol decreased TSP1-mediated inhibition of NO-driven vasodilation in murine and rat arteries, supporting a role for TSP1 in promoting arterial O 2 ·− production. A SIRP- α Ab reversed TSP1-mediated inhibition of vasodilation, placing SIRP- α upstream in this process. These data obtained using whole arteries are unlikely to be merely the result of TSP1-mediated inhibition of NO bioavailability because before analysis, vessels were rendered endothelial free and thus lacked an endogenous source of NO. Importantly, these data are, to our knowledge, the first to characterize SIRP- α as an acute regulator of arterial vasodilation.

IRI is characterized by defects in tissue blood flow, increased thrombosis, pathologic ROS production, 63 and cell death. 64 We herein identify SIRP- α as a new receptor for the matricellular protein TSP1. These results are also the first to identify a soluble ligand of SIRP- α . TSP1, on engaging SIRP- α in nonphagocytic cells, stimulates NADPH oxidase–derived O 2 ·− production. Contrary to previous work (reviewed by Barclay et al . 2 and Matozaki et al . 65 ), we identify SIRP- α as an activating, rather than inhibitory, receptor in two nonphagocytic cell types, specifically VSMCs and rTECs. In vivo , TSP1, SIRP- α , and SHP1 were induced by and promoted IRI. Consistent with this notion, blocking TSP1–SIRP- α signaling with a SIRP- α monoclonal Ab inhibited IRI-mediated expression of these proteins, lowered O 2 ·− production in cells and tissues, restored NO-mediated vasodilation (in ex vivo vessel preparations), augmented reperfusion blood flow, preserved end-organ integrity, and improved renal function after IRI. Consistent with our previous findings, CD47 is likely to play a parallel and supportive role in this process. Which of the two pathways predominates is still open to question.
