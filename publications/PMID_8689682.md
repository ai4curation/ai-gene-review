A cell-free system based on cytosols of normally growing cells is established 
that reproduces aspects of the apoptotic program in vitro. The apoptotic program 
is initiated by addition of dATP. Fractionation of cytosol yielded a 15 kDa 
protein that is required for in vitro apoptosis. The absorption spectrum and 
protein sequence revealed that this protein is cytochrome c. Elimination of 
cytochrome c from cytosol by immunodepletion, or inclusion of sucrose to 
stabilize mitochondria during cytosol preparation, diminished the apoptotic 
activity. Adding back cytochrome c to the cytochrome c-depleted extracts 
restored their apoptotic activity. Cells undergoing apoptosis in vivo showed 
increased release of cytochrome c to their cytosol, suggesting that mitochondria 
may function in apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c.
