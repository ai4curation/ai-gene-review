HGAL is a newly identified germinal center (GC)-specific gene whose expression 
by the tumor cells correlates with a favorable prognosis in patients with 
diffuse large B-cell and classical Hodgkin lymphomas. The function of HGAL is 
unknown. Previous studies demonstrated that HGAL is dispensable for GC 
formation, immunoglobulin gene class-switch recombination, and somatic 
hypermutation. Herein, we identify a role for HGAL in the regulation of cell 
motility. We demonstrate that IL-6 induces the phosphorylation of the C-terminal 
tyrosine residue of the HGAL protein via the Lyn kinase, and promotes its 
relocalization from the cytoplasm to podosome-like structures. Further, 
IL-6-induced HGAL phosphorylation increases its interaction with myosin II and 
is associated with inhibition of cell migration. Knockdown of endogenous HGAL 
ameliorates IL-6-induced inhibition of cell migration, whereas overexpression of 
HGAL imparts inhibitory effects of IL-6 on cell migration. Taken together, our 
results suggest that HGAL is involved in negative regulation of lymphocyte 
migration, thus constraining lymphocytes to the GC. Inhibition of lymphocyte 
migration might contribute to the less aggressive clinical behavior of 
HGAL-expressing lymphomas.

Abstract

HGAL is a newly identified germinal center (GC)–specific gene whose expression by the tumor cells correlates with a favorable prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell and classical Hodgkin lymphomas. The function of HGAL is unknown. Previous studies demonstrated that HGAL is dispensable for GC formation, immunoglobulin gene class-switch recombination, and somatic hypermutation. Herein, we identify a role for HGAL in the regulation of cell motility. We demonstrate that IL-6 induces the phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine residue of the HGAL protein via the Lyn kinase, and promotes its relocalization from the cytoplasm to podosome-like structures. Further, IL-6–induced HGAL phosphorylation increases its interaction with myosin II and is associated with inhibition of cell migration. Knockdown of endogenous HGAL ameliorates IL-6–induced inhibition of cell migration, whereas overexpression of HGAL imparts inhibitory effects of IL-6 on cell migration. Taken together, our results suggest that HGAL is involved in negative regulation of lymphocyte migration, thus constraining lymphocytes to the GC. Inhibition of lymphocyte migration might contribute to the less aggressive clinical behavior of HGAL-expressing lymphomas.

Introduction

Gene-expression profiling studies identified an expressed sequence tag (UniGene cluster 49 614, Clone 814622, GI: 2210537) that was associated with better survival in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We have cloned the full-length cDNA for this gene and named it human germinal center–associated lymphoma ( HGAL ). 1 Later on, Pan et al also cloned the same gene and named it germinal center-expressed transcript 2 ( GCET2 ). 2 The HGAL gene is located on chromosome 3q13 and encodes a 178–amino acid (aa) protein with 51% identity and 62% similarity to the murine M17 protein. Like its murine counterpart, HGAL is specifically expressed in the cytoplasm of normal germinal center (GC) B cells. Studies in M17 knock-out mice 3 revealed that this protein is dispensable for GC formation, immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation, and class-switch recombination, and for mounting of T cell–dependent antibody responses. However, in contrast to its wild-type littermates, M17-deficient mice exhibited reduced-sized Peyer patches. We have demonstrated that HGAL is also expressed in GC-derived lymphomas and distinguishes biologically distinct subgroups of classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) associated with improved overall survival. 1 , 4 These observations, coupled with the tightly regulated expression of the HGAL and M17 proteins during B-cell ontogeny, restricted to B lymphocytes in the GC compartment, and to their content of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), usually implicated in signal transduction in B and T lymphocytes, suggests that these proteins have a specific signaling function

Herein, we report that HGAL mediates IL-6–induced inhibition of GC B-cell migration. We demonstrate that IL-6 induces Lyn-mediated phosphorylation of the HGAL C-terminal tyrosine and causes HGAL relocalization to podosome-like structures and spike-like filopodia. We show interactions between endogenous HGAL, actin, and myosin II, and delineate HGAL domains responsible for the interaction. We provide evidence that HGAL phosphorylation results in increased interaction with myosin II. Moreover, we demonstrate that knockdown of endogenous HGAL ameliorates the inhibitory effects of the IL-6 on cell migration. Taken together, these results identify HGAL as a physiologic mediator of IL-6 effects on lymphocyte migration and suggest that HGAL expression in GC lymphocytes, associated with previously reported down-regulation of IL-6 production by these cells, 5 may contribute to the control of lymphocyte migration and localization of normal and malignant B cells in the GC microenvironment.

Discussion

In response to antigen encounter, uncommitted naive B cells are activated and undergo a complex maturational process yielding phenotypically distinct subpopulations that form highly organized GCs. Within the GC, B cells undergo high rate proliferation and affinity maturation, are selected by antigen, switch toward advanced isotypes, and finally differentiate into either memory B cells or plasma cells. Recent studies demonstrated that antigen-specific GC B cells are restricted to the GCs, where they move with lower velocity and greater confinement compared with non-GC B cells. 24 The mechanism underlying the altered motility of the GC B cells is unknown. However, it is well established that the maturation process leading to the generation of GC lymphocytes is characterized by tightly regulated suppression or increased expression of specific genes, resulting in a distinctive “GC gene expression signature.” 25 The genes comprising the “GC expression signature” mediate the unique processes taking place in the GC microenvironment. Since several of the processes are exclusive to GC reaction, it is not surprising that expression of some of the genes are restricted to the GC lymphocytes.

HGAL is 1 of these GC-specific genes, the expression of which is correlated with better survival of patients with DLBCL and cHL, but the function of which is presently unknown. 1 , 3 , 4 The mouse homolog of HGAL, M17 protein, was shown to be dispensable for GC formation, immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation, and efficient class-switch recombination. 3 In the present study, we demonstrate that HGAL plays a role in modulating cell motility. We showed that HGAL functions as an adaptor binding actin and myosin II proteins, and demonstrated that its N-terminal portion is sufficient for these interactions. We report that IL-6 induces Lyn-mediated HGAL phosphorylation at its C-terminal tyrosine residue, leads to HGAL relocalization to podosomes, and increases its interaction with myosin II. Moreover, we demonstrate that HGAL mediates IL-6–inhibitory effects on cell migration. The latter may contribute to the recently in vivo demonstrated confinement of antigen-specific GC B cells to the GC microenvironment. 24 Previously, IL-6 was shown to either stimulate or inhibit cell migration, depending on the cellular context. 18 , 23 Cell lineage–specific HGAL expression may at least partially contribute to the reported variability in IL-6 effects on cell migration. Mice rendered deficient for IL-6 exhibited markedly smaller GCs with decreased numbers of GC B cells in response to T-cell–dependent antigens. 26 , 27 Further, IL-6 production markedly changes during B lymphocyte maturation: while naive and memory B cells produce and secrete IL-6, GC lymphocytes do not. 5 Interestingly, the expression of HGAL is complementary to the IL-6 production, since it is expressed at high levels only in GC lymphocytes, at intermediate to low levels in memory B cells, and not at all in the naive B cells. Similarly to the IL-6 knock-out animals, mice rendered deficient for M17 exhibited reduced-sized Peyer patches. 3 Compilation of the previously reported data with the results presented herein suggests that HGAL up-regulation and IL-6 down-regulation in the GC lymphocytes are imperative for paracrine control of GC cell migration and localization by IL-6 that can be secreted by follicular dendritic cells, T cells, fibroblasts, and tangible body macrophages. 5 , 27 Inhibition of GC lymphocyte migration by IL-6–induced HGAL phosphorylation may be necessary for confining B cells to GCs, thus allowing the completion of GC reaction. Indeed, in IL-6 knock-out mice, smaller GCs led to alterations in antigen-specific serum antibody titers. 27 However, similar changes were not observed in M17 knock-out mice, suggesting that additional IL-6–induced intracellular mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of the antibody repertoire.

Although we demonstrate that IL-6–induced inhibition of GC B-cell migration is associated with increased binding of phosphorylated HGAL to myosin, but not to actin, the precise mechanism of the migration inhibition is presently unclear. According to the “swinging lever-arm” model for myosin force generation, 28 small conformational changes in the myosin head are amplified by a lever-arm mechanism to a working stroke of several nanometers that leads to a directed actin-based movement. In the unstimulated cells, the N-terminal portion of HGAL binds to both actin and myosin II heavy chain. Upon IL-6 stimulation, HGAL is phosphorylated at its C-terminal tyrosine residue and increasingly binds to myosin II. It is possible that HGAL phosphorylation may change its conformation and transiently cross-link actin and myosin, thus preventing the directed sliding of the actin over myosin and inhibiting cell motility. Further studies are needed to confirm this model and to elucidate the mechanism underlying HGAL-mediated inhibition of cell migration.

Although our results reveal the first function of HGAL in GC lymphocytes that may contribute to confinement of the antigen-specific B cells to GCs, 24 it is possible that this adaptor is involved in additional processes taking place in these cells. Further, the functions of HGAL protein in the malignant counterparts of GC lymphocytes are still unclear. We have demonstrated that high HGAL expression correlates with prolonged survival in patients with DLBCL and cHL. Whether the latter merely reflects the GC origin of these tumors, or that HGAL has a specific function that predisposes to improved outcome, is unknown. It is possible that HGAL-mediated inhibition of lymphocyte migration may contribute to the less-aggressive clinical behavior of HGAL-expressing tumors. In our initial observations, no correlation was detected between tumor stage and HGAL expression in DLBCL and cHL. 1 , 4 , 6 Additional studies are needed to examine the function of HGAL in lymphomas. Furthermore, it is possible that persistent HGAL overexpression may predispose to lymphomagenesis by confining cells to the GC microenvironment and thus exposing them to high proliferation rates and active mutational machinery. Studies addressing these questions are presently under way in our laboratory.
