Mitochondrial complex I harbors 7 mitochondrial and 38 nuclear-encoded subunits. 
Its biogenesis requires the assembly and integration of distinct intermediate 
modules, mediated by numerous assembly factors. The mitochondrial complex I 
intermediate assembly (MCIA) complex, containing assembly factors NDUFAF1, 
ECSIT, ACAD9, and TMEM126B, is required for building the intermediate 
ND2-module. The role of the MCIA complex and the involvement of other proteins 
in the biogenesis of this module is unclear. Cell knockout studies reveal that 
while each MCIA component is critical for complex I assembly, a hierarchy of 
stability exists centered on ACAD9. We also identify TMEM186 and COA1 as bona 
fide components of the MCIA complex with loss of either resulting in MCIA 
complex defects and reduced complex I assembly. TMEM186 enriches with newly 
translated ND3, and COA1 enriches with ND2. Our findings provide new functional 
insights into the essential nature of the MCIA complex in complex I assembly.
