Abstract

The TRAP/Mediator coactivator complex serves as a molecular bridge between gene-specific activators and RNA polymerase II. TRAP220/Med1 is a key component of TRAP/Mediator that targets the complex to nuclear hormone receptors and other types of activators. We show here that human TRAP220/Med1 is a specific substrate for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. We demonstrate that ERK phosphorylates TRAP220/Med1 in vivo at two specific sites: threonine 1032 and threonine 1457. Importantly, we found that ERK phosphorylation significantly increases the stability and half-life of TRAP220/Med1 in vivo and correlates with increased thyroid hormone receptor-dependent transcription. Furthermore, ERK phosphorylates TRAP220/Med1 in a cell cycle-dependent manner, resulting in peak levels of expression during the G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle. ERK phosphorylation of ectopic TRAP220/Med1 also triggered shuttling into the nucleolus, thus suggesting that ERK may regulate TRAP220/Med1 subnuclear localization. Finally, we observed that ERK phosphorylation of TRAP220/Med1 stimulates its intrinsic transcriptional coactivation activity. We propose that ERK-mediated phosphorylation is a regulatory mechanism that controls TRAP220/Med1 expression levels and modulates its functional activity.

DISCUSSION

The TRAP/Mediator complex plays a central role in regulating the expression of protein-encoding genes by virtue of its ability to functionally interact with both gene-specific transcription factors and the RNA pol II-associated basal transcription machinery ( 32 , 44 , 53 ). TRAP220/Med1 is a key component of TRAP/Mediator in that it targets and anchors the complex to a broad range of NRs as well as other types of gene-specific activators. Accordingly, TRAP220/Med1 ablation in mice is embryonic lethal ( 21 , 72 ) and null embryonic fibroblasts (isolated prior to embryonic death) display impaired cell cycle progression ( 21 ). Despite its pivotal role in cellular growth and development, however, very little is known about basic cellular signaling mechanisms that regulate the functional activity of TRAP220/Med1 and that of the TRAP/Mediator holocomplex. Furthermore, the underlying regulatory mechanisms by which TRAP220/Med1 might be involved in cell cycle progression remain unclear.

It was recently reported that activated MAPK signaling can lead to phosphorylation of gene-specific transcription factors which, in turn, stimulate their binding to the TRAP/Mediator complex ( 52 ). Here we investigated whether the TRAP/Mediator complex itself is a regulatory target for MAPK signaling. We have shown that the TRAP220/Med1 subunit is a direct substrate for activated MAPK-ERK in vivo and precisely identify the phosphorylation sites. With regard to the physiological and functional relevance of this posttranslational event, we have demonstrated that ERK phosphorylation significantly stabilizes TRAP220/Med1 protein expression and occurs in a cell cycle-dependent manner, resulting in peak TRAP220/Med1 expression levels during the G 2 /M phase. Furthermore, we observed that ERK-mediated phosphorylation stimulates the intrinsic coactivation function of TRAP220/Med1 and appears to influence its subnuclear localization.

ERK phosphorylates TRAP220/Med1 in vivo at two specific amino acid residues, threonine 1032 and threonine 1457 (Fig. 3 ). Both sites are located in the C-terminal portion of TRAP220/Med1, the function of which remains poorly defined but apparently does not directly interact with the core TRAP/Mediator complex ( 31 ). The same relative residues were identified in the mouse TRAP220/Med1 protein as in vitro MAPK phosphorylation sites ( 37 ). The same study also reported that mouse TRAP220/Med1 is an in vitro substrate for PKA and PKC, possibly accounting for the basal phosphorylation observed here with the human protein in vivo (Fig. 1 ). We found that ERK hyperphosphorylation of TRAP220/Med1 markedly inhibits protein degradation (Fig. 4 and 5 ), presumably by inhibiting TRAP220/Med1 interaction with the protein degradation machinery. Interestingly, mutation of the two ERK phosphorylation sites into alanine also inhibited TRAP220/Med1 turnover (Fig. 4E ). Analogous observations were reported for the transcription factors PGC-1 and p53 ( 43 , 49 , 50 ), thus suggesting that alanine substitutions affect the association of regulatory machinery involved in protein turnover ( 43 ). The molecular mechanisms and events underlying this stabilization are currently under investigation.

An important mechanism of regulated gene expression in higher eukaryotes involves the quantitative modulation of distinct coactivator and corepressor expression levels in different tissues and in response to various cellular signals ( 17 , 51 ). Therefore, and relevant to the findings reported here, stabilization of TRAP220/Med1 protein expression via activated ERK may enhance or promote transcription from specific genes that are regulated by factors which recruit TRAP/Mediator via the TRAP220/Med1 subunit. Indeed, we found that ERK-induced stabilization of TRAP220/Med1 expression can be directly correlated with increased TR-dependent transcription (Fig. 6 ). It's interesting to note in this regard that TRAP220/Med1 is overexpressed in estrogen receptor-positive primary breast cancers and breast cancer cell lines ( 70 ) that concomitantly express amplified or hyperactivated MAPKs ( 2 , 10 , 22 , 26 ). Given that TRAP220/Med1 plays a key mediator role in estrogen receptor-dependent transcription ( 1 , 6 , 24 , 36 , 70 ), our findings are thus consistent with the notion that TRAP220/Med1 may be a regulatory target for activated MAPKs that ultimately affect the growth, proliferation, and survival of breast cancer cells. Similarly, other specific components of the TRAP/Mediator complex have been shown to be required for transforming growth factor Î² signaling pathways that have essential roles in tumorigenesis ( 25 ).

MAPK-ERK signaling pathways are essential for mammalian cell cycle progression ( 23 ). Although the proliferative role of ERK is best defined at G 0 /G 1 ( 29 ), recent studies using human HeLa cells additionally show that ERK becomes activated late in S phase, remains active through the end of mitosis, and is functionally required for mitotic entry and progression through mitosis ( 30 , 47 ). Despite this work, little is known about the specific molecular targets of ERK during mitotic progression. Importantly, we show here that TRAP220/Med1 is a specific target for ERK phosphorylation during the G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 7 ). These findings thus raise the intriguing possibility that TRAP220/Med1, likely in association with the TRAP/Mediator complex, plays a regulatory role in cell cycle progression, presumably by modulating the expression of genes important for facilitating the G 2 /M transition. Two lines of evidence are consistent with a possible TRAP220/Med1 regulatory role in mitotic cell division in vivo. First, TRAP220/Med1 null mouse embryos are unusually small and exhibit retarded cell growth ( 21 , 72 ). Indeed, the cause of death in a subset of the mutants is believed to be directly attributed to retarded cell growth at very early stages of embryogenesis ( 21 ). Secondly, TRAP220/Med1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (isolated prior to embryonic death) display impaired cell cycle progression in growth and mitogenicity assays ( 21 ). Future studies will be directed toward determining the specific genes regulated by TRAP/Mediator at G 2 /M and understanding how their expression is affected by activated MAPK-ERK signaling.

Although previous reports showed that phosphokinases can influence the import and export of distinct coregulatory factors to and from the nucleus ( 17 , 18 , 62 , 64 ), we found that TRAP220/Med1 resides predominantly inside the nucleus in both the presence and absence of activated ERK. Surprisingly, however, we found that activated ERK triggered the translocation of a subset ectopically expressed TRAP220/Med1 protein into the nucleolus (Fig. 8 ). While the physiological implications of these data remain unclear, our findings are suggestive of a possible novel role for TRAP220/Med1 (and possibly other TRAP/Mediator subunits) in RNA pol I-mediated transcription of the ribosomal DNA gene. Consistent with this view, other transcription factors generally associated with RNA pol II transcription (e.g., TFIIH and TAF1) were recently shown to also mediate RNA pol I transcription (reviewed in reference 15 ). Moreover, and consistent with a specific role for phosphorylated TRAP220/Med1, nucleolar ribosomal gene expression is markedly activated by ERK ( 69 ). On the other hand, activated ERK might sequester TRAP220/Med1 (and possibly other TRAP/Mediator subunits) in the nucleolus as part of a novel regulatory mechanism. Indeed, numerous other nuclear cofactors and enzymes (e.g., ARF, MDM2, telomerase, and cdc14) are functionally regulated via MAPK-dependent sequestration into the nucleolus (reviewed in reference 7 ). Clearly more experimentation will need to be carried out in order to investigate these possibilities.

While increased protein stability likely plays an important role in the activation of TRAP220/Med1, our findings suggest that MAPK-ERK activates the TRAP220/Med1 protein via additional mechanisms. For example, the phosphorylation-deficient TRAP220/Med1 double-mutant allele had similar stability and accumulated to comparably high levels as the wild-type phosphorylated protein, yet was not nearly as potent in activating transcription (Fig. 9 ). These results suggest ERK-mediated phosphorylation activates intrinsic TRAP220/Med1 transcriptional activity, possibly by enhancing direct TRAP220/Med1 interactions with other gene-specific activators or other TRAP/Mediator subunits, or possibly by promoting interactions with other novel gene-specific cofactors (e.g., PGC-1 and PARP-1) not stably associated with the TRAP/Mediator complex ( 40 , 59 ). Alternatively, it is conceivable that phosphorylation might activate an as-of-yet uncharacterized functional activity of TRAP220/Med1 protein that serves to stimulate transcription. In sum, our findings suggest that activated MAPK-ERK signaling pathways trigger regulatory phosphorylation events that regulate the functional activity of TRAP220/Med1 at multiple levels.
