The formation of acinar and ductal structures during epithelial tissue branching morphogenesis is not well understood. We report that in the mouse submandibular gland (SMG), acinar and ductal cell fates are determined early in embryonic morphogenesis with E-cadherin playing pivotal roles in development. We identified two morphologically distinct cell populations at the single bud stage, destined for different functions. The outer layer of columnar cells with organized E-cadherin junctions expressed the neonatal acinar marker B1 by E13.5, demonstrating their acinar fate. The interior cells initially lacked distinct E-cadherin junctions, but with morphogenesis formed cytokeratin 7 (K7) -positive ductal structures with organized E-cadherin junctions and F-actin filaments. Inhibition of E-cadherin function with either siRNA or function blocking antibody caused extensive apoptosis of ductal cells and aberrantly dilated lumens, providing the first evidence that E-cadherin regulates ductal lumen formation during branching morphogenesis of the salivary gland.

INTRODUCTION

Interactions between neighboring cells are central to the morphogenetic changes that guide eukaryotic tissue remodeling and differentiation ( Jamora and Fuchs, 2002 ; Gumbiner, 2005 ). In epithelial tissues, these interactions are mediated, for the most part by, E-cadherin, a member of the type I classical cadherin family. E-cadherin is a single span transmembrane protein consisting of 5 extracellular cadherin repeats (EC domains) and a short cytoplasmic domain that associates with members of the catenin family. E-cadherin forms calcium-dependent homotypic cell–cell adhesion structures known as adherens junctions (AJs) that mediate intercellular adhesion through dynamic interactions with the actin cytoskeleton ( Hirano et al., 1987 ). In addition to providing intercellular adhesion, AJs regulate cell polarity, cell–cell communication, cell survival, cell differentiation, and tissue development ( Grunwald, 1993 ; Marrs and Nelson, 1996 ; Wheelock and Johnson, 2003 ; Halbleib and Nelson, 2006 ). AJs provide instructive signals in the morphogenetic processes by which an epithelial sheet forms a specialized three-dimensional structure ( Takeichi, 1991 ; Nakagawa and Takeichi, 1995 ; Jamora and Fuchs, 2002 ; Gumbiner, 2005 ; Halbleib and Nelson, 2006 ). Furthermore, AJs function in the establishment and maintenance of differentiated tissue architecture ( Gumbiner, 1996 , 2005 ; Wheelock and Johnson, 2003 ; Halbleib and Nelson, 2006 ).

The submandibular gland (SMG) belongs to a group of epithelial tissues that develop through a series of morphogenetic changes collectively referred to as branching morphogenesis ( Bernfield et al., 1984 ; Hieda and Nakanishi, 1997; Fernandes et al., 1999 ; Jaskoll and Melnick, 1999 ; Patel et al., 2006 ). The SMG has long been regarded as a model for branching morphogenesis, and in recent years it has become a valuable tool for the identification of key regulators and molecular mechanisms underlying this developmental process. In particular, the ability to grow early embryonic SMGs in organ culture, an ex vivo system that closely reproduces in vivo branching morphogenesis, has proven instrumental to the unraveling of some aspects of this process ( Kashimata et al., 2000 ; Sakai et al., 2003 ). In the mouse, SMG development begins at embryonic day 11 (E11) as an epithelial thickening that gives rise to the initial bud structure by E12.5. The initial bud subsequently grows and undergoes rounds of clefting and new bud formation leading to extensive branching into the surrounding mandibular mesenchyme. As morphogenesis progresses, regions of the branching epithelium undergo cytodifferentiation, eventually giving rise to a tree-like structure consisting of differentiated terminal secretory units, the acini, and an array of secondary ducts that empty into the principal excretory duct and ultimately into the oral cavity ( Denny et al., 1997 ; Jaskoll and Melnick, 1999 ; Patel et al., 2006 ).

To date, several studies have shown a pivotal role for E-cadherin in salivary gland morphogenesis. Disruption of E-cadherin cell– cell adhesion by modulating Rac function in Drosophila interfered with proper salivary gland development ( Pirraglia et al., 2006 ). Recent studies in which SMG buds were reconstructed from isolated SMG cells provided evidence that E-cadherin junctions contributed to the structural organization of the gland and its ability to undergo branching morphogenesis ( Wei et al., 2007 ). Therefore, an in depth knowledge of how E-cadherin-mediated adhesion impacts SMG development will have important implications for the general understanding of epithelial tissue development through branching morphogenesis.

We have undertaken detailed analyses of E-cadherin and its junctional proteins’ localization and actin cytoskeletal association from the initial bud stage through embryonic cytodifferentiation using high-resolution confocal microscopy imaging. Moreover, we have investigated the functional significance of E-cadherin during early morphogenesis using both an E-cadherin function blocking antibody and partial silencing of E-cadherin expression with siRNA. Our findings show that as early as the initial bud stage, the E12.5 SMG contains two morphologically distinct cell populations with different E-cadherin junctional organization and functional outcomes for development. The outer cell layer in contact with the basement membrane consists of closely packed epithelial cells that surround polymorphous cells located in the inner bud region. Such a cellular organization has been reported only for later stages of SMG morphogenesis based on electron microscopy studies ( Kadoya and Yamashina, 1989 , 1993 ; Kadoya et al., 1995 ). We provide evidence that already in the initial bud the outer peripheral cells had well-organized E-cadherin junctions. By E13.5, these cells expressed a biochemical marker of neonatal acinar cell differentiation, demonstrating that acinar cells are determined very early in SMG development. Our findings that cytoarchitecture and intercellular junctions characteristic of columnar acinar cell morphology are established in the peripheral layer at the initial bud stage suggests that commitment to the acinar lineage may occur at or prior to these earliest stages of SMG development. In contrast, the cells in the inner bud region have less-defined E-cadherin junctions and express duct-specific markers, suggesting that they are destined to form ductal structures. Importantly, our studies demonstrate that E-cadherin provides a survival signal to duct cells during lumen formation. Moreover, E-cadherin is required for the branching morphogenesis and outgrowth of the developing SMG. Collectively, our studies define distinct developmental roles for E-cadherin in the formation of acinar and ductal structures during SMG branching morphogenesis.

Partial silencing of E-cadherin with siRNA inhibits branching morphogenesis and results in aberrantly dilated lumens

To identify the functions of E-cadherin during SMG morphogenesis, we partially inhibited E-cadherin expression using an siRNA strategy. Transfection of E12.5 SMGs with E-cadherin siRNA resulted in a 30% reduction of E-cadherin transcript levels compared to a non-silencing control siRNA ( Fig. 7A ). This corresponded to a 20% decrease in E-cadherin protein abundance (data not shown). Non-silencing control siRNAs had no effect on either E-cadherin expression or SMG morphogenesis. E-cadherin siRNA inhibited branching morphogenesis by affecting bud formation, gland size, and duct development ( Fig. 7B ). Partial knockdown of E-cadherin left the peripheral SMG cell layer unaffected (data not shown), while the developing ducts exhibited dilated regions delineated by prominent F-actin staining ( Fig. 7Cd ). Some of these lumenizing structures were found to contain pockets of pycnotic nuclei ( Fig. 7Ce ). Thus, a 30% reduction of E-cadherin expression was sufficient to cause detectable defects in SMG morphogenesis. These results suggested that E-cadherin was required for proper lumen formation and branching morphogenesis in the developing SMG.

DISCUSSION

The SMG belongs to epithelial tissues, including the lung, kidney, and mammary gland, which develop from a single epithelial bud through branching morphogenesis. The latter is a complex developmental process that involves reciprocal signaling among different cell types, changes in gene expression patterns, dynamic reorganization and movements of cells, remodeling of the basement membrane, temporal and spatial engagement of numerous signaling pathways, all of which converge to regulate growth, branching, and duct formation ( Hogan, 2006 ; Kerman et al., 2006 ; Patel et al., 2006 ). Although the E-cadherin adhesion receptor has an acknowledged function in epithelial branching morphogenesis, relatively little is known of how in addition to mediating intercellular adhesion E-cadherin impacts the development of acini and ducts. In this report we present evidence that during SMG embryonic development, acinar and ductal cell fates are determined already at a single bud stage and that E-cadherin junctions play pivotal and distinct roles in their organization into mature structures.

Similar to a previous report, which suggested that the initial bud consisted of disorganized cells with E-cadherin and β-catenin uniformly and diffusely distributed over their surface ( Hieda et al., 1996 ; Heida and Nakanishi, 1997 ), we found disorganized cells in the interior of the early SMG buds. However, our studies also show that the initial SMG bud contains another cell population in the outer layer in contact with the basement membrane. This cell population has columnar morphology with distinct E-cadherin junctions. The molecular mechanisms underlying the critical role of E-cadherin adhesion in the initiation of epithelial cell polarity have been recently described ( Nejsum and Nelson, 2007 ). Thus, the presence of organized E-cadherin junctions in the outer columnar cells is likely to be linked to their columnar morphology. Our studies also show that following clefting and growth of the initial bud, these organized peripheral cells are maintained in, and restricted to, the outer cell layer of the newly formed end-buds. Inhibition of E-cadherin with either siRNA or function blocking antibody demonstrated that E-cadherin junctions were required for branching morphogenesis. One possible explanation is that E-cadherin junctions in the peripheral cell layer were required for branching and new bud formation. In these studies, however, the morphology of the outer cell layer remained unaffected. It is possible that in the absence of E-cadherin function, the morphology of the outer cells was maintained by N-cadherin junctions, which were highly expressed in these cells. It is also possible that the observed effects of inhibition of E-cadherin on the SMG outgrowth and budding were influenced by the defective duct formation.

The presence of two morphologically distinct cell populations was reported previously but not until a later point in SMG morphogenesis, at E13.5 or the pseudoglandular stage, using an EM approach ( Kadoya and Yamashina, 1989 , 1993 , 2005 ; Kadoya et al., 1995 ). Further evidence for the existence of two distinct cell populations within terminal end-buds at the pseudoglandular stage was obtained from studies of cell migration behavior in which cells in contact with the basement membrane were shown to move and travel differently from the interior cells ( Larsen et al., 2006 ). Moreover, cells in the interior of the bud could become integrated into the outer layer, further emphasizing the dynamic nature of the terminal buds during SMG development ( Larsen et al., 2006 ).

Our studies are the first to provide evidence that the peripheral columnar cells with organized E-cadherin/β-catenin junctions were destined for acinar cell fate. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that as early as E13.5, only cells in the outer layer expressed the neonatal acinar cell marker B1. Western blot studies showed that B1 was detected by E13.5, which follows the initial bud stage, suggesting that the peripheral cells of the initial SMG bud were acinar precursors. Importantly, the B1-positive outer cell layer was maintained during branching and growth of the SMG, through the formation of acini in the cytodifferentiated E18.5 SMG. Our identification of cells in the outer layer as cells expressing the neonatal acinar marker B1 much before acinar structures are formed is novel and suggests that we have identified acinar precursors.

While cells committed to the acinar lineage were restricted to the outer cell layer throughout SMG embryonic development and eventually formed the acini, cells in the interior of the bud formed the duct system. The initial organization of these ducts was identified as early as E13.5 as a group of cells aligned along the proximal-distal axis with prominent F-actin filaments and expressing the cytokeratin ductal marker K7. Moreover, this initial organization of ductal precursors preceded the acquisition of defined E-cadherin junctions in these cells. Well-defined E-cadherin junctions were first detected at the apical-lateral borders of cells that lined the ducts and appeared coincident with lumen formation. The latter was also associated with the detection of ZO-1 at sites apical to E-cadherin junctions, suggesting that these cells had tight junctions. Therefore, less organized E-cadherin in the interior bud cells may be critical to allow cellular rearrangements during initial duct formation. Once ductal lumens are formed, E-cadherin junctions may be required to stabilize ductal structures.

Apoptosis has been shown be involved in normal lumen formation of the SMG and other glandular tissues ( Melnick and Jaskoll, 2000 ; Mailleux et al., 2007 ). Our functional studies with E-cadherin siRNA and EC5 function blocking antibody demonstrate the protective role of E-cadherin junctions in the epithelial cells that will line the lumen of the newly formed ducts during the lumenization process. Both approaches blocked the formation of E-cadherin junctions in the duct cells that resulted in aberrantly dilated luminal spaces. The detection of numerous pycnotic nuclei and cleaved caspase 3 in these lumens provided evidence that the expanded lumens arose due to inappropriate apoptosis of duct cells. Thus, E-cadherin junctions provide a survival signal to the maturing duct cells. A similar effect of E-cadherin on cell survival was shown in the Drosophila salivary gland where inappropriate loss of β-catenin and E-cadherin caused by expression of constitutively active Rac1V 12 induced cell death ( Pirraglia et al., 2006 ). Furthermore, in the absence of p120 catenin, a stabilizing partner of E-cadherin, mouse SMGs displayed aberrantly dilated lumens ( Davis and Reynolds, 2006 ). In other tissues, such as mammary gland and skin, E-cadherin has also been shown to promote cell survival ( Boussadia et al., 2002 ; Tinkle et al., 2003 ).

Collectively, our studies show that two distinct cell populations are present in the SMG from the single bud stage. We demonstrate for the first time that the cell population in the outer layer contains precursors of acinar cells that go on to form the acinar structures of cytodifferentiated gland. The second population, the cells in the interior bud regions, reorganizes to form ducts. Both of these populations have E-cadherin junctions, although their organization during development is different. Interfering with E-cadherin function has major effects on the development of the SMG, blocking its outgrowth, bud formation, and causing dilation of ducts due to the loss of protection of the luminal epithelium. Future studies will focus on additional functions of E-cadherin junctions during SMG development, particularly their role in mechanotransduction events during duct formation and morphogenesis of the gland ( Lecuit and Lenne, 2007 ). These cadherin functions are likely important in the formation of cell boundaries and cellular rearrangements critical to the formation of acinar and ductal structures.
