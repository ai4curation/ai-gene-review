The accurate maintenance of genomic integrity is essential for tissue 
homeostasis. Deregulation of this process leads to cancer and aging. BRCA1 is a 
critical mediator of this process. Here, we performed conditional deletion of 
Brca1 during epidermal development and found that BRCA1 is specifically required 
for hair follicle (HF) formation and for development of adult HF stem cells 
(SCs). Mice deficient for Brca1 in the epidermis are hairless and display a 
reduced number of HFs that degenerate progressively. Surprisingly, the 
interfollicular epidermis and the sebaceous glands remain unaffected by Brca1 
deletion. Interestingly, HF matrix transient amplifying progenitors present 
increased DNA damage, p53 stabilization, and caspase-dependent apoptosis 
compared with the interfollicular and sebaceous progenitors, leading to 
hyperproliferation, apoptosis, and subsequent depletion of the prospective adult 
HF SCs. Concomitant deletion of p53 and Brca1 rescues the defect of HF 
morphogenesis and loss of HF SCs. During adult homeostasis, BRCA1 is dispensable 
for quiescent bulge SCs, but upon their activation during HF regeneration, Brca1 
deletion causes apoptosis and depletion of Brca1-deficient bulge SCs. Our data 
reveal a major difference in the requirement of BRCA1 between different types of 
epidermal SCs and progenitors and during the different activation stages of 
adult HF SCs.
