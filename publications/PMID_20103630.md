Ongoing clinical trials are exploring anticancer approaches based on signaling 
by TRAIL, a ligand for the cell death receptors DR4 and DR5. In this study, we 
report on the selective apoptotic effects of multivalent DR5 binding peptides 
(TRAIL(mim/DR5)) on cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Surface plasmon resonance 
revealed up to several thousand-fold increased affinities of 
TRAIL(mim/DR5)-receptor complexes on generation of divalent and trivalent 
molecules, the latter of which was achieved with a conformationally restricted 
adamantane core. Notably, only multivalent molecules triggered a substantial 
DR5-dependent apoptotic response in vitro. In tumor models derived from human 
embryonic kidney cells or primary foreskin fibroblasts, TRAIL(mim/DR5) peptides 
exerted a cancer cell-selective action that could synergize with resveratrol in 
a manner independent of p53. In a xenograft model of human colon cancer, a 
divalent TRAIL(mim/DR5) peptide inhibited tumor growth. Our results offer a 
proof-of-principle for the development of synthetic small molecules to trigger 
the TRAIL apoptosis pathway for cancer therapy.
