BACKGROUND: In a recent large-scale genetic association study, a single 
nucleotide polymorphism in the thrombospondin-4 (TSP-4) gene, resulting in a 
proline-for-alanine substitution at position 387, was associated with a 
significantly increased risk for premature atherosclerosis. TSP-4 had not 
previously been implicated in vascular pathology, and very little information is 
available on its expression and functions.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The goal of this study was to assess TSP-4 expression in 
vessel wall and to identify differences in functions of TSP-4 variants that 
could account for the proatherogenic effects of the (P387)TSP-4 variant. TSP-4 
expression was demonstrated in human endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth 
muscle cells from brain blood vessels and coronary arteries. (P387)TSP-4 and its 
fragment (residues 326 to 722), but not the A(387) forms, suppressed EC adhesion 
and proliferation. The (P387)TSP-4 was more active in inducing the 
phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, consistent with inhibition of 
proliferation. Both variant fragments increased the proliferation of human 
aortic smooth muscle cells.
CONCLUSIONS: TSP-4 is expressed by vascular cells and influences the vessel wall 
by modulating the proliferation of ECs and smooth muscle cells. The A387P 
substitution is a "gain-of-function" mutation, favoring a form of TSP-4 that 
interferes with EC adhesion and proliferation and may thereby be proatherogenic.
