Budding yeast HAP2 is required in concert with HAP3 and HAP4 to form a 
heterotrimeric CCAAT-binding transcriptional activation complex at the UAS2 
element of CYC1. Functional homologs of HAP2 and HAP3 have been conserved in 
HeLa cells where HAP2 activity corresponds to a chromatographic fraction 
designated CP1B. Here, we describe deletion and codon insertion mutagenesis of 
the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HAP2 subunit. DNA binding was assessed both in 
vitro and in vivo whereas subunit association and transcriptional activation 
were analyzed in vivo by using a bifunctional lexA-HAP2 fusion. The results 
indicate that the 265-amino-acid HAP2 protein contains an "essential core" of 65 
amino acids, which is entirely sufficient for assembly and DNA binding of the 
HAP2/3/4 complex. The essential core can be divided further into a region of 44 
amino acids, which is sufficient for subunit association, and a region of 21 
amino acids, which is required specifically for DNA recognition. The remainder 
of the HAP2 protein is dispensable. The roles of HAP3 and HAP4 in the 
heterotrimeric complex are also assessed by using lexA fusions and a fusion of 
the GAL4 acidic activation domain to HAP2, which partially bypasses a deletion 
of HAP4 but not HAP3. These data indicate that subunits HAP2 and HAP3 are 
primarily responsible for site-specific DNA binding by the complex, whereas the 
HAP4 subunit provides the primary transcriptional activation domain. A model for 
the function of this regulated transcriptional activation complex is presented.
