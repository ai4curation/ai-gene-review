GTP cyclohydrolase I feedback regulatory protein (GFRP) mediates feedback 
inhibition of GTP cyclohydrolase I activity by tetrahydrobiopterin and also 
mediates the stimulatory effect of phenylalanine on the enzyme activity. To 
characterize the molecular structure of GFRP, we have purified it from rat liver 
using an efficient step of affinity chromatography and isolated cDNA clones, 
based on partial amino acid sequences of peptides derived from purified GFRP. 
Comparison between the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA and the 
N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified GFRP showed that the mature form of 
GFRP consists of 83 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of 9,542. The 
isolated GFRP cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with 
six consecutive histidine residues at its N terminus. The fusion protein was 
affinity-purified and digested with thrombin to remove the histidine tag. The 
resulting recombinant GFRP showed kinetic properties similar to those of GFRP 
purified from rat liver. Cross-linking experiments using dimethyl suberimidate 
indicated that GFRP was a pentamer of 52 kDa. Sedimentation equilibrium 
measurements confirmed the pentameric structure of GFRP by giving an average Mr 
of 49,734, which is 5 times the calculated molecular weight of the recombinant 
GFRP polypeptide. Based on the pentameric structure of GFRP, we have proposed a 
model for the quaternary structure of GFRP and GTP cyclohydrolase I complexes.
