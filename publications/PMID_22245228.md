Eukaryotic 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prx) are abundant antioxidant enzymes whose 
thioredoxin peroxidase activity plays an important role in protecting against 
oxidative stress, aging, and cancer. Paradoxically, this thioredoxin peroxidase 
activity is highly sensitive to inactivation by peroxide-induced Prx 
hyperoxidation. However, any possible advantage in preventing Prx from removing 
peroxides under oxidative stress conditions has remained obscure. Here we 
demonstrate that, in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide, the Prx Tpx1 is a 
major substrate for thioredoxin in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe 
and, as such, competitively inhibits thioredoxin-mediated reduction of other 
oxidized proteins. Consequently, we reveal that the hyperoxidation of Tpx1 is 
critical to allow thioredoxin to act on other substrates ensuring repair of 
oxidized proteins and cell survival following exposure to toxic levels of 
hydrogen peroxide. We conclude that the inactivation of the thioredoxin 
peroxidase activity of Prx is important to maintain thioredoxin activity and 
cell viability under oxidative stress conditions.
