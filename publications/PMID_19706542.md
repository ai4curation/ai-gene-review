The transcription factor NF-E2-related nuclear factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates 
expression of genes that protect cells from oxidative damage. Here, we 
characterized nitric oxide (*NO)-induced Nrf2-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 
1 (Keap1) signaling and its role in counteracting *NO-induced apoptosis of human 
colon cancer HCT116 cells. Nrf2 was localized in the cytoplasm in control cells; 
*NO triggered its rapid nuclear accumulation, transcriptional activation, and 
up-regulation of HO-1, NQO1, and GCL, but not GST A4 and P1 subunits. Nrf2 
accumulation in the nucleus was also associated with enhanced transcription and 
posttranscriptional modifications. (S)-nitrosation of Keap1 may contribute to 
nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 by facilitating its dissociation from Keap1, thus 
initiating *NO-mediated Nrf2-Keap1 signaling. *NO-mediated induction of 
ARE-dependent genes occurred well before apoptosis, as judged by caspase 3 
activation. Collectively, these results show that the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling 
pathway mediates protective cellular responses to mitigate *NO-induced damage 
and may contribute to the relative resistance of HCT116 to *NO-induced 
cytotoxicity.
