The human ribosomal protein S3 (hS3) possesses multifunctional activities that 
are involved in both protein translation, as well as the ability of cleaving 
apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) DNA via a beta-elimination reaction. We recently 
showed that hS3 also has a surprising binding affinity for an 
7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) residue embedded in a 5' end labeled 37mer DNA 
oligonucleotide. To understand the interaction of hS3 and DNA templates 
containing 8-oxoG, we carried out real-time analysis using surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR). Notably, hS3 was found to have an apparent three orders of 
magnitude higher binding affinity (KD) for 8-oxoG than the human 
N-glycosylase/AP lyase base excision repair (BER) enzyme OGG1. An even more 
dramatic five orders of magnitude higher binding affinity for AP DNA was found 
for hS3 as opposed to hOGG1. These results suggest that ribosomal protein hS3 
may have a multifunctional role that may also affect functions associated with 
DNA base excision repair transactions.
