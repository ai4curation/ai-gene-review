Cysteine-rich secretory protein 3 (CRISP-3; also known as SGP28) was originally 
discovered in human neutrophilic granulocytes. We have recently developed a 
sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for CRISP-3 and 
demonstrated the presence of CRISP-3 in exocrine secretions. To investigate the 
subcellular localization and mobilization of CRISP-3 in human neutrophils, we 
performed subcellular fractionation of resting and activated neutrophils on 
three-layer Percoll density gradients, release-studies of granule proteins in 
response to different secretagogues, and double-labeling immunogold electron 
microscopy. CRISP-3 was found to be localized in a subset of granules with 
overlapping characteristics of specific and gelatinase granules and mobilized 
accordingly, thus confirming the hypothesis that peroxidase-negative granules 
exist as a continuum from specific to gelatinase granules regarding protein 
content and mobilization. CRISP-3 was found to be a matrix protein, which is 
stored in granules as glycosylated and as unglycosylated protein. The 
subcellular distribution of the two forms of CRISP-3 was identical. In addition, 
CRISP-3 was found as a granule protein in eosinophilic granulocytes. The 
presence of CRISP-3 in peroxidase-negative granules of neutrophils, in granules 
of eosinophils, and in exocrine secretions indicates a role in the innate host 
defense.
