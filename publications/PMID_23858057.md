In this study, we investigated the dynamics of the molecular interactions of 
tetraspanin CD81 in T lymphocytes, and we show that CD81 controls the 
organization of the immune synapse (IS) and T cell activation. Using 
quantitative microscopy, including fluorescence recovery after photobleaching 
(FRAP), phasor fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy-Föster resonance energy 
transfer (phasorFLIM-FRET), and total internal reflection fluorescence 
microscopy (TIRFM), we demonstrate that CD81 interacts with ICAM-1 and CD3 
during conjugation between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). CD81 and 
ICAM-1 exhibit distinct mobilities in central and peripheral areas of early and 
late T cell-APC contacts. Moreover, CD81-ICAM-1 and CD81-CD3 dynamic 
interactions increase over the time course of IS formation, as these molecules 
redistribute throughout the contact area. Therefore, CD81 associations 
unexpectedly define novel sequential steps of IS maturation. Our results 
indicate that CD81 controls the temporal progression of the IS and the 
permanence of CD3 in the membrane contact area, contributing to sustained T cell 
receptor (TCR)-CD3-mediated signaling. Accordingly, we find that CD81 is 
required for proper T cell activation, regulating CD3ζ, ZAP-70, LAT, and 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation; CD69 surface 
expression; and interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion. Our data demonstrate the 
important role of CD81 in the molecular organization and dynamics of the IS 
architecture that sets the signaling threshold in T cell activation.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction between T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is essential for the initiation of the immune response. The dynamic structure formed at cell-to-cell contacts between T cells and APCs, called the immune synapse (IS), is characterized by controlled recruitment of membrane receptors to specific subcellular sites ( 1 ). Upon activation by an APC, T cell molecules involved in the IS redistribute in highly organized structures at the T cell-APC contact ( 2 ). The T cell receptor (TCR) and associated molecules concatenate into the central area (central supramolecular activation cluster [cSMAC]), whereas adhesion receptors rearrange in a surrounding external ring called the peripheral supramolecular activation cluster (pSMAC) ( 3 ). During IS formation, preclustered TCR “protein islands” converge into larger aggregates that translocate toward the cSMAC ( 4 , 5 ), from where they are internalized and degraded ( 6 ). The balance between the generation and degradation of TCR microclusters is critical for sustained T cell activation ( 5 , 7 ) and is modulated by ligand mobility ( 8 ). However, the mechanisms regulating protein receptor movement and the basis for IS molecular segregation are still poorly understood.

A plethora of molecules are translocated to the IS during T cell activation ( 9 ). These include the tetraspanins CD81 ( 10 ) and CD82 ( 11 ), which are known to associate with several IS components such as major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules, CD4, and LFA-1 ( 12 – 15 ). However, the specific role of tetraspanins in the IS remains unknown. Tetraspanins are ubiquitous proteins that modulate the function of their associated partners and play important roles in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes, including immunity and inflammation ( 16 ). They interact with each other and with other receptors, cytoskeletal components, and signaling molecules, acting as organizers of molecular macrocomplexes called tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) ( 17 ). The existence of TEMs has been demonstrated by biochemical approaches ( 16 , 18 ) and by single-molecule fluorescence techniques in living cells ( 19 , 20 ). In the immune system, it has been shown that CD81 provides a costimulatory signal in T cells, associates with CD19, and facilitates antigen presentation by associating with MHCII molecules in APCs ( 21 ). Mice deficient for CD81 have hyperactive B cells ( 22 ), delayed humoral immune responses, impaired T helper type 2 responses, and hyperproliferative T cells ( 21 ). In T cells, TEM insertion has been demonstrated for CD4 and CD8 coreceptors ( 13 , 23 ) and for VLA-4 and LFA-1 integrins ( 15 , 24 ). ICAM-1, the adhesion receptor ligand for the LFA-1 integrin, is also a TEM component, mediating intercellular adhesion ( 25 ). Although ICAM-1 has been thoroughly studied on APCs, ICAM-1 and LFA-1 are present on both APCs and T lymphocytes. ICAM-1 expression on T cells ( 26 – 28 ) and LFA-1 expression on APCs ( 29 , 30 ) can also play a role in T cell-APC contact ( 31 – 36 ). Moreover, CD81 cross-linking stimulates LFA-1–ICAM-1-mediated thymocyte aggregation ( 37 ) and promotes T cell-B cell interactions by activating LFA-1 integrin ( 38 ). Thus, tetraspanins might have an important role in IS organization.

Here, we investigated the role of the tetraspanin CD81 as an IS organizer in live T cell-B cell conjugates. Using state-of-the-art microscopy approaches, we show that CD81 is a critical regulator of the IS architecture on the T cell side of the T cell-APC contact. Our data also reveal that CD81 controls the staging of IS maturation through its interaction with CD3 and ICAM-1. This is due, at least in part, to its role in controlling CD3 clustering and permanence at the IS. Thus, CD81 is a critical regulator of CD3 clustering, sustained CD3 signaling, and T cell activation.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we provide evidence that CD81 controls IS formation and progression through its dynamic interaction with CD3 and ICAM-1. A recent electron microscopy study of mouse ISs, from contacts for up to 6 h, identified four distinct morphological stages. Initial synapses (10 to 30 min) were characterized by contacts through pseudopodia, while later phases corresponded to specific distributions of intracellular structures at the IS area ( 50 ). Previous descriptions of IS dynamics indicated that protein polarization reaches a maximum by ∼30 min ( 51 ), with increasing interaction forces ( 52 ). T cells sustain the IS ring pattern for over 1 h when plated onto lipid bilayers ( 53 ). In our analysis, we examined live T cell-B cell conjugates and discerned different IS steps not detected in previous studies. IS stages were defined based on protein redistribution, dynamics, and interactions at the contact area during 1 h of conjugation, delineating three major IS stages: initial cognate contacts, between polarized T cells and stimulated APCs; the early IS, showing differential protein enrichment at the cSMAC or pSMAC; and the late IS, with proteins evenly distributed throughout the IS and showing high protein-protein interaction levels ( Fig. 9 ). Our data point to a regulation of the dynamics of synapse architectural organization not only by size differences in ectodomains of cell surface proteins ( 54 ) but also by protein-protein interactions driven by TEMs.

This novel stepwise IS formation reveals an important role for CD81. Our data indicate a correlation between colocalization and protein-protein molecular interaction studies, with an increase in the extent of CD81 associations as conjugation progressed, although the full extent of interactions is underestimated in our phasorFLIM-FRET experiments due to the competition with endogenous untagged proteins. In early synapses, most CD81 is engaged at the cSMAC, where it colocalizes and interacts directly with CD3. In accordance, CD81 association with the CD3δ subunit was recently identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen ( 55 ). Remarkably, at the same stage, ICAM-1, which is initially enriched at the pSMAC, progressively redistributes throughout the contact, with an increase in colocalization and a concomitant increase in direct associations with CD81 molecules. The high level of immobility of CD81 and ICAM-1 molecules in this early stage indicates that protein redistribution during IS progression could be regulated by interactions with the cytoskeleton. In late synapses, CD81 redistributes evenly throughout the IS, showing similar dynamics in the cSMAC and pSMAC, and colocalization and protein-protein interactions with CD3 and ICAM-1 are detected over a larger area. In this IS stage, slow protein dynamics and high levels of membrane protein-protein interactions suggest that IS protein enrichment is regulated by interactions within TEMs. Cytoskeleton polarization toward cell-cell contacts is crucial for the formation of the mature IS ( 56 , 57 ). Accordingly, treatment of J77 T cells with the actin-depolymerizing toxin latrunculin A before incubation with Raji/SEE cells prevented IS formation, with the very few T cell-B cell contacts observed being devoid of CD81-mCherry or endogenous CD3 accumulation at the IS (data not shown), in agreement with previous works ( 5 , 58 ). Cholesterol is an essential component of TEMs ( 46 ), with an important role in the IS context ( 59 – 62 ). T cell-B cell conjugation as well as CD81 and CD3 accumulation at the IS were also significantly reduced by the treatment of J77 T cells with methyl-β-cyclo-dextrin, a drug that extracts membrane cholesterol, before incubation with Raji/SEE cells (data not shown). TEMs might then modulate IS organization and maturation by mediating the link between membrane proteins and lipids, cytoskeleton components, and signaling molecules.

CD81 diffusion properties in nonconjugated T cells are similar to those of ICAM-1, in agreement with previous studies showing comparable apparent diffusion coefficients for ICAM-1 and tetraspanins CD9 and CD151 in nude endothelial cell plasma membranes ( 19 ). We also observed similarities in ICAM-1 and CD81 diffusion properties in the late IS. The mobility of tetraspanins CD63 and CD82 is comparable to the one of MHCII in late endosomal multivesicular bodies ( 63 ), and it is possible that their diffusional behavior also varies according to IS sublocalization and maturation stages. Although CD81 is also present in intracellular vesicles and is secreted through exosomes ( 64 ), CD81 is expressed mainly on the plasma membrane of T cells. To study CD81 and ICAM-1 dynamics, we have chosen small bleaching areas (∼8.5 μm 2 ) located specifically at the T cell plasma membrane.

CD81 regulates the correct timing of IS maturation. CD81 downregulation accelerates the proportion of late IS conjugates (based on the ICAM-1 distribution pattern) and reduces CD3 relocalization to the IS, enhancing CD3 microcluster internalization following TCR stimulation. TCR microcluster movement ( 53 ) and signal termination ( 5 ) are controlled by the actin cytoskeleton. CD81 could mediate functional interactions between actin and CD3 or ICAM-1. On the IS APC side, continuous ICAM-1 recycling is controlled by LFA-1, actin, and microtubules ( 65 ). In B cells, CD81 microdomains alongside the actin cytoskeleton play a key role in regulating CD19 mobility and in organizing CD19 and B cell receptor (BCR) interactions that lead to BCR signaling ( 66 ). CD81 is connected to the actin cytoskeleton through its association with ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins ( 67 ), which are recruited to the IS and play a role in T cell activation ( 68 ). F-actin dynamics is also regulated by Rho GTPases ( 69 ), and CD81 was recently shown to associate directly with the small GTPase Rac-1 ( 70 , 71 ). However, our data for CD81 C-terminal cell-permeable peptides and soluble GST-LEL-CD81 fusion proteins suggest that the role of CD81 as an IS organizer might be related to its ability to interact with other transmembrane proteins, regulating their diffusional properties and subcellular localization rather than direct signaling or anchoring to the cytoskeleton through its C-terminal domain. Moreover, the opposite effects observed with CD81 silencing, which accelerates IS maturation, and GST-LEL-CD81, which slows down diffusion of TEM proteins, indicate that CD81 microdomains regulate the time of permanence of TCR signaling at the IS plasma membrane, modulating the TCR signaling threshold.

Thus, as an IS organizer, CD81 regulates T cell activation. CD81-silenced T cells display reduced MTOC translocation toward the IS, which is TCR dependent ( 72 ) and necessary for full T cell activation ( 73 ) but independent of actin polarization ( 74 ). CD81 silencing reduces TCR downstream signaling, decreasing CD3ζ, ZAP-70, LAT, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, in agreement with data showing that CD81 T cell costimulation activates TCRζ and ERK more strongly than does CD28 ( 75 ). Also, CD81-knocked-down T cells have reduced IL-2 secretion, which is dependent on ERK1/2 activation ( 76 ), and express lower levels of the T cell activation marker CD69. This observed decrease in T cell activation in CD81-silenced human T cells may seem contradictory with previous data showing hyperproliferative responses of CD81 −/− mouse T cells to CD3 cross-linking ( 55 , 77 ). However, it is important to note that there are fundamental differences in the CD81 expression patterns between the two species. Opposite to human T cells, CD81 is expressed in mouse T cells only after T cell activation ( 37 , 78 ). Recently, noncanonical T cell stimulation with antibodies against CD4 and the TCR showed a slight increase in CD69 expression levels in CD81-silenced T cells ( 55 ). This difference from our results is probably related to different T cell activation protocols. In our work, we have stimulated CD81-silenced T cells through antigen presentation by APCs by using two different conjugation systems (Raji/SEE and Hom2/HA cells), obtaining similar results with both. Moreover, in agreement with our results, CD81 −/− T cells do not develop Th2 responses when activated by antigen-presenting B cells, with reduced IL-4 production ( 79 ), and CD81 acts as a T cell-costimulatory molecule in human T cells ( 37 , 38 , 75 ).

TEMs accommodate numerous molecules, allowing the regulation of receptor avidity. Our findings provide evidence that CD81 regulates IS molecular organization by associating with CD3 and ICAM-1, controlling their segregation in the cSMAC and pSMAC over the course of IS maturation. The role of CD81 as a microdomain organizer is thus important for synapse maturation timing and necessary for a correct T cell signaling threshold that leads to full T cell activation.
