A set of 11 clones encoding putative GTP binding proteins highly homologous to 
the yeast YPT1/SEC4 gene products have been isolated from an MDCK cell cDNA 
library. We localized three of the corresponding proteins in mammalian cells by 
using affinity-purified antibodies in immunofluorescence and immunoelectron 
microscopy studies. One, the MDCK homolog of rab2, is associated with a 
structure having the characteristics of an intermediate compartment between the 
endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The second, rab5, is located at 
the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane and on early endosomes, while the 
third, rab7, is found on late endosomes. These findings provide evidence that 
members of the YPT1/SEC4 subfamily of GTP binding proteins are localized to 
specific exocytic and endocytic subcompartments in mammalian cells.
