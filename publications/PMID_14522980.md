GCP170, a member of the golgin family associated with the cytoplasmic face of 
the Golgi membrane, was found to have a Golgi localization signal at the 
NH2-terminal region (positions 137-237). Using this domain as bait in the yeast 
two-hybrid screening system, we identified a novel protein that interacted with 
GCP170. The 2.0-kilobase mRNA encoding a 137-amino acid protein of 16 kDa 
designated GCP16 was ubiquitously expressed. Immunofluorescence microscopy 
showed that GCP16 was co-localized with GCP170 and giantin in the Golgi region. 
Despite the absence of a hydrophobic domain sufficient for participating in 
membrane localization, GCP16 was found to be tightly associated with membranes 
like an integral membrane protein. Labeling experiments with [3H]palmitic acid 
and mutational analysis demonstrated that GCP16 was acylated at Cys69 and Cys72, 
accounting for its tight association with the membrane. A mutant without 
potential acylation sites (C69A/C72A) was no longer localized to the Golgi, 
indicating that the acylation is prerequisite for the Golgi localization of 
GCP16. Although the mutant GCP16, even when overexpressed, had no effect on 
protein transport, overexpression of the wild type GCP16 caused an inhibitory 
effect on protein transport from the Golgi to the cell surface. Taken together, 
these results indicate that GCP16 is the acylated membrane protein, associated 
with GCP170, and possibly involved in vesicular transport from the Golgi to the 
cell surface.
