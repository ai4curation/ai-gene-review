The transcription factor p53 acted as a critical tumor suppressor by activating 
the expression of various target genes to regulate diverse cellular responses. 
The phosphorylation of p53 influenced the binding of p53 to promotor-specific 
DNA and the choice of cell fate. In this study, we found that full-length 
wild-type p53 and pol II CTD could form heterotypic phase separation condensates 
in vitro. The heterotypic condensates of p53 and pol II CTD were mediated by 
electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between pol II CTD and multiple 
domains of p53. The mobility of heterotypic p53 and pol II CTD droplets was 
significantly higher than that of p53 droplet. The phosphorylation promoted p53 
to be recruited into pol II CTD droplets and transcription condensates. The 
specific DNA could further enhance the incorporation ability of p53 into 
functional condensates. Therefore, we proposed that the p53 droplet might be in 
a mediate state, the mutations resulting in p53 mutants with gain-of-function 
impelled the aggregate of p53, while the phosphorylation promoted p53 to be 
recruited into functional condensates as a client molecule to exert its 
function. This study might provide insights into the regulation mechanism that 
the phosphorylation and nuclei acid affected the phase behavior of p53.
