The prosurvival protein BCL-2 is frequently overexpressed in estrogen receptor 
(ER)-positive breast cancer. We have generated ER-positive primary breast tumor 
xenografts that recapitulate the primary tumors and demonstrate that the BH3 
mimetic ABT-737 markedly improves tumor response to the antiestrogen tamoxifen. 
Despite abundant BCL-XL expression, similar efficacy was observed with the BCL-2 
selective inhibitor ABT-199, revealing that BCL-2 is a crucial target. 
Unexpectedly, BH3 mimetics were found to counteract the side effect of 
tamoxifen-induced endometrial hyperplasia. Moreover, BH3 mimetics synergized 
with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
inhibitors in eliciting apoptosis. Importantly, these two classes of inhibitor 
further enhanced tumor response in combination therapy with tamoxifen. 
Collectively, our findings provide a rationale for the clinical evaluation of 
BH3 mimetics in therapy for breast cancer.
