Mutations in SRPX2 (Sushi-Repeat Protein, X-linked 2) cause rolandic epilepsy 
with speech impairment (RESDX syndrome) or with altered development of the 
speech cortex (bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria). The physiological roles of 
SRPX2 remain unknown to date. One way to infer the function of SRPX2 relies on 
the identification of the as yet unknown SRPX2 protein partners. Using a 
combination of interactome approaches including yeast two-hybrid screening, 
co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cell surface binding and surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR), we show that SRPX2 is a ligand for uPAR, the urokinase-type 
plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor. Previous studies have shown that uPAR(-/-) 
knock-out mice exhibited enhanced susceptibility to epileptic seizures and had 
brain cortical anomalies consistent with altered neuronal migration and 
maturation, all features that are reminiscent to the phenotypes caused by SRPX2 
mutations. SPR analysis indicated that the p.Y72S mutation associated with 
rolandic epilepsy and perisylvian polymicrogyria, led to a 5.8-fold 
gain-of-affinity of SRPX2 with uPAR. uPAR is a crucial component of the 
extracellular plasminogen proteolysis system; two more SRPX2 partners identified 
here, the cysteine protease cathepsin B (CTSB) and the metalloproteinase 
ADAMTS4, are also components of the extracellular proteolysis machinery and CTSB 
is a well-known activator of uPA. The identification of functionally related 
SRPX2 partners provides the first and exciting insights into the possible role 
of SRPX2 in the brain, and suggests that a network of SRPX2-interacting proteins 
classically involved in the proteolytic remodeling of the extracellular matrix 
and including uPAR participates in the functioning, in the development and in 
disorders of the speech cortex.
