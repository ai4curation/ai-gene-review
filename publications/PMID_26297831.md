Mitochondrial ATP synthase is a motor enzyme in which a central shaft rotates in 
the stator casings fixed with the peripheral stator stalk. When expression of 
d-subunit, a stator stalk component, was knocked-down, human cells could not 
form ATP synthase holocomplex and instead accumulated two subcomplexes, one 
containing a central rotor shaft plus catalytic subunits (F1-c-ring) and the 
other containing stator stalk components ("b-e-g" complex). F1-c-ring was also 
formed when expression of mitochondrial DNA-coded a-subunit and A6L was 
suppressed. Thus, the central rotor shaft and the stator stalk are formed 
separately and they assemble later. Similar assembly strategy has been known for 
ATP synthase of yeast and Escherichia coli and could be common to all organisms.
