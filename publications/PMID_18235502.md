SIRT1 is an NAD-dependent deacetylase critically involved in stress responses, 
cellular metabolism and, possibly, ageing. The tumour suppressor p53 represents 
the first non-histone substrate functionally regulated by acetylation and 
deacetylation; we and others previously found that SIRT1 promotes cell survival 
by deacetylating p53 (refs 4-6). These results were further supported by the 
fact that p53 hyperacetylation and increased radiation-induced apoptosis were 
observed in Sirt1-deficient mice. Nevertheless, SIRT1-mediated deacetylase 
function is also implicated in p53-independent pathways under different cellular 
contexts, and its effects on transcriptional factors such as members of the FOXO 
family and PGC-1alpha directly modulate metabolic responses. These studies 
validate the importance of the deacetylase activity of SIRT1, but how SIRT1 
activity is regulated in vivo is not well understood. Here we show that DBC1 
(deleted in breast cancer 1) acts as a native inhibitor of SIRT1 in human cells. 
DBC1-mediated repression of SIRT1 leads to increasing levels of p53 acetylation 
and upregulation of p53-mediated function. In contrast, depletion of endogenous 
DBC1 by RNA interference (RNAi) stimulates SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53 
and inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis. Notably, these effects can be reversed in 
cells by concomitant knockdown of endogenous SIRT1. Our study demonstrates that 
DBC1 promotes p53-mediated apoptosis through specific inhibition of SIRT1.

Abstract

SIRT1 is an NAD-dependent deacetylase critically involved in stress responses, cellular metabolism and, possibly, ageing 1 – 15 . The tumour suppressor p53 represents the first non-histone substrate functionally regulated by acetylation and deacetylation 16 , 17 ; we and others previously found that SIRT1 promotes cell survival by deacetylating p53 (refs 4 – 6 ). These results were further supported by the fact that p53 hyperacetylation and increased radiation-induced apoptosis were observed in Sirt1-deficient mice 10 . Nevertheless, SIRT1-mediated deacetylase function is also implicated in p53-independent pathways under different cellular contexts, and its effects on transcriptional factors such as members of the FOXO family and PGC-1 α directly modulate metabolic responses 1 – 15 . These studies validate the importance of the deacetylase activity of SIRT1, but how SIRT1 activity is regulated in vivo is not well understood. Here we show that DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) acts as a native inhibitor of SIRT1 in human cells. DBC1-mediated repression of SIRT1 leads to increasing levels of p53 acetylation and upregulation of p53-mediated function. In contrast, depletion of endogenous DBC1 by RNA interference (RNAi) stimulates SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53 and inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis. Notably, these effects can be reversed in cells by concomitant knockdown of endogenous SIRT1 . Our study demonstrates that DBC1 promotes p53-mediated apoptosis through specific inhibition of SIRT1.

METHODS SUMMARY

H1299, U2OS, 293 and HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. H1299 and 293 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate protocol or the siRNA RNA duplex, as indicated in the relevant figures, by Lipofectamine2000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In vitro deacetylation assays were performed as previously described. Purified acetylated p53 was incubated with purified SIRT1 and DBC1 as indicated at 30 °C for 1 h in the presence of 50 μM NAD, and reactions were resolved by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and analysed by western blot. To immunoprecipitate the ectopically expressed Flag-tagged proteins, transfected cells were lysed 24 h post-transfection in Flag-lysis buffer and precipitated using anti-Flag monoclonal antibody-conjugated M2 agarose beads. The eluted material was resolved by SDS–PAGE and detected by antibodies as indicated. The endogenous SIRT1 complex was purified from HeLa cells by using the SIRT1-CT-specific antibody for immunoprecipitation. Interacting proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. To analyse the SIRT1 complex, 50 μl of M2-eluted Flag-SIRT1 containing approximately 12.5 μg of total purified Flag-SIRT1 was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography. GST pull-downs were performed as previously described, using recombinant fragments of GST–SIRT1 or GST–control to pull-down 35 S-methionine-labelled DBC1. Direct in vitro interaction was detected by autoradiation after the reactions were resolved by SDS–PAGE. Dual luciferase reporter assays to determine transcriptional activity were performed in H1299 cells according to the manufacturer’s guidelines 24 h post-transfection. The ablation of DBC1 was performed by transfection of the U2OS cells with either of two siRNA duplex oligonucleotides which covered mRNA regions of nucleotides 582–602 (amino acids 55–61) and nucleotides 2097–2115 (amino acids 560–565) of DBC1 , respectively, by using Lipofectamine2000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. SIRT1 RNAi, p53 RNAi and Control RNAi were used and transfected according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Annexin V-FITC and TUNNEL staining were performed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
