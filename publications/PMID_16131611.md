The recently discovered p53-related genes, p73 and p63, express multiple splice 
variants and N-terminally truncated forms initiated from an alternative promoter 
in intron 3. To date, no alternative promoter and multiple splice variants have 
been described for the p53 gene. In this study, we show that p53 has a gene 
structure similar to the p73 and p63 genes. The human p53 gene contains an 
alternative promoter and transcribes multiple splice variants. We show that p53 
variants are expressed in normal human tissue in a tissue-dependent manner. We 
determine that the alternative promoter is conserved through evolution from 
Drosophila to man, suggesting that the p53 family gene structure plays an 
essential role in the multiple activities of the p53 family members. Consistent 
with this hypothesis, p53 variants are differentially expressed in human breast 
tumors compared with normal breast tissue. We establish that p53beta can bind 
differentially to promoters and can enhance p53 target gene expression in a 
promoter-dependent manner, while Delta133p53 is dominant-negative toward 
full-length p53, inhibiting p53-mediated apoptosis. The differential expression 
of the p53 isoforms in human tumors may explain the difficulties in linking p53 
status to the biological properties and drug sensitivity of human cancer.

Abstract

The recently discovered p53-related genes, p73 and p63, express multiple splice variants and N-terminally truncated forms initiated from an alternative promoter in intron 3. To date, no alternative promoter and multiple splice variants have been described for the p53 gene. In this study, we show that p53 has a gene structure similar to the p73 and p63 genes. The human p53 gene contains an alternative promoter and transcribes multiple splice variants. We show that p53 variants are expressed in normal human tissue in a tissue-dependent manner. We determine that the alternative promoter is conserved through evolution from Drosophila to man, suggesting that the p53 family gene structure plays an essential role in the multiple activities of the p53 family members. Consistent with this hypothesis, p53 variants are differentially expressed in human breast tumors compared with normal breast tissue. We establish that p53β can bind differentially to promoters and can enhance p53 target gene expression in a promoter-dependent manner, while Δ133p53 is dominant-negative toward full-length p53, inhibiting p53-mediated apoptosis. The differential expression of the p53 isoforms in human tumors may explain the difficulties in linking p53 status to the biological properties and drug sensitivity of human cancer.

Discussion

The recently discovered p53 -related genes, p63 and p73 , transcribe multiple splice variants and can initiate transcription from an alternative promoter located in intron 3. The human p73 gene is transcribed for 35 different mRNA, which would encode, theoretically, 28 different p73 protein isoforms. To date, 14 p73 proteins isoforms have been described. The human p63 gene is transcribed for six different mRNA splice variants encoding six different p63 protein isoforms. The activities of each p73 or p63 isoform are still under investigation, but it appears from most recent studies that each p73 or p63 isoform has specific and distinct activities ( Wu et al. 2003 ; Liu et al. 2004 ; Goldschneider et al. 2005 ).

Up until now, no alternative promoter has been reported for the p53 gene. In mice, only one alternative splicing of intron 10—affecting the p53 C terminus—has previously been described, which leads to a p53 protein (p53AS) containing the oligomerization domain but devoid of the last 30 amino acids ( Wolf et al. 1985 ). The p53AS isoform is constitutively active for sequence-specific DNA binding, can transactivate p53 target genes, but inhibits full-length p53-mediated apoptosis ( Wu et al. 1994 ; Almog et al. 2000 ). For the human p53 gene, two mRNA splice variants have been previously reported: (1) p53i9, alternative splicing of intron 9; and (2) Δ40p53 (also named p47 or ΔNp53), an alternative splicing of intron 2. p53i9 encodes a C-truncated p53 protein isoform of 341 amino acids for which no biochemical activities have been reported. The p53i9 protein lacks the p53 tetramerization domain, fails to bind DNA in vitro, and has a transcriptional defect in vivo in both yeast and mammalian cells ( Flaman et al. 1996 ). It has not been reported that endogenous p53i9 is expressed at the protein level. Δ40p53 encodes an N-terminally truncated p53 isoform deleted of the first 40 amino acids ( Ghosh et al. 2004 ). Δ40p53 protein can also be generated by alternative initiation of translation ( Courtois et al. 2002 ; Yin et al. 2002 ). Δ40p53 contains a large part of the transactivation domain and can still activate gene expression after transfection through a second transactivation domain located between amino acids 43 and 63 (Zhu et al. 1998 , 2000 ; Harms and Chen 2005 ). Δ40p53 can also act, after transfection, in a dominant-negative manner toward wild-type p53, inhibiting both p53 transcriptional activity and p53-mediated apoptosis ( Courtois et al. 2002 ; Ghosh et al. 2004 ). Δ40p53 can modify p53 cell localization and inhibits p53 degradation by MDM2 ( Ghosh et al. 2004 ).

In this study, we have shown that the p53 gene has a complex transcriptional expression pattern encoding different p53 mRNA variants, through both the use of alternative splicing and the existence of an internal promoter in intron 4. The C terminus can be alternatively spliced to produce three isoforms—p53, p53β, and p53γ—where the p53β and p53γ isoforms lack the oligomerization domain. The alternative promoter leads to the expression of an N-terminally truncated p53 protein (Δ133p53), which is initiated at codon 133. Therefore, the human p53 gene can encode at least nine different p53 protein isoforms—p53, p53β, p53γ, Δ133p53, Δ133p53β, and Δ133p53γ due to alternative splicing of intron 9 and usage of the alternative promoter in intron 4, but also Δ40p53 due to alternative splicing of intron 2 and alternative initiation of translation ( Courtois et al. 2002 ; Yin et al. 2002 ; Ghosh et al. 2004 ).

All p53 isoforms are expressed in normal tissue at the mRNA level. Moreover, the pattern of expression is tissue specific, indicating that their expression can be selectively regulated.

It is generally understood that the vertebrate p53 gene family derives from the triplication of one ancestral p53 gene ( Yang et al. 2002 ). Human p63, p73, and p53 genes contain an internal promoter and express several splice variants, while only one transcript has been described for the Drosophila p53 gene. To determine whether the Drosophila p53 gene contains an internal promoter, we performed GeneRacer PCR on Drosophila p53 mRNA. We have identified two additional Drosophila p53 mRNAs. Both mRNAs contain two additional exons (440 bp) and are initiated 580 bp upstream of the previously defined transcription initiation site of the Drosophila p53 gene. We are currently studying the transcriptional activity and the biological activities of the Drosophila p53 protein isoforms. The previously published Drosophila p53 mRNA is therefore a variant initiated from an internal promoter and encodes an N-terminally truncated isoform deleted of the first 110 amino acids (dp53). This indicates that the internal promoter is conserved among the p53 gene family and through evolution from Drosophila to man. It strongly suggests that the internal promoter plays an essential role in the multiple activities of the p53 family members.

We cannot specifically assess the endogenous expression of p53 protein isoforms by any existing p53 antibodies as they cannot distinguish isoforms from full-length p53 forms that have been subject to post-translational modification or protein degradation. We are currently trying to raise antibodies specific for the Δ133p53 or p53γ isoforms. However, raising antibodies against several peptides derived from the peptide (γ) has so far been unsuccessful, probably because it is not immunogenic enough. It is difficult to raise an antibody specific to Δ133p53 as full-length p53 contains all of the linear amino acid sequence present in Δ133p53. The antibody will need to recognize the unique N terminus of Δ133p53 to be specific.

We raised an antibody (KJC8) specific to the p53β protein isoform. Using this affinity-purified polyclonal antibody and p53 siRNA, we show that the endogenous p53β and Δ133p53β isoforms are expressed at the protein level, confirming that the alternative promoter is active and can lead to protein expression. Therefore, we would anticipate that all the other p53 isoforms are expressed as proteins in human tissue.

p53β and Δ133p53β protein levels are not increased in response to Actinomycin D treatment in MCF7 or in U2OS cells. However, we noticed that transfected p53β is accumulated like full-length p53 in H1299 cells after Actinomycin D treatment ( Fig. 9C ), suggesting that p53β protein expression may be abnormally regulated in MCF7 and in U2OS cells. Further studies will determine whether the p53β protein level can be regulated in response to cellular stress in normal primary cells.

p53 isoforms transfected in H1299 cells have different subcellular localization. Moreover, p53γ, Δ133p53, Δ133p53β, and Δ133p53γ have different subcellular localizations in a minor but significant subpopulation of transfected cells, suggesting that p53 isoform biological activities can be modulated in relation to the cell cycle by regulating their subcellular localization.

p53 protein isoforms are less abundant than full-length p53 protein. However, p53 protein is subject to multiple post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and neddylation (for review, see Oren 2003 ; Xirodimas et al. 2004 ). It is thus unclear what subfractions of total p53 are active in the different biochemical and biological functions of p53 (gene expression, cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis, differentiation, replication, control of chromosome segregation, mitosis, meiosis, DNA repair, etc.). Moreover, p53 abundance is not necessarily associated with p53 transcriptional activity. Hence, we have isolated p53 mutants that are expressed at a low level but have a far higher specific transcriptional activity than the wild-type protein ( Liu et al. 2001 ). In a mouse model of aging, very low level expression of fragments of p53 has caused profound phenotypes dependent on their effect in trans on wild-type p53 ( Tyner et al. 2002 ; Maier et al. 2004 ). Therefore, p53 protein isoforms may be abundant and active enough to regulate the activities of a specific pool of post-translationally modified p53. This hypothesis is supported by our ChIP experiments. We showed that endogenous p53β and p53 proteins bind differentially to promoters. p53β binds preferentially to BAX and p21 promoters rather than the MDM2 promoter, while p53 binds preferentially (five times more) to p21 and MDM2 promoters than to the BAX promoter. This suggested that p53β could interfere with p53 transcriptional activity on the BAX but not the p21 promoter. To assess this hypothesis, we performed gene reporter assay in cells devoid of p53 expression to avoid any effects of the other endogenous p53 isoforms expressed in MCF7 cells. We determined thus that coexpression of p53 with p53β enhances BAX promoter activity but not p21 promoter activity in response to stress. However, p53β has no transcriptional activity on the BAX or p21 promoter in the absence of p53. We cannot rule out that p53β can directly transactivate specific promoters independently of p53, and further experiments will determine whether p53β can modulate p73 or p63 transcriptional activity.

By Western blot with the luciferase assay protein extract, we have shown that the p53 protein level is not increased in the presence of p53β, indicating that p53β enhances BAX promoter activity by increasing the intrinsic p53 transcriptional activity. The coimmunoprecipitation of p53 with p53β suggests that p53β interferes with p53 transcriptional activity by forming a protein complex with p53. The p53/p53β complex may bind preferentially to specific p53-responsive elements, and therefore only a subset of p53-inducible promoters will be responsive to p53β. We are currently identifying the promoters preferentially induced by p53β and studying how the p53/p53β complex can be formed, as p53β has lost the oligomerization domain.

p53β corresponds to p53i9 previously identified and reported as encoding a p53 protein isoform devoid of DNA-binding activity and defective in transcription ( Flaman et al. 1996 ). The discrepancy between our results is probably due to the fact that we performed different and additional experiments using different promoters.

As p53 isoforms can bind differentially to promoters, can modulate p53 target gene expression and p53-mediated apoptosis, the differential expression of the p53 isoforms in human breast tumors could explain the difficulties in many clinical studies to link p53 status to the biological properties and drug sensitivity of human cancer. Furthermore, it suggests that failure of appropriate regulation of expression of p53 isoforms may have a role in tumor formation since attenuation of the wild-type p53 response would render the cells more susceptible to further genetic damage and therefore neoplastic transformation and tumor progression. It will be essential to extend our study to a larger series of tumors.

In conclusion, the structure of the p53 gene is similar to the p63 and p73 genes, revealing an unforeseen complex regulation. The interplay between p53 isoforms and p53 on specific targets may play a major role in controlling the activity of p53-related proteins.
