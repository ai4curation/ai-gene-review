CENP-H is a constitutive centromere component that localizes to the centromere 
throughout the cell cycle. Because CENP-H is colocalized with CENP-A and CENP-C, 
it is thought to be an inner centromere protein. We previously generated a 
conditional loss-of-function mutant of CENP-H and showed that CENP-H is required 
for targeting of CENP-C to the centromere in chicken DT40 cells. In the present 
study, we used this mutant to identify the functional region of chicken CENP-H 
necessary for centromere targeting and cell viability. This region was found by 
yeast two-hybrid analysis to interact with Hec1, which is a member of the Nuf2 
complex that transiently localizes to the centromere during mitosis. 
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CENP-H interacts with the Nuf2 
complex in chicken DT40 cells. Photobleaching experiments showed that both Hec1 
and CENP-H form stable associations with the centromeres during mitosis, 
suggesting that Hec1 acts as a structural component of centromeres during 
mitosis. On the basis of these results and previously published data, we propose 
that the Nuf2 complex functions as a connector between the inner and outer 
kinetochores.
