Pathogens commonly disrupt host cell processes or cause damage, but the 
surveillance mechanisms used by animals to monitor these attacks are poorly 
understood. Upon infection with pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the nematode 
C. elegans upregulates infection response gene irg-1 using the zip-2 bZIP 
transcription factor. Here we show that P. aeruginosa infection inhibits mRNA 
translation in the intestine via the endocytosed translation inhibitor Exotoxin 
A, which leads to an increase in ZIP-2 protein levels. In the absence of 
infection we find that the zip-2/irg-1 pathway is upregulated following 
disruption of several core host processes, including inhibition of mRNA 
translation. ZIP-2 induction is conferred by a conserved upstream open reading 
frame in zip-2 that could derepress ZIP-2 translation upon infection. Thus, 
translational inhibition, a common pathogenic strategy, can trigger activation 
of an immune surveillance pathway to provide host defense.
