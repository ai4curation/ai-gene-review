Abstract

β-Catenin, together with LEF1/TCF transcription factors, activates genes involved in the proliferation and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells. In mature neurons, β-catenin participates in dendritogenesis and synaptic function as a component of the cadherin cell adhesion complex. However, the transcriptional activity of β-catenin in these cells remains elusive. In the present study, we found that in the adult mouse brain, β-catenin and LEF1 accumulate in the nuclei of neurons specifically in the thalamus. The particular electrophysiological properties of thalamic neurons depend on T-type calcium channels. Cav3.1 is the predominant T-type channel subunit in the thalamus, and we hypothesized that the Cacna1g gene encoding Cav3.1 is a target of the LEF1/β-catenin complex. We demonstrated that the expression of Cacna1g is high in the thalamus and is further increased in thalamic neurons treated in vitro with LiCl or WNT3A, activators of β-catenin.

Introduction

LEF1/TCF is a family of transcription factors that recognizes the WWCAAAG motif [also known as Wnt responsive element (WRE)] and is activated by the recruitment of β-catenin ( Hurlstone and Clevers, 2002 ). Many of the 100 or so known LEF1/TCF targets are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Not surprising then is that high levels of LEF1 have been observed in embryonic tissue, lymphocytes ( Oosterwegel et al., 1993 ), and cancer cells ( Hovanes et al., 2001 ; Li et al., 2006 ; Petropoulos et al., 2008 ). In the developing mouse brain, LEF1 is implicated in the generation of hippocampal neurons ( Galceran et al., 2000 ). After birth, Lef1 mRNA levels dramatically decrease in the brain ( Coyle-Rink et al., 2002 ) and can be detected only in the thalamus ( Jones and Rubenstein, 2004 ; Shimogori et al., 2004 ). The role of LEF1 in the thalamus of the adult brain, however, is unknown.

β-Catenin is known to function in two cellular compartments ( Brembeck et al., 2006 ). Membranous β-catenin is involved in cell–cell adhesion via cadherins, whereas in the nucleus it activates LEF1/TCF transcription factors as a mediator of the Wnt signaling pathway. Activation of the Wnt pathway inhibits GSK3β kinase, which is involved in β-catenin degradation, leading to β-catenin accumulation and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. Accumulation of this protein occurs in many embryonic and adult self-renewing tissues and in cancer ( Clevers, 2006 ). In the developing and adult brain, β-catenin is involved in neurogenesis ( Chenn and Walsh, 2002 ; Zechner et al., 2003 ; Hirabayashi et al., 2004 ; Lie et al., 2005 ; Ivaniutsin et al., 2009 ; Kuwabara et al., 2009 ). In postmitotic neurons, membranous β-catenin, together with cadherins, participates in dendritogenesis ( Yu and Malenka, 2003 ; Gao et al., 2007 ; Peng et al., 2009 ), synaptogenesis, and synaptic function ( Arikkath and Reichardt, 2008 ). Recently, nuclear accumulation of β-catenin has been described in stimulated hippocampal cells ( Chen et al., 2006 ; Abe and Takeichi, 2007 ; Schmeisser et al., 2009 ). However, the question whether β-catenin plays a role in transcription regulation in mature neurons remains unanswered. This issue is important because Wnt signaling may be implicated in some neurodegenerative and mental disorders ( De Ferrari and Moon, 2006 ; Gould et al., 2007 ; Mao et al., 2009 ; Rawal et al., 2009 ; Sancho et al., 2009 ).

The present study demonstrates that LEF1 and β-catenin are both present in neuronal nuclei, specifically in the thalamus. To investigate the role of LEF1/β-catenin in adult thalamic neurons, we explored the possible involvement of the complex in the regulation of genes encoding proteins critical for thalamic function. The characteristic property of thalamic neurons is bimodal firing (i.e., tonic and burst), driven by T-type calcium channels ( Llinás and Steriade, 2006 ). Cav3.1 is the predominant T-type channel subunit present in the thalamus ( Talley et al., 1999 ; Kim et al., 2001 ; Zhang et al., 2002 ), and we hypothesized that the LEF1/β-catenin complex enhances the expression of Cacna1g encoding Cav3.1 in mature thalamic neurons. We present in silico , in vitro , and in vivo evidence that confirms our hypothesis.

Discussion

In the present study we found accumulation of the LEF1 transcription factor and nuclear β-catenin in the adult brain specifically in neurons in the thalamus (dorsal thalamus). Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the LEF1/β-catenin complex activates expression of a gene specific to mature neurons. This gene, Cacna1g , encodes the Cav3.1 T-type calcium channel subunit that contributes to electric signal propagation. We also show that activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling leads to T-type current increase in thalamic cells. Previous studies on β-catenin in the adult brain have mainly focused on the role of the protein in dendritogenesis and synaptic function as a component of the cadherin adhesion complex ( Yu and Malenka, 2003 ; Gao et al., 2007 ; Arikkath and Reichardt, 2008 ; Peng et al., 2009 ). The results presented here indicate the involvement of β-catenin in neuronal excitability not only by a local action at the synapse but also by regulating gene expression in thalamic neurons.

Our observation that LEF1 and β-catenin are present in cell nuclei in the thalamus essentially confirms previous reports ( Lucas et al., 1999 ; Jones and Rubenstein, 2004 ; Shimogori et al., 2004 ). However, the present study further identifies the positive cells as neurons. The existence of nuclear β-catenin in mature neurons is unusual. Wnt/β-catenin signaling has usually been implicated in neuronal progenitor self-renewal and neuronal lineage commitment ( Chenn and Walsh, 2002 ; Zechner et al., 2003 ; Hirabayashi et al., 2004 ; Lie et al., 2005 ; Ivaniutsin et al., 2009 ; Kuwabara et al., 2009 ); therefore, this signaling has not been supposed to be particularly active in mature brain cells. Recently, β-catenin was shown to translocate into the nucleus in hippocampal neurons after tetanic stimulation or glutamate treatment ( Chen et al., 2006 ; Abe and Takeichi, 2007 ; Schmeisser et al., 2009 ). The accumulation of β-catenin in thalamic neurons in vitro and in vivo does not require any previous stimulation. The presence of nuclear β-catenin together with LEF1, and possibly TCF7L2 (another member of the LEF1/TCF family that is expressed specifically in the thalamus) ( Lee et al., 2009 ), implies the formation of β-catenin-containing transcription complexes in these cells and raises the possibility of specific gene expression regulation. We showed that such complexes are formed in the adult thalamus, since the known WRE of the Lef1 promoter ( Filali et al., 2002 ; Li et al., 2006 ) is occupied by β-catenin in this brain region.

To address the issue of possible LEF1/β-catenin target genes in the thalamus, we focused on a specific feature of thalamic neurons (i.e., bimodal firing generated by the dense distribution of T-type calcium channels) ( Sherman, 2001 ; Llinás and Steriade, 2006 ). In situ hybridization revealed that Cacna1g encoding the T-type Cav3.1 channel subunit is expressed predominantly in thalamocortical relay neurons ( Talley et al., 1999 ; Zhang et al., 2002 ), which are the major class of neuronal cells in the thalamus (dorsal thalamus) in rodents. Indeed, our data showed that Cacna1g mRNA levels are much higher in the thalamus than in other regions of the forebrain. This pattern perfectly coincides with LEF1 and nuclear β-catenin localization in the forebrain demonstrated here. Moreover, we showed that Cacna1g expression is increased in WNT3A-stimulated thalamic neurons in vitro and that the proximal fragment of the Cacna1g promoter, with disassembled chromatin, is occupied by β-catenin in vivo in the thalamus. In the hindbrain, however, the correlation is only partial. Cacna1g is expressed mainly in the Purkinje layer in the cerebellum and in the inferior olive (medulla oblongata) ( Talley et al., 1999 ), whereas LEF1 and nuclear β-catenin are both present exclusively in Purkinje cells. Thus, LEF1/β-catenin may participate in Cacna1g promoter regulation in the thalamus and presumably in the cerebellum, but not in the medulla oblongata.

Although T-type calcium channels are differentially distributed in the brain ( Talley et al., 1999 ), and their density changes in neurons during development ( Lory et al., 2006 ), very little is known about transcriptional regulation of T-type channel genes, including Cacna1g . The human CACNA1G promoter is hypermethylated in various tumors, which results in its repression ( Toyota et al., 1999 ). This mechanism has not been explored in the developing brain. Instead, a switch between the two alternative promoters, from activator A to repressor B, has been proposed to play a role in the downregulation of CACNA1G expression during neuronal differentiation ( Bertolesi et al., 2003 ). The luciferase assay used in the present study showed that LEF/β-catenin activates both promoters equally well. Thus, LEF/β-catenin unlikely provides the switch. However, because one of the identified LEF1 binding sites, WRE2, lies in the proposed repressor region, LEF1 may not only simply activate the Cacna1g promoter but also change the repressor element into an activator.

We mapped several LEF1 binding elements in the proximal Cacna1g promoter. The conserved LEF1 motif, WRE1, had no impact on the regulation of the promoter in HeLa cells. Instead, deletion of the adjacent upstream fragment, containing WRE2, rendered the promoter less responsive to LEF1/β-catenin. We suppose that WRE1 may serve as a cis- acting element in other cell types or under different conditions, as regulation of gene expression by LEF1/β-catenin is known to be context dependent ( Railo et al., 2009 ). We also found two other LEF1 binding sites in the Cacna1g promoter, WRE3 and WRE4, and established the exact sequence of these elements. Interestingly, the LEF1 binding elements in the Cacna1g promoter, with the exception of WRE1, are novel LEF1 motifs that do not resemble the consensus sequence. Recently, two other nonconventional LEF1/TCF binding sites were characterized ( Atcha et al., 2007 ; Blauwkamp et al., 2008 ; Chang et al., 2008 ). The interaction of LEF1/TCF with atypical cis- elements provides a potential mechanism modulating Wnt/β-catenin-dependent gene regulation (e.g., by involvement of particular coactivators in the LEF1/TCF–DNA complex) ( Blauwkamp et al., 2008 ). We speculate that the novel LEF1 motifs in the Cacna1g promoter may be an element that affords brain-specific regulation of the promoter.

We wondered whether activation of Cacna1g expression by β-catenin had physiological effects. To elucidate this issue, we performed a set of electrophysiological experiments with thalamic cells in vitro . We found that thalamic cells exhibited increased T-type current after stimulation with WNT3A. The specificity of this current type were confirmed by several protocols, such as steady-state inactivation, inactivation kinetics, tail currents typical of T-type currents, and the occurrence of a crisscross pattern of currents ( Randall and Tsien, 1997 ; Kuo and Yang, 2001 ; Perez-Reyes, 2003 ; Catterall et al., 2005 ). The enhancement in current amplitude after WNT3A application most likely results from increased expression of T-type channels because no detectable difference in the steady-state inactivation characteristics was observed, and the electrical driving force was the same when recording from the control and WNT3A-treated cells. Distinguishing between Ca3.1, Cav3.2, and Cav3.3 currents was not possible with our recordings. Although the transcripts for Cav3.2 and Cav3.3 ( Cacna1H and Cacna1I , respectively) are rare in the thalamus ( Talley et al., 1999 ; Zhang et al., 2002 ), they could still be detected in our thalamic culture. However, treatment with WNT3A exclusively elevated expression of the Cav3.1 encoding gene ( Cacna1g ). Therefore, we suggest that WNT3A stimulation enhances T-type calcium currents by increasing the expression of Cav3.1 channels.

Cav3.1 is likely involved in absence epilepsy in the thalamus. Transgenic mice overexpressing Cacna1g exhibited increased T-type currents in thalamic neurons and cortical spike-wave discharges associated with absence seizures ( Ernst et al., 2009 ), whereas Cacna1g -deficient mice lacked T-type currents in the thalamus and were resistant to the generation of absence seizures ( Kim et al., 2001 ). T-type currents are enhanced after β-catenin activation in vitro , and LEF1/β-catenin, through the regulation of Cacna1g expression, may contribute to proper T-type currents in thalamocortical relay neurons in vivo . Consequently, impaired β-catenin regulation may be implicated in epilepsy. To examine the consequences of impaired β-catenin regulation in the thalamus, new transgenic mouse models will be required. Nominal forebrain-specific knock-out does not usually affect the thalamus, such as those based on the CamKII α promoter ( Gould et al., 2008 ).

Improper Wnt signaling has been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and mood disorders ( De Ferrari and Moon, 2006 ; Gould et al., 2007 ; Mao et al., 2009 ; Rawal et al., 2009 ; Sancho et al., 2009 ). The function of β-catenin and LEF1/TCF transcription factors in these diseases and epilepsy is yet to be determined, but the present study opens new perspectives to the understanding and exploitation of the molecular mechanisms of these neuropathologies.
