Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of gram-negative bacteria are synthesized in the 
cytosol and must cross the periplasm before insertion into the outer membrane. 
The 17-kDa protein (Skp) is a periplasmic chaperone that assists the folding and 
insertion of many OMPs, including OmpA, a model OMP with a membrane embedded 
beta-barrel domain and a periplasmic alphabeta domain. Structurally, Skp belongs 
to a family of cavity-containing chaperones that bind their substrates in the 
cavity, protecting them from aggregation. However, some substrates, such as 
OmpA, exceed the capacity of the chaperone cavity, posing a mechanistic 
challenge. Here, we provide direct NMR evidence that, while bound to Skp, the 
beta-barrel domain of OmpA is maintained in an unfolded state, whereas the 
periplasmic domain is folded in its native conformation. Complementary 
cross-linking and NMR relaxation experiments show that the OmpA beta-barrel is 
bound deep within the Skp cavity, whereas the folded periplasmic domain 
protrudes outside of the cavity where it tumbles independently from the rest of 
the complex. This domain-based chaperoning mechanism allows the transport of 
beta-barrels across the periplasm in an unfolded state, which may be important 
for efficient insertion into the outer membrane.
