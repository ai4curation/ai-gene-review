Calcineurin a calmodulin-dependent phosphatase plays a critical role in 
calcium-dependent activation of T-lymphocytes and is the major target for the 
inhibitory actions of the immunosuppressive drugs Tacrolimus (FK506) and 
Cyclosporin A (CsA). Calcineurin is a dimeric protein consisting of distinct A 
(catalytic) and B (regulatory) subunits. In humans two separate genes, CNA1 and 
CNA2, encode the calcineurin A (CNA) subunit. The region of CNA that interacts 
with Calcineurin B, calmodulin, and immunosuppressive drugs bound to their 
receptors--the immunophilins--has been identified to amino acids 281-414 
(Greengard P, Allen PB, Nairin AC. Beyond the dopamine receptor: the 
DARPP-32/protein phosphatase-1 cascade. Neuron 1999;23:435). Our working 
hypothesis was that the differences in patient response to calcineurin 
inhibitors could be a consequence of inherited variations within their CNA 
genes. Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of cDNAs 
derived from the coding region for amino acids 281-414 of CNA1 and CNA2 in 32 
healthy Caucasians did not detect polymorphic variations within these genes. 
These results suggest that this region is highly conserved and cannot account 
for individual variation in response of patients to FK506 and CsA treatment.
