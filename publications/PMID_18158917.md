During development of Caenorhabditis elegans, expression of the RUNX homolog, 
rnt-1, is tightly regulated both spatially and temporally. In this study, we 
investigated the mechanism underlying the temporal regulation of rnt-1. We found 
that rnt-1 contained evolutionarily conserved consensus RUNX binding sequences 
within one of its introns, and that RNT-1 bound to these intronic sequences both 
in vitro and in vivo in the presence of BRO-1, suggesting that RNT-1 together 
with BRO-1 represses its own transcription. Fine deletion and substitution 
experiments revealed a binding site within the intron that was critical for 
rnt-1 regulation. Importantly, we found that the TGFbeta homolog, DBL-1, was 
required for counteracting the repressive activity of BRO-1 at postembryonic 
stages. Accordingly, ectopic expression of DBL-1 induced transcription of rnt-1 
in the lateral hypodermis and other tissues even at the postembryonic stages. 
Taken together, our data suggest that rnt-1 expression is regulated by the 
balance between DBL-1-mediated activation and BRO-1-mediated repression at the 
postembryonic stages.
