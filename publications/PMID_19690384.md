Paracrine signaling from lung epithelium to the surrounding mesenchyme is 
important for lung SMC development and function and is a contributing factor in 
an array of pulmonary diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary 
hypertension, and asthma. Wnt7b, which is exclusively expressed in the lung 
epithelium, is important for lung vascular smooth muscle integrity, but the 
underlying mechanism by which Wnt signaling regulates lung SMC development is 
unclear. In this report, we have demonstrated that Wnt7b regulates a program of 
mesenchymal differentiation in the mouse lung that is essential for SMC 
development. Genetic loss-of-function studies showed that Wnt7b and beta-catenin 
were required for expression of Pdgfralpha and Pdgfrbeta and proliferation in 
pulmonary SMC precursors. In contrast, gain-of-function studies showed that 
activation of Wnt signaling increased the expression of both Pdgfralpha and 
Pdgfrbeta as well as the proliferation of SMC precursors. We further showed that 
the effect on Pdgfr expression was, in part, mediated by direct transcriptional 
regulation of the ECM protein tenascin C (Tnc), which was necessary and 
sufficient for Pdgfralpha/beta expression in lung explants. Moreover, this 
pathway was highly upregulated in a mouse model of asthma and in lung tissue 
from patients with pulmonary hypertension. Together, these data define a 
Wnt/Tnc/Pdgfr signaling axis that is critical for smooth muscle development and 
disease progression in the lung.

Abstract

Paracrine signaling from lung epithelium to the surrounding mesenchyme is important for lung SMC development and function and is a contributing factor in an array of pulmonary diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma. Wnt7b, which is exclusively expressed in the lung epithelium, is important for lung vascular smooth muscle integrity, but the underlying mechanism by which Wnt signaling regulates lung SMC development is unclear. In this report, we have demonstrated that Wnt7b regulates a program of mesenchymal differentiation in the mouse lung that is essential for SMC development. Genetic loss-of-function studies showed that Wnt7b and β-catenin were required for expression of Pdgfrα and Pdgfrβ and proliferation in pulmonary SMC precursors. In contrast, gain-of-function studies showed that activation of Wnt signaling increased the expression of both Pdgfrα and Pdgfrβ as well as the proliferation of SMC precursors. We further showed that the effect on Pdgfr expression was, in part, mediated by direct transcriptional regulation of the ECM protein tenascin C (Tnc), which was necessary and sufficient for Pdgfrα/β expression in lung explants. Moreover, this pathway was highly upregulated in a mouse model of asthma and in lung tissue from patients with pulmonary hypertension. Together, these data define a Wnt/Tnc/Pdgfr signaling axis that is critical for smooth muscle development and disease progression in the lung.

Introduction

The mammalian lung is a highly complex organ that develops from the anterior foregut through interactions between the anterior foregut endoderm and the surrounding mesenchyme. Early in development epithelial-mesenchymal interactions pattern the lung endoderm and mesenchymal components leading to distinct cells types along the proximal-distal axis of the lung. These patterning events are essential for proper development of both the airway epithelial cells required for gas exchange and surfactant expression and development of the pulmonary vasculature and airway smooth muscle. Some of the key pathways that regulate these epithelial-mesenchymal interactions include Vegf, Bmp, Shh, and Wnt, but the mechanisms by which they regulate lung mesenchymal development, in particular smooth muscle development, are poorly understood (reviewed in ref. 1 ). Defects in these developmental processes lead to several important lung diseases, including pulmonary hypertension and asthma. For example, mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 gene are a leading cause of familial pulmonary hypertension, underscoring the link between important developmental pathways and adult lung disease ( 2 , 3 ).

Wnt signaling is a key regulator of multiple aspects of tissue development. The canonical Wnt pathway involves the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin through the binding of Wnt ligands to the frizzled/LRP coreceptor complex. β-Catenin acts as a powerful trans-activator of LEF/TCF transcription factors, regulating important downstream target genes that promote cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue development. Despite a growing list of general target genes, less is known about the tissue-specific targets for this pathway. In the lung, Wnt signaling has been shown to regulate airway epithelial differentiation, proliferation, and vascular smooth muscle development ( 4 – 8 ). In particular, loss of Wnt7b leads to decreased mesenchymal differentiation and proliferation and later in development decreased VSMC integrity and pulmonary hemorrhage ( 8 ). VSMCs in Wnt7b lacZ mutants exhibits either a hypertrophic and apoptotic appearance or significant thinning, which suggests that defective VSMC development leads to hypertrophy, cell death, and subsequent thinning of the vessel wall and hemorrhage ( 8 ). Since Wnt7b is expressed exclusively in the developing airway epithelium, these data demonstrate important epithelial-mesenchymal signaling by Wnt7b that regulates lung VSMC development and function.

Given the importance of Wnt signaling in lung epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and lung development in general, we sought to define the molecular program acting downstream of Wnt7b and β-catenin signaling in the development of smooth muscle precursors in the mesenchyme. Using in vivo gain- and loss-of-function analyses combined with differential gene expression assays, we define a molecular program regulated by Wnt7b and β-catenin through tenascin C (Tnc), Pdgfrα, and Pdgfrβ, which are important for smooth muscle precursor development. Importantly, we find that this Wnt/Tnc/Pdgfr pathway is upregulated in mouse and human models of asthma and pulmonary hypertension. These data provide important insight into the role for Wnt signaling in lung SMC development, providing evidence that Wnt signaling regulates early smooth muscle precursor differentiation in the lung as well as influences SMC development in the adult lung.

Discussion

Defects in pulmonary smooth muscle development and function are leading contributors to numerous lung diseases, including pulmonary hypertension and asthma. Although signaling between airway epithelium and airway smooth muscle is critical for development of each of these cell lineages, little is understood about the relevance of these interactions in development and human disease. Expression of Tnc and Pdgfrβ is linked with several adult lung diseases, including asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension ( 23 , 26 – 28 ). We show that paracrine Wnt signaling from the developing airway epithelium is required for expansion and development of smooth muscle precursors in the lung through a Wnt/Tnc/Pdgfr signaling axis. Moreover, we show that expression and activity of this pathway is increased in a mouse asthma model and in human PAH patients. Thus, our data establish the critical importance of a Wnt/Tnc/Pdgfr pathway in both lung development and adult lung disease.

Many airway diseases in the lung are the result of environmental insults and the subsequent inflammatory response from these chronic injuries. Diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma involve damage by prolonged exposure to environmental agents followed by successive rounds of inflammation and wound healing. During these processes, SMCs and myofibroblasts rapidly proliferate and expand to replace damaged tissue. However, expansion of these mesenchymal cell types and subsequent deposition of abnormal amounts of ECM proteins can become disruptive to airway and vascular function. Interestingly, Wnt7b and Tnc expression are both upregulated in mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis, and Wnt7b and Pdgfrβ are upregulated in some forms of human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and hypertension, respectively ( 23 , 26 – 30 ). Moreover, polymorphisms in Tnc and Pdgfrβ have been linked to asthma, while Tnc mutations attenuate ovalbumin-induced asthma in mice including the associated increase in the numbers of bronchiolar goblet cells, a phenotype that can be mimicked by activating canonical Wnt signaling in the airway epithelium ( 31 – 34 ). Taken together, our results suggest that the Wnt/Tnc/Pdgfr signaling axis described in this paper may be a common link in human airway disease.

Our findings demonstrate that Tnc is a direct target of Wnt signaling in the lung and that loss of Tnc, and in turn Pdgfrβ expression, is in part responsible for the SMC defects observed in Wnt7b lacZ -null mutants. A previous report showed that decreased Tnc expression leads to SMC apoptosis ( 22 ). Thus, loss of Tnc might be a primary cause of the increased apoptosis observed in the VSMCs of Wnt7b-deficient animals ( 8 ). Other ECM proteins, including fibronectin (Fn), have been shown to be targets of Wnt signaling ( 35 ). ECM proteins are critical regulators of stem/progenitor cell differentiation and act primarily through regulation of cell-ECM interactions, which helps create specific microenvironments or niches within tissues that are critical for stem/progenitor cell self-renewal and differentiation. Given the role of Wnt signaling in the regulation of precursor and progenitor populations, governing the expression of ECM proteins is likely an important mechanism underlying the ability of Wnt signaling to regulate proliferation and differentiation of SMC precursors in the lung. Tnc likely acts cooperatively with other ECM proteins to promote proper SMC development in part through regulation of smooth muscle precursor expansion and differentiation. Interestingly, Tnc and Fn have been shown to cooperatively regulate SMC proliferation and migration, respectively, in models of pulmonary hypertension ( 20 ). Thus, the ability of Wnt signaling to regulate both Tnc and Fn reveals a critical role for this pathway not only in lung SMC development and diseases but also in SMC populations in other tissues.

Although our data demonstrate that Wnt7b plays an important role in the paracrine regulation of lung smooth muscle development, other Wnt ligands likely act redundantly with Wnt7b in this process. One such ligand, Wnt7a, is expressed in airway epithelium, but lung defects have not been reported ( 36 ). Importantly, we show that Wnt7a expression is significantly upregulated in the lungs of Wnt7b lacZ -null mutants. Mouse Wnt5a mutants exhibit defects in lung mesenchymal proliferation, although specific smooth muscle defects were not reported ( 37 ). Conversely, overexpression of Wnt5a leads to defects in lung vascular development through repression of Shh, which in turn leads to increased Fn expression ( 38 ). Since Wnt5a is a non-canonical Wnt and non-canonical signaling often antagonizes canonical signaling, these findings suggest that multiple Wnt ligands expressed in lung epithelium might act cooperatively to balance SMC differentiation in the lung. In addition to Wnt ligand redundancy, the source of SMC precursors has recently expanded to include mesothelial cell migration followed by epithelial to mesenchymal transformation to generate VSMCs in the lung ( 39 ). Thus, Wnt signaling may be important in orchestrating the complex series of developmental processes required for proper SMC development injury response in the lung.

Our findings showing that Wnt7b and canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling affects both smooth muscle development and survival provides a new and important pathway to target for therapeutic intervention in smooth muscle–dependent lung diseases including asthma and pulmonary hypertension. Wnt signaling is under intensive investigation as a target for anticancer drugs, and therapies derived from these studies may be useful in treating pulmonary diseases, especially ones characterized by excessive smooth muscle proliferation.
