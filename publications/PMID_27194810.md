The nuclear pore complex (NPC) enables transport across the nuclear envelope. It 
is one of the largest multiprotein assemblies in the cell, built from about 30 
proteins called nucleoporins (Nups), organized into distinct subcomplexes. 
Structure determination of the NPC is a major research goal. The assembled 
∼40-112 MDa NPC can be visualized by cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET), while 
Nup subcomplexes are studied crystallographically. Docking the crystal 
structures into the cryo-ET maps is difficult because of limited resolution. 
Further, intersubcomplex contacts are not well characterized. Here, we 
systematically investigated direct interactions between Nups. In a 
comprehensive, structure-based, yeast two-hybrid interaction matrix screen, we 
mapped protein-protein interactions in yeast and human. Benchmarking against 
crystallographic and coaffinity purification data from the literature 
demonstrated the high coverage and accuracy of the data set. Novel 
intersubcomplex interactions were validated biophysically in microscale 
thermophoresis experiments and in intact cells through protein fragment 
complementation. These intersubcomplex interaction data provide direct 
experimental evidence toward possible structural arrangements of architectural 
elements within the assembled NPC, or they may point to assembly intermediates. 
Our data favors an assembly model in which major architectural elements of the 
NPC, notably the Y-complex, exist in different structural contexts within the 
scaffold.
