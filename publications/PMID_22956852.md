One of the current challenges of neurodegenerative disease research is to 
determine whether signaling pathways that are essential to cellular homeostasis 
might contribute to neuronal survival and modulate the pathogenic process in 
human disease. In Caenorhabditis elegans, sir-2.1/SIRT1 overexpression protects 
neurons from the early phases of expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) toxicity, and 
this protection requires the longevity-promoting factor daf-16/FOXO. Here, we 
show that this neuroprotective effect also requires the DAF-16/FOXO partner 
bar-1/β-catenin and putative DAF-16-regulated gene ucp-4, the sole mitochondrial 
uncoupling protein (UCP) in nematodes. These results fit with a previously 
proposed mechanism in which the β-catenin FOXO and SIRT1 proteins may together 
regulate gene expression and cell survival. Knockdown of β-catenin enhanced the 
vulnerability to cell death of mutant-huntingtin striatal cells derived from the 
HdhQ111 knock-in mice. In addition, this effect was compensated by SIRT1 
overexpression and accompanied by the modulation of neuronal UCP expression 
levels, further highlighting a cross-talk between β-catenin and SIRT1 in the 
modulation of mutant polyQ cytoxicity. Taken together, these results suggest 
that integration of β-catenin, sirtuin and FOXO signaling protects from the 
early phases of mutant huntingtin toxicity.

Abstract

One of the current challenges of neurodegenerative disease research is to determine whether signaling pathways that are essential to cellular homeostasis might contribute to neuronal survival and modulate the pathogenic process in human disease. In Caenorhabditis elegans , sir-2.1 /SIRT1 overexpression protects neurons from the early phases of expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) toxicity, and this protection requires the longevity-promoting factor daf-16/ FOXO. Here, we show that this neuroprotective effect also requires the DAF-16/FOXO partner bar-1 /β-catenin and putative DAF-16-regulated gene ucp-4 , the sole mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP) in nematodes. These results fit with a previously proposed mechanism in which the β-catenin FOXO and SIRT1 proteins may together regulate gene expression and cell survival. Knockdown of β-catenin enhanced the vulnerability to cell death of mutant-huntingtin striatal cells derived from the HdhQ111 knock-in mice. In addition, this effect was compensated by SIRT1 overexpression and accompanied by the modulation of neuronal UCP expression levels, further highlighting a cross-talk between β-catenin and SIRT1 in the modulation of mutant polyQ cytoxicity. Taken together, these results suggest that integration of β-catenin, sirtuin and FOXO signaling protects from the early phases of mutant huntingtin toxicity.

Introduction

Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited CAG repeat disorder with expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts in huntingtin (htt), causing striatal and cortical degeneration ( Walker, 2007 ). While a person carrying more than 39 CAG repeats will invariably develop HD, the age at onset of HD varies considerably. The CAG expansions account for about 60% of the variability of the age at onset of HD, and the residual variability may be heritable, suggesting that other genes influence age at onset ( Li et al., 2003 ; Gayán et al., 2008 ; Metzger et al., 2008 ; Taherzadeh-Fard et al., 2009 ; Xu et al., 2009 ). Given that HD is an age-related disorder, candidate gene approaches based on longevity modulators have been examined to identify disease modifiers. Studies of TCERG1, an evolutionary conserved transcriptional regulator that modulates longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Ghazi et al., 2009 ), showed that this protein is neuroprotective in models of HD ( Arango et al., 2006 ) and that its polymorphic Gln-Ala repeat modifies HD in American patients ( Holbert et al., 2001 ). Another longevity modulator with neuroprotective activities is the transcription factor daf-16 /FOXO. FOXO proteins are essential for stress resistance ( Brunet et al., 2004 ), and daf-16 is required for neuroprotection by increased dosage of sirtuin sir-2.1/ SIRT1 in expanded-polyQ nematodes ( Parker et al., 2005 ). Several cofactors regulate FOXO activity, and FOXOs have many targets ( Greer and Brunet, 2008 ; Landis and Murphy, 2010 ; Yen et al., 2011 ), suggesting that a network of genes centered onto FOXO might regulate mutant polyglutamine neuron survival and have a role in HD variability. Interestingly, in this regard FOXO activity may be conserved from C. elegans to humans, as human FOXO3A was associated with the ability to be long lived in several populations of centenarians ( Willcox et al., 2008 ; Anselmi et al., 2009 ; Li et al., 2009 ; Soerensen et al., 2010 ). Here, we investigated the neuroprotective role of the Wnt effector BAR-1/β-catenin, a protein that also binds to DAF-16/FOXO3a to regulate its transcriptional activity in response to oxidative stress in both C. elegans and mammalian cells ( Essers et al., 2005 ), and that of ucp-4 , the sole mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP) in C. elegans and putative DAF-16 transcriptional target. To this end, we used C. elegans transgenics expressing exon-1 like htt in touch receptor neurons ( Parker et al., 2005 ). Animals expressing expanded polyQs show a strong neuronal dysfunction phenotype (defective response to touch) in the absence of cell death ( Parker et al., 2005 ), recapitulating an early phase of mutant htt neurotoxicity. Additionally, we tested for the effects of SIRT1, β-catenin, and neuronal UCPs (UCP2, UCP4) on the survival of striatal cells derived from htt knock-in mice ( Trettel et al., 2000 ). As detailed below, our results suggest that integration of β-catenin, sirtuin, and FOXO signaling protects against the early phases of mutant htt toxicity.

Discussion

The Sir2/SIRT1 gene and its target daf-16 /FOXO have emerged as potent protective factors for HD and other degenerative diseases ( Morley et al., 2002 ; Parker et al., 2005 ; Cohen et al., 2006 ; Kim et al., 2007 ; Jeong et al., 2011 ; Jiang et al., 2011 ). Since FOXO integrates numerous signals and regulates the expression of many genes ( Greer and Brunet, 2008 ; Landis and Murphy, 2010 ; Yen et al., 2011 ), an essential question is how the FOXO network protects HD neurons. Does it play a role in the early phases of mutant htt toxicity such as neuronal dysfunction and vulnerability to cell death?

Our data show that β-catenin, SIRT1, and UCPs may participate in the regulation of vulnerability to cell death of mutant htt striatal cells, which is consistent with the protective effect of increased sir-2.1 dosage against neuron dysfunction in 128Q nematodes, an effect that requires daf-16 /FOXO ( Parker et al., 2005 ), the FOXO cofactor bar-1 /β-catenin ( Essers et al., 2005 ), and ucp-4 , which we suggest to be a DAF-16 regulated gene. As summarized in Figure 6 , these results are consistent with a previously proposed model in which the SIRT1, FOXO, and β-catenin proteins may form a complex in the nucleus to regulate gene expression in nematodes and other species ( Tissenbaum and Guarente, 2001 ; Brunet et al., 2004 ; Essers et al., 2005 ; Berdichevsky et al., 2006 ; Wang et al., 2006 ). Importantly, neuroprotective effects of SIRT1 activation were recently reported in several mouse models of HD ( Jeong et al., 2011 ; Jiang et al., 2011 ), and FOXO3a acetylation may be involved in SIRT1 protection ( Jiang et al., 2011 ), which corroborates the C. elegans data. In addition, neuroprotective effects of β-catenin were consistently observed in expanded-polyQ nematodes and mutant htt striatal cells. However, we observed differences between C. elegans and mouse striatal cells for UCP activity. This is expected, as evolutionary diversity in gene family function is a widely observed phenomenon. The UCPs can have profound effects on neurons with chronic uncoupling, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and elevated ATP levels ( Andrews et al., 2005b ). The enhancement of 128Q toxicity in nematode ucp-4 mutants suggests that ucp-4 normally protect neurons from the dysfunction induced by expanded polyQ expression. However, for mouse striatal cells that express mutant htt, while UCP4 may normally contribute to their vulnerability, UCP2 may protect from it. This is consistent with the neuroprotective effect of UCP2 overexpression in mouse models of Parkinson's disease ( Andrews et al., 2005a ). While the C. elegans and mouse striatal cell model both emphasized the neuroprotective effects of β-catenin, they showed differences in their ability to account for the cross-talk between Sir2/SIRT1 and β-catenin. Expanded polyQ nematodes indicated that bar-1 /β-catenin is required for sir-2.1 /SIRT1 overexpression to be neuroprotective. However, mutant htt striatal cells poorly recapitulated the neuroprotective effects of SIRT1 overexpression and primarily indicated that SIRT1 overexpression compensates for the detrimental effect of β-catenin reduction.

These results highlight the complexity of the regulation around FOXO factors ( Greer and Brunet, 2008 ; Landis and Murphy, 2010 ; Yen et al., 2011 ), and they illustrate how the conclusions about the role of cell survival genes may be influenced by the methodological and cellular context in which their activity is assessed. For example, SIRT1 was reported to deacetylate β-catenin and suppress its ability to activate transcription in mammalian cells ( Firestein et al., 2008 ), which appears to contrast with our findings. However, this study was performed in human colon cancer cell lines, where SIRT1-β-catenin homeostasis may be different compared to neurons and cells expressing expanded polyQs. In addition, several studies have indicated that β-catenin is an important survival factor in normal ( Essers et al., 2005 ) and diseased ( Inestrosa and Arenas, 2010 ) cells through its ability to coactivate either TCF (T-cell factor) or FOXO transcription factors. However, a study of neuronal cell death in HD has suggested that abnormal accumulation of β-catenin may cause neurotoxicity ( Godin et al., 2010 ). Since β-catenin is neuroprotective against the early phases of mutant polyQ cytotoxicity (neuron dysfunction, cell vulnerability), this suggests that β-catenin homeostasis and activity may change along the pathogenic process in HD.

Finally, the activation of cell survival mechanisms controlled by FOXO factors may contribute to delaying HD pathogenesis. Our data indeed suggest that GSK-3β inhibitors require the FOXO network for protecting neurons from the dysfunction induced by expanded polyQs, suggesting that GSK-3β may have potential for the treatment of HD. In conclusion, our data reveal that neuroprotection by sirtuin sir-2.1 from expanded polyQs requires β-catenin and ucp-4 in C. elegans , suggesting that FOXO interactors modulate the early phases of mutant polyQ cytotoxicity. Our findings raise the possibility that FOXO interactors might have a role in the modification of the pathogenic process in HD, and this will be addressed in future studies.
