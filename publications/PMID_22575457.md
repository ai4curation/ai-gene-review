In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cAMP/pKA pathway plays a major role in metabolism, 
stress resistance and proliferation control. cAMP is produced by adenylate 
cyclase, which is activated both by Gpr1/Gpa2 system and Ras proteins, regulated 
by Cdc25/Sdc25 guanine exchange factors and Ira GTPase activator proteins. 
Recently, both Ras2 and Cdc25 RasGEF were reported to localize not only in 
plasma membrane but also in internal membranes. Here, the subcellular 
localization of Ras signaling complex proteins was investigated both by 
fluorescent tagging and by biochemical cell membrane fractionation on sucrose 
gradients. Although a consistent minor fraction of Ras signaling complex 
components was found in plasma membrane during exponential growth on glucose, 
Cdc25 appears to localize mainly on ER membranes, while Ira2 and Cyr1 are also 
significantly present on mitochondria. Moreover, PKA Tpk1 catalytic subunit 
overexpression induces Ira2 protein to move from mitochondria to ER membranes. 
These data confirm the hypothesis that different branches of Ras signaling 
pathways could involve different subcellular compartments, and that 
relocalization of Ras signaling complex components is subject to PKA control.
