The [NiFe] centers at the active sites of the Escherichia coli hydrogenase 
enzymes are assembled by a team of accessory proteins that includes the products 
of the hyp genes. To determine whether any other proteins are involved in this 
process, the sequential peptide affinity system was used. The analysis of the 
proteins in a complex with HypB revealed the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase 
SlyD, a metal-binding protein that has not been previously linked to the 
hydrogenase biosynthetic pathway. The association between HypB and SlyD was 
confirmed by chemical cross-linking of purified proteins. Deletion of the slyD 
gene resulted in a marked reduction of the hydrogenase activity in cell extracts 
prepared from anaerobic cultures, and an in-gel assay was used to demonstrate 
diminished activities of both hydrogenase 1 and 2. Western analysis revealed a 
decrease in the final proteolytic processing of the hydrogenase 3 HycE protein, 
indicating that the metal center was not assembled properly. These deficiencies 
were all rescued by growth in medium containing excess nickel, but zinc did not 
have any phenotypic effect. Experiments with radioactive nickel demonstrated 
that less nickel accumulated in DeltaslyD cells compared with wild type, and 
overexpression of SlyD from an inducible promoter doubled the level of cellular 
nickel. These experiments demonstrate that SlyD has a role in the nickel 
insertion step of the hydrogenase maturation pathway, and the possible functions 
of SlyD are discussed.
