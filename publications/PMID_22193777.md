The partner and localizer of breast cancer 2 susceptibility protein (PALB2) is 
crucial for the repair of DNA damage by homologous recombination. Here, we 
report that chromatin-association motif (ChAM), an evolutionarily conserved 
motif in PALB2, is necessary and sufficient to mediate its chromatin association 
in both unperturbed and damaged cells. ChAM is distinct from the previously 
described PALB2 DNA-binding regions. Deletion of ChAM decreases PALB2 and Rad51 
accumulation at DNA damage sites and confers cellular hypersensitivity to the 
genotoxic drug mitomycin C. These results suggest that PALB2 chromatin 
association via ChAM facilitates PALB2 function in the cellular resistance to 
DNA damage.
