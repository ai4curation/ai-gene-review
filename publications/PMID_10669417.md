The roles of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C (PLC) in 
chemoattractant-elicited responses were studied in mice lacking these key 
enzymes. PI3Kgamma was required for chemoattractant-induced production of 
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns (3,4,5)P3] and has an important 
role in chemoattractant-induced superoxide production and chemotaxis in mouse 
neutrophils and in production of T cell-independent antigen-specific antibodies 
composed of the immunoglobulin lambda light chain (TI-IglambdaL). The study of 
the mice lacking PLC-beta2 and -beta3 revealed that the PLC pathways have an 
important role in chemoattractant-mediated production of superoxide and 
regulation of protein kinases, but not chemotaxis. The PLC pathways also appear 
to inhibit the chemotactic activity induced by certain chemoattractants and to 
suppress TI-IglambdaL production.
