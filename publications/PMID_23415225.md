AP-1 is a clathrin adaptor complex that sorts cargo between the trans-Golgi 
network and endosomes. AP-1 recruitment to these compartments requires Arf1-GTP. 
The crystal structure of the tetrameric core of AP-1 in complex with Arf1-GTP, 
together with biochemical analyses, shows that Arf1 activates cargo binding by 
unlocking AP-1. Unlocking is driven by two molecules of Arf1 that bridge two 
copies of AP-1 at two interaction sites. The GTP-dependent switch I and II 
regions of Arf1 bind to the N terminus of the β1 subunit of one AP-1 complex, 
while the back side of Arf1 binds to the central part of the γ subunit trunk of 
a second AP-1 complex. A third Arf1 interaction site near the N terminus of the 
γ subunit is important for recruitment, but not activation. These observations 
lead to a model for the recruitment and activation of AP-1 by Arf1.
