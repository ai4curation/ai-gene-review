Amino acid transport across cellular membranes is mediated by multiple 
transporters with overlapping specificities. We recently have identified the 
vertebrate proteins which mediate Na+-independent exchange of large neutral 
amino acids corresponding to transport system L. This transporter consists of a 
novel amino acid permease-related protein (LAT1 or AmAT-L-lc) which for surface 
expression and function requires formation of disulfide-linked heterodimers with 
the glycosylated heavy chain of the h4F2/CD98 surface antigen. We show that 
h4F2hc also associates with other mammalian light chains, e.g. y+LAT1 from mouse 
and human which are approximately 48% identical with LAT1 and thus belong to the 
same family of glycoprotein-associated amino acid transporters. The novel 
heterodimers form exchangers which mediate the cellular efflux of cationic amino 
acids and the Na+-dependent uptake of large neutral amino acids. These transport 
characteristics and kinetic and pharmacological fingerprints identify them as 
y+L-type transport systems. The mRNA encoding my+LAT1 is detectable in most 
adult tissues and expressed at high levels in kidney cortex and intestine. This 
suggests that the y+LAT1-4F2hc heterodimer, besides participating in amino acid 
uptake/secretion in many cell types, is the basolateral amino acid exchanger 
involved in transepithelial reabsorption of cationic amino acids; hence, its 
defect might be the cause of the human genetic disease lysinuric protein 
intolerance.
