Introduction

Recruitment of eukaryotic mRNAs to the ribosome requires coordinated interactions between initiation factors and the 40S ribosomal subunit. One possible recruitment model involves the initial selection of an mRNA by association of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) 2 complex with the 5′-7-methyl guanosine cap structure ( 1 – 4 ). This complex consists of the cap-binding protein, eIF4E, the DEAD-box helicase, eIF4A, and the scaffold protein, eIF4G. The eIF4A component likely unwinds any cap-proximal secondary structure so that it can then bind to the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S-PIC). The ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activity of eIF4A is strongly stimulated by eIF4G and the accessory protein eIF4B ( 5 – 9 ). In addition to its cap binding function, eIF4E also serves to promote mRNA restructuring by stimulating the helicase activity of eIF4A ( 10 ). Once a single-stranded region of the mRNA is available it can stably bind into the decoding site of the 43S-PIC.

In mammals, the interaction between the eIF4F-mRNA complex and the 43S-PIC is likely stabilized by a direct interaction between eIF4G and eIF3 ( 11 – 14 ). The importance of this interaction for controlling translation is implied from the observation that the affinity between eIF4G and eIF3 is increased by insulin treatment in vivo ( 15 ). Specifically, the activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is required to stabilize the interaction between these binding partners ( 15 , 16 ). It has also been suggested that eIF4A and eIF3 may bind in a cooperative manner to eIF4G since a greater amount of eIF3 can be immunoprecipitated with eIF4G in the presence of eIF4A using purified components ( 11 ). However, this has not been confirmed by using a quantitative binding assay.

Human eIF4G has been shown to possess a distinct ∼90 amino acid domain that forms a high affinity interaction with the eIF3 complex in vitro ( 11 ). This binding domain can compete with full-length eIF4G for binding to eIF3, implying that this region is indeed sufficient for binding eIF3 ( 11 ). The importance of this interaction for translation has been investigated by in vitro and in vivo translation assays using an eIF4G construct containing a quadruple alanine mutation in the eIF3 binding domain ( 17 ). This study showed that the mutant is less active in stimulating translation in a protease treated in vitro reticulocyte lysate system ( 17 ). In contrast, there is little difference between the ability of this mutant eIF4G protein to stimulate translation in vivo compared with wild type eIF4G ( 17 ). It is difficult to interpret the full effect of this particular mutation on translation since no quantitative binding data has been generated to determine its effect on the affinity between eIF4G and eIF3. Nevertheless, these data may imply that a substantial amount of redundancy exists between initiation factor interactions. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that no single interaction is essential for mRNA recruitment to the 40S subunit.

Because of its large molecular mass and complexity, it has been difficult to identify the exact binding site of eIF4G on the eIF3 complex. Human eIF3 possesses an anthropomorphic five-lobed structure that contains 13 non-identical subunits that range in size from ∼25 kDa to 170 kDa ( 18 – 22 ). It has been shown that eIF4G makes a direct interaction with the eIF3e subunit within the context of the eIF3 complex ( 23 ). To determine this, an affinity tagged minimum eIF3 binding region of eIF4G was used as bait to fish out eIF3 subunit fragments from a partially proteolyzed eIF3 complex. One limitation of this approach is that it does not rule out the possibility that other eIF3 subunits may be important in stabilizing the interaction with eIF4G when eIF3 is not proteolyzed.

Here, we have employed an anisotropy assay to quantitatively show that human eIF4G binds to eIF3 independently of eIF4A. To further characterize the eIF4G-binding surface in eIF3, we have employed two different cross-linking approaches that utilize a minimum binding domain in eIF4G and intact purified eIF3. Our data reveal that three subunits of eIF3 (eIF3c, -d, and -e) form a binding surface for eIF4G. We further show that the previously identified eIF3-binding domain in eIF4G is comprised of two distinct subdomains that interact with these eIF3 subunits. Finally, we use an eIF4G-dependent reticulocyte lysate system to show that both of these subdomains are required to stimulate translation initiation in vitro .

DISCUSSION

Human eIF4G is a scaffold protein that contains binding sites for other initiation factors, including PABP, eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF3. The importance of individual initiation factor binding sites in eIF4G on mRNA translation has been investigated in vitro and in vivo ( 17 ). The relative contribution of the eIF4G-PABP interaction appears to be relatively modest in both yeast and mammalian mRNA translation ( 17 , 40 , 41 ). In contrast, the interactions of eIF4E and eIF4A with eIF4G play a critical role in mRNA recruitment, restructuring and translation ( 10 , 42 , 43 ). More recently, it has become evident that the interaction of eIF4G with RNA is also required for efficient mRNA recruitment and translation initiation ( 44 , 45 ). The exact contribution of the eIF4G-eIF3 interaction in mRNA recruitment and scanning is less clear. No direct interaction between eIF4G and eIF3 has been identified in yeast, but a direct interaction has been identified in mammals and proposed to play an important role in mRNA recruitment and translation ( 12 ). Precise truncation analysis has revealed a ∼90 amino acid region of human eIF4G that constitutes the minimal eIF3-binding domain in the absence of the 40S ribosomal subunit ( 11 , 13 ).

In this study, we have further characterized the direct interaction between human eIF4G and eIF3. Using a quantitative binding assay, we have established that the affinity between eIF4G and eIF3 is not altered by the presence of eIF4A, at least in the absence of the 40S ribosomal subunit ( Fig. 1 ). This finding is in contrast to previous data using an immunoprecipitation assay that suggested mutually cooperative binding between eIF4A and eIF3 with eIF4G ( 11 ). Since it is not possible to determine the affinity between these initiation factors by using an immunoprecipitation assay, our data strongly suggest that eIF4A and eIF3 bind independently to the middle region of human eIF4G. It is worth noting that both of these studies did not include the C-terminal HEAT repeat that is known to provide a second binding site for eIF4A ( 46 ). It therefore remains to be determined if the C-terminal domain of eIF4G may in turn regulate eIF3 binding in an eIF4A-dependent manner.

Previous work employed a pull-down assay to determine that eIF4G binds directly to the eIF3e subunit of the eIF3 complex ( 23 ). However, this approach is hindered by the requirement to use partially proteolyzed eIF3 to identify eIF4G-interacting subunits. This raises a fundamental question about whether additional eIF3 subunits may help to stabilize the interaction with eIF4G. To address this, we generated two site-specific cross-linking assays to further explore which eIF3 subunits provide a binding surface for eIF4G. Importantly, these cross-linking assays use intact purified eIF3 so that a complete interaction map between these initiation factors can be obtained. Our data unambiguously show that eIF3c, eIF3d, and eIF3e together form a binding surface for eIF4G ( Figs. 3 and 4 ). By using multiple cross-linker positions in the eIF3 binding domain of eIF4G, we are able to generate an interaction model that reveals two distinct binding subdomains in eIF4G that bind to different eIF3 subunits. One subdomain consists of a 40 amino acid region (1011–1051) that binds to eIF3c and eIF3d. An additional subdomain consists of a 52 amino acid region (1052–1104) that binds to eIF3e. Our data imply that the eIF3c and eIF3d-binding sites in eIF4G may overlap, although it should be noted that the resolution of our cross-linking approach is not able to unambiguously determine this. It is also possible that there is a mixture of either eIF3c or eIF3d binding to eIF4G in different cross-linked complexes. A subunit interaction map of human eIF3 previously identified eIF3c, eIF3d and eIF3e as interacting subunits ( 19 ). Using this model, our data provide new constraints to show the eIF4G binding interaction with eIF3c, eIF3d and eIF3e in the context of the complete eIF3 subunit interaction map ( Fig. 6 ). It is interesting to note that eIF3l interacts with eIF3e ( 19 , 47 ). This may account for the small amount of cross-linking observed between eIF4G and eIF3l when using the SDA cross-linker ( Fig. 3 ). Interestingly, it was recently shown using a reconstituted eIF3 complex that the presence of eIF3d was necessary to provide a high affinity interaction with eIF4G ( 20 ). These data correspond well with our new interaction model that implicates eIF3d as an important component of the eIF4G binding site in the eIF3 complex.

We employed an eIF4G-dependent translation assay to establish the biological importance of our interaction model. Previous work suggested that the eIF3e subunit likely provides the highest affinity interaction with eIF4G ( 23 ). Surprisingly, deletion of the eIF3e-binding domain in eIF4G maintains 50–65% translation activity in our assay. Further removal of the eIF3c/d binding domain in eIF4G eliminates this remaining activity. This implies that both of the eIF3 interacting subdomains play important roles in providing the high affinity interaction with eIF3 that is necessary to promote translation initiation. It is important to note that our translation assay directly tethers eIF4G to the mRNA independently of the cap structure. It will therefore be important in the future to determine the exact roles of these two eIF3 interacting subdomains in eIF4G using a cap-dependent translation assay. This will likely require the generation of point mutations in eIF4G that can specifically disrupt individual eIF3 subunit interactions in the context of full-length eIF4G. We anticipate that our interaction model now provides a suitable framework to aid the design of such mutations. In addition, since the interaction is regulated in an mTOR-dependent manner, it is plausible that one or more phosphorylation sites on eIF4G and/or eIF3 may be responsible for altering the affinity between these factors. Our data now suggest that as well as eIF4G, the eIF3c, -d, and -e subunits of the eIF3 complex are possible candidates to be phosphorylated in an mTOR-dependent manner.
