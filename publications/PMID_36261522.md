Most membrane proteins are synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-bound 
ribosomes docked at the translocon, a heterogeneous ensemble of transmembrane 
factors operating on the nascent chain1,2. How the translocon coordinates the 
actions of these factors to accommodate its different substrates is not well 
understood. Here we define the composition, function and assembly of a 
translocon specialized for multipass membrane protein biogenesis3. This 
'multipass translocon' is distinguished by three components that selectively 
bind the ribosome-Sec61 complex during multipass protein synthesis: the GET- and 
EMC-like (GEL), protein associated with translocon (PAT) and back of Sec61 (BOS) 
complexes. Analysis of insertion intermediates reveals how features of the 
nascent chain trigger multipass translocon assembly. Reconstitution studies 
demonstrate a role for multipass translocon components in protein topogenesis, 
and cells lacking these components show reduced multipass protein stability. 
These results establish the mechanism by which nascent multipass proteins 
selectively recruit the multipass translocon to facilitate their biogenesis. 
More broadly, they define the ER translocon as a dynamic assembly whose subunit 
composition adjusts co-translationally to accommodate the biosynthetic needs of 
its diverse range of substrates.
