ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays a critical role in HDL 
cholesterol metabolism, but the mechanism by which it transports lipid across 
membranes is poorly understood. Because growing evidence implicates accessory 
proteins in this process, we developed a method by which proteins interacting 
with the intact transporter could be identified. cDNAs encoding wild-type ABCA1 
and a mutant lacking the C-terminal PDZ binding motif of ABCA1 were transfected 
into 293 cells, and the expressed proteins were solubilized using detergent 
conditions (0.75% CHAPS, 1 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine) predicted to retain high 
affinity protein-protein interactions. Proteins that co-purified with ABCA1 on 
an antibody affinity column were identified by liquid chromatographymass 
spectrometric analysis. A novel interaction with the PDZ protein 
beta1-syntrophin was identified using this approach, and this interaction was 
confirmed in human THP-1 macrophages and in mouse liver. Small interference RNA 
inhibition of beta1-syntrophin expression reduced cholesterol efflux from 
primary skin fibroblasts by 50% while decreasing efflux 30% in bone 
marrow-derived macrophages. Inhibition of beta1-syntrophin decreased ABCA1 
protein levels, whereas overexpression of beta1-syntrophin increased ABCA1 
cell-surface expression and stimulated efflux to apolipoprotein A-I. These 
findings indicate that beta1-syntrophin acts through a class-I PDZ interaction 
with the C terminus of ABCA1 to regulate the cellular distribution and activity 
of the transporter. The approach used to identify beta1-syntrophin as an 
ABCA1-binding protein should prove useful in elucidating other protein 
interactions upon which ABCA1 function depends.
