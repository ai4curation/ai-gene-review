Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA)2b maintains the cellular 
Ca(2+) homeostasis by transferring Ca(2+) from the cytosol to the lumen of the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Recently, SERCA2b has also been shown to be involved 
in the biosynthesis of secreted and membrane proteins via direct protein-protein 
interactions, involving components of the ER folding and quality-control 
machinery, as well as newly synthesized G protein-coupled receptors. Here we 
demonstrate that the human delta opioid receptor (hdeltaOR) exists in a ternary 
complex with SERCA2b and the ER molecular chaperone calnexin. The interaction 
between SERCA2b and hdeltaOR in vivo did not require calnexin as it was 
independent of the C-terminal calnexin-interacting domain of SERCA2b. However, 
the receptor was able to mediate co-immunoprecipitation of calnexin with the 
C-terminally truncated SERCA2b. The association of SERCA2b with hdeltaOR was 
regulated in vitro by Ca(2+) and ATP in a manner that was opposite to the 
calnexin-hdeltaOR interaction. Importantly, co-expression of the catalytically 
inactive SERCA2b(D351A) or calnexin binding-compromised SERCA2bDeltaC mutants 
with the receptor decreased the expression of mature receptors in a manner that 
did not directly relate to changes in the ER Ca(2+) concentration. We conclude 
that dynamic interactions among SERCA2b, calnexin and the hdeltaOR precursor 
orchestrate receptor biogenesis and are regulated by Ca(2+) and ATP. We further 
hypothesize that the primary role of SERCA2b in this process is to act as a 
Ca(2+) sensor in the vicinity of active translocons, integrating protein folding 
with local fluctuations of ER Ca(2+) levels.
