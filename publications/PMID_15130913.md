OBJECTIVE: Cyclophilin A (CyPA) is an abundant intracellular protein that is 
considered to be the main target of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A. 
We and others showed that CyPA is secreted from smooth muscle cells and 
macrophages in response to oxidative stress and lipopolysaccharide, suggesting a 
role for CyPA in inflammation. We therefore studied the proinflammatory effects 
of CyPA on vascular endothelium.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Because atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, we 
studied expression of CyPA in atherosclerotic plaques from the ApoE-/- mouse. 
Using immunohistochemistry, we showed that CyPA was highly expressed in these 
plaques. Because endothelial cells (EC) are important mediators of inflammation, 
we next studied the ability of CyPA to activate EC. Human recombinant CyPA 
activated mitogen-activated protein kinases, including ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 in 
cultured human umbilical vein EC. CyPA also stimulated IkappaB-alpha 
phosphorylation and NF-kappaB activation, and induced expression of adhesion 
molecules including E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. 
Furthermore, the combination of CyPA and cycloheximide induced EC apoptosis 
similar to the proapoptotic effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that CyPA has proinflammatory effects on EC and 
may play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, such as 
atherosclerosis.
