Tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane proteins plays a crucial role in cell 
signaling by recruiting Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing signaling 
molecules. Recently, we have isolated a transmembrane protein designated PZR 
that specifically binds tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which has two SH2 domains 
(Zhao, Z. J., and Zhao, R. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 29367-29372). PZR belongs 
to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Its intracellular segment contains four 
putative sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. By site-specific mutagenesis, we 
found that the tyrosine 241 and 263 embedded in the consensus immunoreceptor 
tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs VIYAQL and VVYADI, respectively, accounted for 
the entire tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR. The interaction between PZR and 
SHP-2 requires involvement of both tyrosyl residues of the former and both SH2 
domains of the latter, since its was disrupted by mutating a single tyrosyl 
residue or an SH2 domain. Overexpression of catalytically inactive but not 
active forms of SHP-2 bearing intact SH2 domains in cells caused 
hyperphosphorylation of PZR. In vitro, tyrosine-phosphorylated PZR was 
efficiently dephosphorylated by the full-length form of SHP-2 but not by its SH2 
domain-truncated form. Together, the data indicate that PZR serves not only as a 
specific anchor protein of SHP-2 on the plasma membrane but also as a 
physiological substrate of the enzyme. The coexisting binding and 
dephosphorylation of PZR by SHP-2 may function to terminate signal transduction 
initiated by PZR and SHP-2 and to set a threshold for the signal transduction to 
be initiated.
