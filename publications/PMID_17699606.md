the COP9 subunit CSN-5.

The GLHs (germline RNA helicases) are constitutive components of the 
germline-specific P granules in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and are 
essential for fertility, yet how GLH proteins are regulated remains unknown. 
KGB-1 and CSN-5 are both GLH binding partners, previously identified by 
two-hybrid interactions. KGB-1 is a MAP kinase in the Jun N-terminal kinase 
(JNK) subfamily, whereas CSN-5 is a subunit of the COP9 signalosome. 
Intriguingly, although loss of either KGB-1 or CSN-5 results in sterility, their 
phenotypes are strikingly different. Whereas csn-5 RNA interference (RNAi) 
results in under-proliferated germlines, similar to glh-1/glh-4(RNAi), the 
kgb-1(um3) loss-of-function mutant exhibits germline over-proliferation. When 
kgb-1(um3) mutants are compared with wild-type C. elegans, GLH-1 protein levels 
are as much as 6-fold elevated and the organization of GLH-1 in P granules is 
grossly disrupted. A series of additional in vivo and in vitro tests indicates 
that KGB-1 and CSN-5 regulate GLH-1 levels, with GLH-1 targeted for proteosomal 
degradation by KGB-1 and stabilized by CSN-5. We propose the ;good cop: bad cop' 
team of CSN-5 and KGB-1 imposes a balance on GLH-1 levels, resulting in germline 
homeostasis. In addition, both KGB-1 and CSN-5 bind Vasa, a Drosophila germ 
granule component; therefore, similar regulatory mechanisms might be conserved 
from worms to flies.
