MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate posttranscriptional 
gene expression. Several microRNAs have been described to regulate the process 
of angiogenesis. Previously, we have shown that bone morphogenetic protein 4 
(BMP4) increased the pro-angiogenic activity of endothelial cells. In this 
project, we now investigated how the pro-angiogenic BMP4 effect is mediated by 
microRNAs. First, we performed a microRNA array with BMP4-stimulated human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Among the top-regulated microRNAs, we 
detected a decreased expression of miR-494 and increased expression of 
miR-126-5p. Next, we analysed the canonical Smad and alternative signalling 
pathways, through which BMP4 would regulate miR-126-5p and miR-494 expression. 
Furthermore, the functional effect of miR-494 and miR-126-5p on endothelial 
cells was investigated. MicroRNA-494 overexpression decreased endothelial cell 
proliferation, migration and sprout formation. Consistently, miR-494 inhibition 
increased endothelial cell function. As potential miR-494 targets, bFGF and BMP 
endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator (BMPER) were identified and 
confirmed by western blot. Luciferase assays showed direct miR-494 binding in 
BMPER 3'UTR. In contrast, miR-126-5p overexpression increased pro-angiogenic 
endothelial cell behaviour and, accordingly, miR-126-5p inhibition decreased 
endothelial cell function. As a direct miR-126-5p target we identified the 
anti-angiogenic thrombospondin-1 which was confirmed by western blot analysis 
and luciferase assays. In the Matrigel plug assay application of antagomiR-494 
increased endothelial cell ingrowth, whereas antagomiR-126-5p treatment 
decreased cell ingrowth in vivo. Taken together, through differential regulation 
of the anti-angiomiR-494 and the angiomiR-126-5p by BMP4 both microRNAs 
contribute to the pro-angiogenic BMP4 effect on endothelial cells.
