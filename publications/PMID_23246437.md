Meiotic chromosomes are organized into arrays of loops that are anchored to the 
chromosome axis structure. Programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that 
initiate meiotic recombination, catalyzed by Spo11 and accessory DSB proteins, 
form in loop sequences in promoters, whereas the DSB proteins are located on 
chromosome axes. Mechanisms bridging these two chromosomal regions for DSB 
formation have remained elusive. Here we show that Spp1, a conserved member of 
the histone H3K4 methyltransferase Set1 complex, is required for normal levels 
of DSB formation and is associated with chromosome axes during meiosis, where it 
physically interacts with the Mer2 DSB protein. The PHD finger module of Spp1, 
which reads H3K4 methylation close to promoters, promotes DSB formation by 
tethering these regions to chromosome axes and activating cleavage by the DSB 
proteins. This paper provides the molecular mechanism linking DSB sequences to 
chromosome axes and explains why H3K4 methylation is important for meiotic 
recombination.
