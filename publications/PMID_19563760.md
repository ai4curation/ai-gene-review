Signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor requires an allosteric 
interaction between the kinase domains of two receptors, whereby one activates 
the other. We show that the intracellular juxtamembrane segment of the receptor, 
known to potentiate kinase activity, is able to dimerize the kinase domains. The 
C-terminal half of the juxtamembrane segment latches the activated kinase domain 
to the activator, and the N-terminal half of this segment further potentiates 
dimerization, most likely by forming an antiparallel helical dimer that engages 
the transmembrane helices of the activated receptor. Our data are consistent 
with a mechanism in which the extracellular domains block the intrinsic ability 
of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains to dimerize and activate, with 
ligand binding releasing this block. The formation of the activating 
juxtamembrane latch is prevented by the C-terminal tails in a structure of an 
inactive kinase domain dimer, suggesting how alternative dimers can prevent 
ligand-independent activation.

Abstract

Signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor requires an allosteric interaction between the kinase domains of two receptors, whereby one activates the other. We show that the intracellular juxtamembrane segment of the receptor, known to potentiate kinase activity, is able to dimerize the kinase domains. The C-terminal half of the juxtamembrane segment latches the activated kinase domain to the activator, and the N-terminal half of this segment further potentiates dimerization, most likely by forming an antiparallel helical dimer that engages the transmembrane helices of the activated receptor. Our data are consistent with a mechanism in which the extracellular domains block the intrinsic ability of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains to dimerize and activate, with ligand binding releasing this block. The formation of the activating juxtamembrane latch is prevented by the C-terminal tails in a new structure of an inactive kinase domain dimer, suggesting how alternative dimers can prevent ligand-independent activation.

Introduction

Inter-cellular signaling in animals relies on receptor tyrosine kinases that consist of an extracellular ligand binding domain and a cytoplasmic kinase domain ( Hubbard and Miller, 2007 ). A distinct sub-family of these receptors includes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also known as ErbB1 or Her1) and its three homologs in humans: ErbB2/Her2 and ErbB4/Her4, which are kinase-active, and ErbB3/Her3, which is not ( Landau and Ben-Tal, 2008 ; Schlessinger, 2002 ; Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001 ). The ligand-dependent dimerization of various combinations of EGFR family members results in phosphorylation of their C-terminal tail segments, which is crucial for cellular proliferation and survival.

Activation of the catalytic domain of EGFR family members is controlled primarily by an allosteric interaction between two protein kinase domains in an asymmetric dimer, rather than by phosphorylation ( Gotoh et al., 1992 ; Stamos et al., 2002 ; Zhang et al., 2006 ). The kinase domain of one receptor molecule (the activator ) plays a role analogous to that of a cyclin bound to a cyclin-dependent protein kinase, and activates the kinase domain of a second receptor (the receiver ) ( Zhang et al., 2006 ) ( Figure 1A ). The formation of the asymmetric dimer appears to underlie the activation of all EGFR family members ( Qiu et al., 2008 ; Zhang et al., 2006 ).

Upon binding ligand, the extracellular domains of EGFR family members dimerize such that their C-terminal ends are brought close together at the junction with the transmembrane segments ( Burgess et al., 2003 ). The transmembrane segments connect to the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane segments of the receptor. The role of the juxtamembrane segment of EGFR family members is distinct from that of typical receptor tyrosine kinases because it activates, rather than inhibits, the kinase domain ( Thiel and Carpenter, 2007 ). The nature of this coupling between the juxtamembrane segment and the kinase domain is not understood.

The juxtamembrane segment of human EGFR spans residues 645 to 682, and we refer to the N-terminal half (residues 645 to 663) as JM-A, and the C-terminal half (residues 664 to 682) as JM-B ( Figure 1B ). An examination of crystal lattice contacts in a previously reported structure of the Her4 kinase domain ( Wood et al., 2008 ) reveals that the JM-B portion of the juxtamembrane segment forms a clamp that reaches across from the N-terminal lobe of the receiver kinase domain in an asymmetric dimer to engage the C-terminal lobe of the activator kinase domain. The significance of this interaction has not been noted previously, but we demonstrate that this interface involving JM-B, which we refer to as the “juxtamembrane latch,” is crucial for receptor activation.

We show that JM-A segments on the receiver and the activator are both required for dimerization and activation, and we propose that the two JM-A segments in an asymmetric kinase domain dimer form short α-helices that are likely to interact in an antiparallel manner and connect to the C-terminal ends of the dimeric form of the transmembrane helices. This allows a model for the entire activated receptor to be built, in which ligand engagement by the extracellular domains stabilizes the formation of the JM-A helical dimer which, in turn, stabilizes the asymmetric kinase domain dimer, resulting in activation.

We have determined a new structure of the EGFR kinase core in which formation of the juxtamembrane latch is blocked by the C-terminal tails of the receptor. This structure forms a symmetrical dimer of inactive kinase domains, and suggests a potential mechanism whereby alternative dimers can prevent ligand-independent activation.

Conclusions

We propose a structural mechanism for the activation of the EGFR receptor by integrating our model for the juxtamembrane segment with the separately determined structures of the transmembrane and extracellular domains ( Figure 5C ). In this model, the proximity of the C-terminal ends of the activated extracellular domains ( Burgess et al., 2003 ) stabilizes the dimer of transmembrane helices observed in the Her2 NMR structure ( Bocharov et al., 2008 ). This provides the proper geometry for the formation of the helical JM-A dimer and the juxtamembrane latch, which activate the kinase domain by stabilizing the asymmetric dimer.

Our model suggests that an important role for the extracellular domain is to inhibit the formation of the activated kinase domain dimer prior to ligand binding, as proposed earlier ( Chantry, 1995 ; Nishikawa et al., 1994 ; Zhu et al., 2003 ). Our model also provides an explanation for why the insertion of a flexible linker between the extracellular domain and the transmembrane segment activates EGFR in the absence of ligand ( Sorokin, 1995 ), since such a linker would decouple the conformation of the extracellular domains from the transmembrane helices. It appears that merely allowing the transmembrane segments to interact in a manner consistent with dimeric engagement of the JM-A helices suffices for activation.

In the absence of ligand the extracellular domains of EGFR adopt a compact conformation that converts to an extended conformation upon ligand binding ( Burgess et al., 2003 ). Conversion of the extracellular domain to the active conformation without dimerization is by itself insufficient for activation ( Mattoon et al., 2004 ). It appears that the extracellular segments either prevent interaction in the absence of ligand, or else dimerize in a way that keeps their C-terminal ends at a distance that is sufficient to prevent the transmembrane segments from stabilizing the dimeric interaction between the juxtamembrane helices. Separation of the C-terminal ends of the extracellular domains in an inactive dimer would be consistent with coupling to the inactive kinase domain dimer that we have described here.

Our structure of an inactive kinase domain dimer reveals that the C-terminal tails are central to the extensive inactive dimer interface that blocks formation of the juxtamembrane latch. Analysis of EGFR mutations in cancer patients has shown that deletion of the C-terminal tail can drive constitutive EGFR activation ( Frederick et al., 2000 ). The formation of pre-formed EGFR dimers has been documented ( Clayton et al., 2008 ; Sako et al., 2000 ), and the intracellular domain is implicated in formation of these dimers ( Yu et al., 2002 ). Thus, inactive kinase dimers may constitute a key autoinhibitory mechanism that prevents ligand-independent activation. The extracellular domains determine the balance between inactive and active dimeric states of the kinase domain, with inactive monomers and dimers predominating prior to EGF stimulation, and active dimers, or higher order assemblies, predominating after stimulation ( Clayton et al., 2008 ) ( Figure 7C ). In this model both the extracellular domains and the inactive dimer work synergistically to prevent the high local concentration of receptors at the membrane from generating spurious signals through uncontrolled trans-phosphorylation. Determining the mechanism by which this balance is achieved remains an important focus for further study.
