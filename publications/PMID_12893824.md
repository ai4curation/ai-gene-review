The c-Abl and Arg tyrosine kinases are activated in the cellular response to 
oxidative stress. The present studies demonstrate that c-Abl and Arg associate 
with glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and that this interaction is regulated by 
intracellular oxidant levels. The c-Abl and Arg SH3 domains bind directly to a 
proline-rich site in GPx1 at amino acids 132-145. GPx1 also functions as a 
substrate for c-Abl- and Arg-mediated phosphorylation on Tyr-96. The results 
further show that c-Abl and Arg stimulate GPx activity and that these kinases 
contribute to GPx-mediated protection of cells against oxidative stress. Our 
findings provide the first evidence that GPx1 is regulated by a signaling 
pathway that is activated in the oxidative stress response.
