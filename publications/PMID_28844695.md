The respiratory megacomplex represents the highest-order assembly of respiratory 
chain complexes, and it allows mitochondria to respond to energy-requiring 
conditions. To understand its architecture, we examined the human respiratory 
chain megacomplex-I2III2IV2 (MCI2III2IV2) with 140 subunits and a subset of 
associated cofactors using cryo-electron microscopy. The MCI2III2IV2 forms a 
circular structure with the dimeric CIII located in the center, where it is 
surrounded by two copies each of CI and CIV. Two cytochrome c (Cyt.c) molecules 
are positioned to accept electrons on the surface of the c1 state CIII dimer. 
Analyses indicate that CII could insert into the gaps between CI and CIV to form 
a closed ring, which we termed the electron transport chain supercomplex. The 
structure not only reveals the precise assignment of individual subunits of 
human CI and CIII, but also enables future in-depth analysis of the electron 
transport chain as a whole.
