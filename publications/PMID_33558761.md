Sphingolipids are essential lipids in eukaryotic membranes. In humans, the first 
and rate-limiting step of sphingolipid synthesis is catalyzed by the serine 
palmitoyltransferase holocomplex, which consists of catalytic components (SPTLC1 
and SPTLC2) and regulatory components (ssSPTa and ORMDL3). However, the 
assembly, substrate processing and regulation of the complex are unclear. Here, 
we present 8 cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human serine 
palmitoyltransferase holocomplex in various functional states at resolutions of 
2.6-3.4 Å. The structures reveal not only how catalytic components recognize the 
substrate, but also how regulatory components modulate the substrate-binding 
tunnel to control enzyme activity: ssSPTa engages SPTLC2 and shapes the tunnel 
to determine substrate specificity. ORMDL3 blocks the tunnel and competes with 
substrate binding through its amino terminus. These findings provide mechanistic 
insights into sphingolipid biogenesis governed by the serine 
palmitoyltransferase complex.
