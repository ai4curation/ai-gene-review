Calcitonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), adrenomedullin (ADM), and 
amylin belong to a unique group of peptide hormones important for homeostasis in 
diverse tissues. Calcitonin is essential for calcium balance, whereas CGRP and 
ADM are important for neurotransmission and cardiovascular and respiratory 
regulation. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we identified intermedin as a novel 
member of the calcitonin/CGRP peptide family. Analysis of intermedin expression 
indicated that intermedin is expressed primarily in the pituitary and 
gastrointestinal tract. Intermedin increased cAMP production in SK-N-MC and L6 
cells expressing endogenous CGRP receptors and competed with labeled CGRP for 
binding to its receptors in these cells. In addition, treatment of 293T cells 
expressing recombinant calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and one of the 
three receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) showed that a CRLR/RAMP 
receptor complex is required for intermedin signaling. In contrast to CGRP and 
ADM, which exhibited a preferential stimulation of CRLR when co-expressed with 
RAMP1 and RAMP2 or RAMP3, respectively, intermedin represents a nonselective 
agonist for the RAMP coreceptors. In vivo studies demonstrated that intermedin 
treatment led to blood pressure reduction in both normal and spontaneously 
hypertensive rats via interactions with the CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes. 
Furthermore, in vivo treatment in mice with intermedin led to suppression of 
gastric emptying activity and food intake. Thus, identification of intermedin as 
a novel member of the calcitonin/CGRP peptide family capable of signaling 
through CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes provides an additional player in the 
regulation of peripheral tissues by CRLR and will allow development of new 
therapeutic agents for pathologies associated with diverse vascular and 
gastrointestinal disorders.
