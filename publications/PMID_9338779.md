Amyloid-beta is a neurotoxic peptide which is implicated in the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease. It binds an intracellular polypeptide known as ERAB, 
thought to be a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme, which is expressed in 
normal tissues, but is overexpressed in neurons affected in Alzheimer's disease. 
ERAB immunoprecipitates with amyloid-beta, and when cell cultures are exposed to 
amyloid-beta, ERAB inside the cell is rapidly redistributed to the plasma 
membrane. The toxic effect of amyloid-beta on these cells is prevented by 
blocking ERAB and is enhanced by overexpression of ERAB. By interacting with 
intracellular amyloid-beta, ERAB may therefore contribute to the neuronal 
dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease.
