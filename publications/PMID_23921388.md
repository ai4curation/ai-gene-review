Hsp70 proteins constitute an evolutionarily conserved protein family of 
ATP-dependent molecular chaperones involved in a wide range of biological 
processes. Mammalian Hsp70 proteins are subject to various post-translational 
modifications, including methylation, but for most of these, a functional role 
has not been attributed. In this study, we identified the methyltransferase 
METTL21A as the enzyme responsible for trimethylation of a conserved lysine 
residue found in several human Hsp70 (HSPA) proteins. This enzyme, denoted by us 
as HSPA lysine (K) methyltransferase (HSPA-KMT), was found to catalyze 
trimethylation of various Hsp70 family members both in vitro and in vivo, and 
the reaction was stimulated by ATP. Furthermore, we show that HSPA-KMT 
exclusively methylates 70-kDa proteins in mammalian protein extracts, 
demonstrating that it is a highly specific enzyme. Finally, we show that 
trimethylation of HSPA8 (Hsc70) has functional consequences, as it alters the 
affinity of the chaperone for both the monomeric and fibrillar forms of the 
Parkinson disease-associated protein α-synuclein.
