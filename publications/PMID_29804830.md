Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic assemblies of mRNPs stalled in translation 
initiation. They are induced by various stress conditions, including exposure to 
the environmental toxin and carcinogen arsenic. While perturbed SG turnover is 
linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, the molecular 
mechanisms underlying SG formation and turnover are still poorly understood. 
Here, we show that ZFAND1 is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of SG 
clearance. ZFAND1 interacts with two key factors of protein degradation, the 26S 
proteasome and the ubiquitin-selective segregase p97, and recruits them to 
arsenite-induced SGs. In the absence of ZFAND1, SGs lack the 26S proteasome and 
p97, accumulate defective ribosomal products, and persist after arsenite 
removal, indicating their transformation into aberrant, disease-linked SGs. 
Accordingly, ZFAND1 depletion is epistatic to the expression of pathogenic 
mutant p97 with respect to SG clearance, suggesting that ZFAND1 function is 
relevant to the multisystem degenerative disorder IBMPFD/ALS.
