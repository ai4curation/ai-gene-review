Chemical modifications of RNA have key roles in many biological processes1-3. 
N7-methylguanosine (m7G) is required for integrity and stability of a large 
subset of tRNAs4-7. The methyltransferase 1-WD repeat-containing protein 4 
(METTL1-WDR4) complex is the methyltransferase that modifies G46 in the variable 
loop of certain tRNAs, and its dysregulation drives tumorigenesis in numerous 
cancer types8-14. Mutations in WDR4 cause human developmental phenotypes 
including microcephaly15-17. How METTL1-WDR4 modifies tRNA substrates and is 
regulated remains elusive18. Here we show,  through structural, biochemical and 
cellular studies of human METTL1-WDR4, that WDR4 serves as a scaffold for METTL1 
and the tRNA T-arm. Upon tRNA binding, the αC region of METTL1 transforms into a 
helix, which together with the α6 helix secures both ends of the tRNA variable 
loop. Unexpectedly, we find that the predicted disordered N-terminal region of 
METTL1 is part of the catalytic pocket and essential for methyltransferase 
activity. Furthermore, we reveal that S27 phosphorylation in the METTL1 
N-terminal region inhibits methyltransferase activity by locally disrupting the 
catalytic centre. Our results provide a molecular understanding of tRNA 
substrate recognition and phosphorylation-mediated regulation of METTL1-WDR4, 
and reveal the presumed disordered N-terminal region of METTL1 as a nexus of 
methyltransferase activity.
