Tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1) mediates most of the biological 
properties of TNF including activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and 
programmed cell death. An approximately 80-amino acid region within the 
intracellular domain of the receptor, termed the death domain, is required for 
signaling NF-kappaB activation and cytotoxicity. A TNF-R1-associated protein 
TRADD has been discovered that interacts with the death domain of the receptor. 
Elevated expression of TRADD in cells triggers both NF-kappaB activation and 
programmed cell death pathways. The biological activities of TRADD have been 
mapped to a 111-amino acid region within the carboxyl-terminal half of the 
protein. This region shows sequence similarity to the death domain of TNF-R1 and 
can self-associate and bind to the TNF-R1 death domain. We have performed an 
alanine scanning mutagenesis of TRADD's death domain to explore the relationship 
among its various functional properties. Mutations affecting the different 
activities of TRADD do not map to discrete regions but rather are spread over 
the entire death domain, suggesting that the death domain is a multifunctional 
unit. A mutant that separates cell killing from NF-kappaB activation by the 
TRADD death domain has been identified indicating that these two signaling 
pathways diverge with TRADD. Additionally, one of the TRADD mutants that fails 
to activate NF-kappaB was found to act as dominant negative mutant capable of 
preventing induction of NF-kappaB by TNFalpha. Such observations provide 
evidence that TRADD performs an obligate role in TNF-induced NF-kappaB 
activation.
