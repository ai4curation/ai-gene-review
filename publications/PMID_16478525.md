Oxidative stress is observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, including 
protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation. One of the major pathological 
hallmarks of AD is the brain deposition of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). This 
42-mer peptide is derived from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is 
associated with oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. Mutations in the PS-1 and 
APP genes, which increase production of the highly amyloidogenic amyloid 
beta-peptide (Abeta42), are the major causes of early onset familial AD. Several 
lines of evidence suggest that enhanced oxidative stress, inflammation, and 
apoptosis play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD. In the present study, 
primary neuronal cultures from knock-in mice expressing mutant human PS-1 and 
APP were compared with those from wild-type mice, in the presence or absence of 
various oxidizing agents, viz, Abeta(1-42), H2O2 and kainic acid (KA). APP/PS-1 
double mutant neurons displayed a significant basal increase in oxidative stress 
as measured by protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and 3-nitrotyrosine when 
compared with the wild-type neurons (p < 0.0005). Elevated levels of human APP, 
PS-1 and Abeta(1-42) were found in APP/PS-1 cultures compared with wild-type 
neurons. APP/PS-1 double mutant neuron cultures exhibited increased 
vulnerability to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis 
induced by Abeta(1-42), H2O2 and KA compared with wild-type neuronal cultures. 
The results are consonant with the hypothesis that Abeta(1-42)-associated 
oxidative stress and increased vulnerability to oxidative stress may contribute 
significantly to neuronal apoptosis and death in familial early onset AD.
