Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the major pathway for ligand internalization into 
eukaryotic cells, is thought to be initiated by the clustering of clathrin and 
adaptors around receptors destined for internalization. However, here we report 
that the membrane-sculpting F-BAR domain-containing Fer/Cip4 homology 
domain-only proteins 1 and 2 (FCHo1/2) were required for plasma membrane 
clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) budding and marked sites of CCV formation. Changes 
in FCHo1/2 expression levels correlated directly with numbers of CCV budding 
events, ligand endocytosis, and synaptic vesicle marker recycling. FCHo1/2 
proteins bound specifically to the plasma membrane and recruited the scaffold 
proteins eps15 and intersectin, which in turn engaged the adaptor complex AP2. 
The FCHo F-BAR membrane-bending activity was required, leading to the proposal 
that FCHo1/2 sculpt the initial bud site and recruit the clathrin machinery for 
CCV formation.
