T cell activation is dependent on both a primary signal delivered through the T 
cell receptor and a secondary costimulatory signal mediated by coreceptors. 
Although controversial, costimulation is thought to act through the specific 
redistribution and clustering of membrane and intracellular kinase-rich lipid 
raft microdomains at the contact site between T cells and antigen-presenting 
cells. This site has been termed the immunological synapse. Endogenous mediators 
of raft clustering in lymphocytes have not been identified, although they are 
essential for T cell activation. We now demonstrate that agrin, an aggregating 
protein crucial for formation of the neuromuscular junction, is also expressed 
in lymphocytes and is important in reorganization of membrane lipid microdomains 
and setting the threshold for T cell signaling. Our data show that agrin induces 
the aggregation of signaling proteins and the creation of signaling domains in 
both immune and nervous systems through a common lipid raft pathway.
