Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) leader protein (EBNALP) coactivates 
promoters with EBNA2 and is important for Epstein-Barr virus immortalization of 
B cells. Investigation of the role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in EBNALP and 
EBNA2 promoter regulation has now identified EBNALP and EBNA2 to be associated 
with HDAC4 in a lymphoblastoid cell line. Furthermore, a transcription-deficient 
EBNALP point mutant did not associate with HDAC4. HDAC4 and 5 overexpression 
repressed EBNA2 activation and EBNALP coactivation, whereas other HDACs had 
little effect. Moreover, EBNALP expression decreased nuclear HDAC4. Expression 
of 14-3-3 anchors HDAC4 in the cytoplasm, increased EBNALP effects, and reversed 
HDAC4 or 5 repression. HDAC4 reversal depended on the HDAC4 nuclear export 
sequence. Consistent with EBNALP coactivation being mediated by nuclear HDAC4 
depletion, HDAC4 overexpression increased nuclear HDAC4 and specifically 
repressed EBNA2-dependent activation as well as EBNALP-dependent coactivation. 
Also, EBNALP, HDAC4, and 14-3-3 could be immunoprecipitated in a single complex. 
Thus, these data strongly support a model in which EBNALP coactivates 
transcription by relocalizing HDAC4 and 5 from EBNA2 activated promoters to the 
cytoplasm. The observed EBNALP effects are likely also in part through HDAC5, 
which is highly homologous to HDAC4.
