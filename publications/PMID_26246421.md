Cilia play important roles in sensing extracellular signals and directing fluid 
flow. Ciliary dysfunction is associated with a variety of diseases known as 
ciliopathies. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) has recently emerged as a major 
driver of ciliary disassembly, but little is known about the downstream players. 
Here we provide the first evidence that HDAC6-mediated deacetylation of 
α-tubulin and cortactin is critical for its induction of ciliary disassembly. 
HDAC6 is localized in the cytoplasm and enriched at the centrosome and basal 
body. Overexpression of HDAC6 decreases the levels of acetylated α-tubulin and 
cortactin without affecting the expression or localization of known ciliary 
regulators. We also find that overexpression of α-tubulin or cortactin or their 
acetylation-deficient mutants enhances the ability of HDAC6 to induce ciliary 
disassembly. In addition, acetylation-mimicking mutants of α-tubulin and 
cortactin counteract HDAC6-induced ciliary disassembly. Furthermore, HDAC6 
stimulates actin polymerization, and inhibition of actin polymerization 
abolishes the activity of HDAC6 to trigger ciliary disassembly. These findings 
provide mechanistic insight into the ciliary role of HDAC6 and underscore the 
importance of reversible acetylation in regulating ciliary homeostasis.
