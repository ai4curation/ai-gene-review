Although studies in C. elegans have identified numerous genes involved in fat 
storage, the next step is to determine how these factors actually affect in vivo 
lipid metabolism. We have developed a (13)C isotope assay to quantify the 
contribution of dietary fat absorption and de novo synthesis to fat storage and 
membrane lipid production in C. elegans, establishing the means by which worms 
obtain and process fatty acids. We applied this method to characterize how 
insulin signaling affects lipid physiology. Several long-lived mutations in the 
insulin receptor gene daf-2 resulted in significantly higher levels of 
synthesized fats in triglycerides and phospholipids. This elevation of fat 
synthesis was completely dependent upon daf-16/FoxO. Other long-lived alleles of 
daf-2 did not increase fat synthesis, however, suggesting that site-specific 
mutations in the insulin receptor can differentially influence longevity and 
metabolism, and that elevated lipid synthesis is not required for the longevity 
of daf-2 mutants.
