A long noncoding RNA, Kcnq1ot1, regulates the expression of both ubiquitously 
and tissue-specific imprinted genes within the Kcnq1 domain. However, the 
functional sequences of the Kcnq1ot1 RNA that mediate lineage-specific 
imprinting are unknown. Here, we have generated a knockout mouse with a deletion 
encompassing an 890-bp silencing domain (Delta890) downstream of the Kcnq1ot1 
promoter. Maternal transmission of the Delta890 allele has no effect on 
imprinting, whereas paternal inheritance of the deletion leads to selective 
relaxation of the imprinting of ubiquitously imprinted genes to a variable 
extent in a tissue-specific manner. Interestingly, the deletion affects DNA 
methylation at somatically acquired differentially methylated regions (DMRs), 
but does not affect the histone modifications of the ubiquitously imprinted 
genes. Importantly, we found that Kcnq1ot1 recruits Dnmt1 to somatic DMRs by 
interacting with Dnmt1, and that this interaction was significantly reduced in 
the Delta890 mice. Thus, the ubiquitous and placental-specific imprinting of 
genes within the Kcnq1 domain might be mediated by distinct mechanisms, and 
Kcnq1ot1 RNA might mediate the silencing of ubiquitously imprinted genes by 
maintaining allele-specific methylation through its interactions with Dnmt1.
