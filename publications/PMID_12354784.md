Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by 
skeletal defects, anemia, chromosomal instability and increased risk of 
leukemia. At the cellular level FA is characterized by increased sensitivity to 
agents forming interstrand crosslinks (ICL) in DNA. Six FA genes have been 
cloned and interactions among individual FANC proteins have been found. The 
FANCD2 protein co-localizes in nuclear foci with the BRCA1 protein following DNA 
damage and during S-phase, requiring the FANCA, C, E and G proteins to do so. 
This finding may reflect a direct role for the BRCA1 protein in double strand 
break (DSB) repair and interaction with the FANC proteins. Therefore 
interactions between BRCA1 and the FANC proteins were investigated. Among the 
known FANC proteins, we find evidence for direct interaction only between the 
FANCA protein and BRCA1. The evidence rests on three different tests: yeast 
two-hybrid analysis, coimmunoprecipitation from in vitro synthesis, and 
coimmunoprecipitation from cell extracts. The amino terminal portion of FANCA 
and the central part (aa 740-1083) of BRCA1 contain the sites of interaction. 
The interaction does not depend on DNA damage, thus FANCA and BRCA1 are 
constitutively interacting. The demonstrated interaction directly connects BRCA1 
to the FA pathway of DNA repair.

Purpose:Outcomes data for DNA damaging therapeutics for men with prostate cancer (PC) and non-BRCA1/2 homologous recombination repair (HRR) mutations are limited. We evaluated outcomes by HRR alteration in men with PC treated with Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and/or platinum chemotherapy.

Outcomes data for DNA damaging therapeutics for men with prostate cancer (PC) and non-BRCA1/2 homologous recombination repair (HRR) mutations are limited. We evaluated outcomes by HRR alteration in men with PC treated with Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and/or platinum chemotherapy.

Patients and Methods:Retrospective data from the PROMISE Consortium were utilized. Clinical outcomes differences were assessed between patients with BRCA1/2 mutations (Cohort A) and those with HRR mutations without direct BRCA complex interaction (Cohort B: ATM, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL). Outcomes in patients with HRR mutations with direct BRCA complex interaction were also explored (Cohort C: RAD51B/C/D, RAD54L2, BARD1, GEN1, PALB2, FANCA, BRIP1).

Outcomes in patients with HRR mutations with direct BRCA complex interaction were also explored (Cohort C: RAD51B/C/D, RAD54L2, BARD1, GEN1, PALB2, FANCA, BRIP1).

Results:One hundred forty-six patients received PARPi (cohort A: 94, cohort B: 45, cohort C: 7) and 104 received platinum chemotherapy (cohort A: 48, cohort B: 44, cohort C: 10). PSA50 response rate to PARPi was higher in cohort A (61%) than cohort B (5%), p < 0.001. Median clinical/radiographic PFS (crPFS) with PARPi in cohort A was significantly longer than cohort B: 15.9 vs. 8.7 months, p=0.005. PSA50 response rate to platinum therapy was higher in cohort A (62%) than cohort B (32%), p=0.024, although crPFS was not significantly different. PSA50 response rate to PARPi and platinum was 40% and 32%, respectively in cohort C. In multivariable analysis cohort A had significantly improved overall survival and crPFS compared to cohort B with PARPi but not platinum chemotherapy.

Conclusion:Patients with BRCA1/2 mutated PC had significantly improved outcomes to PARPi but not platinum chemotherapy compared to those with HRR mutations without direct BRCA complex interaction.
