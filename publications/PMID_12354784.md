Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by 
skeletal defects, anemia, chromosomal instability and increased risk of 
leukemia. At the cellular level FA is characterized by increased sensitivity to 
agents forming interstrand crosslinks (ICL) in DNA. Six FA genes have been 
cloned and interactions among individual FANC proteins have been found. The 
FANCD2 protein co-localizes in nuclear foci with the BRCA1 protein following DNA 
damage and during S-phase, requiring the FANCA, C, E and G proteins to do so. 
This finding may reflect a direct role for the BRCA1 protein in double strand 
break (DSB) repair and interaction with the FANC proteins. Therefore 
interactions between BRCA1 and the FANC proteins were investigated. Among the 
known FANC proteins, we find evidence for direct interaction only between the 
FANCA protein and BRCA1. The evidence rests on three different tests: yeast 
two-hybrid analysis, coimmunoprecipitation from in vitro synthesis, and 
coimmunoprecipitation from cell extracts. The amino terminal portion of FANCA 
and the central part (aa 740-1083) of BRCA1 contain the sites of interaction. 
The interaction does not depend on DNA damage, thus FANCA and BRCA1 are 
constitutively interacting. The demonstrated interaction directly connects BRCA1 
to the FA pathway of DNA repair.

## Full Text

Patients and Methods:

Retrospective data from the PROMISE Consortium were utilized. Clinical outcomes differences were assessed between patients with BRCA1 / 2 mutations (Cohort A) and those with HRR mutations without direct BRCA complex interaction (Cohort B: ATM, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL ). Outcomes in patients with HRR mutations with direct BRCA complex interaction were also explored (Cohort C: RAD51B/C/D, RAD54L2, BARD1, GEN1, PALB2, FANCA, BRIP1 ).

Results:

One hundred forty-six patients received PARPi (cohort A: 94, cohort B: 45, cohort C: 7) and 104 received platinum chemotherapy (cohort A: 48, cohort B: 44, cohort C: 10). PSA50 response rate to PARPi was higher in cohort A (61%) than cohort B (5%), p < 0.001. Median clinical/radiographic PFS (crPFS) with PARPi in cohort A was significantly longer than cohort B: 15.9 vs. 8.7 months, p=0.005. PSA50 response rate to platinum therapy was higher in cohort A (62%) than cohort B (32%), p=0.024, although crPFS was not significantly different. PSA50 response rate to PARPi and platinum was 40% and 32%, respectively in cohort C. In multivariable analysis cohort A had significantly improved overall survival and crPFS compared to cohort B with PARPi but not platinum chemotherapy.

Conclusion:

Patients with BRCA1/2 mutated PC had significantly improved outcomes to PARPi but not platinum chemotherapy compared to those with HRR mutations without direct BRCA complex interaction.

Introduction

Inhibition of the androgen receptor (AR)-signaling program has been the mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer for decades, and while initially effective, resistance invariably develops and men progress to the lethal phenotype of the disease known as metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Given that cross-resistance develops between the AR-targeting agents (ARTAs), therapies with distinct mechanisms of action are needed in order to improve outcomes for men with mCRPC. 1 – 3 To that end, the realization that 20–30% of men with metastatic prostate cancer have mutations in genes involved in homologous recombination repair (HRR) has provided a rationale for developing DNA damaging therapeutic strategies, including poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy. 4 – 9 This is especially important given that patients with mCRPC and BRCA1/2 alterations have worse outcomes with hormonal and taxane therapy compared to those without HRR alterations. 10

In 2020 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors rucaparib and olaparib as monotherapy for men with mCRPC whose tumors harbor pathogenic mutations in selected HRR genes. Subsequent to that, several additional PARP inhibitors (i.e. talazoparib, niraparib, olaparib) in combination with an ARTA have been approved for mCRPC.. While BRCA1/2 mutations qualify patients for any of the above treatment options, two of these agents (olaparib and talazoparib) have broad approvals, with a host of HRR-related gene mutations allowing patients to receive these agents 11 – 16 .

Subset analyses from the phase III PROfound study clearly demonstrate a benefit with olaparib compared to switching ARTA in men with BRCA1 /2 mutations; however, the benefit of PARP inhibitors is unclear in those harboring other mutations (e.g. ATM or CDK12 ) 12 , 13 . In addition, there is only sparse data regarding the activity of PARP inhibition in less common HRR-related genes, and data comparing outcomes to PARP inhibitors between genomic subgroups is even more limited 12 , 17 – 19 . Further, in trials of PARPi plus ARTA compared to ARTA alone, clinical outcomes differed between trials and the benefit of the addition of PARPi was not clear across all HRR genes. 14 – 16 This has created considerable confusion in the field regarding which patients – aside from those with BRCA1/2 mutations – are best suited PARP inhibitor therapy. It is also worth noting that small studies have suggested that platinum-based chemotherapy may benefit patients with HRR gene mutations, although randomized data is not available to inform how to best utilize these agents 7 , 8 .

To address these knowledge gaps, we analyzed data from the PROMISE consortium, a multi-site academic initiative aimed at evaluating clinical outcomes across genomically defined subgroups of patients 20 . We hypothesized that patients with BRCA1/2 mutations would have more favorable outcomes to DNA damaging therapies (i.e. PARP inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy) compared to those with mutations in genes indirectly involved in HRR (e.g. ATM , CDK12 ). We also sought to explore the clinical outcomes in patients with mutations in less common HRR genes that do directly interact with the BRCA complex (e.g. PALB2 ).

Methods

Retrospective data from the PROMISE consortium database were utilized, which is comprised of well annotated clinical outcomes data for patients with advanced prostate cancer who have undergone prior germline and/or somatic tumor sequencing with a commercially available CLIA-certified assay 20 . Only patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in HRR genes, as documented on the clinical sequencing report, were included in this analysis. Clinical outcomes following treatment with a PARP inhibitor and/or platinum-based chemotherapy were evaluated between genomic subgroups. Patients were stratified into three cohorts, with Cohort A consisting of men with BRCA1/2 mutations, Cohort B those with HRR gene mutations not directly interacting with the BRCA complex (i.e. ATM, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL ), and Cohort C those with mutations in HRR gene mutations directly interacting with the BRCA complex (i.e. RAD51B/C/D, BARD1, GEN1, PALB2, FANCA, BRIP1 ). 21 – 27 For patients with multiple HRR mutations, they were included in Cohort A if they had any mutation in BRCA 1/2 , Cohort C if they had any Cohort C mutation and no mutations in BRCA1/2 , and cohort B if they had neither a Cohort A nor Cohort C mutation.

The primary objective was to evaluate differences in clinical/radiographic progression free survival (crPFS) and overall survival (OS) following initiation of either a PARP inhibitor or platinum-based chemotherapy between Cohorts A and B. Due to the small number of patients in Cohort C, the analysis of this cohort was descriptive in nature. crPFS was defined as the time from initiation of either a PARP inhibitor or platinum chemotherapy to investigator assessed soft tissue or bone progression, clinical progression, or death, censored at the date of last follow-up. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from initiating therapy to the date of death and was censored at the time of last follow-up if there was no date of death recorded. We also evaluated unconfirmed PSA50 response (i.e. ≥50% decline in PSA) rate and PSA progression free survival (PFS). PSA PFS was defined as the time from initiation of treatment until treatment discontinuation due to investigator assessed PSA progression or death, censored at the date of last follow-up.

Median survival estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate associations between OS/crPFS and the following pre-treatment factors were evaluated: HRR cohort, prior platinum/PARP inhibitor therapy, prior ARTA therapy, prior taxane therapy, site of metastatic disease at start of treatment (i.e. visceral metastasis, bone without visceral metastasis, and lymph-node-only metastasis.) and PSA at therapy initiation. Cox proportional hazards models were used to test for multivariable associations between OS/crPFS. The reported p-values are adjusted for multiplicity using a Bonferroni correction and are considered statistically significant if ≤0.05.

Results

Four hundred and sixty patients were identified in the PROMISE database who had an alteration in one of the prespecified HRR genes. There were 191 patients in Cohort A, 217 patients in Cohort B, and 52 patients in Cohort C. The number of patients with each affected HRR gene is provided in Supplemental Table 1 . Overall, baseline characteristics were similar across cohorts ( Table 1 ). The majority of patients in all cohorts had Gleason grade group 4–5 disease and had received prior definitive therapy to the prostate.

Discussion

As hypothesized, we found that PARP inhibitors have limited activity in patients harboring mutations in genes that do not directly associate with BRCA complex activity, which includes ATM and CDK12 – two of the most frequent PARP inhibitor qualifying mutations 15 , 29 . We also found that platinum-based chemotherapy is broadly efficacious across subgroups, with no significant difference in activity regardless of underlying HRR-associated mutation. Finally PARP inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy appear active in patients harboring less common mutations affecting genes that directly interact with the BRCA complex. To our knowledge, this is the largest real-world study directly comparing outcomes to DNA damaging agents across different genomic subgroups. These data support a strategy whereby PARPi are primarily utilized for patients with BRCA1/2 mutations, while patients who harbor mutations in genes that do not interact with the BRCA complex (e.g. ATM , CDK12 ) receive alternative therapies, including platinum-based chemotherapy.

The genomic landscape of metastatic prostate cancer follows a long-tail distribution, with many significantly mutated genes occurring at a frequency of <3% 30 . As such, it is often impractical to conduct precision oncology trials focused on each actionable mutated gene. To overcome this, studies have relied on grouping patients with related mutations in order to achieve sufficient sample size. For example, the primary analysis cohort of the PROfound study evaluated olaparib vs. ARTA switch in patients with either BRCA1/2 or ATM mutations, with a secondary analyses aimed at evaluating olaparib’s activity across a broader set of HRR-related mutations 11 , 13 , 31 . Overall, the benefit of olaparib as compared to ARTA was clearly demonstrated in patients harboring BRCA1/2 mutations; however, there was no clear benefit over ARTA in any other genomic subgroup tested. In spite of this, the FDA label for olaparib includes 14 different qualifying HRR-related gene mutations 32 . To better define which patients are likely to benefit from PARP inhibition, we analyzed clinical outcomes across genomic cohorts, which were assembled based on biologic function of affected genes. We also assessed the comparative effectiveness of PARP inhibitors between genomic cohorts. Our results add to recent reporting on pooled analysis of PARPi efficacy by gene in first line mCRPC randomized clinical trials, which demonstrated a lack of benefit in patients with CHEK2 or ATM alterations. 33

This study also confirms that platinum-based chemotherapy remains broadly active in patients with prostate cancer harboring mutations in a variety of genes involved in DNA repair, with no significant difference in survival outcomes observed between cohorts. Indeed, studies have shown that platinum chemotherapy may be an important treatment option regardless of HRR gene mutational status, including in those with loss of function mutations in tumor suppressor genes. 34 – 36 Interestingly, we also observed a trend toward decreased OS when PARP inhibitors were used after platinum-based chemotherapy. Given that both agents induce DNA damage, it is possible that this is due to cross-resistance between agents. 37 – 39 Notably, prior PARP inhibitor therapy did not impact clinical outcomes to downstream platinum chemotherapy. While this study is underpowered to draw firm conclusions regarding the efficacy of platinum chemotherapy pre- vs. post-PARP inhibitor treatment, our data do seem to indicate that some patients may still respond favorably to platinum chemotherapy following progression on a PARP inhibitor.

We also identified a smaller subgroup of patients with mutations in HRR genes that do interact directly with the BRCA complex (Cohort C) who appear to respond favorably to DNA damaging therapies. The small sample size of this group prevents us from drawing definitive conclusions regarding the activity of PARP inhibitors or platinum-based chemotherapy; however, our results are largely consistent with other studies suggesting these genes may be predictive for response to these agents 18 . Ultimately, further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy of PARP inhibition and platinum-chemotherapy in these patients.

Limitations of this study include the retrospective nature of the analysis and the modest sample size of men receiving DNA damaging therapies within each cohort. In addition, assessment of PFS to PARPi may have been impacted by a higher rate of discontinuation due to toxicity in cohort A (29%) compared to cohort B (11%). It is also important to acknowledge that because most patients in this study received combination platinum-based chemotherapy, the contribution of platinum vs . taxane chemotherapy remains unknown. In spite of these limitations, our data further supports the use of pathogenic BRCA1/2 alterations for the selection of patients to receive DNA damaging therapy. Conversely, patients with non- BRCA1/2 alterations should be prioritized for clinical trial enrollment to prospectively determine the optimal DNA damaging regimen to use within specific genomic subgroups.
