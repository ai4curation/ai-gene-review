MFAP4 (microfibrillar-associated protein 4) is an extracellular glycoprotein 
found in elastic fibers without a clearly defined role in elastic fiber 
assembly. In the present study, we characterized molecular interactions between 
MFAP4 and elastic fiber components. We established that MFAP4 primarily 
assembles into trimeric and hexameric structures of homodimers. Binding analysis 
revealed that MFAP4 specifically binds tropoelastin and fibrillin-1 and -2, as 
well as the elastin cross-linking amino acid desmosine, and that it co-localizes 
with fibrillin-1-positive fibers in vivo. Site-directed mutagenesis disclosed 
residues Phe(241) and Ser(203) in MFAP4 as being crucial for type I collagen, 
elastin, and tropoelastin binding. Furthermore, we found that MFAP4 actively 
promotes tropoelastin self-assembly. In conclusion, our data identify MFAP4 as a 
new ligand of microfibrils and tropoelastin involved in proper elastic fiber 
organization.
