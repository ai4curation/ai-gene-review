Engagement of a T cell to an APC induces the formation of an immunological 
synapse as well as reorientation of the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) 
toward the APC. How signals emanating from the TCR induce MTOC polarization is 
not known. One group of proteins known to play a critical role in asymmetric 
cell division and cell polarization is the partitioning defective (Par) family 
of proteins. In this study we found that Par1b, a member of the Par family of 
proteins, was inducibly phosphorylated following TCR stimulation. This 
phosphorylation resulted in 14-3-3 protein binding and caused the relocalization 
of Par1b from the membrane into the cytoplasm. Because a dominant-negative form 
of Par1b blocked TCR-induced MTOC polarization, our data suggest that Par1b 
functions in the establishment of T cell polarity following engagement to an 
APC.
