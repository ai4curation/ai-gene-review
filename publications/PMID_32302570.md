Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) mediates formation of membraneless 
condensates such as those associated with RNA processing, but the rules that 
dictate their assembly, substructure, and coexistence with other liquid-like 
compartments remain elusive. Here, we address the biophysical mechanism of this 
multiphase organization using quantitative reconstitution of cytoplasmic stress 
granules (SGs) with attached P-bodies in human cells. Protein-interaction 
networks can be viewed as interconnected complexes (nodes) of RNA-binding 
domains (RBDs), whose integrated RNA-binding capacity determines whether LLPS 
occurs upon RNA influx. Surprisingly, both RBD-RNA specificity and disordered 
segments of key proteins are non-essential, but modulate multiphase 
condensation. Instead, stoichiometry-dependent competition between protein 
networks for connecting nodes determines SG and P-body composition and 
miscibility, while competitive binding of unconnected proteins disengages 
networks and prevents LLPS. Inspired by patchy colloid theory, we propose a 
general framework by which competing networks give rise to compositionally 
specific and tunable condensates, while relative linkage between nodes underlies 
multiphase organization.
