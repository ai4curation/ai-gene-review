Many cellular proteins exist as homo-oligomers. The mechanism of the assembly 
process of such proteins is still poorly understood. We have previously observed 
that Hsp16.3, a protein exhibiting chaperone-like activity, undergoes stepwise 
disassembly and nonstepwise reassembly. Here, the disassembly and reassembly of 
a nonchaperone protein RbsD, from Escherichia coli, was studied in vitro. The 
protein was found to mainly exist as decamers with a small portion of apparently 
larger oligomeric forms, both of which are able to refold/reassemble effectively 
in a spontaneous way after being completely unfolded. Disassembly RbsD 
intermediates including pentamers, tetramers, trimers, dimers, and monomers were 
detected by using urea-containing pore gradient polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis, while only pentamers were detected for its reassembly. The 
observation of stepwise disassembly and apparent nonstepwise reassembly for both 
a chaperone protein (Hsp16.3) and a nonchaperone protein (RbsD) strongly 
suggests that such a feature is most likely general for homo-oligomeric 
proteins.
