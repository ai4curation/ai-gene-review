Decorin, an interstitial small proteoglycan, was shown to interact with 
fibronectin via its core protein. In a solid-phase assay, both high-affinity (KD 
values between 10 and 20 nM) and low-affinity (KD values between 110 and 130 nM) 
binding sites were found. The central position of decorin core protein is made 
up of several repeats containing NKISK in positions 85-89 and similar sequences 
in other repeats. The pentapeptide inhibited, albeit not completely, the 
high-affinity interaction between decorin and fibronectin in a specific 
charge-independent manner. Half-maximal inhibition occurred at a peptide 
concentration of 10 microM. Core-protein-derived peptides that had been produced 
by endoproteinase Lys-C digestion were not inhibitory, but endoproteinase 
Arg-C-generated peptides served as inhibitors of binding. These results suggest 
that NKISK as a component of repetitive sequences of decorin is involved in the 
interaction between the proteoglycan and fibronectin.

Abstract

Decorin, an interstitial small proteoglycan, was shown to interact with fibronectin via its core protein. In a solid-phase assay, both high-affinity (KD values between 10 and 20 nM) and low-affinity (KD values between 110 and 130 nM) binding sites were found. The central position of decorin core protein is made up of several repeats containing NKISK in positions 85-89 and similar sequences in other repeats. The pentapeptide inhibited, albeit not completely, the high-affinity interaction between decorin and fibronectin in a specific charge-independent manner. Half-maximal inhibition occurred at a peptide concentration of 10 microM. Core-protein-derived peptides that had been produced by endoproteinase Lys-C digestion were not inhibitory, but endoproteinase Arg-C-generated peptides served as inhibitors of binding. These results suggest that NKISK as a component of repetitive sequences of decorin is involved in the interaction between the proteoglycan and fibronectin.
