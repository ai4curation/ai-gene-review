The Wilms' tumor gene WT1 functions as a tumor suppressor gene, repressing 
transcription of several growth factors and growth factor receptors. The bcl-2 
and c-myc proto-oncogenes are essential for regulation of apoptosis and cell 
proliferation with roles in development and oncogenesis. We found that WT1 can 
repress transcription of both the bcl-2 and c-myc promoters. This suggests that 
WT1 regulates bcl-2 and c-myc during renal development, and the loss of 
functional WT1 results in deregulation of bcl-2 and c-myc, contributing to tumor 
formation.
