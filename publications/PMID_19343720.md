Sirtuins are a family of NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases that regulate 
cellular functions through deacetylation of a wide range of protein targets. 
Overexpression of Sir2, the first gene discovered in this family, is able to 
extend the life span in various organisms. The anti-aging effects of human 
homologues of sirtuins, SIRT1-7, have also been suggested by animal and human 
association studies. However, the precise mechanisms whereby sirtuins exert 
their anti-aging effects remain elusive. In this study, we aim to identify novel 
interacting partners of SIRT1 and SIRT3, two human sirtuins ubiquitously 
expressed in many tissue types. Our results demonstrate that SIRT1 and SIRT3 are 
localized within different intracellular compartments, mainly nuclei and 
mitochondria, respectively. Using affinity purification and MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS/MS 
analysis, their potential interacting partners have been identified from the 
enriched subcellular fractions and specific interactions confirmed by 
co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiment. Further analyses suggest 
that overexpression of SIRT1 or SIRT3 in HEK293 cells could induce 
hypoacetylation and affect the intracellular localizations and protein 
stabilities of their interacting partners. Taken together, the present study has 
identified a number of novel SIRT protein interacting partners, which might be 
critically involved in the anti-aging and metabolic regulatory activities of 
sirtuins.
