Nucleolar shuttle protein B23 was found to bind to human immunodeficiency virus 
protein Tat, and this binding required the nucleolar localization motif of Tat. 
A fusion protein containing the B23 binding domain and beta-galactosidase caused 
mislocalization of Tat to the cytoplasm and inhibited the transactivation 
activity of Tat. These data suggest that B23 is a human factor necessary for the 
nucleolar localization of Tat.
