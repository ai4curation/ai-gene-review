The Arabidopsis COP1 protein functions as a developmental regulator, in part by 
repressing photomorphogenesis in darkness. Using complementation of a cop1 
loss-of-function allele with transgenes expressing fusions of cop1 mutant 
proteins and beta-glucuronidase, it was confirmed that COP1 consists of two 
modules, an amino terminal module conferring a basal function during development 
and a carboxyl terminal module conferring repression of photomorphogenesis. The 
amino-terminal zinc-binding domain of COP1 was indispensable for COP1 function. 
In contrast, the debilitating effects of site-directed mutations in the single 
nuclear localization signal of COP1 were partially compensated by high-level 
transgene expression. The carboxyl-terminal module of COP1, though unable to 
substantially ameliorate a cop1 loss-of-function allele on its own, was 
sufficient for conferring a light-quality-dependent hyperetiolation phenotype in 
the presence of wild-type COP1. Moreover, partial COP1 activity could be 
reconstituted in vivo from two non-covalently linked, complementary polypeptides 
that represent the two functional modules of COP1. Evidence is presented for 
efficient association of the two sub-fragments of the split COP1 protein in 
Arabidopsis and in a yeast two-hybrid assay.

Abstract

The Arabidopsis COP1 protein functions as a developmental regulator, in part by repressing photomorphogenesis in darkness. Using complementation of a cop1 loss-of-function allele with transgenes expressing fusions of cop1 mutant proteins and Î²-glucuronidase, it was confirmed that COP1 consists of two modules, an amino terminal module conferring a basal function during development and a carboxyl terminal module conferring repression of photomorphogenesis. The amino-terminal zinc-binding domain of COP1 was indispensable for COP1 function. In contrast, the debilitating effects of site-directed mutations in the single nuclear localization signal of COP1 were partially compensated by high-level transgene expression. The carboxyl-terminal module of COP1, though unable to substantially ameliorate a cop1 loss-of-function allele on its own, was sufficient for conferring a light-quality-dependent hyperetiolation phenotype in the presence of wild-type COP1. Moreover, partial COP1 activity could be reconstituted in vivo from two non-covalently linked, complementary polypeptides that represent the two functional modules of COP1. Evidence is presented for efficient association of the two sub-fragments of the split COP1 protein in Arabidopsis and in a yeast two-hybrid assay.

DISCUSSION

In this study we have clarified the modular structure-to-function relationships of the Arabidopsis COP1 protein. Using functional reconstitution in transgenic Arabidopsis we discovered four noteworthy features. First, site-directed mutations of the COP1 nuclear localization signal, although compromising COP1 activity, were less detrimental than anticipated based on prior cell biological assays if expressed at high levels from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Second, deletion of the COP1 amino terminus including the Ring-finger domain abolished COP1 function when assayed in a cop1-5 mutant background, confirming that the Ring-finger motif is necessary for COP1 activity ( Stoop-Meyer et al., 1999 ). Third, we demonstrated that COP1 function could be reconstituted in vivo from a split protein, i.e. from two separately expressed coding regions that represent the N- and C-terminal modules of COP1. Fourth and finally, the hyperetiolation phenotype displayed by light-grown seedlings that express a COP1 carboxyl-terminal fragment may be mediated by the wild-type COP1 protein.
