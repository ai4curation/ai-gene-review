The formation of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) is critical for the distal 
outgrowth and patterning of the vertebrate limb. Recent work in the chick has 
demonstrated that interplay between the Wnt and Fgf signaling pathways is 
essential in the limb mesenchyme and ectoderm in the establishment and perhaps 
the maintenance of the AER. In the mouse, whereas a role for Fgfs for AER 
establishment and function has been clearly demonstrated, the role of 
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, although known to be important, is obscure. In this 
study, we demonstrate that Wnt3, which is expressed ubiquitously throughout the 
limb ectoderm, is essential for normal limb development and plays a critical 
role in the establishment of the AER. We also show that the conditional removal 
of beta-catenin in the ventral ectodermal cells is sufficient to elicit the 
mutant limb phenotype. In addition, removing beta-catenin after the induction of 
the ridge results in the disappearance of the AER, demonstrating the requirement 
for continued beta-catenin signaling for the maintenance of this structure. 
Finally, we demonstrate that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling lies upstream of the Bmp 
signaling pathway in establishment of the AER and regulation of the dorsoventral 
polarity of the limb.

Abstract

The formation of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) is critical for the distal outgrowth and patterning of the vertebrate limb. Recent work in the chick has demonstrated that interplay between the Wnt and Fgf signaling pathways is essential in the limb mesenchyme and ectoderm in the establishment and perhaps the maintenance of the AER. In the mouse, whereas a role for Fgfs for AER establishment and function has been clearly demonstrated, the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, although known to be important, is obscure. In this study, we demonstrate that Wnt3 , which is expressed ubiquitously throughout the limb ectoderm, is essential for normal limb development and plays a critical role in the establishment of the AER. We also show that the conditional removal of β-catenin in the ventral ectodermal cells is sufficient to elicit the mutant limb phenotype. In addition, removing β-catenin after the induction of the ridge results in the disappearance of the AER, demonstrating the requirement for continued β-catenin signaling for the maintenance of this structure. Finally, we demonstrate that Wnt/β-catenin signaling lies upstream of the Bmp signaling pathway in establishment of the AER and regulation of the dorsoventral polarity of the limb.

Conditional removal of Wnt3 in the limb ectoderm results in severe limb defects

Mice homozygous for null alleles of Wnt3 fail to gastrulate and thus never develop limbs ( Liu et al. 1999 ; Wnt3 n/n homozygotes: B. Howell and M. Capecchi, unpubl.). To examine the role of Wnt3 in the limb ectoderm, we therefore undertook a conditional mutagenic approach using Cre/lox P recombination to remove the Wnt3 gene in a tissue-specific fashion. Lox P sites flanking exons 3 and 4 (Supplementary Fig. 1D; Materials and Methods) were targeted to the Wnt3 locus to generate a Wnt3 conditional allele ( Wnt3 c ). To elicit tissue-specific removal of Wnt3 in the ectoderm of the forelimb, we used a Cre transgene under control of the RARβ promoter ( RARCre ); this promoter is active in the forelimb ectoderm prior to formation of the AER but is not active in the hindlimb ( Moon and Capecchi 2000 ; Moon et al. 2000 ). In addition, we made use of an Msx2Cre transgene which has been reported to drive Cre activity in the hindlimb ectoderm prior to formation of the AER and in the AER of the forelimb, after its formation ( Sun et al. 2000 ).

We intercrossed mice to generate Wnt3 n/c ; RARCre or Wnt3 n/c ; Msx2Cre mutants (see Materials and Methods). Consistent with the previously reported pattern of Cre activity, we found that Wnt3 n/c ; RARCre mutant mice exhibited defects only in the forelimb. Although completely penetrant, the severity of the forelimb phenotype was variable, ranging from three digits and a normal zeugopod (Fig. 1 F) to forelimbs with a single digit (either digit 2 or 3) and no ulna (Fig. 1 G). Wnt3 n/c ; Msx2Cre mutant mice exhibited normal forelimbs except in two cases (2/44) where digit 5 was missing or was fused to digit 4 (data not shown). The penetrance and expressivity of the hindlimb phenotype was quite variable; some mice were completely normal (2/44; see Fig. 1 H, right hindlimb; Fig. 1 K), whereas limbs were entirely absent in others (3/44; Fig. 1 O, arrowhead). Most often the phenotype was somewhere between these two extremes, with mice exhibiting mild to severe autopod defects (22/44, Fig. 1 I), or more extensive truncations that extended into more proximal segments of the limb (17/44, Fig. 1 I,L–O).

Removal of β-catenin in the limb ectoderm results in severe limb defects

β-catenin is critical for transducing canonical Wnt signals to the nucleus of responding cells, where it participates with Lef/Tcf transcription factors in the activation of downstream target genes ( Behrens et al. 1996 ; Molenaar et al. 1996 ). To address Wnt responsiveness in the ectoderm of the limb, we undertook an approach where we used β-catenin null and conditional alleles ( Haegel et al. 1995 ; Brault et al. 2001 ) as well as the Msx2Cre transgene to specifically remove β-catenin from the limb ventral ectoderm of mouse embryos. The AER arises from ventral ectodermal cells which are later restricted to the dorsoventral midline ( Bell et al. 1998 ; Loomis et al. 1998 ). β-catenin n/c ; Msx2Cre mutant mice were born but never nursed and died within 24 h. The cause of death is unknown but presumably reflects Msx2Cre -mediated removal of β-catenin in tissues outside of the limb. All pups completely lacked hindlimbs; in contrast, forelimbs were present but truncated at the level of the humerus or ulna (Fig. 4 A–H).

Discussion

We have used Wnt3 and β-catenin conditional mutants to address the role of Wnt3/β-catenin signaling in AER-mediated outgrowth of the limb. These studies indicate that Wnt3/β-catenin signaling is essential for the establishment and the maintenance of the AER. In addition, they suggest that although Wnt3 is expressed throughout the ectoderm of the limb, the ventral ectodermal cells of the pre-AER appear to be the only population competent to respond to the Wnt3 signal. Finally, our studies demonstrate that Wnt3/β-catenin signaling is required for the expression of the ventral ectodermally expressed Bmp2 and Bmp4 , which are important in the establishment of correct dorsoventral pattern within of the limb field, an apparent prerequisite for establishing the AER.
