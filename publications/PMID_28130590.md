A major function of the skin is the regulation of body temperature by sweat 
secretions. Sweat glands secrete water and salt, especially NaCl. Excreted water 
evaporates, cooling the skin surface, and Na+ ions are reabsorbed by the 
epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). Mutations in ENaC subunit genes lead to a 
severe multi-system (systemic) form of pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) type I, 
characterized by salt loss from aldosterone target organs, including sweat 
glands in the skin. In this study, we mapped the sites of localization of ENaC 
in the human skin by confocal microscopy using polyclonal antibodies generated 
against human Î±ENaC. Our results reveal that ENaC is expressed strongly in all 
epidermal layers except stratum corneum, and also in the sebaceous glands, 
eccrine glands, arrector pili smooth muscle cells, and intra-dermal adipocytes. 
In smooth muscle cells and adipocytes, ENaC is co-localized with F-actin. No 
expression of ENaC was detected in the dermis. CFTR is strongly expressed in 
sebaceous glands. In epidermal appendages noted, except the eccrine sweat 
glands, ENaC is mainly located in the cytoplasm. In the eccrine glands and 
ducts, ENaC and CFTR are located on the apical side of the membrane. This 
localization of ENaC is compatible with ENaC's role in salt reabsorption. PHA 
patients may develop folliculitis, miliaria rubra, and atopic dermatitis-like 
skin lesions, due to sweat gland duct occlusion and inflammation of eccrine 
glands as a result of salt accumulation.
