Bacteria sense and respond to a wide range of physical and chemical signals. 
Central to sensing and responding to these signals are two-component systems, 
which have a sensor histidine kinase (SK) and a response regulator (RR) as basic 
components. Here we review the different molecular mechanisms by which these 
signals are integrated and modulate the phosphorylation state of SKs. Apart from 
the basic mechanism, which consists of signal recognition by the SK that leads 
to an alteration of its autokinase activity and subsequently a change in the RR 
phosphorylation state, a variety of alternative modes have evolved. The 
biochemical data available on SKs, particularly their molecular interactions 
with signals, nucleotides, and their cognate RRs, are also reviewed.
