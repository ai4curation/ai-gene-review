Familial and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with the abnormal 
neuronal accumulation of α-synuclein (aS) leading to β-sheet-rich aggregates 
called Lewy Bodies (LBs). Moreover, single point mutation in aS gene and gene 
multiplication lead to autosomal dominant forms of PD. A connection between PD 
and the 14-3-3 chaperone-like proteins was recently proposed, based on the fact 
that some of the 14-3-3 isoforms can interact with genetic PD-associated 
proteins such as parkin, LRRK2 and aS and were found as components of LBs in 
human PD. In particular, a direct interaction between 14-3-3η and aS was 
reported when probed by co-immunoprecipitation from cell models, from 
parkinsonian brains and by surface plasmon resonance in vitro. However, the 
mechanisms through which 14-3-3η and aS interact in PD brains remain unclear. 
Herein, we show that while 14-3-3η is unable to bind monomeric aS, it interacts 
with aS oligomers which occur during the early stages of aS aggregation. This 
interaction diverts the aggregation process even when 14-3-3η is present in 
sub-stoichiometric amounts relative to aS. When aS level is overwhelmingly 
higher than that of 14-3-3η, the fibrillation process becomes a sequestration 
mechanism for 14-3-3η, undermining all processes governed by this protein. Using 
a panel of complementary techniques, we single out the stage of aggregation at 
which the aS/14-3-3η interaction occurs, characterize the products of the 
resulting processes, and show how the processes elucidated in vitro are relevant 
in cell models. Our findings constitute a first step in elucidating the 
molecular mechanism of aS/14-3-3η interaction and in understanding the critical 
aggregation step at which 14-3-3η has the potential to rescue aS-induced 
cellular toxicity.
