Differences in expression, protein interactions, and DNA binding of paralogous 
transcription factors ("TF parameters") are thought to be important determinants 
of regulatory and biological specificity. However, both the extent of TF 
divergence and the relative contribution of individual TF parameters remain 
undetermined. We comprehensively identify dimerization partners, spatiotemporal 
expression patterns, and DNA-binding specificities for the C. elegans bHLH 
family of TFs, and model these data into an integrated network. This network 
displays both specificity and promiscuity, as some bHLH proteins, DNA sequences, 
and tissues are highly connected, whereas others are not. By comparing all bHLH 
TFs, we find extensive divergence and that all three parameters contribute 
equally to bHLH divergence. Our approach provides a framework for examining 
divergence for other protein families in C. elegans and in other complex 
multicellular organisms, including humans. Cross-species comparisons of 
integrated networks may provide further insights into molecular features 
underlying protein family evolution. For a video summary of this article, see
