The intracellular pathogenic bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium 
(Salmonella) relies on acidification of the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) 
for survival inside host cells. The transport and fusion of membrane-bound 
compartments in a cell is regulated by small GTPases, including Rac and members 
of the Rab GTPase family, and their effector proteins. However, the role of 
these components in survival of intracellular pathogens is not completely 
understood. Here, we identify Nischarin as a novel dual effector that can 
interact with members of Rac and Rab GTPase (Rab4, Rab14 and Rab9) families at 
different endosomal compartments. Nischarin interacts with GTP-bound Rab14 and 
PI(3)P to direct the maturation of early endosomes to Rab9/CD63-containing late 
endosomes. Nischarin is recruited to the SCV in a Rab14-dependent manner and 
enhances acidification of the SCV. Depletion of Nischarin or the Nischarin 
binding partners--Rac1, Rab14 and Rab9 GTPases--reduced the intracellular growth 
of Salmonella. Thus, interaction of Nischarin with GTPases may regulate 
maturation and subsequent acidification of vacuoles produced after phagocytosis 
of pathogens.
