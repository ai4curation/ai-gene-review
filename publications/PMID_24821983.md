Generation of neurons from patient fibroblasts using a combination of 
developmentally defined transcription factors has great potential in disease 
modelling, as well as ultimately for use in regeneration and repair. However, 
generation of physiologically mature neurons in vitro remains problematic. Here 
we demonstrate the cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation of a key reprogramming 
transcription factor, Ascl1, on multiple serine-proline sites. This multisite 
phosphorylation is a crucial regulator of the ability of Ascl1 to drive neuronal 
differentiation and maturation in vivo in the developing embryo; a phosphomutant 
form of Ascl1 shows substantially enhanced neuronal induction activity in 
Xenopus embryos. Mechanistically, we see that this un(der)phosphorylated Ascl1 
is resistant to inhibition by both cyclin-dependent kinase activity and Notch 
signalling, both of which normally limit its neurogenic potential. Ascl1 is a 
central component of reprogramming transcription factor cocktails to generate 
neurons from human fibroblasts; the use of phosphomutant Ascl1 in place of the 
wild-type protein significantly promotes neuronal maturity after human 
fibroblast reprogramming in vitro. These results demonstrate that 
cell-cycle-dependent post-translational modification of proneural proteins 
directly regulates neuronal differentiation in vivo during development, and that 
this regulatory mechanism can be harnessed to promote maturation of neurons 
obtained by transdifferentiation of human cells in vitro.
