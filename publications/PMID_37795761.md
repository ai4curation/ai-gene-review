Ubiquitin fold modifier 1 is a small ubiquitin-like protein modifier that is 
essential for embryonic development of metazoans. Although UFMylation has been 
connected to endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, the underlying mechanisms and 
the relevant cellular targets are largely unknown. Here, we show that HRD1, a 
ubiquitin ligase of ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), is a novel 
substrate of UFM1 conjugation. HRD1 interacts with UFMylation components UFL1 
and DDRGK1 and is UFMylated at Lys610 residue. In UFL1-depleted cells, the 
stability of HRD1 is increased and its ubiquitination modification is reduced. 
In the event of ER stress, the UFMylation and ubiquitination modification of 
HRD1 is gradually inhibited over time. Alteration of HRD1 Lys610 residue to 
arginine impairs its ability to degrade unfolded or misfolded proteins to 
disturb protein processing in ER. These results suggest that UFMylation of HRD1 
facilitates ERAD function to maintain ER homeostasis.
