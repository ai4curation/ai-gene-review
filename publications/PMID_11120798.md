It has been described that peptides derived from a highly conserved region of 
the alpha1 helix of the first domain of HLA class I Ags exhibit immunomodulatory 
capacity blocking both T and NK cell cytotoxicity. In vivo treatment with these 
peptides prolongs survival of MHC-mismatched allografts. However, the molecular 
bases of these effects are still unclear. In this study, we further analyze the 
mechanisms by which the dimeric peptide HLA-B2702 (77-83/83-77) induces 
suppression of NK cell cytotoxicity. This peptide inhibits natural and 
redirected lysis mediated by NK cells without significantly affecting 
effector-target cell binding. We have also isolated and sequenced a protein that 
binds this inhibitory peptide, which structurally corresponds to beta-tubulin. 
Tubulin is the major protein of microtubules and is involved in target cell 
killing. Furthermore, B2702 peptide promotes GTP-independent tubulin assembly, 
producing aggregates that cannot be depolymerized by cold. Treatment of NK cells 
with Taxol or demecolcine, which interfere with microtubule organization, also 
prevents NK cell cytotoxicity. Taken together, these results support the 
hypothesis that the peptide B2702 (77-83/83-77) exerts its inhibitory effect on 
NK cell cytotoxicity by inducing polymerization of microtubules and interfering 
with their normal assembly/disassembly dynamics.
