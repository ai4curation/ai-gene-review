Mammalian oocytes remain dormant in the diplotene stage of prophase I until the 
resumption of meiosis characterized by germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) 
following the preovulatory gonadotropin stimulation. Based on genome-wide 
analysis of peri-ovulatory DNA microarray to identify paracrine hormone-receptor 
pairs, we found increases in ovarian transcripts for endothelin-1 and endothelin 
receptor type A (EDNRA) in response to the preovulatory luteinizing hormone 
(LH)/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation. Immunohistochemical 
analyses demonstrated localization of EDNRA in granulosa and cumulus cells. In 
cultured preovulatory follicles, treatment with endothelin-1 promoted oocyte 
GVBD. The stimulatory effect of endothelin-1 was blocked by cotreatment with 
antagonists for the type A, but not related type B, receptor. The stimulatory 
effect of hCG on GVBD was partially blocked by the same antagonist. The 
endothelin-1 promotion of GVBD was found to be mediated by the MAPK/ERK pathway 
but not by the inhibitory G protein. Studies using cumulus-oocyte complexes and 
denuded oocytes demonstrated that the endothelin-1 actions are mediated by 
cumulus cells. Furthermore, intrabursal administration with endothelin-1 induced 
oocyte GVBD in preovulatory follicles. Our findings demonstrate a paracrine role 
of endothelin-1 in the induction of the resumption of meiosis and provide 
further understanding on the molecular mechanisms underlying the nuclear 
maturation of oocytes induced by the preovulatory LH surge.
