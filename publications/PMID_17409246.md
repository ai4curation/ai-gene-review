GABA neurons of the cerebral cortex and other telencephalic structures are 
produced in the basal forebrain and migrate to their final destinations during 
the embryonic period. The embryonic basal forebrain is enriched in dopamine and 
its receptors, creating a favorable environment for dopamine to influence GABA 
neuron migration. However, whether dopamine receptor activation can influence 
GABA neuron migration is not known. We show that dopamine D1 receptor activation 
promotes and D2 receptor activation decreases GABA neuron migration from the 
medial and caudal ganglionic eminences to the cerebral cortex in slice 
preparations of embryonic mouse forebrain. Slice preparations from D1 or D2 
receptor knock-out mouse embryos confirm the findings. In addition, D1 receptor 
electroporation into cells of the basal forebrain and pharmacological activation 
of the receptor promote migration of the electroporated cells to the cerebral 
cortex. Analysis of GABA neuron numbers in the cerebral wall of the dopamine 
receptor knock-out mouse embryos further confirmed the effects of dopamine 
receptor activation on GABA neuron migration. Finally, dopamine receptor 
activation mobilizes striatal neuronal cytoskeleton in a manner consistent with 
the effects on neuronal migration. These data show that impairing the 
physiological balance between D1 and D2 receptors can alter GABA neuron 
migration from the basal forebrain to the cerebral cortex. The intimate 
relationship between dopamine and GABA neuron development revealed here may 
offer novel insights into developmental disorders such as schizophrenia, 
attention deficit or autism, and fetal cocaine exposure, all of which are 
associated with dopamine and GABA imbalance.
