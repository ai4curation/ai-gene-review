Alternatively spliced isoforms of certain apoptosis regulators, such as Bcl-x, 
Ced-4, and Ich-1, have been shown to play opposing roles in regulating 
apoptosis. Here, we describe the identification of an endogenous alternatively 
spliced isoform of caspase-9, named caspase-9b, which lacks the central large 
subunit caspase domain. Caspase-9b is detectable in many cell lines by PCR and 
at the mRNA and protein levels. Caspase-9b can interact with the caspase 
recruitment domain of Apaf-1, and like the active site mutant of caspase-9, it 
can inhibit multiple forms of apoptosis, including those triggered by 
oligomerization of death receptors. It can also block activation of caspase-9 
and -3 by Apaf-1 in an in vitro cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation assay. 
These results suggest that caspase-9b functions as an endogenous apoptosis 
inhibitory molecule by interfering with the formation of a functional 
Apaf-1-caspase-9 complex.
