The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a member of the 
ABC transporter superfamily, is a cyclic AMP-regulated chloride channel and a 
regulator of other ion channels and transporters. In epithelial cells CFTR is 
rapidly endocytosed from the apical plasma membrane and efficiently recycles 
back to the plasma membrane. Because ubiquitination targets endocytosed CFTR for 
degradation in the lysosome, deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are likely to 
facilitate CFTR recycling. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to identify 
DUBs that regulate the post-endocytic sorting of CFTR. Using an activity-based 
chemical screen to identify active DUBs in human airway epithelial cells, we 
demonstrated that Ubiquitin Specific Protease-10 (USP10) is located in early 
endosomes and regulates the deubiquitination of CFTR and its trafficking in the 
post-endocytic compartment. small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of USP10 
increased the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR and its degradation in lysosomes, and 
reduced both apical membrane CFTR and CFTR-mediated chloride secretion. 
Moreover, a dominant negative USP10 (USP10-C424A) increased the amount of 
ubiquitinated CFTR and its degradation, whereas overexpression of wt-USP10 
decreased the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR and increased the abundance of CFTR. 
These studies demonstrate a novel function for USP10 in facilitating the 
deubiquitination of CFTR in early endosomes and thereby enhancing the endocytic 
recycling of CFTR.

Abstract

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a member of the ABC transporter superfamily, is a cyclic AMP-regulated chloride channel and a regulator of other ion channels and transporters. In epithelial cells CFTR is rapidly endocytosed from the apical plasma membrane and efficiently recycles back to the plasma membrane. Because ubiquitination targets endocytosed CFTR for degradation in the lysosome, deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are likely to facilitate CFTR recycling. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to identify DUBs that regulate the post-endocytic sorting of CFTR. Using an activity-based chemical screen to identify active DUBs in human airway epithelial cells, we demonstrated that Ubiquitin Specific Protease-10 (USP10) is located in early endosomes and regulates the deubiquitination of CFTR and its trafficking in the post-endocytic compartment. small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of USP10 increased the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR and its degradation in lysosomes, and reduced both apical membrane CFTR and CFTR-mediated chloride secretion. Moreover, a dominant negative USP10 (USP10-C424A) increased the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR and its degradation, whereas overexpression of wt-USP10 decreased the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR and increased the abundance of CFTR. These studies demonstrate a novel function for USP10 in facilitating the deubiquitination of CFTR in early endosomes and thereby enhancing the endocytic recycling of CFTR.

DISCUSSION

The studies in this report demonstrate that ubiquitination regulates the endocytic sorting of CFTR in human airway epithelial cells and identifies a novel function for USP10 in facilitating the deubiquitination of CFTR in early endosomes, an effect that enhances the endocytic recycling of CFTR back to the plasma membrane, and thereby increases the cell surface expression of CFTR. Using an activity-based chemical screen to identify active DUBs in human airway epithelial cells, we demonstrated that USP10 is located in early endosomes and regulates the deubiquitination of CFTR and trafficking in the post-endocytic compartment. siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP10 increased the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR and its degradation in lysosomes, and reduced both apical membrane CFTR and CFTR-mediated chloride secretion. Moreover, a dominant negative USP10 (USP10-C424A) increased the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR and its degradation, while overexpression of wt-USP10 decreased the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR and increased the abundance of CFTR. We offer a model that incorporates the data in the preset study with data in the literature on CFTR trafficking, and the role of ubiquitination in regulating the endocytic trafficking of cell surface receptors ( 1 – 6 , 15 – 18 , 26 ). We propose that CFTR is ubiquitinated by an unidentified E3 ligase and that ubiquitinated CFTR is removed from the plasma membrane by endocytosis ( 19 ). The majority of endocytosed CFTR is deubiquitinated by USP10 in early endosomes, and deubiquitinated CFTR recycles back to the plasma membrane. The CFTR that is not deubiquitinated in early endosomes is sorted to multivesicular bodies, to late endosomes, and ultimately, to lysosomes for degradation. The highly efficient endocytic recycling of CFTR, as a result of the deubiquitination of CFTR by USP10, accounts for the long half-life of CFTR (∼3–24 h in polarized human airway cells) in the plasma membrane ( 15 – 17 , 38 ). Outstanding issues that need to be addressed by additional studies include the identification of the E3 ligase(s) that ubiquitinate CFTR, and the identification of other DUBS in the endocytic pathway that may deubiquitinate CFTR.

Several years ago Sharma et al. ( 19 ) demonstrated that ubiquitination reduced the plasma membrane abundance of CFTR in cells heterologously expressing CFTR ( i.e. baby hamster kidney cells) by redirecting CFTR from recycling endosomes to lysosomes for degradation. Our studies are in agreement with those of Sharma et al. and extend their observations by demonstrating that the ubiquitination of CFTR also redirects CFTR from recycling endosomes to lysosomes for degradation in polarized human airway epithelial cells. In addition, the present studies provide the novel observation that USP10 deubiquitinates CFTR in early endosomes, thereby facilitating the endocytic recycling of CFTR. Although we did not characterize all DUBs identified using the HA-UbVME probe, we did detect other active DUBs in the airway epithelial cells. It is possible that some of these DUBs may also regulate the deubiquitination of CFTR. Identification and characterization of these DUBs, as well as the identification of DUBS from other classes, require further study and the use of different chemical probes that react with other classes of DUBs in this large family (>100) of enzymes ( 4 ).

In kidney cortical collecting duct cells vasopressin up-regulates the expression of USP10, which deubiquitinates and stabilizes sorting nexin3 that, by an unknown mechanism, increases the cell surface expression of ENaC ( 8 ). Interestingly, vasopressin also stimulates CFTR-mediated chloride secretion by dog kidney (Madin-Darby canine kidney) epithelial cells ( 39 , 40 ), raising the possibility that vasopressin-mediated stimulation of CFTR chloride secretion may be mediated by up-regulation of USP10, deubiquitination of CFTR, and enhanced endocytic recycling of CFTR to the cell surface. Additional studies, beyond the scope of this study, are required to examine this hypothesis.

Our biochemical and imaging studies revealed that in airway epithelial cells UPS10 is localized primarily in early endosomes, consistent with our data identifying USP10 in regulating the post-endocytic sorting of CFTR. A recent study identified USP10 in a diffuse intracellular location ( 8 ), consistent with the expression in early endosomes. Although our studies clearly demonstrate that USP10 deubiquitinates CFTR in early endosomes, it is possible that USP10 may deubiquitinate CFTR in other subcellular compartments, as well. Each DUB is typically expressed in several subcellular sites and has multiple substrates/binding partners, thus a single DUB may regulate the function of several different proteins or the same protein in several different subcellular sites, depending on the substrates/binding partners. For example, the observation that USP10 regulates trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi in yeast ( 41 , 42 ) raises the interesting possibility that USP10 may also regulate CFTR trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi in epithelial cells. However, our observation that the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 did not affect CFTR degradation in cells treated with siUSP10 (see Fig. 8 ) suggests that USP10 does not regulate CFTR deubiquitination in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Several other DUBs, in addition to USP10, have been shown to deubiquitinate receptors and channels. Deubiquitination of the epidermal growth factor receptor and the yeast ABC transporter Ste6, by AMSH and Ubp1, respectively, increase their cell surface expression ( 12 , 43 , 44 ). UCH-L3 and USP2–45 deubiquitinate ENaC in a cortical collecting duct cell line and enhance ENaC cell surface expression ( 9 , 10 ). Thus, it is becoming increasingly clear that DUB-mediated deubiquitination of ion channels is an important mechanism regulating channel cell surface expression.

In conclusion, our data provide direct evidence that, in polarized human airway epithelial cells, deubiquitination of CFTR by USP10 regulates CFTR-dependent chloride secretion by facilitating the endocytic recycling of CFTR from early endosomes to the apical plasma membrane.
