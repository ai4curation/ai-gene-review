Multipotent long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) can 
self-renew or differentiate into the less primitive short-term repopulating stem 
cells (ST-HSCs), which themselves produce progenitors that ensure the daily 
supply of all essential blood components. The Polycomb group (PcG) protein BMI1 
is essential for the activity of both HSCs and progenitor cells. Although BMI1 
operates by suppressing the Ink4a/Arf locus in progenitors and ST-HSCs, the 
mechanisms through which this gene regulates the activity of LT-HSCs remain 
poorly understood. Toward this goal, we isolated BMI1-containing protein 
complexes and identified UBAP2L as a novel BMI1-interacting protein. We also 
showed that UBAP2L is preferentially expressed in mouse and human HSC-enriched 
populations when compared with more mature cell types, and that this gene is 
essential for the activity of LT-HSCs. In contrast to what is observed for Bmi1 
knockdown, we found that UBAP2L depletion does not affect the Ink4a/Arf locus. 
Given that we demonstrated that BMI1 overexpression is able to rescue the 
deleterious effects of Ubap2l downregulation on LT-HSC activity and that UBAP2L 
is part of a PcG subcomplex comprising BMI1, we propose a model in which at 
least 2 different BMI1-containing PcG complexes regulate HSC activity, which are 
distinguishable by the presence of UBAP2L.
