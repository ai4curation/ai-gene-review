Elongation of telomeres by telomerase replenishes the loss of terminal telomeric 
DNA repeats during each cell cycle. In budding yeast, Cdc13 plays an essential 
role in telomere length homeostasis, partly through its interactions with both 
the telomerase complex and the competing Stn1-Ten1 complex. Previous studies in 
yeast have shown that telomere elongation by telomerase is cell cycle dependent, 
but the mechanism underlying this dependence is unclear. In S. cerevisiae, a 
single cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 (Cdc28) coordinates the serial events 
required for the cell division cycle, but no Cdk1 substrate has been identified 
among telomerase and telomere-associated factors. Here we show that 
Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc13 is essential for efficient recruitment 
of the yeast telomerase complex to telomeres by favoring the interaction of 
Cdc13 with Est1 rather than the competing Stn1-Ten1 complex. These results 
provide a direct mechanistic link between coordination of telomere elongation 
and cell-cycle progression in vivo.

Introduction

In most eukaryotes, the ends of linear chromosomes are capped by telomeres. Telomeres are essential for both the stability of linear chromosomes and the complete replication of genomic information ( Blackburn, 2000 ). Telomeres are maintained by telomerase, whose activity is highly regulated. In yeast, more than 150 genes affect telomere length maintenance ( Askree et al., 2004 ; Gatbonton et al., 2006 ). In humans, haploinsufficiency for telomerase RNA in dyskeratosis congenita patients leads to progressive bone marrow failure and premature aging ( Chen and Greider, 2004 ). Hence even a reduction in gene dosage has severe clinical consequences, highlighting the importance of telomerase regulation.

In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae , the telomeric DNA consists of 250-350 base pairs of double stranded C 1-3 A/ TG 1-3 repeats with a short single-stranded TG 1-3 3’ overhang ( Wellinger et al., 1993 ; Zakian, 1996 ). Sequence specific telomeric DNA binding proteins and their associated factors form a dynamic structure at telomeres ( Laroche et al., 2000 ; Smith et al., 2003 ). This dynamic nucleoprotein structure is essential for telomere silencing, telomere end protection and telomere length regulation. In S. cerevisiae , two major telomeric DNA binding proteins are Rap1 and Cdc13. While Rap1 binds duplex C 1-3 A/ TG 1-3 DNA repeats ( Conrad et al., 1990 ; Wright et al., 1992 ; Wright and Zakian, 1995 ), Cdc13 binds the single-stranded TG 1-3 3’ overhang ( Bourns et al., 1998 ). Cdc13 has been implicated as the major regulator of telomere access by the telomerase complex ( Evans and Lundblad, 1999 ; Hughes et al., 2000 ; Lendvay et al., 1996 ; Lin and Zakian, 1996 ; Nugent et al., 1996 ). Cdc13 can interact with two distinct complexes that either positively or negatively regulate telomere elongation ( Chandra et al., 2001 ). Association of Cdc13 with Est1 is essential for recruitment of the telomerase holoenzyme, which contains the protein catalytic subunit Est2 and the integral RNA template TLC1, as well as Est1 and Est3 ( Lendvay et al., 1996 ). Cdc13 also interacts with the Stn1-Ten1 protein complex, which negatively regulates telomere elongation and plays an essential role in telomere end protection ( Grandin et al., 2001 ). Hence, Cdc13 tightly regulates telomere elongation through its interactions with both the Est1-Est2-Est3-TLC1 complex and the competing Stn1-Ten1 complex ( Chandra et al., 2001 ). However, the mechanism by which Cdc13 coordinates the binding of these two complexes during telomere elongation had not previously been analyzed.

Telomere length homeostasis is maintained through a dynamic process. Telomerase extends the telomeric TG 1-3 single-stranded DNA overhang by copying the intrinsic telomerase RNA template, while lagging strand synthesis by DNA polymerase α and δ is inferred to fill the terminal 5’ gap during each cell cycle ( Diede and Gottschling, 1999 ). Previous studies have shown that telomere elongation by telomerase is restricted to late S to G2 phase in vivo ( Diede and Gottschling, 1999 ; Marcand et al., 2000 ). The timing of telomere elongation in late S and G2 phase correlates with the binding of protein factors involved in telomere elongation, including Est1, Est2 and Cdc13 ( Schramke et al., 2004 ; Taggart et al., 2002 ). These data have suggested that the assembly of a functional telomerase complex at the telomeres is restricted to late S to G2 phase of the cell cycle.

In budding yeast, the G-rich overhang is very short (about 13 bases) throughout most of the cell cycle, but becomes longer around late S to G2 phase ( Larrivee et al., 2004 ; Wellinger et al., 1993 ). Available data have suggested that Cdk1 activity is required for the generation of this extended 3’ single-strand overhang, although the details of the mechanism were unknown ( Frank et al., 2006 ; Vodenicharov and Wellinger, 2006 ). Increased binding of Cdc13 to such an extended 3’ single-strand overhang could serve to subsequently recruit telomerase through the interaction of Cdc13 with Est1. Of the four telomerase components, Est1, Est2, TLC1 and Est3, only the expression of Est1 is cell cycle regulated, peaking at late S and G2 phase ( Osterhage et al., 2006 ). Hence, expression of Est1 at late S and G2 phase likely restricts the assembly of functional telomerase complex to late S and G2 phase. How cells coordinate cell cycle progression and the recruitment of telomerase complex to telomere has been an open question.

In budding yeast, the regulation of cell cycle progression depends on a single cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdk1 (Cdc28). Cdk1 regulates cell cycle progression by phosphorylating hundreds of different protein substrates ( Ubersax et al., 2003 ). The association with various, periodically expressed cyclins regulates the substrate specificity of Cdk1. While it is known that telomere elongation is cell cycle dependent, no Cdk1 substrates that regulate telomere elongation have been identified. Here we show that Cdk1 dependent phosphorylation of Cdc13 at threonine 308 plays an important role in the efficient recruitment of the telomerase complex to telomeres in late S to G2 phase of the cell cycle. Both the telomerase complex and the Stn1-Ten1 complex are recruited to telomeres during late S and G2 phase of cell cycle progression. Therefore, since these two complexes counteract each other in terms of telomere length regulation, it is necessary to coordinate their binding to telomeres in order to ensure active telomerase function. Our data show that phosphorylation of Cdc13 by Cdk1 plays such a key regulatory role, by coordinating the subsequent recruitment of these two complexes to telomeres to ensure proper telomere elongation and telomere protection.

Discussion

We have shown that Cdc13 is phosphorylated by Cdk1 in vivo during late S to G2 phase of the cell cycle, a time in the cell cycle that coincides with the previously reported recruitment of the telomerase complex to telomeres ( Schramke et al., 2004 ; Taggart et al., 2002 ). Our data also provide the first evidence that phosphorylation of Cdc13 is important in regulating the recruitment efficiency of the telomerase complex to telomeres by competing with the Stn1-Ten1 complexes during telomere elongation. Uncoupling of this cell cycle-dependent event by inactivation of Cdc13 phosphorylation results in less telomerase recruitment to telomeres during cell cycle progression and compromised telomere elongation.

To put these findings in context, we note that Cdk1 phosphorylation of Cdc13 at T308 will, in turn, need to be coordinated with other levels of Cdc13 regulation. In addition to Cdk1, the Tel1 and Mec1 kinases (homologues of mammalian ATM and ATR) have previously been shown to play important roles in telomere length maintenance. Tel1 and Mec1 control the DNA damage response in budding yeast through phosphorylation of proteins involved in checkpoint control (such as Rad53) and DNA replication (such as RPA) ( Brush et al., 1996 ; Sanchez et al., 1996 ). In budding yeast, in contrast to Mec1, Tel1 plays a minor role in the cellular response to DNA damage, but a major role in telomere length maintenance. Loss of Tel1 results in telomere shortening ( Lustig and Petes, 1986 ). While tel1 mec1 double mutants have a senescence phenotype ( Ritchie et al., 1999 ), they have normal telomerase enzymatic activity ( Chan et al., 2001 ). Consistent with this observation, Tel1 and Mec1 are required for normal levels of association of Est1 and Est2 with telomeres, suggesting a potential role in promoting the recruitment of telomerase complex to telomeres ( Goudsouzian et al., 2006 ). Recent studies also showed that Tel1 kinase activity is crucial for preferential recruitment of telomerase to a shortened telomere ( Chang et al., 2007 ; Hector et al., 2007 ; Hirano and Sugimoto, 2007 ; Sabourin et al., 2007 ). Furthermore, Tel1 and Mec1 can phosphorylate Cdc13 at multiple sites in vitro . Single mutation of two of these in vitro phosphorylation sites (Serine 249 and Serine 255) to alanine resulted in telomere shortening and double mutation of these two potential phosphoylation sites resulted in progressive telomere shortening and senescence in vivo ( Tseng et al., 2006 ). While combination of Cdc13 T308A with S249A and S255A mutations did not result in obvious synergistic telomere shortening ( Figure S11 ), it is still conceivable that phosphorylation of Cdc13 by Cdk1 and by Tel1 and/or Mec1 may act synergistically to determine which telomere is elongated through preferential recruitment of a functional telomerase complex in late S to G2 phase. Further identification of potential Tel1/Mec1 dependent phosphorylation sites in Cdc13 and confirmation of these Tel1/Mec1 phosphorylation events in vivo using phospho-specific antibodies will be important to probe their potential roles in telomerase action on telomeres.

Based on the results reported here and on previous data, we propose the following model: Cell cycle progression into late S phase results in telomere end processing and elongation of the G-strand overhang. Cdk1 phosphorylates Cdc13 at T308. As depicted in Figure 7 , the threonine 308 phosphorylated Cdc13 on the G-strand overhang results in preferential recruitment of the telomerase complex through its interaction with Est1, because the T308 phosphorylation biases the binding of Cdc13 toward Est1. Conversely, lack of T308 phosphorylation results in reduced interaction of Cdc13 and Est1, hence increasing the association of Cdc13 with the Stn1/Ten1 complex. Thus, this Cdk1 dependent phosphorylation of Cdc13 provides a mechanism that coordinates cell cycle progression with the recruitment of telomerase relative to the Stn1-Ten1 complexes to telomeres in late S to G2. Deletion of the Stn1 C terminus results in loss of Cdc13 binding, hence alleviating negative telomere length regulation by the Stn1-Ten1 complex and resulting in over-elongation of telomeres. The results using the stn1-ΔC199 mutant also argue against the cdc13-T308A mutation affecting the processing of single-strand G-rich overhangs. If cdc13-T308A caused an end processing phenotype, we should have seen a telomere length difference between CDC13 and cdc13-T308A yeast strains in the stn1-ΔC199 background. In addition to Cdk1 dependent phosphorylation, we suggest that the preferential recruitment of Tel1 to short telomeres and subsequent phosphorylation of Cdc13 (at serine 249 and serine 255 or other unidentified phosphorylation sites) by Tel1/Mec1 on the short telomere may preferentially synergize with the cdk1 phosphorylation to promote the recruitment of telomererase complex (likely through preferential binding to Est1) to that short telomere in a cell cycle-dependent manner ( Figure 7 ).

Previous data have shown that loss of Stn1 results in significant telomere elongation, while Stn1 overexpression results in telomere shortening ( Chandra et al., 2001 ; Dahlseid et al., 2003 ; Grossi et al., 2004 ). It was therefore proposed that the interaction of the Stn1-Ten1 complex with Cdc13 could compete with the recruitment of telomerase complex by Cdc13, thereby inhibiting telomerase dependent telomere addition ( Chandra et al., 2001 ; Pennock et al., 2001 ). Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the telomere shortening induced by loss of Cdk1 dependent phosphorylation of Cdc13 is fully alleviated in stn1-ΔC199 yeast, in which the interaction of Stn1 and Cdc13 is disrupted. Hence, since Cdc13 can no longer interact with Stn1, phosphorylation of Cdc13 threonine 308 is no longer necessary to promote the competing interaction with Est1. Using ChIP analysis, we also detected recruitment of Stn1 to telomeres during late S to G2 phase of the cell cycle in Cdc13 or cdc13-T308A yeast. Such cell cycle-dependent recruitment of Stn1 to telomeres was recently reported by others ( Puglisi et al., 2008 ). Interestingly, the magnitude of Stn1 telomere binding is independent of telomere length ( Puglisi et al., 2008 ). Our data also suggest that the interaction of both Cdc13-3HA and Cdc13-T308A-3HA with overexpressed 13myc-Est1 is stronger than with 13myc-Stn1, so that even with the Cdc13 threonine 308 to alanine mutation, Est1 can still recruit the telomerase complex in the presence of Stn1-Ten1 competition, albeit less efficiently. This can explain why we only see a moderate telomere shortening in cdc13-T308A yeast, but not an ever shorter telomere (EST) phenotype or senescence.

It will also be of interest to find out whether similar regulatory mechanisms modulate telomerase action in human cells. Such regulatory mechanisms may provide new targets for potential cancer therapy and for anti-aging research.
