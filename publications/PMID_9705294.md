The Zn2+ ligands glutamate 99 and glutamate 172 in the active site of human 
glyoxalase I were replaced, each in turn, by glutamines by site-directed 
mutagenesis to elucidate their potential significance for the catalytic 
properties of the enzyme. To compensate for the loss of the charged amino acid 
residue, another of the metal ligands, glutamine 33, was simultaneously mutated 
into glutamate. The double mutants and the single mutants Q33E, E99Q, and E172Q 
were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified on an S-hexylglutathione matrix, 
and characterized. Metal analysis demonstrated that mutant Q33E/E172Q contained 
1.0 mol of zinc/mol of enzyme subunit, whereas mutant Q33E/E99Q contained only 
0.3 mol of zinc/mol of subunit. No catalytic activity could be detected with the 
double mutant Q33E/E172Q (<10(-8) of the wild-type activity). The second double 
mutant Q33E/E99Q had 1.5% of the specific activity of the wild-type enzyme, 
whereas the values for mutants Q33E and E99Q were 1.3 and 0. 1%, respectively; 
the E172Q mutant had less than 10(-5) times the specific activity of the 
wild-type. The crystal structure of the catalytically inactive double mutant 
Q33E/E172Q demonstrated that Zn2+ was bound without any gross changes or 
perturbations. The results suggest that the metal ligand glutamate 172 is 
directly involved in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, presumably serving 
as the base that abstracts a proton from the hemithioacetal substrate.
