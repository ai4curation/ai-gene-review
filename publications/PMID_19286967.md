Phytochromes are dimeric chromoproteins that regulate plant responses to red (R) 
and far-red (FR) light. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes five phytochrome 
apoproteins: type I phyA mediates responses to FR, and type II phyB-phyE mediate 
shade avoidance and classical R/FR-reversible responses. In this study, we 
describe the complete in vivo complement of homodimeric and heterodimeric type 
II phytochromes. Unexpectedly, phyC and phyE do not homodimerize and are present 
in seedlings only as heterodimers with phyB and phyD. Roles in light regulation 
of hypocotyl length, leaf area, and flowering time are demonstrated for 
heterodimeric phytochromes containing phyC or phyE. Heterodimers of phyC and 
chromophoreless phyB are inactive, indicating that phyC subunits require 
spectrally intact dimer partners to be active themselves. Consistent with the 
obligate heterodimerization of phyC and phyE, phyC is made unstable by removal 
of its phyB binding partner, and overexpression of phyE results in accumulation 
of phyE monomers. Following a pulse of red light, phyA, phyB, phyC, and phyD 
interact in vivo with the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 basic helix-loop-helix 
transcription factor, and this interaction is FR reversible. Therefore, most or 
all of the type I and type II phytochromes, including heterodimeric forms, 
appear to function through PIF-mediated pathways. These findings link an 
unanticipated diversity of plant R/FR photoreceptor structures to established 
phytochrome signaling mechanisms.

Abstract

Phytochromes are dimeric chromoproteins that regulate plant responses to red (R) and far-red (FR) light. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes five phytochrome apoproteins: type I phyA mediates responses to FR, and type II phyB–phyE mediate shade avoidance and classical R/FR-reversible responses. In this study, we describe the complete in vivo complement of homodimeric and heterodimeric type II phytochromes. Unexpectedly, phyC and phyE do not homodimerize and are present in seedlings only as heterodimers with phyB and phyD. Roles in light regulation of hypocotyl length, leaf area, and flowering time are demonstrated for heterodimeric phytochromes containing phyC or phyE. Heterodimers of phyC and chromophoreless phyB are inactive, indicating that phyC subunits require spectrally intact dimer partners to be active themselves. Consistent with the obligate heterodimerization of phyC and phyE, phyC is made unstable by removal of its phyB binding partner, and overexpression of phyE results in accumulation of phyE monomers. Following a pulse of red light, phyA, phyB, phyC, and phyD interact in vivo with the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, and this interaction is FR reversible. Therefore, most or all of the type I and type II phytochromes, including heterodimeric forms, appear to function through PIF-mediated pathways. These findings link an unanticipated diversity of plant R/FR photoreceptor structures to established phytochrome signaling mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION

Red (R) and far-red (FR) light and the ratio of these colors are key environmental cues in the regulation of plant growth and development, reproduction, circadian rhythms, and competitive responses. Phytochromes (phys) are soluble chromoprotein receptors that exist in two photointerconvertible forms, R-absorbing Pr and FR-absorbing Pfr ( Rockwell et al., 2006 ; Bae and Choi, 2008 ). The presence of R converts inactive Pr molecules to the signaling-active Pfr conformation, and, conversely, FR converts them back to inactive Pr. Phytochromes are found in eukaryotes, including plants, green algae, and fungi, and in prokaryotes, including both photosynthetic cyanobacteria and eubacteria ( Sharrock, 2008 ). In eukaryotes, the phy Pr and Pfr forms are predominantly cytosolic and nuclear in location, respectively ( Nagatani, 2004 ; Kevei et al., 2007 ). Moreover, in higher plants, a large number of downstream signaling partner proteins have been shown to bind differentially to these two photoreversible conformers ( Castillon et al., 2007 ; Quail, 2007 ; Bae and Choi, 2008 ).

Plants contain multiple forms of phytochrome, and, in angiosperms, these fall into two functional groups, type I and type II. In Arabidopsis thaliana , there are five PHY genes ( PHYA – PHYE ), and analysis of laboratory mutants, natural sequence variants, and transgenic lines with altered PHY gene expression has revealed many of their in vivo functions. Type I phyA is the primary photoreceptor for very low fluence responses to a broad spectrum of light and for high irradiance responses to continuous FR. Type II phyB–phyE principally regulate R/FR photoreversible low fluence responses and shade-avoidance/neighbor-sensing responses to the ratio of R to FR ( Mathews, 2006 ; Rockwell et al., 2006 ). Plant phys have a conserved domain structure: PLD-GAF-PHY-PAS-PAS-HKRD ( Figure 1A ), where domain designations are PAS (Per/Arnt/Sim), PLD (PAS-like), GAF (cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenyl cyclase/ Fhl1 ), PHY (phytochrome-specific), and HKRD (histidine kinase-related domain). Crystal structures for the chromophore binding/photosensory N-terminal PLD-GAF and PLD-GAF-PHY regions of several prokaryotic phytochromes have been determined ( Wagner et al., 2005 , 2007 ; Yang et al., 2007 , 2008 ; Essen et al., 2008 ). However, the structure of the plant-specific C-terminal PAS-PAS-HKRD region remains to be solved. Evidence has been presented for R-mediated uncovering of a nuclear localization signal located within the phyB PAS-PAS region ( Chen et al., 2005 ). In addition, various types of experiments, including analysis of the behavior of phy fragments expressed in vivo, yeast and bacterial interaction assays, and results of site-directed mutagenesis indicate that phyA and phyB dimerize via sequences in their C-terminal regions ( Edgerton and Jones, 1992 ; Cherry et al., 1993 ; Wagner et al., 1996 ; Kim et al., 2006 ).

Homodimers of phyA and phyB have been observed in wild-type and phy overexpresser lines ( Jones and Quail, 1986 ; Wagner et al., 1996 ), and the native complement of phytochromes in plants has often been assumed to consist of only homodimeric forms. However, in Arabidopsis , heterodimers of type II phys have been observed in vivo ( Sharrock and Clack, 2004 ). Formation of such heteromeric photoreceptors increases the potential complexity of R/FR light sensing and signaling mechanisms in plants. Analysis of phyB mutants has shown that this phy has a very prominent role in R/FR ratio-sensing and R/FR-reversible responses ( Somers et al., 1991 ; Reed et al., 1993 ; Weller et al., 1995 ; Takano et al., 2005 ). By contrast, phyC , phyD , and phyE mutants in Arabidopsis and phyC mutants in rice ( Oryza sativa ) are only mildly deficient in R/FR sensitivity compared with the wild type ( Aukerman et al., 1997 ; Devlin et al., 1998 ; Franklin et al., 2003a ; Monte et al., 2003 ; Takano et al., 2005 ), indicating that these phy forms mediate more subtle shade/neighbor-induced or R/FR-reversible responses, fine-tuning light development in concert with phyB. This can readily be reconciled with the origin of phyD as the product of a recent duplication of the PHYB gene in Brassicaceae ( Mathews and McBreen, 2008 ). However, the PHYC and PHYE genes are ancient and widely distributed in flowering plants ( Mathews and Sharrock, 1997 ; Mathews, 2006 ), particularly PHYC , which arose before the origin of angiosperms, and the in vivo mechanisms of their subtle individual activities and their interactions with phyB are not known.

Phytochromes A and B bind to a large number of signaling proteins in an R/FR light-dependent manner ( Castillon et al., 2007 ; Quail, 2007 ; Bae and Choi, 2008 ). The PIF1/PIL5, PIF3, PIF4, PIF5/PIL6, PIF6/PIL2, and PIF7 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are principally negative regulators of photomorphogenesis, bind preferentially to the Pfr form of one or both of these phytochromes in vitro, and in most cases are degraded in vivo in phy-dependent ways after transfer from the dark to R ( Ni et al., 1998 , 1999 ; Zhu et al., 2000 ; Huq and Quail, 2002 ; Khanna et al., 2004 ; Oh et al., 2004 ; Al-Sady et al., 2006 ; Leivar et al., 2008 ). The Pfr forms of phyA, phyB, and phyD transiently colocalize with PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 (PIF3) in nuclear bodies that form within 2 min of exposure to FR or R light ( Bauer et al., 2004 ). This R-induced association with nuclear bodies and the phosphorylation and degradation of PIF3 in vivo are dependent upon the presence of at least one of either the active phyA binding or the active phyB binding (APB) domains of PIF3 ( Al-Sady et al., 2006 ). PIF1 has been shown to interact with both phyA and phyB in vivo ( Shen et al., 2008 ). However, conformation-dependent interactions between phys and most of the PIFs, including PIF3, have not been confirmed by pull-down assays from plant extracts. Moreover, phyC, phyD, and phyE do not bind to the APB domain of PIF3 protein in vitro as Pr or Pfr, suggesting that these phytochromes may signal through other pathways ( Khanna et al., 2004 ).

In this study, we have characterized the dimerization specificities of the Arabidopsis phytochromes in yeast two-hybrid analyses and by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) from seedling extracts. We find that two phytochrome forms, phyC and phyE, do not homodimerize and, instead, heterodimerize with phyB and phyD. Since the PHYC gene evolved very early and representatives of this gene lineage are found in most angiosperms ( Mathews and Sharrock, 1997 ; Mathews, 2006 ), heterodimerization is likely a fundamental property of phytochromes throughout plants. In addition, we show that phyA, phyB, phyC, and phyD coimmunoprecipitate from seedling extracts with the PIF3 transcription factor in a R/FR-reversible manner. Hence, most or all phytochromes, including heterodimeric forms, appear to function through PIF-mediated pathways.

DISCUSSION

Since the initial description of multiple forms of phytochrome in plants ( Sharrock and Quail, 1989 ), there has been a prevailing assumption that, as was originally shown for purified native phyA ( Jones and Quail, 1986 ), all phytochromes in cells exist as homodimers. This assumption was challenged by the identification of phy heterodimers in Arabidopsis seedling extracts ( Sharrock and Clack, 2004 ). Here, by testing the binding specificities of all of the Arabidopsis phytochromes using yeast two-hybrid and co-IP analyses, we conclude that in fact heterodimerization of plant phys is common. More remarkably, there is no evidence for homodimerization of phyC or phyE, indicating that these two forms are present in cells only as heterodimers with phyB or phyD. These observations lead to a revision of the model for the higher-plant R/FR-sensing photoreceptor array and have important implications for the interpretation of phenotypes of the phy mutants and phy overexpresser lines that have been central to defining plant photoreceptor functions and interactions. Figure 4C shows a summary of the phytochrome contents of wild-type Arabidopsis and a number of phy mutants and mutant combinations. With regard to other species, it will be interesting to determine whether phyB and phyC, which are present in most dicots and monocots, always form a heterodimer and whether any gymnosperm phys also show this property.

It is likely, though not yet directly shown, that all of the higher-plant phys attach the same phytochromobilin chromophore and that differences in the photosensing and regulatory activities of the phyA-E receptor types reflect differences in their respective apoprotein sequences. The PHY gene family has changed and expanded over the course of angiosperm evolution ( Mathews, 2006 ). The progenitor PHYA , PHYB , and PHYC genes diverged early, as most angiosperms contain these three homologs, and their products are similarly divergent in amino acid sequence (∼50% identity). The PHYE gene arose later, by duplication of PHYB , but probably early in the dicot lineage. Our findings suggest that PHYC and PHYE evolved to encode proteins that function in physical association with PHYB and PHYB -like gene products, increasing the diversity of R/FR receptor types in a combinatorial way. The PHYD gene arose via a much later duplication of PHYB in Brassicaceae ( Mathews and McBreen, 2008 ). Like phyB, phyD can heterodimerize with phyC and phyE. From these considerations, we propose that phyB and phyD constitute the core type II phytochrome subunits through which type II phy function is mediated. Moreover, since formation of the phyB C357S /phyC heterodimer does not significantly alter the sensitivity of the phyB mutant to R, it is likely that phyC subunits require active phyB core partners to be active themselves.

Yeast two-hybrid analyses indicate that the Arabidopsis phytochrome homomeric and heteromeric subunit interactions are mediated by sequences in the C-terminal halves of the apoproteins. This is consistent with previous observations that deletion of the C-terminal 200 amino acids of oat ( Avena sativa ) phyA or the C-terminal 470 amino acids of Arabidopsis phyB generates monomeric photoactive N-terminal phy fragments in vivo ( Cherry et al., 1993 ; Wagner et al., 1996 ). Cyanobacterial, eubacterial, and fungal phytochromes have C-terminal domains that function as light-regulated two-component histidine kinases, whereas plant phys have unique C termini that contain two PAS domains and a region homologous to two-component histidine kinases but lacking residues critical to HK activity ( Sharrock, 2008 ). The phyB C terminus is required for light-induced nuclear localization and nuclear body formation ( Chen et al., 2005 ). Our findings demonstrate that this region of plant phys is also critical for intrasubunit contacts that determine dimer structure and heterogeneity. Moreover, in phyB ( PHYB C357S ) lines, phyC subunits are stabilized by and presumably bound to chromophoreless phyB subunits but lack light-sensing activity. This suggests that dimerization and intrasubunit interactions are integral to phy signaling mechanisms.

The light-dependent phenotype of phyB null mutants is much stronger than that of monogenic phyC , phyD , or phyE null mutants. The phyB phenotype includes deficiencies in R/FR-regulated hypocotyl elongation, hook opening, cotyledon and leaf expansion, flowering time, gene expression, and circadian timing ( Somers et al., 1991 ; Reed et al., 1993 ). The monogenic phyC , phyD , and phyE mutants show similar but milder alterations in subsets of those light responses ( Aukerman et al., 1997 ; Devlin et al., 1998 ; Franklin et al., 2003a ; Monte et al., 2003 ). We have shown that the majority of phyB is present in seedlings as phyB/B homodimers, but 2 to 7% is present as each of the phyB/C, phyB/D, and phyB/E heterodimers. Considering the levels of the various phy proteins present in seedlings ( Sharrock and Clack, 2002 ), these proportions are consistent with approximately equivalent probabilities of a phyB subunit dimerizing with any of its four partners. Although phyB/B homodimers appear to have stronger overall activity than any of the individual heterodimers, it may be difficult to predict the selective value of individual photoreceptor function. For example, when analyzed under laboratory conditions, phyB mutants flower early under most photoperiods, but phyC mutants do not, suggesting that phyB/C heterodimers play only a minor role in this response ( Franklin et al., 2003a ; Monte et al., 2003 ). However, polymorphism at the PHYC gene accounts for significant variation in flowering time, and growth responses among Arabidopsis ecotypes and different naturally occurring PHYC alleles, presumably functioning through phyB/C heterodimers, are subject to diversifying selection ( Balasubramanian et al., 2006 ).

The instability of phyC in phyB null-containing mutants, accompanied by a concurrent increase in the low-abundance phyC/D heterodimer, and formation of phyE monomers when that protein is overexpressed lend support to a model for phytochrome structural diversity that has obligate heterodimerization as a major component. Nevertheless, there are some inconsistencies between the proposed phy contents of some of the Arabidopsis mutant lines in Figure 4C and the light response phenotypes of those lines. For example, pairs of multiple mutants that should completely lack type II phy dimers but differ in the presence or absence of a phyE mutation ( phyBD versus phyBDE and phyABD versus phyABDE ) show small differences in light response ( Figure 9 ; Franklin et al., 2003b ; Halliday et al., 2003 ; Halliday and Whitelam, 2003 ). In addition, the Arabidopsis phyABDE quadruple mutant retains a slight sensitivity to R for cotyledon expansion and induction of ATHB-2 gene transcription ( Franklin et al., 2003b ). These observations indicate that phyC and phyE have some signaling activity in the absence of their known dimerization partners. It is not known whether this weak partner-independent function results from the activity of phyC and phyE monomers or from pools of phyC and phyE homodimers that we have been unable to detect.

There is a great deal of evidence for direct light-regulated interaction of phyA and phyB with downstream signaling proteins ( Castillon et al., 2007 ; Quail, 2007 ; Bae and Choi, 2008 ). One major group of these proteins consists of the members of the PIF/PIL bHLH family. The archetypal phytochrome binding bHLH protein, PIF3, was shown to bind differentially in vitro to phyA and phyB in their Pfr conformations ( Ni et al., 1999 ; Zhu et al., 2000 ). PIF3 is rapidly phosphorylated and degraded in vivo after a pulse of R, and the pif3 mutant is hypersensitive to R at the seedling stage ( Bauer et al., 2004 ; Monte et al., 2004 ; Park et al., 2004 ). These findings demonstrate that PIF3 primarily functions during deetiolation as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis, although a positive role for PIF3 in rapidly phy-induced regulation of gene expression has also been shown ( Al-Sady et al., 2008 ). The PIF1/PIL5, PIF3, PIF4, PIF5/PIL6, PIF6/PIL2, and PIF7 bHLH proteins all function downstream of phyA and/or phyB, and mutations in the genes encoding these proteins result in defective light-sensing phenotypes. Like PIF3, the PIF1, PIF4, and PIF5 proteins are phosphorylated and degraded in R ( Shen et al., 2007 ; Lorrain et al., 2008 ; Shen et al., 2008 ). In addition, PIF3 and PIF7 colocalize with phyA or phyB in nuclear bodies ( Bauer et al., 2004 ; Al-Sady et al., 2006 ; Leivar et al., 2008 ). However, only one bHLH protein has previously been shown by co-IP to interact with phytochrome in a light-regulated manner in vivo; PIF1 R/FR-reversibly co-IPs phyA and phyB ( Shen et al., 2008 ). We have demonstrated, using co-IP from seedling extracts, that PIF3 binds, either directly or indirectly, to phyA, B, C, and D within the first few minutes after a 15- or 30-s pulse of R and that this binding is partially reversed if the R pulse is followed by a FR pulse. These results provide direct evidence for light-regulated phy-PIF3 interaction in vivo. They also show that PIF3 binds to both homodimeric and heterodimeric phytochromes because phyA is present only as a homodimer and phyC is present only as a heterodimer in the seedling extracts. Khanna et al. (2004) demonstrated that the PIF3 APB domain binds in vitro to phyB but not phyC or phyD. Therefore, it is likely that the phyC and phyD molecules that coprecipitate with PIF3 in Figure 10 are pulled down as a result of PIF3 binding to phyB subunits present in phyB/C and phyB/D heterodimers. Nevertheless, these results suggest that all phytochromes, with the possible exception of phyE-containing forms, signal at early stages of deetiolation through PIF proteins.

Experiments monitoring the localization of phy–green fluorescent protein fusions indicate that the majority of each of the five Arabidopsis phys is present in the cytoplasm of dark-grown seedlings and that a brief pulse of R is not sufficient to cause detectable movement of these cytoplasmic proteins to the nucleus ( Kircher et al., 2002 ; Kevei et al., 2007 ). However, in the same experiments, the phy–green fluorescent protein fusions of type II phyB-E all show some fluorescence in nuclei of etiolated cells, suggesting that a small fraction of these phys is constitutively nuclear. Following transfer from dark to continuous R, phyB-YFP and phyD-YFP colocalize with PIF3–cyan fluorescent protein within minutes ( Bauer et al., 2004 ). The time courses of in vivo PIF3-m6 interaction with phyA, B, C, and D presented here are consistent with those observations, showing that these four phys can be pulled down by PIF3-m6 within a minute after an R pulse and that these interactions peak at ∼3 min after the light pulse. This supports a model in which the Pfr forms of small fractions of the diverse phy dimer forms, either rapidly translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon exposure to light or present in the nucleus prior to light-induced nuclear import of larger amounts of the phys, bind to members of the PIF bHLH family and mediate rapid R/FR responses. These findings contribute to a growing understanding of photoreceptor function and early transduction events in light signaling pathways.
