A hallmark of the pathology of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of the 
microtubule-associated protein tau into fibrillar aggregates. Recent studies 
suggest that they accumulate because cytosolic chaperones fail to clear 
abnormally phosphorylated tau, preserving a pool of toxic tau intermediates 
within the neuron. We describe a mechanism for tau clearance involving a major 
cellular kinase, Akt. During stress, Akt is ubiquitinated and degraded by the 
tau ubiquitin ligase CHIP, and this largely depends on the Hsp90 complex. Akt 
also prevents CHIP-induced tau ubiquitination and its subsequent degradation, 
either by regulating the Hsp90/CHIP complex directly or by competing as a client 
protein with tau for binding. Akt levels tightly regulate the expression of 
CHIP, such that, as Akt levels are suppressed, CHIP levels also decrease, 
suggesting a potential stress response feedback mechanism between ligase and 
kinase activity. We also show that Akt and the microtubule affinity-regulating 
kinase 2 (PAR1/MARK2), a known tau kinase, interact directly. Akt enhances the 
activity of PAR1 to promote tau hyperphosphorylation at S262/S356, a tau species 
that is not recognized by the CHIP/Hsp90 complex. Moreover, Akt1 knockout mice 
have reduced levels of tau phosphorylated at PAR1/MARK2 consensus sites. Hence, 
Akt serves as a major regulator of tau biology by manipulating both tau kinases 
and protein quality control, providing a link to several common pathways that 
have demonstrated dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract

A hallmark of the pathology of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau into fibrillar aggregates.

Discussion

Because hyperphosphorylated tau pathology is present in the brains of AD patients, the role of kinases in the pathogenesis of AD has been studied extensively during the past two decades ( 17 ). Here we propose a role for Akt in AD pathogenesis, distinct from its kinase activity ( Fig. 6 ). Our results suggest that Akt regulates the CHIP/Hsp90 complex; this role appears to have a greater impact on tau accumulation than phosphorylation. CHIP ubiquitinates and degrades Akt, particularly when Hsp90 ATPase activity is inhibited. Akt reduced CHIP-mediated tau ubiquitination and slowed its degradation. We also found a link between Akt and the critical tau kinase PAR1/MARK2, whereby Akt enhances phosphorylation of tau at S262/S356, a site that is not recognized by the CHIP/Hsp90 degradation complex. In particular, we show reduced phosphorylation of tau by PAR1/MARK2 in brain homogenates from Akt1 −/− mice, providing additional evidence for cross-talk between Akt and PAR1/MARK2. Akt also appears to regulate the transcription of CHIP, but this regulation is tied to Akt level rather than activity. All of these findings point to a role for Akt as a mediator of chaperone biology, providing a distinct perspective about the role of kinases in protein degradation ( 5 , 6 ).

We implicate the ubiquitin ligase CHIP as a critical component of this process ( Fig. 1 B ). In fact, CHIP −/− mouse brain homogenates had increased levels of Akt and pGSK3β Ser-9, further suggesting the critical interaction between these two proteins ( Fig. 1 A ). Although we have identified the mechanism of their interaction, we can only speculate on its purpose. For example, CHIP −/− mice have increased apoptotic activity throughout their bodies despite having elevated prosurvival Akt gene expression ( 2 , 8 ). Therefore, Akt and CHIP might cooperate to balance apoptotic signaling. As Akt levels decrease, CHIP expression levels also decrease, promoting apoptosis ( Fig. 3 ); however, as Akt levels increase, CHIP regulates Akt prosurvival activity by facilitating its degradation. Qian et al. ( 1 ) recently demonstrated a similar scenario for Hsp70, whereby CHIP maintained Hsp70 levels based on the cellular context. Thus, CHIP balances proteins that have a major impact on the cellular environment; however, if these protein levels fall below an acceptable limit, CHIP must be down-regulated to prevent further decreases. There also appears to be a threshold for CHIP levels, such that, despite Akt overexpression, CHIP remains constant, perhaps providing additional information about the mechanism of Akt oncogenesis: Akt levels within the cell might exceed the capacity of CHIP. Conversely, Akt siRNA dramatically reduced CHIP but only modestly affected Hsp induction. Because neither HSF1 nor FOXO3A rescued CHIP expression from Akt knockdown, we propose that a distinct pathway directly mediated by Akt is acting on the STUB1 (CHIP) promoter. Moreover, the disparity between LY294002-mediated and Akt siRNA-mediated Hsp induction suggests that a component of PI3K signaling that is distinct from the classical Akt cascade dramatically alters HSF1 activity.

Based on our previous work, which defined phospho-tau as a client of the Hsp90/CHIP complex ( 3 , 4 ), we hypothesized that Akt has regulatory effects on the phospho-tau/CHIP interaction. Indeed, we found that tau degradation by Hsp90 inhibition was enhanced only when the endogenous Akt level, not Akt activity, was reduced ( Fig. 4 A ). CHIP ubiquitination of Akt was also enhanced when Akt levels were reduced ( Fig. 4 B ). Hence, Akt might regulate the Hsp90/CHIP complex by impairing or slowing the degradation of its anti-tau activity, and this regulation might occur by directly modifying the client-bound complex itself, competing with other substrates, or modifying the tau protein. The evidence we presented suggests that competition for CHIP binding plays a role. For example, when we overexpressed Akt, the number of CHIP/tau complexes decreased ( SI Fig. 11 A ), and recombinant Akt abrogated the CHIP–tau interaction ( Fig. 4 C ). This idea of substrate competition would be supported by work showing that CHIP-mediated stress recovery occurred by sequential ubiquitination of substrates and Hsp70 ( 1 ). However, given the role of Akt as a kinase and modulator of Hsp90 itself, along with our findings that Akt directly binds to tau ( SI Fig. 11 ), multiple Akt-mediated mechanisms could be involved in the process of tau degradation. Our findings suggest that Akt be considered in a novel context with regard to AD; rather than strictly serving as a modifier of tau phosphorylation, Akt likely serves a much more important role as a regulator of tau degradation.

Another way in which Akt indirectly modifies tau biology is through the impact that it has on tau phosphorylation by other kinases, particularly given this new function for Akt as a negative regulator of tau degradation. We demonstrated that tau phosphorylated by PAR1/MARK2 at S262/S356 was unrecognizable to CHIP ( 3 , 4 ). Furthermore, Nishimura et al. ( 16 ) showed that PAR1/MARK2 might nucleate tau hyperphosphorylation by priming it for other kinases. Indeed, Akt significantly enhanced the accumulation of phospho-tau in combination with either GSK3β or PAR1/MARK2, suggesting that Akt abrogates tau degradation and provides a higher concentration of exposed substrate for other tau kinases.

Perhaps the most intriguing result was the combined effect of Akt and PAR1/MARK2 on tau, namely, increased phosphorylation of tau at epitopes other than those typically phosphorylated by PAR1/MARK2 ( 16 ). This suggested that Akt either increased tau levels by preventing degradation, allowing PAR1/MARK2 to prime tau for other endogenous kinases, or modified PAR1/MARK2 activity directly. Indeed we found that Akt and PAR1/MARK2 interact directly, suggesting that one might regulate the other's activity. Using Akt1 −/− mice, we also found that pS262/S356 tau was selectively reduced compared with total tau levels ( Fig. 5 D ). This further implied a direct and functional interaction between Akt and PAR1/MARK2 in the brain, one in which Akt regulated PAR1/MARK2 activity. However, this could also indicate the significance of Akt in regulating the CHIP/Hsp90 complex with regard to tau biology. As Akt levels were depleted, not only did PAR1/MARK2 activity decrease, but tau degradation was also enhanced. Indeed, Akt might bridge PAR1/MARK2 with the CHIP/Hsp90 complex to prevent tau degradation on multiple fronts. Moreover, although the impact of this Akt/PAR1/MARK2 complex on the CHIP/Hsp90 complex itself is not known, the implications are far-reaching for AD research given the nature of the signaling cascades in which these kinases are involved and their link with AD pathogenesis.
