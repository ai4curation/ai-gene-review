The breast cancer 2, early onset protein (BRCA2) is central to the repair of DNA 
damage by homologous recombination. BRCA2 recruits the recombinase RAD51 to 
sites of damage, regulates its assembly into nucleoprotein filaments and thereby 
promotes homologous recombination. Localization of BRCA2 to nuclear foci 
requires its association with the partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), 
mutations in which are associated with cancer predisposition, as well as subtype 
N of Fanconi anaemia. We have determined the structure of the PALB2 
carboxy-terminal beta-propeller domain in complex with a BRCA2 peptide. The 
structure shows the molecular determinants of this important protein-protein 
interaction and explains the effects of both cancer-associated truncating 
mutants in PALB2 and missense mutations in the amino-terminal region of BRCA2.

Abstract

The breast cancer 2, early onset protein (BRCA2) is central to the repair of DNA damage by homologous recombination. BRCA2 recruits the recombinase RAD51 to sites of damage, regulates its assembly into nucleoprotein filaments and thereby promotes homologous recombination. Localization of BRCA2 to nuclear foci requires its association with the partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), mutations in which are associated with cancer predisposition, as well as subtype N of Fanconi anaemia. We have determined the structure of the PALB2 carboxy-terminal β-propeller domain in complex with a BRCA2 peptide. The structure shows the molecular determinants of this important protein–protein interaction and explains the effects of both cancer-associated truncating mutants in PALB2 and missense mutations in the amino-terminal region of BRCA2.

Introduction

Repair of DNA double-strand breaks and interstrand crosslinks by homologous recombination in human cells involves the co-ordinated assembly of several multi-protein complexes. Central to these is the scaffold protein BRCA2 (breast cancer 2, early onset), which regulates the assembly of RAD51 recombinase into nucleoprotein filaments ( Sharan et al , 1997 ; Yuan et al , 1999 ). Heterozygous germline defects in BRCA2 predispose a person to breast and ovarian cancers, whereas homozygous defects cause Fanconi anaemia ( Howlett et al , 2002 ; Gudmundsdottir & Ashworth, 2006 ). Cells with BRCA2 defects show genetic instability, consistent with abrogation of homologous recombination, and are typified by chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidy ( Patel et al , 1998 ; Tutt et al , 1999 ; Daniels et al , 2004 ).

BRCA2 function depends to a large extent on partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2; also known as FANC-N, for Fanconi anaemia subtype N), for recruitment to nuclear foci and for much of its recombinational activity ( Xia et al , 2006 ). As with BRCA2, heterozygous germline mutations in PALB2 are associated with cancer predisposition, and homozygous germline mutations result in a form of Fanconi anaemia ( Rahman et al , 2007 ; Reid et al , 2007 ; Xia et al , 2007 ). Recently, PALB2 mutations have also been associated with a susceptibility to pancreatic cancer ( Jones et al , 2009 ). PALB2 is a 130-kDa protein with no clear functional domains other than a predicted amino-terminal coiled-coil structure and a carboxy-terminal WD40-repeat motif. Deletion mapping has localized the PALB2-interacting region of BRCA2 to residues 10–40 at the N-terminus of the protein ( Xia et al , 2006 ).

We have determined the structure of the C-terminal region of PALB2, showing a seven-bladed WD40-type β-propeller, which provides the binding site for the N-terminus of BRCA2. The structure of the core PALB2–BRCA2 complex shows a new interaction with a pocket on the face of the structure opposite to that seen in most WD40–peptide interactions. Together, these structures explain the effects of cancer-associated truncating mutations in PALB2 and of missense mutations in the N-terminal region of BRCA2. The interaction revealed by our structural studies is found to be both necessary and sufficient for the association of PALB2 and BRCA2 in cells.

Methods

Peptides. All peptides were chemically synthesized and purified at Peptide Protein Research Ltd, Fareham, UK.

Cloning, expression and purification. PALB2-C (residues 835–1186) was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified using immobilized metal-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Complete details are provided in the supplementary information online.

Crystallization, phasing and data refinement. PALB2-C was crystallized by vapour diffusion in hanging drops, at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml and a temperature of 20 °C, using a precipitant containing 100 mM 2-[ N -morpholino]ethanesulphonic acid pH 6.0, 50 mM KH 2 PO 4 and PEG 8000 at concentrations between 12 and 20% (wt/vol). Crystals were cryoprotected for data collection by stepwise transfer, to a final concentration of 30% glycerol (vol/vol). A heavy-atom derivative was obtained by soaking native crystals overnight in a stabilizing buffer containing 10 mM KAu(CN) 2 , before freezing. Co-crystals with the BRCA2(21–39) peptide were grown under similar conditions, with an ∼1:4 ratio of protein:peptide.

All diffraction data were collected on station ID14.1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France, and the native PALB2-C structure was phased using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion from the KAu(CN) 2 derivative crystals. The native structure was built from Fourier maps and refined to 1.9 Å. This model was then used to phase the PALB2-C–BRCA2(21–39) co-crystals, and the structure of the complex was refined to 2.1 Å. Complete experimental details are provided in the supplementary information online, and statistics for the crystallography are provided in Table 1 .

Peptide binding and competition assays. Experiments were carried out with biotinylated peptides corresponding to either residues 21–39 of human BRCA2 (biotin–GG–KALDGPISLNWFEELSSEA) or the same sequence containing a single point mutant W31C (biotin–GG–KALDGPISLNCFEELSSEA). The affinity of BRCA2(21–39) for PALB2-C was determined by fluorescence polarization measurements using an N-terminally fluorescein-labelled wild-type BRCA2(21–39) peptide. Complete details are provided in the supplementary information online.

Mammalian expression and M2-agarose immunoprecipitation. Single point mutants of full-length PALB2, in the mammalian expression vector pOZ-FH-C, were generated using a QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. HEK-293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; LGC Standards, Teddington, UK) and maintained in DMEM containing 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected in six-well plates using FUGENE6 (Roche, Burgess Hill, UK), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Whole-cell extracts were prepared in 1 ml of NETN420 buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 420 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% (vol/vol) IGEPAL CA-630) as described in Xia et al (2006 ), 48 h after transfection. FLAG-tagged PALB2 was precipitated from these extracts with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK), for a period of 20 h at 4°C.
