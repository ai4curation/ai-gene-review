The breast cancer 2, early onset protein (BRCA2) is central to the repair of DNA 
damage by homologous recombination. BRCA2 recruits the recombinase RAD51 to 
sites of damage, regulates its assembly into nucleoprotein filaments and thereby 
promotes homologous recombination. Localization of BRCA2 to nuclear foci 
requires its association with the partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), 
mutations in which are associated with cancer predisposition, as well as subtype 
N of Fanconi anaemia. We have determined the structure of the PALB2 
carboxy-terminal beta-propeller domain in complex with a BRCA2 peptide. The 
structure shows the molecular determinants of this important protein-protein 
interaction and explains the effects of both cancer-associated truncating 
mutants in PALB2 and missense mutations in the amino-terminal region of BRCA2.
