The production of amyloid beta protein precursor (APP), which is a potent 
inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases and serine proteinases, in human 
astrocytic tumors (n = 17) and normal brain tissues (n = 3) was investigated. We 
found proteinase inhibitory activity at around 120 kD by trypsin reverse 
zymography in the culture media of explant cultures of anaplastic astrocytomas 
and glioblastomas, but not in those of astrocytomas and normal brain tissues. 
Immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody against human APP demonstrated 
that APP was detectable mainly in tumor and endothelial cells. Semiquantative 
analysis of western blotting revealed that immunoreactivity for APP in the 
culture media of tumor explant cultures appeared to be increased associated with 
the malignancy of astrocytic tumors. These findings suggest that APP production 
may be related to the malignant progression of human astrocytic tumors.
