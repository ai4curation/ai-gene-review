Palladin and alpha-actinin are major components of stress fiber dense bodies, 
cardiomyocyte Z-discs and neuronal synapses. They function as structural 
molecules and cytoskeletal regulators but also as docking sites to other 
proteins. Both antisense and transient overexpression experiments have shown 
that palladin plays an important role in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. 
ArgBP2 is a multi-domain scaffolding protein which shares both the tissue 
distribution and subcellular localization with palladin. ArgBP2 is directly 
linked to intracellular signaling cascades by its interaction with Abl family 
kinases, Pyk2 and the ubiquitin ligase Cbl. It has several actin associated 
binding partners and has been shown to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics. Here, we 
show by in vivo and in vitro methods that palladin's amino-terminal poly-proline 
sequences directly interact with the first carboxy-terminal SH3 domain of 
ArgBP2. We further demonstrate a direct interaction between alpha-actinin and 
the amino-terminal segment of ArgBP2. Immunoprecipitation and targeting assays 
suggest that a three-way complex of the proteins occurs in vivo. The 
interactions provide an explanation to the previously observed Z-disc-specific 
localization of ArgBP2 and indicate interplay between signaling adaptors and 
structural proteins of the Z-disc.
