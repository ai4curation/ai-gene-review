We describe the elt-4 gene from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. elt-4 is 
predicted to encode a very small (72 residues, 8.1 kD) GATA-type zinc finger 
transcription factor. The elt-4 gene is located approximately 5 kb upstream of 
the C. elegans elt-2 gene, which also encodes a GATA-type transcription factor; 
the zinc finger DNA-binding domains are highly conserved (24/25 residues) 
between the two proteins. The elt-2 gene is expressed only in the intestine and 
is essential for normal intestinal development. This article explores whether 
elt-4 also has a role in intestinal development. Reporter fusions to the elt-4 
promoter or reporter insertions into the elt-4 coding regions show that elt-4 is 
indeed expressed in the intestine, beginning at the 1.5-fold stage of 
embryogenesis and continuing into adulthood. elt-4 reporter fusions are also 
expressed in nine cells of the posterior pharynx. Ectopic expression of elt-4 
cDNA within the embryo does not cause detectable ectopic expression of 
biochemical markers of gut differentiation; furthermore, ectopic elt-4 
expression neither inhibits nor enhances the ectopic marker expression caused by 
ectopic elt-2 expression. A deletion allele of elt-4 was isolated but no obvious 
phenotype could be detected, either in the gut or elsewhere; brood sizes, 
hatching efficiencies, and growth rates were indistinguishable from wild type. 
We found no evidence that elt-4 provided backup functions for elt-2. We used 
microarray analysis to search for genes that might be differentially expressed 
between L1 larvae of the elt-4 deletion strain and wild-type worms. Paired 
hybridizations were repeated seven times, allowing us to conclude, with some 
confidence, that no candidate target transcript could be identified as 
significantly up- or downregulated by loss of elt-4 function. In vitro binding 
experiments could not detect specific binding of ELT-4 protein to candidate 
binding sites (double-stranded oligonucleotides containing single or multiple 
WGATAR sequences); ELT-4 protein neither enhanced nor inhibited the strong 
sequence-specific binding of the ELT-2 protein. Whereas ELT-2 protein is a 
strong transcriptional activator in yeast, ELT-4 protein has no such activity 
under similar conditions, nor does it influence the transcriptional activity of 
coexpressed ELT-2 protein. Although an elt-2 homolog was easily identified in 
the genomic sequence of the related nematode C. briggsae, no elt-4 homolog could 
be identified. Analysis of the changes in silent third codon positions within 
the DNA-binding domains indicates that elt-4 arose as a duplication of elt-2, 
some 25-55 MYA. Thus, elt-4 has survived far longer than the average duplicated 
gene in C. elegans, even though no obvious biological function could be 
detected. elt-4 provides an interesting example of a tandemly duplicated gene 
that may originally have been the same size as elt-2 but has gradually been 
whittled down to its present size of little more than a zinc finger. Although 
elt-4 must confer (or must have conferred) some selective advantage to C. 
elegans, we suggest that its ultimate evolutionary fate will be disappearance 
from the C. elegans genome.
