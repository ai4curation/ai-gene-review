The protein product of the c-Cbl proto-oncogene is prominently tyrosine 
phosphorylated in response to insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and not in 3T3-L1 
fibroblasts. After insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, c-Cbl 
specifically associates with endogenous c-Crk and Fyn. These results suggest a 
role for tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Cbl in 3T3-L1 adipocyte activation by 
insulin. A yeast two-hybrid cDNA library prepared from fully differentiated 
3T3-L1 adipocytes was screened with full-length c-Cbl as the target protein in 
an attempt to identify adipose-specific signaling proteins that interact with 
c-Cbl and potentially are involved in its tyrosine phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 
adipocytes. Here we describe the isolation and the characterization of a novel 
protein that we termed CAP for c-Cbl-associated protein. CAP contains a unique 
structure with three adjacent Src homology 3 (SH3) domains in the C terminus and 
a region showing significant sequence similarity with the peptide hormone 
sorbin. Both CAP mRNA and proteins are expressed predominately in 3T3-L1 
adipocytes and not in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. CAP associates with c-Cbl in 3T3-L1 
adipocytes independently of insulin stimulation in vivo and in vitro in an 
SH3-domain-mediated manner. Furthermore, we detected the association of CAP with 
the insulin receptor. Insulin stimulation resulted in the dissociation of CAP 
from the insulin receptor. Taken together, these data suggest that CAP 
represents a novel c-Cbl binding protein in 3T3-L1 adipocytes likely to 
participate in insulin signaling.
