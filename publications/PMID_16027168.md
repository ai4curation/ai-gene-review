The role of tumor suppressor haploinsufficiency in oncogenesis is still poorly 
understood. The PTEN and TSC2 tumor suppressors function to antagonize mTOR 
(mammalian target of rapamycin) activation by Akt; hence, compound heterozygous 
inactivation of Pten and Tsc2 in the mouse may in principle exacerbate the tumor 
phenotypes observed in the single mutants in a reciprocal manner. In contrast, 
we found that while Tsc2 heterozygosity unmasks Pten haploinsufficiency in 
growth and tumor suppression, tumorigenesis in Tsc2+/- mutants is surprisingly 
not accelerated by Pten heterozygosity, even though mTOR activation is 
cooperatively enhanced by compound Pten/Tsc2 heterozygosity. We show that the 
wild-type alleles of both Pten and Tsc2 are retained in prostate tumors from 
both Pten+/- and Pten+/-Tsc2+/- mice, whereas TSC-related tumor lesions are 
invariably associated with Tsc2 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in both Tsc2+/- and 
Pten+/-Tsc2+/- mice. These findings demonstrate that inactivation of TSC2 is 
epistatic to PTEN in the control of tumor initiation and progression and, 
importantly, that both Pten and Tsc2 are haploinsufficient for suppression of 
tumorigenesis initiated by Pten heterozygosity, while neither Pten nor Tsc2 is 
haploinsufficient for repression of carcinogenesis arising from Tsc2 
heterozygosity, providing a rationale for the differential cancer susceptibility 
of the two human conditions associated with PTEN or TSC2 heterozygous mutations.
