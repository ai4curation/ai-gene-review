Clostridium thermocellum produces the most efficient enzyme-complex for the 
degradation of polysaccharides in biomass, the large extracellular cellulosome. 
The draft complete genomic sequence of Clostridium thermocellum was screened for 
open reading frames (ORF) containing cellulosomal dockerin sequences. 
Seventy-one putative cellulosomal genes were detected. One third of these ORFs 
may be involved in cellulose hydrolysis. Most of the others showed homology to 
hemicellulases, pectinases, chitinases, glycosidases or esterases potentially 
involved in the unwrapping of cellulose fibers. To identify the predominant 
catalytic components, cellulosomes were purified and the components were 
separated by an adapted two-dimensional gel electrophoresis technique. The 
apparent major spots were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF. Ten of the components 
were previously known: the structural protein CipA, the endo-glucanases Cel8A, 
Cel5G, Cel9N, the cellobiohydrolases Cbh9A, Cel9K, Cel48S, the xylanases Xyn10C, 
Xyn10Z, and the chitinase Chi18A. In addition, three hitherto unknown major 
components were detected, Cel9R, Xyn10D and Xgh74A. These major components in 
the cellulosomal particles most probably constitute the essential enzymes for 
crystalline cellulose hydrolysis.
