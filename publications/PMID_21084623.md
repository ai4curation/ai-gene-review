Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease and the 
most common form of dementia. AD is pathologically characterized by the 
deposition of pathogenic Aβ peptides that are derived from larger integral 
membrane proteins, termed β-amyloid precursor proteins (APPs). In an attempt to 
understand the function of APP, in vitro studies have focused on the 
identification of interacting proteins. To investigate the APP in vivo 
interactome in an unbiased manner, we generated mice that harbor a mouse prion 
protein promoter-driven cDNA encoding human APP-695 fused to a C-terminal 
affinity tag. Using this tag, we prepared mild detergent lysates from transgenic 
mouse brain cortical membrane preparations and isolated a number of previously 
identified APP-interacting proteins. In addition to these factors, mass 
spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of NEEP21 as a novel interacting 
protein. We now report that NEEP21 profoundly affects the processing of APP and 
Aβ production. Thus, this study demonstrates that using proteomic methods on our 
transgenic model can uncover important in vivo APP-interacting proteins that 
will provide insights into the biology of APP.
