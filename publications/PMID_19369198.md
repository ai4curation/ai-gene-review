The mitotic spindle is constructed from microtubules (MTs) nucleated from 
centrosomes, chromosome proximal regions, and preexisting spindle MTs. Augmin, a 
recently identified protein complex, is a critical factor in spindle MT-based MT 
generation in Drosophila S2 cells. Previously, we identified one subunit of 
human augmin. Here, by using mass spectrometry, we identified the full human 
augmin complex of 8 subunits and show that it interacts with the gamma-tubulin 
ring complex (gamma-TuRC). Unlike augmin-depleted S2 cells, in which the defect 
in spindle-mediated MT generation is mostly compensated by centrosomal MTs, 
augmin knockdown alone in HeLa cells triggers the spindle checkpoint, reduces 
tension on sister kinetochores, and severely impairs metaphase progression. 
Human augmin knockdown also reduces the number of central spindle MTs during 
anaphase and causes late-stage cytokinesis failure. A link between augmin and 
gamma-TuRC is likely critical for these functions, because a gamma-TuRC mutant 
that attenuates interaction with augmin does not restore function in vivo. These 
results demonstrate that MT generation mediated by augmin and gamma-TuRC is 
critical for chromosome segregation and cytokinesis in human cells.
