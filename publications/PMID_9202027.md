The proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (EC) is an important event in 
angiogenesis. The synthesis of the EC growth factor, vascular endothelial cell 
growth factor (VEGF), is stimulated by a variety of activators; but the effects 
of important vasoactive peptides are not well understood, and there are no known 
natural inhibitors of VEGF production. We found that the vasoactive peptides 
endothelin (ET)-1 and ET-3 stimulated the synthesis of VEGF protein 3-4-fold in 
cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells, comparable in magnitude to hypoxia. 
ET-1 and ET-3 acted through the ETA and ETB receptors, respectively, and 
signaling through protein kinase C was important. Atrial natriuretic peptide 
(ANP), C-type natriuretic peptide, and C-ANP-(4-23), a ligand for the 
natriuretic peptide clearance receptor, equipotently inhibited production of 
VEGF by as much as 88% and inhibited ET- or hypoxia-stimulated VEGF 
transcription. EC proliferation and invasion of matrix were stimulated by VEGF 
secreted into the medium by ET-incubated vascular smooth muscle cells. This was 
inhibited by ANP. Our results identify the natriuretic peptides as the first 
peptide inhibitors of VEGF synthesis and indicate a novel mechanism by which 
vasoactive peptides could modulate angiogenesis.
