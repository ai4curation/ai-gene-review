N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is enriched in 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) and near 
stop codon of mature polyadenylated mRNAs in mammalian systems and has 
regulatory roles in eukaryotic mRNA transcriptome switch. Significantly, the 
mechanism for this modification preference remains unknown, however. Herein we 
report a characterization of the full m6A methyltransferase complex in HeLa 
cells identifying METTL3/METTL14/WTAP/VIRMA/HAKAI/ZC3H13 as the key components, 
and we show that VIRMA mediates preferential mRNA methylation in 3'UTR and near 
stop codon. Biochemical studies reveal that VIRMA recruits the catalytic core 
components METTL3/METTL14/WTAP to guide region-selective methylations. Around 
60% of VIRMA mRNA immunoprecipitation targets manifest strong m6A enrichment in 
3'UTR. Depletions of VIRMA and METTL3 induce 3'UTR lengthening of several 
hundred mRNAs with over 50% targets in common. VIRMA associates with 
polyadenylation cleavage factors CPSF5 and CPSF6 in an RNA-dependent manner. 
Depletion of CPSF5 leads to significant shortening of 3'UTR of over 2800 mRNAs, 
84% of which are modified with m6A and have increased m6A peak density in 3'UTR 
and near stop codon after CPSF5 knockdown. Together, our studies provide 
insights into m6A deposition specificity in 3'UTR and its correlation with 
alternative polyadenylation.
