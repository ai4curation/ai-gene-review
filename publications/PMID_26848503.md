Collagen-I is the most abundant protein in the human body, yet our understanding 
of how the endoplasmic reticulum regulates collagen-I proteostasis (folding, 
quality control, and secretion) remains immature. Of particular importance, 
interactomic studies to map the collagen-I proteostasis network have never been 
performed. Such studies would provide insight into mechanisms of collagen-I 
folding and misfolding in cells, an area that is particularly important owing to 
the prominence of the collagen misfolding-related diseases. Here, we overcome 
key roadblocks to progress in this area by generating stable fibrosarcoma cells 
that inducibly express properly folded and modified collagen-I strands tagged 
with distinctive antibody epitopes. Selective immunoprecipitation of collagen-I 
from these cells integrated with quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics 
permits the first mapping of the collagen-I proteostasis network. Biochemical 
validation of the resulting map leads to the assignment of numerous new players 
in collagen-I proteostasis, and the unanticipated discovery of apparent 
aspartyl-hydroxylation as a new post-translational modification in the 
N-propeptide of collagen-I. Furthermore, quantitative analyses reveal that 
Erp29, an abundant endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis machinery component with 
few known functions, plays a key role in collagen-I retention under 
ascorbate-deficient conditions. In summary, the work here provides fresh 
insights into the molecular mechanisms of collagen-I proteostasis, yielding a 
detailed roadmap for future investigations. Straightforward adaptations of the 
cellular platform developed will also enable hypothesis-driven, comparative 
research on the likely distinctive proteostasis mechanisms engaged by normal and 
disease-causing, misfolding collagen-I variants, potentially motivating new 
therapeutic strategies for currently incurable collagenopathies.
