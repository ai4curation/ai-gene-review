In yeast, Tim50 along with Tim23 regulate translocation of 
presequence-containing proteins across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Here, 
we describe the identification and characterization of a novel human 
mitochondrial inner membrane protein homologous to the yeast Tim50. We 
demonstrate that human Tim50 possesses phosphatase activity and is present in a 
complex with human Tim23. Down-regulation of human Tim50 expression by RNA 
interference increases the sensitivity of human cell lines to death stimuli by 
accelerating the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Furthermore, 
injection of Tim50-specific morpholino antisense oligonucleotides during early 
zebrafish embryonic development causes neurodegeneration, dysmorphic hearts, and 
reduced motility as a result of increased cell death. These observations 
indicate that loss of Tim50 in vertebrates causes mitochondrial membrane 
permeabilization and dysfunction followed by cytoplasmic release of cytochrome c 
along with other mitochondrial inducers of cell death. Thus Tim50 is important 
for both mitochondrial function and early neuronal development.
