SlyD is a Ni(II)-binding protein that contributes to nickel homeostasis in 
Escherichia coli. The C-terminal domain of SlyD contains a rich variety of 
metal-binding amino acids, suggesting broader metal binding capabilities, and 
previous work demonstrated that the protein can coordinate several types of 
first-row transition metals. However, the binding of SlyD to metals other than 
Ni(II) has not been previously characterized. To improve our understanding of 
the in vitro metal-binding activity of SlyD and how it correlates with the in 
vivo function of this protein, the interactions between SlyD and the series of 
biologically relevant transition metals [Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Cu(I), and 
Zn(II)] were examined by using a combination of optical spectroscopy and mass 
spectrometry. Binding of SlyD to Mn(II) or Fe(II) ions was not detected, but the 
protein coordinates multiple ions of Co(II), Zn(II), and Cu(I) with appreciable 
affinity (K(D) values in or below the nanomolar range), highlighting the 
promiscuous nature of this protein. The order of affinities of SlyD for the 
metals examined is as follows: Mn(II) and Fe(II) < Co(II) < Ni(II) ~ Zn(II) ≪ 
Cu(I). Although the purified protein is unable to overcome the large 
thermodynamic preference for Cu(I) and exclude Zn(II) chelation in the presence 
of Ni(II), in vivo studies reveal a Ni(II)-specific function for the protein. 
Furthermore, these latter experiments support a specific role for SlyD as a 
[NiFe]-hydrogenase enzyme maturation factor. The implications of the divergence 
between the metal selectivity of SlyD in vitro and the specific activity in vivo 
are discussed.
