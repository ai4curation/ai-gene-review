During epithelial sheet formation, linear actin cables assemble at nascent 
adherens junctions. This process requires alpha-catenin and actin 
polymerization, although the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we 
show that formin-1 interacts with alpha-catenin, localizes to adherens junctions 
and nucleates unbranched actin filaments. Furthermore, disruption of the 
alpha-catenin-formin-1 interaction blocks assembly of radial actin cables and 
perturbs intercellular adhesion. A fusion protein of the beta-catenin-binding 
domain of alpha-catenin with the actin polymerization domains of formin-1 
rescues formation of adherens junctions and associated actin cables in 
alpha-catenin-null keratinocytes. These findings provide new insight into how 
alpha-catenin orchestrates actin dynamics during intercellular junction 
formation.

Abstract

During epithelial sheet formation, linear actin cables assemble at nascent adherens junctions. This process requires α-catenin and actin polymerization, although the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that formin-1 interacts with α-catenin, localizes to adherens junctions and nucleates unbranched actin filaments. Furthermore, disruption of the α-catenin–formin-1 interaction blocks assembly of radial actin cables and perturbs intercellular adhesion. A fusion protein of the β-catenin-binding domain of α-catenin with the actin polymerization domains of formin-1 rescues formation of adherens junctions and associated actin cables in α-catenin -null keratinocytes. These findings provide new insight into how α-catenin orchestrates actin dynamics during intercellular junction formation.

DISCUSSION

Although yeast formins and their closest mouse homologue, mDia1 (30–40% identical), have recently been shown to induce actin polymerization through their FH1 and FH2 domains, comparable studies have not yet been reported for other formins, which now constitutes a large (at least 9) multigene family in mammals.

The fact that formin-1 is stimulatory for actin polymerization is particularly striking, given that it is encoded by formin-1 , a gene that is disrupted in the limb deformity mutant mouse 36 - 38 . It was originally surmised that formin-1 might function in a regulatory Shh–FGF (sonic hedgehog–fibroblast growth factor) feedback loop necessary for apical ectodermal ridge formation and that its function was compromized in the ld/ld mutant mice 12 , 13 . Recently, however, it was discovered that gremlin , a gene adjacent to the formin-1 locus that is downregulated in limb deformity mice, encodes a BMP antagonist essential for the maintenance of Shh and FGF signalling during limb patterning 42 . This raises the possibility that the major ld/ld phenotype may not reflect loss of formin-1 function. Our findings suggest that the primary function of formin-1 may be to regulate actin polymerization, a function that has not been reported previously.

An important question is whether other formins share formin-1 functions, particularly in epithelial sheet formation. Although mDia1 has not been localized to adherens junctions, a role for mDia1 at these sites has been postulated from the ability of a 440-amino-acid truncated form of mDia1 (encompassing much of the conserved FH1 and FH2 domains) to impair cytokinesis and disrupt cell–cell adhesion. In this case, intercellular adhesion was disrupted between single transfected epithelial cells and their wild-type neighbours 30 . Such effects go beyond (and may not involve) radial actin cable assembly, which must be compromised on both sides of a junction to disrupt intercellular contacts 23 . Additionally, and in contrast to formin-1, the FH3-coiled coil domain of mDia1 (ΔC-mDia1) did not bind α-catenin nor perturb radial actin cable formation. A similar construct, mDia-ΔRBD-ΔC, also had no effect on MDCK epithelial adhesion 43 . Thus, if mDia1 is involved in adherens-junction-mediated radial actin cable formation, it is likely to differ in the manner through which it associates with junctional components.

An intriguing and distinctive feature of diaphanous formins is their autoregulation 20 , 44 - 46 . The Rho GTPase-binding domain (RBD) for this formin subfamily maps to a sequence that overlaps with, and is N-terminal to, FH3 (refs 20 , 46 - 48 ). A C-terminal diaphanous auto-inhibitory domain (DAD) maintains the formin in a dormant state until activated Rho GTPase binds and relieves auto-inhibition, and nucleates localized actin assembly 11 , 46 , 49 . Interestingly, the N- and C-terminal segments of formin-1 (IV) interact, and this interaction impairs actin polymerization. Moreover, α-catenin does not disrupt this interaction in vitro , suggesting that other factors may be required to unleash the actin-polymerizing potential of formin-1 (IV). When coupled with the well-established involvement of Rho GTPases and dynamic actin rearrangements in epithelial sheet formation 27 , 50 , the potential link between formin-1 (IV) and these actin regulatory proteins merits further investigation. An attractive model consistent with our findings is that in conjunction with Rho GTPases, α-catenin recruits formin-1 to nucleate profilin-mediated F-actin assembly at puncta. Vasp may then compete with the capping protein to promote extension of these initiated, unbranched, F-actin structures to form linear, radial actin cables and to seal epithelial sheets.
