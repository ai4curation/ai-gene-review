An early stage in thymocyte development, after rearrangement of the beta chain 
genes of the T cell receptor (TCR), involves expression of the pre-TCR complex 
and accompanying differentiation of CD4(-)CD8(-) double negative (DN) cells to 
CD4(+)CD8(+) double positive (DP) cells. The ZAP-70 and Syk tyrosine kinases 
each contain two N-terminal SH2 domains that bind phosphorylated motifs in 
antigen receptor subunits and are implicated in pre-T receptor signaling. 
However, mice deficient in either ZAP-70 or Syk have no defect in the formation 
of DP thymocytes. Here we show that, in mice lacking both Syk and ZAP-70, DN 
thymocytes undergo beta chain gene rearrangement but fail to initiate clonal 
expansion and are incapable of differentiating into DP cells after expression of 
the pre-TCR. These data suggest that the ZAP-70 and Syk tyrosine kinases have 
crucial but overlapping functions in signaling from the pre-TCR and hence in 
early thymocyte development.

Abstract

An early stage in thymocyte development, after rearrangement of the β chain genes of the T cell receptor (TCR), involves expression of the pre-TCR complex and accompanying differentiation of CD4 − CD8 − double negative (DN) cells to CD4 + CD8 + double positive (DP) cells. The ZAP-70 and Syk tyrosine kinases each contain two N-terminal SH2 domains that bind phosphorylated motifs in antigen receptor subunits and are implicated in pre-T receptor signaling. However, mice deficient in either ZAP-70 or Syk have no defect in the formation of DP thymocytes. Here we show that, in mice lacking both Syk and ZAP-70, DN thymocytes undergo β chain gene rearrangement but fail to initiate clonal expansion and are incapable of differentiating into DP cells after expression of the pre-TCR. These data suggest that the ZAP-70 and Syk tyrosine kinases have crucial but overlapping functions in signaling from the pre-TCR and hence in early thymocyte development.

DISCUSSION

We have identified a critical role for Syk and ZAP-70 in early thymocyte development, a function that was not revealed in mutant mice lacking only one of these kinases. These results show an essential role for Syk and ZAP-70 in pre-TCR signaling and suggest that Syk and ZAP-70 have overlapping activities in the differentiation of DN thymocytes to DP cells. Our data, therefore, are consistent with the suggestion that these two kinases can perform very similar biological functions ( 17 – 19 ) although Syk and ZAP-70 clearly have somewhat distinct modes of activation downstream of the CD3 and TCR ζ signaling complex ( 20 ). Because the thymocytes in syk −/− ; zap-70 −/− mice show rearrangement of TCR β genes but fail to undergo down-regulation of CD25 and expansion into a population of cycling cells, our data suggest that Syk and ZAP-70 function interchangeably in signaling downstream of the pre-TCR. According to this scheme, phosphorylation of the CD3 and TCR ζ signaling subunits of the pre-TCR by Src family kinases leads to the recruitment and activation of Syk/ZAP-70, phosphorylation of intracellular targets ( 4 , 21 ), and subsequent proliferation and differentiation of DN thymocytes. Consistent with this view, disruption of the TCR β ( 22 ), the pTα ( 1 ), or the CD3 invariant genes ( 23 – 25 ) impairs the formation of DP thymocytes, while combined mutations in both Lck and Fyn ( 26 , 27 ) induce a complete block in the differentiation of DN to DP thymocytes.

Taken with earlier data, these results suggest that Syk and ZAP-70 act at multiple checkpoints during T and B cell development (Fig. 4 ). ZAP-70 is not significantly expressed in B cells ( 28 ); therefore Syk appears to be uniquely required for signaling from the pre-BCR and thus for the clonal expansion of pre-B cells that have productively rearranged the Ig heavy chain genes ( 8 ). Syk also has separate functions later in B cell development, such as in the maturation of B cells to the IgM + ; IgD + stage ( 8 ) and in antigen-induced B cell activation, likely due to signaling downstream of the mature BCR ( 6 ). During the later stages of αβ T cell development, ZAP-70 alone is required for the differentiation of DP thymocytes to the CD4 and CD8 lineages in the mouse ( 10 ), the differentiation of the CD8 lineage in humans, and the activation of CD4 + peripheral T cells ( 11 , 12 ). This may be due either to a unique biochemical activity of ZAP-70 in signaling from the mature TCR or to the fact that Syk expression is down-regulated during T cell development ( 28 ). In contrast, Syk plays a specific role in regulating extrathymic development of γδ T lineage cells ( 29 ). The data reported here indicate that, in αβ lineage T cells, Syk and ZAP-70 act jointly in the differentiation of DN to DP cells, most probably due to a role in signaling by the pre-TCR. These SH2-containing tyrosine kinases therefore appear to act at an early checkpoint during thymocyte development that monitors productive rearrangement of β chain genes.
