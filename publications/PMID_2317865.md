cDNA clones encoding the human and murine interleukin-7 (IL-7) receptor were 
isolated and expressed in COS-7 cells. Binding of radiolabeled IL-7 to the 
recombinant IL-7 receptors produced curvilinear Scatchard plots containing high 
and low affinity classes. These binding properties, as well as the molecular 
size of the cloned receptor, were comparable to the native forms of the IL-7 
receptor. In addition, several cDNA clones were isolated that encode a secreted 
form of the human IL-7 receptor capable of binding IL-7 in solution. Analysis of 
the sequence of the IL-7 receptor revealed significant homology in the 
extracellular domain to several recently cloned cytokine receptors, 
demonstrating that the IL-7 receptor is a member of a new receptor superfamily.
