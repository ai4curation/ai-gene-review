Trichostatin A (TSA), a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), 
induces acetylation of various non-histone proteins such as p53 and 
alpha-tubulin. We purified several acetylated proteins by the affinity to an 
anti-acetylated lysine (AcLys) antibody from cells treated with TSA and 
identified them by mass spectrometry. Here we report on acetylation of CFIm25, a 
component of mammalian cleavage factor Im (CF Im), and poly(A) polymerase (PAP), 
a polyadenylating enzyme for the pre-mRNA 3'-end. The residues acetylated in 
these proteins were mapped onto the regions required for interaction with each 
other. Whereas CBP acetylated these proteins, HDAC1, HDAC3, HDAC10, SIRT1, and 
SIRT2 were involved in in vivo deacetylation. Acetylation of the CFIm25 occurred 
depending on the cleavage factor complex formation. Importantly, the interaction 
between PAP and CF Im complex was decreased by acetylation. We also demonstrated 
that acetylation of PAP inhibited the nuclear localization of PAP by inhibiting 
the binding to the importin alpha/beta complex. These results suggest that CBP 
and HDACs regulate the 3'-end processing machinery and modulate the localization 
of PAP through the acetylation and deacetylation cycle.
