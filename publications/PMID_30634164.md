BACKGROUND: Interleukin 16 is an immunomodulatory chemokine that signals through 
CD4 + T cells, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. Its expression in 
immune-related cells enhances the antimicrobial effect and inhibits HIV 
replication in macrophages. However, the role of IL-16 in macrophage 
polarization is uncertain. Mir-145 was reported to regulate IL-10 expression by 
targeting histone deacetylase 11 and promotes alternatively activated macrophage 
(M2) polarization. Mir-145 was also predicted to target IL-16 mRNA. We aimed to 
explore the roles of IL-16 and mir-145 in macrophage polarization and 
antimicrobial functions.
METHODS: THP1 monocytes were employed in this study, and their cell activity 
when incubated with different concentrations of IL-16 was evaluated using the 
CCK-8 cell counting kit. To obtain polarized macrophages, THP-1 cells were 
induced by IL-4 and IL-13 following PMA incubation (M2 polarized macrophages) or 
induced by IFN-gamma and LPS (M1 classical macrophage activation). The influence 
of IL-16 on macrophage phagocytosis was quantified by the amount of chicken red 
blood cell phagocytized. IL-16, IL-10 and miR-145 expression in THP1 monocytes 
and induced macrophages was quantified by quantitative PCR. The miR-145 and 
IL-16 targeting relationship was verified by the dual luciferase reporter assay. 
The influence of IL-16 and mir-145 on macrophage polarization was evaluated by 
M1 and M2 macrophage characterized marker gene expression.
RESULTS: The M0 macrophage subtype was induced by PMA. The M1 and M2 subtypes of 
macrophage were successfully induced by M1- and M2-specific induction. M1 
macrophages express higher levels of IL-16 than M2 macrophages but express lower 
levels of IL-10 and mir-145 than M2 cells. IL-16 with a concentration up to 
150 ng/mL has no influence on THP-1 cell proliferation but improves macrophage 
phagocytosis ability with the down-expression of IL-10 and up-expression of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1a and IL-6. Knockdown with its target 
siRNA is beneficial for macrophage maintenance but reduces phagocytosis ability. 
Mir-145 specifically targets the IL-16 3'UTR verified by the dual luciferase 
reporter assay. Mir-145 downregulates IL-16 expression and upregulates IL-10 
expression, thereby promoting M2 macrophage polarization.
CONCLUSION: IL-16 modulates macrophage polarization through regulating IL-10, 
IL-1a and IL-6 expression. Mir-145 is involved in M2 macrophage polarization by 
targeting IL-16 and enhancing IL-10 expression.
