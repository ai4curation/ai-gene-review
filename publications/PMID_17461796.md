Mutations in the proprotein convertase PCSK9 gene are associated with autosomal 
dominant familial hyper- or hypocholesterolemia. These phenotypes are caused by 
a gain or loss of function of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) 
to elicit the degradation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) 
protein. Herein, we asked whether the subcellular localization of wild-type 
PCSK9 or mutants of PCSK9 and the LDLR would provide insight into the mechanism 
of PCSK9-dependent LDLR degradation. We show that the LDLR is the dominant 
partner in regulating the cellular trafficking of PCSK9. In cells lacking the 
LDLR, PCSK9 localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In cells expressing the 
LDLR, PCSK9 sorted to post-ER compartments (i.e. endosomes in cell lines and 
Golgi apparatus in primary hepatocytes), where it colocalized with the LDLR. In 
cell lines, PCSK9 also colocalized with the LDLR at the cell surface, requiring 
the presence of the C-terminal Cys/His-rich domain of PCSK9. We provide evidence 
that PCSK9 promotes the degradation of the LDLR by an endocytic mechanism, as 
small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the clathrin heavy chain reduced the 
functional activity of PCSK9. We also compared the subcellular localization of 
natural mutants of PCSK9 with that of the wild-type enzyme in human hepatic 
(HuH7) cells. Whereas the mutants associated with hypercholesterolemia (S127R, 
F216L and R218S) localized to endosomes/lysosomes, those associated with 
hypocholesterolemia did not reach this compartment. We conclude that the sorting 
of PCSK9 to the cell surface and endosomes is required for PCSK9 to fully 
promote LDLR degradation and that retention in the ER prevents this activity. 
Mutations that affect this transport can lead to hyper- or hypocholesterolemia.
