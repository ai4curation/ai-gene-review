DNA damage activates cell cycle checkpoints in yeast and human cells. In the 
yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe 
checkpoint-deficient mutants have been characterized, and the corresponding 
genes have been cloned. Searches for human homologs of S. pombe rad1, rad9, and 
hus1 genes identified the potential human homologs hRad1, hRad9, and hHus1; 
however, little is known about the roles of these proteins in human cells. The 
present studies demonstrate that hRad1 and hHus1 associate in a complex that 
interacts with a highly modified form of hRad9, but hHus1 and hRad1 do not 
associate with hRad17. In addition to being a key participant in complex 
formation, hRad9 is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage. Together, these 
results suggest that hRad9, hRad1, and hHus1 are central components of a DNA 
damage-responsive protein complex in human cells.
