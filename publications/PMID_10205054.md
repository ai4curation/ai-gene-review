Comment in
    Science. 1999 Apr 16;284(5413):443-4. doi: 10.1126/science.284.5413.443.

The cytokines LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor) and BMP2 (bone morphogenetic 
protein-2) signal through different receptors and transcription factors, namely 
STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) and Smads. LIF and 
BMP2 were found to act in synergy on primary fetal neural progenitor cells to 
induce astrocytes. The transcriptional coactivator p300 interacts physically 
with STAT3 at its amino terminus in a cytokine stimulation-independent manner, 
and with Smad1 at its carboxyl terminus in a cytokine stimulation-dependent 
manner. The formation of a complex between STAT3 and Smad1, bridged by p300, is 
involved in the cooperative signaling of LIF and BMP2 and the subsequent 
induction of astrocytes from neural progenitors.
