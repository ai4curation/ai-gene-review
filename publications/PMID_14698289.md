Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is a G-protein that functions 
as a central switch in the initiation of protein synthesis. In its GTP-bound 
state it delivers the methionyl initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA(i)) to the small 
ribosomal subunit and releases it upon GTP hydrolysis following the recognition 
of the initiation codon. We have developed a complete thermodynamic framework 
for the assembly of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae eIF2.GTP.Met-tRNA(i) ternary 
complex and have determined the effect of the conversion of GTP to GDP on eIF2's 
affinity for Met-tRNA(i) in solution. In its GTP-bound state the factor forms a 
positive interaction with the methionine moiety on Met-tRNA(i) that is disrupted 
when GTP is replaced with GDP, while contacts between the factor and the body of 
the tRNA remain intact. This positive interaction with the methionine residue on 
the tRNA may serve to ensure that only charged initiator tRNA enters the 
initiation pathway. The toggling on and off of the factor's interaction with the 
methionine residue is likely to play an important role in the mechanism of 
initiator tRNA release upon initiation codon recognition. In addition, we show 
that the conserved base-pair A1:U72, which is known to be a critical identity 
element distinguishing initiator from elongator methionyl tRNA, is required for 
recognition of the methionine moiety by eIF2. Our data suggest that a role of 
this base-pair is to orient the methionine moiety on the initiator tRNA in its 
recognition pocket on eIF2.
