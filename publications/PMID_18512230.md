Quantitative changes of enteric glia (EGC) have been implicated in 
gastrointestinal disorders. To facilitate future studies of EGC in human 
pathology, we aimed to characterize thoroughly glial markers in the human 
enteric nervous system (ENS) and to compare EGC in man and guinea pig. 
Whole-mount preparations of the enteric nerve plexuses from human and guinea pig 
ileum and colon were labeled with antibodies against S100b, glial fibrillary 
acidic protein (GFAP), and p75NGFR and the transcription factors Sox8/9/10 and 
neuronally counterstained. Abundant immunoreactivity (IR) for S100b, GFAP, 
p75NGFR, and Sox8/9/10 was detected in EGC of all studied regions. Although the 
cytoplasmatic staining pattern of most markers did not permit glial 
quantification, the nuclear localization of Sox8/9/10-IR allowed to identify and 
count all EGC individually. In both man and guinea pig, myenteric ganglia were 
larger and contained more EGC and neurons than submucous ganglia. Furthermore, 
there were more EGC in the human than in the guinea pig myenteric plexus (MP), 
glial density was consistently higher in the human ENS, and the glia index 
(glia:neuron ratio) ranged from 1.3 to 1.9 and from 5.9 to 7.0 in the human 
submucous plexus (SMP) and MP, respectively, whereas, in guinea pig, the glia 
index was 0.8-1.0 in the SMP and 1.7 in the MP. The glia index was the most 
robust quantitative descriptor within one species. This is a comprehensive set 
of quantitative EGC measures in man and guinea pig that provides a basis for 
pathological assessment of glial proliferation and/or degeneration in the 
diseased gut.
