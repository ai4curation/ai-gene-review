Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is synthesized by two different pathways, the Lands 
cycle and the Kennedy pathway. The recently identified key enzymes of the Lands 
cycle, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 and 2 (LPCAT1 and -2), were 
reported to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and to function in lung 
surfactant production and in inflammation response. Here, we show in various 
mammalian cell lines that both enzymes additionally localize to lipid droplets 
(LDs), which consist of a core of neutral lipids surrounded by a monolayer of 
phospholipid, mainly PC. This dual localization is enabled by the monotopic 
topology of these enzymes demonstrated in this study. Furthermore, we show that 
LDs have the ability to locally synthesize PC and that this activity correlates 
with the LPCAT1 and -2 expression level. This suggests that LPCAT1 and -2 have, 
in addition to their known function in specialized cells, a ubiquitous role in 
LD-associated lipid metabolism.
