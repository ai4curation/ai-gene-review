Chaperonin 60 (cpn60) and chaperonin 10 (cpn10) constitute the chaperonin system 
in prokaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. In Escherichia coli, these two 
chaperonins are also termed groEL and groES. We have used a functional assay to 
identify the groES homolog cpn10 in yeast mitochondria. When dimeric 
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) is denatured and allowed to bind 
to yeast cpn60, subsequent refolding of Rubisco is strictly dependent upon yeast 
cpn10. The heterologous combination of cpn60 from E. coli plus yeast cpn10 is 
also functional. In contrast, yeast cpn60 plus E. coli cpn10 do not support 
refolding of Rubisco. In the presence of MgATP, yeast cpn60 and yeast cpn10 form 
a stable complex that can be isolated by gel filtration and that facilitates 
refolding of denatured Rubisco. Although the potassium-dependent ATPase activity 
of E. coli cpn60 can be inhibited by cpn10 from either E. coli or yeast, neither 
of these cpn10s inhibits the ATPase activity of yeast cpn60. Amino acid 
sequencing of yeast cpn10 reveals substantial similarity to the corresponding 
cpn10 proteins from rat mitochondria and prokaryotes.
