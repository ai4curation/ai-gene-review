The establishment of DNA synthesis during the S phase is a multistep process 
that occurs in several stages beginning in late mitosis. The first step is the 
formation of a large prereplicative complex (pre-RC) at individual replication 
origins and occurs during exit from mitosis and entry into G1 phase. To better 
understand the genetic requirements for pre-RC formation, we selected 
chromosomal suppressors of a temperature-sensitive cdc6-4 mutant defective for 
pre-RC assembly. Loss-of-function mutations in the chromatin-modifying genes 
SIR2, and to a lesser extent in SIR3 and SIR4, suppressed the cdc6-4 
temperature-sensitive lethality. This suppression was independent of the 
well-known silencing roles for the SIR proteins at the HM loci, at telomeres, or 
at the rDNA locus. A deletion of SIR2 uniquely rescued both the DNA synthesis 
defect of the cdc6-4 mutant and its severe plasmid instability phenotype for 
many origins. A SIR2 deletion suppressed additional initiation mutants affecting 
pre-RC assembly but not mutants that act subsequently. These findings suggest 
that Sir2p negatively regulates the initiation of DNA replication through a 
novel mechanism and reveal another connection between proteins that initiate DNA 
synthesis and those that establish silent heterochromatin in budding yeast.
