Leukocyte-specific CD18 integrins are critical in mediating cell recruitment and 
activation during host defense responses to bacterial infection. The signaling 
pathways downstream of CD18 integrins are dependent on the spleen tyrosine 
kinase, Syk. To investigate the role integrin signaling plays in host defense, 
we examined the responses of Syk-deficient neutrophils to bacterial challenge 
with serum-opsonized Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Syk-conditional 
knockout mice lacking this kinase specifically in myeloid cells or just 
neutrophils were also used to investigate host responses in vivo. Syk-deficient 
neutrophils manifested impaired exocytosis of secondary and tertiary granules, 
reduced cytokine release, and very poor activation of the NADPH oxidase in 
response to serum-opsonized S aureus and E coli. These functional defects 
correlated with impaired activation of c-Cbl, Pyk2, Erk1/2, and p38 kinases. 
Bacterial phagocytosis, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, and killing 
were also reduced in Syk-deficient cells, with a more profound effect after S 
aureus challenge. In vivo, loss of Syk in myeloid cells or specifically in 
neutrophils resulted in reduced clearance of S aureus after subcutaneous or 
intraperitoneal infection, despite normal recruitment of inflammatory cells. 
These results indicate that loss of Syk kinase-mediated integrin signaling 
impairs leukocyte activation, leading to reduced host defense responses.

Abstract

Leukocyte-specific CD18 integrins are critical in mediating cell recruitment and activation during host defense responses to bacterial infection. The signaling pathways downstream of CD18 integrins are dependent on the spleen tyrosine kinase, Syk. To investigate the role integrin signaling plays in host defense, we examined the responses of Syk-deficient neutrophils to bacterial challenge with serum-opsonized Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Syk -conditional knockout mice lacking this kinase specifically in myeloid cells or just neutrophils were also used to investigate host responses in vivo. Syk-deficient neutrophils manifested impaired exocytosis of secondary and tertiary granules, reduced cytokine release, and very poor activation of the NADPH oxidase in response to serum-opsonized S aureus and E coli . These functional defects correlated with impaired activation of c-Cbl, Pyk2, Erk1/2, and p38 kinases. Bacterial phagocytosis, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, and killing were also reduced in Syk-deficient cells, with a more profound effect after S aureus challenge. In vivo, loss of Syk in myeloid cells or specifically in neutrophils resulted in reduced clearance of S aureus after subcutaneous or intraperitoneal infection, despite normal recruitment of inflammatory cells. These results indicate that loss of Syk kinase-mediated integrin signaling impairs leukocyte activation, leading to reduced host defense responses.

Introduction

Neutrophils are critical innate immune effectors during responses to infection and inflammation. These cells are activated by a diverse repertoire of receptors; chief among them are the leukocyte-specific CD18 integrins, which mediate neutrophil adhesion during migration and function as phagocytic receptors for bacterial uptake and killing. CD18 deficiency leads to leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I syndrome. 1 These patients present early in life with repeated bacterial infections primarily from impaired phagocyte function, a phenotype that is recapitulated in CD18-deficient mice. 2 – 4

The engagement of neutrophil integrins activates a variety of effector functions critical for host defense, including secretion of granule components, release of cytokines, and generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). 5 The production of distinct cytokines by neutrophils has been demonstrated to influence both the differentiation of macrophages and responses to antibiotic resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus . 6 In neutrophils, after integrin engagement, signaling events are mediated by activation of Src-family and Syk tyrosine kinases, via coupling to immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing molecules. 7 The downstream substrates of Src and Syk kinases that have been implicated in the effector functions elicited by integrin ligation include Pyk2, Cbl, SLP-76, Vav1/3, PLCγ2, and Erk. 8 , 9 Signaling events triggered by integrins are thought to be important for cellular migration; however, syk −/− neutrophils undergo normal migration in CD18-dependent transwell assays, sterile peritonitis, 10 and thrombohemorrhagic vasculitis. 11 Whereas these observations may suggest that CD18-dependent migration is independent of signaling through Syk, more recent studies indicate that the integrin-ITAM pathway regulates the velocity of neutrophil migration in tissues, rather than overall directionality. 12 In contrast, it is clear that activation of adhesion-dependent neutrophil effector functions, such as release of specific granules or production of ROIs after adhesion to integrin ligands, is dependent on Syk signaling. 10 Loss of this signaling pathway blocks tissue injury in the thrombohemorrhagic vasculitis model, indicating the importance of integrin signaling pathways in inflammatory disease. However, the physiologic effect of alterations in integrin signaling in host defense to pathogen infection in vivo remains unknown.

Systemic loss of Syk leads to vascular abnormalities, perinatal lethality, and loss of immune receptor signaling, 13 , 14 which is phenocopied in radiation chimeras 15 and complicates their use in models of infection. This complication is alleviated by the use of a genetically modified syk allele that allows for conditional deletion after expression of Cre recombinase. 16 To study the role of Syk signaling in host defense mediated by myeloid cells, mice containing the loxP flanked-allele of syk ( syk f/f ) were crossed to mice containing Cre under the control of the Lysozyme M 17 or human MRP8 18 promoter. These mice provide a system to assess the importance of Syk in neutrophils during acute bacterial infections in a skin air pouch model. Syk-deficient neutrophils fail to secrete granule components, release induced cytokines, and generate ROIs while retaining elastase activity in response to both S aureus and Escherichia coli . After bacterial infection, Syk-deficient neutrophils migrate normally; but because of the defects in neutrophil function, killing of S aureus , and to a lesser extent E coli , is impaired. These data support a critical role for Syk signaling in the induction of neutrophil effector functions during innate immune responses.

Discussion

In this study, we report that Syk-deficient neutrophils fail to secrete granule components, release induced cytokines, and generate ROIs, while retaining partial elastase activity in response to S aureus and E coli . This results in a reduced ability of syk −/− neutrophils to kill bacteria in vitro. We also measured the consequences of Syk deficiency in vivo; and although neutrophil migration is normal in the absence of Syk, the defects in neutrophil function result in impaired killing of S aureus and, to a lesser extent, E coli . These data indicate a requirement for Syk signaling during innate immune responses to bacteria.

Syk was previously shown to be required for CD18 integrin-dependent adhesive responses. 10 Our results implicate Syk in host responses to bacterial infection. In particular, the exocytosis of granules containing cytokines that are induced and stored before secretion are impaired in Syk-deficient neutrophils. The mechanisms and location of neutrophil cytokine production, storage, and exocytosis are relatively poorly understood. It has been demonstrated that human IL-8 is produced and released from activated neutrophils in vitro and is stored in an organelle distinct from classically defined granules and secretory vesicles. 37 The production of IL-8 by neutrophils is initiated by accumulation of mRNA transcripts, followed by posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulation, varying in response to the stimulus. 31 The normal accumulation of TNF-α mRNA and protein in syk −/− neutrophils suggests that the kinase is not involved in these initial steps but has a primary function in granule release. Why syk −/− neutrophils fail to overaccumulate cytokines resulting from impaired release is unclear. Because neutrophils themselves are responsive to TNF-α, MIP1α, MIP2, and KC, the reduced secretion of these cytokines by Syk-deficiency could result in a reduction in feedback responses, leading ultimately to reduced storage or increased cellular turnover of these cytokines.

Previous studies demonstrated that macrophages 38 and myeloid dendritic cells 39 require Syk for negative regulation of cytokine secretion in response to bacterial cell wall products. Our data demonstrate that neutrophils require Syk for maximal secretion of inflammatory cytokines in response to serum-opsonized bacteria. This suggests that the use of Syk-dependent signaling events differs between neutrophils, macrophages, and myeloid dendritic cells after stimulation with bacteria. Analysis of signaling events triggered during serum-opsonized bacterial stimulation support this finding, in that syk −/− neutrophils have decreased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in contrast to hyperphosphorylation of Erk1/2 in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide. 38 Other studies ruled out a role for Syk in complement-mediated phagocytosis of E coli 40 or zymosan 15 in macrophages, which contrasts with our results of reduced phagocytosis of S aureus and, to a lesser extent, E coli , in syk −/− neutrophils. This again highlights the diverse roles that Syk plays in different cell types.

Here we show that Syk is required for CD18-dependent responses to bacteria in neutrophils, illustrating the importance of integrin signaling during innate immune responses. Our results support and extend a previous report demonstrating the requirement of CD18 for efficient phagocytosis and ROI production in response to serum-opsonized bacteria. 41 One important difference between the receptor, CD18, and the signaling molecules, namely, Syk, is that, whereas CD18 is required for normal intracellular elastase activation in response to both S aureus and E coli , Syk is only partially required for this response. The failure of CD18 −/− neutrophils to phagocytose complement-opsonized bacteria could explain this phenotypic divergence. The requirement of Syk signaling for ROI production, but not elastase activation, has important implications for bacterial clearance. Mice deficient in components of the NADPH-oxidase complex are more susceptible to S aureus challenge than E coli , indicating that ROI production has less of a protective role in Gram-negative infections. 33 , 34 Conversely, mice deficient in neutrophil elastase are more susceptible to E coli but relatively resistant to S aureus . 36 Thus, the increased susceptibility of mice lacking Syk in neutrophils to S aureus probably results from their inability to produce ROIs, whereas the less pronounced susceptibility to E coli could be the result of retention of elastase activity.

CD11b and CD18 are required for a robust clearance of S aureus after air pouch challenge 42 (and J.A.V.Z. and C.A.L., unpublished data, September 2009). The susceptibility of mice lacking Syk in myeloid cells, and specifically in neutrophils, to S aureus after air pouch challenge supports an in vivo requirement for Syk-signaling downstream of CD18 integrins. Given that Syk has a dominant role in neutrophil-dependent host defense responses relative to macrophages, the impaired clearance of bacteria in the s yk f /− LysMcre Tg /+ mice probably represents neutrophil dysfunction. This is further supported by the impaired clearance of bacteria in the s yk fl /− Mrp8cre Tg mice, where syk deletion is restricted to neutrophils. However, in both our Cre Tg lines, neutrophil deletion of syk was not complete, as determined by flow cytometry. Hence, the reduced ability of s yk f /− LysMcre Tg /+ and s yk fl /− Mrp8cre Tg mice to clear bacterial infections probably represents an underestimate of the role of Syk in host defense. More complete deletion would probably result in more impaired bacterial clearance in vivo. However, the syk −/− radiation chimeras are not a suitable choice to resolve this potential issue because of the complication of the vascular phenotype. 15 The concept that impaired signaling through neutrophil CD18 integrins can lead to impaired host defense is also evidenced by reduced clearance of S aureus in Vav1/3-deficient mice during a lung infection. 43 Vav proteins are known to be required downstream of Syk in the leukocyte integrin signaling pathway. 44

E coli and S aureus can trigger a different variety of activating receptors on the neutrophil surface besides CD11b, probably contributing to the differences in neutrophil effector phenotypes between syk −/− and CD18 −/− cells. These receptors include TLRs (TLR4 vs TLR2), C-type lectins, and Ig-superfamily members, such as TREM-1 45 and TREM-2. 46 In addition, CD11c/CD18 dimers may recognize bacterial ligands, for example, on S aureus , which would explain normal TNF-α release from CD11b −/− compared with CD18 −/− neutrophils. It is probable that several receptors, not just CD18, are engaged during neutrophil responses to bacteria, particularly in vivo where the bacteria are not directly incubated with serum opsonins. In addition, Syk is required for signal transduction from receptors other than CD18, such as TREM-1 and TREM-2, which are known to signal via ITAM-bearing molecules, and some C-type lectins, including Dectin-1, which signal via an ITAM-like motif. 47 Hence, it is possible that some of the host defense deficits in Syk-deficient neutrophils may represent defects in signaling pathways other than CD18 integrins. This may explain why some of the functional defects of syk −/− cells, such as TNF-α secretion, appear to be CD18 independent. For example, Syk is involved in coupling TLR signaling to downstream pathways through CARD9, 48 which could lead to impaired TNF-α release after E coli challenge.

Overall, these results demonstrate that Syk is a critical signaling molecule for neutrophil effector responses to bacteria. Although inhibitors of Syk are being actively pursued in clinical trials for the treatment of neutrophil-dependent inflammatory diseases, the data presented here raise the possibility that the use of such inhibitors may reduce the ability of patients to clear certain types of bacterial infections, in particular those arising from Gram-positive bacteria. Recent demonstrations of the involvement of Syk in antifungal host defenses, through signaling involving inflammasome activation or Dectin-1, also raise concern that anti-Syk therapeutics may put patients at risk for these types of infections. 49 , 50 A deeper understanding of Syk signaling in neutrophils during infection and inflammation may provide a rationale for differential dosing of Syk inhibitors, allowing attenuation of tissue-destructive inflammation while maintaining Syk-dependent microbicidal activity.
