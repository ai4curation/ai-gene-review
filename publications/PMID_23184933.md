Sustained activation of X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) results in endothelial 
cell (EC) apoptosis and atherosclerosis development. The present study provides 
evidence that XBP1 mRNA splicing triggered an autophagic response in ECs by 
inducing autophagic vesicle formation and markers of autophagy BECLIN-1 and 
microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3β (LC3-βII). Endostatin activated 
autophagic gene expression through XBP1 mRNA splicing in an inositol-requiring 
enzyme 1α (IRE1α)-dependent manner. Knockdown of XBP1 or IRE1α by shRNA in ECs 
ablated endostatin-induced autophagosome formation. Importantly, data from 
arterial vessels from XBP1 EC conditional knock-out (XBP1eko) mice demonstrated 
that XBP1 deficiency in ECs reduced the basal level of LC3β expression and 
ablated response to endostatin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further 
revealed that the spliced XBP1 isoform bound directly to the BECLIN-1 promoter 
at the region from nt -537 to -755. BECLIN-1 deficiency in ECs abolished the 
XBP1-induced autophagy response, whereas spliced XBP1 did not induce 
transcriptional activation of a truncated BECLIN-1 promoter. These results 
suggest that XBP1 mRNA splicing triggers an autophagic signal pathway through 
transcriptional regulation of BECLIN-1.
