Expression of the TP53 tumor suppressor is tightly controlled for its ability to 
function as a critical regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and death in 
response to DNA damage. However, little is known about the mechanisms and 
contributions of the transcriptional regulation of TP53. Here we report that 
protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta), a ubiquitously expressed member of the novel 
subfamily of PKC isoforms, transactivates TP53 expression at the transcriptional 
level. Reporter assays demonstrated that PKCdelta induces the promoter activity 
of TP53 through the TP53 core promoter element (CPE-TP53) and that such 
induction is enhanced in response to DNA damage. The results also demonstrate 
that, upon exposure to genotoxic stress, PKCdelta activates and interacts with 
the death-promoting transcription factor Btf to co-occupy CPE-TP53. Inhibition 
of PKCdelta activity decreases the affinity of Btf for CPE-TP53, thereby 
reducing TP53 expression at both the mRNA and the protein levels. In concert 
with these results, we show that disruption of Btf-mediated TP53 gene 
transcription by RNA interference leads to suppression of TP53-mediated 
apoptosis following genotoxic stress. These findings provide evidence that 
activation of TP53 gene transcription by PKCdelta triggers TP53-dependent 
apoptosis in response to DNA damage.

Abstract

Expression of the TP53 tumor suppressor is tightly controlled for its ability to function as a critical regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and death in response to DNA damage. However, little is known about the mechanisms and contributions of the transcriptional regulation of TP53. Here we report that protein kinase C δ (PKCδ), a ubiquitously expressed member of the novel subfamily of PKC isoforms, transactivates TP53 expression at the transcriptional level. Reporter assays demonstrated that PKCδ induces the promoter activity of TP53 through the TP53 core promoter element (CPE-TP53) and that such induction is enhanced in response to DNA damage. The results also demonstrate that, upon exposure to genotoxic stress, PKCδ activates and interacts with the death-promoting transcription factor Btf to co-occupy CPE-TP53. Inhibition of PKCδ activity decreases the affinity of Btf for CPE-TP53, thereby reducing TP53 expression at both the mRNA and the protein levels. In concert with these results, we show that disruption of Btf-mediated TP53 gene transcription by RNA interference leads to suppression of TP53-mediated apoptosis following genotoxic stress. These findings provide evidence that activation of TP53 gene transcription by PKCδ triggers TP53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage.

DISCUSSION

Since TP53 protein is a critical regulator of cell growth, its expression must be tightly regulated to ensure normal cell division as well as its ability to function as a tumor suppressor. However, little is known about the mechanisms and consequences of the transcriptional regulation of TP53. In the present study, we showed that expression of TP53 at both mRNA and protein levels increased after treatment of cells with the genotoxic agent ADR. Down-regulation of TP53 at mRNA levels was associated with reduction of TP53 expression at protein levels (Fig. 1 ). In this context, transcriptional control mechanisms are critically important in modulating cellular levels of the TP53 tumor suppressor protein after DNA damage. In addition, knock-down of Btf, a transcriptional regulator of TP53, substantially abolished TP53-dependent apoptosis, indicating that the function of TP53 as a tumor suppressor is regulated, at least in part, at a transcriptional level (Fig. 7A ). Previous studies have shown that CPE-TP53, covering the region from −70 to −46 in the TP53 promoter, is essential for TP53 promoter activity induced by genotoxic stress as well as maintained at steady-state level ( 27 ). In this regard, a novel 21-bp motif named PE21, which overlaps with the CPE-TP53 region, was identified as the sequence responsible for UV-induced transcription and oncostatin M-mediated transcriptional repression ( 15 , 20 ). These findings collectively suggest a critical role for CPE-TP53 in the regulation of TP53 gene expression and stress response. In concert with these results, our experiments with mutational analysis also showed that the small fragment containing CPE-TP53 (−90-TP53-Luc) revealed dramatically increased responsiveness to ADR, whereas deletion of 10 bp from CPE-TP53 (ΔCPE-TP53-Luc) was sufficient to completely abrogate the TP53 promoter responsiveness to DNA damage as well as the basal promoter activity (Fig. 2E and F and 3B and C ). Thus, consistent with the results of previous studies, our findings suggest that a positive regulator participates in the transcriptional regulation of TP53 via CPE-TP53. Whereas recent studies have shown that transcription factor KLF4 acts directly on PE21 and causes resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis and that MUC1 associates with KLF4 to down-regulate TP53 expression ( 24 , 36 ), positive regulation via CPE-TP53 has not been demonstrated previously. In this context, the present study demonstrates that PKCδ binds to and activates a transcription factor, Btf. PKCδ occupies CPE-TP53 with Btf and increases Btf occupancy of CPE-TP53, thereby activating TP53 gene transcription in response to DNA damage. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify Btf as a positive regulator of TP53 gene transcription and to show that Btf transactivates PKCδ-dependent TP53 gene transcription.

PKCδ seems to be involved in the basal level of TP53 and not DNA damage-induced TP53 expression in MOLT-4 and COS-7 cells (Fig. 1A , 2C , and 3C ). On the other hand, down-regulation of PKCδ significantly attenuated TP53 expression and TP53 promoter activity following DNA damage in U2OS and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1B and C , 2B , and 3B ). In this context, the promoter analysis revealed that there is HOXA5-dependent regulation of TP53 gene transcription after DNA damage in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2F , compared to −157-TP53-Luc [Fig. 2C ] and −118-TP53-Luc [Fig. 2D ]; also see Fig. 2D ) but not U2OS cells (Fig. 2E compared to 2C and 2D). Interestingly, previous studies have demonstrated that HOXA5 is detectable in only one-third of the primary tumors ( 22 ). This suggests the possibility that loss of HOXA5 is associated with substantial PKCδ-dependent regulation of TP53 expression at a steady-state level and in response to DNA damage, in cancer cells (for example, U2OS cells) but not normal cells (for example, COS-7 cells). Furthermore, other studies have demonstrated that Homeobox genes are a family of regulatory genes that act as transcription factors and that the aberrant expression of HOX genes is associated with the leukemic phenotype ( 3 ). In this regard, it is plausible that aberrant expression of HOX proteins in MOLT-4 cells is, at least in part, required for DNA damage-induced expression of TP53 (Fig. 1A ). Obviously, given that a lot of transcription factors participate in regulation of TP53 gene transcription, further analyses are needed to clarify these mechanisms.

Previous studies have established that PKCδ is involved in transcriptional regulation. For instance, PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser 727 is required for the transcriptional regulation of interferon-sensitive genes, whereas PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser 727 reduces its DNA-binding and transcriptional activity. p300 is a transcriptional coactivator/histone acetyltransferase that is also phosphorylated at Ser 89 by PKCδ ( 12 , 31 , 48 ). These findings demonstrate that PKCδ regulates transcription factors in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The present study revealed that Btf binds directly to the TP53 promoter at the CPE-TP53 region and activates TP53 gene transcription. Notably, Btf interacts with PKCδ, and inhibition of PKCδ kinase activity attenuates the affinity of Btf for CPE-TP53, regardless of Btf expression (Fig. 5 and 6 ). These findings indicate that PKCδ-dependent activation of Btf is required for transcriptional regulation of the TP53 gene and thus suggest the possibility that Btf might be a novel phosphorylation substrate for PKCδ. More importantly, these results provide another potential model for transcriptional regulation pathways mediated by PKCδ.

Btf is a newly identified transcription factor with respect to its role as a CPE-TP53 binding protein. Previous studies showed that Btf is a death-promoting transcription factor that contains putative basic zipper-like and Myb-like DNA-binding domains, allowing Btf to bind to DNA in vitro ( 13 ). However, the downstream targets and mechanisms of Btf-induced apoptosis remain poorly understood. Our results show that Btf directly interacted with the TP53 promoter in vivo (Fig. 5A ) and that this interaction was associated with the activation of TP53 gene transcription (Fig. 6 ). Moreover, silencing of Btf expression reduced TP53-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 7A ). These findings provide evidence that TP53 is a downstream target of Btf and suggest that Btf induces apoptosis in a TP53-dependent manner. Interestingly, in contrast to the results of previous studies, our findings demonstrate that Btf is involved in apoptosis not only by repressing the transcription of survival genes but also by directly activating the expression of genes promoting apoptosis. We also found that activation of Btf by PKCδ is critical for TP53 gene transcription; however, the precise mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated. Since PKCδ is a serine/threonine kinase, it is conceivable that PKCδ activates Btf by phosphorylation. In this regard, Btf contains plenty of serine/threonine residues that can be modified by phosphorylation; however, whether PKCδ activates Btf by phosphorylation is beyond the scope of the present study. Further analyses are needed to more clearly define regulatory mechanisms involving Btf and PKCδ.

PKCδ is required for apoptosis induced by a wide variety of stimuli in many cell types, but many mechanistic details remain to be elucidated. Recent studies have shown that PKCδ is proteolytically cleaved to a 40-kDa catalytically active fragment by caspase-3 in response to apoptotic stimuli ( 5 , 6 ). The importance of the PKCδ catalytic fragment in apoptotic activity was demonstrated by the finding that overexpression of the PKCδ catalytic domain is targeted into mitochondria and nuclei to induce nuclear fragmentation and cell apoptosis ( 9 , 44 ). Other studies have indicated that the aberrant activation of topoisomerase IIα by PKCδ is associated with the induction of apoptosis upon exposure to genotoxic agents ( 47 ). Thus, DNA damage-induced nuclear targeting of PKCδ contributes to the induction of an intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In the present study, we further demonstrated that TP53 functions as a novel nuclear effector of PKCδ-mediated apoptosis. We also showed that PKCδ activates transcription factor Btf to bind to the TP53 promoter (Fig. 5 ). Inhibition of PKCδ activity decreased the affinity of Btf for the TP53 promoter, resulting in reduction of TP53 protein expression (Fig. 6 ). Moreover, suppression of transcriptional activation by Btf silencing diminished TP53-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 7A and B ), implying that regulation of Btf by PKCδ also has a critical role in determining the fate of cells with DNA damage. Taken together, these findings support a model in which the activation of TP53 gene transcription by PKCδ results in TP53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage (Fig. 8 ).
