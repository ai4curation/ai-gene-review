Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is an endogenous 
secreted peptide and, in preclinical studies, preferentially induces apoptosis 
in tumor cells rather than in normal cells. The acquisition of resistance in 
cells exposed to TRAIL or its mimics limits their clinical efficacy. Because 
kinases are intimately involved in the regulation of apoptosis, we 
systematically characterized kinases involved in TRAIL signaling. Using RNA 
interference (RNAi) loss-of-function and cDNA overexpression screens, we 
identified 169 protein kinases that influenced the dynamics of TRAIL-induced 
apoptosis in the colon adenocarcinoma cell line DLD-1. We classified the kinases 
as sensitizers or resistors or modulators, depending on the effect that 
knockdown and overexpression had on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Two of these 
kinases that were classified as resistors were PX domain-containing 
serine/threonine kinase (PXK) and AP2-associated kinase 1 (AAK1), which promote 
receptor endocytosis and may enable cells to resist TRAIL-induced apoptosis by 
enhancing endocytosis of the TRAIL receptors. We assembled protein interaction 
maps using mass spectrometry-based protein interaction analysis and quantitative 
phosphoproteomics. With these protein interaction maps, we modeled information 
flow through the networks and identified apoptosis-modifying kinases that are 
highly connected to regulated substrates downstream of TRAIL. The results of 
this analysis provide a resource of potential targets for the development of 
TRAIL combination therapies to selectively kill cancer cells.
