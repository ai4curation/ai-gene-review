## Abstract

Transsulfuration depends on heme in addition to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. 
Cystathionine beta-synthase is a heme protein.

The first committed step of transsulfuration is catalyzed by cystathionine 
beta-synthase (CBS), a known pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) enzyme. The inferred 
amino acid sequences of rat liver CBS and rat liver hemoprotein H-450 are 
identical. We now confirm the presence of heme b in rat and human liver CBS. 
Heme almost entirely accounts for the visible spectrum of CBS rather than PLP. 
Human CBS, expressed in Escherichia coli, acquires heme b from the host 
bacteria. delta-Aminolevulinate supplementation during bacterial growth 
increases both the heme saturation and the specific activity of the homogeneous 
enzyme more than 3-fold. 1 mol of the 63-kDa CBS subunit binds 1 mol of each 
(heme and PLP). The presence of heme is required for PLP binding, and the amount 
of PLP bound is limited by the heme content. Removal of PLP, but not heme, from 
CBS is reversible. These findings suggest that heme is functionally incorporated 
into CBS only during protein folding. This report describes the first instance 
of an enzyme that depends upon both heme and PLP for its function.
