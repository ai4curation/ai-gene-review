Cytochrome c binds to cardiolipin (CL) on the inner mitochondrial membrane 
during the initial stages of apoptosis where it oxidizes CL, promoting its 
release into the cytoplasm where it initiates apoptosis. Previous work has 
identified interaction sites on cytochrome c involved in the cytochrome c-CL 
interaction. The contributions of the lysines attributed to site A, the anionic 
site, are studied here to elucidate the relative importance of each for 
electrostatic interaction of cytochrome c with CL at pH 8, conditions where site 
A is dominant. A set of single, double, and quadruple lysine to alanine variants 
of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c, at sequence positions 72, 73, 86, and 87, show that 
all contribute to the site A-mediated interaction with CL. All variants 
experience two sequential structural rearrangements as the lipid to protein 
ratio (LPR) increases. At a low LPR near 10, all variants undergo a small 
heme-centered structural change detected by Soret circular dichroism. At higher 
LPRs ranging from 22 to 34, all variants partially unfold as detected by Trp59 
emission. The robustness of the mechanism of interaction to sequential 
neutralization of the four lysines assigned to site A demonstrates that site A 
is more extensive than previously supposed. The nature of both structural 
rearrangements also depends on which lysines constitute site A. The peroxidase 
activity of cytochrome c in the early stages of apoptosis depends on the nature 
of structural rearrangement near the heme. Thus, the lysines that comprise site 
A may have evolved to optimize the peroxidase signaling switch.
