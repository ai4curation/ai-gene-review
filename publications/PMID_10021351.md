We have identified a new member of the TGF-beta superfamily, CET-1, from 
Caenorhabditis elegans, which is expressed in the ventral nerve cord and other 
neurons. cet-1 null mutants have shortened bodies and male tail abnormal 
phenotype resembling sma mutants, suggesting cet-1, sma-2, sma-3 and sma-4 share 
a common pathway. Overexpression experiments demonstrated that cet-1 function 
requires wild-type sma genes. Interestingly, CET-1 appears to affect body length 
in a dose-dependent manner. Heterozygotes for cet-1 displayed body lengths 
ranging between null mutant and wild type, and overexpression of CET-1 in 
wild-type worms elongated body length close to lon mutants. In male sensory ray 
patterning, lack of cet-1 function results in ray fusions. Epistasis analysis 
revealed that mab-21 lies downstream and is negatively regulated by the 
cet-1/sma pathway in the male tail. Our results show that cet-1 controls diverse 
biological processes during C. elegans development probably through different 
target genes.
