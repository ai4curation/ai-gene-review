Ethylene signaling in plants is mediated by a family of ethylene receptors 
related to bacterial two-component regulators. Expression in yeast of 
ethylene-binding domains from the five receptor isoforms from Arabidopsis 
thaliana and five-receptor isoforms from tomato confirmed that all members of 
the family are capable of high-affinity ethylene-binding activity. All receptor 
isoforms displayed a similar level of ethylene binding on a per unit protein 
basis, while members of both subfamily I and subfamily II from Arabidopsis 
showed similar slow-release kinetics for ethylene. Quantification of 
receptor-isoform mRNA levels in receptor-deficient Arabidopsis lines indicated a 
direct correlation between total message level and total ethylene-binding 
activity in planta. Increased expression of remaining receptor isoforms in 
receptor-deficient lines tended to compensate for missing receptors at the level 
of mRNA expression and ethylene-binding activity, but not at the level of 
receptor signaling, consistent with specialized roles for family members in 
receptor signal output.
