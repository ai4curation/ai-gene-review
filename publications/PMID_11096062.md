Autophagy is a process that involves the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic 
components by the lysosomal/vacuolar system. In the yeast, Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, an autophagosome is formed in the cytosol. The outer membrane of the 
autophagosome is fused with the vacuole, releasing the inner membrane structure, 
an autophagic body, into the vacuole. The autophagic body is subsequently 
degraded by vacuolar hydrolases. Taking advantage of yeast genetics, apg 
(autophagy-defective) mutants were isolated that are defective in terms of 
formation of autophagic bodies under nutrient starvation conditions. One of the 
APG gene products, Apg12p, is covalently attached to Apg5p via the C-terminal 
Gly of Apg12p as in the case of ubiquitylation, and this conjugation is 
essential for autophagy. Apg7p is a novel E1 enzyme essential for the 
Apg12p-conjugation system. In mammalian cells, the human Apg12p homolog 
(hApg12p) also conjugates with the human Apg5p homolog. In this study, the 
unique characteristics of hApg7p are shown. A two-hybrid experiment indicated 
that hApg12p interacts with hApg7p. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that 
Cys(572) of hApg7p is an authentic active site cysteine residue essential for 
the formation of the hApg7p.hApg12p intermediate. Overexpression of hApg7p 
enhances the formation of the hApg5p.hApg12p conjugate, indicating that hApg7p 
is an E1-like enzyme essential for the hApg12p conjugation system. Cross-linking 
experiments and glycerol-gradient centrifugation analysis showed that the 
mammalian Apg7p homolog forms a homodimer as in yeast Apg7p. Each of three human 
Apg8p counterparts, i.e. the Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa, GABA(A) 
receptor-associated protein, and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3, 
coimmunoprecipitates with hApg7p and conjugates with mutant hApg7p(C572S) to 
form a stable intermediate via an ester bond. These results indicate that hApg7p 
is an authentic protein-activating enzyme for hApg12p and the three Apg8p 
homologs.
