In the present paper we have analyzed uPAR-mediated cellular binding to 
vitronectin using the murine erythroid progenitor cell line 32D. We show that 
expression of uPAR in 32D cells promotes cellular binding to vitronectin, but 
fails to support cell spreading. The strength of binding is correlated to the 
expression level of uPAR and is strongly stimulated by the presence of uPAR 
ligands. Using a truncated variant of uPAR lacking domain 1 and by antibody 
inhibition experiments, we demonstrate that domain 1 plays a crucial role in 
uPAR-mediated cellular binding. The failure of the mutant uPAR to promote 
cellular binding is paralleled by a strong reduction in the affinity for 
vitronectin in vitro.
