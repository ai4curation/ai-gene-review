BACKGROUND: The human POB1/REPS2 (Partner of RalBP1) protein is highly conserved 
in mammals where it has been suggested to function as a molecular scaffold 
recruiting proteins involved in vesicular traffic and linking them to the actin 
cytoskeleton remodeling machinery. More recently POB1/REPS2 was found highly 
expressed in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines, while one of its 
isoforms (isoform 2) is down regulated during prostate cancer progression.
RESULTS: In this report we characterize the central proline rich domain of 
POB1/REPS2 and we describe for the first time its functional role in receptor 
endocytosis. We show that the ectopic expression of this domain has a dominant 
negative effect on the endocytosis of activated epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) while leaving transferrin receptor endocytosis unaffected. By a 
combination of different approaches (phage display, bioinformatics predictions, 
peptide arrays, mutagenic analysis, in vivo co-immunoprecipitation), we have 
identified two closely spaced binding motifs for 14-3-3 and for the SH3 of the 
proteins Amphiphysin II and Grb2. Differently from wild type, proline rich 
domains that are altered in these motifs do not inhibit EGFR endocytosis, 
suggesting that these binding motifs play a functional role in this process.
CONCLUSION: Our findings are relevant to the characterization of the molecular 
mechanism underlying the involvement of POB1/REPS2, SH3 and 14-3-3 proteins in 
receptor endocytosis, suggesting that 14-3-3 could work by bridging the EGF 
receptor and the scaffold protein POB1/REPS2.
