Abstract

P granules are non-membrane-bound RNA-protein compartments that are involved in germline development in C. elegans . They are liquids that condense at one end of the embryo by localized phase separation, driven by gradients of polarity proteins such as the mRNA-binding protein MEX-5. To probe how polarity proteins regulate phase separation, we combined biochemistry and theoretical modeling. We reconstitute P granule-like droplets in vitro using a single protein PGL-3. By combining in vitro reconstitution with measurements of intracellular concentrations, we show that competition between PGL-3 and MEX-5 for mRNA can regulate the formation of PGL-3 droplets. Using theory we show that in a MEX-5 gradient, this mRNA competition mechanism can drive a gradient of P granule assembly with similar spatial and temporal characteristics to P granule assembly in vivo. We conclude that gradients of polarity proteins can position RNP granules during development, by using RNA competition to regulate local phase separation.

Introduction

One of the most intriguing questions in cell biology is how a cell communicates positional information to downstream components, and how it organizes biochemistry in time and space. An example of spatial organization of biochemistry is the asymmetric segregation of components into daughter cells during cell division. A cell first establishes spatial asymmetry by building polarity systems and then communicates this asymmetry to downstream components.

A classic example of polarity-driven segregation of downstream components is the segregation of P granules during the early cell divisions of C. elegans embryos ( Brangwynne et al., 2009 ; Hird et al., 1996 ; Strome and Wood, 1982 ). P granules are believed to be equivalent to the nuage in Drosophila or germ granules in other animal cells ( Voronina, 2013 ) and belong to a class of non-membrane-bound compartments that consist of many proteins and RNAs, such as nucleoli ( Brangwynne et al., 2011 ), Cajal bodies ( Strzelecka et al., 2010 ), stress granules ( Wippich et al., 2013 ). Shortly after fertilization, they are distributed throughout the one-cell stage embryo, but then become concentrated at the posterior pole, where they are inherited by the P 1 cell after cell division ( Strome and Wood, 1982 ). The subsequent three P cell divisions are also asymmetric, giving rise at each division to a smaller P cell and a larger somatic cell. During each division, P granules segregate into the P cell ( Hird et al., 1996 ), before eventually becoming incorporated in the future germ line, where they contribute to its integrity and function ( Updike et al., 2014 ).

The one-cell stage C. elegans embryo drives P granule segregation through a well-studied polarity system. The embryo first establishes anterior-posterior information by segregating PAR proteins into two cortical domains consisting of PAR-6/PAR-3/PKC in the anterior domain, and PAR-2/LGL/PAR-1 in the posterior domain ( Guo and Kemphues, 1996 ; Hoege and Hyman, 2013 ). Genetic perturbations suggest that signals from the PAR-1 protein, which is concentrated in the posterior cortical domain and the posterior cytoplasm, dictate the establishment of an anterior-posterior cytoplasmic concentration gradient of two closely related RNA-binding proteins MEX-5 and MEX-6 ( Daniels et al., 2010 ; Griffin et al., 2011 ; Pagano et al., 2007 ; Schubert et al., 2000 ; Tenlen et al., 2008 ). These gradients are in turn required for segregation of P granules ( Brangwynne et al., 2009 ; Daniels et al., 2010 ; Gallo et al., 2010 ; Griffin et al., 2011 ; Schubert et al., 2000 ; Tenlen et al., 2008 ). However, the molecular mechanisms by which MEX-5/6 gradient segregate P granules remains unclear.

A key break through in understanding the segregation of P granules was the discovery that P granules are liquid-like compartments that form by liquid-liquid demixing phase separation from the cytoplasm ( Brangwynne et al., 2009 ). Because they are liquids, P granules have been proposed to segregate by a gradient of phase separation, such that they tend to demix from the cytoplasm at the posterior and mix at the anterior of the embryo ( Brangwynne et al., 2009 ). However, consideration of the physics of phase separation of P granules in a MEX-5/6 gradient is also a more complex process than conventional phase separation ( Bray, 1994 ), because phase separation is taking place in a concentration gradient. Theoretical considerations suggested that local concentrations of MEX-5/6 in the gradient regulate position-dependent phase separation of P granules ( Brangwynne et al., 2009 ; Lee et al., 2013 ). Further, it is predicted that even weak gradients of the regulator MEX-5/6 can lead to segregation of P granules to the posterior of the embryo ( Lee et al., 2013 ). However, the physical mechanism by which a MEX-5/6 gradient could influence phase separation of P granules remains unclear.

In biological systems, phase separation can be triggered by changing interaction energies among molecular components, for example by phosphorylation ( Wang et al., 2014 ). Alternatively, phase separation can also be triggered by changes in composition that lead to formation of macromolecular complexes with distinct interaction energies. One example of compositional changes that can modulate phase separation of proteins is RNA, which by interacting with proteins, forms protein/RNA macromolecular complexes ( Berry et al., 2015 ; Burke et al., 2015 ; Lin et al., 2015 ; Molliex et al., 2015 ; Schwartz et al., 2013 ; Wang et al., 2015 ; Zhang et al., 2015 ). Recent work on phase separation suggests that RNA is an important component of phase separated compartments: It can trigger their assembly and change their biophysics properties. The fact that MEX-5/6 contain zinc fingers, which mediate interaction with mRNA suggests that mRNA could in someway influence the polarity system.

In this paper, we combine in vitro reconstitution of P granules, in vivo measurements of protein and RNA concentration, and theory to explore the mechanisms by which MEX-5 regulates phase separation of P granules. We show that a single P granule protein, PGL-3, can phase separate to form non-membrane-bound liquid drops in vitro with biophysical properties similar to P granules in vivo. Long messenger RNA molecules bind to PGL-3 protein with low sequence specificity and promote phase separation of PGL-3 drops. MEX-5 can regulate PGL-3 drop formation by competing with PGL-3 for mRNA binding. Using measured values of intracellular concentrations of PGL-3, MEX-5 and mRNA, and their interaction parameters, we use theory to show that a competition mechanism between PGL-3 and MEX-5 for mRNA can account for the MEX-5 gradient-dependent P granule segregation observed in vivo.

Discussion

In this paper, we have studied the mechanism by which MEX-5 can regulate the formation of P granules in C. elegans embryos. The mechanism we propose is based on competition between MEX-5 and PGL-3 for binding to mRNA ( Figure 7 ). In this model, MEX-5 influences the demixing of PGL-3 and mRNA by depleting the local free mRNA concentration. The critical requirement for this mechanism to work is that the complex of mRNA and PGL-3 (PGL-3:mRNA) must have a higher demixing tendency compared to PGL-3 alone.

A number of models have previously been proposed for spatial organization of cellular components. One class invokes reaction diffusion processes, such as the formation of gradients of morphogens. Another example is the formation of a meiotic spindle. It is thought that a gradient of the GTPase Ran localizes nucleation of microtubules to the region of chromatin ( Carazo-Salas et al., 1999 ). Our proposed mechanism for P granule segregation includes reaction diffusion but extends it to include phase separation. The reaction component is the formation of MEX-5 and PGL-3 bound to mRNA, while phase separation comes via formation of PGL-3:mRNA droplets. Combining reaction diffusion processes and phase separation provides a number of interesting features for a cell. For instance, it provides an amplification mechanism that turns a shallow gradient into switch-like behavior ( Lee et al., 2013 ). Indeed our model predicts that P granule segregation is relatively insensitive to the steepness of the MEX-5 gradient, as long as this gradient can sufficiently redistribute the mRNA-bound form of PGL-3 with greater demixing tendency compared to PGL-3 alone, such that PGL-3:mRNA is depleted from the anterior and enriched in the posterior of the embryo. Therefore, this provides a system that is robust to perturbations of the MEX-5 gradient.

The proposed mechanism is consistent with key observations on MEX-5 biology. MEX-5 works together with another similar protein MEX-6 ( Schubert et al., 2000 ). It is known that after RNAi of MEX-5/MEX-6, P granules form but do not segregate ( Brangwynne et al., 2009 ; Gallo et al., 2010 ; Schubert et al., 2000 ). On the other hand, if MEX-5/6 is present but does not form a gradient, for instance in PAR-1 mutants, then P granules eventually disappear ( Brangwynne et al., 2009 ; Gallo et al., 2010 ; Griffin et al., 2011 ; Tenlen et al., 2008 ).

Our model makes a set of testable predictions on our proposed competition mechanism. First, following polarity establishment, the mRNA bound form of PGL-3 should concentrate in the posterior of the embryo while the anterior should be enriched for PGL-3 not bound to mRNA. Second, if the concentrations of MEX-5 and MEX-6 are increased sufficiently, P granules should dissolve since MEX-5/6 will deplete the mRNA available for P granule assembly. Third, in embryos that lack MEX-6 but depend on a mutant form of MEX-5 that cannot bind to mRNA, P granules should not segregate to the posterior. Fourth, in embryos where due to some genetic perturbations the MEX-5 gradient is established before P granule formation, P granules should assemble first at the posterior of the embryo where MEX-5 concentration is low (see Movie S5 ).

A more subtle prediction is that if the concentration of PGL-3 is raised above a point where mRNA is no longer required for P granule assembly (~ 5 times the in vivo concentration of PGL-3), rapid P granule segregation seen in normal embryos will not take place (assuming that embryos do not compensate in other ways for increase in protein levels). However, under these conditions, P granules should eventually segregate. This is because, normally, the MEX-5/6 gradient creates a gradient of supersaturation along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis that leads to rapid dissolution of P granules at the negatively supersaturated anterior, and condensation of P granules at the positively supersaturated posterior ( Brangwynne et al., 2009 ). But, when PGL-3 concentration is sufficiently high, there will exist a state of positive supersaturation throughout the length of the AP axis. This effect will prevent rapid dissolution of P granules at the anterior. Slower segregation of P granules will take place because the MEX-5/6 gradient is still in place, which will create a gradient of positive supersaturation along the AP axis. This means that Ostwald ripening should segregate P granules to the posterior, but this will be at a much slower rate than in wild-type embryos. For the same reasons, P granules should also require more and more time to segregate to the posterior as the concentration of mRNA in the embryo is gradually increased to a point where most MEX-5/6 is bound to mRNA.

The formation of a MEX-5 gradient has been suggested to result from phosphorylated and dephosphorylated species of MEX-5 with different diffusion coefficients ( Daniels et al., 2010 ; Griffin et al., 2011 ; Tenlen et al., 2008 ). In the presence of phosphorylation gradient, this can lead to an overall MEX-5 concentration gradient. The phosphorylation gradient is thought to depend on the kinase PAR-1, which concentrates at the posterior cortex ( Griffin et al., 2011 ; Tenlen et al., 2008 ). Because we have not studied the formation of the MEX-5 gradient in this paper, we have simplified the formation of a MEX-5 gradient by introducing a source and a sink. However studying the interplay between the physical and biochemical mechanisms of MEX-5 gradient formation and the phase separation of P granules will be a fascinating topic for future experiments and theory.

One obvious question is why segregation of P granules to the posterior of the embryo depends mainly on MEX-5/6 rather than the numerous other RNA binding proteins in the cell? We can distinguish two types of RNA-binding proteins, those that are distributed in gradients, and those that do not form a gradient. Following polarity establishment, MEX-5 and MEX-6 concentrate in the anterior. In turn, this gradient of MEX-5/6 distributes the RNA-binding proteins PIE-1, POS-1 and MEX-1 asymmetrically to form gradients with highest concentration in the posterior ( Griffin, 2015 ). These posterior-enriched proteins are present at overall concentrations smaller or comparable to MEX-5/6 ( Table S1 ), and the steepness of the gradient of posterior-enriched proteins is similar to that of MEX-5 ( Griffin et al., 2011 ; Wu et al., 2015 ). Two lines of evidence explain why MEX-5/6 can dissolve P granules at the anterior, while PIE-1/POS-1/MEX-1 fails to inhibit P granule assembly at the posterior facilitating P granule segregation. First, MEX-5/6 most likely binds mRNA molecules with significantly higher affinity compared to PIE-1, POS-1, MEX-1 or PGL-3; MEX-5 and MEX-6 binds mRNA with >10 fold higher affinity compared to POS-1 ( Farley et al., 2008 ; Pagano et al., 2007 ) and PGL-3 (this study). Second, MEX-5/6 and PGL-3 most likely binds many more mRNA molecules in cells compared to PIE-1, POS-1 or MEX-1. MEX-5 recognizes any 8-nucleotide long stretch with six to eight uridines ( Pagano et al., 2007 ), and our study shows that PGL-3 can bind mRNA with low sequence specificity. On the other hand, the RNA sequence requirement for POS-1 binding is more stringent ( Farley et al., 2008 ). Bioinformatic analysis suggests that while 3′ UTR of only 28% of C. elegans mRNA contain binding sequences for POS-1, >90% of C. elegans mRNA contain binding sequences for MEX-5 ( Farley et al., 2008 ; Pagano et al., 2007 ). Therefore we propose that at the anterior, MEX-5 binds most cellular mRNA with significantly higher affinity compared to PGL-3 resulting in P granule dissolution. The posterior-enriched POS-1 cannot inhibit mRNA-dependent P granule assembly, because POS-1 can only bind to a small fraction of the mRNA, keeping most mRNA available to drive PGL-3 drop formation.

Many RNA-binding proteins in cells do not form an anterior-posterior concentration gradient. These non-gradient-forming RNA binding proteins may also compete with PGL-3 for some mRNA molecules required for P granule assembly. Therefore, the gradients of MEX-5/6 must drive P granule segregation within a background of non-gradient-forming RNA binding proteins. This background effectively provides a buffer for mRNA molecules. We speculate that P granule segregation is successful in spite of this buffer for mRNA molecules because the buffering capacity is low, or it is slow compared to the timescale of P granule segregation. Although we considered adding an mRNA buffer to our model, neither the binding rates and constants, nor the specificity of most of these RNA-binding proteins are known. Future work creating buffers with complex mixtures of RNA binding proteins will be required to resolve these questions.

The experiments in this paper are underpinned by measurement of in vivo concentrations of proteins and mRNAs. One important measurement is the amount of mRNA- too high and competition would be irrelevant. We estimated the amount of mRNA in the two-cell stage C. elegans embryos at ~2,000,000 transcripts from published transcriptome-level RNA-seq data ( Osborne Nishimura et al., 2015 ). While we used smFISH-based linear regression to calibrate the published RNA-seq data, an independent study used an alternate approach of calibration using spike-in control RNA probes ( Tintori et al., 2016 ). Our estimate of the amount of mRNA transcripts is close to the findings of this independent study. Further, our estimates are similar to measurements in other systems: 50,000 – 300,000 mRNA transcripts in a human lymphoblastoid cell line estimated using RNA-seq data calibrated using spike-in control RNA probes ( Marinov et al., 2014 ); 505,000 mRNA transcripts in a mouse embryonic fibroblast estimated using microfluidics and SMRT-seq technology ( Islam et al., 2011 ).

Our work has concentrated on phase separation of PGL-3 into liquid drops in vitro. PGL-3 drops have remarkably similar biophysical properties to P granules in vivo in spite of a simpler composition compared to P granules. However, the organization of P granules in vivo is likely to be more complicated than our in vitro system. Over forty proteins localize in P granules ( Updike and Strome, 2010 ). We do not know why there is such varied molecular composition. However we can distinguish ‘scaffold’ proteins that assemble P granules from ‘clients’ that partition into the P granules transiently to mediate biochemical reactions. In addition to PGL-3, other proteins including PGL-1, GLH-1, DEPS-1, LAF-1 and the MEG proteins are known to be required in part for P granule assembly ( Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015 ; Hanazawa et al., 2011 ; Kawasaki et al., 1998 ; Spike et al., 2008 ; Updike and Strome, 2010 ; Updike et al., 2011 ; Wang et al., 2014 ). More work is required to understand the individual contributions of these different proteins to P granule segregation, but it is likely that they cooperate together to form P granules. For instance, the MEG proteins and the PGL proteins depend on each other for P granule assembly ( Wang et al., 2014 ), and LAF-1 has been shown to assemble P granule-like drops in vitro ( Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015 ). We speculate that all of these proteins bind mRNA, and therefore the MEX-5-dependent competition mechanism we have identified could drive segregation of all these components into P granules at the posterior of the embryo.

Segregation of P granules in C. elegans embryos has long been a topic of fascination since 1982, when they were first identified by antibody staining ( Strome and Wood, 1982 ). The observation that P granules were liquids in 2009 suggested that non-membrane-bound compartments could form by phase separation ( Brangwynne et al., 2009 ). The subsequent discovery that many other compartments are liquid-like and form by phase separation ( Brangwynne et al., 2011 ; Strzelecka et al., 2010 ; Wippich et al., 2013 ) suggests a picture of the cell cytoplasm as a complex chemically active emulsion. However the cytoplasm is likely to be more complicated than a conventional emulsion, because many liquid phases coexist in the same system. If there are many compartments, the droplets are far from global equilibrium, because they are chemical micro-reactors that localize specific sets of biochemical reactions. We have not invoked any active processes for formation of P granules because in vitro they form by conventional phase separation. We do not know if active processes contribute to their formation in vivo, but the remarkable similarities between the properties of P granules in vivo and PGL-3 drops in vitro suggest that conventional phase separation may dominate.

Our findings support the idea from other studies ( Hanazawa et al., 2011 ; Li et al., 2012 ; Lin et al., 2015 ; Su et al., 2016 ), that many of the non-membrane-bound compartments in cells e.g. centrosomes, nucleoli, PML bodies, P bodies, P granules, stress granules are assembled by only one or a few key proteins. Many of these compartments have been shown to be regulated by RNA ( Berry et al., 2015 ; Burke et al., 2015 ; Lin et al., 2015 ; Molliex et al., 2015 ; Zhang et al., 2015 ), suggesting that the interplay between RNA binding, and a few scaffold proteins is important for their regulation. Our experiments suggesting that competition for RNA between different proteins can be used to organize the distribution of non-membrane-bound compartments provides a powerful mechanism of spatially organizing the cytoplasm.
