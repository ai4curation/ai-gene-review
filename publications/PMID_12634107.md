Cytokines and growth factors play important roles in mammalian ocular 
development and maintenance. Recent studies have indicated that some of these 
ligands can activate signal transducer and activator of transcription factors 
(STATs) and modulate gene transcription. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the expression and activation of STAT proteins in the developing 
mouse retina. Anti-STAT and anti-phosphorylated STAT antibodies were used to 
detect the expression and activation of STATs in embryonic and postnatal 
neuronal retina, ciliary margin, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In situ 
hybridization and Western blot were also employed. In embryonic stages, all STAT 
proteins were expressed in the neuronal retina in distinct cell populations at 
different embryonic stages. For example, Stat3 expression and activation 
gradually increased in the inner neuroblast layer and ciliary margin during 
development. In adult retina, Stat3 was detected in the inner nuclear layer and 
ganglion cells layers. Stat1 was strongly expressed in both outer and inner 
plexiform layers. Stat5a was clearly expressed in the outer/inner nuclear layer, 
the ganglion cell layer, and the inner plexiform layer. Strong expression of 
Stat3, Stat5a, and Stat6 was observed in the RPE. Activated Stat3 and Stat5a 
were found in the neural retina and the RPE. Distinct STAT proteins were present 
in different cell populations in neuronal retina and RPE suggesting multiple 
functions of STATs in mammalian eye development. Studies of STAT signal pathways 
in the eye may contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanisms in 
control of ocular development and pathogenesis.
