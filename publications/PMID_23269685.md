Type IV P-type ATPases (P4-ATPases) and CDC50 family proteins form a putative 
phospholipid flippase complex that mediates the translocation of 
aminophospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine 
(PE) from the outer to inner leaflets of the plasma membrane. In Chinese hamster 
ovary (CHO) cells, at least eight members of P4-ATPases were identified, but 
only a single CDC50 family protein, CDC50A, was expressed. We demonstrated that 
CDC50A associated with and recruited P4-ATPase ATP8A1 to the plasma membrane. 
Overexpression of CDC50A induced extensive cell spreading and greatly enhanced 
cell migration. Depletion of either CDC50A or ATP8A1 caused a severe defect in 
the formation of membrane ruffles, thereby inhibiting cell migration. Analyses 
of phospholipid translocation at the plasma membrane revealed that the depletion 
of CDC50A inhibited the inward translocation of both PS and PE, whereas the 
depletion of ATP8A1 inhibited the translocation of PE but not that of PS, 
suggesting that the inward translocation of cell-surface PE is involved in cell 
migration. This hypothesis was further examined by using a PE-binding peptide 
and a mutant cell line with defective PE synthesis; either cell-surface 
immobilization of PE by the PE-binding peptide or reduction in the cell-surface 
content of PE inhibited the formation of membrane ruffles, causing a severe 
defect in cell migration. These results indicate that the phospholipid flippase 
complex of ATP8A1 and CDC50A plays a major role in cell migration and suggest 
that the flippase-mediated translocation of PE at the plasma membrane is 
involved in the formation of membrane ruffles to promote cell migration.
