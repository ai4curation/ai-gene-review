Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan involved in a 
wide variety of cellular functions. However, its turnover in living cells 
remains largely unknown. In this study, CD44, a receptor for HA, and 
hyaluronidase-1, -2, and -3 (Hyal-1, -2 and -3) were stably expressed in HEK 293 
cells and the mechanism of HA catabolism was systematically investigated using 
fluorescein-labeled HA. CD44 was essential for HA degradation by both endogenous 
and exogenously expressed hyaluronidases. Hyal-1 was not able to cleave HA in 
living cells in the absence of CD44. Intracellular HA degradation was 
predominantly mediated by Hyal-1 after incorporation of HA by CD44. Although 
Hyal-1 was active only in intracellular space in vivo, a certain amount of the 
enzyme was secreted to extracellular space. This extracellular Hyal-1 was found 
to be incorporated by cells and such uptake of Hyal-1 was, in part, involved in 
the intracellular degradation of HA. Hyal-2 was involved in the extracellular 
degradation of HA. Hyal-2 activity was also dependent on the expression of CD44 
in both living cells and enzyme assays. Immunofluorescent microscopy 
demonstrated that both Hyal-2 and CD44 are present on the cell surface. Without 
CD44 expression, Hyal-2 existed in a granular pattern, and did not show 
hyaluronidase activity, suggesting that localization change could contribute to 
Hyal-2 function. A convenient and quantitative enzyme assay was established for 
the measurement of Hyal-2 activity. Hyal-2 activity was detected in the membrane 
fraction of cells co-expressing Hyal-2 and CD44. The pH optimum for Hyal-2 was 
6.0-7.0. The membrane fraction of cells expressing Hyal-2 alone did not show 
hyaluronidase activity. Hyal-3 did not show any hyaluronidase activity in our 
experimental conditions. Based on these findings, Hyal-1 and -2 contribute to 
intracellular and extracellular catabolism of HA, respectively, in a 
CD44-dependent manner, and their HA degradation occurs independently from one 
another.
