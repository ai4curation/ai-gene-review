Sister chromatid cohesion is essential for proper segregation of the genome in 
mitosis and meiosis. Central to this process is cohesin, a multi-protein complex 
conserved from yeast to human. Previous genetic studies in fungi have identified 
Pds5/BimD/Spo76 as an additional factor implicated in cohesion. Here we describe 
the biochemical and functional characterization of two Pds5-like proteins, Pds5A 
and Pds5B, from vertebrate cells. In HeLa cells, Pds5 proteins physically 
interact with cohesin and associate with chromatin in a cohesin-dependent 
manner. Depletion of the cohesin subunit Scc1 by RNA interference leads to the 
assembly of chromosomes with severe cohesion defects. A similar yet milder set 
of defects is observed in cells with reduced levels of Pds5A or Pds5B. In 
Xenopus egg extracts, mitotic chromosomes assembled in the absence of Pds5A and 
Pds5B display no discernible defects in arm cohesion, but centromeric cohesion 
is apparently loosened. Unexpectedly, these chromosomes retain an unusually high 
level of cohesin. Thus, Pds5 proteins seem to affect the stable maintenance of 
cohesin-mediated cohesion and its efficient dissolution during mitosis. We 
propose that Pds5 proteins play both positive and negative roles in sister 
chromatid cohesion, possibly by directly modulating the dynamic interaction of 
cohesin with chromatin. This idea would explain why cells lacking Pds5 function 
display rather complex and diverse phenotypes in different organisms.
