Acute anemia initiates a systemic response that results in the rapid 
mobilization and differentiation of erythroid progenitors in the adult spleen. 
The flexed-tail (f) mutant mice exhibit normal steady-state erythropoiesis but 
are unable to rapidly respond to acute erythropoietic stress. Here, we show that 
f/f mutant mice have a mutation in Madh5. Our analysis shows that 
BMP4/Madh5-dependent signaling, regulated by hypoxia, initiates the 
differentiation and expansion of erythroid progenitors in the spleen. These 
findings suggest a new model where stress erythroid progenitors, resident in the 
spleen, are poised to respond to changes in the microenvironment induced by 
acute anemia.
