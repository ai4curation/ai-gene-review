Degradation of the M phase cyclins triggers the exit from M phase. Cdc14 is the 
major phosphatase required for the exit from the M phase. One of the functions 
of Cdc14 is to dephosphorylate and activate the Cdh1/APC/C complex, resulting in 
the degradation of the M phase cyclins. However, other crucial targets of Cdc14 
for mitosis and cytokinesis remain to be elucidated. Here we systematically 
analyzed the positions of dephosphorylation sites for Cdc14 in the budding yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Quantitative mass spectrometry identified a total of 
835 dephosphorylation sites on 455 potential Cdc14 substrates in vivo. We 
validated two events, and through functional studies we discovered that 
Cdc14-mediated dephosphorylation of Smc4 and Bud3 is essential for proper 
mitosis and cytokinesis, respectively. These results provide insight into the 
Cdc14-mediated pathways for exiting the M phase.
