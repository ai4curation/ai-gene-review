The regulation of the multifunctional calcium/calmodulin dependent protein 
kinase II (CaMKII) by serine/threonine protein phosphatases has been extensively 
studied in neuronal cells; however, this regulation has not been investigated 
previously in fibroblasts. We cloned a cDNA from SV40-transformed human 
fibroblasts that shares 80% homology to a rat calcium/calmodulin-dependent 
protein kinase phosphatase that encodes a PPM1F protein. By using extracts from 
transfected cells, PPM1F, but not a mutant (R326A) in the conserved catalytic 
domain, was found to dephosphorylate in vitro a peptide corresponding to the 
auto-inhibitory region of CaMKII. Further analyses demonstrated that PPM1F 
specifically dephosphorylates the phospho-Thr-286 in autophosphorylated CaMKII 
substrate and thus deactivates the CaMKII in vitro. Coimmunoprecipitation of 
CaMKII with PPM1F indicates that the two proteins can interact intracellularly. 
Binding of PPM1F to CaMKII involves multiple regions and is not dependent on 
intact phosphatase activity. Furthermore, overexpression of PPM1F in fibroblasts 
caused a reduction in the CaMKII-specific phosphorylation of the known substrate 
vimentin(Ser-82) following induction of the endogenous CaM kinase. These results 
identify PPM1F as a CaM kinase phosphatase within fibroblasts, although it may 
have additional functions intracellularly since it has been presented elsewhere 
as POPX2 and hFEM-2. We conclude that PPM1F, possibly together with the other 
previously described protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, can regulate the 
activity of CaMKII. Moreover, because PPM1F dephosphorylates the critical 
autophosphorylation site of CaMKII, we propose that this phosphatase plays a key 
role in the regulation of the kinase intracellularly.
