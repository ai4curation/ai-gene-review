In somatic cells, untranslated mRNAs accumulate in cytoplasmic foci called 
processing bodies or P-bodies. P-bodies contain complexes that inhibit 
translation and stimulate mRNA deadenylation, decapping, and decay. Recently, 
certain P-body proteins have been found in germ granules, RNA granules specific 
to germ cells. We have investigated a possible connection between P-bodies and 
germ granules in Caenorhabditis elegans. We identify PATR-1, the C. elegans 
homolog of the yeast decapping activator Pat1p, as a unique marker for P-bodies 
in C. elegans embryos. We find that P-bodies are inherited maternally as core 
granules that mature differently in somatic and germline blastomeres. In somatic 
blastomeres, P-bodies recruit the decapping activators LSM-1 and LSM-3. This 
recruitment requires the LET-711/Not1 subunit of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase and 
correlates spatially and temporally with the onset of maternal mRNA degradation. 
In germline blastomeres, P-bodies are maintained as core granules lacking LSM-1 
and LSM-3. P-bodies interact with germ granules, but maintain distinct dynamics 
and components. The maternal mRNA nos-2 is maintained in germ granules, but not 
in P-bodies. We conclude that P-bodies are distinct from germ granules, and 
represent a second class of RNA granules that behaves differently in somatic and 
germline cells.
