Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by 
expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. Transcriptional 
dysregulation has been implicated in HD pathogenesis. Here, we report that 
huntingtin interacts with the transcriptional activator Sp1 and coactivator 
TAFII130. Coexpression of Sp1 and TAFII130 in cultured striatal cells from 
wild-type and HD transgenic mice reverses the transcriptional inhibition of the 
dopamine D2 receptor gene caused by mutant huntingtin, as well as protects 
neurons from huntingtin-induced cellular toxicity. Furthermore, soluble mutant 
huntingtin inhibits Sp1 binding to DNA in postmortem brain tissues of both 
presymptomatic and affected HD patients. Understanding these early molecular 
events in HD may provide an opportunity to interfere with the effects of mutant 
huntingtin before the development of disease symptoms.
