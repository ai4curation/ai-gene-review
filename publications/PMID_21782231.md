In response to viral infection, RIG-I-like RNA helicases bind to viral RNA and 
activate the mitochondrial protein MAVS, which in turn activates the 
transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB to induce type I interferons. [corrected] 
We have previously shown that RIG-I binds to unanchored lysine-63 (K63) 
polyubiquitin chains and that this binding is important for MAVS activation; 
however, the mechanism underlying MAVS activation is not understood. Here, we 
show that viral infection induces the formation of very large MAVS aggregates, 
which potently activate IRF3 in the cytosol. We find that a fraction of 
recombinant MAVS protein forms fibrils that are capable of activating IRF3. 
Remarkably, the MAVS fibrils behave like prions and effectively convert 
endogenous MAVS into functional aggregates. We also show that, in the presence 
of K63 ubiquitin chains, RIG-I catalyzes the conversion of MAVS on the 
mitochondrial membrane to prion-like aggregates. These results suggest that a 
prion-like conformational switch of MAVS activates and propagates the antiviral 
signaling cascade.

INTRODUCTION

Innate immunity is an evolutionarily conserved defense mechanism against microbial infections ( Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2010 ; Ronald and Beutler, 2010 ; Takeuchi and Akira, 2010 ). In higher organisms, an antiviral innate immune response is triggered by the recognition of viral nucleic acids by germline-encoded pathogen recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) ( Barbalat et al., 2010 ; Rehwinkel and Reis e Sousa, 2010 ). Several TLRs, including TLR3, 7, 8 and 9, detect viral RNA and DNA in the endosome, whereas RLRs bind to viral RNA in the cytoplasm. Both TLR and RLR pathways activate signaling cascades that lead to the production of an arsenal of effector molecules that suppress viral replication and assembly. Prominent among the antiviral molecules are type-I interferons, including IFNα and IFNβ, which activate the JAK-STAT pathway to fight viral infection.

RLRs comprise RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2, all of which contain an RNA helicase domain ( Yoneyama and Fujita, 2009 ; Yoneyama et al., 2004 ). RIG-I also contains a C-terminal regulatory domain (RD) that binds to viral RNA harboring 5′-triphosphate (5′-pppRNA)( Hornung et al., 2006 ; Pichlmair et al., 2006 ). RIG-I and MDA5 detect distinct classes of RNA viruses ( Kato et al., 2006 ). Both RIG-I and MDA5 contain two CARD domains in tandem at the N-terminus, whereas LGP2 lacks the CARD domains. The binding of viral RNA to the C-termini of RIG-I and MDA5 presumably induces a conformational change that exposes the N-terminal CARD domain, which interacts with the CARD domain of the mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS (also known as IPS1, VISA or CARDIF) ( Kawai et al., 2005 ; Meylan et al., 2005 ; Seth et al., 2005 ; Xu et al., 2005 ). MAVS then activates the cytosolic kinases IKK and TBK1, which activate the transcription factors NF-κB and IRF3, respectively. NF-κB and IRF3 translocate into the nucleus, where they function cooperatively to induce type-I interferons and other antiviral molecules ( McWhirter et al., 2005 ).

To understand the mechanism of signal transduction in the RIG-I pathway, we have recently established a cell-free system in which viral RNA triggers the activation of IRF3 and IKK in cytosolic extracts in the presence of mitochondria ( Zeng et al., 2010 ). Using this system, we discovered that the CARD domains of RIG-I bind to unanchored K63 polyubiquitin chains, and that this binding is important for RIG-I activation. The binding of full-length RIG-I to ubiquitin chains depends on ATP and 5′-pppRNA, suggesting that RIG-I activation involves sequential binding of viral RNA and unanchored K63 polyubiquitin chains to RIG-I RD and CARDs, respectively. We have also shown that mitochondria isolated from virus-infected cells can activate IKK and TBK1 in the cytoplasm, and that this activity depends on MAVS on the mitochondrial membrane ( Zeng et al., 2009 ). Interestingly, K63 polyubiquitination also plays an important role in TBK1 activation by MAVS.

The mechanism by which MAVS is activated by RIG-I and ubiquitin chains is still not understood. The nature of the active form of MAVS has also remained a mystery. In this report, we show that MAVS forms very large aggregates after viral infection, and that these aggregates are highly potent in activating IRF3 in the cytoplasm. Remarkably, these aggregates form self-perpetuating fiber-like polymers that can efficiently convert endogenous MAVS into functional aggregates. These properties closely resemble prions, which are infectious protein conformations found in pathological as well as physiological conditions ( Chien et al., 2004 ; Halfmann and Lindquist, 2010 ; Tuite and Serio, 2010). Initially found to be the causative agent of fatal neurological diseases ( Prusiner, 1998 ), including Scrapies in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or “mad cow disease”) in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) in human, the prion PrP is the founding member of a growing list of proteins that can form self-perpetuating aggregates, several of which have evolved to serve physiological functions. For example, several prions in fungi regulate phenotypic switches that may confer selectable advantages ( Halfmann and Lindquist, 2010 ). Thus, the prion-based conformational switch can be a robust epigenetic mechanism that regulates protein functions and cellular phenotypes. Properties of prions include fibrous aggregates, resistance to detergent and protease, and most importantly, the ability to infect the endogenous protein and convert the native conformation into fibrous aggregates. Strikingly, MAVS possesses all of these prion-like properties. The formation of MAVS aggregates leads to a gain of function, and the conformational switch is highly efficient and tightly regulated by viral infection. Also quite remarkably, in vitro incubation of RIG-I and mitochondria in the presence of K63 polyubiquitin chains efficiently converts endogenous MAVS into functional aggregates.

DISCUSSION

We have previously shown that MAVS becomes more resistant to extraction with detergent from the mitochondrial membrane after viral infection ( Seth et al., 2005 ). Recent microscopy studies show that MAVS redistributes in the mitochondria to form speckle-like aggregates in cells in response to viral infection ( Onoguchi et al., 2010 ). In this report, we show that viral infection induces the formation of very large MAVS aggregates on the mitochondrial membrane. Importantly, we provide direct biochemical evidence that these aggregates are highly potent in activating IRF3 in cytosolic extracts. Furthermore, the aggregation of MAVS could be robustly induced in vitro by incubation of mitochondria with RIG-I and K63 ubiquitin chains. Most remarkably, our new data reveal that the CARD domains of MAVS form protease-resistant prion-like fibrils, which effectively convert endogenous MAVS on the mitochondria into functional aggregates. Based on these results and other published data, we propose a model of MAVS activation that involves the following steps ( Figure 7 ): 1) RIG-I binds to viral RNA through the C-terminal RD domain and the helicase domain; 2) RIG-I hydrolyzes ATP, undergoes a conformational change and forms a dimer that exposes the N-terminal CARD domains; 3) the CARD domains recruit TRIM25 and other ubiquitination enzymes to synthesize unanchored K63 polyubiquitin chains, which bind to the CARD domains; 4) the ubiquitin-bound CARD domains of RIG-I interact with the CARD domain of MAVS, which is anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane through its C-terminal TM domain; 5) the CARD domain of MAVS rapidly forms prion-like aggregates, which convert other MAVS molecules into aggregates in a highly processive manner; 6) the large MAVS aggregates interact with cytosolic signaling proteins, such as TRAFs, resulting in the activation of IKK and TBK1.

Prions are self-propagating protein aggregates best known for causing fatal neurodegenerative diseases ( Prusiner, 1998 ). However, accumulating evidence through studies in fungi and other organisms suggests that prion-catalyzed conformational switches can regulate phenotypes in a way that is not detrimental, and in some cases beneficial, to a cell or organism ( Halfmann and Lindquist, 2010 ; Tuite and Serio, 2010). A recent example of beneficial prions is provided by the invertebrate Aplysia translation regulator CPEB, which forms self-sustaining polymers that contribute to long-term facilitation in sensory neurons ( Si et al., 2010 ; Si et al., 2003 ). Our finding that MAVS forms highly active, self-perpetuating fiber-like polymers provides another example of beneficial prions, in this case regulating mammalian antiviral immune defense.

MAVS shares many hallmarks of a prion, including: a) the ability to infect the endogenous protein and convert it into the aggregate forms; b) the formation of fiber-like polymers; c) resistance to protease digestion; d) resistance to detergent solubilization. Surprisingly, although endogenous MAVS aggregates from virus-stimulated cells were resistant to 2% SDS as analyzed by SDD-AGE, these aggregates were sensitive to treatment with reducing agents such as DTT, suggesting disulfide bond formation within functional MAVS aggregates. Interestingly, disulfide bond formation has also been found in some prions such as PrP ( Stanker et al., 2010 ). However, even after DTT treatment, MAVS still sediments as very large and active particles after sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, suggesting that disulfide bond formation is not essential to maintain the aggregation and activity of MAVS.

It remains to be determined whether MAVS forms one or a few very large aggregates, or the aggregates are broken down to smaller fragments, which then form new “seeds” to multiply the aggregates. It would also be interesting to investigate how cells resolve these mitochondrial aggregates after an immune response is called into motion. Although there is evidence that MAVS is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway ( You et al., 2009 ), other mechanisms such as mitophagy or chaperone-mediated refolding are potentially involved in clearing the MAVS aggregates. Interestingly, we found that geldanamycin and its analog 17-AAG, which was previously known to inhibit IRF3 activation by RNA viruses, block MAVS aggregation. The dose response of the drugs shows an excellent correlation between MAVS aggregation and IRF3 dimerization, suggesting that MAVS aggregation is required for its function. It remains to be determined whether the effect of geldanamycin is due to its inhibition of Hsp90. It is possible that Hsp90 facilitates ordered assembly of the functional MAVS fibers by preventing non-specific aggregation.

Many prions form amyloids consisting predominantly of β-sheets that may be detected with dyes such as Congo red ( Chien et al., 2004 ; Sawaya et al., 2007 ). However, we have been unable to observe staining of MAVS aggregates with Congo red (data not shown). Like the CARD domains of other proteins, MAVS CARD forms a six-helix bundle ( Potter et al., 2008 ). Likewise, other priongenic proteins, such as the native form of PrP (PrPc), form alpha-helical folds before they are converted to the aggregate forms ( Chien et al., 2004 ). Further studies are required to determine the atomic structure of the MAVS fibers and to understand how the fiber structure gains the competence to initiate downstream signaling. Importantly, MAVS fibers, but not PrP fibers, are able to induce endogenous MAVS aggregation, indicating specificity in this conformation-based mechanism of cell signaling.

CARD and CARD-like domains are present in a large variety of proteins, especially those involved in immune defense and cell death ( Park et al., 2007 ). CARD domains are well known to mediate protein-protein interactions, and the CARD domains of RIG-I and MAVS likely mediate the interaction between these proteins. Surprisingly, our studies reveal that the CARD domains of RIG-I and MAVS have additional unique functions. The tandem CARD domains of RIG-I, but not the MAVS CARD, bind specifically to K63 polyubiquitin chains ( Zeng et al., 2010 ). On the other hand, the CARD domain of MAVS, but not those of RIG-I, can form prion-like aggregates. The primary sequences of the CARD domains of RIG-I, MDA5 and MAVS are distantly related to conventional CARD domains found in other proteins. Interestingly, while the CARD domain of MAVS shares very limited sequence homology with those of RIG-I and MDA5, the CARD domains of MAVS from different species have high degrees of sequence homology, and both mouse and human MAVS can form prion-like functional fibers ( Fig. 3 ). Thus, the MAVS CARD domain may have evolved to acquire the propensity to form prion-like aggregates, which obviously benefit the host organisms by mounting rigorous antiviral immune defense.

In cells, the CARD domain of MAVS must be appended to the mitochondrial targeting domain (TM) in order to induce IRF3 activation ( Seth et al., 2005 ). In fact, overexpression of mini-MAVS that contains only the CARD and TM domains is sufficient to activate IRF3 and induce IFNβ in cells ( Seth et al., 2005 ); Figure S4F ). The importance of the mitochondrial localization of MAVS is underscored by the fact that hepatitis C virus employs the viral protease NS3/4A to cleave MAVS off the mitochondrial membrane, thereby suppressing type-I interferon production ( Li et al., 2005 ; Meylan et al., 2005 ). Surprisingly, we found that recombinant MAVS lacking the TM domain (MAVSΔTM) could activate IRF3 when it is incubated with cytosolic extracts. Even a fragment containing only the CARD domain of MAVS is sufficient to form aggregates in vitro. The CARD domain aggregates can also activate IRF3 in the cytosol, but in this case the activity requires intact mitochondria containing endogenous MAVS ( Fig. 4D–F ). These biochemical results are consistent with our new finding that the induction of IFNβ by mini-MAVS in cells requires endogenous MAVS ( Supplementary Fig. S4F ). Taken together, our results suggest that the CARD domain of MAVS mediates aggregation, whereas the intervening sequence between CARD and TM domains is important for recruiting cytosolic signaling proteins to activate IKK and TBK1.

While the vast majority of MAVS is located on the mitochondrial membrane, a very small fraction of MAVS is located on the peroxisomal membrane ( Dixit et al., 2010 ). When MAVS was engineered to express predominantly on peroxisomal membrane, it failed to induce type-I interferons, but could still induce some antiviral genes such as viperin to inhibit viral infection through an interferon-independent mechanism. Our crude mitochondrial preparation likely contains peroxisomes, raising the interesting possibility that a small fraction of MAVS that is located on the peroxisomal membrane may also form aggregates to induce viperin and other antiviral molecules.

Although overexpression of MAVS in cells is sufficient to cause its aggregation and induce type-I interferons, the aggregation and activation of endogenous MAVS is tightly regulated by viral infection. We found that viral infection causes almost complete conversion of endogenous full length MAVS into the aggregate forms. Such a highly efficient aggregation of MAVS can be reproduced in vitro by a simple incubation of mitochondria, RIG-I CARD domains and K63-Ub4. Moreover, endogenous MAVS rapidly aggregates upon exposure of the mitochondria to the fibers consisting of MAVS CARD domain. These results suggest an amplification cascade in which the RIG-I:Ub chain complex causes some MAVS molecules to form aggregates, which then function as prion-like “seeds” to convert other MAVS molecules to form aggregates. Indeed, we found that sub-stoichiometric amounts of K63-Ub4 and the MAVS CARD fibrils could cause almost complete conversion of endogenous MAVS into functional aggregates within 30 minutes in vitro, suggesting that the RIG-I:Ub chain complex and MAVS fibrils function like catalysts. This is consistent with our previous estimate that less than 20 molecules of viral RNA and K63 ubiquitin chains in a cell are sufficient to cause detectable IRF3 activation ( Zeng et al., 2010 ). Thus, the RIG-I pathway appears to be highly sensitive to viral infection. Our finding of the prion-like conformational switch of MAVS provides a mechanism underlying this ultrasensitive and robust antiviral response.
