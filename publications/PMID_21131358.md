Retinoids are promising agents for the treatment/prevention of breast carcinoma. 
We examined the role of microRNAs in mediating the effects of all-trans-retinoic 
acid (ATRA), which suppresses the proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive 
(ERα(+)) breast carcinoma cells, such as MCF-7, but not estrogen 
receptor-negative cells, such as MDA-MB-231. We found that pro-oncogenic miR-21 
is selectively induced by ATRA in ERα(+) cells. Induction of miR-21 counteracts 
the anti-proliferative action of ATRA but has the potentially beneficial effect 
of reducing cell motility. In ERα(+) cells, retinoid-dependent induction of 
miR-21 is due to increased transcription of the MIR21 gene via ligand-dependent 
activation of the nuclear retinoid receptor, RARα. RARα is part of the 
transcription complex present in the 5'-flanking region of the MIR21 gene. The 
receptor binds to two functional retinoic acid-responsive elements mapping 
upstream of the transcription initiation site. Silencing of miR-21 enhances 
ATRA-dependent growth inhibition and senescence while reverting suppression of 
cell motility afforded by the retinoid. Up-regulation of miR-21 results in 
retinoid-dependent inhibition of the established target, maspin. Knockdown and 
overexpression of maspin in MCF-7 cells indicates that the protein is involved 
in ATRA-induced growth inhibition and contributes to the ATRA-dependent 
anti-motility responses. Integration between whole genome analysis of genes 
differentially regulated by ATRA in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, prediction of 
miR-21 regulated genes, and functional studies led to the identification of 
three novel direct miR-21 targets: the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1B, the 
adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and PLAT, the tissue-type plasminogen activator. 
Evidence for ICAM-1 involvement in retinoid-dependent inhibition of MCF-7 cell 
motility is provided.
