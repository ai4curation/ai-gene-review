Thymopoietins (TMPOs, previously abbreviated TPs) alpha (75 kDa), beta (51 kDa), 
and gamma (39 kDa) are related nuclear proteins expressed in many or all 
tissues. TMPO alpha is present diffusely throughout the nucleus, while TMPOs 
beta and gamma are localized to the nuclear membrane. Here we report the cloning 
and analysis of a single TMPO gene encoding TMPOs alpha, beta, and gamma, which 
are produced by alternative mRNA splicing, as previously inferred from cDNA 
sequences. The eight exons of the TMPO gene are spread over approximately 35 kb. 
Exon 4, which is spliced into TMPO alpha mRNA, contains sequences that encode a 
putative basic nuclear localization motif. Exon 8, which is spliced into TMPO 
beta and gamma mRNAs, encodes a hydrophobic putative membrane-spanning domain 
that is thought to target TMPOs beta and gamma to the nuclear membrane. TMPO 
beta appears to be the human homologue of the recently described rat protein 
LAP2 (lamina-associated polypeptide 2), which is thought to play an important 
role in the regulation of nuclear architecture by binding lamin B1 and 
chromosomes in a manner regulated by phosphorylation during mitosis (K. Furukawa 
and L. Gerace, La Jolla, pers. comm., 22 Nov. 1994). The human TMPO gene maps to 
chromosome band 12q22.
