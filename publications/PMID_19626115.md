MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene 
expression, involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes. 
Although miRNAs can function as both tumour suppressors and oncogenes in tumour 
development, a widespread downregulation of miRNAs is commonly observed in human 
cancers and promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. This indicates 
an inherent significance of small RNAs in tumour suppression. However, the 
connection between tumour suppressor networks and miRNA biogenesis machineries 
has not been investigated in depth. Here we show that a central tumour 
suppressor, p53, enhances the post-transcriptional maturation of several miRNAs 
with growth-suppressive function, including miR-16-1, miR-143 and miR-145, in 
response to DNA damage. In HCT116 cells and human diploid fibroblasts, p53 
interacts with the Drosha processing complex through the association with 
DEAD-box RNA helicase p68 (also known as DDX5) and facilitates the processing of 
primary miRNAs to precursor miRNAs. We also found that transcriptionally 
inactive p53 mutants interfere with a functional assembly between Drosha complex 
and p68, leading to attenuation of miRNA processing activity. These findings 
suggest that transcription-independent modulation of miRNA biogenesis is 
intrinsically embedded in a tumour suppressive program governed by p53. Our 
study reveals a previously unrecognized function of p53 in miRNA processing, 
which may underlie key aspects of cancer biology.
