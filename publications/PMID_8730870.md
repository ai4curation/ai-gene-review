A search was performed for a periplasmic molecular chaperone which may assist 
outer membrane proteins of Escherichia coli on their way from the cytoplasmic to 
the outer membrane. Proteins of the periplasmic space were fractionated on an 
affinity column with sepharose-bound outer membrane porin OmpF. A 17 kDa 
polypeptide was the predominant protein retained by this column. The 
corresponding gene was found in a gene bank; it encodes the periplasmic protein 
Skp. The protein was isolated and it could be demonstrated that it bound outer 
membrane proteins, following SDS-PAGE, with high selectivity. Among these were 
OmpA, OmpC, OmpF and the maltoporin LamB. The chromosomal skp gene was 
inactivated by a deletion causing removal of most of the signal peptide plus 107 
residues of the 141-residue mature protein. The mutant was viable but possessed 
much-reduced concentrations of outer membrane proteins. This defect was fully 
restored by a plasmid-borne skp gene which may serve as a periplasmic chaperone.
