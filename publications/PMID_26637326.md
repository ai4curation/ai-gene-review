Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, which is 
caused by the expression and aggregation of polyQ-expanded mutant huntingtin 
protein (mtHTT). While toxic mtHTT aggregates are primarily eliminated through 
autophagy, autophagy dysfunction is often observed in HD pathogenesis. Here, we 
show that ectodermal-neural cortex 1 (ENC1), a novel binding partner of 
sequestosome 1 (p62), negatively regulates autophagy under endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) stress. We found that ER stress significantly increases the expression of 
ENC1 via inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)-TNF receptor-associated factor 2 
(TRAF2)-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Ectopic expression of ENC1 alone 
induces the accumulation of detergent-resistant mtHTT aggregates and 
downregulation of ENC1 alleviates ER stress-induced mtHTT aggregation. 
Simultaneously, ER stress-induced impairment of autophagy flux is ameliorated by 
downregulation of ENC1. From immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemical assays, 
we found that ENC1 binds to p62 through its BTB and C-terminal Kelch (BACK) 
domain and this interaction is enhanced under ER stress. In particular, ENC1 
preferentially interacts with the phosphorylated p62 at Ser403 during ER stress. 
Interestingly, ENC1 colocalizes with mtHTT aggregates and its C-terminal Kelch 
domain is required for interfering with the access of p62 to ubiquitinated mtHTT 
aggregates, thus inhibiting cargo recognition of p62. Accordingly, knockdown of 
ENC1 expression enhances colocalization of p62 with mtHTT aggregates. 
Consequently, ENC1 knockdown relieves death of neuronal cells expressing mtHTT 
under ER stress. These results suggest that ENC1 interacts with the 
phosphorylated p62 to impair autophagic degradation of mtHTT aggregates and 
affects cargo recognition failure under ER stress, leading to the accumulation 
and neurotoxicity of mtHTT aggregates.
