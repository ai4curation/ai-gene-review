Eukaryotic GCN5 acetyltransferases influence diverse biological processes by 
acetylating histones and non-histone proteins and regulating chromatin and 
gene-specific transcription as part of multiprotein complexes. In lower 
eukaryotes and invertebrates, these complexes include the yeast ADA complex that 
is still incompletely understood; the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetylase) complexes 
from yeast to Drosophila that are mostly coactivators; and the ATAC (Ada Two-A 
containing) complex, only known in Drosophila and still poorly characterized. In 
contrast, vertebrate organisms, express two paralogous GCN5-like 
acetyltransferases (GCN5 and PCAF), which have been found so far only in 
SAGA-type complexes referred to hereafter as the STAGA (SPT3-TAF9-GCN5/PCAF 
acetylase) complexes. We now report the purification and characterization of 
vertebrate (human) ATAC-type complexes and identify novel components of STAGA. 
We show that human ATAC complexes incorporate in addition to GCN5 or PCAF 
(GCN5/PCAF), other epigenetic coregulators (ADA2-A, ADA3, STAF36, and WDR5), 
cofactors of chromatin assembly/remodeling and DNA replication machineries 
(POLE3/CHRAC17 and POLE4), the stress- and TGFbeta-activated protein kinase 
(TAK1/MAP3K7) and MAP3-kinase regulator (MBIP), additional cofactors of unknown 
function, and a novel YEATS2-NC2beta histone fold module that interacts with the 
TATA-binding protein (TBP) and negatively regulates transcription when recruited 
to a promoter. We further identify the p38 kinase-interacting protein 
(p38IP/FAM48A) as a novel component of STAGA with distant similarity to yeast 
Spt20. These results suggest that vertebrate ATAC-type and STAGA-type complexes 
link specific extracellular signals to modification of chromatin structure and 
regulation of the basal transcription machinery.

Abstract

Eukaryotic GCN5 acetyltransferases influence diverse biological processes
 by acetylating histones and non-histone proteins and regulating chromatin and
 gene-specific transcription as part of multiprotein complexes. In lower
 eukaryotes and invertebrates, these complexes include the yeast ADA complex
 that is still incompletely understood; the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetylase)
 complexes from yeast to Drosophila that are mostly coactivators; and
 the ATAC (Ada Two-A containing) complex, only known in Drosophila and
 still poorly characterized. In contrast, vertebrate organisms, express two
 paralogous GCN5-like acetyltransferases (GCN5 and PCAF), which have been found
 so far only in SAGA-type complexes referred to hereafter as the STAGA
 (SPT3-TAF9-GCN5/PCAF acetylase) complexes. We now report the purification and
 characterization of vertebrate (human) ATAC-type complexes and identify novel
 components of STAGA. We show that human ATAC complexes incorporate in addition
 to GCN5 or PCAF (GCN5/PCAF), other epigenetic coregulators (ADA2-A, ADA3,
 STAF36, and WDR5), cofactors of chromatin assembly/remodeling and DNA
 replication machineries (POLE3/CHRAC17 and POLE4), the stress- and
 TGFβ-activated protein kinase (TAK1/MAP3K7) and MAP3-kinase regulator
 (MBIP), additional cofactors of unknown function, and a novel YEATS2-NC2β
 histone fold module that interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and
 negatively regulates transcription when recruited to a promoter. We further
 identify the p38 kinase-interacting protein (p38IP/FAM48A) as a novel
 component of STAGA with distant similarity to yeast Spt20. These results
 suggest that vertebrate ATAC-type and STAGA-type complexes link specific
 extracellular signals to modification of chromatin structure and regulation of
 the basal transcription machinery.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A Novel Human GCN5/PCAF Complex (ATAC) Distinct from
 STAGA —To identify novel human GCN5-associated factors, nuclear
 extracts from a HeLa S3 cell line that stably expresses Flag-tagged GCN5-L
 “long form” (Flag-GCN5) were fractionated successively on
 anti-FLAG M2-agarose and S-Sepharose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver
 staining ( Fig. 1 A ). A
 ∼160-kDa protein (p160) was detected in Flag-GCN5 complexes ( lanes
 2 and 3 ) but not in Flag-SPT3/STAGA complexes ( lane 1 ).
 Mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses identified p160 as the human
 “YEATS domain containing 2” (YEATS2) protein, a protein of unknown
 function containing a “YEATS” (YNK7-ENL-AF9-TFIIF Small subunit)
 domain near its N terminus. The functions of YEATS domains are still unknown.
 YEATS2 also contains at its C terminus a histone fold domain
 ( Fig. 1 A and
 supplemental Fig. S1), which is 41% similar (24% identical) to that of the
 NC2α/DRAP1 subunit of NC2
 ( 29 – 31 ).

To determine whether YEATS2 and GCN5 are part of a novel complex, a cell
 line expressing Flag-tagged YEATS2 (Flag-YEATS2) was established. Purified
 Flag-YEATS2 and Flag-GCN5 complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stably
 associated proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS. Parallel mock (control)
 purification and LC-MS/MS analyses were performed from parental cells that do
 not express any Flag-tagged protein. We identified 14 different
 Flag-YEATS2-associated proteins, including GCN5 and PCAF, most of which
 (except for PCAF and POLE3/E4) were also detected by LC-MS/MS in Flag-GCN5
 complexes ( Fig. 1 B ).
 Thus, Flag-YEATS2 complexes incorporate either GCN5 or PCAF. The composition
 of YEATS2-GCN5/PCAF complexes indicates that they are distinct from human
 STAGA, but similar to Drosophila ATAC, and will therefore be referred
 to as human ATAC. In addition, LC-MS/MS confirmed the association of Flag-GCN5
 with most currently known STAGA subunits (data not shown), and further
 identified a new STAGA-specific component: the p38 kinase-interacting protein
 FAM48A/p38IP (supplemental Fig. S2 and see below). Mouse and human
 FAM48A/p38IP (and its relative FAM48B1) have sequence similarities to the
 yeast SAGA subunit Spt20 (supplemental Fig. S2) and may represent the elusive
 Spt20-like component(s) of mammalian STAGA complexes. Both FAM48A/p38IP and
 GCN5 have been associated with neural tube closure during early mouse
 development ( 32 , 33 ), suggesting a possible
 role of STAGA in this process; in addition, FAM48A/p38IP, via its interaction
 with the stress-activated p38 kinases
 ( 33 ), might link STAGA to
 regulation of specific stress-responsive genes, a known function of SAGA in
 yeast ( 4 , 34 ).

Human ATAC complexes ( Fig.
 1 B ) contain the GCN5 (or PCAF) acetyltransferase and
 share with STAGA two other subunits: ADA3 and the STAF36 homolog of yeast
 Sgf29 ( 10 , 18 , 21 ). The other components are:
 ADA2-A; YEATS2, which is further characterized hereafter and is a homolog of Drosophila D12; ZZZ3 (zinc finger, ZZ-type-containing 3) a SANT
 domain and zinc finger-containing protein of unknown function with 30%
 sequence identity in its C-terminal-half with Drosophila ATAC1 (data
 not shown); UBAP2L (ubiquitin-associated protein 2-like), a protein of unknown
 function containing a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain; CSRP2BP (CSRP2
 binding protein), a putative GCN5-related N -acetyltransferase (GNAT)
 similar (overall 32% identity, data not shown) to Drosophila ATAC2
 ( 7 ); MAP3K7/TAK1, a MAPK kinase
 kinase (MAP3K) that is activated by TGFβ and a variety of other stimuli,
 and enters the cell nucleus during Wnt-1 signaling
 ( 35 , 36 ); MBIP (MAP3K12/MUK-binding
 inhibitory protein), a MAP3K regulator during osmolarity sensing and stress
 signaling that localizes in either the cytoplasm or nucleus
 ( 37 ) and is similar to the Drosophila ATAC component CG10238 (33% identity in its C-terminal
 half, data not shown); WDR5, a WD-40 repeat protein and component of
 Trithorax/MLL histone H3(K4) methyltransferase complexes
 ( 38 , 39 ); and the histone fold
 protein NC2β/DR1, a subunit of NC2
 ( 29 , 31 ). Peptides for two other
 histone fold proteins: POLE3 (also known as CHRAC17/p17) and POLE4 (p12) were
 identified by LC-MS/MS in Flag-YEATS2 complexes, although not in Flag-GCN5
 complexes ( Fig. 1 B );
 the latter might, however, reflect a lower sensitivity of the LC-MS/MS
 analyses for Flag-GCN5 complexes ( e.g. see peptide counts in Fig. 1 B ). Indeed,
 Western blot analyses indicate that endogenous POLE3 and POLE4 stably interact
 with various ATAC components in HEK293 cells, including YEATS2 and GCN5/PCAF
 (supplemental Fig. S3); in addition, the fly homolog of POLE3 ( i.e. CHRAC14) has been reported recently to be part of Drosophila ATAC
 ( 7 ). POLE3/CHRAC17 was shown
 previously to interact either with POLE4 as part of DNA polymerase ε (Pol
 ε) or with CHRAC15 as part of the chromatin assembly/remodeling complex
 CHRAC ( 40 , 41 ). Our LC-MS/MS analyses,
 however, did not identify other subunits of Pol ε or CHRAC. Thus, the
 POLE3-POLE4 histone fold dimer is shared by ATAC and Pol ε complexes and
 may have DNA- and/or nucleosome-binding functions similar to those reported
 for the POLE3-CHRAC15 histone fold dimer in the CHRAC complex
 ( 40 ).

Western blot analyses were performed to confirm the presence of the
 proteins identified by LC-MS/MS in immunopurified Flag-tagged YEATS2 (ATAC)
 and SPT3 (STAGA) complexes ( Fig.
 1 C ) and in native ATAC and STAGA complexes
 immunoprecipitated under stringent conditions from HEK293 cells
 ( Fig. 1, D and E ). The native ATAC components YEATS2, NC2β, MBIP,
 and WDR5 interacted with each other and with ADA2-A, but not with the
 STAGA-specific subunits FAM48Ap38IP, ADA2-B, or SPT3
 ( Fig. 1 D , lanes
 6–9 ). Conversely, SPT3 associated with STAGA-specific subunits
 (ADA2-B and FAM48A/p38IP) but not with ATAC-specific components (YEATS2,
 ADA2-A, MBIP, WDR5, or NC2β) ( lane 5 ). In contrast, GCN5, PCAF,
 ADA3, and STAF36 were co-immunoprecipitated with both STAGA-specific and
 ATAC-specific components, indicating that they are part of both types of
 complexes. These analyses further confirmed the presence of NC2β, but not
 its histone fold partner NC2α, in human ATAC (see also below).

Notably, endogenous MAP3K7/TAK1 was found stably associated with native
 ATAC complexes in nuclear extracts of HEK293 cells. Indeed, under stringent
 conditions (330 m m KCl, as above) a specific TAK1 antibody
 co-immunoprecipitated GCN5, ADA3, STAF36, and NC2β
 ( Fig. 1 E , lane
 4 ). Note that MAP3K7/TAK1 was not found in STAGA complexes
 ( Fig. 1 C and data not
 shown). The stable association of both MAP3K7/TAK1 and MBIP
 ( Fig. 1, B–E ) is
 intriguing and suggests a possible regulation of ATAC by extracellular
 signals.

In contrast to the above stably associated components, the specific
 interaction of UBAP2L with ATAC was difficult to detect by Western blot in
 either native or FLAG-tagged complexes washed under stringent (330
 m m KCl) conditions ( Fig.
 1 E , lane 3 and data not shown), but was readily
 observed under physiological salt concentrations
 ( Fig. 1 F ), suggesting
 a weaker interaction of UBAP2L with ATAC. Notably, a similar observation was
 made for the USP22 component of STAGA ( Fig.
 1 F and data not shown), which is considered an integral
 subunit of human STAGA ( 10 ).
 Consistent with these results the USP22 homolog in yeast (Ubp8) is part of a
 loosely associated (salt-sensitive) module in yeast SAGA (Ref. 4 and references therein).

Because the HCF cofactor has been found in Drosophila ATAC but not
 SAGA ( 6 ), we tested the
 presence of the homologous HCF-1 in purified human ATAC and STAGA complexes.
 Although HCF-1 was not detected by LC-MS/MS in any of our purified ATAC or
 STAGA preparations, Western blot analyses nevertheless revealed the presence
 of at least some HCF-1 in both Flag affinity-purified complexes
 ( Fig. 1 C ). Because
 HCF-1 is an abundant nuclear cofactor, these results may indicate a
 weak/unstable interaction of HCF-1 with human STAGA and ATAC complexes. Thus,
 HCF-1 could represent a promiscuous adaptor for different chromatin-modifying
 complexes in vertebrates, as proposed previously
 ( 42 ).

Altogether, the above reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirm
 the stable and specific association within native endogenous complexes of most
 of the ATAC subunits identified by LC/MS/MS for which antibodies are currently
 available, with the exception of UBAP2L, which may interact more
 weakly/transiently with ATAC, in a manner perhaps similar to human USP22 and
 yeast Ubp8 in SAGA-type complexes.

YEATS2 Is a Scaffolding Subunit of Human ATAC Complexes and Forms a
 Novel Histone Fold Heterodimer with NC2 β—To verify that
 YEATS2, NC2β, and GCN5 are part of a common high molecular weight complex
 (ATAC) distinct from classical NC2, nuclear extracts from HeLa cells and from
 a derivative cell line expressing Flag-GCN5 were size-fractionated on
 Sephacryl S-400 ( Fig.
 2 A ). NC2β fractionated in both high molecular weight
 (∼1.8 MDa, fractions 60–68) and low molecular weight (∼160 kDa,
 fractions 86–94) complexes. NC2α co-fractionated with NC2β
 only in the low molecular weight complex (fractions 86–94) and an
 NC2β antibody co-immunoprecipitated NC2α (but not GCN5) in these
 fractions, which thus contain the classical NC2 complex
 ( Fig. 2 B ). In
 contrast, YEATS2 co-fractionated with NC2β only in the high molecular
 weight complex ( Fig.
 2 A ) and an antibody to NC2β co-immunoprecipitated
 both YEATS2 and GCN5 in these fractions
 ( Fig. 2 B ); similarly,
 the anti-Flag antibody co-precipitated Flag-GCN5, YEATS2, and NC2β in the
 corresponding fractions from fh:GCN5 cells
 ( Fig. 2 B ). These
 results demonstrate that native YEATS2, GCN5, and NC2β (but not
 NC2α) co-exist in high molecular weight ATAC complexes.

The similarity of the YEATS2 C-terminal histone fold domain to that of
 NC2α suggested that it might interact directly with NC2β. To test
 this and the role of other conserved domains, Flag-YEATS2 mutants lacking the
 N terminus (ΔN), the YEATS domain only (ΔY), or the C-terminal
 histone fold domain (ΔC) were expressed in HEK293 cells,
 immunoprecipitated with the FLAG antibody, and associated factors were
 analyzed by Western blot ( Fig.
 2 C ). Surprisingly, the highly conserved YEATS domain was
 not necessary for YEATS2 interaction with any of the ATAC subunits tested
 ( lane 9 ). In contrast, deletion of the N terminus (including the
 YEATS domain) abolished (or strongly decreased) all interactions except that
 of NC2β ( lane 8 ). Significantly, deletion of the histone fold
 domain abolished the binding of NC2β (as well as MBIP and WDR5) but had
 only a marginal (if any) effect on the interaction of GCN5, ADA3, ADA2-A, and
 STAF36 ( lane 10 ). These results suggest that GCN5, ADA3, ADA2-A, and
 STAF36 may form a module that interacts mostly with YEATS2 sequences
 N-terminal to the YEATS domain, while NC2β requires the C-terminal YEATS2
 histone fold domain. In contrast, MBIP and WDR5 require both the N-terminal
 and C-terminal domains of YEATS2 ( Fig.
 2 D ).

To test whether the histone fold domain of YEATS2 and NC2β interact
 directly, in vitro pull-down assays were performed with recombinant
 Flag-YEATS2 histone fold domain (HFD) and Talon-immobilized
 His 6 -NC2β or His 6 -NC2α. The Flag-YEATS2 HFD
 interacted strongly and specifically with His 6 -NC2β but not
 with His 6 -NC2α ( Fig.
 2 E ). Furthermore, a stable complex containing
 stoichiometric amounts of recombinant His 6 -YEATS2 HFD and
 Flag-NC2β was assembled in Escherichia coli and purified on
 Talon/metal-chelate and anti-FLAG affinity resins (supplemental Fig. S4).
 These results suggest that NC2β incorporates within ATAC via direct
 complementary histone fold interactions with YEATS2. Thus, YEATS2 may function
 as a scaffold within ATAC that tethers a GCN5/PCAF-ADA module at its N
 terminus and forms a stable NC2-like histone fold module at its C
 terminus.

Human ATAC Specifically Acetylates Nucleosomal Histone
 H3 —The histone acetyltransferase activity of purified ATAC was
 analyzed with recombinant histones and native oligonucleosomes. Similar to
 STAGA, human ATAC acetylated preferentially core histone H3 both as
 “free” histone and within purified oligonucleosomes in
 vitro ( Fig. 3, A and B ). Linker histone H1 was not acetylated (data not
 shown). ATAC and STAGA complexes acetylated nucleosomal histone H3 more
 efficiently than recombinant GCN5. Thus, human ATAC under these conditions
 does not acetylate histone H4, despite the fact that one of the subunits
 (CSRP2BP) has a GNAT domain and is similar to Drosophila ATAC2, a
 histone H4-specific HAT
 ( 7 ).

A Negative NC2-like TBP-interacting Function within Human
 ATAC —Because target genes regulated by ATAC are currently unknown,
 we investigated the possible role of ATAC in transcription by expressing the
 YEATS2 subunit in HEK293 cells as a fusion protein with the DNA-binding domain
 of yeast Gal4 ( i.e. GAL4-YEATS2). In transient transfection assays
 GAL4-YEATS2 associated with all ATAC components analyzed, including GCN5,
 ADA3, ADA2-A, STAF36, WDR5, and NC2β (supplemental Fig. S5). However,
 GAL4-YEATS2 did not activate transcription of a reporter gene containing 5
 Gal4 binding sites upstream of a TATA box (data not shown) or upstream of the
 natural HSV TK promoter (G5-TK-Luc) but, instead, repressed the activity of
 G5-TK-Luc in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig.
 4 A ). The repression was promoter-specific, as the
 activity of a co-transfected CMV-β-galactosidase gene (and that of other
 reporters, data not shown) was not inhibited; and was dependent on the Gal4
 sites, since deletion of the Gal4 sites from G5-TK-Luc ( i.e. TK-Luc)
 impaired the repression ( Fig.
 4 A ). A residual inhibition of TK-Luc was observed at high
 concentrations of GAL4-YEATS2, perhaps due to nonspecific binding of the GAL4
 DNA binding domain to this plasmid; consistent with this, TK-Luc was activated
 2–3-fold by a chimeric GAL4-MYC activator (data not shown). Repression
 of G5-TK-Luc by GAL4-YEATS2 required the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, suggesting
 that repression is not due to titration (squelching) of positive cofactors
 ( Fig. 4 B ). Moreover, a
 GAL4-YEATS2 ΔC mutant that lacks the C-terminal histone fold domain
 necessary for interaction with NC2β
 ( Fig. 2 C , and
 supplemental Fig. S5) did not repress G5-TK-Luc
 ( Fig. 4 C ). These
 results indicate that YEATS2 can inhibit transcription when tethered to a
 target promoter in human cells in a manner that depends on its C-terminal
 histone fold domain.

To further address the mechanisms involved, in vitro transcription
 experiments were performed with HeLa nuclear extracts and with purified basal
 transcription factors and RNA polymerase II (purified system). Addition of
 purified Flag-YEATS2 (ATAC) complexes to HeLa nuclear extracts or to the
 purified system did not influence basal transcription from several promoters
 including the G5-TK-Luc and the G5-TATA-INR promoter (data not shown). In
 contrast, GAL4-YEATS2 complexes repressed transcription from the G5-TK-Luc
 template in nuclear extracts and from the core promoter of G5-TATA-INR in the
 purified system ( Fig.
 4 D , lane 2 ). Moreover, efficient repression
 required an intact C-terminal YEATS2 histone fold domain (compare GAL4-YEATS2
 WT and ΔCin lanes 2 and 3 ). We conclude that
 repression occurs at the level of basal transcription and requires the YEATS2
 C-terminal histone fold domain and recruitment to the promoter. We further
 addressed a possible role of YEATS2 in regulation of TBP functions. We found
 by co-immunoprecipitation experiments that Flag-YEATS2 interacts with TBP in
 HEK293 cells ( Fig.
 4 E ). Note that under these conditions Flag-SPT3 did not
 interact with TBP (data not shown). Moreover, the purified recombinant
 YEATS2-HFD/NC2β module was found to directly interact with TBP in
 vitro in a manner similar to the recombinant NC2 (NC2α/NC2β)
 complex ( Fig. 4 F ).
 However, unlike NC2, the YEATS2-HFD/NC2β module alone lacks detectable
 DNA binding activity (by EMSA) and cannot stabilize TBP binding to a TATA box in vitro and, accordingly, does not repress basal transcription from
 several core promoters (data not shown). This is consistent with the fact that
 most of the DNA-contacting residues in the histone fold domain of NC2α
 are not conserved in the YEATS2 HFD (see supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, we
 propose that the YEATS2 C-terminal HFD associates with NC2β to form an
 NC2-like module that can interact with TBP but not (or only weakly) with DNA
 and can repress basal transcription only when recruited to DNA by an
 associated DNA/chromatin-binding domain. It is tempting to speculate that
 recruitment of ATAC to specific promoters might help establish or maintain an
 activated ( e.g. acetylated) state of chromatin but also has the
 potential to either interfere with or stimulate TBP/TFIID functions in a
 promoter/context-dependent manner, perhaps similar to the negative and
 positive activities of NC2 in transcription
 ( 29 – 31 , 43 , 44 ); in addition, the NC2-like
 module of ATAC could also facilitate chromatin assembly/remodeling by CHRAC
 complexes ( 7 , 40 ). Additional studies are
 necessary to define the effects of ATAC on physiological target genes in
 vivo .

In conclusion, we have shown that human STAGA and ATAC complexes can both
 incorporate either GCN5 or PCAF (GCN5/PCAF) and share the common ADA3 and
 STAF36 subunits, but differ by the inclusion of specifically ADA2-B in STAGA
 and ADA2-A in ATAC, and by many additional protein subunits that are
 characteristic of each complex and have often (but not always) homologous
 counterparts in corresponding yeast and Drosophila complexes
 (summarized in Fig. 5 ). Both
 STAGA and ATAC acetylate specifically nucleosomal histone H3 in
 vitro , although the specific residues acetylated might differ and remain
 to be identified. Notably, both complexes stably incorporate regulators of
 developmental processes and stress/MAPK signaling: FAM48A/p38IP in STAGA and
 MAP3K7/TAK1 and MBIP in ATAC. Whether these components regulate in a
 signal-dependent manner the functions of ATAC and/or STAGA warrants further
 investigation. Indeed, specific ATAC components including YEATS2 and NC2β
 are phosphorylated in vitro and in human cells (Ref. 29 and data not shown). The
 physical linkage within ATAC of signaling kinase components, nucleosome
 “modifiers” and “readers” generally associated with
 transcriptionally active chromatin ( e.g. GCN5/PCAF, ADAs, and WDR5),
 and a negative TBP-interacting NC2-like module (YEATS2-HFD/NC2β) suggest
 potential context-dependent and ambivalent roles of ATAC-type complexes in
 both positive and negative regulation of transcription (and perhaps other
 chromatin-associated processes). The results presented here provide a
 foundation to further explore this possibility and decipher the roles of
 distinct GCN5/PCAF complexes and their regulation by specific signaling
 pathways in mammalian cells.
