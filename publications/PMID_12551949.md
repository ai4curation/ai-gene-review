Functional control of the transcription factor Runx2 is crucial for normal bone 
formation. Runx2 is detectable throughout osteoblast development and maturation 
and temporally regulates several bone-specific genes. In this study, we 
identified a novel post-translational mechanism regulating Runx2-dependent 
activation of the osteocalcin promoter. A functional binding site for the high 
mobility group protein lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) was found 
adjacent to the proximal Runx2-binding site in the osteocalcin promoter. In 
transcription assays, LEF1 repressed Runx2-induced activation of the mouse 
osteocalcin 2 promoter in several osteoblast lineage cell lines. Mutations in 
the LEF1-binding site increased the basal activity of the osteocalcin promoter; 
however, the LEF1 recognition site in the osteocalcin promoter was surprisingly 
not required for LEF1 repression. A novel interaction between the DNA-binding 
domains of Runx2 and LEF1 was identified and found crucial for LEF1-mediated 
repression of Runx2. LEF1 is a nuclear effector of the Wnt/LRP5/beta-catenin 
signaling pathway, which is also essential for osteoblast proliferation and 
normal skeletal development. A constitutively active beta-catenin enhanced 
LEF1-dependent repression of Runx2. These data identify a novel mechanism of 
regulating Runx2 activity in osteoblasts and link Runx2 transcriptional activity 
to beta-catenin signaling.
