Ras proteins function as a point of convergence for different signalling 
pathways in eukaryotes and are involved in many cellular responses; their 
different subcellular locations could regulate distinct functions. To 
investigate the localization of active Ras in vivo in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
we expressed a probe consisting of a GFP fusion with a trimeric Ras binding 
domain of Raf1 (eGFP-RBD3), which binds Ras-GTP with a much higher affinity than 
Ras-GDP. Our results show that in wild type cells active Ras accumulates mainly 
at the plasma membrane and in the nucleus during growth on medium containing 
glucose, while it accumulates mainly in mitochondria in wild type 
glucose-starved cells and relocalizes to the plasma membrane and to the nucleus 
upon addition of this sugar. A similar pattern is observed in a strain deleted 
in the CYR1 gene indicating that the absence of adenylate cyclase does not 
impair the localization of Ras-GTP. Remarkably, in a gpa2Δ, but not in a gpr1Δ 
mutant, active Ras accumulates in internal membranes and mitochondria, both when 
cells are growing on glucose medium or are starved, indicating that Gpa2, but 
not Gpr1 is required for the recruitment of Ras-GTP at the plasma membrane and 
in the nucleus. Moreover, deletion of both HXK1 and HXK2 also causes a 
mitochondrial localization of the probe, which relocalizes to the plasma 
membrane and to the nucleus upon expression of HXK2 on a centromeric plasmid, 
suggesting that this kinase is involved in the proper localization of active 
Ras.
