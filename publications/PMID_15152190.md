NF-kappaB is responsible for upregulating gene products that control cell 
survival. In this study, we demonstrate that SIRT1, a nicotinamide adenosine 
dinucleotide-dependent histone deacetylase, regulates the transcriptional 
activity of NF-kappaB. SIRT1, the mammalian ortholog of the yeast SIR2 
(Silencing Information Regulator) and a member of the Sirtuin family, has been 
implicated in modulating transcriptional silencing and cell survival. SIRT1 
physically interacts with the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and inhibits 
transcription by deacetylating RelA/p65 at lysine 310. Treatment of cells with 
resveratrol, a small-molecule agonist of Sirtuin activity, potentiates 
chromatin-associated SIRT1 protein on the cIAP-2 promoter region, an effect that 
correlates with a loss of NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression and sensitization 
of cells to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. While SIRT1 is capable of protecting 
cells from p53-induced apoptosis, our work provides evidence that SIRT1 activity 
augments apoptosis in response to TNFalpha by the ability of the deacetylase to 
inhibit the transactivation potential of the RelA/p65 protein.
