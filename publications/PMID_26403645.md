Ferroptosis is a recently recognized form of regulated cell death caused by an 
iron-dependent accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species. However, the 
molecular mechanisms regulating ferroptosis remain obscure. Here, we report that 
nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) plays a central role in 
protecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells against ferroptosis. Upon 
exposure to ferroptosis-inducing compounds (e.g., erastin, sorafenib, and 
buthionine sulfoximine), p62 expression prevented NRF2 degradation and enhanced 
subsequent NRF2 nuclear accumulation through inactivation of Kelch-like 
ECH-associated protein 1. Additionally, nuclear NRF2 interacted with 
transcriptional coactivator small v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma 
oncogene homolog proteins such as MafG and then activated transcription of 
quinone oxidoreductase-1, heme oxygenase-1, and ferritin heavy chain-1. 
Knockdown of p62, quinone oxidoreductase-1, heme oxygenase-1, and ferritin heavy 
chain-1 by RNA interference in HCC cells promoted ferroptosis in response to 
erastin and sorafenib. Furthermore, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of NRF2 
expression/activity in HCC cells increased the anticancer activity of erastin 
and sorafenib in vitro and in tumor xenograft models.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate novel molecular mechanisms and signaling 
pathways of ferroptosis; the status of NRF2 is a key factor that determines the 
therapeutic response to ferroptosis-targeted therapies in HCC cells.
