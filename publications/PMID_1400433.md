The fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene is expressed as 
alternatively spliced mRNAs that encode bacterially expressed kinase, the 
keratinocyte growth factor receptor, or K-sam. We have now isolated a novel 
FGFR2 cDNA that is identical with the previously cloned human bacterially 
expressed kinase, except in the third immunoglobulin-like domain. The ligand 
binding properties of FGFR2 were studied by expressing the protein in rat L6 
muscle myoblasts. Unlike human bacterially expressed kinase which binds acidic 
and basic FGF with similar affinities, FGFR2 bound acidic FGF with approximately 
1000-fold higher affinity than basic FGF. These results indicate that 
alternative splicing of the FGFR2 gene in the region encoding the 
carboxyl-terminal half of the third immunoglobulin domain determines the ligand 
specificity of this group of receptors.
