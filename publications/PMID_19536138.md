OCRL, whose mutations are responsible for Lowe syndrome and Dent disease, and 
INPP5B are two similar proteins comprising a central inositol 5-phosphatase 
domain followed by an ASH and a RhoGAP-like domain. Their divergent NH2-terminal 
portions remain uncharacterized. We show that the NH2-terminal region of OCRL, 
but not of INPP5B, binds clathrin heavy chain. OCRL, which in contrast to INPP5B 
visits late stage endocytic clathrin-coated pits, was earlier shown to contain 
another binding site for clathrin in its COOH-terminal region. NMR structure 
determination further reveals that despite their primary sequence dissimilarity, 
the NH2-terminal portions of both OCRL and INPP5B contain a PH domain. The novel 
clathrin-binding site in OCRL maps to an unusual clathrin-box motif located in a 
loop of the PH domain, whose mutations reduce recruitment efficiency of OCRL to 
coated pits. These findings suggest an evolutionary pressure for a specialized 
function of OCRL in bridging phosphoinositide metabolism to clathrin-dependent 
membrane trafficking.
