BAD, a proapoptotic molecule of the BCL2 family, is regulated by reversible 
phosphorylation. During survival, BAD is sequestered by 14-3-3 through serine 
136 phosphorylation and is dissociated from BCL-X(L) through serine 155 
phosphorylation. We report that phosphoserine 112 (pSer112) dephosphorylation 
functions as a gatekeeper for BAD-mediated apoptosis. During apoptosis, 
dephosphorylation of pSer112 preceded pSer136 dephosphorylation. 
Dephosphorylation of pSer112 accelerated dephosphorylation of pSer136, and 
inhibition of pSer112 dephosphorylation prevented pSer136 dephosphorylation, 
indicating that dephosphorylation of pSer112 is required for dephosphorylation 
of pSer136. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is the major pSer112 phosphatase. PP2A 
competed with 14-3-3 for BAD binding, and survival factor withdrawal enhanced 
PP2A association with BAD. Dephosphorylation of the critical residue, pSer136, 
could only be blocked by inhibition of all known subfamilies of serine/threonine 
phosphatases, suggesting that multiple phosphatases are involved in pSer136 
dephosphorylation. Inhibition of PP2A rescued FL5.12 cells from apoptosis, 
demonstrating a physiologic role for PP2A-mediated pSer112 dephosphorylation. 
Thus, PP2A dephosphorylation of pSer112 is the key initiating event regulating 
the activation of BAD during interleukin-3 withdrawal-induced apoptosis.
