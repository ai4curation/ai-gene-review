Defects in circadian rhythm influence physiology and behavior with implications 
for the treatment of sleep disorders, metabolic disease, and cancer. Although 
core regulatory components of clock rhythmicity have been defined, insight into 
the mechanisms underpinning amplitude is limited. Here, we show that REV-ERBα, a 
core inhibitory component of clock transcription, is targeted for ubiquitination 
and subsequent degradation by the F-box protein FBXW7. By relieving 
REV-ERBα-dependent repression, FBXW7 provides an unrecognized mechanism for 
enhancing the amplitude of clock gene transcription. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 
(CDK1)-mediated phosphorylation of REV-ERBα is necessary for FBXW7 recognition. 
Moreover, targeted hepatic disruption of FBXW7 alters circadian expression of 
core clock genes and perturbs whole-body lipid and glucose levels. This 
CDK1-FBXW7 pathway controlling REV-ERBα repression defines an unexpected 
molecular mechanism for re-engaging the positive transcriptional arm of the 
clock, as well as a potential route to manipulate clock amplitude via small 
molecule CDK1 inhibition.
