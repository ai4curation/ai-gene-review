Mutations in the Hedgehog receptor, Patched 1 (Ptch1), have been linked to both 
familial and sporadic forms of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), leading to the 
hypothesis that loss of Ptch1 function is sufficient for tumor progression. By 
combining conditional knockout technology with the inducible activity of the 
Keratin6 promoter, we provide in vivo evidence that loss of Ptch1 function from 
the basal cell population of mouse skin is sufficient to induce rapid skin tumor 
formation, reminiscent of human BCC. Elimination of Ptch1 does not promote the 
nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and does not induce ectopic activation or 
expression of Notch pathway constituents. In the absence of Ptch1, however, a 
large proportion of basal cells exhibit nuclear accumulation of the cell cycle 
regulators cyclin D1 and B1. Collectively, our data suggest that Ptch1 likely 
functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting G1-S phase and G2-M phase cell 
cycle progression, and the rapid onset of tumor progression clearly indicates 
Ptch1 functions as a "gatekeeper." In addition, we note the high frequency and 
rapid onset of tumors in this mouse model makes it an ideal system for testing 
therapeutic strategies, such as Patched pathway inhibitors.
