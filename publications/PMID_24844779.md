AIMS: Hypoxia induces expression of various genes and microRNAs (miRs) that 
regulate angiogenesis and vascular function. In this study, we investigated a 
new functional role of new hypoxia-responsive miR-101 in angiogenesis and its 
underlying mechanism for regulating heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression.
RESULTS: We found that hypoxia induced miR-101, which binds to the 
3'untranslated region of cullin 3 (Cul3) and stabilizes nuclear factor 
erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) via inhibition of the proteasomal 
degradation pathway. miR-101 overexpression promoted Nrf2 nuclear accumulation, 
which was accompanied with increases in HO-1 induction, VEGF expression, and 
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-derived nitric oxide (NO) production. 
The elevated NO-induced S-nitrosylation of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 
and subsequent induction of Nrf2-dependent HO-1 lead to further elevation of 
VEGF production via a positive feedback loop between the Nrf2/HO-1 and VEGF/eNOS 
axes. Moreover, miR-101 promoted angiogenic signals and angiogenesis both in 
vitro and in vivo, and these events were attenuated by inhibiting the biological 
activity of HO-1, VEGF, or eNOS. Moreover, these effects were also observed in 
aortic rings from HO-1(+/-) and eNOS(-/-) mice. Local overexpression of miR-101 
improved therapeutic angiogenesis and perfusion recovery in the ischemic mouse 
hindlimb, whereas antagomiR-101 diminished regional blood flow.
INNOVATION: Hypoxia-responsive miR-101 stimulates angiogenesis by activating the 
HO-1/VEGF/eNOS axis via Cul3 targeting. Thus, miR-101 is a novel angiomir.
CONCLUSION: Our results provide new mechanistic insights into a functional role 
of miR-101 as a potential therapeutic target in angiogenesis and vascular 
remodeling.
