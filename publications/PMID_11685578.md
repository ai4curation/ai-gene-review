The nudF and nudC genes of the fungus Aspergillus nidulans encode proteins that 
are members of two evolutionarily conserved families. In A. nidulans these 
proteins mediate nuclear migration along the hyphae. The human ortholog of nudF 
is Lis1, a gene essential for neuronal migration in the developing cerebral 
cortex. The mammalian ortholog of nudC encodes a protein that interacts with 
Lis1. We have identified orthologs of nudC and Lis1 from the nematode 
Caenorhabditis elegans. Heterologous expression of the C. elegans nudC ortholog, 
nud-1, complements the A. nidulans nudC3 mutant, demonstrating evolutionary 
conservation of function. A C. elegans nud-1::GFP fusion produces sustained 
fluorescence in sensory neurons and embryos, and transient fluorescence in the 
gonad, gut, vulva, ventral cord, and hypodermal seam cells. Fusion of GFP to C. 
elegans lis-1 revealed expression in all major neuronal processes of the animal 
as well as the multinucleate spermathecal valves and adult seam cells. 
Phenotypic analysis of either nud-1 and lis-1 by RNA interference yielded 
similar phenotypes, including embryonic lethality, sterility, altered vulval 
morphology, and uncoordinated movement. Digital time-lapse video microscopy was 
used to determine that RNAi-treated embryos exhibited nuclear positioning 
defects in early embryonic cell division similar to those reported for 
dynein/dynactin depletion. These results demonstrate that the LIS-1/NUDC-like 
proteins of C. elegans represent a link between nuclear positioning, cell 
division, and neuronal function.
