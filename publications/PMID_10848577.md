Activated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) receptor 1 (TNFR1) recruits 
TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), which in turn triggers two 
opposite signaling pathways leading to caspase activation for apoptosis 
induction and NF-kappaB activation for antiapoptosis gene upregulation. Here we 
show that Stat1 is involved in the TNFR1-TRADD signaling complex, as determined 
by employing a novel antibody array screening method. In HeLa cells, Stat1 was 
associated with TNFR1 and this association was increased with TNF-alpha 
treatment. TNFR1 signaling factors TRADD and Fas-associated death domain protein 
(FADD) were also found to interact with Stat1 in a TNF-alpha-dependent process. 
Our in vitro recombinant protein-protein interaction studies demonstrated that 
Stat1 could directly interact with TNFR1 and TRADD but not with FADD. 
Interaction between Stat1 and receptor-interacting protein (RIP) or 
TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) was not detected. Examination of 
Stat1-deficient cells showed an apparent increase in TNF-alpha-induced TRADD-RIP 
and TRADD-TRAF2 complex formation, while interaction between TRADD and FADD was 
unaffected. As a consequence, TNF-alpha-mediated I-kappaB degradation and 
NF-kappaB activation were markedly enhanced in Stat1-deficient cells, whereas 
overexpression of Stat1 in 293T cells blocked NF-kappaB activation by TNF-alpha. 
Thus, Stat1 acts as a TNFR1-signaling molecule to suppress NF-kappaB activation.

Activated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) receptor 1 (TNFR1) recruits TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), which in turn triggers two opposite signaling pathways leading to caspase activation for apoptosis induction and NF-κB activation for antiapoptosis gene upregulation. Here we show that Stat1 is involved in the TNFR1-TRADD signaling complex, as determined by employing a novel antibody array screening method. In HeLa cells, Stat1 was associated with TNFR1 and this association was increased with TNF-α treatment. TNFR1 signaling factors TRADD and Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) were also found to interact with Stat1 in a TNF-α-dependent process. Our in vitro recombinant protein-protein interaction studies demonstrated that Stat1 could directly interact with TNFR1 and TRADD but not with FADD. Interaction between Stat1 and receptor-interacting protein (RIP) or TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) was not detected. Examination of Stat1-deficient cells showed an apparent increase in TNF-α-induced TRADD-RIP and TRADD-TRAF2 complex formation, while interaction between TRADD and FADD was unaffected. As a consequence, TNF-α-mediated I-κB degradation and NF-κB activation were markedly enhanced in Stat1-deficient cells, whereas overexpression of Stat1 in 293T cells blocked NF-κB activation by TNF-α. Thus, Stat1 acts as a TNFR1-signaling molecule to suppress NF-κB activation.
