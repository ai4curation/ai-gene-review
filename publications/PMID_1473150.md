The role of S. cerevisiae YDJ1 protein (YDJ1p) in polypeptide translocation 
across membranes has been examined. A conditional ydj1 mutant strain 
(ydj1-151TS) is defective for import of several polypeptides into mitochondria 
and alpha factor into the endoplasmic reticulum at 37 degrees C. These defects 
are suppressed by E. coli dnaJ or overexpression of S. cerevisiae SIS1 proteins. 
A different ydj1 mutant, which cannot be farnesylated (ydj1-S406), displays 
similar transport defects to the ydj1-151 strain. Furthermore, the ability of 
purified ydj1-151p to stimulate the ATPase activity of hsp70SSA1 was greatly 
diminished compared with the wild-type protein. Together, these data suggest 
that YDJ1p functions in polypeptide translocation in a conserved manner, 
probably acting at organelle membranes and in association with hsp70 proteins.
