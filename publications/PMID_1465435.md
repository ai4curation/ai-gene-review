p53 activates transcription of genes with a p53 response element, and it can 
repress genes lacking the element. Here we demonstrate that wild-type but not 
mutant p53 inhibits transcription in a HeLa nuclear extract from minimal 
promoters. Wild-type but not mutant p53 binds to human TATA-binding protein 
(TBP). p53 does not bind to yeast TBP, and it cannot inhibit transcription in a 
HeLa extract where yeast TBP substitutes for human TBP. These results suggest a 
model in which p53 binds to TBP and interferes with transcriptional initiation.

Abstract

p53 activates transcription of genes with a p53 response element, and it can repress genes lacking the element. Here we demonstrate that wild-type but not mutant p53 inhibits transcription in a HeLa nuclear extract from minimal promoters. Wild-type but not mutant p53 binds to human TATA-binding protein (TBP). p53 does not bind to yeast TBP, and it cannot inhibit transcription in a HeLa extract where yeast TBP substitutes for human TBP. These results suggest a model in which p53 binds to TBP and interferes with transcriptional initiation.
