The Rab GTPases are key regulators of vesicular transport. A fraction of Rab 
proteins is present in the cytosol, bound with GDP, complexed to a protein 
termed GDI. Rab9 is localized primarily to late endosomes, where it aids the 
transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors to the trans-Golgi network. It has 
been proposed that Rab proteins are delivered to specific membranes by GDI, and 
that this process is accompanied by the exchange of bound GDP for GTP. In 
addition, Rab localization requires carboxy-terminal prenylation and specific 
structural determinants. Here we describe the reconstitution of the selective 
targeting of prenylated Rab9 protein onto late endosome membranes and show that 
this process is accompanied by endosome-triggered nucleotide exchange.
