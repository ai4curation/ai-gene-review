Hypoxic stress and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play important roles in a 
wide range of tumors. We demonstrate that SPOP, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin 
ligase component, is a direct transcriptional target of HIFs in clear cell renal 
cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Furthermore, hypoxia results in cytoplasmic accumulation 
of SPOP, which is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis. This tumorigenic activity 
occurs through the ubiquitination and degradation of multiple regulators of 
cellular proliferation and apoptosis, including the tumor suppressor PTEN, ERK 
phosphatases, the proapoptotic molecule Daxx, and the Hedgehog pathway 
transcription factor Gli2. Knockdown of SPOP specifically kills ccRCC cells, 
indicating that it may be a promising therapeutic target. Collectively, our 
results indicate that SPOP serves as a regulatory hub to promote ccRCC 
tumorigenesis.

INTRODUCTION

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the eighth leading malignancy in the United States, accounting for 4% of all cancers. More than 209,000 new cases and 102,000 deaths are estimated to occur worldwide each year ( Rini et al., 2009 ). Approximately 30% of RCC patients present with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, and nearly half of the remainder will subsequently develop metastasis ( McDermott et al., 2005 ; Negrier et al., 1998 ). As RCC is highly resistant to chemotherapy, first-line treatment of metastatic disease in the 1990s and 2000s relied on immunotherapies, such as Interleukin-2 and interferon alpha, despite low response rates (5 to 20%) ( Fyfe et al., 1996 ; McDermott et al., 2005 ; Wardle, 1991 ). Hypoxic response mediated though HIFs is a key feature of most solid tumors, but is particularly important in kidney cancers ( Chi et al., 2006 ). Accordingly, recent targeted therapies that inhibit HIF-regulated pathways, including angiogenesis inhibitors directed against VEGF and PDGF signaling pathways have been developed. Although these therapies represent improvements in patient care, the majority of patients with advanced disease remain refractory to treatment, suggesting that certain critical HIF targets remain unknown ( Escudier et al., 2007 ; Motzer et al., 2013 ; Motzer et al., 2007 ).

It has been shown that under normoxic conditions the oxygen-sensitive HIFα subunit is degraded by ubiquitination via the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor gene ( Kaelin, 2002 ). However, under hypoxic conditions HIF degradation is suppressed, leading to enhanced nuclear localization of HIF and transcription of various target genes, including the angiogenic gene VEGF ( Kaelin Jr, 2008 ). Inactivating mutations or silencing of the VHL tumor suppressor gene can also suppress the degradation to HIF, and VHL mutation or silencing is found in at least 80% of all ccRCCs ( Kim and Kaelin, 2004 ; Motzer and Molina, 2009 ; Nickerson et al., 2008 ). ccRCCs are the most common form of kidney cancer, accounting for 75% of all cases ( Lopez-Beltran et al., 2006 ). Results from ccRCC xenograft experiments indicate that HIF accumulation is critical for VHL tumor suppressor function during ccRCC oncogenesis ( Kaelin, 2008 ). It has also been found that renal carcinoma cells have evolved an alternative hypoxia signaling pathways compared with normal renal cells ( Jiang et al., 2003 ) and the ccRCCs are in a high hypoxia response state compared to the normal kidney samples and other subtypes of kidney cancer ( Chi et al., 2006 ).

Although hypoxia response plays a critical role in kidney cancer, other cell regulatory pathways are also important for tumor development and progression ( Brugarolas, 2007 ). For example, another promising target for RCC therapies is the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which is abnormally activated during the development of kidney cancer ( Robb et al., 2007 ). mTOR is negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor PTEN ( Hollander et al., 2011 ), which is mutated or down-regulated in many cancers, including ccRCC ( Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002 ). The mTOR pathway positively regulates cell growth and proliferation through enhanced mRNA translation by phosphorylated S6 kinase1 (S6K1) and 4E binding protein-1 (4E-BP1) ( Sarbassov et al., 2005 ). In spite of its promise, the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus produces only low objective responses in patients with advanced RCC, although it contributes to a modest improvement in overall survival ( Hudes et al., 2007 ; Kapoor and Figlin, 2009 ). Further investigation of the mechanisms of PTEN down-regulation in ccRCC is critical for an understanding of RCC pathogenesis.

Our previous studies demonstrated that the SPOP protein is overexpressed in 85% of kidney cancers and that nearly 100% of primary and metastatic ccRCCs exhibit SPOP accumulation ( Liu et al., 2009 ). SPOP is a BTB/POZ domain protein, and MEL-26, the C. elegans SPOP ortholog, was first identified as an adaptor for the E3 ligase Cullin3 (Cul3). In C. elegans , MEL-26 promotes the meiotic/mitotic transition through the degradation of MEI-1/katanin (Mains et al., 1990; Pintard et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2003 ). In Drosophila , D-SPOP (also known as Roadkill) can promote the ubiquitination and degradation of the Gli transcription factor ortholog Cubitus interruptus (Ci) and the JNK phosphatase Puckered to regulate the Hedgehog (Hh) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) pathways, respectively ( Kent et al., 2006 ; Zhang et al., 2006 )( Liu et al., 2009 ). In humans, the roles for SPOP in regulating the Hh and TNF pathways have been conserved ( Zhang et al., 2006 ) ( Liu et al., 2009 ), and several other SPOP substrates have been identified as well, including the death domain–associated protein (Daxx) ( Kwon et al., 2006 ), the polycomb group protein BMI-1, and the Histone variant MacroH2A ( Hernandez-Munoz et al., 2005 ). Together these previous results indicate that SPOP plays important roles during cell apoptosis, proliferation and animal development, and suggest that overexpression of SPOP in ccRCCs may lead to dysregulation of pathways involved in tumorigenesis. However, it is unclear how SPOP becomes overexpressed or whether it may function directly in kidney tumorigenesis. Adding to this puzzle, recent deep sequencing studies of breast, prostate and endometrial cancers found that SPOP is frequently mutated, and the SPOP locus is observed to undergo loss of heterozygosity (LOH), indicating that SPOP may act as a tumor suppressor ( Berger et al., 2011 ; Li et al., 2011 ). However, no SPOP mutations have been detected in kidney cancers thus far ( Liu et al., 2009 ; The Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2013 ). In this study, we aim to determine whether SPOP promotes tumorigenesis in kidney.

DISCUSSION

Our results indicate that HIF can drive SPOP over-expression in ccRCC and over-expressed SPOP accumulates in the cytoplasm of ccRCC. In turn, accumulation of cytoplasmic SPOP in ccRCC cells appears to directly result in the degradation of PTEN, DUSP6, DUSP7, Daxx, and Gli2. We suggest that the concerted loss of function of these proteins in ccRCCs leads to tumorigenic phenotypes. Therefore, cytoplasmic SPOP appears to drive tumorigenesis by acting as a key regulatory ‘hub’ protein that orchestrates cancer phenotypes through the modulation of several critical cellular pathways ( Figure 6F ).

The HIF signaling pathway and the PTEN/mTOR pathway are currently the major therapeutic targets in ccRCC treatment. We suggest here that, as a regulatory hub driving tumorigenesis in ccRCC, SPOP has potential to be an efficient drug target. Knocking down SPOP leads to apoptosis in ccRCC cell lines but not in HEK293 and HeLa cells, where SPOP is in the nucleus. In addition to considering SPOP itself as a target, we also suggest that combinatorial modulation of the signaling pathways regulated by SPOP may have the potential to be more effective than the current targeted therapies alone.

Several issues about SPOP function in ccRCC remain to be explored. For example, given the promiscuity of SPOP in targeting critical proliferative and apoptotic pathway components, it is unlikely that the proteins studied here are the only critical cellular targets. While we focused our discovery of new targets on proteins with DUSP domains, genome-wide there are dozens of potential SPOP substrates. However, the modulation of PTEN, ERK, and Hh (through Gli2) signaling clearly has major effects on proliferation, and these results clearly demonstrate that SPOP is acting as a critical hub in a network involving multiple cancer-related pathways. In doing so, SPOP appears to be both necessary and sufficient for tumorigenic phenotypes.

Another open question is what molecular mechanism accounts for SPOP mislocalization to the cytoplasm. Although we demonstrate that hypoxia can drive accumulation of SPOP in cytoplasm, a number of possibilities exist for how it transfers from the nucleus to the cytoplasm or vice versa. Since no SPOP mutation has been detected in kidney cancers thus far ( Liu et al., 2009 ; The Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2013 ), post-transcriptional modifications on SPOP, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination on its nuclear localization signal, may regulate its location. It has been extensively reviewed elsewhere that post-transcriptional modifications can regulate nuclear import ( Hung and Link, 2011 ; Nardozzi et al., 2010 ). Alternatively, this translocation may also be regulated by interaction with transfer proteins regulated by hypoxia, since protein–protein interactions also serve as an important regulatory mechanism of protein translocation ( Hung and Link, 2011 ). Localized and targeted degradation of SPOP is also an intriguing mechanism, although attempts in our hands to determine whether it could be a target of obvious candidates such as VHL have been negative (Karmakar et al., unpublished data). Exploring the molecular mechanisms of cytoplasmic SPOP accumulation is an important direction to pursue in the future.

Finally, our previous screening also observed that SPOP was overexpressed in several other tumors, including some cases of endometrial and germ cell tumors ( Liu et al., 2009 ). The role of SPOP in these tumor types is unexplored, as is the role of mutant SPOP or its LOH in prostate and breast cancers ( Berger et al., 2011 ; Li et al., 2011 ). The identification of loss-of-function SPOP in these other tissues warrants the caution in development of any therapeutic interventions that systemically inhibit SPOP function. Indeed, SPOP may be acting as a tumor suppressor in breast and/or prostate cancers, but our results clearly indicate that it acts as an oncoprotein in ccRCCs. Considering hypoxia stress plays important roles in many different tumors, future efforts to develop tools that selectively modulate SPOP may be beneficial for treating a wide range of tumors.
