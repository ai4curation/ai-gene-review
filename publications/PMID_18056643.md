The lymphoid-specific tyrosine phosphatase (Lyp) has generated enormous interest 
because a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the gene (PTPN22) encoding Lyp 
produces a gain-of-function mutant phosphatase that is associated with several 
autoimmune diseases, including type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Graves 
disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, Lyp represents a potential 
target for a broad spectrum of autoimmune disorders. Unfortunately, no Lyp 
inhibitor has been reported. In addition, little is known about the structure 
and biochemical mechanism that directly regulates Lyp function. Here, we report 
the identification of a bidentate salicylic acid-based Lyp inhibitor I-C11 with 
excellent cellular efficacy. Structural and mutational analyses indicate that 
the inhibitor binds both the active site and a nearby peripheral site unique to 
Lyp, thereby furnishing a solid foundation upon which inhibitors with 
therapeutic potency and selectivity can be developed. Moreover, a comparison of 
the apo- and inhibitor-bound Lyp structures reveals that the Lyp-specific region 
S(35)TKYKADK(42), which harbors a PKC phosphorylation site, could adopt either a 
loop or helical conformation. We show that Lyp is phosphorylated exclusively at 
Ser-35 by PKC both in vitro and in vivo. We provide evidence that the status of 
Ser-35 phosphorylation may dictate the conformational state of the insert region 
and thus Lyp substrate recognition. We demonstrate that Ser-35 phosphorylation 
impairs Lyp's ability to inactivate the Src family kinases and down-regulate T 
cell receptor signaling. Our data establish a mechanism by which PKC could 
attenuate the cellular function of Lyp, thereby augmenting T cell activation.
