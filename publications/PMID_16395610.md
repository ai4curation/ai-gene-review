Human secretoglobin (SCGB) 2A1 (or lipophilin C, lacryglobin, mammaglobin B) is 
a small protein of unknown function that forms heterodimers with secretoglobin 
1D1 (lipophilin A) in tears. SCGB 2A1 is homologous to mammaglobin (mammaglobin 
A) and the C3 component of prostatein, the major secretory protein of the rat 
ventral prostate. Androgen-dependent expression of SCGB 2A1 has been observed in 
the prostate. Besides identification of SCGB 2A1 in the tear proteome only its 
mRNA had been detected in the lacrimal gland. Here, we report expression of SCGB 
2A1 in all ocular glands and in the keratinized stratified squamous epithelium 
of the eyelid as well as in the stratified epithelium of the conjunctiva and in 
the orbicularis oculi muscle. Almost all of these tissues are also known to 
express the androgen receptor. Therefore, we conclude that presence of the 
androgen signalling machinery could be the main general determinant of SCGB 2A1 
expression. Implications of the presence in tear fluid of an androgen-regulated 
secretoglobin, which most likely binds hydrophobic ligands, for tear film lipid 
layer formation and function is discussed.
