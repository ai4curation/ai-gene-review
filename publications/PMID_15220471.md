Longevity regulatory genes include the Forkhead transcription factor FOXO and 
the NAD-dependent histone deacetylase silent information regulator 2 (Sir2). 
Genetic studies demonstrate that Sir2 acts to extend lifespan in Caenorhabditis 
elegans upstream of DAF-16, a member of the FOXO family, in the insulin-like 
signaling pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the requirement 
of DAF-16 activity in Sir2-mediated longevity remain unknown. Here we show that 
reversible acetylation of Foxo1 (also known as FKHR), the mouse DAF-16 ortholog, 
modulates its transactivation function. cAMP-response element-binding protein 
(CREB)-binding protein binds and acetylates Foxo1 at the K242, K245, and K262 
residues, the modification of which is involved in the attenuation of Foxo1 as a 
transcription factor. Conversely, Sir2 binds and deacetylates Foxo1 at residues 
acetylated by cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein. Sir2 is 
recruited to insulin response sequence-containing promoter and increases the 
expression of manganese superoxide dismutase and p27(kip1) in a 
deacetylase-activity-dependent manner. Our findings establish Foxo1 as a direct 
and functional target for Sir2 in mammalian systems.
