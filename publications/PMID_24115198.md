Autophagy is an essential eukaryotic pathway required for cellular homeostasis. 
Numerous key autophagy effectors and regulators have been identified, but the 
mechanism by which they carry out their function in autophagy is not fully 
understood. Our rigorous bioinformatic analysis shows that the majority of key 
human autophagy proteins include intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which 
are sequences lacking stable secondary and tertiary structure; suggesting that 
IDRs play an important, yet hitherto uninvestigated, role in autophagy. 
Available crystal structures corroborate the absence of structure in some of 
these predicted IDRs. Regions of orthologs equivalent to the IDRs predicted in 
the human autophagy proteins are poorly conserved, indicating that these regions 
may have diverse functions in different homologs. We also show that IDRs 
predicted in human proteins contain several regions predicted to facilitate 
protein-protein interactions, and delineate the network of proteins that 
interact with each predicted IDR-containing autophagy protein, suggesting that 
many of these interactions may involve IDRs. Lastly, we experimentally show that 
a BCL2 homology 3 domain (BH3D), within the key autophagy effector BECN1 is an 
IDR. This BH3D undergoes a dramatic conformational change from coil to α-helix 
upon binding to BCL2s, with the C-terminal half of this BH3D constituting a 
binding motif, which serves to anchor the interaction of the BH3D to BCL2s. The 
information presented here will help inform future in-depth investigations of 
the biological role and mechanism of IDRs in autophagy proteins.
