Autosomal-dominant missense mutations in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) 
are a common genetic cause of PD (Parkinson's disease). LRRK2 is a multidomain 
protein with kinase and GTPase activities. Dominant mutations are found in the 
domains that have these two enzyme activities, including the common G2019S 
mutation that increases kinase activity 2-3-fold. However, there is also a 
genetic variant in some populations, G2385R, that lies in a C-terminal WD40 
domain of LRRK2 and acts as a risk factor for PD. In the present study we show 
that the G2385R mutation causes a partial loss of the kinase function of LRRK2 
and deletion of the C-terminus completely abolishes kinase activity. This effect 
is strong enough to overcome the kinase-activating effects of the G2019S 
mutation in the kinase domain. Hsp90 (heat-shock protein of 90 kDa) has an 
increased affinity for the G2385R variant compared with WT (wild-type) LRRK2, 
and inhibition of the chaperone binding combined with proteasome inhibition 
leads to association of mutant LRRK2 with high molecular mass native fractions 
that probably represent proteasome degradation pathways. The loss-of-function of 
G2385R correlates with several cellular phenotypes that have been proposed to be 
kinase-dependent. These results suggest that the C-terminus of LRRK2 plays an 
important role in maintaining enzymatic function of the protein and that G2385R 
may be associated with PD in a way that is different from kinase-activating 
mutations. These results may be important in understanding the differing 
mechanism(s) by which mutations in LRRK2 act and may also have implications for 
therapeutic strategies for PD.
