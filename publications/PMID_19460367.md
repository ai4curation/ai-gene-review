SPIN90 is a key regulator of actin cytoskeletal organization. Using the 
BioGRID(beta) database (General Repository for Interaction Datasets), we 
identified IRSp53 as a binding partner of SPIN90, and confirmed the in vivo 
formation of a SPIN90-IRSp53 complex mediated through direct association of the 
proline-rich domain (PRD) of SPIN90 with the SH3 domain of IRSp53. SPIN90 and 
IRSp53 positively cooperated to mediate Rac activation, and co-expression of 
SPIN90 and IRSp53 in COS-7 cells led to the complex formation of SPIN90-IRSp53 
in the leading edge of cells. PDGF treatment induced strong colocalization of 
SPIN90 and IRSp53 at membrane protrusions. Within such PDGF-induced protrusions, 
knockdown of SPIN90 protein using siRNA significantly reduced lamellipodia-like 
protrusions as well as localization of IRSp53 at those sites. Finally, 
competitive inhibition of SPIN90-IRSp53 binding by SPIN90 PRD dramatically 
reduced ruffle formation, further suggesting that SPIN90 plays a key role in the 
formation of the membrane protrusions associated with cell motility.
