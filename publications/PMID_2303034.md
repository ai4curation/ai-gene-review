stomach but not in breast carcinoma.

Approximately 50% of human breast tumors secrete a small cysteine-rich protein, 
pS2, of unknown function. pS2 protein was recently found to be homologous to a 
porcine protein with hormonogastric activity, pancreatic spasmolytic polypeptide 
(PSP), in which the 5-cysteine domain present in pS2 is tandemly duplicated. We 
have characterized cDNA species encoding PSP and its human and mouse 
counterparts, hSP and mSP. We show that hSP and pS2 are separately encoded in 
the genome, and that the two proteins are co-expressed in normal stomach 
epithelium. However, expression of hSP was not detected in breast tumors. 
Computer analysis revealed that the pattern of conserved cysteine residues in 
hSP and pS2, the P domain, is present at the N termini of two other mammalian 
proteins, intestinal sucrase-isomaltase and lysosomal alpha-glucosidase.
