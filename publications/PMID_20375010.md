Viruses initiate infection by attaching to molecules or receptors at the cell 
surface. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) enters cells via a multistep process involving 
tetraspanin CD81, scavenger receptor class B member I, and the tight junction 
proteins Claudin-1 and Occludin. CD81 and scavenger receptor class B member I 
interact with HCV-encoded glycoproteins, suggesting an initial role in mediating 
virus attachment. In contrast, there are minimal data supporting Claudin-1 
association with HCV particles, raising questions as to its role in the virus 
internalization process. In the present study we demonstrate a relationship 
between receptor active Claudins and their association and organization with 
CD81 at the plasma membrane by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and 
stoichiometric imaging methodologies. Mutation of residues 32 and 48 in the 
Claudin-1 first extracellular loop ablates CD81 association and HCV receptor 
activity. Furthermore, mutation of the same residues in the receptor-inactive 
Claudin-7 molecule enabled CD81 complex formation and virus entry, demonstrating 
an essential role for Claudin-CD81 complexes in HCV infection. Importantly, 
Claudin-1 associated with CD81 at the basolateral membrane of polarized HepG2 
cells, whereas tight junction-associated pools of Claudin-1 demonstrated a 
minimal association with CD81. In summary, we demonstrate an essential role for 
Claudin-CD81 complexes in HCV infection and their localization at the 
basolateral surface of polarized hepatoma cells, consistent with virus entry 
into the liver via the sinusoidal blood and association with basal expressed 
forms of the receptors.
