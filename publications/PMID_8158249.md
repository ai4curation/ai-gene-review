Mammalian cDNAs encoding a rat (Rel-N1) and a human (Hel-N1) neuronal 
RNA-binding protein have been cloned and characterized with respect to tissue 
specificity, neuroanatomical localization, and RNA binding specificity. Both 
proteins are highly similar to the product of the Drosophila elav gene, which is 
expressed in all neurons of the fly and is required for development of the 
nervous system. However, in situ hybridization of rat tissues demonstrated more 
restricted expression of Rel-N1 mRNA within a subset of neurons of the 
hippocampus, cortex, and other regions of the gray matter, but not in glial 
cells or white matter. In vitro RNA binding experiments demonstrated that Hel-N1 
can bind to the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of Id mRNA, a transcript that 
encodes a helix-loop-helix transcriptional repressor that is abundantly 
expressed in undifferentiated neural precursors. Sequences characterized for 
Hel-N1 binding were also abundantly present in the 3' UTR of the Drosophila 
extramacrochaetae mRNA, which encodes an Id homolog. Thus, we have identified a 
potential link between a neuronal 3' UTR RNA-binding protein and regulatory 
transcription factors involved in neural development. These findings are 
interpreted in light of recent studies in which mRNA 3' UTRs were found to be 
important for the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.
