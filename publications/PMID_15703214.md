Integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein 1 (ICAP-1) has been shown to 
interact specifically with the beta1 integrin cytoplasmic domain and to control 
cell spreading on fibronectin. Interestingly, ICAP-1 also is observed in the 
nucleus, by immunocytochemical staining, and after biochemical cell 
fractionation, suggesting that it has additional roles that have yet to be 
determined. We show that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling capability of ICAP-1 is 
dependent on a functional nuclear localization signal. In addition, 
overexpression of beta1 integrin strongly reduced this nuclear localization, 
suggesting that integrin activity could modulate ICAP-1 shuttling by 
sequestering it in the cytoplasm. Indeed, the nuclear localization of ICAP-1 is 
dependent on the stage of cell spreading on fibronectin, and we also show that 
ICAP-1 expression stimulates cellular proliferation in a fibronectin-dependent 
manner. This function is dependent on its nuclear localization. Moreover, ICAP-1 
is able to activate the c-myc promoter in vitro. Together, these results 
demonstrate that ICAP-1 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a beta1 
integrin-dependent manner. It could act as a messenger that relays information 
from sites of integrin-dependent cell adhesion to the nucleus for controlling 
gene expression and cell proliferation.
