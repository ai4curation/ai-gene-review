We recently identified an angiogenic mitogen, endocrine-gland-derived vascular 
endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF), with selective activity for endothelial 
cells of endocrine tissues. Here we describe the characterization of a highly 
related molecule, Bv8, also known as prokineticin-2. Human Bv8 shares 60% 
identity and 75% similarity with EG-VEGF. The human and mouse Bv8 genes share a 
common structure. Like EG-VEGF, Bv8 is able to induce proliferation, survival 
and migration of adrenal cortical capillary endothelial cells. Bv8 gene 
expression is induced by hypoxic stress. Bv8 expression occurs predominantly in 
the testis and is largely restricted to primary spermatocytes. Adenoviral 
delivery of Bv8 or EG-VEGF to the mouse testis resulted in a potent angiogenic 
response. We have localized the expression of the Bv8EG-VEGF receptors within 
the testis to vascular endothelial cells. The testis exhibits relatively high 
turnover of endothelial cells. Therefore, Bv8 and EG-VEGF, along with other 
factors such as VEGF-A, may maintain the integrity and also regulate 
proliferation of the blood vessels in the testis.
