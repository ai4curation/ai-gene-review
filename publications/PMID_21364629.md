Proteins containing the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) motif comprise a 
conserved family, postulated to act as cell protectors. However, their function 
and mechanisms of action remain unclear. Here we show that PRELI, a mammalian 
LEA-containing homolog of yeast Ups1p, can associate with dynamin-like GTPase 
Optic Atrophy-1 (OPA1) and contribute to the maintenance of mitochondrial 
morphology. Accordingly, PRELI can uphold mitochondrial membrane potential 
(ΔΨ(m)) and enhance respiratory chain (RC) function, shown by its capacity to 
induce complex-I/NADH dehydrogenase and ATP synthase expression, increase oxygen 
consumption and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. PRELI can also 
inhibit cell death induced by STS, TNF-α or UV irradiation. Moreover, in vitro 
and in vivo dominant-negative overexpression of mutant PRELI/LEA(-) (lacking the 
LEA motif) and transient in vitro PRELI-specific knockdown can render 
lymphocytes vulnerable to apoptosis, cause mouse embryo lethality and revert the 
resistance of lymphoma cells to induced death. Collectively, these data support 
the long-presumed notion of LEA protein-dependent mechanisms of cytoprotection 
and suggest that PRELI interacts with OPA1 to maintain mitochondria structures 
intact, sustain balanced ion(-)/proton(+) gradients, promote oxidative 
phosphorylation reactions, regulate pro- and antiapoptotic protein traffic and 
enable cell responses to induced death. These findings may help to understand 
how bioenergetics is mechanistically connected with cell survival cues.
