IL-22 is an IL-10 homologue that binds to and signals through the class II 
cytokine receptor heterodimer IL-22RA1/CRF2-4. IL-22 is produced by T cells and 
induces the production of acute-phase reactants in vitro and in vivo, suggesting 
its involvement in inflammation. Here we report the identification of a class II 
cytokine receptor designated IL-22RA2 (IL-22 receptor-alpha 2) that appears to 
be a naturally expressed soluble receptor. IL-22RA2 shares amino acid sequence 
homology with IL-22RA1 (also known as IL-22R, zcytor11, and CRF2-9) and is 
physically adjacent to IL-20Ralpha and IFN-gammaR1 on chromosome 6q23.3-24.2. We 
demonstrate that IL-22RA2 binds specifically to IL-22 and neutralizes 
IL-22-induced proliferation of BaF3 cells expressing IL-22 receptor subunits. 
IL-22RA2 mRNA is highly expressed in placenta and spleen by Northern blotting. 
PCR analysis using RNA from various tissues and cell lines showed that IL-22RA2 
was expressed in a range of tissues, including those in the digestive, female 
reproductive, and immune systems. In situ hybridization revealed the dominant 
cell types expressing IL-22RA2 were mononuclear cells and epithelium. Because 
IL-22 induces the expression of acute phase reactants, IL-22RA2 may play an 
important role as an IL-22 antagonist in the regulation of inflammatory 
responses.

Abstract

IL-22 is an IL-10 homologue that binds to and signals through the
 class II cytokine receptor heterodimer IL-22RA1/CRF2–4. IL-22 is
 produced by T cells and induces the production of acute-phase reactants in vitro and in vivo , suggesting its
 involvement in inflammation. Here we report the identification of a
 class II cytokine receptor designated IL-22RA2 (IL-22 receptor-α 2)
 that appears to be a naturally expressed soluble receptor. IL-22RA2
 shares amino acid sequence homology with IL-22RA1 (also known as
 IL-22R, zcytor11, and CRF2–9) and is physically adjacent to IL-20Rα
 and IFN-γR1 on chromosome 6q23.3–24.2. We demonstrate that IL-22RA2
 binds specifically to IL-22 and neutralizes IL-22-induced proliferation
 of BaF3 cells expressing IL-22 receptor subunits. IL-22RA2 mRNA is
 highly expressed in placenta and spleen by Northern blotting. PCR
 analysis using RNA from various tissues and cell lines showed that
 IL-22RA2 was expressed in a range of tissues, including those in the
 digestive, female reproductive, and immune systems. In
 situ hybridization revealed the dominant cell types expressing
 IL-22RA2 were mononuclear cells and epithelium. Because IL-22 induces
 the expression of acute phase reactants, IL-22RA2 may play an important
 role as an IL-22 antagonist in the regulation of inflammatory
 responses.
