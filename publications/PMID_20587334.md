LBH is a transcription factor as a candidate gene for CHD associated with 
partial trisomy 2p syndrome. To identify potential LBH-interacting partners, a 
yeast two-hybrid screen using LBH as a bait was performed with a human heart 
cDNA library. One of the clones identified encodes alphaB-crystallin. 
Co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays showed that LBH interacts with 
alphaB-crystallin, which is further confirmed by mammalian two-hybrid assays. 
Co-localization analysis showed that in COS-7 cells, alphaB-crystallin that is 
cytoplasmic alone, accumulates partialy in the nucleus when co-transfected with 
LBH. Transient transfection assays indicated that overexpression of LBH or 
alphaB-crystallin reduced the transcriptional activities of p53 and p21, 
respectively, Overexpression of both alphaB-crystallin and LBH together resulted 
in a stronger repression of the transcriptional activities of p21 and p53. These 
results showed that the interaction of LBH and alphaB-crystallin may inhibit 
synergistically the transcriptional regulation of p53 and p21.
