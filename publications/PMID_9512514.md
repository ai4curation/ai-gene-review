Eukaryotic organisms from yeast to human contain a multiprotein complex that 
includes Rpd3 histone deacetylase and Sin3 corepressor. The Sin3-Rpd3 complex, 
when recruited to promoters by specific DNA-binding proteins, can direct 
transcriptional repression of specific classes of target genes. It has been 
proposed that the histone deacetylase activity of Rpd3 is important for 
repression, but direct evidence is lacking. Here, we describe four Rpd3 
derivatives with mutations in evolutionarily invariant histidine residues in a 
putative deacetylation motif. These Rpd3 mutants lack detectable histone 
deacetylase activity in vitro, but interact normally with Sin3 in vivo. In yeast 
cells, these catalytically inactive mutants are defective for transcriptional 
repression. They retain some residual Rpd3 function in vivo, however, suggesting 
that repression by the Sin3-Rpd3 complex may not be attributable exclusively to 
its intrinsic histone deacetylase activity. Finally, we show that a human Rpd3 
homolog can interact with yeast Sin3 and repress transcription when artificially 
recruited to a promoter. These results suggest that the histone deacetylase 
activity of Rpd3 is important, but perhaps not absolutely required, for 
transcriptional repression in vivo.
