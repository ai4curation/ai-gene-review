Genetic studies have established that lysis inhibition in bacteriophage T4 
infections occurs when the RI antiholin inhibits the lethal hole-forming 
function of the T holin. The T-holin is composed of a single N-terminal 
transmembrane domain and a ~20 kDa periplasmic domain. It accumulates harmlessly 
throughout the bacteriophage infection cycle until suddenly causing 
permeabilization of the inner membrane, thereby initiating lysis. The RI 
antiholin has a SAR domain that directs its secretion to the periplasm, where it 
can either be inactivated and degraded or be activated as a specific inhibitor 
of T. Previously, it was shown that the interaction of the soluble domains of 
these two proteins within the periplasm was necessary for lysis inhibition. We 
have purified and characterized the periplasmic domains of both T and RI. Both 
proteins were purified in a modified host that allows disulfide bond formation 
in the cytoplasm, due to the functional requirement of conserved disulfide 
bonds. Analytical centrifugation and circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that 
RI was monomeric and exhibited ~80% alpha-helical content. In contrast, T 
exhibited a propensity to oligomerize and precipitate at high concentrations. 
Incubation of RI with T inhibits this aggregation and results in a complex of 
equimolar T and RI content. Although gel filtration analysis indicated a complex 
mass of 45 kDa, intermediate between the predicted 30 kDa heterodimer and 60 kDa 
heterotetramer, sedimentation velocity analysis indicated that the predominant 
species is the former. These results suggest that RI binding to T is necessary 
and sufficient for lysis inhibition.
