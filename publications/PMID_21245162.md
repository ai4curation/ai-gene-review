Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling early cell fate decisions in 
mammals is a major objective toward the development of robust methods for the 
differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into clinically relevant cell 
types. Here, we used human embryonic stem cells and mouse epiblast stem cells to 
study specification of definitive endoderm in vitro. Using a combination of 
whole-genome expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) deep sequencing 
(ChIP-seq) analyses, we established an hierarchy of transcription factors 
regulating endoderm specification. Importantly, the pluripotency factors NANOG, 
OCT4, and SOX2 have an essential function in this network by actively directing 
differentiation. Indeed, these transcription factors control the expression of 
EOMESODERMIN (EOMES), which marks the onset of endoderm specification. In turn, 
EOMES interacts with SMAD2/3 to initiate the transcriptional network governing 
endoderm formation. Together, these results provide for the first time a 
comprehensive molecular model connecting the transition from pluripotency to 
endoderm specification during mammalian development.
