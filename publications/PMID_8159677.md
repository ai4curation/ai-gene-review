The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SWI1, SWI2 (SNF2), SWI3, SNF5, and SNF6 gene 
products play a crucial role in the regulation of transcription. We provide here 
direct biochemical evidence that all five SWI/SNF polypeptides are components of 
a large multisubunit complex. These five polypeptides coelute from a 
gel-filtration column with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 2 MDa. 
The five SWI/SNF polypeptides do not copurify when extracts are prepared from 
swi- or snf- mutants. We show that SWI/SNF polypeptides also remain associated 
during an affinity-chromatography step followed by gel filtration. Assembly of 
the SWI/SNF complex is not disrupted by a mutation in the putative APT-binding 
site of SWI2, although this mutation eliminates SWI2 function.
