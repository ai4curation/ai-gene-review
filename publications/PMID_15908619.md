AIMS AND METHODS: Thyroid function tests were initially carried out on 122 
children with Down's syndrome aged 6-14 years and then repeated four to six 
years later in 103 adolescents (85% of the group of 122) when they were aged 
10-20 years (median 14.4 years). At the second test two were hypothyroid and two 
with isolated raised thyroid stimulating hormone (IR-TSH) were receiving 
thyroxine.
RESULTS: At the first test there were 98 (80%) euthyroid children: 83 were 
retested and four (5%) had IR-TSH. At the first test 24 had IR-TSH: 20 were 
retested and 14 (70%) had become normal. Seventeen with IR-TSH on initial 
testing had a thyrotrophin releasing hormone test within three months; TSH had 
become normal in eight (47%) of these children. There was no association between 
reported clinical symptoms and IR-TSH, but there were clear symptoms in one of 
the two with definite hypothyroidism.
CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood ratio for a positive result on second testing when 
raised TSH and positive antibody status on first testing are combined is 20. 
This suggests initial testing results could be used as a basis to select a 
subgroup for further testing at say five yearly intervals unless new symptoms 
emerge in the interim. It also suggests that yearly screening (as recommended by 
the American Academy of Pediatrics, 2001) is probably not justified in the first 
20 years of life.
