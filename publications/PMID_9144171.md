Human RIN1 was first characterized as a RAS binding protein based on the 
properties of its carboxyl-terminal domain. We now show that full-length RIN1 
interacts with activated RAS in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 
434 aa required for efficient RAS binding. RIN1 interacts with the "effector 
domain" of RAS and employs some RAS determinants that are common to, and others 
that are distinct from, those required for the binding of RAF1, a known RAS 
effector. The same domain of RIN1 that binds RAS also interacts with 14-3-3 
proteins, extending the similarity between RIN1 and other RAS effectors. When 
expressed in mammalian cells, the RAS binding domain of RIN1 can act as a 
dominant negative signal transduction blocker. The amino-terminal domain of RIN1 
contains a proline-rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 (SH3) 
binding regions. This RIN1 sequence shows preferential binding to the ABL-SH3 
domain in vitro. Moreover, the amino-terminal domain of RIN1 directly associates 
with, and is tyrosine phosphorylated by, c-ABL. In addition, RIN1 encodes a 
functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals. 
These data suggest that RIN1 is able to mediate multiple signals. A differential 
pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of RIN1 
regulation.
