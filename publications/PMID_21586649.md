Cytosolic/nuclear molecular chaperones of the heat shock protein families HSP90 
and HSC70 are conserved and essential proteins in eukaryotes. These proteins 
have essentially been implicated in the innate immunity and abiotic stress 
tolerance in higher plants. Here, we demonstrate that both chaperones are 
recruited in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) for stomatal closure induced by 
several environmental signals. Plants overexpressing HSC70-1 or with reduced 
HSP90.2 activity are compromised in the dark-, CO(2)-, flagellin 22 peptide-, 
and abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure. HSC70-1 and HSP90 proteins are 
needed to establish basal expression levels of several ABA-responsive genes, 
suggesting that these chaperones might also be involved in ABA signaling events. 
Plants overexpressing HSC70-1 or with reduced HSP90.2 activity are 
hypersensitive to ABA in seed germination assays, suggesting that several 
chaperone complexes with distinct substrates might tune tissue-specific 
responses to ABA and the other biotic and abiotic stimuli studied. This study 
demonstrates that the HSC70/HSP90 machinery is important for stomatal closure 
and serves essential functions in plants to integrate signals from their biotic 
and abiotic environments.

Abstract

Cytosolic/nuclear molecular chaperones of the heat shock protein families HSP90 and HSC70 are conserved and essential proteins in eukaryotes. These proteins have essentially been implicated in the innate immunity and abiotic stress tolerance in higher plants. Here, we demonstrate that both chaperones are recruited in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) for stomatal closure induced by several environmental signals. Plants overexpressing HSC70-1 or with reduced HSP90.2 activity are compromised in the dark-, CO 2 -, flagellin 22 peptide-, and abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure. HSC70-1 and HSP90 proteins are needed to establish basal expression levels of several ABA-responsive genes, suggesting that these chaperones might also be involved in ABA signaling events. Plants overexpressing HSC70-1 or with reduced HSP90.2 activity are hypersensitive to ABA in seed germination assays, suggesting that several chaperone complexes with distinct substrates might tune tissue-specific responses to ABA and the other biotic and abiotic stimuli studied. This study demonstrates that the HSC70/HSP90 machinery is important for stomatal closure and serves essential functions in plants to integrate signals from their biotic and abiotic environments.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we provide genetic and pharmacological evidence for the multiple functions of the HSC70/HSP90 molecular chaperone machinery in the fine-tuned regulation of stomatal aperture in response to various environmental conditions and of physiological responses to the ABA hormone in Arabidopsis.
