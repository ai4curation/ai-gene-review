"Regulator of G-protein signaling" (RGS) proteins facilitate the termination of 
G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling via their ability to increase the 
intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of Galpha subunits (known as GTPase-accelerating 
protein or "GAP" activity). RGS2 is unique in its in vitro potency and 
selectivity as a GAP for Galpha(q) subunits. As many vasoconstrictive hormones 
signal via G(q) heterotrimer-coupled receptors, it is perhaps not surprising 
that RGS2-deficient mice exhibit constitutive hypertension. However, to date the 
particular structural features within RGS2 determining its selectivity for 
Galpha(q) over Galpha(i/o) substrates have not been completely characterized. 
Here, we examine a trio of point mutations to RGS2 that elicits 
Galpha(i)-directed binding and GAP activities without perturbing its association 
with Galpha(q). Using x-ray crystallography, we determined a model of the triple 
mutant RGS2 in complex with a transition state mimetic form of Galpha(i) at 
2.8-A resolution. Structural comparison with unliganded, wild type RGS2 and of 
other RGS domain/Galpha complexes highlighted the roles of these residues in 
wild type RGS2 that weaken Galpha(i) subunit association. Moreover, these three 
amino acids are seen to be evolutionarily conserved among organisms with modern 
cardiovascular systems, suggesting that RGS2 arose from the R4-subfamily of RGS 
proteins to have specialized activity as a potent and selective Galpha(q) GAP 
that modulates cardiovascular function.
