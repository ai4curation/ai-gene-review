BACKGROUND: Proper attachment of chromosomes to microtubules is crucial for the 
accurate segregation of chromosomes. Human chromosomes attach initially to 
lateral walls of microtubules. Subsequently, attachments to lateral walls 
disappear and attachments to microtubule ends (end-on attachments) predominate. 
While it is known in yeasts that lateral to end-on conversion of attachments 
occurs through a multistep process, equivalent conversion steps in humans remain 
unknown.
RESULTS: By developing a high-resolution imaging assay to visualize intermediary 
steps of the lateral to end-on conversion process, we show that the mechanisms 
that bring a laterally bound chromosome and its microtubule end closer to each 
other are indispensable for proper end-on attachment because laterally attached 
chromosomes seldom detach. We show that end-on conversion requires (1) the 
plus-end-directed motor CENP-E to tether the lateral kinetochore onto 
microtubule walls and (2) the microtubule depolymerizer MCAK to release 
laterally attached microtubules after a partial end-on attachment is formed.
CONCLUSIONS: By uncovering a CENP-E mediated wall-tethering event and a 
MCAK-mediated wall-removing event, we establish that human 
chromosome-microtubule attachment is achieved through a set of deterministic 
sequential events rather than stochastic direct capture of microtubule ends.
