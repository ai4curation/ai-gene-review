Vesicular Over-expressed in cancer Prosurvival Protein 1 (VOPP1), also known as 
Glioblastoma Amplified and Secreted Protein and EGFR-Coamplified and 
Over-expressed Protein has been previously shown to be over-expressed in human 
glioblastoma multiforme and squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, previous 
experimental work suggests that it confers a prosurvival cellular phenotype. A 
query of a public database of gene expression profiling data (Oncomine) shows 
that the VOPP1 transcript is also highly expressed in several other common human 
cancers, including breast carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, and lymphoma. 
Analysis of VOPP1 sequence structure shows both a signal sequence and a 
transmembrane domain, and examination of a public microarray dataset for 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-bound mRNA transcripts is consistent with the VOPP1 
protein product being synthesized into the ER. Immunoblot analysis of cell 
culture and conditioned media confirms that the protein product is not secreted 
and is retained intracellularly. VOPP1 protein tagged with a fluorescence 
reporter, as well as antibody-mediated visualization of recombinant and native 
forms of the protein reveals an intracellular vesicular pattern of localization. 
Co-localization experiments reveal that VOPP1 vesicles do not co-localize with 
mitochondria or peroxisomes, but show partial co-localization with perinuclear 
lysosomes. Additionally, markers of endocytosis and autophagy show partial 
perinuclear co-localization, suggesting that VOPP1-containing vesicles enter 
final common pathways of the lysosomal system. These findings throw into doubt 
the hypothesis that VOPP1 interacts directly with cytoplasmic mediators of the 
NF kappa B pathway, and suggest that the prosurvival phenotype conferred by this 
gene product is mediated by other mechanisms.
