The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a metal-binding transcription factor whose 
conformation and function are altered by mutation in cancers. Using murine p53 
translated in vitro, we report here that concentrations of copper within the 
physiological range (< 30 microM) alter the conformation of wild-type p53 and 
inhibit sequence-specific DNA-binding. Direct binding of copper to p53 in the 
form of Cu(I) was demonstrated by Electron Spin Resonance using a purified 
recombinant protein containing residues 1-343 of murine wild-type p53 fused to 
E. coli maltose binding protein. Moreover, protection against the effect of 
Cu(II) sulfate was achieved by the Cu(I)-specific chelator 
bathocuproinedisulfonic acid but not by scavengers of reactive oxygen species, 
suggesting that alteration of p53 by copper depends upon a Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox 
mechanism, but does not require the production of reactive oxygen species. Thus 
copper at physiological concentrations can interact with wild-type p53 and 
affect its DNA-binding capacity.
