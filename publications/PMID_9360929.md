Induction of apoptosis by oncogenes like c-myc may be important in restraining 
the emergence of neoplasia. However, the mechanism by which c-myc induces 
apoptosis is unknown. CD95 (also termed Fas or APO-1) is a cell surface 
transmembrane receptor of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that 
activates an intrinsic apoptotic suicide program in cells upon binding either 
its ligand CD95L or antibody. c-myc-induced apoptosis was shown to require 
interaction on the cell surface between CD95 and its ligand. c-Myc acts 
downstream of the CD95 receptor by sensitizing cells to the CD95 death signal. 
Moreover, IGF-I signaling and Bcl-2 suppress c-myc-induced apoptosis by also 
acting downstream of CD95. These findings link two apoptotic pathways previously 
thought to be independent and establish the dependency of Myc on CD95 signaling 
for its killing activity.
