Reciprocal regulation of hepatic glycolysis and gluconeogenesis contributes to 
systemic metabolic homeostasis. Recent evidence from lower order organisms has 
found that reversible post-translational modification of 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), particularly acetylation, 
contributes to the reciprocal regulation of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. However, 
whether this occurs in mammalian hepatocytes in vitro or in vivo is unknown. 
Several proteomics studies have identified 4 lysine residues in critical regions 
of mammalian GAPDH that are altered by multiple post-translational 
modifications. In FAO hepatoma cells, mutation of all 4 lysine residues (4K-R 
GAPDH) to mimic their unmodified state reduced GAPDH glycolytic activity and 
glycolytic flux and increased gluconeogenic GAPDH activity and glucose 
production. Hepatic expression of 4K-R GAPDH in mice increased GAPDH 
gluconeogenic activity and the contribution of gluconeogenesis to endogenous 
glucose production in the unfed state. Consistent with the increased reliance on 
the energy-consuming gluconeogenic pathway, plasma free fatty acids and ketones 
were elevated in mice expressing 4K-R GAPDH, suggesting enhanced lipolysis and 
hepatic fatty acid oxidation. In normal mice, food withholding and refeeding, as 
well as hormonal regulators of reciprocal glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, such as 
insulin, glucagon, and norepinephrine, had no effect on global GAPDH 
acetylation. However, GAPDH acetylation was reduced in obese and type 2 diabetic 
db/db mice. These findings show that post-translational modification of GAPDH 
lysine residues regulates hepatic and systemic metabolism, revealing an 
unappreciated role for hepatic GAPDH in substrate selection and 
utilization.-Bond, S. T., Howlett, K. F., Kowalski, G. M., Mason, S., Connor,
