The Dishevelled (Dvl) gene family encodes cytoplasmic proteins that are 
necessary for Wnt signal transduction. Utilizing the yeast two-hybrid system, we 
identified protein phosphatase 2Calpha (PP2C) as a Dvl-PDZ domain-interacting 
protein. PP2C exists in a complex with Dvl, beta-catenin, and Axin, a negative 
regulator of Wnt signaling. In a Wnt-responsive LEF-1 reporter gene assay, 
expression of PP2C activates transcription and also elicits a synergistic 
response with beta-catenin and Wnt-1. In addition, PP2C expression relieves 
Axin-mediated repression of LEF-1-dependent transcription. PP2C utilizes Axin as 
a substrate both in vitro and in vivo and decreases its half-life. These results 
indicate that PP2C is a positive regulator of Wnt signal transduction and 
mediates its effects through the dephosphorylation of Axin.
