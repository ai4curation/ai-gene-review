The ras proto-oncogene products appear to relay intracellular signals via the 
Ras guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activator protein, GAP. In dog epithelial 
cells expressing human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors, binding 
of PDGF caused approximately one-tenth of the total GAP molecules to complex 
with the receptor. Studies with mutant PDGF receptors showed that maximum 
association required both receptor kinase activity and phosphorylatable tyrosine 
residues at both the identified sites of receptor autophosphorylation.
