MAGI-2, a multidomain scaffolding protein, contains nine potential 
protein-protein interaction modules, including a GuK domain, two WW domains and 
six PDZ domains. In this study, we examined eight human hepatocarcinoma cell 
lines (HHCCs) and found that MAGI-2 was expressed only in 7721 cells. After 
7721, 7404 and 97H cells were transfected with myc-MAGI-2 plasmid, their 
migration and proliferation was significantly inhibited, which was associated 
with downregulation of p-FAK and p-Akt. It is known that p-FAK is a substrate of 
PTEN and p-Akt can be regulated by PTEN via PIP(3). We demonstrated that PTEN 
was upregulated after myc-MAGI-2 transfection, which was due to the enhancement 
of PTEN protein stability rather than mRNA levels. Furthermore, MAGI-2-induced 
inhibition of cell migration and proliferation was attenuated in 7721 cells with 
PTEN silence or in PTEN-null cell line U87MG, and PTEN transfection could 
restore the effect of MAGI-2 in U87MG cells. Finally, the molecular association 
between PTEN and MAGI-2 was confirmed. Our results suggested that PTEN played a 
critical role in MAGI-2-induced inhibition of cell migration and proliferation 
in HHCCs.
