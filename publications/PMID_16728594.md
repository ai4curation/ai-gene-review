The energy that sustains cancer cells is derived preferentially from glycolysis. 
This metabolic change, the Warburg effect, was one of the first alterations in 
cancer cells recognized as conferring a survival advantage. Here, we show that 
p53, one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancers, modulates the balance 
between the utilization of respiratory and glycolytic pathways. We identify 
Synthesis of Cytochrome c Oxidase 2 (SCO2) as the downstream mediator of this 
effect in mice and human cancer cell lines. SCO2 is critical for regulating the 
cytochrome c oxidase (COX) complex, the major site of oxygen utilization in the 
eukaryotic cell. Disruption of the SCO2 gene in human cancer cells with 
wild-type p53 recapitulated the metabolic switch toward glycolysis that is 
exhibited by p53-deficient cells. That SCO2 couples p53 to mitochondrial 
respiration provides a possible explanation for the Warburg effect and offers 
new clues as to how p53 might affect aging and metabolism.
