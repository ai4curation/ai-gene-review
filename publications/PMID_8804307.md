The SWI/SNF complex in yeast facilitates the function of transcriptional 
activators by opposing chromatin-dependent repression of transcription. We 
demonstrate that in mammals SWI/SNF complexes are present in multiple forms made 
up of 9-12 proteins that we refer to as BRG1-associated factors (BAFs) ranging 
from 47 to 250 kD. We have isolated cDNAs for human BAF155, BAF170, and BAF60. 
BAF155 and BAF170 are encoded by separate genes that are both homologs of yeast 
SWI3. Both contain a region of similarity to the DNA binding domain of myb, but 
lack the basic residues known to be necessary for interaction with DNA. The two 
SWI3 homologs copurify on antibody columns specific for either BAF155 or BAF170, 
indicating that they are in the same complex. BAF60 is encoded by a novel gene 
family. An open reading frame from yeast, which is highly homologous, encodes 
the previously uncharacterized 73-kD subunit of the yeast SWI/SNF complex 
required for transcriptional activation by the glucocorticoid receptor (Cairns 
et al., this issue). BAF60a is expressed in all tissues examined, whereas BAF60b 
and BAF60c are expressed preferentially in muscle and pancreas, respectively. 
BAF60a is present within the 2000-kD BRG1 complex, whereas BAF60b is in a 
distinct complex that shares some but not all subunits with the BRG1 complex. 
The observed similarity between mammalian BAF190, BAF170, BAF155, BAF60, and 
BAF47 and yeast SNF2/SWI2, SWI3, SWI3, SWP73, and SNF5, respectively, 
underscores the similarity of the mammalian and yeast complexes. However, the 
complexes in mammals are more diverse than the SWI/SNF complex in yeast and are 
likely dedicated to developmentally distinct functions.
