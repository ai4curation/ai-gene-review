Previous studies have shown that the mammalian mitochondrial 70 kDa heat-shock 
protein (mortalin) can also be detected in the cytosol. Cytosolic mortalin binds 
p53 and by doing so, prevents translocation of the tumor suppressor into the 
nucleus. In this study, we developed a novel binding assay, using purified 
proteins, for tracking the interaction between p53 and mortalin. Our results 
reveal that: (i) P53 binds to the peptide-binding site of mortalin which 
enhances the ability of the former to bind DNA. (ii) An additional previously 
unknown binding site for mortalin exists within the C-terminal domain of p53.
