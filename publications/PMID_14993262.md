Tid1, a cochaperone of the heat shock 70 protein and the mammalian counterpart 
of the Drosophila tumor suppressor l(2)tid, is critical for early embryonic 
development and cell survival.

Tid1 is the mammalian counterpart of the Drosophila tumor suppressor Tid56 and 
is also a DnaJ protein containing a conserved J domain through which it 
interacts with the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family of chaperone proteins. 
We generated a Tid1 conditional mutation in mice, and the subsequent global 
removal of the Tid1 protein was achieved by crossing these conditional knockout 
mice with general deletor mice. No Tid1(-/-) embryos were detected as early as 
embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5). Nonetheless, Tid1-deficient blastocysts were viable, 
hatched, formed an inner cell mass and trophectoderm, and implanted (E4.5), 
suggesting that the homozygous mutant embryos die between E4.5 and E7.5. To 
assess the function of Tid1 in embryonic cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts with 
the homologous Tid1 floxed allele were produced. Tid1 removal in these cells led 
to massive cell death. The death of Tid1-deficient cells could be rescued by 
ectopic expression of wild-type Tid1 but not by expression of the Tid1 protein 
that had a mutated J domain and was thus incapable of binding to Hsp70. We 
propose that Tid1 is critical for early mammalian development, most likely for 
its function in sustaining embryonic-cell survival, which requires its 
association with Hsp70.
