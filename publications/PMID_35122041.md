Metabolic reprogramming is a core hallmark of cancer but it remains poorly 
defined in hepatocellular carcinogenesis (HCC). Here we show that hepatic 
aldolase B (Aldob) suppresses HCC by directly binding and inhibiting the 
rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (G6PD). A stage-dependent decrease of Aldob and increase of G6PD 
in human tumors are correlated with poor prognosis for patients with HCC. Global 
or liver-specific Aldob knockout promotes tumorigenesis in mice through 
enhancing G6PD activity and pentose phosphate pathway metabolism, whereas 
pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown of G6PD suppresses HCC. 
Consistently, restoration of Aldob in Aldob knockout mice attenuates 
tumorigenesis. We further demonstrate that Aldob potentiates p53-mediated 
inhibition of G6PD in an Aldob-G6PD-p53 complex. This scaffolding effect is 
independent of Aldob enzymatic activity. Together, our study reveals a new mode 
of metabolic reprogramming in HCC due to the loss of Aldob, suggesting a 
potential therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.
