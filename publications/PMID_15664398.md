OBJECTIVE: Foxc2/MFH-1 is a member of the forkhead family of transcription 
factors and Foxc2-deficient mice exhibit aortic arch anomalies (type B 
interruption of the aortic arch). Endothelin receptor type-A (ETA) is one of the 
two known endothelin receptors that belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor 
family. ETA-deficient mice show defects in the great arteries, primarily type B 
interruption of the aortic arch. Based on similar phenotypes in the 
cardiovascular system of Foxc2- and ETA-deficient mice, we investigated whether 
Foxc2 and ETA have a close relationship in aortic arch patterning.
METHODS: The Foxc2 and ETA homozygotes were obtained by crossing the Foxc2 and 
ETA heterozygotes, respectively. The double Foxc2/ETA homozygotes were obtained 
by crossing the double Foxc2/ETA heterozygotes.
RESULTS: We investigated the expression of ETA in Foxc2-null mice and the 
expression of Foxc2 in ETA-null mice and found that the absence of either Foxc2 
or ETA had no effect on the expression of the other. Next, we analyzed mice 
lacking both Foxc2 and ETA to examine the relationship between Foxc2 and ETA on 
aortic arch patterning in vivo. We found that the majority of Foxc2/ETA 
double-mutant embryos died around 11.5 dpc and that all surviving mice had 
persistent truncus arteriosus.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that Foxc2- and ETA-expressing cells additively 
form the aorticopulmonary septum.
