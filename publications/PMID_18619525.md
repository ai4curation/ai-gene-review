Nutrient transporters and ABC efflux pumps at the blood-brain barrier are major 
determinants of drug penetration into the brain. Immunohistochemical analysis of 
transporter subcellular localization is challenging due to the close apposition 
of the luminal and abluminal microvessel plasma membranes. We employed in vivo 
perfusion of biotinylation reagent through rat brain microvessels to 
domain-specifically label proteins exposed on the microvessel luminal surface. 
Using this approach, we analyzed the luminal/abluminal localization of a number 
of blood-brain barrier transporters identified by quantitative PCR profiling as 
being highly expressed and enriched in rat brain endothelial cells compared with 
whole brain. We also examined the apical/basal-lateral distribution of 
transporters in the choroid plexus, a secondary site for transport of nutrients 
between the blood and CNS. We detected P-glycoprotein (Pgp) (Abcb1), ATP-binding 
cassette (Abc) g2, multidrug resistance protein (Mrp) 4 (Abcc4), glucose 
transporter 1 (Glut1) (Slc2a1), Lat1 (Slc7a5), and monocarboxylate transporter-1 
(Mct1) (Slc16a1) on the luminal surface of rat cerebral microvessels by both 
immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting of in vivo biotinylated 
proteins. Mrp1 (Abcc1) appeared primarily abluminal by immunofluorescence 
staining, and was barely detectable in the biotinylated protein fraction. 
Organic anion transporter (Oat) 3 (Slc22a8), organic anion transporter 
polypeptide (Oatp) 2b1 (Slco2b1, Oatpb), and Mrp5 (Abcc5) were not detected on 
the luminal surface using either method, while Oatp1a4 (Slco1a4, Oatp2) appeared 
to partially localize to the microvessel lumen by immunofluorescence staining, 
but was not detected in the biotinylated protein fraction by Western blotting. 
Lat1, Mrp1 and Mrp4 were detected on the basal-lateral surface of lateral 
ventricle choroid plexus epithelial cells. Mrp5, Oct3 and Oatp2b1 (Oatpb) were 
detected in the ependymal cells lining the ventricle. We did not detect Pgp 
expression in choroid plexus by immunofluorescence staining. In vivo 
biotinylation provides a method for domain-specific labeling of luminal surface 
proteins within the capillaries of the blood-brain barrier, allowing for 
biochemical analysis of protein localization and facilitating optical 
discrimination of the luminal and abluminal endothelial surfaces.
