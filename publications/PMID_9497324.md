Up to 90% of circulating insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) are 
carried in heterotrimeric complexes with a binding protein (IGFBP) and a 
liver-derived glycoprotein known as the acid-labile subunit. IGFBP-3 is 
considered unique among the six well characterized IGFBPs in its ability to 
complex with the acid-labile subunit. However, a basic carboxyl-terminal domain 
of IGFBP-3, known to be involved in its interaction with the acid-labile 
subunit, is shared by IGFBP-5, suggesting the possibility of ternary complexes 
containing IGFBP-5. We now demonstrate using three independent methods that 
human IGFBP-5, when occupied by IGF-I or IGF-II, forms ternary complexes of 
approximately 130 kDa with the acid-labile subunit. IGFBP-3 competes with 
approximately twice the potency of IGFBP-5 for the formation of such complexes. 
No other IGFBP complexes with the acid-labile subunit itself or competes with 
IGFBP-5 for complex formation. As observed for IGFBP-3, ternary complexes 
containing IGFBP-5 form preferentially in the presence of IGF-I, even though 
IGFBP-5 has a preferential affinity for IGF-II over IGF-I. By size fractionation 
chromatography, serum IGFBP-5 co-elutes predominantly with ternary complexes. 
The demonstration of IGFBP-5-containing ternary complexes indicates an 
unrecognized form of IGF transport in the circulation and an additional 
mechanism for regulating IGF bioavailability.
