PD (Parkinson's disease) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. 
Mutations in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) gene are linked to the most 
common inherited and sporadic PD. Overexpression of LRRK2 and its mutants could 
induce mitochondrial-dependent neuronal apoptosis. However, the underlying 
mechanism remains elusive. We have identified several novel LRRK2 interacting 
proteins and showed that LRRK2 can interact with three components of the PTPC 
(permeability transition pore complex) including ANT (adenine nucleotide 
translocator), VDAC (voltage-dependent anion channel) and uMtCK [ubiquitous MtCK 
(mitochondrial creatine kinase)]. Those components have been reported to be 
involved in the permeability of mitochondrial membrane. We provide evidence that 
LRRK2 is likely to interact with uMtCK directly and expression of LRRK2 and its 
mutant form can suppress the processing of the immature form of uMtCK. LRRK2 
expression keeps the uMtCK preprotein on the outer mitochondrial membrane 
instead of entering the mitochondria. In addition, the expression of both 
wild-type and mutant forms of LRRK2 promotes the interaction between ANT and 
VDAC, which plays a role in permeabilization transition pore opening. Finally, 
LRRK2-induced cell death can be suppressed by uMtCK. Our findings imply that 
LRRK2 can interact directly with uMtCK to block its entry into mitochondria and 
its subsequent processing, resulting in inhibition of mitochondrial energy 
channelling. Meanwhile, the decrease of uMtCK in mitochondria results in 
elevated interaction between ANT and VDAC and leads to neuronal apoptosis. Thus, 
our study provides the rational for clinical trials using creatine to treat PD 
and supports the notion of exploiting LRRK2 as a drug target for PD.
