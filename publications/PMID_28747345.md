The genetic association of orosomucoid-like 3 (ORMDL3) with an array of 
immunoinflammatory disorders has been recently unraveled in multiple ethnic 
groups, and functional exploration has received attention of the particular 
relevance of this gene in endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipid metabolism, and 
inflammatory response. In this study, we demonstrated the upregulation of ORMDL3 
in both patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus mice compared with 
controls. By establishing ORMDL3 knockout mice (Ormdl3-/-), we showed that 
silencing Ormdl3 in vivo significantly decreased the proportions of mature B 
lymphocytes and transitional 2B cells in spleen and B1a cells from abdominal 
cavity perfusion fluid, the secretion of IgG and IgM, and the expression of 
Baff. Additionally, knockdown of Ormdl3 augmented the apoptosis of total splenic 
cells and splenic CD19+ B cells but did not affect B cell proliferation and cell 
cycle. Subsequently, we in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that ORMDL3 
potentially mediates the autophagy via the ATF 6-Beclin1 autophagy pathway, and 
it facilitates the survival of splenic B cells via promoting autophagy and 
suppressing apoptosis. Taken together, we uncovered a role of ORMDL3 in 
fine-tuning B cell development and survival, besides highlighting a potential 
mechanism by which ORMDL3 regulates autophagy via ATF6 pathway.
