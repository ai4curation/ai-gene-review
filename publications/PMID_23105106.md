The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway remodels 
membranes during multivesicular body biogenesis, the abscission stage of 
cytokinesis, and enveloped virus budding. The ESCRT-III and VPS4 ATPase 
complexes catalyze the membrane fission events associated with these processes, 
and the LIP5 protein helps regulate their interactions by binding directly to a 
subset of ESCRT-III proteins and to VPS4. We have investigated the biochemical 
and structural basis for different LIP5-ligand interactions and show that the 
first microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) module of the tandem LIP5 
MIT domain binds CHMP1B (and other ESCRT-III proteins) through canonical type 1 
MIT-interacting motif (MIM1) interactions. In contrast, the second LIP5 MIT 
module binds with unusually high affinity to a novel MIM element within the 
ESCRT-III protein CHMP5. A solution structure of the relevant LIP5-CHMP5 complex 
reveals that CHMP5 helices 5 and 6 and adjacent linkers form an amphipathic 
"leucine collar" that wraps almost completely around the second LIP5 MIT module 
but makes only limited contacts with the first MIT module. LIP5 binds 
MIM1-containing ESCRT-III proteins and CHMP5 and VPS4 ligands independently in 
vitro, but these interactions are coupled within cells because formation of 
stable VPS4 complexes with both LIP5 and CHMP5 requires LIP5 to bind both a 
MIM1-containing ESCRT-III protein and CHMP5. Our studies thus reveal how the 
tandem MIT domain of LIP5 binds different types of ESCRT-III proteins, promoting 
assembly of active VPS4 enzymes on the polymeric ESCRT-III substrate.

Our studies thus reveal how the tandem MIT domain of LIP5 binds different types of ESCRT-III proteins, promoting assembly of active VPS4 enzymes on the polymeric ESCRT-III substrate.

Introduction

The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) 3 pathway mediates membrane remodeling and fission events required for intraluminal vesicle formation at multivesicular bodies, the abscission stage of cytokinesis, and the budding of many enveloped viruses, including HIV-1 (reviewed in Refs. 1 – 9 ). ESCRT factors are recruited to their different sites of action by sequential protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions that are initiated by membrane-specific adaptors such as the HRS-STAM complex (multivesicular body vesicle formation), CEP55 (cytokinesis), and retroviral Gag proteins (virus budding). These adaptors then bind and recruit early-acting ESCRT factors such as ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, and ALIX, which in turn recruit downstream ESCRT-III and VPS4 ATPase complexes.

The actual membrane fission events appear to be catalyzed by the concerted activities of the ESCRT-III and VPS4 complexes. Humans express 12 related ESCRT-III-like proteins, which can be subdivided into eight different subfamilies, termed CHMP1–7 ( ch arged m ultivesicular body p roteins 1–7 ) and IST1. The CHMP1, CHMP2, and CHMP4 subfamilies each have multiple related members, which carry letter designations (CHMP1A and CHMP1B, etc.). The different ESCRT-III subunits share a common architecture, comprising a conserved core domain that mediates membrane binding and filament formation and a C-terminal tail that can either fold back on the core to autoinhibit polymerization or open to expose protein-binding sites (reviewed in Ref. 10 ). The core domain is a four-helix bundle consisting of a long helical hairpin and two smaller helices that pack against the open end of the hairpin ( 10 – 13 ). The C-terminal tails can vary considerably in sequence and length but commonly contain sequence elements termed microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT)-interacting motifs (MIMs) that can bind the MIT domains found in VPS4 and many other ESCRT-III-associated proteins (reviewed in Ref. 14 ). Although the mechanistic details remain to be determined, current models generally posit that ESCRT-III proteins form membrane-bound filaments that recruit other cofactors and draw opposing membranes together to promote fission ( 15 – 17 ).

The energy for ESCRT-mediated vesicle formation is ultimately provided by the VPS4 ATPase, which is expressed as a single protein in yeast (Vps4p) and two related VPS4 proteins in humans and other mammals (VPS4A and VPS4B/SKD1) (reviewed in Ref. 18 ). VPS4 ATPases function late in the ESCRT pathway to release assembled ESCRT-III subunits from the membrane ( 19 – 22 ). VPS4 enzymes arrive immediately prior to the membrane fission step of virus budding and abscission ( 8 , 23 – 26 ) and may play an active role in the fission process, possibly by remodeling or reorganizing the membrane-bound ESCRT-III filaments. Like other AAA ( A TPases a ssociated with diverse cellular a ctivites) ATPases, VPS4 proteins can form hexameric rings, and the active enzyme appears to be a single-ring hexamer, 4 although double-ring dodecamers and other higher order oligomeric assemblies can also form in vitro ( 19 , 27 – 31 ). Each VPS4 subunit comprises an N-terminal MIT domain, an ATPase cassette that contains canonical large and small AAA-ATPase domains, and a β-domain that is inserted within the small ATPase domain. The MIT domain binds MIM elements within different ESCRT-III substrates, the AAA-ATPase cassette mediates nucleotide hydrolysis and ring formation, and the three-stranded sheet of the β-domain interacts with the activator protein LIP5 (yeast Vta1p) ( 18 ).

ESCRT assembly and activities are regulated at multiple different stages, but VPS4 recruitment, assembly, and activation appear to be a particularly important regulatory node. VPS4 enzymes are recruited to their sites of action, at least in part, by binding to a variety of different and often partially redundant MIM elements that are exposed upon ESCRT-III filament formation ( 19 , 32 – 38 ). In addition to these general ESCRT-III interactions, two binary complexes, CHMP1-IST1 and LIP5-CHMP5, play particularly important roles in VPS4 recruitment and activation. CHMP1 (yeast Vps46p/Did2p) and IST1 (Ist1p) bind one another and help recruit VPS4 to sites of action ( 12 , 13 , 33 , 39 – 43 ). LIP5/Vta1p stimulates VPS4 oligomerization and ATPase activity in vitro and in vivo ( 28 , 34 , 40 , 43 – 49 ) and makes a particularly high affinity interaction with CHMP5 (yeast Vps60p) ( 44 , 50 ). These two complexes appear to act synergistically because they exhibit synthetic multivesicular body sorting phenotypes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( 51 , 52 ). Moreover, the tandem MIT domains within LIP5 can bind MIM elements within both CHMP1 and IST1, implying that the complexes probably interact directly in cells ( 12 , 33 , 34 , 41 , 42 ).

Comprehensive genetic and biochemical studies in yeast have provided a model for Vps4p cofactor recruitment in which the protein is initially present in the cytoplasm as a lower order multimer (either a monomer or dimer) that is recruited to core ESCRT-III polymers with the help of the Did2p-Ist1p complex. This assembly then recruits Vta1p, which helps to promote assembly of the active Vps4p enzyme ( 33 ). It is not yet clear precisely how Vps60p/CHMP5 fits into this scheme, but a leading model is that Vps60p acts through Vta1p very late in the process to help stimulate Vps4p to recycle ESCRT components back into the cytoplasm ( 34 ). Consistent with this idea, recombinant Vps60p can stimulate Vps4p ATPase activity in a Vta1p-dependent fashion. Vta1p is required for Vps60p endosomal localization, but the converse is not true, and indeed, Vps60p antagonizes Vta1p endosomal localization ( 34 ). In mammalian cells, however, CHMP5 and LIP5 form stable complexes in the cytoplasm, and the two proteins are therefore likely to be recruited together in this case ( 53 ). CHMP5 activities appear to be more important for some ESCRT-dependent processes than others because siRNA depletion of CHMP5 inhibits multivesicular body sorting, but does not inhibit HIV-1 budding ( 44 ).

A remarkably complex network of different MIM-MIT interactions plays a critical role in recruiting different effector proteins to the surface of polymerized ESCRT-III filaments. The 12 different human ESCRT-III subunits contain distinct classes of MIMs that can be displayed singly (as in CHMP5) ( 34 , 50 ) or in tandem (as in IST1) ( 42 ) and can even bind differently to different MIT domains (as in CHMP1B) ( 36 , 54 ). Moreover, humans express more than a dozen different MIT domain-containing proteins ( 14 , 55 – 57 ), whose MIT domains can be arrayed either singly (as in VPS4 enzymes) or in tandem (as in LIP5) ( 58 ). Although MIT domains are simple three-helix bundles ( 59 , 60 ), they can engage their MIM ligands in a variety of different ways. To date, four different classes of MIM elements have been characterized structurally: MIM1 motifs form short amphipathic helices that bind in the groove between MIT helices 2 and 3 ( 35 , 36 ), MIM2 motifs are extended strands that bind in the groove between MIT helices 1 and 3 ( 37 , 61 ), MIM3 motifs are longer amphipathic helices that bind in the same groove ( 54 ), and MIM4 motifs are related to MIM1 motifs but form a more extended helix and make more polar interactions ( 62 ). In all of these cases, the MIM ligand binds along a MIT groove in an orientation that is parallel to the first MIT helix. Despite these advances in our understanding of the molecular basis for specific MIM-MIT interactions, we do not yet have a complete inventory of all possible MIM-MIT interactions or a full understanding of the “code” that dictates how different MIMs select their specific MIT domain-binding partners.

LIP5 performs its central regulatory function within the ESCRT pathway by binding ESCRT-III proteins through its N-terminal tandem MIT domain and by binding VPS4 ATPases through its C-terminal VSL ( V ta1/ S BP1/ L IP5) domain (see Fig. 1 A ) ( 45 , 48 ). These interactions allow LIP5 to coordinate ESCRT-III and VPS4 activities both during normal cellular homeostasis and also apparently in response to interferon signaling during innate immune responses. In the latter case, Leis and co-workers ( 63 , 64 ) have reported that covalent modification of CHMP5 and other ESCRT-III proteins with the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 blocks the LIP5-CHMP5 and LIP5-VPS4 interactions and thereby inhibits enveloped viruses from using the ESCRT pathway to bud from cells. To define better how LIP5 can mediate its different regulatory functions, we have characterized how LIP5 interacts with CHMP5 and other ESCRT-III proteins and determined the interdependence of different LIP5-ligand interactions both in vitro and in cells.

DISCUSSION

Like many other cellular machines that must function transiently, the ESCRT pathway is tightly regulated to ensure that the machinery localizes to correct sites of action, forms properly, and assembles and disassembles with “all or none” behavior. ESCRT regulation occurs at a number of different steps and via a number of different mechanisms, including the use of membrane-specific adaptor proteins, ordered protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions, post-translational modifications such as ubiquitylation and phosphorylation, autoinhibition, allostery, and avidity ( 1 – 9 ). VPS4 activation is one of the highly regulated steps in the ESCRT pathway and is governed primarily by the actions of the activator protein LIP5. LIP5 comprises two well ordered domains: a tandem MIT domain at the N terminus and a VSL dimerization domain at the C terminus, separated by a disordered linker region of ∼100 residues ( Fig. 1 ) ( 58 ). Our analyses have helped to reveal how LIP5 connects VPS4 to the ESCRT-III lattice by demonstrating that the tandem LIP5 MIT domain must make two different types of interactions with CHMP5 and CHMP1B (and/or other ESCRT-III proteins) in order for LIP5 and CHMP5 to form precipitable cellular complexes with VPS4. We did not find any evidence that the VSL and MIT domains of LIP5 communicate directly ( e.g. Figs. 5 and 9 ). Rather, our data support a model in which multiple weak ligand interactions, together with avidity effects resulting from LIP5 dimerization, cooperate to recruit LIP5 to oligomeric ESCRT-III assemblies and activate VPS4 at the proper time and place.
