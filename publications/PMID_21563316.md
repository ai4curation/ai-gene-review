Presynaptic terminals maintain neurotransmitter release during repeated rounds 
of stimulation using local recycling of synaptic vesicles (SV). During each SV 
cycle, protein complex assembly and disassembly results in accumulation of 
inactive (unfolded) protein intermediates that may render synaptic terminals 
vulnerable to activity-dependent degeneration. SV trafficking is affected in 
many neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer' and Parkinson's disease 
(PD) suggesting that alteration of this process might be an important aspect of 
disease pathogenesis. This article reviews our current understanding for a role 
of causative PD genes in the SV cycle and speculates on the potential role of 
aberrant SV trafficking in the neurodegenerative cascade of PD.
