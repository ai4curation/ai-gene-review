HER2 plays an important role in breast cancer progression and provides 
predictive and prognostic information. HER2 receptor family members function 
through dimerisation, which can lead to impact on cell function, growth and 
differentiation; however, their value in breast cancer development remains to be 
defined. This study aims to examine the relationships of HER2 heterodimers to 
breast cancer characteristics in trastuzumab na√Øve and treated cases. HER2 
protein (IHC), HER2 gene (chromogenic ISH) and HER2 heterodimerisation status 
[chromogenic in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA)] were assessed in two breast 
cancer series prepared in tissue microarray (TMA) format. A range of 
signals/cell for each HER2 heterodimer was detected (0-34.6 signals/cell). The 
vast majority of cases with HER2 heterodimers showed HER2 gene amplification 
and/or protein expression. There was an association between HER2 dimerisation 
with HER3 and HER4 and their protein expression level but no such association 
was found in with HER1 (EGFR). Of the HER2+ cases, 74, 66, and 58 % showed 
heterodimers with EGFR, HER3 and HER4, respectively. 51 % of HER2+ tumours 
expressed all three heterodimers whereas 23 % of the cases did not show 
expression of any of the three heterodimers. There was an inverse association 
between the presence and levels of HER2 heterodimers and hormone receptor 
expression in HER2+ tumours. Tumours exhibiting high levels of HER2 heterodimers 
demonstrated aggressive clinicopathological features and poor outcome. In the 
HER2+ cases, dimerisation with EGFR and HER3 but not with HER4 showed an 
association with aggressive features. There was no association between HER2 
heterodimers with patient breast cancer-specific survival or recurrence in HER2+ 
breast cancer in those patients receiving trastuzumab or not. Our results 
demonstrate that HER2 dimerisation is a complex process that may underlie the 
biological heterogeneity of HER2 positive tumours and may identify patients 
suitable for a specific targeted therapy but does not predict patient outcome 
for those receiving trastuzumab. PLA proved to be a useful tool for detecting, 
visualising and quantifying the frequency of protein-protein interactions in 
archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples.
