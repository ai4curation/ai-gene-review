A full-length cDNA clone for sepiapterin reductase, an enzyme involved in 
tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis, was isolated from a human liver cDNA library 
by plaque hybridization. The nucleotide sequence of hSPR 8-25, which contained 
an entire coding region of the enzyme, was determined. The clone encoded a 
protein of 261 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 28,047 daltons. 
The predicted amino acid sequence of human sepiapterin reductase showed a 74% 
identity with the rat enzyme. We further found a striking homology between human 
SPR and carbonyl reductase, estradiol 17 beta-dehydrogenase, and 3 
beta-hydroxy-5-ene steroid dehydrogenase, especially in their N-terminal region.
