An important theme in molecular cell biology is the regulation of protein 
recruitment to the plasma membrane. Fundamental biological processes such as 
proliferation, differentiation or leukocyte functions are initiated and 
controlled through the reversible binding of signaling proteins to 
phosphorylated membrane components. This is mediated by specialized interaction 
modules, such as SH2 and PH domains. Cytohesin-1 is an intracellular guanine 
nucleotide exchange factor, which regulates leukocyte adhesion. The activity of 
cytohesin-1 is controlled by phospho inositide-dependent membrane recruitment. 
An interacting protein was identified, the expression of which is upregulated by 
cytokines in hematopoietic cells. This molecule, CYTIP, is also recruited to the 
cell cortex by integrin signaling via its PDZ domain. However, stimulation of 
Jurkat cells with phorbol ester results in re-localization of CYTIP to the 
cytoplasm, and membrane detachment of cytohesin-1 strictly requires 
co-expression of CYTIP. Consequently, stimulated adhesion of Jurkat cells to 
intracellular adhesion molecule-1 is repressed by CYTIP. These findings outline 
a novel mechanism of signal chain abrogation through sequestration of a limiting 
component by specific protein-protein interactions.
