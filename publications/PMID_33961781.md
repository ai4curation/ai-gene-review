Thousands of interactions assemble proteins into modules that impart spatial and 
functional organization to the cellular proteome. Through affinity-purification 
mass spectrometry, we have created two proteome-scale, cell-line-specific 
interaction networks. The first, BioPlex 3.0, results from affinity purification 
of 10,128 human proteins-half the proteome-in 293T cells and includes 118,162 
interactions among 14,586 proteins. The second results from 5,522 
immunoprecipitations in HCT116 cells. These networks model the interactome whose 
structure encodes protein function, localization, and complex membership. 
Comparison across cell lines validates thousands of interactions and reveals 
extensive customization. Whereas shared interactions reside in core complexes 
and involve essential proteins, cell-specific interactions link these complexes, 
"rewiring" subnetworks within each cell's interactome. Interactions covary among 
proteins of shared function as the proteome remodels to produce each cell's 
phenotype. Viewable interactively online through BioPlexExplorer, these networks 
define principles of proteome organization and enable unknown protein 
characterization.

Thousands of interactions assemble proteins into modules that impart spatial and functional organization to the cellular proteome. Through affinity-purification mass spectrometry, we have created two proteome-scale, cell-line-specific interaction networks. The first, BioPlex 3.0, results from affinity purification of 10,128 human proteins – half the proteome – in 293T cells and includes 118,162 interactions among 14,586 proteins. The second results from 5,522 immunoprecipitations in HCT116 cells. These networks model the interactome whose structure encodes protein function, localization, and complex membership. Comparison across cell lines validates thousands of interactions and reveals extensive customization. While shared interactions reside in core complexes and involve essential proteins, cell-specific interactions link these complexes, ‘rewiring’ subnetworks within each cell’s interactome. Interactions covary among proteins of shared function as the proteome remodels to produce each cell’s phenotype. Viewable interactively online through BioPlexExplorer, these networks define principles of proteome organization and enable unknown protein characterization.

Comparative analysis of large scale protein-protein interactions across two cell lines highlights context-specific interactions and proteome-scale shifts in how functional networks are arranged.
