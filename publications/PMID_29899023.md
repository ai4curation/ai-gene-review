Germline mutations involving small mothers against decapentaplegic-transforming 
growth factor-β (SMAD-TGF-β) signaling are an important but rare cause of 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is a disease characterized, in 
part, by vascular fibrosis and hyperaldosteronism (ALDO). We developed and 
analyzed a fibrosis protein-protein network (fibrosome) in silico, which 
predicted that the SMAD3 target neural precursor cell expressed developmentally 
down-regulated 9 (NEDD9) is a critical ALDO-regulated node underpinning 
pathogenic vascular fibrosis. Bioinformatics and microscale thermophoresis 
demonstrated that oxidation of Cys18 in the SMAD3 docking region of NEDD9 
impairs SMAD3-NEDD9 protein-protein interactions in vitro. This effect was 
reproduced by ALDO-induced oxidant stress in cultured human pulmonary artery 
endothelial cells (HPAECs), resulting in impaired NEDD9 proteolytic degradation, 
increased NEDD9 complex formation with Nk2 homeobox 5 (NKX2-5), and increased 
NKX2-5 binding to COL3A1 Up-regulation of NEDD9-dependent collagen III 
expression corresponded to changes in cell stiffness measured by atomic force 
microscopy. HPAEC-derived exosomal signaling targeted NEDD9 to increase collagen 
I/III expression in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, identifying a 
second endothelial mechanism regulating vascular fibrosis. ALDO-NEDD9 signaling 
was not affected by treatment with a TGF-β ligand trap and, thus, was not 
contingent on TGF-β signaling. Colocalization of NEDD9 with collagen III in 
HPAECs was observed in fibrotic pulmonary arterioles from PAH patients. 
Furthermore, NEDD9 ablation or inhibition prevented fibrotic vascular remodeling 
and pulmonary hypertension in animal models of PAH in vivo. These data identify 
a critical TGF-β-independent posttranslational modification that impairs 
SMAD3-NEDD9 binding in HPAECs to modulate vascular fibrosis and promote PAH.
