CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) is a negative regulator of 
photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. COP1 functions as an E3 ubiquitin 
ligase, targeting select proteins for proteasomal degradation in plants as well 
as in mammals. Among its substrates is the basic domain/leucine zipper (bZIP) 
transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5), one of the key regulators of 
photomorphogenesis under all light qualities, including UV-B responses required 
for tolerance to this environmental threat. Here, we report that, in contrast 
with the situation in visible light, COP1 is a critical positive regulator of 
responses to low levels of UV-B. We show that in the cop1-4 mutant, flavonoid 
accumulation and genome-wide expression changes in response to UV-B are blocked 
to a large extent. COP1 is required for HY5 gene activation, and both COP1 and 
HY5 proteins accumulate in the nucleus under supplementary UV-B. SUPPRESSOR OF 
PHYTOCHROME A-105 family proteins (SPA1 to SPA4) that are required for COP1 
function in dark and visible light are not essential in the response to UV-B. We 
conclude that COP1 performs a specific and novel role in the plants' 
photomorphogenic response to UV-B, coordinating HY5-dependent and -independent 
pathways, which eventually results in UV-B tolerance.

CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) is a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana . COP1 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting select proteins for proteasomal degradation in plants as well as in mammals. Among its substrates is the basic domain/leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5), one of the key regulators of photomorphogenesis under all light qualities, including UV-B responses required for tolerance to this environmental threat.

We show that in the cop1-4 mutant, flavonoid accumulation and genome-wide expression changes in response to UV-B are blocked to a large extent.

INTRODUCTION

Living organisms have to face exposure to sunlight containing part of the UV-B spectrum (UV-B; 280 to 315 nm), which on the surface of the Earth encompasses the wavelength range above ∼290 nm. To adapt optimally to light and to cope with its UV-B component, sessile plants evolved a variety of photoreceptors. The blue and red/far-red range of the visible solar spectrum is monitored by cryptochrome, phototropin, and phytochrome photoreceptors (e.g., Chen et al., 2004 ), but no photoreceptor(s) specialized to sensing UV-B radiation has yet been identified at the molecular level in plants or any other organism. However, in contrast with animals, for plants, UV-B irradiation is not a mere stress signal but can also serve as an environmental stimulus to direct growth and development ( Kim et al., 1998 ; Boccalandro et al., 2001 ; Kliebenstein et al., 2002 ; Brosche and Strid, 2003 ; Frohnmeyer and Staiger, 2003 ; Paul and Gwynn-Jones, 2003 ; Suesslin and Frohnmeyer, 2003 ; Ulm and Nagy, 2005 ). This includes hypocotyl growth inhibition, flavonoid accumulation, and specific gene expression changes. A rather well-characterized gene activated by low levels of UV-B is CHALCONE SYNTHASE ( CHS ), encoding a key enzyme of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis ( Jenkins et al., 2001 ). On a genome-wide level, recent array analyses for plant responses to UV-B radiation identified a broad range of activated and repressed genes that may now be linked to UV-B responses (e.g., Casati and Walbot, 2004 ; Ulm et al., 2004 ; Ulm and Nagy, 2005 ). On the other hand, genetic insight into players regulating these gene expression changes and physiological responses is rather limited. The UV-B light insensitive ( uli ) mutants exhibited reduced hypocotyl growth inhibition and CHS gene expression compared with wild-type seedlings after exposure to UV-B ( Suesslin and Frohnmeyer, 2003 ). The ULI3 gene is predicted to encode a protein with homology to human diacylglycerol kinases but lacking the conserved kinase domain; thus, its exact biochemical function remains to be determined ( Suesslin and Frohnmeyer, 2003 ). Recently, using whole-genome expression profiling, we provided evidence for the existence of a specific pathway mediating transcriptional responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to low-level UV-B ( Ulm et al., 2004 ). This pathway does not require known photoreceptors but involves ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) ( Ulm et al., 2004 ), a basic domain/leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor mediating a number of red and blue light photoreceptor-controlled physiological responses ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ; Chen et al., 2004 ). The UV resistance locus8 ( uvr8 ) mutation blocks gene activation, including HY5 and CHS , and induction of flavonoid biosynthesis by UV-B, resulting in UV-B hypersensitivity ( Kliebenstein et al., 2002 ; Brown et al., 2005 ). The UVR8 gene encodes a protein with sequence similarity to the human guanine nucleotide exchange factor REGULATOR OF CHROMATIN CONDENSATION1 ( Kliebenstein et al., 2002 ). Recently, it was shown that UVR8 binds histones and is associated with the HY5 promoter region in vivo ( Brown et al., 2005 ).

The discovery of a HY5 function in UV-B–regulated gene expression indicated that part of the general photomorphogenesis program may contribute to the morphogenic UV-B response. In the dark, the HY5 protein is turned over in the nucleus by the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), a crucial repressor of light signaling ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ; Saijo et al., 2003 ). In the light, activation of photoreceptors leads to the inactivation and nuclear exclusion of COP1, allowing HY5 stabilization and activation of light-responsive genes ( von Arnim and Deng, 1994 ; Osterlund et al., 2000 ). Early inactivation of COP1 by visible light occurs most likely through direct interaction with phytochromes and cryptochromes, but in a still unknown molecular fashion ( Wang et al., 2001 ; Yang et al., 2001 ; Seo et al., 2004 ). Mutational analysis indicates that nuclear exclusion of COP1 is a rate-limiting step for the establishment of photomorphogenic development ( Subramanian et al., 2004 ). cop1 mutants display light-grown phenotypes even in complete darkness, including short hypocotyls, open cotyledons, and elevated pigment levels. This constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype exemplifies the COP1 function as a negative regulator of light signaling. In addition to HY5, COP1 was shown to target two other photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription factors, LONG AFTER FAR-RED LIGHT1 and LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED1 (HFR1), and the photoreceptor phytochrome A for ubiquitination and proteolysis ( Seo et al., 2003 , 2004 ; Duek et al., 2004 ; Jang et al., 2005 ; Yang et al., 2005 ).

COP1 consists of three functional domains: a RING finger required for ligase activity, a coiled-coil for dimerization, and a WD40 repeat domain implicated in the binding of target proteins, such as HY5 ( Yi and Deng, 2005 ). Similarly, in mammals (including humans), the COP1 homolog targets bZIP transcription factors of the Jun family and the transcriptional activator p53 for degradation ( Dornan et al., 2004a ; Wertz et al., 2004 ). Moreover, a role of mammalian COP1 in tumorigenesis was recently suggested ( Dornan et al., 2004b ). However, as yet no genetic data link mammalian COP1 to a specific response in vivo.

In Arabidopsis , the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the COP1 complex was recently proposed to be supported by direct interaction with the COP9 signalosome and the CDD (for COP10, DDB1, DET1) complexes ( Yanagawa et al., 2004 ). These three complexes are defined by the COP / DET / FUS group of genes that share the cop phenotypes when mutated (e.g., Hoecker, 2005 ; Yi and Deng, 2005 ). Moreover, COP1-mediated suppression of photomorphogenesis was recently shown to require the plant-specific SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME A-105 (SPA) proteins SPA1 to SPA4 ( Laubinger et al., 2004 ). The SPA proteins contain a kinase-like domain, a coiled-coil, and a COP1-like WD40 repeat domain. All SPA proteins were found to interact with COP1 through the coiled-coil domains ( Laubinger et al., 2004 ; Hoecker, 2005 ), and SPA1 was found to alter the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of COP1 ( Saijo et al., 2003 ; Seo et al., 2003 ). In agreement with these results, it was previously reported that COP1 acts as part of a large protein complex and interacts with SPA1 in a light-dependent manner ( Saijo et al., 2003 ). Most strikingly, it was found that the quadruple spa mutant exhibits strong cop phenotypes almost indistinguishable from cop1 mutants ( Laubinger et al., 2004 ). Thus, these COP1 regulatory factors seem to have an essential influence on COP1 activity as repressor of light signaling.

Here, we demonstrate a crucial role of COP1 as positive regulator of the photomorphogenic UV-B response in Arabidopsis , in contrast with its repressor function in visible light–induced photomorphogenesis. Interestingly, this role of COP1 in the UV-B response is independent of SPA proteins. Moreover, COP1 requirements in UV-B and visible light signaling pathways can be separated in different cop1 mutant alleles, indicating different structural requirements. We also show that in response to supplementary UV-B, COP1 is required for the activation of HY5 gene expression, and both proteins accumulate in the nucleus. These two key regulators of photomorphogenesis are thus endowed with a specialized function for UV-B–induced signaling.

DISCUSSION

This study identified COP1 as a crucial promoter of the photomorphogenic UV-B response in Arabidopsis . We show that physiological and molecular UV-B responses are impaired in cop1 mutants and that COP1 accumulates in the nucleus under UV-B. At least part of the UV-B function of COP1 seems to involve HY5, a previously identified positive regulator of UV-B–induced gene expression ( Ulm et al., 2004 ; Brown et al., 2005 ). Our observations are in sharp contrast with the expectation of a negative regulatory role for COP1 in the control of HY5 protein level as occurs in the dark and in visible light and suggest a different type of relationship between these two proteins in UV-B signaling, with COP1 partly acting through HY5.
