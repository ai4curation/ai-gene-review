Ssn6-Tup1 regulates multiple genes in yeast, providing a paradigm for 
corepressor functions. Tup1 interacts directly with histones H3 and H4, and 
mutation of these histones synergistically compromises Ssn6-Tup1-mediated 
repression. In vitro, Tup1 interacts preferentially with underacetylated 
isoforms of H3 and H4, suggesting that histone acetylation may modulate Tup1 
functions in vivo. Here we report that histone hyperacetylation caused by 
combined mutations in genes encoding the histone deacetylases (HDACs) Rpd3, 
Hos1, and Hos2 abolishes Ssn6-Tup1 repression. Unlike HDAC mutations that do not 
affect repression, this combination of mutations causes concomitant 
hyperacetylation of both H3 and H4. Strikingly, two of these class I HDACs 
interact physically with Ssn6-Tup1. These findings suggest that Ssn6-Tup1 
actively recruits deacetylase activities to deacetylate adjacent nucleosomes and 
promote Tup1-histone interactions.
