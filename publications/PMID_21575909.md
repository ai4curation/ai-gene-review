Selective autophagy of bacterial pathogens represents a host innate immune 
mechanism. Selective autophagy has been characterized on the basis of distinct 
cargo receptors but the mechanisms by which different cargo receptors are 
targeted for autophagic degradation remain unclear. In this study we identified 
a highly conserved Tectonin domain-containing protein, Tecpr1, as an Atg5 
binding partner that colocalized with Atg5 at Shigella-containing phagophores. 
Tecpr1 activity is necessary for efficient autophagic targeting of bacteria, but 
has no effect on rapamycin- or starvation-induced canonical autophagy. Tecpr1 
interacts with WIPI-2, a yeast Atg18 homolog and PI(3)P-interacting protein 
required for phagophore formation, and they colocalize to phagophores. Although 
Tecpr1-deficient mice appear normal, Tecpr1-deficient MEFs were defective for 
selective autophagy and supported increased intracellular multiplication of 
Shigella. Further, depolarized mitochondria and misfolded protein aggregates 
accumulated in the Tecpr1-knockout MEFs. Thus, we identify a Tecpr1-dependent 
pathway as important in targeting bacterial pathogens for selective autophagy.
