Reversible phosphorylation is a fundamental regulatory mechanism, intricately 
coordinated by kinases and phosphatases, two classes of enzymes widely disrupted 
in human disease. To better understand the functions of the relatively 
understudied phosphatases, we have used complementary affinity purification and 
proximity-based interaction proteomics approaches to generate a physical 
interactome for 140 human proteins harboring phosphatase catalytic domains. We 
identified 1,335 high-confidence interactions (1,104 previously unreported), 
implicating these phosphatases in the regulation of a variety of cellular 
processes. Systematic phenotypic profiling of phosphatase catalytic and 
regulatory subunits revealed that phosphatases from every evolutionary family 
impinge on mitosis. Using clues from the interactome, we have uncovered 
unsuspected roles for DUSP19 in mitotic exit, CDC14A in regulating microtubule 
integrity, PTPRF in mitotic retraction fiber integrity, and DUSP23 in centriole 
duplication. The functional phosphatase interactome further provides a rich 
resource for ascribing functions for this important class of enzymes.
