Extensive cross-talk between the actin and the microtubule cytoskeletons has 
been reported. Especially in mitosis, processes dependent on actin- and 
microtubule-based structures alternate and regulate each other in a complex 
cascade leading to division into two daughter cells. Here, we have studied the 
subcellular localization of the filamentous actin-capping protein CapG. 
Fluorescence microscopy of endogenous CapG and EGFP-tagged CapG revealed CapG 
localization at the mother centriole in interphase, the mitotic spindle in 
mitosis and the midbody ring in abscission. Surprisingly, nucleoporin Nup62, an 
interaction partner of CapG, also localized to the midbody ring at the end of 
abscission and colocalized with CapG. We propose a role for the actin-binding 
protein CapG as a mediator of cross-talk between the actin cytoskeleton and 
microtubule-based organelles that regulate cell division.
