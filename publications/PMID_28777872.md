The NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (NRF2)-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 
signaling pathway plays an important role in cytoprotection. In acute 
promyelocytic leukemia, fusion of the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) with 
retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) results in an oncogene, PML-RARα (PR). 
Although previous studies have shown that both RARα and PML inhibit NRF2 
activity, how PR regulates NRF2 has not been reported. Here, we discovered that 
PR-S, the short isoform of PR, potentiates NRF2 activity in a 
tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, PR-S 
colocalized with NRF2 in HeLa and HEK293T cells. The association of PR-S and 
NRF2 is mediated by the DNA-binding domains of RARα and the Neh7 domain of NRF2. 
Our results define a novel function of PR-S as a NRF2-transcriptional 
co-activator.
