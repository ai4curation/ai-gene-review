Ankyrin repeat family A protein 2 (ANKRA2) interacts with the plasma membrane 
receptor megalin and the class IIa histone deacetylases HDAC4 and HDAC5. We 
report that the ankyrin repeat domains of ANKRA2 and its close paralog 
regulatory factor X-associated ankyrin-containing protein (RFXANK) recognize a 
PxLPxI/L motif found in diverse binding proteins, including HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC9, 
megalin, and regulatory factor X, 5 (RFX5). Crystal structures of the ankyrin 
repeat domain of ANKRA2 in complex with its binding peptides revealed that each 
of the middle three ankyrin repeats of ANKRA2 recognizes a residue from the 
PxLPxI/L motif in a tumbler-lock binding mode, with ANKRA2 acting as the lock 
and the linear binding motif serving as the key. Structural analysis showed that 
three disease-causing mutations in RFXANK affect residues that are critical for 
binding to RFX5. These results suggest a fundamental principle of longitudinal 
recognition of linear sequences by a repeat-type domain. In addition, 
phosphorylation of serine 350, a residue embedded within the PxLPxI/L motif of 
HDAC4, impaired the binding of ANKRA2 but generated a high-affinity docking site 
for 14-3-3 proteins, which may help sequester this HDAC in the cytoplasm. Thus, 
the binding preference of the PxLPxI/L motif is signal-dependent. Furthermore, 
proteome-wide screening suggested that a similar phosphorylation-dependent 
switch may operate in other pathways. Together, our findings uncover a 
previously uncharacterized sequence- and signal-dependent peptide recognition 
mode for a repeat-type protein domain.
