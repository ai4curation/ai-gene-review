Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases comprise neurodegenerative disorders caused by 
expression of expanded polyQ-containing proteins. The cytotoxicity of the 
expanded polyQ-containing proteins is closely associated with aggregate 
formation. In this study, we report that a novel J-protein, DNAJ (HSP40) 
Homolog, Subfamily C, Member 8 (DNAJC8), suppresses the aggregation of 
polyQ-containing protein in a cellular model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 
(SCA3), which is also known as Machado-Joseph disease. Overexpression of DNAJC8 
in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells significantly reduced the polyQ aggregation and 
apoptosis, and DNAJC8 was co-localized with the polyQ aggregation in the cell 
nucleus. Deletion mutants of DNAJC8 revealed that the C-terminal domain of 
DNAJC8 was essential for the suppression of polyQ aggregation, whereas the 
J-domain was dispensable. Furthermore, 22-mer oligopeptide derived from 
C-termilal domain could suppress the polyQ aggregation. These results indicate 
that DNAJC8 can suppress the polyQ aggregation via a distinct mechanism 
independent of HSP70-based chaperone machinery and have a unique protective role 
against the aggregation of expanded polyQ-containing proteins such as pathogenic 
ataxin-3 proteins.
