Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) has been shown to interact 
with several cytochromes P450 (P450s) and to activate enzymatic activity of 
P450s involved in sterol biosynthesis. We analyzed the interactions of PGRMC1 
with the drug-metabolizing P450s, CYP2C2, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4, in transfected 
cells. Based on coimmunoprecipitation assays, PGRMC1 bound efficiently to all 
three P450s, and binding to the catalytic cytoplasmic domain of CYP2C2 was much 
more efficient than to a chimera containing only the N-terminal transmembrane 
domain. Down-regulation of PGRMC1 expression levels in human embryonic kidney 
293 and HepG2 cell lines stably expressing PGRMC1-specific small interfering RNA 
had no effect on the endoplasmic reticulum localization and expression levels of 
P450s, whereas enzymatic activities of CYP2C2, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 were slightly 
higher in PGRMC1-deficient cells. Cotransfection of cells with P450s and PGRMC1 
resulted in PGRMC1 concentration-dependent inhibition of the P450 activities, 
and this inhibition was partially reversed by increased expression of the P450 
reductase (CPR). In contrast, CYP51 activity was decreased by down-regulation of 
PGRMC1 and expression of PGRMC1 in the PGRMC1-deficient cells increased CYP51 
activity. In cells cotransfected with CPR and PGRMC1, strong binding of CPR to 
PGRMC1 was observed; however, in the presence of CYP2C2, interaction of PGRMC1 
with CPR was significantly reduced, suggesting that CYP2C2 competes with CPR for 
binding to PGRMC1. These data show that in contrast to sterol synthesizing P450, 
PGRMC1 is not required for the activities of several drug-metabolizing P450s, 
and its overexpression inhibits those P450 activities. Furthermore, PGRMC1 binds 
to CPR, which may influence P450 activity.

Cotransfection of cells with P450s and PGRMC1 resulted in PGRMC1 concentration-dependent inhibition of the P450 activities, and this inhibition was partially reversed by increased expression of the P450 reductase (CPR). In contrast, CYP51 activity was decreased by down-regulation of PGRMC1 and expression of PGRMC1 in the PGRMC1-deficient cells increased CYP51 activity. In cells cotransfected with CPR and PGRMC1, strong binding of CPR to PGRMC1 was observed; however, in the presence of CYP2C2, interaction of PGRMC1 with CPR was significantly reduced, suggesting that CYP2C2 competes with CPR for binding to PGRMC1. These data show that in contrast to sterol synthesizing P450, PGRMC1 is not required for the activities of several drug-metabolizing P450s, and its overexpression inhibits those P450 activities. Furthermore, PGRMC1 binds to CPR, which may influence P450 activity.

Introduction

The cytochromes P450 (P450s) constitute a superfamily of heme-containing enzymes known to metabolize physiologically important endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. Despite multiple P450s, a single electron donor, NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR), is required for their enzymatic activities. In most tissues, there is a vast excess of P450s over CPR, so that rather than forming stable complexes, P450s enter into transient interactions with CPR. A single CPR molecule may bind to oligomeric complexes of the P450s, because many P450s form either homo- or hetero-oligomeric structures ( Backes and Kelley, 2003 ). The role of a second binding partner of P450s, cytochrome b 5 , is less well understood. Cytochrome b 5 is a small heme-containing protein also localized in the membranes of the ER that differentially affects the activities of different P450s ( Schenkman and Jansson, 2003 ).

PGRMC1 has emerged as a new binding partner of several P450s which, unlike CPR or cytochrome b 5 , binds to P450 stably and stoichiometrically ( Cahill, 2007 ; Lösel et al., 2008 ; Rohe et al., 2009 ). These results have raised many exciting questions concerning the role of PGRMC1 in the regulation of P450s from different classes and the mechanism of its effect on P450 function. PGRMC1 is a small 25-kDa protein with an N-terminal membrane binding segment and a C-terminal domain with a cytochrome b 5 -like structure that binds heme. It is expressed in many tissues, including the liver, kidney, and adrenals, which have high P450 activities ( Meyer et al., 1996 ; Raza et al., 2001 ; Min et al., 2004 , 2005 ; Lösel et al., 2008 ). Expression of PGRMC1 is activated by carcinogens, and its overexpression has been detected in multiple types of cancer cells ( Selmin et al., 1996 ; Cahill, 2007 ; Craven, 2008 ; Ahmed et al., 2010 ). In most cells, PGRMC1 is localized in the membranes of the ER ( Nölte et al., 2000 ; Sakamoto et al., 2004 ), but it has also been detected in the plasma membrane, nucleus, endosomes, Golgi, and cytoplasm ( Sakamoto et al., 2004 ; Peluso et al., 2006 ; Cahill, 2007 ; Craven et al., 2007 ; Lösel et al., 2008 ). Although its role in the regulation of the P450s is a recent discovery, PGRMC1 has been shown to affect other cellular functions, including suppression of apoptosis, DNA damage repair, and cholesterol and steroid synthesis ( Rohe et al., 2009 ). An effect of PGRMC1 on P450-mediated reactions was shown in both yeast and humans ( Mallory et al., 2005 ; Craven et al., 2007 ; Hughes et al., 2007 ). The yeast homolog of PGRMC1, Dap1, increased the levels of the sterol-synthesizing CYP51 in a heme-dependent manner by stabilization of the protein ( Craven et al., 2007 ). CYP51 has been shown to bind directly to PGRMC1 in human cells and accumulation of the CYP51 substrate, lanosterol, was detected after down-regulation of PGRMC1 ( Hughes et al., 2007 ). Binding of PGRMC1 to CYP7A1 and CYP21A2, which metabolize cholesterol and progesterone, respectively, was also observed ( Hughes et al., 2007 ). These data indicate that PGRMC1 positively regulates P450s involved in sterol biosynthesis. Other classes of P450s may also be affected by PGRMC1, because strong binding of PGRMC1 to CYP3A4 was observed ( Hughes et al., 2007 ), but functional activation of the P450s may not be not universal. PGRMC1 stimulated the activity of CYP21 in transfected cells, but an inhibition was seen in a reconstituted system, and PGRMC1 had no effect on the activity of CYP17 ( Min et al., 2005 ). Although labeled as a new “helping hand” for P450s ( Debose-Boyd, 2007 ), the effect of PGRMC1 on P450s in different classes has not been studied extensively.

It has been suggested that PGRMC1 may play a role in cellular protein trafficking, because it is present in endosomes and contains several YXXΦ motifs (Φ is a large hydrophobic amino acid) that are usually involved in vesicular trafficking ( Cahill, 2007 ; Craven et al., 2007 ). PGRMC1 also forms stoichiometric complexes with sterol regulatory element binding protein cleavage activating protein and INSIG1, ER proteins involved in the regulation of ER retention and activities of cholesterol biosynthetic proteins ( Suchanek et al., 2005 ). Based on these observations, we considered the possibility that PGRMC1 has a role in the retention in the ER of microsomal P450s, in addition to effects on activity. Our results show that PGRMC1 binds to several P450s not involved in sterol synthesis, but it has no effect on their ER distribution and retention and, surprisingly, inhibits their activities. Interestingly, we have found that PGRMC1 also binds to CPR and that increased expression of CPR can partially suppress the inhibitory effect of PGRMC1 on P450 activity.

Discussion

Our studies show that PGRMC1 binds efficiently to CYP2C2, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 and surprisingly inhibits the activities of these P450s but is not essential for their localization or retention in the ER. PGRMC1 has been shown to increase the activity of two yeast P450s, CYP51A1 and CYP61A1, and two mammalian P450s, CYP51 and CYP21, involved in sterol biosynthesis ( Mallory et al., 2005 ; Min et al., 2005 ; Craven et al., 2007 ; Hughes et al., 2007 ). Down-regulation of PGRMC1 (Dap1 in yeast) expression resulted in the accumulation of CYP51 and CYP61A1 substrates in yeast and accumulation of CYP51 substrates in mammalian cells, and direct binding of Dap1 to yeast CYP51 and CYP61A was shown ( Hughes et al., 2007 ). In earlier studies, Dap1 was shown to positively regulate CYP51 by stabilizing this protein in a heme-dependent fashion, but direct binding of CYP51 to Dap1 was not detected ( Mallory et al., 2005 ; Craven et al., 2007 ). Our studies on CYP51 are consistent with these previous studies because the CYP51 substrate, lanosterol, accumulated in PGRMC1-deficient cells, and the increase was reversed by overexpression of exogenous PGRMC1. In contrast to this sterol synthesizing P450, rabbit CYP2C2 is a fatty acid hydroxylase and human CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are responsible for metabolism of the majority of drugs that are metabolized by human P450s ( Danielson, 2002 ). The inhibition of the activity of these P450s by PGRMC1 indicates that PGRMC1 may activate or inhibit specific P450s. This conclusion is consistent with the observations that PGRMC1 did not affect CYP17 activity and had condition-dependent effects on CYP21, for which activity was stimulated by PGRMC1 in cells but inhibited in reconstituted systems ( Min et al., 2005 ).

A possible concern is that PGRMC1 inhibition of exogenously expressed P450s might be an artifact of overexpression. Several considerations indicate that this is not the case. The level of P450 proteins present in the stably transfected cells was approximately 25% that of cells transiently transfected as determined by fluorescence intensity of the P450-GFP proteins (data not shown), and in both types of cells, CYP2C2 activity was decreased. Furthermore, the levels of expression of P450s in transiently transfected COS cells are reported to be 5 to 40 pmol/mg microsomal protein ( Clark and Waterman, 1991 ) and range from 10 to more than 100 pmol/mg microsomal protein in stably transfected cells ( Gonzalez and Korzekwa, 1995 ). These values are comparable with those reported for 11 different P450s in human liver, which range from 1.3 to 80.2 pmol/mg microsomal protein (64 pmol/mg for CYP3A4) ( Kawakami et al., 2010 ) so that the levels of exogenously expressed P450s are similar to the levels in hepatocytes in vivo. Finally, the levels of endogenous CYP51 are similar to the levels of the CYP2C2, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 in transiently transfected cells. These considerations indicate that the inhibition of the CYP2C2/8 and CYP3A4 by PGRMC1 is not an artifact of overexpression of these proteins.

Isozyme-specific and probably also concentration-dependent effects of PGRMC1 on different P450s activities, may be of special importance in view of the fact that PGRMC1 is induced by carcinogens and overexpressed in cancer cells ( Nie et al., 2006 ; Rohe et al., 2009 ; Ahmed et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, PGRMC1 has been shown to contribute to chemotherapy resistance, so its inhibitory effect on drug-metabolizing P450s is of particular interest. Interestingly, in lung cancer cells PGRMC1 appears to have no effect on cholesterol biosynthesis, because down-regulation of PGRMC1 did not induce accumulation of lanosterol ( Ahmed et al., 2010 ). Thus, PGRMC1 effects may be also cell-specific, which could also explain our observations of lower inhibitory effect of PGRMC1 on drug-metabolizing P450s in HepG2 than in HEK293 cells.

PGRMC1 contains a heme-binding cytochrome b 5 -like domain in its cytoplasmic domain so it is tempting to postulate that P450s may bind to the cytochrome b 5 domain of PGRMC1 because P450s interact with cytochrome b 5 . Consistent with this idea, binding of PGRMC1 to CYP2C2 is predominantly to its cytoplasmic domain, as is binding of cytochrome b 5 to P450s ( Bridges et al., 1998 ), and a mutation in the cytochrome b 5 domain of PGRMC1 eliminated binding to CYP7A1( Mansouri et al., 2008 ). In contrast to cytochrome b 5 , which can donate electrons to P450s, transfer of electrons from PGRMC1 to a P450 seems unlikely in view of the pentacoordinate binding of heme to PGRMC1, as opposed to hexacoordinate heme in P450s. However, cytochrome b 5 apo-protein, without a heme, affects the activity of some P450s ( Yamazaki et al., 1996 ), presumably allosterically, which is a possible mechanism for PGRMC1 that does not involve electron transfer. Interestingly, the effects of cytochrome b 5 , like PGRMC1, are isozyme-specific for reasons that are not entirely clear ( Schenkman and Jansson, 2003 ).

A novel observation of our studies is that PGRMC1 binds efficiently to CPR. Cytochrome b 5 can be reduced by CPR and presumably binds CPR, although this has not been shown directly ( Schenkman and Jansson, 2003 ), so that CPR may interact with the cytochrome b 5 domain of PGRMC1. Interestingly, PGRMC1-induced inhibition of P450 activity can be partially reversed by increased expression of CPR. The simplest explanation of these results would be that CPR competes for binding of PGRMC1 to the P450s, which would be consistent with binding to the cytochrome b 5 site that overlaps the CPR binding site. However, studies of the interactions of these proteins by coimmunoprecipitation are not consistent with this explanation. CPR expression had little effect on the interaction of CYP2C2 with PGRMC1. In contrast, expression of CYP2C2 dramatically reduced the interaction of CPR with PGRMC1. Alternatively, PGRMC1 might inhibit P450 activity by competing for CPR binding. Although increasing levels of PGRMC1 did not affect the binding of CYP2C2 to CPR, the binding was measured in the absence of substrate, and coimmunoprecipitation may not detect the effects on transient functional interactions between P450 and CPR. Interestingly, human CPR was reported to exist in two conformational states: a compact structure that is suitable for interflavin electron transfer, and an extended form involved in transfer of electrons to a P450 ( Ellis et al., 2009 ). PGRMC1 may interfere with the transition between the closed and open conformations. The interactions among these proteins and the ultimate effects on activity seem to be complex and are not completely explained by the present data.

Two different models to explain the PGRMC1 effect on microsomal P450s have been proposed: stabilization of P450s by PGRMC1 in a heme-dependent manner ( Mallory et al., 2005 ), or stable heme-dependent binding of PGRMC1 to P450s affecting activity by an unknown mechanism ( Hughes et al., 2007 ). Our own results, which show that PGRMC1 inhibits drug-metabolizing P450 activity, whereas it activates sterol synthesizing CYP51, are not compatible with increased P450 stability and are more consistent with the second model in which activity could be affected positively or negatively in an isozyme-specific manner. Explanations for a mechanism are largely speculative and may include allosteric effects of PGRMC1 on P450s; decreased CPR binding to P450, which cannot be detected by the coimmunoprecipitation assays in this study; induction of covalent modification, such as phosphorylation of P450 or CPR; or mediation of the effects by an unidentified binding partner of PGRMC1 that affects the activity of P450 and might also regulate PGRMC1 binding to CPR in the presence of P450. With regard to the last possibility, the presence of multiple protein motifs in PGRMC1 that are associated with signal transduction strongly suggest that PGRMC1 may be involved in the formation of multiple protein-protein interactions and signal transduction ( Cahill, 2007 ; Lösel et al., 2008 ). INSIG1, which binds to both PGRMC1 and P450, was a potential intermediary protein, but our results suggest that INSIG1 and PGRMC1 act independently on P450.

Although expression of CPR partially reversed the inhibition of P450 activity in cells, the extent of the reversal was different for the different P450s. Different P450s may interact with different residues of the CPR, which suggests formation of complexes with different stoichiometry and/or differences in the affinity of a P450 toward CPR ( Yamazaki et al., 2002 ; Miller et al., 2009 ). Two of the P450s used in our studies, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, in a reconstituted system required higher amounts of CPR than other P450s for their optimal activities, and both were additionally stimulated by cytochrome b 5 ( Yamazaki et al., 2002 ). We observed that compared with CYP2C2, these two P450s were more sensitive to both activation by exogenous CPR and inhibition by PGRMC1, and the inhibition was only weakly reversed by expression of CPR. The reversal of PGRMC1 inhibition of P450s, thus, may be influenced by the binding affinity for CPR and whether cytochrome b 5 binds and activates the P450.

Our results support previous studies showing that PGRMC1 forms stable complexes with P450s but are in contrast to the earlier studies on P450s involved in steroid biogenesis; PGRMC1 inhibits, rather than activates, P450s involved mainly in drug metabolism. PGRMC1 also binds CPR, which was not appreciated before and adds a layer of complexity in understanding how PGRMC1 affects the activity of P450s in an isozyme-specific manner.
