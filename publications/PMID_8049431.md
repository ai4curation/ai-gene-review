The cellular receptor for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPAR) is a 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein that plays a 
central role in pericellular plasminogen activation. It contains 313 amino acid 
residues, including 28 cysteine residues in a pattern of three homologous 
repeats. The cysteine residue pattern suggests that uPAR belongs to a 
superfamily of proteins including CD59, murine Ly-6, and a variety of elapid 
snake venom toxins. A novel 1.7-kb uPAR cDNA was isolated that is missing exon 5 
and that contains 380 bp not previously reported at the 5' end. This cDNA was 
used to probe a human genomic library from which three clones were isolated and 
analyzed. The uPAR gene consists of 7 exons spread over 23 kb of genomic DNA. 
Exons 2, 4, and 6 code for homologous domains within the mature protein, as do 
exons 3, 5, and 7; CD59-like homologous pairs are encoded by exons 2-3, 4-5, and 
6-7, respectively. The structure of the gene for uPAR further confirms the 
relationship of this molecule to the superfamily containing CD59, Ly-6, and the 
elapid snake venom toxins.
