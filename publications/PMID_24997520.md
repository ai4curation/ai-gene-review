Growing microtubule end regions recruit a variety of proteins collectively 
termed +TIPs, which confer local functions to the microtubule cytoskeleton. 
+TIPs form dynamic interaction networks whose behaviour depends on a number of 
potentially competitive and hierarchical interaction modes. The rules that 
determine which of the various +TIPs are recruited to the limited number of 
available binding sites at microtubule ends remain poorly understood. Here we 
examined how the human dynein complex, the main minus-end-directed motor and an 
important +TIP (refs , , ), is targeted to growing microtubule ends in the 
presence of different +TIP competitors. Using a total internal reflection 
fluorescence microscopy-based reconstitution assay, we found that a hierarchical 
recruitment mode targets the large dynactin subunit p150Glued to growing 
microtubule ends via EB1 and CLIP-170 in the presence of competing 
SxIP-motif-containing peptides. We further show that the human dynein complex is 
targeted to growing microtubule ends through an interaction of the tail domain 
of dynein with p150Glued. Our results highlight how the connectivity and 
hierarchy within dynamic +TIP networks are orchestrated.
