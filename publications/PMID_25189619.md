Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 6 protein (HPS6) has originally been identified as a 
subunit of the BLOC-2 protein complex that is involved in the biogenesis of 
lysosome-related organelles. Here, we demonstrate that HPS6 directly interacts 
with the dynactin p150(Glued) subunit of the dynein-dynactin motor complex and 
acts as cargo adaptor for the retrograde motor to mediate the transport of 
lysosomes from the cell periphery to the perinuclear region. Small interfering 
RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of HPS6 in HeLa cells not only partially blocks 
centripetal movement of lysosomes but also causes delay in lysosome-mediated 
protein degradation. Moreover, lysosomal acidification and degradative capacity, 
as well as fusion between late endosomes and/or multivesicular bodies and 
lysosomes are also impaired when HPS6 is depleted, suggesting that perinuclear 
positioning mediated by the dynein-dynactin motor complex is required for 
lysosome maturation and activity. Our results have uncovered a so-far-unknown 
specific role for HPS6 in the spatial distribution of the lysosomal compartment.
