Induction of p21 in senescent human fibroblasts plays a key role in the 
inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases and the resulting irreversible growth 
arrest in the early stages of cell senescence. We found that RNA-binding 
proteins are critical regulators of p21 during senescence. Two RNA-binding 
proteins, CUGBP1 and calreticulin (CRT), interact with the same nucleotide 
sequences within the 5' region of p21 mRNA, but have opposite effects on the 
translation of p21 mRNA. CUGBP1 increases translation of p21 mRNA, whereas CRT 
blocks translation of p21 via stabilization of a stem-loop structure within the 
5' region of the p21 mRNA. CUGBP1 and CRT compete for binding to p21 mRNA and 
thereby the regulation of p21 translation. In senescent fibroblasts, CUGBP1 
displaces CRT from the p21 mRNA and releases CRT-dependent repression of p21 
translation leading to growth arrest and development of a senescent phenotype. 
These data present evidence that competition between RNA-binding proteins for 
the regulation of p21 translation determines cell fate.

Abstract

Induction of p21 in senescent human fibroblasts plays a key role in the inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases and the resulting irreversible growth arrest in the early stages of cell senescence. We found that RNA-binding proteins are critical regulators of p21 during senescence. Two RNA-binding proteins, CUGBP1 and calreticulin (CRT), interact with the same nucleotide sequences within the 5′ region of p21 mRNA, but have opposite effects on the translation of p21 mRNA. CUGBP1 increases translation of p21 mRNA, whereas CRT blocks translation of p21 via stabilization of a stem–loop structure within the 5′ region of the p21 mRNA. CUGBP1 and CRT compete for binding to p21 mRNA and thereby the regulation of p21 translation. In senescent fibroblasts, CUGBP1 displaces CRT from the p21 mRNA and releases CRT-dependent repression of p21 translation leading to growth arrest and development of a senescent phenotype. These data present evidence that competition between RNA-binding proteins for the regulation of p21 translation determines cell fate.

Introduction

Normal human fibroblasts exhibit limited proliferative potential referred to as replicative senescence, and enter an irreversible growth arrest after undergoing a certain number of population doublings ( Campisi, 2001 ). Although telomere shortening seems to play a primary role in replicative senescence ( Chiu and Harley, 1997 ), several other aging-associated changes are required for the development of the senescent phenotype. One of the critical steps is expression of the inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases p21 and p16 ( Stein et al , 1999 ; Dulic et al , 2000 ). A detailed analysis of the contribution of each kinase has demonstrated that the induction of p21 is required for the initial irreversible growth arrest and inhibition of cdk2–cyclin E complexes, whereas p16 is involved in the maintenance of growth arrest and in further development of the senescence phenotype ( Stein et al , 1999 ). Elevation of p21 levels has also been observed in a variety of other differentiation/growth arrest systems, and the basis for this elevation has been intensively investigated. The results indicate that the molecular mechanisms of p21 regulation are complex and involve multiple levels of regulation of gene expression including transcription, stabilization of mRNA, changes in the rate of translation and stability of the protein ( Sherr and Roberts, 1999 ). The regulation of mRNA stability and mRNA translation is controlled by different RNA-binding proteins that specifically interact with corresponding mRNAs. The best characterized family of RNA-binding proteins are ELAV-like proteins, the first member of which was discovered in Drosophila as a protein that causes an embryonic lethal abnormal phenotype, elav ( Campos et al , 1985 ). Human homologs of elav, HU proteins, play a crucial role in the upregulation of mRNA encoding the cyclins ( Fan and Steitz, 1998 ).

Another family of RNA-binding proteins, the CUGBP family, has been discovered as proteins that potentially might be involved in the development of pathology in some diseases caused by expansion of RNA triplet repeats ( Timchenko et al , 1996a , 2001 ). One member of the family, CUGBP1, interacts with GC-rich sequences located within the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA and increases translation of a dominant-negative C/EBPβ isoform, LIP ( Timchenko et al , 1999 ). We have recently identified a new RNA-binding protein, calreticulin (CRT), which interacts with GC-rich sequences ( Timchenko et al , 2002 ). CRT binds to GC-rich stem–loop (SL) structures ( Singh et al , 1994 ; Pugachev and Frey, 1998 ; Timchenko et al , 2002 ) and inhibits translation of mRNA, perhaps by stabilization of the SL ( Timchenko et al , 2002 ).

We here present evidence that competition between CUGBP1 and CRT for binding to p21 mRNA controls levels of p21 expression and determines whether cells will proliferate or undergo growth arrest and senescence. We have found that CRT inhibits translation of p21 mRNA and abolishes p21-dependent growth arrest and development of a senescent-like phenotype. CUGBP1 blocks CRT-mediated inhibition of p21 translation and promotes p21-dependent growth arrest and development of a senescent-like phenotype.

Discussion

The first step in the senescence, irreversible growth arrest, requires the biological function of an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, p21 ( Stein et al , 1999 ; Dulic et al , 2000 ). Here, we present evidence that competition of two RNA-binding proteins for the regulation of p21 translation determines whether a cell will proliferate or undergo growth arrest and senescence. The analysis of protein–RNA interactions with a GC-rich sequence of the 5′ region of p21 mRNA demonstrated that binding of CUGBP1 to the p21 mRNA is dramatically induced in senescent fibroblasts. The aging-dependent activation of CUGBP1 is mediated by increased phosphorylation of CUGBP1, since treatment of CUGBP1 isolated from senescent cells with alkaline phosphatase dramatically reduces its binding to p21 mRNA. Human fibroblasts contain a kinase that is more active in senescent cells and is able to activate CUGBP1 ( Figure 1E ). A number of observations had demonstrated that the induction of p21 mRNA does not necessarily lead to the translation of p21 protein, suggesting an additional level of p21 control: inhibition of p21 mRNA translation. We found that the translation of p21 mRNA might be blocked by the RNA-binding protein, CRT, which interacts with the 5′ region of human p21 mRNA capable of forming the stable SL structure.

CRT is a multifunctional protein that is located on the endoplasmic reticulum ( Michalak et al , 1999 ). Given the observed inhibitory activity of CRT on translation of C/EBP ( Timchenko et al , 2002 ) and p21 mRNAs (this paper), we examined subcellular compartments where CRT might mediate this kind of activity. A relatively small portion of CRT (less than 2%) is associated with polysomes and this portion of CRT is able to interact with p21 mRNA. Interestingly, the PS-associated CRT represents the only portion of CRT capable of interacting with RNA. These findings suggest that the ‘active' CRT is operating on polysomes and seems to be involved in the regulation of translation of mRNAs. Although the precise mechanisms of translocation of CRT to polysomes are not known, one could suggest that the interaction of CRT with mRNAs might mediate its localization on polysomes. We have previously found that CUGBP1 is also associated with polysomes ( Timchenko et al , 1999 ). Data in this paper suggest that the competition of CRT and CUGBP1 for p21 regulation on polysomes determines whether cells proliferate (when CRT binds to p21 mRNA) or undergo growth arrest (if CUGBP1 displaces CRT from p21 mRNA), and that this competition is also involved in the regulation of senescence ( Figure 8D ).

Here, we present data showing the control of cell growth and senescence by RNA-binding proteins through competitive regulation of p21 translation. This pathway of the regulation perhaps is not limited to growth arrest/proliferation by p21 mRNA alone, but may operate in other systems via control of translation of other mRNAs. It is interesting to note that CRT and CUGBP1 also interact with the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA ( Timchenko et al , 2002 ), and potentially might compete for the regulation of C/EBPβ translation. Given a key role of p21 and C/EBPβ in a variety of biological processes ( Poli, 1998 ; Sherr and Roberts, 1999 ), one can suggest that RNA-binding proteins might be critical players of many biological systems via regulation of translation of these mRNAs and perhaps other as yet unknown mRNAs.
