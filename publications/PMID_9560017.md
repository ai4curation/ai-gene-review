Clusterin is a secreted glycoprotein that is expressed in response to tissue 
injury both in peripheral organs and in the brain. Recent studies have shown a 
substantial increase in clusterin mRNA in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus 
and the entorhinal cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with clusterin 
immunoreactivity occurring in neuropil threads, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), 
and senile plaques. To elucidate further the role of this protein in the 
degenerative process, a quantitative study of its distribution in the cerebral 
cortex of non-demented and AD patients, all older than 85 years of age, was 
performed using immunocytochemistry. Using a stereological approach, we found 
that in cortical areas affected in AD, such as the entorhinal, inferior temporal 
and superior frontal cortices, the percentage of NFT-free neurons displaying 
clusterin immunoreactivity was significantly higher than that in non-demented 
cases. No such increase in the density of clusterin-immunoreactive neurons was 
seen in cortical areas that were less affected in the disease process. 
Furthermore, clusterin immunoreactivity was rarely observed in NFT-containing 
neurons. In conjunction with previous observations in peripheral tissues, these 
data suggest that clusterin may have a neuroprotective role, and that in AD, low 
cellular expression of this protein may be associated with neuronal degeneration 
and death.
