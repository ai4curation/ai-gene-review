Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) acts as a signaling messenger by oxidatively 
modifying distinct cysteinyl thiols in distinct target proteins. However, it 
remains unclear how redox-regulated proteins, which often have low intrinsic 
reactivity towards H(2)O(2) (k(app) ∼1-10 M(-1) s(-1)), can be specifically and 
efficiently oxidized by H(2)O(2). Moreover, cellular thiol peroxidases, which 
are highly abundant and efficient H(2)O(2) scavengers, should effectively 
eliminate virtually all of the H(2)O(2) produced in the cell. Here, we show that 
the thiol peroxidase peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx2), one of the most H(2)O(2)-reactive 
proteins in the cell (k(app) ∼10(7)-10(8) M(-1) s(-1)), acts as a H(2)O(2) 
signal receptor and transmitter in transcription factor redox regulation. Prx2 
forms a redox relay with the transcription factor STAT3 in which oxidative 
equivalents flow from Prx2 to STAT3. The redox relay generates disulfide-linked 
STAT3 oligomers with attenuated transcriptional activity. Cytokine-induced STAT3 
signaling is accompanied by Prx2 and STAT3 oxidation and is modulated by Prx2 
expression levels.
