Eotaxin-3 is one of three related chemokines that specifically activate 
chemokine receptor CCR3. We report the 3D structure and backbone dynamics of 
eotaxin-3 determined by NMR spectroscopy. Eotaxin-3 is monomeric under the 
conditions in this study and consists of an unstructured N-terminus before the 
first two conserved cysteine residues, an irregularly structured N-loop 
following the second conserved cysteine, a single turn of 3(10)-helix, a 
three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, an alpha-helix, and an unstructured 
C-terminal tail. As in other chemokines, the alpha-helix packs against one face 
of the beta-sheet. The average backbone and heavy atom rmsd values of the 20 
structures (residues 9-65) are 0.44 and 1.01 A, respectively. A comparison 
between the structures of eotaxin-3 and related chemokines suggests that the 
electrostatic potential in the vicinity of a surface groove and the structure of 
the beta2-beta3 turn may be important for maintaining receptor specificity. The 
backbone dynamics of eotaxin-3 were determined from 15N NMR relaxation data 
using the extended model free dynamics formalism. Large amplitude motions on the 
picosecond to nanosecond time scale were observed in both termini and in some 
residues in the N-loop, the beta1-beta2 turn, and the beta3 strand; the location 
of these residues suggests a possible role for dynamics in receptor binding and 
activation. In contrast to eotaxin, eotaxin-3 exhibits no substantial mobility 
on the microsecond to millisecond time scale.
