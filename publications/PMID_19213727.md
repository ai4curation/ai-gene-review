Wnt11 signals through both canonical (beta-catenin) and non-canonical pathways 
and is up-regulated during osteoblast differentiation and fracture healing. In 
these studies, we evaluated the role of Wnt11 during osteoblastogenesis. Wnt11 
overexpression in MC3T3E1 pre-osteoblasts increases beta-catenin accumulation 
and promotes bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-induced expression of alkaline 
phosphatase and mineralization. Wnt11 dramatically increases expression of the 
osteoblast-associated genes Dmp1 (dentin matrix protein 1), Phex 
(phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog), and Bsp (bone sialoprotein). Wnt11 
also increases expression of Rspo2 (R-spondin 2), a secreted factor known to 
enhance Wnt signaling. Overexpression of Rspo2 is sufficient for increasing 
Dmp1, Phex, and Bsp expression and promotes bone morphogenetic protein-induced 
mineralization. Knockdown of Rspo2 abrogates Wnt11-mediated osteoblast 
maturation. Antagonism of T-cell factor (Tcf)/beta-catenin signaling with 
dominant negative Tcf blocks Wnt11-mediated expression of Dmp1, Phex, and Rspo2 
and decreases mineralization. However, dominant negative Tcf fails to block the 
osteogenic effects of Rspo2 overexpression. These studies show that Wnt11 
signals through beta-catenin, activating Rspo2 expression, which is then 
required for Wnt11-mediated osteoblast maturation.

Abstract

Wnt11 signals through both canonical (β-catenin) and non-canonical
 pathways and is up-regulated during osteoblast differentiation and fracture
 healing. In these studies, we evaluated the role of Wnt11 during
 osteoblastogenesis. Wnt11 overexpression in MC3T3E1 pre-osteoblasts increases
 β-catenin accumulation and promotes bone morphogenetic protein
 (BMP)-induced expression of alkaline phosphatase and mineralization. Wnt11
 dramatically increases expression of the osteoblast-associated genes Dmp1 (dentin matrix protein 1), Phex (phosphate-regulating
 endopeptidase homolog), and Bsp (bone sialoprotein). Wnt11 also
 increases expression of Rspo2 (R-spondin 2), a secreted factor known
 to enhance Wnt signaling. Overexpression of Rspo2 is sufficient for increasing Dmp1 , Phex , and Bsp expression and promotes bone
 morphogenetic protein-induced mineralization. Knockdown of Rspo2 abrogates
 Wnt11-mediated osteoblast maturation. Antagonism of T-cell factor
 (Tcf)/β-catenin signaling with dominant negative Tcf blocks
 Wnt11-mediated expression of Dmp1 , Phex , and Rspo2 and decreases mineralization. However, dominant negative Tcf fails to block
 the osteogenic effects of Rspo2 overexpression. These studies show that Wnt11
 signals through β-catenin, activating Rspo2 expression, which is
 then required for Wnt11-mediated osteoblast maturation.

RESULTS

Wnt11 Enhances BMP2-induced Osteoblast Maturation and
 Mineralization —Wnt11 was expressed by MC3T3 E1 pre-osteoblasts
 under basal growth conditions and was increased with BMP treatment
 (supplemental Fig. 1 A ). Overexpression of Wnt11 (Wnt11 + )
 increased levels 1000-fold. We examined alkaline phosphatase expression in
 MC3T3 E1 pre-osteoblasts overexpressing Wnt11 (Wnt11 + ) with and
 without BMP2 treatment. BMP-treated control cells cultured in ascorbate/BGP
 showed significantly increased alkaline phosphatase activity relative to
 ascorbate/BGP-treated cells and untreated controls
 ( Fig. 1 A ). BMP-treated
 Wnt11 + cells showed the greatest increase in alkaline phosphatase
 activity, ∼2-fold higher than the BMP-treated control cells
 ( Fig. 1 A ). There was
 no significant difference in Wnt11 + cell number relative to
 controls (data not shown).

To examine the effect of Wnt11 expression on osteoblast maturation, we
 performed a mineralization assay. Similar to the alkaline phosphatase results,
 Wnt11 overexpression enhanced the effects of BMP2
 ( Fig. 1 B ). At lower
 concentrations, BMP2 treatment of control cells failed to induce
 mineralization, whereas Wnt11 cells showed robust mineralization in the
 presence of BMP2.

Wnt11 Increases β -Catenin Levels in MC3T3 E1.14
 Cells —Given that canonical Wnt signaling plays a prominent role in
 osteoblast differentiation, and that Wnt11 has been shown to signal in a
 canonical manner, we evaluated the levels of cytosolic and nuclear
 β-catenin. Levels of nuclear and cytosolic β-catenin were elevated
 in Wnt11 + cells relative to controls
 ( Fig. 1 C ), indicative
 of increased canonical Wnt signaling. BMP treatment had no effect on
 β-catenin levels.

Wnt11 Regulates Osteoblast Gene Expression —To evaluate
 changes in MC3T3E1 gene expression with Wnt11, we performed a microarray
 analysis of gene expression using the mouse 430A 2.0 chip (Affymetrix). Gene
 expression in control cells treated with ascorbate and BGP, with or without 4
 n m BMP2, was compared with Wnt11 + cells under identical
 conditions, 3, 6, and 9 days after the initiation of osteoblast induction. A
 set of genes shows changes in expression in BMP2-treated control cells
 consistent with previously published studies (supplemental Table S1). Nine
 days post-treatment, there are increases in Id1, Sp7 (osterix), Bsp ( Ibsp ), osteocalcin ( Bglap1 ), and Phex , indicative of osteoblast maturation. Interestingly, expression
 of Tcf7, a Wnt-associated transcription factor, is also increased in
 BMP-treated cells.

A relatively discrete number of genes show changes with Wnt11
 overexpression (without BMP treatment). Dmp1 (dentin matrix acidic
 phosphoprotein 1) is among the extracellular matrix genes showing increased
 expression in Wnt11 cells relative to control cells (supplemental Table S2).
 Dmp1 regulates extracellular matrix mineralization, calcium-phosphate
 homeostasis, and also serves as transcriptional regulator of dentin
 sialo-phosphoprotein ( 29 , 30 ). Similarly,
 otoraplin/cartilage-derived retinoic acid-sensitive protein
 ( Otor/CD-RAP ), a proteoglycan involved in chondrogenesis
 ( 31 ), is increased by Wnt11
 cells at all time points examined. Interestingly, in control cells, BMP
 treatment results in repression of Otor expression (supplemental
 Table S1). Expression of Phex , a gene mutated in hypophosphatemic
 rickets ( 32 ), is also
 increased in Wnt11 + cells relative to controls, independent of BMP
 treatment (supplemental Table S2). Rspo2 expression is increased in
 Wnt11 cells relative to controls (supplemental Table S2). Genes that show
 further enhancement with Wnt11 overexpression in the presence of BMP treatment
 are shown in supplemental Table S3. Dmp1 and Phex are both
 increased, suggesting either an additive or synergistic effect of BMP and
 Wnt11.

Increased expression of some of these genes was validated using qPCR
 ( Fig. 2 for Rspo2, Phex,
 Dmp , and Bsp ; others not shown). BMP and Wnt11 synergistically
 increase expression of Phex, Bsp , and Dmp1 , a result that is
 consistent with the microarray data. By contrast, Rspo2 expression is
 greatest in Wnt11-overexpressing cells that are not treated with BMP, whereas
 BMP appears to decrease Rspo2 expression
 ( Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig.
 1 B ).

β -Catenin Signaling Is Required for Wnt11-mediated Osteoblast
 Maturation and Mineralization —To determine whether β-catenin
 signaling was required for the pro-osteoblastic effects of Wnt11, we
 introduced a dominant negative form of Tcf (dnTcf) and examined osteoblast
 differentiation and gene expression. Overexpression of dnTcf
 (dnTcf + cells) has no statistically significant effect on gene
 expression in either non-BMP or BMP-treated control cells
 ( Fig. 2 ). However, BMP treated
 Wnt11 + /dnTcf + cells show significantly lower levels of Rspo2, Bsp, Dmp1 , and Phex ( Fig. 2 ) relative to
 BMP-treated Wnt11 + cells. Furthermore,
 dnTcf + /Wnt11 + cells showed reduced mineralization
 ( Fig. 2, E and F ). Thus, β-catenin/Tcf signaling mediates at least
 some of the pro-osteoblast effects of Wnt11.

Rspo2 Enhances Osteoblast Maturation and Mineralization and
 Stabilizes β -Catenin —Because R-spondin expression is
 both induced by Wnt signaling
 ( 33 ) and an activator of
 β-catenin ( 17 , 33 ), we examined if some of
 the osteogenic effects of Wnt11 were mediated by Rspo2. We cloned the cDNA
 encoding murine Rspo2 and retrovirally overexpressed it in MC3T3 E1.14 cells
 (Rspo2 + cells). Overexpression increased Rspo2 levels 50-fold over
 control conditions, which was increased ∼5-fold over Rspo2 expression in
 Wnt11 + cells (supplemental Fig. 1 B ). Osteoblast maturation
 and mineralization were subsequently evaluated in Wnt11 + ,
 Rspo2 + , and control cells. BMP-treated Rspo2- and
 Wnt11-overexpressing cells show statistically significant increased levels of
 alkaline phosphatase activity relative to control cells. However, neither
 Wnt11 nor Rspo2 overexpression is sufficient for induction of alkaline
 phosphatase ( Fig. 3 A ).
 Rspo2 overexpression potently enhances mineralization at all concentrations of
 BMP ( Fig. 3 B ).
 Furthermore, Rspo2 is sufficient for β-catenin activation with consequent
 nuclear accumulation ( Fig.
 3 C ).

Rspo2 Enhances Osteoblast Gene Expression in a Partially
 Tcf-independent Manner —To determine how Rspo2 enhanced osteoblast
 maturation and mineralization, we examined osteoblast-associated gene
 expression in Rspo2 + cells ( Fig.
 4 ). BMP-treated Rspo2 + cells show significantly higher
 levels of osteoblast-associated genes Bsp, Dmp1 , and Phex expression relative to BMP2-treated control cells. Phex expression is
 partially decreased in Rspo2 + /dnTcf4 + cells relative to
 Rspo2 + cells but remains much higher than BMP-treated control
 cells. Interestingly, expression levels of Dmp1 and Bsp are
 unchanged in BMP treated Rspo2 + /dnTcf4 + cells relative
 to Rspo2 + cells. Importantly, dnTcf4 does not block Rspo2-mediated
 mineralization ( Fig.
 2 F ).

Rspo2 Expression Is Required for Osteoblast Maturation and
 Mineralization —To determine whether Rspo2 expression was
 required for Wnt11-enhanced osteoblast maturation and mineralization, we used
 retrovirus-based microRNAi to knock down expression of Rspo2. Two
 retrovirus-based miRNAi vectors directed against mRspo2 were designed and
 tested (Rspo2 959 and Rspo2 1390). Both viruses specifically knocked down
 expression of Rspo2 and not that of other Rspo family members (data
 not shown). Our initial experiments indicated that Rspo2 959 was more
 effective (data not shown) at knocking down expression of Rspo2 . All
 subsequent experiments were therefore performed with Rspo2 959 (Rspo2
 miR + ).

Control cells were infected with a LacZ miRNAi retrovirus (miRNAi control,
 LacZmiR + ), whereas Wnt11 cells were infected with either a LacZ
 control miRNAi retrovirus or the Rspo2 miRNAi retrovirus. Alkaline phosphatase
 induction and mineralization were evaluated as markers of osteoblast
 maturation and function. Knockdown of Rspo2 expression in Wnt11 cells
 decreases Wnt11-enhanced alkaline phosphatase induction to near control levels
 ( Fig. 5 A ).
 Importantly, knockdown of Rspo2 expression resulted in a nearly
 complete blockade of mineralization; levels of mineralization in
 Wnt11 + /Rspo2miR + cells were lower than both
 control/LacZmiR + and Wnt11 + /LacZmiR + cells
 ( Fig. 5 B ).

We also evaluated levels of osteoblast-associated gene expression in
 Wnt11 + /Rspo2 miR + cells. By quantitative PCR, Rspo2
 expression in knockdown cells was reduced by 99% relative to the
 Wnt11 + /LacZmiR + control cells
 ( Fig. 5 C ). BMP-treated
 Wnt11 + /Rspo2miR + cells demonstrate significantly reduced
 expression of BSP and Phex ( Fig. 5, D and E ). However, Dmp1 levels were unaffected by
 Rspo2 knockdown ( Fig.
 5 F ).

DISCUSSION

We have determined that Wnt11 enhances BMP-induced osteoblast maturation
 and mineralization in a Tcf/β-catenin-dependent manner and that this
 osteogenic effect is mediated, in part, through increased expression of Rspo2 . Wnt11 increases Rspo2 expression, and Rspo2
 overexpression potently enhanced osteoblast mineralization and maturation.

dnTcf blocks Rspo2 expression by Wnt11 suggesting that the
 increase in Rspo2 by Wnt11 requires Tcf/β-catenin signaling. In silico promoter analysis (supplemental Fig. S2) provides evidence
 to support this conclusion, as three Tcf consensus sites are located within a
 1.5-kb region upstream of the start codon in the Rspo2 gene.
 Decreased expression of Rspo2 as a result of Tcf antagonism in
 Wnt11 + is a likely explanation for decreased levels of osteoblast
 differentiation in the Wnt11 + /dnTcf + cells.

A requirement for Rspo2 in Wnt11-mediated osteoblast maturation and
 mineralization is supported by Rspo2 knockdown data. BMP-treated
 Wnt11 + /Rspo2miR + cells demonstrate a near complete
 absence of mineral in response to BMP induction. These cells also show
 decreased alkaline phosphatase activity, as well as decreased expression of Bsp and Phex , genes associated with osteoblast maturation
 and mineralization. These studies clearly identify Rspo2 as a novel and potent
 osteogenic factor.

Similarly, a recent study has shown that Rspo1 potentiates osteoblast
 differentiation secondary to Wnt3a
 ( 21 ). However, our study
 suggests that the effects of Rspo2 are Tcf-independent. Although dnTcf blocks
 both Rspo2 expression and mineralization in Wnt11 + cells,
 it has no effect on enhanced mineralization by Rspo2. Furthermore, in
 Rspo2 + /dnTcf + cells, Bsp and Phex remain elevated but are decreased in the Wnt11 + /dnTcf + cells.

These data have allowed us to construct a model for the relationship
 between Wnt11, Rspo2, and BMP signaling during osteoblast maturation and
 mineralization (supplemental Fig. S3). Whereas β-catenin signaling is
 required for inducing Rspo2 expression, Rspo2 has effects independent
 of β-catenin-Tcf.

It is interesting to note that BMP treatment down-regulates expression of Rspo2 in MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts and also down-regulates expression of Rspo2 in Wnt11 + cells (although levels of expression
 remain elevated relative to BMP-treated controls). Given the potent effects of
 Rspo2 on osteoblast maturation, down-regulation of Rspo2 expression
 by BMPs may be a mechanism to limit the extent of mineralization by fully
 differentiated osteoblasts. Similarly, BMP has been shown to induce expression
 of BMP pathway inhibitors, including the soluble antagonists Noggin and
 Chordin, as well as inhibitory Smad. Thus, BMP may reduce Rspo2 as part of a
 negative feedback loop to “fine-tune” the extent of
 mineralization.

We postulate that decreases in Bsp and Phex expression
 may be responsible for decreased mineral observed with
 Wnt11 + /Rspo2mir + cells and
 Wnt11 + /dnTcf + cells. Bsp has a high affinity for
 hydroxyapatite and is involved in biomineralization
 ( 34 ). Conditional Phex deletion in osteoblasts results in severe osteomalacia,
 indicating an important role for Phex in bone mineralization and
 calcium-phosphate homeostasis
 ( 35 ). Antagonism of Phex and Bsp expression therefore may disrupt the process of
 biomineralization.

Wnt11 and Rspo2, acting downstream of Wnt11, modulate the expression of
 additional extracellular matrix proteins, particularly the
 bone/dentin-associated extracellular matrix protein Dmp1 . Dmp1 is
 known to regulate osteoblast gene expression and may also influence
 hydroxyapatite crystal nucleation
 ( 29 , 36 ). β-Catenin and Smad
 family members, along with AP1 family members, form a transcriptional complex
 that cooperatively regulates Dmp1 expression. Such complexes have
 been previously shown to regulate expression of target genes
 ( 37 ). Although dnTcf decreased
 Wnt11-mediated Dmp1 expression, it had no effect on Rspo2-induced Dmp1 expression. Furthermore, Rspo2 knockdown had no effect on
 Wnt11-mediated Dmp1 expression. This result suggests that Dmp1 expression by Wnt11 is regulated through β-catenin but is
 independent of Rspo2 (supplemental Fig. S3). Although Dmp1 remains
 elevated in Wnt11 + /Rspo2miR + cells, it is not sufficient
 for the pro-osteogenic effects of Wnt11.

Our results in MC3T3 E1 cells, a committed pre-osteoblast line, show that
 BMP stimulation is required for the pro-osteogenic effects of Wnt11 and Rspo2.
 This suggests that Wnt11 and Rspo2 do not have a direct effect on osteoblast
 differentiation, but act to modulate osteoblast maturation and function
 downstream from BMP signaling. It is possible that the Wnt11 and Rspo2 may
 have a different function in uncommitted osteoprogenitors, relative to more
 committed cells, such as the MC3T3 cells. Two lines of evidence support this
 hypothesis. First, during development, Wnt11 and Rspo2 are expressed in the
 apical ectodermal ridge, a zone of highly proliferative progenitor cells in
 the developing limbs. Second, during fracture healing, Wnt signaling promotes
 osteoprogenitor proliferation and inhibits differentiation
 ( 38 ). Studies examining the
 function of Wnt11 and Rspo2 in mesenchymal stem cells will allow a better
 understanding of these factors in regulating proliferation and differentiation
 of uncommitted osteoprogenitors, as opposed to regulating osteoblast
 maturation in terminally differentiated cells.

These studies identify Wnt11 and Rspo2 as novel osteogenic factors.
 Furthermore, Rspo2 is expressed downstream of Wnt11 and is both
 necessary and sufficient to mediate the osteogenic effects of Wnt11. Although
 the viral expression approach used in this study allows for sustained
 expression and release of Wnt11 and Rspo2, it does not allow for fine control
 of growth factor kinetics and timing of release. Future studies utilizing
 purified Wnt11 and Rspo2 will allow for better determinations of how growth
 factor kinetics and timing influence osteoprogenitor proliferation and
 differentiation and osteoblast maturation. If the downstream mediators of
 Rspo2 signaling are identified, this may serve as another pathway to target
 for development of bone anabolic agents.
