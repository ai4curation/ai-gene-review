p38, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily, is 
activated in response to a variety of cellular stresses and ligands. Since the 
genome of the nematode C. elegans has been sequenced, we sought to identify and 
characterize the nematode homolog of mammalian p38. By sequence analysis and 
RT-PCR, we isolated cDNAs encoding three kinases, PMK-1, PMK-2, and PMK-3, which 
we call p38 map kinases due to their high sequence identity with p38. The three 
genes are contiguous on chromosome IV and comprise an operon. By use of a GFP 
reporter, we found that the promoter of the pmks is active throughout the 
intestine. An active form of MAPK/ERK kinase 6 (MEK6) phosphorylated and 
activated recombinant PMK-1 and PMK-2 in vitro. PMK-1 and PMK-2 phosphorylated 
activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), indicating an activity similar to 
mammalian p38. When transfected into mammalian cells, these kinases, like p38, 
are stimulated by osmotic stresses.
