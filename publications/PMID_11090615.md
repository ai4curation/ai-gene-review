BRCA1 has been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of DNA 
damage-inducible genes that function in cell cycle arrest. To explore the 
mechanistic basis for this regulation, a novel human gene, ZBRK1, which encodes 
a 60 kDa protein with an N-terminal KRAB domain and eight central zinc fingers, 
was identified by virtue of its interaction with BRCA1 in vitro and in vivo. 
ZBRK1 binds to a specific sequence, GGGxxx CAGxxxTTT, within GADD45 intron 3 
that supports the assembly of a nuclear complex minimally containing both ZBRK1 
and BRCA1. ZBRK1 represses transcription through this recognition sequence in a 
BRCA1-dependent manner. These results thus reveal a novel corepressor function 
for BRCA1 and provide a mechanistic basis for the biological activity of BRCA1 
through sequence-specific transcriptional regulation.

PurposeBRCA1-interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 (BRIP1) and zinc finger protein 350 (ZNF350) work with BRCA1 in tumor suppression procedures. Low penetrance variants of these three genes may jointly affect individuals’ breast cancer susceptibility in general population.

BRCA1-interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 (BRIP1) and zinc finger protein 350 (ZNF350) work with BRCA1 in tumor suppression procedures. Low penetrance variants of these three genes may jointly affect individuals’ breast cancer susceptibility in general population.

MethodsWe focused on potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding regions of BRIP1, ZNF350 and BRCA1 and pairwise-tagging approach was used to minimize the number of SNPs. Five SNPs were selected and genotyped by PCR-restriction fraction length polymorphism or PCR-primer introduced restriction analysis assays in a case–control study with 568 breast cancer cases and 624 controls in a Chinese population.

Five SNPs were selected and genotyped by PCR-restriction fraction length polymorphism or PCR-primer introduced restriction analysis assays in a case–control study with 568 breast cancer cases and 624 controls in a Chinese population.

ResultsAll of the five SNPs except rs2278415 of ZNF350 conferred a modestly increased risk, although, with no statistical significance. Joint effect analyses indicated that all the variant genotypes of ZNF350 polymorphisms accounted for increased breast cancer risk among subjects carrying variant homozygote of BRCA1 rs799917, particularly for ZNF350 rs4986773 (OR = 2.03, 95%CI = 1.02–4.05, the test for gene–gene interaction P
int = 0.059).

Conclusion
BRCA1 and ZNF350 may jointly contribute to individuals’ susceptibility of breast cancer in Chinese women. Further functional studies are warranted to validate our findings.
