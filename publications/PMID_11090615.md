BRCA1 has been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of DNA 
damage-inducible genes that function in cell cycle arrest. To explore the 
mechanistic basis for this regulation, a novel human gene, ZBRK1, which encodes 
a 60 kDa protein with an N-terminal KRAB domain and eight central zinc fingers, 
was identified by virtue of its interaction with BRCA1 in vitro and in vivo. 
ZBRK1 binds to a specific sequence, GGGxxx CAGxxxTTT, within GADD45 intron 3 
that supports the assembly of a nuclear complex minimally containing both ZBRK1 
and BRCA1. ZBRK1 represses transcription through this recognition sequence in a 
BRCA1-dependent manner. These results thus reveal a novel corepressor function 
for BRCA1 and provide a mechanistic basis for the biological activity of BRCA1 
through sequence-specific transcriptional regulation.
