BRCA1 has been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of DNA 
damage-inducible genes that function in cell cycle arrest. To explore the 
mechanistic basis for this regulation, a novel human gene, ZBRK1, which encodes 
a 60 kDa protein with an N-terminal KRAB domain and eight central zinc fingers, 
was identified by virtue of its interaction with BRCA1 in vitro and in vivo. 
ZBRK1 binds to a specific sequence, GGGxxx CAGxxxTTT, within GADD45 intron 3 
that supports the assembly of a nuclear complex minimally containing both ZBRK1 
and BRCA1. ZBRK1 represses transcription through this recognition sequence in a 
BRCA1-dependent manner. These results thus reveal a novel corepressor function 
for BRCA1 and provide a mechanistic basis for the biological activity of BRCA1 
through sequence-specific transcriptional regulation.

Methods

We focused on potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding regions of BRIP1 , ZNF350 and BRCA1 and pairwise-tagging approach was used to minimize the number of SNPs. Five SNPs were selected and genotyped by PCR-restriction fraction length polymorphism or PCR-primer introduced restriction analysis assays in a case–control study with 568 breast cancer cases and 624 controls in a Chinese population.

Results

All of the five SNPs except rs2278415 of ZNF350 conferred a modestly increased risk, although, with no statistical significance. Joint effect analyses indicated that all the variant genotypes of ZNF350 polymorphisms accounted for increased breast cancer risk among subjects carrying variant homozygote of BRCA1 rs799917, particularly for ZNF350 rs4986773 (OR = 2.03, 95%CI = 1.02–4.05, the test for gene–gene interaction P int = 0.059).

Conclusion

BRCA1 and ZNF350 may jointly contribute to individuals’ susceptibility of breast cancer in Chinese women. Further functional studies are warranted to validate our findings.

Introduction

Breast cancer is by far the most frequent cancer of women worldwide, and its familial aggregation suggests a crucial role of genetic components in breast carcinogenesis (Parkin et al. 2005 ; Struewing et al. 1997 ). Among the known genetic alterations, BRCA1 is the first identified high penetrance but low frequent breast cancer susceptibility gene, whose mutations accounts for less than 10% of all breast cancer cases (Sauer 2002 ; Ford et al. 1995 ). Studies have shown that BRCA1 serves as a cancer suppressor by diverse mechanisms, including DNA damage repair, cell cycle checkpoint and transcription repression (Deng 2006 ). In these pathways, many partners (BRCA1-interacting proteins) were found to work with BRCA1 in tumor suppression procedures (Deng 2006 ).

BRCA1-interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 (BRIP1) interacts with the BRCT repeats of BRCA1, and the complex is important for normal double-strand break repair of BRCA1 (Cantor et al. 2001 ). Germline mutations of BRIP1 , which affects the helicase domain, were detected in two early-onset breast cancer patients but not in 200 controls (Cantor et al. 2001 ). Elevated expression levels of BRIP1 were detected in primary invasive breast carcinomas (Eelen et al. 2008 ). Zinc finger protein 350 (ZNF350) is a sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor, which physically interact and functionally synergize with BRCA1 in transcription repression (Zheng et al. 2000 ). Potential ZNF350 binding site, a 15-bp sequence GGGxxxCAGxxxTTT (x represents any base), has been identified in several DNA damage response genes that are regulated by BRCA1 , such as, GADD45a , p21 , Bax and GADD153 (Zheng et al. 2000 ). Familial breast cancer-derived mutants of BRCA1 that disrupt its interaction with ZBRK1 (ZNF350) abrogated the co-repressor activity, suggesting that the interaction was important for the tumor suppressor properties of BRCA1 (Zheng et al. 2000 ; Yun and Lee 2003 ). Furthermore, altered expression of the ZNF350 gene was observed in human breast carcinomas and the removal of BRCA1/ZBRK1 repressor complex could lead to an accelerated mammary tumor growth (Garcia et al. 2004 ; Furuta et al. 2006 ).

Several studies analyzed common genetic variants in BRCA1 and its interacting genes ( BRIP1 and ZNF350 ) and breast cancer risk (Soucek et al. 2007 ; Dunning et al. 1997 ; Freedman et al. 2005 ; Vahteristo et al. 2006 ; García-Closas et al. 2006 ; Song et al. 2007 ). Most of the association studies reported to date achieved non-significant main effects. However, no studies were conducted in Chinese population and no studies investigated the joint-effect or interaction between these genes. It is believed that interactions between low penetrance variants/loci may play important roles in cancer susceptibility in general populations. Therefore, we genotyped five potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BRIP1 , ZNF350 and BRCA1 in a case–control study of 568 cases and 624 controls to test the hypothesis that common sequence variants in these three genes, especially those located in the binding/interacting domains, may jointly influence individuals’ risk of breast cancer.

The selected characteristics of the 568 breast cancer cases and 624 cancer-free controls were partly described previously (Huo et al. 2007 ). No significant difference in age ( P = 0.767) between cases and controls was found owing to our matching design. There were significant differences between the cases and controls in age at menarche ( P < 0.0001), age at menopausal ( P = 0.018) and age at having first live birth ( P < 0.0001). The cases had a significantly younger age at both menarche and menopausal and an older age at having first live birth, indicating that these characteristics might be risk factors for breast cancer. Of all subjects, 151 (26.58%) cases and 131 (20.99%) controls reported a family history of cancer in first-degree relatives, which accounted for a 35% increased breast cancer risk (OR = 1.35, 95%CI = 1.04–1.77) (Table 2 ).

The genotype distributions of the three genes in the cases and the controls were shown in Table 3 . The observed genotype frequencies for these five polymorphisms were all in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the controls ( P = 0.757, 0.359, 0.840, 0.648 and 0.407 for BRCA1 rs799917, BRIP1 rs4986764, ZNF350 rs2278420, rs2278415 and rs4986773, respectively). In the single locus analysis, none of the genotype distributions of these five SNPs was significantly different between the cases and the controls ( P = 0.357, 0.373, 0.203, 0.668 and 0.555, respectively). Similarly, logistic regression analysis did not show any significant associations of these five polymorphisms with breast cancer susceptibility under different genetic models. However, all of the five SNPs except rs2278415 of ZNF350 accounted for a modestly increased risk in dominant genetic models. In subgroup analysis stratified by age, age at menarche, menopausal and first live birth, no significant associations were found in these subgroups (data not shown).

We then inferred the joint effects between BRCA1, BRIP1 and ZNF350 genes on breast cancer risk (Table 4 ). We found that all the variant homozygotes of ZNF350 polymorphisms accounted for increased breast cancer risk among subjects carrying variant homozygote of BRCA1 rs799917, particularly for ZNF350 rs4986773 (OR = 2.03, 95%CI = 1.02–4.05) and the test for gene–gene interaction was approaching to significant ( P int = 0.059). However, no interaction of BRIP1 and BRCA1 was observed. We also analyzed the potential interactions between genetic polymorphisms and demographic characteristics, such as age, BMI, age at menarche and menopause status; however, no significant interactions were found (data not shown).

To validate the marginal gene–gene interaction of ZNF350 rs4986773 and BRCA1 rs799917, and further discuss the gene–gene and gene–environment interaction, MDR method was introduced to detect and characterize the non-linear interactions. We found that, the best models of one, two, three and four attributes were MENARCHE , Family History of Cancer and MENARCHE , AGE and Family History of Cancer and MENARCHE and AGE and MENARCHE and ZNF350-rs4986773 and BRCA1-rs799917 , respectively (Table 5 ). However, only single-factor model ( MENARCHE) and four-factors model ( AGE and MENARCHE and ZNF350-rs4986773 and BRCA1-rs799917) presented 100% cross-validation consistency with significance test ( P ) of 0.0010, indicating that, when considering four-factors, the interaction between age, menarche, ZNF350- rs4986773 and BRCA1 -rs799917 was the best model to predict individuals’ breast cancer risk. Nevertheless, compared with the single-factor model MENARCHE, the four-factor model ( AGE and MENARCHE and ZNF350-rs4986773 and BRCA1-rs799917) did not show an increased accuracy (0.6085 vs 0.6477). Thus, the effect of the interaction between age, menarche, ZNF350- rs4986773 and BRCA1 -rs799917 may be weak in the susceptibility of breast cancer.

Discussion

In this case–control study, we investigated the associations of five potentially functional SNPs of BRCA1, BRCA1 -interacting genes ( BRIP1 and ZNF350 ) and risk of sporadic breast cancer in Chinese women. We found, for the first time, that the variant genotypes of BRCA1 and ZNF350 may jointly contribute to the risk of breast cancer.

ZNF350 physically interacts and functionally synergize with BRCA1 in transcription repression, playing an important role in the tumor suppressor properties of BRCA1 (Zheng et al. 2000 ). Amino acids substitution and/or space conformation alteration of these two proteins were likely to discharge their interaction (Bhatti et al. 2006 ). In our study, we found that, when rs799917 of BRCA1 and rs4986773 of ZNF350 changed simultaneously, individuals’ breast cancer susceptibility may increase. However, it is largely unknown why these two SNPs can have a joint effect on breast cancer risk. The possible explanations were that the two variants themselves could be causal loci and both synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs have important implications in cancer biology. Non-synonymous SNPs, such as rs799917 of BRCA1 , can change amino acid sequence and possible changes of protein structure. Synonymous SNPs, such as rs4986773 of ZNF350 , often disregarded based on the assumption that they do not change protein sequence and possible expression. However, recent reports indicated that there were several mechanisms by which synonymous mutations could result in functional changes, through affecting mRNA structure and stability, kinetics of translation and/or alternate splicing (Sauna et al. 2007 ). The another explanation is that other functional coding variants tagged by these two SNPs could be causal loci. Additional functional studies on the two SNPs and their tagged coding variants were warranted.

Polygenic models suggest that multiple commonly occurring low to modestly penetrant SNPs of cancer related genes might have a greater effect on cancer susceptibility when considered in combination (Onay et al. 2006 ). Most of the association studies with relative large sample size reported to date in relation to BRCA1 and BRCA1 -interacting genes ( BRIP1 and ZNF350 ) and breast cancer risk achieved non-significant main effects (Soucek et al. 2007 ; Dunning et al. 1997 ; Freedman et al. 2005 ; Vahteristo et al. 2006 ; García-Closas et al. 2006 ; Song et al. 2007 ). For instance, Freedman et al. ( 2005 ) genotyped 28 SNPs (including rs799917) spanning the BRCA1 gene to define common haplotype patterns, and found no evidence for significant associations between common variations in BRCA1 and risk of breast cancer in a nested case–control study from the Multiethnic Cohort Study (1,715 cases and 2,502 controls). Song et al. ( 2007 ) used a SNP tagging approach to evaluate the association between common variants (minor allele frequency ≥ 0.05) in BRIP1 and the risk of breast cancer and found none of the 12 tagging SNPs (tSNPs) was associated with breast cancer. García-Closas et al. ( 2006 ) evaluated the association between rs4986773 and rs2278420 of ZNF350 and breast cancer risk in two population-based studies in USA and Poland and found no significant effect of rs2278420 in both USA and Poland populations but a modestly significant increased risk (1.12-fold) of rs4986773 within USA population. Two reasons might result in the discrepancy of the association of rs4986773 with breast cancer risk between our study and García-Closas et al. ( 2006 ). For one, the frequency of minor allele (C) in our study population (0.284) was lower than that in the Caucasians (0.417 in the HapMap database), suggesting the potential difference of genetic basis among ethnics. For another, our moderate sample size may be not large enough to detect such a modest effect (OR < 1.20). Under the current sample size (568 cases and 624 controls) in our study, the statistic power was 91.6% assuming the OR of 1.5 and the risk factor frequency of 0.6, whereas the power reduced to 33.2% assuming the OR of 1.2. However, few studies focused on the joint effect or interactions between these genes and breast cancer risk.

Sigurdson et al. ( 2004 ) found that BRIP1 P919S substitution showed a strong association with 4.5-fold and 6.9-fold (for PS vs SS and PP vs SS, respectively) increased risks of breast cancer up to age 50 by using the kin-cohort analytic method. However, the association was markedly attenuated when observation was extended to age 70. In the present case–control study, we did not observe the significant association between BRIP1 P919S and sporadic breast cancer risk in Chinese. The different design and ethnic background might account for this discrepancy. Interestingly, all the variant homozygotes of ZNF350 polymorphisms accounted for increased breast cancer risk among subjects carrying variant homozygote of BRCA1 rs799917, with a potential gene–gene interaction for rs4986773 in both logistic regression analysis and MDR model. Because this study only had the moderate sample size and limited statistical power, larger studies with functional evaluations are warranted to confirm our findings.
