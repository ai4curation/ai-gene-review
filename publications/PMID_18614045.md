The histone H2A variant H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated in response to DNA 
double-stranded breaks to produce gamma-H2AX. gamma-H2AX stabilizes cell-cycle 
checkpoint proteins and DNA repair factors at the break site. We previously 
found that the protein phosphatase PP2A is required to resolve gamma-H2AX foci 
and complete DNA repair after exogenous DNA damage. Here we describe a 
three-protein PP4 phosphatase complex in mammalian cells, containing PP4C, 
PP4R2, and PP4R3beta, that specifically dephosphorylates ATR-mediated gamma-H2AX 
generated during DNA replication. PP4 efficiently dephosphorylates gamma-H2AX 
within mononucleosomes in vitro and does not directly alter ATR or checkpoint 
kinase activity, suggesting that PP4 acts directly on gamma-H2AX in cells. When 
the PP4 complex is silenced, repair of DNA replication-mediated breaks is 
inefficient, and cells are hypersensitive to DNA replication inhibitors, but not 
radiomimetic drugs. Therefore, gamma-H2AX elimination at DNA damage foci is 
required for DNA damage repair, but accomplishing this task involves distinct 
phosphatases with potentially overlapping roles.
