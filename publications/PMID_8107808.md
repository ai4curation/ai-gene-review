Calreticulin is a multifunctional protein that acts as a major Ca(2+)-binding 
(storage) protein in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. It is also found in 
the nucleus, suggesting that it may have a role in transcription regulation. 
Calreticulin has been reported to bind to the synthetic peptide KLGFFKR, which 
is almost identical to an amino-acid sequence in the DNA-binding domain of the 
superfamily of nuclear receptors. Could calreticulin interact with the 
DNA-binding domain of these receptors and affect their function? Here we report 
that the amino terminus of calreticulin interacts with the DNA-binding domain of 
the glucocorticoid receptor and prevents the receptor from binding to its 
specific glucocorticoid response element. Overexpression of calreticulin in 
mouse L fibroblasts inhibits glucocorticoid-response-mediated transcriptional 
activation of a glucocorticoid-sensitive reporter gene and of the endogenous, 
glucocorticoid-sensitive gene encoding cytochrome P450. Together these results 
indicate that calreticulin may be important in gene transcription, regulating 
the glucocorticoid receptor and perhaps other members of the super-family of 
nuclear receptors.
