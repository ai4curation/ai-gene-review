Agrin triggers signaling mechanisms of high temporal and spatial specificity to 
achieve phosphorylation, clustering, and stabilization of postsynaptic 
acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Agrin transiently activates the kinase MuSK; 
MuSK activation has largely vanished when AChR clusters appear. Thus, a tyrosine 
kinase cascade acts downstream from MuSK, as illustrated by the agrin-evoked 
long-lasting activation of Src family kinases (SFKs) and their requirement for 
AChR cluster stabilization. We have investigated this cascade and report that 
pharmacological inhibition of SFKs reduces early but not later agrin-induced 
phosphorylation of MuSK and AChRs, while inhibition of Abl kinases reduces late 
phosphorylation. Interestingly, SFK inhibition applied selectively during 
agrin-induced AChR cluster formation caused rapid cluster dispersal later upon 
agrin withdrawal. We also report that a single 5-min agrin pulse, followed by 
extensive washing, triggered long-lasting MuSK and AChR phosphorylation and 
efficient AChR clustering. Following the pulse, MuSK phosphorylation increased 
and, beyond a certain level, caused maximal clustering. These data reveal novel 
temporal aspects of tyrosine kinase action in agrin signaling. First, during 
AChR cluster formation, SFKs initiate early phosphorylation and an AChR 
stabilization program that acts much later. Second, a kinase mechanism rapidly 
activated by agrin acts thereafter autonomously in agrin's absence to further 
increase MuSK phosphorylation and cluster AChRs.

Abstract

Agrin triggers signaling mechanisms of high temporal and spatial specificity to achieve phosphorylation, clustering, and stabilization of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Agrin transiently activates the kinase MuSK; MuSK activation has largely vanished when AChR clusters appear. Thus, a tyrosine kinase cascade acts downstream from MuSK, as illustrated by the agrin-evoked long-lasting activation of Src family kinases (SFKs) and their requirement for AChR cluster stabilization. We have investigated this cascade and report that pharmacological inhibition of SFKs reduces early but not later agrin-induced phosphorylation of MuSK and AChRs, while inhibition of Abl kinases reduces late phosphorylation. Interestingly, SFK inhibition applied selectively during agrin-induced AChR cluster formation caused rapid cluster dispersal later upon agrin withdrawal. We also report that a single 5-min agrin pulse, followed by extensive washing, triggered long-lasting MuSK and AChR phosphorylation and efficient AChR clustering. Following the pulse, MuSK phosphorylation increased and, beyond a certain level, caused maximal clustering. These data reveal novel temporal aspects of tyrosine kinase action in agrin signaling. First, during AChR cluster formation, SFKs initiate early phosphorylation and an AChR stabilization program that acts much later. Second, a kinase mechanism rapidly activated by agrin acts thereafter autonomously in agrin's absence to further increase MuSK phosphorylation and cluster AChRs.

DISCUSSION

Here we reveal novel temporal patterns of tyrosine kinase action in the agrin signaling pathway. First, we showed that SFKs are required for phosphorylation of MuSK and AChRs early (5 min) but not later (40 min) after agrin stimulation, whereas Abl kinases mediate late phosphorylation. Second, we find that SFKs act during the period of AChR cluster formation, and not thereafter, to stabilize AChR clusters following withdrawal of agrin. Thus, during cluster initiation, SFKs recruit a stabilization pathway that acts hours later. Third, we find that a single, brief pulse of agrin is sufficient to induce a pathway that clusters AChRs efficiently in the absence of agrin. This autonomous pathway, once triggered, leads to a rapid increase in MuSK phosphorylation; when a critical level of MuSK phosphorylation is reached, the clustering program is fully activated, leading to AChR clusters hours later.
