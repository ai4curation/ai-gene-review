Prostate androgen regulated (PAR) protein is a 148 amino acid polypeptide 
ubiquitously expressed in normal cells and overexpressed in many malignancies. 
Manipulation of PAR mRNA in DU145 and NIH3T3 cells indicated that its expression 
level is an important determinant of cell in vitro proliferation, clonogenicity 
in soft agar and in vivo tumorigenicity. In this study, we showed that PAR is a 
short-lived protein with a peak in G2/M phase. Using immunofluorescent 
antibodies we showed that PAR moves from centrosomes in prophase and metaphase 
to spindle midzone in anaphase, and concentrates to midbody in telophase and 
cytokinesis. During mitosis a fraction of PAR can also be detected in the 
cytoplasm. PAR pattern of expression and its dynamic localization suggested a 
functional relationship to chromosomal passenger proteins (CPP). This protein 
colocalized with Aurora A at centrosomes in metaphase, and with survivin at 
midbody in telophase and cytokinesis. It also formed complexes with Aurora A, 
and with survivin, Aurora B and INCENP. In addition, PAR increased Aurora B 
kinase activity on histone H3. The decreased PAR levels in DU145 cells resulted 
in defects in centrosome segregation, in failed cytokinesis and chromosome 
alignment, and in increased number of apoptotic cells, polyploidy and aberrant 
mitosis. It is known that such defects could lead to genomic instability and 
tumorigenesis. In this study we also confirm our earlier findings that PAR is 
overexpressed in many tumors. Due to its involvement in cell cycle and its 
overexpression in several human cancers PAR could represent an attractive target 
for therapeutic intervention.
