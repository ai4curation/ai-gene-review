Apoptotic cell death plays a normal role in various physiological processes, and 
deregulated apoptosis is a hallmark of several diseases, including cancer. Cell 
fate is dictated by the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic factors. Akt is 
one of these antiapoptotic factors, which must be activated through 
phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of Akt has previously been shown to be 
promoted by X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), another 
antiapoptotic protein dictating the fate of normal and cancer cells. However, 
the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We have observed that XIAP 
associates with PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten), 
the best characterized negative regulator of Akt phosphorylation, in vitro and 
in vivo. XIAP knockdown reduces constitutive mono- and polyubiquitination of 
PTEN, increases PTEN protein levels, and prevents nuclear accumulation of PTEN. 
Overexpression of XIAP induces polyubiquitination of PTEN and 
proteasome-dependent decrease of PTEN protein levels. RNA interference 
experiments showed that XIAP-induced regulation of Akt phosphorylation is 
PTEN-dependent. Additional experiments confirmed that XIAP also regulates PTEN 
in vivo; primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from XIAP(-/-) mice contain 
higher levels of PTEN protein, less mono- and polyubiquitinated PTEN, and less 
nuclear PTEN than primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from XIAP(+/+) 
mice. Finally, we found that XIAP can directly ubiquitinate PTEN in vitro. We 
thus propose that XIAP acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PTEN and promotes Akt 
activity by regulating PTEN content and compartmentalization.

Abstract

Apoptotic cell death plays a normal role in various physiological processes, and deregulated apoptosis is a hallmark of several diseases, including cancer. Cell fate is dictated by the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic factors. Akt is one of these antiapoptotic factors, which must be activated through phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of Akt has previously been shown to be promoted by X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), another antiapoptotic protein dictating the fate of normal and cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We have observed that XIAP associates with PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten), the best characterized negative regulator of Akt phosphorylation, in vitro and in vivo . XIAP knockdown reduces constitutive mono- and polyubiquitination of PTEN, increases PTEN protein levels, and prevents nuclear accumulation of PTEN. Overexpression of XIAP induces polyubiquitination of PTEN and proteasome-dependent decrease of PTEN protein levels. RNA interference experiments showed that XIAP-induced regulation of Akt phosphorylation is PTEN-dependent. Additional experiments confirmed that XIAP also regulates PTEN in vivo ; primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from XIAP −/− mice contain higher levels of PTEN protein, less mono- and polyubiquitinated PTEN, and less nuclear PTEN than primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from XIAP +/+ mice. Finally, we found that XIAP can directly ubiquitinate PTEN in vitro . We thus propose that XIAP acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PTEN and promotes Akt activity by regulating PTEN content and compartmentalization.

DISCUSSION

The mechanisms and factors regulating PTEN ubiquitination only begin to be unraveled. We have found that XIAP regulates PTEN ubiquitination, content, and compartmentalization in vitro , and probably in vivo as it also occurs in primary cells freshly derived from mice. Previous studies support a role for XIAP in negatively regulating PTEN content in vitro and in vivo . Decrease of XIAP protein levels in cancer cells in response to the apoptosis-inducing agent mesalazine is accompanied, among others, by an increase of PTEN content ( 20 ), and exposure of mice to the apoptosis-inducing agent rosiglitazone modestly up-regulates PTEN protein levels in HCT116-XIAP +/+ cell-derived tumors but markedly increases PTEN content in HCT116-XIAP −/− cell-derived tumors ( 21 ). These studies further suggest that XIAP can regulate PTEN content in response to non-physiological stimuli, and in compliance with those studies, we show here that physiological stimuli can regulate XIAP-PTEN interaction. It is likely that only physiological stimuli modifying XIAP levels impact Akt phosphorylation through the XIAP-PTEN axis because in the case of rapid induction of Akt phosphorylation in response to IGF-1, which was not accompanied by increased XIAP levels, no changes of PTEN content were observed.

NEDD4.1 has already been identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) for PTEN ( 18 ); however, E3 ligases for PTEN different from NEDD4 could exist because PTEN ubiquitination has been reported to occur in the absence of NEDD4, in vitro and in vivo ( 22 ). Based on our findings that XIAP associates with PTEN as well as ubiquitinated PTEN proteins in vitro and in vivo and that XIAP can directly ubiquitinate PTEN in vitro , we propose that XIAP can act as an E3 ligase for PTEN. It is likely that multiple E3 ligases can act on PTEN, ensuring constant post-transcriptional control of its activity, depending on environmental conditions. We observed that although monoubiquitinated PTEN proteins co-immunoprecipitate with XIAP in resting cells and knockdown of XIAP decreases both monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination of PTEN, overexpression of XIAP or exposure to XIAP-inducing factors such as TGF-β3 only induces polyubiquitination of PTEN. It is therefore possible that XIAP preferentially mono- or polyubiquitinates PTEN depending on environmental conditions. Similarly, others have evidenced that different ubiquitin ligases could be responsible for mono- and polyubiquitination of another factor, Smad4, which translocates between the cytoplasm and the nucleus similar to PTEN ( 17 ). Thus, although we have gathered evidence demonstrating that NEDD4 was not involved in XIAP-induced ubiquitination of PTEN, regulation of PTEN stability and compartmentalization is probably not the sole responsibility of XIAP. In vivo , for example, mono- and polyubiquitination of PTEN can still be detected in XIAP KO mice. Because c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 are increased in XIAP KO cells ( 23 ) and because these enzymes have been shown to act as E3 ligases ( 24 ), cIAP-1 or cIAP-2 could possibly be involved in mono- and/or polyubiquitination PTEN.

Nuclear localization of PTEN has been shown to be altered in human tumors, including prostate cancers ( 25 ). By regulating PTEN compartmentalization, XIAP could thus be one of the factors influencing susceptibility to and/or progression of prostate cancer. Hwang et al. ( 23 ) observed no significant difference between XIAP WT and KO transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice for the onset and progression of prostate cancer; again, this could be due to a compensatory increase of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 levels in XIAP KO cells ( 23 ). They did report, however, a trend toward more aggressive disease in XIAP-deficient mice ( 23 ), which is consistent with reduced nuclear localization of PTEN in the absence of XIAP.

The present study evidences a role for XIAP in down-regulating PTEN content and in promoting nuclear localization of PTEN. Because negative regulation of Akt phosphorylation only occurs when PTEN localizes to the cytoplasm ( 26 ), the ability of XIAP to promote nuclear import of PTEN likely constitutes an additional mechanism through which XIAP promotes Akt phosphorylation/activity. Considering the emerging roles that are ascribed to PTEN and Akt in cellular processes other than apoptosis/survival (such as DNA repair ( 27 )), the discovery of a role for XIAP in regulating the PTEN-Akt axis broadens the view of regulatory functions that can be attributed to XIAP.
