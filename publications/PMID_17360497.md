Huntington's disease is characterized by death of striatal projection neurons. 
We used a Cre/Lox transgenic approach to generate an animal model in which D1 
dopamine receptor (Drd1a)+ cells are progressively ablated in the postnatal 
brain. Striatal Drd1a, substance P, and dynorphin expression is progressively 
lost, whereas D2 dopamine receptor (Drd2) and enkephalin expression is 
up-regulated. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis demonstrated early 
elevation of the striatal choline/creatine ratio, a finding associated with 
extensive reactive striatal astrogliosis. Sequential MRI demonstrated a 
progressive reduction in striatal volume and secondary ventricular enlargement 
confirmed to be due to loss of striatal cells. Mutant mice had normal gait and 
rotarod performance but displayed hindlimb dystonia, locomotor hyperactivity, 
and handling-induced electrographically verified spontaneous seizures. 
Ethological assessment identified an increase in rearing and impairments in the 
oral behaviors of sifting and chewing. In line with the limbic seizure profile, 
cell loss, astrogliosis, microgliosis, and down-regulated dynorphin expression 
were seen in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. This study specifically implicates 
Drd1a+ cell loss with tail suspension hindlimb dystonia, hyperactivity, and 
abnormal oral function. The latter may relate to the speech and swallowing 
disturbances and the classic sign of tongue-protrusion motor impersistence 
observed in Huntington's disease. In addition, the findings of this study 
support the notion that Drd1a and Drd2 are segregated on striatal projection 
neurons.
