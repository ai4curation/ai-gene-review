Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B and PDGF beta-receptor (PDGFR beta) 
deficiency in mice is embryonic lethal and results in cardiovascular, renal, 
placental, and hematologic disorders. The hematologic disorders are described, 
and a correlation with hepatic hypocellularity is demonstrated. To explore 
possible causes, the colony-forming activity of fetal liver cells in vitro was 
assessed, and hematopoietic chimeras were demonstrated by the transplantation of 
mutant fetal liver cells into lethally irradiated recipients. It was found that 
mutant colony formation is equivalent to that of wild-type controls. 
Hematopoietic chimeras reconstituted with PDGF-B(-/-), PDGFR beta(-/-), or 
wild-type fetal liver cells show complete engraftment (greater than 98%) with 
donor granulocytes, monocytes, B cells, and T cells and display none of the 
cardiovascular or hematologic abnormalities seen in mutants. In mouse embryos, 
PDGF-B is expressed by vascular endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. After 
birth, expression is seen in macrophages and neurons. This study demonstrates 
that hematopoietic PDGF-B or PDGFR beta expression is not required for 
hematopoiesis or integrity of the cardiovascular system. It is argued that 
metabolic stress arising from mutant defects in the placenta, heart, or blood 
vessels may lead to impaired liver growth and decreased production of blood 
cells. The chimera models in this study will serve as valuable tools to test the 
role of PDGF in inflammatory and immune responses. (Blood. 2001;97:1990-1998)
