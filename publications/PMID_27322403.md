GeneCards, the human gene compendium, enables researchers to effectively 
navigate and inter-relate the wide universe of human genes, diseases, variants, 
proteins, cells, and biological pathways. Our recently launched Version 4 has a 
revamped infrastructure facilitating faster data updates, better-targeted data 
queries, and friendlier user experience. It also provides a stronger foundation 
for the GeneCards suite of companion databases and analysis tools. Improved data 
unification includes gene-disease links via MalaCards and merged biological 
pathways via PathCards, as well as drug information and proteome expression. 
VarElect, another suite member, is a phenotype prioritizer for next-generation 
sequencing, leveraging the GeneCards and MalaCards knowledgebase. It 
automatically infers direct and indirect scored associations between hundreds or 
even thousands of variant-containing genes and disease phenotype terms. 
VarElect's capabilities, either independently or within TGex, our comprehensive 
variant analysis pipeline, help prepare for the challenge of clinical projects 
that involve thousands of exome/genome NGS analyses. © 2016 by John Wiley &
