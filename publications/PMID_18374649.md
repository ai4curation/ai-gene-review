A key strategy to achieve regulated gene expression in higher eukaryotes is to 
prevent illegitimate signal-independent activation by imposing robust control on 
the dismissal of corepressors. Here, we report that many signaling pathways, 
including Notch, NF-kappaB, and nuclear receptor ligands, are subjected to a 
dual-repression "checkpoint" based on distinct corepressor complexes. Gene 
activation requires the release of both CtBP1/2- and NCoR/SMRT-dependent 
repression, through the coordinate action of two highly related exchange 
factors, the transducer beta-like proteins TBL1 and TBLR1, that license 
ubiquitylation and degradation of CtBP1/2 and NCoR/SMRT, respectively. 
Intriguingly, their function and differential specificity reside in only five 
specific Ser/Thr phosphorylation site differences, regulated by direct 
phosphorylation at the level of the promoter, as exemplified by the role of 
PKCdelta in TBLR1-dependent dismissal of NCoR. Thus, our data reveal a strategy 
of dual-factor repression checkpoints, in which dedicated exchange factors serve 
as sensors for signal-specific dismissal of distinct corepressors, with 
specificity imposed by upstream signaling pathways.
