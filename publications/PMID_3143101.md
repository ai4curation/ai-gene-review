The ADR6 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has an open reading frame which could 
encode a polypeptide of 1314 amino acids. The predicted mRNA encodes a protein 
with homopolymeric stretches of asparagine and threonine, particularly near its 
amino terminus and contains additional sequences consisting of polyglutamine 
repeats. The predicted protein also contains a potential metal binding 
(Cys)4-type finger near its carboxy-terminus. An ADR6/beta-galactosidase fusion 
protein was predominantly nuclear in location, consistent with its role as an 
activator of ADH2 transcription.
