Although genetic and biochemical studies suggest a role for Eps15 homology 
domain containing proteins in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the specific 
functions of these proteins have been elusive. Eps15 is found at the growing 
edges of clathrin-coated pits, leading to the hypothesis that it participates in 
the formation of coated vesicles. We have evaluated this hypothesis by examining 
the effect of Eps15 on clathrin assembly. We found that although Eps15 has no 
intrinsic ability to assemble clathrin, it potently stimulates the ability of 
the clathrin adaptor protein, AP180, to assemble clathrin at physiological pH. 
We have also defined the binding sites for Eps15 on squid AP180. These sites 
contain an NPF motif, and peptides derived from these binding sites inhibit the 
ability of Eps15 to stimulate clathrin assembly in vitro. Furthermore, when 
injected into squid giant presynaptic nerve terminals, these peptides inhibit 
the formation of clathrin-coated pits and coated vesicles during synaptic 
vesicle endocytosis. This is consistent with the hypothesis that Eps15 regulates 
clathrin coat assembly in vivo, and indicates that interactions between Eps15 
homology domains and NPF motifs are involved in clathrin-coated vesicle 
formation during synaptic vesicle recycling.
