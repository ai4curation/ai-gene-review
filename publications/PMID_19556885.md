Autophagy is a membrane-trafficking process that serves to deliver cytoplasmic 
proteins and organelles to the lysosome for degradation. The process is 
genetically defined and many of the factors involved are conserved from yeast to 
man. Recently, a number of new autophagy regulators have been defined, including 
the Damage-Regulated Autophagy Modulator (DRAM), which is a lysosomal protein 
that links autophagy and the tumor suppressor, p53. We describe here analysis of 
DRAM-related proteins which reveals evolutionary conservation and divergence of 
DRAM's role in autophagy. We report that humans have 5 other proteins that show 
significant homology to DRAM. The closest of these, which we have termed DRAM2, 
displays 45% identity and 67% conservation when compared to DRAM. Interestingly, 
although similar to DRAM in terms of homology, DRAM2 is different from DRAM as 
it not induced by p53 or p73. DRAM2 is also a lysosomal protein, but again 
unlike DRAM its overexpression does not modulate autophagy. In contrast to 
humans, the Drosophila genome only encodes one DRAM-like protein, which is 
approximately equal in similarity to human DRAM and DRAM2. This questions, 
therefore, whether DRAM function is conserved from fly to man or whether DRAM's 
capacity to regulate autophagy has evolved in higher eukaryotes. Expression of 
DmDRAM, however, clearly revealed an ability to modulate autophagy. This points, 
therefore, to a conserved role of DRAM in this process and that additional human 
proteins have more recently evolved which, while potentially sharing some 
similarities with DRAM, may not be as intrinsically connected to autophagy 
regulation.
