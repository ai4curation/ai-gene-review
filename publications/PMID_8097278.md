We have created yeast strains in which the mitochondrial chaperonin, hsp60, can 
be either physically depleted or functionally inactivated. Cells completely 
depleted of hsp60 stop growing but retain for awhile the capacity to 
reaccumulate hsp60. While this newly made hsp60 is targeted to and processed 
correctly within the mitochondrion, assembly of a functional hsp60 complex does 
not occur. Rather, the hsp60 monomers are localized in different-size soluble 
complexes containing another mitochondrial chaperone, the mitochondrial form of 
hsp70. A number of other mitochondrial matrix-targeted proteins synthesized in 
the absence of functional hsp60 are imported into mitochondria but often show 
some buildup of precursor forms and, unlike hsp60, accumulate as insoluble 
aggregates. By contrast, several mitochondrial proteins normally targeted to the 
intermembrane space show normal processing in the complete absence of a 
functional hsp60 complex. Similar and complementary results were obtained when 
we examined the metabolism of matrix- and intermembrane space-localized proteins 
in cells expressing three different temperature-sensitive alleles of HSP60. In 
all cases, matrix-targeted proteins synthesized at nonpermissive (i.e., 
hsp60-inactivating) temperatures were correctly targeted to and processed within 
mitochondria but accumulated predominantly or totally as insoluble aggregates. 
The metabolism of two intermembrane space proteins, cytochrome b2 and cytochrome 
c1, was unaffected at the nonpermissive temperature, as judged by the correct 
processing and complete solubility of newly synthesized forms of both proteins. 
These findings are discussed with regard to current models of intermembrane 
targeting.
