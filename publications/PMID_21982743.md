A human genome-wide linkage scan for obesity identified a linkage peak on 
chromosome 5q13-15. Positional cloning revealed an association of a rare 
haplotype to high body-mass index (BMI) in males but not females. The risk locus 
contains a single gene, "arrestin domain-containing 3" (ARRDC3), an 
uncharacterized α-arrestin. Inactivating Arrdc3 in mice led to a striking 
resistance to obesity, with greater impact on male mice. Mice with decreased 
ARRDC3 levels were protected from obesity due to increased energy expenditure 
through increased activity levels and increased thermogenesis of both brown and 
white adipose tissues. ARRDC3 interacted directly with β-adrenergic receptors, 
and loss of ARRDC3 increased the response to β-adrenergic stimulation in 
isolated adipose tissue. These results demonstrate that ARRDC3 is a 
gender-sensitive regulator of obesity and energy expenditure and reveal a 
surprising diversity for arrestin family protein functions.
