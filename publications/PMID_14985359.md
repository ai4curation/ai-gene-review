Cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin I are both unidirectional intracellular motors. 
Dynein moves cargo toward the cell center, and kinesin moves cargo toward the 
cell periphery. There is growing evidence that bi-directional motility is 
regulated in the cell, potentially through direct interactions between 
oppositely oriented motors. We have identified a direct interaction between 
cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin I. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay and affinity 
chromatography, we demonstrate that the intermediate chain of dynein binds to 
kinesin light chains 1 and 2. The interaction is both direct and specific. 
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate an interaction between endogenous 
proteins in rat brain cytosol. Double-label immunocytochemistry reveals a 
partial co-localization of vesicle-associated motor proteins. Together these 
observations suggest that soluble motors can interact, potentially allowing 
kinesin I to actively localize dynein to cellular sites of function. There is 
also a vesicle population with both dynein and kinesin I bound that may be 
capable of bi-directional motility along cellular microtubules.
