The Wilms' tumour suppressor protein (WT1) is a putative transcriptional 
regulatory protein with four zinc fingers, the last three of which have 
extensive sequence homology to the early growth response-1 (EGR-1) protein. 
Although a peptide encoding the zinc finger domain of WT1[-KTS] can bind to a 
consensus 9 bp EGR-1 binding site, current knowledge about the mechanisms of 
zinc finger-DNA interactions would predict a more extended recognition site for 
WT1. Using a WT1[-KTS] zinc finger peptide (WT1-ZFP) and the template 
oligonucleotide GCG-TGG-GCG-NNNNN in a binding site selection assay, we have 
determined that the highest affinity binding sites for WT1[-KTS] consist of a 12 
bp sequence GCG-TGG-GCG-(T/G)(G/A/T)(T/G). The binding of WT1-ZFP to a number of 
the selected sequences was measured by a quantitative nitrocellulose filter 
binding assay, and the results demonstrated that these sequences have a 4-fold 
higher affinity for the protein than the nonselected sequence GCG-TGG-GCG-CCC. 
The full length WT1 protein regulates transcription of reporter genes linked to 
these high affinity sequences. A peptide lacking the first zinc finger of 
WT1[-KTS], but containing the three zinc fingers homologous to EGR-1 failed to 
select any specific sequences downstream of the GCG-TGG-GCG consensus sequence 
in the binding site selection assay. DNA sequences in the fetal promoter of the 
insulin-like growth factor II gene that confer WT1 responsiveness in a transient 
transfection assay bind to the WT1-ZFP with affinities that vary according to 
the number of consensus bases each sequence possesses in the finger 1 subsite.
