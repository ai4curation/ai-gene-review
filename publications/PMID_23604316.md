Fat is stored or mobilized according to food availability. Malfunction of the 
mechanisms that ensure this coordination underlie metabolic diseases in humans. 
In mammals, lysosomal and autophagic function is required for normal fat storage 
and mobilization in the presence or absence of food. Autophagy is tightly linked 
to nutrients. However, if and how lysosomal lipolysis is coupled to nutritional 
status remains to be determined. Here we identify MXL-3 and HLH-30 (TFEB 
orthologue) [corrected] as transcriptional switches coupling lysosomal lipolysis 
and autophagy to nutrient availability and controlling fat storage and ageing in 
Caenorhabditis elegans. Transcriptional coupling of lysosomal lipolysis and 
autophagy to nutrients is also observed in mammals. Thus, MXL-3 and HLH-30 
orchestrate an adaptive and conserved cellular response to nutritional status 
and regulate lifespan.
