The multisubunit transcription elongation factor NELF (for negative elongation 
factor) acts together with DRB 
(5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole) sensitivity-inducing factor 
(DSIF)/human Spt4-Spt5 to cause transcriptional pausing of RNA polymerase II 
(RNAPII). NELF activity is associated with five polypeptides, A to E. NELF-A has 
sequence similarity to hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), the viral protein that 
binds to and activates RNAPII, whereas NELF-E is an RNA-binding protein whose 
RNA-binding activity is critical for NELF function. To understand the 
interactions of DSIF, NELF, and RNAPII at a molecular level, we identified the 
B, C, and D proteins of human NELF. NELF-B is identical to COBRA1, recently 
reported to associate with the product of breast cancer susceptibility gene 
BRCA1. NELF-C and NELF-D are highly related or identical to the protein called 
TH1, of unknown function. NELF-B and NELF-C or NELF-D are integral subunits that 
bring NELF-A and NELF-E together, and coexpression of these four proteins in 
insect cells resulted in the reconstitution of functionally active NELF. 
Detailed analyses using mutated recombinant complexes indicated that the small 
region of NELF-A with similarity to HDAg is critical for RNAPII binding and for 
transcriptional pausing. This study defines several important protein-protein 
interactions and opens the way for understanding the mechanism of DSIF- and 
NELF-induced transcriptional pausing.
