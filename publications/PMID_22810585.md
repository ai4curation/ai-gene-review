Viruses must enter host cells to replicate, assemble and propagate. Because of 
the restricted size of their genomes, viruses have had to evolve efficient ways 
of exploiting host cell processes to promote their own life cycles and also to 
escape host immune defence mechanisms. Many viral open reading frames (viORFs) 
with immune-modulating functions essential for productive viral growth have been 
identified across a range of viral classes. However, there has been no 
comprehensive study to identify the host factors with which these viORFs 
interact for a global perspective of viral perturbation strategies. Here we show 
that different viral perturbation patterns of the host molecular defence network 
can be deduced from a mass-spectrometry-based host-factor survey in a defined 
human cellular system by using 70 innate immune-modulating viORFs from 30 viral 
species. The 579 host proteins targeted by the viORFs mapped to an unexpectedly 
large number of signalling pathways and cellular processes, suggesting yet 
unknown mechanisms of antiviral immunity. We further experimentally verified the 
targets heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH 
kinase, the WNK (with-no-lysine) kinase family and USP19 (ubiquitin-specific 
peptidase 19) as vulnerable nodes in the host cellular defence system. 
Evaluation of the impact of viral immune modulators on the host molecular 
network revealed perturbation strategies used by individual viruses and by viral 
classes. Our data are also valuable for the design of broad and specific 
antiviral therapies.
