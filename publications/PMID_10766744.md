Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 and -5 (IGFBP-3 and -5) have been 
shown to bind insulin-like growth factor-I and -II (IGF-I and -II) with high 
affinity. Previous studies have proposed that the N-terminal region of IGFBP-5 
contains a hydrophobic patch between residues 49 and 74 that is required for 
high affinity binding. These studies were undertaken to determine if mutagenesis 
of several of these residues resulted in a reduction of the affinity of IGFBP-3 
and -5 for IGF-I. Substitutions for residues 68, 69, 70, 73, and 74 in IGFBP-5 
(changing one charged residue, Lys(68), to a neutral one and the four 
hydrophobic residues to nonhydrophobic residues) resulted in an approximately 
1000-fold reduction in the affinity of IGFBP-5 for IGF-I. Substitutions for 
homologous residues in IGFBP-3 also resulted in a >1000-fold reduction in 
affinity. The physiologic consequence of this reduction was that IGFBP-3 and -5 
became very weak inhibitors of IGF-I-stimulated cell migration and DNA 
synthesis. Likewise, the ability of IGFBP-5 to inhibit IGF-I-stimulated receptor 
phosphorylation was attenuated. These changes did not appear to be because of 
alterations in protein folding induced by mutagenesis, because the IGFBP-5 
mutant was fully susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by a specific IGFBP-5 
protease. In summary, residues 68, 69, 70, 73, and 74 in IGFBP-5 appear to be 
critical for high affinity binding to IGF-I. Homologous residues in IGFBP-3 are 
also required, suggesting that they form a similar binding pocket and that for 
both proteins these residues form an important component of the core binding 
site. The availability of these mutants will make it possible to determine if 
there are direct, non-IGF-I-dependent effects of IGFBP-3 and -5 on cellular 
physiologic processes in cell types that secrete IGF-I.
