3' end processing of most human mRNAs is carried out by the cleavage and 
polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF; CPF in yeast). Endonucleolytic 
cleavage of the nascent pre-mRNA defines the 3' end of the mature transcript, 
which is important for mRNA localization, translation, and stability. Cleavage 
must therefore be tightly regulated. Here, we reconstituted specific and 
efficient 3' endonuclease activity of human CPSF with purified proteins. This 
required the seven-subunit CPSF as well as three additional protein factors: 
cleavage stimulatory factor (CStF), cleavage factor IIm (CFIIm), and, 
importantly, the multidomain protein RBBP6. Unlike its yeast homolog Mpe1, which 
is a stable subunit of CPF, RBBP6 does not copurify with CPSF and is recruited 
in an RNA-dependent manner. Sequence and mutational analyses suggest that RBBP6 
interacts with the WDR33 and CPSF73 subunits of CPSF. Thus, it is likely that 
the role of RBBP6 is conserved from yeast to humans. Overall, our data are 
consistent with CPSF endonuclease activation and site-specific pre-mRNA cleavage 
being highly controlled to maintain fidelity in mRNA processing.
