Four genes expressed in the Anopheles gambiae adult female salivary glands and 
similar in sequence to the Aedes aegypti D7 gene were identified. The genes, 
called D7-related (D7r), are included in a single cluster encompassing 
approximately six kilobases on chromosome arm 3R. The deduced proteins contain 
secretory signals and they are probably injected by the mosquito into the host 
with the saliva during blood feeding. The region of similarity to D7 encompasses 
the carboxy-terminal part of the Ae. aegypti protein and the different An. 
gambiae D7r show a degree of similarity to each other, varying from 53% to 73%. 
The weak but significant similarity to members of a wide family of insect 
proteins, including odourant- and pheromone-binding proteins, raises the 
possibility that the D7r-encoded proteins may bind and/or carry small 
hydrophobic ligands.
