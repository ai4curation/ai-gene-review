N-linked glycosylation is an essential posttranslational modification of 
proteins in eukaryotes. The substrate of N-linked glycosylation, dolichol 
pyrophosphate (DolPP)-GlcNAc(2)Man(9)Glc(3), is assembled through a complex 
series of ordered reactions requiring the translocation of the intermediate 
DolPP-GlcNAc(2)Man(5) structure across the endoplasmic-reticulum membrane. A 
young patient diagnosed with a congenital disorder of glycosylation 
characterized by an intracellular accumulation of DolPP-GlcNAc(2)Man(5) was 
found to carry a homozygous point mutation in the RFT1 gene. The c.199C-->T 
mutation introduced the amino acid substitution p.R67C. The human RFT1 protein 
shares 22% identity with its yeast ortholog, which is involved in the 
translocation of DolPP-GlcNAc(2)Man(5) from the cytosolic into the lumenal side 
of the endoplasmic reticulum. Despite the low sequence similarity between the 
yeast and the human RFT1 proteins, we demonstrated both their functional 
orthology and the pathologic effect of the human p.R67C mutation by 
complementation assay in Deltarft1 yeast cells. The causality of the RFT1 p.R67C 
mutation was further established by restoration of normal glycosylation profiles 
in patient-derived fibroblasts after lentiviral expression of a normal RFT1 
cDNA. The definition of the RFT1 defect establishes the functional conservation 
of the DolPP-GlcNAc(2)Man(5) translocation process in eukaryotes. RFT1 
deficiency in both yeast and human cells leads to the accumulation of incomplete 
DolPP-GlcNAc(2)Man(5) and to a profound glycosylation disorder in humans.
