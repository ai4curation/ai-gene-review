Protein degradation mediated by the ubiquitin/proteasome system is essential for 
the elimination of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to 
adapt to ER stress. It has been reported that the AAA ATPase p97/VCP/CDC48 is 
required in this pathway for protein dislocation across the ER membrane and 
subsequent ubiquitin dependent degradation by the 26S proteasome in the cytosol. 
Throughout ER-associated protein degradation, p97 cooperates with a binary 
Ufd1/Npl4-complex. In Caenorhabditis elegans two homologs of p97, designated 
CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2, exist. Our results indicate that both p97 homologs 
interact with UFD-1/NPL-4 in a similar CDC-48(UFD-1/NPL-4) complex. RNAi 
mediated depletion of the corresponding genes induces ER stress resulting in 
hypersensitivity to conditions which induce increased levels of unfolded 
proteins in the ER lumen. Together, these data suggest an evolutionarily 
conserved retro-translocation machinery at the endoplasmic reticulum.
