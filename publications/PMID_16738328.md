The NOTCH1 receptor is cleaved within its extracellular domain by furin during 
its maturation, yielding two subunits that are held together noncovalently by a 
juxtamembrane heterodimerization (HD) domain. Normal NOTCH1 signaling is 
initiated by the binding of ligand to the extracellular subunit, which renders 
the transmembrane subunit susceptible to two successive cleavages within and C 
terminal to the heterodimerization domain, catalyzed by metalloproteases and 
gamma-secretase, respectively. Because mutations in the heterodimerization 
domain of NOTCH1 occur frequently in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(T-ALL), we assessed the effect of 16 putative tumor-associated mutations on 
Notch1 signaling and HD domain stability. We show here that 15 of the 16 
mutations activate canonical NOTCH1 signaling. Increases in signaling occur in a 
ligand-independent fashion, require gamma-secretase activity, and correlate with 
an increased susceptibility to cleavage by metalloproteases. The activating 
mutations cause soluble NOTCH1 heterodimers to dissociate more readily, either 
under native conditions (n = 3) or in the presence of urea (n = 11). One 
mutation, an insertion of 14 residues immediately N terminal to the 
metalloprotease cleavage site, increases metalloprotease sensitivity more than 
all others, despite a negligible effect on heterodimer stability by comparison, 
suggesting that the insertion may expose the S2 site by repositioning it 
relative to protective NOTCH1 ectodomain residues. Together, these studies show 
that leukemia-associated HD domain mutations render NOTCH1 sensitive to 
ligand-independent proteolytic activation through two distinct mechanisms.
