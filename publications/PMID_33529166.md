The coat protein I (COPI) complex mediates retrograde trafficking from the Golgi 
to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Five siblings with persistent bacterial and 
viral infections and defective humoral and cellular immunity had a homozygous 
p.K652E mutation in the γ1 subunit of COPI (γ1-COP). The mutation disrupts COPI 
binding to the KDEL receptor and impairs the retrieval of KDEL-bearing 
chaperones from the Golgi to the ER. Homozygous Copg1K652E mice had increased ER 
stress in activated T and B cells, poor antibody responses, and normal numbers 
of T cells that proliferated normally, but underwent increased apoptosis upon 
activation. Exposure of the mutants to pet store mice caused weight loss, 
lymphopenia, and defective T cell proliferation that recapitulated the findings 
in the patients. The ER stress-relieving agent tauroursodeoxycholic acid 
corrected the immune defects of the mutants and reversed the phenotype they 
acquired following exposure to pet store mice. This study establishes the role 
of γ1-COP in the ER retrieval of KDEL-bearing chaperones and thereby the 
importance of ER homeostasis in adaptive immunity.
