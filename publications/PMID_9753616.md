Stanniocalcin (STC) is a Ca- and phosphate-regulating hormone produced by the 
corpuscles of Stannius in bony fishes. The mammalian homologue of STC has 
recently been reported (STC1), which stimulates the phosphate uptake of kidney. 
Here we report the cloning of a second mammalian stanniocalcin (STC2) from the 
human osteosarcoma cDNA library. STC2 has 302 amino acid residues with 34% 
identity with STC1 and eel STC. STC2 has a conserved N-glycosylation site and is 
rich in cysteines as is the case with other stanniocalcins. STC2 has the same 
exon-intron boundaries as STC1. The culture medium of STC2-transfected CHO cells 
inhibited the promoter activity of Na-phosphate cotransporter (NaPi-3) and also 
inhibited the phosphate uptake of a kidney cell line (OK cells). Therefore, the 
function of STC2 seems to be opposite to that of STC1 on Na-phosphate 
cotransporter. Northern blot analysis revealed multiple transcripts in number of 
human tissues with high levels being present in skeletal muscle and heart. STC2 
was also expressed in mice widely and its expression was lower in 
hypophosphatemic mice (Hyp mice) in many organs. We have cloned a widely 
expressed new human stanniocalcin homologue which suppressed the expression of 
renal Na-phosphate cotransporter.
