Kruppel-like factor 5 (Klf5) is a transcription factor expressed by embryonic 
endodermal progenitors that form the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. A 
Klf5 floxed allele was efficiently deleted from the intestinal epithelium by a 
Cre transgene under control of the Shh promoter resulting in the inhibition of 
villus morphogenesis and epithelial differentiation. Although proliferation of 
the intestinal epithelium was maintained, the expression of Elf3, Pparγ, Atoh1, 
Ascl2, Neurog3, Hnf4α, Cdx1, and other genes associated with epithelial cell 
differentiation was inhibited in the Klf5-deficient intestines. At E18.5, 
Klf5(Δ/Δ) fetuses lacked the apical brush border characteristic of enterocytes, 
and a loss of goblet and enteroendocrine cells was observed. The failure to form 
villi was not attributable to the absence of HH or PDGF signaling, known 
mediators of this developmental process. Klf5-deletion blocked the decrease in 
FoxA1 and Sox9 expression that accompanies normal villus morphogenesis. KLF5 
directly inhibited activity of the FoxA1 promoter, and in turn FOXA1 inhibited 
Elf3 gene expression in vitro, linking the observed loss of Elf3 with the 
persistent expression of FoxA1 observed in Klf5-deficient mice. Genetic network 
analysis identified KLF5 as a key transcription factor regulating intestinal 
cell differentiation and cell adhesion. These studies indicate a novel 
requirement for KLF5 to initiate morphogenesis of the early endoderm into a 
compartmentalized intestinal epithelium comprised of villi and terminally 
differentiated cells.

Abstract

Kruppel-like factor 5 ( Klf5 ) is a transcription factor expressed by embryonic endodermal progenitors that form the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. A Klf5 floxed allele was efficiently deleted from the intestinal epithelium by a Cre transgene under control of the Shh promoter resulting in the inhibition of villus morphogenesis and epithelial differentiation. Although proliferation of the intestinal epithelium was maintained, the expression of Elf3, Pparγ, Atoh1, Ascl2, Neurog3, Hnf4α, Cdx1, and other genes associated with epithelial cell differentiation was inhibited in the Klf5 -deficient intestines. At E18.5, Klf5 Δ/Δ fetuses lacked the apical brush border characteristic of enterocytes, and a loss of goblet and enteroendocrine cells was observed. The failure to form villi was not attributable to the absence of HH or PDGF signaling, known mediators of this developmental process. Klf5 -deletion blocked the decrease in FoxA1 and Sox9 expression that accompanies normal villus morphogenesis. KLF5 directly inhibited activity of the FoxA1 promoter, and in turn FOXA1 inhibited Elf3 gene expression in vitro, linking the observed loss of Elf3 with the persistent expression of FoxA1 observed in Klf5 -deficient mice. Genetic network analysis identified KLF5 as a key transcription factor regulating intestinal cell differentiation and cell adhesion. These studies indicate a novel requirement for KLF5 to initiate morphogenesis of the early endoderm into a compartmentalized intestinal epithelium comprised of villi and terminally differentiated cells.

INTRODUCTION

The primitive endoderm forms the gut tube extending from the rostral to caudal ends of the embryo. Early patterning of the gut is defined along the proximal-distal axis by restricted patterns of transcription factor expression i.e. Sox2 is restricted to the proximal regions that will develop into the esophagus and stomach ( Raghoebir et al., 2012 ). Cdx2 expression is restricted to more distal regions giving rise to the small intestine and colon ( Gao et al., 2009 ). In contrast, other factors, including Klf5, FoxAl, and Sox9, are initially expressed along the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract ( Bagheri-Fam et al., 2006 ; Besnard et al., 2004 ; Moore-Scott et al., 2007 ). Beginning on approximately embryonic day 14.5 of gestation (E14.5), the pseudostratified epithelium of the intestine transitions to a single layered columnar epithelium as villi begin to form. Villi are finger-like projections of terminally differentiated epithelium and supporting lamina propria that increase the luminal surface area of the intestine. Villus formation ensues between E15–E16.5 in the mouse, beginning proximally and proceeding distally. By E18.5, villi are present throughout the intestine and terminally differentiated absorptive (enterocyte) and secretory (goblet and neuroendocrine) cells are present. Between the villi is a highly proliferative intervillus region that will give rise to the crypts of Lieberkuhn, where stem cells reside in the mature organ (for review see, Spence et al., 2011 ). Many studies on intestinal maturation have focused on the role of the crypt in maintaining the villi and the epithelial cell types found in the mature intestine. Factors regulating the initial establishment of the villus are less well understood. In the present study, we identified an important role of Kruppel-like factor 5 ( Klf5 ) in formation of the fetal intestine.

Klf5 is a member of a large family of transcription factors that share a characteristic C 2 H 2 zinc-finger DNA binding domain. Klf5 is expressed in many tissues where it both activates and represses transcription of target genes( Dong and Chen, 2009 ). In embryonic stem cells, KLF5 plays an important role in self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency ( Nandan and Yang, 2009 ). During mouse embryogenesis, tissue specific deletion of Klf5 demonstrates its requirement for implantation ( Sun et al., 2012 ), adipocyte differentiation ( Oishi et al., 2005 ), bladder urothelial maturation ( Bell et al., 2011 ), terminal maturation of lung epithelial cells ( Wan et al., 2008 ), and postnatal- development of the eyelid and cornea ( Kenchegowda et al., 2011 ). Klƒ5 is highly expressed throughout development in the gastrointestinal epithelium ( Dong and Chen, 2009 ). In the adult intestine, KLF5 co-localizes with highly proliferative cells within the crypt. A recent study by McConnell et al (2011) demonstrated that deletion of KLF5 in the postnatal intestinal epithelium disrupted crypt architecture and the balance between goblet and enteroendocrine cells within the colon. In the present study, we demonstrate that KLF5 also plays a pivotal role in establishing the villus in the fetal intestine prior to formation of the crypts. In the absence of villus formation, terminal maturation of small intestine and colonic cell types was inhibited by loss of KLF5.

DISCUSSION

Deletion of Klf5 in the early endoderm using the Shh-Cre transgene demonstrated that KLF5 is required for villus morphogenesis and differentiation of multiple intestinal epithelial cell types. Temporally controlled deletion of Klf5 by tamoxifen administration at E13.5 indicated that KLF5 is required between E13.5–E14.5, just prior to villus emergence.

The Klf5 Δ/Δ intestines failed to form villi despite expressing factors known to mediate epithelial-mesenchymal signaling essential for villus formation including Shh, Bmp4, PDGFA, and PDGFRα. The mesenchyme of Klf5 Δ/Δ intestines was competent to respond to epithelial HH signals as evidenced by increased Ptc1 and Gli2 expression at E16.5 likely mediated by continued expression of Shh by the epithelium. Although deletion of Klf5 was associated with perturbed regulation of several components of the HH pathway, it is not clear how these alterations contributed to the observed absence of villi. Inhibition of all HH signaling by epithelial over-expression of the HH inhibitor, Hhip, resulted in formation of a proliferative, flattened epithelium similar to that generated by Klf5 deficiency ( Madison et al., 2005 ). A less severe intestinal phenotype was seen following deletion of Shh or Ihh individually ( Ramalho-Santos et al., 2000 ). The reduction in Ihh expression alone is not sufficient to explain the lack of villus formation in Klf5 Δ/Δ intestines, since Ihh (−/−) fetuses are unable to maintain proliferation in the intervillus region resulting in small villi ( Ramalho-Santos et al., 2000 ). Proliferating cells were detected throughout the Klf5 Δ/Δ intestinal epithelium at all developmental time points in the absence of formation of an intervillus region.

Villus emergence is associated with the formation of condensed clusters of mesenchyme expressing Pdgfrα, Bmp4, and Bmp2 ( Karlsson et al., 2000 ). In the present study, subepithelial clusters were present in the Klf5 Δ/Δ mesenchyme particularly in the proximal intestine. These clusters were associated with emerging villi that subsequently failed to elongate and mature resulting in a few very short, villus-like structures. Within distal segments of the Klf5 Δ/Δ intestine, where KLF5 recombination occurs efficiently at an earlier developmental time point, mesenchymal clusters expressing PDGFRα were not observed as frequently and a flattened epithelium was observed at later developmental timepoints. Since E-cadherin was detected not only on the lateral membranes of the intestinal epithelium but also the luminal and basal surfaces ( Fig. 2 G vs. H ), the inefficiency in inducing mesenchymal cluster formation could be attributable to a failure of PDGFA to be normally partitioned to the basal surface of the epithelial cells. Consistent with this possibility, the microarray analysis of intestines from Klf5 Δ/Δ embryos identified reduced expression of mRNAs involved in cellular trafficking, including several members of the Rab family.

The present data indicate that specification of the crypt-villus axis is required for terminal differentiation of the intestinal epithelium. In the absence of villi, Klf5 Δ/Δ E18.5 fetuses lacked an apical brush border; goblet and enteroendocrine cells were rarely detected; and reductions in the expression of mRNAs associated with maturation of specific cell lineages, including Elf3 (enterocytes), Atoh1, Tff3 (goblet cells), and Neurog3 (enteroendocrine cells) were demonstrated. Supportive of this concept, newborn Klf5 fl/fl ;VillinCre mice also had sparse villi and most died soon after birth ( McConnell et al., 2011 ). Terminally differentiated intestinal epithelial cells are absent in mice lacking Cdx2 ( Gao et al., 2009 ; Hryniuk et al., 2012 ). Analogous to the Klf5 Δ/Δ intestines, Hnf1α, Hnf-4α, Isx and Cdx1 mRNAs were reduced in E12.5–E14.5 Cdx2 null embryos in which villus hypoplasia was observed by E16.5 in the presence of a highly proliferative epithelium ( Gao et al., 2009 ). In contrast, nascent villi formed in Tcf4 (−/−) embryos as well as terminally differentiated enterocytes and goblet cells ( Korinek et al., 1998 ). Taken together, these observations support the concepts that villus morphogenesis is closely linked with terminal maturation of intestinal epithelial cells and that Klf5 and Cdx2 are required for intestinal morphogenesis and terminal differentiation.

The CDX-HNF centered “transcriptional regulation of cell differentiation” and the claudin centered “cell adhesion” sub-networks identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis are interconnected since CDX and HNF family members can transcriptionally activate the Claudins. The present study supports the concept that CDX and HNF factors work in concert with Claudins to control epithelial cell shape changes likely required for villus morphogenesis. Villus morphogenesis is similarly impaired in Klf5 Δ/Δ and Cdx2 (−/−) embryos ( Gao et al., 2009 ). Supportive of this concept, late fetal loss of intestinal epithelial E-cadherin resulted in regions lacking villi and other regions possessed blunted or misshapened villi ( Bondow et al., 2012 ).

Upstream regulator analysis predicted FOXA1/2 as one of the most likely upstream regulators of intestinal epithelial maturation based on the significant overlap between down regulated genes in Klf5 Δ/Δ mice and known transcriptional targets of FOXA1/2. Transcriptional network analysis supports the concept that FOXA1 is an important transcriptional hub regulating Cdx2, Hnf1α, Hnf4α and Hnf4γ ( Fig. 7A ). The findings that FOXA1 expression is normally restricted during villus emergence, and that FOXA1 was maintained at high levels in Klf5 Δ/Δ intestines, support the importance of our finding that KLF5 repressed the FoxA1 promoter in vitro . ChIP-seq data acquired from KLF5 over-expressing ES cells confirmed an interaction between KLF5 and the FoxA1 promoter supporting a model in which KLF5 directly regulates transcription of FoxA1 ( Parisi et al., 2010 ). The Klf5 Δ/Δ epithelium was highly proliferative and continued to express high levels of FOXA1 and SOX9 at developmental stages when the expression of both genes is normally restricted suggesting that the Klf5 Δ/Δ epithelium is maintained in an immature state. An undifferentiated epithelium that lacked villi also formed in mice after temporal deletion of KLF5 at E13.5, indicating that KLF5 activity is required at the onset of villus morphogenesis at ~E14.5–E15.5, co-incident with the temporal decrease in FOXA1 expression. Since KLF5 and FOXA1 are co-expressed throughout earlier phases of gut morphogenesis, the temporal signal that would induce KLF5 to inhibit FOXA1 expression is currently unknown. KLF5 both activates and inhibits gene expression depending on the post-translational modifications made in response to extracellular stimuli ( Bateman et al., 2004 ; Zheng et al., 2011 ). The failure of the Klf5 Δ/Δ intestinal epithelium to mature is consistent with a recent report indicating that changes in the levels of FOXA1 can mediate dramatic changes in the activity of pre- established enhancers by altering the binding affinities of nuclear hormone receptors ( Wang et al., 2011 ). FOXA1 recruits transcriptional inhibitors including HDAC7 and Groucho related genes to repress target gene expression ( Malik et al., 2010 ; Santisteban et al., 2010 ). The finding that FOXA1 inhibited the Elf3 promoter, a gene required for maturation of the absorptive enterocytes within the intestine, provides a plausible mechanism by which KLF5 regulates intestinal development by controlling a network of transcription factors. In the context of enterocyte differentiation, KLF5 inhibits FoxA1 and thus allows expression of Elf3 to direct terminal differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. Notably, KLF5 also interacts with class 1 HDACs ( Zheng et al., 2011 ). In the fetal intestine, HDACs 1 and 2 are expressed by the epithelium and their expression declines between E13–E15, coincident with the onset of terminal differentiation and villus morphogenesis ( Tou et al., 2004 ). Thus in the KLF5 deficient epithelium the promoters of some terminal differentiation markers may not be properly poised for activation, thus prohibiting intestinal maturation.

KLF5 is not required for embryonic intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. In the present study and after targeted deletion of Klf5 in the adult intestinal epithelium ( McConnell et al., 2011 ), proliferation was maintained. An increase in the number of Ki67-positive mitotic cells was also observed postnatally in Klf5 -deficient ocular surface epithelial cells, accompanied by failure to form goblet cells ( Kenchegowda et al., 2011 ). Thus, in embryonic, postnatal, and adult epithelium, KLF5 is required for transitioning undifferentiated cells towards a terminally differentiated fate ( Kenchegowda et al., 2011 ; McConnell et al., 2011 ).

In summary, these studies indicate a novel requirement of KLF5 to initiate morphogenesis of the early endoderm into a compartmentalized intestinal epithelium comprised of villi. The data support the concept that KLF5 orchestrates villus morphogenesis in part by repression of FoxA1 expression that in turn alleviates FOXA1 mediated repression of the terminal differentiation factor Elf3 .
