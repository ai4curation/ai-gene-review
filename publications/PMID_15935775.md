The leucine-rich-repeat receptor serine/threonine kinase, BRI1, is a 
cell-surface receptor for brassinosteroids (BRs), the steroid hormones of 
plants, yet its activation mechanism is unknown. Here, we report a unique 
autoregulatory mechanism of BRI1 activation. Removal of BRI1's C terminus leads 
to a hypersensitive receptor, indicated by suppression of dwarfism of 
BR-deficient and BR-perception mutants and by enhanced BR signaling as a result 
of elevated phosphorylation of BRI1. Several sites in the C-terminal region can 
be phosphorylated in vitro, and transgenic Arabidopsis expressing BRI1 mutated 
at these sites demonstrates an essential role of phosphorylation in BRI1 
activation. BRI1 is a ligand-independent homo-oligomer, as evidenced by the 
transphosphorylation of BRI1 kinase in vitro, the dominant-negative effect of a 
kinase-inactive BRI1 in transgenic Arabidopsis, and coimmunoprecipitation 
experiments. Our results support a BRI1-activation model that involves 
inhibition of kinase activity by its C-terminal domain, which is relieved upon 
ligand binding to the extracellular domain.
