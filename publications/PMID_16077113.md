The products of the hexacistronic spoVA operon of Bacillus subtilis may be 
involved in the transport of dipicolinic acid into the forespore during 
sporulation and its release during spore germination. The major hydrophilic 
coding region of B. subtilis spoVAD was cloned, the protein was expressed in 
Escherichia coli as a His tag fusion protein, and a rabbit antiserum was raised 
against the purified protein. Western blot analyses of fractions from B. 
subtilis spores showed that SpoVAD is an integral inner membrane protein present 
at levels >50-fold higher than those of the spore's nutrient germinant receptors 
that are also present in the inner membrane. SpoVAD also persisted in outgrowing 
spores.
