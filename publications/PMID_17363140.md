Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) activate transcription by recruiting coactivator 
complexes such as histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and the mediator complex, to 
increase chromatin accessibility by general transcription factors and to promote 
transcription initiation. Indirect evidences have suggested a role for the 
ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF in RAR-mediated 
transcription. Here we demonstrate that two highly related subunits of the core 
SWI/SNF complex, BAF60c1 and BAF60c2, interact physically with retinoid 
receptors and are coactivators for RARs. This coactivating property is dependent 
on SRC1 expression, showing that HATs and SWI/SNF cooperate in this 
retinoid-controlled transcriptional process.
