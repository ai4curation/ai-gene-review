The paired box homeodomain Pax6 is crucial for endocrine cell development and 
function and plays an essential role in glucose homeostasis. Indeed, mutations 
of Pax6 are associated with diabetic phenotype. Importantly, homozygous mutant 
mice for Pax6 are characterized by markedly decreased β and δ cells and absent α 
cells. To better understand the critical role that Pax6 exerts in 
glucagon-producing cells, we developed a model of primary rat α cells. To study 
the transcriptional network of Pax6 in adult and differentiated α cells, we 
generated Pax6-deficient primary rat α cells and glucagon-producing cells, using 
either specific siRNA or cells expressing constitutively a dominant-negative 
form of Pax6. In primary rat α cells, we confirm that Pax6 controls the 
transcription of the Proglucagon and processing enzyme PC2 genes and identify 
three new target genes coding for MafB, cMaf, and NeuroD1/Beta2, which are all 
critical for Glucagon gene transcription and α cell differentiation. 
Furthermore, we demonstrate that Pax6 directly binds and activates the promoter 
region of the three genes through specific binding sites and that constitutive 
expression of a dominant-negative form of Pax6 in glucagon-producing cells 
(InR1G9) inhibits the activities of the promoters. Finally our results suggest 
that the critical role of Pax6 action on α cell differentiation is independent 
of those of Arx and Foxa2, two transcription factors that are necessary for α 
cell development. We conclude that Pax6 is critical for α cell function and 
differentiation through the transcriptional control of key genes involved in 
glucagon gene transcription, proglucagon processing, and α cell differentiation.
