Pelham previously proposed that the hsp70 family of heat shock proteins could 
prevent the formation and/or allow the dissolution of protein aggregates created 
during stress conditions. We confirmed this hypothesis by showing that the E. 
coli hsp70 homolog, the dnaK gene product, protects the host RNA polymerase 
enzyme from heat inactivation in an ATP-independent reaction. In addition, we 
show that heat-inactivated and aggregated RNA polymerase is both disaggregated 
and reactivated following simultaneous incubation with DnaK protein and 
hydrolyzable ATP. The DnaK756 mutant protein has lost the ability to 
disaggregate the inactivated RNA polymerase enzyme. Our results demonstrate that 
the DnaK protein contributes to E. coli's growth not only by protecting some 
enzymes from denaturation but also by reactivating some once they are misfolded 
or aggregated.
