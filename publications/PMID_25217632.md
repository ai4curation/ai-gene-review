Rab proteins are small GTPases that regulate transport between the different 
compartments of the endomembrane system in eukaryotic cells. Here, we show that 
Rab7b, a Rab that controls the transport between late endosomes and the trans 
Golgi network, interacts directly with myosin II. We illustrate the functional 
relevance of this interaction, demonstrating that myosin II mediates the 
transport of Rab7b endosomes, as Rab7b dynamics are strongly affected after 
myosin II depletion or inhibition. We also demonstrate that a member of the Rab 
family regulates actin remodeling and, consequently, influences cell adhesion, 
polarization and migration. We find the molecular mechanism by which Rab7b 
influences stress fiber formation - through controlling the activation status of 
the small GTPase RhoA and therefore influencing myosin light chain 
phosphorylation. Our findings reveal a newly identified role for Rab proteins 
outside of their canonical role in intracellular trafficking, identifying Rab7b 
as a coordinator of cytoskeletal organization.
