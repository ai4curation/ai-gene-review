To investigate eosinophil stimulation by chemokines we developed a sensitive 
assay of leukocyte shape change, the gated autofluorescence/forward scatter 
assay. Leukocyte shape change responses are mediated through rearrangements of 
the cellular cytoskeleton in a dynamic process typically resulting in a 
polarized cell and are essential to the processes of leukocyte migration from 
the microcirculation into sites of inflammation. We examined the actions of the 
chemokines eotaxin, eotaxin-2, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), 
MCP-3, MCP-4, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and 
IL-8 on leukocytes in mixed cell suspensions and focused on the responses of 
eosinophils to C-C chemokines. Those chemokines acting on CCR3 induced a rapid 
shape change in eosinophils from all donors; of these, eotaxin and eotaxin-2 
were the most potent. Responses to MCP-4 were qualitatively different, showing 
marked reversal of shape change responses with agonist concentration and 
duration of treatment. In contrast, MIP-1alpha induced a potent response in 
eosinophils from a small and previously undescribed subgroup of donors via a 
non-CCR3 pathway likely to be CCR1 mediated. Incubation of leukocytes at 37 
degrees C for 90 min in the absence of extracellular calcium up-regulated 
responses to MCP-4 and MIP-1alpha in the majority of donors, and there was a 
small increase in responses to eotaxin. MIP-1alpha responsiveness in vivo may 
therefore be a function of both CCR1 expression levels and the regulated 
efficiency of coupling to intracellular signaling pathways. The observed 
up-regulation of MIP-1alpha signaling via non-CCR3 pathways may play a role in 
eosinophil recruitment in inflammatory states such as occurs in the asthmatic 
lung.
