Two DNA antirestriction systems of bacteriophage P1, darA, and darB: 
characterization of darA- phages.

Iida S, Streiff MB, Bickle TA, Arber W.

Bacteriophage P1 is only weakly restricted when it infects cells carrying type I 
restriction and modification systems even though DNA purified from P1 phage 
particles is a good substrate for type I restriction enzymes in vitro. Here we 
show that this protection against restriction is due to the products of two 
phage genes which we call darA and darB (dar for defense against restriction). 
Each of the dar gene products provides protection against a different subset of 
type I restriction systems. The darA and darB gene products are found in the 
phage head and protect any DNA packaged into a phage head, including transduced 
chromosomal markers, from restriction. The proteins must, therefore, be injected 
into recipient cells along with the DNA. The proteins act strictly in cis. For 
example, upon double infection of restricting cells with dar+ and dar- P1 
phages, the dar+ genomes are protected from restriction while the dar- genomes 
are efficiently restricted.
