Sphingosine-1-phosphate is a bioactive sphingolipid that regulates 
proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. 
Sphingosine-1-phosphate is irreversibly degraded by the highly conserved enzyme 
sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase. Recent studies have suggested that 
sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase expression affects animal development and cell 
fate decisions. Despite its crucial role, mechanisms affecting expression of 
sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase remain poorly understood. In this study, 
regulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase gene expression was investigated in 
Caenorhabditis elegans, where lyase expression is spatially restricted to cells 
of the developing and adult gut and is essential for normal development. 
Deletion analysis and generation of transgenic worms combined with fluorescence 
microscopy identified a 350-nucleotide sequence upstream of the ATG start site 
necessary for maximal lyase expression in adult worms. Site-specific mutagenesis 
of a GATA transcription factor-binding motif in the promoter led to loss of 
reporter expression. Knockdown of the gut-specific GATA transcription factor 
ELT-2 by RNA interference similarly led to loss of reporter expression. ELT-2 
interacted with the GATA factor-binding motif in vitro and was also capable of 
driving expression of a Caenorhabditis elegans lyase promoter-beta-galactosidase 
reporter in a heterologous yeast system. These studies demonstrate that ELT-2 
regulates sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase expression in vivo. Additionally, we 
demonstrate that the human sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase gene is regulated by a 
GATA transcription factor. Overexpression of GATA-4 led to both an increase in 
activity of a reporter gene as well as an increase in endogenous 
sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase protein.
