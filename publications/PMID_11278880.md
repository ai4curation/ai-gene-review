By associating with specific partner molecules and with each other, the 
tetraspanins are thought to assemble multimolecular complexes that may be 
especially relevant with respect to metastasis. We have previously identified a 
135-kDa molecule (CD9P-1) as a major molecular partner of CD9 in cancer cell 
lines. This molecule was identified, after immunoaffinity purification and mass 
spectrometry analysis, as the protein encoded by the KIAA1436 gene and the human 
ortholog of a rat protein known as FPRP. Cross-linking experiments detected a 
complex of the size of CD9 plus CD9P-1, showing that these glycoproteins 
directly associate with each other, probably in the absence of any other 
molecule. The use of chimeric CD9/CD82 molecules revealed the role of the second 
half of CD9, comprising the large extracellular loop and the fourth 
transmembrane domain. CD9P-1 was also shown to form separate complexes with CD81 
and with an unidentified 175-kDa molecule. It also associated with other 
tetraspanins under conditions maintaining tetraspanin/tetraspanin interactions. 
The identification of a protein strongly linked to the tetraspanin web and the 
production of a specific monoclonal antibody will help to further characterize 
the role of this "web" under physiological and pathological conditions.
