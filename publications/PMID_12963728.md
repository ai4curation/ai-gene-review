The mammalian ATM/PI 3-kinase-related TRRAP protein was previously found to be a 
component of a multi-protein histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex containing 
the HAT TIP60. In this report, we identify a previously uncharacterized protein 
encoded by the FLJ10914 ORF, which we designate MRGBP, as a new component of the 
TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex. In addition, through purification of MRGBP and its 
associated proteins from HeLa cell nuclear extracts, we identify the thyroid 
receptor coactivating protein (TRCp120), DMAP1, and the related MRG15 and MRGX 
proteins as MRGBP-associating proteins, and we present biochemical evidence that 
they are previously unrecognized components of the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex. 
Taken together, our findings shed new light on the structure and function of the 
mammalian TRRAP/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex.
