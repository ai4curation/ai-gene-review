Combined factor V and factor VIII deficiency (F5F8D) is a rare, autosomal 
recessive coagulation disorder. F5F8D is genetically linked to mutations in the 
transmembrane lectin ERGIC-53 and its soluble interaction partner MCFD2. The 
ERGIC-53/MCFD2 protein complex functions as transport receptor of coagulation 
factors V and VIII by mediating their export from the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER). Here, we studied a F5F8D patient who was found to be a compound 
heterozygote for 2 novel mutations in MCFD2: a large deletion of 8.4 kb 
eliminating the 5'UTR of the gene and a nonsense mutation resulting in the 
deletion of only 3 amino acids (DeltaSLQ) from the C-terminus of MCFD2. 
Biochemical and structural analysis of the DeltaSLQ mutant demonstrated impaired 
binding to ERGIC-53 due to modification of the 3-dimensional structure of MCFD2. 
Our results highlight the importance of the ERGIC-53/MCFD2 protein interaction 
for the efficient secretion of coagulation factors V and VIII.
