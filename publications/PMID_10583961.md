FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), which acts in parallel with the meristem-identity gene 
LEAFY (LFY) to induce flowering of Arabidopsis, was isolated by activation 
tagging. Like LFY, FT acts partially downstream of CONSTANS (CO), which promotes 
flowering in response to long days. Unlike many other floral regulators, the 
deduced sequence of the FT protein does not suggest that it directly controls 
transcription or transcript processing. Instead, it is similar to the sequence 
of TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1), an inhibitor of flowering that also shares sequence 
similarity with membrane-associated mammalian proteins.
