Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the first enzyme of the 
mitochondrial respiratory chain and is composed of 45 subunits in humans, making 
it one of the largest known multi-subunit membrane protein complexes. Complex I 
exists in supercomplex forms with respiratory chain complexes III and IV, which 
are together required for the generation of a transmembrane proton gradient used 
for the synthesis of ATP. Complex I is also a major source of damaging reactive 
oxygen species and its dysfunction is associated with mitochondrial disease, 
Parkinson's disease and ageing. Bacterial and human complex I share 14 core 
subunits that are essential for enzymatic function; however, the role and 
necessity of the remaining 31 human accessory subunits is unclear. The 
incorporation of accessory subunits into the complex increases the cellular 
energetic cost and has necessitated the involvement of numerous assembly factors 
for complex I biogenesis. Here we use gene editing to generate human knockout 
cell lines for each accessory subunit. We show that 25 subunits are strictly 
required for assembly of a functional complex and 1 subunit is essential for 
cell viability. Quantitative proteomic analysis of cell lines revealed that loss 
of each subunit affects the stability of other subunits residing in the same 
structural module. Analysis of proteomic changes after the loss of specific 
modules revealed that ATP5SL and DMAC1 are required for assembly of the distal 
portion of the complex I membrane arm. Our results demonstrate the broad 
importance of accessory subunits in the structure and function of human complex 
I. Coupling gene-editing technology with proteomics represents a powerful tool 
for dissecting large multi-subunit complexes and enables the study of complex 
dysfunction at a cellular level.
