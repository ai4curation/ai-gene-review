The activation/inactivation cycle of STAT transcription factors entails their 
transition between different dimer conformations. Unphosphorylated STATs can 
dimerize in an antiparallel conformation via extended interfaces of the globular 
N-domains, whereas STAT activation triggers a parallel dimer conformation with 
mutual phosphortyrosine:SH2 domain interactions, resulting in DNA-binding and 
nuclear retention. However, despite the crucial role of STAT tyrosine 
phosphorylation in cytokine signaling, it has not been determined how this 
modification affects the stability and the conformational flexibility of STAT 
dimers. Here, we use analytical ultracentrifugation and electrophoretic mobility 
shift assay (EMSA) to study the association of STAT1 in solution before and 
after tyrosine phosphorylation. It is revealed that STAT1 formed high-affinity 
dimers (K(d) of approximately 50 nM) with estimated half-lives of 20-40 min 
irrespective of the phosphorylation status. Our results demonstrate that 
parallel and antiparallel conformations of STAT1 were present simultaneously, 
supported by mutually exclusive interfaces; and the transition between 
conformations occurred through affinity-driven dissociation/association 
reactions. Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation was dispensable for DNA binding, 
but the phosphorylation enforced preformed SH2 domain-mediated dimers, thus 
enhancing the DNA-binding activity of STAT1 >200-fold. Moreover, upon STAT1 
activation the N-domains adopted an open conformation and engaged in interdimer 
interactions, as demonstrated by their participation in tetramerization instead 
of dimerization. Yet, homotypic N-domain interactions are not conserved in the 
STAT family, because the N-domain dissociation constants of STAT1, STAT3, and 
STAT4 differed by more than three orders of magnitude. In conclusion, STAT1 
constantly oscillated between different dimer conformations, whereby the 
abundance of the dimerization interfaces was determined by tyrosine 
phosphorylation.
