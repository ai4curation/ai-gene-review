The BH4 domain of Bcl2 is required for its antiapoptotic function, thus 
constituting a promising anticancer target. We identified a small-molecule 
Bcl2-BH4 domain antagonist, BDA-366, that binds BH4 with high affinity and 
selectivity. BDA-366-Bcl2 binding induces conformational change in Bcl2 that 
abrogates its antiapoptotic function, converting it from a survival molecule to 
a cell death inducer. BDA-366 suppresses growth of lung cancer xenografts 
derived from cell lines and patient without significant normal tissue toxicity 
at effective doses. mTOR inhibition upregulates Bcl2 in lung cancer cells and 
tumor tissues from clinical trial patients. Combined BDA-366 and RAD001 
treatment exhibits strong synergy against lung cancer in vivo. Development of 
this Bcl2-BH4 antagonist may provide a strategy to improve lung cancer outcome.
