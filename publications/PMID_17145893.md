The CD8 coreceptor on T cells has two functions. Namely, CD8 acts to stabilize 
the binding of the T-cell receptor (TCR) to the peptide-MHC complex while 
localizing p56(lck) (lck) to the TCR/CD3 complex to facilitate early signaling 
events. Although both functions may be critical for efficient activation of a 
CTL, little is known about how the structural versus signaling roles of CD8, 
together with the relative strength of the TCR, influences T-cell function. We 
have addressed these issues by introducing full-length and truncated versions of 
the CD8alpha and CD8beta chains into CD8(-) Jurkat cell clones expressing cloned 
TCRs with known antigen specificity and relative affinities. Using a combination 
of antigen recognition and tetramer-binding assays, we find that the 
intracellular lck-binding domain of CD8 is critical for enhanced T-cell 
activation regardless of the relative strength of the TCR. In contrast, the 
extracellular domain of CD8 seems to be critical for TCRs with lower affinity 
but not those with higher affinity. Based on our results, we conclude that there 
are different requirements for CD8 to enhance T-cell function depending on the 
strength of its TCR.
