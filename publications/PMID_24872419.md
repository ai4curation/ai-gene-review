Introduction

Caspase-14 is a member of the papain-like cysteine proteases and is exclusively expressed in epidermis and its appendages ( 1 , 2 ). Recent investigations showed that null mutation of caspase-14 caused a defect of filaggrin degradation and increased trans-epidermal water loss, indicating involvement of caspase-14 in epidermal barrier function ( 3 ). However, its physiological functions are not yet fully understood.

Previously we purified an active form of caspase-14 from human corneocyte extract and determined its primary structure ( 4 ). Sequence analysis demonstrated that activation of caspase-14 would be accomplished by cleavage at Asp-146. We prepared a cleavage site-directed antibody, h14D146, which recognizes only active caspase-14 (p17/p11). Down-regulation of caspase-14, especially its active form, was evident in skin of patients with atopic dermatitis, which is characterized by impairment of the epidermal barrier function. Activation of caspase-14 occurs at the onset of corneocyte formation ( 5 ). We have shown that caspase-14 is completely different from other caspases, being regulated by kallikrein-related peptidase-7 (KLK7) and an intermediate form of caspase-14 ( 6 ). KLK7 cleaves procaspase-14 at Tyr-178, transiently generating an intermediate form (p20/p8). This form in turn has the ability to generate the mature form, p17/p11, from procaspase-14. It is not yet clear whether the intermediate form possesses other physiological functions in addition to caspase-14 processing activity.

We have also cloned a novel splicing variant of the PRSS3 gene product, mesotrypsinogen, from a keratinocyte cDNA library ( 7 ). We named this trypsinogen 5, because we found that a low level of brain-type trypsinogen 4 is expressed in human keratinocytes. These trypsinogens differ from trypsinogen 3 (mesotrypsinogen) in the N-terminal propeptide. These variants all possess an enterokinase recognition sequence, DDDDKI, and after activation, identical mesotrypsin would be produced. We also observed that expression of enterokinase was confined to the granular layer of human epidermis. Localization of mesotrypsin in the upper epidermis would be consistent with a physiological role in keratinocyte terminal differentiation, which is involved in barrier formation.

The epidermal barrier consists of various components, including natural moisturizing factor ( 8 ), extracellular lipid membranes ( 9 ), cornified envelope ( 10 ), and the keratin-filaggrin complex ( 11 ), which serves to support and maintain a flexible yet sturdy architecture. Dramatic changes occur at the transition phase from granular cells to cornified cells. Cellular organelles are digested and the cytoplasm becomes filled with keratin fibers embedded in filaggrin to form macrofibrils. Caspase-14 and mesotrypsin are activated during this transition phase.

Extracellular lipid membrane plays an essential role in permeability barrier formation ( 9 ). Lysosomal degradation of various glycosphingolipids by exohydrolases is a critical step for maturation of the lipid membrane, which consists of ceramides, free cholesterol, cholesterol sulfate, free fatty acids, and other molecules ( 12 ). During keratinocyte terminal differentiation, glycosphingolipids are synthesized and stored in lamellar bodies. They are processed by a set of lipid hydrolases into more hydrophobic moieties to form extracellular lipid membranes. Interestingly, these hydrolases require cofactors known as saposins ( 13 – 15 ). Saposins are sphingolipid activator proteins that are derived from a single precursor, prosaposin. Discovery of inherited diseases associated with saposin deficiency clearly revealed the essential role of these molecules in sphingolipid metabolism ( 16 , 17 ). Although each of the saposins is generated by limited proteolysis of prosaposin, the processing enzyme(s) in the epidermis have not yet been identified.

We have been searching for interacting molecules as well as substrates for caspase-14 using liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), which is a highly sensitive and powerful method. In the present LC/MS/MS study, we identified caspase-14 and mesotrypsin as interactors with prosaposin. Our results indicate that these proteases participate in the processing of prosaposin to generate mature saposins. We propose that caspase-14 and mesotrypsin are involved in permeability barrier formation in vivo .

DISCUSSION

We employed LC/MS/MS analysis to identify molecules interacting with caspase-14. This technique has extraordinary sensitivity, and to exclude nonspecific interactors and indirect interactors, we compared sets of affinity purified samples obtained from extracts of keratinocytes at different phases as well as cornified cell extracts with GST fusion active caspase-14 or procaspase-14. We focused on prosaposin and mesotrypsin(ogen) (PRSS3), because they were detected as caspase-14 interactors and were found only in extracts from differentiated keratinocytes and cornified cells. We hypothesized that caspase-14 and mesotrypsin are involved in prosaposin processing.

However, caspase-14, either in constitutively active form (revC14) ( 4 ) or intermediate form (revC14-Y178) ( 6 ), did not show any direct effect on saposin A generation. Instead, unexpectedly, we found that caspase-14 has the ability to convert mesotrypsinogen to mesotrypsin. This is probably accomplished via cleavage near the recognition sequence for enterokinase (DDDDKI) ( 23 ), because caspase-14 cleaves only after Asp residues. To our knowledge, this is the first observation that caspase-14 works as an activator of a protease cascade. The caspase-14 concentration used in this study was comparable with that of enterokinase. The catalytic efficiency of enterokinase is 34,000-fold greater than that of trypsin ( 24 ). Thus, even though caspase-14 was severalfold less active than enterokinase as an activator, this would not exclude a role of caspase-14 as a possible activator in vivo . However, it is not yet clear whether caspase-14 participates in mesotrypsinogen activation in vivo . In our previous study, we showed that enterokinase is expressed at the boundary area. Because mesotrypsin(ogen) is, at least in part, associated with caspase-14 as shown by LC/MS/MS analysis, and caspase-14 requires a high concentration of kosmotropic ions for its activation, enterokinase and caspase-14 may share a role, with one or the other being predominant, depending on the environment.

As far as saposin processing is concerned, it is suggested that generation of four saposins from prosaposin occurs by cleavage at Lys or Arg ( 13 ), indicating involvement of trypsin-like protease(s). Mesotrypsin would be a candidate for the maturation of saposins, including saposin A. Epidermal mesotrypsin was cloned from a keratinocyte cDNA library as a unique splicing variant ( 7 ). Expression and localization of enterokinase were confirmed at the granular layer of human epidermis, and an enterokinase cleavage fragment was co-localized at the same site ( 7 ). Interestingly, mesotrypsin is not susceptible to intrinsic trypsin inhibitors and exhibits low degradation activity toward high molecular weight proteins ( 25 ). These unique features of mesotrypsin may be consistent with a role in limited proteolysis, including protein processing.

We also tested the effect of trypsin-like serine protease KLK5, but no saposin A-related band was produced when prosaposin was incubated with KLK5 alone. Instead, KLK7 caused limited proteolysis of prosaposin, generating some intermediate bands. It is not yet clear whether KLK7 is also involved in this reaction. However, the fact that KLK7 is able to activate procaspase-14 ( 6 ) suggests that it may have a role in prosaposin processing.

Involvement of caspase-14 and mesotrypsin in prosaposin processing was further confirmed by the use of skin equivalent models with knockdown of these proteases. Although caspase-14, mesotrypsin, prosaposin, and saposin A showed broader distributions compared with normal human skin, these proteins were also present in epidermal components. Interestingly, knockdown of either caspase-14 or mesotrypsin, as well as double knockdown of these proteases, greatly diminished saposin A expression ( Fig. 4 B ). These results suggest that caspase-14 and mesotrypsin work cooperatively for the production of saposin A. Indeed, a close association between mature caspase-14, mesotrypsin, and prosaposin was also demonstrated in normal human skin by the PLA method.

Functional importance of prosaposin processing was demonstrated by studying prosaposin-deficient and saposin A-deficient mice. Oil Red staining showed that loss of prosaposin significantly reduced the lipid envelope formation in skin of prosaposin- and saposin A-deficient mice. These results suggest that impairment of prosaposin processing leads to a defect of lipid envelope formation, consequently disrupting permeability barrier function. Electron microscopic observation confirmed key roles of prosaposin and saposin A in maintaining epidermal structure. Doering et al. ( 26 ) reported the impaired ultrastructure of skin in a newborn prosaposin-deficient mouse ( 27 ). We used skin from a 1-month-old deficient mouse and observed a profound effect of prosaposin deficiency. Not only cornified cells but also granular cells exhibited abnormal structure. Keratohyaline granules were almost absent in the skin of the prosaposin-deficient mouse, and similar results were obtained for a saposin A-deficient mouse. It is not yet clear why loss of saposins affects keratohyaline granule formation, but this may further impair epidermal barrier function.

Earlier reports indicated that prosaposin processing is dependent on lysosomal hydrolysis ( 27 ). It is not known whether prosaposin processing occurs in lysosomes before secretion, or in intercellular spaces in human epidermis. Whichever is the case, a previous immunoelectron microscopy study clearly showed that caspase-14 was localized not only in cytoplasm, but also in intercellular spaces in the granular to cornified layers ( 28 ). Our study also revealed that epidermal mesotrypsin is similarly present both inside and outside the granular to cornified cell layers ( 29 ). Thus, we postulate that caspase-14 and mesotrypsin both participate in processing of prosaposin. The specific antibody to saposin A prepared in this study revealed saposin A staining at the transition phase from granular to cornified cells. This is the site of extensive hydrolytic degradation and re-organization of cellular components to form corneocytes that function as a part of the protective barrier. On the other hand, many kinds of enzymes, such as desquamation proteases (KLKs) ( 30 ), natural moisturizing factor-generating enzymes ( 31 ), and filaggrin processing proteases ( 32 ) are synthesized at this stage. Synthesis and activation of caspase-14 and mesotrypsin also occur in the same area ( 4 , 7 ). Because keratinocyte terminal differentiation is a unique process involving specialized molecules that are not found in other tissues, processing of prosaposin may also be regulated by differentiation-specific proteases.

It has been established that deficiency or dysfunction of prosaposin or saposins can result in lysosomal storage disorders that can be mimicked by deficiency of the enzyme activated by the particular saposin(s) involved ( 14 , 17 ). Total deficiency of human or mouse prosaposin results in aberrant storage of multiple glycosphingolipids in a variety of organs ( 33 ). Recent observations showed that saposin A deficiency leads to progressive encephalopathy and abnormal myelination in the cerebral white matter, as seen in Krabbe disease ( 22 ). Saposin C has particular relevance to Gaucher disease ( 34 ). On the other hand, specific deficiency of saposin D has not been reported in humans. It would be interesting to know whether tissue-specific mesotrypsin is involved in similar physiological reactions, because different levels of mesotrypsin expression are observed in different tissues ( 7 ).

In conclusion, we have uncovered a novel function of caspase-14 as an activator of mesotrypsinogen, and we have shown that epidermal mesotrypsin serves as a processing enzyme for prosaposin. Down-regulation of these proteases and dysregulation of prosaposin activation would result in impaired permeability barrier function. We believe these findings contribute to our understanding of keratinocyte biology, especially in relationship to diseases associated with aberrant barrier function, including atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.
