Tat is a critical viral transactivator essential for human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) gene expression. Activation involves binding to an RNA stem-loop 
structure and recruitment of the positive transcription elongation factor b. Tat 
also induces the remodeling of a single nucleosome in the HIV promoter. However, 
the mechanism of this remodeling has remained unclear. Knockdown of INI-1 and 
BRG-1, two components of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, suppressed 
Tat-mediated transactivation. Cells lacking INI-1 (G401 and MON) or BRG-1 (C33A) 
exhibited defective transactivation by Tat that was restored upon INI-1 and 
BRG-1 expression, respectively. Tat was co-immunoprecipitated with several 
SWI/SNF subunits, including INI-1, BRG-1, and beta-actin. The SWI/SNF complex 
interacted with the integrated HIV promoter in a Tat-dependent manner. We also 
found that INI-1 and BRG-1 synergized with the p300 acetyltransferase to 
activate the HIV promoter. This synergism depended on the acetyltransferase 
activity of p300 and on Tat Lys(50) and Lys(51). In conclusion, Tat-mediated 
activation of the HIV promoter requires the SWI/SNF complex in synergy with the 
coactivator p300.
