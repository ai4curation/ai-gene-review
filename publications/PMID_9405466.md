The sarcoglycans are transmembrane components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein 
complex, which links the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix in adult 
muscle fibers. Mutations in all four known sarcoglycan genes (alpha, beta, 
gamma, and delta) have been found in humans with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. 
We have identified a novel protein, epsilon-sarcoglycan, that shares 44% amino 
acid identity with alpha-sarcoglycan (adhalin). We show that epsilon-sarcoglycan 
is a membrane-associated glycoprotein and document its expression by Northern 
blotting, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. In contrast to alpha-delta 
sarcoglycans, which are expressed predominantly or exclusively in striated 
muscle, epsilon-sarcoglycan is broadly distributed in muscle and nonmuscle cells 
of both embryos and adults. These results raise the possibility that 
sarcoglycan-containing complexes mediate membrane-matrix interactions in many 
cell types.
