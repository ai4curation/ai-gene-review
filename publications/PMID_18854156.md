Regulation of DNA replication and segregation is essential for all cells. 
Orthologs of the plasmid partitioning genes parA, parB, and parS are present in 
bacterial genomes throughout the prokaryotic evolutionary tree and are required 
for accurate chromosome segregation. However, the mechanism(s) by which parABS 
genes ensure proper DNA segregation have remained unclear. Here we report that 
the ParA ortholog in B. subtilis (Soj) controls the activity of the DNA 
replication initiator protein DnaA. Subcellular localization of several Soj 
mutants indicates that Soj acts as a spatially regulated molecular switch, 
capable of either inhibiting or activating DnaA. We show that the classical 
effect of Soj inhibiting sporulation is an indirect consequence of its action on 
DnaA through activation of the Sda DNA replication checkpoint. These results 
suggest that the pleiotropy manifested by chromosomal parABS mutations could be 
the indirect effects of a primary activity regulating DNA replication 
initiation.
