Although many functions and targets have been attributed to the histone and 
protein deacetylase SIRT1, a comprehensive analysis of SIRT1 binding proteins 
yielding a high-confidence interaction map has not been established. Using a 
comparative statistical analysis of binding partners, we have assembled a 
high-confidence SIRT1 interactome. Employing this method, we identified the 
deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22), a component of 
the deubiquitinating module (DUBm) of the SAGA transcriptional coactivating 
complex, as a SIRT1-interacting partner. We found that this interaction is 
highly specific, requires the ZnF-UBP domain of USP22, and is disrupted by the 
inactivating H363Y mutation within SIRT1. Moreover, we show that USP22 is 
acetylated on multiple lysine residues and that alteration of a single lysine 
(K129) within the ZnF-UBP domain is sufficient to alter interaction of the DUBm 
with the core SAGA complex. Furthermore, USP22-mediated recruitment of SIRT1 
activity promotes the deacetylation of individual SAGA complex components. Our 
results indicate an important role of SIRT1-mediated deacetylation in regulating 
the formation of DUBm subcomplexes within the larger SAGA complex.
