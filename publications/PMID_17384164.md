Circadian clocks are required to coordinate metabolism and physiology with daily 
changes in the environment. Such clocks have several distinctive features, 
including a free-running rhythm of approximately 24 h and the ability to entrain 
to both light or temperature cycles (zeitgebers). We have previously 
characterized the EARLY FLOWERING4 (ELF4) locus of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis 
thaliana) as being important for robust rhythms. Here, it is shown that ELF4 is 
necessary for at least two core clock functions: entrainment to an environmental 
cycle and rhythm sustainability under constant conditions. We show that elf4 
demonstrates clock input defects in light responsiveness and in circadian 
gating. Rhythmicity in elf4 could be driven by an environmental cycle, but an 
increased sensitivity to light means the circadian system of elf4 plants does 
not entrain normally. Expression of putative core clock genes and outputs were 
characterized in various ELF4 backgrounds to establish the molecular network of 
action. ELF4 was found to be intimately associated with the CIRCADIAN 
CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1)/LONG ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY)-TIMING OF CAB 
EXPRESSION1 (TOC1) feedback loop because, under free run, ELF4 is required to 
regulate the expression of CCA1 and TOC1 and, further, elf4 is locked in the 
evening phase of this feedback loop. ELF4, therefore, can be considered a 
component of the central CCA1/LHY-TOC1 feedback loop in the plant circadian 
clock.
