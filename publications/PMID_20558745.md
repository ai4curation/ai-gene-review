HCT-8 colon cancer cells secreted heat shock protein 90alpha (HSP90alpha) and 
had increased invasiveness upon serum starvation. The concentrated conditioned 
medium of serum-starved HCT-8 cells was able to stimulate the migration and 
invasion of non-serum-starved cells, which could be prevented by treatment with 
an anti-HSP90alpha antibody. Recombinant HSP90alpha (rHSP90alpha) also enhanced 
HCT-8 cell migration and invasion, suggesting a stimulatory role of secreted 
HSP90alpha in cancer malignancy. HSP90alpha binding to CD91alpha and Neu was 
evidenced by the proximity ligation assay, and rHSP90alpha-induced HCT-8 cell 
invasion could be suppressed by the addition of anti-CD91alpha or anti-Neu 
antibodies. Via CD91alpha and Neu, rHSP90alpha selectively induced integrin 
alpha(V) expression, and knockdown of integrin alpha(V) efficiently blocked 
rHSP90alpha-induced HCT-8 cell invasion. rHSP90alpha induced the activities of 
ERK, PI3K/Akt, and NF-kappaB p65, but only NF-kappaB activation was involved in 
HSP90alpha-induced integrin alpha(V) expression. Additionally, we investigated 
the serum levels of HSP90alpha and the expression status of tumor integrin 
alpha(V) mRNA in colorectal cancer patients. Serum HSP90alpha levels of 
colorectal cancer patients were significantly higher than those of normal 
volunteers (p < 0.001). Patients with higher serum HSP90alpha levels 
significantly exhibited elevated levels of integrin alpha(V) mRNA in tumor 
tissues as compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues (p < 0.001). Furthermore, 
tumor integrin alpha(V) overexpression was significantly correlated with TNM 
(Tumor, Node, Metastasis) staging (p = 0.001).

The concentrated conditioned medium of serum-starved HCT-8 cells was able to stimulate the migration and invasion of non-serum-starved cells, which could be prevented by treatment with an anti-HSP90α antibody.

HSP90α binding to CD91α and Neu was evidenced by the proximity ligation assay, and rHSP90α-induced HCT-8 cell invasion could be suppressed by the addition of anti-CD91α or anti-Neu antibodies. Via CD91α and Neu, rHSP90α selectively induced integrin α V expression, and knockdown of integrin α V efficiently blocked rHSP90α-induced HCT-8 cell invasion. rHSP90α induced the activities of ERK, PI3K/Akt, and NF-κB p65, but only NF-κB activation was involved in HSP90α-induced integrin α V expression. Additionally, we investigated the serum levels of HSP90α and the expression status of tumor integrin α V mRNA in colorectal cancer patients. Serum HSP90α levels of colorectal cancer patients were significantly higher than those of normal volunteers ( p < 0.001). Patients with higher serum HSP90α levels significantly exhibited elevated levels of integrin α V mRNA in tumor tissues as compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues ( p < 0.001).

Introduction

Heat shock protein 90α (HSP90α) 2 is a molecular chaperone that aids in proper protein folding, maturation, and intracellular trafficking of numerous proteins ( 1 ). Thus far, more than 100 proteins have been identified that are regulated by HSP90α, including Akt, Neu/Her-2 (ErbB2), HIF-1α, Bcr-Abl, Raf-1, and mutated p53 ( 2 ). Many of these proteins are important mediators of signal transduction and cell cycle control and are also involved in the development and progression of cancer cells. Increasing evidence has suggested HSP90α as a novel therapeutic target. By inhibiting its chaperone activity, many HSP90α inhibitors cause the destabilization and eventual degradation of client proteins, and therefore, exhibit potent in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer activities ( 3 ). Among them, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin is a first-in-class HSP90α inhibitor and is currently in phase II clinical trials. Nevertheless, most studies regarding HSP90α have focused on its function as a cytosolic chaperone; the secretion of HSP90α has been less well studied until recently.

HSP90α is not only expressed in the cytoplasm, but it is also localized on the cell surface ( 4 – 6 ). Through an interaction with the extracellular domain of Neu/Her-2, surface HSP90 is involved in heregulin-induced Neu/Her-2 activation and signaling, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangements and migration and invasion of breast cancer cells ( 7 ). Recent studies have shown that HSP90 could be secreted by keratinocytes, non-small cell lung cancer CL1–5 cells, and breast cancer MCF-7 cells ( 8 – 12 ). During skin wound healing, transforming growth factor-α induced keratinocytes to secrete HSP90α via an unconventional exosome pathway ( 9 , 11 ). Secreted HSP90α promoted both epidermal and dermal cell migration through their surface receptor CD91/LRP-1 ( 11 ). In a human cancer study, an elevated level of secreted HSP90α was detected from highly invasive CL1–5 cells as compared with their less invasive parental cells ( 10 ). Additionally, secretion of HSP90α was significantly induced from MCF-7 cells after stimulation with a variety of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( 12 ).

In our present study, human colon cancer HCT-8 cells secreted HSP90α and increased cell invasiveness after serum starvation. Via CD91/LRP-1 and Neu, HSP90α selectively induced integrin α V expression, and shRNA-mediated knockdown of integrin α V efficiently blocked HSP90α-induced HCT-8 cell invasion. HSP90α induced activation of ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and NF-κB p65 in HCT-8 cells, but only NF-κB activation was involved in HSP90α-induced integrin α V expression. In addition, we investigated the serum levels of HSP90α from 172 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and the expression status of tumor integrin α V mRNA from 118 patients and analyzed their clinical relevance.

DISCUSSION

Human colon cancer HCT-8 cells secreted HSP90α and increased cell invasiveness in response to serum starvation stress. Our study further demonstrated that secreted HSP90α was an inducer of cancer cell migration and invasion. When a solid tumor grows beyond 2 mm in diameter, simple diffusion of nutrients and oxygen to metabolizing tissues is obviously insufficient so as that nutrient deficiency and hypoxia occur in multiple areas of tumor tissue. Many factors are produced within these areas to enhance angiogenesis or tumor cell spreading. Our data suggest that HSP90α could be one of these factors. Therefore, we analyzed serum levels of HSP90α from 10 normal volunteers and 172 CRC patients. Serum HSP90α levels of CRC patients were significantly higher than those of normal volunteers ( p < 0.001). Furthermore, high stage (TNM III + IV) patients had higher HSP90α amounts in serum as compared with low stage (TNM I + II) patients, but the difference did not reach a statistically significant level. These results suggest that elevated HSP90α secretion occurs and affects CRC progression from earlier stages. Serum levels of HSP90α could potentially be used as an adjuvant diagnostic marker for colorectal neoplasia.

HSP90 is a molecular chaperone that facilitates proper folding and intracellular trafficking of numerous client proteins ( 1 ). Recent studies have shown that HSP90 is not only expressed in the cytoplasm and cell surface, but it can also be secreted by keratinocytes and cancer cells ( 8 – 12 ). Because of the lack of N-terminal signaling sequence, its secretion has been thought to be via an unconventional manner. Some reports have revealed that HSP90α can be exported from cells by exocytosis via nano-vesicles at the plasma membrane called exosomes ( 8 , 14 – 16 ). Additionally, phosphorylation of Thr-90 residue and interaction of the last four residues with protein phosphatase 5 have been thought to regulate HSP90α secretion ( 12 ). The mechanism of HSP90α secretion after serum starvation remains to be investigated.

It has been reported that cell surface HSP90α has a stimulatory role in cancer cell migration and invasion ( 2 ), which is at least partly attributed to the interaction between HSP90α and Neu ( 7 ). In our experiments, secreted or ectopic HSP90α enhanced HCT-8 cell migration and invasion via a physical interaction with cell surface CD91 rather than Neu, and the induced migration and invasion could be drastically abolished by treatment with anti-CD91 antibody. Indeed, CD91 has been known as a common receptor for HSP90, HSP70, GP96, and calreticulin ( 17 ). The involvement of secreted HSP90α in cell migration and invasion through CD91 has also been demonstrated in skin cells during wound healing ( 9 , 11 ). In addition, the Toll-like receptor TLR-4 serves as a HSP90 receptor in antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells in response to bacterial infection ( 18 ), and annexin II is another cell surface HSP90α-binding protein in endothelial cells ( 19 ). In our study, the anti-Neu antibody could prevent to some extent HCT-8 cell migration and invasion induced by secreted HSP90α, revealing that Neu participates in the function of secreted HSP90α. It remains to be studied whether TLR-4 and annexin II are also involved in HSP90α-induced cancer cell migration and invasion.

CD91 is a cell membrane protein with multiple functions ( 13 ). It is involved in cell endocytosis. It also functions as a receptor for α 2 -macroglobulin, transforming growth factor-β, and a variety of other ligands. CD91 has been shown to interact with many other cell membrane-associated proteins such as integrins. Integrins are a family of cell membrane receptors composed of non-covalently bound α and β subunits ( 20 ). Once bound by ligands or cellular counterreceptors, integrins gather many other proteins to form a focal adhesion complex. Some known signaling pathways and some undiscovered signaling pathways are thus triggered to regulate cell survival, proliferation, cell shape changes, adhesion, migration, and invasion. Our data have demonstrated that integrin α V expression was selectively induced by secreted HSP90α and that HSP90α-induced cell invasion could be drastically prevented by shRNA-mediated specific knockdown of integrin α V . The association of integrin α V with CRC malignancy was further confirmed by data from our clinical investigation, which demonstrated that tumor integrin α V mRNA overexpression was significantly correlated with the TNM staging of cancer patients. In the literature, integrin α V seems to be particularly important in angiogenesis ( 21 ). The integrin α V β 3 heterodimer was overexpressed in the vasculature of colon carcinomas and served as marker of tumor-associated blood vessels ( 22 ). It is still unclear which β integrin can dimerize with α V to contribute to HSP90α-induced cancer cell invasion.

Antibodies against CD91 and Neu exhibited different efficacies in preventing HSP90α-induced integrin α V expression, suggesting that CD91 and Neu were differentially involved in integrin α V induction. Additionally, we also investigated the signaling pathway responsible for HSP90α-induced integrin α V expression. Although rHSP90α induced the activities of ERK, PI3K/Akt, and NF-κB p65, rHSP90α-induced integrin α V expression was suppressed only by the inhibitor of NF-κB p65 activation. Taking these results together, we conclude that secreted HSP90α can stimulate HCT-8 cell invasion by inducing integrin α V expression via a CD91- and NF-κB-dependent pathway. Activation of the NF-κB pathway as a downstream event of CD91 has also been revealed in GP96-treated plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( 23 ). However, the detailed mechanism regarding NF-κB activation by CD91 still needs to be explored.
