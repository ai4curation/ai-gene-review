Recent evidence suggesting a strong interplay between components of the 
renin-angiotensin system and key mediators of fibrosis led us to hypothesize 
that renin, independent of its enzymatic action to enhance angiotensin (Ang) II 
synthesis, directly increases production of the fibrogenic cytokine transforming 
growth factor (TGF)-beta. Human or rat mesangial cells (MCs) were treated with 
human recombinant renin (HrRenin) or rat recombinant renin (RrRenin) and the 
effects on TGF-beta1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-type 1 (PAI-1), 
fibronectin (FN) and collagen 1 mRNA and protein were investigated. Blockade of 
the rat MC renin receptor was achieved using siRNA. HrRenin or RrRenin, at doses 
shown to be physiologically relevant, induced marked dose- and time-dependent 
increases in TGF-beta1. These effects were not altered by adding an inhibitor of 
renin's enzymatic action (RO 42-5892), the Ang II receptor antagonist losartan 
or the Ang-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. RrRenin also induced PAI-1, FN 
and collagen 1 mRNA and PAI-1 and FN protein in a dose-dependent manner. 
Neutralizing antibodies to TGF-beta partially blocked these effects. Supernatant 
and cell lysate Ang I and Ang II levels were extremely low. MC angiotensinogen 
mRNA was undetectable both with and without added renin. Targeting of the rat 
renin receptor mRNA with siRNA blocked induction of TGF-beta1. We conclude that 
renin upregulates MC TGF-beta1 through a receptor-mediated mechanism, 
independent of Ang II generation or action. Renin-induced increases in TGF-beta1 
in turn stimulate increases in PAI-1, FN and collagen I. Thus, renin may 
contribute to renal fibrotic disease, particularly when therapeutic Ang II 
blockade elevates plasma renin.
