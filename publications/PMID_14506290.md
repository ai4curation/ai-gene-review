This report describes an unbiased method for systematically determining gene 
function in mammalian cells. A total of 20,704 predicted human full-length cDNAs 
were tested for induction of the IL-8 promoter. A number of genes, including 
those for cytokines, receptors, adapters, kinases, and transcription factors, 
were identified that induced the IL-8 promoter through known regulatory sites. 
Proteins that acted through a cooperative interaction between an AP-1 and an 
unrecognized cAMP response element (CRE)-like site were also identified. A 
protein, termed transducer of regulated cAMP response element-binding protein 
(CREB) (TORC1), was identified that activated expression through the variant CRE 
and consensus CRE sites. TORC1 potently induced known CREB1 target genes, bound 
CREB1, and activated expression through a potent transcription activation 
domain. A functional Drosophila TORC gene was also identified. Thus, TORCs 
represent a family of highly conserved CREB coactivators that may control the 
potency and specificity of CRE-mediated responses.
