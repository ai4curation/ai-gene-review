Phemx (Pan hematopoietic expression) is a novel murine gene expressed in 
developmentally regulated sites of hematopoiesis from early in embryogenesis 
through adulthood. Phemx is expressed in hematopoietic progenitors and mature 
cells of the three main hematopoietic lineages. Conceptual translation of the 
murine Phemx cDNA predicts a 25-kDa polypeptide with four hydrophobic regions 
and several potential phosphorylation sites, suggestive of a transmembrane 
protein involved in cell signaling. The PHEMX protein is structurally similar to 
tetraspanin CD81 (TAPA-1), a transmembrane protein involved in leukocyte 
activation, adhesion, and proliferation. Phemx maps to the distal region of 
chromosome 7, a segment of the mouse genome that contains a cluster of genes 
that exhibit genomic imprinting. However, imprinting analysis of Phemx at the 
whole organ level shows that it is biallelically expressed, suggesting that 
mechanisms leading to monoallelic expression are not imposed at this locus. The 
human PHEMX ortholog is specifically expressed in hematopoietic organs and 
tissues and, in contrast to murine Phemx, undergoes alternative splicing. The 
unique mode and range of Phemx expression suggest that it plays a role in 
hematopoietic cell function.
