We report the characterisation of a human gene, designated MCG18 (multiple 
endocrine neoplasia type 1 candidate gene 18), that encodes a new member of the 
DnaJ family of proteins. Database searches indicate that MCG18 also has the 
locus name HSPF2. MCG18 lies 250bp centromeric of the VRF/VEGFB gene on 
chromosome 11q13. The MCG18 cDNA is predicted to encode a 241 amino acid product 
that has partial homology to Escherichia coli dnaJ in that it contains the J 
domain. However, MCG18 has greatest similarity to a functionally undefined 
protein from Caenorhabditis elegans, both of which are predicted to have a 
membrane-spanning region adjacent to their J domains. The cDNA encoding the 
murine homolog (Mcg18) was also cloned and sequenced, and the encoded protein 
shares 81% similarity to MCG18. The coding region of MCG18 is interrupted by 4 
introns and the mRNA is expressed as a 1.4kb message in all tissues examined, 
including those derived from the breast, ovary, bladder, lung and keratinocytes.
