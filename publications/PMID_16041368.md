Centrosome duplication is tightly controlled during faithful cell division, and 
unnecessary reduplication can lead to supernumerary centrosomes and multipolar 
spindles that are associated with most human cancer cells. In addition to 
nucleocytoplasmic transport, the Ran-Crm1 network is involved in regulating 
centrosome duplication to ensure the formation of a bipolar spindle. Here, we 
discover that nucleophosmin (NPM) may be a Ran-Crm1 substrate that controls 
centrosome duplication. NPM contains a functional nuclear export signal (NES) 
that is responsible for both its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and its association 
with centrosomes, which are Ran-Crm1-dependent as they are sensitive to 
Crm1-specific nuclear export inhibition, either by leptomycin B (LMB) or by the 
expression of a Ran-binding protein, RanBP1. Notably, LMB treatment induces 
premature centrosome duplication in quiescent cells, which coincides with NPM 
dissociation from centrosomes. Moreover, deficiency of NPM by RNA interference 
results in supernumerary centrosomes, which can be reversed by reintroducing 
wild-type but not NES-mutated NPM. Mutation of a potential proline-dependent 
kinase phosphorylation site at residue 95, from threonine to aspartic acid 
(T95D) within the NES motif, abolishes NPM association and inhibition of 
centrosome duplication. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the 
Ran-Crm1 complex may promote a local enrichment of NPM on centrosomes, thereby 
preventing centrosome reduplication.
