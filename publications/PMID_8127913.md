gene products isolated from yeast.

A complex containing the products of the SWI1/ADR6, SWI2/SNF2, SWI3, SNF5, and 
SNF6 genes and four additional polypeptides has been purified from extracts of 
the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Physical association of these proteins was 
demonstrated by copurification and coimmunoprecipitation. A potent DNA-dependent 
ATPase copurified with the complex, and this activity was evidently associated 
with SWI2/SNF2.
