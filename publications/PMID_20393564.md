The four receptors of the Notch family are widely expressed transmembrane 
proteins that function as key conduits through which mammalian cells communicate 
to regulate cell fate and growth. Ligand binding triggers a conformational 
change in the receptor negative regulatory region (NRR) that enables ADAM 
protease cleavage at a juxtamembrane site that otherwise lies buried within the 
quiescent NRR. Subsequent intramembrane proteolysis catalysed by the 
gamma-secretase complex liberates the intracellular domain (ICD) to initiate the 
downstream Notch transcriptional program. Aberrant signalling through each 
receptor has been linked to numerous diseases, particularly cancer, making the 
Notch pathway a compelling target for new drugs. Although gamma-secretase 
inhibitors (GSIs) have progressed into the clinic, GSIs fail to distinguish 
individual Notch receptors, inhibit other signalling pathways and cause 
intestinal toxicity, attributed to dual inhibition of Notch1 and 2 (ref. 11). To 
elucidate the discrete functions of Notch1 and Notch2 and develop clinically 
relevant inhibitors that reduce intestinal toxicity, we used phage display 
technology to generate highly specialized antibodies that specifically 
antagonize each receptor paralogue and yet cross-react with the human and mouse 
sequences, enabling the discrimination of Notch1 versus Notch2 function in human 
patients and rodent models. Our co-crystal structure shows that the inhibitory 
mechanism relies on stabilizing NRR quiescence. Selective blocking of Notch1 
inhibits tumour growth in pre-clinical models through two mechanisms: inhibition 
of cancer cell growth and deregulation of angiogenesis. Whereas inhibition of 
Notch1 plus Notch2 causes severe intestinal toxicity, inhibition of either 
receptor alone reduces or avoids this effect, demonstrating a clear advantage 
over pan-Notch inhibitors. Our studies emphasize the value of paralogue-specific 
antagonists in dissecting the contributions of distinct Notch receptors to 
differentiation and disease and reveal the therapeutic promise in targeting 
Notch1 and Notch2 independently.
