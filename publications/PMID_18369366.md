The E3 ubiquitin ligase synoviolin (SYVN1) functions as an anti-apoptotic factor 
that is responsible for the outgrowth of synovial cells during the development 
of rheumatoid arthritis. The molecular mechanisms underlying SYVN1 regulation of 
cell death are largely unknown. Here, we report that elevated SYVN1 expression 
correlates with decreased levels of the protein inositol-requiring enzyme 1 
(IRE1)-a pro-apoptotic factor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-induced 
apoptosis pathway-in synovial fibroblasts from mice with collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA). SYVN1 interacts with and catalyses IRE1 ubiquitination and 
consequently promotes IRE1 degradation. Suppression of SYVN1 expression in 
synovial fibroblasts from CIA mice restores IRE1 protein expression and reverses 
the resistance of ER-stress-induced apoptosis of CIA synovial fibroblasts. These 
results show that SYVN1 causes the overgrowth of synovial cells by degrading 
IRE1, and therefore antagonizes ER-stress-induced cell death.
