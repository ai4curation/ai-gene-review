The prometastatic protein NEDD9 (neural precursor cell expressed, 
developmentally downregulated 9) is highly expressed in many cancers and is 
required for mesenchymal individual cell migration and progression to the 
invasive stage. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of NEDD9-driven migration 
and the downstream targets effecting metastasis are not well defined. In the 
current study, knockdown of NEDD9 in highly metastatic tumor cells drastically 
reduces their migratory capacity due to disruption of actin dynamics at the 
leading edge. Specifically, NEDD9 deficiency leads to a decrease in the 
persistence and stability of lamellipodial protrusions similar to knockdown of 
cortactin (CTTN). Mechanistically, it was shown that NEDD9 binds to and 
regulates acetylation of CTTN in an Aurora A kinase (AURKA)/HDAC6-dependent 
manner. The knockdown of NEDD9 or AURKA results in an increase in the amount of 
acetylated CTTN and a decrease in the binding of CTTN to F-actin. Overexpression 
of the deacetylation mimicking (9KR) mutant of CTTN is sufficient to restore 
actin dynamics at the leading edge and migration proficiency of the tumor cells. 
Inhibition of AURKA and HDAC6 activity by alisertib and Tubastatin A in 
xenograft models of breast cancer leads to a decrease in the number of pulmonary 
metastases. Collectively, these findings identify CTTN as the key downstream 
component of NEDD9-driven migration and metastatic phenotypes.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides a mechanistic platform for therapeutic 
interventions based on AURKA and HDAC6 inhibition for patients with metastatic 
breast cancer to prevent and/or eradicate metastases.
