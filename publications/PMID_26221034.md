Recruitment of circulating monocytes and neutrophils to infection sites is 
essential for host defense against infections. Here, we identified a previously 
unannotated gene that encodes an immunoglobulin-like receptor, designated 
CD300H, which is located in the CD300 gene cluster. CD300H has a short 
cytoplasmic tail and associates with the signaling adaptor proteins, DAP12 and 
DAP10. CD300H is expressed on CD16(+) monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells. 
Ligation of CD300H on CD16(+) monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells with 
anti-CD300H monoclonal antibody induced the production of neutrophil 
chemoattractants. Interestingly, CD300H expression varied among healthy 
subjects, who could be classified into two groups according to "positive" and 
"negative" expression. Genomic sequence analysis revealed a single-nucleotide 
substitution (rs905709 (G → A)) at a splice donor site on intron 1 on either one 
or both alleles. The International HapMap Project database has demonstrated that 
homozygosity for the A allele of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs905709 
("negative" expression) is highly frequent in Han Chinese in Beijing, Japanese 
in Tokyo, and Europeans (A/A genotype frequencies 0.349, 0.167, and 0.138, 
respectively) but extremely rare in Sub-Saharan African populations. Together, 
these results suggest that CD300H may play an important role in innate immunity, 
at least in populations that carry the G/G or G/A genotype of CD300H.
