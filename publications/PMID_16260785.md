Cellular ion homeostasis involves communication between the cytosol and the 
luminal compartment of organelles. This is particularly critical for metal ions 
because of their toxic potential. We have identified the yeast homologue of the 
prokaryotic ArsA protein, the homodimeric ATPase Arr4p, as a protein that binds 
to the yeast intracellular CLC chloride-transport protein, Gef1p. We show that 
binding of Arr4p to the C terminus of Gef1p requires the presence of yeast 
cytosol and is sensitive to a highly specific copper chelator in vitro and in 
vivo. Copper alone can substitute for cytosol to support the interaction of 
Arr4p with the C terminus of Gef1p. The migration behavior of Arr4p in 
nonreducing gel electrophoresis correlates with cellular copper deficiency, 
repletion, or stress. Our homology model of Arr4p shows that the antimony 
(arsenic) metal binding site of ArsA is not conserved in Arr4p. The model 
suggests that a pair of cysteines, Cys285 and Cys288, is located in the 
interface of the Arr4p dimer. These residues are required for Arr4p 
homodimerization and for binding to the C terminus of Gef1p. Whereas both 
proteins are required for normal growth under iron-limiting conditions, they 
play opposite roles when copper and heat stress are combined in an alkaline 
environment. Under these conditions, deltagef1 cells grow much better than wild 
type yeast, whereas deltaarr4 cells are unable to grow. Comparison of the 
deltaarr4 with the deltaarr4deltagef1 strain suggests that Arr4p antagonizes the 
function of Gef1p.
