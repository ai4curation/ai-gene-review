Thyroglobulin (TG) is the major soluble protein of the thyroid and is known to 
be extracellularly stored for future liberation of thyroid hormones. We have 
developed techniques for the isolation of an insoluble storage form of human TG 
present in the follicle lumen. The application of these techniques yielded 
insoluble and translucent colloid globules varying in size (50-500 microns) and 
shape and consisting primarily of densely packed TG. Intact colloid globules 
exhibited the imprints of the apical cell surfaces of thyrocytes that had 
surrounded the colloid globules in situ. Hence, in size and surface morphology, 
isolated colloid globules represent authentic lumenal content. Based on the 
total protein of single colloid globules and their volume, an average protein 
concentration of 590 mg/mL was calculated. The presence of protein disulfide 
isomerase in colloid globules and in the secretory product of cultured 
thyrocytes suggests its involvement in the extracellular multimerization of 
human TG. Native colloid globules increased their volume considerably upon 
reduction of disulfide bonds; they were completely dissolved by treatment with 
dithiothreitol and SDS. The results show that part of extracellular human TG 
undergoes multimerization, primarily by the formation of intermolecular 
disulfide bonds, thus allowing the storage of TG at excessively high, previously 
unknown, concentrations.
