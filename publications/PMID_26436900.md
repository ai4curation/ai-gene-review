Speech and vocal impairments characterize many neurological disorders. However, 
the neurogenetic mechanisms of these disorders are not well understood, and 
current animal models do not have the necessary circuitry to recapitulate vocal 
learning deficits. We developed germline transgenic songbirds, zebra finches 
(Taneiopygia guttata) expressing human mutant huntingtin (mHTT), a protein 
responsible for the progressive deterioration of motor and cognitive function in 
Huntington's disease (HD). Although generally healthy, the mutant songbirds had 
severe vocal disorders, including poor vocal imitation, stuttering, and 
progressive syntax and syllable degradation. Their song abnormalities were 
associated with HD-related neuropathology and dysfunction of the cortical-basal 
ganglia (CBG) song circuit. These transgenics are, to the best of our knowledge, 
the first experimentally created, functional mutant songbirds. Their progressive 
and quantifiable vocal disorder, combined with circuit dysfunction in the CBG 
song system, offers a model for genetic manipulation and the development of 
therapeutic strategies for CBG-related vocal and motor disorders.
