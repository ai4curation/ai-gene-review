Scaffold proteins play a major role in regulating MAP kinase pathways. In yeast, 
the Mpk1p-MAP kinase pathway functions to maintain the integrity of the 
cytoskeleton and the cell wall. In this module, the MEKK Bck1p functions 
upstream of the MEKs Mkk1p and Mkk2p, which in turn activate the MAP kinase 
Mpk1p. Mpk1p regulates several nuclear targets, including the transcription 
factors Rlm1p and SBF, and the two HMG1-like proteins NHP6A and NHP6B. Here we 
show that Mpk1p constitutively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, 
and both Mpk1p and Mkk1p localize to sites of polarized growth in a 
Spa2p-dependent manner. Spa2p belongs to a group of proteins that includes 
Bni1p, Bud6p, and Pea2p, which are involved in the dynamic organization of the 
actin cytoskeleton during polarized growth. FRAP analysis shows that Spa2p-GFP 
is stably anchored at bud tips, whereas Mpk1p binds transiently. Spa2p interacts 
with Mkk1p and Mpk1p, and membrane bound Spa2p is sufficient to recruit Mkk1p 
and Mpk1p but not other MAP kinases to the cell cortex. Taken together, these 
results suggest that Spa2p functions as a scaffold-like protein for the cell 
wall integrity pathway during polarized growth.
