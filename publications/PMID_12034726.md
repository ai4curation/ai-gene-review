The neuronal ELAV-like RNA-binding protein HuD binds to a regulatory element in 
the 3'-untranslated region of the growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) mRNA. 
Here we report that overexpression of HuD protein in PC12 cells stabilizes the 
GAP-43 mRNA by delaying the onset of mRNA degradation and that this process 
depends on the size of the poly(A) tail. Using a polysome-based in vitro mRNA 
decay assay, we found that addition of recombinant HuD protein to the system 
increased the half-life of full-length, capped, and polyadenylated GAP-43 mRNA 
and that this effect was caused in part by a decrease in the rate of 
deadenylation of the mRNA. This stabilization was specific for GAP-43 mRNA 
containing the HuD binding element in the 3'-untranslated region and a poly(A) 
tail of at least 150 A nucleotides. In correlation with the effect of HuD on 
GAP-43 mRNA stability, we found that HuD binds GAP-43 mRNAs with long tails 
(A150) with 10-fold higher affinity than to those with short tails (A30). We 
conclude that HuD stabilizes the GAP-43 mRNA through a mechanism that is 
dependent on the length of the poly(A) tail and involves changes in its affinity 
for the mRNA.
