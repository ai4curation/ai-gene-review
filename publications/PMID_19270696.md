Beclin 1, a protein essential for autophagy, binds to hVps34/Class III 
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and UVRAG. Here, we have identified two Beclin 1 
associated proteins, Atg14L and Rubicon. Atg14L and UVRAG bind to Beclin 1 in a 
mutually exclusive manner, whereas Rubicon binds only to a subpopulation of 
UVRAG complexes; thus, three different Beclin 1 complexes exist. GFP-Atg14L 
localized to the isolation membrane and autophagosome, as well as to the ER and 
unknown puncta. Knockout of Atg14L in mouse ES cells caused a defect in 
autophagosome formation. GFP-Rubicon was localized at the endosome/lysosome. 
Knockdown of Rubicon caused enhancement of autophagy, especially at the 
maturation step, as well as enhancement of endocytic trafficking. These data 
suggest that the Beclin 1-hVps34 complex functions in two different steps of 
autophagy by altering the subunit composition.
