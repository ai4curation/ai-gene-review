Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression is associated with 
resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It modulates DNA repair after 
radiation-induced damage through association with the catalytic subunit of DNA 
protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). We investigated the role of EGFR nuclear import and 
its association with DNA-PKcs on DNA repair after exposure to cisplatin or 
ionizing radiation (IR). The model system was based on EGFR-null murine NIH3T3 
fibroblasts in which EGFR expression was restored with isoforms that were 
wild-type (wt), derived from human cancers (L858R, EGFRvIII), or mutated in the 
nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence. In cells expressing wtEGFR or 
EGFRvIII, there was complete unhooking of cisplatin-induced interstrand 
cross-links and repair of IR-induced strand breaks. In contrast, cells 
expressing L858R or NLS mutations showed reduced unhooking of interstrand 
cross-links and repair of strand breaks. Immunoprecipitation showed wtEGFR and 
EGFRvIII binding to DNA-PKcs, increasing 2-fold 18 hours after cisplatin 
therapy. Confocal microscopy and proximity ligation assay showed that this 
interaction in the cytoplasm and nucleus was associated with increased DNA 
protein kinase complex (DNA-PK) activity. Cells expressing the EGFR L858R 
mutation, which has constitutive kinase activity, exhibited reduced DNA repair 
without nuclear localization. EGFR-NLS mutants showed impaired nuclear 
localization and DNA-PKcs association with reduced DNA repair and DNA-PK kinase 
activity. In summary, EGFR nuclear localization was required for modulation of 
cisplatin and IR-induced repair of DNA damage. EGFR-DNA-PKcs binding was induced 
by cisplatin or IR but not by EGFR nuclear translocation per se. Our findings 
show that EGFR subcellular distribution can modulate DNA repair kinetics, with 
implications for design of EGFR-targeted combinational therapies.

INTRODUCTION

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) promotes the activation of survival signalling pathways including RAS/MAPK, PI3/AKT, JAK/STAT ( 1 , 2 ). Increased EGFR activation and overexpression is strongly associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression ( 3 ). EGFR is an important target for cancer therapies including antibodies disrupting ligand/receptor interactions such as cetuximab ( 4 , 5 ), and small molecules inhibiting EGFR kinase activity including gefitinib ( 6 , 7 ) and erlotinib ( 8 ). There has been extensive investigation of the mechanisms by which EGFR inhibition modulates the activity of chemotherapy and radiation ( 3 ). Combinations of the monoclonal antibody cetuximab with cisplatin or radiation have been useful clinically in the treatment of head and neck and colon cancer ( 9 , 10 ). In contrast, despite effects in vitro ( 11 ), only small benefits have been obtained combining small molecules inhibiting EGFR with conventional treatment. Several studies have demonstrated association of EGFR with the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPKcs), a central component of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway involved in the repair of DNA strand breaks ( 12 , 13 ).

Recently, it has been reported that a fraction of intracellular EGFR is located within the nucleus where it may activate transcription of genes associated with cell proliferation and the nitric oxide pathway, including cyclin D1, iNOS, c-myb and COX-2 ( 14 - 17 ). Evidence for the expression and activity of nuclear EGFR has been found using a variety of techniques including fractional immunoblotting, confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Nuclear EGFR has been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in a variety of malignancies including breast, head and neck and ovarian cancer ( 16 , 18 ). The intracellular localization of EGFR may therefore have profound effects on response both to chemotherapy and to novel therapies inhibiting the EGFR pathway.

EGFR cellular distribution is dictated by several regulatory motifs within the juxtamembrane domain ( 19 ). Two basolateral signals control EGFR re-sorting to the transmembrane ( 20 ), whereas the lysosomal signal (accessible following EGF receptor activation) determines EGFR degradation ( 21 ). The nuclear localization sequence (NLS), comprising 13 amino acids 645-657 (RRRHIVRKLLRR) ( 22 ), has a dual role. It allows nuclear translocation via sequence recognition and binding to Importin β ( 23 ), and mediates EGFR allosteric conformational change and dimer stabilisation, which are indispensable for the receptor activation ( 24 , 25 ).

Studies on the somatically acquired, constitutively active EGFR mutant L858R, found in certain non-small cell lung cancers, have shown impaired nuclear localization and DNAPKcs binding ( 26 ). This suggests that EGFR activation and nuclear translocation are related and that nuclear localization may modulate DNA repair.

Nuclear translocation of EGFR following ionising radiation has been shown to result in increased repair of DNA stand breaks ( 12 ). The effects of nuclear translocation on repair of chemotherapy-induced DNA damage are less clear. We therefore investigated the significance of nuclear localization for the repair of cisplatin and ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage, using EGFR constructs with mutations in the NLS, as well as mutations found in human cancers (EGFRvIII, L858R). Cells expressing EGFR with mutations impairing nuclear transport demonstrated reduced repair of DNA stand breaks following IR, and reduced unhooking of interstrand crosslinks following treatment with cisplatin, as compared with cells expressing wild type EGFR. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed association of EGFR with DNAPKcs following treatment with cisplatin or IR. Confocal microscopy confirmed that cells with mutations in the NLS failed to translocate to the nucleus following IR and cisplatin treatment. These findings confirm the importance of nuclear translocation of EGFR in mediating effects on DNA repair and emphasise the significance of subcellular EGFR expression in determining responses to therapy.

DISCUSSION

Inhibitors of EGFR play a major role in cancer therapeutics. However, the activity of these agents as monotherapies is low and it is important to investigate regimens with optimal combinations using chemotherapy and radiation ( 3 ). There is evidence of the effects of EGFR inhibition on DNA repair following irradiation. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of nuclear EGFR in modulating the repair of DNA damage following cisplatin chemotherapy or radiation.

Expression of EGFR in the nucleus is well-established but the implications on effects of therapy are not clear. According to recent reports, EGFR nuclear translocation requires receptor dimerization and activation as, following internalization, mature and active EGFR may become a poor substrate for lysosomal degradation ( 33 , 34 ). This allows indirect sorting of the receptor through the Golgi, or direct sorting through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Subsequent association with sec61 results in retro-translocation to the cytosol where EGFR is stabilized following association with HSP70 ( 33 ). Binding of Importin β, mediated through the NLS sequence, translocates the receptor to the nucleus ( 22 , 33 ). Inactive receptors (or those without an active conformation) are usually sent back to the plasma membrane via the recognition of a basolateral signal in the JX domain ( 19 ).

The interaction of EGFR with DNAPKcs has been demonstrated in several studies ( 12 )The DNAPK complex plays a key role in non-homologous end joining, the major method of repair of DNA strand breaks following IR. Interaction of EGFR with DNAPKcs has been shown to contribute to the repair of DNA strand breaks. Inhibition of EGFR, by cetuximab or gefitinib, inhibits repair of IR-induced DNA strand breaks and impairs EGFR-DNAPKcs interaction ( 4 , 11 ).

It is well known that interstrand crosslinks contribute significantly to cisplatin cytotoxicity and that unhooking of interstrand crosslinks may be used to determine clinical sensitivity ( 35 ). In previous studies we demonstrated that the unhooking of cisplatin DNA interstrand crosslinks was inhibited by gefitinib, and that this is mediated through the DNA-PK pathway ( 31 ). This pathway has been demonstrated to have relevance in the repair of cisplatin-induced DNA damage ( 36 ).

In this study, we show that EGFR nuclear expression in transfected EGFR-null cells modulates repair of DNA damage through the DNA-PK pathway. Cells expressing EGFR constructs with mutated NLS sequence are inhibited in their ability to unhook DNA interstrand crosslinks ( 35 ). Abrogation of nuclear expression of EGFR results in significant delay in repair of interstrand crosslink in these cells. This correlates with reduced association of EGFR with DNAPKcs. Cells expressing constructs which do not translocate to the nucleus showed increased sensitivity to cisplatin ( supplementary figure S3 ). Previous studies have shown that EGFR nuclear translocation correlated with repair of IR induced strand breaks.

It has been shown previously that the association between DNAPKcs and EGFR peaks at 20 minutes following IR ( 37 ), but association following cisplatin treatment has not been described. Here we show that binding peaks at 18 hours following cisplatin treatment. The different timing following cisplatin and IR likely reflect different types of DNA lesions and repair mechanisms. There was reduced repair of DNA IR-induced strand breaks in cells expressing EGFR constructs which do not translocate to the nucleus. Repair of DNA strand breaks following IR has been shown to be modulated by EGFR ( 37 ), and the less marked effects of impaired EGFR nuclear translocation, as compared with the repair of cisplatin-induced interstrand crosslinks, may be secondary to the activation of other DNA repair pathways ( 12 ).

In this study, the nuclear translocation of EGFR was demonstrated by confocal microscopy. Interestingly, these experiments suggest that there is co-localization of EGFR and DNAPKcs both within the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Although the primary location of DNAPKcs is in the nucleus in the formation of complexes on damaged DNA, cytoplasmic expression of DNAPKcs has been demonstrated in several studies ( 38 - 40 ). The results of the Proximity Ligation Assay demonstrate physical proximity of DNAPKcs and EGFR following DNA damage by cisplatin or IR in cells with intact nuclear localization. This was not shown in cells expressing EGFR constructs deficient in nuclear localization.

There is contradictory evidence regarding nuclear expression of EGFRvIII. While EGFRvIII and STAT3 co-localization within the nucleus was demonstrated in some studies ( 17 , 41 ), other studies have reported lack of nuclear expression in glioma models ( 42 ). Cells expressing EGFRvIII show elevated activation of DNA-PKcs and enhancement of DNA strand breaks repair. In this study we show that EGFRvIII and wtEGFR undergo nuclear translocation and binding with DNAPKcs following cisplatin or IR treatment.

Although cells expressing kinase-dead EGFR showed lack of nuclear translocation, expression of the L858R mutant also resulted in impaired nuclear expression despite constitutive kinase activity. This resulted in reduction of DNA strand breaks repair which is consistent with the observation that non-small cell lung cancer lines expressing L858R show increased sensitivity to IR ( 43 ) and reduced nuclear expression ( 26 ). Moreover, the difference in repair between cells expressing L858R (kinase active but with impaired nuclear localization) and M1or M12 (kinase active and expressed in the nucleus) suggests that it is the impaired nuclear EGFR accumulation (which is a consequence of the lack of allosteric activation) and not kinase activity per se that determines the reduced DNA repair in these models.

The impaired kinase activity shown by the NLS123 mutant supports the previously described allosteric mode of activation of EGFR and the importance played by the third cluster of arginines (646-RR-647) within the NLS sequence in adopting an α-helical conformation which is indispensable for EGFR activation ( 25 , 34 ). The impairment of other EGFR functions, as a result of mutations in the NLS sequence, has not been excluded. Interestingly, the LNLS123 mutant shows kinase activation despite bearing the same NLS mutation that renders the NLS123 kinase-dead. This suggests that the L858R mutation, which has been shown to thermodynamically stabilise EGFR ( 44 , 45 ), allows receptor activation that does not require the allosteric conformational change. Further work will be required to investigate whether the L858R inhibition of nuclear translocation is therefore due to a structurally hidden NLS sequence.

EGFR inhibition by gefitinib has been shown to suppress DNA repair following treatment with radiation and cisplatin ( 31 ). Similarly, in this study, the kinase dead mutant KMT (mutation K721A), shows no nuclear localization suggesting that the targeting of the EGFR kinase domain interferes with nuclear translocation and consequently with repair. Maximal effect of gefitinib on inhibition of interstrand crosslinks was observed only in EGFR constructs translocating to the nucleus ( supplementary figure S4 ). A recent study demonstrated that cisplatin resistance and DNA repair was dependent on nuclear translocation ( 23 ). Here, we have shown that a variety of EGFR mutants deficient in nuclear expression show impaired repair and that nuclear accumulation is a major determinant of repair of cisplatin induced interstrand crosslinks. Additionally we recently demonstrated that expression of HER2 modulated repair of cisplatin-induced interstrand crosslinks and that this also requires nuclear expression ( 27 ). Other factors may contribute to the interaction between cisplatin and the EGFR pathway in therapy including ubiquitination of EGFR induced by cisplatin in head and neck cancer cells ( 46 ).

There has been extensive study on the interaction of the EGFR and DNAPK pathways. Following the initial observation that cetuximab treatment inhibits EGFR/DNAPKcs interaction ( 47 ), the role of this interaction in modulation of DNA repair has been confirmed. Cells expressing specific EGFR mutations found in human cancer such as the L858R in non-small cell lung cancer have been found to show sensitivity to IR. This includes delayed DNA repair kinetics, defective IR-induced arrest in DNA synthesis and increased apoptosis ( 26 ). Here we show that inhibition of EGFR nuclear translocation alters DNAPKcs cellular distribution.

Stimulation of DNA-PK kinase activity was associated with nuclear expression and binding. There are likely other factors apart from EGFR-DNAPKcs binding which may influence the effect of EGFR on DNA repair. EGF induces nuclear translocation of EGFR but this is not associated with EGFR-DNAPKcs interaction. Receptor kinase activation may influence, indirectly, DNA-PK possibly by activation of the AKT pathway which has been shown to be a kinase of DNAPKcs ( 48 , 49 ).

These results suggest that nuclear expression of EGFR plays a significant role in response to cisplatin and radiation. The intracellular localization of EGFR may play a critical part in response to therapies combining inhibitors of the EGFR pathway with chemotherapy or radiation. Understanding of the mechanisms by which nuclear expression modulates therapeutic effects of these modalities will optimise design of clinical studies in the future.
