Mutations in the HFE gene and a newly identified second transferrin receptor 
gene, TfR2, cause hemochromatosis. The cognate proteins, HFE and TfR2, are 
therefore of key importance in human iron homeostasis. HFE is expressed in small 
intestinal crypt cells where transferrin-iron entry may determine subsequent 
iron absorption by mature enterocytes, but the physiological function of TfR2 is 
unknown. Using specific peptide antisera, we examined the duodenal localization 
of HFE and TfR2 in humans and mice, with and without HFE deficiency, by confocal 
microscopy. We also investigated potential interactions of these proteins in 
human intestinal cells in situ. Duodenal expression of HFE and TfR2 (but not 
TfR1) in wild-type mice and humans was restricted to crypt cells, in which they 
co-localized. HFE deficiency disrupted this interaction, altering the cellular 
distribution of TfR2 in human crypts. In human Caco-2 cells, HFE and TfR2 
co-localized to a distinct CD63-negative vesicular compartment showing marked 
signal enhancement on exposure to iron-saturated transferrin ligand, indicating 
that HFE preferentially interacts with TfR2 in a specialized early endosomal 
transport pathway for transferrin-iron. This interaction occurs specifically in 
small intestinal crypt cells that differentiate to become iron-absorbing 
enterocytes. Our immunohistochemical findings provide evidence for a novel 
mechanism for the regulation of iron balance in mammals.
