CD6 is a type I membrane glycoprotein expressed on thymocytes, mature T and B1a 
lymphocytes, and CNS cells. CD6 binds to activated leukocyte cell adhesion 
molecule (CD166), and is considered as a costimulatory molecule involved in 
lymphocyte activation and thymocyte development. Accordingly, CD6 partially 
associates with the TCR/CD3 complex and colocalizes with it at the center of the 
mature immunological synapse (IS) on T lymphocytes. However, the signaling 
pathway used by CD6 is still mostly unknown. The yeast two-hybrid system has 
allowed us the identification of syntenin-1 as an interacting protein with the 
cytoplasmic tail of CD6. Syntenin-1 is a PDZ (postsynaptic density protein-95, 
postsynaptic discs large, and zona occludens-1) domain-containing protein, which 
functions as an adaptor protein able to bind cytoskeletal proteins and signal 
transduction effectors. Mutational analyses showed that certain amino acids of 
the most C-terminal sequence of CD6 (-YDDISAA) and the two postsynaptic density 
protein-95, postsynaptic discs large, and zona occludens-1 domains of syntenin-1 
are relevant to the interaction. Further confirmation of the CD6-syntenin-1 
interaction was obtained from pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays in 
mammalian cells. Image analyses also showed that syntenin-1 accumulates at CD6 
caps and at the IS. Therefore, we propose that syntenin-1 may function as a 
scaffolding protein coupling CD6 and most likely other lymphocyte receptors to 
cytoskeleton and/or signaling effectors during IS maturation.
