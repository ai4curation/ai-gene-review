Abstract

The SWI/SNF family of chromatin-remodeling complexes facilitates
 gene expression by helping transcription factors gain access to their
 targets in chromatin. SWI/SNF and Rsc are distinctive members of this
 family from yeast. They have similar protein components and catalytic
 activities but differ in biological function. Rsc is required for cell
 cycle progression through mitosis, whereas SWI/SNF is not. Human
 complexes of this family have also been identified, which have often
 been considered related to yeast SWI/SNF. However, all human subunits
 identified to date are equally similar to components of both SWI/SNF
 and Rsc, leaving open the possibility that some or all of the human
 complexes are rather related to Rsc. Here, we present evidence that the
 previously identified human SWI/SNF-B complex is indeed of the Rsc
 type. It contains six components conserved in both Rsc and SWI/SNF.
 Importantly, it has a unique subunit, BAF180, that harbors a
 distinctive set of structural motifs characteristic of three components
 of Rsc. Of the two mammalian ATPases known to be related to those in
 the yeast complexes, human SWI/SNF-B contains only the homolog that
 functions like Rsc during cell growth. Immunofluorescence studies with
 a BAF180 antibody revealed that SWI/SNF-B localizes at the
 kinetochores of chromosomes during mitosis. Our data suggest that
 SWI/SNF-B and Rsc represent a novel subfamily of chromatin-remodeling
 complexes conserved from yeast to human, and could participate in cell
 division at kinetochores of mitotic chromosomes.

Discussion

The SWI/SNF family of chromatin-remodeling complexes
 includes SWI/SNF and Rsc from yeast, BAF (SWI/SNF-A) and
 PBAF (SWI/SNF-B) from human. They share at least six homologous
 subunits (Table 1 ), and therefore very likely overlap substantially in
 structure. Most previous studies, however, have inferred a close
 relation between the human complexes and yeast SWI/SNF. In fact,
 all these human complexes have been referred to as
 “SWI/SNF-related” or simply “human SWI/SNF.”
 The importance of our finding is that it demonstrates that PBAF is
 structurally related to Rsc rather than SWI/SNF. This finding
 may prompt reconsideration of the interpretation of experiments that
 used a mixture of BAF and PBAF. Some biological functions previously
 assigned to “human SWI/SNF” may actually be attributable
 to the “human Rsc” (PBAF) complex.

BAF180 is likely a combined homolog of yeast Rsc1, Rsc2, and Rsc4. It
 confers a set of biochemical features to PBAF similar to those provided
 for yeast Rsc by the three Rsc proteins. The same three yeast proteins
 are the only unique subunits of Rsc that have a homolog in the
 completed C. elegans database (B. Cairns, personal
 communication). The fact that no other Rsc proteins are conserved in
 higher eucaryotes is consistent with the notion that the only conserved
 biochemical markers for this subfamily of complexes are those present
 in BAF180 and in Rsc1, Rsc2, and Rsc4. Our study thus suggests that Rsc
 and PBAF represent an evolutionarily conserved subfamily of
 chromatin-remodeling complexes. SWI/SNF and BAF would represent
 the other subfamily, with its own distinctive structural motifs ( 51 ).

If human PBAF and BAF have functions as distinct as their yeast
 counterparts, the subunits unique to each complex must confer
 specificity. Indeed, the domains present in BAF180 are all capable of
 targeting PBAF to chromatin. The bromodomains and BAH-regions are
 conserved in yeast Rsc1/Rsc2 and are required for the Rsc
 functions ( 39 ). Structural analysis has suggested that a bromodomain
 can serve as an acetyl-lysine-binding motif, and may target proteins to
 acetylated chromatin ( 45 ). The function of BAH is currently unknown,
 but HMG domains can bind DNA or chromatin and play
 “architectural” roles during formation of higher-order
 nucleoprotein complexes ( 46 ). It is therefore possible that,
 through these domains, BAF180 anchors PBAF to its specific sites in
 chromatin.

Distinguishing the two distinct subfamilies of complexes may help to
 rationalize previously puzzling genetic data. Both
 SWI2/SNF2-related ATPases in mammals, brm and BRG1, have been
 genetically altered in mice and tissue culture cells. Mice in which the
 mbrm gene was disrupted were viable ( 26 ), whereas F9 teratocarcinoma
 cells deleted for the mBRG1 gene were inviable ( 47 ). These results
 parallel those in yeast, where cells inactivated of SWI2/SNF2
 (the ATPase of SWI/SNF) are viable, whereas disruption of STH1
 (the ATPase of Rsc) is lethal. The data imply that brm and BRG1 might
 be the functional equivalents of SWI2/SNF2 and STH1,
 respectively, in mammalian cells. In accord with these genetic data, we
 found that both hbrm and BRG1 are present in BAF ( 51 ), but only BRG1 is
 present in PBAF (Fig. 3 c ). Consequently, disrupting the brm
 gene would abolish only the subset of BAF complexes that have brm, but
 not those containing BRG1; and all PBAF complexes would remain intact.
 In contrast, deletion of the BRG1 gene similarly abolished only a
 subset of BAF. But importantly, it completely eliminated the PBAF
 complexes, leading to cell death. The data further suggest that
 mammalian PBAF, like its yeast counterpart Rsc, may be essential for
 cell growth.

Our observation that PBAF localizes to kinetochores of mitotic
 chromosomes implies that PBAF may play a role there during mitosis.
 This notion is consistent with several yeast studies for the related
 Rsc complex. First, several rsc mutants are blocked at
 G 2 /M transition of the cell cycle
 ( 15 – 17 ). This block depends on the spindle-assembly checkpoint ( 17 ),
 but not the DNA-damage checkpoint ( 16 ). Because the spindle checkpoint
 is usually activated by a failure of chromosome attachment to
 microtubules or by spindle damage, Rsc is probably required for either
 kinetochore function, or spindle assembly, or both. Second, an rsc mutant is more sensitive to a microtubule-destabilizing
 drug ( 17 ). The increased sensitivity of cells to
 microtubule-destabilizing drugs is a phenotype commonly observed in
 mutants of kinetochore components, or mutants of tubulin,
 microtubule-associated proteins, and components of the spindle
 checkpoint. Third, an rsc mutant exhibits increased
 frequency of non-disjunction of minichromosomes, which could be caused
 by defective interactions between kinetochores of paired sister
 chromatids and spindles ( 17 ). Fourth, an rsc mutant displays
 altered chromatin structure at centromeres ( 17 ). Two earlier models
 have been proposed to explain these data. One model proposed that the
 altered centromeric chromatin structure in the rsc mutant
 may impair kinetochore functions and lead to execution of the spindle
 checkpoint ( 17 ). The second model hypothesized that Rsc may be needed
 for transcription of genes required for mitosis ( 16 , 17 ). Our
 observation appears to favor the first model. It remains to be
 investigated, however, whether PBAF has additional kinetochore
 functions other than maintaining centromeric chromatin structure.
