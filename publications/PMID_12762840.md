Availability of the complete sequence of the human genome and sequence homology 
analysis has accelerated new protein discovery and clues to protein function. 
Protein-protein interaction cloning suggests multisubunit complexes and 
pathways. Here, we combine these molecular approaches with cultured cell 
colocalization analysis to suggest a novel complex and a pathway that integrate 
the mitochondrial location and the microtubular cytoskeleton with chromosome 
remodeling, apoptosis, and tumor suppression based on a novel leucine-rich 
pentatricopeptide repeat-motif-containing protein (LRPPRC) that copurified with 
the fibroblast growth factor receptor complex. One round of interaction cloning 
and sequence homology analysis defined a primary LRPPRC complex with novel 
subunits cat eye syndrome chromosome region candidate 2 (CECR2), ubiquitously 
expressed transcript (UXT), and chromosome 19 open reading frames 5 (C19ORF5) 
but still of unknown function. Immuno, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and green 
fluorescent protein (GFP) tag colocalization analyses revealed that LRPPRC 
appears in both cytosol and nuclei of cultured cells, colocalizes with 
mitochondria and beta-tubulin rather than with alpha-actin in the cytosol of 
interphase cells, and exhibits phase-dependent organization around separating 
chromosomes in mitotic cells. GFP-tagged CECR2B was strictly nuclear and 
colocalized with condensed DNA in apoptotic cells. GFP-tagged UXT and GFP-tagged 
C19ORF5 appeared in both cytosol and nuclei and colocalized with LRPPRC and 
beta-tubulin. Cells exhibiting nuclear C19ORF5 were apoptotic. Screening for 
interactive substrates with the primary LRPPRC substrates in the human liver 
complementary DNA library revealed that CECR2B interacted with 
chromatin-associated TFIID-associated protein TAFII30 and ribonucleic acid 
splicing factor SRP40, UXT bridged to CBP/p300-binding factor CITED2 and 
kinetochore-associated factor BUB3, and C19ORF5 complexed with 
mitochondria-associated NADH dehydrogenase I and cytochrome c oxidase I. C19ORF5 
also interacted with RASSF1, providing a bridge to apoptosis and tumor 
suppression.
