Mutation of the autophosphorylation sites of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases 
alters ligand dependent internalization and down-regulation, indicating a 
critical role for these sites in receptor processing. Currently, no differences 
in receptor processing based on an individual autophosphorylation site have been 
defined. By using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the src 
homology 2 domains of phospholipase C-gamma1 to specifically recognize tyrosine 
992 on the EGF receptor (Tyr(P)992), we have found differences in this 
subpopulation of receptors. Following EGF stimulation, the number of Tyr(P)992 
receptors increased 2-fold over receptors identified by an antibody that 
recognizes activated EGF receptors (alpha-Act. EGFR) in A431 cells. Confocal 
fluorescence microscopy showed that Tyr(P)992 receptors underwent endocytosis at 
a slower rate and did not rapidly concentrate in juxtanuclear bodies. Tyr(P)992 
receptors were associated with more SOS, Ras-GTPase activating protein, 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and SHPTP2/syp, but less Grb2, than receptors in 
the general population, and these receptors were more heavily phosphorylated 
than the general population of active receptors. These findings suggest that 
autophosphorylation status is relevant to the endocytosis, degradation, and 
effector molecule interaction of individual EGF receptors. Further 
investigations based on phosphorylation status should provide new insights into 
how receptor protein-tyrosine kinase signaling is regulated.
