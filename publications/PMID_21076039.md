The signaling network of innate immunity in Drosophila is constructed by 
multiple evolutionarily conserved pathways, including the Toll- or Imd-regulated 
NF-κB and JNK pathways. The p38 MAPK pathway is evolutionarily conserved in 
stress responses, but its role in Drosophila host defense is not fully 
understood. Here we show that the p38 pathway also participates in Drosophila 
host defense. In comparison with wild-type flies, the sensitivity to microbial 
infection was slightly higher in the p38a mutant, significantly higher in the 
p38b mutant, but unchanged in the p38c mutant. The p38b;p38a double-mutant flies 
were hypersensitive to septic injury. The immunodeficiency of p38b;p38a mutant 
flies was also demonstrated by hindgut melanization and larvae stage lethality 
that were induced by microbes naturally presented in fly food. A canonical 
MAP3K-MKK cascade was found to mediate p38 activation in response to infection 
in flies. However, neither Toll nor Imd was required for microbe-induced p38 
activation. We found that p38-activated heat-shock factor and suppressed JNK 
collectively contributed to host defense against infection. Together, our data 
demonstrate that the p38 pathway-mediated stress response contribute to 
Drosophila host defense against microbial infection.
