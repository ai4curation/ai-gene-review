OBJECTIVE: To observe the changes of NYGGF4 gene expression during human 
preadipocyte differentiation and to explore the regulative role of tumor 
necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) on NYGGF4 gene expression in matured human 
adipocytes.
METHODS: Human preadipocytes-visceral (HPA-v) were cultured in vitro and 
differentiated into the matured adipocytes. Fully differentiated adipocytes were 
treated with TNFalpha in different concentrations for 16 hours or at 10 ng/mL 
for various times. Levels of the NYGGF4 mRNA were evaluated by real-time reverse 
transcription-PCR(RT-PCR).
RESULTS: (1) After induction of differentiation, more than 90% of the HPAs-v 
exhibited typical adipocyte morphology on the 17th day. (2) In human 
preadipocytes, the level of NYGGF4 mRNA expression remained low. The NYGGF4 mRNA 
level was gradually increased with the preadipocytes being differentiated into 
the matured adipocytes, and reached the highest level in the fully 
differentiated adipocytes. (3) Treatment of the human matured adipocytes with 
TNFalpha resulted in a significant increase in the level of NYGGF4 mRNA. The 
up-regulatory effect of TNFalpha on the NYGGF4 gene expression tended to be 
enhanced with the increasing concentrations and elongation of time.
CONCLUSION: During human preadipocytes differentiation, the level of NYGGF4 gene 
mRNA expression increases gradually. TNFalpha could upregulate the expression of 
NYGGF4 mRNA in human matured adipocytes. The regulatory effect of TNFalpha on 
the NYGGF4 gene expression is of dose-dependent and time-correlated.
