Mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa 2 (RP2) gene cause a severe form of 
X-linked retinal degeneration. RP2 is a ubiquitous 350 amino acid plasma 
membrane-associated protein, which shares homology with the tubulin-specific 
chaperone cofactor C. RP2 protein, like cofactor C, stimulates the GTPase 
activity of tubulin in combination with cofactor D. RP2 has also been shown to 
interact with ADP ribosylation factor-like 3 (Arl3) in a nucleotide and 
myristoylation-dependant manner. In this study we have examined the relationship 
between RP2, cofactor C and Arl3 in patient-derived cell lines and in the 
retina. Examination of lymphoblastoid cells from patients with an Arg120stop 
nonsense mutation in RP2 revealed that the expression levels of cofactor C and 
Arl3 were not affected by the absence of RP2. In human retina, RP2 was localized 
to the plasma membrane of cells throughout the retina. RP2 was present at the 
plasma membrane in both rod and cone photoreceptors, extending from the outer 
segment through the inner segment to the synaptic terminals. There was no 
enrichment of RP2 staining in any photoreceptor organelle. In contrast, cofactor 
C and Arl3 localized predominantly to the photoreceptor connecting cilium in rod 
and cone photoreceptors. Cofactor C was cytoplasmic in distribution, whereas 
Arl3 localized to other microtubule structures within all cells. Arl3 behaved as 
a microtubule-associated protein: it co-localized with microtubules in HeLa 
cells and this was enhanced following microtubule stabilization with taxol. 
Furthermore, Arl3 co-purified with microtubules from bovine brain. Following 
microtubule depolymerization with nocodazole, Arl3 relocalized to the nuclear 
membrane. These data suggest that RP2 functions in concert with Arl3 to link the 
cell membrane with the cytoskeleton in photoreceptors as part of the cell 
signaling or vesicular transport machinery.
