Human SCO1 and SCO2 are paralogous genes that code for metallochaperone proteins 
with essential, but poorly understood, roles in copper delivery to cytochrome c 
oxidase (COX). Mutations in these genes produce tissue-specific COX deficiencies 
associated with distinct clinical phenotypes, although both are ubiquitously 
expressed. To investigate the molecular function of the SCO proteins, we 
characterized the mitochondrial copper delivery pathway in SCO1 and SCO2 patient 
backgrounds. Immunoblot analysis of patient cell lines showed reduced levels of 
the mutant proteins, resulting in a defect in COX assembly, and the appearance 
of a common assembly intermediate. Overexpression of the metallochaperone COX17 
rescued the COX deficiency in SCO2 patient cells but not in SCO1 patient cells. 
Overexpression of either wild-type SCO protein in the reciprocal patient 
background resulted in a dominant-negative phenotype, suggesting a physical 
interaction between SCO1 and SCO2. Chimeric proteins, constructed from the 
C-terminal copper-binding and N-terminal matrix domains of the two SCO proteins 
failed to complement the COX deficiency in either patient background, but mapped 
the dominant-negative phenotype in the SCO2 background to the N-terminal domain 
of SCO1, the most divergent part of the two SCO proteins. Our results 
demonstrate that the human SCO proteins have non-overlapping, cooperative 
functions in mitochondrial copper delivery. Size exclusion chromatography 
suggests that both the proteins function as homodimers. We propose a model in 
which COX17 delivers copper to SCO2, which in turn transfers it directly to the 
CuA site at an early stage of COX assembly in a reaction that is facilitated by 
SCO1.
