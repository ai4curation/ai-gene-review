The presence of multiple membrane-bound intracellular compartments is a major 
feature of eukaryotic cells. Many of the proteins required for formation and 
maintenance of these compartments share an evolutionary history. Here, we 
identify the SEA (Seh1-associated) protein complex in yeast that contains the 
nucleoporin Seh1 and Sec13, the latter subunit of both the nuclear pore complex 
and the COPII coating complex. The SEA complex also contains Npr2 and Npr3 
proteins (upstream regulators of TORC1 kinase) and four previously 
uncharacterized proteins (Sea1-Sea4). Combined computational and biochemical 
approaches indicate that the SEA complex proteins possess structural 
characteristics similar to the membrane coating complexes COPI, COPII, the 
nuclear pore complex, and, in particular, the related Vps class C vesicle 
tethering complexes HOPS and CORVET. The SEA complex dynamically associates with 
the vacuole in vivo. Genetic assays indicate a role for the SEA complex in 
intracellular trafficking, amino acid biogenesis, and response to nitrogen 
starvation. These data demonstrate that the SEA complex is an additional member 
of a family of membrane coating and vesicle tethering assemblies, extending the 
repertoire of protocoatomer-related complexes.
