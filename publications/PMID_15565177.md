The transcription factor E2F1 does not only induce cell proliferation but also 
shows the strongest proapoptotic effect of all E2F family members as part of an 
antitumor safeguard mechanism. We have recently identified KIAA0767 as a novel 
p53-independent target of E2F1. Here, we investigated the biological function of 
interaction. Overexpression studies of KIAA0767, termed 
D(eath)-I(nducing)-P(rotein), revealed its strong proapoptotic effect. DIP 
greatly reduced cell viability in several in vitro systems accompanied by 
typical apoptotic features such as caspase-3 activation and cleavage of 
poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase. Endogenous DIP levels increased following E2F1 
activation. Yet, inhibition of endogenous DIP function by small interfering RNA 
rescued p53-negative cells from E2F1-induced apoptosis, indicating that DIP is 
an essential mediator of the p53-independent E2F1 death pathway. Localization 
studies showed that DIP localizes to the mitochondria, where endogenous DIP is 
upregulated following E2F1 induction. These results provide new insights to the 
incompletely understood regulatory mechanisms of E2F1-induced apoptosis.
