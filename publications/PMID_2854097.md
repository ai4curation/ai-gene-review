Two overlapping clones, covering the entire coding sequence of human M2-type 
pyruvate kinase (PK) cDNA, were isolated and sequenced. Nucleotide sequencing 
results showed that they contained the 109-bp 5'-untranslated region, the 
1593-bp coding region and the 585-bp 3'-untranslated region. Nucleotide sequence 
homology was 90% and 69% with rat M2-type and L-type PK cDNA, respectively. In 
situ hybridization using the human M2-type PK cDNA probe disclosed that the gene 
for M2-type PK is located at band q22 on chromosome 15. Northern blot analysis 
with RNA from human hepatoma demonstrated that M2-type PK was predominantly 
expressed in hepatoma cells, whereas L-type PK was preferentially expressed in 
the non-tumor portion of the liver.
