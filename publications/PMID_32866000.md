l-tryptophan (Trp) is widely used in food and feed enforcement to play an 
important role in biological processes. Various metabolites of Trp perform its 
potent function. The indole pyruvate pathway is one of the main pathways of Trp 
metabolism in the gut microbiota, providing numerous indole-derivatives, which 
can modulate intestinal homeostasis and mucosal immunity by activating the aryl 
hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathway. In this study, we constructed an 
IL4I1-overexpressed 293T cell line and found that IL4I1 can catalyze Trp to 
produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and indole-3-carboxaldehyde (IAld). Moreover, 
both IAA and IAld are accumulated in dendritic cells (DCs) and can stimulate the 
expression of CYP1A1. Our results demonstrate the existence of the indole 
pyruvate pathway in host cells with IL4I1 as the key enzyme. The IL4I1-mediated 
Trp metabolism implies the role of dietary impact on immunity.
