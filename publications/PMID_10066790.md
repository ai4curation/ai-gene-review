Here we report the identification and characterization of AP-4, a novel protein 
complex related to the heterotetrameric AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 adaptors that 
mediate protein sorting in the endocytic and late secretory pathways. The key to 
the identification of this complex was the cloning and sequencing of two widely 
expressed, mammalian cDNAs encoding new homologs of the adaptor beta and sigma 
subunits named beta4 and sigma4, respectively. An antibody to beta4 recognized 
in human cells an approximately 83-kDa polypeptide that exists in both soluble 
and membrane-associated forms. Gel filtration, sedimentation velocity, and 
immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that beta4 is a component of a 
multisubunit complex (AP-4) that also contains the sigma4 polypeptide and two 
additional adaptor subunit homologs named mu4 (mu-ARP2) and epsilon. 
Immunofluorescence analyses showed that AP-4 is associated with the trans-Golgi 
network or an adjacent structure and that this association is sensitive to the 
drug brefeldin A. We propose that, like the related AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 
complexes, AP-4 plays a role in signal-mediated trafficking of integral membrane 
proteins in mammalian cells.
