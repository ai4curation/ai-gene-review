DNA polymerase zeta (Polzeta) is an error-prone DNA polymerase involved in 
translesion DNA synthesis. Polzeta consists of two subunits: the catalytic REV3, 
which belongs to B family DNA polymerase, and the noncatalytic REV7. REV7 also 
interacts with REV1 polymerase, which is an error-prone Y family DNA polymerase 
and is also involved in translesion DNA synthesis. Cells deficient in one of the 
three REV proteins and those deficient in all three proteins show similar 
phenotype, indicating the functional collaboration of the three REV proteins. 
REV7 interacts with both REV3 and REV1 polymerases, but the structure of REV7 or 
REV3, as well as the structural and functional basis of the REV1-REV7 and 
REV3-REV7 interactions, remains unknown. Here we show the first crystal 
structure of human REV7 in complex with a fragment of human REV3 polymerase 
(residues 1847-1898) and reveal the mechanism underlying REV7-REV3 interaction. 
The structure indicates that the interaction between REV7 and REV3 creates a 
structural interface for REV1 binding. Furthermore, we show that the 
REV7-mediated interactions are responsible for DNA damage tolerance. Our results 
highlight the function of REV7 as an adapter protein to recruit Polzeta to a 
lesion site. REV7 is alternatively called MAD2B or MAD2L2 and also involved in 
various cellular functions such as signal transduction and cell cycle 
regulation. Our results will provide a general structural basis for 
understanding the REV7 interaction.
