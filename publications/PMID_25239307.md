Deficiency of the phospholipid flippase ATPase, aminophospholipid transporter, 
class I, type 8B, member 1 (ATP8B1) causes progressive familial intrahepatic 
cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1) and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 
(BRIC1). Apart from cholestasis, many patients also suffer from diarrhea of yet 
unknown etiology. Here we have studied the hypothesis that intestinal ATP8B1 
deficiency results in bile salt malabsorption as a possible cause of PFIC1/BRIC1 
diarrhea. Bile salt transport was studied in ATP8B1-depleted intestinal Caco-2 
cells. Apical membrane localization was studied by a biotinylation approach. 
Fecal bile salt and electrolyte contents were analyzed in stool samples of PFIC1 
patients, of whom some had undergone biliary diversion or liver transplantation. 
Bile salt uptake by the apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter solute 
carrier family 10 (sodium/bile acid cotransporter), member 2 (SLC10A2) was 
strongly impaired in ATP8B1-depleted Caco-2 cells. The reduced SLC10A2 activity 
coincided with strongly reduced apical membrane localization, which was caused 
by impaired apical membrane insertion of SLC10A2. Moreover, we show that 
endogenous ATP8B1 exists in a functional heterodimer with transmembrane protein 
30A (CDC50A) in Caco-2 cells. Analyses of stool samples of post-transplant PFIC1 
patients demonstrated that bile salt content was not changed, whereas sodium and 
chloride concentrations were elevated and potassium levels were decreased. The 
ATP8B1-CDC50A heterodimer is essential for the apical localization of SLC10A2 in 
Caco-2 cells. Diarrhea in PFIC1/BRIC1 patients has a secretory origin to which 
SLC10A2 deficiency may contribute. This results in elevated luminal bile salt 
concentrations and consequent enhanced electrolyte secretion and/or reduced 
electrolyte resorption.
