The X-linked disorder oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe is caused by mutation 
of the OCRL1 protein, an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase. OCRL1 is 
localised to the Golgi apparatus and early endosomes, and can translocate to 
lamellipodia upon growth factor stimulation. We show here that OCRL1 interacts 
with several members of the rab family of small GTPases. Strongest interaction 
is seen with Golgi-associated rab1 and rab6 and endosomal rab5. Point mutants 
defective in rab binding fail to target to the Golgi apparatus and endosomes, 
strongly suggesting rab interaction is required for targeting of OCRL1 to these 
compartments. Membrane recruitment via rab binding is required for changes in 
Golgi and endosomal dynamics induced by overexpression of catalytically inactive 
OCRL1. In vitro experiments demonstrate that rab5 and rab6 directly stimulate 
the 5-phosphatase activity of OCRL1. We conclude that rabs play a dual role in 
regulation of OCRL1, firstly targeting it to the Golgi apparatus and endosomes, 
and secondly, directly stimulating the 5-phosphatase activity of OCRL1 after 
membrane recruitment.
