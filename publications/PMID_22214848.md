Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is an autosomal dominant episodic 
movement disorder. Patients have episodes that last 1 to 4 hours and are 
precipitated by alcohol, coffee, and stress. Previous research has shown that 
mutations in an uncharacterized gene on chromosome 2q33-q35 (which is termed 
PNKD) are responsible for PNKD. Here, we report the generation of antibodies 
specific for the PNKD protein and show that it is widely expressed in the mouse 
brain, exclusively in neurons. One PNKD isoform is a membrane-associated 
protein. Transgenic mice carrying mutations in the mouse Pnkd locus equivalent 
to those found in patients with PNKD recapitulated the human PNKD phenotype. 
Staining for c-fos demonstrated that administration of alcohol or caffeine 
induced neuronal activity in the basal ganglia in these mice. They also showed 
nigrostriatal neurotransmission deficits that were manifested by reduced 
extracellular dopamine levels in the striatum and a proportional increase of 
dopamine release in response to caffeine and ethanol treatment. These findings 
support the hypothesis that the PNKD protein functions to modulate striatal 
neuro-transmitter release in response to stress and other precipitating factors.
