Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is caused by polyalanine expansion in 
nuclear protein PABPN1 [poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1] and characterized by 
muscle degeneration. Druggable modifiers of proteotoxicity in degenerative 
diseases, notably the longevity modulators sirtuins, may constitute useful 
therapeutic targets. However, the modifiers of mutant PABPN1 are unknown. Here, 
we report that longevity and cell metabolism modifiers modulate mutant PABPN1 
toxicity in the muscle cell. Using PABPN1 nematodes that show muscle cell 
degeneration and abnormal motility, we found that increased dosage of the 
sirtuin and deacetylase sir-2.1/SIRT1 exacerbated muscle pathology, an effect 
dependent on the transcription factor daf-16/FoxO and fuel sensor aak-2/AMPK 
(AMP-activated protein kinase), while null mutants of sir-2.1, daf-16 and aak-2 
were protective. Consistently, the Sir2 inhibitor sirtinol was protective, 
whereas the Sir2 and AMPK activator resveratrol was detrimental. Furthermore, 
rescue by sirtinol was dependent on daf-16 and not aak-2, whereas aggravation by 
resveratrol was dependent on aak-2 and not daf-16. Finally, the survival of 
mammalian cells expressing mutant PABPN1 was promoted by sirtinol and decreased 
by resveratrol. Altogether, our data identify Sir2 and AMPK inhibition as 
therapeutic strategies for muscle protection in OPMD, extending the value of 
druggable proteins in cell maintenance networks to polyalanine diseases.
