hPFTAIRE1 (PFTK1), a Cdc2-related protein kinase, is highly expressed in human 
brain. It exhibits cytoplasmic distribution in Hela cells, although it contains 
two nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in its N-terminus. To search for its 
substrates and regulatory components, we screened a two-hybrid library by using 
the full-length hPFTAIRE1 as a bait. Four 14-3-3 isoforms (beta, epsilon, eta, 
tau) were identified interacting with the hPFTAIRE1. We found a putative 14-3-3 
binding consensus motif (RHSSPSS) in the hPFTAIRE1, which overlapped with its 
second NLS. Deletion of the RHSSPSS motif or substitution of Ser119 with Ala in 
the conserved binding motif abolished the specific interaction between the 
hPFTAIRE1 and the 14-3-3 proteins. The mutant S120A hPFTAIRE1 also showed a weak 
interaction to the 14-3-3 proteins. The results suggested that the Ser119 is 
crucial for the interaction between hPFTAIRE1 and the 14-3-3 proteins. All the 
hPFTAIRE1 mutants distributed in cytoplasm of Hela cells and human neuroblastoma 
cells (SH-SY5Y) when fused to the C-terminus of a green fluorescent protein 
(GFP), indicating that binding with the 14-3-3 proteins does not contribute to 
the subcellular localization of the hPFTAIRE1, although the binding may be 
involved in its signaling regulation.
