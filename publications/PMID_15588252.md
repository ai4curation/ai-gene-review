Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/Smads regulate a wide variety of 
biological responses through transcriptional regulation of target genes. Smad3 
plays a key role in TGF-beta/Smad-mediated transcriptional responses. Here, we 
show that the proline-rich linker region of Smad3 contains a transcriptional 
activation domain. When the linker region is fused to a heterologous DNA-binding 
domain, it activates transcription. We show that the linker region physically 
interacts with p300. The adenovirus E1a protein, which binds to p300, inhibits 
the transcriptional activity of the linker region, and overexpression of p300 
can rescue the linker-mediated transcriptional activation. In contrast, an 
adenovirus E1a mutant, which cannot bind to p300, does not inhibit the 
linker-mediated transcription. The native Smad3 protein lacking the linker 
region is unable to mediate TGF-beta transcriptional activation responses, 
although it can be phosphorylated by the TGF-beta receptor at the C-terminal 
tail and has a significantly increased ability to form a heteromeric complex 
with Smad4. We show further that the linker region and the C-terminal domain of 
Smad3 synergize for transcriptional activation in the presence of TGF-beta. Thus 
our findings uncover an important function of the Smad3 linker region in 
Smad-mediated transcriptional control.
