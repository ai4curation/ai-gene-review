Impaired mitochondrial maintenance in disparate cell types is a shared hallmark 
of many human pathologies and ageing. How mitochondrial biogenesis coordinates 
with the removal of damaged or superfluous mitochondria to maintain cellular 
homeostasis is not well understood. Here we show that mitophagy, a selective 
type of autophagy targeting mitochondria for degradation, interfaces with 
mitochondrial biogenesis to regulate mitochondrial content and longevity in 
Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that DCT-1 is a key mediator of mitophagy and 
longevity assurance under conditions of stress in C. elegans. Impairment of 
mitophagy compromises stress resistance and triggers mitochondrial retrograde 
signalling through the SKN-1 transcription factor that regulates both 
mitochondrial biogenesis genes and mitophagy by enhancing DCT-1 expression. Our 
findings reveal a homeostatic feedback loop that integrates metabolic signals to 
coordinate the biogenesis and turnover of mitochondria. Uncoupling of these two 
processes during ageing contributes to overproliferation of damaged mitochondria 
and decline of cellular function.
