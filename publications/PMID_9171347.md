Activation of mouse platelets by collagen is associated with tyrosine 
phosphorylation of multiple proteins including the Fc receptor gamma-chain, the 
tyrosine kinase Syk and phospholipase Cgamma2, suggesting that collagen signals 
in a manner similar to that of immune receptors. This hypothesis has been tested 
using platelets from mice lacking the Fc receptor gamma-chain or Syk. Tyrosine 
phosphorylation of Syk and phospholipase Cgamma2 by collagen stimulation is 
absent in mice lacking the Fc receptor gamma-chain. Tyrosine phosphorylation of 
phospholipase Cgamma2 by collagen stimulation is also absent in mice platelets 
which lack Syk, although phosphorylation of the Fc receptor gamma-chain is 
maintained. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of platelet proteins by the G 
protein-coupled receptor agonist thrombin is maintained in mouse platelets 
deficient in Fc receptor gamma-chain or Syk. The absence of Fc receptor 
gamma-chain or Syk is accompanied by a loss of secretion and aggregation 
responses in collagen- but not thrombin-stimulated platelets. These observations 
provide the first direct evidence of an essential role for the immunoreceptor 
tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in signalling by a non-immune receptor 
stimulus.

Abstract

Activation of mouse platelets by collagen is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins including the Fc receptor gamma-chain, the tyrosine kinase Syk and phospholipase Cgamma2, suggesting that collagen signals in a manner similar to that of immune receptors. This hypothesis has been tested using platelets from mice lacking the Fc receptor gamma-chain or Syk. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and phospholipase Cgamma2 by collagen stimulation is absent in mice lacking the Fc receptor gamma-chain. Tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma2 by collagen stimulation is also absent in mice platelets which lack Syk, although phosphorylation of the Fc receptor gamma-chain is maintained. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of platelet proteins by the G protein-coupled receptor agonist thrombin is maintained in mouse platelets deficient in Fc receptor gamma-chain or Syk. The absence of Fc receptor gamma-chain or Syk is accompanied by a loss of secretion and aggregation responses in collagen- but not thrombin-stimulated platelets. These observations provide the first direct evidence of an essential role for the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in signalling by a non-immune receptor stimulus.
