BACKGROUND & AIMS: The hereditary hemochromatosis-associated membrane proteins 
HFE, TfR2, and HJV are required for adequate hepatic expression of the iron 
hormone hepcidin. While the genetic interactions are clear, it remains elusive 
how bone morphogenetic protein co-receptor HJV functions together with HFE and 
TfR2 to activate hepcidin transcription via the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway. 
Here, we investigate whether HFE, TfR2, and HJV physically interact on the 
surface of hepatocytes.
METHODS: We explore protein-protein interactions by glycerol gradient 
sedimentation assays and co-immunoprecipitation analyses in transfected HuH7 
hepatoma-derived cells.
RESULTS: Our data demonstrate that HFE and TfR2 bind HJV in a non-competitive 
manner. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses provide direct experimental evidence 
that HFE, TfR2, and HJV form a multi-protein membrane complex. Our experiments 
show that like TfR2, HJV competes with TfR1 for binding to HFE, indicating that 
the expression of TfR2 and HJV may be critical for iron sensing. We identify 
residues 120-139 of the TfR2 extra-cellular domain as the critical amino acids 
required for the binding of both HFE and HJV. Interestingly, RGMA, a central 
nervous system homolog, can substitute for HJV in the complex and promote 
hepcidin transcription, implicating RGMA in the local control of hepcidin in the 
CNS.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings provide a biochemical basis for 
hepcidin control by HFE, TfR2, and HJV.
