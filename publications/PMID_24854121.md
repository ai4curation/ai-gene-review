The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a pivotal role in maintenance and regulation 
of the neural microenvironment. Brain endothelial cells (BECs), held together by 
tight junctions (TJs), have a primary role in restricting the permeability of 
the BBB. Endophilin-1 is a multifunctional protein that influences epithelial 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) endocytosis and degradation and plays an important 
role in regulating the glomerular filtration barrier in the kidney. Endophilin-1 
likely plays a similar role in controlling BBB permeability. In this study, we 
therefore analyzed the expression and function of endophilin-1 in the human BEC 
line hCMEC/D3. Our results show that endophilin-1 over-expression reduced the 
expression of the TJ-associated proteins ZO-1 and occludin and increased the 
paracellular permeability of hCMEC/D3 cells, whereas silencing of endogenous 
endophilin-1 yielded the opposite results. Over-expression of ZO-1 and occludin 
prevented the increase in permeability induced by endophilin-1 over-expression, 
whereas down-regulation of ZO-1 and occludin prevented the reduction in 
permeability induced by endophilin-1 silencing. Co-localization and 
co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that endophilin-1 interacts with 
the EGFR. The levels of EGFR and its downstream effector phosphorylated 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) are significantly decreased 
when endophilin-1 is over-expressed. Conversely, endophilin-1 down-regulation 
led to markedly increased levels of these proteins. In addition, the reduced 
permeability induced by endophilin-1 down-regulation was blocked by AG1478 and 
PD98059, inhibitors of EGFR and ERK1/2, respectively. Up-regulation of ZO-1 and 
occludin was blocked by the EGFR and ERK1/2 inhibitors. These results suggest 
that endophilin-1 regulates BBB permeability by controlling ZO-1 and occludin 
expression via the EGFR-ERK1/2 pathway in BECs.
