Multiple intracellular stress pathways converge on a single 
event--phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha and 
subsequent translational activation of the transcription factor ATF4. Exploring 
the consequences of this event has highlighted the ways in which stress is 
sensed and responded to via many distinct pathways.
