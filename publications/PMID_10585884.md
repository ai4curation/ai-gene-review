Heparan sulphate proteoglycans and the extracellular matrix of 
bone-marrow-stromal cells are important components of the microenvironment of 
haematopoietic tissues and are involved in the interaction of haematopoietic 
stem and stromal cells. Previous studies have emphasized the role of heparan 
sulphate proteoglycan synthesis by bone-marrow-stromal cells. In the present 
study we describe the expression of glypican-4 (GPC-4), belonging to the 
glypican family, in bone-marrow-stromal cells and haematopoietic-progenitor 
cells of human and murine origin. Expression of GPC-4 was shown on the 
mRNA-level by reverse transcription-PCR and Northern blot analysis. 
Amplification products were cloned and sequenced, to confirm these results. To 
analyze the expression of GPC-4 on the protein level, polyclonal antibodies 
against selected peptides were raised in rabbits. Western blot analysis showed 
expression of GPC-4 as a heparan sulphate proteoglycan in the human 
haematopoietic-progenitor cell line TF-1 and normal human bone marrow. These 
results were confirmed by FACS analysis of TF-1 cells. Furthermore, 
GPC-4-positive progenitor cells and stromal cells were enriched from normal 
human bone marrow by magnetic-cell sorting and analysed by confocal 
laser-scanning microscopy.
