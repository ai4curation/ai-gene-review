Specific transcripts for bile salt-dependent lipase (BSDL), a 100-kDa 
glycoprotein secreted by the human pancreas, were immunodetected in BxPC-3 and 
SOJ-6 pancreatic tumoral cell lines. Sequencing of fragments, obtained by mRNA 
reverse transcription and amplification, confirmed the presence of BSDL 
transcripts in these cancer cells. The protein was detected in lysates of 
pancreatic tumoral cells, where it was mainly associated with membranes. Only a 
minute amount of the enzyme was detected in the culture media. 
Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that in SOJ-6 cells, BSDL colocates with 
the p58 Golgi protein and suggested that the protein may be sequestrated within 
the Golgi compartment. These results demonstrated that BSDL is expressed in 
human pancreatic tumoral cells and cannot be secreted (or for the least very 
poorly). Subsequently, a cDNA covering the entire sequence of BSDL was obtained 
by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The sequence of this cDNA 
indicated that the N-terminal domain encoded by exons 1-10 was identical to that 
of BSDL expressed by the human normal pancreas. However, the sequence 
corresponding to exon 11, which should code for the 16 tandem-repeated identical 
mucin-like sequences of BSDL, was deleted by 330 base pairs (bp) and encoded 
only 6 of these repeated sequences. We conclude that this truncated variant of 
BSDL would be its oncofetal form, referred to as feto-acinar pancreatic protein. 
We then investigated whether the deletion of 330 bp affected the secretion of 
the protein. For this purpose, the cDNA corresponding to the mature form of the 
BSDL variant expressed in SOJ-6 cells was cloned into an expression/secretion 
vector and transfected into CHO-K1 cells. Results indicated that the variant of 
BSDL isolated from SOJ-6 cells was expressed and secreted by transfected cells. 
However, the level of BSDL secreted by these transfected CHO-K1 cells was 
significantly higher than that observed for SOJ-6 cells. Consequently, the 
retention of the oncofetal variant of BSDL observed in human pancreatic tumoral 
cells might not result from inherent properties of the protein.
