Neural stem cells (NSCs) have the ability to exit quiescence and reactivate in 
response to physiological stimuli. In the Drosophila brain, insulin receptor 
(InR)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway triggers NSC 
reactivation. However, intrinsic mechanisms that control the InR/PI3K/Akt 
pathway during reactivation remain unknown. Here, we have identified heat shock 
protein 83 (Hsp83/Hsp90), a molecular chaperone, as an intrinsic regulator of 
NSC reactivation. Hsp83 is both necessary and sufficient for NSC reactivation by 
promoting the activation of InR pathway in larval brains in the presence of 
dietary amino acids. Both Hsp83 and its co-chaperone Cdc37 physically associate 
with InR. Finally, reactivation defects observed in brains depleted of hsp83 
were rescued by over-activation of the InR/PI3K/Akt pathway, suggesting that 
Hsp83 functions upstream of the InR/PI3K/Akt pathway during NSC reactivation. 
Given the conservation of Hsp83 and the InR pathway, our finding may provide 
insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying mammalian NSC reactivation.
