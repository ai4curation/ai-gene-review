Sorting endosomes and the endocytic recycling compartment are critical 
intracellular stores for the rapid recycling of internalized membrane receptors 
to the cell surface in multiple cell types. However, the molecular mechanisms 
distinguishing fast receptor recycling from sorting endosomes and slow receptor 
recycling from the endocytic recycling compartment remain poorly understood. We 
previously reported that Rab15 differentially regulates transferrin receptor 
trafficking through sorting endosomes and the endocytic recycling compartment, 
suggesting a role for distinct Rab15-effector interactions at these endocytic 
compartments. In this study, we identified the novel protein Rab15 effector 
protein (REP15) as a binding partner for Rab15-GTP. REP15 is compartment 
specific, colocalizing with Rab15 and Rab11 on the endocytic recycling 
compartment but not with Rab15, Rab4, or early endosome antigen 1 on sorting 
endosomes. REP15 interacts directly with Rab15-GTP but not with Rab5 or Rab11. 
Consistent with its localization, REP15 overexpression and small interfering 
RNA-mediated depletion inhibited transferrin receptor recycling from the 
endocytic recycling compartment, without affecting receptor entry into or 
recycling from sorting endosomes. Our data identify REP15 as a 
compartment-specific protein for receptor recycling from the endocytic recycling 
compartment, highlighting that the rapid and slow modes of transferrin receptor 
recycling are mechanistically distinct pathways.
