MicroRNAs (miRNAs) associate with Argonaute (AGO) proteins to direct widespread 
posttranscriptional gene repression. Although association with AGO typically 
protects miRNAs from nucleases, extensive pairing to some unusual target RNAs 
can trigger miRNA degradation. We found that this target-directed miRNA 
degradation (TDMD) required the ZSWIM8 Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. This and 
other findings support a mechanistic model of TDMD in which target-directed 
proteolysis of AGO by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway exposes the miRNA for 
degradation. Moreover, loss-of-function studies indicated that the ZSWIM8 
Cullin-RING ligase accelerates degradation of numerous miRNAs in cells of 
mammals, flies, and nematodes, thereby specifying the half-lives of most 
short-lived miRNAs. These results elucidate the mechanism of TDMD and expand its 
inferred role in shaping miRNA levels in bilaterian animals.
