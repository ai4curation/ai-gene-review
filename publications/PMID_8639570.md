We report that recombinant glia maturation factor (GMF), a 17-kDa brain protein, 
inhibits the activity of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in the test tube 
assay, in particular the ERK1/ERK2 isoforms. A preliminary phosphorylation of 
GMF by protein kinase A (PKA) dramatically increases its inhibitory effect by 
over 600-fold (Ki approximately 3 nM), making it the most potent MAP kinase 
inhibitor ever reported. Immunoprecipitation of GMF from cell extracts using its 
specific antibody coprecipitates ERK (and vice versa), suggesting the 
association of the two proteins in the cell. The inhibitory effect of 
PKA-phosphorylated GMF is specific, as it does not suppress the activity of cdc2 
kinase, another proline-directed kinase. Nor does it inhibit MAP kinase kinase 
(MEK) and MAP kinase-activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase-2, the two enzymes 
immediately upstream and downstream, respectively, of ERK. Of the other three 
enzymes that can phosphorylate GMF, only p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) enhances 
the inhibitory function of GMF on ERK; protein kinase C (PKC) and casein kinase 
II (CKII) are without effect. The inhibition of ERK by PKA-phosphorylated GMF 
suggests that GMF could be one of the mediators of the suppressive effect of the 
PKA pathway on the MAP kinase pathway. On the other hand, that 
RSK-phosphorylated GMF also inhibits ERK implies a negative feedback loop in the 
regulation of MAP kinase activity.
