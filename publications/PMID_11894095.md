Cbl is a multi-adaptor protein involved in ligand-induced downregulation of 
receptor tyrosine kinases. It is thought that Cbl-mediated ubiquitination of 
active receptors is essential for receptor degradation and cessation of 
receptor-induced signal transduction. Here we demonstrate that Cbl additionally 
regulates epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor endocytosis. Cbl rapidly 
recruits CIN85 (Cbl-interacting protein of 85K; ref. 6) and endophilins 
(regulatory components of clathrin-coated vesicles) to form a complex with 
activated EGF receptors, thus controlling receptor internalization. CIN85 was 
constitutively associated with endophilins, whereas CIN85 binding to the distal 
carboxy terminus of Cbl was increased on EGF stimulation. Inhibition of these 
interactions was sufficient to block EGF receptor internalization, delay 
receptor degradation and enhance EGF-induced gene transcription, without 
perturbing Cbl-directed receptor ubiquitination. Thus, the evolutionary 
divergent C terminus of Cbl uses a mechanism that is functionally separable from 
the ubiquitin ligase activity of Cbl to mediate ligand-dependent downregulation 
of receptor tyrosine kinases.
