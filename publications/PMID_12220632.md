Membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a key enzyme in cell 
locomotion, is known to be primarily recruited to the leading edge of migrating 
cells. This raises a possibility that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP 
interacts with intracellular regulatory proteins, which modulate translocations 
of the protease across the cell. Here, we demonstrated that MT1-MMP via its 
cytoplasmic tail directly associates with a chaperone-like compartment-specific 
regulator gC1qR. Although a direct functional link between these two proteins 
remains uncertain, our observations suggest that the transient associations of 
gC1qR with the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP are likely to be involved in the 
mechanisms regulating presentation of the protease at the tumor cell surface.
