Analysis of brain microtubule protein from patients with Alzheimer's disease 
showed decreased alpha tubulin levels along with increased acetylation of the 
alpha tubulin subunit, mainly in those microtubules from neurons containing 
neurofibrillary tau pathology. To determine the relationship of tau protein and 
increased tubulin acetylation, we studied the effect of tau on the 
acetylation-deacetylation of tubulin. Our results indicate that tau binds to the 
tubulin-deacetylase, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), decreasing its activity with 
a consequent increase in tubulin acetylation. As expected, increased acetylation 
was also found in tubulin from wild-type mice compared with tubulin from mice 
lacking tau because of the tau-mediated inhibition of the deacetylase. In 
addition, we found that an excess of tau protein, as a HDAC6 inhibitor, prevents 
induction of autophagy by inhibiting proteasome function.
