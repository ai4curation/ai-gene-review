BEST1 is highly and preferentially expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium 
(RPE) and causes Best macular dystrophy when mutated. We previously demonstrated 
that the human BEST1 upstream region -154 to +38 bp is sufficient to direct 
expression in the RPE of transgenic mice, and microphthalmia-associated 
transcription factor (MITF) and OTX2 regulate this BEST1 promoter. However, a 
number of questions remained. Here, we show that yeast one-hybrid screen with 
bait corresponding to BEST1 -120 to -88 bp identified the SOX-E factors, SOX8, 
SOX9, and SOX10. A paired SOX site was found in this bait, and mutation of 
either of the paired sites significantly decreased BEST1 promoter activity in 
RPE primary cultures. Among the SOX-E genes, SOX9 is highly and preferentially 
expressed in the RPE, and chromatin immunoprecipitation with fresh RPE cells 
revealed binding of SOX9, but not SOX10, to the BEST1 region where the paired 
SOX site is located. BEST1 promoter activity was increased by SOX9 
overexpression and decreased by siRNA-mediated SOX9 knockdown. Importantly, SOX9 
physically interacted with MITF and OTX2 and orchestrated synergistic activation 
of the BEST1 promoter with the paired SOX site playing essential roles. A 
combination of the expression patterns of SOX9, MITF, and OTX2 yielded tissue 
distribution remarkably similar to that of BEST1. Lastly, the BEST1 promoter was 
also active in Sertoli cells of the testis in transgenic mice where SOX9 is 
highly expressed. These results define SOX9 as a key regulator of BEST1 
expression and demonstrate for the first time its functional role in the RPE.
