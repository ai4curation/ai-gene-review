Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare, developmental disorder characterized by 
six major symptoms: rod-cone dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, renal 
abnormalities, learning difficulties, and hypogonadism. Secondary features 
include cardiac and hepatic anomalies, metabolic disturbancies, and hearing 
loss. BBS is genetically heterogeneous with 12 disease genes (BBS1-BBS12) 
described thus far. Current data suggest a functional disturbance in ciliary 
function and intraflagellar transport being associated with the phenotype. 
However, the precise functions of the BBS proteins have yet to be elucidated. 
This study focuses on the detection of protein factors interacting with BBS 
proteins. Applying yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) technology we found a series of novel, 
functionally potentially plausible binding partners of BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, and 
BBS7. Protein interactions were supported by coimmunoprecipitation analyses 
(ALDOB, EPAS1) and substantiated by colocalization studies at the subcellular 
level (ALDOB, EXOC7, FLOT1, KRT18, PAX2). Our work provides new insights into 
the understanding of BBS interactions and thus their biological function.
