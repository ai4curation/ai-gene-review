Aberrant regulation of rRNA synthesis and translation control can facilitate 
tumorigenesis. The ErbB2 growth factor receptor is overexpressed in many human 
tumors and has been detected in the nucleus, but the role of nuclear ErbB2 is 
obscure. In this study, we defined a novel function of nuclear ErbB2 in 
enhancing rRNA gene transcription by RNA polymerase-I (RNA Pol I). Nuclear ErbB2 
physically associates with β-actin and RNA Pol I, coinciding with active RNA Pol 
I transcription sites in nucleoli. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of ErbB2 
reduced pre-rRNA and protein synthesis. In contrast, wild-type ErbB2 augmented 
pre-rRNA level, protein production, and cell size/cell growth, but not by an 
ErbB2 mutant that is defective in nuclear translocation. Chromatin 
immunoprecipitation assays revealed that ErbB2 enhances binding of RNA Pol I to 
rDNA. In addition, ErbB2 associated with rDNA, RNA Pol I, and β-actin, 
suggesting how it could stimulate rRNA production, protein synthesis, and 
increased cell size and cell growth. Finally, ErbB2-potentiated RNA Pol I 
transcription could be stimulated by ligand and was not substantially repressed 
by inhibition of PI3-K and MEK/ERK (extracellular signal regulated kinase), the 
main ErbB2 effector signaling pathways. Together, our findings indicate that 
nuclear ErbB2 functions as a regulator of rRNA synthesis and cellular 
translation, which may contribute to tumor development and progression.

Abstract

Aberrant regulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis and translation control can facilitate tumorigenesis. The ErbB2 growth factor receptor is overexpressed in many human tumors and has been detected in the nucleus, but the role of nuclear ErbB2 is obscure. In this study, we defined a novel function of nuclear ErbB2 in enhancing rRNA gene transcription by RNA polymerase-I (RNA Pol I). Nuclear ErbB2 physically associates with β-actin and RNA Pol I, coinciding with active RNA Pol I transcription sites in nucleoli. RNAi-mediated knockdown of ErbB2 reduced pre-rRNA and protein synthesis. In contrast, wild-type ErbB2 augmented pre-rRNA level, protein production and cell size/cell growth, but not by an ErbB2 mutant which is defective in nuclear translocation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that ErbB2 enhances binding of RNA Pol I to rDNA. Additionally, ErbB2 associated with rDNA, RNA Pol I and β-actin, suggesting how it could stimulate rRNA production, protein synthesis and increased cell size and cell growth. Lastly, ErbB2-potentiated RNA Pol I transcription could be stimulated by ligand and was not substantially repressed by inhibition of PI3-K and MEK/ERK, the main ErbB2 effector signaling pathways. Together, our findings indicate that nuclear ErbB2 functions as a regulator of rRNA synthesis and cellular translation, which may contribute to tumor development and progression.

Introduction

Recent studies have made significant advances in understanding the role of translation control in cancer formation. rRNA production by RNA Pol I, the key component of ribosome biogenesis, is the rate-limiting step for translation/protein synthesis and cell growth. Augmented expression of rRNA is potentially accompanied by the increased protein synthesis and thereby cell growth, which can hasten tumor development. Indeed, it has been reported that rRNA and protein synthesis are elevated in wide varieties of human cancers ( 1 – 5 ). Growing evidence also indicates that many oncoproteins and tumor suppressor proteins can contribute to tumorigenesis through regulation of the activities or the expression level of the elements of the translation apparatus ( 1 – 10 ). Thus, the factors of translation machinery have emerged as potential targets for development of novel anti-cancer therapeutics ( 5 , 11 ).

ErbB-2 (also termed as HER2 or neu) belongs to the cell-surface ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, of which its best-known function is to convey the extra-cellular stimuli and to activate downstream signaling cascades, such as the MAP kinase pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway, the phospholipase C pathway, and the STATs pathway, leading to specific cellular responses, including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, survival and differentiation ( 12 ). Overexpression of ErbB-2 has been detected in many human tumors including breast cancer and shown to correlate with more malignant tumor characteristics, such as enhanced metastasis and poor clinical prognosis in breast cancer patients. Thus, ErbB-2 has been used as a prominent target for cancer therapeutic intervention ( 12 , 13 ). In addition to traditional signaling pathways, compelling evidence shows that RTKs, comprising ErbB family, are present in the nucleus ( 12 – 17 ). The correlation of nuclear RTKs with poor patient survival, tumor grade and pathologic stage has been observed in multiple cancer types by different groups ( 15 , 18 – 25 ). This evidence further highlights the important insights that nuclear RTKs potentially play more aggressive roles during tumor progression. Although it has been known that nuclear RTKs associate with functions in RNA polymerase II transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and DNA replication ( 12 – 16 , 20 , 26 – 32 ), the biological significance and functions of the nuclear RTKs, including ErbB-2, is still far from clear. Our study described herein identified a novel function of nuclear ErbB-2 in enhancing cellular translation, and thereby cell growth, which may contribute to tumorigenesis.

Discussion

Deregulation of translational control can promote cellular transformation. Protein synthesis and the expression of components of the translation machinery are elevated in cancers and contribute to tumorigenesis ( 1 – 5 , 7 ). Here we demonstrate that nuclear ErbB-2 promotes binding of RNA Pol I to rDNA, co-occupies the rRNA gene with β-actin and RNA Pol I, and stimulates rRNA production and protein translation independently of traditional ErbB-2 downstream PI3-K and ERK signalings, suggesting that nuclear ErbB-2 may contribute to oncogenesis by upregulating total cellular translation. rRNA synthesis by RNA Pol I plays a critical role in production of mature ribosomes that are central protein synthesis machinery of the cells. Perturbation of RNA Pol I activity as well as rRNA and protein biosynthesis (i.e. translation control) by oncoproteins such as Myc or tumor suppressors p53, RB and ARF has been reported to be associated with tumor development ( 1 , 2 , 7 – 10 ). The capability of Myc to increase protein synthesis is necessary for its oncogenic activity ( 7 ). In support of this notion, our findings also manifest the importance of nuclear ErbB-2-coordinated rRNA and protein synthesis to tumor biology. In addition, since ErbB2 is known to activate both the MAPK and PI3-K pathways, and inhibitors of both pathways (such as AZD6244 and MK2206) have been tested in clinical trials, our current report show that nuclear ErbB2-potentiated RNA Pol I transcription was not suppressed by inhibition of PI3-K and MEK/ERK, raising the interesting possibility of whether ErbB2 mediated rRNA transcription might contribute to acquired resistance to clinically used inhibitors of the MAPK and PI3-K pathways.

It is worth mentioning that β-actin, which is originally considered as a cytoplasm protein, also exists in the nucleus and has been shown to be involved in diverse nuclear activities including RNA Pol I transcription ( 34 ). Our results show that knocking down β-actin using siRNA impairs association between ErbB-2/RNA Pol I and reduces the level of ErbB-2 binding to rRNA gene. Whereas inhibition of RNA Pol I transcription using actinomycin D, which impedes Pol I transcription by reduced binding of Pol I to DNA, decreases the rRNA gene occupancy of ErbB-2 and RNA Pol I, but exerts no impact on β-actin binding to rDNA ( Fig. 4E ), which is consistent with a previous study showing that association of β-actin with rDNA does not require ongoing transcription ( 41 ). These findings suggest that β-actin is necessary but not sufficient for rDNA association of ErbB-2, which also depends on active RNA Pol I transcription. Furthermore, ErbB-2, similar to RNA Pol I and β-actin ( 34 ), occupies both the rDNA promoter and 28S rRNA coding region, implying ErbB-2 may play a role both in early and later stages (likely elongation) of transcription. It should be mentioned that ErbB-2 is a tyrosine kinase and the β-actin/RNA Pol I complex contains multiple proteins, it will be interesting to further pursue whether ErbB-2 might phosphorylate some components of the β-actin/RNA Pol I complex to affect RNA Pol I transcriptional activity.

Thus, based on our results, we propose a model ( Fig. 7 ) hypothesizing that ErbB-2 enhances binding of RNA Pol I to rDNA and co-occupies rDNA together with β-actin and RNA Pol I, progressing along with these factors in early and elongation steps of transcription, expediting rRNA synthesis and protein translation, and thereby promoting cell growth and tumorigenesis. To the best of our knowledge, our discovery for the first time links the nuclear ErbB-2 to a novel function in regulating cellular translation and provides insights into the possible mechanism by which nuclear ErbB-2 modulates tumor development through enhancing protein translation.
