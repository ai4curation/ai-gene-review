Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated in the context of chromatin. Dynamic 
changes in post-translational histone modification are thought to play key roles 
in fundamental cellular functions such as regulation of the cell cycle, 
development, and differentiation. To elucidate the relationship between histone 
modifications and cellular functions, it is important to monitor the dynamics of 
modifications in single living cells. A genetically encoded probe called 
mintbody (modification-specific intracellular antibody), which is a single-chain 
variable fragment tagged with a fluorescent protein, has been proposed as a 
useful visualization tool. However, the efficacy of intracellular expression of 
antibody fragments has been limited, in part due to different environmental 
conditions in the cytoplasm compared to the endoplasmic reticulum where secreted 
proteins such as antibodies are folded. In this study, we have developed a new 
mintbody specific for histone H4 Lys20 monomethylation (H4K20me1). The 
specificity of the H4K20me1-mintbody in living cells was verified using yeast 
mutants and mammalian cells in which this target modification was diminished. 
Expression of the H4K20me1-mintbody allowed us to monitor the oscillation of 
H4K20me1 levels during the cell cycle. Moreover, dosage-compensated X 
chromosomes were visualized using the H4K20me1-mintbody in mouse and nematode 
cells. Using X-ray crystallography and mutational analyses, we identified 
critical amino acids that contributed to stabilization and/or proper folding of 
the mintbody. Taken together, these data provide important implications for 
future studies aimed at developing functional intracellular antibodies. 
Specifically, the H4K20me1-mintbody provides a powerful tool to track this 
particular histone modification in living cells and organisms.
