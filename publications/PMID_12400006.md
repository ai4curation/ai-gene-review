The pEg3 protein is a member of the evolutionarily conserved KIN1/PAR-1/MARK 
kinase family which is involved in cell polarity and microtubule dynamics. In 
Xenopus, pEg3 has been shown to be a cell cycle dependent kinase whose activity 
increases to a maximum level during mitosis of the first embryonic cell 
division. CDC25B is one of the three CDC25 phosphatase genes identified in 
human. It is thought to regulate the G2/M progression by dephosphorylating and 
activating the CDK/cyclin complexes. In the present study we show that the human 
pEg3 kinase is able to specifically phosphorylate CDC25B in vitro. One 
phosphorylation site was identified and corresponded to serine 323. This residue 
is equivalent to serine 216 in human CDC25C which plays an important role in the 
regulation of phosphatase during the cell cycle and at the G2 checkpoint. pEg3 
is also able to specifically associate with CDC25B in vitro and in vivo. We show 
that the ectopic expression of active pEg3 in human U2OS cells induces an 
accumulation of cells in G2. This effect is counteracted by overexpression of 
CDC25B. Taken together these results suggest that pEg3 is a potential regulator 
of the G2/M progression and may act antagonistically to the CDC25B phosphatase.
