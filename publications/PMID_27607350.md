Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is a highly conserved 
housekeeping protein present in eukaryotic organisms. It is involved in 
regulating many fundamental processes and plays a critical role in tumor 
reversion and tumorigenesis. Increasing evidence suggests that TCTP plays a role 
in the regulation of cell fate determination and is a promising therapeutic 
target for cancer. To decipher the exact mechanisms by which TCTP functions and 
how all these functions are integrated, we analyzed the interactome of TCTP in 
HeLa cells by coimmunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectrometry (MS). A total of 
98 proteins were identified. We confirmed the in vitro and in vivo association 
of TCTP with six of the identified binding proteins using reciprocal IP and 
bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis, respectively. 
Moreover, TCTP interacted with Y-box-binding protein 1 (YBX1), and their 
interaction was localized to the N-terminal region of TCTP and the 1-129 amino 
acid (aa) residues of YBX1. The YBX1 protein plays an important role in cell 
proliferation, RNA splicing, DNA repair, drug resistance, and stress response to 
extracellular signals. These data suggest that the interaction of TCTP with YBX1 
might cooperate or coordinate their functions in the control of diverse 
regulatory pathways in cancer cells. Taken together, our results not only reveal 
a large number of TCTP-associated proteins that possess pleiotropic functions, 
but also provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of TCTP in 
tumorigenesis.
