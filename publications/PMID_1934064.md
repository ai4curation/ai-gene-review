Cytolytic lymphocytes (CTLs) are characterized by their inclusion of cytoplasmic 
granules containing effector molecules such as perforin and the serine 
proteases. Here we describe the cDNA cloning and functional characterization of 
two related isoforms of a cytolytic granule protein designated TIA-1. Sequence 
analysis reveals that the 40 kd TIA-1 isoform (rp40-TIA-1) is structurally 
related to the poly(A)-binding proteins, possessing three RNA-binding domains 
and a carboxy-terminal, glutamine-rich auxiliary domain. The 15 kd TIA-1 
isoform, the major species present in cytolytic granules, appears to be derived 
from the carboxy-terminal auxiliary domain of rp40-TIA-1 by proteolytic 
processing. Both natural and recombinant TIA-1 were found to induce DNA 
fragmentation in digitonin permeabilized thymocytes, suggesting that these 
molecules may be the granule components responsible for inducing apoptosis in 
CTL targets.
