Using an expression cloning technique, we isolated cDNAs for eight M phase 
phosphoproteins (MPPs 4-11). We then used affinity-purified antibodies to fusion 
proteins to characterize the intracellular localization and some biochemical 
properties of these proteins and two others that we identified previously (MPPs 
1-2). Each antibody immunoprecipitated one or two protein species of a 
characteristic size ranging from 17,000 to 220,000 Da. Each MPP, when 
immunoprecipitated from lysates of M phase cells, was reactive with MPM2, a 
monoclonal antibody that recognizes a group of related M phase phosphorylation 
sites, including F-phosphoT-P-L-Q. This reactivity indicated that all the MPPS 
encoded genuine M phase phosphoproteins. When antibodies to the MPPS were used 
for immunofluorescence microscopy, each anti-MPP gave a characteristic pattern 
of localization. In interphase, several of the MPPs were nuclear proteins, 
whereas others were cytoplasmic or distributed throughout the cell. Three MPPS 
were strikingly localized to interphase structures: MPP7 to centers of DNA 
replication, MPP9 to the Golgi complex, and MPP10 to nucleoli. In mitosis, most 
of the MPPs were distributed throughout the cells. Further studies of the 10 
MPPs, most of which are previously undescribed, are expected to provide new 
understandings of the process of cell division.
