The microtubule, F-actin and neurofilament networks play a critical role in 
neuronal cell morphogenesis, polarity and synaptic plasticity. Significantly, 
the assembly/disassembly and stability of these cytoskeletal networks is 
crucially modulated by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. 
Herein, we aim to more closely examine the role played by three major neuronal 
Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, PP2A, PP1 and calcineurin, in the homeostasis of 
the neuronal cytoskeleton. There is strong evidence that these enzymes interact 
with and dephosphorylate a variety of cytoskeletal proteins, resulting in major 
regulation of neuronal cytoskeletal dynamics. Conversely, we also discuss how 
multi-protein cytoskeletal scaffolds can also influence the regulation of these 
phosphatases, with important implications for neuronal signalling and 
homeostasis. Not surprisingly, deregulation of these cytoskeletal scaffolds and 
phosphatase dysfunction are associated with many neurological diseases.
