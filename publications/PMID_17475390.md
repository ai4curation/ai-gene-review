Sphingolipids are degraded by sphingomyelinase and ceramidase in the gut to 
ceramide and sphingosine, which may inhibit cell proliferation and induce 
apoptosis, and thus have anti-tumour effects in the gut. Although previous 
rodent studies including experiments on knockout mice indicate a role of neutral 
ceramidase in ceramide digestion, the human enzyme has never been purified and 
characterized in its purified form. We here report the purification and 
characterization of neutral ceramidase from human ileostomy content, using 
octanoyl-[(14)C]sphingosine as substrate. After four chromatographic steps, a 
homogeneous protein band with 116kDa was obtained. MALDI mass spectrometry 
identified 16 peptide masses similar to human ceramidase previously cloned by El 
Bawab et al. [Molecular cloning and characterization of a human mitochondrial 
ceramidase, J. Biol. Chem. 275 (2000) 21508-21513] and Hwang et al. [Subcellular 
localization of human neutral ceramidase expressed in HEK293 cells, Biochem. 
Biophys. Res. Commun. 331 (2005) 37-42]. By RT-PCR and 5'-RACE methods, a 
predicted partial nucleotide sequence of neutral ceramidase was obtained from a 
human duodenum biopsy sample, which was homologous to that of known 
neutral/alkaline ceramidases. The enzyme has neutral pH optimum and catalyses 
both hydrolysis and formation of ceramide without distinct bile salt dependence. 
It is inhibited by Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) ions and by low concentrations of 
cholesterol. The enzyme is a glycoprotein but deglycosylation does not affect 
its activity. Our study indicates that neutral ceramidase is expressed in human 
intestine, released in the intestinal lumen and plays a major role in ceramide 
metabolism in the human gut.
