We have studied the folding pathway of a beta-barrel membrane protein using 
outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of Escherichia coli as an example. The deletion 
of the gene of periplasmic Skp impairs the assembly of outer membrane proteins 
of bacteria. We investigated how Skp facilitates the insertion and folding of 
completely unfolded OmpA into phospholipid membranes and which are the 
biochemical and biophysical requirements of a possible Skp-assisted folding 
pathway. In refolding experiments, Skp alone was not sufficient to facilitate 
membrane insertion and folding of OmpA. In addition, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
was required. OmpA remained unfolded when bound to Skp and LPS in solution. From 
this complex, OmpA folded spontaneously into lipid bilayers as determined by 
electrophoretic mobility measurements, fluorescence spectroscopy, and circular 
dichroism spectroscopy. The folding of OmpA into lipid bilayers was inhibited 
when one of the periplasmic components, either Skp or LPS, was absent. Membrane 
insertion and folding of OmpA was most efficient at specific molar ratios of 
OmpA, Skp, and LPS. Unfolded OmpA in complex with Skp and LPS folded faster into 
phospholipid bilayers than urea-unfolded OmpA. Together, these results describe 
a first assisted folding pathway of an integral membrane protein on the example 
of OmpA.
