To understand the tumor-suppressing mechanism of the SWI/SNF chromatin 
remodeling complex, we investigated its molecular relationship with p53. Using 
the pREP4-luc episomal reporter, we first demonstrated that p53 utilizes the 
chromatin remodeling activity of the SWI/SNF complex to initiate transcription 
from the chromatin-structured promoter. Among the components of the SWI/SNF 
complex, we identified BAF60a as a mediator of the interaction with p53 by the 
yeast two-hybrid assay. p53 directly interacted only with BAF60a, but not with 
other components of the SWI/SNF complex, such as BRG1, SRG3, SNF5, or BAF57. We 
found out that multiple residues at the amino acid 108-150 region of BAF60a were 
involved in the interaction with the tetramerization domain of p53. The 
N-terminal fragment of BAF60a containing the p53-interacting region as well as 
small interfering RNA for baf60a inhibited the SWI/SNF complex-mediated 
transcriptional activity of p53. The uncoupling of p53 with the SWI/SNF complex 
resulted in the repression of both p53-dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest 
by the regulation of target genes. These results suggest that the SWI/SNF 
chromatin remodeling complex is involved in the suppression of tumors by the 
interaction with p53.
