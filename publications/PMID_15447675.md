Alzheimer's disease is characterised by the accumulation of amyloid-beta 
peptide, which is cleaved from the copper-binding amyloid-beta precursor 
protein. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have illustrated the importance of 
copper in Alzheimer's disease neuropathogenesis and suggested a role for 
amyloid-beta precursor protein and amyloid-beta in copper homeostasis. 
Amyloid-beta precursor protein is a member of a multigene family, including 
amyloid precursor-like proteins-1 and -2. The copper-binding domain is similar 
among amyloid-beta precursor protein family members, suggesting an overall 
conservation in its function or activity. Here, we demonstrate that double 
knockout of amyloid-beta precursor protein and amyloid precursor-like protein-2 
expression results in significant increases in copper accumulation in mouse 
primary cortical neurons and embryonic fibroblasts. In contrast, over-expression 
of amyloid-beta precursor protein in transgenic mice results in significantly 
reduced copper levels in primary cortical neurons. These findings provide 
cellular neuronal evidence for the role of amyloid-beta precursor protein in 
copper homeostasis and support the existing hypothesis that amyloid-beta 
precursor protein and amyloid precursor-like protein-2 are copper-binding 
proteins with functionally interchangeable roles in copper homeostasis.
