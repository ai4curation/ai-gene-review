Transcription factor activating enhancer-binding protein 4 (AP-4) is a basic 
helix-loop-helix protein that binds to E-box elements. AP-4 has received 
increasing attention for its regulatory role in cell growth and development, 
including transcriptional repression of the human homolog of murine double 
minute 2 (HDM2), an important oncoprotein controlling cell growth and survival, 
by an unknown mechanism. Here we demonstrate that AP-4 binds to an E-box located 
in the HDM2-P2 promoter and represses HDM2 transcription in a p53-independent 
manner. Incremental truncations of AP-4 revealed that the C-terminal 
Gln/Pro-rich domain was essential for transcriptional repression of HDM2. To 
further delineate the molecular mechanism(s) of AP-4 transcriptional control and 
its potential implications, we used DNA-affinity purification followed by 
complementary quantitative proteomics, cICAT and iTRAQ labeling methods, to 
identify a previously unknown E-box-bound AP-4 protein complex containing 75 
putative components. The two labeling methods complementarily quantified 
differentially AP-4-enriched proteins, including the most significant 
recruitment of DNA damage response proteins, followed by transcription factors, 
transcriptional repressors/corepressors, and histone-modifying proteins. 
Specific interaction of AP-4 with CCCTC binding factor, stimulatory protein 1, 
and histone deacetylase 1 (an AP-4 corepressor) was validated using AP-4 
truncation mutants. Importantly, inclusion of trichostatin A did not alleviate 
AP-4-mediated repression of HDM2 transcription, suggesting a previously 
unidentified histone deacetylase-independent repression mechanism. In contrast, 
the complementary quantitative proteomics study suggested that transcription 
repression occurs via coordination of AP-4 with other transcription factors, 
histone methyltransferases, and/or a nucleosome remodeling SWI.SNF complex. In 
addition to previously known functions of AP-4, our data suggest that AP-4 
participates in a transcriptional-regulating complex at the HDM2-P2 promoter in 
response to DNA damage.

Abstract

Transcription factor activating enhancer-binding protein 4 (AP-4) is a basic helix-loop-helix protein that binds to E-box elements. AP-4 has received increasing attention for its regulatory role in cell growth and development, including transcriptional repression of the human homolog of murine double minute 2 (HDM2), an important oncoprotein controlling cell growth and survival, by an unknown mechanism. Here we demonstrate that AP-4 binds to an E-box located in the HDM2 -P2 promoter and represses HDM2 transcription in a p53-independent manner. Incremental truncations of AP-4 revealed that the C-terminal Gln/Pro-rich domain was essential for transcriptional repression of HDM2 . To further delineate the molecular mechanism(s) of AP-4 transcriptional control and its potential implications, we used DNA-affinity purification followed by complementary quantitative proteomics, cICAT and iTRAQ labeling methods, to identify a previously unknown E-box-bound AP-4 protein complex containing 75 putative components. The two labeling methods complementarily quantified differentially AP-4-enriched proteins, including the most significant recruitment of DNA damage response proteins, followed by transcription factors, transcriptional repressors/corepressors, and histone-modifying proteins. Specific interaction of AP-4 with CCCTC binding factor, stimulatory protein 1, and histone deacetylase 1 (an AP-4 corepressor) was validated using AP-4 truncation mutants. Importantly, inclusion of trichostatin A did not alleviate AP-4-mediated repression of HDM2 transcription, suggesting a previously unidentified histone deacetylase-independent repression mechanism. In contrast, the complementary quantitative proteomics study suggested that transcription repression occurs via coordination of AP-4 with other transcription factors, histone methyltransferases, and/or a nucleosome remodeling SWIÂ·SNF complex. In addition to previously known functions of AP-4, our data suggest that AP-4 participates in a transcriptional-regulating complex at the HDM2 -P2 promoter in response to DNA damage.
