Adaptor protein 4 (AP-4) is the most recently discovered and least 
well-characterized member of the family of heterotetrameric adaptor protein (AP) 
complexes that mediate sorting of transmembrane cargo in post-Golgi 
compartments. Herein, we report the interaction of an YKFFE sequence from the 
cytosolic tail of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein (APP) with 
the mu4 subunit of AP-4. Biochemical and X-ray crystallographic analyses reveal 
that the properties of the APP sequence and the location of the binding site on 
mu4 are distinct from those of other signal-adaptor interactions. Disruption of 
the APP-AP-4 interaction decreases localization of APP to endosomes and enhances 
gamma-secretase-catalyzed cleavage of APP to the pathogenic amyloid-beta 
peptide. These findings demonstrate that APP and AP-4 engage in a distinct type 
of signal-adaptor interaction that mediates transport of APP from the 
trans-Golgi network (TGN) to endosomes, thereby reducing amyloidogenic 
processing of the protein.
