The 89-kDa STAT3 protein is a latent transcription factor which is activated in 
response to cytokines (interleukin (IL)-5 and -6) and growth factors (epidermal 
growth factor). Binding of IL-5 to its specific receptor activates JAK2 which 
leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 proteins. Here we report the 
cloning of a cDNA encoding a variant of the transcription factor STAT3 (named 
STAT3beta) which was isolated by screening an eosinophil cDNA library. Compared 
to wild-type STAT3, STAT3beta lacks an internal domain of 50 base pairs located 
near the C terminus. This splice product is a naturally occurring isoform of 
STAT3 and encodes a 80-kDa protein. We found by reconstitution of the human 
IL-5R in COS cells that like STAT3, STAT3beta is phosphorylated on tyrosine and 
binds to the pIRE from the ICAM-1 promoter after IL-5 stimulation. However, 
STAT3beta fails to activate a pIRE containing promoter in transient transfection 
assays. Instead, co-expression of STAT3beta inhibits the transactivation 
potential of STAT3. These results suggests that STAT3beta functions as a 
negative regulator of transcription.
