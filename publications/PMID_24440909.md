TNFα signaling can promote apoptosis or a regulated form of necrosis. ARC 
(apoptosis repressor with CARD (caspase recruitment domain)) is an endogenous 
inhibitor of apoptosis that antagonizes both the extrinsic (death receptor) and 
intrinsic (mitochondrial/ER) apoptosis pathways. We discovered that ARC blocks 
not only apoptosis but also necrosis. TNFα-induced necrosis was abrogated by 
overexpression of wild-type ARC but not by a CARD mutant that is also defective 
for inhibition of apoptosis. Conversely, knockdown of ARC exacerbated 
TNFα-induced necrosis, an effect that was rescued by reconstitution with 
wild-type, but not CARD-defective, ARC. Similarly, depletion of ARC in vivo 
exacerbated necrosis caused by infection with vaccinia virus, which elicits 
severe tissue damage through this pathway, and sensitized mice to TNFα-induced 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The mechanism underlying these effects 
is an interaction of ARC with TNF receptor 1 that interferes with recruitment of 
RIP1, a critical mediator of TNFα-induced regulated necrosis. These findings 
extend the role of ARC from an apoptosis inhibitor to a regulator of the TNFα 
pathway and an inhibitor of TNFα-mediated regulated necrosis.
