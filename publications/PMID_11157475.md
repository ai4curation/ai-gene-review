Stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1alpha and its receptor, CXCR4, play an 
important role in cell migration, embryonic development, and human 
immunodeficiency virus infection. However, the cellular signaling pathways that 
mediate these processes are not fully elucidated. We and others have shown that 
the binding of SDF-1alpha to CXCR4 activates phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3 
kinase), p44/42 mitogen-associated protein kinase, and the transcription factor 
nuclear factor-kappaB, and it also enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation and 
association of proteins involved in the formation of focal adhesions. In this 
study, we examined the role of phosphatases in CXCR4-mediated signaling 
pathways. We observed significant inhibition of SDF-1alpha-induced migration by 
phosphatase inhibitors in CXCR4-transfected pre-B lymphoma L1.2 cells, Jurkat T 
cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Further studies revealed that 
SDF-1alpha stimulation induced robust tyrosine phosphorylation in the 
SH2-containing phosphatase SHP2. SHP2 associated with the CXCR4 receptor and the 
signaling molecules SHIP, cbl, and fyn. Overexpression of wild-type SHP2 
increased SDF-1alpha-induced chemotaxis. Enhanced activation of fyn and lyn 
kinases and the tyrosine phosphorylation of cbl were also observed. In addition, 
SDF-1alpha stimulation enhanced the association of cbl with PI-3 kinase, Crk-L, 
and 14-3-3beta proteins. Our results suggest that CXCR4-mediated signaling is 
regulated by SHP2 and cbl, which collectively participate in the formation of a 
multimeric signaling complex.
