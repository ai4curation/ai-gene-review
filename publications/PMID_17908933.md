Integral beta-barrel proteins (OMPs) are a major class of outer membrane 
proteins in Gram-negative bacteria. In Escherichia coli, these proteins are 
synthesized in the cytoplasm, translocated across the inner membrane via the Sec 
machinery, and assembled in the outer membrane through an unknown mechanism that 
requires the outer membrane YaeT complex and the periplasmic chaperones SurA, 
DegP, and Skp. Here, we have established the relationship between these three 
chaperones providing insight into the mechanism of OMP biogenesis using 
depletion analysis. Depletion of SurA alone results in a marked decrease in 
outer membrane density, while the loss of DegP and Skp has no effect on outer 
membrane composition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SurA and YaeT interact 
directly in vivo. Based on these results, we suggest that SurA is the primary 
chaperone responsible for the periplasmic transit of the bulk mass of OMPs to 
the YaeT complex. The role of Skp and DegP is amplified in the absence of SurA. 
Evidence presented suggests that DegP/Skp function to rescue OMPs that fall off 
the SurA pathway. The seemingly redundant periplasmic chaperones do function in 
parallel, but the relative importance of the primary function of each pathway 
depends on whether or not cells are under stress.
