The biogenesis of secretory IgM occurs stepwise under stringent quality control, 
formation of micro(2)L(2) preceding polymerization. How is efficiency of IgM 
secretion coupled to fidelity? We show here that ERp44, a soluble protein 
involved in thiol-mediated retention, interacts with ERGIC-53. Binding to this 
hexameric lectin contributes to ERp44 localization in the ER-golgi intermediate 
compartment. ERp44 and ERGIC-53 increase during B-lymphocyte differentiation, 
concomitantly with the onset of IgM polymerization. Both preferentially bind 
micro(2)L(2) and higher order intermediates. Their overexpression or silencing 
in non-lymphoid cells promotes or decreases secretion of IgM polymers, 
respectively. In IgM-secreting B-lymphoma cells, micro chains interact first 
with BiP and later with ERp44 and ERGIC-53. Our findings suggest that ERGIC-53 
provides a platform that receives micro(2)L(2) subunits from the BiP-dependent 
checkpoint, assisting polymerization. In this process, ERp44 couples 
thiol-dependent assembly and quality control.

Abstract

The biogenesis of secretory IgM occurs stepwise under stringent quality control, formation of μ 2 L 2 preceding polymerization. How is efficiency of IgM secretion coupled to fidelity? We show here that ERp44, a soluble protein involved in thiol-mediated retention, interacts with ERGIC-53. Binding to this hexameric lectin contributes to ERp44 localization in the ER-golgi intermediate compartment. ERp44 and ERGIC-53 increase during B-lymphocyte differentiation, concomitantly with the onset of IgM polymerization. Both preferentially bind μ 2 L 2 and higher order intermediates. Their overexpression or silencing in non-lymphoid cells promotes or decreases secretion of IgM polymers, respectively. In IgM-secreting B-lymphoma cells, μ chains interact first with BiP and later with ERp44 and ERGIC-53. Our findings suggest that ERGIC-53 provides a platform that receives μ 2 L 2 subunits from the BiP-dependent checkpoint, assisting polymerization. In this process, ERp44 couples thiol-dependent assembly and quality control.

Introduction

Secreted and membrane proteins are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they fold and undergo several modifications (disulfide bond formation, N-glycan processing and subunit assembly) whose execution must be properly coordinated and timed. Quality control (QC) mechanisms are active at the ER–Golgi interface to ensure that non-native molecules are retained in, or retrieved to, the ER, and eventually dispatched to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation ( Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003 ; Sitia and Braakman, 2003 ). QC recognizes different features, common to unfolded or not completely assembled molecules, such as immature N-glycans ( Helenius and Aebi, 2004 ), hydrophobic patches ( Blond-Elguindi et al , 1993 ) or exposed reactive cysteines (thiol-mediated retention; Sitia et al , 1990 ; Fra et al , 1993 ; Reddy et al , 1996 ). We first isolated ERp44 for its ability of covalently binding the oxidases Ero1α and Ero1β ( Anelli et al , 2002 ), thus determining their intracellular localization ( Otsu et al , 2006 ). ERp44 plays a crucial role in QC, mediating via its Cys29 ( Anelli et al , 2003 ), the thiol-dependent retention of immunoglobulin (Ig) subunits (e.g., μ, L and J chains) and adiponectin ( Wang et al , 2007 ). ERp44 also regulates the activity of the calcium channel IP3R1 ( Higo et al , 2005 ), emerging as a possible integrator of redox and calcium homeostasis.

In addition to bulk flow ( Wieland et al , 1987 ), the exit of proteins from the ER is regulated by intracellular lectins, which concentrate certain glycoproteins in forward transport vesicles ( Hauri et al , 2002 ). Among these, ERGIC-53 is a hexameric transmembrane protein of the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) ( Schindler et al , 1993 ), which binds glycoproteins in the ER, transporting and releasing them in the Golgi ( Hauri et al , 2002 ). ERGIC-53 shuttles between the ER and the Golgi because it can bind both COPI and COPII through its KKFF cytosolic terminus ( Schindler et al , 1993 ; Vollenweider et al , 1998 ). Mutations in ERGIC-53 (also known as LMAN1) are responsible for most cases of combined deficiency of coagulation factor V and VIII (F5F8D), a recessive bleeding disorder caused by decreased blood levels of both clotting factors ( Nichols et al , 1998 ; Neerman-Arbez et al , 1999 ). This implies a role for ERGIC-53 in factors V and VIII ER–Golgi transport ( Vollenweider et al , 1998 ). Other F5F8D cases are linked to mutations in MCFD2 ( Zhang et al , 2003 ), a small soluble protein mediating ERGIC-53 binding to factor VIII ( Zhang et al , 2005 ). We recently demonstrated that ERGIC-53 binds mutant Ig-μ chains lacking the BiP-binding first constant domain (μΔCH1) ( Mattioli et al , 2006 ). This interaction favors formation of detergent-insoluble μΔCH1 aggregates, an event that requires Cys575-dependent polymerization ( Valetti et al , 1991 ).

IgM polymers are planar, multimeric proteins. They consist of 21 or 24 subunits, depending on whether they are secreted as J-chain containing ‘pentamers' ((μ 2 L 2 ) 5 -J) or ‘hexamers' ((μ 2 L 2 ) 6 ) (where μ and L stand for IgM heavy and light chains, respectively). In secreted polymers, individual μ 2 L 2 subunits (often called ‘monomers' in the immunological jargon) are assembled via disulfide bonds involving Cys575 in the C-terminal tailpiece of secretory μ (μ s ) chains ( Davis et al , 1989b ; Sitia et al , 1990 ). Cys575 acts also as a retention and degradation signal for unpolymerized secretory IgM (thiol-mediated retention; Fra et al , 1993 ; Reddy et al , 1996 ). In membrane μ (μ m ) chains, this 20-residue tailpiece is replaced by a longer hydrophobic segment, essential for membrane insertion and assembly with B-cell receptor signaling components.

The first assembly step (μ 2 L 2 formation), common to both membrane and secreted IgM, is fast and efficient in both B and plasma cells (PCs): its fidelity is checked by BiP (see Hendershot and Sitia, 2005 and references therein). In contrast, IgM polymerization is slow and occurs only in PCs. As a result, most μ s chains are degraded by proteasomes in B lymphocytes ( Shachar et al , 1992 ), whereas μ m chains that negotiated assembly into functional B-cell receptors are transported to the cell surface ( Sitia et al , 1987 ; Hombach et al , 1988 ).

Therefore, secretory IgM biogenesis occurs in at least two sequential and independently regulated steps, μ-L assembly preceding polymerization ( Hendershot and Sitia, 2005 ). We asked whether these two steps are executed in different subregions of the early secretory pathway, so as to optimize and couple assembly, QC and transport. We show that PDI and ERp44, two soluble proteins endowed with ER-localization motifs, are differentially distributed. Although PDI is localized in the ER, ERp44 accumulates in ERGIC and cis -Golgi vesicles. ERp44 and ERGIC-53 interact with each other and, together with MCFD2, are induced during B to PC differentiation. Both ERp44 and ERGIC-53 bind μ chains, preferentially if assembled with L chains. Their overexpression and silencing stimulate and decrease IgM polymerization in non-lymphoid cells, respectively. We propose that hexameric ERGIC-53 provides, with the help of MCFD2 and ERp44, a platform for IgM polymerization, receiving μ 2 L 2 subunits that have already passed the BiP-dependent checkpoint. By spatially segregating the sequential execution of μ 2 L 2 assembly and polymerization, IgM-secreting cells can couple assembly, transport and QC, ensuring efficiency and fidelity in the protein factory.

Discussion

The KDEL motif has long been thought as an ER localization device for soluble proteins. We show here a differential distribution of proteins endowed with such a motif, which reveals a further level of compartmentalization in the early secretory pathway: this could provide a novel mechanism that couples efficiency and fidelity in the IgM factory.
