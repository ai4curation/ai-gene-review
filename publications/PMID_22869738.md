We report the high-resolution (1.9 Å) crystal structure of oligomycin bound to 
the subunit c(10) ring of the yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase. Oligomycin binds 
to the surface of the c(10) ring making contact with two neighboring molecules 
at a position that explains the inhibitory effect on ATP synthesis. The carboxyl 
side chain of Glu59, which is essential for proton translocation, forms an 
H-bond with oligomycin via a bridging water molecule but is otherwise shielded 
from the aqueous environment. The remaining contacts between oligomycin and 
subunit c are primarily hydrophobic. The amino acid residues that form the 
oligomycin-binding site are 100% conserved between human and yeast but are 
widely different from those in bacterial homologs, thus explaining the 
differential sensitivity to oligomycin. Prior genetics studies suggest that the 
oligomycin-binding site overlaps with the binding site of other antibiotics, 
including those effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and thereby frames 
a common "drug-binding site." We anticipate that this drug-binding site will 
serve as an effective target for new antibiotics developed by rational design.
