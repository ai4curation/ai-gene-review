Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. GWAS have 
identified >50 genomic loci for CAD, including ADTRP and MIA3/TANGO1. However, 
it is important to determine whether the GWAS genes form a molecular network. In 
this study, we have uncovered a novel molecular network between ADTRP and 
MIA3/TANGO1 for the pathogenesis of CAD. We showed that knockdown of ADTRP 
expression markedly down-regulated expression of MIA3/TANGO1. Mechanistically, 
ADTRP positively regulates expression of PIK3R3 encoding the regulatory subunit 
3 of PI3K, which leads to activation of AKT, resulting in up-regulation of 
MIA3/TANGO1. Both ADTRP and MIA3/TANGO1 are involved in endothelial cell (EC) 
functions relevant to atherosclerosis. Knockdown of ADTRP expression by siRNA 
promoted oxidized-LDL-mediated monocyte adhesion to ECs and transendothelial 
migration of monocytes, inhibited EC proliferation and migration, and increased 
apoptosis, which was reversed by expression of constitutively active AKT1 and 
MIA3/TANGO1 overexpression, while the over-expression of ADTRP in ECs blunted 
these processes. Knockdown of MIA3/TANGO1 expression also promoted monocyte 
adhesion to ECs and transendothelial migration of monocytes, and vice versa for 
overexpression of MIA3/TANGO1. We found that ADTRP negatively regulates the 
levels of collagen VII and ApoB in HepG2 and endothelial cells, which are 
downstream regulatory targets of MIA3/TANGOI. In conclusion, we have uncovered a 
novel molecular signaling pathway for the pathogenesis of CAD, which involves a 
novel gene-gene regulatory network. We show that ADTRP positively regulates 
PIK3R3 expression, which leads to activation of AKT and up-regulation of 
MIA3/TANGO1, thereby regulating endothelial cell functions directly relevant to 
atherosclerosis.
