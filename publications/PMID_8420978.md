Three mutants of rat hsc70 were constructed, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, 
purified, and characterized. First, site-directed mutation was utilized to 
substitute Asn for Asp-10. The recombinant protein, hsc70(D10N), loses not only 
its peptide-stimulated ATPase activity but also its basal ATPase activity. The 
measured dissociation constants of ATP (0.3 microM) and S-peptide (5 microM) for 
hsc70(D10N), however, are virtually identical to those of hsc70. The intrinsic 
fluorescence spectra of hsc70(D10N) also remain largely unchanged. Therefore, 
the overall structure of the hsc70 protein is most likely intact after mutation. 
Second, the entire C-terminal peptide-binding domain was deleted and the 
resultant mutant contains only the N-terminal ATPase domain of hsc70. This 
recombinant protein, Nt-hsc70, is a peptide-independent ATPase. The ATPase 
activity at 37 degrees C of the Nt-hsc70, 270 pmol/h/micrograms of protein, is 
comparable to that of maximally peptide-activated hsc70. Third, the Asp-10 of 
Nt-hsc70 was replaced by Asn. Despite that this mutant, Nt-hsc70(D10N), is 
capable of binding ATP and it loses the capability to hydrolyze ATP. Taken 
together, these results indicate that aspartyl residue 10 of hsc70 is essential 
for ATP hydrolysis. Purified hsc70 and its mutants autophosphorylate in vitro at 
a substoichiometric level. On average, less than 1% of the hsc70 and Nt-hsc70 
proteins are phosphorylated. Although the amount of phosphate incorporated into 
hsc70(D10N) and Nt-hsc70(D10) is reduced, a significant level of phosphorylation 
can still be achieved in these two site-directed mutants. Hence, 
autophosphorylation of hsc70 and its mutants is not correlated with their 
ability to hydrolyze ATP.
