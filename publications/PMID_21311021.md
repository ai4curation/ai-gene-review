Splicing of mammalian precursor transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules involves two 
enzymatic steps. First, intron removal by the tRNA splicing endonuclease 
generates separate 5' and 3' exons. In animals, the second step predominantly 
entails direct exon ligation by an elusive RNA ligase. Using activity-guided 
purification of tRNA ligase from HeLa cell extracts, we identified HSPC117, a 
member of the UPF0027 (RtcB) family, as the essential subunit of a tRNA ligase 
complex. RNA interference-mediated depletion of HSPC117 inhibited maturation of 
intron-containing pre-tRNA both in vitro and in living cells. The high sequence 
conservation of HSPC117/RtcB proteins is suggestive of RNA ligase roles of this 
protein family in various organisms.
