Dendritic cells (DCs) are recruited to inflammatory sites where they phagocytose 
and process antigens for subsequent presentation to the T lymphocytes in the 
lymphoid tissue. Several leukocyte chemoattractants and their specific receptors 
have been shown to induce the migration of DC. The complement protein C1q has 
multiple immune functions including acting as a chemoattractant for neutrophils, 
eosinophils and mast cells. Therefore, the objective of this study was to 
determine if soluble C1q can induce chemotaxis of DC. Culturing cells in GM-CSF 
and IL-4 for 5 to 7 days generated human monocyte-derived DCs. In addition, LPS 
was added from day 5 to 7 to induce DC maturation. Cells were classified as 
either immature or mature DC by assessing the cell surface markers by flow 
cytometry, phagocytosis of dextran-FITC and T cell proliferation in an allogenic 
MLR. Immature DCs express the C1q receptors (C1qR), gC1qR and cC1qR/CR and, 
accordingly, display a vigorous migratory response to soluble C1q with maximal 
cell movement observed at 10-50nM. In contrast, mature DCs neither express C1qR 
nor do move to a gradient of soluble C1q. Varying the concentration gradient of 
C1q (checkerboard assay) showed that the protein largely induces a chemotactic 
response. Finally, blocking gC1qR and cC1qR/CR by using specific antibodies 
abolished the chemotactic response to C1q but had no effect on a different 
chemoattractant C5a. These results clearly demonstrate that C1q functions as a 
chemotactic factor for immature DC, and migration is mediated through ligation 
of both gC1qR and cC1qR/CR.
