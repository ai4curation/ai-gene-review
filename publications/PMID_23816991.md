A precise mapping of pathogen-host interactions is essential for comprehensive 
understanding of the processes of infection and pathogenesis. The most 
frequently used techniques for interactomics are the yeast two-hybrid binary 
methodologies, which do not recapitulate the pathogen life cycle, and the tandem 
affinity purification mass spectrometry co-complex methodologies, which cannot 
distinguish direct from indirect interactions. New technologies are thus needed 
to improve the mapping of pathogen-host interactions. In the current study, we 
detected binary interactions between influenza A virus polymerase and host 
proteins during the course of an actual viral infection, using a new strategy 
based on trans-complementation of the Gluc1 and Gluc2 fragments of Gaussia 
princeps luciferase. Infectious recombinant influenza viruses that encode a 
Gluc1-tagged polymerase subunit were engineered to infect cultured cells 
transiently expressing a selected set of Gluc2-tagged cellular proteins involved 
in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking pathways. A random set and a literature-curated 
set of Gluc2-tagged cellular proteins were tested in parallel. Our assay allowed 
the sensitive and accurate recovery of previously described interactions, and it 
revealed 30% of positive, novel viral-host protein-protein interactions within 
the exploratory set. In addition to cellular proteins involved in the nuclear 
import pathway, components of the nuclear pore complex such as NUP62 and mRNA 
export factors such as NXF1, RMB15B, and DDX19B were identified for the first 
time as interactors of the viral polymerase. Gene silencing experiments further 
showed that NUP62 is required for efficient viral replication. Our findings give 
new insights regarding the subversion of host nucleocytoplasmic trafficking 
pathways by influenza A viruses. They also demonstrate the potential of our 
infectious protein complementation assay for high-throughput exploration of 
influenza virus interactomics in infected cells. With more infectious reverse 
genetics systems becoming available, this strategy should be widely applicable 
to numerous pathogens.
