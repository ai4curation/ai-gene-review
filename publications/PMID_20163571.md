We used multiple approaches to investigate the coordination of trans and medial 
Rab proteins in the regulation of intra-Golgi retrograde trafficking. We 
reasoned that medially located Rab33b might act downstream of the trans Golgi 
Rab, Rab6, in regulating intra-Golgi retrograde trafficking. We found that 
knockdown of Rab33b, like Rab6, suppressed conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) 
complex- or Zeste White 10 (ZW10)-depletion induced disruption of the Golgi 
ribbon in HeLa cells. Moreover, efficient GTP-restricted Rab6 induced relocation 
of Golgi enzymes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was Rab33b-dependent, but not 
vice versa, suggesting that the two Rabs act sequentially in an intra-Golgi Rab 
cascade. In support of this hypothesis, we found that overexpression of 
GTP-Rab33b induced the dissociation of Rab6 from Golgi membranes in vivo. In 
addition, the transport of Shiga-like toxin B fragment (SLTB) from the trans to 
cis Golgi and ER required Rab33b. Surprisingly, depletion of Rab33b had little, 
if any, immediate effect on cell growth and multiplication. Furthermore, 
anterograde trafficking of tsO45G protein through the Golgi apparatus was 
normal. We suggest that the Rab33b/Rab6 regulated intra-Golgi retrograde 
trafficking pathway must coexist with other Golgi trafficking pathways. In 
conclusion, we provide the first evidence that Rab33b and Rab6 act to coordinate 
a major intra-Golgi retrograde trafficking pathway. This coordination may have 
parallels with Rab conversion/cascade events that regulate endosome, phagosome 
and exocytic processes.
