Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare inherited disorder in which 
phagocytes lack NADPH oxidase activity. The most common form is caused by 
mutations in the CYBB gene encoding gp91 phox protein, the heavy chain of 
cytochrome b(558), which is the redox element of NADPH oxidase. In some rare 
cases, the mutated gp91 phox is normally expressed but no NADPH oxidase can be 
detected. This type of CGD is called X91(+) CGD. We have previously reported an 
X(+) CGD case with a double-missense mutation in gp91 phox. Transgenic PLB-985 
cells have now been made to study the impact of each single mutation on oxidase 
activity and assembly to rule out a possible new polymorphism in the CYBB gene. 
The His303Asn/Pro304Arg gp91 phox transgenic PLB-985 cells exactly mimic the 
phenotype of the neutrophils of the X(+) CGD patient. The His303Asn mutation is 
sufficient to inhibit oxidase activity in intact cells and in a broken cell 
system, whereas in the Pro304Arg mutant, residual activity suggests that the 
Pro304Arg substitution is less devastating to oxidase activity than the 
His303Asn mutation. The study of NADPH oxidase assembly following the in vitro 
and in vivo translocation of cytosolic factors p47 phox and p67 phox has 
demonstrated that, in the double mutant and in the His303Asn mutant, NADPH 
oxidase assembly is abolished, although the translocation is only attenuated in 
Pro304Arg mutant cells. Thus, even though the His303Asn mutation has a more 
severe inhibitory effect on NADPH oxidase activity and assembly than the 
Pro304Arg mutation, neither mutation can be considered as a polymorphism.
