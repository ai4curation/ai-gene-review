The MYC proto-oncogene encodes a transcription factor that has been implicated 
in the genesis of many human tumours. Here, we used a bar-code short hairpin RNA 
(shRNA) screen to identify multiple genes that are required for MYC function. 
One of these genes encodes USP28, an ubiquitin-specific protease. USP28 is 
required for MYC stability in human tumour cells. USP28 binds to MYC through an 
interaction with FBW7alpha, an F-box protein that is part of an SCF-type 
ubiquitin ligase. Therefore, it stabilizes MYC in the nucleus, but not in the 
nucleolus, where MYC is degraded by FBW7gamma. High expression levels of USP28 
are found in colon and breast carcinomas, and stabilization of MYC by USP28 is 
essential for tumour-cell proliferation.
