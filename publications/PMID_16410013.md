The protein-tyrosine kinase Syk couples immune recognition receptors to multiple 
signal transduction pathways, including the mobilization of calcium and the 
activation of NFAT. The ability of Syk to regulate signaling is influenced by 
its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues within the linker B region. The 
phosphorylation of both Y342 and Y346 is necessary for optimal signaling from 
the B cell receptor for antigen. The SH2 domains of multiple signaling proteins 
share the ability to bind this doubly phosphorylated site. The NMR structure of 
the C-terminal SH2 domain of PLCgamma (PLCC) bound to a doubly phosphorylated 
Syk peptide reveals a novel mode of phosphotyrosine recognition. PLCC undergoes 
extensive conformational changes upon binding to form a second 
phosphotyrosine-binding pocket in which pY346 is largely desolvated and 
stabilized through electrostatic interactions. The formation of the second 
binding pocket is distinct from other modes of phosphotyrosine recognition in 
SH2-protein association. The dependence of signaling on simultaneous 
phosphorylation of these two tyrosine residues offers a new mechanism to 
fine-tune the cellular response to external stimulation.
