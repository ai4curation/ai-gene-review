Iso-1 yeast cytochrome c (YCC) was adsorbed on Ag electrodes coated with 
self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) consisting either of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid 
(MUA) or of 1:1 mixtures of MUA and either 11-mercaptoundecanol (MU) or 
7-mercaptoheptanol (MH). The redox potentials and the apparent rate constants 
for the interfacial redox process as well as for the protein reorientation were 
determined by stationary surface-enhanced resonance Raman (SERR) and 
time-resolved SERR spectroscopy, respectively. For YCC immobilized on MUA and 
MUA/MU at pH 7.0 and 6.0, the negative shifts of the redox potentials with 
respect to that for the protein in solution can be rationalized in terms of the 
potential of the zero-charge determined by impedance measurements. The apparent 
electron transfer rate constants of YCC on MUA/MU and MU/MH at pH 6.0 were 
determined to be 8 and 18 s(-1), respectively. A decrease of the relaxations 
constants by a factor of ca. 2 was found for pH 7.0, and a comparable low value 
was determined for a pure MUA even at pH 6.0. In each system, the rate constant 
for protein reorientation was found to be the same as that for the electron 
transfer, implying that protein reorientation is the rate limiting step for the 
interfacial redox process. This gating step is distinctly slower than that for 
horse heart cytochrome c (HHCC) observed previously under similar conditions 
(Murgida, D. H.; Hildebrandt, P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 4062-4068). The 
different rate constants of protein reorientation for both proteins and the 
variations of the rate constants for the different SAMs and pH are attributed to 
the electric field dependence of the free energy of activation which is assumed 
to be proportional to the product of the electric field strength and the 
molecular dipole moment of the protein. The latter quantity is determined by 
molecular dynamics simulations and electrostatic calculations to be more than 2 
times larger for YCC than for HHCC. Moreover, the dipole moment vector and the 
heme plane constitute an angle of ca. 10 and 45 degrees in YCC and HHCC, 
respectively. The different magnitudes and directions of the dipole moments as 
well as the different electric field strengths at the various SAM/protein 
interfaces allow for a qualitative description of the protein-, SAM-, and 
electrode-specific kinetics of the interfacial redox processes studied in this 
and previous works.
