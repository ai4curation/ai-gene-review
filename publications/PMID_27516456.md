BACKGROUND: Calmodulin (CaM) mutations are associated with severe forms of long 
QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). 
CaM mutations are found in 13% of genotype-negative long QT syndrome patients, 
but the prevalence of CaM mutations in genotype-negative CPVT patients is 
unknown. Here, we identify and characterize CaM mutations in 12 patients with 
genotype-negative but clinically diagnosed CPVT.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed mutational analysis of CALM1, CALM2, and CALM3 
gene-coding regions, in vitro measurement of CaM-Ca(2+) (Ca)-binding affinity, 
ryanodine receptor 2-CaM binding, Ca handling, L-type Ca current, and action 
potential duration. We identified a novel CaM mutation-A103V-in CALM3 in 1 of 12 
patients (8%), a female who experienced episodes of exertion-induced syncope 
since age 10, had normal QT interval, and displayed ventricular ectopy during 
stress testing consistent with CPVT. A103V modestly lowered CaM Ca-binding 
affinity (3-fold reduction versus WT-CaM), but did not alter CaM binding to 
ryanodine receptor 2. In permeabilized cardiomyocytes, A103V-CaM (100 nmol/L) 
promoted spontaneous Ca wave and spark activity, a cellular phenotype of 
ryanodine receptor 2 activation. Even a 1:3 mixture of A103V-CaM:WT-CaM 
activated Ca waves, demonstrating functional dominance. Compared with long QT 
syndrome D96V-CaM, A103V-CaM had significantly less effects on L-type Ca current 
inactivation, did not alter action potential duration, and caused delayed 
afterdepolarizations and triggered beats in intact cardiomyocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: We discovered a novel CPVT mutation in the CALM3 gene that shares 
functional characteristics with established CPVT-associated mutations in CALM1. 
A small proportion of A103V-CaM is sufficient to evoke arrhythmogenic Ca 
disturbances via ryanodine receptor 2 dysregulation, which explains the 
autosomal dominant inheritance.

Methods and Results

Mutational analysis of CALM1 , CALM2 and CALM3 coding regions, in vitro measurement of CaM-Ca 2+ (Ca) binding affinity, RyR2-CaM binding, Ca handling, L-type Ca current (LTCC) and action potential duration (APD). We identified a novel CaM mutation – A103V – in CALM3 in 1 of 12 patients (8%), a female who experienced episodes of exertion-induced syncope since age 10, had normal QT interval, and displayed ventricular ectopy during stress testing consistent with CPVT. A103V modestly lowered CaM Ca-binding affinity (3-fold reduction vs WT-CaM), but did not alter CaM binding to RyR2. In permeabilized cardiomyocytes, A103V-CaM (100 nM) promoted spontaneous Ca wave and spark activity, a cellular phenotype of RyR2 activation. Even a 1:3 mixture of A103V-CaM:WT-CaM activated Ca waves, demonstrating functional dominance. Compared to LQTS D96V-CaM, A103V-CaM had significantly less effects on LTCC inactivation and APD, and caused delayed after depolarizations (DADs) and triggered beats in intact cardiomyocytes.

Conclusions

We discovered a novel CPVT mutation in the CALM3 gene that shares functional characteristics with established CPVT-associated mutations in CALM1 . A small proportion of A103V-CaM is sufficient to evoke arrhythmogenic Ca disturbances via RyR2 dysregulation, which explains the autosomal dominant inheritance.

Introduction

Calmodulin (CaM) is an essential Ca-binding protein with multiple cellular targets. CaM has 4 EF-hand Ca-binding motifs located in 2 N-terminal (CaM-N) and 2 C-terminal (C-CaM) globular domains, which are connected by a flexible linker 1 . At high [Ca], Ca binds cooperatively to CaM, inducing a conformational change that transduces Ca signals in a wide range of biological processes including inflammation, muscle contraction, memory, metabolism, and immune responses. Recently, CaM missense mutations have been identified in patients with severe ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death susceptibility 2 - 4 . Humans have 3 CaM genes ( CALM1 , CALM2 , and CALM3 ) encoding for a perfectly conserved sequence of amino acids, and all three CaM genes are expressed in the heart 5 .

CaM regulates a variety of ion channels in cardiac myocytes. Among them, changes in CaM regulation of the L-type calcium channel (LTCC) and RyR2 have been associated with autosomal dominant syndrome of sudden death that can present with clinical features of long QT syndrome (LQTS) or catecholaminergic induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) 2 - 4 . CaM is the main Ca sensor for the LTCC 6 , 7 and mutations that lead to a reduction in CaM Ca binding affinity impair Ca-dependent inactivation of LTCCs and cause action potential prolongation, which can explain the LQTS phenotype 8 . CaM also binds to RyR2 stoichiometrically (4 CaMs per tetrameric RyR2) 9 and inhibits RyR2 opening at all [Ca], which regulates SR Ca release 10 . Mutations that cause defective CaM-mediated RyR2 inactivation may contribute to RyR2 leakiness promoting significantly higher spontaneous Ca wave and spark activity, a typical cellular phenotype of CPVT.

Here, we tested the prevalence of CaM mutations in a cohort of 12 patients with genotype-negative CPVT. We identified a novel CaM mutation – A103V – in CALM3 , in one of the 12 patients. We then characterized the functional effects of the novel A103V mutant CaM on Ca binding affinity, RyR2 binding, Ca handling, and the LTCC and compared the effects of A103V to those of the only two other CaM mutants associated with CPVT (N54I and N98S). Our data suggest that the CALM3-A103V mutation underlies the patient's CPVT.

Discussion

The major finding reported here is the discovery of a novel CPVT mutation – CaM-A103V – in the CALM3 gene; a gene that up to now had not been linked to CPVT. Furthermore, finding CaM mutations in 1 out of 12 patients (8%) with major CPVT genotype-negative but clinically diagnosed CPVT suggests that the prevalence of CaM mutations in CPVT may be higher than previously thought. Since CaM mutations have also been identified in 13 % of genotype-negative LQTS patients 18 , and in a family with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation 19 , CaM mutations should be considered as a significant contributor to genetic sudden death syndromes.

The cellular mechanisms involved in the arrhythmia susceptibility in the setting of CaM mutations are complex due to the multiple targets of this protein in the cell. For example, dysfunctional CaM mutants can impair Ca-dependent inactivation of LTCCs leading to increased depolarizing current during the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential 3 . On the other hand, CaM mutations can also lead to aberrant regulation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) Ca release 4 , 9 . Our in vitro investigation demonstrated that CaM-A103V has an activating effect on RyR2 Ca release that is similar to that reported for two established CPVT-linked CaM mutations (N54I and N98S) 4 and matches also the defect in Ca-handling observed in animal models of CPVT–linked mutations residing directly within either the cardiac ryanodine receptor or calsequestrin 12 , 20 . Given that models of human CPVT-linked mutations present higher rates of spontaneous Ca release and delayed after depolarizations 21 and that drugs that suppress spontaneous SR Ca release in single cells are effective in preventing CPVT in animal models and patients 22 , it is generally accepted that spontaneous Ca release from the SR is the underlying pathophysiological mechanism responsible for CPVT. In this regard, previous studies using CALM1 mutants (N54I and N98S) showed that both CPVT-CaMs bound with greater affinity to RyR2 than WT-CaM but at the same time both failed to inhibit or directly activated RyR2, rendering them hyperactive and generating arrhythmogenic Ca waves 4 .

The novel CALM3 mutation A103V studied here also activates RyR2 Ca release channels generating Ca waves and depleting SR Ca store. In fact, spontaneous Ca releases induced by this mutation generated DADs that triggered spontaneous APs ( Figure 7C ), which is consistent with the clinical CPVT phenotype. Similar to the previously reported CALM1 mutations, A103V-CaM exhibited dominant-activating effects on Ca waves when mixed with WT-CaM, which is consistent with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern in humans 4 . However, in contrast to the previously published CPVT CaM mutants, A103V did not exhibit increased RyR2 affinity. The significance of the latter finding is unclear, but could mean that only 1 mutant CaM out of 4 CaMs bound to the RyR2 complex is needed and sufficient to cause aberrant RyR2 regulation. The unchanged RyR2 binding affinity of A103V-CaM, compared to the increased affinity observed for the two other CPVT-linked CaM mutantsN54I and N98S, might explain the milder phenotype of our two patients compared with patients carrying the previously reported CPVT-linked CALM1 mutations, especially since, CALM3 mRNA transcript levels are reportedly higher than CALM1 and 2 mRNA transcripts levels in human hearts 3 .

Another important CaM target related to arrhythmogenesis is the LTCC (Cav1.2). Pre-association of Ca-free-CaM with Cav1.2 regulates Ca-dependent channel inactivation 23 . Thus, CaM mutations that show reduced Ca binding affinity can disrupt Ca-dependent inactivation of LTCC. While A103V-CaM mutant showed a trend to impair LTCC inactivation due to a small reduction in Ca binding affinity, the effect is very small compared to the published LQTS-associated CaM mutations (D96V, D130G F142L and E141G) 8 , 18 . Furthermore, LTCC measurements were done with blocked SR and unlike LQTS-associated CaM mutations, A103V enhances SR Ca release and consequently the Ca-dependent inactivation of LTCCs. In fact, we observed that the net effect of A103V-CaM on AP duration was minimal in contrast to the massive AP prolongation observed in cells dialyzed with the LQTS linked D96V-CaM ( Figure 7A ), which is consistent with the lack of QT prolongation in the A103V mutation-positive patient. Nevertheless, the subtle impairment of Ca binding affinity and LTCC inactivation ( Figures 2 and 6 ) and the trend towards longer APD ( Figure 7 ) caused by A103V-CaM may explain the U-waves observed in the ECG of our patient. Notably, the CPVT-linked N98S-CaM mutation also causes some impairment of Ca binding 4 and hence LTCC inactivation, with U-waves reported in the first index case 24 , and a full LQTS phenotype reported in a second individual who carried the same N98S mutation in CALM2 25 .

We find that the in vitro phenotype produced by A103V-CaM is analogous to the two published and established CPVT-linked CaM mutations, which suggests that A103V should be considered a CPVT-susceptibility mutation. Our results further indicate that in vitro functional studies of Ca release in combination with action potential measurements in intact cardiomyocytes can be used to rapidly assess the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenicity of CaM variants that will be discovered in the future. Just as CALM3 has been implicated recently in the pathogenesis of LQTS thereby completing the CaM-mediated LQTS trilogy 26 , 27 , now the CaM-mediated CPVT trilogy has been completed with the discovery of A103V-CALM3.
