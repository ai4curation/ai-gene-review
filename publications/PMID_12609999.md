The activation domains, the proline-rich domain, and the C-terminal basic domain 
in p53 are necessary for acetylation of histones on the proximal p21 promoter 
and interaction with p300/CREB-binding protein.

The p53 transcription factor contains two separate tandem activation domains 
(AD1 and AD2), a proline-rich domain (PRD), and a C-terminal basic domain (BD). 
Previously, we have shown that these domains are necessary for transcriptional 
activity. To further characterize the role of these domains in transactivation, 
we analyzed the regulation of p21, a well characterized p53 target gene, by 
various p53 mutants deficient in one or more of these domains. We found that the 
induction of endogenous p21 is compromised by AD1-deficient p53 (p53(AD1(-))), 
AD2-deficient p53 (p53(AD2(-))), both AD1- and AD2-deficient p53 
(p53(AD1(-)AD2(-))), p53(deltaPRD), which lacks PRD, and p53(deltaBD), which 
lacks BD. However, p53(AD2(-)), p53(deltaPRD), and p53(deltaBD) are still 
capable of activating exogenous p21 promoter to an extent comparable with that 
by wild-type p53. Thus, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to 
measure the DNA binding ability of various p53 mutants in vivo. We found that 
like wild-type p53, these p53 mutants are capable of binding to the p53 response 
elements in the p21 promoter. In contrast, we found that the extent of 
acetylated histones on the p21 promoter, especially the proximal promoter, and 
the amount of interaction with p300/CREB-binding protein, which contain histone 
acetyltransferase activity, directly correlate with the activity of p53 to 
induce endogenous p21. Furthermore, we showed that down-regulation of p300/CBP 
by short interference RNA markedly decreases the ability of p53 to induce 
endogenous p21. These data lead us to hypothesize that when p53 binds to the 
responsive element(s) of a target gene, its ability to interact with histone 
acetyltransferase-containing proteins and subsequently the acetylation of 
histones bound to the proximal promoter dictate the induction level of a target 
gene.
