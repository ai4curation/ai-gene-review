To study the effects of altering dopaminergic input on the levels and rate of 
synthesis of dopamine receptors, corpora striata of mice were lesioned 
unilaterally with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), and the densities and levels of 
the mRNAs for D1 and D2 dopamine receptors were determined. The results showed 
that 6-OHDA caused significant reductions in D1 dopamine receptors and in D1 
dopamine receptor mRNA in dorsolateral and dorsomedial regions of the lesioned 
striatum. By contrast, 6-OHDA lesions caused significant increases in D2 
dopamine receptors and in D2 dopamine receptor mRNA in dorsolateral and 
ventrolateral regions of the lesioned striatum. To assess the effects of 6-OHDA 
lesions on the rate of synthesis of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors, the 
irreversibly acting dopamine receptor antagonist 2-ethoxy-1-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2- 
dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) was administered, and the rate of recovery of these 
receptors determined. The lesions decreased the rate of synthesis of D1 dopamine 
receptors in dorsolateral striatum but increased the rate of synthesis of D2 
dopamine receptors in dorsolateral striatum. Correlation of these molecular 
events with dopaminergic behaviors showed that the rate of recovery from 
EEDQ-induced cataleptic activity and the recovery from inhibition of 
quinpirole-induced rotational behavior was more rapid than the recovery of 
either the D1 or D2 dopamine receptor. These results suggest that dopaminergic 
denervation differentially affects the rate of synthesis of D1 and D2 dopamine 
receptors in mouse striatum, and that these alterations in the rates of 
synthesis of the receptors may be explained by corresponding alterations in the 
levels of the respective transcripts for these receptors.
