It is known that mammalian rpS3 functions as a DNA repair endonuclease and 
ribosomal protein S3. It was also observed that several ribosomal proteins or 
DNA repair enzymes are related to apoptosis. We report here a third function of 
rpS3, induction of apoptosis. The localization of green fluorescent protein 
(GFP)-rpS3 is changed to the nuclear membrane when lymphocytic cells undergo 
rpS3-induced apoptosis. Transient expression of GFP-rpS3 activates 
caspase-8/caspase-3 and sensitizes cytokine-induced apoptosis. Deletion analysis 
reveals that the two functions of rpS3, DNA repair and apoptosis, use 
independent functional domains.
