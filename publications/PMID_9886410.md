During phagocytosis, phagocytic receptors and membrane material must be inserted 
in the pseudopod membrane as it extends over the phagocytic target. This may 
require a clathrin-mediated recycling mechanism similar to that postulated for 
leading edge formation during cell migration. To investigate this possibility, 
liposomes were used to deliver to intact rat alveolar macrophages (AMs): 1) Abs 
to clathrin, clathrin adaptor AP-2, and hsc70, and 2) amantadine. Phagocytosis 
was assayed by fluorometric and colorimetric techniques. Liposome-delivered Abs 
to clathrin and AP-2 inhibited AM phagocytosis of zymosan-coated, fluorescent 
liposomes from 16.3+/-0.3 to 5.8+/-0.3, and 10.1+/-0.9 to 4.8+/-0.2 
liposomes/cell (p<0.01). Similarly, liposome-delivered Ab to clathrin also 
inhibited AM phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized RBCs from 11.7+/-1.7 to 3.8+/-0.7 
RBCs/cell (p<0.01). Amantadine, which blocks the budding of clathrin-coated 
vesicles, inhibited phagocytosis from 13.8+/-0.8 to 5.7+/-0.6 (p<0.01). Ab 
blockade of hsc70, which catalyzes clathrin turnover, also inhibited 
phagocytosis from 9.1+/-0.5 to 4.3+/-0.2 (p<0.01). These findings suggest that 
clathrin-mediated receptor/membrane recycling is required for phagocytosis.
