The amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its mammalian homologs, APLP1, APLP2, 
have been allocated to an organellar pool residing in the Golgi apparatus and in 
endosomal compartments, and in its mature form to a cell surface-localized pool. 
In the brain, all APPs are restricted to neurons; however, their precise 
localization at the plasma membrane remained enigmatic. Employing a variety of 
subcellular fractionation steps, we isolated two synaptic vesicle (SV) pools 
from rat and mouse brain, a pool consisting of synaptic vesicles only and a pool 
comprising SV docked to the presynaptic plasma membrane. Immunopurification of 
these two pools using a monoclonal antibody directed against the 12 membrane 
span synaptic vesicle protein2 (SV2) demonstrated unambiguously that APP, APLP1 
and APLP2 are constituents of the active zone of murine brain but essentially 
absent from free synaptic vesicles. The specificity of immunodetection was 
confirmed by analyzing the respective knock-out animals. The fractionation 
experiments further revealed that APP is accumulated in the fraction containing 
docked synaptic vesicles. These data present novel insights into the subsynaptic 
localization of APPs and are a prerequisite for unraveling the physiological 
role of all mature APP proteins in synaptic physiology.
