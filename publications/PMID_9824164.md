Predisposition to hereditary breast cancer has been attributed in part to 
inherited mutations in the BRCA2 gene. The large protein it encodes is still 
poorly characterized with respect to functions. We have previously shown that 
BRCA2 has transcriptional activation potential conferred by its amino-terminal 
third exon. Here, we show that BRCA2 interacts with a transcriptional 
co-activator protein, P/CAF, which possesses histone acetyltransferase activity. 
The interaction with P/CAF is demonstrated in vitro as well as in vivo and is 
shown to be mediated by residues 290-453 of BRCA2. Consistent with the binding 
to an acetyltransferase, BRCA2 is shown to associate with acetyltransferase 
activity in nuclear extracts. Contrary to a recent report, we find no evidence 
in support of an intrinsic HAT activity in BRCA2 amino-terminus. Our results 
further substantiate the notion that BRCA2 has transcriptional activation 
function and suggest that one mechanism by which BRCA2 regulates transcription 
may be through the recruitment of histone-modifying activity of the P/CAF 
co-activator.
