Abstract

Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) inhibits proliferation and promotes cell migration. In TGF-β-treated MCF10A mammary epithelial cells overexpressing HER2 and by chromatin immunoprecipitation, we identified novel Smad targets including protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type kappa (PTPRK). TGF-β up-regulated PTPRK mRNA and RPTPκ (receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase kappa, the protein product encoded by the PTPRK gene) protein in tumor and nontumor mammary cells; HER2 overexpression down-regulated its expression. RNA interference (RNAi) of PTPRK accelerated cell cycle progression, enhanced response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), and abrogated TGF-β-mediated antimitogenesis. Endogenous RPTPκ associated with EGF receptor and HER2, resulting in suppression of basal and ErbB ligand-induced proliferation and receptor phosphorylation. In MCF10A/HER2 cells, TGF-β enhanced cell motility, FAK phosphorylation, F-actin assembly, and focal adhesion formation and inhibited RhoA activity. These responses were abolished when RPTPκ was eliminated by RNA interference (RNAi). In cells expressing RPTPκ RNAi, phosphorylation of Src at Tyr527 was increased and (activating) phosphorylation of Src at Tyr416 was reduced. These data suggest that (i) RPTPκ positively regulates Src; (ii) HER2 signaling and TGF-β-induced RPTPκ converge at Src, providing an adequate input for activation of FAK and increased cell motility and adhesion; and (iii) RPTPκ is required for both the antiproliferative and the promigratory effects of TGF-β.

DISCUSSION

We have examined novel mechanisms by which TGF-β cooperates with HER2 in the progression of mammary tumor cells. We established a Smad-bound DNA pool from a ChIP assay in MCF10A/HER2 cells and identified several novel Smad target genes including PTPRK, STK24, ITGA9, and vimentin-similar gene. In the ChIP assay, a stronger affinity between Smads and certain DNA regions results in a higher abundance of this DNA in the precipitated pool. To obtain enough DNA fragments for cloning and sequencing, we PCR amplified the Smad target DNA pool originally obtained by ChIP. Since PCR amplifies template DNA logarithmically, the differences in abundance between high-affinity and low-affinity DNA regions were further amplified by PCR. As a result, the amplified Smad target DNA pool should contain more copies for high-affinity than low-affinity DNA regions and, therefore, may represent physiologically important TGF-β-regulated genes. This may also explain why other more known TGF-β-induced Smad-target DNA regions were not found in the DNA pool. In addition, genetic and epigenetic factors, such as HER2 overexpression, can alter TGF-β-mediated gene expression. Thus, the Smad target DNA pool may represent TGF-β-Smad target genes in mammary epithelial cells that overexpress HER2 but not in cells with low HER2 levels. Indeed, TGF-β only induced Smads to bind to and regulate STK24, ITGA9, and vimentin-similar gene expression in HER2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1B ), suggesting that cofactors regulated by HER2 signaling modulate Smad-mediated transcription.

We focused on the PTPRK gene, whose expression was up-regulated by TGF-β in both tumor and nontumor mammary cells. PTPRK expression has been found in the spleen, prostate, ovary, kidney, and liver and in keratinocytes and epidermal cell lines ( 20 , 56 ) and is up-regulated by TGF-β in keratinocytes ( 55 ). PTPRK mRNA and protein levels were lower in breast cancer cells than in MCF10A cells. Overexpression of HER2 markedly decreased RPTPκ, and blockade of HER2 function with Herceptin or gefitinib partially restored RPTPκ expression (Fig. 2B ). Furthermore, down-regulation of RPTPκ by RNAi accelerated cell cycle progression, enhanced the response to EGF, and abrogated TGF-β-mediated antimitogenic action. Finally, overexpression of RPTPκ inhibited basal and ligand (EGF and heregulin)-induced proliferation and ErbB receptor signaling in cancer cells. These results may explain the reported ability of TGF-β to reversibly inhibit the proliferative responses to EGF receptor ligands ( 9 , 38 ). They also suggest, as for TGF-β, a tumor suppressor role for RPTPκ. Consistent with this notion, studies have shown that deletions in chromosome 6q22-23, the genomic locus for the PTPRK gene, are one of the most common alterations in high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas ( 33 , 62 ). However, knockdown of RPTPκ in MCF10A cells was not sufficient to maintain dysregulated proliferation but, instead, resulted in multiple nuclei, abnormal cell morphology, and apoptosis (Fig. 3 ; see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). This result implies that besides the accelerated cell proliferation caused by the suppression of RPTPκ, other oncogenic signals are also required to synchronize nuclear division and cytokinesis and therefore sustain prolonged dysregulated cell division.

PTPs dynamically modulate the initiation, duration, and termination of signal transduction mediated by tyrosine kinases, thus playing an important role in cell behavior ( 27 ), integrin signaling ( 40 ), cell-cell ( 1 ), and cell-ECM assembly ( 4 ). Many PTPs recognize RTKs or RTK adaptor proteins (i.e., PTP1B binds the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, PTP SHP1 binds c-Kit, and PTPα binds Grb2) and negatively regulate RTK-induced cellular transformation ( 21 , 22 , 42 , 44 ). Other receptor type transmembrane PTPs, such as PTPα and PTPɛ, can support the transformed phenotype by activating Src/Yes/Fyn kinases ( 7 , 18 ). In this study, RPTPκ induced growth inhibition at least in part through suppression of ErbB receptor phosphorylation. PTPα expression is also associated with breast cancer cell growth inhibition ( 5 ). In addition, PTPα has been reported to mediate integrin-stimulated FAK phosphorylation; PTPα −/− cells show defects in migration and delayed F-actin stress fiber assembly as well as focal adhesion formation ( 60 ). Our data indicate that RNAi of RPTPκ increases the inactivating phosphorylation of Src at Tyr527 and disrupts focal adhesion formation, F-actin assembly, TGF-β-induced FAK phosphorylation, and cell migration, further suggesting that RPTPκ and PTPα share common functions.

PTPα and RPTPκ also exhibit different functional characteristics. RPTPκ, as well as PTPs μ, ρ, and λ, contain an extracellular domain consisting of MAM (meprin/A5-protein/PTPμ), IgG, and fibronectin type III motifs. This complex extracellular domain is likely to have adhesive functions in cell-cell interactions ( 2 ). Indeed, RPTPκ has been reported to mediate homophilic intercellular interactions ( 39 ) and colocalize with β- and γ-catenin at adherens junctions ( 14 ). PTPα and ɛ do not have the extracellular domain found in RPTPκ but are heavily glycosylated ( 3 ). Overexpression of PTPα, but not RPTPκ, inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose transport ( 10 ). RPTPκ associates with armadillo family members ( 14 ), but the same association has not been found with PTPα. The mechanisms regulating expression of both PTPs also diverge. HER2 overexpression induces PTPα expression in human ovarian cancer cells ( 52 ) but suppresses RPTPκ expression in breast cancer cells (Fig. 2 ). RPTPκ expression is also induced by high cell density ( 14 ), suggesting an involvement in contact inhibition of cell growth. Although RPTPκ interacts with and dephosphorylates β-catenin in vitro ( 14 ), the cellular substrates of the phosphatase's catalytic activity remain to be identified. RPTPκ is proteolytically cleaved and the cleavage products remain associated ( 20 ); the biological significance of this proteolytic processing is unclear.

The results presented herein support dual functions of RPTPκ in cell transformation (Fig. 8 ). RPTPκ expression is up-regulated by TGFβ and down-regulated by HER2 signaling. RPTPκ can associate with ErbB receptors and suppress signal transduction, thus delaying cell proliferation. On the other hand, RPTPκ is involved in F-actin stress fiber assembly, focal adhesion formation, Src activation, FAK phosphorylation, and downregulation of RhoA. We speculate that by inhibiting RhoA to induce turnover of focal adhesions ( 36 ) while leaving Rac1 function unchanged (Fig. 7B ), RPTPκ contributes to TGF-β-induced cell motility. In nontumor mammary epithelial cells, basal and TGF-β-induced levels of RPTPκ are high and the antiproliferative effects of the phosphatase are dominant. In HER2-overexpressing cells, however, TGF-β and HER2 have antagonistic effects on RPTPκ expression but TGF-β can still induce RPTPκ levels to a threshold that allows ligand-induced enhancement of cell migration and adhesion. In addition, the high levels of HER2-activated Src provide an adequate threshold of Src activity for TGF-β-enhanced adhesion and migration. The loss of these TGF-β responses in siPTPRK cells (Fig. 6 and 7 ) implies that RPTPκ is required for these processes. This may be a function of the subcellular localization of RPTPκ and the association of RPTPκ with HER2 and other proteins in TGF-β-treated cells. In summary, the data presented suggest that RPTPκ phenocopies the dual role of TGF-β in epithelial cells: high expression is associated with tumor suppression, whereas limited expression is associated with cell behaviors reflective of increased transformation.
