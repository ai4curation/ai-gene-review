Soluble β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers impair synaptic plasticity and cause synaptic 
loss associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We report that murine PirB 
(paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B) and its human ortholog LilrB2 (leukocyte 
immunoglobulin-like receptor B2), present in human brain, are receptors for Aβ 
oligomers, with nanomolar affinity. The first two extracellular immunoglobulin 
(Ig) domains of PirB and LilrB2 mediate this interaction, leading to enhanced 
cofilin signaling, also seen in human AD brains. In mice, the deleterious effect 
of Aβ oligomers on hippocampal long-term potentiation required PirB, and in a 
transgenic model of AD, PirB not only contributed to memory deficits present in 
adult mice, but also mediated loss of synaptic plasticity in juvenile visual 
cortex. These findings imply that LilrB2 contributes to human AD neuropathology 
and suggest therapeutic uses of blocking LilrB2 function.
