ACSL4 is a member of the ACSL family that catalyzes the conversion of long-chain 
fatty acids to acyl-coenzyme As, which are essential for fatty-acid 
incorporation and utilization in diverse metabolic pathways, including 
cholesteryl ester synthesis. Steroidogenic tissues such as the adrenal gland are 
particularly enriched in cholesteryl esters of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty 
acids, which constitute an important pool supplying cholesterol for steroid 
synthesis. The current studies addressed whether ACSL4 is required for normal 
steroidogenesis. CYP11A1 promoter‒mediated Cre was used to generate steroid 
tissue‒specific ACSL4 knockout (KO) mice. Results demonstrated that ACSL4 plays 
an important role in adrenal cholesteryl ester formation, as well as in 
determining the fatty acyl composition of adrenal cholesteryl esters, with ACSL4 
deficiency leading to reductions in cholesteryl ester storage and alterations in 
cholesteryl ester composition. Statistically significant reductions in 
corticosterone and testosterone production, but not progesterone production, 
were observed in vivo, and these deficits were accentuated in ex vivo and in 
vitro studies of isolated steroid tissues and cells from ACSL4-deficient mice. 
However, these effects on steroid production appear to be due to reductions in 
cholesteryl ester stores rather than disturbances in signaling pathways. We 
conclude that ACSL4 is dispensable for normal steroidogenesis.
