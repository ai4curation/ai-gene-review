Sox9 belongs to the family of Sry-related high-mobility group box transcription 
factors controlling cell fate, cell proliferation and differentiation in various 
tissues, including cartilage, testis, the central nervous system, kidney, and 
gastrointestine. Mice conditionally lacking Sox9 have revealed essential roles 
for Sox9 in these tissues. To gain further insight into the role of Sox9 in 
different tissues and at different stages of development, we have generated a 
transgenic mouse line to express Sox9 in a Cre recombinase-dependent manner. The 
construct contained the human cytomegalovirus enhancer and chicken β-actin 
promoter, and a floxed monomeric red fluorescence protein 1 (mRFP1) cassette to 
direct ubiquitous expression of mRFP1. Cre expression removed the mRFP1 gene, 
allowing expression of Sox9 and enhanced green fluorescent protein. Expectedly, 
overexpression of Sox9 in chondrocytes using Col2a1-Cre mice suppressed 
chondrocyte hypertrophy, and delayed terminal differentiation and subsequent 
ossification. Misexpression of Sox9 in hypertrophic chondrocytes using 
Col10a1-Cre knock-in mice also delayed terminal differentiation. This Sox9 
conditional transgenic mouse line will be a valuable tool to uncover 
tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific functions of Sox9.
