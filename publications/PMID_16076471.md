The epidermal growth factor receptor is a member of type-I growth factor 
receptor family with tyrosine kinase activity that is activated following the 
binding of multiple cognate ligands. Several members of the EGF family of 
ligands are expressed by cells involved in atherogenesis. EGF receptor mediated 
processes have been well characterised within epithelial, smooth muscle and 
tumour cell lines in vitro, and the EGF receptor has been identified 
immunocytochemically on intimal smooth muscle cells within atherosclerotic 
plaques. There is also limited evidence for the expression of the EGF receptor 
family on leukocytes, although their function has yet to be clarified. In this 
review, we will discuss the biological functions of this receptor and its 
ligands and their potential to modulate the function of cells involved in the 
atherosclerotic process.
