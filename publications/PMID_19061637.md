Seasonal changes in day length are perceived by plant photoreceptors and 
transmitted to the circadian clock to modulate developmental responses such as 
flowering time. Blue-light-sensing cryptochromes, the E3 ubiquitin-ligase COP1, 
and clock-associated proteins ELF3 and GI regulate this process, although the 
regulatory link between them is unclear. Here we present data showing that COP1 
acts with ELF3 to mediate day length signaling from CRY2 to GI within the 
photoperiod flowering pathway. We found that COP1 and ELF3 interact in vivo and 
show that ELF3 allows COP1 to interact with GI in vivo, leading to GI 
degradation in planta. Accordingly, mutation of COP1 or ELF3 disturbs the 
pattern of GI cyclic accumulation. We propose a model in which ELF3 acts as a 
substrate adaptor, enabling COP1 to modulate light input signal to the circadian 
clock through targeted destabilization of GI.

INTRODUCTION

Resetting (or synchronization) of the circadian clock to day-night cycles is essential in most flowering plants, since floral transition is mainly triggered by seasonal changes in photoperiod ( Yanovsky and Kay, 2003 ). Based on their responsiveness to day lengths in the promotion of flowering, plants can be classified as long-day (LD), short-day (SD) and day-neutral plants. Arabidopsis is a facultative LD plant that flowers much earlier and with fewer leaves in LD (16 hr light/8 hr dark; 16L/8D) than in SD (8L/16D) ( Simpson et al., 1999 ). Clock resetting by day length is mediated by members of the ZEITLUPE (ZTL), FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1) and LOV, KELCH PROTEIN 2 (LKP2) protein family ( Nelson et al., 2000 ; Schultz et al., 2001 ; Somers et al., 2000 ). ZTL and FKF1 act as blue light receptors that interact with GIGANTEA (GI), a clock-associated protein whose accumulation is tightly controlled at both transcriptional and post-translational levels ( Fowler et al., 1999 ; Kim et al., 2007 ; David et al., 2006 ; Sawa et al., 2007 ). Indeed, blue light stabilizes the FKF-GI and ZTL-GI interactions, allowing these complexes to regulate flowering time and circadian rhythms by controlling protein stability of a floral repressor CYCLING DOF FACTOR 1 (CDF1) and a circadian oscillator component TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1), respectively ( Imaizumi et al., 2005 ; Kim et al., 2007 ; Más et al., 2003 ; Sawa et al., 2007 ). Two additional classes of photoreceptors, the red/far-red light sensing phytochromes (Phy) and the blue/UVA-light sensing cryptochromes (CRY), enable clock resetting to day-night cycles in Arabidopsis ( Somers et al., 1998 ). However, their regulatory mechanisms in controlling light input to the clock are not well understood.

The clock itself regulates light resetting of the oscillator by limiting the timing of maximum responsiveness to light to specific day periods, a phenomenon commonly referred to as gating ( Millar and Kay, 1996 ). EARLY FLOWERING 3 ( ELF3 ) is a clock-associated gene that plays a pivotal role in the circadian gating pathway ( Hicks et al., 1996 ; McWatters et al., 2000 ). Thus, ELF3 rhythmically inhibits the activity of the light input pathways around dusk by reducing clock sensitivity to light resetting at this phase. However, the molecular mechanism on how ELF3 product modulates this process remains largely unknown. ELF3 encodes a nuclear protein of unknown biochemical activity which has been proposed to act as a transcriptional regulator to control the period length of expression of clock-controlled genes, including flowering-time regulators ( Liu et al., 2001 ). Thus, lesions in ELF3 cause both early flowering, possibly by increased accumulation of transcripts of floral inducers such as CONSTANS ( CO ) and GI , and arrhythmic expression of a morning-specific clock regulated gene CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING 2 ( CAB2 ) and an oscillator component LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL ( LHY ) ( Hicks et al., 2001 ; Kim et al., 2005 ; Schaffer et al., 1998 ; Suárez-López et al., 2001 ).

CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 ( COP1 ) is also related to the control of light input to the clock, participating in the modulation of circadian rhythms and flowering transition in Arabidopsis . Weak mutations in COP1 have no effect on flowering time under LD but cause early flowering under SD, which is referred to as photoperiod-insensitive early flowering ( McNellis et al., 1994 ). In addition, weak cop1 mutants display period-shortening of clock-controlled gene expression ( Millar et al., 1995 ). COP1 was first identified in Arabidopsis as a repressor of seedling photomorphogenesis in darkness ( Deng et al., 1991 ). Indeed, COP1 acts as a RING-type E3 ubiquitin-ligase that mediates ubiquitination and targeted degradation of positive regulators of light signal transduction in dark conditions ( Yi and Deng, 2005 ). This process is most likely repressed by physical interaction of CRY with COP1 under light conditions ( Wang et al., 2001 ; Yang et al., 2001 ). It has been recently shown that COP1 represses flowering by promoting degradation of CO through the proteasome during the night ( Jang et al., 2008 ; Liu et al., 2008 ). However, control of CO stability neither explains COP1 function on clock synchronization nor fully demonstrates COP1 implication in flowering-time control.

Here, we report that COP1 and ELF3 function towards GI destabilization plays an important role in the regulation of light input signaling to the clock and the control of the expression modes of flowering-time genes. Our findings provide new insights as to how the temporal information of seasonal changes in day lengths is transferred from photoreceptors to the circadian clock to allow clock resetting and the transition to flowering in higher plants.

DISCUSSION

The regulatory mechanism that limits light input to the circadian clock is not well understood. CRY and ELF3 play opposite regulatory roles in this process, although the molecular basis of their function is unknown. In this study, we describe a regulatory mechanism that links COP1, an E3 Ub-ligase negatively controlled by CRY through direct interaction ( Yang et al., 2001 ; Wang et al., 2001 ), and ELF3 with the control of GI stability to regulate clock resetting and photoperiodic flowering. Several pieces of evidence support this mechanism: First, similarly to ELF3 , COP1 acts downstream of CRY2 , but independently of PhyA and PhyB , to confer photoperiodic information to the clock for the promotion of flowering ( Table S1 ; Liu et al., 2001 ). Second, as in the case of elf3 , cop1 mutation causes circadian dysfunction that consequently affects the rhythmic expression of photoperiod-responsive genes, such as GI , CO , and FT ( Figure 3 ; Kim et al., 2005 ; Suárez-López et al., 2001 ). Noticeably, both cop1 and elf3 mutations also reduce the transcript levels of FLC ( Figure 3F ), a repressor of flowering in the autonomous pathway, recently identified as a clock regulator ( Edwards et al., 2006 ). This result is in accordance with a previous report showing that ELF3 represses flowering, in part, through a CO -independent mechanism ( Kim et al., 2005 ). Third, rescue of photoperiod-insensitive flowering in cop1 mutants grown under reduced photoperiodic conditions depends on ELF3 function ( Figure 2 ). Fourth, COP1 interacts with ELF3 in vivo ( Figure 4C and 6C ), and furthermore, COP1 activity is required for ELF3 function in the control of flowering time and circadian gene expression ( Figure 5 ). Lastly, both COP1 and ELF3 physically interact with the same downstream target, GI, and control its accumulation in vivo, helping thus to shape the circadian oscillation pattern of GI ( Figure 6 ).

GI accumulation follows the circadian pattern of its gene expression, which shows a peak in the late afternoon. At night, GI becomes destabilized through a proteasome-mediated process ( David et al., 2006 ), which coincides with high accumulation of COP1 and ELF3 in the nucleus ( Liu et al., 2001 ; von Arnim and Deng, 1994 ). Since function of GI-containing complexes, ZTL-GI and FKF1-GI, in the control of clock oscillation and photoperiodic flowering largely depends on the pattern of GI accumulation ( Kim et al., 2007 ; Sawa et al., 2007 ), a negative control of GI stability by full activities of COP1 and ELF3 represents a plausible direct mechanism by which these two proteins regulate light input signaling to the circadian clock to repress flowering under SD conditions ( Figure 7A ). Therefore, based on our results, we propose that COP1 and ELF3 coordinately regulate flowering time and circadian rhythms by modulating the biological activity of GI on light-input signaling to the circadian clock ( Figure 7A ). Thus, the temporal COP1-ELF3-GI interaction and subsequent rapid degradation of GI at night may be crucial to shape the circadian profile of GI accumulation. In this way, COP1 and ELF3 would play a regulatory role in determining the unfavorable photoperiods for flowering, by preventing the incorrect timing of CO expression. In this scenario, antagonistic action of CRY2 and COP1 on GI degradation must be essential for the regulation of circadian expression of flowering-time genes downstream of GI . Further studies should shed light on the molecular mechanism that underlies CRY control of COP1 function towards ELF3 and GI.

By allowing COP1 and GI interaction, ELF3 likely acts as a substrate adaptor for COP1 action on GI in a concentration-dependent manner. Accordingly to this idea, ELF3 overexpression causes late flowering in a WT background ( Figure 5D ), possibly by promoting constitutive degradation of GI in the presence of physiological levels of COP1 ( Figure 6D , lane 3). It has been shown that proteins modulating the activity of E3 Ub-ligases, such as substrate adaptors, can be also ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (for a review, see Wu et al., 2006 ). Thus, ELF3-mediated interaction of COP1 with GI may result in degradation of not only the protein target GI, but also of the substrate adaptor ELF3. Indeed, we found that COP1 ubiquitinates ELF3 in vitro and triggers its degradation in vivo ( Figures 4D and 4E ). This regulatory process might prevent the endless recycling of active ELF3 and thereby limit the temporal extent of ELF3 function, helping thus to ensure circadian activation of ELF3. In agreement with this idea, we found that COP1 modulates rhythmic accumulation of ELF3, at least under SD conditions ( Figure 5 ).

Finally, it has been recently shown that COP1 ubiquitinates and triggers proteasomal degradation of floral inducer CO, especially during nighttime in SD ( Jang et al., 2008 ; Liu et al., 2008 ). In this process, blue-light active CRY likely stabilize CO by inhibiting COP1, in agreement with previous results showing that CO accumulates under blue light conditions and is degraded in darkness ( Valverde et al., 2004 ). CO accumulation at night is required for FT expression and flowering transition under LD inductive conditions. COP1 role in the control of CO stability may help to explain why the photoperiod-insensitive phenotype of cop1 mutants was not fully reverted when grown under reduced photoperiod conditions that closely match their internal circadian period ( Figure 2 ). Based on these facts, COP1 regulation of CO activity, to repress flowering, would imply control of CO expression at the transcriptional level, through an ELF3-mediated pathway involving GI inactivation, and secondly, at the post-translational level by directly controlling CO stability ( Figure 7B ).
