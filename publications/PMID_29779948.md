Degrons are minimal elements that mediate the interaction of proteins with 
degradation machineries to promote proteolysis. Despite their central role in 
proteostasis, the number of known degrons remains small, and a facile technology 
to characterize them is lacking. Using a strategy combining global protein 
stability (GPS) profiling with a synthetic human peptidome, we identify 
thousands of peptides containing degron activity. Employing CRISPR screening, we 
establish that the stability of many proteins is regulated through degrons 
located at their C terminus. We characterize eight Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin 
ligase (CRL) complex adaptors that regulate C-terminal degrons, including six 
CRL2 and two CRL4 complexes, and computationally implicate multiple non-CRLs in 
end recognition. Proteome analysis revealed that the C termini of eukaryotic 
proteins are depleted for C-terminal degrons, suggesting an E3-ligase-dependent 
modulation of proteome composition. Thus, we propose that a series of "C-end 
rules" operate to govern protein stability and shape the eukaryotic proteome.
