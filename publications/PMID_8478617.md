The transmembrane receptor for immunoglobulin G immune complexes on natural 
killer (NK) cells and macrophages, Fc gamma RIIIA (CD16), mediates cellular 
activation through a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway. We show that Fc gamma 
RIII crosslinking results in activation of the src-related kinase p56lck in NK 
cells and demonstrate a physical association of p56lck with Fc gamma RIIIA in 
immunoprecipitates from NK cells obtained using anti-Fc gamma RIII antibodies or 
immune complexes. Our studies show that the zeta chain, the signal transducing 
subunit of Fc gamma RIIIA and of T cell receptor, associates with p56lck and, in 
NK cells, is a substrate for this kinase. Such direct association of p56lck with 
the zeta subunit as confirmed by demonstrating the interaction in heterologous 
cells transfected with cDNA expressing p56lck and zeta. Our findings demonstrate 
both functional and physical association of p56lck with Fc gamma RIIIA, through 
direct interaction of the kinase with the zeta and/or the gamma signal 
transducer subunits of the receptor. These data suggest a possible mechanism by 
which activation via Fc gamma RIIIA occurs.
