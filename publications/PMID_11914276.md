Protein localization data are a valuable information resource helpful in 
elucidating eukaryotic protein function. Here, we report the first 
proteome-scale analysis of protein localization within any eukaryote. Using 
directed topoisomerase I-mediated cloning strategies and genome-wide transposon 
mutagenesis, we have epitope-tagged 60% of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
proteome. By high-throughput immunolocalization of tagged gene products, we have 
determined the subcellular localization of 2744 yeast proteins. Extrapolating 
these data through a computational algorithm employing Bayesian formalism, we 
define the yeast localizome (the subcellular distribution of all 6100 yeast 
proteins). We estimate the yeast proteome to encompass approximately 5100 
soluble proteins and >1000 transmembrane proteins. Our results indicate that 47% 
of yeast proteins are cytoplasmic, 13% mitochondrial, 13% exocytic (including 
proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum and secretory vesicles), and 27% 
nuclear/nucleolar. A subset of nuclear proteins was further analyzed by 
immunolocalization using surface-spread preparations of meiotic chromosomes. Of 
these proteins, 38% were found associated with chromosomal DNA. As determined 
from phenotypic analyses of nuclear proteins, 34% are essential for spore 
viability--a percentage nearly twice as great as that observed for the proteome 
as a whole. In total, this study presents experimentally derived localization 
data for 955 proteins of previously unknown function: nearly half of all 
functionally uncharacterized proteins in yeast. To facilitate access to these 
data, we provide a searchable database featuring 2900 fluorescent micrographs at 
http://ygac.med.yale.edu.
