Comment in
    Circ Res. 2007 May 25;100(10):1389-93. doi:

Essential hypertension remains a major risk factor for cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular diseases. As a complex multifactorial disease, elucidation of 
susceptibility loci remains elusive. ATP1A1 and Dear are candidate genes for 2 
closely linked rat chromosome-2 blood pressure quantitative trait loci. Because 
corresponding human syntenic regions are on different chromosomes, investigation 
of ATP1A1 (chromosome [chr]-1p21) and Dear (chr-4q31.3) facilitates genetic 
analyses of each blood pressure quantitative trait locus in human hypertension. 
Here we report the association of human ATP1A1 (P<0.000005) and Dear (P<0.03) 
with hypertension in a relatively isolated, case/control hypertension cohort 
from northern Sardinia by single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotype analysis. 
Sex-specific haplotype analyses detected stronger association of both loci with 
hypertension in males than in females. Haplotype trend-regression analyses 
support ATP1A1 and Dear as independent susceptibility loci and reveal 
haplotype-specific association with hypertension and normotension, thus 
delineating haplotype-specific subsets of hypertension. Although investigation 
in other cohorts needs to be performed to determine genetic effects in other 
populations, haplotype subtyping already allows systematic stratification of 
susceptibility and, hence, clinical heterogeneity, a prerequisite for unraveling 
the polygenic etiology and polygene-environment interactions in essential 
hypertension. As hypertension susceptibility genes, coexpression of ATP1A1 and 
Dear in both renal tubular cells and vascular endothelium suggest a cellular 
pathogenic scaffold for polygenic mechanisms of hypertension, as well as the 
hypothesis that ATP1A1 and/or Dear could contribute to the known renal and 
vascular endothelial dysfunction associated with essential (polygenic) 
hypertension.
