Rab GTPases and their effectors facilitate vesicular transport by tethering 
donor vesicles to their respective target membranes. Rab9 mediates late endosome 
to trans-Golgi transport and has recently been found to be a key cellular 
component for human immunodeficiency virus-1, Ebola, Marburg, and measles virus 
replication, suggesting that it may be a novel target in the development of 
broad spectrum antiviral drugs. As part of our structure-based drug design 
program, we have determined the crystal structure of a C-terminally truncated 
human Rab9 (residues 1-177) to 1.25-A resolution. The overall structure shows a 
characteristic nucleotide binding fold consisting of a six-stranded beta-sheet 
surrounded by five alpha-helices with a tightly bound GDP molecule in the active 
site. Structure-based sequence alignment of Rab9 with other Rab proteins reveals 
that its active site consists of residues highly conserved in the Rab GTPase 
family, implying a common catalytic mechanism. However, Rab9 contains seven 
regions that are significantly different in conformation from other Rab 
proteins. Some of those regions coincide with putative effector-binding sites 
and switch I and switch II regions identified by structure/sequence alignments. 
The Rab9 structure at near atomic resolution provides an excellent model for 
structure-based antiviral drug design.
