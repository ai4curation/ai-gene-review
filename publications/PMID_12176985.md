Many features of the chaperone action of clusterin are similar to those of the 
intracellular small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) that, like clusterin, exist in 
solution as heterogeneous aggregates. Increased temperature induces dissociation 
of some sHSP aggregates and an enhanced chaperone action, suggesting that a 
dissociated form is the active chaperone species. We recently reported that 
clusterin aggregates dissociate at mildly acidic pH. To further explore the 
similarities between clusterin and the sHSPs, we tested the effects of 
temperature and pH on the structure of clusterin and its chaperone action. Our 
results demonstrate that increased temperature does not induce dissociation of 
clusterin aggregates, or other major structural changes, and has little effect 
on its chaperone action. However, we show that the chaperone action of clusterin 
is enhanced at mildly acidic pH. Clusterin is the first chaperone shown to be 
activated by reduced pH. This unique mode of activation appears to result from 
an increase in regions of solvent-exposed hydrophobicity, which is independent 
of any major changes in secondary or tertiary structure. We propose a model in 
which low pH-induced dissociation of clusterin aggregates increases the 
abundance of the heterodimeric chaperone-active species, which has greater 
hydrophobicity exposed to solution.
