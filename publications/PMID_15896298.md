The beta-amyloids (abetas) are the major components of the plaque observed in 
the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The conundrum is that although 
they are produced in everyone during the posttranslational processing in the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), deposits are 
only observed in the elderly. Our work suggests that normals have a carrier 
protein(s) keeping them in solution. Based on immunoblotting studies of 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from normals, we find that the bulk of the abetas are 
bound to the ER chaperones, ERp57 and calreticulin, suggesting that these may be 
carrier proteins which prevent aggregation of the abetas and that the deposits 
are due to faulty ER posttranslational processing of APP with the failure to 
form this complex. If membrane protein synthesis is similarly affected, it could 
explain the neuronal dysfunction characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.
