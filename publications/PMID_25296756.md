Human plasminogen kringle 5 (K5) is known to display its potent 
anti-angiogenesis effect through inducing endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis, and 
the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) has been identified as a receptor 
of K5. However, the exact role and underlying mechanisms of VDAC1 in K5-induced 
EC apoptosis remain elusive. In the current study, we showed that K5 increased 
the protein level of VDAC1, which initiated the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway 
of ECs. Our findings also showed that K5 inhibited the ubiquitin-dependent 
degradation of VDAC1 by promoting the phosphorylation of VDAC1, possibly at 
Ser-12 and Thr-107. The phosphorylated VDAC1 was attenuated by the AKT agonist, 
glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β inhibitor, and siRNA, suggesting that K5 
increased VDAC1 phosphorylation via the AKT-GSK3β pathway. Furthermore, K5 
promoted cell surface translocation of VDAC1, and binding between K5 and VDAC1 
was observed on the plasma membrane. HKI protein blocked the impact of K5 on the 
AKT-GSK3β pathway by competitively inhibiting the interaction of K5 and cell 
surface VDAC1. Moreover, K5-induced EC apoptosis was suppressed by VDAC1 
antibody. These data show for the first time that K5-induced EC apoptosis is 
mediated by the positive feedback loop of "VDAC1-AKT-GSK3β-VDAC1," which may 
provide new perspectives on the mechanisms of K5-induced apoptosis.
