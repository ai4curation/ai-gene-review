Integrin alpha x (ITGAX), a member of the integrin family, usually serves as a 
receptor of the extracellular matrix. Recently, accumulating evidence suggests 
that ITGAX may be involved in angiogenesis in dendritic cells. Herein, we report 
a direct role of ITGAX in angiogenesis during tumor development. Overexpression 
of ITGAX in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) enhanced their 
proliferation, migration, and tube formation and promoted xenograft ovarian 
tumor angiogenesis and growth. Further study showed that overexpression of ITGAX 
activated the PI3k/Akt pathway, leading to the enhanced expression of c-Myc, 
vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), 
whereas, the treatment of cells with PI3K inhibitor diminished these effects. 
Besides, c-Myc was observed to bind to the VEGF-A promoter. By 
Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay, we manifested the interaction between 
ITGAX and VEGFR2 or the phosphorylated VEGFR2. Immunostaining of human ovarian 
cancer specimens suggested that endothelial cells of micro-blood vessels 
displayed strong expression of VEGF-A, c-Myc, VEGFR2, and the PI3K signaling 
molecules. Also, overexpression of ITGAX in HUVECs could stimulate the spheroid 
formation of ovarian cancer cells. Our study uncovered that ITGAX stimulates 
angiogenesis through the PI3K/Akt signaling-mediated VEGFR2/VEGF-A 
overexpression during cancer development.
