Caspases play important roles in regulating apoptotic signaling pathways. Here 
we report the cloning, by the yeast two hybrid system with dominant negative 
caspase-2 as "bait," of a proapoptotic molecule named proapoptotic caspase 
adaptor protein (PACAP), encoded by a 372-base pair open reading frame. Binding 
of this novel protein to caspase-2 (casp-2) was confirmed in yeast two hybrid, 
in vitro, and in vivo assays. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed homology 
to functional motifs, including ATP and cytochrome c binding sites. PACAP mRNA 
was widely expressed in most human tissues; in transfected cells, PACAP was 
diffusely expressed in the cytoplasm. Bindings studies with the PACAP 
recombinant protein demonstrated specific binding to casp-2 and casp-9 but not 
to casp-3, -4, -7, or -8 in cell extracts. Cotransfection experiments showed 
that PACAP binds to casp-2 and -9 in 293T cells. In addition, studies with 
truncated PACAP demonstrated a requirement for residues 39-72 of PACAP for 
specific binding to casp-2 and -9. Transient transfection of PACAP into 293T 
human kidney cells and rat-1 fibroblasts triggered apoptosis at 24 h, which was 
at least in part prevented by an inhibitor of casp-3-like enzymes. Transfection 
of PACAP into human B cell lines using a retroviral system also triggered 
apoptotic cell death. In addition, transcription of PACAP in primary human B 
cells was dramatically down-regulated early after cellular activation by CD40L 
and Staphylococcus aureus and markedly up-regulated as the cells apoptose. These 
findings identify a novel proapoptotic caspase adaptor protein.
