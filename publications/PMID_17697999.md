Crystallographic studies showed that epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor 
activation involves major domain rearrangements. Without bound ligand, the 
extracellular region of the receptor (sEGFR) adopts a "tethered" configuration 
with its dimerization site occluded by apparently autoinhibitory intramolecular 
interactions. Ligand binding causes the receptor to become "extended," breaking 
the tether and exposing the dimerization site. Using small-angle X-ray 
scattering (SAXS), we confirm that the tethered and extended conformations are 
also adopted in solution, and we describe low-resolution molecular envelopes for 
an intact sEGFR dimer. We also use SAXS to monitor directly the transition from 
a tethered to extended configuration in the monomeric extracellular regions of 
ErbB3 and a dimerization-defective EGFR mutant. Finally, we show that mutating 
every intramolecular tether interaction in sEGFR does not greatly alter its 
conformation. These findings explain why tether mutants fail to activate EGF 
receptor and provide new insight into regulation of ErbB receptor conformation.
