We have cloned and characterized a human cDNA that belongs to the histone 
deacetylase family, which we designate as HDAC11. The predicted HDAC11 amino 
acid sequence reveals an open reading frame of 347 residues with a corresponding 
molecular mass of 39 kDa. Sequence analyses of the putative HDAC11 protein 
indicate that it contains conserved residues in the catalytic core regions 
shared by both class I and II mammalian HDAC enzymes. Putative orthologues of 
HDAC11 exist in primate, mouse, Drosophila, and plant. Epitope-tagged HDAC11 
protein expressed in mammalian cells displays histone deacetylase activity in 
vitro. Furthermore, HDAC11's enzymatic activity is inhibited by trapoxin, a 
known histone deacetylase inhibitor. Multiple tissue Northern blot and real-time 
PCR experiments show that the high expression level of HDAC11 transcripts is 
limited to kidney, heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and testis. Epitope-tagged 
HDAC11 protein localizes predominantly to the cell nucleus. 
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that HDAC11 may be present in 
protein complexes that also contain HDAC6. These results indicate that HDAC11 is 
a novel and unique member of the histone deacetylase family and it may have 
distinct physiological roles from those of the known HDACs.
