Nuclear respiratory-deficient mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (pet mutants) 
have been screened for defects in the mitochondrial ATPase. Mutants in two 
complementation groups were found to have 10% or less of wild-type ATPase 
activity. The two wild-type nuclear genes defined by the mutants have been 
designated ATP11 and ATP12. The proteins encoded by the two genes are not 
subunits of the ATPase but rather appear to exercise an important function at a 
late stage in the synthesis of F1 after transport of the subunits into the 
internal compartment of mitochondria. Mitochondria of atp11 and atp12 mutants 
have only marginally reduced levels of the alpha and beta subunits of F1. Both 
proteins are processed to their mature size but are not part of a native F1 
structure or associated with the mitochondrial membrane. The most reasonable 
explanation for the mutant phenotype is a block in the assembly of the F1 
oligomer.
