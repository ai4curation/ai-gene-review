GCNA proteins are expressed across eukarya in pluripotent cells and have 
conserved functions in fertility. GCNA homologs Spartan (DVC-1) and Wss1 resolve 
DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs), including Topoisomerase-DNA adducts, during DNA 
replication. Here, we show that GCNA mutants in mouse and C. elegans display 
defects in genome maintenance including DNA damage, aberrant chromosome 
condensation, and crossover defects in mouse spermatocytes and spontaneous 
genomic rearrangements in C. elegans. We show that GCNA and topoisomerase II 
(TOP2) physically interact in both mice and worms and colocalize on condensed 
chromosomes during mitosis in C. elegans embryos. Moreover, C. elegans gcna-1 
mutants are hypersensitive to TOP2 poison. Together, our findings support a 
model in which GCNA provides genome maintenance functions in the germline and 
may do so, in part, by promoting the resolution of TOP2 DPCs.
