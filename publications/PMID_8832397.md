The KAL gene is responsible for the X-chromosome linked form of Kallmann's 
syndrome in humans. Upon transfection of CHO cells with a human KAL cDNA, the 
corresponding encoded protein, KALc, was produced. This protein is 
N-glycosylated, secreted in the cell culture medium, and is localized at the 
cell surface. Several lines of evidence indicate that heparan-sulfate chains of 
proteoglycan(s) are involved in the binding of KALc to the cell membrane. 
Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the purified KALc were generated. They 
allowed us to detect and characterize the protein encoded by the KAL gene in the 
chicken central nervous system at late stages of embryonic development. This 
protein is synthesized by definite neuronal cell populations including Purkinje 
cells in the cerebellum, mitral cells in the olfactory bulbs and several 
subpopulations in the optic tectum and the striatum. The protein, with an 
approximate molecular mass of 100 kDa, was named anosmin-1 in reference to the 
deficiency of the sense of smell which characterizes the human disease. 
Anosmin-1 is likely to be an extracellular matrix component. Since heparin 
treatment of cell membrane fractions from cerebellum and tectum resulted in the 
release of the protein, we suggest that one or several heparan-sulfate 
proteoglycans are involved in the binding of anosmin-1 to the membranes in vivo.
