The activity of the dual-specificity receptor kinase, brassinosteroid 
insensitive 1 (BRI1), reflects the balance between phosphorylation-dependent 
activation and several potential mechanisms for deactivation of the receptor. In 
the present report, we elucidate a unique mechanism for deactivation that 
involves autophosphorylation of serine-891 in the ATP-binding domain. Serine-891 
was identified previously as a potential site of autophosphorylation by mass 
spectrometry, and sequence-specific antibodies and mutagenesis studies now 
unambiguously establish phosphorylation of this residue. In vivo, 
phosphorylation of serine-891 increased slowly with time following application 
of brassinolide (BL) to Arabidopsis seedlings, whereas phosphorylation of 
threonine residues increased rapidly and then remained constant. Transgenic 
plants expressing the BRI1(S891A)-Flag-directed mutant have increased hypocotyl 
and petiole lengths, relative to wild-type BRI1-Flag (both in the bri1-5 
background), and accumulate higher levels of the unphosphorylated form of the 
BES1 transcription factor in response to exogenous BL. In contrast, plants 
expressing the phosphomimetic S891D-directed mutant are severely dwarfed and do 
not accumulate unphosphorylated BES1 in response to BL. Collectively, these 
results suggest that autophosphorylation of serine-891 is one of the 
deactivation mechanisms that inhibit BRI1 activity and BR signaling in vivo. 
Many arginine-aspartate (RD)-type leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases have 
a phosphorylatable residue within the ATP-binding domain, suggesting that this 
mechanism may play a broad role in receptor kinase deactivation.

Abstract

The activity of the dual-specificity receptor kinase, brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1), reflects the balance between phosphorylation-dependent activation and several potential mechanisms for deactivation of the receptor. In the present report, we elucidate a unique mechanism for deactivation that involves autophosphorylation of serine-891 in the ATP-binding domain. Serine-891 was identified previously as a potential site of autophosphorylation by mass spectrometry, and sequence-specific antibodies and mutagenesis studies now unambiguously establish phosphorylation of this residue. In vivo, phosphorylation of serine-891 increased slowly with time following application of brassinolide (BL) to Arabidopsis seedlings, whereas phosphorylation of threonine residues increased rapidly and then remained constant. Transgenic plants expressing the BRI1(S891A)–Flag-directed mutant have increased hypocotyl and petiole lengths, relative to wild-type BRI1–Flag (both in the bri1-5 background), and accumulate higher levels of the unphosphorylated form of the BES1 transcription factor in response to exogenous BL. In contrast, plants expressing the phosphomimetic S891D-directed mutant are severely dwarfed and do not accumulate unphosphorylated BES1 in response to BL. Collectively, these results suggest that autophosphorylation of serine-891 is one of the deactivation mechanisms that inhibit BRI1 activity and BR signaling in vivo. Many arginine-aspartate (RD)-type leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases have a phosphorylatable residue within the ATP-binding domain, suggesting that this mechanism may play a broad role in receptor kinase deactivation.

Discussion

The most important result of the present study is the demonstration that phosphorylation of BRI1 at serine-891 in the ATP-binding domain occurs in vivo, which attenuates signaling and thus appears to function as a deactivation mechanism. Phosphorylation at the serine-891 site was established with sequence- and phosphorylation-specific antibodies, and the functional significance of this modification was assessed by site-directed mutagenesis to alanine, to eliminate phosphorylation, or aspartate, to mimic constitutive phosphorylation. Results with the corresponding mutants (i.e., S891A and S891D) expressed as recombinant proteins indicated that the serine-to-aspartate substitution strongly inhibits both autophosphorylation of BRI1 ( Fig. 1 C ) and transphosphorylation of the SP11 synthetic peptide ( Fig. 1 D ). Interestingly, the glycine-rich G-loop of BRI1 could accommodate a wide range of amino acids at the 891 position without impact on autophosphorylation ( Fig. 2 ), indicating that the region was not a highly constrained structure that could not tolerate substitutions. Thus, the inhibition of kinase activity by acidic substitutions for serine-891 likely reflects their action as phosphomimetics rather than simply causing nonspecific alterations. However, aspartate had a greater effect than glutamate, indicating that factors in addition to negative charge are important. Nonetheless, given that an acid residue at the 891 position inhibits autophosphorylation, in particular on tyrosine residues ( Fig. S2 ), it is reasonable to expect that phosphorylation of the naturally occurring serine residue at this position in wild-type BRI1 would also have an inhibitory effect on autophosphorylation.

The notion that phosphorylation of serine-891 is one of the deactivation mechanisms that reduces BR signaling in vivo is suggested by several lines of evidence. First, expression of BRI1(S891A)–Flag in the bri1-5 background resulted in plants with elongated petioles and hypocotyls relative to plants expressing native-sequence BRI1–Flag, whereas expression of the S891D-directed mutant had the opposite effect and resulted in severely dwarfed plants with short petioles and hypocotyls ( Fig. 4 ). Second, exogenous BL induced greater accumulation of the unphosphorylated form of BES1 in plants expressing the S891A-directed mutant compared with native sequence BRI1–Flag ( Fig. 4 C ), which is consistent with the phenotypic analysis of these plants. Third, the slow time-dependent phosphorylation of BRI1 at the serine-891 site was distinct from the more rapid phosphorylation on threonine residues, which is associated with activation of kinase activity ( Fig. 3 ). Interestingly, phosphorylation at the threonine-872 site followed similar kinetics to overall phosphothreonine with rapid phosphorylation following BL addition ( Fig. 3 ). Thus, if phosphorylation of threonine-872 inhibits BRI1 kinase activity as speculated ( 23 ), the effect is distinct from the phosphorylation of serine-891, which inhibits BRI1 kinase activity and attenuates BR signaling in vivo, likely in a time-dependent manner. It is also interesting that phosphorylation at the serine-891 site is not completely removed after 4 d of treatment with Brz, whereas threonine phosphosites are completely dephosphorylated ( Fig. 3 ). Whether these responses reflect different rates of dephosphorylation by endogenous protein phosphatases remains an important question for future studies. However, the fact that the phosphoserine-891 site is not dephosphorylated in vivo as completely as phosphothreonine sites has implications for subsequent cycles of activation/deactivation of this relatively long-lived receptor kinase and likely explains the enhanced signaling phenotype of the S891A-directed mutant. Thus, the deactivation associated with serine-891 phosphorylation seems to play a role in attenuation of signaling rather than maintaining the inactive state of BRI1 in the absence of its hormone ligand.

One might suspect that phosphorylation of a residue within the ATP-binding domain would cause steric or electrostatic interference with ATP binding or positioning and thereby inhibit kinase activity. Indeed, cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) are regulated in part by inhibitory phosphorylation of conserved residues within the active site. Detailed studies with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) demonstrated that phosphorylation of threonine-14 and tyrosine-15 within the glycine-rich loop ( G E G TY G VVY) inhibits kinase activity by interfering with peptide substrate binding and alters, but does not prevent, ATP binding ( 32 ). With the CDKs, the inhibitory phosphorylation within the ATP-binding domain is catalyzed by other kinases, whereas with BRI1 the inhibitory modification is an autophosphorylation reaction. However, the possibility that other kinases also contribute in vivo to phosphorylation of BRI1 at the serine-891 site cannot be ruled out. At the position corresponding to s erine-891 in BRI1 ( G S G XX G XV), 16 other RD-type leucine-rich receptor–receptor-like kinases (LRR–RLKs) in Arabidopsis have a phosphorylatable residue at this position ( Table S1 ), suggesting that this mechanism may occur in other receptor kinases. Fifty-eight LRR-RLKs have a basic residue at the position corresponding to serine-891 in BRI1. If a positive side chain is tolerated at this position, then it is reasonable that a negatively charged phosphoserine would not be tolerated. One other interesting point to note is that 24 other receptor kinases have an acidic residue at this position, which suggests that the intrinsic kinase activity of these receptors may be at least partially down-regulated. However, 23 of the 24 receptor kinases have a glutamate residue, which at least within the BRI1 sequence, caused less inhibition than did an aspartate residue. Thus, to the known mechanisms of deactivation of receptor kinases such as endocytosis and dephosphorylation of essential residues, we can also now include phosphorylation of inhibitory sites such as serine-891 in the ATP-binding domain of BRI1, although future studies will be required to determine the relative timing and importance of each of these mechanisms.
