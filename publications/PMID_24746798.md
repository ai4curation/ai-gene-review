Specialized ribonucleoprotein organelles collectively known as germ granules are 
found in the germline cytoplasm from worms to humans [1]. In Drosophila, germ 
granules have been implicated in germline determination [2]. C. elegans germ 
granules, known as P granules, do not appear to be required for primordial germ 
cell (PGC) determination [3], but their components are still needed for 
fertility [4-6]. One potential role for P granules is to maintain germline fate 
and totipotency. This is suggested by the loss of P granules from germ cells 
that transform into somatic cell types, e.g., in germlines lacking MEX-3 and 
GLD-1 or upon neuronal induction by CHE-1 [7, 8]. However, it has not been 
established whether loss of P granules is the cause or effect of cell fate 
transformation. To test cause and effect, we severely compromised P granules by 
simultaneously knocking down factors that nucleate granule formation (PGL-1 and 
PGL-3) and promote their perinuclear localization (GLH-1 and GLH-4) [9] and 
investigated whether this causes germ cells to lose totipotency and initiate 
somatic reprogramming. We found that compromising P granules causes germ cells 
to express neuronal and muscle markers and send out neurite-like projections, 
suggesting that P granules maintain totipotency and germline identity by 
antagonizing somatic fate.
