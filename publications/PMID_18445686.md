Assembly of the mitotic spindle requires a global change in the activity and 
constitution of the microtubule-binding-protein array at mitotic onset. An 
important subset of mitotic microtubule-binding proteins localises to the 
nucleus in interphase and essentially contributes to spindle formation and 
function after nuclear envelope breakdown. Here, we used a proteomic approach to 
selectively identify proteins of this category and revealed 50 poorly 
characterised human gene products, among them the echinoderm 
microtubule-associated-protein-like gene product, EML3. Indirect 
immunofluorescence showed that EML3 colocalises with spindle microtubules 
throughout all mitotic stages. In interphase, EML3 colocalised with cytoplasmic 
microtubules and accumulated in interphase nuclei. Using YFP-fusion constructs 
of EML3, we located a nuclear localisation signal and confirmed the 
microtubule-binding domain of EML3. Functional analysis of EML3 using time-lapse 
fluorescence microscopy and detailed end-point analysis of phenotypes after 
siRNA knockdown demonstrates an important role for EML3 in correct metaphase 
chromosome alignment. Our proteomic identification screen combined with 
sensitive phenotypic analysis therefore provides a reliable platform for the 
identification and characterisation of proteins important for correct cell 
division.
