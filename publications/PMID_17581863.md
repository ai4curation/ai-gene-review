Cilia are endowed with membrane receptors, channels, and signaling components 
whose localization and function must be tightly controlled. In primary cilia of 
mammalian kidney epithelia and sensory cilia of Caenorhabditis elegans neurons, 
polycystin-1 (PC1) and transient receptor polycystin-2 channel (TRPP2 or PC2), 
function together as a mechanosensory receptor-channel complex. Despite the 
importance of the polycystins in sensory transduction, the mechanisms that 
regulate polycystin activity and localization, or ciliary membrane receptors in 
general, remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that signal transduction 
adaptor molecule STAM-1A interacts with C. elegans LOV-1 (PC1), and that STAM 
functions with hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate 
(Hrs) on early endosomes to direct the LOV-1-PKD-2 complex for lysosomal 
degradation. In a stam-1 mutant, both LOV-1 and PKD-2 improperly accumulate at 
the ciliary base. Conversely, overexpression of STAM or Hrs promotes the removal 
of PKD-2 from cilia, culminating in sensory behavioral defects. These data 
reveal that the STAM-Hrs complex, which down-regulates ligand-activated growth 
factor receptors from the cell surface of yeast and mammalian cells, also 
regulates the localization and signaling of a ciliary PC1 receptor-TRPP2 
complex.
