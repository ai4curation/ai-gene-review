GM130 and GRASP65 are Golgi peripheral membrane proteins that play a key role in 
Golgi stacking and vesicle tethering. However, the molecular details of their 
interaction and their structural role as a functional unit remain unclear. Here, 
we present the crystal structure of the PDZ domains of GRASP65 in complex with 
the GM130 C-terminal peptide at 1.96-Å resolution. In contrast to previous 
findings proposing that GM130 interacts with GRASP65 at the PDZ2 domain only, 
our crystal structure of the complex indicates that GM130 binds to GRASP65 at 
two distinct sites concurrently and that both the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of 
GRASP65 participate in this molecular interaction. Mutagenesis experiments 
support these structural observations and demonstrate that they are required for 
GRASP65-GM130 association.
