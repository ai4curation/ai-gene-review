ADAM9 (MDC9, meltrin gamma) is a member of the ADAM family of metalloproteases, 
which play important roles in cell-cell fusion, intracellular signaling, and 
other cellular functions. Here we cloned a novel form of human ADAM9, designated 
hADAM9s (s for short), which lacks the carboxyl-terminus. Human ADAM9s was found 
to be secreted from transfected COS cells. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the 
mRNA for hADAM9s is expressed in human brain, liver, heart, kidney, lung, and 
trachea. When hADAM9s was co-expressed in COS cells with APP and treated with 
phorbol ester, the APP was digested exclusively at the alpha-secretory site. 
These results suggest that hADAM9s has an alpha-secretase-like activity for APP. 
Non-amyloidgenic cleavage of APP may occur at the plasma membrane. Our new 
results support a new therapeutic strategy to decrease in the Abeta content by 
directly activating ADAM9 in the extracellular space.
