The Coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a cell adhesion molecule that is 
highly expressed in the developing brain. CAR is enriched in growth cone 
particles (GCP) after subcellular fractionation. In GCP, we identified actin as 
an interaction partner of the cytoplasmic domain of CAR. In vivo, actin and CAR 
co-immunoprecipitate and co-localize. In vitro, the binding is direct, with a 
K(d) of approximately 2.6 microM, and leads to actin bundling. We previously 
demonstrated that CAR interacts with microtubules. These data suggest a role for 
CAR in processes requiring dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton such as 
neurite outgrowth and cell migration.
