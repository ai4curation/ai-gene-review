DNA methylation is necessary for the silencing of endogenous retrotransposons 
and the maintenance of monoallelic gene expression at imprinted loci and on the 
X chromosome. Dynamic changes in DNA methylation occur during the initial stages 
of primordial germ cell development; however, all consequences of this 
epigenetic reprogramming are not understood. DNA demethylation in postmigratory 
primordial germ cells coincides with erasure of genomic imprints and 
reactivation of the inactive X chromosome, as well as ongoing germ cell 
differentiation events. To investigate a possible role for DNA methylation 
changes in germ cell differentiation, we have studied several marker genes that 
initiate expression at this time. Here, we show that the postmigratory germ 
cell-specific genes Mvh, Dazl and Scp3 are demethylated in germ cells, but not 
in somatic cells. Premature loss of genomic methylation in Dnmt1 mutant embryos 
leads to early expression of these genes as well as GCNA1, a widely used germ 
cell marker. In addition, GCNA1 is ectopically expressed by somatic cells in 
Dnmt1 mutants. These results provide in vivo evidence that postmigratory germ 
cell-specific genes are silenced by DNA methylation in both premigratory germ 
cells and somatic cells. This is the first example of ectopic gene activation in 
Dnmt1 mutant mice and suggests that dynamic changes in DNA methylation regulate 
tissue-specific gene expression of a set of primordial germ cell-specific genes.
