Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction is a key event in the onset and progression of 
atherosclerosis. Apoptosis may lead to endothelial dysfunction and contribute to 
vascular complications. Cyclophilin A (CyPA) is the main reactive oxygen 
species-induced factor that enhances the inflammatory activity of vascular cells 
in atherosclerotic plaques. However, the mechanism by which CyPA induces EC 
apoptosis is not entirely clear. Through Western blot, it demonstrated that 
extracellular CyPA activated the Akt and NF-κB pathway, followed by the 
upregulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression in ECs. When blocking 
intracellular CyPA by small interfering RNA in ECs, the effects of TNF-α-induced 
EC apoptosis and proapoptotic protein caspase-3 expression were significantly 
inhibited. This study shows that CyPA may initiate antiapoptotic and 
proapoptotic signaling in ECs, especially in response to reactive oxygen species 
stimulation. It serves as a potential target for atherosclerosis therapy.
