The Vpr accessory protein of HIV-1 induces a response similar to that of DNA 
damage. In cells expressing Vpr, the DNA damage sensing kinase, ATR, is 
activated, resulting in G(2) arrest and apoptosis. In addition, Vpr causes rapid 
degradation of the uracil-DNA glycosylases UNG2 and SMUG1. Although several 
cellular proteins have been reported to bind to Vpr, the mechanism by which Vpr 
mediates its biological effects is unknown. Using tandem affinity purification 
and mass spectrometry, we identified a predominant cellular protein that binds 
to Vpr as the damage-specific DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1). In addition to its 
role in the repair of damaged DNA, DDB1 is a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase 
that degrades numerous cellular substrates. Interestingly, DDB1 is targeted by 
specific regulatory proteins of other viruses, including simian virus 5 and 
hepatitis B. We show that the interaction with DDB1 mediates Vpr-induced 
apoptosis and UNG2/SMUG1 degradation and impairs the repair of UV-damaged DNA, 
which could account for G(2) arrest and apoptosis. The interaction with DDB1 may 
explain several of the diverse biological functions of Vpr and suggests 
potential roles for Vpr in HIV-1 replication.
