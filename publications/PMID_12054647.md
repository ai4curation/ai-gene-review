Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) has a common MI domain sharing with death 
associated protein 5 (DAP5) and a component of eukaryotic translation initiation 
factor (eIF4G) complex and it might also work as a tumor suppressor. We could 
find that the message and product of Pdcd4 gene were up-regulated in senescent 
human diploid fibroblasts. In yeast two hybrid analysis, the C-terminal region 
of PDCD4 interacted with ribosomal protein S13 (RPS13), ribosomal protein L5 
(RPL5), and TI-227H. In in vitro binding assay, RPS13, a component of 40S 
ribosome was stably bound to PDCD4. We also found that PDCD4 was localized to 
polysome fractions. We could pull out eIF4G with GST-PDCD4, but eIF4E did not 
interact with PDCD4. From these results, we could assume that PDCD4 might 
regulate the eIF4G-dependent translation through direct interactions with eIF4G 
and RPS13 in senescent fibroblasts.
