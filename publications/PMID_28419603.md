Cell division in Escherichia coli is mediated by a large protein complex called 
the divisome. Most of the divisome proteins have been identified, but how they 
assemble onto the Z ring scaffold to form the divisome and work together to 
synthesize the septum is not well understood. In this review, we summarize the 
latest findings on divisome assembly and activation as well as provide our 
perspective on how these two processes might be regulated.
