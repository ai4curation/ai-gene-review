Previous work has shown that ablation or mutation of nonmuscle myosin heavy 
chain II-B (NMHC II-B) in mice results in defects in the heart and brain with 
death occurring between embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) and birth (Tullio, A. N., 
Accili, D., Ferrans, V. J., Yu, Z. X., Takeda, K., Grinberg, A., Westphal, H., 
Preston, Y. A., and Adelstein, R. S. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 
12407-12412). Here we show that mice ablated for NMHC II-A fail to develop a 
normal patterned embryo with a polarized visceral endoderm by E6.5 and die by 
E7.5. Moreover, A(-)/A(-) embryoid bodies grown in suspension culture constantly 
shed cells. These defects in cell adhesion and tissue organization are explained 
by loss of E-cadherin and beta-catenin localization to cell adhesion sites in 
both cell culture and in the intact embryos. The defects can be reproduced by 
introducing siRNA directed against NMHC II-A into wild-type embryonic stem 
cells. Our results suggest an essential role for a single, specific nonmuscle 
myosin isoform in maintaining cell-cell adhesions in the early mammalian embryo.
