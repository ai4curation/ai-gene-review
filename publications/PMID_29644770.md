Mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) responds to growth 
factors and nutrient availability. Amino acids induce the recruitment of mTORC1 
to the lysosomal membrane and its consequent activation, but the molecular 
mechanism of such activation has remained unclear. We have now examined the role 
of TMEM55B, a lysosomal protein of unknown molecular function, in this process 
on the basis of the results of proteomics and immunofluorescence analyses 
showing that TMEM55B interacts with many proteins that participate in mTORC1 
activation including components of the vacuolar-type proton ATPase (V-ATPase) 
and Ragulator complexes at the lysosomal membrane. The amino acid-induced 
phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrates S6K and 4E-BP was attenuated in 
TMEM55B-depleted cells compared with control cells. Depletion of TMEM55B was 
also found to evoke lysosomal stress as showed by translocation of the 
transcription factor TFEB to the nucleus. Furthermore, recruitment of the V1 
domain subcomplex of V-ATPase to lipid rafts was abrogated in TMEM55B-depleted 
cells. Collectively, our results suggest that TMEM55B contributes to assembly of 
the V-ATPase complex in lipid rafts of the lysosomal membrane and to subsequent 
activation of mTORC1.
