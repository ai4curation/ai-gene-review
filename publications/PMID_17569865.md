Multiple signaling pathways, including Wnt signaling, participate in animal 
development, stem cell biology, and human cancer. Although many components of 
the Wnt pathway have been identified, unresolved questions remain as to the 
mechanism by which Wnt binding to its receptors Frizzled and Low-density 
lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) triggers downstream signaling 
events. With live imaging of vertebrate cells, we show that Wnt treatment 
quickly induces plasma membrane-associated LRP6 aggregates. LRP6 aggregates are 
phosphorylated and can be detergent-solubilized as ribosome-sized multiprotein 
complexes. Phospho-LRP6 aggregates contain Wnt-pathway components but no common 
vesicular traffic markers except caveolin. The scaffold protein Dishevelled 
(Dvl) is required for LRP6 phosphorylation and aggregation. We propose that Wnts 
induce coclustering of receptors and Dvl in LRP6-signalosomes, which in turn 
triggers LRP6 phosphorylation to promote Axin recruitment and beta-catenin 
stabilization.
