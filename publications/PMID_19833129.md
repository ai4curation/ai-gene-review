The E3 ubiqutin ligase, murne double-minute clone 2 (MDM2), promotes the 
degradation of p53 under normal homeostatic conditions. Several serine residues 
within the acidic domain of MDM2 are phosphorylated to maintain its activity but 
become hypo-phosphorylated following DNA damage, leading to inactivation of MDM2 
and induction of p53. However, the signalling pathways that mediate these 
phosphorylation events are not fully understood. Here we show that the oncogenic 
and cell cycle-regulatory protein kinase, polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1), 
phosphorylates MDM2 at one of these residues, Ser260, and stimulates 
MDM2-mediated turnover of p53. These data are consistent with the idea that 
deregulation of PLK1 during tumourigenesis may help suppress p53 function.
