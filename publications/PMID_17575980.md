Vibrio cholerae causes the cholera disease through secretion of cholera toxin 
(CT), resulting in severe diarrhoea by modulation of membrane transporters in 
the intestinal epithelium. Genes encoding membrane-spanning transporters 
identified as being differentially expressed during cholera disease in a 
microarray screening were studied by real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and in 
a CaCo-2 cell model. Two amino acid transporters, SLC7A11 and SLC6A14, were 
upregulated in acute cholera patients compared to convalescence. Five other 
transporters were downregulated; aquaporin 10, SLC6A4, TRPM6, SLC23A1 and 
SLC30A4, which have specificity for water, serotonin (5-HT), magnesium, vitamin 
C and zinc, respectively. The majority of these changes appear to be attempts of 
the host to counteract the secretory response. Our results also support the 
concept that epithelial cells are involved in 5-HT signalling during acute 
cholera.
