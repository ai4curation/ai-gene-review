Ire1 is an ancient transmembrane sensor of ER stress with dual protein kinase 
and ribonuclease activities. In response to ER stress, Ire1 catalyzes the 
splicing of target mRNAs in a spliceosome-independent manner. We have determined 
the crystal structure of the dual catalytic region of Ire1at 2.4 A resolution, 
revealing the fusion of a domain, which we term the KEN domain, to the protein 
kinase domain. Dimerization of the kinase domain composes a large catalytic 
surface on the KEN domain which carries out ribonuclease function. We further 
show that signal induced trans-autophosphorylation of the kinase domain permits 
unfettered binding of nucleotide, which in turn promotes dimerization to compose 
the ribonuclease active site. Comparison of Ire1 to a topologically disparate 
ribonuclease reveals the convergent evolution of their catalytic mechanism. 
These findings provide a basis for understanding the mechanism of action of 
RNaseL and other pseudokinases, which represent 10% of the human kinome.
