Proteomic studies have addressed the composition of plant chloroplast ribosomes 
and 70S ribosomes from the unicellular organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii But 
comprehensive characterization of cytoplasmic 80S ribosomes from higher plants 
has been lacking. We have used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and 
mass spectrometry (MS) to analyse the cytoplasmic 80S ribosomes from the model 
flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Of the 80 ribosomal protein families 
predicted to comprise the cytoplasmic 80S ribosome, we have confirmed the 
presence of 61; specifically, 27 (84%) of the small 40S subunit and 34 (71%) of 
the large 60S subunit. Nearly half (45%) of the ribosomal proteins identified 
are represented by two or more distinct spots in the 2-DE gel indicating that 
these proteins are either post-translationally modified or present as different 
isoforms. Consistently, MS-based protein identification revealed that at least 
one-third (34%) of the identified ribosomal protein families showed expression 
of two or more family members. In addition, we have identified a number of 
non-ribosomal proteins that co-migrate with the plant 80S ribosomes during 
gradient centrifugation suggesting their possible association with the 80S 
ribosomes. Among them, RACK1 has recently been proposed to be a 
ribosome-associated protein that promotes efficient translation in yeast. The 
study, thus provides the basis for further investigation into the function of 
the other identified non-ribosomal proteins as well as the biological meaning of 
the various ribosomal protein isoforms.
