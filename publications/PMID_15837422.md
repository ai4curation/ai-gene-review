We have identified a regulator of sister chromatid cohesion in a screen for cell 
cycle-controlled proteins. This 35 kDa protein is degraded through 
anaphase-promoting complex (APC)-dependent ubiquitination in G1. The protein is 
nuclear in interphase cells, dispersed from the chromatin in mitosis, and 
interacts with the cohesin complex. In Xenopus embryos, overexpression of the 
protein causes failure to resolve and segregate sister chromatids in mitosis and 
an increase in the level of cohesin associated with metaphase chromosomes. In 
cultured cells, depletion of the protein causes mitotic arrest and complete 
failure of sister chromatid cohesion. This protein is thus an essential, cell 
cycle-dependent mediator of sister chromatid cohesion. Based on sequence 
analysis, this protein has no apparent orthologs outside of the vertebrates. We 
speculate that the protein, which we have named sororin, regulates the ability 
of the cohesin complex to mediate sister chromatid cohesion, perhaps by altering 
the nature of the interaction of cohesin with the chromosomes.
