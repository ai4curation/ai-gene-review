Synaptic vesicles (SV) are generated by two different mechanisms, one AP-2 
dependent and one AP-3 dependent. It has been uncertain, however, whether these 
mechanisms generate SV that differ in molecular composition. We explored this 
hypothesis by analyzing the targeting of ZnT3 and synaptophysin both to PC12 
synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMV) as well as SV isolated from wild-type and 
AP-3-deficient mocha brains. ZnT3 cytosolic tail interacted selectively with 
AP-3 in cell-free assays. Accordingly, pharmacological disruption of either 
AP-2- or AP-3-dependent SLMV biogenesis preferentially reduced synaptophysin or 
ZnT3 targeting, respectively; suggesting that these antigens were concentrated 
in different vesicles. As predicted, immuno-isolated SLMV revealed that ZnT3 and 
synaptophysin were enriched in different vesicle populations. Likewise, 
morphological and biochemical analyses in hippocampal neurons indicated that 
these two antigens were also present in distinct but overlapping domains. ZnT3 
SV content was reduced in AP-3-deficient neurons, but synaptophysin was not 
altered in the AP-3 null background. Our evidence indicates that neuroendocrine 
cells assemble molecularly heterogeneous SV and suggests that this diversity 
could contribute to the functional variety of synapses.
