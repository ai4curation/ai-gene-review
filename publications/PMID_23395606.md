Calcitonin is a 32-residue polypeptide hormone, which takes part in calcium 
metabolism in bones. It may form amyloid fibrils. Amyloid fibrils are related 
with serious diseases known as amyloidoses. The amyloid form of calcitonin takes 
part in medullary thyroid carcinoma. A novel hexapeptide ((6)TCMLGT(11)) of 
human calcitonin was predicted as a possible 'aggregation-prone' peptide, which 
may play a role in amyloid formation. We investigated experimentally the ability 
of an analog of this hexapeptide (cysteine replaced by alanine, TAMLGT) to form 
amyloid fibrils utilizing TEM, X-ray fiber diffraction, ATR FT-IR spectroscopy, 
and polarized light microscopy. This peptide self-assembles into amyloid-like 
fibrils and fibrillogenesis is mediated via nuclei of liquid crystalline nature, 
known as spherulites.
