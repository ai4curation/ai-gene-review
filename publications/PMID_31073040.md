Precise control of Wnt signaling is necessary for immune system development. In 
this study, we detected severely impaired development of all lymphoid lineages 
in mice, resulting from an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutation in the limb 
region 1-like gene (Lmbr1l), which encodes a membrane-spanning protein with no 
previously described function in immunity. The interaction of LMBR1L with 
glycoprotein 78 (GP78) and ubiquitin-associated domain-containing protein 2 
(UBAC2) attenuated Wnt signaling in lymphocytes by preventing the maturation of 
FZD6 and LRP6 through ubiquitination within the endoplasmic reticulum and by 
stabilizing "destruction complex" proteins. LMBR1L-deficient T cells exhibited 
hallmarks of Wnt/β-catenin activation and underwent apoptotic cell death in 
response to proliferative stimuli. LMBR1L has an essential function during 
lymphopoiesis and lymphoid activation, acting as a negative regulator of the 
Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Abstract

Precise control of Wnt signaling is necessary for immune system development. Here we detected severely impaired development of all lymphoid lineages in mice resulting from a N -ethyl- N -nitrosourea-induced mutation in limb region 1 like ( Lmbr1l ), encoding a membrane-spanning protein with no previously described function in immunity. Interaction of LMBR1L with glycoprotein 78 (GP78) and ubiquitin-associated domain containing 2 (UBAC2) attenuated Wnt signaling in lymphocytes by preventing the maturation of FZD6 and LRP6 through ubiquitination within the endoplasmic reticulum and by stabilizing destruction complex proteins. LMBR1L-deficient T cells exhibited hallmarks of Wnt/β-catenin activation and underwent apoptotic cell death in response to proliferative stimuli. LMBR1L has an essential function during lymphopoiesis and lymphoid activation, acting as a negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Graphical Abstract

LMBR1L plays an essential role in lymphocyte development by limiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. A mutation in Lmbr1l caused the impaired development and function of lymphocytes in a forward genetic screen of mice with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)–induced mutations. Development to the LMPP stage and all subsequent lymphoid-directed stages was impaired in LMBR1L-deficient mice. A LMBR1L-GP78-UBAC2 complex in the ER stabilizes the β-catenin destruction complex and promotes the ubiquitin (Ub)–mediated degradation of β-catenin and Wnt receptors. LP, lymphoid progenitor; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli protein; P, phosphoryl.

INTRODUCTION

Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a key regulator of mammalian development. In the hematopoietic system, Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes the survival and renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the commitment to and differentiation into hematopoietic progenitor and lymphocyte lineages. However, the phenotypic effects of Wnt/β-catenin are not straightforward, in that either excessive or insufficient β-catenin activity has deleterious consequences. For example, combinations of hypomorphic or null adenomatous polyposis coli ( Apc ) alleles resulting in a gradient of Wnt/β-catenin signaling levels cause either HSC expansion at low levels of activation or depletion of the HSC pool at high levels of activation. Other reports indicate that the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway can promote apoptosis in lymphocytes and decrease quiescence in HSCs.

RESULTS

LMBR1L contains nine transmembrane-spanning domains and, in cell fractionation experiments, was most abundant in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fraction. LMBR1L coimmunoprecipitated with numerous components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling apparatus, including ZNRF3, LRP6, β-catenin, glycogen synthase kinase–3α (GSK-3α), and GSK-3β, and with proteins involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins [UBAC2, transitional ER adenosine triphosphatase (TERA), UBXD8, and glycoprotein 78 (GP78)]. Primary CD8 + T cells from Lmbr1l −/− mice displayed increased levels of β-catenin and the mature forms of Wnt receptor FZD6 and co-receptor LRP6. These effects resulted from the failure of a LMBR1L-GP78-UBAC2 complex to signal the degradation of β-catenin, FZD6, and LRP6 in the ER. Similarly increased expression of β-catenin and mature FZD6 and LRP6 was detected in Gp78 −/− primary CD8 + T cells. In addition, reduced protein expression of multiple “destruction complex” components [Axin1, DVL2, β-TrCP, GSK-3α and −3β, and casein kinase 1 (CK1)] was observed in Lmbr1l −/− primary CD8 + T cells. Notably, the knockout of β-catenin in Lmbr1l −/− EL4 cells, a T lymphoma cell line, restored the proliferative potential to a substantial extent and decreased apoptosis caused by LMBR1L deficiency.

CONCLUSION

Absent LMBR1L, Wnt/β-catenin signaling is aberrantly activated, leading to impaired development and functional defects of all lymphoid lineages in mice. Perhaps because of the need for its precise regulation, a prominent element of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is the canonical destruction complex that ensures the cytoplasmic destruction of β-catenin in the absence of Wnt ligand. Our findings reveal another component of this braking system: an ER-localized LMBR1L-GP78-UBAC2 complex responsible for the degradation of FZD and LRP6 in lymphocytes. Although the upstream signal(s) directing the activation of the LMBR1L-GP78-UBAC2 complex are unknown, we hypothesize that the interface of this complex with the canonical destruction complex synchronizes the activities of these complexes and circumvents leaky inhibition by a single braking mechanism.
