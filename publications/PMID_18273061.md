Abstract

The c-Cbl tyrosine kinase binding domain (Cbl-TKB), essentially an ‘embedded' SH2 domain, has a critical role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination. To address how this domain can bind to disparate recognition mofits and to determine whether this results in variations in substrate-binding affinity, we compared crystal structures of the Cbl-TKB domain complexed with phosphorylated peptides of Sprouty2, Sprouty4, epidermal growth factor receptor, Syk, and c-Met receptors and validated the binding with point-mutational analyses using full-length proteins. An obligatory, intrapeptidyl H-bond between the phosphotyrosine and the conserved asparagine or adjacent arginine is essential for binding and orientates the peptide into a positively charged pocket on c-Cbl. Surprisingly, c-Met bound to Cbl in the reverse direction, which is unprecedented for SH2 domain binding. The necessity of this intrapeptidyl H-bond was confirmed with isothermal titration calorimetry experiments that also showed Sprouty2 to have the highest binding affinity to c-Cbl; this may enable the selective sequestration of c-Cbl from other target proteins.

Introduction

Deregulation of growth factor receptors occurs in a large number of malignancies, predominantly resulting in enhanced or prolonged receptor signaling. Recent evidence implicates the loss of negative regulation, such as ubiquitination and endosome-directed degradation, as having a significant role in enhanced receptor activity ( Peschard and Park, 2003 ). One of the key negative regulators of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and non-RTKs is the protein product of the c-Cbl proto-oncogene ( Thien and Langdon, 2005 ). Originally assigned a role as an adapter/docker protein, c-Cbl was revealed to have E3-ubiquitin ligase activity via its RING domain, shedding light on the mechanism by which c-Cbl orchestrated the downregulation of tyrosine kinase-activated pathways ( Joazeiro et al , 1999 ).

c-Cbl interacts with a diverse array of proteins via phosphorylatable tyrosine residues at its C terminus, via its proline-rich region, and through an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-like binding domain ( Schmidt and Dikic, 2005 ) lying adjacent to the RING domain. Although this phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB) appeared to have several hallmarks of a PTB consensus motif, the crystal structure demonstrated that it structurally resembled an SH2 domain but required a flanking four-helix bundle (4H) and an EF-hand subdomain to accomplish binding ( Meng et al , 1999 ). Together, these three sub-domains make up the tyrosine kinase-binding (TKB) domain, which is unique to Cbl proteins and often referred to as a specialized or ‘embedded' SH2 domain ( Liu et al , 2006 ) ( Figure 1A ).

Binding to the TKB domain is required for the subsequent conjugation of ubiquitin through the RING domain during the ubiquitination process. The consensus binding sequence targeted by the TKB domain was originally identified by Lupher et al (1997) as D(N/D)XpY, but was later experimentally refined as (N/D)XpY(S/T)XXP. This motif is common to several protein tyrosine kinases (PTK), such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, ZAP-70 (ζ-associated protein of 70 kDa), Src and Syk, as well as members of the Sprouty (Spry) family of Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors ( Figure 1B ) (herein referred to as the PTK subgroup). Each of these targets binds to the TKB domain following phosphorylation of a central tyrosine residue in the consensus motif and, in most cases, their protein expression levels are subsequently downregulated by ubiquitination ( Schmidt and Dikic, 2005 ).

In recent years, two additional consensus motifs have been identified as targeted by the c-Cbl-TKB domain. The first, RA(V/I)XNQpY(S/T), is a derivation of the original sequence, with conserved residues extending back to the arginine at the pY−6 position ( Figure 1B ). This sequence is conserved amongst a family of adaptor proteins based on the APS ( a dapter with a p lekstrin homology and S rc homology-2 domains) protein ( Hu and Hubbard, 2005 ) and, unlike the PTK subgroup, they are not substrates for ubiquitination, but use c-Cbl as a docker protein in the insulin receptor complex ( Chiang et al , 2001 ). The second consensus sequence was identified in a study investigating the binding of c-Cbl to the c-Met receptor (Met) but, unlike the APS sequence, it bears no resemblance to the previously characterized PTK-binding motif ( Peschard et al , 2001 ). Alanine-scanning mutations identified that a DpYR motif was essential for the ubiquitination and downregulation of Met by c-Cbl ( Peschard et al , 2004 ). This motif is conserved among the Met family members, Ron and Sea ( Penengo et al , 2003 ), as well as in plexins—receptors for semaphorins that promote cell repulsion ( Tamagnone et al , 1999 ; Figure 1B ).

Of the two specialized domains that bind to phosphorylated tyrosines—SH2 and PTB—the SH2 domains evolved in parallel with tyrosine phosphorylation and are inextricably linked to the activity of PTKs, whereas only around 25% of characterized PTB domains have similar targets ( Liu et al , 2006 ). PTB domains of proteins such as Shc and IRS-1/2 are reminiscent of the TKB domain and recognize residues N-terminal to the phosphotyrosine (pTyr), NPXpY, whereas the canonical SH2 domain primarily recognizes 3–5 residues C-terminal to the pTyr, and proteins are grouped based on their sequence and binding preferences ( Machida and Mayer, 2005 ; Liu et al , 2006 ). Although the 120 currently documented SH2 domains use diverse strategies to aggregate signalling complexes, there is no precedent for a given SH2 or PTB domain to associate with such apparently unrelated consensus binding motifs as seen with the TKB domain.

Cbl proteins appear to have two major physiological functions—either in acting as scaffolds or in targeting proteins for ubiquitination ( Thien and Langdon, 2005 ). These functions are reflected in the purpose of the TKB domain in (a) recognizing proteins and, in the case of ubiquitin substrates, (b) ensuring its appropriate orientation for ubiquitin conjugation. Cbl proteins have critical roles in the downregulation of both RTKs in growth and differentiation and the antigen receptors in the control of immune responses, and thus elucidating the TKB recognition sequence has been central to understanding the biochemistry of tyrosine kinase downregulation by Cbl proteins. The TKB domain is, in essence, an ‘embedded' SH2 domain—a domain generally recognized to bind a ‘tight' consensus motif ( Liu et al , 2006 ). The abnormal range of the experimentally observed motifs that bind to the TKB domain invites the question as to whether this domain has an uncharacteristic flexibility of binding or whether there is a hitherto undiscovered common binding mechanism that encompasses the previously observed sequences. Furthermore, with such diverse sequence recognition strategies, binding affinity to c-Cbl is likely to be varied and may lead to the selective sequestration of c-Cbl by higher-affinity targets over lower-affinity ones. This model has been suggested as a mechanism whereby Spry2, the most well-characterized of the Spry proteins, recruits c-Cbl from EGFR and results in the ubiquitination of Spry2 and preservation of EGFR on the cell surface ( Wong et al , 2002 ; Hall et al , 2003 ; Rubin et al , 2003 ).

We report here that TKB binding requires the formation of a unique intrapeptidyl hydrogen bond (H-bond) between the pTyr and the conserved asparagine (Asn) at the pY−2 position or an arginine (Arg) at the pY−1 position when the Asn is absent. We also demonstrate that Met binds to the TKB domain in the reverse direction, from N to C terminus with the formation of an intrapeptidyl H-bond between the pTyr and the Arg at the pY+1 position. To our knowledge, this is the first description of an SH2 domain having the capacity to bind to proteins in two orientations. This intrapeptidyl H-bond is critical for binding to c-Cbl, as exemplified by the absence of binding with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) (lacking either an Asn or Arg residue), which can be recovered with the substitution of either of these amino acids. The other conserved residues of the TKB-binding motifs are not essential for binding but contribute to the binding affinity of the substrate, which may be physiologically relevant for the selective sequestration of c-Cbl by high-affinity substrates. Overall, these findings illustrate the unique binding strategy for the specialized and biologically vital function of c-Cbl.

Discussion

We originally set out to investigate two major questions—why the TKB domain recognizes an unusually broad set of sequence-recognition motifs and whether variations in the binding affinity of the different TKB domain-binding proteins could result in the selective sequestration of c-Cbl by high-affinity binding proteins. Although we partially address the latter, demonstrating that differences in binding affinity do exist between different TKB-binding proteins, we cannot confirm whether this proposed sequestration of c-Cbl is of physiological importance. Given a favourable cellular localization, however, it is possible that Spry2 could influence the binding of c-Cbl to particular RTKs or other TKB-binding protein, provided it had a higher binding affinity. In addressing our first question, we have unexpectedly revealed two important elements of TKB binding: (1) the majority of binding is achieved through (D/N)XpY, RpY or pYR (in the reverse orientation) through the formation of an intrapeptidyl H-bond; (2) the Cbl-TKB domain can bind to substrates in two orientations.

The unique diversity of the TKB domain in its recognition of three consensus sequences is an unusual characteristic for an SH2 domain. These five complexes have revealed that there is some degree of consistency in binding between the Cbl-TKB targets and indicates that the TKB domain recognizes a less-radical set of motifs. The intrapeptidyl H-bond between pTyr and (pY−2)Asn, (pY−1)Arg or (pY+1)Arg in the reverse is necessary for the directed, ‘hand-in-glove' fit of the peptide into a positively charged pocket of the SH2 region of the Cbl-TKB domain (depicted in Figure 6A–D for Spry2 and Met), whether before binding to c-Cbl or concomitantly. Although this intrapeptidyl H-bond was identified in both of the previously characterized c-Cbl structures ( Meng et al , 1999 ; Hu and Hubbard, 2005 ), due consideration was not attributed to it due to a lack of supporting evidence to highlight its significance. When combined with these five structures, we are able to assign importance to the intrapeptidyl H-bond as a rule for binding and an event crucial for the directed positioning of the substrate on c-Cbl. Furthermore, with the ITC characterizations of the three VEFGR peptides, we show conclusively that binding to c-Cbl cannot occur without this intrapeptidyl H-bond, despite the presence of other conserved residues (depicted with a model diagram in Figure 6E–G ). These other conserved residues—(pY+1)Ser/Thr, (pY+4)Pro and (pY−1)Asp—tweak the binding affinity, and such as in the case of APS, high-affinity binding can be compensated for by other residues. Substrate binding is further stabilized in concert with the 4H subdomain and EF-hand, particularly the 4H subdomain, which contributes to binding via the Pro81 residue to the conserved (pY−2)Asn or compensating Arg ( Figure 3 ), and structural evidence suggests that these subdomains form an intimate, multifaceted association with the SH2 subdomain, linker sequence and RING domain in its interaction with the appropriate E2 enzyme, creating what appears to be a precise, rigid structure.

A comprehensive search of the known SH2 domain structures available in the protein data bank resulted in only four complex models where a pTyr formed a H-bond with the side chain of another residue in the peptide ( Gunther et al , 2003 ; Cho et al , 2004 ; Frese et al , 2006 ). For the first case, the H-bond was not conserved among the different peptides complexed with the SH2 domain of Gads ( Cho et al , 2004 ). In the Nck1-SH2:phospho-Tir and Nck2-SH2:phospho-Tir complexes, a degenerate peptide library scan showed a preference for hydrophobic residues over the interacting His at that position ( Frese et al , 2006 ). The last complex model between the SH2 domain of PI3 kinase and the phospho-platelet-derived growth factor receptor peptide identified the preference for negatively charged residues N-terminal to the pTyr that were not essential for binding nor bound to its SH2 domain in the same manner as the conserved (pY−1)Asp binds to the TKB domain of c-Cbl in the Met family of proteins ( Gunther et al , 2003 ).

Similarly, a search performed on known structures of PTB-binding peptides bearing the conserved D/NXpY and complexed with PTB domains also revealed that none of these binding conformations had the signature H-bond between the pTyr and the (pY−2)Asn. To the best of our knowledge, there are no conserved intrapeptidyl H-bonds between pTyr and its neighbouring Asn/Arg residues for SH2 and PTB domain-binding proteins. The formation of the intrapeptidyl H-bond in the D/NXpY, RpY or pYR (in the reverse) motifs is likely to be an essential specificity determinant for the recognition and docking of c-Cbl to its activated (phosphorylated) target proteins, whether before or during binding, and thus represents a mechanism that is unique to Cbl.

The most surprising finding from the crystal structure analyses is the reversed binding of the Met phosphopeptide. From these results, it would be presumed that other members of the Met subgroup also bind in the reverse direction. Interestingly, many of these family members have a proline residue at the pY−4 position, which would align with the (pY+4)Pro residue in members of the PTK subgroup in the reverse orientation, and presumably increase their binding affinity to c-Cbl over Met.

There are several analogous situations where ligand binding can occur in two orientations of a specific domain. The SUMO-binding amino-acid sequence motif of RanBP2 and PIASX-P have been shown to bind to the surface of SUMO-1 in two different orientations ( Reverter and Lima, 2005 ; Song et al , 2005 ) and similarly, the SH3 domain of Src can bind to proline-rich peptide ligands in two orientations ( Feng et al , 1994 ). Furthermore, the PH domain of ArhGAP9 accommodates both PI(3,4)P2 and PI(4,5)P2 at 180° rotations via a shallow, noncanonical binding pocket ( Ceccarelli et al , 2007 ). To our knowledge, however, there is no precedent for an SH2-domain-binding protein to bind to an SH2 domain in two orientations, and raises the question whether this may also occur. However, as the TKB domain accomplishes binding in conjunction with the 4H subdomain, its absence in other SH2 domains may restrict them from having such flexibility of binding.

The reverse binding of Met and the previously unidentified importance of the (pY−1)Arg in EGFR suggests that there is a larger cohort of Cbl-TKB domain targets, particularly those with an RpYD or RpYS/T motif. Searching the human proteome, we identified nearly 300 signal transduction proteins that contained the RYD sequence, and while it still remains to be determined whether these proteins are substrates for c-Cbl, this emphasizes the likelihood that other unrevealed c-Cbl targets exist. In addition, the reversed binding of Met may reflect the need for Cbl to bind to targets in two orientations for steric reasons, as the DpYR residues in Met lie very close to the plasma membrane in the juxta-membrane domain. This reversed binding presumably allows the appropriate distance for the subsequent ligation of ubiquitin moieties. In contrast, the reversed binding may also allow c-Cbl to bind to proteins without resulting in their ubiquitination, expanding Cbl's role as an adapter protein in signalling complexes other than the APS family of proteins. Together, these findings provide not only further clues to Cbl's role in signalling but also the incentive to revisit previously identified binding motifs of other proteins, with the potential of redefining the apparently established paradigms of modular signalling.
