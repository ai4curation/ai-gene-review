SecA is the ATPase that acts as the motor for protein export in the general 
secretory, or Sec, system of Escherichia coli. The tetrameric cytoplasmic 
chaperone SecB binds to precursors of exported proteins before they can become 
stably folded and delivers them to SecA. During this delivery step, SecB binds 
to SecA. The complex between SecA and SecB that is maximally active in 
translocation contains two protomers of SecA bound to a tetramer of SecB. The 
aminoacyl residues on each protein that are involved in binding the other have 
previously been identified by site-directed spin labeling and electron 
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy; however, that study provided no 
information concerning the relative orientation of the proteins within the 
complex. Here we used our extensive collection of single-cysteine variants of 
the two proteins and subjected pairwise combinations of SecA and SecB to brief 
oxidation to identify residues in close proximity. These data were used to 
generate a model for the orientation of the two proteins within the complex.
