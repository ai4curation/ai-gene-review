The assembly of the five oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) complexes in 
the inner mitochondrial membrane is an intricate process. The human enzymes 
comprise core proteins, performing the catalytic activities, and a large number 
of 'supernumerary' subunits that play essential roles in assembly, regulation 
and stability. The correct addition of prosthetic groups as well as chaperoning 
and incorporation of the structural components require a large number of 
factors, many of which have been found mutated in cases of mitochondrial 
disease. Nowadays, the mechanisms of assembly for each of the individual 
complexes are almost completely understood and the knowledge about the assembly 
factors involved is constantly increasing. On the other hand, it is now well 
established that complexes I, III and IV interact with each other, forming the 
so-called respiratory supercomplexes or 'respirasomes', although the pathways 
that lead to their formation are still not completely clear. This review is a 
summary of our current knowledge concerning the assembly of complexes I-V and of 
the supercomplexes.
