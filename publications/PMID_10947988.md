To gain a molecular understanding of tumor angiogenesis, we compared gene 
expression patterns of endothelial cells derived from blood vessels of normal 
and malignant colorectal tissues. Of over 170 transcripts predominantly 
expressed in the endothelium, 79 were differentially expressed, including 46 
that were specifically elevated in tumor-associated endothelium. Several of 
these genes encode extracellular matrix proteins, but most are of unknown 
function. Most of these tumor endothelial markers were expressed in a wide range 
of tumor types, as well as in normal vessels associated with wound healing and 
corpus luteum formation. These studies demonstrate that tumor and normal 
endothelium are distinct at the molecular level, a finding that may have 
significant implications for the development of anti-angiogenic therapies.
