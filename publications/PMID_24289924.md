While p53 activation has long been studied, the mechanisms by which its targets 
genes are restored to their preactivation state are less clear. We report here 
that TAF1 phosphorylates p53 at Thr55, leading to dissociation of p53 from the 
p21 promoter and inactivation of transcription late in the DNA damage response. 
We further show that cellular ATP level might act as a molecular switch for 
Thr55 phosphorylation on the p21 promoter, indicating that TAF1 is a cellular 
ATP sensor. Upon DNA damage, cells undergo PARP-1-dependent ATP depletion, which 
is correlated with reduced TAF1 kinase activity and Thr55 phosphorylation, 
resulting in p21 activation. As cellular ATP levels recover, TAF1 is able to 
phosphorylate p53 on Thr55, which leads to dissociation of p53 from the p21 
promoter. ChIP-sequencing analysis reveals p53 dissociates from promoters genome 
wide as cells recover from DNA damage, suggesting the general nature of this 
mechanism.

Introduction

The p53 tumor suppressor plays a critical role in the cellular response to DNA damage ( Vousden and Prives, 2009 ; Kruse and Gu, 2009 ). The biochemical activity of p53 that is required for this role primarily relies on its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences and to control the transcription of its target genes. Among the genes induced by p53 are p21 that binds and inhibits all currently known cyclin-dependent protein kinases required for the G1-to-S phase transition. Upon DNA damage, the transcription activity of p53 is regulated through multiple post-translational modifications ( Bode and Dong, 2004 ; Kruse and Gu, 2009 ), including the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues and the acetylation of lysine residues.

We have previously reported that p53 is phosphorylated by TAF1 at Thr55 and this phosphorylation leads to p53 inactivation ( Li et al, 2004 ; Cai and Liu, 2008 ). TAF1 is the largest subunit of transcription factor TFIID, which is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 13–14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs; Burley and Roeder, 1996 ; Tora, 2002 ; Thomas and Chiang, 2006 ). In addition to its intrinsic protein kinase activity ( Dikstein et al, 1996 ), TAF1 also contains a tandem pair of 110-residue motifs known as double-bromodomain (DBrD) modules ( Jacobson et al, 2000 ). Interestingly, we also show that p53 recruits TAF1 to the p21 promoter through interaction between its acetyllysines and TAF1 DBrD and this recruitment contributes to p53 activation ( Li et al, 2007 ). These data imply that TAF1 plays a dual role in regulation of p53. Perhaps at a later time of DNA damage, TAF1 may mark p53 for inactivation via Thr55 phosphorylation on the p21 promoter, thus inactivating p53-mediated transcription.

One conspicuous alteration during DNA damage, which may potentially allow TAF1 to play a dual role in p53 regulation, is cellular ATP levels. Upon DNA damage, cellular ATP is depleted by activated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). PARP-1 is a nuclear enzyme that catalyzes the covalent attachment of ADP-ribose units on the γ-carboxyl group of Glu residues of acceptor proteins. This leads to modification of numerous proteins using NAD+ as a substrate and to exhaustion of cellular ATP ( Schreiber et al, 2006 ). Of the ~18 predicted PARPs in the human genome ( Ame et al, 2004 ), PARP-1 and PARP-2 are highly activated in response to DNA damage, with PARP-1 being responsible for about 90% of the activity. As a consequence, ATP has been reported depleted in wild type but not PARP-1 −/− MEF cells following DNA damage ( Ha and Snyder, 1999 ). The altered ATP levels may potentially affect the dynamics of TAF1 phosphorylation, thus allowing it to function to both activate and terminate p53-mediated transcription.

To investigate this possibility, we first study whether TAF1 might phosphorylate p53 on the p21 promoter. By using an immobilized template DNA system, we show TAF1 phosphorylates p53 at Thr55 on the p21 promoter in a manner that is particularly sensitive to ATP levels, and this phosphorylation leads to p53 dissociation from the promoter. Importantly, we show that cellular or local ATP concentration fluctuations might act as a molecular switch for Thr55 phosphorylation on the p21 promoter and this phosphorylation leads to inactivation of p21 transcription as cells recover from DNA damage. To assess overall effect of the regulation, we performed ChIP-sequencing analysis and revealed p53 undergoes promoter dissociation at a global level as ATP levels recover from DNA damage. These data provide evidence for regulation of p53 transcription activity by cellular ATP levels and suggest molecular insights into inactivation of p53 transcription late in the DNA damage response.

Discussion

Current views of transcription regulation place most of their emphasis on the events that precede initiation of transcription. Although these events play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, correct regulation also requires turning off transcription when no longer needed. Because a DNA-bound activator interacts and recruits components of the basal transcription apparatus to the promoter, signaling transcription initiation, one or more of those basal factors could, in theory, mark the transcription activator presumably through post-translational modification after transcription, leading to cessation of transcription. In our previous study, we showed that acetylated p53 at K373 and K382 induces p21 transcription through interacting with TAF1 DBrD ( Li et al, 2007 ). This unique interaction is probably important for keeping TAF1 in a close proximity to p53, allowing Thr55 phosphorylation to occur on the promoter and turn-off p21 transcription. Our result that the p53 acetylation mutants that fail to bind to TAF1 also fail to be phosphorylated by TAF1 ( Figure 7 ) and dissociated from the p21 promoter ( Figure 4C ) supports this view. To our knowledge, inactivation of p53 on promoter after responding to DNA damage has not been addressed before our findings thus provided novel insights into the regulation of p53-mediated transcription. Furthermore, because TAF1 is a component of general transcription machinery bound to many promoters ( Kim et al, 2005 ), our results may provide important clues about promoter inactivation in general.

It is clear that that nutrient availability is likely sensed at multiple levels in mammalian cells. For example, AMPK is activated in response to ATP depletion and/or AMP accumulation ( Hardie, 2007 ). Mammalian target of rapamycin is activated in a manner dependent on cellular amino acid levels ( Guertin et al, 2009 ) and ATP levels ( Dennis et al, 2001 ). Because TAF1 is a cell cycle regulatory protein important for G1 progression ( Sekiguchi et al, 1991 ; Wang and Tjian, 1994 ; Li et al, 2004 ), its ability to sense cellular ATP may be critical for instructing cells, at transcription level, as to whether available nutrients/ATP are sufficient to permit cell growth. Indeed, our ChIP-Seq analysis reveals activation of several p53-mediated cell growth arrest genes (such as p21 and SESN2) is reduced upon ATP-dependent TAF1 phosphorylation. However, our ChIP-Seq analysis also reveals reduction of p53 activation of apoptosis genes (such as PIG1) and metabolism genes (such as TIGAR, Table S2 ) at 16 h after DNA damage, suggesting ATP-dependent TAF1 phosphorylation may inhibit overall p53 tumor suppressor activity. Interestingly, metabolic stress has been shown to activate p53 through AMPK-mediated Ser15 phosphorylation ( Jones et al, 2005 ), suggesting that nutritional status could regulate p53 transcription activity through multiple pathways. Upon metabolic stress (or lower cellular ATP levels), p53 is activated by AMPK phosphorylation, so cells can undergo stress-mediated G1 arrest. In nutrition rich conditions (or higher cellular ATP levels), however, p53 is inactivated by ATP-dependent TAF1 phosphorylation, so cells can undergo G1 progression. Finally, although metabolic alterations have been linked to cancer for several decades ( Warburg, 1956 ; Heiden et al, 2009 ), little is known about how cellular metabolites affect p53 tumor suppressor function in cancer. Thus our data that cellular ATP directly might impacts its association with promoters provided evidence for regulation of p53-mediated transcription activation by cellular metabolites.
