Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a polyglutamine repeat in the protein 
huntingtin (Htt) with mutant Htt (mHtt) expressed throughout the body and 
similarly in all brain regions. Yet, HD neuropathology is largely restricted to 
the corpus striatum. We report that the small guanine nucleotide-binding protein 
Rhes, which is localized very selectively to the striatum, binds physiologically 
to mHtt. Using cultured cells, we found Rhes induces sumoylation of mHtt, which 
leads to cytotoxicity. Thus, Rhes-mHtt interactions can account for the 
localized neuropathology of HD.

Abstract

Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a polyglutamine repeat in the protein huntingtin (Htt) with mutant Htt (mHtt) expressed throughout the body and similarly in all brain regions. Yet, HD neuropathology is largely restricted to the corpus striatum. We report that the small guanine nucleotide–binding protein Rhes, which is localized very selectively to the striatum, binds physiologically to mHtt. Using cultured cells, we found Rhes induces sumoylation of mHtt, which leads to cytotoxicity. Thus, Rhes-mHtt interactions can account for the localized neuropathology of HD.
