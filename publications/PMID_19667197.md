The Sec1/Munc18 (SM) protein family regulates intracellular trafficking through 
interactions with individual SNARE proteins and assembled SNARE complexes. 
Revealing a common mechanism of this regulation has been challenging, largely 
because of the multiple modes of interaction observed between SM proteins and 
their cognate syntaxin-type SNAREs. These modes include binding of the SM to a 
closed conformation of syntaxin, binding to the N-terminal peptide of syntaxin, 
binding to assembled SNARE complexes, and/or binding to nonsyntaxin SNAREs. The 
SM protein Vps45p, which regulates endosomal trafficking in yeast, binds the 
conserved N-terminal peptide of the syntaxin Tlg2p. We used size exclusion 
chromatography and a quantitative fluorescent gel mobility shift assay to reveal 
an additional binding site that does not require the Tlg2p N-peptide. 
Characterization of Tlg2p mutants and truncations indicate that this binding 
site corresponds to a closed conformation of Tlg2p. Furthermore, the Tlg2p 
N-peptide competes with the closed conformation for binding, suggesting a 
fundamental regulatory mechanism for SM-syntaxin interactions in SNARE assembly 
and membrane fusion.
