A binding protein for the globular head domains of complement component C1q, 
designated gC1qR, recently described to be present on vascular and blood cells 
(Ghebrehiwet, B., Lim, B.-L., Peerschke, E. I. B., Willis, A. C., and Reid, K. 
B. M. (1994) J. Exp. Med. 179, 1809-1821 was expressed in recombinant form in 
bacteria to investigate its functional and structural properties. The 
recombinant gC1qR was found to be functional because tetramerization of the 
24.3-kDa polypeptide occurred as described for the native protein, and the 
binding of the ligand C1q by recombinant gC1qR was indistinguishable from 
binding shown by gC1qR isolated from Raji cells. Recombinant gC1qR immobilized 
to microspheres was used to search for additional binding proteins unrelated to 
C1q. Surprisingly, it was found that vitronectin or complexes containing 
vitronectin were retained from plasma or serum, and subsequent analysis revealed 
the specific binding of the ternary vitronectin-thrombin-antithrombin complex to 
gC1qR. Because the thrombin-antithrombin complex was unable to interact with 
gC1qR, direct binding with vitronectin was investigated in a purified system. 
The heparin binding multimeric form of vitronectin but not the plasma form of 
vitronectin was found to bind specifically to gC1qR isolated from Raji cell 
membrane as well as to recombinant gC1qR. This interaction was saturable (KD 
approximately 20 nM) and inhibitable by glycosaminoglycans such as heparin but 
not by chondroitin sulfate. C1q and vitronectin did not compete with each other 
for binding to gC1qR, and both ligands seem to interact with different parts of 
the gC1qR because a truncated version of recombinant gC1qR lacking the 
N-terminal 22-amino acid portion hardly interacted with vitronectin but bound 
C1q as well as the intact gC1qR. These findings establish gC1qR as a novel 
vitronectin-binding protein that may participate in the clearance of 
vitronectin-containing complexes or opsonized particles or cooperate with 
vitronectin in the inhibition of complement-mediated cytolysis.
