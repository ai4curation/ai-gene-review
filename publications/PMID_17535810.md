Tic40 is a component of the protein import apparatus of the inner envelope of 
chloroplasts, but its role in the import mechanism has not been clearly defined. 
The C terminus of Tic40 shares weak similarity with the C-terminal Sti1 domains 
of the mammalian Hsp70-interacting protein (Hip) and Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing 
protein (Hop) co-chaperones. Additionally, Tic40 may possess a tetratricopeptide 
repeat (TPR) protein-protein interaction domain, another characteristic feature 
of Hip/Hop co-chaperones. To investigate the functional importance of different 
parts of the Tic40 protein and to determine whether the homology between Tic40 
and co-chaperones is functionally significant, different Tic40 deletion and 
Tic40:Hip fusion constructs were generated and assessed for complementation 
activity in the Arabidopsis Tic40 knock-out mutant, tic40. Interestingly, all 
Tic40 deletion constructs failed to complement tic40, indicating that each part 
removed is essential for Tic40 function; these included a construct lacking the 
Sti1-like domain (DeltaSti1), a second lacking a central region, including the 
putative TPR domain (DeltaTPR), and a third lacking the predicted transmembrane 
anchor region. Moreover, the DeltaSti1 and DeltaTPR constructs caused strong 
dominant-negative, albino phenotypes in tic40 transformants, indicating that the 
truncated Tic40 proteins interfere with the residual chloroplast protein import 
that occurs in tic40 plants. Remarkably, the Tic40:Hip fusion constructs showed 
that the Sti1 domain of human Hip is functionally equivalent to the Sti1-like 
region of Tic40, strongly suggesting a co-chaperone role for the Tic40 protein. 
Supporting this notion, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence 
complementation assays demonstrated the in vivo interaction of Tic40 with 
Tic110, a protein believed to recruit stromal chaperones to protein import 
sites.
