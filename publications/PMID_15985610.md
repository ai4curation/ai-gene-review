PBAF and BAF are two chromatin-remodeling complexes of the SWI/SNF family 
essential for mammalian transcription and development. Although these complexes 
share eight identical subunits, only PBAF can facilitate transcriptional 
activation by nuclear receptors in vitro. Here we show that these complexes have 
selectivity in mediating transcription of different interferon-responsive genes. 
The selectivity by PBAF requires a novel subunit, BAF200, but not the previously 
described PBAF-specificity subunit, BAF180 (Polybromo). Our study provides in 
vivo evidence that PBAF and BAF regulate expression of distinct genes, and 
suggests that BAF200 plays a key role in PBAF function.
