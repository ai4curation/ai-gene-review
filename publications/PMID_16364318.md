Increasing evidence suggests that lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins 
contribute to the progression of cell apoptosis. Here we found that apoptosis of 
ovarian cancer cells OV-90 triggered by TNF was cathepsin B-depended. Two 
cathepsin B binding proteins, bikunin and TSRC1, were identified by yeast 
two-hybrid method and the interactions were confirmed in vitro and in vivo. 
Overexpression of bikunin could suppress TNF-induced apoptosis of OV-90 cells, 
and TSRC1 overexpression had an opposite effect on apoptosis. The presented 
results suggest that cathepsin B and its interacting proteins, bikunin and 
TSRC1, are involved in the apoptotic pathway of ovarian cancer cells.
