PURPOSE: ZMYND8 encodes a multidomain protein that serves as a central 
interactive hub for coordinating critical roles in transcription regulation, 
chromatin remodeling, regulation of super-enhancers, DNA damage response and 
tumor suppression. We delineate a novel neurocognitive disorder caused by 
variants in the ZMYND8 gene.
METHODS: An international collaboration, exome sequencing, molecular modeling, 
yeast two-hybrid assays, analysis of available transcriptomic data and a 
knockdown Drosophila model were used to characterize the ZMYND8 variants.
RESULTS: ZMYND8 variants were identified in 11 unrelated individuals; 10 
occurred de novo and one suspected de novo; 2 were truncating, 9 were missense, 
of which one was recurrent. The disorder is characterized by intellectual 
disability with variable cardiovascular, ophthalmologic and minor skeletal 
anomalies. Missense variants in the PWWP domain of ZMYND8 abolish the 
interaction with Drebrin and missense variants in the MYND domain disrupt the 
interaction with GATAD2A. ZMYND8 is broadly expressed across cell types in all 
brain regions and shows highest expression in the early stages of brain 
development. Neuronal knockdown of the DrosophilaZMYND8 ortholog results in 
decreased habituation learning, consistent with a role in cognitive function.
CONCLUSION: We present genomic and functional evidence for disruption of ZMYND8 
as a novel etiology of syndromic intellectual disability.
