The Golgi complex in mammalian cells forms a continuous ribbon of interconnected 
stacks of flat cisternae. We show here that this distinctive architecture 
reflects and requires the continuous input of membranes from the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER), in the form of pleiomorphic ER-to-Golgi carriers (EGCs). An 
important step in the biogenesis of the Golgi ribbon is the complete 
incorporation of the EGCs into the stacks. This requires the Golgi-matrix 
protein GM130, which continuously cycles between the cis-Golgi compartments and 
the EGCs. On acquiring GM130, the EGCs undergo homotypic tethering and fusion, 
maturing into larger and more homogeneous membrane units that appear primed for 
incorporation into the Golgi stacks. In the absence of GM130, this process is 
impaired and the EGCs remain as distinct entities. This induces the accumulation 
of tubulovesicular membranes, the shortening of the cisternae, and the breakdown 
of the Golgi ribbon. Under these conditions, however, secretory cargo can still 
be delivered to the Golgi complex, although this occurs less efficiently, and 
apparently through transient and/or limited continuities between the EGCs and 
the Golgi cisternae.
