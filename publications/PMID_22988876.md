PD (Parkinson's disease) is a devastating progressive motor disorder with no 
available cure. Over the last two decades, an increasing number of genetic 
defects have been found that cause familial and idiopathic forms of PD. In 
parallel, the importance of Wnt signalling pathways for the healthy functioning 
of the adult brain and the dysregulation of these pathways in neurodegenerative 
disease has become apparent. Cell biological functions disrupted in PD are 
partially controlled by Wnt signalling pathways and proteins encoded by PARK 
genes have been shown to modify Wnt signalling. This suggests the prospect of 
targeting Wnt signalling pathways to modify PD progression.
