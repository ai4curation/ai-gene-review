Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a devastating 
inherited disorder characterized by episodic syncope and/or sudden cardiac 
arrest during exercise or acute emotion in individuals without structural 
cardiac abnormalities. Although rare, CPVT is suspected to cause a substantial 
part of sudden cardiac deaths in young individuals. Mutations in RYR2, encoding 
the cardiac sarcoplasmic calcium channel, have been identified as causative in 
approximately half of all dominantly inherited CPVT cases. Applying a 
genome-wide linkage analysis in a large Swedish family with a severe dominantly 
inherited form of CPVT-like arrhythmias, we mapped the disease locus to 
chromosome 14q31-32. Sequencing CALM1 encoding calmodulin revealed a 
heterozygous missense mutation (c.161A>T [p.Asn53Ile]) segregating with the 
disease. A second, de novo, missense mutation (c.293A>G [p.Asn97Ser]) was 
subsequently identified in an individual of Iraqi origin; this individual was 
diagnosed with CPVT from a screening of 61 arrhythmia samples with no identified 
RYR2 mutations. Both CALM1 substitutions demonstrated compromised calcium 
binding, and p.Asn97Ser displayed an aberrant interaction with the RYR2 
calmodulin-binding-domain peptide at low calcium concentrations. We conclude 
that calmodulin mutations can cause severe cardiac arrhythmia and that the 
calmodulin genes are candidates for genetic screening of individual cases and 
families with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and unexplained sudden cardiac 
death.
