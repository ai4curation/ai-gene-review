Arabidopsis VRN genes mediate vernalization, the process by which a long period 
of cold induces a mitotically stable state that leads to accelerated flowering 
during later development. VRN1 encodes a protein that binds DNA in vitro in a 
non-sequence-specific manner and functions in stable repression of the major 
target of the vernalization pathway, the floral repressor FLC. Overexpression of 
VRN1 reveals a vernalization-independent function for VRN1, mediated 
predominantly through the floral pathway integrator FT, and demonstrates that 
VRN1 requires vernalization-specific factors to target FLC.
