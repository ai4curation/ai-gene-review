GATA-3 and c-Myb are core elements of a transcriptionally active complex 
essential for human Th2 cell development and maintenance. We report herein 
mechanistic details concerning the role of these transcription factors in human 
peripheral blood Th2 cell development. Silencing c-Myb in normal human naive 
CD4(+) cells under Th2 cell-promoting conditions blocked up-regulation of GATA-3 
and interleukin-4, and in effector/memory CD4(+) T cells, decreased expression 
of GATA-3 and Th2 cytokines. In primary T cells, c-Myb allows GATA-3 to 
autoactivate its own expression, an event that requires the direct interaction 
of c-Myb and GATA-3 on their respective binding sites in promoter of GATA-3. 
Immunoprecipitation revealed that the c-Myb/GATA-3 complex contained Menin and 
mixed lineage leukemia (MLL). MLL recruitment into the c-Myb-GATA-3-Menin 
complex was associated with the formation Th2 memory cells. That MLL-driven 
epigenetic changes were mechanistically important for this transition was 
suggested by the fact that silencing c-Myb significantly decreased the 
methylation of histone H3K4 and the acetylation of histone H3K9 at the GATA-3 
locus in developing Th2 and CD4(+) effector/memory cells. Therefore, c-Myb, 
GATA-3, and Menin form a core transcription complex that regulates GATA-3 
expression and, with the recruitment of MLL, Th2 cell maturation in primary 
human peripheral blood T cells.

Abstract

GATA-3 and c-Myb are core elements of a transcriptionally active complex essential for human Th2 cell development and maintenance. We report herein mechanistic details concerning the role of these transcription factors in human peripheral blood Th2 cell development. Silencing c-Myb in normal human naive CD4 + cells under Th2 cell-promoting conditions blocked up-regulation of GATA-3 and interleukin-4, and in effector/memory CD4 + T cells, decreased expression of GATA-3 and Th2 cytokines. In primary T cells, c-Myb allows GATA-3 to autoactivate its own expression, an event that requires the direct interaction of c-Myb and GATA-3 on their respective binding sites in promoter of GATA-3. Immunoprecipitation revealed that the c-Myb/GATA-3 complex contained Menin and mixed lineage leukemia (MLL). MLL recruitment into the c-Myb-GATA-3-Menin complex was associated with the formation Th2 memory cells. That MLL-driven epigenetic changes were mechanistically important for this transition was suggested by the fact that silencing c-Myb significantly decreased the methylation of histone H3K4 and the acetylation of histone H3K9 at the GATA-3 locus in developing Th2 and CD4 + effector/memory cells. Therefore, c-Myb, GATA-3, and Menin form a core transcription complex that regulates GATA-3 expression and, with the recruitment of MLL, Th2 cell maturation in primary human peripheral blood T cells.

Introduction

CD4 + T helper cells play a central role in immune responses. They are a heterogeneous group of cells that are further classified into 3 main subsets, Th1, Th2, and Th17, based on their cytokine production profiles and effector functions. 1 Th1 cells produce interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor and regulate cell-mediated immune responses to intracellular pathogens. Th2 cells produce interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13, which are essential for the generation of antibodies and elimination of extracellular pathogens. Th17 cells compose a recently identified Th subpopulation that appears to play an essential role in protection against certain extracellular pathogens, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae , and in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. 2 Some of the transcription factors that govern Th1/Th2/Th17 cell fate decisions have been identified; and of these, GATA-3 and T-bet appear to be the key regulators of Th2 and Th1 cell development, respectively. 3 , 4

GATA-3 is a member of the zinc finger transcription factor family. 5 In addition to its prominent role in regulating Th2 cell differentiation, it is also essential for thymic T-cell development. 6 , 7 In peripheral blood T helper cells, IL-4–mediated activation of STAT6 induces GATA-3 mRNA expression, an early event in Th2 cell differentiation. Interestingly, ectopic expression of a small amount of GATA-3 can induce robust expression of endogenous GATA-3, independent of IL-4 signaling and STAT6 activation, 8 – 11 suggesting the presence of an IL-4/STAT6-independent autoregulatory feedback loop. As GATA-3 levels rise, the cells commit to Th2 development and begin to acquire the Th2 phenotype, all at the expense of Th1 cell development. 5 The mechanistic details of how GATA-3 expression is regulated during Th2 cell development and how it apparently primes its own expression have not been fully elucidated. Here we report that c-Myb, a transcription factor previously reported to play a direct role in the regulation of GATA-3 expression, 12 plays an essential role in assembling a transcriptional complex composed of GATA-3, Menin, and c-Myb, which allows GATA-3 to autoregulate its own expression. These studies provide a more detailed, mechanisms-oriented explanation for the pivotal role of c-Myb in allowing GATA-3 to regulate the development and maintain viability of Th2 cells in peripheral blood.

Discussion

Using a variety of experimental techniques, including transient gene silencing with oligonucleotides, 30 expression of dominant negative c-Myb protein, 31 , 32 and tissue-specific loss of floxed c-Myb in Cre-producing mouse strains, 33 – 36 it has been demonstrated unequivocally that c-Myb is important at multiple points during T-cell development. 7 Maurice et al demonstrated that c-Myb regulates T helper cell lineage commitment in developing mouse thymocytes, at the same time that it appears to block development of cytotoxic T cells via regulation of GATA-3. 12 However, most of these studies have been carried out on cells in the thymic developmental compartments and, in addition, have focused on murine cells. As a result, beyond correlative observations, such as those demonstrating that proliferating human T cells require c-Myb for cell cycle progression, 30 there is a paucity of mechanistic information on c-Myb's functions in activated human CD4 + peripheral blood T cells. To address this knowledge gap, we carried out biochemical, immunoaffinity, and carefully controlled RNA interference studies in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes to study the role of c-Myb in regulating peripheral blood T-cell fate generally, and Th2 cell differentiation more specifically.

Th2 cell differentiation is dependent on a regulated expression of the GATA-3 transcription factor. 3 In naive T cells, GATA-3 expression is detectable but very low. On binding IL-4, a STAT6-dependent signal transduction cascade is initiated that leads to the up-regulation of GATA-3 expression. 37 We think that this initial up-regulation is indeed a “priming” stimulus because thereafter GATA-3 levels increase dramatically, in what previous investigations have suggested is an IL-4/STAT6-independent event. 8 – 11 The studies presented in this manuscript suggest that it is the formation of a highly active transcription complex composed minimally of c-Myb and GATA-3 on the GATA-3 promoter, which allows this marked up-regulation to occur ( Figures 1 – 2 ). Because the binding of GATA-3 to its own promoter is required, we have further shown that GATA-3 up-regulation is properly considered autoregulatory in nature ( Figures 3 – 4 ). Finally, we have also determined that, although GATA-3 binding to its own promoter is required for the enhanced expression of GATA-3 during Th2 cell development, it is not by itself sufficient to induce the levels of GATA-3 that are observed during this process ( Figure 3 ). Rather, our data demonstrate that GATA-3 is active within a transcriptional complex that contains c-Myb ( Figure 4 ) and Menin ( Figure 5 ) in naive CD4 + cells undergoing Th2 cell differentiation, and with c-Myb, Menin, and MLL in CD4 + effector/memory cells ( Figure 6 ). The importance of c-Myb in assembling this transcriptional complex, and the potential physiologic significance of the regulatory loop it enables, was demonstrated by the fact that silencing c-myb gene expression blocked the autoactivation of GATA-3 expression, and which in turn aborts Th2 cell differentiation. This observation led us to hypothesize that the relatively “high” levels of c-Myb in naive T cells (compared with effector/memory T cells) may enable a “default” pathway, which favors Th2 cell development over Th1 or Th17 cells.

That the marked up-regulation of GATA-3 noted during Th2 cell development might require the assembly of a multiprotein coactivator complex was in some respects predicted by previous observations in the literature. For example, GATA-3 and Smad3 are known to physically interact in the context of transforming growth factor-β-mediated gene expression 38 ; and, given the nature of Smad3, this interaction might reasonably be expected to require additional stabilizing proteins for effective promoter contacts. 38 , 39 In another example, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is known to be activated by T-cell receptor engagement, and activation of important downstream target genes, such as GlNAc6ST-1, a gene that encodes a sulfotransferase required for the synthesis of 6-sulfated cell recognition glycans, is dependent on physical interaction with GATA-3. 40 Das et al have also shown that in NF-κB p50-deficient mice, CD4 + T cells failed to induce GATA-3 expression under Th2 priming condition but maintained unimpaired T-bet and IFN-γ expression under Th1 differentiation conditions. 41 These reports initially suggested the possibility that a c-Myb/GATA-3 coactivator complex might include Smad3 or NF-κB. However, we were unable to demonstrate the presence of either transcription factor in c-Myb/GATA-3 immunoprecipitates (data not shown) and therefore turned our attention to other candidates.

We noted with interest several reports indicating that transcriptionally active proteins more usually associated with myelopoiesis also play important roles in lymphoid cell development. For example, Yamashita et al have demonstrated a crucial role for MLL in the maintenance of GATA-3 gene expression and the formation of Th2 memory cells. 26 Specifically, this group reported that MLL +/− CD4 + T cells could differentiate normally into antigen-specific effector Th1/Th2 cells in vitro, but the ability of MLL +/− memory Th2 cells to produce Th2 cytokines was reduced. The reduced expression of MLL in memory Th2 cells was also associated with decreased GATA3 expression as well as impaired maintenance of GATA3 locus histone modifications. Because MLL, a member of the Trithorax gene family, functions as a histone methyltransferase for H3K4, 42 this finding suggested that MLL was affecting local gene expression by epigenetic modification of the locus. Pertinent to this report, our group has recently found that c-Myb interacts with MLL in leukemic cells through Menin. 24 Menin, the product of the MEN1 gene mutated in familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, is often found in MLL histone methyltransferase complexes 42 and plays an important role as an adapter protein, along with LEDGF, in allowing functional MLL complexes to assemble. 43 We were further intrigued by several papers that reported that Menin is able to interact with several different partners affecting T-cell development, including NF-κB, JunD, and Smad3, as well as MLL. 44 , 45

For these reasons, and the fact that we have recently shown that Menin recruits c-Myb into the MLL complex in human leukemia cells, 24 we investigated the possibility that Menin might also be involved in assembling the Myb-GATA3 transcription complex and found that this was indeed the case ( Figures 5 – 6 ). Importantly, the c-Myb-Menin-MLL complexes were shown to have biologic function, as demonstrated by ChIP assays performed on primary human CD4 + effector/memory T cells after silencing c-Myb with siRNA. Specifically, these ChIPs revealed considerably diminished H3K4 methylation and H3K9 acetylation at the GATA-3 locus ( Figure 7 ). Interestingly, when c-Myb was silenced in naive CD4 + cells after 7 days of stimulation under Th2 cell-promoting conditions, histone modifications were not nearly as marked as those observed in effector/memory T cells, especially with regard to H3K9 acetylation. These results led us to postulate that the recruitment of MLL probably occurs as effector cells develop into memory cells.

In conclusion, the results of our studies led us to hypothesize that the Myb-Menin-GATA-3 complex may play an important role in the developmental choice, and differentiation, of T-cell subsets from naive T cells. Specifically, we postulate that the IL-4/STAT6 signaling pathway initiates GATA-3 expression, leading to the development of Th2 cells. Subsequently, GATA-3 activates its own promoter by forming an autoregulatory complex with c-Myb and Menin that markedly increases GATA-3 expression. During the process of generating memory Th2 cell, the GATA-3/c-Myb complex recruits MLL. These events sustain GATA-3 expression and are permissive of cytokine production as a result of the changes in histone modifications at the GATA-3 locus (Memory Th2; illustrated in supplemental Figure 3). The details that explain how c-Myb-Menin-GATA-3 can recruit MLL to the GATA-3 locus in CD4 + effector/memory T cells at specific developmental windows are of particular interest to our group, as are the postulated epigenetic and transcriptional changes that result from this recruitment. Uncovering these details should greatly clarify how naive CD4 + T cells become memory Th2 cells. These questions are currently being addressed in our laboratory and will be the focus of future reports.
