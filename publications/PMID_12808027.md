ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) mediated recruitment of COPI to membranes plays a 
central role in transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi. 
The activation of ARFs is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors 
(GEFs). Although several ARF-GEFs have been identified, the transport steps in 
which they function are still poorly understood. Here we report that GBF1, a 
member of the Sec7-domain family of GEFs, is responsible for the regulation of 
COPI-mediated events at the ER-Golgi interface. We show that GBF1 is essential 
for the formation, differentiation, and translocation of pre-Golgi intermediates 
and for the maintenance of Golgi integrity. We also show that the formation of 
transport-competent ER-to-Golgi intermediates proceeds in two stages: first, a 
COPI-independent event leads to the formation of an unstable compartment, which 
is rapidly reabsorbed in the absence of GBF1 activity. Second, the association 
of GBF1 with this compartment allows COPI recruitment and leads to its 
maturation into transport intermediates. The recruitment of GBF1 to this 
compartment is specifically inhibited by brefeldin A. Our findings imply that 
the continuous recruitment of GBF1 to spatially differentiated membrane domains 
is required for sustained membrane remodeling that underlies membrane traffic 
and Golgi biogenesis.
