The regulatory subunit NEMO is involved in the mechanism of activation of 
IkappaB kinase (IKK), the kinase complex that controls the NF-kappaB signaling 
pathway. During this process, NEMO is modified post-translationally through 
K63-linked polyubiquitination. We report the molecular characterization of a new 
missense mutation of NEMO (A323P) which causes a severe form of incontinentia 
pigmenti (OMIM#308300), an inherited disease characterized predominantly by skin 
inflammation. The A323P mutation was found to impair TNF-, IL-1-, LPS- and 
PMA/ionomycin-induced NF-kappaB activation, as well as to disrupt 
TRAF6-dependent NEMO polyubiquitination, due to a defective NEMO/TRAF6 
interaction. Mutagenesis identified the affected ubiquitination sites as three 
lysine residues located in the vicinity of A323. Unexpectedly, these lysines 
were ubiquitinated together with two previously identified lysines not connected 
to TRAF6. Mutation of all these ubiquitination sites severely impaired NF-kappaB 
activation induced by stimulation with IL-1, LPS, Nod2/RICK or serum/LPA. In 
contrast, mutation at all of these sites had only a limited effect on 
stimulation by TNF. These findings indicate that post-translational modification 
of NEMO through K63-linked polyubiquitination is a key event in IKK activation 
and that perturbation of this step may cause human pathophysiology.
