Signals from cytokine and antigen receptors play crucial roles during lymphocyte 
development. Mice lacking interleukin-7 receptor are lymphopenic, due to a 
defect in cell expansion at an early stage of differentiation, and the few 
mature T cells that develop in IL-7R-/- animals are functionally impaired. Both 
defects were rescued completely by overexpression of the anti-apoptosis protein 
Bcl-2. T cell progenitors lacking antigen receptor molecules are also blocked in 
differentiation and die, presumably because they fail to receive a positive 
signal via their pre-T cell receptor. Surprisingly, Bcl-2 did not promote 
survival or differentiation of T cells in rag-1-/- mice. These results provide 
evidence that blocking apoptosis is the essential function of IL-7R during 
differentiation and activation of T lymphocytes and that pre-TCR signaling 
blocks a pathway to apoptosis that is insensitive to Bcl-2.
