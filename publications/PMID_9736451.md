Exposure of 9L rat brain tumor cells to 40-100 microM CdCl2 for 2 h leads to an 
induction of a wide spectrum of heat shock proteins (HSPs). We have demonstrated 
that induction of the 70-kDa HSP (HSP70) and enhanced expression of its cognate 
(HSC70) by cadmium are concentration dependent and that the induction kinetics 
of these HSP70s are different. The increased synthesis of the HSP70s is 
accompanied by the increase in hsp70 and hsc70 mRNA levels, indicative of 
transcriptional regulation of the heat shock genes. Electrophoretic mobility 
shift assay (EMSA) using probes encompassing heat shock element (HSE), TATA, GC, 
and CCAAT boxes derived from the promoter regions of the heat shock genes shows 
distinguished binding patterns between hsp70 and hsc70 genes in both control and 
cadmium-treated cells. The results indicate that, in addition to the HSEs, the 
basal transcription elements are important in the regulation of the heat shock 
genes. The binding patterns of the corresponding transcription factors of these 
elements are examined by EMSA by using extended promoter fragments from 
respective heat shock genes with sequential addition of excess oligonucleotides 
encompassing individual transcription elements. Taken together, our results show 
that the differential induction of hsp70 and hsc70 involves multiple 
transcription factors that interact with HSE, TATA, GC, and CCAAT boxes.
