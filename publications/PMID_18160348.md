Secreted Wnt proteins play essential roles in many biological processes during 
development and diseases. However, little is known about the mechanism(s) 
controlling Wnt secretion. Recent studies have identified Wntless (Wls) and the 
retromer complex as essential components involved in Wnt signaling. While Wls 
has been shown to be essential for Wnt secretion, the function(s) of the 
retromer complex in Wnt signaling is unknown. Here, we have examined a role of 
Vps35, an essential retromer subunit, in Wnt signaling in Drosophila and 
mammalian cells. We provide compelling evidence that the retromer complex is 
required for Wnt secretion. Importantly, Vps35 colocalizes in endosomes and 
interacts with Wls. Wls becomes unstable in the absence of retromer activity. 
Our findings link Wls and retromer functions in the same conserved Wnt secretion 
pathway. We propose that retromer influences Wnt secretion by recycling Wntless 
from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN).
