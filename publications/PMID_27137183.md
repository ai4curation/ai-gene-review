To establish a functional bipolar mitotic spindle, the centrosome expands and 
matures, acquiring enhanced activities for microtubule (MT) nucleation and 
assembly at the onset of mitosis. However, the regulatory mechanisms of 
centrosome maturation and MT assembly from the matured centrosome are largely 
unknown. In this study, we showed that heat shock protein (HSP) 70 considerably 
accumulates at the mitotic centrosome during prometaphase to metaphase and is 
required for bipolar spindle assembly. Inhibition or depletion of HSP70 impaired 
the function of mitotic centrosome and disrupted MT nucleation and 
polymerization from the spindle pole, and may thus result in formation of 
abnormal mitotic spindles. In addition, HSP70 may associate with NEDD1 and 
γ-tubulin, two pericentriolar material (PCM) components essential for centrosome 
maturation and MT nucleation. Loss of HSP70 function disrupted the interaction 
between NEDD1 and γ-tubulin, and reduced their accumulation at the mitotic 
centrosome. Our results thus demonstrate a role for HSP70 in regulating 
centrosome integrity during mitosis, and indicate that HSP70 is required for the 
maintenance of a functional mitotic centrosome that supports the assembly of a 
bipolar mitotic spindle.
