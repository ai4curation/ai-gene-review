We have analyzed the effects of vaccinia virus (VV) on gamma interferon 
(IFN-gamma) signal transduction. Infection of cells with VV 1 to 2 h prior to 
treatment with IFN-gamma inhibits phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of 
Stat1 and consequently blocks accumulation of mRNAs normally induced by 
IFN-gamma. While phosphorylation of other proteins in the IFN-gamma pathway was 
not affected, activation of Stat1 by other ligand-receptor systems was also 
blocked by VV. This block of Stat1 activation was dose dependent, and although 
viral protein synthesis was not required, entry and uncoating of viral cores 
appear to be needed to block the accumulation of phosphorylated Stat1. These 
results suggest that a virion component is responsible for the effect. VV 
virions contain a phosphatase (VH1) that is sensitive to the phosphatase 
inhibitor Na(3)VO(4) but not to okadaic acid. Addition of Na(3)VO(4) but not 
okadaic acid restored normal Stat1 phosphorylation levels in VV-infected cells. 
Moreover, virions containing reduced levels of VH1 were unable to block the 
IFN-gamma signaling pathway. In vitro studies show that the phosphatase can bind 
and dephosphorylate Stat1, indicating that this transcription factor can be a 
substrate for VH1. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which VV interferes 
with the onset of host immune responses by blocking the IFN-gamma signal cascade 
through the dephosphorylating activity of the viral phosphatase VH1.
