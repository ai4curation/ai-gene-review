Studies on hypoxia-sensitive pathways have revealed a series of Fe(II)-dependent 
dioxygenases that regulate hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) by prolyl and 
asparaginyl hydroxylation. The recognition of these unprecedented signaling 
processes has led to a search for other substrates of the HIF hydroxylases. Here 
we show that the human HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase, factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), 
also efficiently hydroxylates specific asparaginyl (Asn)-residues within 
proteins of the IkappaB family. After the identification of a series of ankyrin 
repeat domain (ARD)-containing proteins in a screen for proteins interacting 
with FIH, the ARDs of p105 (NFKB1) and IkappaBalpha were shown to be efficiently 
hydroxylated by FIH at specific Asn residues in the hairpin loops linking 
particular ankyrin repeats. The target Asn residue is highly conserved as part 
of the ankyrin consensus, and peptides derived from a diverse range of 
ARD-containing proteins supported FIH enzyme activity. These findings 
demonstrate that this type of protein hydroxylation is not restricted to HIF and 
strongly suggest that FIH-dependent ARD hydroxylation is a common occurrence, 
potentially providing an oxygen-sensitive signal to a diverse range of 
processes.
