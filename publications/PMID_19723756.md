CONTEXT: The hypoparathyroidism, deafness, renal dysplasia (HDR) syndrome is 
caused by mutations in the gene encoding GATA3, which belongs to a family of 
dual zinc-finger transcription factors that have a role in vertebrate embryonic 
development.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify the GATA3 mutation in a HDR 
patient and determine its functional consequences. PATIENT AND DESIGN: A patient 
with HDR was studied after approval from the local ethical committee. Leukocyte 
DNA was used with GATA3-specific primers for PCR amplification, and the DNA 
sequences of the PCR products were determined. Wild-type and mutant GATA3 
constructs were transfected into COS-7 cell, and their functions were assessed 
by Western blot analysis, immunocytochemistry, EMSAs, luciferase reporter 
assays, and three-dimensional modeling.
RESULTS: A novel missense mutation, Thr272Ile, in zinc finger 1 (ZnF1) of GATA3 
was identified. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence revealed that the 
mutation did not affect nuclear localization of GATA3. However, EMSAs showed it 
to reduce DNA binding affinity, but not stability, and yeast two-hybrid assays 
demonstrated that the mutant GATA3 resulted in a loss of interaction with ZnF1 
and ZnF6 of the cofactor FOG2. The mutant GATA3 significantly reduced luciferase 
reporter activity by more than 65% (P < 0.001), and three-dimensional modeling 
indicated that the functional abnormalities may be due to a loss of Thr272 polar 
side chain interaction with Leu268.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel missense HDR-associated GATA3 mutation, Thr272Ile, has been 
identified and shown to result in reduced DNA binding, a partial loss of FOG2 
interaction, and a decrease in gene transcription.
