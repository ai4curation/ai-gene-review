A role in folding of newly translated proteins in the cytosol of eukaryotes has 
been proposed for t-complex polypeptide-1 (TCP1), although its molecular targets 
have not yet been identified. Tubulin is a major cytosolic protein whose 
assembly into microtubules is critical to many cellular processes. Although 
numerous studies have focused on the expression of tubulin, little is known 
about the processes whereby newly translated tubulin subunits acquire 
conformations that enable them to form alpha-beta-heterodimers. We examined the 
biogenesis of alpha- and beta-tubulin in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and report 
here that newly translated tubulin subunits entered a 900K complex in a 
protease-sensitive conformation. Addition of Mg-ATP, but not nonhydrolysable 
analogues, released the tubulin subunits as assembly-competent protein with a 
conformation that was relatively protease-resistant. The 900K complex purified 
from reticulocyte lysate contained as its major constituent a 58K protein that 
cross-reacted with a monoclonal antiserum against mouse TCP1. We conclude that 
TCP1 functions as a cytosolic chaperone in the biogenesis of tubulin.
