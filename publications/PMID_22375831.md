The importomer complex plays an essential role in the biogenesis of peroxisomes 
by mediating the translocation of matrix proteins across the organellar 
membrane. A central part of this highly dynamic import machinery is the docking 
complex consisting of Pex14p, Pex13p, and Pex17p that is linked to the RING 
finger complex (Pex2p, Pex10p, Pex12p) via Pex8p. To gain detailed knowledge on 
the molecular players governing peroxisomal matrix protein import and, thus, the 
integrity and functionality of peroxisomes, we aimed at a most comprehensive 
investigation of stable and transient interaction partners of Pex14p, the 
central component of the importomer. To this end, we performed a thorough 
quantitative proteomics study based on epitope tagging of Pex14p combined with 
dual-track stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture-mass 
spectrometry (SILAC-MS) analysis of affinity-purified Pex14p complexes and 
statistics. The results led to the establishment of the so far most extensive 
Pex14p interactome, comprising 9 core and further 12 transient components. We 
confirmed virtually all known Pex14p interaction partners including the core 
constituents of the importomer as well as Pex5p, Pex11p, Pex15p, and Dyn2p. More 
importantly, we identified new transient interaction partners (Pex25p, Hrr25p, 
Esl2p, prohibitin) that provide a valuable resource for future investigations on 
the functionality, dynamics, and regulation of the peroxisomal importomer.
