Isthmin (ISM) is a secreted 60-kDa protein that potently induces endothelial 
cell (EC) apoptosis. It suppresses tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice when 
stably overexpressed in cancer cells. Although αvβ5 integrin serves as a 
low-affinity receptor for ISM, the mechanism by which ISM mediates 
antiangiogenesis and apoptosis in ECs remain to be fully resolved. In this work, 
we report the identification of cell-surface glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa 
(GRP78) as a high-affinity receptor for ISM (Kd=8.6 nM). We demonstrated that 
ISM-GRP78 interaction triggers apoptosis not only in activated ECs but also in 
cancer cells expressing high level of cell-surface GRP78. Normal cells and 
benign tumor cells tend to express low level of cell-surface GRP78 and are 
resistant to ISM-induced apoptosis. Upon binding to GRP78, ISM is internalized 
into ECs through clathrin-dependent endocytosis that is essential for its 
proapoptotic activity. Once inside the cell, ISM co-targets with GRP78 to 
mitochondria where it interacts with ADP/ATP carriers on the inner membrane and 
blocks ATP transport from mitochondria to cytosol, thereby causing apoptosis. 
Hence, ISM is a novel proapoptotic ligand that targets cell-surface GRP78 to 
trigger apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. The restricted and 
high-level expression of cell-surface GRP78 on cancer cells and cancer ECs make 
them uniquely susceptible to ISM-targeted apoptosis. Indeed, systemic delivery 
of recombinant ISM potently suppressed subcutaneous 4T1 breast carcinoma and B16 
melanoma growth in mice by eliciting apoptosis selectively in the cancer cells 
and cancer ECs. Together, this work reveals a novel ISM-GRP78 apoptosis pathway 
and demonstrates the potential of ISM as a cancer-specific and dual-targeting 
anticancer agent.
