The function of S100A4, a member of the calcium-binding S100 protein family, has 
been associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. Although an essential 
pro-metastatic role of extracellular S100A4 in tumor progression has been 
demonstrated, the identification of the precise underlying mechanisms and 
protein partners (receptors) has remained elusive. To identify putative targets 
for extracellular S100A4, we screened a phage display peptide library using 
S100A4 as bait. We identified three independent peptide motifs with varying 
affinities for the S100A4 protein. Sequence analyses indicated that the most 
abundant peptide mimicked the F/YCC motif present in the epidermal growth factor 
domain of ErbB receptor ligands. S100A4 selectively interacted with a number of 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands, demonstrating highest affinity 
for amphiregulin. Importantly, we found that S100A4 stimulated EGFR/ErbB2 
receptor signaling and enhanced the amphiregulin-mediated proliferation of mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts. S100A4-neutralizing antibodies, as well as EGFR- and 
ErbB2 receptor-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, blocked these effects. The 
present results suggest that extracellular S100A4 regulates tumor progression by 
interacting with EGFR ligands, thereby enhancing EGFR/ErbB2 receptor signaling 
and cell proliferation. Structured digital abstract: * MINT-7256556: EGF
