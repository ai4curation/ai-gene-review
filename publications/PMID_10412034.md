Bin1 is a novel protein that specifically binds Myc and inhibits, at least in 
part, Myc transactivation. Bin1 seems to play a role in cell cycle control, 
acting as a tumor suppressor gene. Since MYC family genes play a regulatory role 
in the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of the nervous system, we 
studied the effects of the overexpression of the Myc-interacting protein, Bin1, 
in neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cell lines, which were chosen as neural cell 
system models. The major effects of BIN1 overexpression observed in 
undifferentiated neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cells were a significant 
reduction of cell growth, an increase in the G(0)/G(1) cell population and the 
induction of apoptosis. The trigger of programmed cell death by Bin1 is 
described for the first time. Bin1 overexpression in undifferentiated cells did 
not induce any maturation process as neither neuronal nor astrocyte 
differentiation markers were upregulated in neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cells, 
respectively. On the other side, the effects of Bin1 overproduction in 
neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cells committed towards neuronal and astrocyte 
differentiation, respectively, were different from those observed in 
undifferentiated cells. Although we did not evidence any triggering of 
programmed cell death, we did notice a further induction towards more 
differentiated phenotypes. Our studies suggest that Bin1 overexpression in 
neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cells can result in one of the following pathways: 
(1) suppressed cell proliferation, (2) induced differentiation, or (3) 
apoptosis. Thus, it appears that Bin1 operates through different pathways that 
involve activation of different genes: the chosen pathway however will depend on 
the proliferating or differentiated state of the cell.
