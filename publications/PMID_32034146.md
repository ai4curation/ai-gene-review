The XPF-ERCC1 heterodimer is a structure-specific endonuclease that is essential 
for nucleotide excision repair (NER) and interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair in 
mammalian cells. However, whether and how XPF binding to ERCC1 is regulated has 
not yet been established. Here, we show that TIP60, also known as KAT5, a 
haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor, directly acetylates XPF at Lys911 following 
UV irradiation or treatment with mitomycin C and that this acetylation is 
required for XPF-ERCC1 complex assembly and subsequent activation. 
Mechanistically, acetylation of XPF at Lys911 disrupts the Glu907-Lys911 salt 
bridge, thereby leading to exposure of a previously unidentified second binding 
site for ERCC1. Accordingly, loss of XPF acetylation impairs the damage-induced 
XPF-ERCC1 interaction, resulting in defects in both NER and ICL repair. Our 
results not only reveal a mechanism that regulates XPF-ERCC1 complex assembly 
and activation, but also provide important insight into the role of TIP60 in the 
maintenance of genome stability.
