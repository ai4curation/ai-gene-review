How loss-of-function of GATA3 contributes to the development of breast cancer is 
poorly understood. Here, we report that GATA3 nucleates a transcription 
repression program composed of G9A and MTA3-, but not MTA1- or MTA2-, 
constituted NuRD complex. Genome-wide analysis of the GATA3/G9A/NuRD(MTA3) 
targets identified a cohort of genes including ZEB2 that are critically involved 
in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell invasion. We demonstrate that 
the GATA3/G9A/NuRD(MTA3) complex inhibits the invasive potential of breast 
cancer cells in vitro and suppresses breast cancer metastasis in vivo. 
Strikingly, the expression of GATA3, G9A, and MTA3 is concurrently downregulated 
during breast cancer progression, leading to an elevated expression of ZEB2, 
which, in turn, represses the expression of G9A and MTA3 through the recruitment 
of G9A/NuRD(MTA1).
