We have utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact 
with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor (IR). We identified a human 
cDNA encoding a protein that appears to be the human homolog of the yeast MAD2 
protein, which we term hMAD2. The yeast MAD2 protein was first identified in a 
genetic screen to identify cell cycle checkpoint regulatory proteins, yet the 
mechanism by which MAD2 functions in cell cycle control is currently unclear. 
Here we show that hMAD2 requires the COOH-terminal 30 amino acids of the IR for 
interaction and that hMAD2 does not interact with the related insulin-like 
growth factor I receptor. Interestingly, hMAD2 does not require IR tyrosine 
autophosphorylation for interaction because it interacts with a kinase-dead IR 
in the yeast two-hybrid system. In support of this finding, hMAD2-GST fusions 
were found to interact strongly in vitro with receptors derived from 
noninsulin-stimulated cells. Furthermore, using two independent in vitro assays, 
IR activation was found to significantly reduce the interaction of hMAD2 with 
the IR. Lastly, we show that hMAD2 can be coimmunoprecipitated with the IR from 
Chinese hamster ovary IR cell lysates, suggesting that this interaction occurs 
in vivo in cells of mammalian origin. Our results suggest that hMAD2 represents 
a novel class of proteins that is specific for interaction with the IR as 
compared with the insulin-like growth factor I receptor and that interacts best 
with the inactive IR and is released upon receptor autophosphorylation. The 
function of hMAD2 and its potential role in insulin signaling remain to be 
elucidated.
