We cloned, expressed, and purified the hdeB gene product, which belongs to the 
hdeAB acid stress operon. We extracted HdeB from bacteria by the osmotic-shock 
procedure and purified it to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography and 
hydroxyapatite chromatography. Its identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry 
analysis. HdeB has a molecular mass of 10 kDa in sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which matches its expected molecular 
mass. We purified the acid stress chaperone HdeA in parallel in order to compare 
the two chaperones. The hdeA and hdeB mutants both display reduced viability 
upon acid stress, and only the HdeA/HdeB expression plasmid can restore their 
viability to close to the wild-type level, suggesting that both proteins are 
required for optimal protection of the bacterial periplasm against acid stress. 
Periplasmic extracts from both mutants aggregate at acidic pH, suggesting that 
HdeA and HdeB are required for protein solubilization. At pH 2, the aggregation 
of periplasmic extracts is prevented by the addition of HdeA, as previously 
reported, but is only slightly reduced by HdeB. At pH 3, however, HdeB is more 
efficient than HdeA in preventing periplasmic-protein aggregation. The 
solubilization of several model substrate proteins at acidic pH supports the 
hypothesis that, in vitro, HdeA plays a major role in protein solubilization at 
pH 2 and that both proteins are involved in protein solubilization at pH 3. Like 
HdeA, HdeB exposes hydrophobic surfaces at acidic pH, in accordance with the 
appearance of its chaperone properties at acidic pH. HdeB, like HdeA, 
dissociates from dimers at neutral pH into monomers at acidic pHs, but its 
dissociation is complete at pH 3 whereas that of HdeA is complete at a more 
acidic pH. Thus, we can conclude that Escherichia coli possesses two acid stress 
chaperones that prevent periplasmic-protein aggregation at acidic pH.
