The AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) gene family products, together with the 
AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID proteins, regulate auxin-mediated transcriptional 
activation/repression. The biological function(s) of most ARFs is poorly 
understood. Here, we report the identification and characterization of T-DNA 
insertion lines for 18 of the 23 ARF gene family members in Arabidopsis 
thaliana. Most of the lines fail to show an obvious growth phenotype except of 
the previously identified arf2/hss, arf3/ett, arf5/mp, and arf7/nph4 mutants, 
suggesting that there are functional redundancies among the ARF proteins. 
Subsequently, we generated double mutants. arf7 arf19 has a strong auxin-related 
phenotype not observed in the arf7 and arf19 single mutants, including severely 
impaired lateral root formation and abnormal gravitropism in both hypocotyl and 
root. Global gene expression analysis revealed that auxin-induced gene 
expression is severely impaired in the arf7 single and arf7 arf19 double 
mutants. For example, the expression of several genes, such as those encoding 
members of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES domain proteins and AUXIN-REGULATED GENE 
INVOLVED IN ORGAN SIZE, are disrupted in the double mutant. The data suggest 
that the ARF7 and ARF19 proteins play essential roles in auxin-mediated plant 
development by regulating both unique and partially overlapping sets of target 
genes. These observations provide molecular insight into the unique and 
overlapping functions of ARF gene family members in Arabidopsis.
