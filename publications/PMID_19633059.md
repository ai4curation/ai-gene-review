The actin cytoskeleton of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be altered 
rapidly in response to external cues. We reported previously that S. cerevisiae 
responds to low-pH stress by transiently depolarizing its actin cytoskeleton, 
and that this step requires a mitogen-activated protein kinase, high osmolarity 
glycerol 1 (Hog1p). This study further investigated the components involved in 
this actin reorganization at pH 3.0. Gene deletions on the Sln1p branch of the 
HOG pathway completely blocked actin depolarization, suggesting that Hog1p 
activation depends mainly on the osmosensor Sln1p. The protein-synthesis 
inhibitor cycloheximide did not influence the time course of actin 
depolarization, suggesting that the depolarization is a direct effect of the HOG 
pathway. Deletion of the scaffolding protein, Spa2p, or the Spa2p-interacting 
protein Pea2p, markedly inhibited the depolarization, and further deletion of 
the formin protein, Bni1p, notably delayed actin repolarization. Our results 
suggest the involvement of polarisome proteins, such as Spa2p, Pea2p and Bni1p, 
but not Bud6p, in Hog1p-dependent reorganization of the yeast actin cytoskeleton 
at low pH.
