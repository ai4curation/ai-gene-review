Intracellular RNA viruses are sensed by receptors retinoic acid-inducible gene 
I/MDA5, which trigger formation of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) 
complex on mitochondria. Consequently, this leads to the activation of 
TNFR-associated factor family member-associated NF-ÎºB activator-binding kinase 1 
(TBK1) and phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). It remains to be 
elucidated how MAVS activates TBK1/IRF3. In this study, we report that 
IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) is significantly 
induced upon RNA virus infection. Ectopic expression or knockdown of IFIT3 
could, respectively, enhance or impair IRF3-mediated gene expression. 
Mechanistically, the tetratrico-peptide repeat motif (E164/E165) of IFIT3 
interacts with the N terminus (K38) of TBK1, thus bridging TBK1 to MAVS on the 
mitochondrion. Disruption of this interaction markedly attenuates the activation 
of TBK1 and IRF3. Furthermore, host antiviral responses are significantly 
boosted or crippled in the presence or absence of IFIT3. Collectively, our study 
characterizes IFIT3 as an important modulator in innate immunity, revealing a 
new function of the IFIT family proteins (IFN-induced protein with 
tetratricopeptide repeats).
