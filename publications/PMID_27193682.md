In eukaryotic transcription initiation, a large multi-subunit pre-initiation 
complex (PIC) that assembles at the core promoter is required for the opening of 
the duplex DNA and identification of the start site for transcription by RNA 
polymerase II. Here we use cryo-electron microscropy (cryo-EM) to determine 
near-atomic resolution structures of the human PIC in a closed state (engaged 
with duplex DNA), an open state (engaged with a transcription bubble), and an 
initially transcribing complex (containing six base pairs of DNA-RNA hybrid). 
Our studies provide structures for previously uncharacterized components of the 
PIC, such as TFIIE and TFIIH, and segments of TFIIA, TFIIB and TFIIF. Comparison 
of the different structures reveals the sequential conformational changes that 
accompany the transition from each state to the next throughout the 
transcription initiation process. This analysis illustrates the key role of 
TFIIB in transcription bubble stabilization and provides strong structural 
support for a translocase activity of XPB.
