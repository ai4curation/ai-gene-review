Autophagy delivers cytoplasmic constituents to autophagolysosomes and is linked 
to both innate and adaptive immunity. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling 
induces autophagy and recruits Beclin-1, the mammalian homolog of yeast Atg6, to 
the receptor complex. We found that tumor necrosis factor receptor 
(TNFR)-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-mediated, Lys(63) (K63)-linked ubiquitination 
of Beclin-1 is critical for TLR4-triggered autophagy in macrophages. Two 
TRAF6-binding motifs in Beclin-1 facilitated the binding of TRAF6 and the 
ubiquitination of Beclin-1. Lys(117), which is strategically located in the 
Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain of Beclin-1, was a major site for K63-linked 
ubiquitination. The deubiquitinating enzyme A20 reduced the extent of K63-linked 
ubiquitination of Beclin-1 and limited the induction of autophagy in response to 
TLR signaling. Treatment of macrophages with either interferon-gamma or 
interleukin-1 also triggered the K63-linked ubiquitination of Beclin-1 and the 
formation of autophagosomes. These results indicate that the status of 
K63-linked ubiquitination of Beclin-1 plays a key role in regulating autophagy 
during inflammatory responses.

Abstract

Autophagy delivers cytoplasmic constituents to autolysosomes and has been linked to both innate and adaptive immunity. Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling induces autophagy and recruits Beclin 1 to the receptor complex. Here we show that Traf6-mediated lysine (K) 63-linked ubiquitination of Beclin 1 is critical for TLR4 triggered autophagy in macrophages. Two Traf6 binding motifs in Beclin 1 facilitated Traf6 binding and its ubiquitination. Beclin 1 K117, strategically located in the Beclin 1 BH3 domain is a major site for K63-linked ubiquitination. A20, a known deubiquitinating enzyme, reduced Beclin 1 K63-linked ubiquitination, and limited the induction of autophagy following TLR signaling. Treatment of macrophages with either interferon-γ or IL-1 also triggered K63-linked ubiquitination of Beclin 1 and autophagosome formation. These results indicate that the status of Beclin 1 K63-linked ubiquitination plays a key role in regulating autophagy during inflammatory responses.

INTRODUCTION

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) contain leucine-rich repeat regions that recognize specific molecular patterns present in microbial components. TLR stimulation leads to the activation of innate immunity and helps to instruct the development of antigen-specific acquired immunity ( 1 , 2 ). TLRs contain intracellular Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains that trigger signals via homotypic interactions with proximal adaptor proteins such as MyD88. Upon ligand activation, MyD88 recruits IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)-1 and IRAK-4. IRAK-1 is phosphorylated resulting in the recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (Traf6). This is followed by Traf6 autoubiquitination with K63-linked ubiquitin chains and K63-linked IRAK-1 ubiquitination. Ubiquitin modified Traf6 activates the TGF-ß-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1)/TAK-1-binding protein complex, which phosphorylates the inhibitor of κB (IκΒ) kinase (IKK) complex. This results in IκB phosphorylation and degradation, which promotes the translocation of NF-κB into nuclei and the induction of inflammatory cytokines production as well as A20 expression. A20 functions both as a deubiquitinating enzyme and as an E3 ligase ( 3 ). A20 helps terminate the activation of NF-κB by deubiquitinating Traf6. A20-deficient mice exhibit spontaneous inflammation, cachexia and premature death that are TLR signaling dependent ( 4 , 5 ).

TLRs also use MyD88 and the adaptor TRIF to trigger autophagy in macrophages ( 6 – 8 ). Autophagy is a cellular response to starvation as well as a quality control system that can remove damaged organelles and long-lived proteins from the cytoplasm. Autophagy plays a role in programmed cell death; the promotion and prevention of cancer; neurodegeneration; major histocompatibility complex class II antigen presentation; and cellular defense by removing intracellular pathogens ( 9 ). Numerous lines of evidence indicate that autophagy is involved in both innate and adaptive immunity against intracellular protozoa, bacteria and viruses ( 10 – 13 ). Engagement of TLR4 recruits not only MyD88, but also Beclin 1 into the TLR4-signaling complex ( 7 ). Beclin 1 is the mammalian homologue of yeast Atg6, a key component of a Class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex (PI3KC3) that initiates autophagosome formation by helping to localize other autophagy proteins to the pre-autophagosomal membrane ( 14 ). Oligomerization of Beclin 1 may allow it to serve as scaffold for other molecules known to associate with Beclin 1. Exposure of macrophages to TLR4 ligands reduces the association of Beclin-1 with Bcl2, an anti-apoptotic protein known to bind Beclin 1 and to reduce autophagy ( 15 ). The mechanism by which prosurvival proteins such as Bcl2 reduce autophagy is still not understood. It is known that the interaction of Bcl2 with Beclin 1 interferes with complex formation between PI3KC3 and Beclin 1. However, the PI3KC3 binding site and the BH3 domain of Beclin 1, which binds Bcl2 proteins, do not overlap ( 16 , 17 ). One possibility is that Bcl2 like proteins inhibit Beclin 1 oligomerization, which normally facilitates the binding of interacting proteins such as PI3KC3.

Previously, we had noted that immunoprecipitates prepared from macrophages using an agonistic TLR4 antibody contained Beclin 1 that had a higher than expected molecular mass and a smeared appearance on SDS-PAGE. In this study we tested whether Beclin 1 undergoes ubiquitination, examined whether the ubiquitination is K63-or K48-linked, and determined the physiologic significance of this modification. This has led us to the identification of a key ubiquitination site on Beclin 1. We have also shown that similar to their role in the regulation of NF-κB activation, TRAF6 functions as an E3 ligase to ubiquinate Beclin 1 and that A20 negatively regulates Beclin 1 ubiquitination to control the level of autophagy elicited by TLR4 signaling.

DISCUSSION

Our studies have provided several insights into the regulation TLR-induced autophagy in macrophages. First, we showed that the engagement of TLR4 results in the modification of Beclin 1 by the addition of K63-linked ubiquitin chains. Second, we provided evidence that Traf6 functions as an ubiquitin ligase in this reaction and that A20 is a critical enzyme for regulating the deubiquitination of Beclin 1. Third, we mapped two Traf6 binding sites in Beclin 1 that contribute to the ubiquitination of Beclin 1. Fourth, we identified K117 as a key site in Beclin 1 for linking ubiquitin chains. Fifth, the ubiquitination of Beclin 1 on K117 enhances its multimerization and may augment Beclin 1 mediated increases in PI3KC3 enzymatic activity. Finally, we have provided evidence that the ubiquitination of Beclin 1 amplifies TLR-induced autophagy and that A20 plays an important counter-regulatory role. These results indicate that an intimate association exists between the TLR-induced activation of the NF-κB pathway and the induction of autophagy in macrophages.

The transcription factor NF-κB has a pivotal role in inflammation and in adaptive immunity. Its translocation to the nucleus triggers the expression of a wide variety of genes implicated in the initiation and propagation of the host innate and adaptive immune responses ( 28 ). Pathogen-associated molecular patterns from bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites are recognized by TLRs on immune cells. Engagement of TLRs triggers NF-κB activation, which critically depends on the E3 ligase activity of Traf6 ( 29 ). TLR signaling induces A20 expression, which functions to limit NF-κB activation by deubiquitinating Traf6 ( 3 ). Our findings indicate that the Traf6 and A20 function in an analogous fashion to control the induction and termination of TLR-induced autophagy in macrophages. In this signaling pathway Traf6 likely directly recruits Beclin 1 resulting in the ubiquitination of Beclin 1. Ubiquitination of Beclin 1 enhances its multimerization and augments the associated PI3KC3 activity. TLR signaling induces NF-κB translocation to the nucleus and A20 transcriptional activation leading to a reduction in Beclin 1 ubiquitination, which acts to limits autophagy in macrophages.

A20 deficient mice are cachexic, exhibit severe tissue damage in multiple organs, are hypersensitive to LPS and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and suffer neonatal lethality ( 4 ). Studies of mice doubly deficient for A20 and TNF or for A20 and TNF receptor 1 indicate that A20 is required to terminate TLR-induced NF-κB activation and proinflammatory gene expression in macrophages ( 30 ). Interestingly, A20 and MyD88 double deficient mice have reduced inflammation and are protected from the premature lethality observed in A20 deficient mice ( 5 ). These observations indicate that A20 functions in a critical negative feedback loop to regulate TLR signaling. Our findings indicate that A20 restricted LPS-induced autophagy by reducing the ubiquitination of Beclin 1 acting perhaps on both Traf6 and Beclin 1. Besides its deubiquitinating activity A20 also functions of as an E3 ligase to trigger K48-linked ubiquitination of a targeted protein, which leads to its degradation. For example A20 is known to function as an E3 ligase for RIP1 ( 3 ). However, we did not detect any degradation of Beclin 1 in LPS stimulated macrophages arguing that A20 does not function as an E3 ligase for Beclin 1.

Human TRAF6 has been previously linked to the induction of autophagy in macrophages. Signaling through the cell surface molecule CD40 activates macrophages to kill Toxoplasma gondii through a Beclin 1 dependent process that leads to the recruitment of autophagosomes around the parasitophorous vacuole. This causes the lysosomal degradation of the parasite ( 31 ). The intracytoplasmic tail of CD40 has a TRAF6 binding site that has been shown to be important in this signaling pathway ( 32 ). In this model TRAF6 signaling enhances autocrine Tumor Necrosis Factor-α production, which synergizes with downstream TRAF6 signals to recruit autophagosome markers to the parasitophorous vacuole ( 32 ). Based on the studies reported here we would suggest that TRAF6 and A20 would also regulate the level of Beclin 1 ubiquitination following CD40 stimulation of macrophages.

The antiapoptotic protein Bcl2, binds to BH3 domain of Beclin 1 and attenuates autophagy ( 15 , 16 ). TLR stimulation of Raw 267.4 cells reduces the association between Bcl2 and Beclin 1 ( 7 ). This could arise as a consequence of the ubiquitination of Beclin 1 at lysine 117, which is located in the BH3 domain of Beclin 1 and adjacent to a critical amino acid for the Bcl-2/Beclin 1 interaction. The interpretation of preliminary experiments to address this issue has been complicated by the presence of endogenous Beclin 1 in Raw 267.4 cells and the tendency of Beclin 1 to multimerize following LPS stimulation. However, they do suggest that the decrease in the Beclin 1/Bcl-2 interaction that occurs upon LPS activation does not happen when with the K117R mutation is present in Beclin 1. Starvation can lead to c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) mediated phosphorylation of Bcl2, which reduces the association between Bcl2 and Beclin 1, and enhances autophagy ( 33 ). In our study starvation also led to the ubiquitination of Beclin 1, which could further reduce the interaction between Bcl-2 and Beclin 1 contributing to starvation-induced autophagy.

Besides undergoing K63-linked ubiquitination, Beclin 1 also possesses a UBD. Numerous cellular processes depend upon the interaction between ubiquitinated proteins and intracellular proteins with a UBD. Nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin rely on the recognition of monomeric ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains branched from lysines other than K48 and constitute an intracellular signaling network. Despite marked structural differences between the various characterized UBDs they share a general mode of interaction with ubiquitin ( 19 ). A hydrophobic surface on the UBD contacts a hydrophobic pocket centered on ubiquitin isoleucine 44. Although many UBD share little specificity for the different types of ubiquitin chains some do ( 20 ). In our study Beclin 1 exhibited a strong preference for K63-versus K48-linked ubiquitin peptides. The basis of this selectivity is currently unknown. Little structural information is available to make a prediction on which region in Beclin 1 serves as a UBD. Besides its BH3-like domain, Beclin 1 has a central coiled-coil domain, and an evolutionarily conserved domain, which is essential for PI3KC3 binding. It lacks the NZF fingers (Npl4 zinc finger) that Trabid utilizes to bind K63-linked ubiquitin chains ( 34 ). We are attempting to map the UBD in Beclin 1 by expressing various truncated proteins.

Although our investigations have shown that LPS trigger, IFN-γ, and starvation trigger the ubiquitination of Beclin 1 and autophagy, whether Traf6 and A20 regulate Beclin 1 ubiquitination following starvation or IFN-γ treatment is currently unknown. We are testing whether modifying Traf6 and A20 expression affects IFN-γ or starvation induced Beclin 1 ubiquitination and autophagy. If Traf6 and A20 do not, other ubiquitin modifying enzymes must exist that regulate IFN-γ- and starvation-induced autophagy. Recently it has been reported that the IFN-γ-induced autoantigen Ro52 is an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates IRF-8 resulting in enhanced cytokine expression in macrophages ( 35 ). As such it is a candidate to have a role in IFN-γ-induced ubiquitination of Beclin 1.

In conclusion, in TLR4-induced autophagy in macrophages Traf6 and A20 function in an analogous fashion to their defined roles in controlling NF-κB activation. The Traf6/A20 axis by controlling the level of Beclin 1 ubiquitination acts as a rheostat to up- or down-regulate autophagy. IFN-γ exposure and amino acid starvation also cause the ubiquitination of Beclin 1 suggesting that K63-linked ubiquitination of Beclin 1 may be a shared mechanism that different inductive stimuli use to trigger autophagosome formation.
