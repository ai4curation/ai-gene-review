BACKGROUND: Uroplakins (UPs), urothelium-specific transmembrane proteins, are 
present only in urothelia and may be good candidates as tumor markers specific 
for transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs). We investigated the expression of UP 
genes in the tissues and peripheral blood of patients with TCCs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the nucleotide sequences of UPs by a 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method. We then investigated UP gene 
expression in tissues from 12 patients with TCC by reverse transcription 
(RT)-PCR. We also investigated UP gene expression in peripheral blood of 12 
other patients with TCC by nested RT-PCR. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies 
against UPs were generated using synthesized polypeptides and recombinant 
protein, respectively, as immunogens.
RESULTS: We determined the nucleotide sequence of human UP-Ib, UP-II, and UP-III 
cDNAs and produced gene-specific primer pairs for each and for UP-Ia. UP genes 
were expressed in both cancerous and non-cancerous urothelia taken from all 
patients examined (as detected by RT-PCR). The detection sensitivity of our 
assay system was such that 1 cancer cell could be detected in 5 mL of peripheral 
blood. UP gene-expression was also detected in the peripheral blood of 3 
patients with metastatic TCC, but not from 9 patients with non-metastatic TCC or 
from 3 healthy volunteers. Antibodies against both UP-Ia and UP-Ib reacted with 
the cell membrane of TCCs.
CONCLUSIONS: UPs may be employed as tumor markers for TCCs, because they are 
highly conserved and well expressed in non-cancerous and cancerous cells. 
Furthermore, detection of UP gene expression in blood by nested RT-PCR may 
provide helpful information in the diagnosis and management of TCCs. We are 
currently expanding an immunohistochemical study by targeting a larger number of 
patients to examine the clinical usefulness of these antibodies.
