Maintenance of chromosomal stability relies on coordination between various 
processes that are critical for proper chromosome segregation in mitosis. Here 
we show that monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) kinase, which is essential for the 
mitotic checkpoint, also controls correction of improper chromosome attachments. 
We report that Borealin/DasraB, a member of the complex that regulates the 
Aurora B kinase, is directly phosphorylated by Mps1 on residues that are crucial 
for Aurora B activity and chromosome alignment. As a result, cells lacking Mps1 
kinase activity fail to efficiently align chromosomes due to impaired Aurora B 
function at centromeres, leaving improper attachments uncorrected. Strikingly, 
Borealin/DasraB bearing phosphomimetic mutations restores Aurora B activity and 
alignment in Mps1-depleted cells. Mps1 thus coordinates attachment error 
correction and checkpoint signaling, two crucial responses to unproductive 
chromosome attachments.
