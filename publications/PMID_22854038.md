During meiosis, accurate coordination of the completion of homologous 
recombination and synaptonemal complex (SC) disassembly during the prophase to 
metaphase I (G2/MI) transition is essential to avoid aneuploid gametes and 
infertility. Previous studies have shown that kinase activity is required to 
promote meiotic prophase exit. The first step of the G2/MI transition is the 
disassembly of the central element components of the SC; however, the kinase(s) 
required to trigger this process remains unknown. Here we assess roles of 
polo-like kinases (PLKs) in mouse spermatocytes, both in vivo and during 
prophase exit induced ex vivo by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. All 
four PLKs are expressed during the first wave of spermatogenesis. Only PLK1 (not 
PLK2-4) localizes to the SC during the G2/MI transition. The SC central element 
proteins SYCP1, TEX12 and SYCE1 are phosphorylated during the G2/MI transition. 
However, treatment of pachytene spermatocytes with the PLK inhibitor BI 2536 
prevented the okadaic-acid-induced meiotic prophase exit and inhibited 
phosphorylation of the central element proteins as well as their removal from 
the SC. Phosphorylation assays in vitro demonstrated that PLK1, but not PLK2-4, 
phosphorylates central element proteins SYCP1 and TEX12. These findings provide 
mechanistic details of the first stage of SC disassembly in mammalian 
spermatocytes, and reveal that PLK-mediated phosphorylation of central element 
proteins is required for meiotic prophase exit.
