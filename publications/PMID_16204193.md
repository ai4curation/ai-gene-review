The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway promotes pattern formation and cell 
proliferation in Drosophila and vertebrates. Hh is a ligand that binds and 
represses the Patched (Ptc) receptor and thereby releases the latent activity of 
the multipass membrane protein Smoothened (Smo), which is essential for 
transducing the Hh signal. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the Hh signaling pathway 
has undergone considerable divergence. Surprisingly, obvious Smo and Hh homologs 
are absent whereas PTC, PTC-related (PTR), and a large family of nematode 
Hh-related (Hh-r) proteins are present. We find that the number of PTC-related 
and Hh-r proteins has expanded in C. elegans, and that this expansion occurred 
early in Nematoda. Moreover, the function of these proteins appears to be 
conserved in Caenorhabditis briggsae. Given our present understanding of the Hh 
signaling pathway, the absence of Hh and Smo raises many questions about the 
evolution and the function of the PTC, PTR, and Hh-r proteins in C. elegans. To 
gain insights into their roles, we performed a global survey of the phenotypes 
produced by RNA-mediated interference (RNAi). Our study reveals that these genes 
do not require Smo for activity and that they function in multiple aspects of C. 
elegans development, including molting, cytokinesis, growth, and pattern 
formation. Moreover, a subset of the PTC, PTR, and Hh-r proteins have the same 
RNAi phenotypes, indicating that they have the potential to participate in the 
same processes.
