Cellular responses to DNA damage are crucial for maintaining genome integrity, 
virus infection, and preventing the development of cancer. Hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) infection and the expression of the HCV nonstructural protein NS3 and core 
protein have been proposed as factors involved in the induction of 
double-stranded DNA breaks and enhancement of the mutation frequency of cellular 
genes. Since DNA damage sensors, such as the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated 
kinase (ATM), ATM- and Rad3-related kinase (ATR), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 
(PARP-1), and checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), play central roles in the response to 
genotoxic stress, we hypothesized that these sensors might affect HCV 
replication. To test this hypothesis, we examined the level of HCV RNA in 
HuH-7-derived cells stably expressing short hairpin RNA targeted to ATM, ATR, 
PARP-1, or Chk2. Consequently, we found that replication of both genome-length 
HCV RNA (HCV-O, genotype 1b) and the subgenomic replicon RNA were notably 
suppressed in ATM- or Chk2-knockdown cells. In addition, the RNA replication of 
HCV-JFH1 (genotype 2a) and the release of core protein into the culture 
supernatants were suppressed in these knockdown cells after inoculation of the 
cell culture-generated HCV. Consistent with these observations, ATM kinase 
inhibitor could suppress the HCV RNA replication. Furthermore, we observed that 
HCV NS3-NS4A interacted with ATM and that HCV NS5B interacted with both ATM and 
Chk2. Taken together, these results suggest that the ATM signaling pathway is 
critical for HCV RNA replication and may represent a novel target for the 
clinical treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C.
