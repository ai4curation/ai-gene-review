Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the pyridoxal-50-phosphate-dependent 
condensation of L-serine and L-homocysteine to form L-cystathionine in the first 
step of the transsulfuration pathway. Although effective expression systems for 
recombinant human CBS (hCBS) have been developed, they require multiple 
chromatographic steps as well as proteolytic cleavage to remove the fusion 
partner. Therefore, a series of five expression constructs, each incorporating a 
6-His tag, were developed to enable the efficient purification of hCBS via 
immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Two of the constructs express 
hCBS in fusion with a protein partner, while the others bear only the affinity 
tag. The addition of an amino-terminal, 6-His tag, in the absence of a protein 
fusion partner and in the absence or presence ofa protease-cleavable linker, was 
found to be sufficient for the purification of soluble hCBS and resulted in 
enzyme with 86-91% heme saturation and with activity similar to that reported 
for other hCBS expression constructs. The continuous assay for L-Cth production, 
employing cystathionine beta-lyase and L-lactate dehydrogenase as coupling 
enzymes, was employed here for the first time to determine the steady-state 
kinetic parameters of hCBS, via global analysis, and revealed previously 
unreported substrate inhibition by L-Hcys (K(i)(L-HCYS) = 2.1 +/- 0.2 mM). The 
kinetic parameters for the hCBS-catalyzed hydrolysis of L-Cth toL-Ser and L-Hcys 
were also determined and the k(cat)/K(m)(L-CTH) of this reaction is only 
approximately 2-fold lower than the k(cat)/K(m)(L-SER) of the physiological, 
condensation reaction.
