Identification of membrane proteomes remains challenging. Here, we present a 
simple, fast, and scalable off-line procedure based on three-phase partitioning 
with butanol to fractionate membrane proteomes in combination with both in-gel 
and in-solution digestions and mass spectrometry. This should help to further 
accelerate the field of membrane proteomics. Using this new strategy, we 
analyzed the salt-stripped thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts of Arabidopsis 
thaliana. 242 proteins were identified, at least 40% of which are integral 
membrane proteins. The functions of 86 proteins are unknown; these include 
proteins with TPR, PPR, rhodanese, and DnaJ domains. These proteins were 
combined with all known thylakoid proteins and chloroplast (associated) envelope 
proteins, collected from primary literature, resulting in 714 non-redundant 
proteins. They were assigned to functional categories using a classification 
developed for MapMan (Thimm, O., Blasing, O., Gibon, Y., Nagel, A., Meyer, S., 
Kruger, P., Selbig, J., Muller, L. A., Rhee, S. Y., and Stitt, M. (2004) Plant 
J. 37, 914-939), updated with information from primary literature. The analysis 
elucidated the likely location of many membrane proteins, including 190 proteins 
of unknown function, holding the key to better understanding the two membrane 
systems. The three-phase partitioning procedure added a new level of dynamic 
resolution to the known thylakoid proteome. An automated strategy was developed 
to track possible ambiguous identifications to more than one gene model or 
family member. Mass spectrometry search results, ambiguities, and functional 
classifications can be searched via the Plastid Proteome Database.
