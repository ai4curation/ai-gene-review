The biochemical mechanisms that underlie hypoxia-induced NF-kappaB activity have 
remained largely undefined. Here, we find that prolonged hypoxia-induced 
NF-kappaB activation is restricted to cancer cell lines infected with high-risk 
human papillomavirus (HPV) serotypes. The HPV-encoded E6 protein is necessary 
and sufficient for prolonged hypoxia-induced NF-kappaB activation in these 
systems. The molecular target of E6 in the NF-kappaB pathway is the CYLD lysine 
63 (K63) deubiquitinase, a negative regulator of the NF-kappaB pathway. 
Specifically, hypoxia stimulates E6-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal 
degradation of CYLD. Given the established role of NF-kappaB in human 
carcinogenesis, these findings provide a potential molecular/viral link between 
hypoxia and the adverse clinical outcomes observed in HPV-associated 
malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

It has been over 50 years since the seminal observation by Thomlinson and Gray that intratumoral hypoxia is associated with resistance to radiation therapy ( Thomlinson and Gray, 1955 ). In the ensuing decades, mounting clinical and experimental evidence has established the influence of hypoxia on tumor biology. For example, the identification of intratumoral hypoxia in patients with cervical and head and neck cancer is associated with an increased risk for local recurrence after radiation, the presence of lymphatic and hematogenous metastases, and reduced overall survival ( Tatum et al., 2006 ). Moreover, hypoxia is associated with resistance to not only radiation therapy but also cytotoxic chemotherapy ( Harris, 2002 ; Le et al., 2004 ; Subarsky and Hill, 2003 ). Additional investigations have further extended the importance of hypoxia in the malignant progression of other tumor models, such as sarcomas, breast cancer and prostate cancer ( Tatum et al., 2006 ; Vaupel et al., 2001 ; Vaupel et al., 2002 ).

As a solid tumor grows, hypoxia invariably occurs as a consequence of aberrant neo-angiogenesis, cancer associated anemia that results in reduced oxygen carrying capacity of blood, increased oxygen demand of the growing tumor, and abnormal oxygen diffusion due to imbalances in directional microcirculation ( Hockel and Vaupel, 2001 ). In addition to reduced oxygen tension, the hypoxic environment is also characterized by acidosis and diminished micronutrient availability. Thus, during carcinogenesis, pre-malignant and malignant cells must adapt to the harsh hypoxic microenvironment and does so through both genomic and non-genomic mechanisms ( Hockel and Vaupel, 2001 ). Indeed, hypoxia results in genomic instability manifested by increased rates of gene amplification, point mutation, and chromosomal rearrangement that add to the genomic complexity of tumor cells ( Hockel and Vaupel, 2001 ; Reynolds et al., 1996 ; Young et al., 1988 ). Through selection pressures, this genomic instability leads to outgrowth of clones which manifest survival and even proliferation advantages as well as resistance to anti-neoplastic therapy.

Non-genomic cellular adaptations to hypoxia have been more well studied and include upregulation of angiogenesis, oxygen transport, glycolysis, and glucose uptake ( Harris, 2002 ). Many of these adaptations are mediated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible alpha (HIFα), which drives expression of hypoxia-response genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor . In addition to HIFα, other transcription factors have been reported to be activated by hypoxia. For example, hypoxia-induced activation of the NF-κB family of transcription factors has been observed in some tumor models ( Koong et al., 1994 ; Royds et al., 1998 ). NF-κB is a family of transcription factors that induces a transcriptional response that results in the expression of proteins that promote survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis ( Baldwin, 2001 ), .Accordingly, hypoxia-induced NF-κB activation represents another potential mechanism whereby tumor cells could adapt to the inhospitable hypoxic milieu.

Whereas constitutive NF-κB activity has been implicated in the malignant progression of numerous hematologic and solid malignancies ( Basseres and Baldwin, 2006 ), a comprehensive analysis of the timing and duration of hypoxia-induced NF-κB activation has not been performed to our knowledge. Moreover, the biochemical mechanisms that underlie hypoxia-induced NF-κB activity have remained largely undefined. In the current study, we observed that prolonged hypoxia-induced NF-κB activation was restricted to HPV-positive cancer cells and was mediated by an effect of the HPV-encoded E6 protein on polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the CYLD K63 deubiquitinase.

DISCUSSION

HPV is an established carcinogen in humans. Abundant epidemiologic and experimental evidence has led to the recognition of HPV as causative agent in 90–98% of cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix ( Psyrri and DiMaio, 2008 ), which is the second most common cancer in women worldwide with an annual incidence and mortality of 500,000 and 200,000, respectively ( Ellenson and Wu, 2004 ; Waggoner,2003 ). HPV types 16 and 18 account for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases ( Psyrri and DiMaio, 2008 ) with other high-risk types accounting for the majority of the remaining cases. Moreover, HPV infection is thought to be causally related to other squamous cell carcinomas, including vulvar, anal, penile and oropharyngeal cancers ( Psyrri and DiMaio, 2008 ).

In HPV-associated cancer, HPV DNA is typically integrated into the cellular genomic DNA, and most of the viral genome is deleted except for the E6 and E7 genes ( Psyrri and DiMaio, 2008 ). E7 is known for its ability to bind to and inhibit pRB function, whereas E6 is most notorious for its role in ubiquitination and degradation of p53 ( Narisawa-Saito et al., 2007 ). However, p53-independent functions of E6 are well described, and, in fact, p53 elimination is not required for cellular immortalization by E6 ( Kiyono et al., 1998 ). For example, E6 mediates the degradation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAK and the TSC1 tumor suppressor and activates cellular telomerase ( Klingelhutz et al., 1996 ; Narisawa-Saito et al., 2007 ). Here, we describe a role for the HPV-encoded E6 protein in a biochemical response to hypoxia. Specifically, through its ability to induce sustained NF-κB activation in response to reduced ambient oxygen tension, E6 mediates a cellular adaptation to prolonged hypoxia. Importantly, we found that prolonged hypoxia-induced NF-κB activation is not a generalized phenomenon amongst cancers, but rather is limited to cancer cells that are infected with high risk HPV. The mechanism underlying hypoxia-induced NF-κB activation involves E6- mediated ubiquitination and degradation the CYLD K63 deubiquitinase, which releases components in the NF-κB signaling cascade from the inhibitory effects of CYLD. Although the E6-mediated effects on CYLD and the NF-κB pathway are intensified under hypoxic conditions, we did consistently observe similar but less pronounced effects in normoxia ( Figures 2B and I ). Thus, in ambient oxygen tension, E6 gene silencing in HPV-positive cells led to NF-κB and IKKβ activation and increased CYLD expression, whereas ectopic expression of E6 in HPV-negative cells resulted in NF-κB activation and CYLD degradation. These latter effects are consistent with the results of the protein-protein interactions studies, which demonstrated that E6 does in fact bind to CYLD under normoxic conditions, albeit to a lesser degree than under hypoxia.

The heightened ubiquitination and degradation of CYLD are recapitulated by hydroxylase inhibition, which suggests that post-translational hydroxylation plays a central role in E6-dependent, hypoxia-induced of CYLD degradation. In a preliminary analysis of the CYLD primary amino acid sequence, we did not detect any consensus prolyl hydroxylation sites (LXXLAP). CYLD does harbor a potential asparagine hydroxylation site, wherein the asparagine at position 646 is preceded by valine (position 643) in the context of leucine(s) located seven to eight positions amino-terminal to the asparagine ( Cockman et al., 2006 ). This juxtaposition of valine to asparagine is required for optimal substrate recognition by the asparaginyl hydroxylase known as factor inhibitor of HIF (FIH) ( Linke et al., 2004 ). However, these amino acids are not found within an ankyrin repeat domain, which is the basis for substrate recognition by FIH ( Cockman et al., 2006 ). Similarly, the E6 sequence does not contain either prolyl or asparaginyl hydroxylation sites. Thus, the details of hypoxia mediated post-translational regulation of the E6-CYLD interaction remain to elucidated, and may involve a previously unidentified oxygen-sensing hydroxylase. It is also plausible that post-translational hydroxylation may take place on a protein involved in formation of a protein complex that includes E6 and CYLD, whereby hydroxylation impairs complex formation and, by extension, the ability of E6 to target CYLD for ubiquitination.

Interactions between p53 and NF-κB have been reported. On the one hand, mutual transcriptional repression has been reported between p53 and NF-κB, yet p53 has also been shown to activate NF-κB in some contexts ( Ikeda et al., 2000 ; Wadgaonkar et al., 1999 ; Webster and Perkins, 1999 ; Huang et al., 2007 ; Ryan et al., 2000 ). Thus, in the interpretation of the experiments involving RNAi of E6, we considered that the inhibition of constitutive and hypoxia-induced NF-κB through suppression of endogenous E6 protein could potentially be attributed to p53-dependent effects on NF-κB. Specifically, restoration of p53 expression by E6 RNAi could result in reduced NF-κB transcriptional activity if mutual transcriptional repression between p53 and NF-κB were operative in HPV-positive cells. However, it has recently been shown that in models in which p53 suppresses NF-κB transcriptional activity, NF-κB DNA binding is actually enhanced and DNA bound NF-κB undergoes p53-dependent post-translational modifications that result in transcriptional inhibition of NF-κB ( Kawauchi et al., 2008 ). Yet we observed decreased NF-κB DNA binding in response to E6 RNAi in HPV-positive cells ( Figures 2B and S3B ). Moreover, since p53-dependent transcriptional inhibition of NF-κB does not appear to involve TRAF6 or CYLD ( Ikeda et al., 2000 ; Wadgaonkar et al., 1999 ), and p53 expression remains undetectable under hypoxic conditions due to the presence of E6 ( Figure 2A ), we cannot indict p53 as a mediator of hypoxia-induced NF-κB activation in HPV-positive cells.

In addition to the prolonged hypoxia-induced NF-κB activation observed in HPV-positive cells, we observed that some HPV-negative tumor models are capable of transient NF-κB activation during hypoxia ( Figures 1F and S2B ). A mechanism for E6-independent NF-κB activation is suggested by a recent report in which IKKβ was shown to be negatively regulated by prolyl hydroxylase 1 (PHD-1), such that under conditions in which oxygen is a limiting substrate (i.e. hypoxia), PHD-1 activity is diminished and IKKβ activity is augmented ( Cummins et al., 2006 ). To account for the varied hypoxia-induced NF-κB responses that we observed, we propose the following model ( Figure 8D ). In what we term Type I cells, HPV infection and more specifically the E6 protein, perhaps in conjunction with a hydroxylase and other cellular proteins, results in prolonged hypoxia-induced NF-κB activation. Type II cells are HPV-negative and manifest transient hypoxia-induced NF-κB activation mediated by hydroxylases (e.g. PHD-1) and possibly other cellular factors. In Type III cells, which are also HPV-negative, augmentation of NF-κB activity is either entirely prevented or hypoxia induces a decrease in NF-κB activity. Because the tumor microenvironment is typified by chronic hypoxia, the prolonged nature of the NF-κB activation observed in the setting of HPV infection may represent a more suitable adaptive response to hypoxia in vivo .

The clinical evidence that hypoxia is associated with poor outcomes (e.g. increased local tumour recurrence, the development of systemic metastases, resistance to radiation and chemotherapy and reduced overall survival) is actually most well-established in two HPV-associated cancers: cervical and head and neck cancers, although ample clinical data also exist for sarcomas ( Subarsky and Hill, 2003 ). Importantly, frequent NF-κB activation has been observed in cervix and head and neck patient specimens ( Mishra et al., 2006 ; Nair et al., 2003 ). A recent study highlights the HPV--NF-κB connection: the degree of NF-κB activation was reported to correlate with HPV status in head and neck cancer ( Mishra et al., 2006 ). A biological role for hypoxia-induced NF-κB activation is supported by our studies demonstrating that HPV-positive cervical cancer cells are dependent upon heightened NF-κB activity for optimal anchorage-independent growth under hypoxic conditions. Since NF-κB transcriptional activity results in expression of proteins that promote angiogenesis, proliferation, drug resistance, invasion and metastasis, the aggressive tumor biology characteristic of hypoxic tumors could in large part be recapitulated by hypoxia-induced NF-κB activation. However, NF-κB transcriptional activity cannot account for the entire hypoxic gene expression profile, and other transcription factors, such as HIFα, are known to play a central role in cellular responses to hypoxia ( Denko et al., 2003 ). Nevertheless, prolonged hypoxia-induced NF-κB activation is apt to promote tumor progression in HPV-infected malignancies and has important implications for the carcinogenesis and potential therapeutic targeting of the relatively common malignancies associated with HPV infection.
