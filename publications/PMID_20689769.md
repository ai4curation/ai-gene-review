Enhanced expression and activity of cSrc are associated with ovarian cancer 
progression. Generally, cSrc does not contain activating mutations; rather, its 
activity is increased in response to signals that affect a conformational change 
that releases its autoinhibition. In this report, we analyzed ovarian cancer 
tissues for the expression of a cSrc-activating protein, AFAP-110. AFAP-110 
activates cSrc through a direct interaction that releases it from its 
autoinhibited conformation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a concomitant 
increase of AFAP-110 and cSrc in ovarian cancer tissues. An analysis of the 
AFAP-110 coding sequence revealed the presence of a nonsynonymous, 
single-nucleotide polymorphism that resulted in a change of Ser403 to Cys403. In 
cells that express enhanced levels of cSrc, AFAP-110(403C) directed the 
activation of cSrc and the formation of podosomes independently of input 
signals, in contrast to wild-type AFAP-110. We therefore propose that, under 
conditions of cSrc overexpression, the polymorphic variant of AFAP-110 promotes 
cSrc activation. Further, these data indicate amechanismby which an inherited 
genetic variation could influence ovarian cancer progression and could be used 
to predict the response to targeted therapy.
