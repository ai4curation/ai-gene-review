TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors serve important functional roles during 
embryonic development and in striated muscle gene expression. Our previous work 
has implicated a role for TEAD-1 in the fast-to-slow fiber-type transition in 
response to mechanical overload. To investigate whether TEAD-1 is a modulator of 
slow muscle gene expression in vivo, we developed transgenic mice expressing 
hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged TEAD-1 under the control of the muscle creatine kinase 
promoter. We show that striated muscle-restricted HA-TEAD-1 expression induced a 
transition toward a slow muscle contractile protein phenotype, slower shortening 
velocity (Vmax), and longer contraction and relaxation times in adult fast 
twitch extensor digitalis longus muscle. Notably, HA-TEAD-1 overexpression 
resulted in an unexpected activation of GSK-3alpha/beta and decreased nuclear 
beta-catenin and NFATc1/c3 protein. These effects could be reversed in vivo by 
mechanical overload, which decreased muscle creatine kinase-driven TEAD-1 
transgene expression, and in cultured satellite cells by TEAD-1-specific small 
interfering RNA. These novel in vivo data support a role for TEAD-1 in 
modulating slow muscle gene expression.

Abstract

TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors serve important functional roles
 during embryonic development and in striated muscle gene expression. Our
 previous work has implicated a role for TEAD-1 in the fast-to-slow fiber-type
 transition in response to mechanical overload. To investigate whether TEAD-1
 is a modulator of slow muscle gene expression in vivo , we developed
 transgenic mice expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged TEAD-1 under the control
 of the muscle creatine kinase promoter. We show that striated
 muscle-restricted HA-TEAD-1 expression induced a transition toward a slow
 muscle contractile protein phenotype, slower shortening velocity
 ( V max ), and longer contraction and relaxation times in
 adult fast twitch extensor digitalis longus muscle. Notably, HA-TEAD-1
 overexpression resulted in an unexpected activation of GSK-3α/β and
 decreased nuclear β-catenin and NFATc1/c3 protein. These effects could be
 reversed in vivo by mechanical overload, which decreased muscle
 creatine kinase-driven TEAD-1 transgene expression, and in cultured satellite
 cells by TEAD-1-specific small interfering RNA. These novel in vivo data support a role for TEAD-1 in modulating slow muscle gene expression.

RESULTS

Persistent Expression of Transgenic HA-TEAD-1 Is Restricted to Striated
 Muscle and Does Not Induce Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy —Our previous
 work has implicated a role for TEAD-1 in the fast-to-slow fiber type
 transition in the fast twitch plantaris muscle as a result of mechanical
 overload ( 14 , 15 ). To determine the
 phenotypic consequences of a persistent increase in striated muscle TEAD-1
 protein expression in vivo , we have generated multiple transgenic
 mouse lines that express hemagglutinin-tagged TEAD-1 (HA-TEAD-1) cDNA under
 the control of the mouse muscle-specific creatine kinase regulator sequences
 ( Fig. 1 A ). A
 comparison of body weight, normalized skeletal muscle weight (muscle
 weight/tibia length or muscle weight/body weight), or cross-sectional area
 (data not shown) did not reveal a difference between age and gender-matched WT
 and TEAD-1 Tg mice. These data demonstrate that an increase in total TEAD-1
 protein (endogenous and exogenous (transgenic)) was not sufficient to directly
 and/or indirectly induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy or to alter the growth
 rate of the TEAD-1 Tg mice. To determine the tissue-specific and developmental
 expression pattern of the MCK-HA-TEAD-1 transgene, we performed Western blot
 analysis using anti-HA antibody and total protein extracts isolated from
 skeletal muscles composed of varying proportions of fast and slow fiber types,
 nonmuscle tissues, and the heart of adult (5-month-old) WT and TEAD-1 Tg mice.
 Endogenous MCK gene expression is restricted to striated muscle (skeletal
 muscle and heart) and is first detected in skeletal muscle at approximately
 embryonic day 17. In addition, the magnitude of MCK gene expression in adult
 skeletal muscle follows a fiber type-specific pattern wherein the highest
 level of expression is detected in fast type IIb fibers, with successively
 lower levels occurring in the order IIx/d > IIa > I (β)
 ( 34 , 35 ). Likewise, extensive study
 of the mouse MCK promoter has revealed that transgenic mice harboring a
 3300-nucleotide region of MCK 5′-flanking sequence displayed an
 expression pattern that mimicked that of the endogenous MCK gene
 ( 23 – 25 ).
 By Western blot analysis, HA-TEAD-1 protein was detected only in the total
 protein extracts isolated from adult hearts, as well as adult, embryonic day
 17 (fetal), and day 14 postnatal skeletal muscle of all three TEAD-1 Tg lines
 ( 4 , 12 , 14 ) examined
 ( Fig. 1, B–H )
 (data not shown). The additional HA band that appears in lanes 2 and 3 for transgenic line 4 probably represents a truncated HA-TEAD-1
 product due to degradation or a smaller product, initiation of translation at
 an alternative site, or truncation of the transgene during chromosomal
 integration at a second site. Moreover, HA-TEAD-1 protein was not detected in
 the cellular extracts obtained from the brain, liver, spleen, or kidney of
 TEAD-1 Tg mice ( Fig.
 1 G ). Consistent with the broad expression pattern of
 endogenous TEAD-1 protein, anti-TEAD-1-specific antibody detected endogenous
 TEAD-1 protein in the heart, skeletal muscle, brain, liver, spleen, and kidney
 of adult WT and TEAD-1 Tg mice ( Fig. 1, B–H ). Multiple bands were detected when using
 anti-TEAD-1 antibody, because this antibody recognizes a common epitope (amino
 acids 86–199) present in both HA-TEAD-1 and endogenous TEAD-1 protein
 ( Fig. 1, B–H ).
 Consistent with the pattern of MCK gene expression, HA-TEAD-1 protein was
 detected at the highest levels in the EDL and plantaris muscles, which contain
 a predominance of fast type II fibers (>90%), whereas comparatively lower
 levels were detected in the soleus muscle (∼60–70% type I fibers)
 and in the adult heart ( Table
 1 ). Importantly, although HA-TEAD-1 protein was detected in the
 heart of adult HA-TEAD-1 Tg (line 12) mice, a significant deficit in cardiac
 function was not detected, as assessed by echocardiography and MRI
 analysis. 3 Since all
 lines displayed a similar striated muscle-restricted HA-TEAD-1 expression
 pattern, we have chosen to present only our analysis of HA-TEAD-1 Tg line 12.
 Since adult striated muscle has been shown to express multiple TEAD protein
 isoforms, we employed RT-PCR and qRT-PCR to assess whether the mRNA levels
 encoding other TEAD isoproteins in TEAD-1 Tg line 12 mice would be altered due
 to a persistent increase in TEAD-1 protein. With the exception of TEAD-1 mRNA
 levels, mRNAs encoding TEAD-2, TEAD-3, and TEAD-4 did not differ from the
 levels detected in WT mouse EDL muscle
 ( Fig. 2 A and Table 2 ). Collectively, these
 data demonstrate that the MCK-driven HA-TEAD-1 transgene mimicked the striated
 muscle-restricted expression pattern of the endogenous MCK gene. Additionally,
 the persistent increase in total TEAD-1 protein did not result in cardiac
 dysfunction; nor did it directly or indirectly alter the basal gene expression
 level of other members of the TEAD gene family.

Mice Overexpressing TEAD-1 Display a Transition toward a Slower Muscle
 Contractile Phenotype —Previous work by us
 ( 15 , 36 ) and others
 ( 16 , 37 – 40 )
 has provided in vitro evidence that the TEAD proteins participate in
 the regulation of several contractile proteins. To determine whether a
 persistent increase in TEAD-1 expression regulated MyHC gene expression in
 vivo , we performed a comparative high resolution gel electrophoresis
 analysis of myofibrillar protein isolated from either WT or TEAD-1 Tg line 12
 mice. A striking observation was that the intensity of silver-stained bands
 representing the fast type IIx/d MyHC was basically absent in both fast and
 slow twitch muscles of the TEAD-1 Tg mice as compared with those of WT mice.
 Moreover, the plantaris, EDL, and gastrocnemius muscles of the TEAD-1 Tg mice
 displayed a small but reproducible decrease in the band intensity of fast type
 IIb MyHC and a small and reproducible increase in the band intensity of the
 fast type IIa MyHC. Interestingly, only the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles
 of the TEAD-1 Tg line 12 mice showed an increase in the band intensity of the
 slow type I (β) MyHC despite a significant increase in type I MyHC
 transcripts in the EDL muscle ( Fig. 3, A–D , and Table
 3 ). These data demonstrate that TEAD-1 overexpression resulted in
 an MyHC profile reflective of a slower phenotype in both fast and slow twitch
 skeletal muscles. Likewise, lines 4 and 14 displayed MyHC expression patterns
 that resembled that of line 12, indicating that the MyHC expression pattern
 observed due to TEAD-1 overexpression was not influenced by the transgene
 integration site. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of muscle extracts
 obtained from line 12 mice at 5 and 11 months of age did not reveal any
 differences in MyHC expression patterns
 ( Fig. 3 E ).

It is well established that the contractile velocity of a given muscle or
 muscle fiber is strongly correlated to the MyHC composition of its sarcomeres
 ( 3 , 41 ). To directly ascertain
 whether the putative TEAD-1-induced shifts in MyHC isoform profile resulted in
 alterations in the overall power-generating capabilities of the fast twitch
 extensor digitorum longus muscle of adult TEAD-1 Tg line 12 mice, we performed
 a comparative characterization of the force-velocity and power-load
 relationship between WT ( n = 6) and TEAD-1 Tg ( n = 6) EDL
 muscle. Shortening velocities were slower in the TEAD-1 Tg mice as compared
 with the WT mice at all relative loads less than isometric
 ( P o ; Fig.
 3 E ). This effect resulted in a marked depression in the
 relative power output in the EDL muscle of TEAD-1 Tg mice (0.32 ± 0.02 versus 0.51 ± 0.03 P / P o ·ml/s; Fig. 3 F ). Concomitant
 with the reduction in relative power output, overexpression of TEAD-1 elicited
 a ∼40% reduction in both peak absolute power (1.2 ± 0.2 versus 2.3 ± 0.4 watts; p < 0.05) and normalized
 power output (55.9 ± 6.4 versus 93.6 ± 10.7 watts
 kg –1 ; p < 0.05).

To further investigate the effect of TEAD-1 overexpression on the
 contractile properties of the fast twitch EDL muscle, we assessed twitch
 kinetics. The contractile properties of the TEAD-1 Tg line 12 and WT EDL
 muscle are summarized in Table
 4 . The EDL muscle of TEAD-1 Tg mice ( n = 6) displayed
 significantly prolonged twitch duration (92.0 ± 3.0 versus 79.0 ± 4.0 ms) and half-relaxation time (18.0 ± 1.0 versus 14.0 ± 1.0 ms) when compared with WT EDL ( n =
 6) muscle. No significant difference in either twitch tension or tetanic
 tension between WT and TEAD-1 Tg mice were observed. The slowing of twitch
 kinetics is consistent with changes in the MyHC isoform profile as well as
 altered kinetics of Ca 2+ handling by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and
 Ca 2+ binding to the thin filament or a combination of all three
 ( 42 ).

To determine whether TEAD-1 overexpression resulted in the transcription of
 genes encoding proteins involved in Ca 2+ handling by the
 sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca 2+ binding to the sarcomeric thin
 filament, we used qRT-PCR to obtain an assessment of transcripts encoding the
 slow sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase (SERCA2a), the fast
 sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase (SERCA1), and the slow isoforms
 of troponin T, troponin I, and troponin C. When compared with the WT EDL,
 transcripts encoding the slow sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase
 and the slow isoforms of troponin T, troponin I, and troponin C were increased
 in the TEAD-1 Tg line 12 EDL muscle 4.7-, 3.6-, 7.1-, and 6.1-fold,
 respectively, whereas transcripts encoding fast SERCA1 decreased 1.7-fold
 ( Table 5 ). Consistent with an
 increase in mRNA transcripts encoding sTnI and SERCA2a, Western blot analysis
 using protein extract obtained from the EDL muscle of TEAD-1 Tg mice and
 anti-sTnI- or anti-SERCA2a-specific antibodies detected higher levels of sTnI
 and SERCA2a protein. Likewise, Western blot analysis using anti-SERCA1
 antibody confirmed decreased fast SERCA1 expression
 ( Fig. 4 ). In addition, Western
 blot analysis detected an increase in myoglobin protein, an oxygen binding
 protein that is highly expressed only in oxidative skeletal muscle fibers
 (Type I > IIa > IIx/d), providing further evidence for a fast-to-slow
 fiber-type transition in the EDL muscle of TEAD-1 Tg mice
 ( Fig. 4 ). Together, these
 results provide strong in vivo evidence suggestive of a regulatory
 role for TEAD-1 in the transcription of genes encoding proteins highly
 represented in slow oxidative myofibers.

TEAD-1 Overexpression Decreases Nuclear NFAT Levels —Previous
 work has shown that activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase
 calcineurin results in the nuclear translocation of members of the NFAT
 transcription factor family and their subsequent interaction with other
 transcriptional activators to mediate slow muscle gene expression
 ( 6 , 43 ). To determine if TEAD-1
 overexpression altered the levels of nuclear NFAT protein, we performed a
 Western blot analysis using both anti-NFATc1- and anti-NFATc3-specific
 antibodies and nuclear extracts obtained from the EDL and plantaris muscle of
 WT and TEAD-1 line 12 Tg mice. There was a significant decrease in NFATc1 and
 NFATc3 protein in the nuclear extracts isolated from the EDL and plantaris
 muscles of TEAD-1 Tg mice when compared with those isolated from WT mice. In
 contrast, we did not detect a difference in NFATc1 and NFATc3 protein by
 Western blot when using total cellular extracts
 ( Fig. 5, A–F ).

TEAD-1 Overexpression Increases Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3
 Activity —In contrast to the phosphatase calcineurin,
 phosphorylation of NFAT by GSK-3β has been shown to exclude NFAT from the
 nucleus and by this means decreases activation of NFAT target genes
 ( 44 , 45 ). To determine whether
 TEAD-1 overexpression leads to altered GSK-3 activity we performed a Western
 blot analysis using anti-GSK3α- or anti-GSK-3β-specific antibody to
 assess GSK-3 content and activity. No significant difference in total
 GSK-3α or GSK-3β was detected in total protein extract obtained
 from TEAD-1 Tg line 12 EDL or plantaris muscle when compared with those
 obtained from WT mice ( Fig. 6, A and B ). The activity of GSK-3 is tightly regulated,
 whereby phosphorylation of Ser-21 of GSK-3α and Ser-9 of GSK-3β
 decreases kinase activity, whereas dephosphorylation of these serine residues
 activates kinase activity ( 46 , 47 ). Western blot analysis
 using either phospho-GSK-3α (Ser-21)-specific or phospho-GSK-3β
 (Ser-9)-specific antibodies revealed a significant decrease in GSK-3α
 and GSK-3β phosphorylation (activation) in the protein extracts obtained
 from the EDL and plantaris muscles of TEAD-1 Tg mice when compared with those
 obtained from WT mice ( Fig. 6, A and B ).

Signaling by Akt family members (Akt1, -2, and -3) has been shown to
 inhibit GSK-3α/β activity via phosphorylation of Ser (Ser-21 and
 Ser-9) residues ( 46 , 48 ). To evaluate whether
 TEAD-1 overexpression altered Akt signaling activity, we performed a Western
 blot analysis using an anti-Akt antibody that recognizes all three Akt
 isoforms (Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3) as well as antibodies that specifically
 recognize either Akt1 or Akt2 protein. No difference in total Akt (Akt1 to
 -3), Akt1, or Akt2 protein was detected between the cellular extracts isolated
 from the EDL and plantaris muscles of WT and TEAD-1 Tg line 12 mice
 ( Fig. 7, A and B ). Similarly, phospho-Ser 473 Akt antibody did
 not detect significant differences in Akt phosphorylation between WT and
 TEAD-1 Tg EDL and plantaris muscle extracts
 ( Fig. 7, A and B ). These data show that activation of GSK-3α and
 GSK-3β in the EDL and plantaris muscles of TEAD-1 transgenic mice was not
 due to decreases in total Akt or Akt activity (phospho-Akt).

Increased GSK-3 Activity Alters Nuclear Levels of Its Downstream
 Target β -Catenin —It is well established that
 activated GSK-3β is a negative regulator of the transcriptional
 regulatory protein, β-catenin. GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of
 β-catenin leads to its proteosome-mediated degradation, resulting in
 altered transcriptional regulation of β-catenin target genes
 ( 46 , 49 ). Immunoblot analysis using
 anti-β-catenin-specific antibody detected reduced levels of
 β-catenin in the nuclear extracts obtained from the EDL and plantaris
 muscles of TEAD-1 Tg line 12 mice. Although we detected a decrease in nuclear
 β-catenin, no differences where obtained between WT and HA-TEAD-1 line 12
 mice when using total cellular extracts, which is probably due to the large
 amount of total cellular β-catenin
 ( Fig. 8, A–D ).

The Effects of Activated GSK-3 Are Reversed by MOV and TEAD-1
 siRNA —Previously, we have demonstrated that 48 h of MOV was
 sufficient to nearly silence the expression of a 3300-bp mouse MCK
 promoter-reporter transgene (–3300 to +7-CAT) in the plantaris muscle of
 transgenic mice ( 26 ). Since
 expression of the HA-TEAD-1 transgene is controlled in part by a 3300-bp MCK
 promoter (see Fig.
 1 A ), we tested the hypothesis that 48 h of MOV would
 return the levels of phospho-GSK-3α/β back to WT levels, thereby
 restoring nuclear NFAT and β-catenin levels. Immunoblot analysis using
 protein extracts isolated from 48-h MOV-plantaris muscle of TEAD-1 Tg line 12
 mice and an anti-TEAD-1-specific antibody showed a remarkable decrease in
 HA-TEAD-1 protein when compared with plantaris muscle protein extract obtained
 from TEAD-1 Tg mice that had not been subjected to MOV
 ( Fig. 9 A ). Most
 strikingly, 48 h of MOV resulted in a rescue of GSK-3α and GSK-3β
 phosphorylation level that was not different from that detected in total
 protein extract isolated from the plantaris muscle of WT and WT MOV mice
 ( Fig. 9 A , lane 1
 versus lanes 4–7 ). The latter indicates that 48 h of MOV did not
 alter the phosphorylation status of GSK-3α/β. Furthermore, Western
 blot analysis using nuclear extract isolated from 48-h TEAD-1 Tg MOV-plantaris
 muscle showed that the nuclear levels of NFATc1, NFATc3, and β-catenin
 were similar to those detected in nuclear extracts isolated from the plantaris
 muscle of WT mice ( Fig.
 9 B , lane 1 versus lanes 4–6 ). Since Akt is
 a primary upstream regulator of GSK-3 activity, we performed a Western blot
 analysis to determine if 48 h of MOV activated Akt signaling. The levels of
 total and phosphorylated Akt in TEAD-1 Tg MOV-plantaris total protein extract
 did not differ significantly from those detected in plantaris extract isolated
 from TEAD-1 Tg mice not subjected to MOV
 ( Fig. 9 C , lanes
 1–3 versus lanes 4–6 ). Similar results were obtained when
 assessing total and phosphorylated Akt in total protein extract obtained from
 WT versus WT-MOV plantaris muscle
 ( Fig. 9 D , lanes
 1–3 versus lanes 4–6 ).

Mouse skeletal muscle satellite cells reportedly appear shortly before the
 end of gestation ( 2 , 50 , 51 ). Since we have detected
 HA-TEAD-1 protein in the hind limb skeletal muscle of embryonic day 17 (fetal)
 TEAD-1 Tg line 12 mice ( Fig.
 1 H ), it was important to examine if the HA-TEAD-1
 transgene was expressed in adult skeletal muscle myoblasts (satellite cells)
 of these mice and, if so, whether TEAD-1 overexpression in these cells
 resulted in an altered phosphorylation status of GSK-3α/β. Western
 blot analysis using TEAD-1-specific antibody and total protein extract
 obtained from differentiated satellite cells isolated from either WT or TEAD-1
 Tg mice (3 months old) revealed the presence of endogenous TEAD-1
 ( Fig. 9 E , lanes
 1–4 ), whereas the HA-tagged TEAD-1 protein only appeared in the
 protein extracts of differentiated satellite cells isolated from TEAD-1 Tg
 line 12 mice ( Fig. 9 E , lanes 1 and 2 versus lane 4 ). Transfection of TEAD-1 Tg
 satellite cells with TEAD-1-specific siRNA markedly decreased the levels of
 total cellular TEAD-1 (endogenous and HA-TEAD-1) protein as compared with
 transfection with nontargeting siRNA ( Fig.
 9 E , lane 2 versus lane 3 ) or in comparison with
 WT TEAD-1 levels ( Fig.
 9 E , lane 3 versus lane 4 ). Importantly, Western
 blot analysis revealed that the phosphorylation status of GSK-3α/β
 was strikingly decreased in protein extracts isolated from TEAD-1 Tg satellite
 cells when compared with protein extracts isolated from WT satellite cells
 ( Fig. 9 E , lanes
 1 and 2 versus lane 4 ). GSK-3α/β phosphorylation
 levels returned to WT levels in TEAD-1 Tg satellite cells treated with TEAD-1
 siRNA ( Fig. 9 E , lane 3 versus 4), whereas those treated with nontargeting siRNA maintained
 reduced levels of phospho-GSK-3α/β
 ( Fig. 9 E , lane 2
 versus lane 3 ). When considered collectively, these data provide
 convincing evidence that TEAD-1 participates in slow muscle contractile
 protein gene expression in vivo and reveal a regulatory role for
 TEAD-1 in GSK-3α/β signaling.

DISCUSSION

This study provides the first in vivo evidence indicating that
 TEAD-1 participates in slow skeletal muscle gene expression, and it reveals
 that TEAD-1 unexpectedly activated GSK-3α/β, resulting in decreased
 nuclear β-catenin and NFATc1/c3 protein. We have verified the link
 between increased TEAD-1 expression and activation of GSK-3α/β by
 using TEAD-1 siRNA in culture satellite cells and in vivo by using
 MOV, both of which decreased TEAD-1 transgene expression, thereby restoring WT
 levels of phospho-GSK-3α/β and nuclear β-catenin and
 NFATc1/c3. TEAD-1 activation of GSK-3α/β signaling in satellite
 cells may have future applications to novel therapeutic strategies in
 regenerative medicine.

Although numerous in vitro studies have provided evidence that
 TEAD proteins regulate basal and adaptive skeletal muscle contractile protein
 gene expression, their in vivo role in this capacity has not been
 examined in adult skeletal muscle. We show herein that a persistent increase
 in TEAD-1 expression in adult skeletal muscle induced a transition toward a
 slow muscle contractile protein phenotype. This was evidenced by a shift
 toward a slower MyHC profile that was distinguished by the virtual loss of
 fast type IIx/d MyHC protein in both fast and slow twitch muscles, a variable
 decrease in type IIb MyHC protein, and an increase in type IIa and/or type I
 MyHC protein for each of three independent Tg lines
 ( Fig. 3 E ). Most
 importantly, the physiological significance of the shift toward a slower MyHC
 expression pattern was underscored by a corresponding decrease in the
 shortening velocity of the fast twitch EDL muscle, which is consistent with a
 large body of evidence demonstrating that each MyHC isoprotein confers a
 different ATPase activity and contractile velocity
 ( 3 , 41 , 52 ). In addition to the
 transition toward a slower MyHC expression pattern in the fast twitch EDL
 muscle, we have shown a striking increase in the abundance of mRNAs encoding
 the slow isoforms of the thin filament troponin complex proteins (TnC, TnT,
 and TnI (troponin C, troponin T, and troponin I, respectively)) and the slow
 sarcoplasmic calcium ATPase (SERCA2a) that was paralleled by increases in
 myoglobin, slow TnI, and SERCA2a protein with a decrease in fast SERCA1 mRNA
 and protein. This fast-to-slow transition in EDL gene expression was
 paralleled by significantly longer contraction and relaxation times, which
 corresponds well with previous studies demonstrating that the troponin complex
 proteins and sarcoplasmic calcium-ATPase regulate the kinetics of
 calcium-activated muscle contraction
 ( 29 ). It is notable that the
 skeletal muscle phenotype displayed by the TEAD-1 Tg mice shows a remarkable
 correlation to our previous work wherein we showed that MOV not only induced
 TEAD-1 protein expression but also increased the expression of myoglobin, slow
 TnI, and βMyHC protein concurrent with a significant increase in type I
 fibers ( 15 , 53 , 54 ). In addition, trends in
 MyHC gene expression similar to those reported herein have been reported to
 occur in both human and rodent fast twitch muscle in response to resistance
 and endurance exercise ( 55 ).
 It is also noteworthy that the transcriptional activation of myoglobin and
 slow TnI in fast twitch muscle of transgenic mice expressing constitutively
 active forms of calcineurin, CaMK, or PDK1 has been used as a standard to
 confirm the induction of a slow gene program
 ( 5 , 56 , 57 ). Collectively, these data
 provide in vivo evidence that TEAD-1 serves a role in slow and
 oxidative skeletal muscle contractile protein gene expression and point toward
 a role for this transcription factor in human and rodent skeletal muscle
 adaptations in response to various modes of exercise.

An interesting and rather unexpected finding from our study was that
 although the fast-twitch EDL muscle of TEAD-1 Tg mice displayed increased
 levels of βMyHC mRNA (∼14-fold; this is a muscle that normally does
 not express βMyHC to any appreciable degree), increased βMyHC
 protein expression was only detected in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles,
 indicating that βMyHC protein production was being regulated by a
 muscle-specific post-transcriptional mechanism. There are two reasonable
 explanations that can account for this finding. Micro-RNAs (small noncoding
 RNAs) have been shown to regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by
 binding target mRNAs and in this manner prevent and/or decrease protein
 synthesis of the encoded protein
 ( 58 ). In this regard, several
 striated muscle-specific micro-RNAs have been shown to serve crucial
 regulatory roles during skeletal muscle development and in cardiac gene
 expression and stress responsiveness
 ( 59 , 60 ). For example, the hearts
 from miR-208 nullizygous mice displayed up-regulation of numerous fast twitch
 skeletal muscle genes and were unable to induce βMyHC gene expression in
 response to pressure overload, indicating a specific role for miR-208 in
 maintaining the cardiac phenotype and in βMyHC gene expression as a
 result of stress. Although speculative, it is conceivable that the fast twitch
 EDL muscle expresses a set of micro-RNAs that target mRNAs encoding various
 slow muscle proteins ( e.g. βMyHC), thereby maintaining its fast
 fiber phenotype. Equally plausible, the βMyHC protein may have been
 degraded as an inappropriately expressed protein. The ubiquitin-proteasome
 system participates in the regulation of numerous cellular processes by
 proteolytic degradation of regulatory proteins of signaling and gene
 expression pathways and serves as the primary site of skeletal muscle
 contractile protein maintenance and turnover under basal conditions and in
 response to physiological and pathological stimuli
 ( 61 ). In this regard, mice
 deficient for two E3 ligases, muscle RING finger 1 and 3 (MuRF1 and MuRF3),
 develop skeletal muscle pathologies characterized by subsarcolemma
 accumulation of MyHC (βMyHC and fast type IIa MyHC), indicating a role
 for MuRF1 and MuRF3 in the maintenance of basal contractile protein turnover
 ( 62 ). Thus, degradation of the
 βMyHC protein may have served as a compensatory response to retain the
 fast fiber phenotype of the EDL muscle. Clearly, skeletal muscle fiber type
 conversion, be it fast-to-slow or slow-to-fast, requires coordinate regulation
 at multiple levels, given that it involves a multitude of changes in
 muscle-specific gene expression, and regulation can be imposed at any point
 along the gene expression pathway. Consistent with this concept, recent
 inquiries into the molecular mechanisms involved in establishing, maintaining,
 and modulating skeletal muscle fiber types have led to a proposed model
 wherein the cooperative interactions between three signaling pathways
 (calcineurin, CaMKs, and PKD1) modulate the transcriptional activation of slow
 muscle fiber genes through class II HDAC degradation and the activation of
 members of the MEF2 and NFAT transcription factor families
 ( 5 – 7 , 43 ).

Another intriguing and unexpected finding was that the TEAD-1-induced
 transition toward a slower muscle contractile phenotype was accomplished in a
 seemingly NFAT-independent manner. Our Western blot analyses showed a
 reduction in the phosphorylation status of both isoforms of glycogen synthase
 kinase-3 (GSK-3α and GSK-3β; dephosphorylation activates GSK kinase
 activity) concurrent with decreased nuclear levels of NFATc1 and NFATc3. The
 observed decrease in the phosphorylation status of GSK-3α/β could
 not be attributed to an alteration in signaling from Akt, a primary upstream
 regulator of GSK phosphorylation, since we did not detect changes in total or
 phosphorylated levels of Akt. Importantly, previous work has shown that
 GSK-3β works in opposition to the protein phosphatase calcineurin. Once
 activated by a sustained increase in intracellular calcium, calcineurin
 dephosphorylates cytoplasmic NFAT, resulting in its nuclear translocation and
 subsequent activation of NFAT-dependent gene expression, whereas GSK-3β
 phosphorylates NFAT, affecting its nuclear abundance and, by this means,
 decreases NFAT target gene expression
 ( 63 ). Consistent with our
 result showing that GSK-3α/β can regulate nuclear NFAT levels, it
 has been shown that overexpression of a constitutively active form of
 GSK-3β increased NFAT export from the nucleus of cardiomyocytes
 ( 64 ). Furthermore, the
 inhibition of GSK-3β has been shown to slow the export of NFATc1 from the
 nucleus of single fibers isolated from the mouse flexor digitorum brevis
 muscle following the cessation of electrically stimulated import of NFATc1
 ( 65 ). It is also worth noting
 that although several studies have provided evidence that calcineurin
 signaling is important for fiber type switching, activation of the slow gene
 program can occur by an NFAT-independent mechanism
 ( 13 , 56 , 57 , 66 – 69 ).

As with NFAT, we also demonstrate a notable decrease in the nuclear levels
 of β-catenin, which is another downstream target of activated
 GSK-3β. This result is consistent with previous work, wherein a decrease
 in β-catenin was detected in embryonic stem cells isolated from double
 homozygous GSKα/β (21A/21A/9A/9A) knock-in mice
 expressing constitutively active forms of GSK-3α/β due to a
 serine-to-alanine substitution that prevents phosphorylation and thus
 inactivation of GSK-3α and GSK-3β
 ( 70 ). GSK-3β
 phosphorylation of β-catenin targets it for degradation by the ubiquitin
 proteosome, thereby controlling its nuclear level and transcriptional activity
 of β-catenin/TCF/Lef-responsive promoters
 ( 46 , 47 ). Although β-catenin
 has been shown to be necessary for skeletal muscle development
 ( 71 ), we did not detect a
 difference in skeletal muscle growth rate or normalized weight between wild
 type and TEAD-1 Tg mice despite the early expression pattern of the TEAD-1
 transgene (embryonic day 17), indicating that β-catenin is required at an
 earlier time during myogenesis or that the overall magnitude of decrease in
 nuclear β-catenin in our experiment was not sufficient to alter muscle
 growth. Although our data did not provide evidence as to whether decreased
 nuclear β-catenin contributed to the observed transition to a slower
 contractile protein phenotype, a role in this capacity is conceivable based on
 the numerous TCF/Lef elements contained within the promoter regions of the
 MyHC, troponin complex, and SERCA2a genes.

Our current study also provides substantial evidence that the persistent
 increase in TEAD-1 expression is responsible for the reduced level of
 phospho-GSK-3α/3β and nuclear NFATc1/3 and β-catenin. This was
 evidence by employing 48 h of MOV, which resulted in a significant decrease in
 MCK-driven HA-tagged TEAD-1 transgene expression and a return of
 phospho-GSK-3α/3β, nuclear NFATc1/c3, and β-catenin to WT
 levels in the absence of a significant change in total or phospho-Akt. Of
 direct relevance to the latter study is our previous work showing that 48 h of
 MOV is sufficient to repress endogenous and transgenic MCK reporter gene
 expression ( 26 ). However,
 since MOV is associated with an increase in motor nerve activity, a stimulus
 previously shown to regulate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of NFAT via the
 calcium-dependent calcineurin-NFAT pathway
 ( 65 , 72 , 73 ), it could be argued that
 the observed return of nuclear NFATc1/c3 to wild type levels in our study was
 due to heightened neural activity imposed by MOV. Nevertheless, the connection
 between increased TEAD-1 expression and dephosphorylation of
 GSK-3α/β was further substantiated when we demonstrated that adult
 stage myoblast (satellite cells) isolated from TEAD-1 Tg mice displayed WT
 levels of phospho-GSK-3α/β concurrent with a striking decrease in
 MCK-driven HA-TEAD-1 expression as a result of transfection with
 TEAD-1-specific siRNA. Although beyond the scope of the current study, it will
 be intriguing to determine the role TEAD-1 serves in satellite cell (skeletal
 muscle adult stem cells) regulation, given that satellite cells contribute to
 postnatal skeletal muscle growth and play an essential role in skeletal muscle
 homeostasis and regeneration after injury and during aging
 ( 74 ).

In summary, the present study provides the first in vivo evidence
 that TEAD-1 participates in slow skeletal muscle gene expression and revealed
 a novel link between increased TEAD-1 expression and activation of
 GSK-3α/β, which, in turn, decreased nuclear NFATc1/c3 and
 β-catenin protein. It is expected that this putative pathway (TEAD-1
 → GSK-3α/β → β-catenin/NFATc1/c3) would work in
 conjunction with the well established calcium-dependent signaling pathways to
 activate a complete array of gene programs necessary to accomplish a complete
 fast-to-slow phenotype switch in adult skeletal muscle. However, our data also
 support the notion that TEAD-1 can induce a transition toward a slower
 contractile protein phenotype independent of activation of calcium-dependent
 pathways, conceivably via direct TEAD element binding and combinatorial
 interactions with adjacently bound transcriptional regulators and
 coactivators. Additional work will be required to elucidate 1) the phosphatase
 that dephosphorylates GSK-3α/β, 2) the transcription factors and
 coactivators that interact with the TEAD proteins in vivo to mediate
 skeletal muscle-fiber-specific gene expression under basal conditions and
 during remodeling in response to MOV/exercise, and 3) the full complement of
 TEAD target genes, given the crucial transcriptional role recently reported
 for the TEAD proteins in neural cells and smooth and striated muscle
 ( 17 – 22 , 75 ). Finally, our current
 results suggest a possible regulatory role of TEAD-1 in satellite cells.
 Because satellite cells are basically solely responsible for regeneration of
 adult skeletal muscle, increased TEAD-1 expression potentially may be
 exploited for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in regenerative
 medicine.
