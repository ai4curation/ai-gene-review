Plants respond to low levels of UV-B radiation with a coordinated 
photomorphogenic response that allows acclimation to this environmental stress 
factor. The key players in this UV-B response are COP1 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), 
UVR8 (a β-propeller protein), and HY5 (a bZIP transcription factor). We have 
shown previously that an elevated UV-B-specific response is associated with 
dwarf growth, indicating the importance of balancing UV-B-specific signaling. 
Negative regulators of this pathway are not known, however. Here, we describe 
two highly related WD40-repeat proteins, REPRESSOR OF UV-B PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1 
(RUP1) and RUP2, that interact directly with UVR8 as potent repressors of UV-B 
signaling. Both genes were transcriptionally activated by UV-B in a COP1-, 
UVR8-, and HY5-dependent manner. rup1 rup2 double mutants showed an enhanced 
response to UV-B and elevated UV-B tolerance after acclimation. Overexpression 
of RUP2 resulted in reduced UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis and impaired 
acclimation, leading to hypersensitivity to UV-B stress. These results are 
consistent with an important regulatory role for RUP1 and RUP2, which act 
downstream of UVR8-COP1 in a negative feedback loop impinging on UVR8 function, 
balancing UV-B defense measures and plant growth.

Abstract

Plants respond to low levels of UV-B radiation with a coordinated photomorphogenic response that allows acclimation to this environmental stress factor. The key players in this UV-B response are COP1 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), UVR8 (a β-propeller protein), and HY5 (a bZIP transcription factor). We have shown previously that an elevated UV-B–specific response is associated with dwarf growth, indicating the importance of balancing UV-B–specific signaling. Negative regulators of this pathway are not known, however. Here, we describe two highly related WD40-repeat proteins, REPRESSOR OF UV-B PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1 (RUP1) and RUP2, that interact directly with UVR8 as potent repressors of UV-B signaling. Both genes were transcriptionally activated by UV-B in a COP1-, UVR8-, and HY5-dependent manner. rup1 rup2 double mutants showed an enhanced response to UV-B and elevated UV-B tolerance after acclimation. Overexpression of RUP2 resulted in reduced UV-B–induced photomorphogenesis and impaired acclimation, leading to hypersensitivity to UV-B stress. These results are consistent with an important regulatory role for RUP1 and RUP2, which act downstream of UVR8–COP1 in a negative feedback loop impinging on UVR8 function, balancing UV-B defense measures and plant growth.

RUP2Overexpression Results in Blockage of UV-B–Specific Signaling.

Because the genetic loss-of-function data strongly indicated a redundant function for RUP1 and RUP2 as crucial repressors of UV-B–induced photomorphogenesis, we generated CaMV 35S promoter–driven RUP2 overexpression lines. RUP2 overexpression resulted in a strong block of UV-B–induced expression of the HY5 and CHS marker genes ( Fig. 4 A and B ), strongly supporting RUP2's role as a repressor of UV-B signaling. Protein gel blot analysis confirmed the repressive effect on CHS and HY5 at the protein level and demonstrated that the hyposensitivity is not due to down-regulation of UVR8 protein in the RUP2 overexpression lines ( Fig. 4 C ).

Discussion

The survival of sessile plants in sunlight is ensured by UV-protective responses that are largely regulated by the UV-B–specific UVR8–COP1 pathway. Activation of these responses must be well balanced; a reduced response results in UV-B damage and cellular death (as in the uvr8 mutant), whereas an exaggerated response results in impaired growth and dwarfism (as produced by UVR8 overexpression) ( 6 ). Here we show that the Arabidopsis RUP1 and RUP2 proteins are crucial repressors of UV-B–induced photomorphogenesis that result in an adequate and balanced UVR8/COP1-mediated UV-B response.

Previous work has shown that specific perception of UV-B radiation by a postulated UV-B receptor results in rapid UVR8–COP1 interaction ( 6 ). This allows the COP1/UVR8-mediated activation of numerous genes, including HY5 , which confers UV acclimation and protection ( 6 , 8 , 12 ), and RUP1 and RUP2 , which provide negative feedback regulation through direct interaction with UVR8 ( Fig. 2 D and E ; see also the model shown in Fig. S7 ). The latter two genes encode β-propeller proteins belonging to the very diverse superfamily of WD40-repeat regulatory proteins, which comprises 237 potential proteins in Arabidopsis containing four or more copies of the WD40 motif ( 19 ). The common defining feature of these proteins is an ≈40-aa stretch typically ending in Trp-Asp (WD), but there is only limited amino acid sequence conservation otherwise. In many instances, repeated WD40 motifs act as sites for protein–protein interaction, and many proteins containing WD40 repeats are known to serve as platforms for the assembly of protein complexes ( 19 ). The two RUP proteins show significant sequence conservation in their seven WD40-repeat domains with the COP1 and SPA1–SPA4 proteins, including a conserved 16-aa DWD (DDB1-binding WD40) motif ( 20 , 21 ). Members of the DWD motif–containing subset of WD40 proteins were shown to act as substrate receptors for DDB1-CUL4-ROC1–based E3 ubiquitin ligases ( 22 ). Such a function remains to be described for the RUP proteins, however. Nevertheless, a phylogenetic analysis based on the WD40-repeat region indicated that the most closely related sequences to RUP1 and RUP2 encoded in the Arabidopsis genome are the SPA proteins and COP1, with which they share about 33% and 37% identity in the WD40 domain, respectively. COP1 and SPA protein family members function as repressors under visible light devoid of UV-B ( 10 , 15 ), a light environment prevalent in laboratory experiments, which neglects the influence of the UV-B radiation intrinsic to sunlight. A detailed understanding of the regulatory role of UV-B is needed to understand the control by light of plant growth and development, however. Recent experiments using sun simulator conditions to analyze the performance of the uvr8 mutant and UVR8 overexpression lines demonstrated the importance of the UV-B–specific photoregulatory pathway ( 6 ). The related phenotypes of RUP2 overexpression and rup1 rup2 double mutants described here demonstrate the importance of these UV-B–specific repressors under UV-B radiation, similar to the COP1 and SPA proteins in conditions devoid of UV-B. Indeed, the phenotype of the rup1 rup2 double mutant under supplemental UV-B radiation (e.g., short hypocotyl, dwarfism, high anthocyanin) is very reminiscent of the cop1 and combinatorial spa mutants grown under white light without UV-B.

The SPA–COP1 E3 ligase complexes are a point of convergence downstream of multiple light signals and constitute a central repressor of photomorphogenesis that is inactivated by visible light in an as-yet unknown molecular manner ( 14 ). Interestingly, the coiled-coil domain and the WD40-repeat domain of SPA1 are sufficient for its function, and the kinase-related domain apparently is not required ( 23 , 24 ). Arabidopsis COP1 interacts with the four members of the SPA protein family (SPA1–SPA4) with their coiled-coil domains ( 25 ). In contrast, RUP proteins have no coiled-coil domain. In agreement with this, we found no interaction with COP1. However, similar to the activation of RUP1 and RUP2 by UV-B, the levels of SPA1 , SPA3 , and SPA4 transcripts were increased by red, far-red, and blue light, consistent with a negative feedback role in light-grown seedlings ( 23 ).

In contrast to RUP1 and RUP2 , expression of the other main factors ( COP1 and UVR8 ) responsible for the UV-B response in Arabidopsis is constitutive and not regulated by UV-B. Nevertheless, a change in the abundance of interacting proteins, such as the RUP1 and RUP2 (or SPA) proteins, in response to an exogenous signal could alter the activity and/or specificity of the complex as a whole. Thus, the regulation of RUP1 and RUP2 expression seems crucial to the adjustment of plant growth and development to changes in the light environment. Our data suggest that a rapid increase in RUP1 and RUP2 abundance is necessary to prevent overstimulation when seedlings are exposed to UV-B.

Interestingly, RNAi of a gene encoding a RUP-related protein in tomato, LeCOP1LIKE , results in field-grown plants with exaggerated photomorphogenesis, dark-green leaves, and elevated fruit carotenoid levels ( 26 ). This finding led to the conclusion that LeCOP1LIKE is involved in light signal transduction and functions as a negative regulator of fruit pigmentation. However, it should be noted that the closest homolog of LeCOP1LIKE in Arabidopsis is RUP1, and thus the enhanced photomorphogenesis described for the LeCOP1LIKE-RNAi lines under natural conditions in the field might be linked instead to its potential function as a repressor of UV-B signaling in tomato. Thus, manipulating UV-B signaling might provide another way to modify the nutrient quality of plants ( 27 ).

In summary, we have shown that the UV-B–specific response impinging on plant growth is precisely balanced by the UV-B–activated and UVR8-interacting RUP1 and RUP2 proteins. RUP1 and RUP2 are early responsive genes that function as negative regulators of the UV-B response in Arabidopsis through direct interaction with the UVR8 protein. This negative feedback loop prevents an exaggerated photomorphogenic UV-B response that would strongly affect plant growth and development.
