Chromatin remodelling complexes are multi-subunit assemblies, each containing a 
catalytic ATPase and translocase that is capable of mobilizing nucleosomes to 
alter the chromatin structure. SWI/SNF remodelling complexes with higher DNA 
translocation efficiency evict histones or slide the nucleosomes away from each 
other making DNA accessible for transcription and repair machinery. Chromatin 
remodelling at the promoter of stress-responsive genes by SWI/SNF becomes 
necessary during the heat and proteotoxic stress. While the involvement of 
SWI/SNF in transcription of stress-responsive genes has been studied 
extensively, the regulation of proteostasis by SWI/SNF is not well understood. 
This study demonstrates critical functions of SWI/SNF in response to 
cadmium-induced proteotoxic stress. Deletion of either ATPase-translocase 
subunit of SWI/SNF complex (Swi2/Snf2) or a regulatory subunit Swi3 abrogates 
the clearance of cadmium-induced protein aggregates. Our results suggest that 
Snf2 and Swi3 regulate the protein folding in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that 
reduces the chances of forming unfolded protein aggregates under the proteotoxic 
stress of cadmium. The Ire1-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR) maintains 
ER homeostasis by upregulating the expression of chaperones and ER-associated 
degradation (ERAD) components. We found that Snf2 maintains normal oxidative 
environment essential for Ire1 activity. Deletion of SNF2 reduced the Ire1 
activity and UPR, indicating involvement of Snf2 in Ire1-mediated ER 
proteostasis. Together, these findings suggest that SWI/SNF complex regulates ER 
homeostasis and protein folding crucial for tolerating proteotoxic stress.
