Two members of the heat shock protein 70 kDa (Hsp70) family, Ssc1 and Ssq1, 
perform important functions in the mitochondrial matrix. The essential Ssc1 is 
an abundant ATP-binding protein required for both import and folding of 
mitochondrial proteins. The function of Ssc1 is supported by an interaction with 
the preprotein translocase subunit Tim44, the cochaperone Mdj1, and the 
nucleotide exchange factor Mge1. In contrast, only limited information is 
available on Ssq1. So far, a basic characterization of Ssq1 has demonstrated its 
involvement in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA, the maturation of the yeast 
frataxin (Yfh1) after import, and assembly of the mitochondrial Fe/S cluster. 
Here, we analyzed the biochemical properties and the interaction partners of 
Ssq1 in detail. Ssq1 showed typical chaperone properties by binding to unfolded 
substrate proteins in an ATP-regulated manner. Ssq1 was able to form a specific 
complex with the nucleotide exchange factor Mge1. In particular, complex 
formation in organello was enhanced significantly when Ssc1 was inactivated 
selectively. However, even under these conditions, no interaction of Ssq1 with 
the two other mitochondrial Hsp70-cochaperones, Tim44 and Mdj1, was observed. 
The Ssq1-Mge1 interaction showed a lower overall stability but the same 
characteristic nucleotide-dependence as the Ssc1-Mge1 interaction. A 
quantitative analysis of the interaction properties indicated a competition of 
Ssq1 with Ssc1 for binding to Mge1. Perturbation of Mge1 function or amounts 
resulted in direct effects on Ssq1 activity in intact mitochondria. We conclude 
that mitochondria represent the unique case where two Hsp70s compete for the 
interaction with one nucleotide exchange factor.
