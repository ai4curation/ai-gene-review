Connector enhancer of KSR (CNK) proteins have been proposed to act as scaffolds 
in the Ras-MAPK pathway. In this work, using in vivo bioluminescence resonance 
energy transfer (BRET) assays and in vitro co-immunoprecipitation, we show that 
hCNK1 interacts with the active form of Rho A (G14V) proteins. The domain of 
hCNK1 that allows binding to Rho proteins involves the C-terminal PH domain. 
Overexpression of hCNK1 does not affect the actin cytoskeleton and does not 
modify the appearance of stress fibers in cells overexpressing a constitutively 
active form of RhoA. In contrast, hCNK1 was able to significantly decrease the 
RhoA-induced transcriptional activity of the serum response element (SRE) 
without effect on the Ras-induced SRE activation. These results identify hCNK1 
as a specific partner of Rho proteins both in vitro and in vivo and suggest a 
role of hCNK1 in the signal transduction of Rho proteins.
