Ras proteins mediate the proliferative effects of G-protein-coupled receptors 
(GPCRs), but the role of Rap proteins in GPCR signaling is unclear. We have 
developed a novel cellular proliferation assay for examining signal transduction 
to Rap utilizing Ras-rap chimeras that respond selectively to Rap-specific 
exchange factors, but which stimulate cellular proliferation through Ras 
effectors. Both the D1 dopamine receptor (Gs-coupled) and the 5HT1E serotonin 
receptor (Gi-coupled) mediated cellular proliferation in a Ras/rap 
chimera-dependent manner. Responses to both receptors were PKA-independent. Both 
receptors activated Ras/rap and full-length Rap as measured by 
activation-specific probes. Pertussis toxin blocked Ras/rap-dependent responses 
to 5HT1E but not D1. Ras/rap-dependent responses to both receptors were 
insensitive to beta-gamma scavengers. Responses to 5HT1E, but not D1, were 
sensitive to inhibition by a dominant-negative C3G fragment, by the Src-like 
kinase inhibitors PP1 and PP2, and by a dominant-negative mutant of Src. Very 
similar data were obtained for two other Gi-coupled receptors, the D2 dopamine 
receptor and the alpha2C adrenergic receptor. A constitutively active mutant of 
Galphai2 also mediated Ras/rap-dependent responses. These data indicate that 
GPCRs coupled to pertussis-toxin-sensitive G-proteins activate Rap through a 
Galpha subunit, C3G, and Src-dependent pathway.
