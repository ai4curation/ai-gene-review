A(1) adenosine receptors (A(1)Rs) are G protein-coupled heptaspanning receptors 
that interact at the outer face of the plasma membrane with cell surface 
ecto-adenosine deaminase (ecto-ADA). By affinity chromatography the heat shock 
cognate protein hsc73 was identified as a cytosolic component able to interact 
with the third intracellular loop of the receptor. As demonstrated by surface 
plasmon resonance, purified A(1)Rs interact specifically with hsc73 with a 
dissociation constant in the nanomolar range (0.5 +/- 0.1 nM). The interaction 
between hsc73 and A(1)R led to a marked reduction in the binding of the ligands 
and prevented activation of G proteins, as deduced from (35)S-labeled 
guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate binding assays. Interestingly this effect 
was stronger than that exerted by guanine nucleotide analogs, which uncouple 
receptors from G proteins, and was completely prevented by ADA. As assessed by 
immunoprecipitation a high percentage of A(1)Rs in cell lysates are coupled to 
hsc73. A relatively high level of colocalization between A(1)R and hsc73 was 
detected in DDT(1)MF-2 cells by means of confocal microscopy, and no similar 
results were obtained for other G protein-coupled receptors. Colocalization 
between hsc73 and A(1)R was detected in specific regions of rat cerebellum and 
in the body of cortical neurons but not in dendrites or synapses. Remarkably, 
agonist-induced receptor internalization leads to the endocytosis of A(1)Rs by 
two qualitatively different vesicle types, one in which A(1)R and hsc73 
colocalize and another in which hsc73 is absent. These results open the 
interesting possibility that signaling via G protein-coupled receptors may be 
regulated by heat shock proteins.
