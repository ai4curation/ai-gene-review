Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder of complex 
aetiology. Rare, highly penetrant PD-causing mutations and common risk factors 
of small effect size have been identified in several genes/loci. However, these 
mutations and risk factors only explain a fraction of the disease burden, 
suggesting that additional, substantial genetic determinants remain to be found. 
Genetically isolated populations offer advantages for dissecting the genetic 
architecture of complex disorders, such as PD. We performed exome sequencing in 
100 unrelated PD patients from Sardinia, a genetic isolate. SNPs absent from 
dbSNP129 and 1000 Genomes, shared by at least five patients, and of functional 
effects were genotyped in an independent Sardinian case-control sample 
(n = 500). Variants associated with PD with nominal p value <0.05 and those with 
odds ratio (OR) ≥3 were validated by Sanger sequencing and typed in a 
replication sample of 2965 patients and 2678 controls from Italy, Spain, and 
Portugal. We identified novel moderately rare variants in several genes, 
including SCAPER, HYDIN, UBE2H, EZR, MMRN2 and OGFOD1 that were specifically 
present in PD patients or enriched among them, nominating these as novel 
candidate risk genes for PD, although no variants achieved genome-wide 
significance after Bonferroni correction. Our results suggest that the genetic 
bases of PD are highly heterogeneous, with implications for the design of future 
large-scale exome or whole-genome analyses of this disease.
