The collection of vacuolar protein sorting mutants (vps mutants) in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae comprises of 41 complementation groups. The vacuoles in 
these mutant strains were examined using immunofluorescence microscopy. Most of 
the vps mutants were found to possess vacuolar morphologies that differed 
significantly from wild-type vacuoles. Furthermore, mutants representing 
independent vps complementation groups were found to share aberrant 
morphological features. Six distinct classes of vacuolar morphology were 
observed. Mutants from eight vps complementation groups were defective both for 
vacuolar segregation from mother cells into developing buds and for 
acidification of the vacuole. Another group of mutants, represented by 13 
complementation groups, accumulated a novel organelle distinct from the vacuole 
that contained a late-Golgi protein, active vacuolar H(+)-ATPase complex, and 
soluble vacuolar hydrolases. We suggest that this organelle may represent an 
exaggerated endosome-like compartment. None of the vps mutants appeared to 
mislocalize significant amounts of the vacuolar membrane protein alkaline 
phosphatase. Quantitative immunoprecipitations of the soluble vacuolar hydrolase 
carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) were performed to determine the extent of the sorting 
defect in each vps mutant. A good correlation between morphological phenotype 
and the extent of the CPY sorting defect was observed.
