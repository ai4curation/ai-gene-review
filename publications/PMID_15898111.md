Mitotic spindle checkpoint proteins have been shown to play a crucial role in 
the accurate segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Bub3 is a member 
of a group of mitotic checkpoint proteins that are essential for this process. 
To investigate the role of Bub3 in chromosome segregation and cancer 
development, we analyzed haploinsufficient cells in mice. Heterozygous Bub3 
embryonic fibroblasts displayed increased aneuploidy and premature 
sister-chromatid separation. In addition, when challenged with the microtubule 
disruptor nocodazole, the cells showed a slight increase in chromatid breakage 
and a decrease in the mitotic index. No substantial differences were observed 
between wild-type and Bub3 heterozygous mice in the frequency or the rate at 
which tumors appeared. Crossing Bub3(+/-) mice onto a heterozygous 
tumor-suppressor background of Trp53 or Rb1 similarly revealed no substantial 
differences in either the number or the rate at which tumors appeared. These 
results suggest that haploinsufficiency of Bub3 causes a slight increase in 
chromosome instability but is not clearly associated with a noticeable rise in 
the probability of tumor formation in the animal, possibly because of a 
partially functional mitotic checkpoint, or cells exhibiting chromosome 
instability could have activated the apoptosis pathway and thus escaped tumor 
induction and detection.
