The sorting nexins (SNXs) are a family of peripheral membrane proteins that 
direct protein trafficking decisions within the endocytic network. Emerging 
evidence in yeast and mammalian cells implicates a subgroup of SNXs in selective 
and non-selective forms of autophagy. Using siRNA and CRISPR-Cas9, we 
demonstrate that the SNX-BAR protein SNX4 is needed for efficient LC3 (also 
known as MAP1LC3) lipidation and autophagosome assembly in mammalian cells. 
SNX-BARs exist as homo- and hetero-dimers, and we show that SNX4 forms 
functional heterodimers with either SNX7 or SNX30 that associate with 
tubulovesicular endocytic membranes. Detailed image-based analysis during the 
early stages of autophagosome assembly reveals that SNX4-SNX7 is an 
autophagy-specific SNX-BAR heterodimer, required for efficient recruitment 
and/or retention of core autophagy regulators at the nascent isolation membrane. 
SNX4 partially colocalises with juxtanuclear ATG9A-positive membranes, with our 
data linking the autophagy defect upon SNX4 disruption to the mis-trafficking 
and/or retention of ATG9A in the Golgi region. Taken together, our findings show 
that the SNX4-SNX7 heterodimer coordinates ATG9A trafficking within the 
endocytic network to establish productive autophagosome assembly sites, thus 
extending knowledge of SNXs as positive regulators of autophagy.
