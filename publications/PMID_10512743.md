Interleukin-1 is a potent mediator of inflammation, involved in regulating a 
wide variety of physiological and cellular events. We have identified and 
characterized a novel member of the human interleukin-1 gene family (IL1HY1). 
The encoded protein demonstrates significant amino acid homology to the receptor 
antagonist (IL-1ra) at 52%. The gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2, 
in close proximity to the IL-1 locus. IL1HY1 message is tightly regulated being 
most predominantly expressed in the skin, but also detected in the spleen, brain 
leukocyte, and macrophage cell types. Furthermore, the message can be induced in 
THP-1 cells by phorbol ester (PMA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment.
