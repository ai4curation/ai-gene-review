Cadherins are single pass transmembrane proteins that mediate Ca(2+)-dependent 
homophilic cell-cell adhesion by linking the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells. In 
adherens junctions, the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins bind to beta-catenin, 
which in turn binds to the actin-associated protein alpha-catenin. The physical 
properties of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain and its interactions with 
beta-catenin have been investigated. Proteolytic sensitivity, tryptophan 
fluorescence, circular dichroism, and (1)H NMR measurements indicate that murine 
E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain is unstructured. Upon binding to beta-catenin, the 
domain becomes resistant to proteolysis, suggesting that it structures upon 
binding. Cadherin-beta-catenin complex stability is modestly dependent on ionic 
strength, indicating that, contrary to previous proposals, the interaction is 
not dominated by electrostatics. Comparison of 18 cadherin sequences indicates 
that their cytoplasmic domains are unlikely to be structured in isolation. This 
analysis also reveals the presence of PEST sequences, motifs associated with 
ubiquitin/proteosome degradation, that overlap the previously identified 
beta-catenin-binding site. It is proposed that binding of cadherins to 
beta-catenin prevents recognition of degradation signals that are exposed in the 
unstructured cadherin cytoplasmic domain, favoring a cell surface population of 
catenin-bound cadherins capable of participating in cell adhesion.
