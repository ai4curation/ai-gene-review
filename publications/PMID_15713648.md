Homologous recombinational repair (HRR) of DNA damage is critical for 
maintaining genome stability and tumor suppression. RAD51 and BRCA2 
colocalization in nuclear foci is a hallmark of HRR. BRCA2 has important roles 
in RAD51 focus formation and HRR of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We 
previously reported that BCCIPalpha interacts with BRCA2. We show that a second 
isoform, BCCIPbeta, also interacts with BRCA2 and that this interaction occurs 
in a region shared by BCCIPalpha and BCCIPbeta. We further show that 
chromatin-bound BRCA2 colocalizes with BCCIP nuclear foci and that most 
radiation-induced RAD51 foci colocalize with BCCIP. Reducing BCCIPalpha by 90% 
or BCCIPbeta by 50% by RNA interference markedly reduces RAD51 and BRCA2 foci 
and reduces HRR of DSBs by 20- to 100-fold. Similarly, reducing BRCA2 by 50% 
reduces RAD51 and BCCIP foci. These data indicate that BCCIP is critical for 
BRCA2- and RAD51-dependent responses to DNA damage and HRR.
