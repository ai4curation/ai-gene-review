The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt16/Cdc68, Pob3, and Nhp6 proteins (SPN or yFACT) 
bind to and alter nucleosomes in vitro, providing a potential explanation for 
their importance in both transcription and replication in vivo. We show that 
nucleosomes bound by either Nhp6 alone or the yFACT complex remain largely 
intact and immobile but are significantly reorganized, as indicated by changes 
in the pattern of sensitivity to DNase I and enhanced digestion by some 
restriction endonucleases. In contrast, yFACT enhanced access to exonuclease III 
only at very high levels of enzyme, suggesting that the DNA near the entry and 
exit sites of nucleosomes is largely unperturbed and that the position of the 
histone octamers relative to the DNA is not altered during reorganization. DNase 
I sensitivity was enhanced at sites clustered near the center of the nucleosomal 
DNA, away from the entry and exit points, and the pattern of nuclease 
sensitivity was only mildly affected by the configuration of linker extensions, 
further indicating that linkers play only a minor role in the reorganization of 
nucleosomes by yFACT. The DNA in contact with H2A-H2B dimers is therefore the 
region whose nuclease sensitivity was the least affected by yFACT 
reorganization. The most dramatic changes in nucleosome structure occurred when 
Spt16-Pob3 and the HMG box protein Nhp6 were both present, but Nhp6 alone 
altered DNase I sensitivity at some specific sites, supporting an independent 
role for this class of proteins in the general management of chromatin 
properties. yFACT activity does not require ATP hydrolysis and does not alter 
the position of nucleosomes, indicating that it acts through a mechanism 
distinct from chromatin remodeling. The results presented here suggest instead 
that yFACT promotes polymerase progression by reorganizing nucleosome cores into 
a less inhibitory conformation in which the properties of DNA sequences near the 
center of the nucleosomes are altered.
