The sarcomeric Z-disk, the anchoring plane of thin (actin) filaments, links 
titin (also called connectin) and actin filaments from opposing sarcomere halves 
in a lattice connected by alpha-actinin. We demonstrate by protein interaction 
analysis that two types of titin interactions are involved in the assembly of 
alpha-actinin into the Z-disk. Titin interacts via a single binding site with 
the two central spectrin-like repeats of the outermost pair of alpha-actinin 
molecules. In the central Z-disk, titin can interact with multiple alpha-actinin 
molecules via their C-terminal domains. These interactions allow the assembly of 
a ternary complex of titin, actin and alpha-actinin in vitro, and are expected 
to constrain the path of titin in the Z-disk. In thick skeletal muscle Z-disks, 
titin filaments cross over the Z-disk centre by approximately 30 nm, suggesting 
that their alpha-actinin-binding sites overlap in an antiparallel fashion. The 
combination of our biochemical and ultrastructural data now allows a molecular 
model of the sarcomeric Z-disk, where overlapping titin filaments and their 
interactions with the alpha-actinin rod and C-terminal domain can account for 
the essential ultrastructural features.
