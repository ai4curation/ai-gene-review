The mechanisms that control cell growth during the cell cycle are poorly 
understood. In budding yeast, cyclin dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) triggers 
polarization of the actin cytoskeleton and bud emergence in late G1 through 
activation of the Cdc42 GTPase. However, Cdk1 is not thought to be required for 
subsequent growth of the bud. Here, we show that Cdk1 has an unexpected role in 
controlling bud growth after bud emergence. Moreover, we show that G1 
cyclin-Cdk1 complexes specifically phosphorylate multiple proteins associated 
with Cdc24, the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) that activates the 
Cdc42 GTPase. A mutant form of a Cdc24-associated protein that fails to undergo 
Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation causes defects in bud growth. These results 
provide a direct link between Cdk1 activity and the control of polarized cell 
growth.
