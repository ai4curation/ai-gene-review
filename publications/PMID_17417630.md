The mechanisms that control cell growth during the cell cycle are poorly 
understood. In budding yeast, cyclin dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) triggers 
polarization of the actin cytoskeleton and bud emergence in late G1 through 
activation of the Cdc42 GTPase. However, Cdk1 is not thought to be required for 
subsequent growth of the bud. Here, we show that Cdk1 has an unexpected role in 
controlling bud growth after bud emergence. Moreover, we show that G1 
cyclin-Cdk1 complexes specifically phosphorylate multiple proteins associated 
with Cdc24, the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) that activates the 
Cdc42 GTPase. A mutant form of a Cdc24-associated protein that fails to undergo 
Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation causes defects in bud growth. These results 
provide a direct link between Cdk1 activity and the control of polarized cell 
growth.

Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6) are key regulators of the G1-S phase transition in the cell cycle. In cancer cells, CDK6 overexpression often outcompetes CDK4 in driving cell cycle progression, contributing to resistance against CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i). This suggests distinct functional and conformational differences between these two kinases, despite their striking structural and sequence similarities. Understanding the mechanisms that differentiate CDK4 and CDK6 is crucial, as resistance to CDK4/6i—frequently linked to CDK6 overexpression—remains a significant therapeutic challenge. Notably, CDK6 is often upregulated in CDK4/6i-resistant cancers and rapidly proliferating hematopoietic stem cells, underscoring its unique regulatory roles. We hypothesize that their distinct conformational dynamics explain their differences in phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, Rb, inhibitor efficacy, and cell cycle control. This leads us to question how their dissimilar conformational dynamics encode their distinct actions. To elucidate their differential activities, molecular mechanisms, and inhibitor binding, we combine biochemical assays and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We discover that CDK4 and CDK6 have distinct allosteric networks connecting the β3-αC loop and the G-loop. CDK6 exhibits stronger coupling and shorter path lengths between these regions, resulting in higher kinase activity upon cyclin binding and impacting inhibitor specificity. We also discover an unrecognized role of the unstructured CDK6 C-terminus, which allosterically connects and stabilizes the R-spine, facilitating slightly higher activity. Our findings bridge the gap between the structural similarity and functional divergence of CDK4 and CDK6, advancing the understanding of kinase regulation in cancer biology.
