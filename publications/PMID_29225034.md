The cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly (CIA) pathway functions to 
incorporate inorganic Fe-S cofactors into a variety of proteins, including 
several DNA repair enzymes. However, the mechanisms regulating the CIA pathway 
are unknown. We describe here that the MAGE-F1-NSE1 E3 ubiquitin ligase 
regulates the CIA pathway through ubiquitination and degradation of the 
CIA-targeting protein MMS19. Overexpression or knockout of MAGE-F1 altered Fe-S 
incorporation into MMS19-dependent DNA repair enzymes, DNA repair capacity, 
sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, and iron homeostasis. Intriguingly, MAGE-F1 
has undergone adaptive pseudogenization in select mammalian lineages. In 
contrast, MAGE-F1 is highly amplified in multiple human cancer types and 
amplified tumors have increased mutational burden. Thus, flux through the CIA 
pathway can be regulated by degradation of the substrate-specifying MMS19 
protein and its downregulation is a common feature in cancer and is 
evolutionarily controlled.
