Nascent secretory proteins are extensively scrutinized at the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER). Various signatures of client proteins, including exposure of 
hydrophobic patches or unpaired sulfhydryls, are coordinately utilized to reduce 
nonnative proteins in the ER. We report here the cryptic N-glycosylation site as 
a recognition signal for unfolding of a natively nonglycosylated protein, 
transthyretin (TTR), involved in familial amyloidosis. Folding and ER-associated 
degradation (ERAD) perturbation analyses revealed that prolonged TTR unfolding 
induces externalization of cryptic N-glycosylation site and triggers 
STT3B-dependent posttranslational N-glycosylation. Inhibition of 
posttranslational N-glycosylation increases detergent-insoluble TTR aggregates 
and decreases cell proliferation of mutant TTR-expressing cells. Moreover, this 
modification provides an alternative pathway for degradation, which is 
EDEM3-mediated N-glycan-dependent ERAD, distinct from the major pathway of 
Herp-mediated N-glycan-independent ERAD. Hence we postulate that STT3B-dependent 
posttranslational N-glycosylation is part of a triage-salvage system recognizing 
cryptic N-glycosylation sites of secretory proteins to preserve protein 
homeostasis.
