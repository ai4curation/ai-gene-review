There are several transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) pathways in the 
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. One of these pathways regulates body length and 
is composed of the ligand DBL-1, serine/threonine protein kinase receptors SMA-6 
and DAF-4, and cytoplasmic signaling components SMA-2, SMA-3, and SMA-4. To 
further examine the molecular mechanisms of body-length regulation in the 
nematode by the TGF-beta pathway, we examined the regional requirement for the 
type-I receptor SMA-6. Using a SMA-6::GFP (green fluorescent protein) reporter 
gene, sma-6 was highly expressed in the hypodermis, unlike the type-II receptor 
DAF-4, which is reported to be ubiquitously expressed. We then examined the 
ability of SMA-6 expression in different regions of the C. elegans body to 
rescue the sma-6 phenotype (small) and found that hypodermal expression of SMA-6 
is necessary and sufficient for the growth and maintenance of body length. We 
also demonstrate that GATA sequences in the sma-6 promoter contribute to the 
hypodermal expression of sma-6.
