The Sup35 (eRF3) translation termination factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae can 
undergo a prion-like conformational conversion, thus resulting in the [PSI(+)] 
nonsense-suppressor determinant. In vivo this process depends critically on the 
chaperone Hsp104, whose lack or overexpression can cure [PSI(+)]. The use of 
artificial prion [PSI(+)PS] based on a hybrid Sup35PS with prion domain from the 
yeast Pichia methanolica allowed us to uncover three more chaperones, Ssb1, 
Ssa1, and Ydj1, whose overexpression can cure prion determinants. Here, we used 
the [PSI(+)PS] to search a multicopy yeast genomic library for novel factors 
able to cure prions. It was found that overexpression of the Hsp40 family 
chaperones Sis1 and Ynl077w, chaperone Sti1, transcriptional factors Sfl1 and 
Ssn8, and acidic ribosomal protein Rpp0 can interfere with propagation and 
manifestation of [PSI(+)PS] in a prion strain-specific manner. Some of these 
factors also affected the manifestation and propagation of conventional 
[PSI(+)]. Excess of Sfl1, Ssn8, and Rpp0 influenced at least one of the tested 
chaperone-specific promoters, SSA4, HSP104, and model promoters, with either the 
heat shock or stress response elements. Thus, the induction of chaperone 
expression by these proteins could explain their prion-curing effects.
