A20 possesses both deubiquitinase (DUB) and ubiquitin E3 ligase activities that 
are required for termination of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling leading to 
NF-kappaB activation and for blockage of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced 
cytotoxicity and apoptosis. A20 is induced by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 
oncoprotein LMP1. However, its dual ubiquitin-editing activities have not been 
investigated in the context of either EBV infection or IRF7 responses. Both A20 
and IRF7 have oncogenic properties. We have recently shown that LMP1 activates 
IRF7 through K63-linked ubiquitination which requires RIP1 and TRAF6, but how 
this ubiquitination event is regulated has not been studied. Here, we show that 
A20 negatively regulates IRF7 transcriptional activity induced by LMP1. Deletion 
or mutation of A20 C-terminal zinc finger motifs had no effect on the inhibition 
of IRF7 activity, whereas DUB-deficient truncation or point mutation ablated the 
ability of A20 to inhibit IRF7. Correspondingly, the A20 N-terminal DUB domain, 
but not the C-terminal E3 ligase domain, interacts physically with IRF7. 
Transient expression of A20 reduced K63-linked ubiquitination of IRF7 in vivo, 
but an in vitro deubiquitination assay with purified constituents shows that 
IRF7 did not act as a substrate for A20 DUB activity. Moreover, A20 interacts 
with IRF7 endogenously in latently EBV-infected type 3 Raji cells, in which 
expression of both A20 and IRF7 is constitutively induced by the considerable 
level of endogenous LMP1. Knockdown of endogenous A20 in Raji cells by 
expression of A20 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors increases endogenous IRF7 
activity and ubiquitination, as well as the protein level of LMP1, a target of 
IRF7. Thus, A20 negatively regulates LMP1-stimulated IRF7 ubiquitination and 
activity in EBV latency, and its DUB activity is indispensable for this 
function. Finally, we discussed the regulation and function of IRFs in EBV 
latency.
