We have isolated and characterized a cDNA encoding a mammalian nuclear 
phosphoprotein NUCKS, previously designated P1. Molecular analyses of several 
overlapping and full-length cDNAs from HeLa cells and rat brain revealed a 
protein with an apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa in both species. The deduced 
amino-acid sequences are highly conserved between human and rodents, but show no 
homology with primary structures in protein databases or with translated 
sequences of cDNAs in cDNA databanks. Although the protein has some features in 
common with the high mobility group proteins HMGI/Y, attempts to find a putative 
protein family by database query using both sequence alignment methods and 
amino-acid composition have failed. Northern blot analyses revealed that human 
and rat tissues contain three NUCKS transcripts varying in size from 1.5 to 6.5 
kb. All human and rat tissues express the gene, but the level of transcripts 
varies among different tissues. Circular dichroism analysis and secondary 
structure predictions based on the amino-acid sequence indicate a low level of 
alpha helical content and substantial amounts of beta turn structures. The 
protein is phosphorylated in all phases of the cell cycle and exhibits 
mitosis-specific phosphorylation of threonine residues. Phosphopeptide mapping 
and back-phosphorylation experiments employing NUCKS from HeLa interphase and 
metaphase cells show that the protein is phosphorylated by Cdk1 during mitosis 
of the cell cycle.
