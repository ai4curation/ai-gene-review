Import of the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) into mitochondria requires the soluble TIM10 
complex to cross the intermembrane space. We report here that Tim9 and Tim10 
purified from Escherichia coli can form a complex of the same size as the 
endogenous complex from yeast mitochondria. This shows that no other 
mitochondrial protein is required for the formation of the TIM10 complex. 
Co-expression of both proteins rendered Tim9 more soluble and allowed 
purification of the reconstituted complex in a single step. Urea/EDTA treatment 
of recombinant Tim10 allowed its import into tim10-ts mitochondria that lack 
endogenous Tim10 and cannot import AAC. In this way, we were able to (i) 
reconstitute the TIM10 complex in the intermembrane space and (ii) restore 
import of AAC to almost wild-type levels. The reconstituted TIM10 complex not 
only facilitated passage of AAC across the outer membrane but also ensured its 
accurate membrane insertion. We conclude that the TIM10 complex can be formed 
exclusively from Tim9 and Tim10 and that the reconstituted complex efficiently 
restores AAC import in a strain lacking the TIM10 complex.
