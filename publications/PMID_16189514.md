Systematic mapping of protein-protein interactions, or 'interactome' mapping, 
was initiated in model organisms, starting with defined biological processes and 
then expanding to the scale of the proteome. Although far from complete, such 
maps have revealed global topological and dynamic features of interactome 
networks that relate to known biological properties, suggesting that a human 
interactome map will provide insight into development and disease mechanisms at 
a systems level. Here we describe an initial version of a proteome-scale map of 
human binary protein-protein interactions. Using a stringent, high-throughput 
yeast two-hybrid system, we tested pairwise interactions among the products of 
approximately 8,100 currently available Gateway-cloned open reading frames and 
detected approximately 2,800 interactions. This data set, called CCSB-HI1, has a 
verification rate of approximately 78% as revealed by an independent co-affinity 
purification assay, and correlates significantly with other biological 
attributes. The CCSB-HI1 data set increases by approximately 70% the set of 
available binary interactions within the tested space and reveals more than 300 
new connections to over 100 disease-associated proteins. This work represents an 
important step towards a systematic and comprehensive human interactome project.
