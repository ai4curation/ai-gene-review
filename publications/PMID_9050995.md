In several clones of SV40-transformed human cells, we investigated the relative 
amounts of large T-Antigen (T-Ag) and p53 proteins, both unbound and associated 
within complexes, with the goal of identifying changes associated with 
transformation and immortalization. Cells were transformed by wild type (wt) 
T-Ag, a functionally temperature sensitive T-Ag (tsA58) and other T-Ag variants. 
Western analysis showed that while most of the T-Ag was ultimately bound by p53, 
most of the p53 remained unbound to T-Ag. Unbound p53 remained in the 
supernatant after a T-Ag immunoprecipitation and p53 was present in two to 
fourfold excess of T-Ag. In one transformant there was five to tenfold more p53 
than T-Ag. p53 was present in transformants in amounts at least 200-fold greater 
than in untransformed human cells. In wt and variant T-Ag transformants, 
including those generated with tsA58 T-Ag, large amounts of unbound p53 were 
present in both pre-crisis and immortal cells and when the cells were grown at 
permissive or non-permissive temperatures. We also found that in transformants 
produced by tsA58, an SV40/JCV chimeric T-Ag and other variants, T-Ag appeared 
to form a complex with p53 slowly perhaps because one or both proteins matured 
slowly. The presence in transformed human cells of large amounts of unbound p53 
and in excess of T-Ag suggests that sequestration of p53 by T-Ag, resulting from 
complex formation, is required neither for morphological transformation nor 
immortalization of human cells. Rather, these results support the proposal that 
high levels of p53, the T-Ag/p53 complexes, or other biochemical event(s), lead 
to transformation and immortalization of human cells by T-Ag.
