Mutations in the tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TRMT1) gene have been identified as 
the cause of certain forms of autosomal-recessive intellectual disability (ID). 
However, the molecular pathology underlying ID-associated TRMT1 mutations is 
unknown, since the biological role of the encoded TRMT1 protein remains to be 
determined. Here, we have elucidated the molecular targets and function of TRMT1 
to uncover the cellular effects of ID-causing TRMT1 mutations. Using human cells 
that have been rendered deficient in TRMT1, we show that TRMT1 is responsible 
for catalyzing the dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) base modification in both nucleus- 
and mitochondrion-encoded tRNAs. TRMT1-deficient cells exhibit decreased 
proliferation rates, alterations in global protein synthesis, and perturbations 
in redox homeostasis, including increased endogenous ROS levels and 
hypersensitivity to oxidizing agents. Notably, ID-causing TRMT1 variants are 
unable to catalyze the formation of m2,2G due to defects in RNA binding and 
cannot rescue oxidative stress sensitivity. Our results uncover a biological 
role for TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modification in redox metabolism and show that 
individuals with TRMT1-associated ID are likely to have major perturbations in 
cellular homeostasis due to the lack of m2,2G modifications.
