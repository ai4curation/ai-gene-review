The role of endogenous regucalcin in the regulation of deoxyribonuleic acid 
(DNA) synthesis in the nuclei of the cloned rat hepatoma cells (H4-II-E) with 
proliferative cells was investigated. Cells were cultured for 6-96 h in a 
alpha-minimum essential medium (alpha-MEM) containing fetal bovine serum (FBS; 1 
or 10%). Cell number was significantly increased between 24 and 96 h after 
culture with 10% FBS; cell proliferation was markedly stimulated by culture with 
10% FBS as compared with that of 1% FBS. In vitro DNA synthesis activity in the 
nuclei of cells was significantly elevated 6 h after culture with 10% FBS and 
its elevation was remarkable at 12 and 24 h after the culture. Nuclear DNA 
synthesis activity was significantly reduced in the presence of various protein 
kinase inhibitors (PD98059, staurosprine, or trifluoperazine) in the reaction 
mixture containing the nuclei of cells cultured for 12 and 24 h with FBS (1 and 
10%). The addition of regucalcin (10(-7) and 10(-6)M) in the reaction mixture 
caused a significant inhibition of nuclear DNA synthesis activity. The presence 
of anti-regucalcin monoclonal antibody (25-100 ng/ml) in the reaction mixture 
containing the nuclei of cells cultured for 24 h with 10% FBS resulted in a 
significant increase in nuclear DNA synthesis activity. This increase was 
completely blocked by the addition of regucalcin (10(-6) M). The effect of 
anti-regucalcin antibody (100 ng/ml) in increasing nuclear DNA synthesis 
activity was significantly inhibited in the presence of various protein kinase 
inhibitors. DNA synthesis activity was significantly enhanced in the presence of 
anti-regucalcin antibody (100 ng/ml) in the reaction mixture containing the 
nuclei of cells cultured for 24 h with 10% FBS in the presence of Bay K 8644 
(2.5 x 10(-6) M). Culture with Bay K 8644 did not cause a significant increase 
in DNA synthesis activity in the absence of anti-regucalcin antibody. The 
present study demonstrates that endogenous regucalcin plays a suppressive role 
in the enhancement of nuclear DNA synthesis with proliferative cells.
