The role of endogenous regucalcin in the regulation of deoxyribonuleic acid 
(DNA) synthesis in the nuclei of the cloned rat hepatoma cells (H4-II-E) with 
proliferative cells was investigated. Cells were cultured for 6-96 h in a 
alpha-minimum essential medium (alpha-MEM) containing fetal bovine serum (FBS; 1 
or 10%). Cell number was significantly increased between 24 and 96 h after 
culture with 10% FBS; cell proliferation was markedly stimulated by culture with 
10% FBS as compared with that of 1% FBS. In vitro DNA synthesis activity in the 
nuclei of cells was significantly elevated 6 h after culture with 10% FBS and 
its elevation was remarkable at 12 and 24 h after the culture. Nuclear DNA 
synthesis activity was significantly reduced in the presence of various protein 
kinase inhibitors (PD98059, staurosprine, or trifluoperazine) in the reaction 
mixture containing the nuclei of cells cultured for 12 and 24 h with FBS (1 and 
10%). The addition of regucalcin (10(-7) and 10(-6)M) in the reaction mixture 
caused a significant inhibition of nuclear DNA synthesis activity. The presence 
of anti-regucalcin monoclonal antibody (25-100 ng/ml) in the reaction mixture 
containing the nuclei of cells cultured for 24 h with 10% FBS resulted in a 
significant increase in nuclear DNA synthesis activity. This increase was 
completely blocked by the addition of regucalcin (10(-6) M). The effect of 
anti-regucalcin antibody (100 ng/ml) in increasing nuclear DNA synthesis 
activity was significantly inhibited in the presence of various protein kinase 
inhibitors. DNA synthesis activity was significantly enhanced in the presence of 
anti-regucalcin antibody (100 ng/ml) in the reaction mixture containing the 
nuclei of cells cultured for 24 h with 10% FBS in the presence of Bay K 8644 
(2.5 x 10(-6) M). Culture with Bay K 8644 did not cause a significant increase 
in DNA synthesis activity in the absence of anti-regucalcin antibody. The 
present study demonstrates that endogenous regucalcin plays a suppressive role 
in the enhancement of nuclear DNA synthesis with proliferative cells.

Abstract

Regucalcin, which its gene is located on the X chromosome, plays a multifunctional role as a suppressor protein in cell signal transduction in various types of cells and tissues. The suppression of regucalcin gene expression has been shown to involve in carcinogenesis. Regucalcin gene expression was uniquely downregulated in carcinogenesis of rat liver in vivo, although the expression of other many genes was upregulated, indicating that endogenous regucalcin plays a suppressive role in the development of hepatocarcinogenesis. Overexpression of endogenous regucalcin was found to suppress proliferation of rat cloned hepatoma cells in vitro. Moreover, the regucalcin gene and its protein levels were demonstrated specifically to downregulate in human hepatocellular carcinoma by analysis with multiple gene expression profiles and proteomics. Regucalcin gene expression was also found to suppress in human tumor tissues including kidney, lung, brain, breast and prostate, suggesting that repressed regucalcin gene expression leads to the development of carcinogenesis in various tissues. Regucalcin may play a role as a suppressor protein in carcinogenesis. Overexpression of endogenous regucalcin is suggested to reveal preventive and therapeutic effects on carcinogenesis. Delivery of the regucalcin gene may be a novel useful tool in the gene therapy of carcinogenesis. This review will discuss regarding to an involvement of regucalcin as a suppressor protein in human carcinogenesis in insight into the gene therapy.

Introduction

Regucalcin plays a pivotal role as a suppressor protein in various signal transductions to maintain cell homeostasis for stimuli in various types of cells and tissues (reviewed in Yamaguchi 2005 , 2011a ). The regucalcin gene is located on the X chromosome, and its organization consists of seven exons and six introns (Shimokawa et al. 1995 ). Regucalcin and its gene (gene symbol; rgn ) are identified in over 15 species consisting of regucalcin family in vertebrate and invertebrate species (Yamaguchi 2011b ). Regucalcin is expressed in various types of cells and tissues, although its expression is predominant in the liver and kidney (Yamaguchi 2005 , 2011a ). Regucalcin gene expression is regulated through various transcription factors (including AP-1, NF1-A1, RGPR-p117, β-catenin, SP1 and others), which are identified as the enhancer and suppressor, and this expression is regulated by hormonal stimulation and physiological state (Yamaguchi 2010 , 2013a ).

Regucalcin plays a pivotal role as a suppressor protein in signal transductions to maintain cell homeostasis for stimuli in various type cells (Yamaguchi 2005 , 2011a ). Regucalcin, which is localized in the nucleus, inhibits nuclear Ca 2+ -dependent and nuclear Ca 2+ -independent protein kinases and protein phosphatases, Ca 2+ -activated endonuclease and DNA and RNA synthesis (Yamaguchi 2005 , 2011a , 2013a ). Regucalcin plays a role as a suppressor protein in cell proliferation that is mediated through various signaling pathways in normal cells and hepatoma cells (Yamaguchi 2013b ). Regucalcin causes G1 and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in normal and cancer cells (Yamaguchi 2013b ). Overexpression of endogenous regucalcin regulates the gene expression of various proteins that are related to cell proliferation (Yamaguchi 2013b ). Suppressive effects of regucalcin on cell proliferation are not dependent on apoptosis; regucalcin prevents apoptosis that is mediated through multisignaling pathways (Yamaguchi 2013c ).

There is growing evidence that regucalcin is involved in human carcinogenesis. Regucalcin plays a regulatory role in the suppression of cell proliferation, depression of oncogene expression and stimulation of tumor suppressor gene expression in hepatoma cells (Yamaguchi 2013a , b ). Moreover, the regucalcin gene and protein expressions have been demonstrated to specifically downregulate in human carcinoma by analysis with multiple gene expression profiles and proteomics (Suzuki et al. 2004 ; Fernando et al. 2013 ; Graveel et al. 2001 ; Choia et al. 2004 ; Blanc et al. 2005 ; Roy et al. 2010 ; Schröder et al. 2011 ). Suppressed regucalcin gene expression is proposed to lead to carcinogenesis. Regucalcin may play a role as a key molecule as a suppressor protein in cell proliferation and carcinogenesis. Overexpression of regucalcin may reveal preventive and therapeutic effects on carcinogenesis in vivo. This review will discuss concerning an involvement of regucalcin as a suppressor in human carcinogenesis.
