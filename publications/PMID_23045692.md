The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) proteins have a 
critical function in abscission, the final separation of the daughter cells 
during cytokinesis. Here, we describe the structure and function of a previously 
uncharacterized ESCRT-III interacting protein, MIT-domain containing protein 1 
(MITD1). Crystal structures of MITD1 reveal a dimer, with a 
microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain at the N terminus and a 
unique, unanticipated phospholipase D-like (PLD) domain at the C terminus that 
binds membranes. We show that the MIT domain binds to a subset of ESCRT-III 
subunits and that this interaction mediates MITD1 recruitment to the midbody 
during cytokinesis. Depletion of MITD1 causes a distinct cytokinetic phenotype 
consistent with destabilization of the midbody and abscission failure. These 
results suggest a model whereby MITD1 coordinates the activity of ESCRT-III 
during abscission with earlier events in the final stages of cell division.

Abstract

The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) proteins have a critical function in abscission, the final separation of the daughter cells during cytokinesis. Here, we describe the structure and function of a previously uncharacterized ESCRT-III interacting protein, MIT-domain containing protein 1 (MITD1). Crystal structures of MITD1 reveal a dimer, with a microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain at the N terminus and a unique, unanticipated phospholipase D-like (PLD) domain at the C terminus that binds membranes. We show that the MIT domain binds to a subset of ESCRT-III subunits and that this interaction mediates MITD1 recruitment to the midbody during cytokinesis. Depletion of MITD1 causes a distinct cytokinetic phenotype consistent with destabilization of the midbody and abscission failure. These results suggest a model whereby MITD1 coordinates the activity of ESCRT-III during abscission with earlier events in the final stages of cell division.

Discussion

We have shown that MITD1 interacts with the core ESCRT machinery through an N-terminal MIT domain that binds MIMs in a subset of ESCRT-III subunits. At a structural level, this interaction shows close conservation with other MIT-containing proteins despite poor sequence identity. MITD1 has a role in cytokinesis by facilitating ESCRT-III–dependent events in cell division, whereas it is dispensable for other ESCRT-mediated functions.

Our experiments reveal that MITD1 depletion results in cytokinesis failure due to both midbody instability and abscission arrest. Therefore, it is possible that MITD1 coordinates abscission with earlier events in cytokinesis. As cytokinesis progresses, the cytoskeleton needs to undergo a dramatic reorganization before abscission takes place. In particular, actin filaments within the cleavage furrow need to be depolymerized, and microtubules spanning the midbody need to be removed ( 35 , 36 ). Simultaneously, ESCRT-III forms helical contractile filaments at the intercellular bridge, which enables full constriction at the abscission site ( 11 , 12 ). Through its ability to bind membranes, MITD1 could stabilize the cortex flanking the furrow after its ingression. Accordingly, loss of MITD1 results in cortical instability, as revealed by increased blebbing and premature abscission in the dividing cells. In this context, MITD1 could coordinate actin removal from the midbody and abscission by ESCRT-III. Interestingly, MITD1 may interact with a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho (MCF2) ( 37 ), suggesting a potential link with actin remodelling activities. Other connections between the ESCRT machinery and actomyosin are suggested by a reported ALIX/actin interaction and the remodelling of actin filaments observed in TSG101 knockout cells ( 38 , 39 ).

The late cytokinesis phenotype observed in MITD1-depleted cells resembles the phenotypes observed upon depletion of other ESCRT proteins. This result, together with the fact that the interaction with ESCRT-III is needed for MITD1’s localization at the midbody, suggests that MITD1 acts in concert with the ESCRT machinery to facilitate abscission. Our structural and biochemical data are consistent with a model whereby MITD1 dimers bind multiple ESCRT-III subunits and lipids simultaneously ( Fig. 4 B ), suggesting that MITD1 could stabilize ESCRT-III filaments and anchor them to the midbody during the late stages of cytokinesis.

The C-terminal domain of MITD1 has an intriguing and unanticipated PLD-like fold. In contrast to a dimeric PLD active site as found in bacterial Nuc ( 31 ), dimer formation by MITD1 in solution does not place the putative catalytic histidine residues near each other. Instead, these residues are on opposing ends of MITD1 (separated by approximately 60 Å) ( Fig. 4 A and Fig. S7 A ), forming an “inside out” type dimer compared with Nuc ( Fig. S7 A and C ), suggesting that the observed MITD1 dimer cannot operate by the canonical PLD mechanism. Accordingly, we have been unable to show that MITD1 functions as a PLD enzyme. Interestingly, the MITD1 dimer that we observe exposes the HxR motif as part of a highly conserved surface patch ( Fig. S7 D ). This conserved surface could interact with another as yet unidentified protein to complement the MITD1 active site and yield a catalytically active heterodimer ( Fig. S7 E ). Complementation could also be mediated by MITD1 itself through oligomerisation of the crystallographic dimers on membranes. Alternatively, MITD1 might have evolved from a PLD-type enzyme, but then lost catalytic activity so that it has a purely structural role in regulating ESCRT-III assemblies on membranes.
