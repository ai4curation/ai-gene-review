SorLA is a neuronal sorting receptor considered to be a major risk factor for 
Alzheimer's disease. We have recently reported that it directs lysosomal 
targeting of nascent neurotoxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides by directly binding Aβ. 
Here, we determined the crystal structure of the human sorLA domain responsible 
for Aβ capture, Vps10p, in an unbound state and in complex with two ligands. 
Vps10p assumes a ten-bladed β-propeller fold with a large tunnel at the center. 
An internal ligand derived from the sorLA propeptide bound inside the tunnel to 
extend the β-sheet of one of the propeller blades. The structure of the sorLA 
Vps10p-Aβ complex revealed that the same site is used. Peptides are recognized 
by sorLA Vps10p in redundant modes without strict dependence on a particular 
amino acid sequence, thus suggesting a broad specificity toward peptides with a 
propensity for β-sheet formation.
