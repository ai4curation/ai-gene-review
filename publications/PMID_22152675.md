expands the role of the TMEM family at the ciliary transition zone.

Joubert syndrome related disorders (JSRDs) have broad but variable phenotypic 
overlap with other ciliopathies. The molecular etiology of this overlap is 
unclear but probably arises from disrupting common functional module components 
within primary cilia. To identify additional module elements associated with 
JSRDs, we performed homozygosity mapping followed by next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) and uncovered mutations in TMEM237 (previously known as ALS2CR4). We show 
that loss of the mammalian TMEM237, which localizes to the ciliary transition 
zone (TZ), results in defective ciliogenesis and deregulation of Wnt signaling. 
Furthermore, disruption of Danio rerio (zebrafish) tmem237 expression produces 
gastrulation defects consistent with ciliary dysfunction, and Caenorhabditis 
elegans jbts-14 genetically interacts with nphp-4, encoding another TZ protein, 
to control basal body-TZ anchoring to the membrane and ciliogenesis. Both 
mammalian and C. elegans TMEM237/JBTS-14 require RPGRIP1L/MKS5 for proper TZ 
localization, and we demonstrate additional functional interactions between 
C. elegans JBTS-14 and MKS-2/TMEM216, MKSR-1/B9D1, and MKSR-2/B9D2. 
Collectively, our findings integrate TMEM237/JBTS-14 in a complex interaction 
network of TZ-associated proteins and reveal a growing contribution of a TZ 
functional module to the spectrum of ciliopathy phenotypes.
