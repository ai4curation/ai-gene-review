Programmed cell death is critical for normal nervous system development and is 
regulated by Bcl-2 and Caspase family members. Targeted disruption of bcl-x(L), 
an antiapoptotic bcl-2 gene family member, causes massive death of immature 
neurons in the developing nervous system whereas disruption of caspase-9, a 
proapoptotic caspase gene family member, leads to decreased neuronal apoptosis 
and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. To determine whether Bcl-X(L) and 
Caspase-9 interact in an obligate pathway of neuronal apoptosis, bcl-x/caspase-9 
double homozygous mutants were generated. The increased apoptosis of immature 
neurons observed in Bcl-X(L)-deficient embryos was completely prevented by 
concomitant Caspase-9 deficiency. In contrast, bcl-x(-/-)/caspase-9(-/-) 
embryonic mice exhibited an expanded ventricular zone and neuronal malformations 
identical to that observed in mice lacking only Caspase-9. These results 
indicate both epistatic and independent actions of Bcl-X(L) and Caspase-9 in 
neuronal programmed cell death. To examine Bcl-2 and Caspase family-dependent 
apoptotic pathways in telencephalic neurons, we compared the effects of cytosine 
arabinoside (AraC), a known neuronal apoptosis inducer, on wild-type, Bcl-X(L)-, 
Bax-, Caspase-9-, Caspase-3-, and p53-deficient telencephalic neurons in vitro. 
AraC caused extensive apoptosis of wild-type and Bcl-X(L)-deficient neurons. 
p53- and Bax-deficient neurons showed marked protection from AraC-induced death, 
whereas Caspase-9- and Caspase-3-deficient neurons showed minimal or no 
protection, respectively. These findings contrast with our previous 
investigation of AraC-induced apoptosis of telencephalic neural precursor cells 
in which death was completely blocked by p53 or Caspase-9 deficiency but not Bax 
deficiency. In total, these results indicate a transition from Caspase-9- to 
Bax- and Bcl-X(L)-mediated neuronal apoptosis.

Programmed cell death is critical for normal nervous system development and is regulated by Bcl-2 and Caspase family members. Targeted disruption of bcl-xL, an antiapoptotic bcl-2 gene family member, causes massive death of immature neurons in the developing nervous system whereas disruption of caspase-9, a proapoptoticcaspase gene family member, leads to decreased neuronal apoptosis and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. To determine whether Bcl-XL and Caspase-9 interact in an obligate pathway of neuronal apoptosis, bcl-x/caspase-9 double homozygous mutants were generated. The increased apoptosis of immature neurons observed in Bcl-XL-deficient embryos was completely prevented by concomitant Caspase-9 deficiency. In contrast,bcl-x−/−/caspase-9−/−embryonic mice exhibited an expanded ventricular zone and neuronal malformations identical to that observed in mice lacking only Caspase-9. These results indicate both epistatic and independent actions of Bcl-XL and Caspase-9 in neuronal programmed cell death.

To examine Bcl-2 and Caspase family-dependent apoptotic pathways in telencephalic neurons, we compared the effects of cytosine arabinoside (AraC), a known neuronal apoptosis inducer, on wild-type, Bcl-XL-, Bax-, Caspase-9-, Caspase-3-, and p53-deficient telencephalic neurons in vitro. AraC caused extensive apoptosis of wild-type and Bcl-XL-deficient neurons. p53- and Bax-deficient neurons showed marked protection from AraC-induced death, whereas Caspase-9- and Caspase-3-deficient neurons showed minimal or no protection, respectively. These findings contrast with our previous investigation of AraC-induced apoptosis of telencephalic neural precursor cells in which death was completely blocked by p53 or Caspase-9 deficiency but not Bax deficiency. In total, these results indicate a transition from Caspase-9- to Bax- and Bcl-XL-mediated neuronal apoptosis.
