FAP-1 (Fas-associated phosphatase-1) was previously identified as a protein that 
associates with a negative regulatory domain (C-terminal 15 amino acids) of Fas 
using the yeast 2-hybrid system. Functional analysis indicated that FAP-1 
expression correlates with resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis in human cancer 
cells. We first generated anti-FAP-1 polyclonal antibody and confirmed the 
interaction of FAP-1 and Fas in vivo. FAP-1 interacted with wild-type, but not 
mutant, Fas (tPLV) in 293T cells after transfecting FAP-1 and Fas or its mutant. 
To investigate the functional role of FAP-1 in Fas-mediated signal transduction, 
we established stable transfectants of FAP-1 in 3 human cancer cell lines. 
Apoptosis assays demonstrated that cancer cells over-expressing FAP-1 increased 
the resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis by the anti-Fas antibody CH-11 in 
contrast with the wild types or the vector-transfected cells. In addition, FAP-1 
regulated the activity of both caspases 3 and 8. Our data indicate a functional 
role for FAP-1 as a negative regulator of Fas-mediated apoptosis in human cancer 
cells and suggest that an additional signal-transducing molecule may be required 
for complete suppression of Fas-mediated apoptosis.
