The essential checkpoint kinase Chk1 is required for cell-cycle delays after DNA 
damage or blocked DNA replication. However, it is unclear whether Chk1 is 
involved in the repair of damaged DNA. Here we establish that Chk1 is a key 
regulator of genome maintenance by the homologous recombination repair (HRR) 
system. Abrogation of Chk1 function with small interfering RNA or chemical 
antagonists inhibits HRR, leading to persistent unrepaired DNA double-strand 
breaks (DSBs) and cell death after replication inhibition with hydroxyurea or 
DNA-damage caused by camptothecin. After hydroxyurea treatment, the essential 
recombination repair protein RAD51 is recruited to DNA repair foci performing a 
vital role in correct HRR. We demonstrate that Chk1 interacts with RAD51, and 
that RAD51 is phosphorylated on Thr 309 in a Chk1-dependent manner. Consistent 
with a functional interplay between Chk1 and RAD51, Chk1-depleted cells failed 
to form RAD51 nuclear foci after exposure to hydroxyurea, and cells expressing a 
phosphorylation-deficient mutant RAD51(T309A) were hypersensitive to 
hydroxyurea. These results highlight a crucial role for the Chk1 signalling 
pathway in protecting cells against lethal DNA lesions through regulation of 
HRR.
