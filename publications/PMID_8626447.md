B cell antigen receptor (BCR) cross-linking activates both Src family and Syk 
tyrosine kinases, resulting in increased cellular protein-tyrosine 
phosphorylation and activation of several downstream signaling enzymes. To 
define the role of Syk in these events, we expressed the BCR in the AtT20 mouse 
pituitary cell line. These nonlymphoid cells endogenously expressed the Src 
family kinase Fyn but not Syk. Anti-IgM stimulation of these cells failed to 
induce most of the signaling events that occur in B cells. BCR-expressing AtT20 
transfectants were generated that also expressed Syk. Syk expression 
reconstituted several signaling events upon anti-IgM stimulation, including Syk 
phosphorylation and association with the BCR, tyrosine phosphorylation of 
numerous proteins including Shc, and activation of mitogen-activated protein 
kinase. In contrast, Syk expression did not reconstitute anti-IgM-induced 
inositol phosphate production. A catalytically inactive Syk mutant could 
associate with the BCR and become tyrosine phosphorylated but could not 
reconstitute downstream signaling events. Expression of the Src family kinase 
Lck instead of Syk also did not reconstitute signaling. Thus, wild type Syk was 
required to reconstitute several BCR-induced signaling events but was not 
sufficient to couple the BCR to the phosphoinositide signaling pathway.
