Vesicular- or vacuolar-type adenosine triphosphatases (V-ATPases) are ATP-driven 
proton pumps comprised of a cytoplasmic V1 complex for ATP hydrolysis and a 
membrane-embedded Vo complex for proton transfer. They play important roles in 
acidification of intracellular vesicles, organelles, and the extracellular 
milieu in eukaryotes. Here, we report cryoelectron microscopy structures of 
human V-ATPase in three rotational states at up to 2.9-Å resolution. Aided by 
mass spectrometry, we build all known protein subunits with associated N-linked 
glycans and identify glycolipids and phospholipids in the Vo complex. We define 
ATP6AP1 as a structural hub for Vo complex assembly because it connects to 
multiple Vo subunits and phospholipids in the c-ring. The glycolipids and the 
glycosylated Vo subunits form a luminal glycan coat critical for V-ATPase 
folding, localization, and stability. This study identifies mechanisms of 
V-ATPase assembly and biogenesis that rely on the integrated roles of ATP6AP1, 
glycans, and lipids.

INTRODUCTION

As ATP hydrolysis-driven proton pumps that acidify intracellular vesicles,
organelles, and extracellular milieu, V-ATPases play important roles in the
regulation of fundamental physiological processes in all eukaryotes. Vesicular and
organellar V-ATPases are essential in establishing and maintaining the pH
homeostasis of endosomes and lysosomes and in supporting intracellular membrane
trafficking and protein degradation, which in turn are important for immune
responses, cell signaling, and neurotransmitter release ( Casey et al., 2010 ; Cruciat et al., 2010 ; Forgac,
1992 , 2007 ; Hinton et al., 2009 ; Pamarthy et al., 2018 ; Sun-Wada and
Wada, 2015 ; Zoncu et al., 2011 ).
V-ATPases have also been shown to directly associate with and regulate signaling
complexes in the Notch, Wnt, and mTOR pathways ( Cruciat et al., 2010 ; Pamarthy et al.,
2018 ; Sun-Wada and Wada, 2015 ; Zoncu et al., 2011 ). Plasma membrane
V-ATPases carry out extracellular acidification in specialized organs, which are
critical for bone resorption, sperm maturation and acid excretion by the kidney
( Forgac, 2007 ; McGuire et al., 2017 ). Increased V-ATPase expression and
relocation to the plasma membrane have been suggested as a mechanism for maintaining
an alkaline intracellular pH and an acidic extracellular pH to facilitate cancer
cell proliferation and metastasis ( Pamarthy et al.,
2018 ). Thus, malfunction of V-ATPases can cause numerous human diseases
including microbial infection, neurodegeneration, renal tubular acidosis,
osteoporosis, and cancer ( Hinton et al.,
2009 ; Pamarthy et al., 2018 ).

As a well-studied model, the yeast V-ATPase was shown to contain 31 subunits
that assemble into two structural modules: a cytoplasmic V 1 ATPase and a
membrane embedded V o proton pump ( Toei et
al., 2010 ; Zhao et al., 2015 ). The
V 1 ATPase is composed of three copies of subunits A, B, E, and G, and
one copy of subunit C, D, F, and H ( Zhao et al.,
2015 ), whereas the V o proton pump contains subunit a, c8,
c’, c’’, d, e, f, and V o a1 ( Mazhab-Jafari et al., 2016 ). Structures of complete S. cerevisiae and M. sexta V-ATPases have been
published at up to 6–7 Å resolution, and the S.
cerevisiae V 1 and V o subcomplexes have been
reconstructed to a high resolution of 3.5 Å ( Mazhab-Jafari et al., 2016 ; Rawson et
al., 2015 ; Roh et al., 2018 ; Zhao et al., 2015 ). During the preparation and
revision of our current manuscript, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of
V-ATPases purified from rat or bovine brains were reported at overall resolutions of
3.9 Å and 3.4 Å respectively, revealing the structural architecture of
mammalian V-ATPases ( Abbas et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2020 ). Previous structural studies
have provided insights into an elegant working mechanism of V-ATPases. In this
mechanism, ATP hydrolysis by the cytoplasmic V 1 ATPase drives the
rotation of the membrane embedded, ring-shaped V o proton pump to allow
cycles of protonation and deprotonation of lipid-exposed glutamic acid residues for
coupled proton transfer ( Abbas et al., 2020 ; Mazhab-Jafari et al., 2016 ; Rawson et al., 2015 ; Roh et al., 2018 ; Toei et
al., 2010 ; Zhao et al., 2015 ).
However, little is known about the assembly mechanism of V-ATPases and no structures
of human V-ATPases have been reported.

Here, we report cryo-EM structures of a human V-ATPase in three different
states at up to 3.1 Å resolution overall, with 2.9 Å for
focused-refined V 1 and 3.0 Å for focused-refined V o .
The cryo-EM maps allowed us to fit and build complete atomic models for almost all
subunits; in particular, they enabled the de novo tracing of the luminal domain of
ATP6AP1. In addition, we observed and built many N-linked glycans, glycolipids and
phospholipids. Based on our structural analysis, we propose a model for human
V-ATPase assembly, regulation and function, providing mechanistic insights into the
working principles of this fascinating molecular machine in higher organisms.

DISCUSSION

Our cryo-EM structures revealed important information about human V-ATPase
in the following respects ( Figure 6H ). First,
we de novo built the luminal domain of ATP6AP1, which despite lack of sequence
identity, shares structural homology to the LAMP family that comprises some of the
most abundant protein components of lysosomal membranes. Second, we discovered that
ATP6AP1 interacts with multiple subunits, as well as c-ring lipids, in the
V o complex, making it a hub for bringing subunits together for
assembly. Third, we identified important N-linked glycans on ATP6AP1 and other
V o subunits, as well as glycans from bound glycolipids (Dol-pp-G and
GM1). These glycans are implicated in V-ATPase assembly, localization and stability,
as well as in shielding V-ATPases from harmful lysosomal hydrolases. Fourth, we
identified ordered phospholipid and cholesterol molecules inside the c-ring, many of
which are stabilized by interactions with ATP6AP1 and may play vital roles in
assembly and regulation of V-ATPases.

Thus, V-ATPases are emerging to be bona fide glycoproteolipid complexes, and
our studies provided a platform for understanding the roles of glycans and lipids in
physiological functions of V-ATPases. Our studies also raised important insights
into the mechanism of V-ATPase biogenesis from the observation that ATP6AP1 is a
central hub for V-ATPase assembly. How the different subunits of V-ATPases
coordinate their assembly and function, and how V-ATPases can be targeted for
therapeutic intervention require further structural, biochemical and cell biological
investigations.
