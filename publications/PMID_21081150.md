BACKGROUND: BAD protein (Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death) belongs to the BH3-only 
subfamily of proapoptotic proteins and is proposed to function as the sentinel 
of the cellular health status. Physiological activity of BAD is regulated by 
phosphorylation, association with 14-3-3 proteins, binding to membrane lipids 
and pore formation. Since the functional role of the BAD C-terminal part has not 
been considered so far, we have investigated here the interplay of the structure 
and function of this region.
METHODS: The structure of the regulatory C-terminal part of human BAD was 
analyzed by CD spectroscopy. The channel-forming activity of full-length BAD and 
BAD peptides was carried out by lipid bilayer measurements. Interactions between 
proteins and peptides were monitored by the surface plasmon resonance technique. 
In aqueous solution, C-terminal part of BAD exhibits a well-ordered structure 
and stable conformation. In a lipid environment, the helical propensity 
considerably increases. The interaction of the C-terminal segment of BAD with 
the isolated BH3 domain results in the formation of permanently open pores 
whereby the phosphorylation of serine 118 within the BH3 domain is necessary for 
effective pore formation. In contrast, phosphorylation of serine 99 in 
combination with 14-3-3 association suppresses formation of channels. C-terminal 
part of BAD controls BAD function by structural transitions, lipid binding and 
phosphorylation. Conformational changes of this region upon membrane interaction 
in conjunction with phosphorylation of the BH3 domain suggest a novel mechanism 
for regulation of BAD.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Multiple signaling pathways mediate inhibition and 
activation of cell death via BAD.
