Intracellular protein synthesis, folding, and degradation are tightly controlled 
processes to ensure proper protein homeostasis. The proteasome is responsible 
for the degradation of the majority of intracellular proteins, which are often 
targeted for degradation via polyubiquitination. However, the degradation rate 
of proteins is also affected by the capacity of proteasomes to recognize and 
degrade these substrate proteins. This capacity is regulated by a variety of 
proteasome modulations including (1) changes in complex composition, (2) 
post-translational modifications, and (3) altered transcription of proteasomal 
subunits and activators. Various diseases are linked to proteasome modulation 
and altered proteasome function. A better understanding of these modulations may 
offer new perspectives for therapeutic intervention. Here we present an overview 
of these three proteasome modulating mechanisms to give better insight into the 
diversity of proteasomes.
