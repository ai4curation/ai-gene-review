Members of the Argonaute (Ago) protein family associate with small RNAs and have 
important roles in RNA silencing. Here, we analysed Ago1- and Ago2-containing 
protein complexes in human cells. Separation of Ago-associated messenger 
ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) showed that Ago1 and Ago2 reside in three complexes 
with distinct Dicer and RNA-induced silencing complex activities. A 
comprehensive proteomic analysis of Ago-containing mRNPs identified a large 
number of proteins involved in RNA metabolism. By using co-immunoprecipitation 
experiments followed by RNase treatment, we biochemically mapped interactions 
within Ago mRNPs. Using reporter assays and knockdown experiments, we showed 
that the putative RNA-binding protein RBM4 is required for microRNA-guided gene 
regulation.
