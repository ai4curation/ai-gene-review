NKG2D is an important immunosurveillance receptor that responds to 
stress-induced ligand expression on tumors and virus-infected cells. Human 
natural killer cells express NKG2D and require the transmembrane adaptor DAP10 
to initiate their full cytotoxic activation. However, DAP10 has no 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif and thus the mechanism of 
recruiting 'downstream' effector proteins is unclear. We show here that binding 
of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3- kinase to DAP10 could not by 
itself trigger cell-mediated cytotoxicity and that binding of an intermediate 
consisting of the DAP10 binding partner Grb2 and the effector molecule Vav1 
(Grb2-Vav1) to DAP10 was sufficient to initiate tyrosine-phosphorylation events. 
For full calcium release and cytotoxicity to occur, both Grb2-Vav1 and p85 had 
to bind to DAP10. These findings identify a previously unknown mechanism by 
which NKG2D-DAP10 mediates cytotoxicity and provides a framework for evaluating 
activation by other receptor complexes that lack immunoreceptor tyrosine-based 
activation motifs.
