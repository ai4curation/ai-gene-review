Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) catalyzes the first and 
rate-limiting step in glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis: the adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP)-dependent ligation of glutamate and cysteine. gamma-GCS consists of a 
catalytic (gamma-GCSH) and modifier (gamma-GCSL) subunit. Hereditary deficiency 
of gamma-GCS has been reported in a small number of patients and is associated 
with low erythrocyte levels of gamma-GCS and GSH leading to hemolytic anemia. 
Here we report a novel gamma-GCSH mutation, isolated from the cDNA of 2 related 
patients diagnosed with gamma-GCS deficiency. Each was found to be homozygous 
for a C>T missense mutation at nucleotide 379, encoding for a predicted 
Arg127Cys amino acid change. Computerized structure modeling identified that the 
mutated amino acid lies within a cleft on the protein surface of gamma-GCSH, and 
the border of this cleft was shown to contain Cys249, an evolutionarily 
conserved residue that has been proven to lie near the binding site of 
gamma-GCSH. Transfection studies showed that the mutation is associated with 
decreased GSH production, and binding studies using purified recombinant protein 
showed that the mutant protein has markedly decreased enzymatic activity 
compared to wild type.
