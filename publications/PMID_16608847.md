PUMA is a BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein that plays an essential role in DNA 
damage-induced apoptosis. PUMA interacts with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) 
and is dependent on Bax to induce apoptosis. In this study, we investigated how 
the interactions of PUMA with the antiapoptotic proteins coordinate with Bax to 
initiate apoptosis in HCT116 colon cancer cells. We found that Bcl-X(L) was most 
effective among several antiapoptotic proteins in suppressing PUMA-induced 
apoptosis and PUMA-dependent apoptosis induced by the DNA-damaging agent 
adriamycin. Mutant Bcl-X(L) that cannot interact with Bax was unable to protect 
cells from PUMA-mediated apoptosis. Knockdown of Bcl-X(L) by RNA interference 
significantly enhanced PUMA-mediated apoptosis in HCT116 cells but not in 
PUMA-knockout cells. Furthermore, Bax was found to be dissociated preferentially 
from Bcl-X(L) in HCT116 cells but not in the PUMA-knockout cells, in response to 
PUMA induction and adriamycin treatment. PUMA inhibited the association of Bax 
and Bcl-X(L) in vitro by directly binding to Bcl-X(L) through its BH3 domain. 
Finally, we found that wild-type Bax, but not mutant Bax deficient in either 
multimerization or mitochondrial localization, was able to restore PUMA-induced 
apoptosis in the BAX-knockout cells. Together, these results indicate that PUMA 
initiates apoptosis in part by dissociating Bax and Bcl-X(L), thereby promoting 
Bax multimerization and mitochondrial translocation.
