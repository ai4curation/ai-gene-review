Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a unique cytoplasmic deacetylase, likely plays a 
role in neurodegeneration by coordinating cell responses to abnormal protein 
aggregation. Here, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that HDAC6 interacts 
with tau, a microtubule-associated protein that forms neurofibrillary tangles in 
Alzheimer's disease. This interaction is mediated by the microtubule-binding 
domain on tau and the Ser/Glu tetradecapeptide domain on HDAC6. Treatment with 
tubacin, a selective inhibitor of tubulin deacetylation activity of HDAC6, did 
not disrupt HDAC6-tau interaction. Nonetheless tubacin treatment attenuated 
site-specific tau phosphorylation, as did shRNA-mediated knockdown of HDAC6. 
Proteasome inhibition potentiated HDAC6-tau interactions and facilitated the 
concentration and co-localization of HDAC6 and tau in a perinuclear 
aggresome-like compartment, independent of HDAC6 tubulin deacetylase activity. 
Furthermore, we observed that in Alzheimer's disease brains the protein level of 
HDAC6 was significantly increased. These findings establish HDAC6 as a 
tau-interacting protein and as a potential modulator of tau phosphorylation and 
accumulation.
