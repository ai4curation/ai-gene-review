In response to gestational high salt intake, BdkrB2-/- embryos acquire an 
aberrant renal phenotype mimicking renal dysplasia in humans. Genetic analysis 
identified p53 as a mediator of the renal dysplasia in salt-stressed BdkrB2-/- 
mice, acting partly via repression of terminal epithelial differentiation genes. 
The present study tested the hypothesis that inactivation of BdkrB2 predisposes 
the salt-stressed embryo to p53-mediated metanephric apoptosis. Newborn 
BdkrB2-/- pups exhibited hyperphosphorylation of metanephric p53 on serine 20 
(mouse serine 23), a modification known to increase p53 stability and apoptotic 
activity. As a result, there was widespread, ectopic expression of p53 in the 
BdkrB2-/- kidney. However, no differences were found in the apoptosis index or 
gene expression in BdkrB2-/- and +/+ kidneys, indicating that p53 stabilization 
as a result of BdkrB2 inactivation is not sufficient to induce metanephric 
apoptosis. On gestational salt stress, fulminant metanephric apoptosis and 
enhanced Bax gene expression occurred in BdkrB2-/- but not their +/- or +/+ 
littermates. Germline deletion of p53 from BdkrB2-/- mice prevented Bax 
activation and normalized the apoptosis index. Rescue of metanephric apoptosis 
in BdkrB2-/- mice was similarly achieved by Bax gene deletion. Aberrant 
apoptosis in salt-stressed BdkrB2-/- mice was triggered on embryonic day E15.5 
and involved both ureteric bud (UB) and metanephric mesenchyme-derived nephron 
elements. Cultured E12.5 salt-stressed BdkrB2-/- metanephroi manifested stunted 
UB branching compared with +/- and +/+ littermates; the abnormal UB branching 
was corrected by p53 deletion. Our results suggest a model whereby a seemingly 
silent genetic mutation of BdkrB2 predisposes mice to renal dysplasia by 
creating a "preapoptotic" state through p53 activation.
