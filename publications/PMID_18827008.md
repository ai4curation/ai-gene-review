Inappropriate regulation of the PI3-kinase/PTEN/Akt kinase-signalling cassette, 
a key downstream target of insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling (IIS), 
is associated with several major human diseases such as diabetes, obesity and 
cancer. In Drosophila, studies have recently revealed that different subcellular 
pools of activated, phosphorylated Akt can modulate different IIS-dependent 
processes. For example, a specific pool of activated Akt within the cytoplasm 
alters aspects of lipid metabolism, a process that is misregulated in both 
obesity and diabetes. However, it remains unclear how this pool is regulated. 
Here we show that the protein phosphatase PP2A-B' regulatory subunit Widerborst 
(Wdb), which coimmunoprecipitates with Akt in vivo, selectively modulates levels 
of activated Akt in the cytoplasm. It alters lipid droplet size and expression 
of the lipid storage perilipin-like protein LSD2 in the Drosophila ovary, but 
not in epithelial cells of the eye imaginal discs. We conclude that isoforms of 
PP2A-B' can act as subcellular-compartment-specific regulators of 
PI3-kinase/PTEN/Akt kinase signalling and IIS, potentially providing new targets 
for modulating individual subcellular pools of activated Akt in insulin-linked 
disease.
