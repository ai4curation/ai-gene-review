Pseudouridine (Ψ) is a post-transcriptional RNA modification that alters RNA-RNA 
and RNA-protein interactions that affect gene expression. Messenger RNA 
pseudouridylation was recently discovered as a widespread and conserved 
phenomenon, but the mechanisms responsible for selective, regulated 
pseudouridylation of specific sequences within mRNAs were unknown. Here, we have 
revealed mRNA targets for five pseudouridine synthases and probed the 
determinants of mRNA target recognition by the predominant mRNA 
pseudouridylating enzyme, Pus1, by developing high-throughput kinetic analysis 
of pseudouridylation in vitro. Combining computational prediction and rational 
mutational analysis revealed an RNA structural motif that is both necessary and 
sufficient for mRNA pseudouridylation. Applying this structural context 
information predicted hundreds of additional mRNA targets that were 
pseudouridylated in vivo. These results demonstrate a structure-dependent mode 
of mRNA target recognition by a conserved pseudouridine synthase and implicate 
modulation of RNA structure as the probable mechanism to regulate mRNA 
pseudouridylation.
