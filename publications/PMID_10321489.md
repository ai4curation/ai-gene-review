Over-expression of Bcl-2 is known to reduce the extent of retinal ganglion cell 
death during development as well as after axotomy. Here we investigated whether 
retinal ganglion cell (RGC) numbers are reduced in mice with a targeted 
inactivation of the bcl-2 gene. Compared with wild-type mice, adult bcl-2 null 
mutants have lost 29% of the retinal ganglion cell axons in the optic nerve. 
This reduction was almost fully established at P15, but not present at P10, 
which marks the end of the period of naturally occurring cell death. These 
observations, together with the previously reported late loss of primary 
motoneurons and peripheral neurons, point to a general physiological requirement 
for Bcl-2 soon after the period of naturally occurring cell death.
