Staphylococcus aureus is the principal causative agent of the inflammatory bone 
disease osteomyelitis. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of this often chronic 
infection is poorly understood and is complicated by the recent observation that 
bone-forming osteoblasts can harbor S. aureus. Such an infection presents a 
significant challenge for the host immune response, because osteoblasts are not 
known to initiate protective cell-mediated immune responses. Cultured mouse and 
human osteoblasts infected with S. aureus were found to express high levels of 
interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12p75, on the basis of complementary investigations 
demonstrating both S. aureus-induced up-regulation of expression of IL-6 and 
IL-12p40 mRNA and secretion of IL-6 and IL-12p75 by these cells. Additionally, a 
quantitative bioassay demonstrated that IL-12p75 secreted after infection was 
biologically active. These studies are the first to demonstrate induced IL-12p75 
expression by osteoblasts and suggest a previously unrecognized role for 
osteoblasts in initiating immune responses after S. aureus infection.
