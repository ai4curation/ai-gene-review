Mutations at the mouse Fused locus have pleiotropic developmental effects, 
including the formation of axial duplications in homozygous embryos. The product 
of the Fused locus, Axin, displays similarities to RGS (Regulators of G-Protein 
Signaling) and Dishevelled proteins. Mutant Fused alleles that cause axial 
duplications disrupt the major mRNA, suggesting that Axin negatively regulates 
the response to an axis-inducing signal. Injection of Axin mRNA into Xenopus 
embryos inhibits dorsal axis formation by interfering with signaling through the 
Wnt pathway. Furthermore, ventral injection of an Axin mRNA lacking the RGS 
domain induces an ectopic axis, apparently through a dominant-negative 
mechanism. Thus, Axin is a novel inhibitor of Wnt signaling and regulates an 
early step in embryonic axis formation in mammals and amphibians.
