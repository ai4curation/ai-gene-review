One of the most significant features of plant development is the way in which it 
can be elaborated and modulated throughout the life of the plant, an ability 
that is conferred by meristems. The Arabidopsis thaliana WUSCHEL gene (WUS), 
which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor, is required to maintain the

that it arises from a defect in the WUS orthologue ROSULATA (ROA). Detailed

Abstract

One of the most significant features of plant development is the way in which it can be elaborated and modulated throughout the life of the plant, an ability that is conferred by meristems. The Arabidopsis thaliana WUSCHEL gene ( WUS ), which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor, is required to maintain the stem cells in the shoot apical meristem in an undifferentiated state. The mechanism by which WUS prevents the differentiation of stem cells is unknown. We have characterized a meristem maintenance mutant in Antirrhinum majus and shown that it arises from a defect in the WUS orthologue ROSULATA ( ROA ). Detailed characterization of a semidominant roa allele revealed an essential role for the conserved C-terminal domain. Expression of either ROA or WUS lacking this domain causes a failure of meristem maintenance. The conserved domain mediates an interaction between WUS and two members of a small family of corepressor-like proteins in Arabidopsis . Our results suggest that WUS functions by recruiting transcriptional corepressors to repress target genes that promote differentiation, thereby ensuring stem cell maintenance.

INTRODUCTION

Unlike that in animals, most plant organogenesis takes place postembryonically, allowing plants to modify their development in response to the environment. The shoot apical meristem (SAM), located at the tip of the shoot, gives rise to all of the aboveground organs and tissues initiated after germination. The SAM has the ability to maintain an organized structure while responding to intrinsic and extrinsic developmental signals. To accomplish this, a constant pool of slowly dividing undifferentiated stem cells is maintained within the central zone of the SAM. Cells that leave the central zone enter the flanking peripheral zone and can be recruited into lateral organ primordia, where they begin to divide more rapidly and differentiate. Cells leaving the central zone to enter the underlying rib zone are incorporated into the pith tissue. In this dynamic environment, coordination between the rates of differentiation and proliferation critically depends on signaling between the different compartments of the SAM ( Clark, 2001 ).

The proliferation of stem cells within the SAM must be exactly matched to the rate at which daughter cells differentiate ( Baurle and Laux, 2003 ; Carles and Fletcher, 2003 ; Gross-Hardt and Laux, 2003 ). The mechanism of meristem maintenance and coordination has been studied extensively using a series of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants that show defects in meristem homeostasis ( Clark, 2001 ; Fletcher, 2002 ). Mutants in the CLAVATA genes ( CLV1 , CLV2 , and CLV3 ) result in an overproduction of stem cells and a breakdown in meristem organization. By contrast, mutants of the WUSCHEL gene ( WUS ) result in plants that are unable to maintain a pool of undifferentiated stem cells ( Laux et al., 1996 ). Cells expressing WUS define a new domain within the central zone, referred to as the SAM organizing center ( Schoof et al., 2000 ). WUS activity results in signaling to the overlying stem cells, inducing CLV3 , which then signals back to repress WUS . The CLV/WUS negative feedback loop ensures homeostasis of the SAM by regulating the number of stem cells present in the central zone ( Brand et al., 2000 ; Schoof et al., 2000 ). The stability of WUS expression also involves signaling from leaf primordia and tissue underlying the organizing center ( Stuurman et al., 2002 ). WUS encodes the founding member of the WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) subfamily of homeobox transcription factors, several of whose members have subsequently been shown to control aspects of plant development ( Matsumoto and Okada, 2001 ; Haecker et al., 2004 ; Nardmann et al., 2004 ; Park et al., 2005 ; Wu et al., 2005 ).

In addition to the homedomain, WUS contains three conserved short sequence motifs at the C-terminal end: an acidic domain, a WUS box (TLPLFPMH), and an EAR-like (for ERF-associated amphiphilic repression) domain (ASLELTLN) ( Ohta et al., 2001 ). The presence of the acidic domain is consistent with a function as a transcriptional activator. Although the function of the WUS box is unknown, EAR-like domains have been found to be involved in transcriptional repression ( Ohta et al., 2001 ; Hiratsu et al., 2004 ; Tiwari et al., 2004 ). At the end of flower development, WUS terminates stem cell maintenance, and this function involves the direct activation of the AGAMOUS ( AG ) gene together with LEAFY (LFY) ( Lenhard et al., 2001 ; Lohmann et al., 2001 ). However, the mechanism by which WUS represses the differentiation of stem cells is unknown.

The role of WUS in maintaining the SAM appears to have been evolutionarily conserved in angiosperms, because mutants in a related Petunia hybrida gene, TERMINATOR ( TER ), also result in analogous meristem termination ( Stuurman et al., 2002 ). Here, we report the characterization of an Antirrhinum majus mutant that displays an inability to maintain its apical meristems and show that it also results from defects in a WUS -like homeobox gene, ROSULATA ( ROA ). Analysis of the semidominant Antirrhinum roa-2 allele provides experimental evidence for the functional importance of conserved amino acid sequences in the C-terminal domain of WUS ( Stuurman et al., 2002 ; Haecker et al., 2004 ). Based on the Antirrhinum roa-2 allele, we recreated a dominant wus -like phenotype in Arabidopsis by expressing a truncated WUS protein lacking the conserved C-terminal domains. We have identified two WUS-interacting proteins (WSIP1 and WSIP2) that are members of a small family of transcriptional corepressor-like proteins in Arabidopsis and that depend on the presence of the conserved C-terminal domains for full interaction with WUS. Our results suggest that WUS acts to maintain the meristem by recruiting transcriptional corepressors to repress target genes required for differentiation.
