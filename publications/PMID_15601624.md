The Dbl-like guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) have been implicated in 
direct activation of the Rho family of small GTPases. We previously isolated 
transforming immortalized mammary (TIM) as a Dbl-like protein. Here, we show 
that, when expressed in cells, TIM was a potent activator of RhoA. Like 
activated Rho proteins, expression of TIM potentiated the serum response factor 
(SRF)- and AP-1-regualted transcriptional activities and activated the SAPK/JNK 
signaling pathway. In NIH 3T3 cells, TIM induced transforming foci, which was 
inhibited by the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 or the dominant negative mutants of Rho 
proteins. Expression of TIM led to pronounced changes in cell shape and 
organization of the actin cytoskeleton, including the formation of thick stress 
fibers at the cell periphery and cell rounding. TIM also promoted redistribution 
of vinculin-enriched focal adhesions at the cell periphery and increased the 
phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC). These results, taken together, 
suggest that TIM acts as an upstream regulator for the RhoA/ROCK-mediated 
cellular functions.
