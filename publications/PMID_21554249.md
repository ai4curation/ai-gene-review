Intracellular 14-3-3 proteins bind to many proteins, via a specific 
phosphoserine motif, regulating diverse cellular tasks including cell signalling 
and disease progression. The 14-3-3ζ isoform is a molecular chaperone, 
preventing the stress-induced aggregation of target proteins in a manner 
comparable with that of the unrelated sHsps (small heat-shock proteins). 1H-NMR 
spectroscopy revealed the presence of a flexible and unstructured C-terminal 
extension, 12 amino acids in length, which protrudes from the domain core of 
14-3-3ζ and is similar in structure and length to the C-terminal extension of 
mammalian sHsps. The extension stabilizes 14-3-3ζ, but has no direct role in 
chaperone action. Lys(49) is an important functional residue within the 
ligand-binding groove of 14-3-3ζ with K49E 14-3-3ζ exhibiting markedly reduced 
binding to phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated ligands. The R18 peptide binds 
to the binding groove of 14-3-3ζ with high affinity and also reduces the 
interaction of 14-3-3ζ ligands. However, neither the K49E mutation nor the 
presence of the R18 peptide affected the chaperone activity of 14-3-3ζ, implying 
that the C-terminal extension and binding groove of 14-3-3ζ do not mediate 
interaction with target proteins during chaperone action. Other region(s) in 
14-3-3ζ are most likely to be involved, i.e. the protein's chaperone and 
phosphoserine-binding activities are functionally and structurally separated.
