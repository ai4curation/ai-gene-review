OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether c-Myc regulates 
expression of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) on hypoxia-induced vascular 
smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).
METHODS: VSMCs were isolated from thoracic aorta of wild-type (WT), tissue 
plasminogen activator (tPA) and uPA-deficient mice. Gene and protein expression 
levels were examined by reverse-transcription PCR and Western blotting, 
respectively. c-Myc and uPA transcriptional activity were determined by 
luciferase analysis. Zymography analysis was used to test the activity of matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMPs), tPA, and uPA.
RESULTS: Hypoxia significantly promoted WT and tPA-/- VSMC migration and 
invasion. However, uPA-/- severely decreased hypoxia-induced VSMC migration and 
invasion. Hypoxia increased uPA and MMP-2 activity, while uPA-/- decreased 
hypoxia-induced MMP-2 activity. c-Myc expression and transcriptional activity 
were increased in response to hypoxia, and silenced c-Myc abolished 
hypoxia-induced uPA and MMP-2 activity. In addition, hypoxia-induced Bcl2 
expression and Bcl2 binding to c-Myc led to enhanced c-Myc-mediated uPA and 
MMP-2 activity in response to hypoxia.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that c-Myc was essential for hypoxia-induced uPA 
expression and activity, resulting in VSMC migration and invasion. In addition, 
Bcl2 enhanced the c-Myc-mediated uPA/MMP-2 pathway.
