In Arabidopsis thaliana, the etr1-2 mutation confers dominant ethylene 
insensitivity and results in a greater proportion of mature seeds that exhibit 
dormancy compared with mature seeds of the wild-type. We investigated the impact 
of the etr1-2 mutation on other plant hormones by analyzing the profiles of four 
classes of plant hormones and their metabolites by HPLC-ESI/MS/MS in mature 
seeds of wild-type and etr1-2 plants. Hormone metabolites were analyzed in seeds 
imbibed immediately under germination conditions, in seeds subjected to a 7-day 
moist-chilling (stratification) period, and during germination/early 
post-germinative growth. Higher than wild-type levels of abscisic acid (ABA) 
appeared to contribute, at least in part, to the greater incidence of dormancy 
in mature seeds of etr1-2. The lower levels of abscisic acid glucose ester 
(ABA-GE) in etr1-2 seeds compared with wild-type seeds under germination 
conditions (with and without moist-chilling treatments) suggest that reduced 
metabolism of ABA to ABA-GE likely contributed to the accumulation of ABA during 
germination in the mutant. The mutant seeds exhibited generally higher auxin 
levels and a large build-up of indole-3-aspartate when placed in germination 
conditions following moist-chilling. The mutant manifested increased levels of 
cytokinin glucosides through zeatin-O-glucosylation (Z-O-Glu). The resulting 
increase in Z-O-Glu was the largest and most consistent change associated with 
the ETR1 gene mutation. There were more gibberellins (GA) and at higher 
concentrations in the mutant than in wild-type. Our results suggest that 
ethylene signaling modulates the metabolism of all the other plant hormone 
pathways in seeds. Additionally, the hormone profiles of etr1-2 seed during 
germination suggest a requirement for higher than wild-type levels of GA to 
promote germination in the absence of a functional ethylene signaling pathway.
