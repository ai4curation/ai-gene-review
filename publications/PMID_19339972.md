CRM1 (or exportin 1, Xpo1) transports proteins out of the cell nucleus through 
the nuclear pore complex. In the cytoplasm, GTP hydrolysis and consequent 
dissociation of Ran from CRM1 releases low-affinity substrates, while additional 
factors facilitate release of high-affinity substrates. Here we provide a model 
for human CRM1 export complex assembly and disassembly through structural and 
biochemical analyses of CRM1 bound to the substrate snurportin 1 (SNUPN, also 
called snuportin 1).
