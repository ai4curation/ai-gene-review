Phocein, an intracellular protein interacting with striatin, bears a few 
homologies with the sigma-subunits of clathrin adaptor proteins (Baillat, G., 
Moqrich, A., Castets, F., Baude, A., Bailly, Y., Benmerah, A., and Monneron, A. 
(2001) Mol. Biol. Cell 12, 663-673). Using phocein as a bait in a yeast 
two-hybrid screen, we identified two novel interacting proteins, 
nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDPK) and Eps15. Immunoprecipitation and 
pull-down experiments involving native and/or recombinant phocein and, 
respectively, NDPK and Eps15, biochemically validated their interactions. NDPK 
and Eps15 were recently shown to be functional neighbors of dynamin. Dynamin I 
is shown here to directly interact with NDPK through its C-terminal proline-rich 
domain, whereas recombinant phocein associates with native dynamin I. 
Immunocytochemical studies of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons demonstrated 
partial co-localization of phocein and dynamin I. Phocein thus appears to be a 
component of the complexes involved in some steps of the vesicular traffic 
machinery.
