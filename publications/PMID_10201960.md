The transmigration and adherence of T lymphocytes through microvascular 
endothelium are essential events for their recruitment into inflammatory sites. 
In the present study, we investigated the expression of CC chemokine receptor 
CCR3 on T lymphocytes and the capacities of the CC chemokine eotaxin to induce 
chemotaxis and adhesion in T lymphocytes. We have observed a novel phenomenon 
that IL-2 and IL-4 induce the expression of CCR3 on T lymphocytes. We also 
report that CC chemokine eotaxin is a potent chemoattractant for IL-2- and 
IL-4-stimulated T lymphocytes, but not for freshly isolated T lymphocytes. 
Eotaxin attracts T lymphocytes via CCR3, documented by the fact that anti-CCR3 
mAb blocks eotaxin-mediated T lymphocyte chemotaxis. In combination with IL-2 
and IL-4, eotaxin enhances the expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 
and several integrins (CD29, CD49a, and CD49b) on T lymphocytes and thus 
promotes adhesion and aggregation of T lymphocytes. The eotaxin-induced T 
lymphocyte adhesion could be selectively blocked by a specific cAMP-dependent 
protein kinase inhibitor, H-89, indicating that eotaxin activates T lymphocytes 
via a special cAMP-signaling pathway. Our new findings all point toward the fact 
that eotaxin, in association with the Th1-derived cytokine IL-2 and the 
Th2-derived cytokine IL-4, is an important T lymphocyte activator, stimulating 
the directional migration, adhesion, accumulation, and recruitment of T 
lymphocytes, and paralleled the accumulation of eosinophils and basophils during 
the process of certain types of inflammation such as allergy.
