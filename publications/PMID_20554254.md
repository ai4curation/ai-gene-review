Replicative DNA polymerases duplicate genomes in a very efficient and accurate 
mode. However their progression can be blocked by DNA lesions since they are 
unable to accommodate bulky damaged bases in their active site. In response to 
replication blockage, monoubiquitination of PCNA promotes the switch between 
replicative and specialized polymerases proficient to overcome the obstacle. In 
this study, we characterize novel connections between proteins involved in 
replication and TransLesion Synthesis (TLS). We demonstrate that PDIP38 
(Poldelta interacting protein of 38kDa) directly interacts with the TLS 
polymerase Poleta. Interestingly, the region of Poleta interacting with PDIP38 
is found to be located within the ubiquitin-binding zinc finger domain (UBZ) of 
Poleta. We show that the depletion of PDIP38 increases the number of cells with 
Poleta foci in the absence of DNA damage and diminishes cell survival after UV 
irradiation. In addition, PDIP38 is able to interact directly not only with 
Poleta but also with the specialized polymerases Rev1 and Polzeta (via Rev7). We 
thus suggest that PDIP38 serves as a mediator protein helping TLS Pols to 
transiently replace replicative polymerases at damaged sites.
