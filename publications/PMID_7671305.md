We have identified a target antigen in autoimmune cerebellar degeneration, 
beta-NAP, that is closely related to the beta-adaptin and beta-COP coat 
proteins. Beta-NAP is a nonclathrin-associated phosphoprotein expressed 
exclusively in neurons, from E12 through adulthood. Beta-NAP is present in the 
neuronal soma and nerve terminal as soluble and membrane-bound pools and is 
associated with a discrete set of nerve-terminal vesicles. These results 
establish beta-NAP as a neuron-specific vesicle coat protein. We propose a model 
in which beta-NAP mediates vesicle transport between the soma and the axon 
terminus and suggest that beta-NAP may represent a general class of coat 
proteins that mediates apical transport in polarized cells.
