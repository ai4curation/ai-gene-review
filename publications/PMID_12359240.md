We have identified and characterized the novel human transmembrane protein 9 
(TMEM9). TMEM9 encodes a 183 amino-acid protein that contains an N-terminal 
signal peptide, a single transmembrane region, three potential N-glycosylation 
sites, and three conserved cys-rich domains in the N-terminus, but no hitherto 
known functional domains. The protein is highly conserved between species from 
Caenorhabditis elegans to man and belongs to a novel family of transmembrane 
proteins. The TMEM9 gene consists of at least 6 exons and is localized to 
chromosome 1q41. TMEM9 mRNA is expressed in a wide range of tissues and cells. 
COS-1 cells transfected with a TMEM9 expression plasmid gave three bands of 
about 28, 31, and 33kDa representing glycosylated forms of TMEM9 with a protein 
backbone of about 26kDa. In COS-1 cells transfected with a TMEM9-GFP expression 
construct,TMEM9-GFP is co-expressed with LAMP1 on late endosomes and lysosomes 
as well as on ER. Thus, TMEM9 is a phylogenetically conserved, widely expressed 
transmembrane protein with a potential, but unknown function in intracellular 
transport.
