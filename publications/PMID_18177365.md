In Pseudomonas putida U two different pathways (Pea, Ped) are required for the 
conversion of 2-phenylethylamine and 2-phenylethanol into phenylacetic acid. The 
2-phenylethylamine pathway (PeaABCDEFGHR) catalyses the transport of this amine, 
its deamination to phenylacetaldehyde by a quinohaemoprotein amine dehydrogenase 
and the oxidation of this compound through a reaction catalysed by a 
phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Another catabolic route 
(PedS(1)R(1)ABCS(2)R(2)DEFGHI) is needed for the uptake of 2-phenylethanol and 
for its oxidation to phenylacetic acid via phenylacetaldehyde. This implies the 
participation of two different two-component signal-transducing systems, two 
quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenases, a cytochrome c, a periplasmic binding 
protein, an aldehyde dehydrogenase, a pentapeptide repeat protein and an ABC 
efflux system. Additionally, two accessory sets of elements (PqqABCDEF and 
CcmABCDEFGHI) are necessary for the operation of the main pathways (Pea and 
Ped). PqqABCDEF is required for the biosynthesis of pyrroloquinoline quinone 
(PQQ), a prosthetic group of certain alcohol dehydrogenases that transfers 
electrons to an independent cytochrome c; whereas CcmABCDEFGHI is required for 
cytochrome c maturation. Our data show that the degradation of phenylethylamine 
and phenylethanol in P. putida U is quite different from that reported in 
Escherichia coli, and they demonstrate that PeaABCDEFGHR and 
PedS(1)R(1)ABCS(2)R(2)DEFGHI are two upper routes belonging to the 
phenylacetyl-CoA catabolon.
