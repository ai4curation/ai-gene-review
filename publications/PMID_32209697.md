The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endocytosis of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) 
is an essential step in the production of interferon-β (IFN-β), which activates 
the transcription of antiviral response genes by STAT1 phosphorylated at Tyr701 
Here, we showed that STAT1 regulated proinflammatory cytokine production 
downstream of TLR4 endocytosis independently of IFN-β signaling and the key 
proinflammatory regulator NF-κB. In human macrophages, TLR4 endocytosis 
activated a noncanonical phosphorylation of STAT1 at Thr749, which subsequently 
promoted the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-12p40 through distinct 
mechanisms. STAT1 phosphorylated at Thr749 activated the expression of the gene 
encoding ARID5A, which stabilizes IL6 mRNA. Moreover, STAT1 phosphorylated at 
Thr749 directly enhanced transcription of the gene encoding IL-12p40 (IL12B). 
Instead of affecting STAT1 nuclear translocation, phosphorylation of Thr749 
facilitated the binding of STAT1 to a noncanonical DNA motif (5'-TTTGANNC-3') in 
the promoter regions of ARID5A and IL12B The endocytosis of TLR4 induced the 
formation of a complex between the kinases TBK1 and IKKβ, which mediated the 
phosphorylation of STAT1 at Thr749 Our data suggest that noncanonical 
phosphorylation in response to LPS confers STAT1 with distinct DNA binding and 
gene-regulatory properties that promote both IL12B expression and IL6 mRNA 
stabilization. Thus, our study provides a potential mechanism for how TLR4 
endocytosis might regulate proinflammatory cytokine production.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling is central to immune regulation and tissue homeostasis, yet how its activation enables cells to distinguish between different inflammatory cues remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized layer of STAT1 signaling modularity via threonine 748 phosphorylation, allowing intestinal epithelial cells to adaptively interpret structural damage versus cytokine signals. These findings expand the current understanding of STAT biology beyond the binary framework of the classical Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT pathway, redefining it as modular and tunable. This perspective offers a more dynamic model of cytokine specificity and cellular decision-making in complex inflammatory environments, potentially guiding development of targeted therapies that preserve epithelial integrity while minimizing immunopathology associated with cytokine-based treatments.

Barrier tissues such as the intestine are constantly challenged by environmental stressors and must adapt to maintain integrity and prevent excessive inflammation. Although traditionally viewed as a proinflammatory effector of interferon (IFN) signaling, STAT1 is shown here to play a protective role in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) by promoting resilience to damage and restraining IFN-induced cytotoxicity. We identify phosphorylation of threonine 748 (Thr748) on STAT1 as an evolutionarily selected adaptation—highly conserved between humans and mice—that reciprocally regulates IEC integrity and IFN responsiveness. Mice expressing a phospho-deficient T748A Stat1 mutant exhibit severe colitis-induced tissue damage comparable to Stat1-deficient littermates, underscoring the critical role of Thr748 phosphorylation in mediating Stat1-driven protection during intestinal inflammation. Bone marrow transfer experiments further demonstrate that this protective effect is nonhematopoietic. Integrated genomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal that Thr748 phosphorylation modulates STAT1 DNA binding, directly activates the Itgb4 promoter, and enhances integrin β4 expression in IEC following inflammation. In intestinal organoid models, gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that Thr748 phosphorylation drives integrin β4 expression and epithelial resilience independently of IFN-induced Tyrosine 701 (Tyr701) phosphorylation. In contrast, IFN stimulation via Tyr701 induces Zbp1—a cytotoxic nucleic acid sensor—while repressing integrin β4, resulting in epithelial injury that is mitigated by Thr748 phosphorylation. Together, these findings reveal a modular architecture of STAT1 signaling in which Thr748 phosphorylation functions as a molecular rheostat that safeguards epithelial integrity while tempering IFN-driven cytotoxic responses.
