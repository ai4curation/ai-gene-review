The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endocytosis of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) 
is an essential step in the production of interferon-β (IFN-β), which activates 
the transcription of antiviral response genes by STAT1 phosphorylated at Tyr701 
Here, we showed that STAT1 regulated proinflammatory cytokine production 
downstream of TLR4 endocytosis independently of IFN-β signaling and the key 
proinflammatory regulator NF-κB. In human macrophages, TLR4 endocytosis 
activated a noncanonical phosphorylation of STAT1 at Thr749, which subsequently 
promoted the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-12p40 through distinct 
mechanisms. STAT1 phosphorylated at Thr749 activated the expression of the gene 
encoding ARID5A, which stabilizes IL6 mRNA. Moreover, STAT1 phosphorylated at 
Thr749 directly enhanced transcription of the gene encoding IL-12p40 (IL12B). 
Instead of affecting STAT1 nuclear translocation, phosphorylation of Thr749 
facilitated the binding of STAT1 to a noncanonical DNA motif (5'-TTTGANNC-3') in 
the promoter regions of ARID5A and IL12B The endocytosis of TLR4 induced the 
formation of a complex between the kinases TBK1 and IKKβ, which mediated the 
phosphorylation of STAT1 at Thr749 Our data suggest that noncanonical 
phosphorylation in response to LPS confers STAT1 with distinct DNA binding and 
gene-regulatory properties that promote both IL12B expression and IL6 mRNA 
stabilization. Thus, our study provides a potential mechanism for how TLR4 
endocytosis might regulate proinflammatory cytokine production.
