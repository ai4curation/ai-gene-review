The melanocortin receptor (MCR) subtype family is a member of the GPCR 
superfamily, and each of them has a different pharmacological profile with 
regard to the relative potency of the endogenous and synthetic melanocortin 
peptides. Alpha-MSH and ACTH are endogenous nonselective agonists for MC1R, 
MC3R, MC4R, and MC5R. In this study, we examined the role of Phe(7) in ACTH on 
human (h) MC1R, MC3R, and MC4R binding and signaling. Our results indicate that 
substitution of Phe(7) with d-Nal(2')(7) in ACTH1-24 yields a pharmacological 
profile different from that for substitution of Phe(7) with d-Nal(2')(7) in MSH 
in hMC1R, hMC3R, and hMC4R. N-d-Nal(2')(7)-ACTH1-24 is an agonist at hMC3R and 
hMC4R which did not change the peptide from an agonist to an antagonist at hMC3R 
and hMC4R. Further experiments indicate that N-d-Nal(2')(7)-ACTH1-17 is the 
minimal peptide required for hMC3R and hMC4R activation. Single-amino acid 
substitution studies of d-Nal(2')(7)-ACTH1-17 indicate that amino acid residues 
15-17 in N-d-Nal(2')(7)-ACTH1-17 are crucial for hMC3R and hMC4R activation. 
Substitutions of these amino acid residues reduced or abolished agonist activity 
at hMC3R and hMC4R. Conformational studies revealed a new beta-turn 
(Arg(8)-Trp(9)-Gly(10)-Lys(11)) in N-d-Nal(2')(7)-ACTH1-17, compared to the 
beta-turn-like structure at NDP-alpha-MSH (His(6)-d-Phe(7)-Arg(8)-Trp(9)). Our 
results suggest that NDP-alpha-MSH and N-d-Nal(2')(7)-ACTH1-17 do not share the 
same binding site; the highly basic C-terminal fragment 
(Lys(15)-Lys(16)-Arg(17)) of N-d-Nal(2')(7)-ACTH1-17 induced a new beta-turn, 
and this shift contributed the selective agonist activity at hMC3R and hMC4R.
