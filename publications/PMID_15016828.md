Recent evidence supports a role for GATA transcription factors as important 
signal intermediates in differentiated endothelial cells. The goal of this study 
was to identify proteins that interact with endothelial-derived GATA 
transcription factors. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified 
hematopoietically expressed homeobox (Hex) as a GATA-binding partner in 
endothelial cells. The physical association between Hex and GATA was confirmed 
with immunoprecipitation in cultured cells. Hex overexpression resulted in 
decreased flk-1/KDR expression, both at the level of the promoter and the 
endogenous gene, and attenuated vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated tube 
formation in primary endothelial cell cultures. In electrophoretic mobility 
shift assays, Hex inhibited the binding of GATA-2 to the flk-1/KDR 
5'-untranslated region GATA motif. Finally, in RNase protection assays, 
transforming growth factor beta1, which has been previously shown to decrease 
flk-1 expression by interfering with GATA binding activity, was shown to 
increase Hex expression in endothelial cells. Taken together, the present study 
provides evidence for a novel association between Hex and GATA and suggests that 
transforming growth factor beta-mediated repression of flk-1/KDR and vascular 
endothelial growth factor signaling involves the inducible formation of 
inhibitory Hex-GATA complexes.
