Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disorder of movement, cognition, and emotion, and 
it is characterized pathologically by neuronal degeneration with Lewy bodies, 
which are cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing deposits of aggregated 
proteins. Most PD cases appear to be sporadic, but genetic forms of the disease, 
caused by mutations in alpha-synuclein, parkin, and other genes, have helped 
elucidate pathogenesis. Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause 
autosomal-dominant Parkinsonism with clinical features of PD and with 
pleomorphic pathology including deposits of aggregated protein. To study 
expression and interactions of LRRK2, we synthesized cDNAs and generated 
expression constructs coding for human WT and mutant LRRK2 proteins. Expression 
of full-length LRRK2 in cells in culture suggests that the protein is 
predominately cytoplasmic, as is endogenous protein by subcellular 
fractionation. Using coimmunoprecipitation, we find that LRRK2, expressed in 
cells in culture, interacts with parkin but not with alpha-synuclein, DJ-1, or 
tau. A small proportion of the cells overexpressing LRRK2 contain protein 
aggregates, and this proportion is greatly increased by coexpression of parkin. 
In addition, parkin increases ubiquitination of aggregated protein. Also, mutant 
LRRK2 causes neuronal degeneration in both SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons. 
This cell model may be useful for studies of PD cellular pathogenesis and 
therapeutics. These findings suggest a gain-of-function mechanism in the 
pathogenesis of LRRK2-linked PD and suggest that LRRK2 may be involved in a 
pathogenic pathway with other PD-related proteins such as parkin, which may help 
illuminate both familial and sporadic PD.
