The breast cancer susceptibility protein, BRCA2, is essential for 
recombinational DNA repair. BRCA2 delivers RAD51 to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) 
breaks through interaction with eight conserved, approximately 35 amino acid 
motifs, the BRC repeats. Here we show that the solitary BRC4 promotes assembly 
of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), but not dsDNA, to stimulate DNA 
strand exchange. BRC4 acts by blocking ATP hydrolysis and thereby maintaining 
the active ATP-bound form of the RAD51-ssDNA filament. Single-molecule 
visualization shows that BRC4 does not disassemble RAD51-dsDNA filaments but 
rather blocks nucleation of RAD51 onto dsDNA. Furthermore, this behavior is 
manifested by a domain of BRCA2 comprising all eight BRC repeats. These results 
establish that the BRC repeats modulate RAD51-DNA interaction in two opposing 
but functionally reinforcing ways: targeting active RAD51 to ssDNA and 
prohibiting RAD51 nucleation onto dsDNA. Thus, BRCA2 recruits RAD51 to DNA 
breaks and, we propose, the BRC repeats regulate DNA-binding selectivity.

The breast cancer susceptibility protein, BRCA2, is essential for recombinational DNA repair. BRCA2 delivers RAD51 to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks through interaction with eight conserved, ~35 amino acid motifs, the BRC repeats. Here we show that the solitary BRC4 promotes assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), but not dsDNA, to stimulate DNA strand exchange. BRC4 acts by blocking ATP hydrolysis and thereby maintaining the active ATP-bound form of the RAD51-ssDNA filament. Single-molecule visualization shows that BRC4 does not disassemble RAD51-dsDNA filaments, but rather blocks nucleation of RAD51 onto dsDNA. Furthermore, this behavior is manifest by a domain of BRCA2 comprising all eight BRC repeats. These results establish that the BRC repeats modulate RAD51-DNA interaction in two opposing, but functionally reinforcing ways: targeting active RAD51 to ssDNA and prohibiting RAD51 nucleation onto dsDNA. Thus, BRCA2 recruits RAD51 to DNA breaks and, we propose, the BRC repeats regulate DNA binding selectivity.
