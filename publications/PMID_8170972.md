Mice carrying ablated coding regions of the bcl-2 alpha and bcl-2 beta 
transcripts have been made. bcl-2-/- mutants are smaller but viable, although 
about half of them die by 6 weeks of age. As shown earlier with somatic bcl-2 
gene-targeted mice, the number of lymphocytes markedly decreased within few 
weeks after birth while other hematopoietic lineages remained unaffected. Among 
lymphocytes, CD8+ T cells disappeared most quickly followed by CD4+ T cells, 
whereas B cells were least affected. bcl-2-/- lymphocytes, however, could 
respond normally to various stimuli including anti-CD3, Con A, phorbol 
12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin, interleukin 2, lipopolysaccharide, and 
anti-IgM antibody. Abnormalities among nonlymphoid organs include smaller 
auricles, hair color turning gray at 4-5 weeks of age, and polycystic kidney 
disease-like change of renal tubules. These results suggest that Bcl-2 may be 
involved during morphogenesis where inductive interactions between epithelium 
and mesenchyme are important such as in the kidneys, hair follicles, and 
perichondrium of auricles. Surprisingly, the nervous system, intestines, and 
skin appear normal despite the fact that these organs show high levels of 
endogenous Bcl-2 expression in normal mice.
