Little is known about the mechanism by which embryonic liver, lung, and pancreas 
progenitor cells emerge from the endodermal epithelium to initiate 
organogenesis. Understanding this process and its genetic control provides 
insight into ontogeny, developmental abnormalities, and tissue regeneration. We 
find that shortly after hepatic endoderm cells are specified, they undergo a 
transition from a columnar, gut morphology to a pseudostratified morphology, 
with concomitant "interkinetic nuclear migration" (INM) during cell division. 
INM is a hallmark of pseudostratified epithelia and the process used by neural 
progenitors to emerge from the neural epithelium. We find that the transition of 
the hepatic endoderm, but not the neural epithelium, to a pseudostratified 
epithelium is dependent upon the cell-autonomous activity of the homeobox gene 
Hex. In the absence of Hex, hepatic endoderm cells survive but maintain a 
columnar, simple epithelial phenotype and ectopically express Shh and other 
genes characteristic of the midgut epithelium. Thus, Hex promotes endoderm 
organogenesis by promoting the transition to a pseudostratified epithelium, 
which in turn allows hepatoblasts to emerge into the stromal environment and 
continue differentiating.
