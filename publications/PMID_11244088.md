Nerve growth factor (NGF) binding to both p75 and TrkA neurotrophin receptors 
activates the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Here we 
show that the atypical protein kinase C-interacting protein, p62, which binds 
TRAF6, selectively interacts with TrkA but not p75. In contrast, TRAF6 interacts 
with p75 but not TrkA. We demonstrate the formation of a TRAF6-p62 complex that 
serves as a bridge linking both p75 and TrkA signaling. Of functional relevance, 
transfection of antisense p62-enhanced p75-mediated cell death and diminished 
NGF-induced differentiation occur through a mechanism involving inhibition of 
IKK activity. These findings reveal a new function for p62 as a common platform 
for communication of both p75-TRAF6 and TrkA signals. Moreover, we demonstrated 
that p62 serves as a scaffold for activation of the NF-kappaB pathway, which 
mediates NGF survival and differentiation responses.
