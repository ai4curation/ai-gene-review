Escherichia coli and Gram-negative bacteria that live in the human gut must be 
able to tolerate rapid and large changes in environmental pH. Low pH 
irreversibly denatures and precipitates many bacterial proteins. While 
cytoplasmic proteins are well buffered against such swings, periplasmic proteins 
are not. Instead, it appears that some bacteria utilize chaperone proteins that 
stabilize periplasmic proteins, preventing their precipitation. Two highly 
expressed and related proteins, HdeA and HdeB, have been identified as 
acid-activated chaperones. The structure of HdeA is known and a mechanism for 
activation has been proposed. In this model, dimeric HdeA dissociates at low pH, 
and the exposed dimeric interface binds exposed hydrophobic surfaces of 
acid-denatured proteins, preventing their irreversible aggregation. We now 
report the structure and biophysical characterization of the HdeB protein. The 
monomer of HdeB shares a similar structure with HdeA, but its dimeric interface 
is different in composition and spatial location. We have used fluorescence to 
study the behavior of HdeB as pH is lowered, and like HdeA, it dissociates to 
monomers. We have identified one of the key intersubunit interactions that 
controls pH-induced monomerization. Our analysis identifies a structural 
interaction within the HdeB monomer that is disrupted as pH is lowered, leading 
to enhanced structural flexibility.
