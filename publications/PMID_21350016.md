The mammalian kidney is composed of thousands of individual epithelial tubules 
known as nephrons. Deficits in nephron number are associated with myriad 
diseases ranging from complete organ failure to congenital hypertension. A 
balance between differentiation and maintenance of a mesenchymal progenitor cell 
population determines the final number of nephrons. How this balance is struck 
is poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested that Wnt9b/β-catenin 
signaling induced differentiation (mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition) in a 
subset of the progenitors but needed to be repressed in the remaining 
progenitors to keep them in the undifferentiated state. Here, we report that 
Wnt9b/β-catenin signaling is active in the progenitors and is required for their 
renewal/proliferation. Using a combination of approaches, we have revealed a 
mechanism through which cells receiving the same Wnt9b/β-catenin signal can 
respond in distinct ways (proliferate versus differentiate) depending on the 
cellular environment in which the signal is received. Interpretation of the 
signal is dependent, at least in part, on the activity of the transcription 
factor Six2. Six2-positive cells that receive the Wnt9b signal are maintained as 
progenitors whereas cells with reduced levels of Six2 are induced to 
differentiate by Wnt9b. Using this simple mechanism, the kidney is able to 
balance progenitor cell expansion and differentiation insuring proper nephron 
endowment. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms 
that regulate progenitor cell differentiation during normal and pathological 
conditions.

The mammalian kidney is composed of thousands of individual epithelial tubules known as nephrons. Deficits in nephron number are associated with myriad diseases ranging from complete organ failure to congenital hypertension. A balance between differentiation and maintenance of a mesenchymal progenitor cell population determines the final number of nephrons. How this balance is struck is poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested that Wnt9b/β-catenin signaling induced differentiation (mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition) in a subset of the progenitors but needed to be repressed in the remaining progenitors to keep them in the undifferentiated state.

Using this simple mechanism, the kidney is able to balance progenitor cell expansion and differentiation insuring proper nephron endowment. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate progenitor cell differentiation during normal and pathological conditions.

INTRODUCTION

During organogenesis, a balance must be struck between progenitor cell proliferation/renewal and differentiation to ensure proper organ size. The precarious nature of this equilibrium is particularly evident in the developing metanephric kidney. During development, signals from the ureteric bud epithelium stimulate the survival, proliferation and differentiation of an adjacent population of progenitor cells known as the metanephric mesenchyme. In addition, a bud-derived signal(s) causes a subset of the progenitors to differentiate into an epithelial structure known as a renal vesicle. The renal vesicle will undergo significant morphogenesis to form a nephron, a vascularized tubule that maintains blood chemistry. As a result of these inductive interactions, each mouse kidney will form up to 20,000 nephrons [~1,000,000 in an adult human ( Hoy et al., 2003 ; Keller et al., 2003 ; Nyengaard and Bendtsen, 1992 )] all derived from an initial progenitor population of approximately 12,000 cells ( Kobayashi et al., 2008 ).

An essential step in kidney development is establishment of a balance between the expansion and differentiation of the nephron progenitor cell population. Tipping this balance in favor of one or the other results in a reduction in nephron endowment and can have dire consequences, including the formation of progenitor cell cancers (Wilms' tumors), renal hypoplasia, chronic hypertension and kidney failure ( Keller et al., 2003 ; Koesters et al., 2003 ; Koesters et al., 1999 ; Li et al., 2004 ). Although several factors regulating progenitor cell expansion and differentiation have been identified ( Barasch et al., 1999 ; Blank et al., 2009 ; Carroll et al., 2005 ; Dudley et al., 1995 ; Grieshammer et al., 2005 ; Perantoni et al., 2005 ; Schmidt-Ott et al., 2007 ; Stark et al., 1994 ), it remains unclear how the balance between these two events is controlled.

Nephron induction requires the sequential activity of two Wnts: Wnt9b and Wnt4 ( Carroll et al., 2005 ; Stark et al., 1994 ). Wnt9b is secreted from the ureteric bud and induces a subset of the renal progenitor cells to aggregate and express Wnt4. Wnt4, by signaling through the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, further induces these pre-tubular aggregates (PTAs) to transition into epithelial structures known as renal vesicles (RVs) ( Park et al., 2007 ). Although the molecular nature of the Wnt4 signal has been determined, the pathway used by Wnt9b is still uncertain, although it has been suggested that it also signals through β-catenin ( Park et al., 2007 ).

Wnt4 , and other characterized Wnt9b targets such as Pax8 and Fgf8 , are expressed in only a small proportion of the progenitor cells (those undergoing differentiation), while the remaining ‘uninduced’ progenitors do not express these genes. This observation, and others, has led to a model suggesting that the Wnt9b signal is not active in the renewing progenitor cells, which keeps them from differentiating. How Wnt9b signaling is repressed in these cells is unclear, although one hypothesis, that has some experimental support, suggests that the transcription factor Six2 blocks the ability of cells to receive the Wnt9b signal. Six2 is expressed in the renewing progenitors and its loss results in the precocious differentiation of the entire progenitor population in a Wnt9b-dependent manner ( Kobayashi et al., 2008 ; Self et al., 2006 ). How Six2 affects Wnt9b activity is unclear.

In this study, we have identified several novel targets of Wnt9b. Our data suggest that, contrary to current models, Wnt9b/β-catenin signaling is active in both the differentiating and renewing progenitor cells. We provide evidence that, rather than inhibiting Wnt9b, Six2 appears to cooperate with it to promote progenitor cell proliferation. Based on our results, we propose a model whereby Wnt9b is the key factor that regulates the balance between progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. In the renewing progenitor cells, Wnt9b/β-catenin cooperates with Six2 to elicit progenitor cell expansion. In cells where Six2 activity is low or absent, Wnt9b/β-catenin promotes differentiation. These results modify our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate progenitor cell expansion and differentiation during normal and abnormal kidney development.

Ablation of Wnt9b results in premature exhaustion of the progenitor cells

Wnt9b is expressed in mouse ureteric bud/collecting ducts through the embryonic period and into adult stages ( Karner et al., 2009 ). However, despite continued presence of active Wnt9b ligand, renal tubule formation ceases by postnatal (P) day 5 ( Hartman et al., 2007 ). For most of the developmental period, progenitor cell renewal outpaces differentiation. However, around P3, the rate of progenitor cell expansion decreases, and by P5, the progenitor

population is exhausted after a wave of differentiation ( Hartman et al., 2007 ). A reasonable hypothesis based on the data presented in this study is that a loss in ability of the progenitor cells to respond to Wnt9b may play a causal role in the failure of progenitor cells to self-renew postnatally.

To test this hypothesis, we compared the expression of Wnt9b target genes to the progenitor expression of Six2 in wild-type mice from P3 to P4. As expected, Six2 mRNA and protein were present in P3 kidneys, although the progenitor expression is reduced and, in some cases, Six2 appeared to be only expressed in the PTAs (see Fig. S5A in the supplementary material). This most probably represents the period where the last progenitors are being converted to tubules. Six2 mRNA and protein were completely undetectable by P4 (see Fig. S5B in the supplementary material). The Wnt9b target genes Pla2g7 and Cited1 were both present in the progenitor cells at P3 but completely absent (for Cited1 ) or present only in epithelial structures (for Pla2g7 ) at P4, indicating that, although Wnt9b was still expressed, it no longer actively signaled to the progenitor population (see Fig. S5C-F in the supplementary material). Importantly, the class I targets C1qdc2 and Pax8 were still expressed at P4, a full day after Cited1 was lost, indicating that Wnt9b is still active and inducing tubule formation (see Fig. S5H in the supplementary material and not shown). These data suggest that a loss of Wnt9b signaling to the progenitor cells normally coincides with or immediately follows loss of Six2 expression in the progenitors.

We have previously shown that removal of Wnt9b from the kidney between E15.5 and E17.5 resulted in significantly smaller kidneys than in wild type ( Karner et al., 2009 ). We originally attributed this hypoplastic phenotype to a deficit in tubule induction; however, our new findings suggest this phenotype may be equally attributable to a deficit in progenitor cell expansion. To test this hypothesis, we assessed progenitor cell maintenance/expansion in KspCre;Wnt9b −/flox mice. Prior to E15.5, KspCre is active only in the distal collecting ducts and has no apparent effect on the expression of Wnt9b target genes ( Karner et al., 2009 ) (data not shown). At some time between E15.5 and E17.5, KspCre activity expands to include the ureteric bud tips (adjacent to the progenitors). We therefore examined the expression of Wnt9b-dependent and -independent progenitor markers in KspCre;Wnt9b −/flox kidneys between E15.5 and P1. Pax2, Six2 and the Wnt9b target genes Pla2g7, Tafa5 and Uncx4.1 were all present and expressed at comparable levels with wild-type kidneys at E15.5 (data not shown). At E17.5, Pax2 and Six2 levels were reduced in the progenitors cells of KspCre;Wnt9b −/c animals ( Fig. 6A,B ; data not shown), whereas Pla2g7 and Uncx4.1 were completely lost ( Fig. 6C,D,G,H ). Levels of Tafa5 were highly reduced at E17.5 and completely absent at P1 ( Fig. 6E,F,M,N ). The loss of expression for these genes was specific to progenitor cells as Pla2g7 expression in the medullary stroma was maintained in mutants (not shown). By P1, the progenitor population (as indicated by Six2 expression) appeared to be completely lost ( Fig. 6I-P ).

We next tested the effects of late Wnt9b ablation on progenitor cell proliferation. At E17.5, there was a significant reduction in cell proliferation rates in Wnt9b mutants (2.44% and 1.75% for wild type and KspCre;Wnt9b −/flox , respectively; P =0.027). However, as the progenitor cells in Wnt9b mutants are not being converted into new tubules (as determined by Clqdc2 expression) decreases in proliferation alone cannot explain the complete absence of the progenitor population by P1. We also evaluated the rate of apoptosis in KspCre;Wnt9b −/flox kidneys at E17.5. Somewhat surprisingly, this analysis revealed a significant increase in cell death upon loss of Wnt9b (1.62% and 26.83% apoptosis in wild-type and KspCre;Wnt9b −/flox animals, respectively, P =0.0039, t -test), even though apoptosis was not affected by Wnt9b loss at earlier stages. These data suggest that Wnt9b plays an additional (most probably secondary) role in survival of the progenitor population.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we present data suggesting that Wnt9b is actively signaling to the kidney progenitor cells where it cooperates with Six2 to mediate expansion and/or self-renewal. Multiple pieces of data suggest that the role for Wnt9b in the progenitors is direct and through the canonical/β-catenin-dependent pathway. First, we show that canonical activity is required for normal expression of progenitor targets. Second, we show that activation of the canonical pathway is sufficient to induce expression of these genes, even in the absence of Wnt9b. That this activation is not mimicking signaling downstream of Wnt4 (and tubule differentiation) is supported by the observation that progenitor targets are expressed normally in Wnt4 mutants and are lost prior to the cessation of renal vesicle formation (and Wnt4 loss) in wild-type post-natal kidneys. Finally, several Wnt9b progenitor target genes (11/13) contain highly conserved consensus Lef/Tcf-binding sites within their loci and several of these elements are associated with β-catenin in vivo.

Our data suggest that Wnt9b signals through β-catenin to both cell populations with distinct cellular and molecular results. In the progenitors, it promotes renewal/proliferation, whereas in the PTAs it promotes differentiation. Reiterative use of β-catenin in phases of stem cell activation and differentiation has been shown in other systems, most notably the hair follicle stem cells ( Lowry et al., 2005 ). How does Wnt9b induce disparate responses (self-renewal versus differentiation) in different cell types using the same signal transduction cascade? Our data suggest that, in the kidney, Six2 is an important player in this decision.

A simple model that explains all of the genetic and molecular analysis in this and previous studies is that a combination of β-catenin and Six2 results in progenitor renewal, while β-catenin alone (or in combination with another factor) results in differentiation. Cells that express Six2 and receive a Wnt9b signal are induced to proliferate and to maintain the progenitor pool, while cells that receive the Wnt9b/β-catenin signal but do not have active Six2 (and/or do express another, unknown factor) are induced to differentiate.

The molecular nature of the interaction between β-catenin and Six2 is unclear. It is plausible that Six2 regulates the expression of a separate set of progenitor specific factors that interacts with and/or alters the response to Wnt9b/β-catenin, perhaps amplifying or dampening the signal, as has been suggested in the hair follicles. It is also possible that Six2 directly (or indirectly) interacts with β-catenin to drive expression of individual genes. Determining which, if any, of the above scenarios exists within the kidney mesenchyme will certainly enhance our understanding of progenitor cell differentiation during normal development, as well as in pathological states.

It is important to note that, although levels are highest in the progenitors, Six2 also shows low level expression in the PTAs. It is possible that Six2 cooperates with β-catenin in both cell types to activate expression of target genes. This is consistent with our finding that many of the Wnt9b targets are expressed in both the progenitors and the PTAs, and are completely lost in Six2 mutants. However, some, such as Cited1, are expressed only in the progenitors whereas others, such as C1qdc2, are expressed only in the PTAs (and are expanded in Six2 mutants). These observations suggest that there are additional cell type-specific transcriptional regulators that cooperate with Six2 and β-catenin to drive expression in the various cell types.

In summary, we have identified a novel mechanism by which renal progenitor cells respond to the same Wnt9b signal with distinct results: self-renewal versus differentiation. By using this relatively simple mechanism, the kidney is able to balance tubule induction and progenitor cell maintenance, insuring that the proper numbers of nephrons form. These findings are highly relevant to human diseases that affect kidney progenitors, such as aplasia, hypoplasia, decreased nephron endowment and renal progenitor tumors. Furthermore, they provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate kidney progenitor cell differentiation and will enhance future attempts to repair or replace missing or damaged organs.
