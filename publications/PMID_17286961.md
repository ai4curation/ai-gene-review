BRCA2 is responsible for familial breast and ovarian cancer, and its gene 
product is linked to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. The BRCA2 
protein exists mainly in the nucleus. Here, we show that BRCA2 has a centrosomal 
localization signal (CLS), localizes also to centrosomes during S and early M 
phases, and may regulate duplication and separation of the centrosomes. Green 
fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the CLS peptides from BRCA2 (GFP-CLS) 
localizes to centrosomes and prevents endogenous BRCA2 from localizing to 
centrosomes. In addition, expression of GFP-CLS in cells leads to the abnormal 
duplication and positioning of centrosomes, resulting in the generation of 
multinuclear cells. These results thus implicate BRCA2 in the regulation of the 
centrosome cycle, and provide new insight into the aneuploid nature of many 
breast cancers.

## Full Text

Centrosomes are important cytoplasmic organelles involved in chromosome segregation, defects in which can result in aneuploidy, and contribute to tumorigenesis. It is known that DNA damage causes the supernumerary centrosomes by a mechanism in which centrosomes continue to duplicate during cell cycle arrest at checkpoints. We show here that ionizing radiation induces the overduplication of centrosomes in a dose‐dependent manner, and that the level of overduplication is pronounced in BRCA1‐ and NBS1‐deficient cells, even though their checkpoint control is abrogated. Conversely, marginal increases in overduplication were observed in Ku70‐ and DNA‐PKcs‐deficient cells, which are intact in checkpoint control. The frequency of radiation‐induced overduplication of centrosomes might be associated with DNA repair, as it was decreased with reduced cell killing after protracted exposures to radiation. As a result, when the frequency of radiation‐induced centrosome overduplication was plotted against radiation‐induced cell killing, similar curves were seen for both protracted and acute exposures in wild‐type cells, Ku70‐deficient, and DNA‐PKcs‐deficient cells, indicating a common mechanism for centrosome overduplication. However, the absence of either BRCA1 or NBS1 enhanced radiation‐induced overduplication frequencies by 2–4‐fold on the basis of the same cell killing. These results suggest that radiation‐induced centrosome overduplication is regulated by at least two mechanisms: a checkpoint‐dependent pathway involved in wild‐type cells, Ku70‐deficient and DNA‐PKcs‐deficient cells; and a checkpoint‐independent pathway as observed in BRCA1‐deficient and NBS1‐deficient cells.
