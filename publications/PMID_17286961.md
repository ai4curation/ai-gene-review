BRCA2 is responsible for familial breast and ovarian cancer, and its gene 
product is linked to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. The BRCA2 
protein exists mainly in the nucleus. Here, we show that BRCA2 has a centrosomal 
localization signal (CLS), localizes also to centrosomes during S and early M 
phases, and may regulate duplication and separation of the centrosomes. Green 
fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the CLS peptides from BRCA2 (GFP-CLS) 
localizes to centrosomes and prevents endogenous BRCA2 from localizing to 
centrosomes. In addition, expression of GFP-CLS in cells leads to the abnormal 
duplication and positioning of centrosomes, resulting in the generation of 
multinuclear cells. These results thus implicate BRCA2 in the regulation of the 
centrosome cycle, and provide new insight into the aneuploid nature of many 
breast cancers.

Abstract

Centrosomes are important cytoplasmic organelles involved in chromosome segregation, defects in which can result in aneuploidy, and contribute to tumorigenesis. It is known that DNA damage causes the supernumerary centrosomes by a mechanism in which centrosomes continue to duplicate during cell cycle arrest at checkpoints. We show here that ionizing radiation induces the overduplication of centrosomes in a dose‐dependent manner, and that the level of overduplication is pronounced in BRCA1‐ and NBS1‐deficient cells, even though their checkpoint control is abrogated. Conversely, marginal increases in overduplication were observed in Ku70‐ and DNA‐PKcs‐deficient cells, which are intact in checkpoint control. The frequency of radiation‐induced overduplication of centrosomes might be associated with DNA repair, as it was decreased with reduced cell killing after protracted exposures to radiation. As a result, when the frequency of radiation‐induced centrosome overduplication was plotted against radiation‐induced cell killing, similar curves were seen for both protracted and acute exposures in wild‐type cells, Ku70‐deficient, and DNA‐PKcs‐deficient cells, indicating a common mechanism for centrosome overduplication. However, the absence of either BRCA1 or NBS1 enhanced radiation‐induced overduplication frequencies by 2–4‐fold on the basis of the same cell killing. These results suggest that radiation‐induced centrosome overduplication is regulated by at least two mechanisms: a checkpoint‐dependent pathway involved in wild‐type cells, Ku70‐deficient and DNA‐PKcs‐deficient cells; and a checkpoint‐independent pathway as observed in BRCA1‐deficient and NBS1‐deficient cells.

Materials and Methods

Cell culture and transfection. The human cell line U2OS and the mouse cell line NIH3T3 were used as control cell lines. A31‐1 cells (Nbs1 −/− ) were established from mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Nbs1 knockout mice using SV40 infection. Brca1 −/− and Brca1 +/− mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were gifts from M.E. Moynahan, Developmental Biology, Memorial Sloan‐Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. Ku70 −/− , SCID‐IM (DNA‐PKcs −/− ), and CB‐17‐IM (DNA‐PKcs +/+ ) cells were established from mouse embryonic fibroblasts obtained from the appropriate knockout mice (a gift from F.W. Alt, Department of Genetics and Pediatrics, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA) and the parental mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA) through SV40 infection. A31‐1 cells complemented with NBS1 cDNA (A31‐1 + NBS1 cDNA) and Ku70 −/− cells complemented with Ku70 cDNA (Ku70 −/− + Ku70 cDNA) were used as wild‐type cell controls. Preparation of (A31‐1 + NBS1 cDNA) cells and (Ku70 −/− +Ku70 cDNA) cells was carried out as previously reported. ( 12 ) Cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone, Waltham, MA, USA) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 .

Results

Excess centrosomes accumulate after exposure of cells to acute and protracted IR. To determine the number of centrosomes in each cell, the expression of γ‐tubulin, a centrosome‐specific protein, was quantified with immunostaining at various time points after exposure to IR. In U2OS cells, excess centrosomes in irradiated cells, defined as more than two centrosomes per cell, reached a peak at 96 h after an acute 5 Gy exposure at a dose rate of 1 Gy/min. The centrosome number then gradually declined over the next 48 h ( Fig. 1a , left panel). To determine the dose rate effects of centrosome overduplication, we compared their frequencies at a dose rate of 1 Gy/min with that of 0.5 m Gy/min, in which we observed the repair from DNA damage after IR exposure. ( 21 , 22 , 30 ) After a protracted exposure (5 Gy at a dose rate of 0.5 mGy/min), the frequency of cells containing excess centrosomes was relatively constant for at least 96 h ( Fig. 1a , right panel). When human U2OS cells were compared at 96 h post‐exposure, it was found that IR increased the frequency of centrosomes in a dose‐dependent fashion ( Figs 1b , left panel,S1). Moreover, as observed for cell death frequencies ( Fig. 1c , left panel), the frequency of cells containing excess centrosomes after a protracted exposure to 5 Gy was reduced to 70–80% of that seen after an acute exposure to 5 Gy ( Fig. 1b , left panel). Because cell death frequencies appeared to correlate with a reduced frequency of cells containing excess centrosomes, cells were next treated with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine to examine the causal relationship between the frequency of cells containing excess centrosomes and cell death. Consistent with a previous report, ( 12 ) roscovitine strongly suppressed the accumulation of excess centrosomes in irradiated cells, whereas the levels of cell death remained unchanged ( Fig. 1d ). This observation indicates that there is no causal relationship between the frequency of cells containing excess centrosomes and cell death. A reduced frequency of cells containing excess centrosomes after protracted exposures was also observed in mouse NIH3T3 cells ( Fig. 1b,c , right panel).

Discussion

In this report, it was shown that centrosome overduplication after IR exposure is dose‐dependent and is significantly reduced after protracted exposures to IR when compared to acute exposures. Centrosome duplication is triggered by the activation of CDK/cyclin‐A/E, and the production of excess centrosomes is caused by continued centrosome duplication during cell cycle arrest in the G 2 phase with the introduction of DNA damage. ( 33 ) This model is supported by the observation that the number of cells containing excess centrosomes increased during the post‐irradiation period ( Fig. 1a , left panel) ( 23 ) and the number of excess centrosomes observed after IR exposures decreased in response to treatments with the CDK inhibitor, roscovitine ( Fig. 1d ).

Ionizing radiation delivers the same number of initial DSBs during both protracted and acute exposures, therefore, the lower rates of cell death observed after protracted exposures could be due to a reduction in the number of DSBs after DNA repair. To determine the relationship between centrosome overduplication and amount of DSBs, or cell killing, the frequency of cells containing excess centrosomes was plotted against cell death levels ( Fig. 6 ). Surprisingly, with different cell lines and different dose rates, these plots showed similar curves ( Fig. 6a ), and centrosome overduplication frequencies closely correlate with cell death frequencies, although there is no direct causal relationship ( Fig. 1b ). These results indicate that centrosome overduplication in irradiated cells, under different conditions of repair time (acute or protracted exposures), is associated with the number of DSBs which lead to cell killing. This association is consistent with a mechanistic model: uncoupling between cell cycle arrest and centrosome duplication, as the period of cell cycle arrest depends on the amount of DNA damage. ( 34 ) This trend was also observed in DNA‐PKcs‐ and Ku70‐deficient cells, although the frequency of cells containing centrosome overduplication was slightly reduced ( Fig. 6b ). This might be due to their defects in the rejoining of chromosomal aberration, ( 20 , 31 ) which is generated in cells containing centrosome overduplication. ( 35 )

Recently, it has been reported that many HR proteins, including NBS1, BRCA1, and BRCA2 can localize at the centrosomes. ( 36 , 37 ) It was shown here that the frequency of cells containing excess centrosomes after an IR exposure is considerably enhanced by deficiencies in the HR proteins BRCA1 and NBS1 on the same basis of cell killing, although their frequencies is higher in BRCA1‐deficient cells than in NBS1‐deficient cells ( Fig. 6 ). This different frequency could be due to partial function of NBS1 in NBS cells as a result of the hypomorphic mutation. ( 38 ) The elevated frequencies of both cells is an unexpected result, because NBS1 and BRCA1 are checkpoint proteins ( 39 ) and thus should abrogate G 2 arrest, ( 40 ) reducing centrosome overduplication. Consequently, these results suggest that BRCA1‐ and NBS1‐mediated centrosome aberrations are induced by a pathway independent of checkpoint activation. It was previously reported that centrosome overduplication is significantly increased by disruptions in the BRCA1 and NBS1 proteins in the absence of DNA damage. ( 12 ) Both proteins are involved in the ubiquitination of γ‐tubulin for the maintenance of centrosomes, a process in which the number of centrosomes present in a cell is likely monitored by BRCA1 and NBS1. ( 9 ) Therefore, an absence of their monitoring functions could enhance centrosome overduplication during growth arrest, even though such an arrest may be shorter than in wild‐type cells.

In summary, these results describing DNA repair on centrosome overduplication in both wild‐type and, most likely, NHEJ‐deficient cells, are consistent with a model in which excess centrosomes appearing after exposure to IR are generated by continued centrosome duplication during an induced cell cycle arrest. ( 33 ) In addition, a deficiency of either BRCA1 or NBS1 greatly increases centrosome overduplication in irradiated cells, possibly through an alternative pathway, because the absence of either of these two proteins shortens or abolishes the cell cycle arrest after an exposure to IR. ( 39 , 40 ) Therefore, overduplication of centrosomes after IR exposure is generated either through the cell cycle arrest or through direct control of centrosome duplication by centrosome‐maintaining protein, such as BRCA1/NBS1. BRCA1 is inactivated in familial breast cancer, and this is observed in approximately 5% of breast cancer patients. ( 41 ) Alternatively, in the absence of a mutation, BRCA1 is transcriptionally downregulated under hypoxic conditions. ( 42 ) When a patient with breast cancer receives a fractionated dose from a total dose of 40–60 Gy in radiation therapy or post‐mastectomy adjuvant radiation therapy, IR is delivered at 2 Gy/day for 4–6 weeks. ( 43 ) Given that centrosome overduplication is persistent over, at least, 144 h after IR exposure ( Fig. 1a ), the average dose rate for 4–6 weeks was calculated as 1 mGy/min (=10 Gy/weeks), which is comparable with the condition of protracted exposure used in this experiment. Based on these results, it is suggested that an additional risk of malignant progression may exist due to the occurrence of aneuploidy through centrosome overduplication, particularly in BRCA1‐deficient patients.
