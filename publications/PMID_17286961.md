BRCA2 is responsible for familial breast and ovarian cancer, and its gene 
product is linked to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. The BRCA2 
protein exists mainly in the nucleus. Here, we show that BRCA2 has a centrosomal 
localization signal (CLS), localizes also to centrosomes during S and early M 
phases, and may regulate duplication and separation of the centrosomes. Green 
fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the CLS peptides from BRCA2 (GFP-CLS) 
localizes to centrosomes and prevents endogenous BRCA2 from localizing to 
centrosomes. In addition, expression of GFP-CLS in cells leads to the abnormal 
duplication and positioning of centrosomes, resulting in the generation of 
multinuclear cells. These results thus implicate BRCA2 in the regulation of the 
centrosome cycle, and provide new insight into the aneuploid nature of many 
breast cancers.
