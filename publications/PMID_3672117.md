F-actin is the major component of muscle thin filaments and, more generally, of 
the microfilaments of the dynamic, multifunctional cytoskeletal systems of 
nonmuscle eukaryotic cells. Polymeric F-actin is formed by reversible 
noncovalent self-association of monomeric G-actin. To understand the dynamics of 
microfilament systems in cells, the dynamics of polymerization of pure actin 
must be understood. The following model has emerged from recent work. During the 
polymerization process, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) that is bound to G-actin 
is hydrolyzed to adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) that is bound to F-actin. The 
hydrolysis reaction occurs on the F-actin subsequent to the polymerization 
reaction in two steps: cleavage of ATP followed by the slower release of 
inorganic phosphate (Pi). As a result, at high rates of filament growth a 
transient cap of ATP-actin subunits exists at the ends of elongating filaments, 
and at steady state a stabilizing cap of ADP.Pi-actin subunits exists at the 
barbed ends of filaments. Cleavage of ATP results in a highly stable filament 
with bound ADP.Pi, and release of Pi destabilizes the filament. Thus these two 
steps of the hydrolytic reaction provide potential mechanisms for regulating the 
monomer-polymer transition.
