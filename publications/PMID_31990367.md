Human histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 2 (hHINT2) is an important 
player in human mitochondrial bioenergetics, but little is known about its 
catalytic capabilities or its nucleotide phosphoramidate prodrug 
(proTide)-activating activity akin to the cytosolic isozyme hHINT1. Here, a 
similar substrate specificity profile (kcat /Km ) for model phosphoramidate 
substrates was found for hHINT2 but with higher kcat and Km values when compared 
with hHINT1. A broader pH range for maximum catalytic activity was determined 
for hHINT2 (pK1  = 6.76 ± 0.16, pK2  = 8.41 ± 0.07). In addition, the known 
hHINT1-microphthalmia-inducing transcription factor-regulating molecule Ap4 A 
was found to have no detectable binding to HINT1 nor HINT2 by isothermal 
titration calorimetry. These results demonstrate that despite differences in 
their sequence and localization, HINT1 and HINT2 have similar nucleotide 
substrate specificities, which should be considered in future proTide design and 
in studies of their natural function.
