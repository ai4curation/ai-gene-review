The familial Alzheimer's disease gene products, presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, 
have been reported to be functionally involved in amyloid precursor protein 
processing, notch receptor signaling, and programmed cell death or apoptosis. 
However, the molecular mechanisms by which presenilins regulate these processes 
remain unknown. With regard to the latter, we describe a molecular link between 
presenilins and the apoptotic pathway. Bcl-X(L), an anti-apoptotic member of the 
Bcl-2 family was shown to interact with the carboxyl-terminal fragments of PS1 
and PS2 by the yeast two-hybrid system. In vivo interaction analysis revealed 
that both PS2 and its naturally occurring carboxyl-terminal products, PS2short 
and PS2Ccas, associated with Bcl-X(L), whereas the caspase-3-generated 
amino-terminal PS2Ncas fragment did not. This interaction was corroborated by 
demonstrating that Bcl-X(L) and PS2 partially co-localized to sites of the 
vesicular transport system. Functional analysis revealed that presenilins can 
influence mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic activities, such as cytochrome c 
release and Bax-mediated apoptosis. Together, these data support a possible role 
of the Alzheimer's presenilins in modulating the anti-apoptotic effects of 
Bcl-X(L).
