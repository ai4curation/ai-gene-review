The DNA damage response (DDR) is a highly orchestrated process but how 
double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are initially recognized is unclear. Here, we 
show that polymerized SIRT6 deacetylase recognizes DSBs and potentiates the DDR 
in human and mouse cells. First, SIRT1 deacetylates SIRT6 at residue K33, which 
is important for SIRT6 polymerization and mobilization toward DSBs. Then, 
K33-deacetylated SIRT6 anchors to γH2AX, allowing its retention on and 
subsequent remodeling of local chromatin. We show that a K33R mutation that 
mimics hypoacetylated SIRT6 can rescue defective DNA repair as a result of SIRT1 
deficiency in cultured cells. These data highlight the synergistic action 
between SIRTs in the spatiotemporal regulation of the DDR and DNA repair in 
humans and mice.
