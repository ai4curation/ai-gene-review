Protein substrates are targeted to the 26S proteasome through several ubiquitin 
receptors. One of these receptors, RPN13, is recruited to the proteasome by 
binding of its N-terminal pleckstrin-like receptor of ubiquitin (PRU) domain to 
C-terminal residues of the scaffolding protein RPN2. The RPN13 PRU domain is 
followed by a flexible linker and a C-terminal deubiquitylase adaptor (DEUBAD) 
domain, which recruits and activates the deubiquitylase UCH37. Both RPN13 and 
UCH37 have been implicated in human cancers, and inhibitors of the RPN2-RPN13 
interaction are being developed as potential therapeutic anticancer agents. Our 
current study builds on the recognition that a residue central to the RPN2-RPN13 
interaction, RPN2 Tyr-950, is phosphorylated in Jurkat cells. We found that the 
Tyr-950 phosphorylation enhances binding to RPN13. The crystal structure of the 
RPN2-RPN13 pTyr-950-ubiquitin complex was determined at 1.76-Å resolution and 
reveals specific interactions with positively charged side chains in RPN13 that 
explain how phosphorylation increases binding affinity without inducing 
conformational change. Mutagenesis and quantitative binding assays were then 
used to validate the crystallographic interface. Our findings support a model in 
which RPN13 recruitment to the proteasome is enhanced by phosphorylation of RPN2 
Tyr-950, have important implications for efforts to develop specific inhibitors 
of the RPN2-RPN13 interaction, and suggest the existence of a previously unknown 
stress-response pathway.
