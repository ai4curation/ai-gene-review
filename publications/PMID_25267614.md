Aggressive neuroendocrine lung cancers, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) 
and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), represent an understudied tumor subset 
that accounts for approximately 40,000 new lung cancer cases per year in the 
United States. No targeted therapy exists for these tumors. We determined that 
achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1), a transcription factor required for proper 
development of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, is essential for the survival of 
a majority of lung cancers (both SCLC and NSCLC) with neuroendocrine features. 
By combining whole-genome microarray expression analysis performed on lung 
cancer cell lines with ChIP-Seq data designed to identify conserved 
transcriptional targets of ASCL1, we discovered an ASCL1 target 72-gene 
expression signature that (i) identifies neuroendocrine differentiation in NSCLC 
cell lines, (ii) is predictive of poor prognosis in resected NSCLC specimens 
from three datasets, and (iii) represents novel "druggable" targets. Among these 
druggable targets is B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2, which when pharmacologically 
inhibited stops ASCL1-dependent tumor growth in vitro and in vivo and represents 
a proof-of-principle ASCL1 downstream target gene. Analysis of downstream 
targets of ASCL1 represents an important advance in the development of targeted 
therapy for the neuroendocrine class of lung cancers, providing a significant 
step forward in the understanding and therapeutic targeting of the molecular 
vulnerabilities of neuroendocrine lung cancer.
