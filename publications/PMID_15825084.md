BACKGROUND & AIMS: The molecular mechanisms by which hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
antagonizes the antiviral actions of interferon (IFN) have not been fully 
characterized. Specifically, how HCV proteins impact on IFN signaling components 
has yet to be elucidated. We used an HCV cell-based expression model to examine 
the interaction between HCV protein expression and host type I IFN signaling 
components in the Jak-STAT kinase pathway.
METHODS: Full-length HCV and HCV subgenomic constructs corresponding to 
structural and each of the nonstructural proteins were transiently transfected 
into Huh-T7 cells. HCV expression was monitored by an HCV core antigen 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. STAT1, P-STAT1, and HCV protein expression 
was investigated with immunoprecipitation and Western blots.
RESULTS: Overexpression and small interfering RNA studies showed that STAT1 was 
indispensable for control of HCV expression. STAT1 and P-STAT1 expression were 
markedly reduced in HCV-transfected cells. Full-length HCV, HCV core/E1/E2, and 
NS3-4A were each associated with decreased STAT1 expression, which was 
attributable to proteasome-dependent degradation of STAT1. HCV core, but not HCV 
E1, E2, NS3, NS4, or NS5, bound to STAT1. STAT2 expression was not affected by 
HCV.
CONCLUSIONS: HCV expression selectively degrades STAT1 and reduces P-STAT1 
accumulation in the nucleus in a proteasome-dependent manner. HCV core protein 
binds STAT1, suggesting that this viral protein is associated with STAT1 
degradation. STAT1 plays an indispensable role in innate antiviral immunity 
against HCV expression. In turn, HCV subverts the Jak-STAT kinase by selectively 
inducing STAT1 degradation.
