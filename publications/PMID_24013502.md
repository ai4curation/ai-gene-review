Heterochromatin spreading leads to the silencing of genes within its path, and 
boundary elements have evolved to constrain such spreading. In fission yeast, 
heterochromatin at centromeres I and III is flanked by inverted repeats termed 
IRCs, which are required for proper boundary functions. However, the mechanisms 
by which IRCs prevent heterochromatin spreading are unknown. Here, we identified 
Bdf2, which is homologous to the mammalian bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) 
family double bromodomain proteins involved in diverse types of cancers, as a 
factor required for proper boundary function at IRCs. Bdf2 is enriched at IRCs 
through its interaction with the boundary protein Epe1. The bromodomains of Bdf2 
recognize acetylated histone H4 tails and antagonize Sir2-mediated deacetylation 
of histone H4K16. Furthermore, abolishing H4K16 acetylation (H4K16ac) with an 
H4K16R mutation promotes heterochromatin spreading, and mimicking H4K16ac by an 
H4K16Q mutation blocks heterochromatin spreading at IRCs. Our results thus 
illustrate a mechanism of establishing chromosome boundaries at specific sites 
through the recruitment of a factor that protects euchromatic histone 
modifications. They also reveal a previously unappreciated function of H4K16ac 
in cooperation with H3K9 methylation to regulate heterochromatin spreading.
