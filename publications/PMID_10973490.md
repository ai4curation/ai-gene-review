The protein kinase Chk2, the mammalian homolog of the budding yeast Rad53 and 
fission yeast Cds1 checkpoint kinases, is phosphorylated and activated in 
response to DNA damage by ionizing radiation (IR), UV irradiation, and 
replication blocks by hydroxyurea (HU). Phosphorylation and activation of Chk2 
are ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) dependent in response to IR, whereas 
Chk2 phosphorylation is ATM-independent when cells are exposed to UV or HU. Here 
we show that in vitro, ATM phosphorylates the Ser-Gln/Thr-Gln (SQ/TQ) cluster 
domain (SCD) on Chk2, which contains seven SQ/TQ motifs, and Thr68 is the major 
in vitro phosphorylation site by ATM. ATM- and Rad3-related also phosphorylates 
Thr68 in addition to Thr26 and Ser50, which are not phosphorylated to a 
significant extent by ATM in vitro. In vivo, Thr68 is phosphorylated in an 
ATM-dependent manner in response to IR, but not in response to UV or HU. 
Substitution of Thr68 with Ala reduced the extent of phosphorylation and 
activation of Chk2 in response to IR, and mutation of all seven SQ/TQ motifs 
blocked all phosphorylation and activation of Chk2 after IR. These results 
suggest that in vivo, Chk2 is directly phosphorylated by ATM in response to IR 
and that Chk2 is regulated by phosphorylation of the SCD.
