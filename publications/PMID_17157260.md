Posttranslational histone modifications participate in modulating the structure 
and function of chromatin. Promoters of transcribed genes are enriched with K4 
trimethylation and hyperacetylation on the N-terminal tail of histone H3. 
Recently, PHD finger proteins, like Yng1 in the NuA3 HAT complex, were shown to 
interact with H3K4me3, indicating a biochemical link between K4 methylation and 
hyperacetylation. By using a combination of mass spectrometry, biochemistry, and 
NMR, we detail the Yng1 PHD-H3K4me3 interaction and the importance of 
NuA3-dependent acetylation at K14. Furthermore, genome-wide ChIP-Chip analysis 
demonstrates colocalization of Yng1 and H3K4me3 in vivo. Disrupting the K4me3 
binding of Yng1 altered K14ac and transcription at certain genes, thereby 
demonstrating direct in vivo evidence of sequential trimethyl binding, 
acetyltransferase activity, and gene regulation by NuA3. Our data support a 
general mechanism of transcriptional control through which histone acetylation 
upstream of gene activation is promoted partially through availability of 
H3K4me3, "read" by binding modules in select subunits.
