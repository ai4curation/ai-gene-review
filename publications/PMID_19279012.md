Mitochondrial dysregulation is strongly implicated in Parkinson disease. 
Mutations in PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) are associated with familial 
parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric disorders. Although overexpressed PINK1 is 
neuroprotective, less is known about neuronal responses to loss of PINK1 
function. We found that stable knockdown of PINK1 induced mitochondrial 
fragmentation and autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells, which was reversed by the 
reintroduction of an RNA interference (RNAi)-resistant plasmid for PINK1. 
Moreover, stable or transient overexpression of wild-type PINK1 increased 
mitochondrial interconnectivity and suppressed toxin-induced 
autophagy/mitophagy. Mitochondrial oxidant production played an essential role 
in triggering mitochondrial fragmentation and autophagy in PINK1 shRNA lines. 
Autophagy/mitophagy served a protective role in limiting cell death, and 
overexpressing Parkin further enhanced this protective mitophagic response. The 
dominant negative Drp1 mutant inhibited both fission and mitophagy in 
PINK1-deficient cells. Interestingly, RNAi knockdown of autophagy proteins Atg7 
and LC3/Atg8 also decreased mitochondrial fragmentation without affecting 
oxidative stress, suggesting active involvement of autophagy in morphologic 
remodeling of mitochondria for clearance. To summarize, loss of PINK1 function 
elicits oxidative stress and mitochondrial turnover coordinated by the 
autophagic and fission/fusion machineries. Furthermore, PINK1 and Parkin may 
cooperate through different mechanisms to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis.
