The functions of Beclin-1 in macroautophagy, tumorigenesis and cytokinesis are 
thought to be mediated by its association with the PI3K-III complex. Here, we 
describe a new role for Beclin-1 in mitotic chromosome congression that is 
independent of the PI3K-III complex and its role in autophagy. Beclin-1 
depletion in HeLa cells leads to a significant reduction of the outer 
kinetochore proteins CENP-E, CENP-F and ZW10, and, consequently, the cells 
present severe problems in chromosome congression. Beclin-1 associates with 
kinetochore microtubules and forms discrete foci near the kinetochores of 
attached chromosomes. We show that Beclin-1 interacts directly with Zwint-1-a 
component of the KMN (KNL-1/Mis12/Ndc80) complex-which is essential for 
kinetochore-microtubule interactions. This suggests that Beclin-1 acts 
downstream of the KMN complex to influence the recruitment of outer kinetochore 
proteins and promotes accurate kinetochore anchoring to the spindle during 
mitosis.
