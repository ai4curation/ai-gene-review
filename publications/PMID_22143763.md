The molecular chaperone αB-crystallin, the major player in maintaining the 
transparency of the eye lens, prevents stress-damaged and aging lens proteins 
from aggregation. In nonlenticular cells, it is involved in various neurological 
diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Given its structural plasticity and dynamics, 
structure analysis of αB-crystallin presented hitherto a formidable challenge. 
Here we present a pseudoatomic model of a 24-meric αB-crystallin assembly 
obtained by a triple hybrid approach combining data from cryoelectron 
microscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and structural modeling. The model, confirmed by 
cross-linking and mass spectrometry, shows that the subunits interact within the 
oligomer in different, defined conformations. We further present the molecular 
architectures of additional well-defined αB-crystallin assemblies with larger or 
smaller numbers of subunits, provide the mechanism how "heterogeneity" is 
achieved by a small set of defined structural variations, and analyze the 
factors modulating the oligomer equilibrium of αB-crystallin and thus its 
chaperone activity.
