Peroxiredoxins are receiving increasing attention as defenders against oxidative 
damage and sensors of hydrogen peroxide-mediated signaling events. Likely to be 
critical for both functions is a rapid reaction with hydrogen peroxide, 
typically with second-order rate constants higher than 10(5) M(-1) s(-1). Until 
recently, however, the values reported for these rate constants have been in the 
range of 10(4)-10(5) M(-1) s(-1), including those for cytosolic thioredoxin 
peroxidases I (Tsa1) and II (Tsa2) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To resolve 
this apparent paradox, we developed a competitive kinetic approach with 
horseradish peroxidase to determine the second-order rate constant of the 
reaction of peroxiredoxins with peroxynitrite and hydrogen peroxide. This method 
was validated and allowed for the determination of the second-order rate 
constant of the reaction of Tsa1 and Tsa2 with peroxynitrite (k approximately 
10(5) M(-1) s(-1)) and hydrogen peroxide (k approximately 10(7) M(-1) s(-1)) at 
pH 7.4, 25 degrees C. It also permitted the determination of the pKa of the 
peroxidatic cysteine of Tsa1 and Tsa2 (Cys47) as 5.4 and 6.3, respectively. In 
addition to providing a useful method for studying thiol protein kinetics, our 
studies add to recent reports challenging the popular belief that peroxiredoxins 
are poor enzymes toward hydrogen peroxide, as compared with heme and selenium 
proteins.
