Accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and tau aggregates, possibly linked 
to age-associated deficiencies in protein homeostasis, appear to cause 
Alzheimer's disease. Schiff-base formation between Abeta and the 
aldehyde-bearing cholesterol oxidation product 
3-beta-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al is known to increase Abeta 
amyloidogenicity. Here, we synthesized Abeta variants site-specifically modified 
with the cholesterol aldehyde at Asp-1, Lys-16, or Lys-28, rather than studying 
mixtures. These distinct modifications have a similar effect on the 
thermodynamic propensity for aggregation, enabling aggregation at low 
concentrations. In contrast, the modification site differentially influences the 
aggregation kinetics; Lys-16-modified Abeta formed amorphous aggregates fastest 
and at the lowest concentration (within 2 h at a concentration of 20 nM), 
followed by the Lys-28 and Asp-1 conjugates. Also, the aggregates resulting from 
Abeta Lys-16 cholesterol aldehyde conjugation were more toxic to primary rat 
cortical neurons than treatment with unmodified Abeta under identical conditions 
and at the same concentration. Our results show that Abeta modification by 
cholesterol derivatives, especially at Lys-16, renders it kinetically and 
thermodynamically competent to form neurotoxic aggregates at concentrations 
approaching the physiologic concentration of Abeta.
