Exercise increases AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) activity in human and rat 
adipocytes, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and functional consequences 
of this activation are not known. Since adrenaline (epinephrine) concentrations 
increase with exercise, in the present study we hypothesized that adrenaline 
activates AMPK in adipocytes. We show that a single bout of exercise increases 
AMPKalpha1 and alpha2 activities and ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) Ser79 
phosphorylation in rat adipocytes. Similarly to exercise, adrenaline treatment 
in vivo increased AMPK activities and ACC phosphorylation. Pre-treatment of rats 
with the beta-blocker propranolol fully blocked exercise-induced AMPK 
activation. Increased AMPK activity with exercise and adrenaline treatment in 
vivo was accompanied by an increased AMP/ATP ratio. Adrenaline incubation of 
isolated adipocytes also increased the AMP/ATP ratio and AMPK activities, an 
effect blocked by propranolol. Adrenaline incubation increased lipolysis in 
isolated adipocytes, and Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, attenuated this effect. 
Finally, a potential role for AMPK in the decreased adiposity associated with 
chronic exercise was suggested by marked increases in AMPKalpha1 and alpha2 
activities in adipocytes from rats trained for 6 weeks. In conclusion, both 
acute and chronic exercise are significant regulators of AMPK activity in rat 
adipocytes. Our findings suggest that adrenaline plays a critical role in 
exercise-stimulated AMPKalpha1 and alpha2 activities in adipocytes, and that 
AMPK can function in the regulation of lipolysis.

Finally, a potential role for AMPK in the decreased adiposity associated with chronic exercise was suggested by marked increases in AMPKα1 and α2 activities in adipocytes from rats trained for 6 weeks. In conclusion, both acute and chronic exercise are significant regulators of AMPK activity in rat adipocytes. Our findings suggest that adrenaline plays a critical role in exercise-stimulated AMPKα1 and α2 activities in adipocytes, and that AMPK can function in the regulation of lipolysis.
