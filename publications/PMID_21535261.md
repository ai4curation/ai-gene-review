Cell cycle progression is controlled by both extracellular and intracellular 
signalling molecules. It has been generally believed that cdc2/CDK1 only control 
G(2)-M transition in mammalian and many other higher eukaryotic cells. 
Accumulating evidence shows that cdc2 not only promotes G(2)-M transition but is 
also capable of regulating G(1) progress and G(1)-S transition via association 
with multiple interphase cyclins; cdc2 activity can be inhibited by p21 and p27, 
two traditional G(1) CDK inhibitors. In addition, cdc2-cyclin B controls 
pronuclear union in interphase fertilized eggs. These data suggest that cdc2 may 
be a pluripotent CDK. Although mechanisms responsible for the multiple functions 
of cdc2 remain to be further investigated, interactions of cdc2 with pRb and 
with several important transcription factors may provide a clue to the 
pluripotent role of cdc2.
