Viruses remodel the host cell to optimize their replication both by delivery of 
virion proteins into the cell and by de novo expression of viral proteins. The 
HSV particle contains several proteins that function to prepare the host cell 
for viral replication, including the VP16 transcriptional activator protein and 
virion host shutoff protein. HSV infection activates NF-kappaB pathways through 
Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and non-TLR pathways, and NF-kappaB activity is 
required for efficient viral replication. In a screen of the HSV proteome, we 
observed that the HSV U(L)37 tegument protein activates NF-kappaB signaling in a 
TLR2-independent manner. Expression of U(L)37 in transfected cells leads to 
IkappaB degradation and activation of both reporter genes and the endogenous 
IL-8 gene. This activation requires TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), 
and U(L)37 contains a TRAF6-binding domain that is required for interaction with 
TRAF6 and activation of NF-kappaB. A mutant virus encoding U(L)37 with an 
altered TRAF6-binding site shows reduced NF-kappaB activation in the early phase 
of infection. Therefore, the HSV U(L)37 virion structural protein can activate 
NF-kappaB through TRAF6. Activation of NF-kappaB by a virion tegument protein 
that is delivered into the host cell cytoplasm during viral entry represents a 
mechanism for activation of this pathway by a virus.

Abstract

Viruses remodel the host cell to optimize their replication both by delivery of virion proteins into the cell and by de novo expression of viral proteins. The HSV particle contains several proteins that function to prepare the host cell for viral replication, including the VP16 transcriptional activator protein and virion host shutoff protein. HSV infection activates NF-κB pathways through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and non-TLR pathways, and NF-κB activity is required for efficient viral replication. In a screen of the HSV proteome, we observed that the HSV U L 37 tegument protein activates NF-κB signaling in a TLR2-independent manner. Expression of U L 37 in transfected cells leads to IκB degradation and activation of both reporter genes and the endogenous IL-8 gene. This activation requires TNF receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and U L 37 contains a TRAF6-binding domain that is required for interaction with TRAF6 and activation of NF-κB. A mutant virus encoding U L 37 with an altered TRAF6-binding site shows reduced NF-κB activation in the early phase of infection. Therefore, the HSV U L 37 virion structural protein can activate NF-κB through TRAF6. Activation of NF-κB by a virion tegument protein that is delivered into the host cell cytoplasm during viral entry represents a mechanism for activation of this pathway by a virus.

Results

The HSV gene products that directly activate NF-κB through TLR2 or non-TLR2 pathways, other than potentially gD, have not been identified. To screen the HSV proteome for the capacity to activate NF-κB, we cloned the ORFs of HSV-1 strain KOS into a mammalian expression plasmid. Seventy HSV-1 ORFs were screened for their ability to activate an NF-κB reporter gene in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing TLR2, and the viral U L 37 gene product was one of the most active (results not shown). The U L 37 protein is a component of the tegument layer of the HSV virion located between the envelope and the capsid ( 10 ) and is essential for viral replication ( 15 ). To our surprise, this signaling was independent of TLR2 because U L 37 also activated NF-κB reporter gene expression in HEK293 cells that did not have the TLR2 gene transfected into them [ supporting information (SI) Fig. S1 ]. This activity was dose dependent and was equivalent to that achieved by the transfection of equal amounts of plasmid DNAs expressing adaptor protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) or an NF-κB subunit, p65 ( Fig. 1 A ). Consistent with its ability to activate the NF-κB reporter gene, U L 37 activated the expression of the endogenous IL-8 gene in HEK cells, similar to overexpression of MyD88, TRAF6, or p65 ( Fig. 1 B ). U L 37 triggered the degradation of IκB in HEK cells, as observed with overexpression of the adaptor protein, MyD88 adapter-like protein (MAL) ( Fig. 1 C ).

Activation of NF-κB through TLR2 involves the engagement of MyD88 and MAL, the recruitment of IL-associated kinase (IRAK) 4 and IRAK1, followed by the recruitment of TRAF6. TRAF6 then complexes with TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2), TGF-β activated kinase (TAK1), and TAB1, which activate IKK to phosphorylate IκB, causing its degradation and release of NF-κB for nuclear translocation ( 16 ). To determine if these signaling components were required for U L 37 activation of NF-κB, a panel of dominant-negative (DN) mutant forms of signaling intermediates including MAL, MyD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, TAB2, TAK1, IKK, and p65 were cotransfected with U L 37 plasmid to test their ability to inhibit the activity of U L 37. We observed that overexpression of DN-p65 blocked the signaling induced by U L 37, just as it blocked signaling by overexpression of MyD88 ( Fig. 2 A ). Similarly, DN-IKK eliminated the NF-κB activation by U L 37 but had no effect on p65 stimulation of NF-κB ( Fig. 2 A ). Overexpression of DN-MAL or DN-MyD88 had no effect on U L 37 signaling, but overexpression of DN-IRAK1, DN-TRAF6, DN-TAK1, or DN-TAB2 inhibited U L 37 activation of NF-κB to the same extent that it inhibited MyD88 activation ( Fig. 2 ). To confirm that TRAF6 was needed for the U L 37 activation of NF-κB, we examined the effect of U L 37 in TRAF6 knockout and WT mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). U L 37 activation of NF-κB was ≈5-fold lower in TRAF6 knockout MEFs than in WT MEFs ( Fig. 2 B ). In total, these results indicate that U L 37 activation of NF-κB uses a signaling pathway similar to that of the TLR2 pathway starting from TRAF6 and IRAK1.

We constructed a series of mutant U L 37 genes to map the essential portions of U L 37 needed for NF-κB activation ( Fig. 3 A ). We observed that the C-terminal 123-aa residues were essential for activation ( Fig. 3 ). Analysis of the amino acid sequence within this region identified a potential TRAF6-binding motif of the general form PxExx(Ar/Ac) ( 17 ) within U L 37: 1099 PVEDDE 1101A4 ( Fig. 3 B ). The U L 37 sequence is identical to the TRAF6-binding motif in IRAK-M ( 18 ), strengthening the possibility that this sequence is a TRAF6-binding domain. We therefore tested whether U L 37 interacts with TRAF6 through immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays using extracts of cells transfected with a plasmid encoding a V5 epitope- and his-tagged U L 37 protein. When we immunoprecipitated TRAF6 from the extracts, we observed coprecipitation of WT U L 37 ( Fig. 4 A ). However, the U L 37 E1101A mutant protein, in which the essential glutamate residue of the putative TRAF6- binding site was replaced by alanine, coimmunoprecipitated with TRAF6 only at very low levels ( Fig. 4 A ). A control HSV protein, U L 17, did not coprecipitate with TRAF6 ( Fig. 4 A ). In the reverse experiment, when tagged U L 37 was recovered by affinity purification, TRAF6 was pulled down very efficiently ( Fig. 4 B ). However, when the U L 37 E1101A mutant protein was recovered by affinity purification, very little TRAF6 was pulled down ( Fig. 4 B ). Similarly, very little TRAF6 was pulled down by a control HSV protein, U L 24 ( Fig. 4 B ). Therefore, U L 37 interacted with TRAF6, and the putative TRAF6-binding motif was required for this interaction.

U L 37 associated with a complex that involved, in addition to TRAF6, TAB1, TAB2, and TAK1 because immunoprecipitation of these proteins also coprecipitated U L 37 ( Fig. S2 ). Small amounts of U L 37 were coimmunoprecipitated with IRAK1, indicating that it may be a minor component of the complex, but U L 37 was not associated with MyD88 or MAL. The interaction of IRAK1, TAB1, TAB2, and TAK1 with U L 37 was dependent on the TRAF6-binding motif in U L 37, arguing that the associations of the other proteins with U L 37 were dependent on the binding of U L 37 to TRAF6.

To test the role of the TRAF6-binding site in NF-κB activation, we transfected the WT or mutant U L 37 plasmids into HEK cells with a reporter gene. WT U L 37 activated the NF-κB reporter plasmid; the E1101A mutant protein did not ( Fig. 5 A ). Therefore, U L 37 must interact with TRAF6 to activate NF-κB signaling. To test the role of U L 37 in activation of NF-κB in HSV-infected cells, we constructed a mutant HSV-1 strain that encodes the E1101A mutant form of U L 37. Cells infected with a virus expressing WT U L 37-GFP showed a biphasic induction of NF-κB DNA-binding activity ( Fig. 5 B), as observed previously ( 13 ). NF-κB activity was induced to moderate levels from 1 to 4 h and then was highly activated from 6 h onward ( Fig. 5 B ). In contrast, the E1101A mutant virus (RF-1) showed a lower level of NF-κB activation from 1 to 5 h after induction but showed normal activation of NF-κB from 6 h onward ( Fig. 5 B ). Despite the lack of NF-κB induction by the mutant virus, normal amounts of U L 37 were incorporated into virus particles (X.L. and D.M.K., results not shown).

We performed two additional lines of experimentation to confirm that virion-associated U L 37 can activate NF-κB in infected cells. First, to ensure that the phenotypic defect in the KGFP-RF1 mutant virus was caused by the U L 37 gene mutation, we repaired the mutation by replacing the E1101A mutant gene with the WT U L 37 gene. The rescued virus, KGFP-RF1-R, induced WT levels of NF-κB from 1 to 6 h after induction, confirming that U L 37 was responsible for the phenotype. Second, to ensure that virion U L 37 was responsible for the effect, we infected cells with UV-inactivated viruses because UV-inactivated HSV induces only early NF-κB activation ( 13 ). UV-inactivated KGFP-U L 37 induced NF-κB DNA-binding activity at reduced levels from 1 to 3 h after induction only ( Fig. 5 D ). UV-inactivated KGFP-RF1 mutant virus activated NF-κB DNA-binding activity at 1–6 h after induction to approximately one-half that of the WT virus ( Fig. 5 D ). In total, at least one-half of the early virion-induced NF-κB DNA-binding activity was induced by U L 37.

Discussion

HSV activation of NF-κB occurs in two waves, the first being independent of viral replication and the second requiring viral gene expression ( 13 ). We found that the U L 37 protein located in the tegument layer between the virion lipid envelope and capsid protein shell can activate NF-κB. Virion envelope proteins can activate cytokine signaling by interaction with cell surface receptors (e.g., Ref. 14 ), but our observations provide evidence that an internal virion protein delivered into the cytoplasm can activate NF-κB. Influenza virus capsid and matrix proteins ( 19 ) and HCV core protein ( 20 ) can activate NF-κB when overexpressed, but there is no evidence that incoming virion proteins can activate signaling. Activation of NF-κB in HSV-infected cells also may be stimulated by the gD in the virion envelope interacting with the Herpesvirus entry mediator surface receptor ( 14 ), as observed in Fig. 5 B from 1 to 2 h after induction. U L 37 released into the cytoplasm then could induce the NF-κB activation that we observed from 2 to 5 h after induction ( Fig. 5 B ). The combination of gD and U L 37 could explain the early transient activation of NF-κB by UV-inactivated virions ( 13 ). The later activation that we observed after 5 h after induction could involve infected cell protein 27 or proteins whose expression requires infected cell protein 27 ( 21 ). The HSV U L 37 protein has a virion structural and/or assembly role because it is essential for virion maturation ( 15 ), and its ability to induce NF-κB represents a possible second function.

The interaction of HSV with NF-κB is quite complex in that the virus and its gene products both initiate and inhibit NF-κB. It is likely that the early activation by virion proteins is necessary for full transcription of viral genes, whereas at later times viral gene products act to down-regulate host innate responses that would serve to reduce viral replication or induce adaptive immune responses. Conservation of the U L 37 function in homologous genes encoded by other herpesviruses would support its importance in viral replication. Thus, it is noteworthy that the U L 37 homologs encoded by several other herpesviruses also have putative TRAF6-binding domains. These homologs include HSV-2 U L 37: 1098 PVEDDE 1103 , Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 (monkey B virus) U L 37: 1162 PEEDDD 1167 , human cytomegalovirus U L 47: 901 PWESAP 907 , and human herpes virus 8 or Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus ORF63: 700 PPEQPP 705 . Human cytomegalovirus is known to activate NF-κB very early in infection, probably because of effects of the virion particle ( 22 ). Thus, the U L 47 protein may be in part responsible for this effect. The conservation of this potential binding site in several herpes viruses argues that this function is important in herpesviral replication or biology.

Details of the mechanism by which U L 37 activates NF-κB remain to be elucidated fully, but from our results we can propose the basic outline of this process. U L 37 interacts with TRAF6, and this interaction is required for NF-κB activation. Furthermore, U L 37-induced signaling requires TAK-1 and TAB-2, and U L 37 is in a complex with TRAF6, TAB1, TAB2, and TAK1. This finding argues that U L 37 binds to and activates TRAF6 signaling by promoting formation of the complex of proteins, leading to IKK activation, IκB degradation, and NF-κB activation. The role of this function in viral replication and latent infection also remains to be defined. The mutant virus defective for TRAF6 interaction shows an approximately 2-fold reduction in viral replication in Vero monkey cells (X.L. and D.M.K., unpublished results). Further studies of this mutant virus in cell culture and animal model systems are needed to determine the role of this U L 37 function in viral infection.
