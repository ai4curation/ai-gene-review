Rab GTPases regulate vesicle budding, motility, docking, and fusion. In cells, 
their cycling between active, GTP-bound states and inactive, GDP-bound states is 
regulated by the action of opposing enzymes called guanine nucleotide exchange 
factors and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The substrates for most RabGAPs 
are unknown, and the potential for cross-talk between different membrane 
trafficking pathways remains uncharted territory. Rab9A and its effectors 
regulate recycling of mannose 6-phosphate receptors from late endosomes to the 
trans Golgi network. We show here that RUTBC2 is a TBC domain-containing protein 
that binds to Rab9A specifically both in vitro and in cultured cells but is not 
a GAP for Rab9A. Biochemical screening of Rab protein substrates for RUTBC2 
revealed highest GAP activity toward Rab34 and Rab36. In cells, 
membrane-associated RUTBC2 co-localizes with Rab36, and expression of wild type 
RUTBC2, but not the catalytically inactive, RUTBC2 R829A mutant, decreases the 
amount of membrane-associated Rab36 protein. These data show that RUTBC2 can act 
as a Rab36 GAP in cells and suggest that RUTBC2 links Rab9A function to Rab36 
function in the endosomal system.
