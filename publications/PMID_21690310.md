Unraveling the gene regulatory networks that govern development and function of 
the mammalian heart is critical for the rational design of therapeutic 
interventions in human heart disease. Using the Drosophila heart as a platform 
for identifying novel gene interactions leading to heart disease, we found that 
the Rho-GTPase Cdc42 cooperates with the cardiac transcription factor 
Tinman/Nkx2-5. Compound Cdc42, tinman heterozygous mutant flies exhibited 
impaired cardiac output and altered myofibrillar architecture, and adult 
heart-specific interference with Cdc42 function is sufficient to cause these 
same defects. We also identified K(+) channels, encoded by dSUR and slowpoke, as 
potential effectors of the Cdc42-Tinman interaction. To determine whether a 
Cdc42-Nkx2-5 interaction is conserved in the mammalian heart, we examined 
compound heterozygous mutant mice and found conduction system and cardiac output 
defects. In exploring the mechanism of Nkx2-5 interaction with Cdc42, we 
demonstrated that mouse Cdc42 was a target of, and negatively regulated by 
miR-1, which itself was negatively regulated by Nkx2-5 in the mouse heart and by 
Tinman in the fly heart. We conclude that Cdc42 plays a conserved role in 
regulating heart function and is an indirect target of Tinman/Nkx2-5 via miR-1.
