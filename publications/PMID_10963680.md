In the prostate gland of adult mammals, most epithelial cells are in a state of 
proliferative quiescence. Androgens regulate this effect by inducing cell cycle 
arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase. Potential mediators of this androgen-induced 
proliferative shutoff were identified by means of subtracted cDNA libraries. The 
expression pattern of one of these sequences, AS3, strongly correlated with the 
expression of the androgen-induced proliferative shutoff both temporally and 
dosewise. The AS3 gene is located on chromosome 13 q12.3, in close proximity to 
the BRCA2 gene. The loss of chromosomal regions where AS3 alleles are located 
correlates with various human cancers, including prostate. The biological effect 
of AS3 was tested in two stable cell lines, one expressing sense and another 
expressing antisense AS3 constructs, both under tetracycline regulation. S9 
cells were obtained by retroviral infection with virions containing a 
tetracycline-regulated sense AS3 construct. In these cells, sense AS3 was 
negatively regulated by tetracycline. Tetracycline withdrawal increased the 
expression of AS3 mRNA and protein. The expression of tetracycline-regulated AS3 
resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation. A4 cells were obtained by 
retroviral infection with virions containing a tetracycline-regulated antisense 
AS3 construct. Vector-driven expression of antisense-AS3 blocked the induction 
of androgen-induced endogenous AS3 mRNA and blocked the inhibitory effect of 
androgens on cell proliferation. Tetracycline-regulated expression of the empty 
vector control had no effect on cell proliferation. These experiments strongly 
suggest that AS3 is a mediator of the androgen-induced proliferative shutoff.
