A cDNA clone encoding an immunoreactive autoantigen (Ngp-1) was isolated by 
screening lambda gt11 human ductal breast tumor expression libraries with 
autologous patient serum. The complete 2.3-kb nucleotide sequence of the cDNA 
was found to contain an open reading frame that could encode a protein of 731 
amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence contains a high concentration of 
charged amino acids in the carboxy terminal quarter of the molecule, three 
guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein motifs, and a consensus nuclear 
localization signal. The arrangement and spacing of the GTP-binding protein 
motifs indicate that Ngp-1 belongs to a newly described subfamily of GTPases. 
Except for the consensus motifs, neither nucleotide sequence, nor the predicted 
amino acid sequence of the Ngp-1 cDNA showed the slightest homology to any 
vertebrate gene product sequence listed in the databases. Northern blot analysis 
showed the 2.3-kb transcript to be ubiquitously expressed at relatively low 
levels in all human tissues tested, with the highest level of expression in the 
testes. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue sections with affinity-purified 
antiserum raised against a recombinant Ngp-1 protein revealed that the antigen 
was exclusively localized to the nucleolus and nucleolar organizer regions in 
all cell types analyzed.
