Interactions between dopamine and glutamate signalling within the nucleus 
accumbens core are required for behavioural reinforcement and habit formation. 
Dopamine modulates excitatory glutamatergic signals from the prefrontal cortex, 
but the precise mechanism has not been identified. We combined optical and 
electrophysiology recordings in murine slice preparations from CB1 receptor-null 
mice and green fluorescent protein hemizygotic bacterial artificial chromosome 
transgenic mice to show how dopamine regulates glutamatergic synapses specific 
to the striatonigral and striatopallidal basal ganglia pathways. At low cortical 
frequencies, dopamine D1 receptors promote glutamate release to both D1 and D2 
receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons while D2 receptors specifically inhibit 
excitatory inputs to D2 receptor-expressing cells by decreasing exocytosis from 
cortical terminals with a low probability of release. At higher cortical 
stimulation frequencies, this dopaminergic modulation of presynaptic activity is 
occluded by adenosine and endocannabinoids. Glutamatergic inputs to both D1 and 
D2 receptor-bearing medium spiny neurons are inhibited by adenosine, released 
upon activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors and adenylyl cyclase in D1 
receptor-expressing cells. Excitatory inputs to D2 receptor-expressing cells are 
specifically inhibited by endocannabinoids, whose release is dependent on D2 and 
group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors. The convergence of excitatory and 
inhibitory modulation of corticoaccumbal activity by dopamine, adenosine and 
endocannabinoids creates subsets of corticoaccumbal inputs, selectively and 
temporally reinforces strong cortical signals through the striatonigral pathway 
while inhibiting the weak, and may provide a mechanism whereby continued 
attention might be focused on behaviourally salient information.
