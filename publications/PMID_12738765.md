RbsD is the only protein whose biochemical function is unknown among the six 
gene products of the rbs operon involved in the active transport of ribose. 
FucU, a paralogue of RbsD conserved from bacteria to human, is also the only 
protein whose function is unknown among the seven gene products of the l-fucose 
regulon. Here we report the crystal structures of Bacillus subtilis RbsD, which 
reveals a novel decameric toroidal assembly of the protein. Nuclear magnetic 
resonance and other studies on RbsD reveal that the intersubunit cleft of the 
protein binds specific forms of d-ribose, but it does not have an enzyme 
activity toward the sugar. Likewise, FucU binds l-fucose but lacks an enzyme 
activity toward this sugar. We conclude that RbsD and FucU are cytoplasmic 
sugar-binding proteins, a novel class of proteins whose functional role may lie 
in helping influx of the sugar substrates.
