The primary structure of PI31, a protein inhibitor of the 20 S proteasome, was 
deduced by cDNA cloning and sequencing. The human protein has a calculated 
molecular weight of 29,792, a value in excellent accord with 31,000, as 
estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for purified bovine PI31, 
and is not similar to any other protein in current data bases. PI31 is a 
proline-rich protein, particularly within its carboxyl-terminal half where 26% 
of the amino acids are proline. Wild-type PI31 and various truncation mutants 
were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Recombinant 
wild-type PI31 displayed structural and functional properties similar to those 
of PI31 purified from bovine red blood cells and inhibited the hydrolysis of 
protein and peptide substrates by the 20 S proteasome. Analysis of truncation 
mutants demonstrated that proteasome inhibition was conferred by the 
carboxyl-terminal proline-rich domain of PI31, which appears to have an extended 
secondary structure. Inhibition of the 20 S proteasome by PI31 involved 
formation a proteasome-PI31 complex. In addition to its direct inhibition of the 
20 S proteasome, PI31 inhibited the activation of the proteasome by each of two 
proteasome regulatory proteins, PA700 and PA28. These results suggest that PI31 
plays an important role in control of proteasome function, including that in 
ubiquitin-dependent pathways of protein degradation.
