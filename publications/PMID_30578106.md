Normal vascular development includes the formation and specification of 
arteries, veins, and intervening capillaries. Vein of Galen malformations 
(VOGMs) are among the most common and severe neonatal brain arterio-venous 
malformations, shunting arterial blood into the brain's deep venous system 
through aberrant direct connections. Exome sequencing of 55 VOGM probands, 
including 52 parent-offspring trios, revealed enrichment of rare damaging 
de novo mutations in chromatin modifier genes that play essential roles in brain 
and vascular development. Other VOGM probands harbored rare inherited damaging 
mutations in Ephrin signaling genes, including a genome-wide significant 
mutation burden in EPHB4. Inherited mutations showed incomplete penetrance and 
variable expressivity, with mutation carriers often exhibiting cutaneous 
vascular abnormalities, suggesting a two-hit mechanism. The identified mutations 
collectively account for ∼30% of studied VOGM cases. These findings provide 
insight into disease biology and may have clinical implications for risk 
assessment.

DISCUSSION

The rarity and the sporadic nature of VOGM have hindered its genetic understanding. This study, the largest trio-based genomic analysis of VOGM to date, has provided the following novel insights. First, probands exhibit an excess of damaging de novo mutations (~13% of cases); among these, mutations in chromatin modifier genes with essential roles in brain and heart development are enriched, and inferred to impact ~8% of cases. Second, there is a prevalence of rare inherited damaging mutations in the Ephrin signaling genes, including a genome-wide significant burden in EPHB4 , (another ~16% of probands). Third, inherited mutations show incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, with mutation carriers often exhibiting cutaneous vascular lesions, suggesting a two-hit mechanism. Thus, while rare mutations of large effect contribute to a significant fraction of VOGM cases, mutations in many additional genes likely contribute to disease pathogenesis. Our results support this hypothesis, suggesting potential pathogenic roles for de novo KEL mutations and rare, inherited CLDN14 mutations. However, the small number of observations and lack of replication studies require validation and extension by larger follow-up studies. Of note, analysis of rare homozygous and compound heterozygous genotypes (MAF ≤ 0.001) revealed no genes with more than one such genotype. See Supplementary Table 13 for proband information and identified likely pathogenic mutations.

Genes encoding covalent histone modifiers and chromatin remodelers have been implicated in autism ( De Rubeis et al., 2014 ), CHD ( Jin et al., 2017 ), congenital hydrocephalus (Furey et al., 2018), and other congenital disorders ( Feinberg, 2018 ). In our cohort, 4/55 probands had de novo mutations in chromatin modifiers. Enrichment of these mutations in our cohort and the conservation of the mutated residues in critical domains of protein function are consistent with each of these mutations contributing to VOGM pathogenesis. All four genes ( KMT2D , SMARCA2, SIRT1, KAT6A) are highly expressed in the developing human and murine brain ( Machida et al., 2001 ; Ogawa et al., 2011 ; Pollen et al., 2015 ; Tham et al., 2015 ) and essential for neuronal and/or vascular development ( Potente et al., 2007 ; Griffin et al., 2008 ; Van Laarhoven et al., 2015 ). SMARCA2 , KAT6A , KMT2D are mutated in Mendelian diseases that feature intellectual disability and/or epilepsy (Morin et al., 2003; Dentici et al., 2015). Mendelian phenotypes associated with KAT6A and KMT2D mutations include vascular defects and CHD (Arboleda et al., 2015; Van Laarhoven et al., 2015 ). Multiple mutated chromatin modifiers are shared among patients with CHD and autism ( Zaidi et al., 2013 ; Homsy et al., 2015 ; Jin et al., 2017 ). ~87% of CHD patients with LoF de novo mutations in chromatin modifier genes exhibit neurodevelopmental phenotypes ( Jin et al., 2017 ). These observations suggest that neurodevelopmental phenotypes in VOGM patients currently attributed to secondary CNS damage may instead reflect primary impairment from genetic mutation.

The role of Eph-B4 in A-V specification is well established in model systems ( Zhang and Hughes, 2006 ; Mosch et al., 2010 ). Heterozygous missense variants in EPHB4 have also been reported in two families with non-immune hydrops fetalis and/or atrial septal defect (HFASD; OMIM # 617300) ( Martin-Almedina et al., 2016 ) and 54 families with CM-AVM2, featuring isolated cutaneous capillary malformations (63%) and associated AVMs (35%) ( Amyere et al., 2017 ). We found damaging mutations in EPHB4 in 7% of VOGM probands in this cohort. Two of 52 prior CM-AVM2 patients with EPHB4 mutations were reported to have VOGMs ( Amyere et al., 2017 ). During preparation of this manuscript, ( Vivanti et al., 2018 ) reported 3 transmitted damaging mutations in EPBH4 among whole exome sequences from 19 VOGM case-parent trios, and two additional mutations from targeted sequencing of 32 other singleton VOGM probands. Eph-b4 antisense morpholino knockdown in zebrafish embryos disrupts angioarchitecture of the dorsal longitudinal vein, homolog of the human Vein of Galen precursor ( Aurboonyawat et al., 2007 ). We conclude that heterozygous EPHB4 germline mutations contribute to a spectrum of vascular pathology, and EPHB4 is a bona fide VOGM risk gene.

Our analysis also demonstrated enrichment of rare heterozygous damaging mutations in Ephrin signaling genes ( Supplementary Table 11 ). These genes are expressed in the embryonic human brain and vasculature ( Guo et al., 2012 ), regulate neurovascular development, and can be mapped into a single experimentally-supported STRING interactome ( Supplementary Figure 7 , see STAR Methods ). Cutaneous vascular lesions are a common hallmark of developmental vascular disorders such as RASA1- and EPHB4 -mutated CM-AVM ( Revencu et al., 2013 ; Amyere et al., 2017 ); ENG1- and ACVRL1 -mutated HHT ( Chida et al., 2013 ); and RASA1- mutated Parkes Weber syndrome ( Brouillard and Vikkula, 2007 ). We found similar cutaneous vascular lesions in VOGM kindreds harboring mutations in EFNB2 , EPHB4 , EPHA4 , ACVR1 , and CLDN14 . These findings further implicate these genes in a Eph-B4-RASA1 signaling network ( Supplementary Figure 8 ).

Transmitted VOGM-associated mutations show incomplete penetrance. Moreover, many of the identified VOGM-associated genes harboring damaging de novo and inherited mutations have been implicated in other Mendelian diseases, sometimes producing different phenotypes. These observations highlight the pleiotropy with variable expressivity resulting from these mutations.

These features have been described in other diseases. For example, haploinsufficiency for the identical chromatin modifier genes results in CHD ( Zaidi et al., 2013 ) or autism ( Iossifov et al., 2014 ), or both. Variable expressivity of VOGM and associated features could arise from environmental modifiers (Garcia et al., 2015) in concert with the rare mutations identified and/or specific genetic modifiers ( Timberlake et al., 2016 ). Co-mutation of genes in KVGAM20, VGAM100, and KVGAM45 could be important in this regard (see Supplementary Table 13 ). Sequencing additional exomes from VOGM kindreds will help clarify this issue.

The mechanisms by which syndromes characterized by abnormal A-V specification present with multifocal distributions of lesions remains poorly understood. Since 68% of VOGM families with full clinical data had capillary malformations or other uncommon cutaneous vascular lesions, and that identified mutations in probands were found in all family members with these cutaneous lesions, provide evidence linking VOGM and the cutaneous lesions to the same mutations ( Supplementary Table 13 ). This is consistent with a two-hit mechanism, in which phenotypic expression relies upon an inherited mutation and a second, post-zygotic mutation in the other wild-type allele ( Brouillard et al., 2002 ; Pagenstecher et al., 2009 ). This mechanism has been shown for other hereditary multifocal vascular malformations such as RASA1 -mutated CM-AVM1 ( Revencu et al., 2013 ), glomuvenous malformations (OMIM# 138000), cutaneomucosal venous malformation (OMIM# 600195), and cerebral cavernous malformations (OMIM# 116860) ( Pagenstecher et al., 2009 ). In this context, phenotypic expression depends on the cell types in which somatic mutations occur, and could explain the low penetrance of VOGM arising from transmitted mutations. Further work, including exome sequencing of lesional VOGM tissue, will test this hypothesis.

Although the identified de novo KEL mutations and inherited CLDN14 mutations will require further validation by WES of additional VOGM patients and functional studies, several observations suggest the importance of the current findings. KEL , encoding the Kell blood group transmembrane glycoprotein, was the only gene in our study that harbored more than one protein-altering de novo mutation (see Figure 1 ). Both the premature termination and p.Gly202Ser mutations in Kell alter its peptidase domain, shown to generate vasoactive endothelin peptides via cleavage of the endothelin-3 pro-protein ( Lee et al., 1999 ). Endothelins provide vascular-derived axonal guidance cues ( Makita et al., 2008 ) involved in Ephrin-dependent vascular patterning ( Adams and Eichmann, 2010 ).

CLDN14 was the only other gene besides EPHB4 with genome-wide significant enrichment of transmitted damaging mutations. Recessive LoF genotypes in CLDN14 cause sensorineural deafness type 29 (OMIM # 614035); in contrast, VOGM-associated CLDN14 mutations are heterozygous and D-mis, and include a recurrent missense mutation, suggesting gain-of-function or neomorphic effects, and phenotypic heterogeneity. Claudin-14 is a tight junction protein in brain epithelia and endothelial cells ( Kniesel and Wolburg, 2000 ; Wattenhofer et al., 2005 ). The regulation of tight junction formation by Claudins can impact endothelial cell permeability, integrity, and proliferation ( Morita et al., 1999 ; Gonzalez-Mariscal et al., 2007 ). The recurrent VOGM-associated Claudin-14 mutation in lies in the large 2 nd extracellular loop that likely plays a role in tight junction formation. Endothelial cells heterozygous, but not homozygous, for CLDN14 exhibit disruption of ZO-1-positive cell-cell junctions, abnormal distribution of basement membrane laminin, increased VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis, and significantly enhanced cell proliferation – suggesting a gene dosage effect ( Baker et al., 2013 ). Functional interactions have been reported between Claudins and Ephrin-B2-EphB4 bi-directional signaling ( Tanaka et al., 2005 ). In support of a possible Ephrin-Claudin-14 interaction is the fact that one of the families harboring the recurrent Claudin-14 mutation p.Val143Met had CM-AVM-like cutaneous vascular lesions that segregated with the mutation in family members (see Figure 5 , panel B ). The role of Claudin-14 in potential EphB4-dependent A-V specification will be a topic of future investigation.

These findings suggest mutation carrier offspring may be at increased risk of VOGMs, as well as capillary malformations and potentially other AVMs. However, not all mutation carriers develop capillary malformations, making absence of capillary malformations an unreliable clinical marker for transmission risk in affected families. These observations suggest the importance of family history and mutation-based screening for risk assessment. The narrow developmental window of gestational weeks 6–11 during which PVM fistulas form ( Raybaud et al., 1989 ) poses a challenge to improved early therapeutic strategies for VOGM. Thus, attempted diagnosis with intention to treat must occur before the safe gestational age threshold for amniocentesis ( Shulman et al., 1994 ). These difficulties highlight the need for continued genetic research on VOGM, with focus on mechanistic implications of recently discovered VOGM-associated mutations.

Eph-B4 kinase domain mutations remove inhibition of downstream RAS/MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signaling cascades ( Kim et al., 2002 ; Salaita and Groves, 2010 ; Xiao et al., 2012 ). We showed select VOGM-associated Eph-B4 mutations result in decreased binding of Eph-B4 to RASA1(see Figure 4 , panel E ). PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 up-regulation has been noted in capillary malformations of RASA1 -mutant CM-AVM1 patients ( Kawasaki et al., 2014 ). Therapy targeting Eph-B4-Ras-GAP-mTOR signaling may represent a viable therapeutic approach for VOGM and, perhaps, CM-AVM spectrum lesions.
