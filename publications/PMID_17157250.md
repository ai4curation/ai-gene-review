The Ca2+ -activated K+ channel KCa3.1 is required for Ca2+ influx and the 
subsequent activation of B and T cells. Inhibitors of KCa3.1 are in development 
to treat autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection, underscoring the 
importance in understanding how these channels are regulated. We show that 
nucleoside diphosphate kinase B (NDPK-B), a mammalian histidine kinase, 
functions downstream of PI(3)P to activate KCa3.1. NDPK-B directly binds and 
activates KCa3.1 by phosphorylating histidine 358 in the carboxyl terminus of 
KCa3.1. Endogenous NDPK-B is also critical for KCa3.1 channel activity and the 
subsequent activation of CD4 T cells. These findings provide one of the best 
examples whereby histidine phosphorylation regulates a biological process in 
mammals, and provide an example whereby a channel is regulated by histidine 
phosphorylation. The critical role for NDPK-B in the reactivation of CD4 T cells 
indicates that understanding NDPK-B regulation should uncover novel pathways 
required for T cell activation.
