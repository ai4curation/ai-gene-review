We have employed cDNA cloning to deduce the complete primary structures of p44.5 
and p55, two subunits of PA700, a 700-kDa multisubunit regulatory complex of the 
human 26S proteasome. These polypeptides consist of 422 and 456 amino acids with 
calculated molecular masses of 47463 and 52903, and isoelectric points of 6.06 
and 7.56, respectively. Computer-assisted homology analysis revealed high 
sequence similarities of p44.5 and p55 with yeast proteins whose functions are 
yet unknown. Disruption of the yeast genes, termed NAS4 and NAS5 (non-ATPase 
subunits 4 and 5), resulted in lethality, indicating that each of the two 
subunits is essential for proliferation of yeast cells.
