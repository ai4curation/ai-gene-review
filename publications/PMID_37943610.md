Comment in
    Hypomorphic human SEL1L and HRD1 variants uncouple multilayered 
ER-associated degradation machinery.

Recent studies using cell type-specific knockout mouse models have improved our 
understanding of the pathophysiological relevance of suppressor of 
lin-12-like-HMG-CoA reductase degradation 1 (SEL1L-HRD1) endoplasmic 
reticulum-associated (ER-associated) degradation (ERAD); however, its importance 
in humans remains unclear, as no disease variant has been identified. Here, we 
report the identification of 3 biallelic missense variants of SEL1L and HRD1 (or 
SYVN1) in 6 children from 3 independent families presenting with developmental 
delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, facial dysmorphisms, hypotonia, 
and/or ataxia. These SEL1L (p.Gly585Asp, p.Met528Arg) and HRD1 (p.Pro398Leu) 
variants were hypomorphic and impaired ERAD function at distinct steps of ERAD, 
including substrate recruitment (SEL1L p.Gly585Asp), SEL1L-HRD1 complex 
formation (SEL1L p.Met528Arg), and HRD1 activity (HRD1 p.Pro398Leu). Our study 
not only provides insights into the structure-function relationship of 
SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD, but also establishes the importance of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in 
humans.
