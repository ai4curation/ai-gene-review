INSIGs are proteins that underlie sterol regulation of the mammalian proteins 
SCAP (SREBP cleavage activating protein) and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR). The 
INSIGs perform distinct tasks in the regulation of these effectors: they promote 
ER retention of SCAP, but ubiquitin-mediated degradation of HMGR. Two questions 
that arise from the discovery and study of INSIGs are: how do they perform these 
distinct tasks, and how general are the actions of INSIGs in biology? We now 
show that the yeast INSIG homologs NSG1 and NSG2 function to control the 
stability of yeast Hmg2p, the HMGR isozyme that undergoes regulated 
ubiquitination. Yeast Nsgs inhibit degradation of Hmg2p in a highly specific 
manner, by directly interacting with the sterol-sensing domain (SSD)-containing 
transmembrane region. Nsg1p functions naturally to limit degradation of Hmg2p 
when both proteins are at native levels, indicating a long-standing functional 
interplay between these two classes of proteins. One way to unify the known, 
disparate actions of INSIGs is to view them as known adaptations of a chaperone 
dedicated to SSD-containing client proteins.
