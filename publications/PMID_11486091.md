The interactive regulation between clock genes is central for oscillator 
function. Here, we show interactions between the Arabidopsis clock genes LATE 
ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), and TIMING OF 
CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1). The MYB transcription factors LHY and CCA1 negatively 
regulate TOC1 expression. We show that both proteins bind to a region in the 
TOC1 promoter that is critical for its clock regulation. Conversely, TOC1 
appears to participate in the positive regulation of LHY and CCA1 expression. 
Our results indicate that these interactions form a loop critical for clock 
function in Arabidopsis.
