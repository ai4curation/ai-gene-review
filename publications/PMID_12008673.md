To provide a bridge between in vivo and in vitro studies of eukaryotic 
translation initiation, we have developed a reconstituted translation initiation 
system using components from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have 
purified a minimal set of initiation factors (elFs) that, together with yeast 
80S ribosomes, GTP, and initiator methionyl-tRNA, are sufficient to assemble 
active initiation complexes on a minimal mRNA template. The kinetics of various 
steps in the pathway of initiation complex assembly and the formation of the 
first peptide bond in vitro have been explored. The formation of active 
initiation complexes in this system is dependent on ribosomes, mRNA, Met-tRNAi, 
GTP hydrolysis, elF1, elF1A, elF2, elF5, and elF5B. Our data indicate that elF1 
and elF1A both facilitate the binding of the elF2 x GTP x Met-tRNAi complex to 
the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 43S complex. elF5 stimulates a step after 
43S complex formation, consistent with its proposed role in activating GTP 
hydrolysis by elF2 upon initiation codon recognition. The presence of elF5B is 
required for the joining of the 40S and 60S subunits to form the 80S initiation 
complex. The step at which each of these factors acts in this reconstituted 
system is in agreement with previous data from in vivo studies and work using 
reconstituted mammalian systems, indicating that the system recapitulates 
fundamental events in translation initiation in eukaryotic cells. This system 
should allow us to couple powerful yeast genetic and molecular biological 
experiments with in vitro kinetic and biophysical experiments, yielding a better 
understanding of the molecular mechanics of this central, complex process.
