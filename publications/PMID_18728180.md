Since cdc48 mutants were isolated by the first genetic screens for cell division 
cycle (cdc) mutants in yeast, the requirement of the chaperone-like ATPase 
Cdc48/p97 during cell division has remained unclear. Here, we discover an 
unanticipated function for Caenorhabditis elegans CDC-48 in DNA replication 
linked to cell cycle control. Our analysis of the CDC-48(UFD-1/NPL-4) complex 
identified a general role in S phase progression of mitotic cells essential for 
embryonic cell division and germline development of adult worms. These 
developmental defects result from activation of the DNA replication checkpoint 
caused by replication stress. Similar to loss of replication licensing factors, 
DNA content is strongly reduced in worms depleted for CDC-48, UFD-1, and NPL-4. 
In addition, these worms show decreased DNA synthesis and hypersensitivity 
toward replication blocking agents. Our findings identified a role for 
CDC-48(UFD-1/NPL-4) in DNA replication, which is important for cell cycle 
progression and genome stability.
