The locally restricted recruitment of the multisubunit origin recognition 
complex (ORC) to eukaryotic chromosomes defines the position of origins of DNA 
replication. In budding yeast and metazoans the DNA binding activity of ORC is 
stimulated by ATP and requires an AAA+-type nucleotide binding domain in the 
largest subunit. Little else is known about the mechanisms behind the ATP 
requirement for ORC in its initiator function and, specifically, the relevance 
of nucleotide binding domains present on other subunits. Here we show that ATP 
is required for specific subunit interactions in the human ORC, with the Orc4 
subunit playing a critical role in this dynamic process. ATP is essential for 
the maintenance of ORC integrity and facilitates complex formation. Thus, 
besides its previously identified role in DNA binding, ATP serves also as a 
structural cofactor for human ORC.
