Dark-grown transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings expressing the C-terminal domains 
(CCT) of the cryptochrome (CRY) blue light photoreceptors exhibit features that 
are normally associated only with light-grown seedlings, indicating that the 
signaling mechanism of Arabidopsis CRY is mediated through CCT. The phenotypic 
properties mediated by CCT are remarkably similar to those of the constitutive 
photomorphogenic1 (cop1) mutants. Here we show that Arabidopsis cryptochrome 1 
(CRY1) and its C-terminal domain (CCT1) interacted strongly with the COP1 
protein. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that CRY1 was bound to COP1 in 
extracts from both dark- and light-grown Arabidopsis. An interaction also was 
observed between the C-terminal domain of Arabidopsis phytochrome B and COP1, 
suggesting that phytochrome signaling also proceeds, at least in part, through 
direct interaction with COP1. These findings give new insight into the initial 
step in light signaling in Arabidopsis, providing a molecular link between the 
blue light receptor, CRY1, and COP1, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis.

Abstract

Dark-grown transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings expressing the C-terminal domains (CCT) of the cryptochrome (CRY) blue light photoreceptors exhibit features that are normally associated only with light-grown seedlings, indicating that the signaling mechanism of Arabidopsis CRY is mediated through CCT. The phenotypic properties mediated by CCT are remarkably similar to those of the constitutive photomorphogenic1 ( cop1 ) mutants. Here we show that Arabidopsis cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) and its C-terminal domain (CCT1) interacted strongly with the COP1 protein. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that CRY1 was bound to COP1 in extracts from both dark- and light-grown Arabidopsis. An interaction also was observed between the C-terminal domain of Arabidopsis phytochrome B and COP1, suggesting that phytochrome signaling also proceeds, at least in part, through direct interaction with COP1. These findings give new insight into the initial step in light signaling in Arabidopsis, providing a molecular link between the blue light receptor, CRY1, and COP1, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis.

INTRODUCTION

The Arabidopsis cryptochromes (CRY1 and CRY2) mediate a variety of blue light–induced responses, including hypocotyl shortening, cotyledon expansion, and anthocyanin production ( Ahmad and Cashmore, 1993 ; Ahmad et al., 1998a ; Lin et al., 1998 ). CRY1 and CRY2 share sequence similarity to photolyases, a family of proteins that catalyze the repair of UV light–damaged DNA ( Sancar, 1994 ). However, the Arabidopsis cryptochromes have a distinguishing C-terminal domain that is absent in photolyases ( Ahmad and Cashmore, 1993 ; Cashmore et al., 1999 ) and lack photolyase activity ( Ahmad and Cashmore, 1993 ; Lin et al., 1995 ).

Several lines of evidence indicate an interaction between cryptochromes and phytochromes, the red/far-red photoreceptors in plants ( Mohr, 1994 ). In Arabidopsis, a synergism has been described for the activity of the two classes of photoreceptors ( Casal and Mazzella, 1998 ). Furthermore, Arabidopsis CRY1 has been shown to be phosphorylated by the protein kinase activity of oat phyA, and select cry1 alleles are early flowering ( Ahmad et al., 1998b ), a property like that of mutants in the PHYB gene ( Bagnall et al., 1995 ). Similarly, the late flowering phenotype of Arabidopsis cry2 alleles is postulated to reflect the wild-type CRY2 protein negatively affecting phyB signaling ( Mockler et al., 1999 ). CRY2 and phyB were found to interact in extracts of transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing CRY2, and by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, these same photoreceptors were shown to be associated in nuclear speckles that form in a light-dependent manner ( Mas et al., 2000 ).

Insight into the signaling pathway of Arabidopsis cryptochrome was obtained through the demonstration that transgenic plants expressing the C-terminal domain of either CRY1 (CCT1) or CRY2 (CCT2) fused to β-glucuronidase (GUS) display a constitutive photomorphogenic (COP) phenotype ( Yang et al., 2000 ). These data suggest that CRY1 and CRY2 signaling in response to light activation is mediated through their C-terminal domains. This phenotype was not observed for transgenic plants expressing mutant CCT1 proteins corresponding to loss-of-function cry1 alleles, indicating that the COP phenotype observed for CCT is physiologically meaningful. In view of the similarity of the CCT-mediated phenotype to that of mutants of both COP1 and the COP9 signalosome complex, it was proposed that CRY signaling may involve a direct interaction with one of these COP proteins.

The COP / DET / FUS loci are pleiotropic negative regulators of plant development ( Chory et al., 1989 ; Deng et al., 1991 ; Misera et al., 1994 ; Kwok et al., 1996 ). The COP1 gene is one of the best characterized of these, with dark-grown mutant cop1 seedlings displaying a COP phenotype that includes shortened hypocotyls, anthocyanin production, and chloroplast development, which are characteristic of light-grown seedlings ( Deng et al., 1991 ). Some cop1 mutants are adult lethal, whereas others develop plants with severely reduced rosette size and low fertility ( Deng and Quail, 1992 ; McNellis et al., 1994 ). The COP1 gene encodes a protein with three distinguishing structurally recognized domains: an N-terminal ring finger domain, a coiled-coil region, and C-terminal WD40 repeats ( Deng et al., 1992 ; McNellis et al., 1994 ).

In the dark, COP1 localizes to the nucleus, whereas in the light, it localizes to the cytoplasm ( von Arnim and Deng, 1994 ). Other COP loci include those that encode members of the COP9 signalosome. In contrast to COP1, this COP9 signalosome complex is localized constitutively to the nucleus ( Chamovitz et al., 1996 ), where it is required for the accumulation of COP1 ( Kwok et al., 1998 ; Osterlund et al., 1999 ). In dark-grown seedlings, the COP1 protein negatively regulates HY5, a bZIP transcription factor ( Oyama et al., 1997 ; Ang et al., 1998 ; Torii et al., 1998 ). COP1 binds to HY5, and this interaction targets HY5 for proteasome-mediated degradation in the nucleus ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ).

Mutations of COP1 , and those of genes encoding members of the COP9 signalosome complex, are epistatic to mutations in CRY and PHY genes in both dark- and light-grown seedlings ( Ang and Deng, 1994 ; Wei et al., 1994 ). These genetic data indicate that photoreceptor function is not required for the photomorphogenic phenotype characteristic of the cop mutants. These results have been interpreted to suggest that the COP proteins function as negative regulators downstream, and on the direct signaling pathway, of the photoreceptor light-signaling pathway ( Ang and Deng, 1994 ; Osterlund et al., 1999 ).

Here it is demonstrated that CCT1 and the full-length CRY1 protein interact physically with the COP1 protein both in the yeast two-hybrid system and in binding studies in vitro. Furthermore, we show by coimmunoprecipitation studies that CRY1 was bound to COP1 in extracts from both dark- and light-grown Arabidopsis. We interpret these findings to indicate that the signaling mechanism of the Arabidopsis CRY1 protein involves direct interaction with the COP1 protein. Such an interaction is presumed to counteract, in a blue light–dependent manner, the negative regulatory properties of COP1, thus initiating the photomorphogenic processes mediated by the CRY1 photoreceptor.

DISCUSSION

We demonstrated previously that the signaling mechanism of Arabidopsis cryptochromes is mediated through the C-terminal domain ( Yang et al., 2000 ). On fusion with GUS, the CCT of both CRY1 and CRY2 mediates a constitutive light response. In this report, we further our understanding of the Arabidopsis cryptochrome signaling mechanism by demonstrating, in both yeast and Arabidopsis, a direct physical interaction between Arabidopsis CRY1 and COP1. The physiological significance of our findings is attested to by the demonstration that certain mutations, corresponding to loss-of-function alleles of cry1 or cop1 , affect this interaction negatively. We demonstrate in Arabidopsis and in yeast that CRY1 binds to COP1 in both dark- and light-grown samples. We propose from these observations that blue light–dependent CRY1 signaling involves a modification of this CRY1–COP1 interaction that counteracts the repression of photomorphogenesis mediated by COP1 in the dark. These conclusions are consistent with earlier genetic studies demonstrating that the constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype of cop1 mutants is epistatic to cry1 / hy4 mutants in both light and dark ( Ang and Deng, 1994 ).
