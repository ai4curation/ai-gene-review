In higher plants, microtubules (MTs) show dynamic structural changes during cell 
cycle and development progression. A precise control of MT nucleation at 
dispersed sites is one way used to regulate the cytoskeletal organization. Some 
gamma-tubulin complex proteins (GCPs) were previously identified in Arabidopsis 
thaliana (At). They are directly involved in the nucleation process. 
Nevertheless, no additional player which may anchor the nucleating complex or 
regulate the nucleation activity has been found in plant cells so far. 
Therefore, our aim was the identification of Arabidopsis proteins interacting 
with MT nucleating complexes and particularly with AtGCP3. Performing a yeast 
two-hybrid screen, we discovered a new protein which we called AtGCP3 
Interacting Protein 1 (AtGIP1). The possible role of this protein during the 
nucleation process is discussed.
