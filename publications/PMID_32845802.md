Vps13 is a highly conserved lipid transfer protein found at multiple 
interorganelle membrane contact sites where it mediates distinct processes. In 
yeast, recruitment of Vps13 to different contact sites occurs via various 
partner proteins. In humans, four VPS13 family members, A-D, are associated with 
different diseases. In particular, vps13A mutants result in the 
neurodegenerative disorder Chorea-Acanthocytosis (ChAc). ChAc phenotypes 
resemble those of McLeod Syndrome, caused by mutations in the XK gene, 
suggesting that XK could be a partner protein for VPS13A. XK does, in fact, 
exhibit hallmarks of a VPS13A partner: it forms a complex with VPS13A in human 
cells and, when overexpressed, relocalizes VPS13A from lipid droplets to 
subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum. Introduction of two different ChAc 
disease-linked missense mutations into VPS13A prevents this XK-induced 
relocalization. These results suggest that dysregulation of a VPS13A-XK complex 
is the common basis for ChAc and McLeod Syndrome.
