The transcription factor Bach2, a member of the BTB-basic region leucine zipper 
(bZip) factor family, binds to a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate 
(TPA)-responsive element and the related Maf-recognition element (MARE) by 
forming homodimers or heterodimers with Maf-related transcription factors. Bach2 
regulates transcription by binding to these elements. To understand the function 
in hematopoiesis, we isolated a cDNA clone for human Bach2 (BACH2) encoding a 
protein of 841 amino acid residues with a deduced amino acid sequence having 
89.5% identity to mouse homolog. Among human hematopoietic cell lines, BACH2 is 
expressed abundantly only in some B-lymphocytic cell lines. RT-PCR analysis of 
hematopoietic cells revealed that BACH2 mRNA is expressed in primary B-cells. 
Enforced expression of BACH2 in a human Burkitt cell line, RAJI that does not 
express endogenous BACH2, resulted in marked reduction of clonogenic activity, 
indicating that BACH2 possesses an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. By 
fluorescent in situ hybridization, the BACH2 gene was localized to chromosome 
6q15. Because deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q) is one of the 
commonest chromosomal alterations in human B-cell lymphoma, we examined for the 
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the BACH2 gene in human B-cell non-Hodgkin's 
lymphomas (NHL). Among 25 informative cases, five (20%) showed LOH. These 
results indicate that BACH2 plays important roles in regulation of B cell 
development.
