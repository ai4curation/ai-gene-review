YES-associated protein 2 (YAP2) transcriptional regulator drives a multitude of 
cellular processes, including the newly discovered Hippo tumor suppressor 
pathway, by virtue of the ability of its WW domains to bind and recruit 
PPXY-containing ligands to specific subcellular compartments. Herein, we employ 
an array of biophysical tools to investigate allosteric communication between 
the WW tandem domains of YAP2. Our data show that the WW tandem domains of YAP2 
negatively cooperate when binding to their cognate ligands. Moreover, the 
molecular origin of such negative cooperativity lies in an unfavorable entropic 
contribution to the overall free energy relative to ligand binding to isolated 
WW domains. Consistent with this notion, the WW tandem domains adopt a fixed 
spatial orientation such that the WW1 domain curves outwards and stacks onto the 
binding groove of the WW2 domain, thereby sterically hindering ligand binding to 
both itself and its tandem partner. Although ligand binding to both WW domains 
disrupts such interdomain stacking interaction, they reorient themselves and 
adopt an alternative fixed spatial orientation in the liganded state by virtue 
of their ability to engage laterally so as to allow their binding grooves to 
point outwards and away from each other. In short, while the ability of WW 
tandem domains to aid ligand binding is well documented, our demonstration that 
they may also be subject to negative binding cooperativity represents a paradigm 
shift in our understanding of the molecular action of this ubiquitous family of 
protein modules.
