Defense against pests and pathogens is a fundamental process controlled by 
similar molecular mechanisms in all flowering plants. Using Arabidopsis thaliana 
as a model, steps of the signal transduction pathways that link pathogen 
recognition to defense activation have been identified and corresponding genes 
have been characterized. Defense signaling (DS) genes are functional candidates 
for controlling natural quantitative variation of resistance to plant pathogens. 
Nineteen Arabidopsis genes operating in defense signaling cascades were 
selected. Solanaceae EST (expressed sequence tag) databases were employed to 
identify the closest homologs of potato (Solanum tuberosum). Sixteen novel DS 
potato homologs were positioned on the molecular maps. Five DS homologs mapped 
close to known quantitative resistance loci (QRL) against the oomycete 
Phytophthora infestans causing late blight and the bacterium Erwinia carotovora 
subsp. atroseptica causing blackleg of stems and tuber soft rot. The five genes 
are positional candidates for QRL and are highly sequence related to Arabidopsis 
genes AtSGT1b, AtPAD4, and AtAOS. Full-length complementary DNA and genomic 
sequences were obtained for potato genes StSGT1, StPAD4, and StEDS1, the latter 
being a putative interactor of StPAD4. Our results form the basis for further 
studies on the contributions of these candidate genes to natural variation of 
potato disease resistance.
