Little is known about the role of protein quality control in the inner ear. We 
now report selective cochlear degeneration in mice deficient in Fbx2, a 
ubiquitin ligase F-box protein with specificity for high-mannose glycoproteins 
(Yoshida et al., 2002). Originally described as a brain-enriched protein 
(Erhardt et al., 1998), Fbx2 is also highly expressed in the organ of Corti, in 
which it has been called organ of Corti protein 1 (Thalmann et al., 1997). Mice 
with targeted deletion of Fbxo2 develop age-related hearing loss beginning at 2 
months. Cellular degeneration begins in the epithelial support cells of the 
organ of Corti and is accompanied by changes in cellular membrane integrity and 
early increases in connexin 26, a cochlear gap junction protein previously shown 
to interact with Fbx2 (Henzl et al., 2004). Progressive degeneration includes 
hair cells and the spiral ganglion, but the brain itself is spared despite 
widespread CNS expression of Fbx2. Cochlear Fbx2 binds Skp1, the common binding 
partner for F-box proteins, and is an unusually abundant inner ear protein. 
Whereas cochlear Skp1 levels fall in parallel with the loss of Fbx2, other 
components of the canonical SCF (Skp1, Cullin1, F-box, Rbx1) ubiquitin ligase 
complex remain unchanged and show little if any complex formation with 
Fbx2/Skp1, suggesting that cochlear Fbx2 and Skp1 form a novel, heterodimeric 
complex. Our findings demonstrate that components of protein quality control are 
essential for inner ear homeostasis and implicate Fbx2 and Skp1 as potential 
genetic modifiers in age-related hearing loss.
