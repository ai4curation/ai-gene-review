The PTEN and TSC2 tumor suppressors inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
signaling and are defective in distinct hamartoma syndromes. Using mouse 
genetics, we find that Pten and Tsc2 act synergistically to suppress the 
severity of a subset of tumors specific to loss of each of these genes. 
Interestingly, we find that the slow-growing tumors specific to Tsc2+/- mice 
exhibit defects in signaling downstream of Akt. However, Pten haploinsufficiency 
restores Akt signaling in these tumors and dramatically enhances their severity. 
This study demonstrates that attenuation of the PI3K-Akt pathway in tumors 
lacking TSC2 contributes to their benign nature.
