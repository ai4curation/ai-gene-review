Translocations of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene have been described 
in anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCLs) and in stromal tumors. The most 
frequent translocation, t(2;5), generates the fusion protein nucleophosmin 
(NPM)-ALK with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Along with transformation, 
NPM-ALK induces morphologic changes in fibroblasts and lymphoid cells, 
suggesting a direct role of ALK in cell shaping. In this study, we used a 
mass-spectrometry-based proteomic approach to search for proteins involved in 
cytoskeleton remodeling and identified p130Cas (p130 Crk-associated substrate) 
as a novel interactor of NPM-ALK. In 293 cells and in fibroblasts as well as in 
human ALK-positive lymphoma cell lines, NPM-ALK was able to bind p130Cas and to 
induce its phosphorylation. Both of the effects were dependent on ALK kinase 
activity and on the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 
(Grb2), since no binding or phosphorylation was found with the kinase-dead 
mutant NPM-ALK(K210R) or in the presence of a Grb2 dominant-negative protein. 
Phosphorylation of p130Cas by NPM-ALK was partially independent from Src 
(tyrosine kinase pp60c-src) kinase activity, as it was still detectable in 
Syf-/- cells. Finally, p130Cas-/- (also known as Bcar1-/-) fibroblasts 
expressing NPM-ALK showed impaired actin filament depolymerization and were no 
longer transformed compared with wild-type cells, indicating an essential role 
of p130Cas activation in ALK-mediated transformation.
