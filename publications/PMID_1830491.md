A full length cDNA clone of the alpha subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase (EC 
3.6.1.34) has been isolated from a cDNA library prepared from LX-1 human tumor 
cells in the lambda-Zap vector. The clone is 1883 base pairs (bp) in length and 
contains a 1659 bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 553 residues. 
The deduced amino acid sequence is highly homologous to ATP synthase from 
several other species.
