C. elegans insulin-like signaling regulates metabolism, development, and life 
span. This signaling pathway negatively regulates the activity of the forkhead 
transcription factor DAF-16. daf-16 encodes multiple isoforms that are expressed 
in distinct tissue types and are probable orthologs of human FKHRL1, FKHR, and 
AFX. We show that human FKHRL1 can partially replace DAF-16, proving the 
orthology. In mammalian cells, insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling 
activate AKT/PKB kinase to negatively regulate the nuclear localization of 
DAF-16 homologs (reviewed in ). We show that the absence of AKT consensus sites 
on DAF-16 is sufficient to cause dauer arrest in daf-2(+) animals, proving that 
daf-16 is the major output of insulin signaling in C. elegans. FKHR, FKRHL1, and 
AFX may similarly be the major outputs of mammalian insulin signaling. daf-2 
insulin signaling, via AKT kinases, negatively regulates DAF-16 by controlling 
its nuclear localization. Surprisingly, we find that daf-7 TGF-beta signaling 
also regulates DAF-16 nuclear localization specifically at the time when the 
animal makes the commitment between diapause and reproductive development. 
daf-16 function is supported by the combined action of two distinct 
promoter/enhancer elements, whereas the coding sequences of two major DAF-16 
isoforms are interchangeable. Together, these observations suggest that the 
combined effects of transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of daf-16 
transduce insulin-like signals in C. elegans and perhaps more generally.
