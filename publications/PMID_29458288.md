During macroautophagy/autophagy, mammalian Atg8-family proteins undergo 2 
proteolytic processing events. The first exposes a COOH-terminal glycine used in 
the conjugation of these proteins to lipids on the phagophore, the precursor to 
the autophagosome, whereas the second releases the lipid. The ATG4 family of 
proteases drives both cleavages, but how ATG4 proteins distinguish between 
soluble and lipid-anchored Atg8 proteins is not well understood. In a fully 
reconstituted delipidation assay, we establish that the physical anchoring of 
mammalian Atg8-family proteins in the membrane dramatically shifts the way ATG4 
proteases recognize these substrates. Thus, while ATG4B is orders of magnitude 
faster at processing a soluble unprimed protein, all 4 ATG4 proteases can be 
activated to similar enzymatic activities on lipid-attached substrates. The 
recognition of lipidated but not soluble substrates is sensitive to a 
COOH-terminal LIR motif both in vitro and in cells. We suggest a model whereby 
ATG4B drives very fast priming of mammalian Atg8 proteins, whereas delipidation 
is inherently slow and regulated by all ATG4 homologs.
