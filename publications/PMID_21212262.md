Mammalian Sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1) protein kinase plays an important role 
in the apoptosis induced by a variety of stresses. The MST1 is a 
serine/threonine kinase that is activated upon apoptotic stimulation, which in 
turn activates its downstream targets, JNK/p38, histone H2B and FOXO. It has 
been reported that overexpression of MST1 initiates apoptosis by activating p53. 
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying MST1-p53 signaling during apoptosis 
are unclear. Here, we report that MST1 promotes genotoxic agent-induced 
apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. We found that MST1 increases p53 
acetylation and transactivation by inhibiting the deacetylation of Sirtuin 1 
(Sirt1) and its interaction with p53 and that Sirt1 can be phosphorylated by 
MST1 leading to the inhibition of Sirt1 activity. Collectively, these findings 
define a novel regulatory mechanism involving the phosphorylation of Sirt1 by 
MST1 kinase which leads to p53 activation, with implications for our 
understanding of signaling mechanisms during DNA damage-induced apoptosis.
