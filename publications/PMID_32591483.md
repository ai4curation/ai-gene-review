Mitochondrial biogenesis requires efficient sorting of various proteins into 
different mitochondrial sub-compartments, mediated by dedicated protein 
machinery present in the outer and inner membrane. Among them, the TIM22 complex 
enables the integration of complex membrane proteins with internal targeting 
signals into the inner membrane. Although the Tim22 protein forms the core of 
the complex, the dynamic recruitment of subunits to the channel is still 
enigmatic. In this study, we highlight that the intermembrane space (IMS) and 
transmembrane 4 (TM4) regions of Tim22 are critically required for interactions 
with the membrane-embedded subunits, including Tim54, Tim18, and Sdh3, and 
thereby maintain the functional architecture of the TIM22 translocase. 
Furthermore, we find that the TM1 and TM2 regions of Tim22 are important for 
association with Tim18, whereas TM3 is exclusively required for the interaction 
with Sdh3. Moreover, impairment of TIM22 complex assembly influences its 
translocase activity, the mitochondrial network, and the viability of cells 
lacking mitochondrial DNA. Overall, our findings provide compelling evidence 
highlighting the significance of conserved regions of Tim22 that are important 
for the maintenance of the TIM22 complex and mitochondrial integrity.
