Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles housing a variety of essential biochemical 
pathways. Peroxisome dysfunction causes a spectrum of human diseases known as 
peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD). Although much is known regarding the 
mechanism of peroxisome biogenesis, it is still unclear how peroxisome 
dysfunction leads to the disease state. Several recent studies have shown that 
mutations in Drosophila peroxin genes cause phenotypes similar to those seen in 
humans with PBDs suggesting that Drosophila might be a useful system to model 
PBDs. We have analyzed the proteome of Drosophila to identify the proteins 
involved in peroxisomal biogenesis and homeostasis as well as metabolic enzymes 
that function within the organelle. The subcellular localization of five of 
these predicted peroxisomal proteins was confirmed. Similar to Caenorhabditis 
elegans, Drosophila appears to only utilize the peroxisome targeting signal type 
1 system for matrix protein import. This work will further our understanding of 
peroxisomes in Drosophila and add to the usefulness of this emerging model 
system.
