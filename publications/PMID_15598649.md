CLN3 is a transmembrane protein with a predominant localization in lysosomes in 
non-neuronal cells but is also found in endosomes and the synaptic region in 
neuronal cells. Mutations in the CLN3 gene result in juvenile neuronal ceroid 
lipofuscinosis or Batten disease, which currently is the most common cause of 
childhood dementia. We have recently reported that the lysosomal targeting of 
CLN3 is facilitated by two targeting motifs: a dileucine-type motif in a 
cytoplasmic loop domain and an unusual motif in the carboxyl-terminal 
cytoplasmic tail comprising a methionine and a glycine separated by nine amino 
acids (Kyttala, A., Ihrke, G., Vesa, J., Schell, M. J., and Luzio, J. P. (2004) 
Mol. Biol. Cell 15, 1313-1323). In the present study, we investigated the 
pathways and mechanisms of CLN3 sorting using biochemical binding assays and 
immunofluorescence methods. The dileucine motif of CLN3 bound both AP-1 and AP-3 
in vitro, and expression of mutated CLN3 in AP-1- or AP-3-deficient mouse 
fibroblasts showed that both adaptor complexes are required for sequential 
sorting of CLN3 via this motif. Our data indicate the involvement of complex 
sorting machinery in the trafficking of CLN3 and emphasize the diversity of 
parallel and sequential sorting pathways in the trafficking of membrane 
proteins.
