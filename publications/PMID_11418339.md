In the past two years, the focus of studies of the genes controlling expression 
of defense responses in Arabidopsis has shifted from the identification of 
mutants to gene isolation and the ordering of genes within branches of the 
signal transduction networks. It is now clear that gene-for-gene resistance can 
be mediated through at least three genetically distinguishable pathways. 
Additional genes affecting salicylic-acid-dependent signaling have been 
identified, and double-mutant analyses have begun to reveal the order in which 
they act. Genes required for jasmonic-acid-dependent signaling and for induced 
systemic resistance have also been identified.
