GCN5 is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) originally identified in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae and required for transcription of specific genes within chromatin as 
part of the SAGA (SPT-ADA-GCN5 acetylase) coactivator complex. Mammalian cells 
have two distinct GCN5 homologs (PCAF and GCN5L) that have been found in three 
different SAGA-like complexes (PCAF complex, TFTC [TATA-binding-protein-free 
TAF(II)-containing complex], and STAGA [SPT3-TAF(II)31-GCN5L acetylase]). The 
composition and roles of these mammalian HAT complexes are still poorly 
characterized. Here, we present the purification and characterization of the 
human STAGA complex. We show that STAGA contains homologs of most yeast SAGA 
components, including two novel human proteins with histone-like folds and 
sequence relationships to yeast SPT7 and ADA1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 
STAGA has acetyl coenzyme A-dependent transcriptional coactivator functions from 
a chromatin-assembled template in vitro and associates in HeLa cells with 
spliceosome-associated protein 130 (SAP130) and DDB1, two structurally related 
proteins. SAP130 is a component of the splicing factor SF3b that associates with 
U2 snRNP and is recruited to prespliceosomal complexes. DDB1 (p127) is a 
UV-damaged-DNA-binding protein that is involved, as part of a complex with DDB2 
(p48), in nucleotide excision repair and the hereditary disease xeroderma 
pigmentosum. Our results thus suggest cellular roles of STAGA in chromatin 
modification, transcription, and transcription-coupled processes through direct 
physical interactions with sequence-specific transcription activators and with 
components of the splicing and DNA repair machineries.
