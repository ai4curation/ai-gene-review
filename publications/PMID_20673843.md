Of eight million oocytes formed in fetal ovaries, only 400 are ovulated and the 
rest are degraded via apoptosis. Studies in rodents suggest an important role 
for Bok and Bcl-X(L) in ovarian apoptosis, but their expression patterns and 
roles in human ovaries are not well known. Protein expression of Bok and 
Bcl-X(L) as well as the death pathway effectors TNF and caspase-3 were 
determined in an important collection of samples consisting of human fetal and 
adult ovaries. A penetrant expression of Bok, Bcl-X(L), TNF and full length and 
cleaved caspase-3 were characterized in fetal ovaries, with specific patterns in 
oocytes and pre-granulosa/granulosa cells. Bok and Bcl-X(L) were detected also 
in adult ovaries. Lentiviral shRNA delivery demonstrated that loss of Bok 
markedly reduces vulnerability to apoptosis and, conversely, loss of Bcl-X(L) 
increases apoptosis in human granulosa tumour cell line. The results suggest 
important roles for Bok and Bcl-X(L) in human ovarian development, follicle 
maturation and apoptosis.
