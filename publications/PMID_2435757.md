Isolation of the thrombospondin membrane receptor.

Asch AS, Barnwell J, Silverstein RL, Nachman RL.

Thrombospondin (TSP), a 450-kD multifunctional glycoprotein with a broad tissue 
distribution, is secreted upon platelet stimulation, binds to the activated 
platelet surface, and supports platelet aggregation. We have identified and 
isolated an 88-kd membrane glycoprotein present in platelets, endothelial cells, 
monocytes, and a variety of human tumor cell lines that is the membrane binding 
site for TSP. Endogenous platelet TSP binding to thrombin- and 
ionophore-stimulated human platelets was inhibited in the presence of the 
monoclonal antibody OKM5. TSP binding to C32 melanoma cells and HT1080 
fibrosarcoma cells was specific and also inhibitable with OKM5 Mab. Cell 
labeling followed by specific immunoprecipitation demonstrated biosynthesis of a 
single 88-kD glycoprotein. Binding of TSP to the isolated membrane protein was 
specific and saturable. These studies identify an 88-kD membrane glycoprotein 
that reacts with the monoclonal antibody, OKM5, and may function as the cellular 
TSP receptor.
