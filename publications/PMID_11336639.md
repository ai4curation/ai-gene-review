When clathrin-dependent endocytosis is inhibited in HeLa cells by overexpression 
of a K44A (Lys(44)-->Ala) mutant of the GTPase dynamin, high-affinity binding of 
epidermal growth factor (EGF) to the EGF receptor (EGFR) is disrupted 
[Ringerike, Stang, Johannessen, Sandnes, Levy and Madshus (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 
273, 16639-16642]. We now report that the effect of [K44A]dynamin on EGF binding 
was counteracted by incubation with the non-specific kinase inhibitor 
staurosporine (SSP), implying that a protein kinase is responsible for disrupted 
high-affinity binding of EGF upon overexpression of [K44A]dynamin. The effect of 
[K44A]dynamin on EGF binding was not due to altered phosphorylation of the EGFR, 
suggesting that the activated kinase is responsible for phosphorylation of a 
substrate other than EGFR. The number of EGFR molecules was increased in cells 
overexpressing [K44A]dynamin, while the number of proto-oncoprotein ErbB2 
molecules was unaltered. EGF-induced receptor dimerization was not influenced by 
overexpression of [K44A]dynamin. ErbB2-EGFR heterodimer formation was found to 
be ligand-independent, and the number of heterodimers was not altered by 
overexpression of [K44A]dynamin. Neither SSP nor the phorbol ester PMA, which 
disrupts high-affinity EGF-EGFR interaction, had any effect on the EGFR homo- or 
hetero-dimerization. Furthermore, the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of 
ErbB2 was not affected by overexpression of [K44A]dynamin, implying that 
EGFR-ErbB2 dimers were fully functional. Our results strongly suggest that 
high-affinity binding of EGF and EGFR-ErbB2 heterodimerization are regulated by 
different mechanisms.
