We report herein the cDNA cloning of a novel rat acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) that 
preferentially uses arachidonate and eicosapentaenoate. This newly identified 
ACS (designated ACS4) contains 670 amino acids and is 68% identical to rat ACS3, 
a previously characterized ACS that is highly expressed in brain. ACS4 was 
overproduced in Escherichia coli and the resulting enzyme was purified to 
homogeneity. The purified enzyme utilizes arachidonate and eicosapentaenoate 
most preferentially among C8-C22 saturated fatty acids and C14-C22 unsaturated 
fatty acids. Kinetic analyses revealed that the enzyme has a high affinity for 
arachidonate and eicosapentaenoate and low affinity for palmitate. ACS4 
transcripts are detectable in a wide range of tissues, with the highest level in 
adrenal gland. Immunoreactivity to ACS4 was detected in the zona fasciculata and 
reticularis of adrenal gland, in the corpus luteum and stromal luteinized cells 
in ovary, and in the Leydig cells of testis.
