TUP1 is recruited to and represses genes that regulate mating, glucose and 
oxygen use, stress response, and DNA damage. It is shown here that disruption of 
either TUP1 or histone deacetylase HDA1 causes histone H3/H2B--specific 
hyperacetylation next to the TUP1 binding site at the stress-responsive ENA1 
promoter. It is also shown that TUP1 interacts with HDA1 in vitro. These data 
indicate that TUP1 mediates localized histone deacetylation through HDA1. 
Interestingly, RPD3 deacetylates the ENA1 coding region, and both deacetylases 
contribute to ENA1 repression. However, epistasis analysis argues that only HDA1 
and TUP1 are likely to function in the same pathway. These data define gene and 
histone targets of HDA1 and illustrate the role of histone deacetylation in TUP1 
repression.
