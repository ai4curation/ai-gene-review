Ubiquitin-mediated destruction of regulatory proteins is a frequent means of 
controlling progression through signaling pathways [1]. F-box proteins [2] are 
components of modular E3 ubiquitin protein ligases called SCFs, which function 
in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination ([3] [4] [5], reviewed in [6] [7]). 
F-box proteins contain a carboxy-terminal domain that interacts with substrates 
and a 42-48 amino-acid F-box motif which binds to the protein Skp1 [2] [3] [4]. 
Skp1 binding links the F-box protein with a core ubiquitin ligase composed of 
the proteins Cdc53/Cul1, Rbx1 (also called Hrt1 and Roc1) and the E2 
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34 [8] [9] [10] [11]. The genomes of the budding 
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans 
contain, respectively, 16 and more than 60 F-box proteins [2] [7]; in S. 
cerevisiae, the F-box proteins Cdc4, Grr1 and Met30 target cyclin-dependent 
kinase inhibitors, G1 cyclins and transcriptional regulators for ubiquitination 
([3] [4] [5] [8] [10], reviewed in [6] [7]). Only four mammalian F-box proteins 
(Cyclin F, Skp1, beta-TRCP and NFB42) have been identified so far [2] [12]. 
Here, we report the identification of a family of 33 novel mammalian F-box 
proteins. The large number of these proteins in mammals suggests that the SCF 
system controls a correspondingly large number of regulatory pathways in 
vertebrates. Four of these proteins contain a novel conserved motif, the 
F-box-associated (FBA) domain, which may represent a new protein-protein 
interaction motif. The identification of these genes will help uncover pathways 
controlled by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in mammals.
