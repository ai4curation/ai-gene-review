Microglia play important roles in the process of neuronal injury and recovery. 
Numeous surface receptors have been described to regulate microglial activation. 
These receptors tightly mediate normal microglial functions including cell 
mobility, phagocytosis, and production of inflammatory mediators or trophic 
factors. In recent years, significant progresses have been achieved for 
understanding the signaling mechanisms underlying these receptors. Their 
specific roles in neurological diseases have been documented. This review will 
focus on the signal regulatory protein (SIRP) and its ligand CD47, two surface 
receptors expressed on microglia and other cells in the central nervous system 
(CNS) such as neurons. We will discuss the involvement of SIRP/CD47 signaling in 
microglial activation and in the interplay between microglia and other CNS 
cells. Current studies reveal the importance of CD47 and SIRPα in the process of 
neuroinflammation in the CNS disorders. The dual and contradictory role of CD47 
suggests that targeting the SIRPα/CD47 signaling may achieve different effects 
depending on disease stage. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: 
Cell Interactions In Stroke.
