The apoptotic spermatogenic cells and residual bodies are phagocytosed and 
degraded by Sertoli cells during spermatogenesis. The mechanisms of this process 
are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Gas6 and its receptors, the Tyro 
3 subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs; Tyro 3, Axl, and Mer), regulate 
the phagocytic function of Sertoli cells. The phagocytic ability of Sertoli 
cells increased by five times in the presence of Gas6 in serum-free medium when 
compared with controls. The Sertoli cells lacking Mer showed a 35% reduction in 
phagocytosis of apoptotic spermatogenic cells when compared with wild-type (WT) 
controls, whereas the Sertoli cells lacking Tyro 3 or Axl exhibited phagocytic 
activity comparable with the controls. Notably, the Sertoli cells lacking all 
three members of the Tyro 3 RTK subfamily showed a dramatic decrease in 
phagocytic ability of 7.6-fold when compared with WT Sertoli cells. The 
deficiency in phagocytosis by the triple-mutant Sertoli cells was due to the 
deficit in binding of the Sertoli cells to apoptotic germ cells. These findings 
suggest that Mer is responsible for triggering phagocytosis of apoptotic 
spermatogenic cells by Sertoli cells and that Tyro 3, Axl, and Mer participate 
in recognizing and binding apoptotic germ cells by Sertoli cells in a redundant 
manner. Gas6 is a functional ligand of the Tyro 3 RTK subfamily in mediating 
phagocytic ability of Sertoli cells.
