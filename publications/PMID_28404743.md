Abstract

Atherosclerotic plaque destabilization is the major determinant of most acute coronary events. Smooth muscle cell (SMC) death contributes to plaque destabilization. Here, we describe a novel antiapoptotic mechanism in vascular SMCs that involves interaction of nuclear glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) with apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (Ape1), the major oxidized DNA repair enzyme. GAPDH down-regulation potentiated H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage and SMC apoptosis. Conversely, GAPDH overexpression decreased DNA damage and protected SMCs against apoptosis. Ape1 down-regulation reversed the resistance of GAPDH-overexpressing cells to DNA damage and apoptosis, which indicated that Ape1 is indispensable for GAPDH-dependent protective effects. GAPDH bound Ape1 in the SMC nucleus, and blocking (or oxidation) of GAPDH active site cysteines suppressed GAPDH/Ape1 interaction and potentiated apoptosis. GAPDH up-regulated Ape1 via a transcription factor homeobox protein Hox-A5–dependent mechanism. GAPDH levels were reduced in atherosclerotic plaque SMCs, and this effect correlated with oxidative stress and SMC apoptosis. Thus, we demonstrated that nuclear GAPDH/Ape1 interaction preserved Ape1 activity, reduced DNA damage, and prevented SMC apoptosis. Suppression of SMC apoptosis by maintenance of nuclear GAPDH/Ape1 interactions may be a novel therapy to increase atherosclerotic plaque stability.—Hou, X., Snarski, P., Higashi, Y., Yoshida, T., Jurkevich, A., Delafontaine, P., Sukhanov, S.

DISCUSSION

Here, we described the novel antiapoptotic mechanism that involves the interaction of nuclear GAPDH and Ape1 endonuclease. GAPDH is implicated in numerous cell functions; however, its role in cell death remains controversial and poorly understood ( 36 ). Whereas some reports indicate a proapoptotic function for GAPDH ( 37 – 39 ), others demonstrated a protective role ( 40 – 43 ). The current paradigm considers GAPDH as a master switch in the regulation of cell death ( 44 ). We have provided the evidence of a novel prosurvival role of GAPDH in vascular SMCs. We have demonstrated that GAPDH protects SMCs against oxidant-induced cell death by preserving genomic DNA integrity. We have identified a mechanism that links GAPDH-dependent DNA protection to an antiapoptotic effect. It involves the direct binding of nuclear GAPDH with Ape1 endonuclease, GAPDH-dependent Ape1 up-regulation, regeneration of Ape1 activity, and stimulation of DNA repair. Our data are in line with reports that suggest an important protective function of nuclear GAPDH. For example, GAPDH has been shown to exert prosurvival effects in HeLa cells by blocking cytochrome C release via a mechanism that involved GAPDH’s nuclear functions ( 17 ).

GAPDH is involved in several important nuclear pathways, such as nuclear membrane fusion, maintenance of telomere structure, and transcriptional control of histone expression ( 13 ). GAPDH’s nuclear role could be modulated by cellular stress that causes GAPDH translocation ( 45 ). In our study, we detected a significant amount of nuclear GAPDH in untreated SMCs by immunoblotting of nuclear fractions and also by super-resolution imaging of the nuclear compartment. We showed that GAPDH binds Ape1 endonuclease in the nuclei of SMCs and that GAPDH enhances 5′-endonuclease activity of Ape1. We found that GAPDH translocates into SMC nucleus upon oxidative stress. As we initially hypothesized, an increase in nuclear GAPDH levels should stimulate its nuclear function and potentially enhance GAPDH/Ape1 binding. To our surprise, nuclear GAPDH/Ape1 colocalization was markedly reduced in H 2 O 2- treated SMCs. To investigate the mechanism, we focused our study on the role of GAPDH active site cysteines in mediating GAPDH/Ape1 interaction and investigated GAPDH effect on Ape1 activity and expression.

Modification of GAPDH active site cysteines directs GAPDH toward the proapoptotic pathway ( 25 , 46 ). We demonstrated that preserving GAPDH active site cysteines in an unmodified form ( i.e. , in reduced –SH form) is an important prerequisite for binding nuclear GAPDH with Ape1. Treatment with H 2 O 2 induced GAPDH C149 and C153 oxidation and reduced binding with Ape1, which suggested that essential cysteines are necessary for formation of the GAPDH/Ape1 complex. We noticed the appearance of large GAPDH-SO 3 aggregates in H 2 O 2 -treated cells, which correlated with decreased nuclear GAPDH/Ape1 colocalization. Nakajima et al. ( 46 ) observed similar amyloid-like GAPDH aggregates in human neuroblastoma cells as a result of the formation of S-S bonds between essential GAPDH cysteines. We suggest that either transformation of essential cysteines into –SO 3 form or generation of S-S bonds reduce the availability of GAPDH –SH groups to interact with Ape1. We found that KA [a GAPDH blocker that binds to GAPDH active site cysteines ( 28 , 47 )] reduced GAPDH binding with Ape1, and that KA also potentiated H 2 O 2 -induced SMC apoptosis. Overall, our results reveal a novel and an important role of nuclear GAPDH, namely, enzyme involvement in SMC protection against oxidant-induced cell death via formation of the GAPDH/Ape1 complex.

It has been shown that the preservation of Ape1 activity prevents oxidative DNA damage and suppresses cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo ( 48 – 51 ). Here, we introduce the innovative hypothesis that the GAPDH/Ape1 complex preserves Ape1 activity, thereby stimulating DNA repair and suppressing cell death. Ape1 down-regulation abolished the resistance of GAPDH-overexpressing R3 cells to DNA damage and apoptosis, which showed that Ape1 is indispensable for GAPDH-dependent protective effects. We described 2 major mechanisms that contribute to GAPDH-dependent Ape1 activation. We now have shown that reduced C149 and C153 mediate GAPDH binding with Ape1 and inhibition of apoptosis. Consistent with our data, Azam et al. ( 12 ) have reported that the endonuclease activity of H 2 O 2 -inactivated Ape1 was rapidly regenerated by the addition of GAPDH but not by supplementation with antioxidants or sulfhydryl group–recovering agent, such as DTT, which suggested that GAPDH specifically reduces Ape1. We hypothesize that GAPDH essential cysteines directly reduce Ape1 active site residues, which results in its reactivation. We found that GAPDH overexpression increased Ape1 level and that Ape1 up-regulation may also contribute to Ape1 activation. Of interest, H 2 O 2 -treated R3 SMCs had a relatively larger amount of Ape1 in the GAPDH/Ape1 complex compared with control; however, it is unknown whether an increase in the nuclear pool of Ape1 would be sufficient to regenerate Ape1 under conditions in which formation of the GAPDH/Ape1 complex is blocked. In fact, we demonstrated that KA blocked formation of the GAPDH/Ape1 complex in vitro and that KA also potentiated cell death, which indicated the predominant role of the GAPDH/Ape1 complex in the prevention of apoptosis.

An additional novel finding from our report is that GAPDH increased Ape1 expression via a HOXA5-dependent mechanism. HOXA5 transcription factor has been reported to play important roles in embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, and tumorigenesis ( 52 , 53 ), and HOXA5 gene is implicated in 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine–induced inhibition of atherosclerosis ( 54 ). Recently, it has been shown that HOXA5-specific siRNA induced apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in Jurkat cells ( 55 ); however, the underlying mechanisms were not identified. Our demonstration that HOXA5-specific siRNA suppressed Ape1 expression provides a potential mechanism. We believe that the identification of HOXA5 as a novel molecule that is involved in the prevention of cell death could have further clinical implications.

Elevated DNA damage is involved in the induction of cell apoptosis and progression of atherosclerosis ( 7 ). Here, we report that GAPDH reduced oxidative DNA damage and protected cultured SMCs against oxidative stress–induced apoptosis. We also found decreased GAPDH levels in the atherosclerotic plaque fibrous cap and that GAPDH down-regulation correlated with increased plaque SMC apoptosis and oxidative stress. Fibrous cap thinning and loss of viable SMCs are hallmarks of human vulnerable plaques ( 56 ), and, therefore, suppression of SMC apoptosis is a potential clinically relevant atheroprotective strategy. Our data suggest that Ape1 activation via preservation of the nuclear GAPDH/Ape1 interaction and/or via a HOXA5-dependent mechanism is a potential approach to improve atherosclerotic plaque stability. Increased levels of oxidative DNA damage have also been implicated in various age-related diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in the general aging process ( 57 , 58 ), and GAPDH levels are reported to be decreased by aging ( 59 ). Of interest, it has been reported that aging differentially regulates nuclear GAPDH vs . perinuclear/cytosolic GAPDH protein ( 60 ). Reduced Ape1 activity and increased DNA damage were associated with increased cell death in neuronal cells in senescence-accelerated mice, a well-established model of age-related neurodegeneration ( 61 ). Taken together, these reports suggest that developing a therapy on the basis of preserving the GAPDH/Ape1 interaction may be beneficial to slow aging and to treat aging-associated diseases.

In summary, we have described a novel antiapoptotic mechanism that protects vascular SMCs against oxidative stress–induced DNA damage and cell apoptosis. We found that GAPDH interacts with Ape1 in the SMC nucleus and that GAPDH/Ape1 binding depends on GAPDH active site cysteines. GAPDH up-regulates Ape1 via a HOXA5-dependent mechanism, and Ape1 up-regulation as well as formation of the nuclear GAPDH/Ape1 complex contribute to regeneration of oxidized Ape1. We found reduced GAPDH levels in the atherosclerotic plaque fibrous cap in association with increased oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. We suggest that preserving the nuclear GAPDH/Ape1 complex could be a novel beneficial strategy to suppress DNA damage, reduce SMC apoptosis, and ultimately enhance atherosclerotic plaque stability.
