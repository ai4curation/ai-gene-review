Mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are associated with various 
forms of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and epilepsy. The 
heterodimeric TSC complex, consisting of Tsc1 and Tsc2 proteins, regulates the 
activity of the TOR (target of rapamycin) complex via Rheb, a small GTPase. TOR, 
an atypical serine/threonine kinase, forms two distinct complexes TORC1 and 
TORC2. Raptor and Rictor serve as specific functional components of TORC1 and 
TORC2, respectively. Previous studies have identified Tsc1 as a regulator of 
hippocampal neuronal morphology and function via the TOR pathway, but it is 
unclear whether this is mediated via TORC1 or TORC2. In a genetic screen for 
aberrant synaptic growth at the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in Drosophila, we 
identified that Tsc2 mutants showed increased synaptic growth. Increased 
synaptic growth was also observed in rictor mutants, while raptor knockdown did 
not phenocopy the TSC mutant phenotype, suggesting that a novel role exists for 
TORC2 in regulating synapse growth. Furthermore, Tsc2 mutants showed a dramatic 
decrease in the levels of phosphorylated Akt, and interestingly, Akt mutants 
phenocopied Tsc2 mutants, leading to the hypothesis that Tsc2 and Akt might work 
via the same genetic pathway to regulate synapse growth. Indeed, 
transheterozygous analysis of Tsc2 and Akt mutants confirmed this hypothesis. 
Finally, our data also suggest that while overexpression of rheb results in 
aberrant synaptic overgrowth, the overgrowth might be independent of TORC2. 
Thus, we propose that at the Drosophila NMJ, TSC regulates synaptic growth via 
the TORC2-Akt pathway.
