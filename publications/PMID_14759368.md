A remarkably large collection of evolutionarily conserved proteins has been 
implicated in processing of noncoding RNAs and biogenesis of ribonucleoproteins. 
To better define the physical and functional relationships among these proteins 
and their cognate RNAs, we performed 165 highly stringent affinity purifications 
of known or predicted RNA-related proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We 
systematically identified and estimated the relative abundance of stably 
associated polypeptides and RNA species using a combination of gel densitometry, 
protein mass spectrometry, and oligonucleotide microarray hybridization. 
Ninety-two discrete proteins or protein complexes were identified comprising 489 
different polypeptides, many associated with one or more specific RNA molecules. 
Some of the pre-rRNA-processing complexes that were obtained are discrete 
sub-complexes of those previously described. Among these, we identified the IPI 
complex required for proper processing of the ITS2 region of the ribosomal RNA 
primary transcript. This study provides a high-resolution overview of the 
modular topology of noncoding RNA-processing machinery.
