Tob protein, when overexpressed, suppresses growth of NIH3T3 cells, presumably 
by regulating expression of various growth-related genes. However, the molecular 
mechanisms underlying Tob-mediated regulation of gene expression have been 
obscure. To address this issue we established stable Tob-expressing cell lines 
and used a proteomics approach to identify Tob-interacting proteins. We found 
that Tob associates with the CCR4-NOT complex. The carboxyl-terminal half of Tob 
interacted with Cnot1, a core protein of the CCR4-NOT complex. We further showed 
that the deadenylase activity associated with the complex was suppressed in 
vitro by Tob. These results suggest that the antiproliferative activity of Tob 
is shown post-transcriptionally by controlling the stability of the target mRNAs 
in addition to its involvement in transcriptional regulation, reported 
previously.
