NDUFAB1 is the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACP) essential for cell 
viability. Through its pantetheine-4'-phosphate post-translational modification, 
NDUFAB1 interacts with members of the leucine-tyrosine-arginine motif (LYRM) 
protein family. Although several LYRM proteins have been described to 
participate in a variety of defined processes, the functions of others remain 
either partially or entirely unknown. We profiled the interaction network of 
NDUFAB1 to reveal associations with 9 known LYRM proteins as well as more than 
20 other proteins involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex and 
mitochondrial ribosome assembly. Subsequent knockout and interaction network 
studies in human cells revealed the LYRM member AltMiD51 to be important for 
optimal assembly of the large mitoribosome subunit, consistent with recent 
structural studies. In addition, we used proteomics coupled with topographical 
heat-mapping to reveal that knockout of LYRM2 impairs assembly of the 
NADH-dehydrogenase module of complex I, leading to defects in cellular 
respiration. Together, this work adds to the catalogue of functions executed by 
LYRM family of proteins in building mitochondrial complexes and emphasizes the 
common and essential role of NDUFAB1 as a protagonist in mitochondrial 
metabolism.
