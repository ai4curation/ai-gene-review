The tumor suppressor BRCA2 is essential for homologous recombination (HR), 
replication fork stability, and DNA interstrand crosslink repair in vertebrates. 
We identify HSF2BP, a protein previously described as testis specific and not 
characterized functionally, as an interactor of BRCA2 in mouse embryonic stem 
cells, where the 2 proteins form a constitutive complex. HSF2BP is transcribed 
in all cultured human cancer cell lines tested and elevated in some tumor 
samples. Inactivation of the mouse Hsf2bp gene results in male infertility due 
to a severe HR defect during spermatogenesis. The BRCA2-HSF2BP interaction is 
highly evolutionarily conserved and maps to armadillo repeats in HSF2BP and a 
68-amino acid region between the BRC repeats and the DNA binding domain of human 
BRCA2 (Gly2270-Thr2337) encoded by exons 12 and 13. This region of BRCA2 does 
not harbor known cancer-associated missense mutations and may be involved in the 
reproductive rather than the tumor-suppressing function of BRCA2.

ResultsRnf126 deletion led to testicular atrophy, disrupted seminiferous tubule structure, reduced sperm count, and spermatogenesis arrest at meiotic prophase I. Furthermore, male mice exhibited impaired homologous recombination repair and increased apoptosis within the seminiferous tubules. We identified four missense variants of the RNF126 (V68M, R241H, E261A, D253N) associated with male infertility. Specifically, the E261A and D253N variants, located in the RING domain, directly compromised the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF126.

IntroductionSpermatogenesis is a complex and precisely regulated process that encompasses multiple stages of cell differentiation and maturation, culminating in the production of functional spermatozoa [1], [2]. Meiosis constitutes a crucial stage during spermatogenesis, facilitating the generation of novel genetic combinations via recombination [3], [4]. The precise control of genome integrity in germ cells during meiosis plays a vital role in initiating, progressing, and completing this process successfully. Male infertility poses a significant global health challenge for couples attempting to conceive [4], [5]. Meiotic abnormalities commonly contribute to male infertility by causing reduced sperm count (azoospermia or oligozoospermia), impaired sperm motility (asthenozoospermia), or a high prevalence of morphologically abnormal sperm (teratozoospermia). Approximately 15 % of infertile men are affected by genetic defects [6]. In fact, even after thorough genetic testing, the etiology of approximately 40–60 % of cases with abnormal sperm production remains undetermined [7], [8]. The precise genetic causes underlying male infertility remain poorly understood. Gaining comprehensive insights into the complex molecular mechanisms and genetic factors involved in meiotic abnormalities is essential for enhancing the diagnosis, prognosis, and development of targeted therapeutic interventions for male infertility.Accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and genetic material exchange between homologous chromosomes are vital for preserving genome integrity during germ cell development, notably in meiotic prophase I [9], [10]. During this phase, homologous chromosomes pair and synapse, facilitated by the synaptonemal complex, a specialized structure. Based on specific chromosomal appearances, prophase can be subdivided into five stages: leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene and diakinesis [11]. An essential event in this phase is the initiation of recombination via DSBs. Such breaks initiate homologous recombination (HR) repair, a vital mechanism for ensuring precise progression and completion of meiotic processes [3]. Homologous recombination repair requires CTIP, MRE11, and EXO1 in a bidirectional process called DNA end resection, leading to the creation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with exposed 3′ ends. Following this step, ssDNA is rapidly coated by the RPA protein and later replaced by RAD51 or its meiosis-specific counterpart DMC1 [12], [13], [14]. These proteins facilitate the invasion of ssDNA into homologous chromosomes. Multiple studies have emphasized the importance of DNA homologous recombination repair factors in governing spermatogenesis. Disruptions in the expression of these factors, such as ATR, BRCA2, MEIOB, NBS1 and HSF2BP, can result in meiotic arrest and male infertility in mice [15], [16], [17], [18]. Despite the current understanding of the importance of HR repair in early meiosis, comprehensive knowledge regarding the specific regulatory factors and signaling pathways involved in this process remains limited.Ubiquitination, a reversible posttranslational modification occurring ubiquitously in organisms, plays a critical role in the regulation of spermatogenesis [19]. This process encompasses successive enzymatic steps involving E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase enzyme) enzymes that catalyze the covalent attachment of ubiquitin molecules to target proteins [20]. Several E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as HUWE1, UBR2, CUL4A, PHF7, and RNF20, have been reported to regulate spermatogenesis by influencing histone ubiquitination and participating in programmed DSB repair processes [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. RNF126, encoded by the highly conserved RNF126 gene located at the 19th chromosome p13.3 locus, is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in diverse biological processes, encompassing DNA damage response and repair, cancer development, and intracellular protein quality control [26], [27], [28], [29]. RNF126′s distinctive RING finger domain interacts with E2 (i.e., UBCH5b), enabling the transfer of ubiquitin molecules from E2 to substrate proteins [26]. Our previous research demonstrated that RNF126-mediated ubiquitination enhances the DNA exonuclease activity of MRE11. Subsequently, this process promotes the recruitment of RPA to single-stranded DNA and ATR and CHK1 phosphorylation, facilitating the continuous repair of DNA damage via homologous recombination [30]. In addition, RNF126 may regulate DNA damage repair by modulating BRCA1, Ku80, and RNF168 [27], [28], [31]. Although whole-genome sequencing has revealed a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s in RNF126, the functional consequences and pathogenicity of these variants have not been identified. Previous studies have emphasized the importance of specific E3 ligases in spermatogenesis from both animal and molecular perspectives, but limited research exists in regard to identifying and confirming pathogenic variants associated with their role in patients with infertility.This study presents pioneering evidence highlighting the critical role of RNF126 in male spermatogenesis. Our findings reveal substantial expression of RNF126 in the testes of mice and humans, exhibiting a marked surge during the secondary wave of transcription in spermatogenesis. Rnf126 depletion in mice results in spermatogenesis arrest at meiotic prophase I accompanied by an elevated apoptotic cell count. Furthermore, newly identified variants in RNF126 among nonobstructive azoospermia patients compromise its capacity to facilitate homologous recombination repair. More specifically, the E261A and D253N variants exert a direct detrimental effect on the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF126. These findings offer valuable insights into the pathogenesis of nonobstructive azoospermia by elucidating the functional role played by RNF126 while also identifying potential targets for the diagnosis and treatment of male infertility using gene therapy strategies.

Materials and MethodsCells: The HEK293T cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and validated via short tandem repeat analysis. The DR-GFP-U2OS cell line was a gift from Prof. Junmin Zhou from Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. [40] HEK293T and DR-GFP-U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in an incubator with 5 % CO2.Mice: C57BL/6 Rnf126fl/fl conditional KO mice were generated by Biocytogen. LoxP sites were inserted in intron 1 and intron 8 of the Rnf126 gene. Conditional deletion of exons 2–8 of the Rnf126 gene can be achieved upon expression of Cre, resulting in the production of a truncated protein consisting of 74 amino acids (comprising the N-terminal 25 amino acids and an additional 49 amino acids generated by frameshift mutation), triggering mRNA degradation mediated by nonsense-mediated decay. Rnf126fl/fl mice were crossed with C57BL/6 CMV-Cre transgenic mice to generate Rnf126 KO mice. Rnf126fl/fl female mice were crossed with C57BL/6 Vasa-Cre male mice, and Rnf126fl/- Vasa-Cre positive male mice were retained. Subsequently, they were crossed with Rnf126fl/fl female mice to obtain testis-specific KO mice. The primers used to identify the Rnf126 floxed genotypes were Rnf126-F (forward primer) and Rnf126-R (reverse primer). The floxed band was 261 bp, and the WT band was 199 bp. The primers used to identify the Rnf126 deletion alleles were Rnf126-F and Rnf126-R2, which produced a 361 bp band. All mice were kept in specific pathogen-free conditions within the Animal Resource Center at the Kunming Institute of Zoology.Fertility test: Fertility assessment was conducted in male mice aged over 2 months and under 4 months. Each male mouse was housed with four WT C57BL/6 female mice (aged 2 months) in the evening, and the presence of vaginal plug formation was checked every morning. Once the plug was observed (0.5 days after mating), the female mice were separated and individually housed, while the male mice were allowed a 2-day rest period before another round of mating with a different female mouse. Female mice with confirmed plugs were individually housed, and pregnancy status and litter size were recorded. If a female mouse did not give birth to any pups by postpartum Day 22, it was considered nonpregnant and euthanized for confirmation.Single-cell sequencing: As per the requirements, single cell suspension was prepared and loaded onto Chromium microfluidic chips with 3′ (v2 or v3, project-dependent) chemistry. Then, it was barcoded with a 10 × Chromium Controller (10X Genomics). Following this, RNA from the barcoded cells was reverse-transcribed and sequencing libraries were constructed using reagents from a Chromium Single Cell 3′ v2 (v2 or v3, project-dependent) reagent kit (10X Genomics) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was carried out on either HiSeq 2000 or NovaSeq (project-dependent) from Illumina, according to the manufacturer's guidelines.Enrichment analysis: The enrichment analysis of marker genes was performed by the clusterProfiler R package, in which gene length bias was corrected. EnrichGO function was used to implement Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of marker genes which would be considered to have significantly enriched GO terms with a corrected P-value less than 0.05. We utilized the enrich KEGG function from the clusterProfiler R package to examine the statistical enrichment of marker genes in KEGG pathways.Spermatocyte surface spreading: To perform the spermatocyte surface spreading assay, testes from 1-month-old mice were utilized following the protocol described in previous research [41], [42]. In brief, the tunica albuginea was removed, and the tubules were incubated in hypotonic buffer (30 mM Tris, 50 mM sucrose, 17 mM trisodium citrate dihydrate, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM PMSF, pH=8.2) for 30–60 min. Subsequently, the tubules were fragmented in sucrose buffer (100 mM sucrose, pH=8.2), and the resulting suspension was repeatedly pipetted to achieve homogeneity. The cell suspension was then spread onto glass slides coated with 1 % PFA and 0.15 % Triton X-100 at pH=9.2. The slides were left to dry overnight in a sealed container with high humidity, followed by two sequential 2-minute washes in 0.4 % Photoflo (Kodak). Finally, the slides were air-dried at room temperature and stored at − 20 °C.Immunofluorescence staining of paraffin sections: Tissue samples were prepared into paraffin sections. Deparaffinization was performed using xylene. Subsequently, the sections were rehydrated using a graded ethanol solution. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer, followed by washing the sections with 1 × PBS and permeabilizing with 0.2 % Triton X-100 for 10 min. Blocking was carried out with 5 % FBS/1 × PBST for 60 min. The primary antibody was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After removing the secondary antibody, the sections were washed with 1 × PBS. DAPI staining was performed at room temperature to stain the cell nuclei. Anti-fade mounting medium was added dropwise, and a coverslip was placed on top. The sections were observed, images were captured using a Nikon confocal laser scanning microscope, and images were exported using NIS-Elements Viewer software. Additionally, sections were scanned using TissueFAXS 4.2 and analyzed using StrataQuest 5.0 (both TissueGnostics Gmbh, Vienna, Austria).TUNEL assay: Apoptotic cells were detected using the Roche In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit on paraffin sections of the testes, following the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, the sections were incubated with DAPI at room temperature for 20 min. After removing DAPI, the sections were washed 2–3 times with 1 × PBS for 2 min each and then mounted. Observation and image capture were performed using the high-resolution fluorescence microscopy (Carl zeiss, LSM880) and sections were scanned using TissueFAXS 4.2 and analyzed using StrataQuest 5.0 (both TissueGnostics Gmbh, Vienna, Austria). Images were acquired with 20x magnification.Plasmids, siRNAs and transfection: Transfection of plasmids and siRNAs was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, California, USA). In brief, cells were cultured until they reached 50–60 % confluence and then transfected with the respective plasmids or siRNA. For transfection, plasmids or diluted siRNA and Lipofectamine 2000 were added to separate tubes containing serum-free medium. After a 5-minute incubation at room temperature, the contents of the two tubes were mixed and further incubated for 20 min. The resulting mixture was then distributed onto the appropriate cell culture dishes. Subsequently, the cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5 % CO2 for 48 h for subsequent experiments. All chemically synthesized siRNAs were purchased from RiboBio (Guangzhou, China) and transfected at a final concentration of 20 nM. The specific siRNA target sequence used for targeting the human RNF126 3′-UTR was 5′-GUCUAACCUCACCCUCUAA-3′. Plasmids employed in this study were constructed using the Mut Express MultiS Fast Mutagenesis Kit (Vazyme C215, China) and the Uniclone One Step Seamless Cloning Kit (Genes and SC612, China). The complete list of these plasmids can be found in Supplementary Table S3.Ubiquitination Assays: To assess ubiquitination, cells subjected to different treatments were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 % SDS, 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and protease inhibitor. The lysates were placed on ice for 30 min with rotation, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were then diluted tenfold with BSA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.5 % Nonidet P-40, 0.5 % SDS, 0.5 % BSA, 10 mM NEM, and protease inhibitor). Approximately 0.5–1.5 mg of cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG agarose affinity gel (A2020, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with BSA buffer, boiled in SDS loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting.Statistical and reproducibility analysis: Prism v.10.0 (GraphPad) or Microsoft Excel 2019 was utilized for all statistical analyses. SPSS 20.0 was utilized for risk analysis of mutation sites. Unless explicitly mentioned, the statistical analyses involved two-tailed Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance, while a p value less than 0.01 was considered highly significant. The figures or legends indicate the number of cells, mice, or replicates (n) employed in each experiment. Bar graphs are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Immunofluorescence microscopy images show representative images from three independent experiments employing cells treated under identical conditions. The Western blot data were derived from corresponding experiments conducted concurrently and, unless otherwise specified in the legend, represent outcomes from three independent experiments.Ethics statement: All animal experiments were performed according to the institutional ethical guidelines of animal care and were approved by Animal Resource Center at the Kunming Institute of Zoology (Approval No. SMKX-20160305–08). And clinical samples were collected from the Reproductive Medicine Center of the Third Hospital of Peking University. Informed consent was obtained from all participants (The Ethics Committee of the Third Hospital of Peking University; Approval No. 201892–034).

Once the plug was observed (0.5 days after mating), the female mice were separated and individually housed, while the male mice were allowed a 2-day rest period before another round of mating with a different female mouse. Female mice with confirmed plugs were individually housed, and pregnancy status and litter size were recorded. If a female mouse did not give birth to any pups by postpartum Day 22, it was considered nonpregnant and euthanized for confirmation.

Single-cell sequencing: As per the requirements, single cell suspension was prepared and loaded onto Chromium microfluidic chips with 3′ (v2 or v3, project-dependent) chemistry. Then, it was barcoded with a 10 × Chromium Controller (10X Genomics). Following this, RNA from the barcoded cells was reverse-transcribed and sequencing libraries were constructed using reagents from a Chromium Single Cell 3′ v2 (v2 or v3, project-dependent) reagent kit (10X Genomics) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was carried out on either HiSeq 2000 or NovaSeq (project-dependent) from Illumina, according to the manufacturer's guidelines.

Enrichment analysis: The enrichment analysis of marker genes was performed by the clusterProfiler R package, in which gene length bias was corrected. EnrichGO function was used to implement Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of marker genes which would be considered to have significantly enriched GO terms with a corrected P-value less than 0.05. We utilized the enrich KEGG function from the clusterProfiler R package to examine the statistical enrichment of marker genes in KEGG pathways.

Spermatocyte surface spreading: To perform the spermatocyte surface spreading assay, testes from 1-month-old mice were utilized following the protocol described in previous research [41], [42]. In brief, the tunica albuginea was removed, and the tubules were incubated in hypotonic buffer (30 mM Tris, 50 mM sucrose, 17 mM trisodium citrate dihydrate, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM PMSF, pH=8.2) for 30–60 min. Subsequently, the tubules were fragmented in sucrose buffer (100 mM sucrose, pH=8.2), and the resulting suspension was repeatedly pipetted to achieve homogeneity. The cell suspension was then spread onto glass slides coated with 1 % PFA and 0.15 % Triton X-100 at pH=9.2. The slides were left to dry overnight in a sealed container with high humidity, followed by two sequential 2-minute washes in 0.4 % Photoflo (Kodak). Finally, the slides were air-dried at room temperature and stored at − 20 °C.

Immunofluorescence staining of paraffin sections: Tissue samples were prepared into paraffin sections. Deparaffinization was performed using xylene. Subsequently, the sections were rehydrated using a graded ethanol solution. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer, followed by washing the sections with 1 × PBS and permeabilizing with 0.2 % Triton X-100 for 10 min. Blocking was carried out with 5 % FBS/1 × PBST for 60 min. The primary antibody was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After removing the secondary antibody, the sections were washed with 1 × PBS. DAPI staining was performed at room temperature to stain the cell nuclei. Anti-fade mounting medium was added dropwise, and a coverslip was placed on top. The sections were observed, images were captured using a Nikon confocal laser scanning microscope, and images were exported using NIS-Elements Viewer software. Additionally, sections were scanned using TissueFAXS 4.2 and analyzed using StrataQuest 5.0 (both TissueGnostics Gmbh, Vienna, Austria).

TUNEL assay: Apoptotic cells were detected using the Roche In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit on paraffin sections of the testes, following the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, the sections were incubated with DAPI at room temperature for 20 min. After removing DAPI, the sections were washed 2–3 times with 1 × PBS for 2 min each and then mounted. Observation and image capture were performed using the high-resolution fluorescence microscopy (Carl zeiss, LSM880) and sections were scanned using TissueFAXS 4.2 and analyzed using StrataQuest 5.0 (both TissueGnostics Gmbh, Vienna, Austria). Images were acquired with 20x magnification.

Plasmids, siRNAs and transfection: Transfection of plasmids and siRNAs was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, California, USA). In brief, cells were cultured until they reached 50–60 % confluence and then transfected with the respective plasmids or siRNA. For transfection, plasmids or diluted siRNA and Lipofectamine 2000 were added to separate tubes containing serum-free medium. After a 5-minute incubation at room temperature, the contents of the two tubes were mixed and further incubated for 20 min. The resulting mixture was then distributed onto the appropriate cell culture dishes. Subsequently, the cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5 % CO2 for 48 h for subsequent experiments. All chemically synthesized siRNAs were purchased from RiboBio (Guangzhou, China) and transfected at a final concentration of 20 nM. The specific siRNA target sequence used for targeting the human RNF126 3′-UTR was 5′-GUCUAACCUCACCCUCUAA-3′. Plasmids employed in this study were constructed using the Mut Express MultiS Fast Mutagenesis Kit (Vazyme C215, China) and the Uniclone One Step Seamless Cloning Kit (Genes and SC612, China). The complete list of these plasmids can be found in Supplementary Table S3.

Ubiquitination Assays: To assess ubiquitination, cells subjected to different treatments were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 % SDS, 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and protease inhibitor. The lysates were placed on ice for 30 min with rotation, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were then diluted tenfold with BSA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.5 % Nonidet P-40, 0.5 % SDS, 0.5 % BSA, 10 mM NEM, and protease inhibitor). Approximately 0.5–1.5 mg of cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG agarose affinity gel (A2020, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with BSA buffer, boiled in SDS loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting.

Statistical and reproducibility analysis: Prism v.10.0 (GraphPad) or Microsoft Excel 2019 was utilized for all statistical analyses. SPSS 20.0 was utilized for risk analysis of mutation sites. Unless explicitly mentioned, the statistical analyses involved two-tailed Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance, while a p value less than 0.01 was considered highly significant.

ResultsRnf126 is needed for maintaining fertility in male micePreviously, we generated a whole-body Rnf126 knockout (KO) mouse model. During the process of breeding heterozygous Rnf126 knockout mice to generate homozygous knockout mice, we observed a significant decrease in the reproductive rate in the heterozygous mice after three generations. We subsequently assessed the expression profile of Rnf126 across different mouse tissues and observed its highest expression level in the testes (Fig. 1A). Additionally, we observed a pronounced increase in Rnf126 transcription during the second transcription wave of spermatogenesis (Fig. 1B). The human protein atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000070423-RNF126) indicates predominant expression of RNF126 protein in human skeletal muscle and testis, with notably elevated levels in spermatocytes (Fig. S1A and B). These findings suggest that RNF126 likely plays a role in testicular development and spermatogenesis.Fig. 1Rnf126 is needed for maintaining fertility in male mice.. A) Expression profile of Rnf126 in various mouse tissues, with the testes showing the highest expression level.

Body weight (E) and ratios of testis weight to body weight (F) for WT and KO mice at 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 2 months, and 8 months of age were measured and analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed unpaired t test (n = 5 per genotype). ** p < 0.01; n.s., not significant..

At least 100 tubules were counted from at least 3 different mice. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed unpaired t test. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; n.s., not significant.. L) Reduced sperm count and decreased sperm motility in KO mice. Sperm count and motility in 4-month-old mice were assessed using CASA. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed unpaired t test (n = 16 per genotype). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; n.s., not significant.. M) Decreased reproductive ability in male KO mice. Fertility assessment of male WT and KO mice was conducted, with six male mice aged over 2 months and under 4 months selected in each group for individual matings with four 2-month-old wild-type female mice.Rnf126 whole-body KO mice were generated by introducing CMV-Cre into Rnf126loxp/loxp mice. The successful establishment of KO mice was confirmed through PCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C-D and S2A). While the male KO mice appeared indistinguishable from the wild-type (WT) mice and exhibited normal survival, their testes displayed a marked decrease in size and weight (Fig. 1D-F and S2B). Adult male KO mice displayed reduced sizes of the testes and epididymides compared to WT mice. This reduction was accompanied with a decrease in seminiferous tubule diameter and an increased proportion of empty seminiferous tubules. Additionally, the epididymides of KO mice lacked sperm, which can be visualized using H&E staining (Fig. 1G-K and S2C-D). Computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) was employed to examine sperm quality. Compared to WT mice, KO mice exhibited a reduced sperm count and decreased sperm motility (Fig. 1L). We proceeded to evaluate the reproductive capacity of male KO mice in comparison to WT mice. Two-month-old WT and KO male mice were consecutively mated with four adult WT female mice over a three-month period (n = 6). The control group of male mice consistently produced typical offspring, with an average litter size of 6.81 ± 2.436 per litter. Conversely, KO males exhibited a significant decline in reproductive capacity, resulting in an average litter size of 1.5 ± 2.891 (Fig. 1M). Moreover, no notable disparities were found in the levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), and testosterone (TESTO) between adult 2-month-old KO mice and WT mice (Fig. S2E). Nevertheless, in 8-month-old mice, a downward trend in LH, E2, and TESTO levels was observed (Fig. S2E). To eliminate potential confounding factors, we employed Vasa-Cre to establish testis-specific Rnf126 conditional heterozygous (Rnf126cHE) or homozygous (Rnf126cKO) KO mice (Fig. S3A-B). We observed that compared to the control group, both Rnf126cHE and Rnf126cKO mice exhibited reduced size of the testes and epididymides, decreased diameter of seminiferous tubules, increased number of empty seminiferous tubules, and reduced sperm count in the epididymis (Fig. S3C–H). Furthermore, fertility assessment of male mice revealed a dose-dependent decrease in reproductive capacity following specific heterozygous or homozygous deletion of Rnf126 in the testes (Fig. S3I). Collectively, these findings indicate that RNF126 serves as a pivotal regulator of spermatogenesis and male reproductive function.Rnf126 deficiency causes spermatogenesis arrest at meiotic prophase ITo investigate the effect of Rnf126 deficiency on crucial stages of spermatogenesis, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on testicular tissue acquired from both WT and KO mice (Fig. 2A and S4). We employed nonlinear dimensional reduction (UMAP) in R-Seura to classify cells into 20 clusters. Cluster analysis unveiled discrete cell clusters within the testicular cells of both WT and KO mice (Fig. 2A). Remarkably, Rnf126 deficiency led to a significant rise in the proportion of cells at the A1 stage, A1-IPL stage, and meiotic prophase I, whereas a marked decrease was evident in the proportion of cells at the meiotic prophase II stage and round spermatids (Fig. 2B-F). These findings provide strong evidence that Rnf126 deficiency primarily hinders spermatogenesis at the meiotic prophase I stage, leading to a subsequent notable decrease in the proportion of cells transitioning into the meiotic prophase II stage and generating round spermatids. Additionally, a comparative analysis of nongerm cells demonstrated a noteworthy elevation in the proportion of Sertoli cells and a substantial reduction in the proportion of Leydig cells in KO mouse testes (Fig. 2G and H). Subsequently, we examined the expression pattern of Rnf126 across various cell types within the testes. In line with observations in human tissues, Rnf126 demonstrated predominant expression in germ cells in mice, with the highest expression levels observed during the meiotic phase (Fig. 2I and S1B). These findings highlight the critical role of Rnf126 in spermatogenesis, emphasizing that its deficiency predominantly results in the arrest of spermatogenesis at the meiotic prophase I stage.Fig. 2Impact of Rnf126 deficiency on spermatogenesis stages revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis..

I) Predominant expression of Rnf126 in germ cells during the meiotic phase. Violin plots showing the expression levels of Rnf126 in different cluster cells..Rnf126 deficiency alters gene expression involved in meiosis and induces aberrant apoptosis in meiotic prophase ITo further explore the effects of Rnf126 KO during meiosis, we specifically isolated cells in this phase from the single-cell RNA sequencing dataset. Through a comparison of transcriptome data between the WT and KO groups, we detected differentially transcribed genes (DTGs) and conducted separate Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses for the downregulated and upregulated genes within the DTGs (Fig. 3A). The GO analysis revealed that the downregulated DTGs following Rnf126 knockout exhibited significant enrichment in annotated functions associated with spermatogenesis and cell differentiation. Conversely, no enrichment related to sperm generation was observed among the upregulated DTGs. Interestingly, the upregulated DTGs demonstrated a notable enrichment in pathways associated with promoting DNA double-strand break homologous recombination repair and apoptosis signaling (Fig. 3B and C). We then utilized qPCR to validate that the downregulated DTGs associated with spermatogenesis, fertilization and development displayed a partial dose-dependent reduction in mRNA levels following Rnf126 KO (Fig. 3D). Then, we examined the expression of meiosis marker genes related to spermatogenesis in WT and KO groups at different stages and found that the expression of these genes was downregulated in the meiotic phase I following Rnf126 KO (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, the batch correlation analysis in single tissue (sincorBatch, https://guotosky.vip:13838/GTBA/) provided robust evidence supporting the correlation between Rnf126 and spermatogenesis as well as male infertility, as demonstrated by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) testicular data and Testicular Germ Cell Tumors (TCGA) data from TCGA database (Fig. 3F). In conclusion, based on the aforementioned analysis and validation, we established that Rnf126 deficiency leads to the downregulation of genes associated with spermatogenesis during meiosis. Furthermore, Rnf126 deficiency induces the activation of DNA double-strand break homologous recombination repair and apoptosis signaling pathways during meiosis.Fig. 3Impact of Rnf126 KO on meiosis and associated pathways in spermatogenesis..

E) The expression of MI markers was downregulated in the MI cells of the KO group.

F) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showing an association between RNF126 and male infertility and spermatogenesis using GTEx testicular data and TGCT data from TCGA.. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)To further substantiate and validate the mechanism underlying the pronounced loss of germ cells and decreased fertility in Rnf126-deficient mice, we conducted an immunofluorescence staining analysis to examine the expression of germ cell markers in the testes of 2-month-old adult WT and KO male mice. The PLZF staining data demonstrated a comparable number of PLZF-positive cells, representing undifferentiated spermatogonia, in nonempty seminiferous tubules between the KO and WT groups. The absence of Rnf126 did not influence the abundance of undifferentiated spermatogonia during spermatogenesis (Fig. S5A-B). Moreover, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of DDX4-labeled germ cells and a substantial increase in the proportion of SOX9-labeled Sertoli cells in the KO group compared to the WT group, with only supporting cells found in empty seminiferous tubules (Fig. S5C-E). Additionally, nonempty seminiferous tubules of the KO group exhibited a higher proportion of SYCP3-positive cells, a marker for meiosis initiation and a component of the synaptonemal complex. To further confirm that these observations were specifically attributable to the deletion of Rnf126 in germ cells, we conducted similar marker analyses in germ cell-specific Rnf126-KO mice. Consistently, the cHE and cKO groups displayed a significantly diminished proportion of DDX4-labeled germ cells, accompanied by a considerable increase in the proportion of SOX9-positive Sertoli cells (Fig. 4 A-C and S6A), mirroring the phenotype observed in patients with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. Notably, the cHE and cKO groups demonstrated a marked increase in the proportion of SYCP3-positive cells within nonempty seminiferous tubules (Fig. 4D-E and S6B). Furthermore, TUNEL assay results revealed a significant elevation in the proportion of apoptotic cells in the cHE and cKO groups compared to the WT group (Fig. 4F-G and S6C). Taken together, the results indicate that the loss of Rnf126 impedes spermatogenesis, resulting in a reduced proportion of germ cells, an increased proportion of premeiotic cells, and an elevated proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, the data suggest that Rnf126 regulates these processes in a dose-dependent manner, with varying levels of Rnf126 affecting the severity of spermatogenetic disruptions. Collectively, these findings suggest that the decreased sperm count, and decreased fertility observed in male mice with Rnf126 deficiency might be attributed to disruptions in meiotic phase I, potentially through a dose-dependent regulation mechanism exerted by Rnf126.Fig. 4Loss of Rnf126 results in meiotic defects and increased apoptosis during spermatogenesis..

Multiple DNA DSBs and sister chromatid exchanges occur during meiosis and rely on the completion of HR repair. Therefore, we hypothesize that the impaired progression of meiosis I in KO mice results from inhibited HR repair mediated by RNF126. Mouse spermatogenesis consists of 12 discernible stages characterized by the composition of spermatocytes found within the seminiferous tubules. To identify the specific stage affected by Rnf126 gene KO during meiosis, we initially conducted H&E staining on testes obtained from 2-month-old mice to monitor the stages of the seminiferous tubule epithelium. A comparison between the testes of Rnf126 KO mice and control mice demonstrated a decrease in the proportion of cells in stage IV, along with an increase in the proportions of cells in stages IX-XII and I-III, signifying a disruption in the transition from pachytene to diplotene (Fig. 5A and B). To further discern the delayed stage within meiotic prophase, chromosome spreads were prepared from spermatocytes of 1-month-old mouse testes, followed by immunostaining with anti-SYCP3 and anti-γH2AX antibodies. The immunostaining patterns of SYCP3 and γH2AX enabled the distinction of leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, and diplotene stages in spermatocytes (Fig. 5C). The proportion of pachytene spermatocytes in the KO mice increased from 57.4 % to 66.8 %, while the proportion of diplotene cells decreased from 7.6 % to 2.6 % compared to the WT group (Fig. 5D). These findings suggest compromised progression from pachytene to diplotene spermatocytes. During the pachytene and diplotene stages, meiotic recombination events take place, including sister chromatid pairing and exchange. At this stage, homologous chromosomes pair to form tetrad complexes, enabling genetic exchanges and DNA recombination that enhance genetic diversity. To further investigate this observation, immunostaining using anti-SYCP3 and anti-RPA2 antibodies was performed to examine the recombination process during meiosis. RPA2, a crucial protein involved in DNA replication and repair, safeguards and stabilizes ssDNA by binding to it, thereby preventing its reannealing or degradation during DNA recombination. The results revealed a significantly higher number of RPA2 foci in zygotene, pachytene, and diplotene spermatocytes within the KO group relative to the WT group (Fig. 5E-F). These outcomes imply that Rnf126 deficiency obstructs DNA recombination and leads to pachytene arrest in spermatocytes. Moreover, the TUNEL assay exhibited a notable increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells following Rnf126 KO (Fig. 5 G-H). Additionally, utilizing TUNEL-labeled apoptotic cells and SYCP3-labeled meiotic prophase cells, we detected the occurrence of apoptotic cells during meiotic prophase (Fig. 5I). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Rnf126 deficiency disrupts spermatogenesis, leading to defective meiotic recombination and subsequent arrest at the pachytene stage, ultimately culminating in apoptosis.Fig. 5Rnf126 KO impairs meiotic progression and recombination, leading to pachytene arrest and increased apoptosis during spermatogenesis..

I) Detection of apoptotic cells within KO testes during meiotic prophase using TUNEL-labeled apoptotic cells and SYCP3-labeled meiotic prophase cells..RNF126 variants attenuate its effect on HR and are associated with nonobstructive azoospermia and oligozoospermia male patientsTo understand the clinical significance of RNF126, we investigated the association between RNF126 and male infertility. Whole blood samples were collected from 193 patients diagnosed with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia or nonobstructive azoospermia, aged between 20 and 40 years, with unknown etiology. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify RNF126 gene variants in these patients. In the exonic regions of the RNF126 gene, a total of 43 SNPs were detected, comprising 39 variants in exon 4: c.202G>A (p.V68M), and 4 variants in exon 8: c.722G>A (p.R241H), c.757G>A (p.D253N), c.782A>C (p.E261A) (Fig. 6A-B). Notably, all variants occurring in exon 8 were located in the RING domain of RNF126, which interacts with E2. Interestingly, we conducted chi-square tests on the genotype frequency of RNF126 and performed logistic regression analysis on the sites showing significant differences to elucidate the correlation between RNF126 variants and nonobstructive azoospermia or oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. We detected a significant variation in the c.202G>A (χ2 = 122.79, P<0.0001), c.722G>A (χ2 = 77.073, P<0.0001), and c.782A>C (χ2 = 160.619, P<0.0001) sites. Additionally, we observed a considerably higher genotype frequency of these four variants (c.202G>A, c.722G>A, c.757G>A, and c.782A>C) in RNF126 compared to the normal population in gnomAD. These data suggest a positive correlation between RNF126 variants at these sites and the risk of oligoasthenoteratozoospermia or nonobstructive azoospermia (Fig. 6C). Additionally, we analyzed the conservation of these four variants across species and found high conservation except for the R241H site, with V68M, D253N, and E261A showing higher interspecies conservation.Fig. 6RNF126 mutants in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia or nonobstructive azoospermia patients.. A) Illustration of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants in exonic regions of RNF126 detected in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and nonobstructive azoospermia patients.. B) The whole blood DNA of the patient was extracted for Sanger sequencing, and the mutation sites were verified in the first generation. Compared with the reference sequence, heterozygous bimodal variants appeared at RNF126 c.202, c.722, c.757, and c.782, indicating the presence of nucleotide changes.. C) RNF126 mutation frequencies in patient samples and risk analysis using logistic regression. The frequency of RNF126 variant sites was compared between patients and healthy people using the gnomAD database. In oligoasthenospermic/azoospermic males, the variation frequency of each mutation site was considerably greater than that in the general population.. D) Conservation analysis demonstrates high conservation of the identified mutation sites within RNF126 across species, except for the R241H site.. E) In vitro self-ubiquitination levels of RNF126 variants. Purified RNF126 wild-type (WT), RNF126 C229/232 mutant (MU), and three patient-derived RNF126 mutants (R241H, E261A and D253N) were subjected to in vitro reactions with HA-Ub, E1, E2, and ATP. The self-ubiquitination levels of RNF126 were evaluated by Western blotting.. F) The E261A and D253N mutants did not increase the ubiquitination of MRE11. HEK293T cells expressing FLAG-MRE11 were cotransfected with HA-Ub and RNF126 WT or R241H, E261A and D253N mutants. Cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG followed by in vivo ubiquitination assay analysis of MRE11 polyubiquitination.. G) Wild-type RNF126 promotes HR efficiency, whereas the R241H, E261A, and D253N mutants are unable to do so. RNF126 knockdown DR-GFP U2OS cells were cotransfected with different mutants of RNF126 (WT, V68M, R241H, E261A or D253N) with the I-SCEI plasmid for 48 h, and the percentage of GFP+cells was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Data are mean ± s.d. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed unpaired t tests. Data are representative of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01; n.s., not significant..We investigated the relationship between the RING domain and the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF126 by purifying an established RNF126 mutant with inactivated E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (C229A/C232A) as well as patient-derived RNF126 mutants in the RING domain. In vitro ubiquitination experiments were conducted to evaluate the self-ubiquitination capability of RNF126. Remarkably, we observed a significant inhibition of self-ubiquitination in vitro for the D253N and E261A mutants of RNF126, indicating a reduction in E3 ubiquitin ligase activity resulting from these variants (Fig. 6E). Furthermore, we found that the RNF126 V68M mutant exhibited no alteration in its self-ubiquitination ability in vitro (Fig. S7A). Subsequent ubiquitination experiments in cells revealed a significant reduction in the ubiquitination of MRE11, an RNF126-regulated HR substrate, for two of the three RING domain mutants: D253N and E261A. This result aligns with the findings from the in vitro evaluation of RNF126 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Fig. 6F). And we discovered that the interaction between RNF126 and its E2 UBCH5b was weakened after mutations at the D253 and E261 sites (Fig. S7B). Additionally, we evaluated the effect of these four mutation sites on the efficacy of HR repair using the DR-GFP U2OS system. Interestingly, while the R241H, D253N, and E261A mutants of RNF126 did not significantly restore the reduced HR efficiency caused by RNF126 knockdown, both the WT RNF126 and V68M mutant displayed some degree of recovery (Fig. 6G). Taken together, these results support a positive association between RNF126 variants and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia or nonobstructive azoospermia. Specifically, the E261A and D253N variants in RNF126 may hinder HR repair by reducing its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, thereby affecting meiotic recombination processes.

Rnf126 is needed for maintaining fertility in male micePreviously, we generated a whole-body Rnf126 knockout (KO) mouse model. During the process of breeding heterozygous Rnf126 knockout mice to generate homozygous knockout mice, we observed a significant decrease in the reproductive rate in the heterozygous mice after three generations. We subsequently assessed the expression profile of Rnf126 across different mouse tissues and observed its highest expression level in the testes (Fig. 1A). Additionally, we observed a pronounced increase in Rnf126 transcription during the second transcription wave of spermatogenesis (Fig. 1B). The human protein atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000070423-RNF126) indicates predominant expression of RNF126 protein in human skeletal muscle and testis, with notably elevated levels in spermatocytes (Fig. S1A and B). These findings suggest that RNF126 likely plays a role in testicular development and spermatogenesis.Fig. 1Rnf126 is needed for maintaining fertility in male mice.. A) Expression profile of Rnf126 in various mouse tissues, with the testes showing the highest expression level. Relative quantification of Rnf126 expression was performed using qPCR, with heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, brain, and testis tissues obtained from three male mice.. B) Pronounced increase in Rnf126 transcription during the second transcription wave of spermatogenesis. Relative quantification of Rnf126 expression was performed using qPCR, with testis tissues obtained from male mice ranging from postnatal Day 0 (P0) to postnatal Day 56 (P56), with three male mice selected at each time point.. C) Targeting strategy used to generate whole-body KO mice (biocytogen).. D) Rnf126 was not detected at the protein level in the testes of KO mice. Rnf126 expression level in WT or KO mice measured by Western blot (left). Representative images of 2-month-old male WT and KO mice (right).. E-F) Significant reduction in the weight of testes in male KO mice compared to WT mice, while body weight remained unchanged. Body weight (E) and ratios of testis weight to body weight (F) for WT and KO mice at 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 2 months, and 8 months of age were measured and analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed unpaired t test (n = 5 per genotype). ** p < 0.01; n.s., not significant..

H) H&E staining of WT and KO testes and epididymites from 2-month-old mice. Scale bar = 50 μm.. I-K) Smaller testes and epididymites with reduced diameters of seminiferous tubules and increased proportions of empty seminiferous tubules and empty ductus epididymites in KO mice. Statistical results for the seminiferous tubule diameters (I), empty seminiferous tubule (J) and empty ductus epididymite (K) percentages of WT and KO mice at 2 months of age. At least 100 tubules were counted from at least 3 different mice. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed unpaired t test. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; n.s., not significant.. L) Reduced sperm count and decreased sperm motility in KO mice. Sperm count and motility in 4-month-old mice were assessed using CASA. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed unpaired t test (n = 16 per genotype). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; n.s., not significant.. M) Decreased reproductive ability in male KO mice. Fertility assessment of male WT and KO mice was conducted, with six male mice aged over 2 months and under 4 months selected in each group for individual matings with four 2-month-old wild-type female mice.Rnf126 whole-body KO mice were generated by introducing CMV-Cre into Rnf126loxp/loxp mice. The successful establishment of KO mice was confirmed through PCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C-D and S2A). While the male KO mice appeared indistinguishable from the wild-type (WT) mice and exhibited normal survival, their testes displayed a marked decrease in size and weight (Fig. 1D-F and S2B). Adult male KO mice displayed reduced sizes of the testes and epididymides compared to WT mice. This reduction was accompanied with a decrease in seminiferous tubule diameter and an increased proportion of empty seminiferous tubules. Additionally, the epididymides of KO mice lacked sperm, which can be visualized using H&E staining (Fig. 1G-K and S2C-D). Computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) was employed to examine sperm quality. Compared to WT mice, KO mice exhibited a reduced sperm count and decreased sperm motility (Fig. 1L). We proceeded to evaluate the reproductive capacity of male KO mice in comparison to WT mice. Two-month-old WT and KO male mice were consecutively mated with four adult WT female mice over a three-month period (n = 6). The control group of male mice consistently produced typical offspring, with an average litter size of 6.81 ± 2.436 per litter. Conversely, KO males exhibited a significant decline in reproductive capacity, resulting in an average litter size of 1.5 ± 2.891 (Fig. 1M). Moreover, no notable disparities were found in the levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), and testosterone (TESTO) between adult 2-month-old KO mice and WT mice (Fig. S2E). Nevertheless, in 8-month-old mice, a downward trend in LH, E2, and TESTO levels was observed (Fig. S2E). To eliminate potential confounding factors, we employed Vasa-Cre to establish testis-specific Rnf126 conditional heterozygous (Rnf126cHE) or homozygous (Rnf126cKO) KO mice (Fig. S3A-B). We observed that compared to the control group, both Rnf126cHE and Rnf126cKO mice exhibited reduced size of the testes and epididymides, decreased diameter of seminiferous tubules, increased number of empty seminiferous tubules, and reduced sperm count in the epididymis (Fig. S3C–H). Furthermore, fertility assessment of male mice revealed a dose-dependent decrease in reproductive capacity following specific heterozygous or homozygous deletion of Rnf126 in the testes (Fig. S3I). Collectively, these findings indicate that RNF126 serves as a pivotal regulator of spermatogenesis and male reproductive function.

Previously, we generated a whole-body Rnf126 knockout (KO) mouse model. During the process of breeding heterozygous Rnf126 knockout mice to generate homozygous knockout mice, we observed a significant decrease in the reproductive rate in the heterozygous mice after three generations. We subsequently assessed the expression profile of Rnf126 across different mouse tissues and observed its highest expression level in the testes (Fig. 1A). Additionally, we observed a pronounced increase in Rnf126 transcription during the second transcription wave of spermatogenesis (Fig. 1B). The human protein atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000070423-RNF126) indicates predominant expression of RNF126 protein in human skeletal muscle and testis, with notably elevated levels in spermatocytes (Fig. S1A and B). These findings suggest that RNF126 likely plays a role in testicular development and spermatogenesis.Fig. 1Rnf126 is needed for maintaining fertility in male mice..

Fertility assessment of male WT and KO mice was conducted, with six male mice aged over 2 months and under 4 months selected in each group for individual matings with four 2-month-old wild-type female mice.

Rnf126 whole-body KO mice were generated by introducing CMV-Cre into Rnf126loxp/loxp mice. The successful establishment of KO mice was confirmed through PCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C-D and S2A). While the male KO mice appeared indistinguishable from the wild-type (WT) mice and exhibited normal survival, their testes displayed a marked decrease in size and weight (Fig. 1D-F and S2B). Adult male KO mice displayed reduced sizes of the testes and epididymides compared to WT mice. This reduction was accompanied with a decrease in seminiferous tubule diameter and an increased proportion of empty seminiferous tubules. Additionally, the epididymides of KO mice lacked sperm, which can be visualized using H&E staining (Fig. 1G-K and S2C-D).

To eliminate potential confounding factors, we employed Vasa-Cre to establish testis-specific Rnf126 conditional heterozygous (Rnf126cHE) or homozygous (Rnf126cKO) KO mice (Fig. S3A-B). We observed that compared to the control group, both Rnf126cHE and Rnf126cKO mice exhibited reduced size of the testes and epididymides, decreased diameter of seminiferous tubules, increased number of empty seminiferous tubules, and reduced sperm count in the epididymis (Fig. S3C–H). Furthermore, fertility assessment of male mice revealed a dose-dependent decrease in reproductive capacity following specific heterozygous or homozygous deletion of Rnf126 in the testes (Fig. S3I). Collectively, these findings indicate that RNF126 serves as a pivotal regulator of spermatogenesis and male reproductive function.

Rnf126 deficiency causes spermatogenesis arrest at meiotic prophase ITo investigate the effect of Rnf126 deficiency on crucial stages of spermatogenesis, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on testicular tissue acquired from both WT and KO mice (Fig. 2A and S4). We employed nonlinear dimensional reduction (UMAP) in R-Seura to classify cells into 20 clusters. Cluster analysis unveiled discrete cell clusters within the testicular cells of both WT and KO mice (Fig. 2A). Remarkably, Rnf126 deficiency led to a significant rise in the proportion of cells at the A1 stage, A1-IPL stage, and meiotic prophase I, whereas a marked decrease was evident in the proportion of cells at the meiotic prophase II stage and round spermatids (Fig. 2B-F). These findings provide strong evidence that Rnf126 deficiency primarily hinders spermatogenesis at the meiotic prophase I stage, leading to a subsequent notable decrease in the proportion of cells transitioning into the meiotic prophase II stage and generating round spermatids. Additionally, a comparative analysis of nongerm cells demonstrated a noteworthy elevation in the proportion of Sertoli cells and a substantial reduction in the proportion of Leydig cells in KO mouse testes (Fig. 2G and H). Subsequently, we examined the expression pattern of Rnf126 across various cell types within the testes. In line with observations in human tissues, Rnf126 demonstrated predominant expression in germ cells in mice, with the highest expression levels observed during the meiotic phase (Fig. 2I and S1B). These findings highlight the critical role of Rnf126 in spermatogenesis, emphasizing that its deficiency predominantly results in the arrest of spermatogenesis at the meiotic prophase I stage.Fig. 2Impact of Rnf126 deficiency on spermatogenesis stages revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis..

Rnf126 deficiency alters gene expression involved in meiosis and induces aberrant apoptosis in meiotic prophase ITo further explore the effects of Rnf126 KO during meiosis, we specifically isolated cells in this phase from the single-cell RNA sequencing dataset. Through a comparison of transcriptome data between the WT and KO groups, we detected differentially transcribed genes (DTGs) and conducted separate Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses for the downregulated and upregulated genes within the DTGs (Fig. 3A). The GO analysis revealed that the downregulated DTGs following Rnf126 knockout exhibited significant enrichment in annotated functions associated with spermatogenesis and cell differentiation. Conversely, no enrichment related to sperm generation was observed among the upregulated DTGs. Interestingly, the upregulated DTGs demonstrated a notable enrichment in pathways associated with promoting DNA double-strand break homologous recombination repair and apoptosis signaling (Fig. 3B and C). We then utilized qPCR to validate that the downregulated DTGs associated with spermatogenesis, fertilization and development displayed a partial dose-dependent reduction in mRNA levels following Rnf126 KO (Fig. 3D). Then, we examined the expression of meiosis marker genes related to spermatogenesis in WT and KO groups at different stages and found that the expression of these genes was downregulated in the meiotic phase I following Rnf126 KO (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, the batch correlation analysis in single tissue (sincorBatch, https://guotosky.vip:13838/GTBA/) provided robust evidence supporting the correlation between Rnf126 and spermatogenesis as well as male infertility, as demonstrated by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) testicular data and Testicular Germ Cell Tumors (TCGA) data from TCGA database (Fig. 3F). In conclusion, based on the aforementioned analysis and validation, we established that Rnf126 deficiency leads to the downregulation of genes associated with spermatogenesis during meiosis. Furthermore, Rnf126 deficiency induces the activation of DNA double-strand break homologous recombination repair and apoptosis signaling pathways during meiosis.Fig. 3Impact of Rnf126 KO on meiosis and associated pathways in spermatogenesis..

E) The expression of MI markers was downregulated in the MI cells of the KO group. The line graph shows the expression changes of a subset of representative MI markers during different stages of meiosis, including A1, In.IPL, MI, MII, and sperm stages, in both WT and KO groups.. F) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showing an association between RNF126 and male infertility and spermatogenesis using GTEx testicular data and TGCT data from TCGA.. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)To further substantiate and validate the mechanism underlying the pronounced loss of germ cells and decreased fertility in Rnf126-deficient mice, we conducted an immunofluorescence staining analysis to examine the expression of germ cell markers in the testes of 2-month-old adult WT and KO male mice. The PLZF staining data demonstrated a comparable number of PLZF-positive cells, representing undifferentiated spermatogonia, in nonempty seminiferous tubules between the KO and WT groups. The absence of Rnf126 did not influence the abundance of undifferentiated spermatogonia during spermatogenesis (Fig. S5A-B). Moreover, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of DDX4-labeled germ cells and a substantial increase in the proportion of SOX9-labeled Sertoli cells in the KO group compared to the WT group, with only supporting cells found in empty seminiferous tubules (Fig. S5C-E). Additionally, nonempty seminiferous tubules of the KO group exhibited a higher proportion of SYCP3-positive cells, a marker for meiosis initiation and a component of the synaptonemal complex. To further confirm that these observations were specifically attributable to the deletion of Rnf126 in germ cells, we conducted similar marker analyses in germ cell-specific Rnf126-KO mice. Consistently, the cHE and cKO groups displayed a significantly diminished proportion of DDX4-labeled germ cells, accompanied by a considerable increase in the proportion of SOX9-positive Sertoli cells (Fig. 4 A-C and S6A), mirroring the phenotype observed in patients with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. Notably, the cHE and cKO groups demonstrated a marked increase in the proportion of SYCP3-positive cells within nonempty seminiferous tubules (Fig. 4D-E and S6B). Furthermore, TUNEL assay results revealed a significant elevation in the proportion of apoptotic cells in the cHE and cKO groups compared to the WT group (Fig. 4F-G and S6C). Taken together, the results indicate that the loss of Rnf126 impedes spermatogenesis, resulting in a reduced proportion of germ cells, an increased proportion of premeiotic cells, and an elevated proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, the data suggest that Rnf126 regulates these processes in a dose-dependent manner, with varying levels of Rnf126 affecting the severity of spermatogenetic disruptions. Collectively, these findings suggest that the decreased sperm count, and decreased fertility observed in male mice with Rnf126 deficiency might be attributed to disruptions in meiotic phase I, potentially through a dose-dependent regulation mechanism exerted by Rnf126.Fig. 4Loss of Rnf126 results in meiotic defects and increased apoptosis during spermatogenesis..

To further explore the effects of Rnf126 KO during meiosis, we specifically isolated cells in this phase from the single-cell RNA sequencing dataset. Through a comparison of transcriptome data between the WT and KO groups, we detected differentially transcribed genes (DTGs) and conducted separate Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses for the downregulated and upregulated genes within the DTGs (Fig. 3A). The GO analysis revealed that the downregulated DTGs following Rnf126 knockout exhibited significant enrichment in annotated functions associated with spermatogenesis and cell differentiation. Conversely, no enrichment related to sperm generation was observed among the upregulated DTGs. Interestingly, the upregulated DTGs demonstrated a notable enrichment in pathways associated with promoting DNA double-strand break homologous recombination repair and apoptosis signaling (Fig. 3B and C). We then utilized qPCR to validate that the downregulated DTGs associated with spermatogenesis, fertilization and development displayed a partial dose-dependent reduction in mRNA levels following Rnf126 KO (Fig. 3D). Then, we examined the expression of meiosis marker genes related to spermatogenesis in WT and KO groups at different stages and found that the expression of these genes was downregulated in the meiotic phase I following Rnf126 KO (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, the batch correlation analysis in single tissue (sincorBatch, https://guotosky.vip:13838/GTBA/) provided robust evidence supporting the correlation between Rnf126 and spermatogenesis as well as male infertility, as demonstrated by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) testicular data and Testicular Germ Cell Tumors (TCGA) data from TCGA database (Fig. 3F). In conclusion, based on the aforementioned analysis and validation, we established that Rnf126 deficiency leads to the downregulation of genes associated with spermatogenesis during meiosis. Furthermore, Rnf126 deficiency induces the activation of DNA double-strand break homologous recombination repair and apoptosis signaling pathways during meiosis.Fig. 3Impact of Rnf126 KO on meiosis and associated pathways in spermatogenesis..

To further substantiate and validate the mechanism underlying the pronounced loss of germ cells and decreased fertility in Rnf126-deficient mice, we conducted an immunofluorescence staining analysis to examine the expression of germ cell markers in the testes of 2-month-old adult WT and KO male mice. The PLZF staining data demonstrated a comparable number of PLZF-positive cells, representing undifferentiated spermatogonia, in nonempty seminiferous tubules between the KO and WT groups. The absence of Rnf126 did not influence the abundance of undifferentiated spermatogonia during spermatogenesis (Fig. S5A-B). Moreover, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of DDX4-labeled germ cells and a substantial increase in the proportion of SOX9-labeled Sertoli cells in the KO group compared to the WT group, with only supporting cells found in empty seminiferous tubules (Fig. S5C-E). Additionally, nonempty seminiferous tubules of the KO group exhibited a higher proportion of SYCP3-positive cells, a marker for meiosis initiation and a component of the synaptonemal complex. To further confirm that these observations were specifically attributable to the deletion of Rnf126 in germ cells, we conducted similar marker analyses in germ cell-specific Rnf126-KO mice. Consistently, the cHE and cKO groups displayed a significantly diminished proportion of DDX4-labeled germ cells, accompanied by a considerable increase in the proportion of SOX9-positive Sertoli cells (Fig. 4 A-C and S6A), mirroring the phenotype observed in patients with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. Notably, the cHE and cKO groups demonstrated a marked increase in the proportion of SYCP3-positive cells within nonempty seminiferous tubules (Fig. 4D-E and S6B). Furthermore, TUNEL assay results revealed a significant elevation in the proportion of apoptotic cells in the cHE and cKO groups compared to the WT group (Fig. 4F-G and S6C). Taken together, the results indicate that the loss of Rnf126 impedes spermatogenesis, resulting in a reduced proportion of germ cells, an increased proportion of premeiotic cells, and an elevated proportion of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, the data suggest that Rnf126 regulates these processes in a dose-dependent manner, with varying levels of Rnf126 affecting the severity of spermatogenetic disruptions. Collectively, these findings suggest that the decreased sperm count, and decreased fertility observed in male mice with Rnf126 deficiency might be attributed to disruptions in meiotic phase I, potentially through a dose-dependent regulation mechanism exerted by Rnf126.Fig. 4Loss of Rnf126 results in meiotic defects and increased apoptosis during spermatogenesis..

Rnf126 facilitates homologous recombination repair during meiotic divisionIn a prior study, we uncovered the role of RNF126 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in facilitating the repair of DSBs through the ubiquitination of MRE11. Multiple DNA DSBs and sister chromatid exchanges occur during meiosis and rely on the completion of HR repair. Therefore, we hypothesize that the impaired progression of meiosis I in KO mice results from inhibited HR repair mediated by RNF126. Mouse spermatogenesis consists of 12 discernible stages characterized by the composition of spermatocytes found within the seminiferous tubules. To identify the specific stage affected by Rnf126 gene KO during meiosis, we initially conducted H&E staining on testes obtained from 2-month-old mice to monitor the stages of the seminiferous tubule epithelium. A comparison between the testes of Rnf126 KO mice and control mice demonstrated a decrease in the proportion of cells in stage IV, along with an increase in the proportions of cells in stages IX-XII and I-III, signifying a disruption in the transition from pachytene to diplotene (Fig. 5A and B). To further discern the delayed stage within meiotic prophase, chromosome spreads were prepared from spermatocytes of 1-month-old mouse testes, followed by immunostaining with anti-SYCP3 and anti-γH2AX antibodies. The immunostaining patterns of SYCP3 and γH2AX enabled the distinction of leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, and diplotene stages in spermatocytes (Fig. 5C). The proportion of pachytene spermatocytes in the KO mice increased from 57.4 % to 66.8 %, while the proportion of diplotene cells decreased from 7.6 % to 2.6 % compared to the WT group (Fig. 5D). These findings suggest compromised progression from pachytene to diplotene spermatocytes. During the pachytene and diplotene stages, meiotic recombination events take place, including sister chromatid pairing and exchange. At this stage, homologous chromosomes pair to form tetrad complexes, enabling genetic exchanges and DNA recombination that enhance genetic diversity. To further investigate this observation, immunostaining using anti-SYCP3 and anti-RPA2 antibodies was performed to examine the recombination process during meiosis. RPA2, a crucial protein involved in DNA replication and repair, safeguards and stabilizes ssDNA by binding to it, thereby preventing its reannealing or degradation during DNA recombination. The results revealed a significantly higher number of RPA2 foci in zygotene, pachytene, and diplotene spermatocytes within the KO group relative to the WT group (Fig. 5E-F). These outcomes imply that Rnf126 deficiency obstructs DNA recombination and leads to pachytene arrest in spermatocytes. Moreover, the TUNEL assay exhibited a notable increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells following Rnf126 KO (Fig. 5 G-H). Additionally, utilizing TUNEL-labeled apoptotic cells and SYCP3-labeled meiotic prophase cells, we detected the occurrence of apoptotic cells during meiotic prophase (Fig. 5I). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Rnf126 deficiency disrupts spermatogenesis, leading to defective meiotic recombination and subsequent arrest at the pachytene stage, ultimately culminating in apoptosis.Fig. 5Rnf126 KO impairs meiotic progression and recombination, leading to pachytene arrest and increased apoptosis during spermatogenesis..

RNF126 variants attenuate its effect on HR and are associated with nonobstructive azoospermia and oligozoospermia male patientsTo understand the clinical significance of RNF126, we investigated the association between RNF126 and male infertility. Whole blood samples were collected from 193 patients diagnosed with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia or nonobstructive azoospermia, aged between 20 and 40 years, with unknown etiology. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify RNF126 gene variants in these patients. In the exonic regions of the RNF126 gene, a total of 43 SNPs were detected, comprising 39 variants in exon 4: c.202G>A (p.V68M), and 4 variants in exon 8: c.722G>A (p.R241H), c.757G>A (p.D253N), c.782A>C (p.E261A) (Fig. 6A-B). Notably, all variants occurring in exon 8 were located in the RING domain of RNF126, which interacts with E2. Interestingly, we conducted chi-square tests on the genotype frequency of RNF126 and performed logistic regression analysis on the sites showing significant differences to elucidate the correlation between RNF126 variants and nonobstructive azoospermia or oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. We detected a significant variation in the c.202G>A (χ2 = 122.79, P<0.0001), c.722G>A (χ2 = 77.073, P<0.0001), and c.782A>C (χ2 = 160.619, P<0.0001) sites. Additionally, we observed a considerably higher genotype frequency of these four variants (c.202G>A, c.722G>A, c.757G>A, and c.782A>C) in RNF126 compared to the normal population in gnomAD. These data suggest a positive correlation between RNF126 variants at these sites and the risk of oligoasthenoteratozoospermia or nonobstructive azoospermia (Fig. 6C). Additionally, we analyzed the conservation of these four variants across species and found high conservation except for the R241H site, with V68M, D253N, and E261A showing higher interspecies conservation.Fig. 6RNF126 mutants in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia or nonobstructive azoospermia patients.. A) Illustration of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants in exonic regions of RNF126 detected in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and nonobstructive azoospermia patients.. B) The whole blood DNA of the patient was extracted for Sanger sequencing, and the mutation sites were verified in the first generation. Compared with the reference sequence, heterozygous bimodal variants appeared at RNF126 c.202, c.722, c.757, and c.782, indicating the presence of nucleotide changes.. C) RNF126 mutation frequencies in patient samples and risk analysis using logistic regression. The frequency of RNF126 variant sites was compared between patients and healthy people using the gnomAD database. In oligoasthenospermic/azoospermic males, the variation frequency of each mutation site was considerably greater than that in the general population.. D) Conservation analysis demonstrates high conservation of the identified mutation sites within RNF126 across species, except for the R241H site.. E) In vitro self-ubiquitination levels of RNF126 variants. Purified RNF126 wild-type (WT), RNF126 C229/232 mutant (MU), and three patient-derived RNF126 mutants (R241H, E261A and D253N) were subjected to in vitro reactions with HA-Ub, E1, E2, and ATP. The self-ubiquitination levels of RNF126 were evaluated by Western blotting.. F) The E261A and D253N mutants did not increase the ubiquitination of MRE11.

G) Wild-type RNF126 promotes HR efficiency, whereas the R241H, E261A, and D253N mutants are unable to do so. RNF126 knockdown DR-GFP U2OS cells were cotransfected with different mutants of RNF126 (WT, V68M, R241H, E261A or D253N) with the I-SCEI plasmid for 48 h, and the percentage of GFP+cells was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Data are mean ± s.d. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed unpaired t tests. Data are representative of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01; n.s., not significant..We investigated the relationship between the RING domain and the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF126 by purifying an established RNF126 mutant with inactivated E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (C229A/C232A) as well as patient-derived RNF126 mutants in the RING domain. In vitro ubiquitination experiments were conducted to evaluate the self-ubiquitination capability of RNF126. Remarkably, we observed a significant inhibition of self-ubiquitination in vitro for the D253N and E261A mutants of RNF126, indicating a reduction in E3 ubiquitin ligase activity resulting from these variants (Fig. 6E). Furthermore, we found that the RNF126 V68M mutant exhibited no alteration in its self-ubiquitination ability in vitro (Fig. S7A). Subsequent ubiquitination experiments in cells revealed a significant reduction in the ubiquitination of MRE11, an RNF126-regulated HR substrate, for two of the three RING domain mutants: D253N and E261A. This result aligns with the findings from the in vitro evaluation of RNF126 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Fig. 6F). And we discovered that the interaction between RNF126 and its E2 UBCH5b was weakened after mutations at the D253 and E261 sites (Fig. S7B). Additionally, we evaluated the effect of these four mutation sites on the efficacy of HR repair using the DR-GFP U2OS system. Interestingly, while the R241H, D253N, and E261A mutants of RNF126 did not significantly restore the reduced HR efficiency caused by RNF126 knockdown, both the WT RNF126 and V68M mutant displayed some degree of recovery (Fig. 6G). Taken together, these results support a positive association between RNF126 variants and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia or nonobstructive azoospermia. Specifically, the E261A and D253N variants in RNF126 may hinder HR repair by reducing its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, thereby affecting meiotic recombination processes.

To understand the clinical significance of RNF126, we investigated the association between RNF126 and male infertility. Whole blood samples were collected from 193 patients diagnosed with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia or nonobstructive azoospermia, aged between 20 and 40 years, with unknown etiology. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify RNF126 gene variants in these patients. In the exonic regions of the RNF126 gene, a total of 43 SNPs were detected, comprising 39 variants in exon 4: c.202G>A (p.V68M), and 4 variants in exon 8: c.722G>A (p.R241H), c.757G>A (p.D253N), c.782A>C (p.E261A) (Fig. 6A-B). Notably, all variants occurring in exon 8 were located in the RING domain of RNF126, which interacts with E2. Interestingly, we conducted chi-square tests on the genotype frequency of RNF126 and performed logistic regression analysis on the sites showing significant differences to elucidate the correlation between RNF126 variants and nonobstructive azoospermia or oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. We detected a significant variation in the c.202G>A (χ2 = 122.79, P<0.0001), c.722G>A (χ2 = 77.073, P<0.0001), and c.782A>C (χ2 = 160.619, P<0.0001) sites. Additionally, we observed a considerably higher genotype frequency of these four variants (c.202G>A, c.722G>A, c.757G>A, and c.782A>C) in RNF126 compared to the normal population in gnomAD. These data suggest a positive correlation between RNF126 variants at these sites and the risk of oligoasthenoteratozoospermia or nonobstructive azoospermia (Fig. 6C). Additionally, we analyzed the conservation of these four variants across species and found high conservation except for the R241H site, with V68M, D253N, and E261A showing higher interspecies conservation.Fig. 6RNF126 mutants in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia or nonobstructive azoospermia patients..

DiscussionHR repair is crucial for spermatogenesis and fertility, serving as a hallmark of meiosis in most sexually reproducing organisms [32]. At the core of this process lies the formation and repair of programmed DNA DSBs. In meiosis, DSBs are necessary to establish physical connections between homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes, ensuring the proper transfer of genetic information to each gamete. Without the action of recombination, homologous chromosomes are prone to missegregate during the first meiotic division, leading to the generation of aneuploid gametes, a major cause of human miscarriages and genetic disorders such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome [33]. However, several studies have shown that not all HR-regulating factors are associated with spermatogenesis, such as RAD54, indicating a lack of comprehensive understanding of specific regulatory factors in this process [34]. RNF126, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been reported to possess diverse functions, including DNA damage response and repair, cancer development, tumor immunity, cytoplasmic protein quality control, and intracellular protein sorting, among others. However, there are few articles investigating the direct role of RNF126 at the organismal level in animals. In our current study, we confirm the critical role of Rnf126 in maintaining fertility. Heterozygous or homozygous loss of Rnf126 leads to testicular atrophy, abnormal seminiferous tubule structure, reduced sperm count, and spermatogenic arrest at the meiotic prophase I stage, with these phenotypes exhibiting a certain dosage dependency on Rnf126. However, no relevant reports currently exist to establish a connection between the loss or functional inactivation of RNF126 and Down syndrome or other related syndromes. Further investigation is needed to explore this potential association and confirm whether the loss or functional inactivation of RNF126 can serve as a diagnostic marker for genetic disorders such as Down syndrome or other related syndromes.Our single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining results collectively indicate that deletion of Rnf126 arrests the meiotic process at prophase I. Interestingly, we observed the enrichment of several downregulated genes in the meiotic phase, many of which play crucial roles in spermatogenesis. For instance, DMC1, SIRT7, and PRDM9 were found to be enriched. DMC1, a recombinase specific to meiosis, acts as a core player in meiotic recombination by promoting the removal of ssDNA-binding proteins and facilitating 3′ end extension into homologous double-strand DNA [35], [36]. SIRT7 plays a critical role in meiosis by promoting chromosomal association, and PRDM9 determines the location of recombination hotspots (DSBs induced by SPO11 that nonrandomly aggregate into narrow 1–2 kilobase intervals) by binding to specific DNA motifs and trimethylating histone H3 on adjacent nucleosomes [37], [38]. The downregulation of these genes during prophase I in Rnf126 KO mice suggests impaired meiotic recombination. The mechanism by which RNF126 regulates the expression of these genes requires further investigation. In our previous research on breast cancer, we discovered that RNF126 enhances the exonuclease activity of MRE11 through ubiquitination, leading to increased RPA binding to ssDNA and ATR phosphorylation, ultimately promoting HR repair of DNA DSBs and enhancing radioresistance in triple-negative breast cancer cells [30]. Additionally, previous research reported that RNF126 can interact with E2F1 to enhance BRCA1 gene transcription, thereby promoting HR [39]. Furthermore, our previous studies have shown that RNF126 promotes cell cycle progression by facilitating p21 degradation, and loss of RNF126 leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest [27]. These findings suggest that RNF126 may influence meiosis through multiple pathways. It is worth noting that RNF126 deletion results in partial depletion of seminiferous tubules, leaving only supporting cells, while the majority of seminiferous tubules still harbor germ cells, albeit at reduced proportions. This observation suggests that in addition to impairing meiosis at prophase I, RNF126 deletion may partially affect the initiation stage of spermatogenesis, although compensatory mechanisms allow for the continuation of spermatogenesis in most seminiferous tubules until arrested at meiotic stages.Although most genes involved in regulating HR have been found to impact sperm development in mice, gene abnormalities have not been detected in patients with unexplained oligoasthenoteratozoospermia or nonobstructive azoospermia; this suggests that certain genes may have different roles in spermogenesis between mice and humans. In our study, we identified four missense mutation sites (V68M, R241H, E261A, and D253N) of RNF126 associated with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and nonobstructive azoospermia. Among these sites, R241, E261, and D253 are located within the RING domain of RNF126, which is primarily responsible for the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF126. The R241H, E261A, and D253N variants led to reduced efficiency of RNF126 in HR. Interestingly, only the E261A and D253N variants directly inhibited the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF126. Based on our previous findings, the decreased E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF126 inhibits MRE11 ubiquitination, thereby suppressing its DNA exonuclease activity and reducing the efficiency of HR repair. According to previous reports, RNF126 regulates DNA HR repair through different mechanisms. For the R241H variant, which occurs within the RING domain and inhibits homologous recombination repair efficiency, we hypothesize that it may alter the protein conformation of RNF126, thereby affecting its interaction with other substrates involved in HR repair. Although the V68M variant occurs in the fourth exon of RNF126, which lacks specific domains and does not affect the impact of RNF126 on HR repair, we cannot exclude the possibility that RNF126 regulates sperm development through other pathways, such as transcriptional regulatory activity. Notably, the D253N variant showed a χ2 value of 3.292 and a p value of 0.070 in the χ2 test, indicating no significant difference. However, the mutation rate at this site was higher than that in the genomAD database population, which could be due to the limited sample size in our study. In addition, we observed that the V68M, R241H, D253N, and E261A variants were all heterozygous variants, which may be attributed to the fact that homozygous variants are not viable, or that carriers of heterozygous variants already cannot produce offspring normally.Given the crucial involvement of RNF126 in the HR repair pathway and its significant expression in the testes, strategies aimed at enhancing or restoring RNF126 function could provide novel therapeutic avenues. This could involve small molecules or biologics to augment the enzyme's activity or mimic its action, potentially addressing the compromised HR repair in individuals with specific RNF126 mutations. Moreover, gene therapy could directly amend the dysfunctional RNF126 gene, offering a personalized approach to rectify the genetic basis of infertility associated with RNF126 dysfunction. Additionally, genetic screening for RNF126 mutations in idiopathic male infertility cases could facilitate the development of tailored therapeutic strategies, delving into the unique molecular defects of an individual's infertility, thereby advancing the frontier of personalized medicine in this domain.Furthermore, the critical role of RNF126 in DNA repair via homologous recombination HR and NHEJ pathways signifies its importance in maintaining genomic stability, with its dysfunction posing risks for cancer and other diseases linked to genomic instability. Its interactions in promoting BRCA1 expression, facilitating HR by ubiquitinating MRE11, and advancing NHEJ through Ku80 ubiquitination underline its essential function in genome integrity. Dysfunction, through reduced expression or altered activity, undermines DNA repair efficiency, leading to DNA damage accumulation and heightened tumorigenesis risk. Beyond cancer, RNF126′s dysfunction suggests broader health implications, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance chemotherapy sensitivity. However, targeting RNF126 requires comprehensive understanding to circumvent potential adverse effects on genomic stability or normal cellular functions. Continued research into RNF126′s roles and dysfunctions is vital for developing targeted therapies to restore genomic integrity and improve patient outcomes in conditions marked by genomic instability.

ConclusionIn conclusion, the results obtained in this study revealed a substantial increase in RNF126 expression in human and mouse testes, emphasizing its pivotal role in male fertility. By generating Rnf126 KO mice either globally or specifically within the testes, we observed a noteworthy decrease in testicular size and weight after Rnf126 depletion, along with structural abnormalities in the seminiferous tubules. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in sperm production, leading to impaired fertility in male subjects. Additionally, utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining, we found that Rnf126 KO resulted in a decrease in spermatogenic cell numbers, arrest of sperm development at the meiotic prophase I stage, and activation of apoptotic signaling pathways. Additionally, we identified heterozygous mutation sites (V68M, R241H, D253N, and E261A) in RNF126, which were highly prevalent among patients diagnosed with unexplained oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and nonobstructive azoospermia. The R241H, D253N, and E261A mutation sites, located in the RING domain of RNF126, eliminated its inhibitory effect on HR repair; moreover, the D253N and E261A variants specifically resulted in reduced E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF126. Our findings demonstrate the association between RNF126 and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia as well as nonobstructive azoospermia, highlighting the potential of RNF126 as a diagnostic marker for these conditions and offering novel insights for the diagnosis and treatment of male infertility.
