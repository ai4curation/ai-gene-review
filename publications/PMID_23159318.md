Synthesis of H1° histone, in the developing rat brain, is also regulated at 
post-transcriptional level. Regulation of RNA metabolism depends on a series of 
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs); therefore, we searched for H1° mRNA-interacting 
proteins. With this aim, we used in vitro transcribed, biotinylated H1° RNA as 
bait to isolate, by a chromatographic approach, proteins which interact with 
this mRNA, in the nuclei of brain cells. Abundant RBPs, such as heterogeneous 
nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K and hnRNP A1, and molecular chaperones (heat 
shock cognate 70, Hsc70) were identified by mass spectrometry. Western blot 
analysis also revealed the presence of cold shock domain-containing protein 2 
(CSD-C2, also known as PIPPin), a brain-enriched RBP previously described in our 
laboratory. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to investigate the 
possibility that identified proteins interact with each other and with other 
nuclear proteins. We found that hnRNP K interacts with both hnRNP A1 and Hsc70 
whereas there is no interaction between hnRNP A1 and Hsc70. Moreover, CSD-C2 
interacts with hnRNP A1, Y box-binding protein 1 (YB-1), and hnRNP K. We also 
have indications that CSD-C2 interacts with Hsc70. Overall, we have contributed 
to the molecular characterization of a ribonucleoprotein particle possibly 
controlling H1° histone expression in the brain.
