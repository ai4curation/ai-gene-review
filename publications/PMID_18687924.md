During intracellular membrane trafficking and remodeling, protein complexes 
known as the ESCRTs (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) 
interact with membranes and are required for budding processes directed away 
from the cytosol, including the budding of intralumenal vesicles to form 
multivesicular bodies; for the budding of some enveloped viruses; and for 
daughter cell scission in cytokinesis. We found that the ESCRT-III proteins 
CHMP2A and CHMP3 (charged multivesicular body proteins 2A and 3) could assemble 
in vitro into helical tubular structures that expose their membrane interaction 
sites on the outside of the tubule, whereas the AAA-type adenosine 
triphosphatase VPS4 could bind on the inside of the tubule and disassemble the 
tubes upon adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis. CHMP2A and CHMP3 copolymerized in 
solution, and their membrane targeting was cooperatively enhanced on planar 
lipid bilayers. Such helical CHMP structures could thus assemble within the neck 
of an inwardly budding vesicle, catalyzing late steps in budding under the 
control of VPS4.
