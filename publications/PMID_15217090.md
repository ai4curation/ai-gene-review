Vanishing white matter disease (VWM) is a progressive cavitating disease of 
central white matter due to a deficiency of the translation initiation factor 
eIF2B. Oligodendrocytes appear to be numerically increased in some white matter 
areas, while decreased in others. We compared oligodendrocytes of cerebral, 
cerebellar, and pontine white matter from 5 VWM patients with those of 
age-matched controls by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry using 
antibodies to activated caspase-3, bak, bax, bcl-2, survivin, and Ki-67, as well 
as by the TUNEL technique. Oligodendrocytes were identified morphologically and 
quantified using an ocular grid. We observed statistically significant increases 
in their densities at all sites; Ki-67-labeled oligodendrocytes were identified 
in 2 of 5 patients. Apoptotic oligodendrocytes were documented in 3 of 5 
patients, while bcl-2 and survivin labeling was observed in 2 of 5 and 2 of 2 
patients, respectively. There was a trend toward an increase in apoptotic 
labeling of oligodendrocytes that was strongest in the cerebrum, the major locus 
of VWM, in the youngest and most severely affected patients. These data 
conclusively demonstrate increased oligodendrocytic densities in VWM; the 
increase is not an artifact of white matter contraction. Our data also document 
that oligodendrocytes undergo apoptosis, perhaps in conjunction with major 
neurologic crises, and that a subset of oligodendrocytes are able to persist and 
proliferate. Conflicting proliferative, cell-death, and survival signals impact 
the oligodendrocytes of VWM.
