Cell cycle plays a crucial role in regulating the pathway used to repair DNA 
double-strand breaks (DSBs). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, homologous 
recombination is primarily limited to non-G(1) cells as the formation of 
recombinogenic single-stranded DNA requires CDK1-dependent 5' to 3' resection of 
DNA ends. However, the effect of cell cycle on non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) 
is not yet clearly defined. Using an assay to quantitatively measure the 
contributions of each repair pathway to repair product formation and cellular 
survival after DSB induction, we found that NHEJ is most efficient at G(1), and 
markedly repressed at G(2). Repression of NHEJ at G(2) is achieved by efficient 
end resection and by the reduced association of core NHEJ proteins with DNA 
breaks, both of which depend on the CDK1 activity. Importantly, repression of 5' 
end resection by CDK1 inhibition at G(2) alone did not fully restore either 
physical association of Ku/Dnl4-Lif1 with DSBs or NHEJ proficiency to the level 
at G(1). Expression of excess Ku can partially offset the inhibition of end 
joining at G(2). The results suggest that regulation of Ku/Dnl4-Lif1 affinity 
for DNA ends may contribute to the cell cycle-dependent modulation of NHEJ 
efficiency.

Abstract

Cell cycle plays a crucial role in regulating the pathway used to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , homologous recombination is primarily limited to non-G 1 cells as the formation of recombinogenic single-stranded DNA requires CDK1 -dependent 5′ to 3′ resection of DNA ends. However, the effect of cell cycle on non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is not yet clearly defined. Using an assay to quantitatively measure the contributions of each repair pathway to repair product formation and cellular survival after DSB induction, we found that NHEJ is most efficient at G 1 , and markedly repressed at G 2 . Repression of NHEJ at G 2 is achieved by efficient end resection and by the reduced association of core NHEJ proteins with DNA breaks, both of which depend on the CDK1 activity. Importantly, repression of 5′ end resection by CDK1 inhibition at G 2 alone did not fully restore either physical association of Ku/Dnl4-Lif1 with DSBs or NHEJ proficiency to the level at G 1 . Expression of excess Ku can partially offset the inhibition of end joining at G 2 . The results suggest that regulation of Ku/Dnl4-Lif1 affinity for DNA ends may contribute to the cell cycle-dependent modulation of NHEJ efficiency.

1. Introduction

Mutations, especially gross chromosome rearrangements, are frequent in cells from cancer patients, and often the consequence of failed and/or improper repair of DNA lesions (reviewed in [ 1 ]). Among DNA lesions, double-strand breaks (DSBs) pose the most serious challenge as the un-repaired DSB is highly mutagenic and frequently lethal. Two highly efficient repair pathways have evolved to deal with this type of lesion: homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) [ 2 , 3 ]. Homologous recombination (HR) uses an undamaged template, often found in the sister chromatid or homologous chromosome to restore chromosome integrity [ 3 ]. NHEJ, in contrast, restores chromosome integrity by simple ligation of the broken chromosome ends back together following appropriate end processing [ 4 , 5 ]. Because end processing, catalyzed by a collection of polymerases and nucleases, inevitably alters terminal sequences, NHEJ is often considered more mutagenic than HR [ 4 , 6 ]. However, HR between ectopic templates can in principle lead to chromosome rearrangement type mutations [ 7 ]. The prudent choice of repair pathway will thus greatly reduce the mutation rate and improve the overall cellular fitness [ 3 ]. The fact that specific types of DSB repair such as V(D)J recombination, class switch recombination (CSR) and meiotic recombination exclusively rely on one of these two repair pathways also lends additional support to cellular regulation of repair pathway choice [ 8 - 10 ]. How a cell imposes the use of a specific repair pathways has begun to emerge with a finding of a role of the post-cleavage Rag1/Rag2 complex during V(D)J recombination [ 9 ] and end processing in yeast [ 11 , 12 ].

The cell cycle has long been recognized as a crucial factor for determining repair pathway choice [ 3 ]. Early studies in vertebrates showed that NHEJ-deficient scid cells and ku70 -/- chicken DT40 cells were hypersensitive to ionizing radiation only during G 1 and early S phase of the cell cycle, whereas HR-defective rad54 -/- cells were radiation sensitive at late S/G 2 [ 13 , 14 ]. In the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe , recombination is also tightly linked to cell cycle such that recombination between sister chromatids predominates at S/G 2 [ 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 ]. When sister chromatids are unavailable in G 1 , recombination is minimized to prevent the loss of heterozygosity or chromosome rearrangements [ 17 ]. Recombination in yeast is suppressed at G 1 because end resection, the key early step that produces the 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) essential for strand invasion [ 18 ], depends on the Cdk1 kinase activity [ 11 , 12 , 16 ]. Recently, phosphorylation of Sae2 or its mammalian counterpart CtIP, at its carboxyl terminus by Cdk1 has been implicated in cell cycle dependent regulation of DSB processing and hence repair choice during the cell cycle [ 19 , 20 ]. The strand invasion step during gene conversion, where Rad51-coated presynaptic filaments search and anneal to the homologous template, is also controlled by the cell cycle [ 11 ]. Finally, cell cycle controls repair pathway choice by modulating expression of recombination proteins. In mammals, the expression level of Rad51 and Rad52 is the lowest at G 0 /G 1 and gradually increases during S/G 2 /M [ 21 ], and in S. pombe , the resection facilitator Ctp1 protein (Sae2 in S. cerevisiae ) is not expressed at G 1 [ 22 ]. An equivalent expression pattern of Sae2 during the cell cycle is not detected in S. cerevisiae [ 23 ], however, suggesting that this type of regulation might be species specific.

While evidence has accumulated for cell cycle-dependent regulation of HR, it is not clear whether the cell cycle has a similar role in regulating NHEJ. In fact, considerable uncertainty exists as to the role of NHEJ in DSB repair during the S and G 2 phases of the cell cycle. DNA ends with extensive 5′ degradation would not likely be favorable substrates for NHEJ [ 11 , 24 , 25 ], suggesting that Cdk1-dependent resection of DNA ends might suppress NHEJ at late S/G 2 . Alternatively, efficient HR at S/G 2 may simply out-compete NHEJ and cells may channel DNA breaks preferentially to HR despite the lack of a clear decline in NHEJ efficiency at this cell cycle stage [ 26 , 27 ].

In this study, we examined the effect of cell cycle on the repair of DNA breaks by NHEJ and described a biochemical basis for NHEJ suppression at S/G 2 that operates independently of HR events. We have uncovered a role of Cdk1 in opposing the association of Ku/Dnl4-Lif1 with DNA breaks and thus in discouraging commitment to NHEJ at S/G 2 . Cdk1-dependent inhibition of NHEJ factor recruitment at DNA breaks is distinct from Cdk1’s role in recombination and end processing, and represents a novel mode of pathway choice control for DSB repair.

4. Discussion

Both NHEJ and HR are efficient in repairing DSBs, but they produce products with distinctly different mutational potentials. Proper choice of repair mechanism for a given DNA lesion will minimize cellular mutational load and is pivotal to maintain genome integrity. Previously, evidence indicated that HR efficiency fluctuates throughout cell cycle, with the key recombination step(s) being under control of the Cdk1 kinase [ 11 , 12 , 16 ]. Here, we confirmed the effect of cell cycle on HR and demonstrated an effect on NHEJ as well; NHEJ is most active at G 1 but substantially attenuated at G 2 . Repression of NHEJ at G 2 depends on Cdk1-dependent modulation of end processing and on Yku and Lif1 recruitment to DNA breaks. Importantly, elimination of HR was not sufficient to increase NHEJ at G 2 . We propose that regulating the affinity of Yku and Dnl4/Lif1 proteins to DNA breaks defines a novel way to enforce cellular repair pathway choice during the cell cycle in budding yeast.

Being the main engine for cell cycling, Cdk1 is an ideal molecule to coordinate the choice of DSB repair pathway. This insures the availability of the most desirable recombination template: an identical sister-chromatid. HR and NHEJ are oppositely affected by Cdk1 activity: Cdk1 activates HR, but represses NHEJ. Cdk1 controls cell cycle dependent repair pathway choice at multiple steps. First, Cdk1 activates nucleolytic processing of DNA ends to produce recombinogenic ssDNA, an essential intermediate for HR that is also inhibitory to NHEJ [ 11 , 12 ]. Secondly, Cdk1 is important for a later step in homologous recombination, after strand invasion and before the initiation of new DNA synthesis [ 11 ]. Thirdly, expression/post-translational modifications of Sae2/CtIP also fluctuate throughout cell cycle [ 22 ], with the protein being shown recently to be a target of Cdk1 in yeast and mammals. In this study we demonstrated that Cdk1 additionally represses NHEJ at G 2 by inhibiting the recruitment of at least two NHEJ factors, Yku and Lif1, to DNA breaks.

Since the recruitment of core NHEJ proteins is inhibited by Cdk1 activity, an open question is whether Cdk1 directly phosphorylates one or more core NHEJ proteins to modulate binding affinity to DNA breaks. Direct phosphorylation of Ku by Cdk1 is highly attractive as Ku70 was previously identified as a target of cyclin dependent kinase in mouse [ 42 ]. However, removal of all the putative Cdk1 phosphorylation sites (S/TP) on Yku70 and 3 out of 4 sites on Yku80 failed to elicit any DSB repair phenotype, suggesting that the regulatory role Cdk1 on Yku is likely indirect (Y.Z. and S.L., unpublished observations). Since Dnl4/Lif1 can positively influence the binding of Ku at DSBs, it will be interesting to test whether Dnl4/Lif1 are the relevant substrate(s) of Cdk1 [ 28 ]. Alternatively, other post-translational modification of Ku (e.g. sumoylation)[ 43 ] might be required for DNA binding and regulated by Cdk1.

In this study, we provide compelling evidence that NHEJ is actively suppressed at G 2 by direct inhibition of NHEJ factor binding to DSBs. However, it still remains possible that commitment to NHEJ is compromised at this cell cycle stage due to elevated end resection rather than to direct modulation of NHEJ factors. For instance, Sic1 might cause a gross resection rate decline by selectively repressing certain steps of end resection, but fail to inhibit step(s) germane to NHEJ suppression. As evidence emerges that resection is a multi-step process governed by functionally overlapping nucleases and the associated protein complexes, it remains formally possible that Sic1 may inhibit distinct resection step(s) but leave others intact. In this regard, we would like to emphasize that the earliest step of resection is effectively inhibited by Sic1 overexpression in the PCR-based resection assay.

Interestingly, Clerici et al. previously reported no apparent difference in the amount of MYC epitope tagged Yku proteins at an HO-induced DSB at G 1 versus G 2 by ChIP assays [ 44 ]. Although the reason for this disparity is unknown, some of the difference can be explained by the non-identical behavior between MYC -tagged Yku70 and an untagged Yku protein complex in ChIP assays. In fact, very different outcomes were reported between ChIP assays using an epitope tagged version of Yku and those using a polyclonal antibody raised against Yku to examine association of Yku with telomeres and the HM loci [ 45 ].

The cell cycle dependent fluctuation of repair pathway efficiency likely reflects evolutionary pressure to preferentially use recombination for DSB repair when sister-chromatids are available, as recombination between sister-chromatids will most faithfully restore the integrity of broken chromosomes. Indeed, DSB repair mutants in other organisms exhibit radiation sensitivity profiles highly suggestive of cell cycle influence [ 13 - 15 ]. We speculate that a similar strategy is applied to DSB repair in mammalian cells where NHEJ plays a more prominent role in repairing DNA breaks.

In summary, the results described here have uncovered a novel role of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdk1 in the suppression of NHEJ at G 2 . Importantly, this regulation minimizes genetic mutation during repair. Our results shed light on how the two major pathways of DSB repair are coordinated during the cell cycle and reveal additional details of the molecular basis of this control.
