Human ductal saliva contributes over a thousand unique proteins to whole oral 
fluids. The mechanism by which most of these proteins are secreted by salivary 
glands remains to be determined. The present study used a mass 
spectrometry-based, shotgun proteomics approach to explore the possibility that 
a subset of the proteins found in saliva are derived from exosomes, 
membrane-bound vesicles of endosomal origin within multivesicular endosomes. 
Using MudPIT (multidimensional protein identification technology) mass 
spectrometry, we catalogued 491 proteins in the exosome fraction of human 
parotid saliva. Many of these proteins were previously observed in ductal saliva 
from parotid glands (265 proteins). Furthermore, 72 of the proteins in parotid 
exosomes overlap with those previously identified as urinary exosome proteins, 
proteins which are also frequently associated with exosomes from other tissues 
and cell types. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses found that 
cytosolic proteins comprise the largest category of proteins in parotid exosomes 
(43%), involved in such processes as phosphatidylinositol signaling system, 
calcium signaling pathway, inositol metabolism, protein export, and signal 
transduction, among others; whereas the integral plasma membrane proteins and 
associated/peripheral plasma membrane proteins (26%) were associated with 
extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, epithelial cell signaling, T-cell and 
B-cell receptor signaling, cytokine receptor interaction, and antigen processing 
and presentation, among other biological functions. In addition, these putative 
saliva exosomal proteins were linked to specific diseases (e.g., 
neurodegenerative disorders, prion disease, cancers, type I and II diabetes). 
Consequently, parotid glands secrete exosomes that reflect the metabolic and 
functional status of the gland and may also carry informative protein markers 
useful in the diagnosis and treatment of systemic diseases.

Introduction

Salivary glands secrete proteins with numerous functions; e.g. digestion of starches and lipids, anti-viral and anti-bacterial activities, lubrication, and tooth mineralization 1 – 5 . These varied and numerous tasks suggest that saliva contains a large number of unique proteins. Indeed, high-throughput, proteomic analysis of saliva revealed a surprisingly diverse collection of more than a thousand different proteins 2 , 6 , 7 . A relatively few number of abundant proteins packaged primarily in large secretory granules make up more than 90% of the total protein content (about 40 major proteins, e.g. amylase, mucin, histatin, statherin, cystatin, and the acidic, basic, and glycosylated proline-rich proteins) 3 , 5 . The origins for the majority of the less abundant proteins are unknown; however, the many different classes of proteins found in saliva suggest that multiple secretion pathways are involved.

The apical portions of the cells of a salivary gland acinus, also known as the secretory endpiece, contain densely packed, large secretory granules 8 , 9 . This secretion pathway, termed the major-regulated pathway, is primarily regulated by β-adrenergic stimulation which increases the intracellular cAMP content leading to activation of protein kinase A 8 – 10 . Secretion of the abundant salivary proteins, and consequently most of the total protein found in saliva, is mediated by exocytosis of the granules in the major-regulated pathway. Although generally found in low abundance, approximately one third of the different proteins found in saliva are also common to blood serum 2 suggesting that the acinar secretory apparatus may be more “leaky” than previously appreciated 11 , 12 , and/or that salivary gland cells possess specialized receptors that facilitate transcellular movement of many proteins, as is well-known for IgA 13 , 14 . In addition to the major-regulated pathway, two other membrane-bound pathways have been described, the constitutive-like and the minor-regulated pathways. These latter two pathways secrete relatively small amounts of the total secretory protein compared to the major regulated pathway 8 , 15 . As the name implies, the constitutive-like pathway secretes continuously and does not appear to be subject to acute regulation 8 , 15 . In contrast, the minor regulated pathway is activated by either low-level cholinergic or β-adrenergic stimulation, considerably lower than that needed to stimulate the major regulated pathway. Together, the constitutive-like and the minor-regulated pathways are most responsible for the resting salivary secretion of proteins 16 associated with basal parasympathetic stimulation 17 . The major-regulated pathway on the other hand, provides most of the salivary proteins during eating 16 .

In addition to the above secretion pathways, it appears that most cell types also secrete two varieties of membrane-bound vesicles, exosomes and apoptotic blebs 18 , 19 . Exosomes were first described as exfoliated membrane vesicles released by different cell lines 20 . Morphologic analysis showed that these exosomes have a diameter of 30–100 nm with a rounded shape 19 , 21 – 24 . Exosomes are created by the inward budding of the limiting membrane of endosomes; a process that produces intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) 23 , 25 – 30 , traps cytosolic material 25 , 28 , 31 – 34 and generates multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) 19 , 23 , 26 , 31 . Exosomes accumulate within MVEs (also known as multivesicular bodies) and are constitutively released upon fusion of the MVE membrane with the plasma membrane 18 , 19 , 23 , 26 – 30 , 32 – 35 . Fusion of the MVE with the plasma membrane releases the intact membrane-bound exosomes, a distinct exocytosis mechanism. In contrast to exosomes, apoptotic blebs are heterogeneous vesicles which bud directly from the plasma membrane after apoptotic cell death 19 , 36 . These vesicles contain mainly nuclear and endoplasmic reticulum proteins that are not observed in exosomes 19 , 35 .

Exosomes are released by a variety of specialized cells including reticulocytes, B-lymphocytes, dendritic cells, T-lymphocytes, mast cells, platelets, intestinal epithelial cells, neuroglial cells, and tumor cells 18 , 19 , 21 , 22 , 24 , 27 , 37 – 40 . In addition, exosomes are present in different physiological fluids such as urine 25 , 28 , 33 , 41 , blood 31 , pleural effusions 21 and malignant ascites 42 .

Recent advances in mass spectrometry 43 have made the field of clinical proteomics increasingly important in the identification of biomarkers for early disease diagnosis and in the development of new treatments 22 , 25 , 28 , 41 , 43 . Proteomic analysis has demonstrated that certain proteins are common to all exosomes, regardless of their cell origin, although others are cell-type specific, making them potentially attractive biomarker targets 18 , 19 , 21 – 23 , 25 , 27 , 31 , 34 , 35 , 37 , 39 , 44 . Human saliva is an ideal biological fluid for this purpose because its collection is non-invasive, low-cost, safe and simple; and, it contains proteins useful for disease detection 45 – 47 . The association between salivary proteins and diseases such as periodontal disease, HIV-immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases has been demonstrated 48 – 52 . To date, exosome analysis of salivary gland cells and saliva has been restricted to non-neoplastic human salivary gland cell lines 18 and whole saliva 53 . Therefore, the aim of the present study was an initial step to identify proteins secreted as human parotid gland exosomes in vivo in order to gain insight into their biological functions related to health and disease processes.

Discussion

In the past two decades, major advances in mass spectrometric ionization techniques have made possible the identification of macromolecules and protein complexes in health and disease processes, revolutionizing the biomarker research field 43 . To achieve sensitive and accurate detection of biomarkers in biological fluids, multiple fractionation steps have been proposed to reduce sample complexity 43 , 71 – 75 . One strategy that has been utilized with success is MudPIT 55 , a shotgun proteomic approach to identify with great sensitivity and accuracy medium and low abundant proteins from complex protein mixtures by using a combination of strong cation exchange chromatography with reverse phase separations 61 . Our data showed an improved mass accuracy, resolution and sensitivity with MudPIT technology for identifying parotid exosome proteins with great coverage. Furthermore, these data provide for the first time a comprehensive analysis of the secretion of exosomes in parotid ductal saliva. Exosomes represent an important pathway by which salivary gland cells secrete proteins in saliva, both in a constitutive 18 , 19 , 35 and regulated manner 76 . Of the total 914 proteins identified in the parotid salivary proteome 2 , 265 (23% overlapping) were common to the parotid exosomal proteome. The presence of these proteins in exosomes likely explains the existence of cellular proteins like plasma membrane (polymeric-immunoglobulin receptor precursor, 4F2 cell-surface antigen heavy chain), and cytosolic proteins (Ras GTPase-activating-like protein IQGAP1, 14-3-3 protein zeta/delta, clathrin heavy chain 1, peroxiredoxin-2, syntenin-1 and syntenin-3, annexin-A1, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, actins, tubulins, keratins etc.) in ductal saliva. For example, the exosomal proteins found were of integral plasma membrane origin (16 proteins; 2%), from peripheral plasma membrane (27 proteins; 3%), and 118 cytoplasmic proteins (13%). Additionally, using immunoelectron microscopy and immunoblotting techniques the origin of five proteins (TSG101, Aquaporin-5, Alix, CD81 and CD63) identified by MudPIT were confirmed as proteins associated with endomembrane vesicles. Morphological analyses performed on exosomes derived either from cell lines 18 , 19 , 37 or body fluids such as urine 25 , 28 , blood 31 , malignant pleural effusions 21 and amniotic fluid 25 , as well as our electron microscopy findings reveal that mammalian exosomes have common characteristics such as structure (membranes with lipid bilayer), shape (round-shaped), size (30–100 nm), and density 19 , 31 , 35 .

Many common exosomal proteins found in other tissues were identified in parotid exosomes like heat shock proteins (HSP90 and HSP70), cytoskeletal components (actins, cofilin-1, tubulins), proteins implicated in translation (elongation factor 1α1, elongation initiation factor-4A), proteins involved in signal transduction (14-3-3, syntenin, G- proteins), proteins associated with intracellular membrane fusion and transport (annexins, small GTPases, ADP-ribosylation factor 1 and Rab family members), enzymes implicated in different metabolic processes 19 , 27 , 35 as well as membrane bound proteins that belong to the tetraspanin family (C9, CD82, CD81) 19 , 29 , 31 , 34 , 44 . In addition, we found that parotid exosomes lacked endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear resident proteins, distinguishing them from apoptotic bodies or shed membranes 19 , 22 , 31 . However, some of the identified proteins were associated with pro- apoptotic or anti-apoptotic activities such as 14-3-3, galectin-3, galectin-7, peroxiredoxin-2, and thioredoxin domain containing protein 5 precursor, suggesting their possible cell-protector role.

Cumulative evidence suggests a role of the ESCRT family in protein sorting associated with MVE generation 24 , 28 , 29 , 34 , 35 . These multimeric protein complexes direct specific protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions causing a deformity in the endosomal-limiting membrane, and thus promoting the inward budding of the ILVs 76 , 77 . In the present study, we also identified proteins implicated in the endosomal sorting complex required for transport, e.g. ESCRT-I (VPS28) and ESCRT-III (VPS4A), in addition to VTA1 (trafficking of multivesicular bodies) and Alix (necessary for the targeting of endosomes) 28 , 33 – 35 , 76 . Moreover, proteins consistent with an alternative pathway for sorting cargo in the MVEs completely independent of the ESCRT machinery 30 were also detected such as UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase-like 1 isoform 1, UDP-Gal:betaGlcNAc beta 1,4- galactosyltransferase 1 membrane-bound form, Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1. This latter mechanism depends on raft-based microdomains in which the cone-shaped lipid ceramide induces a spontaneous negative curvature on the MVE membrane by creating an area difference between the membrane leaflets and merging small microdomains into larger domains, thus promoting domain-induced budding. During this process, interaction with tetraspanins and GPI-anchored proteins is necessary for ILV formation 24 , 26 , 63 . Little is known about the exosome biogenesis pathway in epithelial cells; however the detection of proteins associated with these two mechanisms of exosome formation in parotid exosomes suggests that cell-type- and cargo-specific differences may be present in parotid gland cells 76 .

Besides the proteins implicated in the process of exosome formation, we detected proteins involved in many other biological functions including proteins exposed on the exosomal surface involved in cell-adhesion (Von Willebrand factor A domain-related protein isoform 1, MFGE8, LAMB2, LAMC1), suggesting another cell-communication mechanism for exosome targeting to effector molecules, cell fusion and exchange of antigenic information 18 , 19 . Parotid exosomes also exhibited unique molecular signatures. These proteins included: Aquaporin 5, an apical plasma membrane channel involved in water regulation during salivary secretion 59 ; different solute carrier molecules involved in transporter activities during salivation (SLC12A2, SLC9A1) 62 , 78 , 79 ; CD59 and Decay-accelerating factor splicing variant 4, co-stimulatory molecules of the immune system 80 , 81 ; cytokeratins, specific epithelial markers 18 ; cytokines (TNFSF10, TNFSF13), implicated in tumor growth regulation and in mediation of immunological process 23 ; and MUC1 and CD44, involved in cell-adhesion and cell-cell interactions 82 . These findings are in agreement with previous reports where exosomal proteins vary according to their cell origin 19 , 22 , 24 , 37 , 69 . Furthermore, MudPIT analysis revealed the presence of both exclusive and common salivary gland protein markers indicating the possible origin of parotid exosomes from ductal (SLC5A5 83 , Duox2 84 , galectin 3 85 ), acinar (AQP5 59 , TMEM16A 86 ) or both cell types (desmoglein 2 87 , DPP IV 88 ).

Given that parotid exosomes contain numerous cytokines and antigen presenting proteins, it may be worthwhile to explore their potential role in autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren’s syndrome. To date, one study conducted on human non-neoplastic salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs) by Kapsogeorgou et al 18 has demonstrated that salivary gland epithelial cell exosomes contain autoantigenic Ro/SSA, La/SSB and Sm RNPs (ribonucleoproteins), proteins associated with Sjögren’s syndrome. Exosomes are known to mediate antigen presentation either through their surface receptors (major histocompatibility complex, antigenic-peptide complexes, and co-stimulatory molecules) or by antigenic transfer to antigen presenting cells (APCs) 29 , 68 . Thus, it may prove important to define the immunological role of exosomes in Sjögren’s syndrome disease and progression.

Some extracellular component proteins were detected at low levels in the parotid exosomal preparation such as immunoglobulins (IgGs; 21 , 28 ), complement proteins, cystatin D, carbonic anhydrase 6 and alpha-amylase 28 . These extracellular secreted proteins are highly expressed in human parotid saliva, suggesting that incorporation of these proteins may have occurred during exosome formation. Alternatively, some minor contamination may have occurred during the isolation procedure of the exosomes. Taking into consideration the high sensitivity of MudPIT analysis and the high abundance of these salivary proteins, it is not that surprising to detect them. Furthermore, Bard et al 21 also found several IgGs and complement proteins in human malignant pleural effusions suggesting the presence of both cellular and humoral immunity and the possible trapping of these proteins during the ultracentrifugation step. Nevertheless, we can not discard the possibility of a cell-cell interaction taking place between the exosome plasma membrane antigen presenting-defense and mediators of immunological process molecules with the immunoglobulins per se or the possible generation of these proteins (IgGs and complement proteins) from locally stimulated B-lymphocytes 89 , consistent with the biological role of exosomes in regulation of the immune response 35 , 44 , 67 , 68 .

New proteomic methods have revealed the protein complexity of exosomal vesicles, including cell surface proteins, cytosolic proteins as well as the intracellular machinery that is responsible for exosome formation and extracellular release 24 , 28 , 30 , 33 , 34 , 69 . These previous studies have demonstrated that endomembrane vesicles are secreted in the urine, blood, plasma, amniotic fluid and malignant pleural effusions. Here we show that these vesicles are also secreted in parotid saliva. This process may be regulated by an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration 90 which stimulates exosome release in epithelial cells 76 . Numerous proteins participate during exosomal secretion such as dynein and kinesin which mediate the movement of endosomes 91 , RHO-A, different RAB proteins, GTPases and syntaxin proteins (syntaxin-binding protein 2) 40 which interact at the apical membrane site of parotid acinar cells 8 , 76 to promote exocytosis through the V0 sectors of the V-ATPase (ATP6V0A4) by forming a proteolipid pore during exocytic fusion of the MVEs with the plasma membrane 76 . Furthermore, Valadi et al 92 demonstrated that in addition to proteins, exosomes from mouse mast cell line (MC/9), human mast cell line (HMC-1) as well as bone marrow-derived mouse mast cells (BMMC) contain a variety of mRNA and microRNA molecules. These results suggest that exosomes may be involved in a novel mechanism of cell-cell interaction and communication in mammalian cells 63 , 64 . This process may be important in neurodegenerative diseases (Prion diseases, Alzheimer’s disease) and HIV-transmissible disease since the severity of these diseases is related to cell-to-cell uptake mechanism 24 , 35 , 93 . Of possible significance is the KEGG analysis finding that parotid exosome proteins were associated with different disease conditions (e.g. neurodegenerative diseases, cancers).

In summary , MudPIT technology generated an in-depth analysis of the parotid exosome proteome by achieving efficient on-line peptide separation, high mass accuracy and analytical sensitivity. Our proteomic analysis provides a first step in analyzing a large set of parotid exosome proteins that may be important in future studies. The protein composition of the parotid exosome revealed important insights into the generation and physiology of these membrane vesicles. Future studies are needed to elucidate the biological functions of exosomes in healthy and disease subjects. Variables such as gender, age and ethnicity will need to be taken into account when exploring the use of exosomal proteins as biomarkers for diagnostic and disease progression purposes.
