Several histone deacetylases (HDAC) are involved in estrogen receptor 
(ER)-mediated gene transactivation, and HDAC inhibitors have been reported to 
restore sensitivity to antihormonal therapy. The modulation of ER is the most 
promising approach to ER-expressing breast cancers. Recent studies further 
suggest a critical role of the progesterone receptor (PR) on ER signaling. 
Although HDAC inhibitors modulate ER, little is known about their effects on PR. 
We evaluated the roles of specific HDAC isoenzymes and their inhibition on both 
ER and PR signaling and their importance in response to endocrine therapy. The 
roles of individual HDAC isoenzymes on ER and PR expression and their functions 
were evaluated by depletion of select HDAC enzymes using siRNA or pharmacologic 
inhibition. Cotreatment of breast cancer cell lines with HDAC inhibitors and the 
antiestrogen, tamoxifen, resulted in synergistic antitumor activity with 
simultaneous depletion of both ER and PR. Selective inhibition of HDAC2, but not 
HDAC1 or HDAC6, was sufficient to potentiate tamoxifen-induced apoptosis in 
ER/PR-positive cells. Depletion of HDAC1 and HDAC6 was associated with 
down-regulation of ER but not PR. Only the selective depletion of HDAC2 siRNA 
down-regulated both ER and PR expression, and was sufficient to potentiate 
tamoxifen. Selective depletion of HDAC2 resulted in simultaneous depletion of ER 
and PR, and potentiated the effects of antihormonal therapy in ER-positive 
cells. A more effective pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC2 and evaluation of 
HDAC2 and PR as therapeutic targets or as predictive markers in hormonal therapy 
may be considered when combining HDAC inhibitors and hormonal therapy.
