In mammalian cells, histone deacetylase (HDAC) and Sirtuin (SIRT) are two 
families responsible for removing acetyl groups from acetylated proteins. Here, 
we describe protein deacetylation coupled with deacetylimination as a function 
of lysyl oxidase (LOX) family members. LOX-like 3 (Loxl3) associates with Stat3 
in the nucleus to deacetylate and deacetyliminate Stat3 on multiple 
acetyl-lysine sites. Surprisingly, Loxl3 N-terminal scavenger receptor 
cysteine-rich (SRCR) repeats, rather than the C-terminal oxidase catalytic 
domain, represent the major deacetylase/deacetyliminase activity. Loxl3-mediated 
deacetylation/deacetylimination disrupts Stat3 dimerization, abolishes Stat3 
transcription activity, and restricts cell proliferation. In Loxl3-/- mice, 
Stat3 is constitutively acetylated and naive CD4+ T cells are potentiated in 
Th17/Treg cell differentiation. When overexpressed, the SRCR repeats from other 
LOX family members can catalyze protein deacetylation/deacetylimination. Thus, 
our findings delineate a hitherto-unknown mechanism of protein deacetylation and 
deacetylimination catalyzed by lysyl oxidases.
