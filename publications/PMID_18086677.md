Efficient expression of innate immunity is critically dependent upon the 
capacity of the neutrophil to be activated rapidly in the face of an acute 
threat and to involute once that threat has been eliminated. Here we report a 
novel mechanism regulating neutrophil survival dynamically through the tyrosine 
phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of caspase-8. Caspase-8 is 
tyrosine-phosphorylated in freshly isolated neutrophils but spontaneously 
dephosphorylates in culture, in association with the progression of constitutive 
apoptosis. Phosphorylation of caspase-8 on Tyr-310 facilitates its interaction 
with the Src-homology domain 2 containing tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) and 
enables SHP-1 to dephosphorylate caspase-8, permitting apoptosis to proceed. The 
non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Lyn, can phosphorylate caspase-8 on Tyr-397 and 
Tyr-465, rendering it resistant to activational cleavage and inhibiting 
apoptosis. Exposure to lipopolysaccharide reduces SHP-1 activity and binding to 
caspase-8, caspase-8 activity, and rates of spontaneous apoptosis. SHP-1 
activity is reduced and Lyn increased in neutrophils from patients with sepsis, 
in association with profoundly delayed apoptosis; inhibition of Lyn can 
partially reverse this delay. Thus the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of 
caspase-8, mediated by Lyn and SHP-1, respectively, represents a novel, dynamic 
post-translational mechanism for the regulation of neutrophil apoptosis whose 
dysregulation contributes to persistent neutrophil survival in sepsis.
