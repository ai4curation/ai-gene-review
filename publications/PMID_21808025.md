Recent work suggests that timing of 17β-estradiol (E2) therapy may be critical 
for observing a beneficial neural effect. Along these lines, E2 neuroprotection, 
but not its uterotropic effect, was shown to be lost following long-term E2 
deprivation (LTED), and this effect was associated with a significant decrease 
of estrogen receptor-α (ERα) in the hippocampus but not the uterus. The purpose 
of the current study was to determine the mechanism underlying the ERα decrease 
and to determine whether aging leads to a similar loss of hippocampal ERα and E2 
sensitivity. The results of the study show that ERα in the rat hippocampal CA1 
region but not the uterus undergoes enhanced interaction with the E3 ubiquitin 
ligase C terminus of heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70)-interacting protein 
(CHIP) that leads to its ubiquitination/proteasomal degradation following LTED 
(10-wk ovariectomy). E2 treatment initiated before but not after LTED prevented 
the enhanced ERα-CHIP interaction and ERα ubiquitination/degradation and was 
fully neuroprotective against global cerebral ischemia. Administration of a 
proteasomal inhibitor or CHIP antisense oligonucleotides to knock down CHIP 
reversed the LTED-induced down-regulation of ERα. Further work showed that these 
observations extended to natural aging, because aged rats showed enhanced CHIP 
interaction; ubiquitination and degradation of both hippocampal ERα and ERβ; 
and, importantly, a correlated loss of E2 neuroprotection against global 
cerebral ischemia. In contrast, E2 administration to middle-aged rats was still 
capable of exerting neuroprotection. As a whole, the study provides support for 
a "critical period" for E2 neuroprotection of the hippocampus and provides 
important insight into the mechanism underlying the critical period.
