Aniridia is a panocular human eye malformation caused by heterozygous null 
mutations within PAX6, a paired-box transcription factor, or cytogenetic 
deletions of chromosome 11p13 that encompass PAX6. Chromosomal rearrangements 
also have been described that disrupt 11p13 but spare the PAX6 transcription 
unit in two families with aniridia. These presumably cause a loss of gene 
expression, by removing positive cis regulatory elements or juxtaposing negative 
DNA sequences. We report two submicroscopic de novo deletions of 11p13 that 
cause aniridia but are located >11 kb from the 3' end of PAX6. The clinical 
manifestations are indistinguishable from cases with chain-terminating mutations 
in the coding region. Using human x mouse retinoblastoma somatic cell hybrids, 
we show that PAX6 is transcribed only from the normal allele but not from the 
deleted chromosome 11 homolog. Our findings suggest that remote 3' regulatory 
elements are required for initiation of PAX6 expression.
