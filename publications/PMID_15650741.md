Both animals and plants use steroids as signalling molecules during growth and 
development. Animal steroids are principally recognized by members of the 
nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors. In plants, BRI1, a 
leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase localized to the plasma membrane, is a 
critical component of a receptor complex for brassinosteroids. Here, we present 
the first evidence for direct binding of active brassinosteroids to BRI1 using a 
biotin-tagged photoaffinity castasterone (BPCS), a biosynthetic precursor of 
brassinolide (the most active of the brassinosteroids). Binding studies using 
BPCS, (3)H-labelled brassinolide and recombinant BRI1 fragments show that the 
minimal binding domain for brassinosteroids consists of a 70-amino acid island 
domain (ID) located between LRR21 and LRR22 in the extracellular domain of BRI1, 
together with the carboxy-terminal flanking LRR (ID-LRR22). Our results 
demonstrate that brassinosteroids bind directly to the 94 amino acids comprising 
ID-LRR22 in the extracellular domain of BRI1, and define a new binding domain 
for steroid hormones.
