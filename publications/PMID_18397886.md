The two-pore domain K(+) channel, TRESK (TWIK-related spinal cord K(+) channel) 
is reversibly activated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, 
calcineurin. In the present study, we report that 14-3-3 proteins directly bind 
to the intracellular loop of TRESK and control the kinetics of the 
calcium-dependent regulation of the channel. Coexpression of 14-3-3eta with 
TRESK blocked, whereas the coexpression of a dominant negative form of 14-3-3eta 
accelerated the return of the K(+) current to the resting state after the 
activation mediated by calcineurin in Xenopus oocytes. The direct action of 
14-3-3 was spatially restricted to TRESK, since 14-3-3eta was also effective, 
when it was tethered to the channel by a flexible polyglutamine-containing 
chain. The effect of both the coexpressed and chained 14-3-3 was alleviated by 
the microinjection of Ser(P)-Raf259 phosphopeptide that competes with TRESK for 
binding to 14-3-3. The gamma and eta isoforms of 14-3-3 controlled TRESK 
regulation, whereas the beta, zeta, epsilon, sigma, and tau isoforms failed to 
influence the mechanism significantly. Phosphorylation of serine 264 in mouse 
TRESK was required for the binding of 14-3-3eta. Because 14-3-3 proteins are 
ubiquitous, they are expected to control the duration of calcineurin-mediated 
TRESK activation in all the cell types that express the channel, depending on 
the phosphorylation state of serine 264. This kind of direct control of channel 
regulation by 14-3-3 is unique within the two-pore domain K(+) channel family.
