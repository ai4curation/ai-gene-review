Regulation of chromatin structure is critical for brain development and 
function. However, the involvement of chromatin dynamics in neurodegeneration is 
less well understood. Here we find, launching from Drosophila models of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, that TDP-43 impairs 
the induction of multiple key stress genes required to protect from disease by 
reducing the recruitment of the chromatin remodeler Chd1 to chromatin. Chd1 
depletion robustly enhances TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration and promotes the 
formation of stress granules. Conversely, upregulation of Chd1 restores 
nucleosomal dynamics, promotes normal induction of protective stress genes, and 
rescues stress sensitivity of TDP-43-expressing animals. TDP-43-mediated 
impairments are conserved in mammalian cells, and, importantly, the human 
ortholog CHD2 physically interacts with TDP-43 and is strikingly reduced in 
level in temporal cortex of human patient tissue. These findings indicate that 
TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration causes impaired chromatin dynamics that 
prevents appropriate expression of protective genes through compromised function 
of the chromatin remodeler Chd1/CHD2. Enhancing chromatin dynamics may be a 
treatment approach to amyotrophic lateral scleorosis (ALS)/frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD).
