To better understand the mechanisms governing cellular traffic, storage of 
various metabolites, and their ultimate degradation, Arabidopsis thaliana 
vacuole proteomes were established. To this aim, a procedure was developed to 
prepare highly purified vacuoles from protoplasts isolated from Arabidopsis cell 
cultures using Ficoll density gradients. Based on the specific activity of the 
vacuolar marker alpha-mannosidase, the enrichment factor of the vacuoles was 
estimated at approximately 42-fold with an average yield of 2.1%. Absence of 
significant contamination by other cellular compartments was validated by 
Western blot using antibodies raised against specific markers of chloroplasts, 
mitochondria, plasma membrane, and endoplasmic reticulum. Based on these 
results, vacuole preparations showed the necessary degree of purity for 
proteomics study. Therefore, a proteomics approach was developed to identify the 
protein components present in both the membrane and soluble fractions of the 
Arabidopsis cell vacuoles. This approach includes the following: (i) a mild 
oxidation step leading to the transformation of cysteine residues into cysteic 
acid and methionine to methionine sulfoxide, (ii) an in-solution proteolytic 
digestion of very hydrophobic proteins, and (iii) a prefractionation of proteins 
by short migration by SDS-PAGE followed by analysis by liquid chromatography 
coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. This procedure allowed the identification 
of more than 650 proteins, two-thirds of which copurify with the membrane 
hydrophobic fraction and one-third of which copurifies with the soluble 
fraction. Among the 416 proteins identified from the membrane fraction, 195 were 
considered integral membrane proteins based on the presence of one or more 
predicted transmembrane domains, and 110 transporters and related proteins were 
identified (91 putative transporters and 19 proteins related to the V-ATPase 
pump). With regard to function, about 20% of the proteins identified were known 
previously to be associated with vacuolar activities. The proteins identified 
are involved in ion and metabolite transport (26%), stress response (9%), signal 
transduction (7%), and metabolism (6%) or have been described to be involved in 
typical vacuolar activities, such as protein and sugar hydrolysis. The 
subcellular localization of several putative vacuolar proteins was confirmed by 
transient expression of green fluorescent protein fusion constructs.

INTRODUCTION

Plant cell vacuoles are multifunctional organelles that play a key role in plant physiology. Vacuoles are considered as the main storage site in plant cells and can occupy up to 90% of the cellular volume in mature cells. Vacuoles are involved in the storage of a plethora of metabolites essential for plant function, including water, inorganic anions and cations, organic and amino acids, sugars, proteins and a diverse group of soluble and insoluble compounds including anthocyanin and anthoxanthin pigments ( 1 ). Vacuoles are also involved in the sequestration of toxic molecules including metal ions, drugs, xenobiotic molecules. They are important for maintenance of turgor pressure, digestion of cytoplasmic constituents, pH regulation and ion homeostasis. The vacuole dynamically changes its function and shape according to developmental and physiological conditions ( 2 ). In addition to the large central vacuole present in mature vegetative cells that are considered as lytic vacuoles, plant cells also contain Protein Storage Vacuoles (PSV) ( 3 ). Lytic vacuoles are analogues of the yeast vacuole or animal lysosome. PSV are particularly prominent in developing seeds ( 4 ). PSV contain vacuolar storage proteins to be used for anabolism during seedling growth. The function of the different vacuoles seems to be correlated with the presence of specific tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP) isoforms ( 5 , 6 ). Current knowledge of the cellular traffic of higher eukaryotes indicates that vacuole biogenesis is closely related to the traffic of proteins resident in these compartments ( 7 – 10 ). Resident vacuolar proteins, as well as proteins intented for degradation, are delivered to the vacuole via the secretory pathway which includes the biosynthetic, autophagic and endocytotic transport routes ( 2 , 10 – 14 ). Although some aspects have been studied in detail ( 13 , 15 ), many questions remain unanswered concerning autophagy, transport and fusion with small vacuoles. The analogy with the processes set up by yeast or higher eukaryotes seems to indicate that these mechanisms may be common to all kingdoms ( 16 ).

Most of the compounds present in vacuoles have to be transported in a passive or active manner across the tonoplast (the vacuolar membrane) for storage or degradation, but they also need to be exported in response to plant cell demands. Surprisingly, the number of transporters that have been identified on the tonoplast is quite low ( 17 ). Two proton pumps known as primary active H + transport systems are present in this membrane: the vacuolar-type H + -pumping ATP hydrolase (H + -ATPase, VHA) ( 18 , 19 ) and the H + -pumping pyrophosphatase (pyrophosphate-energised H + -PPase, AVP1) ( 17 , 20 ). They are responsible for the acidification of the vacuolar lumen, thus creating proton concentration and electrical gradients across the tonoplast. It was recently shown that H + -PPase also controls auxin transport and consequently auxin-dependent development ( 21 ). The tonoplast also contains secondary active transporters energised by the proton motive force and several other pumps ( 1 , 17 ). A Na + /H + antiporter (AtNHX1) is present in the tonoplast and mediates Na + sequestration in the vacuole. This transporter contributes to the plant salt tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing AtNHX1 ( 22 , 23 ) and was recently shown to be regulated by calmodulin ( 24 ). The free cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration must also be strictly regulated as it controls many essential cellular responses ( 25 ). The tonoplast contains Ca 2+ /H + antiporters (CAX1 and CAX2) ( 26 – 28 ), that are responsible, in conjunction with a Ca 2+ pump (P 2B -type ATPase, ACA4) ( 29 ), for the sequestration of Ca 2+ in the vacuolar sap ( 30 ). It was recently proposed that CAX1 regulates several plant processes including ion homeostasis, development and hormonal responses ( 28 ). Other metal transporters have also been identified in the tonoplast. These include: an Mg 2+ /H + exchanger (AtMHX); a cation diffusion facilitator family member MTP1 (ZAT) and the AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4 transporters. AtMHX functions as an electrogenic exchanger of protons with Mg 2+ and Zn 2+ ions ( 31 ). By sequestering excess cellular Zn in the Arabidopsis thaliana vacuole, MTP1 is involved in Zn homeostasis and detoxification ( 32 – 34 ). This transporter is probably involved in Zn tolerance in the Zn hyperaccumulator Arabidopsis halleri ( 35 ). AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4 have recently been shown to be present in the tonoplast and to participate specifically in Fe mobilization from vacuolar metal stores during seed germination ( 36 , 37 ). Some ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters are also present in the tonoplast, such as MRP2 that has been shown to be not only competent in the transport of glutathione conjugates but also glucuronate conjugates following its heterologous expression in yeast ( 38 ). AtMRP1 is also localized to the vacuolar membrane of Arabidopsis and interacts with an immunophilin-like protein (TWD1) through a calmodulin-binding domain present in the C-terminus of AtMRP1 ( 39 ).

Key steps in understanding the transport process of substrates to the vacuole and their storage depends on the identification of additional membrane proteins. Recently, proteomic analyses of the tonoplast have been published ( 40 – 42 ). Shimaoka et al. ( 40 ) identified a large number of mostly soluble proteins within their vacuolar fractions. Forty two of the 163 proteins were annotated with one or more transmembrane domains and 39 proteins were predicted to have more than two transmembrane domains, 17 of which were putative transporters. Szponarski et al .’s procedure ( 41 ) allowed characterization of 70 proteins from an Arabidopsis tonoplast-enriched fraction, including only a small number of transporters. The most complete study published so far identified 402 proteins ( 42 ). However, almost half of the proteins listed were identified by a single peptide hit which is often insufficient for certain identification. From these proteins, 29 were putative or known transporters and 17 were related to the H + -ATPase complex. Taken together, all these previously published results indicated the need to extend the knowledge of the vacuolar proteome of Arabidopsis .

In the present study, intact vacuoles were isolated from Arabidopsis suspension cells. Potential cross contaminations were examined by western blot analyses and the quality of the vacuole preparations led us to a proteomic investigation. A proteomic approach was developed in order to identify the protein components present in the membrane and the soluble fractions of the Arabidopsis cell vacuoles. This approach includes: a mild oxidation step leading to the transformation of the cysteinyl residues into cysteic acid and methionine into methionine sulfoxide, which facilitates peptide assignment; an in-solution proteolytic digestion of membrane proteins; and/or a pre-fractionation of proteins by SDS-PAGE. Peptides were identified using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The combined results of these approaches spectrometry allowed the identification of over 650 proteins. Among these, 195 were considered as integral membrane proteins based on the presence of one or more predicted transmembrane domains and 91 transporters were identified. The sub-cellular localization of several putative vacuolar proteins was confirmed by transient expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts overexpressing GFP-fusion proteins.

Identification of the major vacuolar proteins isolated from Arabidopsis suspension cells Use of an in-organic-aqueous digestion method to identify membrane proteins

We first undertook the identification of the most abundant vacuolar proteins. The most intensely stained bands of the total vacuolar proteins separated by SDS-PAGE presented in Figure 1A were trypsin digested and peptide mixtures were submitted to nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis (see also Fig. 2A ). This proteomic analysis led essentially to the identification of soluble proteins (annotations Fig 1A ). Among them, we identified: the tripeptidyl peptidase II (At4g20850, a subtilase family protein); the A and B subunits of the vacuolar type H + -ATPase (VHA-A, At1g78900; VHA-B1, At1g76030), a protein similar to the bacterial TolB protein, member of the Tol system (At1g21680)( 57 ); a putative leucine aminopeptidase (At2g24200); a putative pectin methylesterase (At1g11580); the glycosyl hydrolase family 17 (At4g16260), similar to the glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase vacuolar isoform from Hevea brasiliensis ; 3 band 7 family proteins (At5g62740, At5g51570, At1g69840), bearing strong similarities to hypersensitive-induced response protein from Zea mays; a basic endochitinase (At3g 12500) involved in the ethylene/jasmonic acid mediated signaling pathway during systemic acquired resistance; a glutathione S-transferase (At2g30870, At GSTF10) induced by dehydration ( 58 ) and a SOUL heme-binding family protein (At1g17100). Interestingly, the latter protein, which has never been described in plants, is similar to the mammalian and chicken members of the SOUL/p22HBP family. P22HBP, a cytosolic protein, has been suggested to be involved in heme utilization for hemoprotein synthesis ( 59 ).

In order to identify the major membrane proteins present in the tonoplast, vacuoles were first frozen/thawed as described in “experimental procedures”. The membrane fraction was then separated from the soluble material by ultracentrifugation and salt-washed in order to eliminate membrane-associated soluble proteins. At this step, to prevent the use of detergent to solubilize hydrophobic proteins, we used an alternative method which consists of an in-solution trypsin digestion in the presence of methanol. Membrane proteins were first denatured at a high temperature (90°C) followed by rapid cooling by the addition of cold (−20°C) MeOH to 60% (v/v) final concentration and tryptic digestion was then carried out in this solution. The resulting peptide mixture was analyzed by nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS ( Fig. 2B ) and 122 proteins were identified from a very low amount of proteins (2 × 0.15 μg). Peptides identified with a Mascot score sufficient for protein identification are listed in supplemental Table I . This procedure allowed the identification of the most hydrophobic tonoplast proteins. Thirty of the most abundant membrane proteins identified in the tonoplast are presented in Table I (the others are presented in supplemental Table I ). This indicative classification is based on a simplified exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) proposed by Ishihama et al . ( 60 ). Relative protein abundance was estimated by normalising the number of peptides per protein by the theoretical number of peptides per protein. A caveat applies to this estimation, as extremely abundant proteins may affect the efficiency of protein identification because of ionization suppression and detector saturation. Highly hydrophobic proteins may also be under-represented because they generate a limited number of peptides due to their sequence characteristics. Despite these limitations, approximate comparison of the relative abundance of tonoplastic membrane proteins is possible because of the common characteristics they share. It is noteworthy that a total of 70% of the proteins were identified by two peptide hits or more. The majority of the proteins identified are transporters and the most representative proteins, as expected, are Tonoplast Intrinsic Protein (δ-TIP), subunits of the vacuolar H + -pumping ATPase and the H + -pumping pyrophosphatase (H + -PPase AtVP1). Among the 30 most abundant proteins, there are also 3 ABC transporters (MRP 1, 4 and 10), 5 MATE efflux family proteins, a sodium/calcium exchanger family protein and a calcium-transporting ATPase (ACAc), a peptide transporter (PTR2-B), a copper transporter family protein (COPTS) and a cationic amino acid transporter (CAT2) ( Table I ).

This preliminary proteomic work not only confirmed the quality of our vacuole preparations but also revealed the identification of several proteins that had never been identified before by classical approaches ( 40 – 42 ). On the other hand, it also showed the lack of proteins, such as the thioglucosidases (At1g54010, At1g54000), that are known to be the main components of other vacuolar systems ( 42 ). Taken together, these results indicated the need to extend the knowledge of the vacuolar proteome of cultured Arabidopsis cells.

CONCLUSION

The analysis of a proteome at the level of subcellular structures represents an analytical strategy which combines traditional biochemical methods of fractionation and tools for protein identification. We have shown the strategy developed in this work to be very efficient to get a broader view of the vacuole membrane proteome. We identified several new membrane proteins such as channels and transporters that mediate the translocation of molecules and ions across tonoplast membranes. We consider that most of the proteins identified in this study are genuine constituents of the tonoplast. This is based on the identification of key tonoplastic components, the verification of vacuolar localization for selected proteins using GFP-fusion proteins and the low contamination of our preparations by other organelles. Through our vacuolar proteomic strategy, it seems clear that the tonoplast membrane is a complex structure that receives membrane and protein contributions from a variety of subcellular sources and pathways. The high degree of protein diversity of the tonoplast membrane is indicative of a highly complex organelle. Further validation of the results presented here by relevant functional studies should provide a better explanation for the biogenesis and maintenance of these unique organelles.
