Duplication of mammalian genomes requires replisomes to overcome numerous 
impediments during passage through open (eu) and condensed (hetero) chromatin. 
Typically, studies of replication stress characterize mixed populations of 
challenged and unchallenged replication forks, averaged across S phase, and 
model a single species of "stressed" replisome. Here, in cells containing potent 
obstacles to replication, we find two different lesion proximal replisomes. One 
is bound by the DONSON protein and is more frequent in early S phase, in regions 
marked by euchromatin. The other interacts with the FANCM DNA translocase, is 
more prominent in late S phase, and favors heterochromatin. The two forms can 
also be detected in unstressed cells. ChIP-seq of DNA associated with DONSON or 
FANCM confirms the bias of the former towards regions that replicate early and 
the skew of the latter towards regions that replicate late.
