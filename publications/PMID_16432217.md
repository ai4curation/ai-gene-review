Nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP-1) is an integral component in the 
establishment, maintenance, and dynamics of eukaryotic chromatin. It shuttles 
histones into the nucleus, assembles nucleosomes, and promotes chromatin 
fluidity, thereby affecting the transcription of many genes. The 3.0 A crystal 
structure of yeast NAP-1 reveals a previously uncharacterized fold with 
implications for histone binding and shuttling. A long alpha-helix is 
responsible for homodimerization via a previously uncharacterized antiparallel 
non-coiled-coil, and an alpha/beta domain is implicated in protein-protein 
interaction. A nuclear export sequence that is embedded in the dimerization 
helix is almost completely masked by an accessory domain that contains several 
target sites for casein kinase II. The four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet 
that characterizes the alpha/beta domain is found in all histone chaperones, 
despite the absence of homology in sequence, structural context, or quaternary 
structure. To our knowledge, this is the first structure of a member of the 
large NAP family of proteins and suggests a mechanism by which the shuttling of 
histones to and from the nucleus is regulated.
