Measles is a highly contagious human disease caused by measles virus (MeV) and 
remains the leading cause of death in children, particularly in developing 
countries. Wild-type MeV preferentially infects lymphocytes by using signaling 
lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM), whose expression is restricted to 
hematopoietic cells, as a receptor. MeV also infects other epithelial and 
neuronal cells that do not express SLAM and causes pneumonia and diarrhea and, 
sometimes, serious symptoms such as measles encephalitis and subacute sclerosing 
panencephalitis. The discrepancy between the tissue tropism of MeV and the 
distribution of SLAM-positive cells suggests that there are unknown receptors 
other than SLAM for MeV. Here we identified CD147/EMMPRIN (extracellular matrix 
metalloproteinase inducer), a transmembrane glycoprotein, which acts as a 
receptor for MeV on epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found the incorporation of 
cyclophilin B (CypB), a cellular ligand for CD147, in MeV virions, and showed 
that inhibition of CypB incorporation significantly attenuated SLAM-independent 
infection on epithelial cells, while it had no effect on SLAM-dependent 
infection. To date, MeV infection was considered to be triggered by binding of 
its hemagglutinin (H) protein and cellular receptors. Our present study, 
however, indicates that MeV infection also occurs via CD147 and 
virion-associated CypB, independently of MeV H. Since CD147 is expressed in a 
variety of cells, including epithelial and neuronal cells, this molecule 
possibly functions as an entry receptor for MeV in SLAM-negative cells. This is 
the first report among members of the Mononegavirales that CD147 is used as a 
virus entry receptor via incorporated CypB in the virions.

Abstract

Measles is a highly contagious human disease caused by measles virus (MeV) and remains the leading cause of death in children, particularly in developing countries. Wild-type MeV preferentially infects lymphocytes by using signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM), whose expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells, as a receptor. MeV also infects other epithelial and neuronal cells that do not express SLAM and causes pneumonia and diarrhea and, sometimes, serious symptoms such as measles encephalitis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. The discrepancy between the tissue tropism of MeV and the distribution of SLAM-positive cells suggests that there are unknown receptors other than SLAM for MeV. Here we identified CD147/EMMPRIN (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer), a transmembrane glycoprotein, which acts as a receptor for MeV on epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found the incorporation of cyclophilin B (CypB), a cellular ligand for CD147, in MeV virions, and showed that inhibition of CypB incorporation significantly attenuated SLAM-independent infection on epithelial cells, while it had no effect on SLAM-dependent infection. To date, MeV infection was considered to be triggered by binding of its hemagglutinin (H) protein and cellular receptors. Our present study, however, indicates that MeV infection also occurs via CD147 and virion-associated CypB, independently of MeV H. Since CD147 is expressed in a variety of cells, including epithelial and neuronal cells, this molecule possibly functions as an entry receptor for MeV in SLAM-negative cells. This is the first report among members of the Mononegavirales that CD147 is used as a virus entry receptor via incorporated CypB in the virions.

DISCUSSION

CypA and CypB belong to the cyclophilin family, whose members are known as CsA binding proteins and possess PPIase activity ( 18 , 24 ). They are known as the most abundant cyclophilins in cells and have been implicated in the maturation of host cellular proteins. Recently, they were also reported to play important roles in the virus life cycle ( 3 , 30 , 38 ). CypA interacts with several proteins of HIV-1, vaccinia virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and is specifically incorporated into their particles ( 2 , 7 , 36 ). On the other hand, CypB is not incorporated into HIV-1 particles, although it interacts with the HIV-1 Gag protein, as does CypA ( 3 , 19 ). In this study, we revealed that MeV-N also interacted with CypA and CypB (Fig. 2 ) and that the cyclophilin inhibitor CsA prevented CypA binding completely but CypB binding only partially, which indicated that CypA bound to MeV-N in a PPIase domain-dependent manner, while CypB bound in both a PPIase domain-dependent and -independent manner. Western blot analysis of MeV-HL particles purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation showed that both CypA and CypB were incorporated into MeV particles, unlike the case for HIV-1 (Fig. 3 ). However, MeV-HL and other recombinant MeVs incorporated CypA less efficiently than CypB. Immunofluorescence staining of MeV-infected B95a cells showed that CypA was translocated into the nucleus and that MeV-N seemed colocalized more efficiently with CypB than with CypA in the cytoplasm of syncytia (Fig. 4C and D ). In fact, the amount of CypA was much lower than that of CypB in the cytoplasmic fraction of MeV-infected B95a cells (Fig. 4B ). A recent study reported that CypA interacted with AIF and was translocated into the nucleus at the early stage of apoptosis ( 5 ). Because MeV infection induces apoptosis in infected cells ( 10 ), it might trigger CypA translocation into the nuclei of MeV-infected cells. These pieces of evidence may be among the reasons that CypA incorporation into MeV was less efficient than that of CypB. In this study, we examined cyclophilin incorporation into strains MeV-luc, MeV-EGFP, and parental MeV-HL; interestingly, we found that the incorporation rates of CypA and CypB were different (Fig. 4A ). Although the exact reason underlying this finding is still unclear, we speculate that this difference can be attributed to a difference in the growth rates of the three strains. Because of the differences in the growth rates of the three strains, the reasons for which are unknown, the time points of virus harvest were different. MeV-luc was harvested at 18 hpi, MeV-HL at 32 hpi, and MeV-EGFP at 48 hpi. As described above, CypA was translocated into the nucleus at 18 hpi in most syncytia (Fig. 4D ); however, in older syncytia, nuclear accumulation of CypA was not significant, which may be attributed to redistribution into the cytoplasm (data not shown). Because of the localization of MeV-N in the cytoplasm of the syncytia and the delay in harvesting, CypA could have bound with MeV-N in the cytoplasm of the syncytia and could have been incorporated into the virus particles.

In the case of HIV-1, virus particles which are generated in the presence of the cyclophilin inhibitor CsA lack CypA incorporation because CsA abolishes the interaction between Gag protein and CypA ( 40 ). Similar to this, CypB incorporation into MeV-luc particles was significantly prevented by CsA treatment, which indicated that CypB was specifically incorporated into MeV particles by binding to MeV-N (Fig. 5C ). Furthermore, MeV propagated in the presence of CsA significantly lost infectivity to HEK293 cells, by 90% (Fig. 5B ), while the virus retained the same infectivity to HEK293-SLAM cells (Fig. 5A ). SLAM-positive cells have a much higher susceptibility to MeV than do SLAM-negative cells. In fact, the ratio of the infectivity of MeV for SLAM-negative HEK293 cells to that for HEK293-SLAM cells was approximately 1 to 100. Thus, since SLAM is a strong receptor for MeV infection, the effect of CypB on SLAM-independent infection may not have appeared on HEK293-SLAM cells. In addition, recombinant CypB inhibited MeV infection by 50% on HEK293 cells (Fig. 5D ). In these SLAM-negative cells, CypB is considered to play an essential role in MeV infection.

It is known that CypA incorporated into HIV-1 particles translocates to the surfaces of virions by an unknown mechanism ( 22 ). We tried to confirm the existence of CypB on MeV virions by immunoelectron microscopy, but commercially available anti-CypB antibody failed to detect CypB on the virions. This may have been due to the quality of the antibody or to the limited amount of CypB on the virions, because the sensitivity of immunoelectron microscopy is rather low.

CD147 is a transmembrane glycoprotein ( 1 ) expressed by various cell types, including epithelial, endothelial, and neuronal cells. CD147 is known to act as a signaling receptor for extracellular CypA and CypB, and it regulates lymphocyte responsiveness ( 39 ). It has been reported that the interaction between CypA and CD147 enables HIV-1 to infect target cells via CD147, independently of the binding of gp120 and CD4 ( 25 ). Additionally, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is proposed to use CD147 as a receptor in the same manner as HIV-1, because its nucleocapsid binds to CypA and a CD147-blocking peptide inhibited SARS-CoV infection ( 8 ). In this study, although the neutralizing activity of the anti-CD147 antibody used in the present study was not high, showing only 50% inhibition of HIV-1 infection ( 25 ), it inhibited MeV infection by 40% on HEK293 cells (Fig. 6 ), showing that MeV also uses CD147 as a receptor, similar to HIV-1. However, unlike HIV-1 and SARS-CoV, MeV seems to use CypB instead of CypA for binding to CD147. This finding is the first among viruses belonging to the order Mononegavirales and shows a new infection mode of MeV which is independent of H protein. Furthermore, since the infection mode in this study has been reported for other viruses, it can be extended beyond families of enveloped viruses.

Although we recently reported that a heparin-like molecule is involved in morbillivirus infection in various cells ( 12 , 35 ), thus far no specific protein on the surfaces of epithelial cells has been identified as a receptor for morbilliviruses. It has been reported that CypB interacts with two types of cell surface binding sites on T lymphocytes ( 6 ). The first site is CD147, and the second site is cell surface heparan sulfate, which was recently identified as syndecan-1 ( 23 ). It has been reported that syndecan-1 physically associates with CD147 and is required for CypB-mediated signaling, and it was proposed that CypB binding to the heparan sulfate moiety of syndecan-1 would complement a low-affinity interaction with CD147 ( 23 ). Syndecan-1 is also expressed by various cell types, including epithelial cells and endothelial cells. These reports strongly support the new infection mode of MeV, in which CypB and CD147 are involved.

Since CD147 is expressed on various cells, including epithelial and neuronal cells, our finding may provide a clue to understanding the mechanisms by which MeV causes severe symptoms of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections and central nervous system complications. Other mammals, such as mice, also express CD147; however, the CD147 proteins in mice and humans exhibit very little homology. The amino acid identity between mouse and human CD147 proteins is only 65%. Therefore, CD147-mediated infection may show species specificity. Establishment of a human CD147-expressing mouse model would be beneficial to reveal this point and to reveal the contribution of the infection mode to MeV pathogenicity.
