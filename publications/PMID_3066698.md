The complete nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium thermocellum celE gene, 
coding for an endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (endoglucanase E; EGE) with 
xylan-hydrolysing activity has been determined. The structural gene consists of 
an open reading frame (ORF) of 2442 bp commencing with a GTG start codon and 
followed by a TAA stop codon. The nucleotide sequence obtained has been 
confirmed by comparing the predicted amino acid sequence with that derived by 
N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified protein. The EGE sequence 
contains a region homologous to the reiterated domain found at the C terminus of 
other endoglucanases from the same organism. BAL 31 deletions of the structural 
gene have revealed the extent to which this conserved sequence is necessary for 
endoglucanase and xylanase activity. A region of DNA, upstream from the 
structural gene has also been sequenced and a ribosome-binding site and putative 
promoter sequences have been identified. A second ORF which ends 349 bp 5' to 
the GTG start codon of the celE gene has also been identified. The encoded 
product contains a C terminus homologous to other C. thermocellum 
endoglucanases.
