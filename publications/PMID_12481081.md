The ethylene receptor family of Arabidopsis consists of five members, one of 
these being ETR1. The effect of ethylene pathway mutations upon expression of 
ETR1 was examined. For this purpose, ETR1 levels were quantified in mutant 
backgrounds containing receptor loss-of-function mutations, ethylene-insensitive 
mutations, and constitutive ethylene response mutations. Ethylene-insensitive 
mutations of ETR1 resulted in a posttranscriptional increase in levels of the 
mutant receptor. Treatment of seedlings with silver, which leads to ethylene 
insensitivity, also resulted in an increase in levels of ETR1. Loss-of-function 
mutations of ETR1 resulted in both transcriptional and posttranscriptional 
changes in levels of the receptor. Most other ethylene pathway mutations, 
including a newly isolated T-DNA insertion mutation in the gene encoding the 
ethylene receptor ERS1, had relatively minor effects upon the expression of 
ETR1. Our results indicate that mutations in ETR1 can affect expression at the 
posttranscriptional level, and suggest that these posttranscriptional changes 
may contribute to the phenotypes observed in the mutants. Our results also 
refine the model on how mutations in ethylene receptors are able to confer 
dominant ethylene insensitivity upon plants.

Abstract

The ethylene receptor family of Arabidopsis consists of five members, one of these being ETR1. The effect of ethylene pathway mutations upon expression of ETR1 was examined. For this purpose, ETR1 levels were quantified in mutant backgrounds containing receptor loss-of-function mutations, ethylene-insensitive mutations, and constitutive ethylene response mutations. Ethylene-insensitive mutations of ETR1 resulted in a posttranscriptional increase in levels of the mutant receptor. Treatment of seedlings with silver, which leads to ethylene insensitivity, also resulted in an increase in levels of ETR1. Loss-of-function mutations of ETR1 resulted in both transcriptional and posttranscriptional changes in levels of the receptor. Most other ethylene pathway mutations, including a newly isolated T-DNA insertion mutation in the gene encoding the ethylene receptor ERS1, had relatively minor effects upon the expression of ETR1. Our results indicate that mutations in ETR1 can affect expression at the posttranscriptional level, and suggest that these posttranscriptional changes may contribute to the phenotypes observed in the mutants. Our results also refine the model on how mutations in ethylene receptors are able to confer dominant ethylene insensitivity upon plants.

DISCUSSION

Expression of the ethylene receptor ETR1 was sensitive to mutations within its own coding sequence. Both gain-of-function mutations and loss-of-function mutations affected expression of ETR1 at the posttranscriptional level and, as discussed below, these posttranscriptional changes could contribute to the phenotypes observed in the mutants. Expression of ETR1 was affected to only a limited extent by mutations in other pathway components. For instance, loss-of-function mutations in other members of the ethylene receptor family had little effect upon expression of ETR1, indicating that ETR1 does not functionally compensate for the loss of these receptors by an increase in its own expression.

Expression analysis of ethylene pathway mutations refines the model shown in Figure 7 on how ethylene insensitivity is conferred by mutant forms of ETR1. Each of the four ethylene-insensitive mutations of ETR1 results in increased protein levels of the receptor, apparently through a posttranscriptional mechanism. The effect upon receptor expression can be phenocopied at the molecular level by treatment of plants with silver, which is also capable of generating ethylene insensitivity in plants. Both the ethylene-insensitive mutations ( Hall et al., 1999 ) and silver ( Rodriguez et al., 1999 ) are thought to perturb the ethylene-binding site (Fig. 7 ), and thus ethylene perception may play a role in regulating expression of the receptor. The ethylene-insensitive forms of the receptor could potentially have a slower rate of turnover than the wild-type receptors because turnover of animal hormone receptors is commonly regulated by ligand binding ( Wiley, 1992 ). In such a case, endogenous ethylene levels within the plant would have to be sufficient to result in differing rates of turnover for the wild-type and mutant receptors.

The discovery that ethylene-insensitive mutants of ETR1 have a higher expression level than wild-type receptors helps resolve an apparent paradox in our understanding of signaling by ethylene receptors ( Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ; Bleecker, 1999 ; Chang and Stadler, 2001 ). An ethylene-insensitive mutation in one member of the five-member ethylene receptor family is sufficient to confer ethylene insensitivity, suggesting that signaling by one family member is enough to repress ethylene responses. On the other hand, loss-of-function mutations in three receptors simultaneously are sufficient to induce ethylene responses ( Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ), a situation under which two family members would still theoretically be signaling to repress ethylene responses. Our data indicate that the signal output by an ethylene-insensitive receptor mutant is not equivalent to that of a wild-type receptor because of the difference in expression levels. The increase in expression of the ethylene-insensitive mutants of ETR1 would result in an increase in signal output and the ability to repress ethylene responses. Other mechanisms may also increase signal output of the ethylene-insensitive mutant receptors, such as their postulated ability to convert wild-type receptors to an ethylene-insensitive signaling state via heteromeric interactions ( Chang and Stadler, 2001 ; Gamble et al., 2002 ).

Analysis of ETR1 expression in the ran1-3 background further clarifies the mechanism by which mutations in ethylene receptors confer ethylene insensitivity. The ran1-3 mutant eliminates a copper transporter required for delivery of the copper cofactor to the ethylene receptors ( Hirayama et al., 1999 ; Woeste and Kieber, 2000 ). Plants containing the ran1-3 mutation display a constitutively active ethylene response ( Woeste and Kieber, 2000 ). Interestingly, mutations like etr1-1 that produce a receptor unable to bind the copper cofactor result in the opposite phenotype: ethylene insensitivity ( Rodriguez et al., 1999 ). This difference in phenotypes could be because of: (a) destabilization of the ethylene receptors in the ran1-3 background, or (b) functional differences between receptors lacking copper and the ethylene-insensitive receptor mutations. Our data support the second hypothesis. ETR1 protein was detected in the ran1-3 background at similar levels to that found in the wild-type background indicating that, although the receptor is present and lacking the copper cofactor, it does not confer ethylene insensitivity. Presumably, protein levels of the other members of the ethylene receptor family are similarly unaffected. Thus, wild-type ethylene receptors lacking the copper cofactor have a loss-of-function phenotype (i.e. the ran1-3 mutation produces the same constitutive ethylene response phenotype found in plant lines containing multiple loss-of-function mutations in the ethylene receptors). Wild-type receptors lacking the copper cofactor may adopt a signaling-inactive conformation similar to the conformation of wild-type receptors that have ethylene bound (Fig. 7 ). In contrast, the amino acid changes that result from mutations like etr1-1 (Cys-65-Tyr) result in a gain of function because they prevent not only copper binding but also lock the receptor into a signaling-active conformation such as it has in air (Fig. 7 ). The proposal that receptors in the ran1-3 background are not equivalent to receptors containing ethylene-insensitive mutations is consistent with the finding that the ethylene-insensitive etr1-3 mutant can suppress the ran1-3 constitutive ethylene phenotype ( Woeste and Kieber, 2000 ). The finding that ETR1 is still present in the ran1-3 background also raises the possibility that not all mutations that eliminate ethylene binding will, as a consequence, confer ethylene insensitivity.

The loss-of-function mutants etr1-5 , etr1-6 , etr1-7 , and etr1-8 were isolated as intragenic suppressors of the ethylene insensitivity conferred by either etr1-1 or etr1-2 , and are predicted to result in premature termination of the encoded protein ( Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ). However, we have found that a truncated version of etr1-1 containing the first 349 amino acids is still capable of conferring ethylene insensitivity when transformed into Arabidopsis ( Gamble et al., 2002 ). This raises the question as to why no ethylene insensitivity is observed with the loss-of-function mutants, in particular with etr1-5 and etr1-8 , which are predicted to code for receptors containing 562 amino acids. Our data indicate that the loss-of-function mutants may reduce expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Transcript, but no protein, was detected for each of the ETR1 loss-of-function mutants. Examination of etr1-5 and etr1-8 indicated a reduction to 43% and 23%, respectively, of wild-type mRNA levels. This reduction in expression could be because of mechanisms for mRNA surveillance such as nonsense-mediated decay whereby mRNAs containing premature stop codons are targeted for degradation ( van Hoof and Green, 1996 ). However, the reduction in mRNA expression levels of etr1-5 and etr1-8 is probably not sufficient to reduce protein levels below detection limits for the antibodies. Thus, the results obtained with the loss-of-function mutations suggest that premature termination of the protein may lead to an absence of receptor rather than a truncated receptor, presumably because of instability of the truncated protein. The genetic screen for intragenic suppressors may have favored the isolation of destabilizing mutations.

To facilitate our analysis of ethylene pathway mutations, we isolated a T-DNA insertion mutation in the ERS1 gene that, based on northern-blot analysis, substantially reduces expression of ERS1 . As has been found in the analysis of loss-of-function genes in other ethylene receptors, the ers1-2 mutant by itself had little effect upon ethylene responses in the mutant seedlings. However, a double mutant of ers1-2 and etr1-7 exhibited a constitutive ethylene response. The phenotype observed with the ers1-2 ; etr1-7 double mutant was comparable with that previously reported for an etr1 ; etr2 ; ein4 ; ers2 quadruple loss-of-function mutant ( Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ). These data suggest that ETR1 and ERS1 play more predominant roles in the regulation of ethylene signaling than the other three members of the ethylene receptor family. The relative importance of ETR1 and ERS1 could be because of the presence of His kinase activity ( Gamble et al., 1998 ), the ability to interact with the downstream signaling component CTR1 ( Clark et al., 1998 ), or possibly higher expression levels compared with those of the other ethylene receptors.

In summary, the results described here clarify the mode of action of ethylene pathway mutations previously identified in Arabidopsis. Mutations in the ethylene receptor ETR1 affected expression of the receptor at the posttranscriptional level. Similar mutations conferring ethylene insensitivity and intragenic suppressor mutations that result in premature stop codons have been identified in other members of the ethylene receptor family of Arabidopsis ( Hua et al., 1995 , 1998 ; Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ; Sakai et al., 1998 ). Thus, the mechanisms described here may be applicable to other ethylene receptors besides ETR1.
