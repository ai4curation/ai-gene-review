RGS proteins negatively regulate heterotrimeric G proteins at the plasma 
membrane. RGS2-GFP localizes to the nucleus, plasma membrane, and cytoplasm of 
HEK293 cells. Expression of activated G(q) increased RGS2 association with the 
plasma membrane and decreased accumulation in the nucleus, suggesting that 
signal-induced redistribution may regulate RGS2 function. Thus, we identified 
and characterized a conserved N-terminal domain in RGS2 that is necessary and 
sufficient for plasma membrane localization. Mutational and biophysical analyses 
indicated that this domain is an amphipathic alpha-helix that binds vesicles 
containing acidic phospholipids. However, the plasma membrane targeting function 
of the amphipathic helical domain did not appear to be essential for RGS2 to 
attenuate signaling by activated G(q). Nevertheless, truncation mutants 
indicated that the N terminus is essential, potentially serving as a scaffold 
that binds receptors, signaling proteins, or nuclear components. Indeed, the 
RGS2 N terminus directs nuclear accumulation of GFP. Although RGS2 possesses a 
nuclear targeting motif, it lacks a nuclear import signal and enters the nucleus 
by passive diffusion. Nuclear accumulation of RGS2 does not limit its ability to 
attenuate G(q) signaling, because excluding RGS2 from the nucleus was without 
effect. RGS2 may nonetheless regulate signaling or other processes in the 
nucleus.
