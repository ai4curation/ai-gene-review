Phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase-IIIbeta (PI4KIIIbeta) is activated at the Golgi 
compartment by PKD-mediated phosphorylation. Subsequent mechanisms responsible 
for continuous PtdIns(4)P production at Golgi membranes and potential 
interaction partners of activated PI4KIIIbeta are unknown. Here we identify 
phosphoserine/-threonine binding 14-3-3 proteins as novel regulators of 
PI4KIIIbeta activity downstream of this phosphorylation. The PI4KIIIbeta-14-3-3 
interaction, evident from GST pulldowns, co-immunoprecipitations and bimolecular 
fluorescence complementation, was augmented by phosphatase inhibition with 
okadaic acid. Binding of 14-3-3 proteins to PI4KIIIbeta involved the PKD 
phosphorylation site Ser294, evident from reduced 14-3-3 binding to a S294A 
PI4KIIIbeta mutant. Expression of dominant negative 14-3-3 proteins resulted in 
decreased PI4KIIIbeta Ser294 phosphorylation, whereas wildtype 14-3-3 proteins 
increased phospho-PI4KIIIbeta levels. This was because of protection of 
PI4KIIIbeta Ser294 phosphorylation from phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation. 
The functional significance of the PI4KIIIbeta-14-3-3 interaction was evident 
from a reduction of PI4KIIIbeta activity upon dominant negative 14-3-3 protein 
expression. We propose that 14-3-3 proteins function as positive regulators of 
PI4KIIIbeta activity by protecting the lipid kinase from active site 
dephosphorylation, thereby ensuring a continuous supply of PtdIns(4)P at the 
Golgi compartment.
