F-box proteins (FBPs) confer substrate specificity to the SCF-type 
(Skp1/Cul1/FBP) of ubiquitin ligase complexes through their F-box. Multiple FBPs 
have been predicted, but experimental evidence is lagging. We report on the 
predicted human FBP hFBX25 which we found to be disrupted in a mentally retarded 
translocation carrier suffering from epileptic seizures. We investigated 
hFBX25's genomic organization and established hFBX25 as an FBP by verifying its 
interaction with Skp1 and Cul1. In the process, we identified an atypical serine 
residue in the F-box which is crucial for the hFBX25-Skp1 binding. We determined 
hFBX25's subcellular localization. We found strong transcription in human brain. 
In mouse embryonic sections, mFbx25 shows predominantly neuronal expression and 
in adult mouse brain, expression is confined to the hippocampus, the cerebral 
cortex and the Purkinje cell layer. Interestingly, aberrations in the ubiquitin 
pathway have been linked to neurological conditions.
