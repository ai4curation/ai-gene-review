NDRG1 is a member of the new N-myc downregulated gene (NDRG) family which 
belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily, but without presenting a 
hydrolytic catalytic site. Diverse physiological and pathological conditions 
(hypoxia, cellular differentiation, heavy metal, N-myc, neoplasia) modulate 
NDRG1 transcription, mRNA stability, and translation. In this report we present 
the immunohistochemical localization of NDRG1 in a large set of normal human 
tissues at light and electron microscopic levels. The immunoreactivity of NDRG1 
is mostly found in epithelial cells with different aspects. We observed NDRG1 
primarily in the cytoplasm, but it is also associated with the cellular membrane 
and adherens junctions. Given the strong upregulation of NDRG1 under hypoxia and 
its nuclear localization, we propose a role for NDRG1 in protection from 
ischemic cell damage. The multiple localizations of this protein also suggest 
pleiotropic functions amongst which a functional involvement in the 
E-cadherin/catenin complex.
