Telomerase adds telomeric repeats at chromosome ends to compensate for the 
telomere loss that is caused by incomplete genome end replication1. In humans, 
telomerase is upregulated during embryogenesis and in cancers, and mutations 
that compromise the function of telomerase result in disease2. A previous 
structure of human telomerase at a resolution of 8 Å revealed a 
vertebrate-specific composition and architecture3, comprising a catalytic core 
that is flexibly tethered to an H and ACA (hereafter, H/ACA) box 
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) lobe by telomerase RNA. High-resolution structural 
information is necessary to develop treatments that can effectively modulate 
telomerase activity as a therapeutic approach against cancers and disease. Here 
we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of human telomerase 
holoenzyme bound to telomeric DNA at sub-4 Å resolution, which reveals crucial 
DNA- and RNA-binding interfaces in the active site of telomerase as well as the 
locations of mutations that alter telomerase activity. We identified a histone 
H2A-H2B dimer within the holoenzyme that was bound to an essential telomerase 
RNA motif, which suggests a role for histones in the folding and function of 
telomerase RNA. Furthermore, this structure of a eukaryotic H/ACA RNP reveals 
the molecular recognition of conserved RNA and protein motifs, as well as 
interactions that are crucial for understanding the molecular pathology of many 
mutations that cause disease. Our findings provide the structural details of the 
assembly and active site of human telomerase, which paves the way for the 
development of therapeutic agents that target this enzyme.
