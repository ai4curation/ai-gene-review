Notch is a transmembrane receptor that determines cell fates and pattern 
formation in all animal species. After ligand binding, proteolytic cleavage 
steps occur and the intracellular part of Notch translocates to the nucleus, 
where it targets the DNA-binding protein RBP-Jkappa/CBF1. In the absence of 
Notch, RBP-Jkappa represses Notch target genes through the recruitment of a 
corepressor complex. We and others have identified SHARP as a component of this 
complex. Here, we functionally demonstrate that the SHARP repression domain is 
necessary and sufficient to repress transcription and that the absence of this 
domain causes a dominant negative Notch-like phenotype. We identify the CtIP and 
CtBP corepressors as novel components of the human RBP-Jkappa/SHARP-corepressor 
complex and show that CtIP binds directly to the SHARP repression domain. 
Functionally, CtIP and CtBP augment SHARP-mediated repression. Transcriptional 
repression of the Notch target gene Hey1 is abolished in CtBP-deficient cells or 
after the functional knockout of CtBP. Furthermore, the endogenous Hey1 promoter 
is derepressed in CtBP-deficient cells. We propose that a corepressor complex 
containing CtIP/CtBP facilitates RBP-Jkappa/SHARP-mediated repression of Notch 
target genes.
