Increased expression of the gene encoding the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase 
(G6Pase) contributes to the increased production of glucose by the liver that 
occurs in individuals with diabetes. Puigserver et al. show that the 
transcription factor FOXO1 and the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1alpha act 
synergistically to stimulate the expression of genes in the gluconeogenesis 
pathway and propose that PGC-1alpha acts, in part, directly through FOXO1. Here 
we show that FOXO1 is neither required nor sufficient for the stimulation of 
G6Pase-luciferase fusion gene expression by PGC-1alpha. Our results indicate 
that the transcriptional interaction between FOXO1 and PGC-1alpha is indirect.
