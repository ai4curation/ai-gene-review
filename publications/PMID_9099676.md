Syk (p72(syk)) is a 72-kDa cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase that serves as an 
essential component of the signal transduction machinery coupled to the B-cell 
antigen receptor. Syk is recruited to the receptor when it is cross-linked and, 
in response, becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated before it dissociates 
from the receptor and appears in the cytoplasm. To begin to explore how tyrosine 
phosphorylation affects Syk activation and receptor binding, Tyr-130, which is 
localized within the Syk inter-Src homology 2 domain region, was substituted 
with Phe or Glu. Substitution of Tyr-130 with Phe enhanced the binding of Syk to 
the receptor and increased receptor-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation, 
while substitution with Glu greatly reduced this interaction. Replacement of 
Tyr-130 with Glu also increased the basal activity of the kinase, while 
replacement with Phe decreased its activity and uncoupled kinase activation from 
receptor engagement. These data suggest that the phosphorylation of Tyr-130 
normally plays an important role in mediating both the activation of Syk and its 
release from the antigen receptor.
