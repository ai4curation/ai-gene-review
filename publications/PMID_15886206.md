Gamma-secretase facilitates the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of select 
type I membrane proteins that play diverse physiological roles in multiple cell 
types and tissue. In this study, we used biochemical approaches to examine the 
distribution of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and several additional 
gamma-secretase substrates in membrane microdomains. We report that APP 
C-terminal fragments (CTFs) and gamma-secretase reside in Lubrol WX 
detergent-insoluble membranes (DIM) of cultured cells and adult mouse brain. APP 
CTFs that accumulate in cells lacking gamma-secretase activity preferentially 
associate with DIM. Cholesterol depletion and magnetic immunoisolation studies 
indicate recruitment of APP CTFs into cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich lipid 
rafts, and co-residence of APP CTFs, PS1, and syntaxin 6 in DIM patches derived 
from the trans-Golgi network. Photoaffinity cross-linking studies provided 
evidence for the preponderance of active gamma-secretase in lipid rafts of 
cultured cells and adult brain. Remarkably, unlike the case of APP, CTFs derived 
from Notch1, Jagged2, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), and N-cadherin remain 
largely detergent-soluble, indicative of their spatial segregation in non-raft 
domains. In embryonic brain, the majority of PS1 and nicastrin is present in 
Lubrol WX-soluble membranes, wherein the CTFs derived from APP, Notch1, DCC, and 
N-cadherin also reside. We suggest that gamma-secretase residence in non-raft 
membranes facilitates proteolysis of diverse substrates during embryonic 
development but that the translocation of gamma-secretase to lipid rafts in 
adults ensures processing of certain substrates, including APP CTFs, while 
limiting processing of other potential substrates.
