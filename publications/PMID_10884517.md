Experimental evidence suggests that dopamine D(1) and D(3) receptors may 
interact in an opposing or synergistic fashion. To investigate interactions 
between both receptors in behaviour, we have used dopamine D(1) and D(3) 
receptor knockout mice to generate mice lacking both receptors. 
D(1)(-/-)D(3)(-/-) mice were viable, fertile and showed no gross morphological 
abnormalities. In an open field, they exhibited lower activity than wild-type, 
D(1)(-/-) and D(3)(-/-) mice. D(1)(-/-)D(3)(-/-) mice performed equally poorly 
in the rotarod and Morris water maze tasks as their D(1)(-/-) littermates. Basal 
locomotor activity and anxiety-like behaviour were normal in D(1)(-/-)D(3)(-/-) 
mice. Combined deletion of both receptors abolished the exploratory 
hyperactivity and anxiolytic-like behaviour of dopamine D(3) receptor mutant 
phenotype and further attenuated the low exploratory phenotype of D(1)(-/-) 
mice. These results imply an interaction of both receptors in the expression of 
exploratory behaviour in a novel environment, and the need for the presence of 
intact dopamine D(1) receptor for the expression of certain behaviours 
manifested in dopamine D(3) receptor mutant phenotype. In addition, dopamine 
D(1) receptor, but not dopamine D(3) receptor, is involved in the ability to 
perform on the rotarod and spatial learning.
