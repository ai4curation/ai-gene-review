A transcription factor DREB2A functions as a key regulator not only in drought 
stress responses but also in heat stress (HS) responses, and activates 
expression of many abiotic stress-responsive-genes involved in drought and HS 
tolerance. HsfA3 is one of the most up-regulated heat-inducible genes in 
transgenic plants overexpressing DREB2A. In this study, the analyses of HsfA3 
expression profile and the transactivation analysis of HsfA3 showed that the 
expression of HsfA3 was directly regulated by DREB2A under HS. Microarray 
analysis using transgenic plants overexpressing HsfA3 also showed that 
overexpression of HsfA3 induces many heat-inducible genes. Furthermore, we 
showed that thermotolerance of the HsfA3 overexpressors was increased, and that 
of the hsfA3 T-DNA tagged mutants was decreased. These results indicate that 
HsfA3 regulates expression of many heat-inducible genes in the transcriptional 
cascade downstream of the DREB2A stress-regulatory system and functions in 
acquisition of thermotolerance under the control of the DREB2A cascade.
