NEMO/IKKgamma is the essential regulatory subunit of the IkB Kinase (IKK) 
complex, required for the activation of Nuclear Factor kB (NF-kB) in many 
physiological processes such as inflammation, immunity, apoptosis, or 
development. NEMO works at a converging point of the NF-kB pathway as it 
interacts with upstream signaling molecules to orchestrate its activation. Here 
we report on the identification of a novel NEMO-interacting protein, NESCA, an 
adapter molecule previously shown to be involved in the NGF-pathway via the TrkA 
receptor. We demonstrated that NESCA and NEMO interact by their N-terminal 
region. Beside to NEMO, we revealed that NESCA directly associates to the E3 
ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, which in turn catalyzes NESCA polyubiquitination. 
Finally, we demonstrated that NESCA overexpression strongly inhibits 
TRAF6-mediated polyubiquitination of NEMO. In summary, our results highlight 
that NESCA represents a novel missing link in the NEMO-mediated NF-kB activation 
pathway.
