Activated Wnt/beta-catenin signalling is a characteristic of many cancers and 
drives cell-cycle progression. Here, we report a mechanism linking 
Wnt/beta-catenin signalling to centrosome separation. We show that 
conductin/axin2, a negative regulator of beta-catenin, localizes at the 
centrosomes by binding to the centriole-associated component C-Nap1. Knockout or 
knockdown of conductin leads to premature centrosome separation--that is, 
splitting--which is abolished by knockdown of beta-catenin. Conductin promotes 
phosphorylation of the amino-terminal serine (Ser 33/37) and threonine (Thr 41) 
residues of centrosome-associated beta-catenin. Beta-catenin mutated at these 
residues causes centrosomal splitting, whereas a phospho-mimicking mutant of 
beta-catenin does not. Importantly, beta-catenin-induced splitting is not 
inhibited by blocking beta-catenin-dependent transcription. Treatment with Wnts 
and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 block beta-catenin phosphorylation 
and induce centrosomal splitting. These data indicate that Wnt/beta-catenin 
signalling and conductin regulate centrosomal cohesion by altering the 
phosphorylation status of beta-catenin at the centrosomes.

Abstract

Activated Wnt/β-catenin signalling is a characteristic of many cancers and drives cell-cycle progression. Here, we report a mechanism linking Wnt/β-catenin signalling to centrosome separation. We show that conductin/axin2, a negative regulator of β-catenin, localizes at the centrosomes by binding to the centriole-associated component C-Nap1. Knockout or knockdown of conductin leads to premature centrosome separation—that is, splitting—which is abolished by knockdown of β-catenin. Conductin promotes phosphorylation of the amino-terminal serine (Ser 33/37) and threonine (Thr 41) residues of centrosome-associated β-catenin. β-Catenin mutated at these residues causes centrosomal splitting, whereas a phospho-mimicking mutant of β-catenin does not. Importantly, β-catenin-induced splitting is not inhibited by blocking β-catenin-dependent transcription. Treatment with Wnts and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 block β-catenin phosphorylation and induce centrosomal splitting. These data indicate that Wnt/β-catenin signalling and conductin regulate centrosomal cohesion by altering the phosphorylation status of β-catenin at the centrosomes.

Introduction

The Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway controls the stability of β-catenin. In the absence of Wnts, β-catenin is sequentially phosphorylated by kinases casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) at the amino-terminal residues Ser 45 and Ser 33/37/Thr 41 respectively, in a multiprotein complex composed of the adenomatous polyposis coli protein and scaffold proteins axin1 and conductin/axin2 ( Behrens et al , 1998 ; Kikuchi, 1999 ). Phosphorylated β-catenin is ubiquitylated and degraded in the proteosomes ( Behrens, 2005 ). In the presence of Wnts or mutations in the degradation complex, β-catenin is stabilized, enters the nucleus and promotes the expression of target genes driving cell proliferation by binding to T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) transcription factors ( Behrens et al , 1996 ; Clevers, 2006 ). It has been shown that phospho-β-catenin has a role in microtubule regrowth at centrosomes ( Huang et al , 2007 ). Recently, β-catenin was also shown to function in centrosome cohesion ( Bahmanyar et al , 2008 ). The mechanistic and regulatory frameworks of these new functions, however, remain unclear.

A centrosome consists of two centrioles surrounded by a dense pericentriolar material. As cells progress from G 1 into S phase, centriole duplication begins, resulting in cells with two centrosomes that each contains two closely juxtaposed centrioles by the end of S/G 2 ( Nigg, 2004 ). The two centrosomes are held together by a linker and function as one microtubule nucleation centre. Before onset of mitosis the linker is severed, followed by centrosome separation and formation of spindle poles ( Tsou & Stearns, 2006 ). After mitosis, daughter cells inherit a single centrosome with two centrioles ready to start the duplication cycle again. The two interphase centrosomes are held together by a physical linker composed of centrosomal NIMA-related kinase 2 (Nek2)-associated protein 1 (C-Nap1) and rootletin, which forms filaments and anchors itself on binding sites provided by C-Nap1 on the proximal end of daughter centrioles ( Fry et al , 1998a , 1998b ; Bahe et al , 2005 ). Phosphorylation of rootletin and C-Nap1 by Nek2 leads to separation of centrosome pairs ( Mayor et al , 1999 ). The activity of Nek2 is modulated during the cell cycle and this is thought to ensure that events pertinent to the centrosomal cycle take place in a timely manner ( Lim et al , 2009 ). The premature separation of a centrosomal pair is referred to as splitting ( Bahe et al , 2005 ).

Conductin acts as a scaffold protein in the β-catenin degradation complex by binding to adenomatous polyposis coli, CK1, GSK3β and β-catenin with distinct binding domains ( Behrens et al , 1998 ). We have shown previously that conductin localizes at the centrosomes and the mitotic spindle, and regulates the spindle checkpoint ( Hadjihannas & Behrens, 2006 ; Hadjihannas et al , 2006 ). Here, we report that conductin localizes at centrosomes through C-Nap1, where it controls the GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin to regulate centrosome cohesion. The data indicate that pathways, such as the one controlled by Wnts, have evolved hubs at centrosomes, which might act to couple mitogenic signals to centrosome function.

Methods

Cell culture and transfections. SW480, U2OS cells and MEFs were cultured as described by Hadjihannas et al (2006) . For transfection of siRNAs, previously published sequences ( supplementary information online) were transfected with oligofectamin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Plasmids were transfected with ESCORT IV (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) or polyethylenimine ( Dehner et al , 2008 ). siRNAs and plasmids were co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

Immunofluorescence microscopy, antibodies and fluorescence intensity measurements. Stainings were performed as described by Hadjihannas et al (2006) using antibodies against γ-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), phospho-β-catenin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), β-catenin ( Nathke et al , 1994 ), Flag (Sigma) and conductin ( Lustig et al , 2002 ). For endogenous stainings, cells were pre-extracted for 40 s in a buffer (containing 80 mM PIPES (pH 6.8), 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) for 30 s before fixation. Endogenous stainings of conductin were performed by using mouse ( Lustig et al , 2002 ) or rabbit (USBiological, Swampscott, MA, USA) monoclonal antibodies on methanol-fixed cells, which were then treated for 10 min at 95°C in an antigen retrieval buffer (100 mM Tris, 5% urea). Coverslips were viewed by using an Axioplan2 and images were acquired using Metamorph (Zeiss, Jena, Thuringen, Germany). For fluorescence intensity measurements, background-subtracted fluorescence intensities for conductin staining were divided by those for γ-tubulin in the same cell. Exposure times were kept constant.

Centrosomal splitting assays. Asynchronous cell cultures on coverslips were transfected for 24–48 h and processed for immunofluorescence staining. The percentage of cells showing splitting was determined in cells containing two well-defined γ-tubulin-marked centrosomes and the distance between them was measured using a × 100 objective with oil immersion. For U2OS cells, a 2 μm threshold was used as described previously ( Bahe et al , 2005 ). For MEFs a 3 μm threshold was used owing to the bigger cell size and the fact that centrosomes in more than 85% of the cells were separated by 2–3 μm. Experiments were performed at least three times and error bars indicate the standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). The various treatments used in our experiments did not alter the cell-cycle stage of the cells, as judged by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (data not shown).

Centrosomal fractionation and western blotting. Fractionations were performed as described by Mitchison & Kirschner (1986) . Briefly, 10 × 15 cm 2 dishes of 70–90% confluent SW480 cells were incubated for 2 h with 10 μg/ml nocodazole and 5 μg/ml cytochalasin-D at 37°C. Subsequent steps were performed as detailed in the Mitchison protocol. Gradients were centrifuged (120 000 g at 8°C) by using a Beckman Optima LE-80K Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Fractions of 200 μl were removed from the top of the column starting at the 40% sucrose phase and 15 μl of each fraction were used for western blotting. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described by Hadjihannas et al (2006) .

TOP/FOP assays. Cells were transfected with TOP/FOPFlash reporters and the indicated plasmids for 24 h, followed by measurement of luciferase activity in the cell lysates ( supplementary information online).
