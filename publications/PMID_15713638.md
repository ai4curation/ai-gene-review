The mechanisms which determine the nuclear accumulation and inactivation of the 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) or ERK2 mitogen-activated protein 
(MAP) kinases are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that DUSP5, an 
inducible nuclear phosphatase, interacts specifically with ERK2 via a kinase 
interaction motif (KIM) within its amino-terminal noncatalytic domain. This 
binding determines the substrate specificity of DUSP5 in vivo, as it inactivates 
ERK2 but not Jun N-terminal protein kinase or p38 MAP kinase. Using green 
fluorescent protein fusions, we identify within this same domain of DUSP5 a 
functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) which functions independently of 
the KIM. Moreover, we demonstrate that the expression of DUSP5 causes both 
nuclear translocation and sequestration of inactive ERK2. Nuclear anchoring is 
ERK2 specific and requires both interactions between the DUSP5 KIM and the 
common docking site of ERK2 and a functional NLS within DUSP5. Finally, the 
expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of DUSP5 also tethers ERK2 within 
the nucleus. Furthermore, this nuclear ERK2 is phosphorylated by MAP kinase 
kinase in response to growth factors and also activates transcription factor 
Elk-1. We conclude that DUSP5 is an inducible nuclear ERK-specific MAP kinase 
phosphatase that functions as both an inactivator of and a nuclear anchor for 
ERK2 in mammalian cells. In addition, our data indicate that the cytoplasm may 
not be an exclusive site of MAP kinase activation.

Abstract

The mechanisms which determine the nuclear accumulation and inactivation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) or ERK2 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that DUSP5, an inducible nuclear phosphatase, interacts specifically with ERK2 via a kinase interaction motif (KIM) within its amino-terminal noncatalytic domain. This binding determines the substrate specificity of DUSP5 in vivo, as it inactivates ERK2 but not Jun N-terminal protein kinase or p38 MAP kinase. Using green fluorescent protein fusions, we identify within this same domain of DUSP5 a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) which functions independently of the KIM. Moreover, we demonstrate that the expression of DUSP5 causes both nuclear translocation and sequestration of inactive ERK2. Nuclear anchoring is ERK2 specific and requires both interactions between the DUSP5 KIM and the common docking site of ERK2 and a functional NLS within DUSP5. Finally, the expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of DUSP5 also tethers ERK2 within the nucleus. Furthermore, this nuclear ERK2 is phosphorylated by MAP kinase kinase in response to growth factors and also activates transcription factor Elk-1. We conclude that DUSP5 is an inducible nuclear ERK-specific MAP kinase phosphatase that functions as both an inactivator of and a nuclear anchor for ERK2 in mammalian cells. In addition, our data indicate that the cytoplasm may not be an exclusive site of MAP kinase activation.

DISCUSSION

The inducible nuclear MKPs comprise a subfamily of four related enzymes, MKP-1/DUSP1, MKP-2/DUSP4, PAC-1/DUSP2, and DUSP5. All are encoded by immediate-early genes, which are also inducible by various forms of cellular stress ( 5 , 25 , 43 ). Of these enzymes, MKP-1/DUSP1, MKP-2/DUSP4, and PAC-1/DUSP2 are characterized by the abilities to interact with and inactivate all three major classes of MAP kinases in mammalian cells, showing activities toward ERK1, ERK2, JNK, and p38 ( 8 , 10 , 39 ). This apparent promiscuity has led to the suggestion that their specificity in vivo is dictated mainly by access to substrate ( 43 ). In contrast, relatively little is known about DUSP5. This MKP was originally characterized as a serum- and heat shock-inducible phosphatase which could inactivate ERK2 in vitro ( 22 , 28 ). More recently, DUSP5 was found to be inducible by interleukin 2 in T cells and to be a direct transcriptional target of the p53 tumor suppressor ( 27 , 46 ). However, the substrate selectivity, mechanism of catalysis, and significance of the nuclear localization of DUSP5 remain unexplored.

Here we demonstrate that, in contrast to the other members of this MKP subfamily, DUSP5 is an ERK-specific phosphatase in vivo. DUSP5 can thus be regarded as a nuclear equivalent of the cytoplasmic ERK-specific phosphatase MKP-3/DUSP6. Like MKP-3/DUSP6, DUSP5 specifically recognizes and binds to ERK2 via a conserved KIM located within the amino-terminal noncatalytic domain of the protein. However, unlike the situation for MKP-3/DUSP6, binding to ERK2 does not increase the catalytic activity of DUSP5 in vitro. Furthermore, mutation of the conserved general acid residue in DUSP5 (D232N) demonstrates that, even in the absence of bound substrate, this residue is already in an optimal conformation for catalysis. Previous work had indicated that specific binding to MAP kinase coupled with catalytic activation was a general mechanism underlying the substrate selectivity of mammalian MKPs ( 6 , 14 , 39 ). However, possible indications of discordance between in vivo activity and catalytic activation were reported previously. For instance, MKP-5/DUSP10, which selectively inactivates stress-activated MAP kinases, does not appear to be activated on incubation with either p38 or JNK in vitro ( 42 ), and the nuclear phosphatase MKP-2/DUSP4 interacts strongly with p38 MAP kinase, but its activity is not increased on incubation with this MAP kinase ( 8 ). Our results clearly indicate that for DUSP5, the recognition and inactivation of ERK2 require only a specific protein-protein interaction with its MAP kinase substrate and that this binding occurs without any concomitant change in the conformation of catalytic residues. Why certain phosphatases, such as MKP-3/DUSP6, undergo catalytic activation, whereas others do not, is unclear, but our experiments provide a mechanistic explanation for the lack of any such requirement for DUSP5.

The molecular mechanism underlying the nuclear localization of MKPs and its physiological significance have not yet been addressed. We have demonstrated that an arginine- and lysine-rich sequence located within the amino-terminal noncatalytic domain of DUSP5 constitutes a bona fide NLS. In addition, we have shown that this NLS functions independently of the conserved KIM, which is also located in this domain of DUSP5. We recently reported the identification of a functional leucine-rich NES within the corresponding domain of the cytoplasmic ERK-specific phosphatase MKP-3/DUSP6, which mediates the CRM1-dependent nuclear export of this protein ( 24 ). Our results serve to emphasize the importance of the amino-terminal noncatalytic domain of MKPs as a regulatory region which is responsible for determining both the substrate selectivity and the subcellular localization of these key regulators of MAP kinase signaling.

The existence of nuclear anchors for MAP kinase was inferred from the observations that inhibitors of protein synthesis can both prevent the nuclear accumulation of ERK2 and accelerate the nuclear efflux of MAP kinase. Furthermore, the inhibition of targeted proteolysis by the proteasome both potentiated the nuclear retention of MAP kinase in response to nonmitogenic agonists and markedly prolonged the nuclear localization of MAP kinase after mitogenic stimulation. Taken together, these observations suggest that the de novo synthesis of short-lived proteins plays a key role in the nuclear anchoring and retention of MAP kinase ( 30 ). Subsequent work further defined these putative anchors by showing that the MAP kinase which accumulated in the nucleus was in the inactive form and that inactivation was mediated by a vanadate-sensitive (tyrosine-specific or dual-specificity) protein phosphatase. Furthermore, this enzyme(s) was newly synthesized in response to MAP kinase activation and interacted with MAP kinase via the CD site ( 47 ). Based on these properties, the inducible nuclear phosphatases MKP-1/DUSP1 and MKP-2/DUSP6 were suggested to both inactivate and anchor ERK2 in the nucleus ( 36 , 47 ). However, although MKP-1/DUSP1 and MKP-2/DUSP4 are possible candidates, both proteins also interact with and inactivate the stress-activated MAP kinases JNK and p38 ( 8 , 10 , 39 ), and it is difficult to envisage how they might fulfill a specific role with respect to ERK2. Moreover, the inactivation of the MKP-1/DUSP1 gene does not modify the time course of ERK1 or ERK2 MAP kinase activation ( 13 ).

The specificity of DUSP5 for the inactivation of ERK1 or ERK2 coupled with its nuclear localization prompted us to examine the effects of DUSP5 on the activity and localization of its substrate. To our surprise, the expression of DUSP5 resulted in both the specific inactivation and the nuclear translocation of ERK2. Furthermore, the nuclear translocation of ERK2 was dependent on both the KIM within DUSP5 and the conserved CD site of ERK2, while the nuclear import of the DUSP5-ERK2 complex required the functional NLS within DUSP5. DUSP5 therefore fulfills several of the key criteria for a specific nuclear anchor for ERK2. (i) It is synthesized in response to growth factors. (ii) It is a nuclear protein. (iii) It interacts with ERK2 via a specific docking domain. (iv) It is a vanadate-sensitive phosphatase. Our observation that the expression of DUSP5 causes the specific nuclear translocation of ERK2 while the expression of MKP-1/DUSP1 does not strongly suggests that in addition to its role in the regulated dephosphorylation and inactivation of ERK2, DUSP5 acts as an anchor to retain inactive ERK2 in the cell nucleus.

The prevailing model for the spatial-temporal regulation of ERK2 MAP kinase is based on the ability of MEK to anchor ERK2 in the cytoplasm in resting cells. On activation, this complex is thought to dissociate, with ERK2 now free to enter the nucleus, where its activity can be expressed toward nuclear substrates ( 1 ). Once the phosphorylation of nuclear targets has occurred, the nucleus is proposed to be the critical site for mitogenic signal termination through a combination of dephosphorylation of ERK2 and sequestration of ERK2 away from MEK, its cytoplasmic activator ( 1 , 35 , 47 ). Our data strongly suggest that DUSP5 may fulfill the latter function. Although this model is supported by many experimental observations, it is still unclear whether MEK activity is absolutely restricted to the cytoplasm. The fact that MEK contains an NES suggests that it must reside within the nuclear compartment at some point. Furthermore, experiments in which the NES within MEK was disrupted by mutation revealed that MEK is translocated into the nucleus either in response to growth factor stimulation or during G 2 -M progression ( 23 , 44 ).

To examine the ability of MEK to function within the nuclear compartment, we expressed an inactive mutant of DUSP5. Like wild-type DUSP5, this protein acts to retain inactive ERK2 in the nucleus. However, on stimulation by epidermal growth factor, this nuclear ERK2 is readily phosphorylated, as visualized by immunofluorescence with anti-phosphorylated ERK2 antibodies. In addition, nuclear ERK2 tethered by DUSP5 can phosphorylate and activate a nuclear target in the form of transcription factor Elk-1. Overall, our results demonstrate that activated MEK can phosphorylate and activate ERK2, even when it is located in the cell nucleus. In addition, despite the occupancy of the CD site of ERK2 by DUSP5, ERK2 can readily access a downstream substrate such as Elk-1. This latter finding is surprising, as it had been assumed that prior occupancy of the docking site by a protein such as DUSP5 would block the access of ERK2 to both MEK and substrates such as Elk-1 ( 41 ). This view was reinforced by biochemical experiments in which MEK, MKPs, and transcription factor Elk-1 were shown to compete for binding to the same region of ERK2 in vitro ( 2 ). However, one paradox has always been that an ERK2 CD site mutant ( sevenmaker mutant; D319N) exhibits a gain of function ( 4 ) and, while this mutation severely affects interactions between ERK2 and MKPs such as DUSP5, the MAP kinase itself is still activated in response to physiological stimuli and is clearly able to express its activity toward downstream substrates. Our results strongly suggest either that additional protein-protein interactions can mediate both the docking of activated MEK and the recognition of Elk-1 by ERK2 or that a dynamic exchange of both regulatory and substrate proteins bound to ERK2 facilitates multiple interactions through the CD site.

In conclusion, we have identified DUSP5 as an inducible nuclear ERK-specific MKP in mammalian cells. Furthermore, we have determined the molecular mechanisms which underlie its substrate specificity, catalytic mechanisms, and nuclear localization. In addition, we have provided compelling evidence that DUSP5 performs a dual role in inactivating ERK2 and in acting as a nuclear anchor for this kinase. Finally, the use of a catalytically inactive mutant to anchor ERK2 in the nucleus reveals that MEK function is not restricted to the cytoplasmic compartment and that the occupancy of the ERK2 CD site by DUSP5 is no barrier to an interaction with either activated MEK or transcription factor Elk-1.
