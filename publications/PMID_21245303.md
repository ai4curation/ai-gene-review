Wnt/β-catenin signaling controls numerous steps in normal animal development and 
can also cause cancer if inappropriately activated. In the absence of Wnt, 
β-catenin is targeted continuously for proteasomal degradation by the Axin 
destruction complex, whose activity is blocked upon Wnt stimulation by 
Dishevelled, which recruits Axin to the plasma membrane and assembles it into a 
signalosome. This key event during Wnt signal transduction depends on dynamic 
head-to-tail polymerization by the DIX domain of Dishevelled. Here, we use 
rescue assays in Drosophila tissues and functional assays in human cells to show 
that polymerization-blocking mutations in the DIX domain of Axin disable its 
effector function in down-regulating Armadillo/β-catenin and its response to 
Dishevelled during Wnt signaling. Intriguingly, NMR spectroscopy revealed that 
the purified DIX domains of the two proteins interact with each other directly 
through their polymerization interfaces, whereby the same residues mediate both 
homo- and heterotypic interactions. This result implies that Dishevelled has the 
potential to act as a "natural" dominant-negative, binding to the polymerization 
interface of Axin's DIX domain to interfere with its self-assembly, thereby 
blocking its effector function.
