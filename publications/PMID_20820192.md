Global DNA hypomethylation at CpG islands coupled with local hypermethylation is 
a hallmark for breast cancer, yet the mechanism underlying this change remains 
elusive. In this study, we showed that DNMT1, which encodes a methylation 
maintenance enzyme, is a transcriptional target of BRCA1. BRCA1 binds to the 
promoter of the DNMT1 gene through a potential OCT1 site and the binding is 
required for maintaining a transcriptional active configuration of the promoter 
in both mouse and human cells. We further demonstrated that impaired function of 
BRCA1 leads to global DNA hypomethylation, loss of genomic imprinting, and an 
open chromatin configuration in several types of tissues examined in a BRCA1 
mutant mouse model at premaligant stages. BRCA1 deficiency is also associated 
with significantly increased expression levels of several protooncogenes, 
including c-Fos, Ha-Ras, and c-Myc, with a higher expression in tumors, while 
premalignant mammary epithelial cells displayed an intermediate state between 
tumors and controls. In human clinical samples, reduced expression of BRCA1 
correlates with decreased levels of DNMT1, and reduced methylation of CpG 
islands. Thus, BRCA1 prevents global DNA hypomethylation through positively 
regulating DNMT1 expression, and this provides one of mechanisms for 
BRCA1-associated breast cancer formation.
