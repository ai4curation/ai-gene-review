PURPOSE: A recent study demonstrated the presence of protein-protein 
interactions among lens crystallins in a mammalian cell two-hybrid system assay 
and speculated about the significance of these interactions for protein 
solubility and lens transparency. The current study extends those findings to 
the following crystallin genes involved in some congenital cataracts: CRYAA 
(R116C), CRYAB (R120G), and CRYGC (T5P).
METHODS: A mammalian two-hybrid system was used to assay the protein-protein 
interactions. Congenital cataract crystallin genes were cloned and fused into 
the two-hybrid system vectors (target and prey proteins). Together, with the 
third vector containing a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase 
(CAT), they were cotransfected into human HeLa cells. The presence of 
protein-protein interactions and the strength of these interactions were assayed 
by CAT ELISA.
RESULTS: The pattern of changes in protein-protein interactions of those 
congenital cataract gene products with the three major crystallins, alphaA- or 
alphaB-, betaB2-, and gammaC-crystallins, differed. For the T5P 
gammaC-crystallin, most of the interactions were decreased; for the R116C 
alphaA-crystallin, the interactions with betaB2- and gammaC-crystallin decreased 
and those with alphaB-crystallin and heat-shock protein (Hsp)27 increased; and 
for the R120G alphaB-crystallin, the interactions with alphaA- and 
alphaB-crystallin decreased, but those with betaB2- and gammaC-crystallin 
increased slightly. An attempt was made to interpret the results on the basis of 
conformational change and disruption of dimeric interaction involving 
beta-strands.
CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly indicate that crystallin mutations involved in 
congenital cataracts altered protein-protein interactions, which may contribute 
to decreased protein solubility and formation of cataract.
