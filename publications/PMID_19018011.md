The identification of Smads as protein transcription factors in 1995 led to 
elucidation of the canonical transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) 
signaling pathway. In the years that have followed, nuances of the pathway have 
been realized, and the once-simple scheme of ligand to receptor to activated 
transcription factor is now understood to be highly regulated at each step and 
riddled with crosstalk from other pathways. The Smads are also recognized as 
important players outside of canonical TGF-beta-dependent signaling and are 
responsible for regulating diverse cellular processes. New evidence suggests 
that Smad7 plays an integral role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion through 
direct regulation of beta-catenin. Receptor-activated Smads regulate the 
processing of a subset of microRNAs, particularly miR-21. The number of reports 
demonstrating the interactions of Smads with proteins outside of canonical 
TGF-beta signaling is increasing, although the functional relevance of these 
interactions is not known. Investigating these interactions will likely yield 
more evidence that Smads serve important and diverse purposes beyond their 
original reported function as signal transducers in the TGF-beta pathway.
