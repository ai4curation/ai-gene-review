Type I interferons bind to cell surface receptors composed of the subunits 
IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, the intracellular domains (ICDs) of which are associated with 
the kinases TYK2 and JAK1, respectively. Ligand binding results in the 
cross-phosphorylation of TYK2 and JAK1, which then phosphorylate tyrosine 
residues in the ICDs of the receptor subunits and members of the STAT family of 
transcription factors. The phosphorylated STATs migrate to the nucleus and drive 
transcription. We analyzed receptor mutants in knockout cells to study the 
functional importance of various regions of the receptor ICDs. For IFNAR1, only 
the TYK2 binding site in the ICD was required for signaling. In contrast, 
successive truncations of the ICD of IFNAR2 proportionally decreased 
constitutive STAT binding, STAT phosphorylation, and target gene activation. 
These findings fit a model in which nonsuccessive stretches along the ICD 
interact with STATs. Tyrosine residues in the IFNAR1 ICD were not required for 
signaling, and single tyrosine mutations in the IFNAR2 ICD did not affect signal 
activation. However, simultaneous mutation of all the tyrosine residues in 
IFNAR2-ICD reduced STAT phosphorylation, STAT-mediated transcriptional 
activation, and antiviral activity but not constitutive STAT2 binding. We 
suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation on IFNAR2-ICD drives the dissociation of 
phosphorylated STATs, thus maintaining high signaling flux.
