The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood-retinal barrier 
between neural retina and choroid. The RPE has several important vision 
supporting functions, such as transport mechanisms that may also modify 
pharmacokinetics in the posterior eye segment. Expression of plasma membrane 
transporters in the RPE cells has not been quantitated. The aim of this study 
was to characterize and compare transporter protein expression in the ARPE19 
cell line and hfRPE (human fetal RPE) cells by using quantitative targeted 
absolute proteomics (QTAP). Among 41 studied transporters, 16 proteins were 
expressed in hfRPE and 13 in ARPE19 cells. MRP1, MRP5, GLUT1, 4F2hc, TAUT, CAT1, 
LAT1, and MATE1 proteins were detected in both cell lines within 4-fold 
differences. MPR7, OAT2 and RFC1 were detected in the hfRPE cells, but their 
expression levels were below the limit of quantification in ARPE19 cells. PCFT 
was detected in both studied cell lines, but the expression was over 4-fold 
higher in hfRPE cells. MCT1, MCT4, MRP4, and Na+/K+ ATPase were upregulated in 
the ARPE19 cell line showing over 4-fold differences in the quantitative 
expression values. Expression levels of 25 transporters were below the limit of 
quantification in both cell models. In conclusion, we present the first 
systematic and quantitative study on transporter protein expression in the 
plasma membranes of ARPE19 and hfRPE cells. Overall, transporter expression in 
the ARPE19 and hfRPE cells correlated well and the absolute expression levels 
were similar, but not identical. The presented quantitative expression levels 
could be a useful basis for further studies on drug permeation in the outer 
blood-retinal barrier.
