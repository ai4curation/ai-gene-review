Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM) is a severe inherited 
human neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by mutations in the genes for 
the subunits of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B), a heteropentameric 
guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates both global and mRNA-specific 
translation. Marked variability is evident in the clinical severity and time 
course of VWM in patients. Here we have studied the effects of VWM mutations on 
the function of human eIF2B. All the mutations tested cause partial loss of 
activity. Frameshift mutations in genes for eIF2Bepsilon or eIF2Bbeta lead to 
truncated polypeptides that fail to form complexes with the other subunits and 
are effectively null mutations. Certain point mutations also impair the ability 
of eIF2Bbeta or -epsilon to form eIF2B holocomplexes and also diminish the 
intrinsic nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B. A point mutation in the 
catalytic domain of eIF2Bepsilon impairs its ability to bind the substrate, 
while two mutations in eIF2Bbeta actually enhance eIF2 binding. We provide 
evidence that expression of VWM mutant eIF2B may enhance the translation of 
specific mRNAs. The variability of the clinical phenotype in VWM may reflect the 
multiple ways in which VWM mutations affect eIF2B function.

Abstract

Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM) is a severe inherited human neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by mutations in the genes for the subunits of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B), a heteropentameric guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates both global and mRNA-specific translation. Marked variability is evident in the clinical severity and time course of VWM in patients. Here we have studied the effects of VWM mutations on the function of human eIF2B. All the mutations tested cause partial loss of activity. Frameshift mutations in genes for eIF2Bɛ or eIF2Bβ lead to truncated polypeptides that fail to form complexes with the other subunits and are effectively null mutations. Certain point mutations also impair the ability of eIF2Bβ or -ɛ to form eIF2B holocomplexes and also diminish the intrinsic nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B. A point mutation in the catalytic domain of eIF2Bɛ impairs its ability to bind the substrate, while two mutations in eIF2Bβ actually enhance eIF2 binding. We provide evidence that expression of VWM mutant eIF2B may enhance the translation of specific mRNAs. The variability of the clinical phenotype in VWM may reflect the multiple ways in which VWM mutations affect eIF2B function.

DISCUSSION

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of VWM mutations in eIF2B genes on the properties of human eIF2B. This is the first key step to understanding the molecular and cellular pathology of this devastating condition. The data described here provide the first information on the effects on the human eIF2B complex of mutations that give rise to VWM in humans and reveal that all the VWM mutations tested in either the β or ɛ subunit of eIF2B result in a partial loss of function. This is probably as expected, as VWM shows a recessive pattern of inheritance, and is in agreement with the data in reference 29 on the effects of VWM mutations on yeast eIF2B. A striking feature of our data is the diverse ways in which VWM mutations affect eIF2B.

The frameshift mutants give rise to severely truncated proteins that are expressed poorly in HEK 293 cells. They cannot form eIF2B holocomplexes and thus fail to give rise to productive eIF2B complexes. These mutations essentially give rise to a complete loss of function and therefore are null, but not interfering, mutants. It is therefore not surprising that these mutations occur only in a compound heterozygous manner, since simple homozygotes would lack functional eIF2B ( 22 ) (a situation that is almost certainly lethal). Patients with these mutations therefore rely on their second (point-mutated) copy of the relevant gene.

All the missense mutations tested give rise to full-length polypeptides that can form eIF2B holocomplexes, although some show reduced abilities to do so. These are the eIF2Bɛ(T91A) mutant, which shows a modest impairment of complex formation, and the eIF2Bβ(V316D) mutant, which shows a more severe deficit in complex formation. T91 is conserved in the known mammalian eIF2Bɛ sequences but is not found in sequences from other species. V316 may be a more critical residue, as this residue is also found at the corresponding positions in eIF2Bβ sequences from other mammals and from Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Drosophila melanogaster , and Arabidopsis thaliana . This may explain the more drastic effect of a mutation at this position on eIF2B complex assembly. When coexpressed with the other four human polypeptides at high levels, both variants were able to form complexes, showing that they are not completely unable to interact with the other subunits but are merely less able to do so. Measurements of the GDP/GTP exchange activity of such complexes showed that they have lower activity than do complexes containing WT eIF2B. Our data for the eIF2Bβ(V316D) mutant agree closely with those of the authors of reference 29 , who found that the corresponding yeast mutation (V341D) also impaired complex formation and activity.

To try to explain the basis of the reduced activity of these VWM eIF2B complexes, we examined their ability to bind to eIF2, the substrate for eIF2B. Three mutations altered the binding of eIF2B to eIF2. The eIF2Bɛ(W628R) mutation markedly decreased the ability of the eIF2B complex to bind eIF2. The fact that this residue lies within the catalytic domain of eIF2Bɛ ( 9 ) may explain why it impairs substrate binding. It is important that this tryptophan residue is not one of the conserved tryptophans within the cluster of aromatic and acidic residues that constitute the eIF2β binding site at the extreme C terminus of eIF2Bɛ ( 1 ). This decrease in substrate binding may explain the reduced nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B complexes containing the eIF2Bɛ(W628R) mutant. Both the eIF2Bβ missense mutants tested here showed increased binding to eIF2. This appears surprising since their activities are also lower than for the WT complex. However, their expression increases the level of phosphorylation of eIF2α, and the increased binding may thus reflect the higher affinity of eIF2α(P) for eIF2B than that of the nonphosphorylated factor ( 30 ). This would lead to inhibition of eIF2B activity. Thus, the observed effects of these eIF2Bβ mutants on the ATF4-based reporter may reflect both the reduced activity of complexes containing them and the increased phosphorylation of eIF2α (Fig. 6 ). It is unclear why expression of mutant eIF2Bβ increases basal eIF2α phosphorylation. The accumulation of (unfolded) mutant eIF2Bβ may elicit a stress response leading to increased eIF2α phosphorylation, or the lower activity of the VWM mutant eIF2B complexes may lead to increased translation of stress genes (e.g., ATF4). It will be important to study whether eIF2α phosphorylation and stress protein expression are increased in cells from VWM. Our data provide no information to suggest that the VWM mutations affect the susceptibility of eIF2B to regulation by eIF2α phosphorylation.

Episodes of infection accompanied by fever cause deterioration of VWM patients, and it has been suggested ( 37 ) that VWM mutations might confer on the eIF2B complex a thermosensitive phenotype. However, in extensive studies that used a range of complementary approaches, we did not detect any general enhancement of the temperature sensitivity of VWM eIF2B. Like the WT complex, its activity was not affected by temperatures up to 44°C. Our data agree with those of Richardson et al. ( 29 ), who also found no evidence for thermosensitivity of yeast eIF2B complexes containing VWM mutant subunits. The link between VWM and pyrexia thus appears more complex than a simple model where eIF2B complexes containing VWM mutant subunits are thermosensitive: perhaps the already decreased eIF2B activity in brain tissue of VWM patients is further reduced due to the increased phosphorylation of eIF2α that occurs during pyrexia (reviewed in reference 32 ) or after traumatic brain injury ( 26 ). This may have marked effects either on total protein synthesis or, more likely, on the translation of specific mRNAs.

It is known from other studies that inhibition of eIF2B due to increased phosphorylation of its substrate eIF2 leads to upregulation of the translation of certain mRNAs, e.g., those for GCN4 in yeast ( 16 ) and ATF4 in mammals ( 13 ). eIF2α phosphorylation—and thus regulation of eIF2B activity—also appears to be important for the control of other transcription factors ( 15 , 17 , 33 ). As both proteins are transcriptional regulators, this effect could in principle affect the expression of multiple genes. Given that VWM mutations impair the activity of eIF2B, we asked whether expression of VWM mutant eIF2B had a similar effect. Using a reporter construct in which the ATF4 5′ UTR was cloned upstream of the coding region for an HA-tagged version of EGFP, we showed that both the eIF2Bβ point mutants do indeed enhance the expression of the reporter protein. Thus, one anticipates that the translation of mRNAs that are regulated in this way would be upregulated in VWM patients. Examples of such mRNAs are already known in mammals (e.g., ATF4), and others likely await discovery. If such mRNAs were expressed in a tissue-specific manner (e.g., in brain), this could explain why the phenotype of VWM is primarily neurological. Alternatively, it could be that overall protein synthesis in neuronal tissue is especially sensitive to perturbations in eIF2B activity.

Further progress requires cells (in particular, brain cells) that homozygously express VWM eIF2B, e.g., the generation of transgenic knock-in mice bearing VWM mutations. Work towards this goal is already under way.
