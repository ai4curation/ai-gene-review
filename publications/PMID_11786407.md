We recently cloned a novel gene, NPHS2, involved in autosomal recessive 
steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. This gene encodes a novel podocyte 
protein, podocin. Given its similarity with the stomatin family proteins, 
podocin is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with a single membrane 
domain forming a hairpin-like structure placing both N- and C-termini in the 
cytosol. Here, we show by in situ hybridization, that during development, the 
NPHS2 transcript is first expressed in mesonephric podocytes from the S-shaped 
body and, later, in the metanephric kidney, in the future podocytes at the late 
S-shaped body stage. In the mature kidney, NPHS2 is exclusively expressed in the 
podocytes of mature glomeruli. We generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies against 
fusion proteins derived from the N- and the C-terminal regions of podocin which 
detected a single band of 49-kd in transfected HEK293 cell lysates by 
immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. By immunohistology, podocin was 
detected in podocytes from the early capillary loop stage in the developing 
nephrons, and at the basal pole, along the GBM, in mature glomeruli. By electron 
microscopy, we demonstrate that podocin is facing the slit diaphragm with its 
two ends in the cytoplasm of the foot processes, in agreement with its predicted 
structure. Our results suggest that podocin could serve to anchor directly or 
indirectly components of the slit diaphragm to the cytoskeleton.

Discussion

Recently, several genes expressed by the glomerular podocytes have been identified. Among them, NPHS1 and NPHS2 , encoding nephrin and podocin respectively, were shown to play a major role in the glomerular permeability as mutations in these genes result in early onset nephrotic syndrome in human. 2,4 Nephrin is a transmembrane protein that contains an extracellular portion including eight Ig-like motifs and a type III fibronectin domain and a short intracellular domain. 2 Nephrin is specifically located in the slit diaphragm, 7-9 and is expressed as soon as podocytes differentiate in the fetal kidney. 8,9,18,19 Podocin is a new member of the stomatin protein family. Given its primary structure similarities with stomatin and MEC-2, a protein involved in mechanosensation in Caenorhabditis elegans , 20-22 podocin was predicted to be an integral membrane protein with a short membrane domain forming a hairpin-like structure and with N- and C-terminal cytosolic domains. 4

Here, we describe the expression pattern of podocin during human embryogenesis and kidney development and the subcellular localization of podocin in the podocytes, using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. For this purpose, we raised antibodies against both the N- and C-terminal regions of podocin. The specificity of these antibodies was demonstrated by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation and confirmed by the absence of staining of the kidney of a patient with a homozygous NPHS2 mutation (R138X) resulting in the absence of NPHS2 transcript. 4 Furthermore, no labeling was observed with the anti-C-terminal antibodies on kidney sections from a patient carrying a NPHS2 homozygous 855/6delAA mutation, whereas a strong labeling was observed on kidney sections of this patient with antibodies directed against the N-terminal domain of podocin. As the 855/6delAA mutation is predicted to introduce a frame-shift at amino acid 285 and to lead to the production of a truncated podocin lacking the last 98 amino acids, this suggests that the epitopes recognized by the C-terminal antibodies, P35 and P39, are localized in this 98-amino-acid sequence.

NPHS2 expression was detected in 5-week human embryos, the earliest developmental stage studied. The gene was specifically expressed in the mesonephros, and more precisely in the mesonephric future podocytes from the late S-shaped body. No other embryonic structure was found to express NPHS2 . In metanephric kidneys, the NPHS2 transcript was initially detected in the lower limb of the late S-shaped body, in the presumptive podocytes but not in future parietal epithelial cells. This expression persisted throughout glomerular differentiation and in mature glomeruli. Expression of the protein was detected somewhat later than the transcript, at a time when the inferior limb of the S-shaped body becomes indented. At this stage, as well as at the early capillary loop stage, podocin was distributed at the basal pole and along the lateral surface of immature podocytes that had not yet developed foot processes. Podocin expression increased with glomerular maturation and persisted at a high level in mature kidneys at the basal pole of podocytes. Double immunolabelings and confocal microscopy examination confirmed this localization. Podocin labeling followed the external aspect of the GBM stained for type IV collagen α3 chain. By light microscopy, podocin was tightly contiguous to α-3 integrin expressed at the site of foot process attachment to the GBM. It co-localized with synaptopodin, a prolin-rich cytoplasmic protein intimately associated with actin filaments present in the foot processes. 16 An interesting observation was the strong expression of the N-terminal domain of podocin in the patient with the NPHS2 homozygous 855/6delAA mutation. This shows that the increased synthesis of the truncated podocin is not able to compensate for its defective function and emphasizes the crucial role of the C-terminal region of podocin, which contains proline residues that might be the site of interaction with Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-encoding proteins. 23

Using immunogold labeling and electron microsopy, we showed the podocin distribution at the base of the foot processes and precisely determined its localization on either side of the slit diaphragm, the slit membrane itself being unlabeled. Interestingly, both the C- and N-terminal domains of the protein identified by specific antibodies are co-localized at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, a finding in agreement with the hairpin-like predicted structure of podocin. This structure is also reminiscent of that of other proteins such as caveolins which incorporate in specialized membrane microdomains. 24

More generally, podocin shows the same pattern of distribution during kidney development as that described for nephrin. 8,18,19,25 Indeed, it is expressed in the mesonephros, in future podocyte from the late S-shaped body. Later, the expression is restricted to the base of the cells as soon as they differentiate with the appearance of foot processes. However, the nephrin extracellular domain is localized within the slit diaphragm, 9,25 whereas podocin, as ZO-1, 26 is present on the cytoplasmic face, at the point of attachment of the slit diaphragm. This suggests that podocin, as a membrane protein anchored to the plasma membrane, could interact with the intracellular domains of the transmembrane proteins localized in the slit diaphragm such as nephrin, P-cadherin, or FAT. Given the structure and the subcellular localization of the protein, it is tempting to speculate that podocin might assemble in lipid microdomains in the podocyte membrane and recruit other proteins such as CD2AP and ZO-1. More generally, podocin might serve to connect directly or indirectly the components of the slit diaphragm to the actin cytoskeleton.

The antipodocin antibodies provided here will be useful tools for testing the potential interaction of these proteins with podocin, for identifying unknown podocin partners, and for studying the podocin expression pattern in various glomerular nephropathies.
