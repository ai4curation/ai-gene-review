IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) plays a crucial role in biological processes, 
including immune response, stress response, and tumor development by mediating 
the activation of various signaling molecules such as NF-kappaB. Extensive 
studies on the mechanisms underlying IKK activation have led to the 
identification of new activators and have facilitated an understanding of the 
cellular responses related to NF-kappaB and other target molecules. However, the 
molecular processes that modulate IKK activity are still unknown. In this study, 
we show that KEAP1 is a new IKK binding partner, which is responsible for the 
down-regulation of TNFalpha-stimulated NF-kappaB activation. The E(T/S)GE motif, 
which is found only in the IKKbeta subunit of the IKK complex, is essential for 
interaction with the C-terminal Kelch domain of KEAP1. Reduction of KEAP1 
expression by small interfering RNA enhanced NF-kappaB activity, and 
up-regulated the expression of NF-kappaB target genes. Ectopic expression of 
KEAP1 decreased the expression of IKKbeta, which was restored by an autophagy 
inhibitor. IKK phosphorylation stimulated by TNFalpha was blocked by KEAP1. Our 
data demonstrate that KEAP1 is involved in the negative regulation of NF-kappaB 
signaling through the inhibition of IKKbeta phosphorylation and the mediation of 
autophagy-dependent IKKbeta degradation.
