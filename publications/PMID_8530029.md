We have previously identified a novel rat neuronal member of the pentraxin 
family (neuronal pentraxin) that may mediate the uptake of synaptic material and 
the presynaptic snake venom toxin, taipoxin. Here we report human cDNA and 
genomic sequences of a second neuronal pentraxin. This pentraxin, which we 
propose to name neuronal pentraxin II (NPII; gene symbol NPTX2), shows 54% amino 
acid identity to rat neuronal pentraxin (NPI) with 69% identity over the 
carboxyl-terminal half of NPI and is 88% identical to a newly identified sperm 
acrosomal pentraxin p50/apexin. Northern blot analysis reveals that NPII message 
is present in brain, testis, pancreas, liver, heart, and skeletal muscle, so, 
unlike NPI, NPII is not exclusively localized to neurons. Like NPI, NPII has 
potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The human NPII gene is 11 kb in length, 
contains four introns, and is localized to chromosome 7q21.3-q22.1. These data 
demonstrate the existence of a family of pentraxin proteins that are expressed 
in the brain and other tissues and that may play important roles in the uptake 
of extracellular material.
