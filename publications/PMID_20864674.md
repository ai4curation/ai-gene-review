Mammalian SCO1 and SCO2 are evolutionarily-related copper-binding proteins that 
are required for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a mitochondrial 
respiratory chain complex, but the exact roles that they play in the assembly 
process are unclear. Mutations in both SCO1 and SCO2 are associated with 
distinct clinical phenotypes as well as tissue-specific COX deficiency, but the 
reason for such tissue specificity is unknown. We show in this study that 
although both genes are expressed ubiquitously in all mouse and human tissues 
examined, surprisingly, SCO1 localizes predominantly to blood vessels, whereas 
SCO2 is barely detectable in this tissue. To our knowledge, SCO1 is the first 
known example of a mitochondrial protein that is strongly expressed in the 
vasculature. We also show that the expression of SCO1, but not of SCO2, is very 
high in liver (the tissue most affected in SCO1-mutant patients), whereas the 
reverse holds true in muscle (the tissue most affected in SCO2-mutant patients). 
Our findings may help explain the differences in clinical presentations due to 
mutations in SCO1 and SCO2 and provide clues regarding the partially 
nonoverlapping functions of these two proteins.
