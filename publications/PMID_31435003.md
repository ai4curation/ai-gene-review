Type II innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) play a very important role in the 
pathogenesis of allergic asthma. This study aims to investigate whether miR-146a 
inhibition of asthma is related with interleukin (IL)-33 signaling path way in 
ILC2 and the underlying mechanisms. Asthma mice model was induced by ovalbumin. 
miRNA146a mimics was administrated to asthma mice or transfected to activated 
ILC2 purified from asthma mice lung. RT-PCR was used to detect miRNA146a level 
in lung tissue and ILC2. IL-5 and IL-13 levels in culture supernatant were 
detected by flow cytometry. Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), 
TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 1 (STAT1) protein expression levels were detected by western blot. 
miR-146a directly inhibited ILC2 function and suppressed ILC2 proliferation both 
in vivo and in vitro. During stimulation of ILC2, miR-146a expression gradually 
increased with a decrease of cell proliferation. Modulation of ILC2 function by 
miR-146a may depend on IL-33/interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1 or ST2) 
signaling through inhibiting IRAK1 and TRAF6.miR-146a can inhibit IRAK1 and 
TRAF6, downstream molecules of ST2 signal pathway, thereby negatively regulate 
IL-33/ST2-activated ILC2 to inhibit asthma. Targeting miR-146 maybe a novel 
strategy for the treatment of allergic asthma.
