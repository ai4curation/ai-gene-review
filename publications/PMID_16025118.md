Loss of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein is a common initiating 
event in colon cancer. Here we show that thymocyte-specific loss of APC 
deregulated beta-catenin signaling and suppressed Notch-dependent transcription. 
These events promoted the proliferation of cells of the double-negative 3 and 4 
stages and reduced rearrangements between the variable, diversity and joining 
regions of the gene encoding T cell receptor (TCR) beta, encouraging 
developmental progression of aberrant thymocytes lacking pre-TCR and alphabeta 
TCR. Simultaneously, the loss of APC prolonged the mitotic metaphase-to-anaphase 
checkpoint and impaired chromosome segregation, blocking development beyond the 
double-negative 4 stage. The result was extensive thymic atrophy and increased 
frequencies of thymocytes with chromosomal abnormalities. Thus, loss of APC in 
immature thymocytes has consequences distinct from those of deregulation of 
beta-catenin signaling and is essential for T cell differentiation.

Abstract

Loss of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein is a common initiating event in colon cancer. Here we show that thymocyte-specific loss of APC deregulated β-catenin signaling and suppressed Notch-dependent transcription. These events promoted the proliferation of cells of the double-negative 3 and 4 stages and reduced rearrangements between the variable, diversity and joining regions of the gene encoding T cell receptor (TCR) β, encouraging developmental progression of aberrant thymocytes lacking pre-TCR and αβ TCR. Simultaneously, the loss of APC prolonged the mitotic metaphase-to-anaphase checkpoint and impaired chromosome segregation, blocking development beyond the double-negative 4 stage. The result was extensive thymic atrophy and increased frequencies of thymocytes with chromosomal abnormalities. Thus, loss of APC in immature thymocytes has consequences distinct from those of deregulation of β-catenin signaling and is essential for T cell differentiation.

DISCUSSION

Loss of APC function affects thymocyte development through two independent and conflicting molecular pathways, one involving the canonical Wnt–β-catenin signaling cascade and the other affecting chromosome segregation. Stabilization of β-catenin supports pre-TCR-independent thymocyte proliferation and promotes developmental progression without pre-TCR and αβ-TCR signaling. Here we have demonstrated that this aberrant differentiation involves inhibition of Notch-dependent transcription and suppression of Tcrb rearrangements in mice with active recombination-activating gene 1 and 2 proteins. Stabilization of β-catenin was a direct consequence of the loss of APC. Both the stabilization and ensuing molecular events were comparable in APC-deficient LckCre- Apc lox/lox468 and β-catenin-stabilized LckCre- Ctnnb1 +/lox(ex3) thymocytes, yet the absence of APC resulted in a substantial blockade in T cell development at the DN4 stage and extensive thymic atrophy. The blockade occurred at the level of chromosome segregation and resulted in prolongation of the cell cycle length. These in vivo observations demonstrate the disparity in the consequences of the loss of APC and stabilization of β-catenin in a developmental process that requires extensive cellular proliferation. Thymocytes that escaped the APC deficiency blockade were enriched for chromosomal abnormalities, emphasizing the vital function of APC in chromosome segregation and stability.

DN3 and DN4 thymocytes of both LckCre- Apc lox/lox468 and LckCre- Ctnnb1 +/lox(ex3) mice had reduced Tcrb V-to-DJ rearrangements. Recombination-activating gene–dependent Tcr rearrangement at the DN3 stage is the single most important event for further T cell maturation. In the mouse, Tcrb rearrangements are controlled by the Tcrb enhancer, located downstream of the constant 2 region of Tcrb 40 . As this fragment contains no consensus binding sites for Tcf-1 and Lef-1, the suppression of Tcrb VDJ-β rearrangements in LckCre- Apc lox/lox468 and LckCre- Ctnnb1 +/lox(ex3) thymocytes is unlikely to be a direct consequence of β-catenin signaling. We have provided evidence that this suppression may be due in part to the downregulation of Notch activity by β-catenin signaling.

In our studies, loss of APC function and stabilization of β-catenin correlated with suppression of several Notch-dependent transcripts at the DN4 stage of thymocyte development, including Notch1 and Notch3 as well as the Notch targets Hes1 and Dtx1 . Conditional thymocyte-specific deletion of Notch1 using the LckCre transgene has been reported to result in reduced VDJ-β rearrangements 21 . To link suppression of rearrangements with the modulation of Notch activity by β-catenin, we introduced NotchIC into immature LckCre- Apc lox/lox468 and LckCre- Ctnnb1 +/lox(ex3) thymocytes starting at the DN2 and DN3 stages and allowed them to differentiate in OP9-DL1 cocultures in vitro . Indeed, a substantial fraction of DP and SP cells developing from these retrovirus-transduced thymocytes had undergone Tcrb V-to-DJ rearrangements and expressed intracellular TCRβ chains. We conclude that crosstalk between β-catenin and Notch may affect at least in part Tcrb VDJ rearrangements.

Negative and positive genetic interactions between Notch and the analog of Wnt in Drosophila melanogaster (Wingless) are thought to be critical in many cell fate decisions 37 . Evidence in mouse systems has lent support to those proposals and has indicated involvement of Notch and Wnt interactions in the regulation of differentiation and self-renewal 34 – 36 . Our findings are in line with those proposals indicating antagonistic interaction between the Wnt–β-catenin and Notch activities in developing thymocytes.

As for the length of the cell cycle, DN4 thymocytes that lacked APC function underwent on average one to one-and-a-half fewer cell cycles than their LckCre or LckCre- Ctnnb1 +/lox(ex3) counterparts in 3 d of culture together with OP9-DL1 cells. Cell cycle analyses indicated that this was due to a delayed exit from mitosis. One explanation for this is likely to be a delay in chromosome segregation. Evidence for such a delay was provided by the frequent detection of mitotic cells with 80 chromatids in DN thymocytes from LckCre- Apc lox/lox468 mice. These cells represent the stage after chromatid separation and before cytokinesis. The rapid segregation of sister chromatids after separation to the opposite poles of the mitotic spindle renders this stage undetectable in normal thymocytes. The detection of this stage in LckCre- Apc lox/lox468 DN thymocytes indicated defects in the meta-phase-to-anaphase transition resulting in inhibition of chromosome segregation. Involvement of APC in the control of chromosome segregation has been suggested by studies documenting localization of APC at the kinetochore during mitosis 10 , 11 . The exact function of APC at the kinetochore is not clearly understood. However, APC interacts with the microtubule end-binding protein EB1 (ref. 41 ). APC also binds to and stabilizes microtubules 42 , localizes to the ends of microtubules embedded in kinetochores, forms a complex with mitotic checkpoint proteins Bub1 and Bub3 and is a substrate for both Bub1 and BubR1 kinases in vitro 10 . To ensure accurate segregation, the mitotic checkpoint acts to block entry into anaphase until both kinetochores of every duplicated chromatid pair have attached correctly to spindle microtubules. Accumulating evidence indicates that unattached kinetochores and/or those not under microtubule-induced tension mediate a ‘wait anaphase’ signal 43 . Anaphase ensues soon after the last kinetochore attaches to the spindle 44 and repeated detachment of a meiotic chromosome from a spindle by manipulation with a ‘micro-needle’ delays anaphase indefinitely 45 . APC might provide a non-motor-related functional link between the chromatids, microtubules and the components of the mitotic checkpoint. In that case, the absence of APC could result in a ‘wait anaphase’ signal similar to that of an unattached kinetochore.

Pre-TCR signaling is thought to promote the survival, proliferation and differentiation of immature thymocytes 46 , 47 . Moreover, the process of β-selection requires both Notch and pre-TCR signaling 48 . It is possible that concomitant inhibition of pre-TCR expression and Notch activity may have contributed to the reduced proliferation as well as increased apoptosis of LckCre- Apc lox/lox468 and LckCre- Ctnnb1 +/lox(ex3) DN4 thymocytes. Activated Wnt–β-catenin signaling in these abnormally developing thymocytes may bypass the differentiation signals attributed to the pre-TCR and Notch pathways but may only partially substitute for the proliferation and survival signals 26 , 48 .

Our findings have indicated that loss of APC function poses a dilemma for the developing thymocyte. It stabilizes β-catenin, down-regulates Notch-dependent signaling, suppresses Tcrb rearrangements and allows for pre-TCR-independent proliferation and aberrant developmental progression. However, it also impairs the cell cycle by imposing a blockade in the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. A solution to this dilemma may be genetic instability and selection for mutations that alleviate the cell cycle block. Thus, whereas independent stabilization of β-catenin would be expected to lead to the accumulation of abnormal cells, it is the loss of APC that is likely to ‘select for’ malignancy.
