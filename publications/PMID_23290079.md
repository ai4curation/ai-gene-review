Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is severely limited in its natural host, 
primary human keratinocytes. Our data show HPV infectivity in primary 
keratinocytes is over 100- and 1,000-fold lower than in established keratinocyte 
cell lines NIKS and HaCaT, respectively. Here, we show that the basal level of 
autophagy in primary human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) is higher than in 
immortalized keratinocytes, and that HPV16 virions significantly induce 
autophagy in HFKs. Interestingly, HPV16 infectivity is dramatically enhanced by 
knockdown of essential autophagy genes as well as biochemical inhibition of 
autophagy. The increase in HPV16 infectivity by autophagy inhibition is most 
significant in HFKs, showing an inverse correlation with basal HPV16 infectivity 
in HFK, NIKS, HaCaT, and 293FT cells. Further, inhibition of autophagy delays 
degradation of HPV16 capsid proteins during virus trafficking, indicating that 
host autophagy induced by HPV16 virions inhibits infection of primary 
keratinocytes through rapid degradation of viral capsid proteins.
