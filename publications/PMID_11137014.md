Huntington's disease is characterised by the death of cortical and striatal 
neurons, and is the result of an expanded polyglutamine tract in the Huntingtin 
protein [1]. Huntingtin is present on both endocytic and secretory membrane 
organelles but its function is unclear [2,3]. Rab GTPases regulate both of these 
transport pathways [4]. We have previously shown that Rab8 controls polarised 
membrane transport by modulating cell morphogenesis [5]. To understand 
Rab8-mediated processes, we searched for Rab8-interacting proteins by the yeast 
two-hybrid system. Here, we report that Huntingtin is linked to the Rab8 protein 
through FIP-2, a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-inducible coiled-coil 
protein related to the NEMO protein [6,7]. The activated form of Rab8 interacted 
with the amino-terminal region of FIP-2, whereas dominant-negative Rab8 did not. 
Huntingtin bound to the carboxy-terminal region of FIP-2. Coexpressed FIP-2 and 
Huntingtin enhanced the recruitment of Huntingtin to Rab8-positive vesicular 
structures, and FIP-2 promoted cell polarisation in a similar way to Rab8. We 
propose a model in which Huntingtin, together with FIP-2 and Rab8, are part of a 
protein network that regulates membrane trafficking and cellular morphogenesis.
