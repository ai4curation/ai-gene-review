Intracellular accumulations of mutant, misfolded proteins are major pathological 
hallmarks of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and related disorders. 
Recently, mutations in Sigma receptor 1 (SigR1) have been found to cause a form 
of ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Our goal was to pinpoint 
alterations and modifications of SigR1 in ALS and to determine how these changes 
contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS. In the present study, we found that 
levels of the SigR1 protein were reduced in lumbar ALS patient spinal cord. 
SigR1 was abnormally accumulated in enlarged C-terminals and endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) structures of alpha motor neurons. These accumulations 
co-localized with the 20s proteasome subunit. SigR1 accumulations were also 
observed in SOD1 transgenic mice, cultured ALS-8 patient's fibroblasts with the 
P56S-VAPB mutation and in neuronal cell culture models. Along with the 
accumulation of SigR1 and several other proteins involved in protein quality 
control, severe disturbances in the unfolded protein response and impairment of 
protein degradation pathways were detected in the above-mentioned cell culture 
systems. Furthermore, shRNA knockdown of SigR1 lead to deranged calcium 
signaling and caused abnormalities in ER and Golgi structures in cultured NSC-34 
cells. Finally, pharmacological activation of SigR1 induced the clearance of 
mutant protein aggregates in these cells. Our results support the notion that 
SigR1 is abnormally modified and contributes to the pathogenesis of ALS.
