DNA Topoisomerase IIalpha (topoIIalpha) is a DNA decatenating enzyme, abundant 
constituent of mammalian mitotic chromosomes, and target of numerous antitumor 
drugs, but its exact role in chromosome structure and dynamics is unclear. In a 
powerful new approach to this important problem, with significant advantages 
over the use of topoII inhibitors or RNA interference, we have generated and 
characterized a human cell line (HTETOP) in which >99.5% topoIIalpha expression 
can be silenced in all cells by the addition of tetracycline. 
TopoIIalpha-depleted HTETOP cells enter mitosis and undergo chromosome 
condensation, albeit with delayed kinetics, but normal anaphases and cytokineses 
are completely prevented, and all cells die, some becoming polyploid in the 
process. Cells can be rescued by expression of topoIIalpha fused to green 
fluorescent protein (GFP), even when certain phosphorylation sites have been 
mutated, but not when the catalytic residue Y805 is mutated. Thus, in addition 
to validating GFP-tagged topoIIalpha as an indicator for endogenous topoIIalpha 
dynamics, our analyses provide new evidence that topoIIalpha plays a largely 
redundant role in chromosome condensation, but an essential catalytic role in 
chromosome segregation that cannot be complemented by topoIIbeta and does not 
require phosphorylation at serine residues 1106, 1247, 1354, or 1393.

Abstract

DNA Topoisomerase IIα (topoIIα) is a DNA decatenating enzyme, abundant constituent of mammalian mitotic chromosomes, and target of numerous antitumor drugs, but its exact role in chromosome structure and dynamics is unclear. In a powerful new approach to this important problem, with significant advantages over the use of topoII inhibitors or RNA interference, we have generated and characterized a human cell line (HTETOP) in which >99.5% topoIIα expression can be silenced in all cells by the addition of tetracycline. TopoIIα-depleted HTETOP cells enter mitosis and undergo chromosome condensation, albeit with delayed kinetics, but normal anaphases and cytokineses are completely prevented, and all cells die, some becoming polyploid in the process. Cells can be rescued by expression of topoIIα fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), even when certain phosphorylation sites have been mutated, but not when the catalytic residue Y805 is mutated. Thus, in addition to validating GFP-tagged topoIIα as an indicator for endogenous topoIIα dynamics, our analyses provide new evidence that topoIIα plays a largely redundant role in chromosome condensation, but an essential catalytic role in chromosome segregation that cannot be complemented by topoIIβ and does not require phosphorylation at serine residues 1106, 1247, 1354, or 1393.

INTRODUCTION

Type II topoisomerases are ubiquitous, highly conserved proteins that catalyze the passage of one DNA duplex through another, creating a transient double-strand break (DSB) in the latter ( Watt and Hickson, 1994 ; Wang, 2002 ). Studies in a variety of systems indicate that topoII is essential for cellular viability and that it plays a key role in chromosome segregation. Thus, the abnormal cell divisions seen in yeast top2 mutants ( Holm et al ., 1985 ; Uemura and Yanagida, 1986 ), and in vertebrate cells treated with topoII inhibitors ( Downes et al ., 1991 ; Ishida et al ., 1991 , 1994 ; Haraguchi et al ., 2000 ) are consistent with the unique ability of topoII to resolve the sister chromatids catenations generated when DNA replication forks meet ( Wang, 2002 ). TopoII has been implicated in mammalian centromere function ( Floridia et al ., 2000 ; Spence et al ., 2002 ), and it has been suggested that topoII in yeast may play a role in centromeric chromatin structure ( Bachant et al ., 2002 ). Further work is required to understand the relationship between any such structural role, topoII-mediated chromatid decatenation, and the role of the cohesin complex ( Nasmyth, 2002 ) in maintaining sister chromatid cohesion until anaphase ( Bernard and Allshire, 2002 ).

TopoII also has been implicated in DNA recombination, replication, transcription, and chromosome condensation ( Watt and Hickson, 1994 ; Wang, 2002 ). Of these, chromosome condensation is the only process in which topoII is widely reported to play an essential role ( Koshland and Strunnikov, 1996 ; Losada and Hirano, 2001 ; Swedlow and Hirano, 2003 ), but the data are equivocal. Genetic analyses suggest that topoII is required for chromosome condensation in Schizosaccharamyces pombe ( Uemura et al ., 1987 ) but not in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Lavoie et al ., 2002 ). In vitro studies of chromosome condensation in mitotic extracts ( Newport and Spann, 1987 ; Adachi et al ., 1991 ; Hirano and Mitchison, 1991 , 1993 ), in which topoII is immunodepleted or inactivated by inhibitors, showed varying requirements for topoII. In the absence of suitable topoII mutants, in vivo studies in higher eukaryotes have made use of topoII inhibitors ( Andoh et al ., 1993 ; Downes et al ., 1994 ; Gorbsky, 1994 ; Ishida et al ., 1994 ; Gimenez-Abian et al ., 1995 ; Andreassen et al ., 1997 ; Gimenez-Abian et al ., 2000 ) or RNA interference ( Chang et al ., 2003 ; Sakaguchi and Kikuchi, 2004 ). Such studies mostly support a role for topoII in chromosome condensation, but again, condensation was impaired to varying degrees, and in some cases ( Andreassen et al ., 1997 ; Chang et al ., 2003 ; Sakaguchi and Kikuchi, 2004 ) impairment was surprisingly mild or absent. Thus, although both structural ( Mirkovitch et al ., 1988 ; Hart and Laemmli, 1998 ) and catalytic ( Koshland and Strunnikov, 1996 ; Hirano, 2000 ) models for how topoII may be involved in chromosome condensation have been proposed, the issue of whether topoII is required for condensation remains controversial.

Vertebrates have two very similar topoII isoforms (α and β) encoded by distinct genes. Although both human isoforms can complement yeast TOP2 mutants ( Jensen et al ., 1996 ), only the α isoform is abundantly associated with chromosomes throughout mitosis ( Christensen et al ., 2002 ), particularly at centromeres ( Rattner et al ., 1996 ; Christensen et al ., 2002 ). Furthermore, the toxic effects of topoII inhibitors and the viability of topoIIβ-deficient cells ( Khelifa et al ., 1994 ; Yang et al ., 2000 ) together suggest that only the α isoform is essential for cellular viability. Consistent with this, development of mouse TOPOII α-/- embryos was found to terminate at the four- to eight-cell stage with chromosome segregation defects ( Akimitsu et al ., 2003 ). A detailed genetic approach to topoIIα function therefore requires conditional mutagenesis.

Conditional mutagenesis offers several advantages over the use of topoII inhibitors for the analysis of topoIIα function. First, it specifically inactivates only the α isoform and is certain to remove any structural role. Second, it avoids the complication of side effects, especially DNA DSBs, which were initially thought to be limited to topoII “poisons” such as etoposide, but more recently linked to catalytic inhibitors such as ICRF-193 ( van Hille et al ., 1999 ; Huang et al ., 2001 ; Kobayashi et al ., 2001 ; Wang and Eastmond, 2002 ; Adachi et al ., 2003 ). Third, conditional mutagenesis allows complementation studies to be done. Although RNA interference can be used to deplete individual topoII isoforms ( Sakaguchi and Kikuchi, 2004 ), this approach has not yet been applied to topoII in a way that avoids significant residual expression or allows for complementation analyses. Complementation would be particularly valuable for the analysis of the numerous phosphoryation sites in topoIIα, which have variously been implicated in controlling topoIIα activity, resistance to inhibition, and subcellular localization, but whose true physiological significance remains untested ( Isaacs et al ., 1998 ; Chikamori et al ., 2003 ). Similarly, the ability of biofluorescent topoIIα (topoIIαGFP) derivatives to complement topoIIα-deficient cells could be tested, providing a necessary adjunct to recent important studies of topoIIαGFP dynamics ( Christensen et al ., 2002 ; Tavormina et al ., 2002 ).

We describe here the use of conditional gene targeting in somatic cells ( Porter, 1998 ; Hudson et al ., 2002 ) to generate a cell line, HTETOP, in which endogenous TOPOII α genes are disrupted and transcription of an exogenous TOPOII α cDNA is controlled by the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) ( Gossen et al ., 1994 ). TopoIIα expression in HTETOP cells is dependent on the absence of tetracycline, or its analogue doxycycline, in the growth medium. Analyses of HTETOP cells provide new and direct evidence, with considerable advantages over previous studies based on inhibitors or RNA interference (RNAi), showing topoIIα to be essential for chromosome segregation but not for chromosome condensation. They show further that a highly dynamic green fluorescent protein (GFP)-topoIIα fusion protein is a valid reporter for topoIIα dynamics in vivo and that essential cellular topoIIα functions do not require phosphorylation at any of four serine residues (1106, 1247, 1354, or 1393) previously shown to subject cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation.

DISCUSSION

The HTETOP cells described here provide a unique system for the analysis of human topoIIα function, allowing the effects of sustained topoIIα depletion (to <0.5% normal levels) to be studied and complementation analyses to be carried out. As discussed below, our observations during such studies help to define various controversial aspects of topoII function.
