Erythropoietin (Epo) binding to its receptor (EpoR) induces tyrosine 
phosphorylation in responsive cells and this ability is required for a mitogenic 
response. One of the substrates of tyrosine phosphorylation is the Epo receptor 
(EpoR). The carboxyl region of EpoR cytoplasmic domain is required for EpoR 
phosphorylation and has been shown to negatively affect the response to Epo both 
in vivo and in cell lines. Hematopoietic cell phosphatase (HCP) has also been 
hypothesized to negatively regulate erythropoiesis, based on the 
hypersensitivity to Epo of erythroid lineage cells in moth-eaten mice that 
genetically lack HCP. In the studies presented here, we show that HCP binds the 
tyrosine phosphorylated Epo receptor through the amino-terminal src-homology 2 
(SH2) domain of HCP. Using a series of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides, 
potential HCP binding sites in the cytoplasmic domain of the EpoR are 
identified. The results support the concept that, after Epo stimulation, 
phosphorylation of EpoR provides a docking site for HCP in the receptor complex. 
Recruitment of HCP to the complex and its subsequent dephosphorylation of 
substrates and/or associated kinases may be important to mitigate the 
ligand-induced mitogenic response.
