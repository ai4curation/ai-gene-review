Interleukin 2 regulates its own receptors.

Smith KA, Cantrell DA.

The cell surface density of high-affinity membrane receptors for the 
T-lymphocytotrophic hormone interleukin 2 (IL-2) determines the rate of 
T-cell-cycle progression. Since 10-fold greater numbers of IL-2 receptor 
molecules were found by using a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody reactive with 
IL-2 receptors (anti-Tac) compared with binding of IL-2, the functional 
relationship of the binding sites recognized by both of these ligands was 
assessed. In the presence of cycloheximide, IL-2 binding sites declined with a 
half-time (t1/2) of 2.6 hr, whereas the decay of anti-Tac binding sites was much 
slower (t 1/2 = 6.4 hr). Moreover, after limited membrane proteolysis, the 
half-time for the reappearance of IL-2 binding sites was remarkably similar to 
its decay (t 1/2 = 2.2 hr), while Tac antigen reappearance was markedly 
retarded, returning to only 20% of original levels within 5 hr after 
proteolysis. Addition of homogeneous immunoaffinity-purified IL-2 to cell 
populations that expressed equivalent IL-2 and anti-Tac binding sites resulted 
in a time- and temperature-dependent 8- to 10-fold enhancement of Tac epitope 
expression and, simultaneously, a 20-30% diminishment of detectable 
high-affinity IL-2 binding sites. As the magnitude of the IL-2-dependent 
proliferative response correlated with the density of high-affinity IL-2 binding 
sites, rather than Tac antigen levels, quantitation of Tac epitope density does 
not provide a reliable indication of IL-2-responsiveness among activated T-cell 
populations. Instead, IL-2-receptor interactions actually promote the loss of 
IL-2 responsiveness by diminishing the density of high-affinity binding sites at 
the time that Tac antigen levels are increased.
