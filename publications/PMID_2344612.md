The nuclear envelope is a dynamic structure that completely disassembles in 
response to MPF/cdc2 activity in mitosis. A key feature of this process is the 
hyperphosphorylation of the major structural proteins of the envelope, the 
nuclear lamins A, B, and C. Two highly conserved serine residues of the lamin 
protein (Ser-22 and Ser-392 of lamins A and C) are symmetrically positioned 5 
amino acids from the ends of the large alpha-helical domain and are shown in the 
accompanying paper by Ward and Kirschner to be among four sites phosphorylated 
during nuclear envelope breakdown. Mutations in Ser-22 and Ser-392 that prevent 
phosphorylation at these sites block the disassembly of the nuclear lamina 
during mitosis. We propose a model for the regulation of lamin assembly in which 
phosphorylation just outside the ends of the alpha-helical domain controls the 
assembly dynamics of the lamin coiled-coil dimers.
