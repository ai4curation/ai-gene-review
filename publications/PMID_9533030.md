Complex II (succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is an important enzyme complex 
in both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the aerobic respiratory chains of 
mitochondria in eukaryotic cells and prokaryotic organisms. In this study, the 
amino acid sequences of the large (cybL) and small (cybS) subunits of cytochrome 
b in human liver complex II were deduced from cDNAs isolated by homology probing 
with mixed primers for the polymerase chain reaction. The mature cybL and cybS 
contain 140 and 103 amino acids, respectively, and show little similarity to the 
amino acid sequences of the subunits from other species in contrast to the 
highly conserved features of the flavoprotein (Fp) subunit and iron-sulfur 
protein (Ip) subunit. From hydrophobicity analysis, both cybL and cybS appear to 
have three transmembrane segments, indicating their role as membrane-anchors for 
the enzyme complex. Histidine residues, which are possible heme axial ligands in 
cytochrome b of complex II, were found in the second transmembrane segment of 
each subunit. The genes for cybL (SDHC) and cybS (SDHD) were mapped to 
chromosome 1q21 and 11q23, respectively by fluorescent in situ hybridization 
(FISH).
