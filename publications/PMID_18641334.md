ICOS ligation in concert with TCR stimulation results in strong PI3K activation 
in T lymphocytes. The ICOS cytoplasmic tail contains an YMFM motif that binds 
the p85alpha subunit of class IA PI3K, similar to the YMNM motif of CD28, 
suggesting a redundant function of the two receptors in PI3K signaling. However, 
ICOS costimulation shows greater PI3K activity than CD28 in T cells. We show in 
this report that ICOS expression in activated T cells triggers the participation 
of p50alpha, one of the regulatory subunits of class IA PI3Ks. Using different 
T-APC cell conjugate systems, we report that p50alpha accumulates at the 
immunological synapse in activated but not in resting T cells. Our results 
demonstrate that ICOS membrane expression is involved in this process and that 
p50alpha plasma membrane accumulation requires a functional YMFM Src homology 2 
domain-binding motif in ICOS. We also show that ICOS triggering with its ligand, 
ICOSL, induces the recruitment of p50alpha at the synapse of T cell/APC 
conjugates. In association with the p110 catalytic subunit, p50alpha is known to 
carry a stronger lipid kinase activity compared with p85alpha. Accordingly, we 
observed that ICOS engagement results in a stronger activation of PI3K. 
Together, these findings provide evidence that p50alpha is likely a determining 
factor in ICOS-mediated PI3K activity in T cells. These results also suggest 
that a differential recruitment and activity of class IA PI3K subunits 
represents a novel mechanism in the control of PI3K signaling by costimulatory 
molecules.
