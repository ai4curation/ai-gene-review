Telomere length in humans is partly controlled by a feedback mechanism in which 
telomere elongation by telomerase is limited by the accumulation of the TRF1 
complex at chromosome ends. TRF1 itself can be inhibited by the poly(ADP-ribose) 
polymerase (PARP) activity of its interacting partner tankyrase 1, which 
abolishes its DNA binding activity in vitro and removes the TRF1 complex from 
telomeres in vivo. Here we report that the inhibition of TRF1 by tankyrase is in 
turn controlled by a second TRF1-interacting factor, TIN2 (ref. 6). Partial 
knockdown of TIN2 by small hairpin RNA in a telomerase-positive cell line 
resulted in telomere elongation, which is typical of reduced TRF1 function. 
Transient inhibition of TIN2 with small interfering RNA led to diminished 
telomeric TRF1 signals. This effect could be reversed with the PARP inhibitor 
3-aminobenzamide and did not occur in cells overexpressing a PARP-dead mutant of 
tankyrase 1. TIN2 formed a ternary complex with TRF1 and tankyrase 1 and 
stabilized their interaction, an effect also observed with the PARP-dead mutant 
of tankyrase 1. In vitro, TIN2 protected TRF1 from poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by 
tankyrase 1 without affecting tankyrase 1 automodification. These data identify 
TIN2 as a PARP modulator in the TRF1 complex and can explain how TIN2 
contributes to the regulation of telomere length.
