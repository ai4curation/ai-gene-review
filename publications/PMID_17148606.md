Pathogenic bacterial effectors suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern 
(PAMP)-triggered host immunity, thereby promoting parasitism. In the presence of 
cognate resistance genes, it is proposed that plants detect the virulence 
activity of bacterial effectors and trigger a defense response, referred to here 
as effector-triggered immunity (ETI). However, the link between effector 
virulence and ETI at the molecular level is unknown. Here, we show that the 
Pseudomonas syringae effector AvrB suppresses PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) 
through RAR1, a co-chaperone of HSP90 required for ETI. AvrB expressed in plants 
lacking the cognate resistance gene RPM1 suppresses cell wall defense induced by 
the flagellar peptide flg22, a well known PAMP, and promotes the growth of 
nonpathogenic bacteria in a RAR1-dependent manner. rar1 mutants display enhanced 
cell wall defense in response to flg22, indicating that RAR1 negatively 
regulates PTI. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that 
RAR1 and AvrB interact in the plant. The results demonstrate that RAR1 
molecularly links PTI, effector virulence, and ETI. The study supports that both 
pathogen virulence and plant disease resistance have evolved around PTI.

Abstract

Pathogenic bacterial effectors suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered host immunity, thereby promoting parasitism. In the presence of cognate resistance genes, it is proposed that plants detect the virulence activity of bacterial effectors and trigger a defense response, referred to here as effector-triggered immunity (ETI). However, the link between effector virulence and ETI at the molecular level is unknown. Here, we show that the Pseudomonas syringae effector AvrB suppresses PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) through RAR1, a cochaperone of HSP90 required for ETI. AvrB expressed in plants lacking the cognate resistance gene RPM1 suppresses cell wall defense induced by the flagellar peptide flg22, a well known PAMP, and promotes the growth of nonpathogenic bacteria in a RAR1 -dependent manner. rar1 mutants display enhanced cell wall defense in response to flg22, indicating that RAR1 negatively regulates PTI. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that RAR1 and AvrB interact in the plant. The results demonstrate that RAR1 molecularly links PTI, effector virulence, and ETI. The study supports that both pathogen virulence and plant disease resistance have evolved around PTI.

Discussion

RAR1, together with SGT1 and HSP90, is known to play a key role in ETI to diverse pathogens ( 6 – 8 , 21 , 34 – 39 ). A role of these proteins in bacterial effector virulence function has not been reported. Our results show that RAR1 negatively regulates basal defense and is required for AvrB-mediated suppression of basal defense, providing a molecular link between the effector-mediated suppression of basal defense and R gene-mediated disease resistance.

RAR1 is known to act as a cochaperone of HSP90 to stabilize certain NB-LRR resistance proteins, including RPM1, the cognate resistance protein of AvrB ( 7 – 11 , 21 ). Perhaps RAR1 also assists the accumulation of proteins that negatively regulate PAMP-induced defenses. Because RAR1 is required for all aspects of AvrB-induced phenotypes, whereas COI1 is required only for the enhanced bacterial growth in the plant, it is most likely that RAR1 acts upstream of COI1. It is not clear how RAR1 mediates the activation of JA signaling after AvrB expression. One scenario is that RAR1 does so through the interaction with SGT1. Consistent with this speculation, rar1–29 is unable to interact with SGT1b. Although we have not tested whether it is required for AvrB virulence, SGT1b is known to play a role in JA signaling ( 40 ).

Although enhanced bacterial growth is observed only when AvrB is expressed in plants, two lines of evidence indicate that our findings are relevant to the AvrB function in the natural setting. Both the P. syringae ( avrB )-induced RAP2.6 gene expression and the AvrB-mediated bacterial growth required COI1 ( Fig. 3 B ; ref. 3 ). Similarly, RAR1 is required for both P. syringae ( avrB )-induced RAP2.6 gene expression and the AvrB transgene-dependent susceptibility and defense suppression ( Figs. 1 A and 4 ). These results support that the AvrB transgene-dependent susceptibility is intrinsically linked to the virulence function of the P. syringae -delivered AvrB.

The previously identified effector target proteins are required for ETI ( 13 – 16 ) but not the effector virulence function. For example, the RPM1-interacting protein RIN4 is an intensively studied effector target that mediates both RPM1 and RPS2 resistance by interacting with their cognate effectors AvrRpm1, AvrB and AvrRpt2. Similar to RAR1, the RIN4 protein also acts as a negative regulator that attenuates PAMP-induced callose deposition in the absence of the effectors ( 29 ). Both AvrRpm1 and AvrRpt2 were shown to suppress PTI. AvrRpt2 is a cysteine protease that cleaves RIN4 ( 13 , 14 , 16 ), whereas AvrRpm1 and AvrB cause the phosphorylation of RIN4 through an unknown mechanism ( 12 ). However, it remains unexplained why the degradation of RIN4 by AvrRpt2 does not enhance PTI in plants lacking the cognate resistance gene RPS2 . In fact, RIN4 is not required for the virulence function of AvrRpt2 and AvrRpm1 ( 29 ) and leaf chlorosis caused by AvrB overexpression ( 41 ). It is suggested that other proteins associated with RIN4 might be required for the AvrRpt2 and AvrRpm1 virulence functions ( 29 ).

It is likely that RAR1 is targeted by AvrB to suppress PTI. Although the yeast two-hybrid experiments failed to detect an interaction of RAR1 with AvrB, coimmunoprecipitation detected an AvrB–RAR1 interaction. Perhaps the interaction is indirect or stabilized by a plant-specific protein. The interaction does not appear to involve RIN4, because we were not able to detect an interaction between RIN4 and RAR1. Nonetheless, it is significant that both RAR1 and RIN4 negatively regulate PTI and are targeted, directly or indirectly, by AvrB. Therefore, host proteins that negatively regulate PTI may be an Achilles' heel in innate immunity that is actively exploited by bacterial effectors. That RIN4 and RAR1 are required for the function of multiple resistance proteins suggests that these negative regulators of PTI are common “guardees” of resistance proteins ( SI Fig. 13 ). It is possible that resistance proteins are recruited to a protein complex containing negative regulators of the PAMP signaling pathway such as RIN4 and RAR1 to monitor effectors that suppress PTI. This enables the rapid activation of effector-triggered defenses when PAMP-triggered resistance is inhibited by the virulence factors.
