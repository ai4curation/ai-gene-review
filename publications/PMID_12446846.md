Activity and localization of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is 
regulated in a remarkably complex fashion, yet the complex molecular machinery 
mastering stimulus-induced eNOS translocation and trafficking is poorly 
understood. In a search by the yeast two-hybrid system using the eNOS oxygenase 
domain as bait, we have identified a previously uncharacterized eNOS-interacting 
protein, dubbed NOSTRIN (for eNOS traffic inducer). NOSTRIN contains a single 
polypeptide chain of 506-aa residues of 58 kDa with an N-terminal cdc15 domain 
and a C-terminal SH3 domain. NOSTRIN mRNA is abundant in highly vascularized 
tissues such as placenta, kidney, lung, and heart, and NOSTRIN protein is 
expressed in vascular endothelial cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments 
demonstrated the eNOS-NOSTRIN interaction in vitro and in vivo, and NOSTRIN's 
SH3 domain was essential and sufficient for eNOS binding. NOSTRIN colocalized 
extensively with eNOS at the plasma membrane of confluent human umbilical venous 
endothelial cells and in punctate cytosolic structures of CHO-eNOS cells. 
NOSTRIN overexpression induced a profound redistribution of eNOS from the plasma 
membrane to vesicle-like structures matching the NOSTRIN pattern and at the same 
time led to a significant inhibition of NO release. We conclude that NOSTRIN 
contributes to the intricate protein network controlling activity, trafficking, 
and targeting of eNOS.

Abstract

Activity and localization of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is regulated in a remarkably complex fashion, yet the complex molecular machinery mastering stimulus-induced eNOS translocation and trafficking is poorly understood. In a search by the yeast two-hybrid system using the eNOS oxygenase domain as bait, we have identified a previously uncharacterized eNOS-interacting protein, dubbed NOSTRIN (for eNOS traffic inducer). NOSTRIN contains a single polypeptide chain of 506-aa residues of 58 kDa with an N-terminal cdc15 domain and a C-terminal SH3 domain. NOSTRIN mRNA is abundant in highly vascularized tissues such as placenta, kidney, lung, and heart, and NOSTRIN protein is expressed in vascular endothelial cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the eNOS–NOSTRIN interaction in vitro and in vivo , and NOSTRIN's SH3 domain was essential and sufficient for eNOS binding. NOSTRIN colocalized extensively with eNOS at the plasma membrane of confluent human umbilical venous endothelial cells and in punctate cytosolic structures of CHO-eNOS cells. NOSTRIN overexpression induced a profound redistribution of eNOS from the plasma membrane to vesicle-like structures matching the NOSTRIN pattern and at the same time led to a significant inhibition of NO release. We conclude that NOSTRIN contributes to the intricate protein network controlling activity, trafficking, and targeting of eNOS.

Discussion

eNOS is a key enzyme of the cardiovascular system that  contributes to vascular homeostasis through tightly regulated NO  production. Multilateral control of eNOS activity affects  transcriptional activity, mRNA stability, posttranslational  modifications, reversible protein–protein interactions, as well as  routing of eNOS to subcellular targets such as plasma membrane and  Golgi apparatus ( 1 , 29–31 ). Dynamic changes of the intracellular eNOS  localization seem to be well coordinated, and because external stimuli  induce cycling of eNOS back and forth from the plasma membrane to  intracellular compartments, translocation has been implied in the  regulation of the enzyme's activity in vitro and in  vivo ( 29 ). For example, targeting of eNOS to plasma membrane and  cell–cell junctions upon cells reaching confluency is accompanied by a  strong increase in NO production ( 32 ). Further, oxidized LDL inhibits  agonist-induced NO formation in HUVEC caused by subcellular  redistribution of eNOS from the plasma membrane, while substrate and  cofactor supply as well as eNOS expression are unchanged ( 33 ). To date,  the molecular machinery targeting eNOS to various intracellular  locales, the factors and mechanisms governing this translocation, and  the physiological consequences ensuing from eNOS trafficking have  remained largely unknown.

Here, we report the identification and characterization of a previously  uncharacterized protein, NOSTRIN, affecting the subcellular  localization of eNOS. Display of a single cdc15 and SH3 domain each  characterize the protein as a member of the Pombe cdc15 homology (PCH)  family of proteins ( 34 ), including CD2BP1 ( 35 ), PACSIN1 ( 36 ), PSTPIP  ( 37 ), as well as the nonmammalian homologue CG4040. The functions of  PCH proteins are not fully understood, but they have been implied with  dynamic rearrangements of the cytoskeleton ( 34 ). The dependence on the  integrity of the cdc15 domain of the typical punctate subcellular  distribution pattern as well as the poor solubility of NOSTRIN might  indicate a common property among NOSTRIN and other PCH family members  with respect to their cytoskeletal association.

Analysis of the expression profile of NOSTRIN revealed that the  corresponding mRNA is present in a variety of human tissues, including  lung and kidney, that is, two highly vascularized organs known to be  associated with endothelium-dependent NO production. Because NOSTRIN is  also present in primary endothelial cells and in the endothelium of  cardiac vessels expressing eNOS ( 20 , 21 , 38 ), it seems reasonable to  assume that NOSTRIN and eNOS may interact in these cells under  physiological and/or pathological conditions. By contrast, NOSTRIN  mRNA is almost absent from tissue samples derived from the human  central nervous system where the neuronal isoform nNOS is the major  NO-producing enzyme ( 38 ). In keeping with this notion, our Y2H analyses  indicate that NOSTRIN does not interact with the oxygenase domain of  nNOS, nor does it bind to iNOS (N.O., unpublished observations).  NOSTRIN associates via its C-terminal domain (positions 433–506),  mainly consisting of the SH3 domain, with the oxygenase domain of eNOS  both in vitro and in vivo . Consistent with this  notion, the minimum sequence segment of eNOS sufficient for NOSTRIN  binding (positions 98–366) exposes a Pro-rich segment which may serve  as an SH3-binding site.

Overexpression of NOSTRIN in CHO cells mobilized eNOS such that the  membrane-bound fraction of eNOS was considerably reduced, and, at the  same time, eNOS was found to be associated with cytosolic vesicle-like  structures, where it colocalized with NOSTRIN. Redistribution of eNOS  in NOSTRIN-expressing CHO-eNOS cells was paralleled by a drastic  decrease in NO release, down to 33–38% of control cells (100%). This  marked inhibitory effect could be brought about by ( i )  direct inhibition of eNOS activity, ( ii ) modulation of  regulatory mechanisms such as phosphorylation or protein association  indirectly affecting eNOS activity, or ( iii ) intracellular  redistribution of eNOS. At present, we cannot rule out that NOSTRIN  interferes with eNOS activity through similar allosteric mechanisms  such as Ca 2+ -calmodulin, although the  eNOS-binding sites for the two proteins are clearly distinct.

In vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-triggered  endothelial cells, hsp90 mediates the interaction between eNOS and Akt  by inducing the transition from the “early”  Ca 2+ -dependent to the “late”  phosphorylation-dependent activation of eNOS ( 13 ). It is conceivable  that NOSTRIN may modulate eNOS (de)phosphorylation, thereby affecting  subcellular distribution and, thus, activity of eNOS. Indeed,  “correct” compartmentalization of eNOS is an absolute requirement  for VEGF-driven phosphorylation ( 39 ) and full-blown activation of eNOS  ( 8 , 10 ). Distinct localization patterns in subconfluent microvascular  endothelial cells vs. confluent monolayers have been reported for eNOS,  and establishment of cell–cell contacts has been implied in its  recruitment to intercellular junctions, followed by a significant  increase in NO release ( 32 ). As demonstrated in this article, NOSTRIN  is also targeted to the plasma membrane and possibly to intercellular  junctions upon cells reaching confluency, so it is tempting to  speculate that NOSTRIN induces translocation of eNOS to these sites,  allowing agonist-induced eNOS activation to occur in “proper”  locations.

Recently, we identified an eNOS-interacting protein, NOSIP, which  likely forms part of the hypothetical eNOS translocation machinery  ( 18 ). Given that both NOSIP and NOSTRIN partake in the intracellular  reshuffling of eNOS, one may ask how these two proteins differ. First,  the proteins are structurally unrelated. Second, NOSIP is in the  cytosol and also in the nucleus ( 40 ), whereas NOSTRIN is found  exclusively in extranuclear locations. Third, NOSIP overexpression  induces eNOS translocation into the proximity of the Golgi apparatus  and cytoskeletal structures, whereas NOSTRIN overexpression targets the  enzyme to vesicle-like structures spread all over the cytosol. Hence,  NOSIP and NOSTRIN may share some of their functional features but  clearly differ in many other respects. Also, it is very possible that  NOSIP and NOSTRIN act in concert; however, we have not addressed this  intriguing possibility. Elucidation of the precise function and timing  of eNOS-interacting proteins will provide fresh insights into the  intricate molecular machinery delivering NO synthase capacity to the  various locales of the cell.
