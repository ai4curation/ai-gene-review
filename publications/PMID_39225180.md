The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that plays a vital role in the 
innate immune system in response to microbial infections and endogenous danger 
signals. Aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is implicated in a 
spectrum of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, emphasizing the necessity for 
precise regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome to maintain immune homeostasis. The 
protein level of NLRP3 is a limiting step for inflammasome activation, which 
must be tightly controlled to avoid detrimental consequences. Here, we 
demonstrate that ABHD8, a member of the α/β-hydrolase domain-containing (ABHD) 
family, interacts with NLRP3 and promotes its degradation through the 
chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) pathway. ABHD8 acts as a scaffold to recruit 
palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC12 to NLRP3 for its palmitoylation as well as 
subsequent CMA-mediated degradation. Notably, ABHD8 deficiency results in the 
stabilization of NLRP3 protein and promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We 
further confirm that ABHD8 overexpression ameliorates LPS- or alum-triggered 
NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vivo. Interestingly, the nucleocapsid (N) 
protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) impairs 
the ABHD8-NLRP3 association, resulting in an elevation in NLRP3 protein level 
and excessive inflammasome activation. These findings demonstrate that ABHD8 May 
represent a potential therapeutic target in conditions associated with NLRP3 
inflammasome dysregulation.Abbreviations: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; ABHD:
