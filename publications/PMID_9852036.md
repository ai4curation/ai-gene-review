Autophagy is an intracellular process for bulk degradation of cytoplasmic 
components. We recently found a protein conjugation system essential for 
autophagy in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The C-terminal glycine of a 
novel modifier protein, Apg12p, is conjugated to a lysine residue of Apg5p via 
an isopeptide bond. This conjugation reaction is mediated by Apg7p, a ubiquitin 
activating enzyme (E1)-like enzyme, and Apg10p, suggesting that it is a 
ubiquitination-like system (Mizushima, N., Noda, T., Yoshimori, T., Tanaka, Y., 
Ishii, T., George, M. D., Klionsky, D. J., Ohsumi, M. , and Ohsumi, Y. (1998) 
Nature 395, 395-398). Although autophagy is a ubiquitous process in eukaryotic 
cells, no molecule involved in autophagy has yet been identified in higher 
eukaryotes. We reasoned that this conjugation system could be conserved. Here we 
report cloning and characterization of the human homologue of Apg12 (hApg12). It 
is a 140-amino acid protein and possesses 27% identity and 48% similarity with 
the yeast Apg12p, but no apparent homology to ubiquitin. Northern blot analysis 
showed that its expression was ubiquitous in human tissues. We found that it was 
covalently attached to another protein. This target protein was identified to be 
the human Apg5 homologue (hApg5). Mutagenic analyses suggested that this 
conjugation was formed via an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of 
hApg12 and Lys-130 of hApg5. These findings indicate that the Apg12 system is 
well conserved and may function in autophagy also in human cells.
