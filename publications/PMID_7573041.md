Golgi complex.

The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL) is a multisystem disorder 
affecting the lens, kidney, and CNS. The predicted amino acid sequence of the 
OCRL gene, OCRL-1, was used to develop antibodies against the OCRL-1 protein. 
Western blot analysis using affinity-purified serum against the amino terminus 
of the OCRL-1 gene product (ocrl-1) demonstrates a single protein of 105 kD in 
fibroblasts of a normal individual that is absent in fibroblasts of an OCRL 
patient who lacks OCRL-1 transcript. A single protein with the same 
electrophoretic mobility is found by western analysis in various human cultured 
cell lines, and approximately the same size protein is also found in all mouse 
tissues tested. Northern analysis of various human and mouse tissues demonstrate 
that OCRL-1 transcript is expressed in nearly all tissues examined. By 
immunofluorescence, the ocrl-1 antibody stains a juxtanuclear region in normal 
fibroblast cells, while no specific staining is evident in the OCRL patient who 
produces no transcript. Colocalization of the ocrl-1 protein to the Golgi 
complex was demonstrated using a known monoclonal antibody against a 
Golgi-specific coat protein, beta-COP (beta coatomer protein).
