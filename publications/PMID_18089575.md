yFACT (heterodimers of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt16-Pob3 combined with Nhp6) 
binds to and alters the properties of nucleosomes. The essential function of 
yFACT is not disrupted by deletion of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of Spt16 or by 
mutation of the middle domain of Pob3, but either alteration makes yeast cells 
sensitive to DNA replication stress. We have determined the structure of the 
Spt16 NTD and find evidence for a conserved potential peptide-binding site. 
Pob3-M also contains a putative binding site, and we show that these two sites 
perform an overlapping essential function. We find that yFACT can bind the 
N-terminal tails of some histones and that this interaction is important for 
yFACT-nucleosome binding. However, neither the Spt16 NTD nor a key residue in 
the putative Pob3-M-binding site was required for interactions with histone N 
termini or for yFACT-mediated nucleosome reorganization in vitro. Instead, both 
potential binding sites interact functionally with the C-terminal docking domain 
of the histone H2A. yFACT therefore appears to make multiple contacts with 
different sites within nucleosomes, and these interactions are partially 
redundant with one another. The docking domain of H2A is identified as an 
important participant in maintaining stability during yFACT-mediated nucleosome 
reorganization, suggesting new models for the mechanism of this activity.
