The D7 proteins are highly expressed in the saliva of hematophagous Nematocera 
and bind biogenic amines and eicosanoid compounds produced by the host during 
blood feeding. These proteins are encoded by gene clusters expressing forms 
having one or two odorant-binding protein-like domains. Here we examine 
functional diversity within the D7 group in the genus Anopheles and make 
structural comparisons with D7 proteins from culicine mosquitoes in order to 
understand aspects of D7 functional evolution. Two domain long form (D7L) and 
one domain short form (D7S) proteins from anopheline and culicine mosquitoes 
were characterized to determine their ligand selectivity and binding pocket 
structures. We previously showed that a D7L protein from Anopheles stephensi, of 
the subgenus Cellia, could bind eicosanoids at a site in its N-terminal domain 
but could not bind biogenic amines in its C-terminal domain as does a D7L1 
ortholog from the culicine species Aedes aegypti, raising the question of 
whether anopheline D7L proteins had lost their ability to bind biogenic amines. 
Here we find that D7L from anopheline species belonging to two other subgenera, 
Nyssorhynchus and Anopheles, can bind biogenic amines and have a structure much 
like the Ae. aegypti ortholog. The unusual D7L, D7L3, can also bind serotonin in 
the Cellia species An. gambiae. We also show through structural comparisons with 
culicine forms that the biogenic amine binding function of single domain D7S 
proteins in the genus Anopheles may have evolved through gene conversion of 
structurally similar proteins, which did not have biogenic amine binding 
capability. Collectively, the data indicate that D7L proteins had a biogenic 
amine and eicosanoid binding function in the common ancestor of anopheline and 
culicine mosquitoes, and that the D7S proteins may have acquired a biogenic 
amine binding function in anophelines through a gene conversion process.
