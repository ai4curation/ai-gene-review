The Candida albicans CSH3 gene encodes a functional and structural homologue of 
Shr3p, a yeast protein that is specifically required for proper uptake and 
sensing of extracellular amino acids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A Candida 
csh3delta/csh3delta null mutant has a reduced capacity to take up amino acids, 
and is unable to switch morphologies on solid and in liquid media in response to 
inducing amino acids. CSH3/csh3delta heterozygous strains display normal amino 
acid induced morphological switching. However, although heterozygous cells 
apparently sense and properly react to amino acid induced signals they cannot 
take up amino acids at wild-type rates. Strikingly, both CSH3/csh3delta 
heterozygous and csh3delta/csh3delta homozygous strains are unable to 
efficiently mount virulent infections in a mouse model. The haploinsufficiency 
phenotypes indicate that both CSH3 alleles contribute to maintain high-capacity 
amino acid uptake in wild-type strains. These results strongly suggest that C. 
albicans cells use amino acids, presumably as nitrogen sources, during growth in 
mammalian hosts.
