Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) belongs to a family of 
IGF-binding proteins. Humanin is a peptide known to bind residues 215-232 of 
mature IGFBP-3 in the C-terminal region of the protein. This region of IGFBP-3 
was shown earlier to bind certain glycosaminoglycans including hyaluronan (HA). 
Here, we characterized the binding affinities of the IGFBP-3 protein and peptide 
(215-KKGFYKKKQCRPSKGRKR-232) to HA and to humanin and found that HA binds with a 
weaker affinity to this region than does humanin. Either HA or humanin could 
bind to this IGFBP-3 segment, but not simultaneously. The HA receptor, CD44, 
blocked HA binding to IGFBP-3 but had no effect on binding of humanin to either 
IGFBP-3 or its peptide. Upon incubation of HA with CD44 and either IGFBP-3 
protein or peptide, humanin was effective at binding and sequestering IGFBP-3 or 
peptide, thereby enabling access of CD44 to HA. We show that IGFBP-3 and humanin 
in the medium of A549 lung cancer cells can immunoprecipitate in a complex. 
However, the fraction of IGFBP-3 in the medium that is able to bind HA was not 
complexed with humanin suggesting that HA binding to the 215-232 segment renders 
it inaccessible for binding to humanin. Moreover, while the cytotoxic effects of 
IGFBP-3 on cell viability were reversed by humanin, blocking HA-CD44 interaction 
with an anti-CD44 antibody in combination with IGFBP-3 did not have an additive 
negative effect on cell viability suggesting that IGFBP-3 exerts its cytotoxic 
effects on cell survival through a mechanism that depends on HA-CD44 
interactions.
