Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is involved in a wide range of 
functions in the nucleus. However, a substantial amount of PCNA is also present 
in the cytoplasm, although their function is unknown. Here we show, through 
Far-Western blotting and mass spectrometry, that PCNA is associated with several 
cytoplasmic oncoproteins, including elongation factor, malate dehydrogenase, and 
peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. Surprisingly, PCNA is also associated with six 
glycolytic enzymes that are involved in the regulation of steps 4-9 in the 
glycolysis pathway.
