## Abstract

An Escherichia coli protein consisting of a domain homologous to FK506-binding 
proteins (FKBP) and a new metal binding motif.

Initially detected as a persistent contaminant in immobilized metal affinity 
chromatography of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, a 196-amino acid 
protein was isolated, cloned, overexpressed, and characterized. It consists of 
two domains, of which the first (146 amino acids) shows some homology to the 
FK506-binding proteins. The second domain (50 amino acids) is extremely rich in 
potentially metal-binding amino acids, such as histidine, cysteine, and acidic 
amino acids. The protein binds Ni2+ and Zn2+ tightly with 1:1 stoichiometry, 
Cu2+ and Co2+ with lower affinity, and Mn2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ hardly 
at all.
