A novel centrosome protein, TCC52, was identified as a cancer-testis (CT) 
antigen. The TCC52 gene was tissue-restricted in normal tissues but highly 
expressed in lung cancer tissues and some cancer cell lines. Immunoglobulin G 
antibody specific to TCC52 was detected in serum samples from patients with 
prostate cancer (59.4%, 69/116), cholangiocarcinoma (17.6%, 6/34), laryngeal 
cancer (8%, 8/100) and lung cancer (5.6%, 4/71) in patients, rather than from 
healthy donors. Based on its restricted expression pattern and immunogenicity in 
some types of tumor, TCC52, as a novel CT antigen, would be a promising 
candidate for cancer immunotherapy.
