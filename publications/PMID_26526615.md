Caspase-3-mediated p65 cleavage is believed to suppress nuclear factor-kappa B 
(NF-κB)-mediated anti-apoptotic transactivation in cells undergoing apoptosis. 
However, only a small percentage of p65 is cleaved during apoptosis, not in 
proportion to the dramatic reduction in NF-κB transactivation. Here we show that 
the p65(1-97) fragment generated by Caspase-3 cleavage interferes with ribosomal 
protein S3 (RPS3), an NF-κB "specifier" subunit, and selectively retards the 
nuclear translocation of RPS3, thus dampening the RPS3/NF-κB-dependent 
anti-apoptotic gene expression. Our findings reveal a novel cell fate 
determination mechanism to ensure cells undergo programed cell death through 
interfering with RPS3/NF-κB-conferred anti-apoptotic transcription by the 
fragment from partial p65 cleavage by activated Caspase-3.
