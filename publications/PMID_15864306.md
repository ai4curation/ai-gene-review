Lumbar disc disease (LDD) is caused by degeneration of intervertebral discs of 
the lumbar spine. One of the most common musculoskeletal disorders, LDD has 
strong genetic determinants. Using a case-control association study, we 
identified a functional SNP (1184T --> C, resulting in the amino acid 
substitution I395T) in CILP, which encodes the cartilage intermediate layer 
protein, that acts as a modulator of LDD susceptibility. CILP was expressed 
abundantly in intervertebral discs, and its expression increased as disc 
degeneration progressed. CILP colocalized with TGF-beta1 in clustering 
chondrocytes and their territorial matrices in intervertebral discs. CILP 
inhibited TGF-beta1-mediated induction of cartilage matrix genes through direct 
interaction with TGF-beta1 and inhibition of TGF-beta1 signaling. The 
susceptibility-associated 1184C allele showed increased binding and inhibition 
of TGF-beta1. Therefore, we conclude that the extracellular matrix protein CILP 
regulates TGF-beta signaling and that this regulation has a crucial role in the 
etiology and pathogenesis of LDD. Our study also adds to the list of connective 
tissue diseases that are associated with TGF-beta.
