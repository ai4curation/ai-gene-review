Selective ubiquitin-dependent autophagy plays a pivotal role in the elimination 
of protein aggregates, assemblies, or organelles and counteracts the 
cytotoxicity of proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Following 
substrate ubiquitylation, the cargo is delivered to autophagosomes involving 
adaptors like human p62 that bind ubiquitin and the autophagosomal 
ubiquitin-like protein Atg8/LC3; however, whether similar pathways exist in 
lower eukaryotes remained unclear. Here, we identify by a screen in yeast a new 
class of ubiquitin-Atg8 adaptors termed CUET proteins, comprising the 
ubiquitin-binding CUE-domain protein Cue5 from yeast and its human homolog 
Tollip. Cue5 collaborates with Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase, and the corresponding 
yeast mutants accumulate aggregation-prone proteins and are vulnerable to polyQ 
protein expression. Similarly, Tollip depletion causes cytotoxicity toward polyQ 
proteins, whereas Tollip overexpression clears human cells from Huntington's 
disease-linked polyQ proteins by autophagy. We thus propose that CUET proteins 
play a critical and ancient role in autophagic clearance of cytotoxic protein 
aggregates.
