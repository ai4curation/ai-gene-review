Anaphase-promoting complex (APC), a ubiquitin ligase, controls both sister 
chromatid separation and mitotic exit. The APC is activated in mitosis and G1 by 
CDC20 and CDH1, and inhibited by the checkpoint protein MAD2, a specific 
inhibitor of CDC20. We show here that a MAD2 homolog MAD2B also inhibits APC. In 
contrast to MAD2, MAD2B inhibits both CDH1-APC and CDC20-APC. This inhibition is 
targeted to CDH1 and CDC20, but not directly to APC. Unlike MAD2, whose 
interaction with MAD1 is required for mitotic checkpoint control, MAD2B does not 
interact with MAD1, suggesting that MAD2B may relay a different cellular signal 
to APC.
