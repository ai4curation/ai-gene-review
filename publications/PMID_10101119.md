The Wilms' Tumour gene WT1 has important functions during development. Knock-out 
mice were shown to have defects in the urogenital system and to die at embryonic 
day E13.5, probably due to heart failure. Using a lacZ reporter gene inserted 
into a YAC construct, we demonstrate that WT1 is expressed in the early 
proepicardium, the epicardium and the subepicardial mesenchymal cells (SEMC). 
Lack of WT1 leads to severe defects in the epicardial layer and a concomitant 
absence of SEMCs, which explains the pericardial bleeding and subsequent 
embryonic death observed in Wt1 null embryos. We further show that a 
human-derived WT1 YAC construct is able to completely rescue heart defects, but 
only partially rescues defects in the urogenital system. Analysis of the 
observed hypoplastic kidneys demonstrate a continuous requirement for WT1 during 
nephrogenesis, in particular, in the formation of mature glomeruli. Finally, we 
show that the development of adrenal glands is also severely affected in 
partially rescued embryos. These data demonstrate a variety of new functions for 
WT1 and suggest a general requirement for this protein in the formation of 
organs derived from the intermediate mesoderm.
