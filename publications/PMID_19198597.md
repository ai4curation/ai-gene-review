Export of messenger RNA from the transcription site in the nucleus and mRNA 
targeting to the translation site in the cytoplasm are key regulatory processes 
in protein synthesis. In yeast, the mRNA-binding proteins Nab2p and Nab4p/Hrp1p 
accompany transcripts to their translation site, where the karyopherin Kap104p 
mediates both their dissociation from the mRNA and their transport back into the 
nucleus. We found that Kap104p localized to the distal bud tip and the bud neck 
during cell division, resulting in a localized release of translation-competent 
mRNA and increased protein synthesis in the emerging daughter cell. Temporally 
and spatially coordinated localization of Kap104p is a new mechanism for the 
asymmetric distribution of protein synthesis in dividing cells.
