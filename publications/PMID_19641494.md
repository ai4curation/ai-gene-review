Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NADPH oxidase function as defence and 
signalling molecules related to innate immunity and various cellular responses. 
The activation of NADPH oxidase in response to plasma membrane receptor 
activation depends on the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic oxidase subunits, their 
translocation to membranes and the assembly of all NADPH oxidase components. 
Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a prominent stimulus of ROS production, but the 
molecular mechanisms by which TNF activates NADPH oxidase are poorly understood. 
Here we identify riboflavin kinase (RFK, formerly known as flavokinase) as a 
previously unrecognized TNF-receptor-1 (TNFR1)-binding protein that physically 
and functionally couples TNFR1 to NADPH oxidase. In mouse and human cells, RFK 
binds to both the TNFR1-death domain and to p22(phox), the common subunit of 
NADPH oxidase isoforms. RFK-mediated bridging of TNFR1 and p22(phox) is a 
prerequisite for TNF-induced but not for Toll-like-receptor-induced ROS 
production. Exogenous flavin mononucleotide or FAD was able to substitute fully 
for TNF stimulation of NADPH oxidase in RFK-deficient cells. RFK is 
rate-limiting in the synthesis of FAD, an essential prosthetic group of NADPH 
oxidase. The results suggest that TNF, through the activation of RFK, enhances 
the incorporation of FAD in NADPH oxidase enzymes, a critical step for the 
assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase.
