Apoptotic cells trigger immune tolerance in engulfing phagocytes. This poorly 
understood process is believed to contribute to the severe immunosuppression and 
increased susceptibility to nosocomial infections observed in critically ill 
sepsis patients. Extracellular high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an important 
mediator of both sepsis lethality and the induction of immune tolerance by 
apoptotic cells. We have found that HMGB1 is sensitive to processing by 
caspase-1, resulting in the production of a fragment within its N-terminal 
DNA-binding domain (the A-box) that signals through the receptor for advanced 
glycation end products (RAGE) to reverse apoptosis-induced tolerance. In a 
two-hit mouse model of sepsis, we show that tolerance to a secondary infection 
and its associated mortality were effectively reversed by active immunization 
with dendritic cells treated with HMGB1 or the A-box fragment, but not a 
noncleavable form of HMGB1. These findings represent a novel link between 
caspase-1 and HMGB1, with potential therapeutic implications in infectious and 
inflammatory diseases.
