Sorting nexin 9 (SNX9, also referred to as SH3PX1) is a binding partner for the 
non-receptor and Cdc42-associated kinase (ACK) in Drosophila and mammals. ACK1 
is known to bind clathrin and influence EGF receptor endocytosis. SNX9 comprises 
an N-terminal Src homology domain 3 (SH3), a central PHOX homology (PX) domain, 
and a carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil region. In order to investigate SNX9 further 
we have made use of a novel in vivo biotinylation system to label various 
GST-SH3 domains and perform blot overlays, thereby identifying synaptojanin-1 as 
a partner for SNX9. Biotinylated SH3 domains were also used for specific 
identification of target proline-rich sequences in synaptojanin and ACK1 on 
synthetic peptides arrays. Direct assessment of SH3 binding efficiencies at 
different positions within the extensive proline-rich regions of these proteins 
were thus determined. While SNX9 targets a number of sequences within the 
proline-rich regions of synaptojanin, a single site was identified in human 
ACK1. By testing the association of various truncations of ACK1 with SNX9 we 
confirmed the dominant SNX9 binding domain in human ACK1 (residues 920-955). In 
the presence of SNX9 we find that synaptojanin is able to colocalize with 
distinct ACK1 containing vesicles, indicating that this tyrosine kinase is 
linked to many components involved in vesicle dynamics including clathrin, AP2 
and synaptojanin-1.
