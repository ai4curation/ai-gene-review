Glycogen synthase, a key enzyme in the regulation of glycogen synthesis by 
insulin, is controlled by multisite phosphorylation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 
(GSK-3) phosphorylates four serine residues in the COOH terminus of glycogen 
synthase. Phosphorylation of one of these residues, Ser(640) (site 3a), causes 
strong inactivation of glycogen synthase. In previous work, we demonstrated in 
cell models that site 3a can be phosphorylated by an as yet unidentified protein 
kinase (3a-kinase) distinct from GSK-3. In the present study, we purified the 
3a-kinase from rabbit skeletal muscle and identified one constituent polypeptide 
as HAN11, a WD40 domain protein with unknown function. Another polypeptide was 
identified as DYRK1A, a member of the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylated 
and regulated protein kinase (DYRK) family. Two isoforms of DYRK, DYRK1A and 
DYRK1B, co-immunoprecipitate with HAN11 when coexpressed in COS cells indicating 
that the proteins interact in mammalian cells. Co-expression of DYRK1A, DYRK1B, 
or DYRK2 with a series of glycogen synthase mutants with Ser/Ala substitutions 
at the phosphorylation sites in COS cells revealed that protein kinases cause 
phosphorylation of site 3a in glycogen synthase. To confirm that DYRKs directly 
phosphorylate glycogen synthase, recombinant DYRK1A, DYRK2, and glycogen 
synthase were produced in bacterial cells. In the presence of Mg-ATP, both DYRKs 
inactivated glycogen synthase by more than 10-fold. The inactivation correlated 
with phosphorylation of site 3a in glycogen synthase. These results indicate 
that protein kinase(s) from the DYRK family may be involved in a new mechanism 
for the regulation of glycogen synthesis.
