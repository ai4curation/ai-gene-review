The peptide hormones ACTH, MSHs, β-lipotropin (β-LPH), and β-endorphin are all 
derived from the precursor molecule proopiomelanocortin (POMC). Using confocal 
laser microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy in human pituitary gland, we 
demonstrate a peroxisomal localization of β-endorphin and β-LPH in cells 
expressing the peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette-transporter adrenoleukodystrophy 
protein (ALDP). The peroxisomal localization of β-LPH and β-endorphin was not 
restricted to the pituitary gland but was additionally found in other human 
tissues that express high levels of ALDP, such as dorsal root ganglia, adrenal 
cortex, distal tubules of kidney, and skin. In contrast to the peptide hormones 
β-LPH and β-endorphin, which are derived from the C terminus of POMC, the 
N-terminal peptides ACTH, α-MSH, and γ-MSH were never detected in peroxisomes. 
This novel peroxisomal localization of β-endorphin and β-LPH in ALDP-positive 
cells was confirmed by costaining with ALDP and the peroxisomal marker catalase. 
Moreover, peroxisomal sorting of β-LPH could be modeled in HeLa cells by ectopic 
expression of a POMC variant, modified to allow cleavage and release of β-LPH 
within the secretory pathway. Although β-LPH and β-endorphin were only 
associated with peroxisomes in cells that normally express ALDP, the transporter 
activity of ALDP is not necessary for the peroxisomal localization, as 
demonstrated in tissues of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy patients lacking 
functional ALDP. It remains to be elucidated whether and how the peroxisomal 
localization of POMC-derived hormones has a role in the endocrine dysfunction of 
peroxisomal disease.
