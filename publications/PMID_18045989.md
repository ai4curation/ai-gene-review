The Golgi apparatus (GA) of mammalian cells is positioned in the vicinity of the 
centrosome, the major microtubule organizing center of the cell. The 
significance of this physical proximity for organelle function and cell cycle 
progression is only beginning to being understood. We have identified a novel 
function for the GA protein, GM130, in the regulation of centrosome morphology, 
position and function during interphase. RNA interference-mediated depletion of 
GM130 from five human cell lines revealed abnormal interphase centrosomes that 
were mispositioned and defective with respect to microtubule organization and 
cell migration. When GM130-depleted cells entered mitosis, they formed 
multipolar spindles, arrested in metaphase, and died. We also detected aberrant 
centrosomes during interphase and multipolar spindles during mitosis in ldlG 
cells, which do not contain detectable GM130. Although GA proteins have been 
described to regulate mitotic centrosomes and spindle formation, this is the 
first report of a role for a GA protein in the regulation of centrosomes during 
interphase.
