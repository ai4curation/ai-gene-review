BACKGROUND: Regulatory T cells have been proposed to play an important role in 
regulating allergic inflammation. The transcription factor Foxp3 is a master 
switch gene that controls the development and function of natural and adaptive 
CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T (T(R)) cells. In human subjects loss-of-function 
Foxp3 mutations trigger lymphoproliferation, autoimmunity, and intense allergic 
inflammation in a disease termed immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy 
enteropathy-X-linked syndrome.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the evolution and attributes of allergic 
inflammation in mice with a targeted loss-of-function mutation in the murine 
Foxp3 gene that recapitulates a known disease-causing human Foxp3 mutation.
METHODS: Foxp3 mutant mice were generated by means of knock-in mutagenesis and 
were analyzed for histologic, immunologic, and hematologic abnormalities. The 
role of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (Stat6) in disease 
pathogenesis was analyzed by using Stat6 and Foxp3 double-mutant mice.
RESULTS: Foxp3 mutant mice developed an intense multiorgan inflammatory response 
associated with allergic airway inflammation, a striking hyperimmunoglobulinemia 
E, eosinophilia, and dysregulated T(H)1 and T(H)2 cytokine production in the 
absence of overt T(H)2 skewing. Concurrent Stat6 deficiency reversed the 
hyperimmunoglobulinemia E and eosinophilia and delayed mortality, which is 
consistent with a pathogenic role for allergic inflammation in Foxp3 deficiency.
CONCLUSION: Allergic dysregulation is a common and fundamental consequence of 
loss of CD4(+)CD25(+) T(R) cells caused by Foxp3 deficiency in different 
species. Abnormalities affecting T(R) cells might contribute to a variety of 
allergic diseases.
