TRAIL selectively kills diseased cells in vivo, spurring interest in this death 
ligand as a potential therapeutic. However, many cancer cells are resistant to 
TRAIL, suggesting the mechanism mediating TRAIL-induced apoptosis is complex. 
Here we identify PACS-2 as an essential TRAIL effector, required for killing 
tumor cells in vitro and virally infected hepatocytes in vivo. PACS-2 is 
phosphorylated at Ser437 in vivo, and pharmacologic and genetic studies 
demonstrate Akt is an in vivo Ser437 kinase. Akt cooperates with 14-3-3 to 
regulate the homeostatic and apoptotic properties of PACS-2 that mediate TRAIL 
action. Phosphorylated Ser437 binds 14-3-3 with high affinity, which represses 
PACS-2 apoptotic activity and is required for PACS-2 to mediate trafficking of 
membrane cargo. TRAIL triggers dephosphorylation of Ser437, reprogramming PACS-2 
to promote apoptosis. Together, these studies identify the phosphorylation state 
of PACS-2 Ser437 as a molecular switch that integrates cellular homeostasis with 
TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
