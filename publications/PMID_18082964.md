The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway modulates growth, 
proliferation and cell survival in diverse tissue types and plays specialized 
roles in the nervous system including influences on neuronal polarity, dendritic 
branching and synaptic plasticity. The tumor-suppressor phosphatase with tensin 
homology (PTEN) is the central negative regulator of the PI3K pathway. Germline 
PTEN mutations result in cancer predisposition, macrocephaly and benign 
hamartomas in many tissues, including Lhermitte-Duclos disease, a cerebellar 
growth disorder. Neurological abnormalities including autism, seizures and 
ataxia have been observed in association with inherited PTEN mutation with 
variable penetrance. It remains unclear how loss of PTEN activity contributes to 
neurological dysfunction. To explore the effects of Pten deficiency on neuronal 
structure and function, we analyzed several ultra-structural features of 
Pten-deficient neurons in Pten conditional knockout mice. Using Golgi stain to 
visualize full neuronal morphology, we observed that increased size of nuclei 
and somata in Pten-deficient neurons was accompanied by enlarged caliber of 
neuronal projections and increased dendritic spine density. Electron microscopic 
evaluation revealed enlarged abnormal synaptic structures in the cerebral cortex 
and cerebellum. Severe myelination defects included thickening and unraveling of 
the myelin sheath surrounding hypertrophic axons in the corpus callosum. Defects 
in myelination of axons of normal caliber were observed in the cerebellum, 
suggesting intrinsic abnormalities in Pten-deficient oligodendrocytes. We did 
not observe these abnormalities in wild-type or conditional Pten heterozygous 
mice. Moreover, conditional deletion of Pten drastically weakened synaptic 
transmission and synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses between CA3 and CA1 
pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. These data suggest that Pten is involved 
in mechanisms that control development of neuronal and synaptic structures and 
subsequently synaptic function.

Discussion

Pten function has been studied in multiple tissue types through tissue-specific knock-out mice, showing roles for Pten in proliferation, survival and cell size regulation, depending on the context ( Sulis and Parsons, 2003 , Chow and Baker, 2006 ). As a negative regulator of PI3K signaling, Pten loss of function is often associated with constitutive activation of downstream effectors in this pathway including the serine-threonine kinases Akt and mTor. A number of in vitro studies have shown specific specialized functions for PI3K signaling in aspects of neuronal development including neurite growth, growth cone dynamics, axon specification and dendritic arborization ( Sanchez et al., 2001 , Menager et al., 2004 , Jaworski et al., 2005 , Jiang et al., 2005 , Kumar et al., 2005 , Laurino et al., 2005 , Chadborn et al., 2006 ). While these studies demonstrate a critical role for this pathway in neuronal development, they employ exogenous growth factor stimulation with knock-down of endogenous proteins, or constitutively active or inactive mutants. In vivo analysis of conditional knock-out mice reveals the effects of pathway deregulation in the context of physiological growth factor signaling. Several distinct brain-specific conditional knock-out models have shown hypertrophy of nuclei and somata of Pten-deficient neurons ( Backman et al., 2001 , Groszer et al., 2001 , Kwon et al., 2001 , Marino et al., 2002 , Fraser et al., 2004 ).

Electron microscopic detection of high ribosome density in hypertrophic Pten-deficient neurons and increased nucleolar size is consistent with our previous report that hypertrophy of Pten-deficient neurons required signaling through the rapamycin-sensitive mTor complex ( Kwon et al., 2003 ), which functions in part to increase production of translational machinery ( Ruggero and Pandolfi, 2003 , Fingar and Blenis, 2004 , Ruggero and Sonenberg, 2005 ). Numerous reports have indicated a role for mTor in synaptic plasticity mediated at least in part through regulation of localized protein translation in dendrites ( Tang et al., 2002 , Cammalleri et al., 2003 , Si et al., 2003 , Takei et al., 2004 , Gong et al., 2006 ).

The increase in spine number and alterations in synaptic structure in Pten cKO brain could be a generalized hypertrophic effect on the cell, or reflect a specific role for Pten signaling in synaptic function. In Drosophila, overexpression of PI3K or AKT induced the formation and the maintenance of supernumerary synapses in developing motor neurons and mature projection neurons respectively. However, increasing neuronal size via the epidermal growth factor did not affect synapse number or morphology, suggesting that size regulation and synaptic regulation are distinct processes influenced by the PI3K pathway ( Martin-Pena et al., 2006 ). Similar to our observations, work by Kwon et al. ( Kwon et al., 2006 ) supports a direct role of Pten expression in maintaining normal synapse structure. In this study, loss of Pten expression in a subset of differentiated neurons in the cerebral cortex and dentate gyrus resulted in hypertrophic axons and dendrites and significant enlargement of presynaptic terminals, which contained multiple synaptic densities and large numbers of synaptic vesicles. Evaluation of PI3K signaling in cultured hippocampal neurons also showed that combined activation of Ras and PI3K induced increased dendritic complexity while constitutively activated forms of PI3K or Akt caused increased dendritic size and disrupted dendritic shape in the absence of altered Ras signaling ( Kumar et al., 2005 ). The tuberous sclerosis complex normally functions to inhibit mTor activity, and this inhibition can be relieved by PI3K activation through activated Akt. Loss of Tsc1 or Tsc2 caused increased soma size and elongated dendritic spines with enlarged bulbous heads in hippocampal pyramidal neurons ( Tavazoie et al., 2005 ), reminiscent of the alterations observed in Pten cKO mice.

What is the functional consequence of the hypertrophic and abnormal synaptic structures resulting from mutation of different PI3K pathway effectors? Electrophysiological recordings from Pten cKO hippocampus indicated strong deficits in synaptic transmission, most likely due to compromised postsynaptic function. This is consistent with the structural abnormalities in postsynaptic densities revealed by electron microscopy. No general defects in presynaptic neurotransmitter release as measured by PPR were observed in Pten cKO hippocampus. Analysis of hippocampal slice cultures with conditional deletion of Tsc1 similarly showed normal presynaptic function, with no detectable abnormalities in PPR or frequency of spontaneous miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs), but abnormal postsynaptic function, shown by increased spontaneous mEPSC amplitude and an altered ratio of currents mediated by AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors ( Tavazoie et al., 2005 ). Overexpression of PI3K in Drosophila abdominal larval motor neurons also showed a functional consequence with enhanced spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter release ( Martin-Pena et al., 2006 ). Pten cKO mice showed a number of profound structural defects in multiple cell types, therefore the functional abnormalities that we observed in synaptic transmission and plasticity may not be exclusively associated with cell-autonomous defects in the function of Pten-deficient neurons. Recent studies showed that conditional deletion of Tsc1, which was achieved using the same GFAP-cre transgenic mouse used in our study, caused impaired LTP and was associated with learning deficits. While these deficiencies in hippocampal function may have been the result of abnormal glutamate homeostasis in Tsc1 cKO mice, it is possible that multiple cell types lacking Tsc1 contributed to the phenotype ( Zeng et al., 2007 ). Future studies directing Pten loss exclusively in neurons will allow the elucidation of which abnormalities are cell-autonomous. However, we clearly demonstrated that Pten deletion in brain has profound functional and structural consequences.

We also observed dramatic changes in myelination in both the corpus callosum and white matter tracts of the cerebellum in Pten cKO mice compared to controls. Enlarged oligodendrocyte somata were accompanied by increased thickness of the myelin sheath and myelin decompaction. Several lines of evidence indicate a role for PI3K signaling in myelination. IGF-1, which activates PI3K signaling, promotes the expression of myelin-associated protein markers in cultured Schwann cells. Further, introduction of a constitutively active Akt into transplanted nerve segments showed increased myelination in an in vivo transplant model ( Ogata et al., 2004 ). Mice lacking the gene encoding the endopeptidase Bace-1 showed delayed myelination and decreased myelin thickness associated with a decrease in cleaved neuregulin and a resulting decrease in phosphorylated Akt ( Hu et al., 2006 ).

The abnormal myelination by Pten-deficient oligodendrocytes ensheathing axons from neurons that still express Pten in the cerebellum strongly suggests that Pten loss caused cell-autonomous defects in oligodendrocytes. However, multiple factors could contribute to the profound oligodendrocyte hypertrophy and defects in myelination observed in the corpus callosum of Pten cKO mice where Pten was deleted in multiple cell types. The loss of Pten in neurons significantly increased the full neuronal structure, which could lead to increased myelin, as size and length of the dendrites and axon is known to influence myelination ( Michailov et al., 2004 ). Also, the progressive increase in caliber of Pten-null axons could create increased pressure on the myelin sheath, potentially resulting in decompaction. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that astrocytes have the capacity to promote myelination by reacting to the action potential firing of neighboring neurons. The action potential from a neuron triggers the astrocytes to release leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which stimulates myelination by the oligodendrocytes ( Ishibashi et al., 2006 ). Perhaps hypertrophic astrocytes observed in Pten cKO brain ( Fraser et al., 2004 ) are capable of producing more LIF, leading to increased myelination.

Myelin defects in the cerebellar white matter tracts strongly suggest intrinsic defects in Pten-deficient oligodendrocytes. In this region, cre activity is observed in oligodendrocytes which are hypertrophic in Pten cKO mice and associated with increased myelin thickness and decompaction. However, the axons of the Purkinje cells, mossy fibers and climbing fibers, found in the white matter tracts, are similar in size compared with the controls due to the absence of cre activity and the retention of Pten expression in these cell types. This indicates the potential for a cell autonomous defect in myelination with the loss of Pten in oligodendrocytes. Selective deletion of Pten in oligodendrocytes would be ideal to further determine the precise role that Pten plays in myelination.

The changes in cellular ultra-structure of Pten cKO mice illustrate the spectrum of abnormalities that could occur in the absence of functional PTEN in the brain. Observations of ultrastructural defects in cerebella of Pten cKO mice are consistent with changes observed in human Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD), which occurs in patients with inherited PTEN mutation. In the hypertrophic lesions in LDD, the wild-type PTEN allele is inactivated resulting in the complete loss of functional PTEN ( Eng and Peacocke, 1998 ). Electron microscopy and Golgi stain analyses demonstrated hypertrophic granule neurons accompanied by increases in ribosomes, similar to our results. The dendritic spines were thickened and pre-synaptic terminals were enlarged and contained dense regions of synaptic vesicles ( Gessaga, 1980 , Reznik and Schoenen, 1983 , Marano et al., 1988 , Ferrer et al., 1990 , Hair et al., 1992 ). Other defects observed in Pten cKO brains reflect the spectrum of abnormalities that may result from complete Pten inactivation in different cell populations. Neurological defects in patients with inherited PTEN germline mutations may be due in part to second hits in the remaining wild-type allele in subpopulations of cells. The severity of disease would be associated with the number and types of cells that acquire the second mutation in the normal PTEN allele and the developmental stage at which such a somatic mutation is acquired. The stochastic nature of this event likely contributes to the highly variable neurological phenotype associated with inherited germline PTEN mutations.
