Calcineurin mediates repression of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase-4 (PMCA4) 
expression in neurons, whereas c-Myb is known to repress PMCA1 expression in 
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Here, we describe a novel mouse VSMC line 
(MOVAS) in which 45Ca efflux rates decreased 50%, fura 2-AM-based intracellular 
Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) increased twofold, and real-time RT-PCR and 
Western blot revealed a approximately 40% decrease in PMCA4 expression levels 
from G0 to G1/S in the cell cycle, where PMCA4 constituted approximately 20% of 
total PMCA protein. Although calcineurin activity increased fivefold as MOVAS 
progressed from G0 to G1/S, inhibition of this increase with either BAPTA or 
retroviral transduction with peptide inhibitors of calcineurin (CAIN), or its 
downstream target nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (VIVIT), had no 
effect on the repression of PMCA4 mRNA expression at G1/S. By contrast, 
Ca2+-independent activity of the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II 
(CaMK-II) increased eightfold as MOVAS progressed from G0 to G1/S, and treatment 
with an inhibitor of CaMK-II (KN-93) or transduction of a c-Myb-neutralizing 
antibody significantly alleviated the G1/S-associated repression of PMCA4. These 
data show that G1/S-specific PMCA4 repression in proliferating VSMC is brought 
about by c-Myb and CaMK-II and that calcineurin may regulate cell 
cycle-associated [Ca2+]i through alternate targets.
