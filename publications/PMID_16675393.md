CNS deletion of Pten in the mouse has revealed its roles in controlling cell 
size and number, thus providing compelling etiology for macrocephaly and 
Lhermitte-Duclos disease. PTEN mutations in individuals with autism spectrum 
disorders (ASD) have also been reported, although a causal link between PTEN and 
ASD remains unclear. In the present study, we deleted Pten in limited 
differentiated neuronal populations in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of 
mice. Resulting mutant mice showed abnormal social interaction and exaggerated 
responses to sensory stimuli. We observed macrocephaly and neuronal hypertrophy, 
including hypertrophic and ectopic dendrites and axonal tracts with increased 
synapses. This abnormal morphology was associated with activation of the 
Akt/mTor/S6k pathway and inactivation of Gsk3beta. Thus, our data suggest that 
abnormal activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in specific neuronal populations can 
underlie macrocephaly and behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of certain 
features of human ASD.

## Full Text

Introduction

P hosphatase and ten sin homolog on chromosome ten ( PTEN ) is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in many human cancers ( Ali et al., 1999 ). Individuals with germline PTEN mutations are prone to tumors but also display brain disorders, including macrocephaly, seizure, Lhermitte-Duclos disease, and mental retardation ( Waite and Eng, 2002 ). PTEN mutations also have been reported in autistic individuals with macrocephaly ( Butler et al., 2005 ; Goffin et al., 2001 ; Zori et al., 1998 ).

PTEN has lipid phosphatase activity against the 3′ phosphate of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate ( Maehama and Dixon, 1998 ). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) catalyzes the reverse of this reaction, resulting in AKT activation. Upon activation, AKT phosphorylates a diverse spectrum of substrates, including tuberous sclerosis complex 2 ( TSC2 ) gene product tuberin, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and the proapoptotic protein BAD ( Luo et al., 2003 ).

Abnormalities in many components of the PI3K/AKT pathway have been associated with diverse brain disorders. For example, inactivating mutations in PTEN or activating mutations in PI3K are found in malignant brain tumors ( Ali et al., 1999 ; Broderick et al., 2004 ), low AKT level is associated with schizophrenia ( Emamian et al., 2004 ), and individuals with TSC mutations have CNS disorders, including autism ( Wiznitzer, 2004 ). The PI3K/AKT pathway has also been linked to activity-dependent plasticity processes in the brain. Activation of the pathway was found in the amygdala in fear-conditioned rats ( Lin et al., 2001 ). Components of the mTOR/S6K pathway, downstream of PI3K/Akt, are present in synapses and mediate synaptic plasticity through local protein synthesis ( Tang et al., 2002 ).

Pten null mice die during embryogenesis, and heterozygotes are prone to tumors in the prostate, endometrium, and lymphoid system ( Stiles et al., 2004 ). Conditional loss of Pten can have differing consequences depending on the cell type or its state of differentiation. Consistent with the frequent association of somatic mutations with cancer, Pten deletion in dividing T-lymphocytes, mammary epithelial cells, neural stem cells, and astrocytes induced hyperplasia ( Fraser et al., 2004 ; Groszer et al., 2001 ; Li et al., 2002 ; Suzuki et al., 2001 ). Pten deletion in granule neurons, cardiomyocytes, and the cerebellum induced cellular hypertrophy ( Crackower et al., 2002 ; Kwon et al., 2001 ). In primary neuron cultures, the PI3K pathway regulates cell survival, neurite growth, and dendritic arborization ( Crowder and Freeman, 1998 ; Jaworski et al., 2005 ; Klesse and Parada, 1998 ; Markus et al., 2002 ). The above studies manipulated either mitotic cells or immature neurons. The in vivo role of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway has been poorly studied in mature neurons where specialized properties including synapses and polarity are already established.

In the present study, we employed a Neuron-specific enolase ( Nse ) promoter-driven cre transgenic mouse line, in which cre activity is confined to discrete mature neuronal populations in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus ( Kwon et al., 2006 ). The resulting conditional Pten mutant mice develop macrocephaly due to crespecific neuronal hypertrophy. We identified abnormal dendritic and axonal growth and synapse number. The mice exhibit altered social behavior and inappropriate responses to sensory stimuli.

Discussion

Through the use of cre-mediated recombination, we have deleted Pten and thus deregulated the PI3K pathway in subsets of differentiated neurons in the cortex and hippocampus.
