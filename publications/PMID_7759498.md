Mutations in the ETR1 gene of the higher plant Arabidopsis confer insensitivity 
to ethylene, indicating a role for the gene product in ethylene signal 
perception and transduction. The ETR1 gene product has an amino-terminal 
hydrophobic domain and a carboxyl-terminal domain showing homology to the 
two-component signal transduction proteins of bacteria. We report here that in 
both its native Arabidopsis and when transgenically expressed in yeast, the ETR1 
protein is isolated from membranes as a dimer of 147 kDa. Treatment with the 
reducing agent dithiothreitol converted the dimer to a monomer of 79 kDa, 
indicative of a disulfide linkage between monomers. Expression of truncated 
versions of ETR1 in yeast confirmed that the high molecular mass form is a 
homodimer and demonstrated that the amino-terminal region of ETR1 is necessary 
and sufficient for this dimerization. Site-directed mutagenesis of two cysteines 
near the amino terminus of ETR1 prevented formation of the covalently linked 
dimer in yeast, consistent with a role in disulfide bond formation. These data 
indicate that ETR1 may use a dimeric mechanism of signal transduction in a 
manner similar to its bacterial counterparts but with the additional feature of 
a disulfide bond between monomers.
