The biological functions of the Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) are suggested to be 
pleiotropic since this signal transducer is ubiquitously expressed and coupled 
to a variety of cytokine receptors. Consequently, mice that are deficient in 
this tyrosine kinase were reported to die shortly after birth. To facilitate 
studies that address the biological and molecular functions of JAK1 during 
postnatal development, we performed gene targeting in embryonic stem cells and 
generated a Cre/lox-based conditional knockout mouse model. Expression of Cre 
recombinase in the germline converted the Jak1 conditional knockout allele 
(Jak1fl ) into a null allele (Jak1- ) that when subsequently crossed into 
homozygosity led to a complete absence of the JAK1 protein in developing 
embryos. JAK1 deficient embryos were visibly smaller starting at E15.5. Newborn 
pups exhibited signs of apnea and died within hours after birth. The examination 
of fibroblasts from conditional knockout embryos and their littermate wildtype 
controls expressing JAK1 showed that lack of this Janus kinase resulted in an 
impaired tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the downstream Signal 
Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) 1, 3, and 6. JAK1 
conditional knockout mice will be an invaluable tool to study cytokine signaling 
during normal development and disease progression in adult animals.
