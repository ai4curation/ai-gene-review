Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a genetically heterogeneous group of 
lysosomal diseases that collectively compose the most common Mendelian form of 
childhood-onset neurodegeneration. It is estimated that ∼8% of individuals 
diagnosed with NCL by conservative clinical and histopathologic criteria have 
been ruled out for mutations in the nine known NCL-associated genes, suggesting 
that additional genes remain unidentified. To further understand the genetic 
underpinnings of the NCLs, we performed whole-exome sequencing on DNA samples 
from a Mexican family affected by a molecularly undefined form of NCL 
characterized by infantile-onset progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME), vision 
loss, cognitive and motor regression, premature death, and prominent NCL-type 
storage material. Using a recessive model to filter the identified variants, we 
found a single homozygous variant, c.550C>T in KCTD7, that causes a p.Arg184Cys 
missense change in potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 7 
(KCTD7) in the affected individuals. The mutation was predicted to be 
deleterious and was absent in over 6,000 controls. The identified variant 
altered the localization pattern of KCTD7 and abrogated interaction with 
cullin-3, a ubiquitin-ligase component and known KCTD7 interactor. Intriguingly, 
murine cerebellar cells derived from a juvenile NCL model (CLN3) showed 
enrichment of endogenous KCTD7. Whereas KCTD7 mutations have previously been 
linked to PME without lysosomal storage, this study clearly demonstrates that 
KCTD7 mutations also cause a rare, infantile-onset NCL subtype designated as 
CLN14.
