The largest of the gene clusters coding for proteins involved in methanol 
oxidation is the cluster mxaFJGIR(S)ACKLDEHB. Disruption of most of these genes 
leads to lack of growth on methanol. The previous results showed that the mutant 
lacking MxaD grows on methanol although at a low rate. This is explained by the 
low rate of methanol oxidation by whole cells. The specific activity of methanol 
dehydrogenase (MDH) is higher in the mutant but its electron acceptor 
(cytochrome c(L)) is unchanged. Using the purified proteins, it was shown that 
the rate of interaction of MDH and cytochrome c(L) was higher in the wild-type 
MDH containing some MxaD proteins, which was absent in the mutant MDH. It is 
suggested that the gene mxaD codes for the 17-kDa periplasmic protein that 
directly or indirectly stimulates the interaction between MDH and cytochrome 
c(L); its absence leads to a lower rate of respiration with methanol and 
therefore a lower growth rate on this substrate.
