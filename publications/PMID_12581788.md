We performed a yeast interactive screen in search of p19(ARF)-binding partners 
and have isolated a novel serine rich protein that is assigned to human 
chromosome 4q35 and mouse chromosome 8. The human and mouse proteins showed 
84.2% homology. It is named CARF for its role as a putative Collaborator of ARF. 
CARF binds to both mouse and human ARF proteins. Its expression was detected in 
a variety of human tissues. The cDNA was expressed in bacteria and mammalian 
cells as a soluble and predominantly nucleoplasmic protein, respectively. CARF 
is a novel binding partner of ARF and might be involved in its p53-dependent or 
-independent tumor suppressive functions.
