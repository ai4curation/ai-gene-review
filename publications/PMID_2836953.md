The human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor complementary DNA was 
cloned and expressed by transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fibroblasts. 
The ability of CHO cells expressing the human receptor complementary DNA 
(CHO-HR5) to interact with different recombinant forms of PDGF (AA and BB 
homodimers) was tested. Both forms of PDGF bind to the transfected receptor, 
stimulate the receptor tyrosine kinase activity, and elicit a mitogenic response 
in a manner that was indistinguishable from the responses of Balb/c 3T3 cells to 
AA and BB forms of PDGF can be attributed to a single type of receptor and show 
that the AA form, like the BB form, is a true mitogen.
