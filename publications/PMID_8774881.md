Transforming growth factor-beta TGF-beta is the prototype for a family of 
extracellular proteins that affect cell proliferation and tissue 
differentiation. TGF-beta-related factors, including BMP-2/4, Dpp and activin, 
act through two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors which can form a 
heteromeric complex. However, the mechanism of signal transduction by these 
receptors is largely unknown. In Drosophila, Mad is required for signalling by 
Dpp. We have isolated complementary DNAs for four human Mad homologues, one of 
which, hMAD-4, is identical to DPC-4, a candidate tumour suppressor. hMAD-3 and 
-4 synergized to induce strong ligand-independent TGF-beta-like responses. When 
truncated at their carboxy termini, hMAD-3 and -4 act as dominant-negative 
inhibitors of the normal TGF-beta response. The activity of hMAD-3 and -4 was 
regulated by the TGF-beta receptors, and hMAD-3 but not hMAD-4 was 
phosphorylated and associated with the ligand-bound receptor complex. These 
results define hMAD-3 and -4 as effectors of the TGF-beta response and 
demonstrate a function for DPCA-4/hMAD-4 as a tumour suppressor.
