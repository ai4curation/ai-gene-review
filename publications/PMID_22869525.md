These changes were rescued following administration of IGFBP-2. These findings present a novel mechanism for coordinate regulation of IGFBP-2 and IGF-I signaling functions that lead to stimulation of VSMC proliferation.

INTRODUCTION

IGFBP-2 is a member of a highly conserved family of six insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins (IGFBPs) that modulate IGF-I actions, and they play an important role in the regulation of several cellular processes ( 13 ). IGFBP-2 is the second most abundant IGFBP and is expressed in several tissues, including blood vessels and the skeleton ( 19 ). IGFBP-2 can prevent IGF-I binding to its receptor ( 13 , 22 ), but it also modulates cellular functions independently of IGF-I binding ( 16 ). These include regulation of growth hormone (GH)-stimulated growth ( 15 ), cell proliferation and adhesion ( 43 ). Although these effects do not require IGFBP-2 binding to IGF-I, earlier studies did not exclude the possibility that IGF-I receptor activation was required for IGFBP-2 to alter these events. Previous work had shown that IGFBP-2 binds to cell surface proteoglycans (PGs) and glycosaminoglycans, but a functionally active cell surface IGFBP-2 receptor that links IGFBP-2 binding to a signaling pathway has not been identified ( 21 , 42 ). Furthermore, a functionally active receptor has not been identified for any of the members of the IGFBP family.

Recently, an association between IGFBP-2 expression and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) has been reported ( 9 ). PTEN is a lipid phosphatase that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), thereby preventing AKT activation. Global deletion of IGFBP-2 in mice resulted in increased levels of PTEN in aorta and osteoblasts. IGFBP-2 −/− osteoblasts had reduced cell growth and cell survival. The addition of IGFBP-2 to cells derived from these mice suppressed PTEN ( 9 ), and this response was unique to IGFBP-2. The activation of PTEN is regulated by protein-protein interactions, cellular localization, and posttranslational modifications ( 25 , 38 , 44 ). Most studies have analyzed the effect of serine/threonine phosphorylation on PTEN activity, but some have reported that tyrosine phosphorylation downregulates PTEN activity ( 5 , 25 , 38 ).

Receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase β (RPTPβ) is a proteoglycan that is localized in the cell surface ( 47 ). RPTPβ is inactivated via ligand-induced dimerization that occurs when it binds to heparin-binding domain (HBD)-containing growth factors, such as midkine and pleiotrophin (PTN) ( 1 , 3 , 26 ). Following PTN binding to RPTPβ, its phosphatase activity is inhibited ( 1 , 26 , 30 ). IGFBP-2 contains two putative hHBDs: a C-terminal HBD which shares sequence similarity with HBDs in other HBD-containing IGFBPs, and a unique HBD (referred to hereafter as uHBD) which is not present in other IGFBPs. Since IGFBP-2 contains HBDs, we determined if IGFBP-2 could bind to RPTPβ, if binding was mediated through the uHBD, and if it led to inactivation of its catalytic activity. We further investigated the mechanism by which this response was linked to enhanced IGF-I signaling and its biological actions.

DISCUSSION

IGF-I stimulates multiple anabolic functions, and many of its actions are modulated by IGF binding proteins that are present in all extracellular fluids ( 13 , 19 ). High concentrations of IGFBPs can inhibit IGF-I-stimulated actions ( 16 ) by blocking IGF-I binding to its receptor ( 13 , 15 ). In contrast, IGFBP-2 concentrations that do not exceed those of IGF-I can enhance the ability of IGF-I to stimulate VSMC proliferation ( 4 , 22 ). Knockdown of IGFBP-2 in zebra fish resulted in attenuation of vascular development, but IGFBP-2 overexpression inhibited cell growth ( 12 ). IGFBP-2 also stimulates endometrial epithelial cell proliferation, and both IGF-dependent and independent mechanisms have been postulated ( 50 ). IGFBP-2 stimulates cell migration and differentiation ( 14 , 29 ), and the ability of IGFBP-2 to bind extracellular matrix proteins is related to its ability to stimulate cell migration ( 8 ). However, a major limitation of these studies has been the inability to identify a cell surface transmembrane receptor that is linked to a specific signaling pathway by which IGFBP-2 or other forms of IGFBPs function to enhance IGF-I actions.

Since IGFBP-2 contains an uHBD which binds to cell surface proteoglycans ( 41 , 42 ) and our recent studies had shown that this domain was required for IGFBP-2 to enhance the effect of IGF-I on osteoblast proliferation ( 21 ), we focused on a cell surface protein proteoglycan that could bind to HBDs within growth factors and which had been shown to transduce a signal. Based on these criteria we selected RPTPβ for analysis, since its binding to the mitogen pleiotrophin ( 26 ) leads to increased proliferation in endothelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, and bone marrow precursor cells ( 30 , 36 ). IGFBP-2 bound to RPTPβ through its uHBD, and this led to RPTPβ dimerization and inhibition of RPTPβ phosphatase activity. That this interaction was mediated through the uHBD was shown by mutagenesis. The IGFBP-2 uHBD mutant did not bind to RPTPβ, and it did not induce dimerization. Interestingly, this effect also required the addition of IGF-I, and association of IGFBP-2 with RPTPβ and dimerization of RPTPβ were not detected unless IGF-I was present. Inhibition of IGF-I binding to IGFBP-2 had no effect, which led us to conclude that the IGF-I receptor was required. This was confirmed by demonstrating that inhibition of IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase activity inhibited RPTPβ dimerization. Importantly, VSMC expressing this mutant form of IGFBP-2 had a marked reduction in IGF-I-stimulated cell migration and proliferation. These findings strongly suggest that the responses to IGFBP-2 and IGF-I are coordinated and that IGF-I binding to its receptor is required for IGFBP-2-induced RPTPβ dimerization.

To determine the mechanism by which IGFBP-2 binding to RPTPβ altered IGF-I actions, we focused on RPTPβ tyrosine phosphatase activity ( 3 , 26 ). IGFBP-2- and IGF-I-stimulated RPTPβ dimerization was associated with inhibition of its phosphatase activity. To determine the signaling protein whose function was likely to be altered in response to RPTPβ inhibition, we focused on PTEN, since cells derived from IGFBP-2 −/− mice had increased PTEN and decreased IGF-I-stimulated AKT activation ( 21 ). Inhibition of RPTPβ was associated with increased PTEN tyrosine phosphorylation and decreased PTEN activity. That these changes in response to IGFBP-2 were mediated through RPTPβ was confirmed by showing that RPTPβ knockdown eliminated the ability of IGFBP-2 to enhance IGF-I-stimulated PTEN tyrosine phosphorylation and AKT activation. These findings support the conclusion that the effect of IGFBP-2 to enhance IGF-I-stimulated AKT activation in VSMC is mediated directly through inhibition of RPTPβ dephosphorylation of PTEN. To prove that PTEN is a physiological substrate of RPTPβ, an RPTPβ substrate-trapping mutant was constructed and expressed in VSMC. Cells expressing this mutant showed RPTPβ-PTEN association, which was undetectable in the cells expressing wild-type RPTPβ. In vitro dephosphorylation experiments showed that RPTPβ, but not RPTPα or PTPB1, dephosphorylated phospho-PTEN. Similarly, knockdown of RPTPβ or expression of the inactive RPTPβ mutant abrogated the ability of IGF-I and IGFBP-2 to regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of PTEN and AKT activation. These results clearly demonstrate that PTEN is a substrate of RPTPβ. RPTPβ has other intracellular targets, including β-catenin and β-adducens, the tyrosine kinase Fyn, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, and membrane-associated guanylate kinase PDZ domain-containing protein (MAGI) ( 11 ). Whether any of these targets are involved in mediating the effect of IGF-I on VSMC was not investigated in this study. The importance of these observations for VSMC function was documented in vivo by demonstrating that IGFBP-2 −/− mice had increased RPTPβ activity, decreased PTEN tyrosine phosphorylation, impaired AKT activation, and attenuated IGF-I-stimulated VSMC replication in the aorta. These changes were reversed by administration of IGFBP-2. These results strongly suggest that coordination of these molecular events is essential for IGF-I to stimulate an optimal proliferative response in arterial smooth muscle. Our results also showed that this mechanism is also applicable in other cell types, including porcine endothelial cells and murine preosteoblasts.

Our results clearly indicate the importance of the uHBD for mediating the association of IGFBP-2 with RPTPβ. Other investigators have shown that IGFBP-2 promotes IGF-I-stimulated neuroblastoma cell replication through the uHBD ( 42 ). These investigators attributed this change to the ability of IGFBP-2 to bind to extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Other forms of IGFBPs contain an HBD in their C terminus, but IGFBP-2 contains 2 HBDs, and the HBD within the linker region is unique to IGFBP-2 ( 13 ). Our results show that the uHBD accounts for the ability of IGFBP-2 to bind to RPTPβ and that a mutant form of IGFBP-2 in which the C-terminal HBD was altered had no reduction in RPTPβ association. However, IGFBP-2 binding to RPTPβ through the uHBD alone was not adequate to stimulate RPTPβ dimerization, which also required IGF-I. Since our IGFBP-2 mutant that did not bind IGF-I had no change in its ability to induce RPTPβ dimerization and inhibition of IGF-I receptor kinase activity impaired RPTPβ dimerization, we conclude that the IGF-I receptor stimulates an event that leads to conformational change in RPTPβ and that this is required for optimal IGFBP-2 binding and stimulation of dimerization.

PTEN is a central negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signal transduction cascade. It is known that the predominant lipid phosphatase substrate is PIP3, which can activate AKT signaling, leading to increased cell migration, proliferation, and motility. A previous study concluded that enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling induced by sodium orthovanadate treatment was attributable to inactivation of PTEN mediated by increased PTEN tyrosine phosphorylation ( 51 ). In addition, inhibition of PTEN tyrosine phosphorylation has been correlated with PTEN activation ( 32 , 38 ). Our current study obtained similar results which showed that IGF-I induced a significant increase in PTEN tyrosine phosphorylation that correlates with a reduction in PTEN activity in SMC, porcine endothelial cells, and preosteoblasts (MC3T3 cells). Our studies did not identify the tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates PTEN, and the role of tyrosine kinases in regulating PTEN activity requires further investigation. We have identified Src kinases as important for mediating IGF-I's effects in SMC ( 23 ), and future studies should investigate the possibility that Src or a Src family kinase can directly tyrosine phosphorylate PTEN ( 35 ).

Our findings with mice support a role for IGFBP-2 in enhancing the effects of IGF-I on VSMC proliferation. IGF-I is a potent VSMC mitogen, and it stimulates VSMC growth in response to vascular injury ( 34 ). Strategies that target IGF-I have successfully inhibited the VSMC proliferation response in experimental animals ( 27 , 54 ). Recent studies have emphasized the role of PTEN in regulating VSMC proliferation ( 18 , 31 ). Our findings suggest that inhibition of interaction between IGFBP-2 and RPTPβ could provide an important mechanism for enhancing PTEN expression in VSMC, thus limiting VSMC proliferation and atherosclerotic lesion progression.

IGFBP-2 contains multiple domains that may function coordinately to enhance IGF-I actions. In studies published recently, we demonstrated that IGF-I binding to the IGF binding domain within IGFBP-2 is required for osteoclastogenesis even though it is not required for osteoblast or VSMC proliferation ( 10 ). Our results show that a peptide containing the sequence of the C-terminal HBD domain had no effect on IGFBP-2 binding to RPTPβ, leading us to conclude that this domain does not influence interaction of IGFBP-2 with RPTPβ. This HBD is present in four members of the IGFBP family, and it can bind to cell surface proteoglycans. Therefore, it is possible that this HBD could bind to a distinct receptor and thereby modulate the responses of other cell types to IGF-I. Based on these observations, future studies should focus on cell-type-specific differences in the response to IGFBP-2 and on how these multidomain interactions are coordinated to modulate IGF-I actions.

Our findings may have major importance for understanding the role of other forms of IGFBPs in modulating IGF-I actions. All of the IGFBPs are multidomain proteins, and several contain domains other than the IGF-binding domain that have been shown to have specific functions. A recent report showed that IGFBP-2 nuclear localization regulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) synthesis ( 2 ). Our studies have shown that IGF-I can stimulate VEGF synthesis ( 28 ), and it is possible that IGF-I modulation of IGFBP-2 activity participates in this process. It is clear that the multiplicity of members of this family, each of which contains multiple domains, affords the opportunity to determine if other members of the IGFBP family mediate alterations in IGF-I actions that are distinct from those that are mediated by IGFBP-2. The results of this study suggest that the identification of specific receptors for other forms of IGFBPs would greatly enhance the ability of investigators to determine the mechanism by which these proteins function to alter tissue responses to IGF-I.
