By inactivating the gene for L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, a key enzyme in 
ascorbic acid synthesis, we have generated mice that, like humans, depend on 
dietary vitamin C. Regular chow, containing about 110 mg/kg of vitamin C, is 
unable to support the growth of the mutant mice, which require L-ascorbic acid 
supplemented in their drinking water (330 mg/liter). Upon withdrawal of 
supplementation, plasma and tissue ascorbic acid levels decreased to 10-15% of 
normal within 2 weeks, and after 5 weeks the mutants became anemic, began to 
lose weight, and die. Plasma total antioxidative capacities were approximately 
37% normal in homozygotes after feeding the unsupplemented diet for 3-5 weeks. 
As plasma ascorbic acid decreased, small, but significant, increases in total 
cholesterol and decreases in high density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed. 
The most striking effects of the marginal dietary vitamin C were alterations in 
the wall of aorta, evidenced by the disruption of elastic laminae, smooth muscle 
cell proliferation, and focal endothelial desquamation of the luminal surface. 
Thus, marginal vitamin C deficiency affects the vascular integrity of mice 
unable to synthesize ascorbic acid, with potentially profound effects on the 
pathogenesis of vascular diseases. Breeding the vitamin C-dependent mice with 
mice carrying defined genetic mutations will provide numerous opportunities for 
systematic studies of the role of antioxidants in health and disease.
