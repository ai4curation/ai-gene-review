To identify apoptotic targets of HtrA2/Omi, we purified recombinant HtrA2/Omi 
and its catalytically inactive S306A mutant. Lysates of human Jurkat T 
lymphocytes incubated with either wild-type recombinant HtrA2/Omi or the S306A 
mutant were screened using the gel-free COFRADIC approach that isolates peptides 
covering the N-terminal parts of proteins. Analysis of the 1162 proteins 
identified by mass spectrometry yielded 15 HtrA2/Omi substrates of potential 
physiological relevance together holding a total of 50 cleavage sites. Several 
processing events were validated by incubating purified recombinant HtrA2/Omi 
with in vitro translated substrates or with Jurkat cell lysates. In addition, 
the generated set of cleavage sites was used to assess the protein substrate 
specificity of HtrA2/Omi. Our results suggest that HtrA2/Omi has a rather narrow 
cleavage site preference and that cytoskeletal proteins are prime targets of 
this protease.
