The poly(ADP-ribose)polymerases Tankyrase 1/2 (TNKS/TNKS2) catalyze the covalent 
linkage of ADP-ribose polymer chains onto target proteins, regulating their 
ubiquitylation, stability, and function. Dysregulation of substrate recognition 
by Tankyrases underlies the human disease cherubism. Tankyrases recruit specific 
motifs (often called RxxPDG "hexapeptides") in their substrates via an 
N-terminal region of ankyrin repeats. These ankyrin repeats form five domains 
termed ankyrin repeat clusters (ARCs), each predicted to bind substrate. Here we 
report crystal structures of a representative ARC of TNKS2 bound to targeting 
peptides from six substrates. Using a solution-based peptide library screen, we 
derive a rule-based consensus for Tankyrase substrates common to four 
functionally conserved ARCs. This 8-residue consensus allows us to rationalize 
all known Tankyrase substrates and explains the basis for cherubism-causing 
mutations in the Tankyrase substrate 3BP2. Structural and sequence information 
allows us to also predict and validate other Tankyrase targets, including Disc1, 
Striatin, Fat4, RAD54, BCR, and MERIT40.
