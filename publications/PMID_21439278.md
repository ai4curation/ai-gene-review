Abstract

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) regulate critical cell signaling pathways, yet the properties of their cognate ligands that influence receptor activation are not fully understood. There is great interest in parsing these complex ligand-receptor relationships using engineered proteins with altered binding properties. Here we focus on the interaction between two engineered epidermal growth factor (EGF) mutants and the EGF receptor (EGFR), a model member of the RTK superfamily. We found that EGF mutants with faster kinetic on-rates stimulate increased EGFR activation compared to wild-type EGF. These findings support previous predictions that faster association rates correlate with enhanced receptor activity.

1. Introduction

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a 53 amino-acid polypeptide that stimulates a variety of cellular processes, including proliferation, survival, and differentiation [ 1 ]. Binding of EGF to its receptor (EGFR, ErbB1) induces receptor dimerization, leading to activation of the receptor intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and initiation of pleiotropic downstream signaling pathways [ 2 ]. After activation, EGF ligand-receptor complexes are rapidly internalized and trafficked through the cell, where they are ultimately targeted for recycling or degradation [ 3 ]. Therefore, EGFR signaling potency is regulated by both ligand binding properties and receptor trafficking patterns [ 4 ]; however, understanding the interplay between these processes remains a significant challenge. Although some studies have found a correlation between EGF binding affinity and biological activity, recent findings have demonstrated that this trend is not always present [ 5 – 9 ]. Other subtleties of EGF-EGFR interactions, such as binding kinetics and pH sensitivity, can also influence the magnitude and duration of the signaling response. Computational modeling studies suggested the importance of binding on-rates to receptor activation [ 10 ], as the rapid internalization of EGFR can impose a limit on activation that is independent of binding off-rates [ 11 ]. Furthermore, the pH sensitivity of the EGF-EGFR interaction influences the fraction of internalized receptor that is recycled back to the cell surface for continued signaling [ 3 , 12 ].

To develop a molecular toolkit for studying EGF-EGFR interactions, we previously used combinatorial methods to engineer EGF mutants with four- to 30-fold increased receptor binding affinity [ 13 ]. Here, we selected two of these clones, mutant 28 (m28) and mutant 123 (m123) ( Table 1 ), for further characterization due to their high soluble expression levels in yeast. We showed that these mutants retain their binding specificities for EGFR compared to other ErbB family members, have stronger EGFR binding affinities resulting from increased kinetic on-rates, and interact with EGFR with different pH sensitivities. These unique binding properties translated into enhanced EGFR activation responses. To our knowledge this work is the first experimental validation of ligands with faster binding on-rates exhibiting increased receptor activation.

4. Discussion

We measured the EGFR binding affinities and kinetic rate constants of two previously identified EGF mutants, m28 and m123 [ 13 ]. We showed through cell surface measurements and SPR that m28 and m123 have increased binding affinity for EGFR predominantly due to increased kinetic on-rates. The increased association rates of m28 and m123 were surprising since both mutants were discovered by screening combinatorial libraries under equilibrium binding conditions, which typically isolates mutants with decreased dissociation rates. We showed that m28 and m123 elicited increased EGFR activation compared to EGFwt, as measured by phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase domain and receptor downregulation. Interestingly, m123 had stronger binding at low pH compared to m28 and EGFwt. This difference implied that m123 might induce more intracellular receptor degradation compared to m28, yet both mutants exhibited greater levels of EGFR downregulation compared to EGFwt, suggesting that cell surface binding events drive this biological response.

Because of its important biological role, there has been much interest in EGF mutants with enhanced cell signaling for applications in wound healing and regenerative medicine [ 16 , 17 ]. Previous attempts at engineering EGF [ 5 , 7 – 9 ] had mixed success, but highlighted the complex relationship between ligand binding and EGFR activation. While some studies concluded that receptor activation is directly proportional to equilibrium binding affinity [ 5 , 9 ], others found that equivalent or enhanced potency can be attained by EGF mutants with weaker receptor binding interactions than EGFwt [ 7 , 8 ]. Computational studies of cellular signaling and trafficking processes coupled to the activation of transmembrane receptors have attempted to explain these inconsistencies by highlighting the importance of receptor binding on-rates [ 10 , 18 ].

To our knowledge, our work represents the first experimental corroboration of the effects of increased ligand binding on-rates with enhanced receptor activation. We demonstrated that EGF mutants with faster association rates, but nearly equivalent dissociation rates, more strongly activated EGFR compared to EGFwt. Collectively, these studies suggest that while receptor activity is linked to ligand binding, the magnitude of the response can be altered solely by differences in the association rate of the interaction. Furthermore, these results suggest a general strategy for engineering ligands that stimulate enhanced receptor activity [ 19 ].

While m28 and m123 stimulate increased EGFR activation, this attribute may not correlate with enhanced agonistic potential, since increased EGFR activation and downregulation could result in decreased or unaffected biological outcomes due to signal attenuation [ 3 ]. This consideration is also coupled with unaltered (m28) or decreased (m123) pH binding sensitivities, which are expected to influence receptor recycling. In future studies, it will therefore be interesting to explore the effects of increased EGFR phosphorylation and downregulation on downstream signaling and biological processes such as cellular migration and proliferation.
