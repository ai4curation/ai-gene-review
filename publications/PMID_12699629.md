Eukaryotic telomerase contains a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and an 
RNA template component that are essential for telomerase catalytic activity and 
several other telomerase-associated factors of which only a few appear to be 
integral enzyme components [1-3]. The first essential telomerase protein 
identified was S. cerevisiae Est1p, whose deletion leads to ever-shorter 
telomeres despite the persistence of telomerase activity [4-6]. Extensive 
genetic and biochemical data show that Est1p, via its interaction with the 
telomerase RNA and telomere end DNA binding complex Cdc13p/Stn1p/Ten1p, promotes 
the ability of telomerase to elongate telomeres in vivo [7-22]. The 
characterization of Est1p homologs outside of yeast has not been documented. We 
report the characterization of two putative human homologs of Est1p, hEST1A and 
hEST1B. Both proteins specifically associated with telomerase activity in human 
cell extracts and bound hTERT in rabbit reticulocyte lysates independently of 
the telomerase RNA. Overproduction of hEST1A cooperated with hTERT to lengthen 
telomeres, an effect that was specific to cells containing telomerase activity. 
Like Est1p, hEST1A (but not hEST1B) exhibited a single-stranded telomere DNA 
binding activity. These results suggest that the telomerase-associated factor 
Est1p is evolutionarily conserved in humans.
