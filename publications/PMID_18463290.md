Activation of the MEK/ERK/Elk-signaling cascade is a mechanism for relaying 
mitogenic and stress stimuli for gene activation. MEK1 is the proximate kinase 
for activation of ERK1/2, and nuclear targeting of ERK1/2 is obligatory for Elk1 
transcriptional activity. Human biliverdin reductase (hBVR) is a recently 
described Ser/Thr/Tyr kinase in the MAPK insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 
(IGF1)-signaling cascade. Using 293A cells and in vitro experiments, we detail 
the formation of a ternary complex of MEK/ERK/hBVR, activation of MEK1 and 
ERK1/2 kinase activities by hBVR, and phosphorylation of hBVR by ERK1/2. hBVR is 
nearly as effective as IGF1 in activating ERK; intact hBVR ATP-binding domain is 
necessary for Elk1 activation, whereas protein-protein interaction is the basis 
for hBVR activation of MEK1 and ERK. The two MAPK docking consensus sequences 
present in hBVR, F(162)GFP and K(275)KRILHCLGL (C- and D-box, respectively), are 
ERK interactive sites; interaction at each site is critical for ERK/Elk1 
activation. Transfection with mutant hBVR-P(165) or peptides corresponding to 
the C- or D-box blocked activation of ERK by IGF1. Transfection with D-box 
mutant hBVR prevented the activation of ERK by wild-type protein and 
dramatically decreased Elk1 transcriptional activity. hBVR is a nuclear 
transporter of ERK; experiments with hBVR nuclear export signal (NES) and 
nuclear localization signal (NLS) mutants demonstrated its critical role in the 
nuclear localization of IGF-stimulated ERK for Elk1 activation. These findings, 
together with observations that si-hBVR blocked activation of ERK and Elk1 by 
IGF1 and prevented formation of ternary complex between MEK/ERK/hBVR, define the 
critical role of hBVR in ERK signaling and nuclear functions of the kinase.

Abstract

Activation of the MEK/ERK/Elk-signaling cascade is a mechanism for relaying mitogenic and stress stimuli for gene activation. MEK1 is the proximate kinase for activation of ERK1/2, and nuclear targeting of ERK1/2 is obligatory for Elk1 transcriptional activity. Human biliverdin reductase (hBVR) is a recently described Ser/Thr/Tyr kinase in the MAPK insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)-signaling cascade. Using 293A cells and in vitro experiments, we detail the formation of a ternary complex of MEK/ERK/hBVR, activation of MEK1 and ERK1/2 kinase activities by hBVR, and phosphorylation of hBVR by ERK1/2. hBVR is nearly as effective as IGF1 in activating ERK; intact hBVR ATP-binding domain is necessary for Elk1 activation, whereas protein–protein interaction is the basis for hBVR activation of MEK1 and ERK. The two MAPK docking consensus sequences present in hBVR, F 162 G FP and K 275 KR I L HC L G L (C- and D-box, respectively), are ERK interactive sites; interaction at each site is critical for ERK/Elk1 activation. Transfection with mutant hBVR-P 165 or peptides corresponding to the C- or D-box blocked activation of ERK by IGF1. Transfection with D-box mutant hBVR prevented the activation of ERK by wild-type protein and dramatically decreased Elk1 transcriptional activity. hBVR is a nuclear transporter of ERK; experiments with hBVR nuclear export signal (NES) and nuclear localization signal (NLS) mutants demonstrated its critical role in the nuclear localization of IGF-stimulated ERK for Elk1 activation. These findings, together with observations that si-hBVR blocked activation of ERK and Elk1 by IGF1 and prevented formation of ternary complex between MEK/ERK/hBVR, define the critical role of hBVR in ERK signaling and nuclear functions of the kinase.

Discussion

The primary structure of hBVR possesses an unprecedented array of consensus regulatory motifs, many of which are functional and account for the diversity of its roles in insulin/IGF1/MAPK signal-transduction pathways ( 1 , 5 , 6 ). Relying on the endogenous ERK, in this study, by disrupting consensus sequences of NES, NLS, C- and D-box ERK-binding domains, ATP-binding pocket, or ablating hBVR, we have assembled reliable evidence for two integrated mechanisms by which hBVR regulates ERK nuclear activity: One solely involves protein–protein interaction, whereas the other function requires both its kinase activity and binding.

We show that kinase-competent hBVR exerts control over the nuclear activity of the signaling pathway by functioning in the nuclear import/export of ERK. In doing so, hBVR alone can mimic functions that have been ascribed to several proteins. In this capacity, hBVR links the cytoplasmic events to nuclear processes that result in the induction of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Noteworthy, too, is the reductase activity of the enzyme that provides the sole source of bilirubin while rescuing the activity of enzymes and kinases that are inhibited by biliverdin, including that of HO-1. Bilirubin is an inhibitor of inflammatory responses and mitogen-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; activation of ERK1/2 by ROS is among the cell-signaling events that lead to the induction of the cytoprotective gene HO-1 ( 14 ) (see SI Text ).

hBVR, like the Drosophila KSR protein (kinase suppressor of Ras) ( 30 ) and the MEK partner 1 protein (MP1) ( 31 ), is an activator of MEK and, as suggested by our data, a partner in linking ERK to activation by MEK. hBVR functions upstream of ERK within the MEK/ERK module and interacts with both MEK and ERK to form a complex as is indicated by the observation that the cell lysate IPed with antibody to hBVR contained hBVR, MEK, and ERK; in the complex, hBVR functions as a scaffold. Although it is neither a substrate ( Fig. 2 b ), a substitute ( Fig. 3 b ), nor a kinase for MEK ( Fig. 2 c ), MEK activation of ERK is blocked by inhibitory si-hBVR ( Fig. 4 b ). As a scaffold, it appears that hBVR, by binding to the two proteins, places ERK in a position that allows its activation by MEK. This is not intended to suggest that the assembly is made only of MEK/ERK/hBVR. Furthermore, because inhibitors of MEK also inhibit Elk1-dependent transcription, the binding places hBVR parallel to MEK in the MAPK-signaling network.

In light of the present observations, the question may be raised as to why involvement of hBVR in the nucleus import and export of ERK was not uncovered in the course of previous studies. This, we suggest, reflects the fact that, although hBVR is ubiquitously present in tissues, it went undetected because of the unavailability of antibodies to hBVR for studies that primarily rely on the IP approach.

Downstream of ERK, hBVR shares certain structural similarities with Elk1 ( Fig. S1 ) by having two ERK-binding sites that allow high-affinity binding between ERK and its substrates. These are the D-box docking site, which is common to all MAPK substrates, and the second substrate binding site, FXFP, which is specific to ERK1/2 and is exposed to activated ERK ( 12 , 25 ). The two sites function additively, with the FXFP site imparting high-affinity binding to ERK. Our data suggest that the common denominator for the activity of hBVR in the cytosol and the nucleus is its high-affinity binding to ERK and the ability to exchange a second binding partner depending on cellular location. In the cytosol, hBVR is a component of a ternary complex with MEK/ERK; upon activation, ERK is released from MEK with the high-affinity hBVR/ERK complex entering the nucleus where a new ternary module of hBVR/ERK/Elk is formed. The proposal also is consistent with the following notion: There is no FXFP ERK docking site in MEK1, which would limit docking to the low-affinity D-domain of MEK. Upon ERK phosphorylation, the MEK/ERK complex dissociates, with MEK staying in the cytoplasm ( 19 ). The proposed mechanism is supported by the following data: ( i ) IP experiments demonstrate that hBVR antibodies coprecipitate the antigen together with MEK and ERK; ( ii ) in the presence of hBVR, there is a striking increase in the phosphorylation of Elk and activation of Elk1-dependent transcription; and ( iii ) si-hBVR hinders Elk1-dependent transcription activity. A schematic presentation of the findings is provided in Fig. 7 .

The present findings, together with previous data demonstrating the activation of PKCβII and PKCζ through protein–protein interaction with hBVR, independent of hBVR kinase activity ( 5 , 6 ), suggest that physical interaction among hBVR and components of the signaling network is an important mechanism for the integration and transmission of extracellular signals to stimulate transcriptional activity. Here we found that transfection with hBVR plasmid was as effective as IGF1 in stimulating ERK activation of Elk1 reporter activity ( Fig. 3 a and b ). That an inactive kinase functions as a scaffold molecule independent of kinase activity is not unprecedented. For example, KSR1 also possesses kinase activity, which is not relevant to its role as a MEK/ERK scaffold protein ( 30 ). Accordingly, we propose that the scaffolding and kinase functions may be more or less important depending on the cellular localization, but that both activities are essential for the full range of signaling activity.

In conclusion, the present study reveals the multidimensional input of hBVR in the regulation of extracellular-regulated MAPK signaling that encompasses functions attributed to several proteins and, as such, points to the likelihood of hBVR being a central component of signal transduction in mammalian cells.
