Atg101 is an essential component of the autophagy-initiating ULK complex in 
higher eukaryotes, but it is absent from the functionally equivalent Atg1 
complex in budding yeast. Here, we report the crystal structure of the fission 
yeast Atg101-Atg13 complex. Atg101 has a Hop1, Rev7 and Mad2 (HORMA) 
architecture similar to that of Atg13. Mad2 HORMA has two distinct conformations 
(O-Mad2 and C-Mad2), and, intriguingly, Atg101 resembles O-Mad2 rather than the 
C-Mad2-like Atg13. Atg13 HORMA from higher eukaryotes possesses an inherently 
unstable fold, which is stabilized by Atg101 via interactions analogous to those 
between O-Mad2 and C-Mad2. Mutational studies revealed that Atg101 is 
responsible for recruiting downstream factors to the autophagosome-formation 
site in mammals via a newly identified WF finger. These data define the 
molecular functions of Atg101, providing a basis for elucidating the molecular 
mechanisms of mammalian autophagy initiation by the ULK complex.
