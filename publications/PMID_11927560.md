We are using biochemical and genetic approaches to study Rtf1 and the Spt4-Spt5 
complex, which independently have been implicated in transcription elongation by 
RNA polymerase II. Here, we report a remarkable convergence of these studies. 
First, we purified Rtf1 and its associated yeast proteins. Combining this 
approach with genetic analysis, we show that Rtf1 and Leo1, a protein of unknown 
function, are members of the RNA polymerase II-associated Paf1 complex. Further 
analysis revealed allele-specific genetic interactions between Paf1 complex 
members, Spt4-Spt5, and Spt16-Pob3, the yeast counterpart of the human 
elongation factor FACT. In addition, we independently isolated paf1 and leo1 
mutations in an unbiased genetic screen for suppressors of a cold-sensitive spt5 
mutation. These genetic interactions are supported by physical interactions 
between the Paf1 complex, Spt4-Spt5 and Spt16-Pob3. Finally, we found that 
defects in the Paf1 complex cause sensitivity to 6-azauracil and diminished PUR5 
induction, properties frequently associated with impaired transcription 
elongation. Taken together, these data suggest that the Paf1 complex functions 
during the elongation phase of transcription in conjunction with Spt4-Spt5 and 
Spt16-Pob3.
