Low temperature induces a number of genes that encode the proteins promoting 
tolerance to freezing, mediated by ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways in 
plants. The cis-acting element called C/DRE is known to respond to low 
temperature independently of ABA action. To investigate the signalling and 
network of ABA-independent pathways, the transgenic Arabidopsis plants were 
generated containing several copies of the C/DRE derived from cor15a gene with a 
minimal promoter fused to a GUS reporter gene. The transgenic plants containing 
four copies of the C/DRE (4C/DRE-GUS) showed responsiveness to cold and drought 
treatments and were used for characterization of cold signalling and cross-talk. 
Cold-induced GUS expression was inhibited by okadaic acid at 1 nM, indicating 
that protein phosphatase 2A might act as a positive regulator. Light was shown 
to activate cold- and drought-induced GUS expression. Photo-reversibility of the 
GUS mRNA by red and far-red light with concomitant cold treatment suggests a 
role of phytochrome as a photoreceptor in mediating light signalling to activate 
the cold-induced gene expression through the C/DRE. Furthermore, GUS expression 
analysis in phyA or phyB or phyAphyB mutant backgrounds showed that phytochrome 
B is a primary photoreceptor responsible for the activation of cold-stress 
signalling in response to light. Light enhanced the induction kinetics of CBF1, 
2, and 3 encoding the cognate transcription factors, and cor15a, in a 
consecutive manner compared to the dark condition in the cold, suggesting that 
the connection point between cold and light signalling mediated by phytochrome 
is at a higher step than the expression of CBF genes.
