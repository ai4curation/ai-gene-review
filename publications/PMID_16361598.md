Detailed clinical, neuroradiological, histological, biochemical, and genetic 
investigations were undertaken in a child suffering from Leigh syndrome. The 
clinical symptoms started at age five months and led to a severe progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder causing epilepsy, psychomotor retardation, and 
tetraspasticity. Biochemical measurement of skeletal muscle showed a severe 
decrease in mitochondrial complex II. Sequencing of SDHA revealed compound 
heterozygosity for a nonsense mutation in exon 4 (W119X) and a missense mutation 
in exon 3 (A83V), both absent in normal controls. In six additional 
patients--five with Leigh or Leigh-like syndrome and one with neuropathy and 
ataxia associated with isolated deficiency of complex II--mutations in SDHA were 
not detected, indicating genetic heterogeneity.
