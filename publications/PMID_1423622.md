The solution structure of the tenth type III module of fibronectin has been 
determined using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The molecule has a fold 
similar to that of immunoglobulin domains, with seven beta strands forming two 
antiparallel beta sheets, which pack against each other. Both beta sheets 
contribute conserved hydrophobic residues to a compact core. The topology is 
more similar to that of domain 2 of CD4, PapD, and the extracellular domain of 
the human growth hormone receptor than to that of immunoglobulin C domains. The 
module contains an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence known to be involved in cell adhesion. 
This tripeptide is solvent exposed and lies on a conformationally mobile loop 
between strands F and G, consistent with its cell adhesion function.
