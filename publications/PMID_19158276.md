Epigenetic silencing of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 
1beta (IL-1beta) transcription occurs in blood leukocytes of animals and humans 
after the initiation of severe systemic inflammation (SSI). We previously 
reported that the epigenetic signature requires induction of NF-kappaB factor 
RelB, which directs histone H3K9 dimethylation, disrupts assembly of 
transcription activator NF-kappaB p65, and induces a sustained switch from the 
euchromatin to heterochromatin. Here, we report the novel findings that 
intracellular high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and nucleosome linker 
histone H1 protein are necessary components of endotoxin-mediated silencing of 
TNF-alpha in THP-1 human promonocytes. HMGB1 binds the TNF-alpha promoter during 
transcription silencing and promotes assembly of the repressor RelB. Depletion 
of HMGB1 by small interfering RNA results in dissociation of RelB from the 
promoter and partially restores TNF-alpha transcription. Histone H1, which 
typically displaces HMGB1 from nucleosomal DNA, also binds concomitantly with 
HMGB1 to the heterochromatin of the silenced TNF-alpha promoter. Combined 
knockdown of HMGB1 and H1 restores binding of the transcriptionally active 
NF-kappaB p65 and reestablishes TNF-alpha mRNA levels. Chromatin 
reimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that HMGB1 and H1 are likely 
recruited to TNF-alpha sequences independently and that their binding correlates 
with histone H3K9 dimethylation, as inhibition of histone methylation blocks 
HMGB1 and H1 binding. Moreover, HMGB1- and H1-mediated chromatin modifications 
are gene specific during endotoxin silencing in that they also bind and repress 
acute proinflammatory IL-1beta, while no binding nor repression of 
antiinflammatory IkappaBalpha is observed. Finally, we find that H1 and HMGB1 
bind to the TNF-alpha a promoter in human leukocytes obtained from patients with 
SSI. We conclude proinflammatory HMGB1 and structural nucleosome linker H1 
couple as a component of the epigenetic complex that silences acute 
proinflammatory TNF-alpha during the assembly of heterochromatin in the SSI 
phenotype.
