The strength of the DNA damage checkpoint critically influences cell fate, yet 
the mechanisms behind the fine tuning of checkpoint strength during the DNA 
damage response (DDR) are poorly understood. Here we show that Rad54B--a SNF2 
helicase-like DNA-repair protein--limits the strength of both the G1/S and G2/M 
checkpoints. We find that Rad54B functions as a scaffold for p53 degradation via 
its direct interaction with the MDM2-MDMX ubiquitin-ligase complex. During the 
early phases of the DDR, Rad54B is upregulated, thereby maintaining low 
checkpoint strength and facilitating cell cycle progression. Once the 
p53-mediated checkpoint is established, Rad54B is downregulated, and high 
checkpoint strength is maintained. Constitutive upregulation of Rad54B activity, 
which is frequently observed in tumours, promotes genomic instability because of 
checkpoint override. Thus, the scaffolding function of Rad54B dynamically 
regulates the maintenance of genome integrity by limiting checkpoint strength.
