TM9SF4 is a novel V-ATPase-interacting protein that modulates tumor pH 
alterations associated with drug resistance and invasiveness of colon cancer 
cells.

An inverted pH gradient across the cell membranes is a typical feature of 
malignant cancer cells that are characterized by extracellular acidosis and 
cytosol alkalization. These dysregulations are able to create a unique milieu 
that favors tumor progression, metastasis and chemo/immune-resistance traits of 
solid tumors. A key event mediating tumor cell pH alterations is an aberrant 
activation of ion channels and proton pumps such as (H+)-vacuolar-ATPase 
(V-ATPase). TM9SF4 is a poorly characterized transmembrane protein that we have 
recently shown to be related to cannibal behavior of metastatic melanoma cells. 
Here, we demonstrate that TM9SF4 represents a novel V-ATPase-associated protein 
involved in V-ATPase activation. We have observed in HCT116 and SW480 colon 
cancer cell lines that TM9SF4 interacts with the ATP6V1H subunit of the V-ATPase 
V1 sector. Suppression of TM9SF4 with small interfering RNAs strongly reduces 
assembly of V-ATPase V0/V1 sectors, thus reversing tumor pH gradient with a 
decrease of cytosolic pH, alkalization of intracellular vesicles and a reduction 
of extracellular acidity. Such effects are associated with a significant 
inhibition of the invasive behavior of colon cancer cells and with an increased 
sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of 5-fluorouracil. Our study shows for the 
first time the important role of TM9SF4 in the aberrant constitutive activation 
of the V-ATPase, and the development of a malignant phenotype, supporting the 
potential use of TM9SF4 as a target for future anticancer therapies.
