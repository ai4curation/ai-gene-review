Death receptor 5 (DR5) is a death domain-containing transmembrane receptor that 
triggers cell death upon binding to its ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing 
ligand (TRAIL), and a combination of TRAIL and agents that increase the 
expression of DR5 is expected to be a novel anticancer therapy. In this report, 
we demonstrate that the stress response gene ATF3 is required for endoplasmic 
reticulum stress-mediated DR5 induction upon zerumbone (ZER) and celecoxib (CCB) 
in human p53-deficient colorectal cancer cells. Both agents activated PERK-eIF2α 
kinases and induced the expression of activating transcription factor 4 
(ATF4)-CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein, which were 
remarkably suppressed by reactive oxygen species scavengers. In the absence of 
ATF3, the induction of DR5 mRNA and protein was abrogated significantly, and 
this was associated with reduced cell death by cotreatment of TRAIL with ZER or 
CCB. By contrast, exogenous expression of ATF3 caused a more rapid and elevated 
expression of DR5, resulting in enhanced sensitivity to apoptotic cell death by 
TRAIL/ZER or TRAIL/CCB. A reporter assay demonstrated that at least two ATF/cAMP 
response element motifs as well as C/EBP homologous protein motif at the 
proximal region of the human DR5 gene promoter were required for ZER-induced DR5 
gene transcription. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the 
role of ATF3 as an essential transcription factor for p53-independent DR5 
induction upon both ZER and CCB treatment, and this may be a useful biomarker 
for TRAIL-based anticancer therapy.
