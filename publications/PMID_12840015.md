Nuclear coactivator-62 kDa/Ski-interacting protein (NCoA62/SKIP) is a putative 
vitamin D receptor (VDR) and nuclear receptor coactivator protein that is 
unrelated to other VDR coactivators such as those in the steroid receptor 
coactivator (SRC) family. The mechanism through which NCoA62/SKIP functions in 
VDR-activated transcription is unknown. In the present study, we identified a 
nuclear localization sequence in the COOH terminus of NCoA62/SKIP and showed 
that NCoA62/SKIP was targeted to nuclear matrix subdomains. Chromatin 
immunoprecipitation studies revealed that endogenous NCoA62/SKIP associated in a 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-dependent manner with VDR target genes in ROS17/2.8 
osteosarcoma cells. A cyclic pattern of promoter occupancy by VDR, SRC-1, and 
NCoA62/SKIP was observed, with NCoA62/SKIP entering these promoter complexes 
after SRC-1. These studies provide strong support for the proposed role of 
NCoA62/SKIP as a VDR transcriptional coactivator, and they indicate that key 
mechanistic differences probably exist between NCoA62/SKIP and SRC coactivators. 
To explore potential mechanisms, NCoA62/SKIP-interacting proteins were purified 
from HeLa cell nuclear extracts and identified by mass spectrometry. The 
identified proteins represent components of the spliceosome as well as other 
nuclear matrix-associated proteins. Here, we show that a dominant negative 
inhibitor of NCoA62/SKIP (dnNCoA62/SKIP) interfered with appropriate splicing of 
transcripts derived from 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced expression of a growth 
hormone minigene cassette. Taken together, these data show that NCoA62/SKIP has 
properties that are consistent with those of nuclear receptor coactivators and 
with RNA spliceosome components, thus suggesting a potential role for 
NCoA62/SKIP in coupling VDR-mediated transcription to RNA splicing.
