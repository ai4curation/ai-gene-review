The cDNA encoding human cyclophilin from the Jurkat T-cell lymphoma line has 
been cloned by the expression cassette polymerase chain reaction and sequenced, 
and an expression vector has been constructed under control of the tac promoter 
for efficient expression in Escherichia coli. Active cyclophilin is produced at 
up to 40% of soluble cell protein, facilitating a one-column purification to 
homogeneity. Wild-type cyclophilin was characterized for binding of the potent 
immunosuppressant agent cyclosporin A (Kd = 46 nM) by tryptophan fluorescence 
enhancement and for inhibition (IC50 = 19 nM) of cyclophilin's peptidyl-prolyl 
cis-trans isomerase (rotamase) activity. With 
N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide as the substrate, recombinant human 
cyclophilin has a high catalytic efficiency; kcat/Km is 1.4 X 10(7) M-1.S-1 at 
10 degrees C. To test the prior suggestion that a cysteine residue may be 
essential for catalysis and immunosuppressant binding, the four cysteines at 
positions 52, 62, 115, and 161 were mutated individually to alanine and the 
purified mutant proteins were shown to retain full affinity for cyclosporin A 
and equivalent catalytic efficiency as a rotamase. Clearly the cysteines play no 
essential role in catalysis or cyclosporin A binding. These results rule out the 
recently proposed mechanism [Fischer, G., Wittmann-Liebold, B., Lang, K., 
Kiefhaber, T. & Schmid, F. X. (1989) Nature (London) 337, 476-478)] involving 
the formation of tetrahedral hemithioorthoamide. Whereas mechanisms that embody 
other tetrahedral intermediates may be operative, an alternative mechanism is 
considered that involves distortion of bound substrate with a twisted (90 
degrees) peptidyl-prolyl amide bond.
