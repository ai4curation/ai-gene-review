The survival motor neuron (SMN) protein forms the oligomeric core of a 
multiprotein complex that functions in spliceosomal snRNP biogenesis. Loss of 
function mutations in the SMN gene cause spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a 
leading genetic cause of infant mortality. Nearly half of the known SMA patient 
missense mutations map to the SMN YG-box, a highly conserved oligomerization 
domain of unknown structure that contains a (YxxG)₃ motif. Here, we report that 
the SMN YG-box forms helical oligomers similar to the glycine zippers found in 
transmembrane channel proteins. A network of tyrosine-glycine packing between 
helices drives formation of soluble YG-box oligomers, providing a structural 
basis for understanding SMN oligomerization and for relating defects in 
oligomerization to the mutations found in SMA patients. These results have 
important implications for advancing our understanding of SMN function and 
glycine zipper-mediated helix-helix interactions.
