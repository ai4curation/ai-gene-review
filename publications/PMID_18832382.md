Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is important during embryonic cell layer 
movement and tumor cell invasiveness. EMT converts adherent epithelial cells to 
motile mesenchymal cells, favoring metastasis in the context of cancer 
progression. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) triggers EMT via 
intracellular Smad transducers and other signaling proteins. We previously 
reported that the high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) gene is required for TGF-beta 
to elicit EMT in mammary epithelial cells. In the present study we investigated 
the molecular mechanisms by which HMGA2 induces EMT. We found that HMGA2 
regulates expression of many important repressors of E-cadherin. Among these, we 
analyzed in detail the zinc-finger transcription factor SNAIL1, which plays key 
roles in tumor progression and EMT. We demonstrate that HMGA2 directly binds to 
the SNAIL1 promoter and acts as a transcriptional regulator of SNAIL1 
expression. Furthermore, we observed that HMGA2 cooperates with the 
TGF-beta/Smad pathway in regulating SNAIL1 gene expression. The mechanism behind 
this cooperation involves physical interaction between these factors, leading to 
an increased binding of Smads to the SNAIL1 promoter. SNAIL1 seems to play the 
role of a master effector downstream of HMGA2 for induction of EMT, as SNAIL1 
knock-down partially reverts HMGA2-induced loss of epithelial differentiation. 
The data propose that HMGA2 acts in a gene-specific manner to orchestrate the 
transcriptional network necessary for the EMT program.
