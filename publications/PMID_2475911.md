Overlapping complementary DNA clones were isolated from epithelial cell 
libraries with a genomic DNA segment containing a portion of the putative cystic 
fibrosis (CF) locus, which is on chromosome 7. Transcripts, approximately 6500 
nucleotides in size, were detectable in the tissues affected in patients with 
CF. The predicted protein consists of two similar motifs, each with (i) a domain 
having properties consistent with membrane association and (ii) a domain 
believed to be involved in ATP (adenosine triphosphate) binding. A deletion of 
three base pairs that results in the omission of a phenylalanine residue at the 
center of the first predicted nucleotide-binding domain was detected in CF 
patients.
