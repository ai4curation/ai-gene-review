BACKGROUND: Growth Arrest Specific gene product 6 (gas6) is a gamma-carboxylated 
protein that protects endothelial cells against apoptosis. Gas6 has previously 
been shown to induce phospatidyl-3-inositol-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling. Other 
studies have demonstrated a link between PI3K/Akt signaling and forkhead 
transcription factors in endothelial cells.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that gas6 promotes cell survival via a 
forkhead-dependent pathway.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of serum-starved human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells (HUVECs) with gas6 induced time-dependent phosphorylation and 
nuclear exclusion of FOXO1a. This effect was suppressed by the PI3K inhibitor 
wortmannin, demonstrating that FOXO1a phosphorylation is PI3-kinase dependent. 
Transduction of HUVECs with a phosphorylation-resistant form of FOXO1a [triple 
mutant (TM)-FOXO1a] abrogated the pro-survival effect of gas6 on serum-starved 
endothelial cells. Finally, treatment of serum-starved HUVECs with gas6 resulted 
in a reduction of FOXO1a transcriptional activity and downregulation of the 
pro-apoptotic gene, p27(kip1). Taken together, these findings suggest that gas6 
protects endothelial cells from apoptosis by a mechanism that involves 
PI3K-Akt-dependent inactivation of FOXO1a.
