ORP1L is a member of the human oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family. ORP1L 
localizes to late endosomes (LEs)/lysosomes, colocalizing with the GTPases Rab7 
and Rab9 and lysosome-associated membrane protein-1. We demonstrate that ORP1L 
interacts physically with Rab7, preferentially with its GTP-bound form, and 
provide evidence that ORP1L stabilizes GTP-bound Rab7 on LEs/lysosomes. The 
Rab7-binding determinant is mapped to the ankyrin repeat (ANK) region of ORP1L. 
The pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) of ORP1L binds phosphoinositides with low 
affinity and specificity. ORP1L ANK- and ANK+PHD fragments induce perinuclear 
clustering of LE/lysosomes. This is dependent on an intact microtubule network 
and a functional dynein/dynactin motor complex. The dominant inhibitory Rab7 
mutant T22N reverses the LE clustering, suggesting that the effect is dependent 
on active Rab7. Transport of fluorescent dextran to LEs is inhibited by 
overexpression of ORP1L. Overexpression of ORP1L, and in particular the 
N-terminal fragments of ORP1L, inhibits vacuolation of LE caused by Helicobacter 
pylori toxin VacA, a process also involving Rab7. The present study demonstrates 
that ORP1L binds to Rab7, modifies its functional cycle, and can interfere with 
LE/lysosome organization and endocytic membrane trafficking. This is the first 
report of a direct connection between the OSBP-related protein family and the 
Rab GTPases.
