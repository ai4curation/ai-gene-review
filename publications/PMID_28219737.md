Characteristics of novel human membrane androgen receptor (mAR), ZIP9 (SLC39A9), 
were investigated in ZIP9-transfected PC-3 cells (PC3-ZIP9). Ligand blot 
analysis showed plasma membrane [3H]-T binding corresponds to the position of 
ZIP9 on Western blots which suggests ZIP9 can bind [3H]-T alone, without a 
protein partner. Progesterone antagonized testosterone actions, blocking 
increases in zinc, Erk phosphorylation and apoptosis, further evidence that ZIP9 
is specifically activated by androgens. Pre-treatment with GTPγS and pertussis 
toxin decreased plasma membrane [3H]-T binding and blocked testosterone-induced 
increases in Erk phosphorylation and intracellular zinc, indicating ZIP9 is 
coupled to an inhibitory G protein (Gi) that mediates both MAP kinase and zinc 
signaling. Testosterone treatment of nuclei and mitochondria which express ZIP9 
decreased their zinc contents, suggesting ZIP9 also regulates free zinc through 
releasing it from these intracellular organelles. The results show ZIP9 is a 
specific Gi coupled-mAR mediating testosterone-induced MAP kinase and zinc 
signaling in PC3-ZIP9 cells.
