BCAR3 (breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 3) is a signal transducer 
containing an SH2 domain, a proline/serine-rich domain and a GDP-exchange factor 
homologous domain, whose role in signaling pathways is currently unclear. 
Furthermore, BCAR3 is implicated in anti-estrogen resistance of breast cancer 
cells. In the present study, we investigated the functional role of BCAR3 in a 
mitogenic signaling pathway of EGF in non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial 
MCF-12A cells. Microinjection of an anti-BCAR3 antibody, siRNAs targeting BCAR3 
and an SH2 domain of BCAR3 inhibited EGF-induced DNA synthesis. Direct 
association of BCAR3 with activated EGF receptor and Cas was observed. Lastly, 
microinjection of a BCAR3 expression plasmid induced DNA synthesis. These 
findings suggest that the BCAR3 protein, through its SH2 domain, is involved in 
the signaling pathways of EGF leading to cell cycle progression, and that BCAR3 
itself is part of a mitogenic signaling pathway.
