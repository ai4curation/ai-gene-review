A hallmark of neutrophil polarization is the back localization of active RHOA 
and phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC, also known as MYL2). However, the 
mechanism for the polarization is not entirely clear. Here, we show that FAM65B, 
a newly identified RHOA inhibitor, is important for the polarization. When 
FAM65B is phosphorylated, it binds to 14-3-3 family proteins and becomes more 
stable. In neutrophils, chemoattractants stimulate FAM65B phosphorylation 
largely depending on the signals from the front of the cells that include those 
mediated by phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ), 
leading to FAM65B accumulation at the leading edge. Concordantly, FAM65B 
deficiency in neutrophils resulted in an increase in RHOA activity and 
localization of pMLC to the front of cells, as well as defects in chemotaxis 
directionality and adhesion to endothelial cells under flow. These data together 
elucidate a mechanism for RHOA and pMLC polarization in stimulated neutrophils 
through direct inhibition of RHOA by FAM65B at the leading edge.
