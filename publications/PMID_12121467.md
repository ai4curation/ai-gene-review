Seed dormancy and germination are complex traits that are controlled by many 
genes. Four mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana exhibiting a reduced dormancy 
phenotype, designated rdo1, rdo2, rdo3, and rdo4, have been characterized, both 
genetically and physiologically. Two of these mutants, rdo1 and rdo2, have been 
described before, the other two represent novel loci. The mutants mapped on 
chromosome 1 (rdo3), chromosome 2 (rdo2 and rdo4), and chromosome 3 (rdo1). None 
of these loci has been related to dormancy before. All four mutants show 
pleiotropic effects in the adult plant stage, which are different for each 
mutant. None of the mutants is deficient in ABA. Compared to Ler (wild-type), 
ABA sensitivity is not altered either, thereby excluding the possibility that 
ABA is involved in causing the reduced dormancy phenotype. The GA requirement 
was studied by using the GA biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol, and 
genetically by generating double mutants with the GA-deficient mutant ga1-3. The 
results obtained by these two methods were comparable for all but one mutant: 
rdo1. In a GA-deficient background, rdo1, rdo2 and rdo3, all show sensitivity to 
GA between that of ga1-3 and ga1-3 aba1. However, when using paclobutrazol rdo1 
exhibited the same sensitivity as rdo4 and wild-type. Analysis of double mutants 
among the rdo mutants revealed a very complex and inconsistent pattern.
