Here we report c-Abl kinase inhibition mediated by a phosphotyrosine located in 
trans in the c-Abl substrate, Abi1. The mechanism, which is pertinent to the 
nonmyristoylated c-Abl kinase, involves high affinity concurrent binding of the 
phosphotyrosine pY213 to the Abl SH2 domain and binding of a proximal PXXP motif 
to the Abl SH3 domain. Abi1 regulation of c-Abl in vivo appears to play a 
critical role, as demonstrated by inhibition of pY412 phosphorylation of the 
nonmyristoylated Abl by coexpression of Abi1. Pervanadate-induced c-Abl kinase 
activity was also reduced upon expression of the wild type Abi1 but not by 
expression of the Y213 to F213 mutant Abi1 in LNCaP cells, which are naturally 
deficient in the regulatory pY213. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism by 
which Abl kinase is regulated in cells.
