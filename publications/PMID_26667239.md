DFT studies on the mechanism of the formation of "gemini" quaternary ammonium 
salts in the reaction of 1,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-mannitol ditriflate derivative with 
trimethylamine and its subsequent conversion to tertiary amine through the 
methyl-transfer reaction are discussed. Two alternative reaction pathways are 
presented in the gas phase and in ethanol. Additionally, the transformation of 
the monotriflate derivative of 1,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-mannitol into the single 
quaternary ammonium salt is presented. Two functionals (B3LYP, M062X) and two 
basis sets (6-31+G** and 6-311++G**) were used for the calculations. The effect 
of the substituent attached to the five-membered rings at the C2 (and/or C5) 
carbon atom on the activation barrier is described. The trimethylammonium group 
bond to the five-membered ring greatly reduces the activation barrier height. 
The preferred reaction pathway for the conversions was established. Including 
the London dispersion in the calculations increases the stabilization of all the 
points on the potential energy surface in relation to individual reactants.
