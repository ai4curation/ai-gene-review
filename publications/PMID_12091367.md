We describe a family with autosomal dominant inheritance of increased body iron 
stores characterized by raised serum ferritin concentration and normal 
transferrin saturation. Liver biopsy showed iron deposition in Kupffer cells 
without fibrosis. The clinical features of HFE-related hemochromatosis were 
absent, as were the Cys282Tyr and His63Asp mutations. Venesection therapy was 
poorly tolerated, suggesting a defect in iron release from reticuloendothelial 
stores. A 3-base pair deletion in exon 5 of the ferroportin 1 gene (SLC11A3) 
predicting Val162 deletion was found in affected members, but not in unaffected 
individuals or in 100 control subjects. Consensus structural predictions of the 
transmembrane helices showed that the deletion is in the extracellular loop 
between the third and fourth predicted transmembrane helices and lies within a 
spatial cluster of other known ferroportin 1 mutations. These results indicate 
that this extracellular cluster is functionally important for iron transport, 
and its disruption leads to iron overload.
