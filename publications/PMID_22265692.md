Follistatin-related protein (FRP)/follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) has multi-specific 
binding nature especially with TGF-β superfamily proteins, and thereby modulates 
organ development. However, its function in immune systems remains unclear. 
Previously, we reported FRP interacts with CD14, which is known to mediate 
toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. Here, we investigated whether FRP 
activates TLR4 signaling. Recombinant FRP induced interleukin 6 or interleukin 8 
production from target cells in a CD14- and TLR4-dependent manner. Moreover, 
similar to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), FRP induced tolerance to the second LPS 
stimulation. FRP has the function of evoking innate immune responses as one of 
the endogenous TLR4 agonists.
