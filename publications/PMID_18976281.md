In Bacillus subtilis, FtsZ ring formation and cell division is favoured at the 
midcell because the inhibitor proteins MinC and MinD are indirectly restricted 
to the cell poles by the protein DivIVA. Here we identify MinJ, a topological 
determinant of medial FtsZ positioning that acts as an intermediary between 
DivIVA and MinD. Due to unrestricted MinD activity, cells mutated for minJ 
exhibited pleiotropic defects in homologous recombination, swarming motility and 
cell division. MinJ restricted MinD activity by localizing MinD to the cell 
poles through direct protein-protein interaction. MinJ itself localized to cell 
poles in a manner that was dependent on DivIVA. MinJ is conserved in other low 
G+C Gram-positive bacteria and may be an important component of cell division 
site selection in these organisms.
