Calmodulin (CaM) is the primary Ca(2+)-sensor that regulates a wide variety of 
cellular processes in eukaryotes. Although many Ca(2+)/CaM-binding proteins have 
been identified, very few such proteins could be found from the genome-wide 
protein-protein interaction maps of Caenorhabditis elegans constructed by yeast 
two-hybrid screening. Using a genotype-phenotype conjugation method called 
mRNA-display, we performed a selection for Ca(2+)/CaM-binding proteins from a 
proteome library of C. elegans. The method allowed the identification of 9 known 
and 47 previously uncharacterized Ca(2+)-dependent CaM-binding proteins from the 
adult worm proteome. The Ca(2+)/CaM-binding properties of these proteins were 
characterized and their binding motifs were identified. The availability of such 
information could facilitate our understanding of the signaling pathways 
mediated by Ca(2+)/CaM in C. elegans. Due to its simplicity and efficiency, the 
method could be readily applied to examine the Ca(2+)-dependent binding partners 
of numerous other Ca(2+)-binding proteins, which may play important roles in 
many signaling pathways in C. elegans.
