Cyclin E-Cdk2 has long been considered an essential and master regulator of 
progression through G1 phase of the cell cycle. Although recent mouse models 
have prompted a rethinking of cyclin E function in mammals, it remains clear 
that cyclin E impacts upon many processes central to cell division. Normal cells 
maintain strict control of cyclin E activity, and this is commonly disrupted in 
cancer cells. Moreover, cyclin E deregulation is thought to play a fundamental 
role in tumorigenesis. In this review, we discuss the regulation and functions 
of cyclin E in normal and neoplastic mammalian cells.
