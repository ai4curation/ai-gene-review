The ADO/FKF/LKP/ZTL family of proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana Heynh. have a LOV 
domain, an F-box motif, and a kelch repeat region. LKP2 is a member of this 
family and functions either within or very close to the circadian oscillator in 
Arabidopsis. Promoter-GUS fusion studies revealed that the LKP2 gene was highly 
active in rosette leaves. In CaMV 35S:LKP2-GFP plants, GFP-associated 
fluorescence was detected in nuclei, suggesting that LKP2 is a nuclear protein. 
Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that LKP2 interacted with some 
Arabidopsis Skp1-like proteins (ASK), as do other ADO/FKF/LKP/ZTL family 
proteins, suggesting that LKP2 can form an SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein) 
complex that functions as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. LKP2 interacted not only with 
itself but also with other members of the family, LKP1 and FKF1. The two-hybrid 
analysis also demonstrated that LKP2 interacted with TOC1, a clock component, 
but not with CCA1 or LHY, negative regulators of TOC1 gene expression. The LOV 
domain of LKP2 was shown to be necessary and sufficient for the interaction with 
TOC1. An interaction between LKP2 and APRR5, a paralogue of TOC1, was also 
observed, but LKP2 did not interact with APRR3, APRR7, or APRR9, other 
paralogues of TOC1.
