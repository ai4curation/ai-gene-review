The formation of protein complexes is a hallmark of cellular signal 
transduction. Here, we show that peptide microarrays provide a robust and 
quantitative means to detect signalling-dependent changes of molecular 
interactions. Recruitment of a protein into a complex upon stimulation of a cell 
leads to the masking of an otherwise exposed binding site. In cell lysates this 
masking can be detected by reduced binding to a microarray carrying a peptide 
that corresponds to the binding motif of the respective interaction domain. The 
method is exemplified for the lymphocyte-specific tyrosine kinase 70 kDa 
zeta-associated protein binding to a bis-phosphotyrosine-motif of the activated 
T-cell receptor via its tandem SH2 domain. Compared to established techniques, 
the method provides a significant shortcut to the detection of molecular 
interactions.
