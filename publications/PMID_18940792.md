C/EBP homology protein (CHOP), a stress-induced transcription factor, is 
involved in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. The present 
studies identified CHOP as an interacting partner of activating transcription 
factor (ATF) 4 in a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed their interaction in 
HEK293T cells. CHOP protein levels rose modestly and transiently during amino 
acid deprivation, whereas endoplasmic reticulum stress caused a much higher and 
sustained expression of CHOP protein. Exogenous CHOP expression enhanced the 
TRB3 gene induction by amino acid deprivation. Conversely, CHOP suppressed the 
induction of the endogenous asparagine synthetase (ASNS) gene and inhibited 
transcription from a reporter gene driven by the ASNS promoter following 
activation by ATF4 or amino acid deprivation. Short interfering RNA-mediated 
knockdown of CHOP further enhanced the induction of ASNS by either amino acid 
deprivation or endoplasmic reticulum stress. The CHOP-dependent repression of 
the ASNS gene required the entire CHOP protein, arguing against the possibility 
of simple sequestration of ATF4 by the CHOP leucine zipper domain, and chromatin 
immunoprecipitation analysis showed association of CHOP with the ASNS and TRB3 
promoters. Interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation also showed that CHOP 
was associated with the C/EBP-ATF composite site regions of the SNAT2, VEGF, and 
CAT-1 genes, despite no significant effect on their expression after exogenous 
CHOP overexpression. Collectively, the results document that CHOP is a member of 
the transcription factor network that controls the stress-induced regulation of 
specific C/EBP-ATF-containing genes, such as ASNS.
