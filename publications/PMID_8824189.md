In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, MAD2 is required for mitotic arrest if the spindle 
assembly is perturbed. The human homolog of MAD2 was isolated and shown to be a 
necessary component of the mitotic checkpoint in HeLa cells by antibody 
electroporation experiments. Human, or Homo sapiens, MAD2 (hsMAD2) was localized 
at the kinetochore after chromosome condensation but was no longer observed at 
the kinetochore in metaphase, suggesting that MAD2 might monitor the 
completeness of the spindle-kinetochore attachment. Finally, T47D, a human 
breast tumor cell line that is sensitive to taxol and nocodazole, had reduced 
MAD2 expression and failed to arrest in mitosis after nocodazole treatment. 
Thus, defects in the mitotic checkpoint may contribute to the sensitivity of 
certain tumors to mitotic spindle inhibitors.
