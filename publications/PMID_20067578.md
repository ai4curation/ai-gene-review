Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are prevalent causes of 
late-onset Parkinson's disease. Here, we show that LRRK2 binds to MAPK kinases 
(MKK) 3, 6, and 7, and that LRRK2 is able to phosphorylate MKK3, 6 and 7. 
Over-expression of LRRK2 and MKK6 increased the steady state levels of each 
protein beyond that observed with over-expression of either protein alone. 
Co-expression increased levels of MKK6 in the membrane more than in the 
cytoplasm. The increased expression of LRRK2 and MKK6 requires MKK6 activity. 
The disease-linked LRRK2 mutations, G2019S, R1441C and I2020T, enhance binding 
of LRRK2 to MKK6. This interaction was further supported by in vivo studies in 
C. elegans. RNAi knockdown in C. elegans of the endogenous orthologs for MKK6 or 
p38, sek-1 and pmk-1, abolishes LRRK2-mediated protection against mitochondrial 
stress. These results were confirmed by deletion of sek-1 in C. elegans. These 
data demonstrate that MKKs and LRRK2 function in similar biological pathways, 
and support a role for LRRK2 in modulating the cellular stress response.
