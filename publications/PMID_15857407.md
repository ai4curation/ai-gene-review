Apolipoprotein J (apoJ; also known as clusterin and sulfated glycoprotein 
(SGP)-2) is associated with senile plaques in degenerating regions of 
Alzheimer's disease brains, where activated microglia are also prominent. We 
show a functional link between apoJ and activated microglia by demonstrating 
that exogenous apoJ activates rodent microglia in vivo and in vitro. 
Intracerebroventricular infusion of purified human plasma apoJ ( approximately 4 
microg over 28 days) activated parenchymal microglia to a phenotype 
characterized by enlarged cell bodies and processes (phosphotyrosine 
immunostaining). In vitro, primary rat microglia were also activated by apoJ, 
with changes in morphology and induction of major histocompatibility complex 
class II (MHCII) antigen. ApoJ increased the secretion of reactive nitrogen 
intermediates in a dose-dependent manner (EC(50) 112 nm), which was completely 
blocked by aminoguanidine (AG), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. However, AG 
did not block the increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha by apoJ 
(EC(50) 55 nm). Microglial activation by apoJ was also blocked by an anti-apoJ 
monoclonal antibody (G7), and by chemical cleavage of apoJ with 
2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoate. The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and 
protein kinase C inhibitors PD98059 and H7 inhibited apoJ-mediated induction of 
reactive nitrogen intermediate secretion from cultured microglia. As a 
functional measure, apoJ-activated microglia secreted neurotoxic agents in a 
microglia-neuron co-culture model. We hypothesize that ApoJ contributes to 
chronic inflammation and neurotoxicity through direct effects on microglia.
