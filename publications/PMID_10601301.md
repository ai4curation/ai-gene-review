Arachidonic (20:4(n-6)), eicosapentaenoic (20:5(n-3)), and docosahexaenoic 
(22:6(n-3)) acids are major components of brain and retina phospholipids, 
substrates for eicosanoid production, and regulators of nuclear transcription 
factors. One of the two rate-limiting steps in the production of these polyenoic 
fatty acids is the desaturation of 20:3(n-6) and 20:4(n-3) by Delta-5 
desaturase. This report describes the cloning and expression of the human 
Delta-5 desaturase, and it compares the structural characteristics and 
nutritional regulation of the Delta-5 and Delta-6 desaturases. The open reading 
frame of the human Delta-5 desaturase encodes a 444-amino acid peptide which is 
identical in size to the Delta-6 desaturase and which shares 61% identity with 
the human Delta-6 desaturase. The Delta-5 desaturase contains two 
membrane-spanning domains, three histidine-rich regions, and a cytochrome b(5) 
domain that all align perfectly with the same domains located in the Delta-6 
desaturase. Expression of the open reading frame in Chinese hamster ovary cells 
instilled the ability to convert 20:3(n-6) to 20:4(n-6). Northern analysis 
revealed that many human tissues including skeletal muscle, lung, placenta, 
kidney, and pancreas expressed Delta-5 desaturase mRNA, but Delta-5 desaturase 
was most abundant in the liver, brain, and heart. However, in all tissues, the 
abundance of Delta-5 desaturase mRNA was much lower than that observed for the 
Delta-6 desaturase. When rats were fed a diet containing 10% safflower oil or 
menhaden fish oil, the level of hepatic mRNA for Delta-5 and Delta-6 desaturase 
was only 25% of that found in the liver of rats fed a fat-free diet or a diet 
containing triolein. Finally, a BLAST and Genemap search of the human genome 
revealed that the Delta-5 and Delta-6 desaturase genes reside in reverse 
orientation on chromosome 11 and that they are separated by <11,000 base pairs.
