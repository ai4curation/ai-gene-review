Notch signaling releases the Notch receptor intracellular domain (ICD), which 
complexes with CBF1 and Mastermind (MAM) to activate responsive genes. We 
previously reported that MAM interacts with CBP/p300 and promotes 
hyperphosphorylation and degradation of the Notch ICD in vivo. Here we show that 
CycC:CDK8 and CycT1:CDK9/P-TEFb are recruited with Notch and associated 
coactivators (MAM, SKIP) to the HES1 promoter in signaling cells. MAM interacts 
directly with CDK8 and can cause it to localize to subnuclear foci. Purified 
recombinant CycC:CDK8 phosphorylates the Notch ICD within the TAD and PEST 
domains, and expression of CycC:CDK8 strongly enhances Notch ICD 
hyperphosphorylation and PEST-dependent degradation by the Fbw7/Sel10 ubiquitin 
ligase in vivo. Point mutations affecting conserved Ser residues within the ICD 
PEST motif prevent hyperphosphorylation by CycC:CDK8 and stabilize the ICD in 
vivo. These findings suggest a role for MAM and CycC:CDK8 in the turnover of the 
Notch enhancer complex at target genes.
