In Caenorhabditis elegans, germ granules called P granules are directly 
inherited from mother to daughter and segregate with the germ lineage as it 
separates from the soma during initial embryonic cell divisions. Here we define 
meg-1 and meg-2 (maternal-effect germ-cell defective), which are expressed in 
the maternal germline and encode proteins that localize exclusively to P 
granules during embryonic germline segregation. Localization of MEG-1 to P 
granules depends upon the membrane-bound protein MES-1. meg-1 mutants exhibit 
multiple germline defects: P-granule mis-segregation in embryos, 
underproliferation and aberrant P-granule morphology in larval germ cells, and 
ultimately, sterility as adults. The penetrance of meg-1 phenotypes increases 
when meg-2 is also absent. Loss of the P-granule component pgl-1 in meg-1 
mutants increases germ-cell proliferation, while loss of glh-1 decreases 
proliferation. Because meg-1 is provided maternally but its action is required 
in the embryonic germ lineage during segregation from somatic lineages, it 
provides a critical link for ensuring the continuity of germline development 
from one generation to the next.
