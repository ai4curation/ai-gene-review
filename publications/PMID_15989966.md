Growth-dependent regulation of rRNA synthesis is mediated by TIF-IA, a basal 
transcription initiation factor for RNA polymerase I. We inactivated the murine 
TIF-IA gene by homologous recombination in mice and embryonic fibroblasts 
(MEFs). TIF-IA-/- embryos die before or at embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5), displaying 
retardation of growth and development. In MEFs, Cre-mediated depletion of TIF-IA 
leads to disruption of nucleoli, cell cycle arrest, upregulation of p53, and 
induction of apoptosis. Elevated levels of p53 after TIF-IA depletion are due to 
increased binding of ribosomal proteins, such as L11, to MDM2 and decreased 
interaction of MDM2 with p53 and p19(ARF). RNAi-induced loss of p53 overcomes 
proliferation arrest and apoptosis in response to TIF-IA ablation. The striking 
correlation between perturbation of nucleolar function, elevated levels of p53, 
and induction of cell suicide supports the view that the nucleolus is a stress 
sensor that regulates p53 activity.
