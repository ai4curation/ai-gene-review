The gene encoding dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A 
(DYRK1A) is located within the Down syndrome (DS) critical region of chromosome 
21. DYRK1A interacts with a plethora of substrates in the cytosol, cytoskeleton, 
and nucleus. Its overexpression is a contributing factor to the developmental 
alterations and age-associated pathology observed in DS. We hypothesized that 
the intracellular distribution of DYRK1A and cell-compartment-specific functions 
are associated with DYRK1A posttranslational modifications. Fractionation showed 
that, in both human and mouse brain, almost 80% of DYRK1A was associated with 
the cytoskeleton, and the remaining DYRK1A was present in the cytosolic and 
nuclear fractions. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that DYRK1A in the brain 
cytoskeleton fraction forms complexes with filamentous actin, neurofilaments, 
and tubulin. Two-dimensional gel analysis of the fractions revealed DYRK1A with 
distinct isoelectric points: 5.5-6.5 in the nucleus, 7.2-8.2 in the 
cytoskeleton, and 8.7 in the cytosol. Phosphate-affinity gel electrophoresis 
demonstrated several bands of DYRK1A with different mobility shifts for nuclear, 
cytoskeletal, and cytosolic DYRK1A, indicating modification by phosphorylation. 
Mass spectrometry analysis disclosed one phosphorylated site in the cytosolic 
DYRK1A and multiple phosphorylated residues in the cytoskeletal DYRK1A, 
including two not previously described. This study supports the hypothesis that 
intracellular distribution and compartment-specific functions of DYRK1A may 
depend on its phosphorylation pattern.

Abstract

The gene encoding dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated
kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is located within the Down syndrome (DS) critical region of
chromosome 21. DYRK1A interacts with a plethora of substrates in the cytosol,
cytoskeleton, and nucleus. Its overexpression is a contributing factor to the
developmental alterations and age-associated pathology observed in DS. We
hypothesized that the intracellular distribution of DYRK1A and
cell-compartment–specific functions are associated with DYRK1A
posttranslational modifications. Fractionation showed that in both human and
mouse brain, almost 80% of DYRK1A was associated with the cytoskeleton,
and the remaining DYRK1A was present in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions.
Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that DYRK1A in the brain cytoskeleton fraction
forms complexes with filamentous actin, neurofilaments, and tubulin.
Two-dimensional gel analysis of the fractions revealed DYRK1A with distinct
isoelectric points: 5.5–6.5 in the nucleus, 7.2–8.2 in the
cytoskeleton, and 8.7 in the cytosol. Phosphate-affinity gel electrophoresis
demonstrated several bands of DYRK1A with different mobility shifts for nuclear,
cytoskeletal, and cytosolic DYRK1A, indicating modification by phosphorylation.
Mass spectrometry analysis disclosed one phosphorylated site in the cytosolic
DYRK1A, and multiple phosphorylated residues in the cytoskeletal DYRK1A,
including two not previously described. This study supports the hypothesis that
intracellular distribution and compartment-specific functions of DYRK1A may
depend on its phosphorylation pattern.

INTRODUCTION

The dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A gene
(Entrez Gene: human DYRK1A gene ID 1859; mouse Dyrk1A gene ID 13548) is encoded within the Down syndrome (DS)
critical region of chromosome 21. Overexpression of its product is detected in DS
( Guimera et al., 1999 ; Dowjat et al., 2007 ), and an excessive amount of DYRK1A
protein is a contributing factor to the developmental ( Hämmerle et al., 2003 ; Canzonetta et al., 2008 ; Tejedor and Hämmerle, 2011 ) and age-associated ( Shi et al., 2008 ; Liu et
al., 2008 ; Wegiel et al., 2008 , 2011a , 2011b ) pathology observed in DS. In spite of its nuclear targeting
sequence, in human and mouse brain, DYRK1A is also present within the cell cytoplasm
( Martí et al., 2003 ; Wegiel et. al., 2004 ). Both nuclear and
cytoplasmic substrates for this kinase have been identified. It has been shown that
DYRK1A regulates splicing factors such as cyclin L2, SF3b/SAP155, and ASF ( de Graaf et al., 2004 , 2006 ; Shi et al.,
2008 ) and interacts with the transcription factors FKHR, CREB, Gli-1, and
NFAT ( Woods et al., 2001 ; Yang et al., 2001 ; Mao et
al., 2002 ; Arron et al., 2006 ; Gwack et al., 2006 ). In the cytoplasm,
DYRK1A phosphorylates synaptic proteins— dynamin ( Chen-Hwang et al., 2002 ), synaptojanin 1 ( Adayev et al., 2006 ), and amphiphysin I ( Murakami et al., 2006 )—and cytoskeletal targets:
tau ( Woods et al., 2001 ), MAP1B ( Scales et al., 2009 ), and α-synuclein
( Kim et al., 2006 ). The diversity of
DYRK1A substrates and their localization in different cell compartments suggests
that mechanisms regulating intracellular trafficking of this kinase play an
important role in its function.

Phosphorylation is a known mechanism regulating DYRK1A activity but function
of only two phosphorylated residues in vivo has been studied in
detail. Autophosphorylation of tyrosine residue in the activation loop initiates
DYRK1A enzymatic activity ( Becker and Joost,
1999 ; Himpel et al., 2001 ).
Autophosphorylation of serine residue (S520) contributes to the binding of
scaffolding protein 14-3-3β, which in turn stimulates the catalytic activity
by 100% ( Alvarez et al., 2007 ).

The aim of this study was to characterize the proportions and properties of
DYRK1A in cytosolic, cytoskeletal, and nuclear fractions obtained from human and
mouse brain homogenates, as well as the interactions of DYRK1A with cytoskeletal
proteins. The study revealed binding of the majority of DYRK1A to cytoskeletal
proteins, including β-actin and neurofilaments; the distinctive isoelectric
points (pIs) of cytoskeletal, cytosolic, and nuclear DYRK1A; and differences in
phosphorylation in cytosolic and cytoskeletal DYRK1A. Our findings suggest that
phosphorylation affects intracellular DYRK1A distribution and function.

DISCUSSION

Detection of DYRK1A in the cytosol, cytoskeleton, synapses, and nuclei
indicates involvement of this kinase in regulation of multiple cellular processes.
The results of this study indicate that distinct phosphorylation of DYRK1A is
associated with its intracellular distribution and interactions. These
posttranslational modifications may regulate DYRK1A interactions with nuclear,
cytoskeletal, and cytosolic substrates and diverse DYRK1A functions in physiological
and pathological conditions.
