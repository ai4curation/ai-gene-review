The mammalian proapoptotic protein Bax confers a lethal phenotype when expressed 
in yeast. By exploiting this phenotype, we have identified a novel human Bax 
inhibitor, BI-1. BI-1 is an evolutionarily conserved integral membrane protein 
containing multiple membrane-spanning segments and is predominantly localized to 
intracellular membranes, similar to Bcl-2 family proteins. Moreover, BI-1 can 
interact with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL but Bax or Bak, as demonstrated by in vivo 
cross-linking and coimmunoprecipitation studies. When overexpressed in mammalian 
cells, BI-1 suppressed apoptosis included by Bax, etoposide, staurosporine, and 
growth factor deprivation, but not by Fas (CD95). Conversely, BI-1 antisense 
induced apoptosis. BI-1 thus represents a new type of regulator of cell death 
pathways controlled by Bcl-2 and Bax.
