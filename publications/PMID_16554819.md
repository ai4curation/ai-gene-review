Neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease are neurofibrillary tangles 
composed of tau and neuritic plaques comprising amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) 
derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP), but their exact relationship 
remains elusive. Phosphorylation of tau and APP on certain serine or threonine 
residues preceding proline affects tangle formation and Abeta production in 
vitro. Phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in peptides can exist in cis or trans 
conformations, the conversion of which is catalysed by the Pin1 prolyl 
isomerase. Pin1 has been proposed to regulate protein function by accelerating 
conformational changes, but such activity has never been visualized and the 
biological and pathological significance of Pin1 substrate conformations is 
unknown. Notably, Pin1 is downregulated and/or inhibited by oxidation in 
Alzheimer's disease neurons, Pin1 knockout causes tauopathy and 
neurodegeneration, and Pin1 promoter polymorphisms appear to associate with 
reduced Pin1 levels and increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. 
However, the role of Pin1 in APP processing and Abeta production is unknown. 
Here we show that Pin1 has profound effects on APP processing and Abeta 
production. We find that Pin1 binds to the phosphorylated Thr 668-Pro motif in 
APP and accelerates its isomerization by over 1,000-fold, regulating the APP 
intracellular domain between two conformations, as visualized by NMR. Whereas 
Pin1 overexpression reduces Abeta secretion from cell cultures, knockout of Pin1 
increases its secretion. Pin1 knockout alone or in combination with 
overexpression of mutant APP in mice increases amyloidogenic APP processing and 
selectively elevates insoluble Abeta42 (a major toxic species) in brains in an 
age-dependent manner, with Abeta42 being prominently localized to multivesicular 
bodies of neurons, as shown in Alzheimer's disease before plaque pathology. 
Thus, Pin1-catalysed prolyl isomerization is a novel mechanism to regulate APP 
processing and Abeta production, and its deregulation may link both tangle and 
plaque pathologies. These findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis and 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
