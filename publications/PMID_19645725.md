The sensitive to lysis D (SlyD) protein from Escherichia coli is related to the 
FK506-binding protein family, and it harbours both peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans 
isomerase (PPIase) and chaperone-like activity, preventing aggregation and 
promoting the correct folding of other proteins. Whereas a functional role of 
SlyD as a protein-folding catalyst in vivo remains unclear, SlyD has been shown 
to be an essential component for [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenase metallocentre assembly in 
bacteria. Interestingly, the isomerase activity of SlyD is uniquely modulated by 
nickel ions, which possibly regulate its functions in response to external 
stimuli. In this work, we investigated the solution structure of SlyD and its 
interaction with nickel ions, enabling us to gain insights into the molecular 
mechanism of this regulation. We have revealed that the PPIase module of SlyD 
contains an additional C-terminal alpha-helix packed against the catalytic site 
of the domain; unexpectedly, our results show that the interaction of SlyD with 
nickel ions entails participation of the novel structural features of the PPIase 
domain, eliciting structural alterations of the catalytic pocket. We suggest 
that such conformational rearrangements upon metal binding underlie the ability 
of nickel ions to regulate the isomerase activity of SlyD.
