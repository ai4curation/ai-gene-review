Glia maturation factor-beta, a protein found in the brains of all vertebrates 
thus far examined, appears to play a role in the differentiation, maintenance, 
and regeneration of the nervous system. Using oligonucleotide probes based on 
the sequences of three tryptic peptides derived from bovine glia maturation 
factor-beta, we screened a human brainstem cDNA library in lambda gt11. A 0.7-kb 
clone was isolated, sequenced in its entirety, and found to encode a polypeptide 
of 142 amino acids which contained regions identical to the three bovine 
peptides. This polypeptide, human recombinant glia maturation factor-beta, has 
been expressed in Escherichia coli and found to possess structural 
characteristics and biological activity indistinguishable from those of the 
native bovine protein.
