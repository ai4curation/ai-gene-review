Microtubules in eukaryotic cells are nucleated from ring-shaped complexes that 
contain γ-tubulin and a family of homologous γ-tubulin complex proteins (GCPs), 
but the subunit composition of the complexes can vary among fungi, animals and 
plants. Arabidopsis GCP3-interacting protein 1 (GIP1), a small protein with no 
homology to the GCP family, interacts with GCP3 in vitro, and is a plant homolog 
of vertebrate mitotic-spindle organizing protein associated with a ring of 
γ-tubulin 1 (MOZART1), a recently identified component of the γ-tubulin complex 
in human cell lines. In this study, we characterized two closely related 
Arabidopsis GIP1s: GIP1a and GIP1b. Single mutants of gip1a and gip1b were 
indistinguishable from wild-type plants, but their double mutant was embryonic 
lethal, and showed impaired development of male gametophytes. Functional fusions 
of GIP1a with green fluorescent protein (GFP) were used to purify 
GIP1a-containing complexes from Arabidopsis plants, which contained all the 
subunits (except NEDD1) previously identified in the Arabidopsis γ-tubulin 
complexes. GIP1a and GIP1b interacted specifically with Arabidopsis GCP3 in 
yeast. GFP-GIP1a labeled mitotic microtubule arrays in a pattern largely 
consistent with, but partly distinct from, the localization of the γ-tubulin 
complex containing GCP2 or GCP3 in planta. In interphase cortical arrays, the 
labeled complexes were preferentially recruited to existing microtubules, from 
which new microtubules were efficiently nucleated. However, in contrast to 
complexes labeled with tagged GCP2 or GCP3, their recruitment to cortical areas 
with no microtubules was rarely observed. These results indicate that 
GIP1/MOZART1 is an integral component of a subset of the Arabidopsis γ-tubulin 
complexes.
