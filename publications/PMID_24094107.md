The strength of synaptic communication at central synapses depends on the number 
of ionotropic glutamate receptors, particularly the class gated by the agonist 
AMPA (AMPARs). Cornichon proteins, evolutionarily conserved endoplasmic 
reticulum cargo adaptors, modify the properties of vertebrate AMPARs when 
coexpressed in heterologous cells. However, the contribution of cornichons to 
behavior and in vivo nervous system function has yet to be determined. Here, we 
take a genetic approach to these questions by studying CNI-1--the sole cornichon 
homolog in C. elegans. cni-1 mutants hyperreverse, a phenotype associated with 
increased glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Consistent with this behavior, we 
find larger glutamate-gated currents in cni-1 mutants with a corresponding 
increase in AMPAR number. Furthermore, we observe opposite phenotypes in 
transgenic worms that overexpress CNI-1 or vertebrate homologs. In 
reconstitution studies, we provide support for an evolutionarily conserved role 
for cornichons in regulating the export of vertebrate and invertebrate AMPARs.

INTRODUCTION

Rapid, excitatory synaptic communication that occurs in vertebrate brains, as well as in most other nervous systems, is primarily mediated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. The strength of this communication is dependent on the number of AMPA-class ionotropic glutamate receptors, as well as on their functional properties. Synaptic strength is plastic, and nervous system activity can change the number and properties of AMPARs ( Anggono and Huganir, 2012 ; Kerchner and Nicoll, 2008 ; Kessels and Malinow, 2009 ).

While the properties of AMPARs can be modified by RNA editing ( Wright and Vissel, 2012 ) and posttranslational modification of receptors ( Lu and Roche, 2012 ), more recent genetic studies have demonstrated that AMPAR trafficking and function are critically dependent on auxiliary proteins, most prominently the TARP and SOL classes of transmembrane proteins ( Jackson and Nicoll, 2011 ; Wang et al., 2012 ; Wang et al., 2008 ; Yan and Tomita, 2012 ; Zheng et al., 2004 ). Furthermore, proteomic studies have identified a host of new candidate auxiliary proteins ( Schwenk et al., 2012 ; Schwenk et al., 2009 ; Shanks et al., 2012 ; von Engelhardt et al., 2010 ), including the vertebrate cornichon (CNIH) proteins CNIH-2 and CNIH-3 ( Schwenk et al., 2009 ).

Cornichon was first identified in Drosophila , where the Cni protein binds to the EGF-like ligand Gurken, thus acting as a cargo receptor for recruitment of Gurken into COPII vesicles. In the absence of Cni, export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and secretion of ligand are disrupted ( Bokel et al., 2006 ; Roth et al., 1995 ). More recently, affinity purification of native AMPARs from rat brain followed by mass spectroscopy analysis identified CNIH-2 and CNIH-3 as AMPAR-interacting proteins. When coexpressed with AMPAR subunits in heterologous cells, these proteins slowed the kinetics of receptor desensitization and deactivation, and increased surface expression ( Coombs et al., 2012 ; Kato et al., 2010 ; Schwenk et al., 2009 ; Shi et al., 2010 ).

Subsequent studies have revealed additional complexities. While CNIH-2 was found at the cell surface of hippocampal neurons, it did not reach the surface of cerebellar Purkinje neurons in stargazer mice, which lack the γ-2 TARP ( Gill et al., 2011 ). Studies in HeLa cells found that overexpression of CNIH-2 altered the glycosylation pattern of the GluA2 AMPAR subunit, suggesting that CNIH-2 regulates AMPAR maturation in the ER, which may affect AMPAR function at synapses ( Harmel et al., 2012 ). While studies in various heterologous cells have provided important insights into CNIH-2 function, these cells might express different proteins and use different trafficking pathways than those present in neurons. Consequently, studies to date have not fully resolved whether CNIHs primarily have a forward trafficking role in neurons, whether they are also recruited away from the ER-Golgi early secretory pathway to function at synapses, or whether they function as auxiliary proteins at synapses to modify the functional properties of AMPARs. Clearly, a deeper understanding of the contribution of CNIHs to nervous system function and behavior would benefit from in vivo studies. Genetic-based studies of cornichon function in neurons are a challenge in vertebrates, which express four cornichon homologues with possible redundant functions. In contrast, only one cornichon homologue is found in the C. elegans genome.

The study of synaptic signaling in the simple, well-defined nervous system of C. elegans has provided new insights into AMPAR function and behaviors regulated by glutamatergic signaling ( de Bono and Maricq, 2005 ). In C. elegans , the GLR-1 AMPAR subunit is required for fast glutamate-gated current in specialized command interneurons that control the switch between forward and backward movement; thus, reversal frequency is disrupted in glr-1 loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutants ( Hart et al., 1995 ; Maricq et al., 1995 ; Zheng et al., 1999 ). Genetic screens for modifiers of this behavior have led to the identification of three classes of auxiliary proteins that associate with GLR-1 and modify the kinetics of glutamate-gated current. These include the evolutionarily and functionally conserved TARP proteins, STG-1 and STG-2 ( Walker et al., 2006a ; Wang et al., 2008 ), and the two classes of CUB-domain transmembrane proteins, SOL-1 and SOL-2 ( Walker et al., 2006a ; Walker et al., 2006b ; Wang et al., 2012 ; Zheng et al., 2006 ; Zheng et al., 2004 ).

Sequence analysis of the C. elegans genome revealed the presence of a single cornichon homologue ( cni-1 ). We found that cni-1 mutants exhibited a hyper-reversal phenotype in contrast to the hypo-reversal phenotype observed in strains with loss-of-function mutations in either the GLR-1 subunit or in the auxiliary proteins ( Brockie et al., 2001b ; Mellem et al., 2002 ; Zheng et al., 2004 ). Cornichon’s well-characterized role in the export of specific proteins from the ER ( Bokel et al., 2006 ; Castro et al., 2007 ; Herzig et al., 2012 ; Roth et al., 1995 ) prompted us to examine the in vivo trafficking of GLR-1. Compared to wild type, we found increased anterograde transport of GLR-1 in cni-1 mutants, with corresponding increases in synaptic GLR-1 expression and GLR-1-mediated currents. In contrast, trafficking and current were reduced with overexpression of CNI-1, the yeast homolog (Evr14p), or vertebrate CNIH-2. Reconstitution experiments revealed that cornichon proteins have evolutionarily conserved roles in limiting the export of AMPARs and modifying receptor function, thus contributing to the regulation of neuronal excitability.

General methods, genetics and plasmids

All C. elegans strains were raised at 20 °C under standard laboratory conditions. Transgenic strains carrying multi-copy transgene arrays were generated using microinjection into the gonad of adult hermaphrodite lin-15(n765ts) mutants, wild-type worms, or relevant mutant worms. Transgenic worms were selected by rescue of the lin-15(n765ts) mutant phenotype, or by expression of a co-injected fluorescent marker. Single copy transgenic strains were generated following an established protocol ( Frokjaer-Jensen et al., 2008 ). Fluorescently labeled CNI-1 was found to be functional in transgenic experiments that showed the fusion protein had a similar effect on the localization of fluorescently tagged GLR-1 as that of untagged CNI-1. Function of fluorescently labeled STG-2 was confirmed by rescue of stg-2(ak134) suppression of the lurcher worm hyper-reversal phenotype. Plasmids, transgenes and mutant strains are described in Supplemental experimental procedures .
