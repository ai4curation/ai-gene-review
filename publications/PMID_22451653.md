Osteoclasts are multinucleated giant cells that reside in osseous tissues and 
resorb bone. Signaling mediated by receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB 
(RANK) and its ligand leads to the nuclear factor of activated T cells 2/c1 
(NFAT2 or NFATc1) expression, a critical step in the formation of functional 
osteoclasts. In addition, adaptor proteins harboring immunoreceptor 
tyrosine-based activation motifs, such as DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa 
(DAP12), play essential roles. In this study, we identified the gene encoding 
the lectin Siglec-15 as NFAT2-inducible, and we found that the protein product 
links RANK ligand-RANK-NFAT2 and DAP12 signaling in mouse osteoclasts. Both the 
recognition of sialylated glycans by the Siglec-15 V-set domain and the 
association with DAP12 through its Lys-272 are essential for its function. When 
Siglec-15 expression was knocked down, fewer multinucleated cells developed, and 
those that did were morphologically contracted with disordered actin-ring 
structures. These changes were accompanied by significantly reduced bone 
resorption. Siglec-15 formed complexes with Syk through DAP12 in response to 
vitronectin. Furthermore, chimeric molecules consisting of the extracellular and 
transmembrane regions of Siglec-15 with a K272A mutation and the cytoplasmic 
region of DAP12 significantly restored bone resorption in cells with knocked 
down Siglec-15 expression. Together, these results suggested that the 
Siglec-15-DAP12-Syk-signaling cascade plays a critical role in functional 
osteoclast formation.

Abstract

Osteoclasts are multinucleated giant cells that reside in osseous tissues and resorb bone. Signaling mediated by receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB (RANK) and its ligand leads to the nuclear factor of activated T cells 2/c1 (NFAT2 or NFATc1) expression, a critical step in the formation of functional osteoclasts. In addition, adaptor proteins harboring immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, such as DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12), play essential roles. In this study, we identified the gene encoding the lectin Siglec-15 as NFAT2-inducible, and we found that the protein product links RANK ligand-RANK-NFAT2 and DAP12 signaling in mouse osteoclasts. Both the recognition of sialylated glycans by the Siglec-15 V-set domain and the association with DAP12 through its Lys-272 are essential for its function. When Siglec-15 expression was knocked down, fewer multinucleated cells developed, and those that did were morphologically contracted with disordered actin-ring structures. These changes were accompanied by significantly reduced bone resorption. Siglec-15 formed complexes with Syk through DAP12 in response to vitronectin. Furthermore, chimeric molecules consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane regions of Siglec-15 with a K272A mutation and the cytoplasmic region of DAP12 significantly restored bone resorption in cells with knocked down Siglec-15 expression. Together, these results suggested that the Siglec-15-DAP12-Syk-signaling cascade plays a critical role in functional osteoclast formation.

Introduction

Osteoclasts are multinucleated giant cells that resorb osseous tissue and play an essential role in bone homeostasis ( 1 ). Osteoclasts form via fusion of mononucleated precursor cells derived from the colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage lineage, branching from the monocyte-macrophage lineage early during differentiation ( 1 , 2 ). Differentiation is triggered by receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), 2 which binds receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) from osteoclast precursor cells ( 2 – 4 ). In addition to RANKL-RANK signaling, the transmembrane adaptor protein DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) and the Fc receptor common γ chain (FcRγ), each of which contains a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), contribute to functional osteoclast formation ( 5 ); DAP12-deficient mice exhibited mild osteopetrosis ( 6 ), and mice lacking both DAP12 and FcRγ were severely osteopetrotic ( 7 , 8 ), although no significant differences were observed between wild-type and FcRγ-deficient mice ( 7 ). How DAP12 transmits extracellular signals to the intracellular signaling machinery is not known, however. DAP12 is expressed as a homodimer on the cell surface and is bound to a DAP12-associated receptor (DAR) via complementarily charged amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain of each protein. DAR-DAP12 mediates the activation and maturation of myeloid lineage cells ( 9 , 10 ). Although several DARs, including TREM2, SIRPβ1, and MDL-1, are expressed in osteoclasts, the precise roles of these receptors need to be clarified ( 11 , 12 ).

We previously showed that RANKL-induced expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells 2/c1 (NFAT2 or NFATc1) is essential for osteoclast multinucleation ( 13 ). Because the transcription factor NFAT2 is also required for the development of functional osteoclasts in vivo ( 14 ), NFAT2 may regulate the expression of membrane proteins that control cell fusion and bone resorption. To understand how the RANKL-RANK-NFAT2 signaling cascade contributes to cell fusion and/or bone resorption, here we screened membrane proteins that are expressed under the control of NFAT2 using signal sequence trap by retrovirus-mediated expression (SST-REX) screening ( 15 ), and we identified Siglec-15 as a candidate protein.

The Siglec proteins are a family of lectins that recognize sialylated glycans ( 16 ). Most Siglec proteins are expressed in immune cells. They are type I membrane proteins containing one N-terminal V-set immunoglobulin domain that recognizes sialylated glycans and variable numbers of C2-set immunoglobulin domains ( 16 ). Unlike CD22 and most CD33-related Siglecs, which have one or more cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, some Siglec proteins, including Siglec-15, associate with DAP12 and the other tyrosine-based motif YINM-harboring DAP10 ( 16 , 17 ). Siglec-15, which contains one C2-set domain and is conserved among vertebrates, preferentially recognizes Neu5Acα2–6GalNAcα− structures (α(2,6)-linked sialic acid); the biologic functions of Siglec-15 are still unclear however ( 17 ). Interestingly, a recent report has suggested that α(2,6)-linked sialic acid in cell surface glycoconjugates contributes to cell fusion and bone resorption in osteoclasts ( 18 ). In this study, we examined the role of Siglec-15 as a DAR in mouse osteoclasts and found that Siglec-15 links RANKL-RANK-NFAT2 signaling with ITAM-mediated intracellular signaling cascades during functional osteoclast development.

DISCUSSION

The ITAM-bearing protein DAP12 plays an important role in osteoclast differentiation, and DAP12-deficient mice exhibit mild osteopetrosis ( 6 ). Signaling via RANKL-RANK ( 7 ), M-CSF-c-Fms ( 30 ), and ECM-αvβ3 integrin ( 31 ) triggers ITAM signaling, which is mediated by Syk tyrosine kinase, the Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav3, and phospholipase Cγ ( 7 , 31 , 32 ). How these signals stimulate ITAM signaling is still unclear however. Because DAP12 is thought to associate with DAR partner proteins, identifying DAR(s) is an important first step to elucidate DAP12-mediated signaling cascades. In this study, we identified Siglec-15 as an NFAT2 inducible under RANKL-RANK stimulation and analyzed this DAR in osteoclasts.

We showed that Siglec-15 is required for multinucleated osteoclast formation, actin rearrangement in multinucleated cells, and bone resorbing activity in a DAP12-dependent manner. Differentiation of osteoclasts with reduced Siglec-15 expression appeared normal in terms of NFAT2 expression, the phosphorylation-dependent NFAT2 band shift, and expression profiles of several marker genes. These phenotypes were consistent with DAP12-deficient osteoclasts that express comparable levels of marker genes ( 8 , 11 , 28 , 30 ). DAP12-deficient BMMs also do not form functional multinucleated cells and actin-ring structures in vitro even in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF ( 11 , 28 ), the same as osteoclasts with knocked down Siglec-15 expression. Moreover, actin-ring formation was not observed in an osteoblast coculture system ( 29 ). A Siglec-15 variant carrying the K272A mutation failed to rescue the effects of knocked down Siglec-15 expression ( Fig. 4 ). Furthermore, introduction of the SSD-KA chimera significantly rescued multinucleated cell formation, actin-ring formation, and bone resorption in cells with knocked down Siglec-15 expression ( Fig. 5 ). These results support the importance of the interaction between Siglec-15 and DAP12 for functional osteoclast formation. Because Siglec-15 also interacts with the YINM motif-bearing protein DAP10 in a Lys-272-dependent manner ( 17 ), the partial rather than full rescue observed with SSD-KA may result from the absence of YINM in the Siglec-15 complex. Additional uncharacterized domain(s) in the cytoplasmic region of Siglec-15 may also be important however.

Specificity of ligand recognition of each DAR may reflect its own characteristic property. Siglec proteins generally recognize sialylated glycans and Siglec-15 preferentially binds Neu5Acα2–6GalNAcα− structures ( 17 ). Our results clearly showed that the V-set domain of Siglec-15, which recognizes sialylated glycans, is essential, because a construct lacking the V-set domain did not rescue the defects induced by knocked down Siglec-15 expression. Interestingly, Takahata et al. reported that α(2,6)-linked sialic acid from cell surface glycoconjugates is required for polykaryon formation by osteoclasts ( 18 ). Here we showed that culturing BMMs in differentiation media containing 10 milliunits/ml SAase inhibited actin-ring formation in TRAP-positive multinucleated cells. Together, these results suggested that sialic acid binding to Siglec-15 is critical in osteoclast formation. The predominant localization of Siglec-15 on the plasma membrane and the inhibitory effects of antibody raised against the Siglec-15 extracellular domain likely reflect this observation. After we completed this study, Hinuma et al. ( 33 ) reported that anti-Siglec-15 antibody inhibited RANKL- and TNF-α-induced osteoclast formation in vitro , not only in mouse but also in human cells. These results suggest the important role of the Siglec-15 extracellular domain in human cells as well.

In addition to Siglec-15, the expression of various DARs, including TREM2, TREM3, Sirpβ1, and MDL-1, has been observed in osteoclasts ( 11 ). When BMMs were transfected with siRNA specific for MDL-1 and cultured with RANKL and M-CSF, TRAP-positive multinucleated cell formation was significantly reduced ( 6 ). Reduced TREM2 expression in the mouse RAW264 macrophage cell line also suppressed the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts in response to RANKL ( 34 ). Furthermore, differentiation of osteoclasts from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients with genetic defects in human TREM2 was reported to be impaired or delayed ( 35 , 36 ). Of note, genetic defects in human DAP12 and TREM2 result in a rare syndrome characterized by bone cysts and presenilin dementia called polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy, also known as Nasu-Hakola disease ( 37 , 38 ). However, Colonna et al. ( 39 ) reported that a lack of TREM2 in mice did not result in osteopetrosis. Histologic and metabolic analyses of bone in Siglec-15-deficient mice may elucidate the physiologic roles of Siglec-15 in vivo and expand our understanding of the roles of DARs.

In conclusion, our results show that Siglec-15 links the RANKL-RANK-NFAT2 signaling with the ITAM signaling and plays an essential role in in vitro functional osteoclast formation. These findings help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying osteoclastogenesis and bone metabolism.
