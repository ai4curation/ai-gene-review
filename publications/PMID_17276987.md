The type I, 55-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) is released from cells 
to the extracellular space where it can bind and modulate TNF bioactivity. 
Extracellular TNFR1 release occurs by two distinct pathways: the inducible 
proteolytic cleavage of TNFR1 ectodomains and the constitutive release of 
full-length TNFR1 in exosome-like vesicles. Regulation of both TNFR1 release 
pathways appears to involve the trafficking of cytoplasmic TNFR1 vesicles. 
Vesicular trafficking is controlled by ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), which 
are active in the GTP-bound state and inactive when bound to GDP. ARF activation 
is enhanced by guanine nucleotide-exchange factors that catalyze replacement of 
GDP by GTP. We investigated whether the brefeldin A (BFA)-inhibited guanine 
nucleotide-exchange proteins, BIG1 and/or BIG2, are required for TNFR1 release 
from human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Effects of specific RNA 
interference (RNAi) showed that BIG2, but not BIG1, regulated the release of 
TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles, whereas neither BIG2 nor BIG1 was required for the 
IL-1beta-induced proteolytic cleavage of TNFR1 ectodomains. BIG2 co-localized 
with TNFR1 in diffusely distributed cytoplasmic vesicles, and the association 
between BIG2 and TNFR1 was disrupted by BFA. Consistent with the preferential 
activation of class I ARFs by BIG2, ARF1 and ARF3 participated in the 
extracellular release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles in a nonredundant and 
additive fashion. We conclude that the association between BIG2 and TNFR1 
selectively regulates the extracellular release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles 
from human vascular endothelial cells via an ARF1- and ARF3-dependent mechanism.
