Human T cell activation. II. A new activation pathway used by a major T cell 
population via a disulfide-bonded dimer of a 44 kilodalton polypeptide (9.3 
antigen).

In previous studies (17-21), monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9.3 has been shown to 
react with a major population of human T cells, which include T4+ helper/inducer 
T cells and T8+ cytotoxic T cells. In this investigation, mAb 9.3 was shown to 
precipitate a disulfide-bonded dimer of a 44 kD polypeptide. Comodulation 
experiments showed that this molecule is not linked to T3/Ti or T11 antigens. 
mAb 9.3 was capable of inducing T cell proliferation in the presence of 
12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). This effect was 
monocyte-independent. T cell activation with mAb 9.3 and TPA was associated with 
increases in interleukin 2(IL-2) receptor expression and IL-2 secretion. mAb 9.3 
did not activate T cells, even with the addition of IL-1 or IL-2. Modulation of 
the T3 complex did not abolish mAb 9.3-induced T cell proliferation in the 
presence of TPA. These results suggest that the 9.3 antigen may serve as a 
receptor for an activation pathway restricted to a T cell subset.
