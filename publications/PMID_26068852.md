Host recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) initiates an 
innate immune response that is critical for pathogen elimination and engagement 
of adaptive immunity. Here we show that mammalian cells can detect and respond 
to the bacterial-derived monosaccharide heptose-1,7-bisphosphate (HBP). A 
metabolic intermediate in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, HBP is highly 
conserved in Gram-negative bacteria, yet absent from eukaryotic cells. Detection 
of HBP within the host cytosol activated the nuclear facto κB pathway in vitro 
and induced innate and adaptive immune responses in vivo. Moreover, we used a 
genome-wide RNA interference screen to uncover an innate immune signaling axis, 
mediated by phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization of the TRAF-interacting 
protein with forkhead-associated domain (TIFA) that is triggered by HBP. Thus, 
HBP is a PAMP that activates TIFA-dependent immunity to Gram-negative bacteria.
