Viral infection causes activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and 
IRF3, which collaborate to induce type I interferons (IFNs) and cellular 
antiviral response. The mitochondrial outer membrane protein VISA acts as a 
critical adapter for assembling a virus-induced complex that signals NF-kappaB 
and IRF3 activation. Using a biochemical purification approach, we identified 
the WD repeat protein WDR5 as a VISA-associated protein. WDR5 was recruited to 
VISA in a viral infection dependent manner. Viral infection also caused 
translocation of WDR5 from the nucleus to mitochondria. Knockdown of WDR5 
impaired the formation of virus-induced VISA-associated complex. Consistently,

Abstract

Viral infection causes activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and IRF3, which collaborate to induce type I interferons (IFNs) and cellular antiviral response. The mitochondrial outer membrane protein VISA acts as a critical adapter for assembling a virus-induced complex that signals NF-κB and IRF3 activation. Using a biochemical purification approach, we identified the WD repeat protein WDR5 as a VISA-associated protein. WDR5 was recruited to VISA in a viral infection dependent manner. Viral infection also caused translocation of WDR5 from the nucleus to mitochondria. Knockdown of WDR5 impaired the formation of virus-induced VISA-associated complex. Consistently, knockdown of WDR5 inhibited virus-triggered activation of IRF3 and NF-κB as well as transcription of the IFNB1 gene. These findings suggest that WDR5 is essential in assembling a virus-induced VISA-associated complex and plays an important role in virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs.

Discussion

In most cell types, infection by RNA viruses is sensed by the cytoplasmic RNA helicase proteins RIG-I and MDA5. Recognition of viral RNAs by these helicase proteins results in induction of type I IFNs and other antiviral genes ( 10 , 11 ). Elucidation of the molecular events of RIG-I and MDA5-mediated induction of type I IFNs is critical for understanding the complicated mechanisms of cellular antiviral innate immune response. Previous studies have revealed that the mitochondrial outer membrane protein VISA plays a central role in assembling a complex mediating virus-triggered IRF3 and NF-κB activation ( 13 – 16 ). However, the components of VISA-associated complex and their roles in virus-triggered signaling have not been fully defined. In this report, we identified WDR5 as a VISA-associated component required for virus-triggered activation of IRF3 and NF-κB as well as induction of IFN-β.

Previously, it has been shown that WDR5 is a component of the MLL complex, which methylates lysine 4 of histone H3 ( 26 – 28 ). EST profile analysis indicated that WDR5 was ubiquitously expressed in most tissues. Cell fractionation experiments indicated that WDR5 was more abundantly localized in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus. These observations point to a previously unrevealed cytoplasmic function of WDR5. Using a TAP purification approach, we found that WDR5 was associated with VISA. Transient transfection and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that VISA interacted with WDR5 constitutively. However, in untransfected cells, endogenous WDR5 was associated with VISA in a viral infection-dependent manner. These can be explained by two possibilities. Firstly, overexpression of VISA mimics its activation state as suggested by its ability to activate the IFN-β promoter following its overexpression. Second, overexpression may detect weak interaction. In fact, many if not most protein–protein interactions in various signal transduction pathways occur constitutively in overexpression system whereas in untransfected cells the interactions are stimulation-dependent.

Consistent with the observation that the interaction between VISA and WDR5 was viral infection dependent, viral infection caused translocation of WDR5 to the mitochondria, as revealed by both cellular fractionation and confocal microscopy experiments. Interestingly, viral infection caused down-regulation of WDR5 in the nucleus, suggesting that the mitochondrion-associated WDR5 may originate from the nucleus.

To investigate the roles of WDR5 in virus-triggered signaling, we determined the effects of WDR5 knockdown on virus-triggered IRF3 and NF-κB activation as well as induction of IFN-β. Our results indicated that knockdown of WDR5 inhibited SeV-induced activation of IRF3, NF-κB as well as IFN-β promoter, suggesting that WDR5 is required for virus-induced type I IFN signaling. Consistent with its association with VISA, knockdown of WDR5 inhibited upstream components RIG-I-, VISA-, and MITA- but not downstream component TBK1-mediated signaling. Because knockdown of WDR5 does not inhibit expression levels of RIG-I and MITA, these results together suggest that WDR5 acts downstream of RIG-I and MITA and upstream of TBK1.

Previous studies suggest that overexpression of some of the signaling components of the virus-triggered pathways can activate IRF3, NF-κB, or both. However, overexpression of WDR5 failed to activate either IRF3 or NF-κB in reporter assays. This observation is not totally unexpected in light of the observations on other molecules in the pathways. For example, it is well established that IKKγ is required for activation of NF-κB, whereas TRAF3 is required for virus-triggered IRF3 activation. However, overexpression of either IKKγ or TRAF3 does not activate NF-κB or IRF3 ( 23 , 24 , 31 ).

In our experiments, we found that knockdown of WDR5 impaired the formation of the VISA-associated complex, providing an explanation of the critical role of WDR5 in virus-triggered type I IFN signaling. Knockdown of WDR5 caused down-regulation of RIG-I and MITA levels in the mitochondria after viral infection, whereas the whole cellular levels of RIG-I and MITA were unchanged after WDR5 knockdown. The simplest explanation for these observations is that WDR5 is important for recruiting RIG-I and MITA to the VISA-associated complex on the mitochondrial membrane. Knockdown of WDR5 also impaired the association of VISA with TRAF3 or TRAF6 at the mitochondria. However, the levels of TRAF3 and TRAF6 in the mitochondria were not markedly changed after WDR5 knockdown. These results suggest that WDR5 is not involved in recruiting TRAF3 and TRAF6 to the mitochondria; instead, it is important for the interactions between VISA and TRAF3 or TRAF6. In conclusion, the identification of WDR5 as a component essential for assembly of VISA-associated complex after viral infection provides insights to the molecular mechanisms of virus-triggered type I IFN signaling and cellular antiviral response.
