Branching morphogenesis of fetal mouse submandibular glands (SMGs) partly 
depends on the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor that triggers at least 
three intracellular signaling pathways involving (1) the mitogen-activated 
protein kinases ERK-1/2, (2) phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLCgamma1), and (3) 
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). PLCgamma1 directly activates protein 
kinase C (PKC) isozymes; PI3K stimulates protein kinase B (PKB, also known as 
Akt), which ultimately activates PKCs and other proteins. We reported that the 
pattern of phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 in response to EGF in SMGs varies with 
fetal age and that blockade of EGF-stimulated ERK-1/2 signaling partially 
inhibits branching (Kashimata et al. [2000] Dev. Biol. 220:183-196). Here, we 
report on components of the PLCgamma1, PI3K, and PKC families of signaling 
molecules in fetal SMGs from the 13th day of gestation to postnatal ages. 
Western blotting revealed that (1) PLCgamma1 is present from E13 to E18 but 
drops off precipitously to negligible levels on the day of birth and thereafter, 
and (2) PI3K, PKB(Akt), and several PKC isozymes are expressed from E13 onward 
through adult life. Both PLCgamma1 and PI3K are phosphorylated in response to 
EGF. Inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 inhibited EGF-stimulated branching, but 
inhibition of PLCgamma1 by U73122 had no effect. Western blotting showed that 
the concentrations of 8 PKC isozymes vary with age in the fetal and postnatal 
SMG. However, general inhibition of PKCs by Calphostin C or specific inhibition 
of PKCalpha or of PKCepsilon by Gö6976 or Ro-32-0432, respectively, increased 
EGF-stimulated branching. Calphostin C also increased EGF-stimulated 
phosphorylation of ERK-1/2. These findings indicate that signaling from the EGF 
receptor in the fetal mouse SMG varies with development and triggers stimulatory 
effects by means of ERK-1/2 and PI3K but inhibitory effects by means of PKC 
isozymes.
