Auxin response factors (ARFs) bind auxin response promoter elements and mediate 
transcriptional responses to auxin. Five of the 22 ARF genes in Arabidopsis 
thaliana encode ARFs with glutamine-rich middle domains. Four of these can 
activate transcription and have been ascribed developmental functions. We show 
that ARF19, the fifth Q-rich ARF, also activates transcription. Mutations in 
ARF19 have little effect on their own, but in combination with mutations in 
NPH4/ARF7, encoding the most closely related ARF, they cause several phenotypes 
including a drastic decrease in lateral and adventitious root formation and a 
decrease in leaf cell expansion. These results indicate that auxin induces 
lateral roots and leaf expansion by activating NPH4/ARF7 and ARF19. Auxin 
induces the ARF19 gene, and NPH4/ARF7 and ARF19 together are required for 
expression of one of the arf19 mutant alleles, suggesting that a positive 
feedback loop regulates leaf expansion and/or lateral root induction.
