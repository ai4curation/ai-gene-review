Recent studies indicate that p50(cdc37) facilitates Hsp90-mediated biogenesis of 
certain protein kinases. In this report, we examined whether p50(cdc37) is 
required for the biogenesis of the heme-regulated eIF2 alpha kinase (HRI) in 
reticulocyte lysate. p50(cdc37) interacted with nascent HRI co-translationally 
and this interaction persisted during the maturation and activation of HRI. 
p50(cdc37) stimulated HRI's activation in response to heme deficiency, but did 
not activate HRI per se. p50(cdc37) function was specific to immature and 
inactive forms of the kinase. Analysis of mutant Cdc37 gene products indicated 
that the N-terminal portion of p50(cdc37) interacted with immature HRI, but not 
with Hsp90, while the C-terminal portion of p50(cdc37) interacted with Hsp90. 
The Hsp90-specific inhibitor geldanamycin disrupted the ability of both Hsp90 
and p50(cdc37) to bind HRI and promote its activation, but did not disrupt the 
native association of p50(cdc37) with Hsp90. A C-terminal truncated mutant of 
p50(cdc37) inhibited HRI's activation, prevented the interaction of Hsp90 with 
HRI, and bound to HRI irrespective of geldanamycin treatment. Additionally, 
native complexes of HRI with p50(cdc37) were detected in cultured K562 
erythroleukemia cells. These results suggest that p50(cdc37) provides an 
activity essential to HRI biogenesis via a process regulated by 
nucleotide-mediated conformational switching of its partner Hsp90.
