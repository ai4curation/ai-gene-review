Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are thought to function as critical mediators of 
transcriptional repression. However, the physiological targets and 
posttranslational modifications of the class II HDACs are largely unknown. Here 
we show that the C terminus of HDAC 6 is both necessary and sufficient for 
specific association with polyubiquitin. This region contains a putative zinc 
finger but lacks significant similarity to other known ubiquitin binding 
domains. Thus, we have designated this region as a PAZ domain, for Polyubiquitin 
Associated Zinc finger. Although the PAZ domain possesses homology with the zinc 
finger of deubiquitinating enzymes, it is dispensable for the deubiquitinating 
activity we find associated with HDAC6 following immunopurification. We also 
show that both HDAC 5 and HDAC 6 are ubiquitinated in vitro and in vivo. 
However, both of these proteins are stable in vivo and do not appear to be 
targeted for rapid degradation by the proteasome. Thus, HDAC6 is linked to the 
ubiquitin system via ubiquitin conjugation, polyubiquitin binding, and 
copurification with deubiquitinating enzymes.
