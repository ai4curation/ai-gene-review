Numerous studies indicate that Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a mammalian nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC), plays a 
crucial role in p53-mediated stress responses by deacetylating p53. 
Nevertheless, the acetylation levels of p53 are dramatically increased upon DNA 
damage, and it is not well understood how the SIRT1-p53 interaction is regulated 
during the stress responses. Here, we identified Set7/9 as a unique regulator of 
SIRT1. SIRT1 interacts with Set7/9 both in vitro and in vivo. In response to DNA 
damage in human cells, the interaction between Set7/9 and SIRT1 is significantly 
enhanced and coincident with an increase in p53 acetylation levels. Importantly, 
the interaction of SIRT1 and p53 is strongly suppressed in the presence of 
Set7/9. Consequently, SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53 is abrogated by 
Set7/9, and p53-mediated transactivation is increased during the DNA damage 
response. Of note, whereas SIRT1 can be methylated at multiple sites within its 
N terminus by Set7/9, a methylation-defective mutant of SIRT1 still retains its 
ability to inhibit p53 activity. Taken together, our results reveal that Set7/9 
is a critical regulator of the SIRT1-p53 interaction and suggest that Set7/9 can 
modulate p53 function indirectly in addition to acting through a 
methylation-dependent mechanism.

Abstract

Numerous studies indicate that Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a mammalian nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + )-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC), plays a crucial role in p53-mediated stress responses by deacetylating p53. Nevertheless, the acetylation levels of p53 are dramatically increased upon DNA damage, and it is not well understood how the SIRT1–p53 interaction is regulated during the stress responses. Here, we identified Set7/9 as a unique regulator of SIRT1. SIRT1 interacts with Set7/9 both in vitro and in vivo. In response to DNA damage in human cells, the interaction between Set7/9 and SIRT1 is significantly enhanced and coincident with an increase in p53 acetylation levels. Importantly, the interaction of SIRT1 and p53 is strongly suppressed in the presence of Set7/9. Consequently, SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53 is abrogated by Set7/9, and p53-mediated transactivation is increased during the DNA damage response. Of note, whereas SIRT1 can be methylated at multiple sites within its N terminus by Set7/9, a methylation-defective mutant of SIRT1 still retains its ability to inhibit p53 activity. Taken together, our results reveal that Set7/9 is a critical regulator of the SIRT1-p53 interaction and suggest that Set7/9 can modulate p53 function indirectly in addition to acting through a methylation-dependent mechanism.

Discussion

The data presented in this study provide evidence that the histone methyltransferase Set7/9 interacts with SIRT1 in vitro and in vivo. Although Set7/9 catalyses methylation of SIRT1 at several lysine sites, this methylation does not affect its deacetylase activity. However, the interaction of Set7/9 with SIRT1 does facilitate dissociation of SIRT1 from p53, with consequent enhancement of both p53 acetylation at K382 and p53-mediated transactivation in response to DNA damage.

Posttranslational modifications of SIRT1 influence SIRT1 activity ( 15 , 16 , 24 – 26 ). In view of our demonstration of a SIRT1–Set7/9 interaction, we also confirmed by autoradiography and mass spectrometry that Set7/9 catalyzes SIRT1 methylation. However, the Set7/9-catalyzed methylation of SIRT1 did not influence SIRT1 deacetylase activity. Functionally, the methylation of SIRT1 is different from the other posttranslational modifications of SIRT1. For example, SIRT1 is sumoylated at lysine 734, with a resultant increase in activity, in the human lung cancer cell line H1299, but desumoylated at this site by the nuclear desumoylase SENP1, with a resultant decrease in deactealyse activity, in response to UV or oxidative stresses ( 16 ). In addition, SIRT1 is phosphorylated at threonine 522 by the nuclear protein kinase DYRK1A upon treatment of cells with the DNA-damaging agent etoposide, which results in increased SIRT1 deacetylase activity ( 26 ). Similarly, phosphorylation of SIRT1 serine residues appears to enhance SIRT1 deacetylase activity. Thus, in response to ionizing radiation, SIRT1 is phosphorylated at several serines by casein kinase 2 (CK2) in HeLa cells; this modification results in increased SIRT1 deacetylase activity and subsequent induction of p53 deacetylation and protection of cells from apoptotic cell death ( 25 ). Although Set7/9 was found in the present study to catalyze the methylation of SIRT1 lysines 233, 235, 236, and 238 without any observed effect on deacetylase activity, we cannot exclude the possibility that the methylation of other lysines by another methyltransferase might influence SIRT1 activity or that the observed methylation events might regulate SIRT1 activity in another context.

Set7/9 has been reported to methylate p53, pRB, and DNMT1 ( 19 , 21 , 22 , 27 ). However, Set7/9 methylation is not always related to functional changes of targeted molecules. For example, Set7/9 interacts with Pdx1, an insulin transactivator, and catalyzes Pdx1 methylation. Although the interaction of Pdx1 with Set7/9 is able to recruit Set7/9 to histone H3 and induce H3K4 methylation ( 28 , 29 ), the methylation of Pdx1 is not directly associated with changes in Pdx1 function. In addition, although the methylation of DNMT1 leads to a decrease in the half-life of DNMT1, this modification is also not directly related to changes in DNMT1 methyltransferase activity ( 21 , 30 ). Similarly, results in our study confirmed that methylation of SIRT1 did not change its function or its half-life (data not shown).

The interaction of DBC1 with SIRT1 decreases SIRT1 activity, whereas AROS has an opposite effect. DBC1 binds directly to the middle fragment of SIRT1 to block the catalytic domain of SIRT1, which in turn negatively regulates SIRT1 activity ( 12 , 13 ). In contrast to DBC1, AROS binds to the noncatalytic domain of SIRT1 and subsequently increases SIRT1 activity ( 14 ). Although we showed here that the methylation of SIRT1 by Set7/9 did not affect its deacetylase activity, a direct interaction between these proteins was critical for the regulation of SIRT1 deacetylase activity on p53 because this interaction was also required for the dissociation of SIRT1 from p53 ( Fig. 5 B ). It is unclear how the interaction between SIRT1 and Set7/9 influences the association of SIRT1 and p53. However, among other possibilities, this could reflect either a Set7/9-induced conformational change in SIRT1 that prevents SIRT1 from binding to p53 or a direct competition between Set7/9 and p53 for binding to SIRT1.

Our study reveals that exposure of cells to Adr results in a significantly decreased SIRT1 deacetylase activity on p53 concurrent with an increased SIRT1–Set7/9 interaction. The decreased SIRT1 activity on p53 results from the interaction of SIRT1 and Set7/9 because increased p53 acetylation was observed with WT-Set7/9 but not with a mutant Set7/9 that shows a significantly decreased ability to bind SIRT1. The p53 methylation at K372 by Set7/9 was partly associated with p53K382 acetylation and p53 activity because p53 acetylation or transactivation of the downstream target p21 promoter was decreased in cells expressing a mutant p53K372R relative to a p53WT. However, and importantly, overexpressed Set7/9 still effected a significant enhancement both of p53K382 acetylation and p53-dependent activation in p53K372R-transfected cells, which suggests that, in addition to methylating p53 at K372, Set7/9 may function on other p53-related proteins and, thus, induce changes in p53 transactivation. In this regard, the present results show that Set7/9 regulates p53 activity indirectly by negatively regulating SIRT1. Therefore, although the p53 methylation mediated by Set7/9 may contribute to the p53 transactivation potential, the interaction of SIRT1 and Set7/9 may have a more critical role in enhancing p53 activity. In addition, the interaction of SIRT1 and Set7/9 may explain why Set7/9 knockdown induces p53 deacetylation at K382 ( 31 , 32 ), thus providing the mechanistic basis for linking p53 methylation at K372 to p53 acetylation at K382.

In conclusion, our data show that Set7/9 negatively regulates SIRT1, which results in an increased acetylation of p53 at K382. A more complete understanding how SIRT1 is regulated and how it in turn regulates its downstream targets will be valuable in designing new anticancer therapies.
