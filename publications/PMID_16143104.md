A balance in the activities of the Ipl Aurora kinase and the Glc7 phosphatase is 
essential for normal chromosome segregation in yeast. We report here that this 
balance is modulated by the Set1 methyltransferase. Deletion of SET1 suppresses 
chromosome loss in ipl1-2 cells. Conversely, combination of SET1 and GLC7 
mutations is lethal. Strikingly, these effects are independent of previously 
defined functions for Set1 in transcription initiation and histone H3 
methylation. We find that Set1 is required for methylation of conserved lysines 
in a kinetochore protein, Dam1. Biochemical and genetic experiments indicate 
that Dam1 methylation inhibits Ipl1-mediated phosphorylation of flanking 
serines. Our studies demonstrate that Set1 has important, unexpected functions 
in mitosis. Moreover, our findings suggest that antagonism between lysine 
methylation and serine phosphorylation is a fundamental mechanism for 
controlling protein function.
