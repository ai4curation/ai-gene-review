Silencing within the yeast rDNA repeats inhibits hyperrecombination, represses 
transcription from foreign promoters, and extends replicative life span. rDNA 
silencing is mediated by a Sir2-containing complex called RENT (regulator of 
nucleolar silencing and telophase exit). We show that the Net1 (also called 
Cfi1) and Sir2 subunits of RENT localize primarily to two distinct regions 
within rDNA: in one of the nontranscribed spacers (NTS1) and around the Pol I 
promoter, extending into the 35S rRNA coding region. Binding to NTS1 overlaps 
the recombination hotspot and replication fork barrier elements, which have been 
shown previously to require the Fob1 protein for their activities. In cells 
lacking Fob1, silencing and the association of RENT subunits are abolished 
specifically at NTS1, while silencing and association at the Pol I promoter 
region are unaffected or increased. We find that Net1 and Sir2 are physically 
associated with Fob1 and subunits of RNA polymerase I. Together with the 
localization data, these results suggest the existence of two distinct modes for 
the recruitment of the RENT complex to rDNA and reveal a role for Fob1 in rDNA 
silencing and in the recruitment of the RENT complex. Furthermore, the 
Fob1-dependent associations of Net1 and Sir2 with the recombination hotspot 
region strongly suggest that Sir2 acts directly at this region to carry out its 
inhibitory effect on rDNA recombination and accelerated aging.
