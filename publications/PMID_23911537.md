Ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) is known to play critical roles in ribosome 
biogenesis and DNA repair. When cellular ROS levels increase, the mitochondrial 
genes are highly vulnerable to DNA damage. Increased ROS induces rpS3 
accumulation in the mitochondria for DNA repair while significantly decreasing 
the cellular protein synthesis. For the entrance into the mitochondria, the 
accumulation of rpS3 was regulated by interaction with HSP90, HSP70, and TOM70. 
Pretreatment with geldanamycin, which binds to the ATP pocket of HSP90, 
significantly decreased the interaction of rpS3 with HSP90 and stimulated the 
accumulation of rpS3 in the mitochondria. Furthermore, cellular ROS was 
decreased and mtDNA damage was rescued when levels of rpS3 were increased in the 
mitochondria. Therefore, we concluded that when mitochondrial DNA damages 
accumulate due to increased levels of ROS, rpS3 accumulates in the mitochondria 
to repair damaged DNA due to the decreased interaction between rpS3 and HSP90 in 
the cytosol.
