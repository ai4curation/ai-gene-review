The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system comprises a 
series of protein complexes that play essential roles in multivesicular body 
(MVB) sorting of ubiquitylated membrane proteins, enveloped RNA virus budding, 
and cytokinesis in mammalian cells. The complex, named ESCRT-I, consists of four 
subunits (TSG101, VPS28, VPS37, and MVB12). There are four VPS37 isoforms. We 
have reported that ALIX (an ALG-2-interacting protein and accessory protein in 
the ESCRT system) is physically linked with TSG101 by ALG-2 in a Ca²⁺-dependent 
manner, but the role of ALG-2 as an adaptor protein for the ESCRT-I complex 
remains unknown. To characterize this adaptor function, initially we 
investigated the binding of ALG-2 to ESCRT-I complexes containing each one of 
the four different VPS37 isoforms by two approaches: first, Far-Western blot 
analysis with biotin-labeled ALG-2 probe, and second, a pulldown assay to 
determine the binding of the four recombinant ESCRT-I complexes to Strep-tagged 
ALG-2 after co-expression in HEK293T cells. VPS37B and VPS37C appeared to 
interact with ALG-2 in a stronger manner than TSG101 does. The results of in 
vitro binding assays using purified recombinant proteins indicated that ALG-2 
functions as a Ca²⁺-dependent adaptor protein that bridges ALIX and ESCRT-I to 
form a ternary complex, ESCRT-I/ALIX/ALG-2.
