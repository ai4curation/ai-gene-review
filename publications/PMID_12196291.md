B7-1 and B7-2 are generally thought to have comparable structures and affinities 
for their receptors, CD28 and CTLA-4, each of which is assumed to be bivalent. 
We show instead (1) that B7-2 binds the two receptors more weakly than B7-1, (2) 
that, relative to its CTLA-4 binding affinity, B7-2 binds CD28 2- to 3-fold more 
effectively than B7-1, (3) that, unlike B7-1, B7-2 does not self-associate, and 
(4) that, in contrast to CTLA-4 homodimers, which are bivalent, CD28 homodimers 
are monovalent. Our results indicate that B7-1 markedly favors CTLA-4 over CD28 
engagement, whereas B7-2 exhibits much less bias. We propose that the distinct 
structures and binding properties of B7-1 and B7-2 account for their overlapping 
but distinct effects on T cell responses.
