T-cell receptor (TCR)-induced T-cell activation is a critical event in adaptive 
immune responses. The engagement of TCR complex by antigen along with the 
activation of the costimulatory receptors trigger a cascade of intracellular 
signaling, in which caspase recruitment domain-containing membrane-associated 
guanylate kinase 1 (CARMA1) is a crucial scaffold protein. Upon stimulation, 
CARMA1 recruits downstream molecules including B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (Bcl10), 
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1), and 
TRAF6 to assemble a specific TCR-induced signalosome that triggers NF-κB and JNK 
activation. In this report, we identified protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) as a 
CARMA1-associated protein by a biochemical affinity purification approach. PKCδ 
interacted with CARMA1 in TCR stimulation-dependent manner in Jurkat T cells. 
Overexpression of PKCδ inhibited CARMA1-mediated NF-κB activation, whereas 
knockdown of PKCδ potentiated TCR-triggered NF-κB activation and IL-2 secretion 
in Jurkat T cells. Reconstitution experiments with PKCδ kinase-dead mutant 
indicated that the kinase activity of PKCδ was dispensable for its ability to 
inhibit TCR-triggered NF-κB activation. Furthermore, we found that PKCδ 
inhibited the interaction between MALT1 and TRAF6, but not the association of 
CARMA1 with PKCθ, Bcl10, or MALT1. These observations suggest that PKCδ is a 
negative regulator in T cell activation through inhibiting the assembly of 
CARMA1 signalosome.

Introduction

TCR-induced activation of T cells plays a central role in adaptive immune responses. Activated T cells undergo clonal expansion, differentiation, and begin to execute their immunological functions either by producing cytokines for regulating immune responses or by killing target cells infected with pathogens directly. The tightly controlled activation of transcription factors of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) 4 family plays a crucial role in these processes ( 1 ).

TCR-induced activation of NF-κB signaling pathway is initiated from the interaction of TCR with specific antigen in the context of MHC and costimulation of CD28 by its ligands on antigen-presenting cells. Upon stimulation, a cascade of tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling components is successively triggered, which results in the recruitment and activation of a number of signaling proteins, including phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) ( 2 ). PDK1 phosphorylates PKCθ and recruits it to lipid rafts in the plasma membrane ( 3 ). Concurrently PDK1 recruits CARMA1 to lipid rafts. Phosphorylated PKCθ phosphorylates the close-by CARMA1 at specific serine residues, and leads to the conformational changes of CARMA1 from an inactive form to an active one ( 4 – 6 ). Active CARMA1 assembles a CBM complex by associating with Bcl10, which in turn recruits MALT1 ( 7 , 8 ). The CBM complex subsequently recruits downstream signal proteins, such as TRAF6, caspase 8, and TAK1, to collaboratively activate the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) complex. IκB is then phosphorylated and undergoes degradation, which leads to the activation of NF-κB.

Among the CBM signalosome, the scaffold protein CARMA1 is crucial for the recruitment of downstream signal proteins, as well as their plasma membrane localization ( 9 – 11 ). Its activity requires fine tuning to elicit proper activation of NF-κB. Posttranscriptional modifications of CARMA1, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, determine the outcome of TCR stimulation. For examples, kinases such as PKCθ, IKKβ, Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 can phosphorylate CARMA1 at different serine residues in the PKC-regulated domain (PRD), and subsequently lead to NF-κB activation ( 4 , 5 , 12 – 14 ). However, casein kinase 1α phosphorylates CARMA1 at S608, which impairs its ability to activate NF-κB ( 15 ). In addition, monoubiquitination of CARMA1 catalyzed by Cbl-b disrupts the formation of CBM complex ( 16 ). Although much has been reported, the subtle regulation of CARMA1 signalosome remains not so clear thus far.

To identify potential regulators of CARMA1-mediated NF-κB activation, we performed biochemical affinity purification with CARMA1 as a bait protein, and identified PKCδ as a protein specifically associated with CARMA1. Knockdown of PKCδ accelerated TCR-induced NF-κB activation and IL-2 secretion, suggesting an inhibitory role of PKCδ in TCR-mediated NF-κB activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the kinase activity of PKCδ was not required for its inhibitory role. Instead, PKCδ inhibited TCR-induced NF-κB activation by steric hindrance of recruiting TRAF6 to CARMA1 signalosome.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we investigated the role of PKCδ in NF-κB activation in T cells and reported several observations. First, PKCδ participates in the negative control of TCR-induced NF-κB activation. Second, the kinase activity of PKCδ is dispensable for the negative regulation. Third, PKCδ is recruited to CARMA1 upon TCR stimulation, and inhibits the subsequent recruitment of TRAF6 by MALT1.

T lymphocytes express multiple PKC isoforms, among which PKCθ is considered as the most important isoform participating in T cell activation ( 19 ). It is essential for CARMA1 phosphorylation and further NF-κB activation. It also phosphorylates RapGEF2 and enhances T cell adhesion ( 20 ). Although PKCθ was reported to be the only PKC isoform translocated to immunological synapse after TCR stimulation ( 21 – 23 ), more evidences suggest that other PKCs, such as PKCα, also translocate to the plasma membrane upon TCR stimulation and possibly participate in T cell activation ( 24 ). Besides, PKCζ and PKCι are PKCθ-associated PKCs in T cells, and possibly assist in PKCθ-mediated signaling ( 25 ). In contrast to these PKCs, PKCδ is reported to serve a negative role in TCR-induced IL-2 cytokine production and T cell proliferation ( 26 ). However, the mechanism of this negative regulation is not clear so far.

By identifying the CARMA1-associated proteins, we found that PKCδ dynamically interacted with CARMA1 and was translocated to the plasma membrane in a TCR stimulation-dependent manner. It has been shown that following TCR ligation, PKCδ is rapidly phosphorylated at Thr-505 on the activation loop ( 17 , 27 ). This phosphorylation leads to the activation of PKCδ, which regulates lytic granule exocytosis in CTLs in a kinase-dependent manner ( 17 ). In this study, however, we found that the kinase activity of PKCδ was not required for its regulation of TCR-induced NF-κB activation, because the promotion of either IκB phosphorylation or IL-2 production in PKCδ-knockdown Jurkat T cells could be reversed by reconstitution with kinase-dead mutant of PKCδ, similar to wild-type PKCδ. These surprising findings suggest that negative regulation of TCR-signaling by PKCδ may be mediated through steric hindrance of the assembly of CARMA1 signalosome.

Although PKCδ and PKCθ share high protein sequence homology, they are associated with different region of CARMA1: PKCδ interacts with the MAGUK region, and PKCθ interacts with the PRD region. These findings indicated that PKCδ did not function through competitive binding to CARMA1 with PKCθ, which was confirmed by our competitive binding assays. Upon TCR stimulation, phosphorylated CARMA1 forms a CBM complex with Bcl10 and MALT1. Then MALT1 directly recruits TRAF6 and TAK1 into the CARMA1 signalosome ( 28 , 29 ). TRAF6 functions as an E3 ligase to catalyze the K63-linked polyubiquitination of MALT1, Bcl10, and IKKγ, and thus promotes signaling to NF-κB activation ( 28 , 30 ). Our results showed that PKCδ had no apparent effect on the association of CARMA1 with PKCθ, Bcl10, or MALT1. Instead, PKCδ inhibited the interaction between MALT1 and TRAF6 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas knockdown of PKCδ enhanced the TCR-induced recruitment of endogenous TRAF6 to MALT1. These results provide an explanation for the inhibitory role of PKCδ in TCR-induced NF-κB activation: PKCδ is recruited to CARMA1 signalosome upon TCR stimulation and inhibits the recruitment of essential downstream signal components, such as TRAF6.

PKCδ-deficient mice were reported to be susceptible to autoimmune disease, indicating that PKCδ plays a regulatory role in immune systems. Although the development of immune organs in PKCδ-deficient mice appears to be normal, cultured PKCδ-deficient lymphocytes, both B and T cells, display enhanced proliferation in response to various mitogenic stimuli ( 26 , 31 ). Since signal transduction from antigen receptors in both B and T cells to NF-κB shares the same downstream signaling events through CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex, our results might also explain the enhanced proliferation of PKCδ-deficient B cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that PKCδ negatively regulates TCR-induced NF-κB activation and IL-2 production by inhibiting the assembly of CARMA1 signalosome.
