Two genes encode Fc gamma RIII (CD16), a low affinity FcR for IgG. CD16-I is 
expressed as a phosphatidylinositol glycan-anchored membrane glycoprotein on 
neutrophils, whereas CD16-II is a transmembrane-linked glycoprotein on NK cells. 
Membrane anchoring is determined by codon 203. Site-directed mutation of codon 
203 and transient expression of these cDNA in COS-7 cells indicated that Phe, 
Ile, Leu, and Val permit transmembrane expression, whereas Ser, Thr, Tyr, Asn, 
Gly, Ala, Asp and Lys enable phosphatidylinositol-glycan attachment. Thus, the 
involvement of amino acid 203 in membrane anchoring cannot be explained simply 
on the basis of size, charge, or polarity of the amino acid side groups at this 
site. Efficient expression of CD16-II in COS-7 cells requires co-transfection 
with either CD3 zeta or Fc epsilon RI-gamma. Truncation of the cytoplasmic 
segment of CD16 failed to affect association with CD3 zeta. CD3 zeta and Fc 
epsilon RI-gamma with truncated cytoplasmic segments were also able to 
facilitate membrane expression of CD16-II, implicating the transmembrane 
segments as the interaction site between CD16-II and CD3 zeta or Fc epsilon 
RI-gamma. Prior studies have suggested that the acidic residue in the CD3 zeta 
transmembrane segment may be important for the association of CD3 zeta 
complexes. Although site-directed mutation of CD3 zeta-Asp36 to Glu, Leu, or Val 
retained the ability to permit membrane expression of CD16-II, quantitatively 
the wild-type CD3 zeta-Asp36 provided optimal levels of expression, consistent 
with conservation of this amino acid in mouse and human CD3 zeta.
