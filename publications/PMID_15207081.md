AIM: To clone full length cDNA of human interleukin-21 (IL-21) and express it in 
E.coli.
METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from peripheral lymphocyte stimulated with 
anti-CD3 antibody. 5' and 3' terminal fragments of IL-21 gene (242 bp and 425 bp 
fragments respectively) were amplified using RT-PCR. The full length IL-21 cDNA 
was amplified by recombination PCR from the products of RT-PCR. The expression 
plasmid pET28a(+)-IL21 was constructed by inserting IL-21 cDNA into pET28a(+)and 
then was transformed into BL21(DE3). Expression of hIL-21 was induced by IPTG at 
37 degrees Celsius for 5 h. The target protein was purified through 
Ni(2+)-chelating Sepharose Fast Flow. Purified rhIL-21 was refolded by using 
dialysis method. And the bioactivity was detected by MTT on costimulating the T 
cell proliferation with anti-CD3.
RESULTS: IL-21 was cloned and expressed in E.coli successfully. SDS-PAGE 
analysis showed the IL-21 was expressed in the form of insoluble inclusion body. 
The refolded rhIL-21 could stimulate the proliferation of mature human T-cells 
in the presence of anti-CD3.
CONCLUSION: The rhIL-21 with bioactivity was obtained, which lays the foundation 
for study of its function.
