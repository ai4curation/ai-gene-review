The heat shock protein Hsp104 of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae plays a key 
role in promoting survival at extreme temperatures. We found that when diverse 
higher plant species are exposed to high temperatures they accumulate proteins 
that are antigenically related to Hsp104. We isolated a cDNA corresponding to 
one of these proteins from Arabidopsis. The protein, AtHSP101, is 43% identical 
to yeast Hsp104. DNA gel blot analysis indicated that AtHSP101 is encoded by a 
single- or low-copy number gene. AtHsp101 mRNA was undetectable in the absence 
of stress but accumulated to high levels during exposure to high temperatures. 
When AtHSP101 was expressed in yeast, it complemented the thermotolerance defect 
caused by a deletion of the HSP104 gene. The ability of AtHSP101 to protect 
yeast from severe heat stress strongly suggests that this HSP plays an important 
role in thermotolerance in higher plants.

The heat shock protein Hsp104 of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae plays a key role in promoting survival at extreme temperatures. We found that when diverse higher plant species are exposed to high temperatures they accumulate proteins that are antigenically related to Hsp104. We isolated a cDNA corresponding to one of these proteins from Arabidopsis. The protein, AtHSP101, is 43% identical to yeast Hsp104. DNA gel blot analysis indicated that AtHSP101 is encoded by a single- or low-copy number gene. AtHsp101 mRNA was undetectable in the absence of stress but accumulated to high levels during exposure to high temperatures. When AtHSP101 was expressed in yeast, it complemented the thermotolerance defect caused by a deletion of the HSP104 gene. The ability of AtHSP101 to protect yeast from severe heat stress strongly suggests that this HSP plays an important role in thermotolerance in higher plants.
