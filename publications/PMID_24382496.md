ATP-independent small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs) are an essential component of 
the cellular chaperoning machinery. Under both normal and stress conditions, 
sHSPs bind partially unfolded proteins and prevent their irreversible 
aggregation. Canonical vertebrate sHSPs, such as the α-crystallins, form large 
polydisperse oligomers from which smaller, functionally active subspecies 
dissociate. Here we focus on human HSPB6 which, despite having considerable 
homology to the α-crystallins in both the N-terminal region and the signature 
α-crystallin domain (ACD), only forms dimers in solution that represent the 
basic chaperoning subspecies. We addressed the three-dimensional structure and 
functional properties of HSPB6 in a hybrid study employing X-ray 
crystallography, solution small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), mutagenesis, 
size-exclusion chromatography and chaperoning assays. The crystal structure of a 
proteolytically stable fragment reveals typical ACD dimers which further form 
tetrameric assemblies as a result of extensive inter-dimer patching of the β4/β8 
grooves. The patching is surprisingly mediated by tripeptide motifs, found in 
the N-terminal domain directly adjacent to the ACD, that are resembling but 
distinct from the canonical IxI sequence commonly binding this groove. By 
combining the crystal structure with SAXS data for the full-length protein, we 
derive a molecular model of the latter. In solution, HSPB6 shows a strong 
attractive self-interaction, a property that correlates with its chaperoning 
activity. Both properties are dictated by the unstructured yet compact 
N-terminal domain, specifically a region highly conserved across vertebrate 
sHSPs.
