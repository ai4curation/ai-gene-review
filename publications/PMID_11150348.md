Dopamine is known to regulate several behavioral phenomena, including 
sensorimotor gating and aspects of motor activity. The roles of dopamine D1 and 
D2 receptors in these behaviors have been documented in the rat literature, but 
few reports exist on their role in mice. We used dopamine transporter (DAT) 
(-/-) mice to examine the behavioral consequences of a chronically 
hyperdopaminergic state, challenging them with the preferential dopamine D2 
receptor antagonist raclopride and D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390. At baseline, 
DAT (-/-) mice exhibited deficient sensorimotor gating as measured by prepulse 
inhibition (PPI) of the startle response, exhibited nonfocal preservative 
patterns of locomotion, and were hyperactive in a novel environment. 
Pretreatment with raclopride significantly increased PPI in the DAT (-/-) mice, 
whereas SCH23390 had no significant effect. Blockade of D2 receptors did not 
affect the predominantly straight patterns of motor behavior produced by the DAT 
(-/-) mice, but antagonism of D1 receptors significantly attenuated the 
preservative patterns, producing more of a meandering behavior seen in the DAT 
(+/+) control mice. Both D1 and D2 receptor antagonists decreased the 
hyperactivity seen in the DAT (-/-) mice. These findings support the role of the 
D2, but not the D1, receptor in the modulation of PPI in mice. Furthermore, D1 
receptor activation appears to be the critical substrate for the expression of 
preservative patterns of motor behavior, whereas both D1 and D2 receptors appear 
to regulate the amount of motor activity.
