The body size of Caenorhabditis elegans is thought to be controlled by sensory 
inputs because many mutants with sensory cilium structure defects exhibit small 
body size. The EGL-4 cGMP-dependent protein kinase acts in sensory neurons to 
reduce body size when animals fail to perceive sensory signals. In addition to 
body size control, EGL-4 regulates various other behavioral and developmental 
pathways, including those involved in the regulation of egg laying and 
chemotaxis behavior. Here we have identified gcy-12, which encodes a 
receptor-type guanylyl cyclase, as a gene involved in the sensory regulation of 
body size. Analyses with GFP fusion constructs showed that gcy-12 is expressed 
in several sensory neurons and localizes to sensory cilia. Genetic analyses 
indicated that GCY-12 acts upstream of EGL-4 in body size control but does not 
affect other EGL-4 functions. Our studies indicate that the function of the 
GCY-12 guanylyl cyclase is to provide cGMP to the EGL-4 cGMP-dependent kinase 
only for limited tasks including body size regulation. We also found that the 
PDE-2 cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase negatively regulates EGL-4 in 
controlling body size. Thus, the cGMP level is precisely controlled by GCY-12 
and PDE-2 to determine body size through EGL-4, and the defects in the sensory 
cilium structure may disturb the balanced control of the cGMP level. The large 
number of guanylyl cyclases encoded in the C. elegans genome suggests that EGL-4 
exerts pleiotropic effects by partnering with different guanylyl cyclases for 
different downstream functions.
