Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), a disease marked by chronic iron overload from 
insufficient expression of the hormone hepcidin, is one of the most common 
genetic diseases. One form of HH (type III) results from mutations in 
transferrin receptor-2 (TfR2). TfR2 is postulated to be a part of signaling 
system that is capable of modulating hepcidin expression. However, the molecular 
details of TfR2's role in this system remain unclear. TfR2 is predicted to bind 
the iron carrier transferrin (Tf) when the iron saturation of Tf is high. To 
better understand the nature of these TfR-Tf interactions, a binding study with 
the full-length receptors was conducted. In agreement with previous studies with 
truncated forms of these receptors, holo-Tf binds to the TfR1 homologue 
significantly stronger than to TfR2. However, the binding constant for Tf-TfR2 
is still far above that of physiological holo-Tf levels, inconsistent with the 
hypothetical model, suggesting that other factors mediate the interaction. One 
possible factor, apo-Tf, only weakly binds TfR2 at serum pH and thus will not be 
able to effectively compete with holo-Tf. Tf binding to a TfR2 chimera 
containing the TfR1 helical domain indicates that the differences in the helical 
domain account for differences in the on rate of Tf, and nonconserved 
inter-receptor interactions are necessary for the stabilization of the complex. 
Conserved residues at one possible site of stabilization, the apical arm 
junction, are not important for TfR1-Tf binding but are critical for the TfR2-Tf 
interaction. Our results highlight the differences in Tf interactions with the 
two TfRs.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), a disease marked by chronic iron overload from insufficient expression of the hormone hepcidin, is one of the most common genetic diseases. One form of HH (Type III) results from mutations in the transferrin receptor-2 (TfR2). TfR2 is postulated to be a part of signaling system that is capable of modulating hepcidin expression. The molecular details of TfR2’s role in this system remain unclear, however. TfR2 is predicted to bind the iron carrier transferrin (Tf) when the iron-saturation of Tf is high. To better understand the nature of these TfR-Tf interactions, a binding study with the full-length receptors was conducted. In agreement with previous studies with truncated forms of the receptors, holo-Tf binds to the homolog, TfR1, significantly stronger than TfR2. However, the binding constant for Tf-TfR2 is still far above that of physiological holo-Tf levels, inconsistent with the hypothetical model and suggests that other factors mediate the interaction. One possible factor, Apo-Tf, only weakly binds TfR2 at serum pH, thus will not be able to effectively compete with holo-Tf. Tf-binding to a TfR2 chimera containing the TfR1-helical domain indicates that the differences in the helical domain account for differences in on-rate of Tf, and non-conserved inter-receptor interactions are necessary for the stabilization of the complex. Conserved residues at one possible site of stabilization, the apical arm junction, are not important for TfR1-Tf binding, but are critical for the TfR2-Tf interaction. Our results highlight the differences in Tf interactions with the two TfRs.

INTRODUCTION

Iron is an essential nutrient and the most abundant transition metal in the body. Homeostasis of iron is a key process that ensures that both tissues meet their demand and that iron is not able to generate excess reactive oxygen species or serve as a growth platform for pathogens. The serum iron carrier transferrin (Tf), is a central component of the iron homeostasis process. Tf is a bi- lobal protein that binds one ferric ion per lobe with exceptionally high affinity 1 , and serves to solubilize the ferric ion for transport in blood. In addition, iron-loaded Tf (holo-Tf) serves as the main source of iron for most tissues. Circulating, holo-Tf binds to the cell-surface transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) and is endocytosed. Through an endocytic process known as the Tf cycle, the iron is released from Tf and is taken up into the cell. Iron-depleted Tf (apo-Tf) remains bound to TfR1 and recycles to the cell surface, where it is released from TfR1 at the neutral pH of the extracellular environment 2 Thus the pH sensitivity of the interaction of holo-Tf and apo-Tf with TfR1 is critical to the Tf cycle. Underlining the critical nature of this process, a TfR1-null mouse is embryonic lethal, demonstrating the importance of this cycle in growth and development 3 .

A homolog to TfR1, TfR2, is also able to bind circulating Tf. The physiological role of this interaction is through the maintenance of iron levels within the body rather than cellular iron uptake 4 5 . Mutations in TfR2 have been identified to be responsible for a form of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH, type III; 4 ), a disorder marked by chronic iron overload. In HH, the iron overload is a result of insufficient expression of the hormone, hepcidin. Hepcidin is expressed and secreted primarily in hepatocytes and binds to the sole iron export protein, ferroportin, inducing internalization and degradation 6 Thus, hepcidin secretion results in increased sequestration of iron within cells, particularly in cell types of high iron efflux (e.g. intestinal epithelial cells, macrophages, and hepatocytes), and a decrease in circulating iron. In iron overload diseases such as HH, increased iron transport due to the failure to regulate ferroportin levels properly, leads to iron deposition in tissues, which includes the liver and heart, leading to significant tissue damage from oxidative stress.

How, precisely, the interaction of Tf and TfR2 leads to increased hepcidin expression is unresolved. Treatment of TfR2-expressing cells with holo-Tf, but not apo-Tf, leads to increased receptor half-life 7 . Both TfRs are capable of forming complexes with HFE 8 – 10 , another plasma membrane protein that, when mutated or absent, causes the most common form of HH, Type I. HFE has been shown to compete with holo-Tf for TfR1 binding 9 Disrupting the TfR1-HFE interaction through point mutation results in inappropriately high hepcidin expression 11 . Thus, a proposed mechanism of iron-sensing is that HFE is in complex with TfR1 at low Tf-saturation, but upon increased systemic iron, HFE is displaced by holo-Tf and binds TfR2 11 . Whether HFE-TfR2 complex or HFE in complex with another protein initiates a signaling cascade to induce hepcidin expression is controversial. Signaling then decreases both passively with falling Tf iron saturation and actively through cleavage from the protease matriptase-2 12 . These hypothetical iron-sensing mechanisms are supported by multiple in vitro and in vivo experiments, but mechanisms remain unknown. Though multiple crystal or cryo-EM structures exist for TfR1 13 , 17 , little structure-function data has been shown for TfR2. As such, the structural differences between TfR1 and TfR2 that account for the differences in receptor function are unresolved.

In the present study, we identify key differences in the binding of Tf to the TfRs that are likely to contribute to their varying roles in iron homeostasis. Like previous studies have shown, TfR1 binds holo-Tf with a significantly stronger affinity than to TfR2. For the first time, however, we show that TfR1 and TfR2 have distinct mechanisms for stabilizing a complex with holo-Tf. Interestingly, apo-Tf is also able to bind to each receptor at serum pH, forming short-lived complexes that likely inhibit the interaction of holo-Tf with TfR2 at low systemic levels of iron. Together, our results support a dynamic model of Tf-TfR interactions in the liver that serve to directly link circulating iron levels to hepcidin expression.

DISCUSSION

In hepatocytes, Tf-mediated hepcidin expression is likely occurring through the balance of several factors: the serum concentrations of the different forms of Tf (diferric, monoferric, apo- Tf), the affinities for the various Tf’s between the TfR’s, the affinities for HFE between the TfR’s, and the cell surface levels of the receptors (e.g. Fe 3+ -dependent expression levels of TfR1 via the IRP/IRE system). As a result, it is critical to understand the ligand binding behavior of the receptors to better understand the system.

In agreement with previous studies, we show holo-Tf will preferentially bind TfR1 to TfR2 at serum pH. The binding behavior indicates the receptors not only bind Tf with different affinities, but stabilize the binding complex in unique ways. In the full-length receptor system used here, the K D ’s for both receptors are lower than those previously described. Mutation of a critical Tf- binding residue in TfR1 (Gly-647) to alanine significantly reduces binding ( Fig. S1C ), thus, the increased affinity is likely not due to non-specific interactions. Further, TfR1, unlike TfR2, is selective for human holo-Tf and does not bind to ovoTf ( Fig. S2A and S2B ), as has been previously found 30 , suggesting the detergent-solubilized receptors are still in a functional state. Rather, the orientation of the N-lobes of the two Tf molecules in the crystal structure with TfR1 suggests that the ligand may interact with the stalk region of the receptor, thereby providing additional interactions that may be responsible for the increased affinities that we measured.

The interaction of diferric Tf and TfR2 is considered to be critical for its role in increasing hepcidin gene expression. The interaction re-routes internalized receptor from a degradation to a endosomal recycling pathways 31 , thereby increasing the half-life of the protein. Although the binding of holo-Tf to TfR2 is weaker than to TfR1, in the context of physiological concentrations of serum Tf, the determined K D ’s suggests it should bind efficiently even at low saturation levels. This suggested insensitivity of TfR2 to Tf saturation opposes in vivo data 5 and is likely a result of the simplified two-component system used here. Apo-Tf, which does not induce stabilization of the receptor, interacts with TfR2 at serum pH, but at a ~30-fold reduced affinity. As a result, it is not likely to effectively compete with holo-Tf for TfR2 binding. Whether monoferric Tf is capable of binding TfR2 at a higher affinity than apo-Tf or promoting stabilization of the receptor is unknown. Future studies will assess if that population could prohibit stabilization of TfR2 at low Tf saturation. Other proteins that have been found to interact with TfR2, such as HFE 8 , hemojuvelin 32 , or CD81 33 may also influence Tf binding behavior at the cell surface.

At endosomal pH, TfR2 forms a stable complex with apo-Tf ( Fig. 1G ). This stability is analogous to that observed for TfR1 as part of the Tf cycle. Though iron uptake is not thought to be the primary function of TfR2, TfR2 has been found to promote Tf-Fe 3 + uptake in cultured cells 27 , 34 . Furthermore, recent evidence shows that TfR2 traffics holo-Tf to lysosomes erythroid progenitors for iron uptake 35 . As with TfR1, stabilization of the apo-Tf-TfR2 complex may be a key aspect of an uptake process.

The Tf-binding ectodomains of the TfR’s are quite similar, with 46% sequence identity. The helical domain specifically, which comprises nearly all of the binding site, has 50% sequence identity (69% similarity). The TfR1 Tf-binding site consists of 20 amino acids forming 30 interactions with Tf 14 . Of those interactions, 8 are not conserved in TfR2, from 5 of the 20 amino acids. The TfR2 chimera that exchanges the helical domain for TfRl’s restores all but one of the non-conserved interactions. With those changes, the maximal binding and on-rate is enhanced from WT-TfR2, but still below that observed for TfR1. Further, the off-rate of the complex is increased from with wild-type TfR2 receptor. These data suggest that the difference in the association of TfR2 with Tf may be primarily through binding site residues, but the stability of the complex is due to unconserved mechanisms. This may include conformational changes upon binding that initiate stabilizing interactions of the helical domain with either the apical or protease-like domains.

A disordered apical domain loop, or “arm” as described here (residues 306–330), was identified as possibly participating in the Tf interaction from the crystal structure of TfR1 bound to Tf. The arm, and residue His-318, in particular, from one TfR1 monomer is drawn away from the binding site in the crystal structure lacking Tf 16 . With Tf-bound, however, the arm is in close proximity to the Tf bound to the other monomer, as well as the C-terminus of that monomer 14 . Both the arm and the C-terminus are highly conserved between TfR1 and TfR2 sequences, with the exception of His-318 (Gln-340 in TfR2) and the penultimate residues, Glu-759 in TfR1 and Asn-800 in TfR2 ( Fig. 3C ). These observations led to the hypothesis that, upon Tf binding, the conformational change of the apical domain arm and concurrent interaction between His-318, the C-terminus, and Tf is a key stabilizing mechanism for the interaction of Tf with TfR1 and that an altered (or missing) version of it in TfR2 accounts for the weaker complex stability.

Though highly conserved in TfR1 sequences across different species ( Fig. 3C ), both His-318 and Glu-759, however, are not critical for the interaction with holo- or apo-Tf ( Fig. 4 ). Thus, in the context of the Tf cycle, they are not important for holo-Tf complex formation or stabilization of the apo-Tf-TfR1 complex after endosomal acidification and iron loss. There are a number of histidine residues in TfR1 that have been found to be involved in the conformational changes that drive iron release from Tf due to the protonation during endosomal acidification. Further, the Tf residue nearest the junction, His-349, has previously been shown to be essential for release of iron from the C-lobe 36 . His-318 of TfR1 may similarly be required for the transition from a holo-complex to an apo- one, but the stable end states. The tolerance for substitution with the amide group-containing sidechains of the equivalent residues in TfR2 (Gln-340 and Asn-800, respectively) suggests that only the weak nucleophilicity is required, if they are involved in binding at all.

The inverse mutations in TfR2, however, do have a significant negative impact on holo-Tf binding. Lacking a crystal structure for TfR2, we cannot be certain the apical domain arm undergoes the same conformational change, forming a similar convergence of structural elements. The near-complete conservation of the elements, coupled with the substantially weaker Tf-binding with either TfR1-residue substitution, suggests that they are at least both involved in complex formation. Introduction of the mutations into the chimera protein do not significantly alter the kinetics, but do significantly impair maximal binding responses, particularly for the Q340H mutant, further illustrating the importance of that position in TfR2-Tf complex formation. The fact that neither mutation improves binding for the chimera demonstrates the role of inter-domain interactions beyond the apical arm junction are critical for stabilizing the complex, especially for TfR1’s high affinity interaction with Tf.

The differences in TfR1 and TfR2 binding behavior with Tf are likely central to the differing functions they perform. During the Tf cycle, TfR1 is not a passive receptor only to permit holo- Tf entry, rather the receptor serves to drive Fe 3+ release from each lobe of the protein after acidification of the endosome through an assembly of conformational changes. Thus the interaction may be high affinity as the result of the extensive contacts required to alter the Tf structure prior to iron release. As TfR2 does not participate in the canonical Tf cycle, some specific interactions necessary for TfR1 function have likely been lost through evolution, with those favoring a specific conformational change that transduces a signal across the membrane retained.

Alongside a putative role for monoferric Tf in modulating the holo-Tf-TfR2 association, future studies should address if, and how, HFE influences TfR2’s interaction with holo-Tf. Soluble TfR2 ectodomain did not exhibit binding to HFE 22 , but subsequent immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments have identified HFE-TfR2 complexes 8 Further, IP experiments have indicated HFE binding requires the stalk domain of TfR2 10 , which is lacking in the ectodomain-only constructs. As TfR2 and HFE mutations each represent similar hereditary hemochromatosis sub-types, a better molecular understanding of the TfR2-HFE-Tf interaction(s) and their direct impact on modulating hepcidin expression is needed.
