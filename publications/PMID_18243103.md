GCC185 is a large coiled-coil protein at the trans Golgi network that is 
required for receipt of transport vesicles inbound from late endosomes and for 
anchoring noncentrosomal microtubules that emanate from the Golgi. Here, we 
demonstrate that recruitment of GCC185 to the Golgi is mediated by two 
Golgi-localized small GTPases of the Rab and Arl families. GCC185 binds Rab6, 
and mutation of residues needed for Rab binding abolishes Golgi localization. 
The crystal structure of Rab6 bound to the GCC185 Rab-binding domain reveals 
that Rab6 recognizes a two-fold symmetric surface on a coiled coil immediately 
adjacent to a C-terminal GRIP domain. Unexpectedly, Rab6 binding promotes 
association of Arl1 with the GRIP domain. We present a structure-derived model 
for dual GTPase membrane attachment that highlights the potential ability of Rab 
GTPases to reach binding partners at a significant distance from the membrane 
via their unstructured and membrane-anchored, hypervariable domains.
