The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of a serine protease (AgSp14D1) 
from the human malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, is presented. The gene product 
is a 360 amino acid protein that contains two domains and has the highest 
sequence similarity to the Drosophila melanogaster serine protease easter and to 
prophenol oxidase activating enzyme (pPAE) from Manduca sexta. The catalytic 
domain is at the carboxy terminus and has the conserved serine, histidine and 
aspartic acid residues found in serine proteases as well as six cysteines common 
to invertebrate enzymes. The amino terminus contains critical cysteines that 
define a clip (=disulphide knot) domain which places this gene product in a 
subfamily of regulatory serine proteases that includes not only easter and pPAE 
but also the Drosophila proteins masquerade, stubble and snake as well as 
proclotting enzyme and factor B from the horseshoe crab. In situ hybridization 
to the polytene chromosomes detects a single band at 14D and Southern analysis 
with a probe from the 5' end of the gene confirms the single copy status of this 
gene. Northern analysis reveals changes in transcript abundance during 
development and following blood feeding. Interestingly, this analysis also shows 
an increase in transcript levels following wounding or injection of bacteria.
