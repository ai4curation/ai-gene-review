Cytokines regulate lymphocyte development and differentiation, but precisely how 
they control these processes is still poorly understood. By using microarray 
technology to detect cytokine-induced genes, we identified a cDNA encoding Cybr, 
which was increased markedly in cells incubated with IL-2 and IL-12. The mRNA 
was most abundant in hematopoietic cells and tissues. The predicted amino acid 
sequence is similar to that of GRP-1-associated protein (GRASP), a recently 
identified retinoic acid-induced cytohesin-binding protein. Physical 
interaction, dependent on the coiled-coil domains of Cybr and cytohesin-1, was 
demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation of the overexpressed proteins from 293T 
cells. Cytohesin-1, in addition to its role in cell adhesion, is a guanine 
nucleotide-exchange protein activator of ARF GTPases. Acceleration of guanosine 
5prime prime or minute-O-(thiotriphosphate) binding to ARF by cytohesin-1 in 
vitro was enhanced by Cybr. Because the binding protein modified activation of 
ADP ribosylation factor by cytohesin-1, we designate this cytokine-inducible 
protein Cybr (cytohesin binder and regulator).
