Oocyte loss, either directly through attrition (germ cell death) or indirectly 
through follicular atresia (somatic or granulosa cell death), is a fundamental 
event associated with defining the time of normal or premature reproductive 
senescence in females. Although apoptosis has been reported to function as the 
underlying mechanism responsible for death of both germ cells and somatic cells 
in the ovary, the final molecular steps which commit ovarian cells to death have 
not been fully elucidated. To examine if death repressor activity of the bcl-2 
gene product is important for germ cell survival, we conducted studies using a 
Bcl-2 loss-of-function (bcl-2 -/-) transgenic mouse model. Histological analyses 
revealed that ovaries collected from bcl-2 -/- mice possessed numerous 
aberrantly formed primordial follicle-like structures containing a single layer 
of granulosa cells without an oocyte. Additionally, the total number of 
primordial follicles present which contained a healthy oocyte was markedly 
reduced in bcl-2 -/- mice as compared to heterozygote (bcl-2 -/+) or wild-type 
(bcl-2 +/+) mice, suggesting that expression of the bcl-2 death repressor gene 
is critical for endowment of a normal complement of germ cells and primordial 
follicles in the mammalian ovary.
