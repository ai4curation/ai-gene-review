Abstract

In addition to its well-characterized role in the central nervous system, human glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII, Uniprot ID Q04609 ) acts as a folate hydrolase in the small intestine, participating in the absorption of dietary polyglutamylated folates (FolGlu n ), which are the provitamin form of folic acid (also known as vitamin B 9 ). Despite the role of GCPII as a folate hydrolase, nothing has been known about the processing of polyglutamylated folates by GCPII at the structural or enzymological level. Moreover, many epidemiologic studies on the relationship of the naturally occurring His475Tyr polymorphism to folic acid status suggest that this polymorphism may be associated with several pathologies linked to impaired folate metabolism. In this study we present 1) a series X-ray structures of complexes between a catalytically inactive GCPII mutant (Glu424Ala) and a panel of naturally occurring polyglutamylated folates, 2) X-ray structure of the His475Tyr variant at 1.83 Å resolution, 3) study of the recently identified arene-binding site of GCPII through mutagenesis (Arg463Leu, Arg511Leu, and Trp541Ala), inhibitor binding and enzyme kinetics with polyglutamylated folates as substrates and 4) comparison of the thermal stabilities and folate-hydrolyzing activities of GCPII wild type and His475Tyr variants. As a result, the crystallographic data reveal considerable details about the binding mode of polyglutamylated folates to GCPII, especially the engagement of the arene binding site in recognizing the folic acid moiety. Additionally, the combined structural and kinetic data suggest that GCPII wild type and His475Tyr variant are functionally identical.

Introduction

Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII; EC 3.4.17.21 ) is a 750-amino-acid type II transmembrane glycoprotein [ 1 ] and a Zn 2+ -dependent metalloprotease of the M28 peptidase family ( Fig. 1 ). This enzyme is also known as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), folate hydrolase 1 (FOLH1), folyl-poly-γ-glutamate carboxypeptidase (FGCP), and N-acetylated-α-linked acidic dipeptidase (NAALADase). These different designations reflect the various functions and tissue distribution of this protein.

The well-known and thoroughly studied enzymatic activity of GCPII is the cleavage of peptide neurotransmitter N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate (NAAG) into N-acetyl-L-aspartate and L-glutamate [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]. In contrast to that, nothing has been known about the GCPII's folyl-poly-γ-L-glutamate hydrolyzing activity. At the lumenal surface of the human jejunum, GCPII cleaves γ-linked L-glutamates from folyl-poly-γ-L-glutamic acids (FolGlu n ) [ 7 ], the storage form of folic acid that cannot pass through the cell membrane [ 8 ]. (Structures of the folyl-poly-γ-L-glutamic acids and their building block pteroic acid, which is composed of a substituted pteridine double-ring and p-aminobenzoyl moiety, are shown in Fig. 1 .) Atlhough the structural and enzymological aspects of FolGlu n cleavage have not been characterized at all and folate is crucial for replication of rapidly dividing cells, the physiological relevance and structural and enzymological aspects of FolGlu n cleavage in the small intestine have not been well-characterized. Numerous reports and epidemiologic studies on the naturally occurring His475Tyr polymorphism have analyzed the potential influence of this polymorphism on physiological levels of folates and folate-related metabolites (e.g. homocysteine). Some studies involving 600 – 1900 subjects concluded that this polymorphism influences neither folate nor homocysteine levels [ 9 , 10 , 11 ]. In contrast, a 2700-subject study concluded that the His475Tyr polymorphism confers higher folate and lower homocysteine levels [ 8 ]. Other, much smaller studies (30 - 44 participants) have correlated the polymorphism with altered folate levels and some pathologies, such as breast cancer [ 12 ]. Importantly, all of these studies investigated only genotype-phenotype association data, which makes their results rather inconclusive. For these reasons, the folyl poly-γ-L-glutamate hydrolyzing activity of GCPII and its natural His475Tyr variant, both at structural and enzymological level, is the focus of this study.

Structurally, the extracellular part of GCPII folds into three distinct domains: the protease domain (amino acids 57 - 116 and 352 - 590), the apical domain (amino acids 117 - 351), and the C-terminal domain (also called the dimerization domain; amino acids 591 - 750) (see Fig. 1 ). All three GCPII domains contribute to formation of the substrate binding cavity, which consists of the S1 site, the active site, and the S1′ site.

The active site features two Zn ions coordinated by the side chains of His377, Asp387, Asp453, Glu425, and His553. In the vicinity of the S1 site, there is a highly flexible segment called the “entrance lid” (amino acids Trp541 - Gly548). In its closed conformation, the entrance lid fully shields the substrate binding cavity from the extramolecular space, as observed when small substrates such as NAAG are bound [ 4 ] ( PDB ID 3BXM ). When the entrance lid is in open conformation, larger inhibitors can bind [ 13 ] ( PDB ID 2XEF, 2XEG, 2XEI, 2XEJ ). Similar to the S1 site, the S1′ site can be shielded from the extramolecular space by a flexible amino acid segment. The so-called “glutarate-sensor” (Tyr692 - Ser704) takes on a beta-stranded conformation upon binding of the glutamic acid moiety in the S1′ position, sealing off an otherwise present small funnel (reviewed elsewhere [ 6 , 14 ]).

Recently, Zhang et al. [ 13 ] identified and structurally characterized an exosite of GCPII that binds aromatic moieties. This exosite, termed the “arene-binding site” (ABS), is formed by the first amino acid of the entrance lid, Trp541, together with Arg511 and Arg463. Adding a dinitrophenyl moiety with a length-optimized linker to a GCPII inhibitor significantly enhances the inhibitor's affinity toward GCPII via the avidity effect, i.e., by allowing it to bind to GCPII in a bidentate mode.

In this paper we set out to analyze i) how GCPII recognizes and cleaves polyglutamylated folates, ii) the role of the “arene-binding site” in the recognition and binding of folyl-poly-γ-L-glutamic acids and iii) if the His475Tyr polymorphism alters the folyl-poly-γ-L-glutamate hydrolyzing activity. To this end, we solved a series of X-ray structures of complexes between the inactive GCPII mutant, Glu424Ala, and several naturally occurring polyglutamylated folates (FolGlu 1-6 ). We also analyzed the 3D structure of the GCPII His475Tyr variant and compared its activity to the wild type using a novel assay, and performed structure-activity studies of the ABS.

Discussion

The aims of this study were to investigate the molecular recognition of polyglutamylated folates by GCPII and clarify whether the reported His475Tyr polymorphism might alter the binding and/or turnover of polyglutamylated folates, potentially leading to altered levels of folates and related metabolites in humans. Furthermore, we set out to analyze the role of the “arene-binding site”, a recently identified putative exosite in the GCPII structure, in the molecular recognition of polyglutamylated folates and, more generally, in the binding of ligands containing an aromatic moiety capable of interacting with this exosite.

Although extensive epidemiologic studies on the effect of the His475Tyr polymorphism have been conducted, the possible role of this mutation in the folate uptake and metabolism of metabolically related molecules remains unclear. Folates are essential for the C1 metabolism of cells, i.e., for the biosynthesis of nucleobases, and they are important for the replication of rapidly dividing cancer cells. Folate insufficiency might result in altered levels of folate-related metabolites and/or in altered susceptibility to certain types of cancer. However, it is difficult to speculate how a single amino acid mutation in a region distant from the active site (see Fig. 1 ; His475 is located 27 Å from the active site Zn1) could influence the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Nevertheless, there have been reports of long-range rearrangements of an enzyme's substrate binding cleft caused by very distant mutations, for example in HIV-1 protease (reviewed elsewhere [ 17 ]). Thus, the idea that the His475Tyr mutation could influence GCPII activity was worth exploring. However, we found that the enzymatic properties of recombinant human GCPII His475Tyr are very similar to those of the wild type enzyme (almost identical K M values and turnover numbers toward all tested folyl-poly-γ-L-glutamate substrates). Furthermore, 3D structure analysis of the protein by X-ray crystallography did not reveal any significant structural changes caused by the mutation. The very subtle differences that we observed cannot account for the reported phenotype of the polymorphism [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ]. It is relevant to mention that all recombinant proteins discussed in this manuscript were prepared in Drosophila S2 cells and comprise the full ectodomain of human GCPII in which the enzymatic activity resides. We have previously shown that the enzymatic activity of this recombinant protein is indistinguishable to that of native, full-length GCPII [ 18 ].

All seven structures solved as part of the present work provide structural explanation as to why the His475Tyr mutant behaves virtually identically to the wild type enzyme. Our structural analysis showed that the bound FolGlu 1-6 substrates do not interact with His475. Additionally, the structure of GCPII His475Tyr exhibits no significant re-arrangement of the substrate binding pocket. Although the enzymologic comparison of rhGCPII wild type and His475Tyr found no significant differences in cleavage of FolGlu n , thermal stability, or structure, the possibility that the His475Tyr mutation causes altered folic acid levels and folate-related metabolites in humans remains open. The His475Tyr mutation may influence folate levels by other mechanisms, e.g., by changing the trafficking of GCPII, by changing its expression level or by changing the enzyme's interaction with potential signaling partners. These potential mechanisms of action have yet to be investigated.

There was one peculiarity about the X-ray structure of the complex obtained from the crystallization condition with the inactive GCPII mutant (Glu424Ala) and FolGlu 0 . As already mentioned, this structure contains a di-γ-L-glutamyl-glutamic moiety, even though no compound containing such a moiety has been added to the crystallization drop. A possible explanation is that some higher polyglutamylated folates (FolGlu >4 ) coming from the cultivation medium may have remained bound throughout the purification process (only a one-step affinity purification), not allowing the FolGlu 0 to bind. In line with such a hypothesis, folic acid did not inhibit the cleavage of FolGlu 3 (data not shown), suggesting that the folate (the product) has lower affinity to the enzyme than polyglutamylated folate (the substrate).

Inspection of the kinetic properties of the wild type and His475Tyr variants revealed an interesting observation. Folate substrates harboring more than two C-terminal glutamates bound to the enzyme more effectively (by almost one order of magnitude), as reflected by differences in their K M values (compare FolGlu 1 and FolGlu 2-6 , Fig. 6a ). This difference in K M is in good agreement with previously published observation that di-γ-L-glutamate moiety inhibited the NAAG-hydrolysing activity of GCPII twenty times less effectively than tri-γ-L-glutamate moiety, while tri, tetra- and penta-γ-L-glutamate moieties inhibited comparably [ 19 ].

To further analyze the contribution of the ABS to substrate recognition, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the key residues of the exosite (Arg463, Arg511, and Trp541). Kinetic analysis of the recombinant mutant proteins did not show a major influence of the ABS residues on polyglutamyl-folate binding and turnover, only a modest, approximately three-fold increase in NAAG binding affinity. As NAAG cannot engage the ABS, the direct effects of these mutations on substrate recognition can be excluded and more intricate/subtle (unidentified) contributions (e.g. the flexibility of the entrance lid) may play role.

The binding of selected inhibitors targeting the arene-binding site, on the other hand, has been previously shown to be influenced by their interaction with the residues forming the ABS both structurally and using inhibition studies [ 13 ]. Our study tested those inhibitors with rhGCPII wild type and Trp541Ala variants [ 13 ] (structures of the inhibitors are shown in Fig. 5a ). Inhibitors that had been previously reported to interact with the ABS showed a significant loss of binding to the GCPII Trp541Ala variant, in which the ABS is presumably disrupted (see Fig. 5b ), confirming the importance of this structural feature for inhibitor binding. It is somewhat surprising that on one hand, the crystallographic and site-directed mutagenesis data of the ABS provide a good mechanistic explanation for changes in inhibitor affinity, while on the other hand there is a disconnection between the structural data (ABS engages the pteroate) and kinetic studies (mutations in the ABS mostly do not change kinetic parameters of substrate hydrolysis). We can speculate that these differences can be attributed to differences in the kinetics of substrate vs. inhibitor interactions with GCPII. The crystallographic data represent the most preferred conformation of a given GCPII complex achieved in a time-scale of several days (crystal growth). In addition, when a typical inhibition constant is determined, the inhibitor is usually preincubated with the enzyme for several minutes (5 - 13 in this case), giving the inhibitor enough time to adopt the most energetically favorable conformation. On the other hand, k cat values greater than 1 s -1 indicate that a given substrate is bound and hydrolyzed in less than a second. Although the high-affinity C-terminal part of the substrate is docked into (and released from) the active site of GCPII within this time scale, the flexible distal part might not be able to engage the ABS and thus has limited (or no) contribution to the overall affinity. This conjecture is supported by binding kinetics observed for GCPII interactions with a fluorescently labeled GCPII inhibitor/probe [ 20 ]. We have observed that the BODIPY fluorophore engages the ABS (unpublished work, C. Bařinka) and that this engagement leads to quenching of fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence quenching is not instantaneous but rather gradual, taking tens of seconds. This points toward a bidentate mode of substrate/inhibitor binding, in which the C-terminal (docking) part of the inhibitor binds “immediately” and the distal part somewhat more slowly. Another possibility could be that this exosite is inherently a lower-affinity site to allow to bind all forms of folic acid moiety (folyl/5-methyl-dihydrofolyl/5-methyl-tetrahydrofolyl). The natural diet contains predominantly 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolyl-poly-γ-L-glutamates [ 21 ], which are less stable than their fully oxidized folyl-forms and may easily be oxidized to 5-methyl-dihydrofolyl-poly-γ-L-glutamates or may even degrade to the folyl-forms. The same may apply to the folate receptor α isoform (FRα), which has been recently co-crystallized with the folic acid, but not with 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolic acid [ 22 ] ( PDB ID 4LRH ), although this isoform of folate receptor is expressed in kidney in renal tubular cells to resorb 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolic acid, a major form of folic acid found in blood.

Another indication that the arene-binding site is a rather low-affinity binding site provides a recently published x-ray structure of GCPII in complex with a non-hydrolyzable methotrexate analogue of the FolGlu 1 substrate ( PDB ID 3BI1 ) [ 23 ]. In this structure, only the γ-D-glutamyl-L-glutamate moiety with spatial arrangement analogous to what is seen in FolGlu 1-3 structures, was defined by the electron density map, while the pteridine ring was disordered and no stacking with Trp541 could be observed [ 23 ].

Measurements of kinetic parameters also revealed that the mechanism, by which polyglutamylated folates are cleaved, is probably distributive, i.e. the γ-linked L-glutamates from folyl-poly-γ-L-glutamic acids are cleaved sequentially from C-terminus. For higher FolGlu n turnovers (10 -20 %), we have always observed a small amount (≈1 - 2 %) of the FolGlu n-2 product (data not shown; the contribution of the FolGlu n-2 product to the kinetic data could thus be neclected).

Data presented in this study might be a starting point for the design of a homolog-specific ligand or inhibitor of GCPII and GCPIII. Although these two homologous proteins share 81% similarity at the amino acid sequence level [ 24 ] and their 3D structures are very similar [ 25 ], some reports suggest that GCPIII might play a distinct enzymatic role in specific tissues, such as the testes [ 26 ]. As shown by Zhang et al. [ 13 ], the choice of a proper arene-binding-site-targeting moiety can improve inhibitor potency by several orders of magnitude. Since GCPIII does not seem to have a corresponding ABS in its structure, an appropriate inhibitor targeting this exosite in GCPII might represent a useful tool in distinguishing both enzymes at the protein level.

Novel UPLC method for assaying glutamate carboxypeptidase activity using folyl-(1/2/3/4/5/6)-γ-L-glutamic acids as substrates

FolGlu n reaction mixtures were analyzed on a C18 Acquity UPLC HSS T3 2.1 × 100 mm column with 1.8 μm particles (Waters), guarded by a 0.22 μm pre-filter (Waters) and VanGuard pre-column (Waters), coupled to an Agilent 1200 Series UPLC instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Mobile phase A was 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 (Penta), supplemented with 0.02 % (w/v) sodium azide (Sigma Aldrich); mobile phase B was acetonitrile (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA). Elution of individual FolGlu 1/2/3/4/5/6 molecules and their cleavage products was performed isocratically at 2.0 % / 1.5 % / 1.1 % / 0.4 % / 0.2 % / 0.0 % acetonitrile, respectively. The column temperature was set to 50.0 °C. The HPLC runs consisted of 1.8 min isocratic flow at 0.0 - 2.0 % B, 0.1 min transition to 10.0 % B, 1.1 min at 10.0 % B, 0.1 min transition back to 0.0 - 2.0 % B, and 7.4 min re-equilibration. Analytes were detected at 281 nm and 354 nm. Inhibition reactions with FolGlu 1 were analyzed in the same manner except that the percentage of acetonitrile was 2.1 % instead of 2.0 %. The substrate turnover was quantified as the ratio of the substrate and product peak areas. The sum of the areas of the substrate and the product served as an internal standard. The limit of quantification was at least 10 nM (when calculated as baseline height multiplied by 10).

Novel UPLC method for assaying glutamate carboxypeptidase activity using NAAG as a substrate

The NAAG reaction mixtures were lyophilized (for at least 6 hours at 20 μbar using Christ Beta 2-8 LD plus, Osterode am Harz, Germany, or Labconco instruments cat. no. 7753511, Kansas City, MO, USA) and re-dissolved in 25.0 μl MilliQ water (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Then, surpassing the need for a radioactivelly labeled substrate traditionally used in assessing the NAAG hydrolysing activity of GCPII [ 2 ], a modified fully automated ortho-phthalaldehyde-derivatization [ 38 ] step was performed: 11.0 μl of each re-dissolved reaction was manually transferred into a 96 well plate, and the plate was inserted into an autosampler set to 4 °C. A 99.0 μl aliquot of the derivatization solution [40.6 mM 2-mercaptopropionic acid (Sigma Aldrich), 33.0 mM ortho-phthalaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich) in 200 mM sodium borate (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), pH 10.0] was added by the autosampler. After mixing, the sample was injected onto a C18 Acquity UPLC HSS T3 2.1 × 100 mm column with 1.8 μm particles (Waters), guarded by a 0.22 μm pre-filter (Waters) and VanGuard precolumn (Waters), coupled to an Agilent 1200 Series UPLC instrument (Agilent Technologies). Ortho-phthalaldehyde-Glu derivative was eluted isocratically with 96.0 % mobile phase A [25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 (Penta), supplemented with 0.02 % (w/v) sodium azide (Sigma Aldrich)] and 4.0 % mobile phase B (acetonitrile). The column temperature was 70.0 °C. The method consisted of 2.7 min isocratic flow at 4.0 % B, 0.1 min transition to 80.0 % B, 4.7 min at 80.0 % B, 0.1 min transition back to 4.0 % B, and 8.4 min re-equilibration. Glutamate eluted after approximately 1.4 min. Analytes were detected by fluorescence at 230/450 nm. The substrate turnover was quantified as the ratio of the peak areas of the glutamic acid (product) and the the total cleavage reaction. The limit of quantification was estimated as x B + 10σ B (average of the blank measurement plus 10 times the standard deviation of the blank) and was usually around 20 - 30 nM.
