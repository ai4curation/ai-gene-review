The ubiquitous protein Ser/Thr phosphatase-1 (PP1) interacts with dozens of 
regulatory proteins that are structurally unrelated. However, most of them share 
a short, degenerate "RVxF"-type docking motif. Using a broad in silico screening 
based on a stringent definition of the RVxF motif, in combination with a 
multistep biochemical validation procedure, we have identified 78 novel 
mammalian PP1 interactors. A global analysis of the validated RVxF-based PP1 
interactome not only provided insights into the conserved features of the RVxF 
motif but also led to the discovery of additional common PP1 binding elements, 
described as the "SILK" and "MyPhoNE" motifs. In addition to the doubling of the 
known mammalian PP1 interactome, our data contribute to the design of PP1 
interaction networks. Notably, an interaction network linking PP1 interactors 
discloses a pleiotropic role of PP1 in cell polarity.
