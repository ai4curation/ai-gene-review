7B2 is an acidic protein residing in the secretory granules of neuroendocrine 
cells. Its sequence has been elucidated in many phyla and species. It shows high 
similarity among mammals. A Pro-Pro-Asn-Pro-Cys-Pro polyproline motif is its 
most conserved feature, being carried by both vertebrate and invertebrate 
sequences. It is biosynthesized as a precursor protein that is cleaved into an 
N-terminal fragment and a C-terminal peptide. In neuroendocrine cells, 7B2 
functions as a specific chaperone for the proprotein convertase (PC) 2. Through 
the sequence around its Pro-Pro-Asn-Pro-Cys-Pro motif, it binds to an inactive 
proPC2 and facilitates its transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to later 
compartments of the secretory pathway where the zymogen is proteolytically 
matured and activated. Its C-terminal peptide can inhibit PC2 in vitro and may 
contribute to keep the enzyme transiently inactive in vivo. The PC2-7B2 model 
defines a new neuroendocrine paradigm whereby proteolytic activation of 
prohormones and proneuropeptides in the secretory pathway is spatially and 
temporally regulated by the dynamics of interactions between converting enzymes 
and their binding proteins. Interestingly, unlike PC2-null mice, which are 
viable, 7B2-null mutants die early in life from Cushing's disease due to 
corticotropin ('ACTH') hypersecretion by the neurointermediate lobe, suggesting 
a possible involvement of 7B2 in secretory granule formation and in secretion 
regulation. The mechanism of this regulation is yet to be elucidated. 7B2 has 
been shown to be a good marker of several neuroendocrine cell dysfunctions in 
humans. The possibility that anomalies in its structure and expression could be 
aetiological causes of some of these dysfunctions warrants investigation.
