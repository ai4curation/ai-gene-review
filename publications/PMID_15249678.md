Hedgehog signaling is suggested to be a major oncogenic pathway in 
medulloblastoma, which arises from aberrant development of cerebellar granule 
progenitors. Allelic loss of chromosome 17p has also been described as the most 
frequent genetic defect in this human neoplasia. This observation raises the 
question of a possible interplay between 17p deletion and the Hedgehog 
tumorigenic pathway. Here, we identify the human orthologue of mouse 
REN(KCTD11), previously reported to be expressed in differentiating and low 
proliferating neuroblasts. Human REN(KCTD11) maps to 17p13.2 and displays 
allelic deletion as well as significantly reduced expression in medulloblastoma. 
REN(KCTD11) inhibits medulloblastoma cell proliferation and colony formation in 
vitro and suppresses xenograft tumor growth in vivo. REN(KCTD11) seems to 
inhibit medulloblastoma growth by negatively regulating the Hedgehog pathway 
because it antagonizes the Gli-mediated transactivation of Hedgehog target 
genes, by affecting Gli1 nuclear transfer, and its growth inhibitory activity is 
impaired by Gli1 inactivation. Therefore, we identify REN(KCTD11) as a 
suppressor of Hedgehog signaling and suggest that its inactivation might lead to 
a deregulation of the tumor-promoting Hedgehog pathway in medulloblastoma.
