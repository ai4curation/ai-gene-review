In normal cells the protein kinase PKR effects apoptosis in response to various 
extra and intracellular cues and can also function to suppress the neoplastic 
phenotype. Because most neoplastic cells are resistant to certain apoptotic 
cues, we reasoned that an early molecular event in carcinogenesis or 
leukemogenesis might be the inactivation of PKR by expression or activation of 
intracellular PKR inhibitors. Seeking novel PKR-modulating proteins we report 
here that nucleophosmin (NPM), a protein frequently overexpressed in a variety 
of human malignancies, binds to PKR, and inhibits its activation. 
Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding experiments showed that NPM 
associated with PKR. Kinase assays demonstrated that recombinant NPM inhibited 
PKR activation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, purified recombinant NPM 
was phosphorylated by activated PKR. Most importantly, overexpression of NPM 
suppressed PKR activity, enhanced protein synthesis, and inhibited apoptosis. 
Lymphoblasts from patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) expressed low levels of NPM, 
which correlated with high ground-state activation of PKR and cellular 
hypersensitivity to apoptotic cues, but enforced expression of NPM in these 
mutant cells reduced aberrant apoptotic responses. Inhibition of PKR by NPM may 
be one mechanism by which neoplastic clones evolve in sporadic malignancies and 
in neoplastic cells arising in the context of the cancer predisposition 
syndrome, Fanconi anemia.
