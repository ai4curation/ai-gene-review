Prior studies indicate that the 9.3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) which defines a 44 
kD T lineage-specific glycoprotein (T44) enhances the proliferative response of 
peripheral blood T lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or allogeneic cells. 
The T44 molecule was expressed in both resting and activated T lymphocytes and 
in a subset of thymocytes, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence and flow 
cytofluorometry. In view of the potential importance of T44 in T cell 
activation, we investigated the ability of the 9.3 (anti-T44) antibody to 
stimulate peripheral blood T lymphocytes under culture conditions giving optimal 
proliferative responses to anti-T3 mAb. Like UCHT1 (anti-T3) mAb, the 9.3 
(anti-T44 mAb) promoted strong proliferative responses of purified T cells, 
provided that adherent cells were added to the culture. Maximal proliferation in 
response to 9.3 antibody was consistently detected at day 5 (at day 3 with 
anti-T3 or PHA). Moreover, triggering of T lymphocytes with 9.3 antibody (in the 
presence of adherent cells) resulted in strong IL-2 production that peaked at 48 
h. Analysis of the physical and functional relationship between the T44 molecule 
and other molecules involved in T cell activation, including the clonotypically 
restricted Ti and the monomorphic T3 or T11 molecules, was carried out on a 
mutagenized jurkat T leukemia cell line. This mutant, termed JA3 (surface 
phenotype: T11+, T3+, 3A1+, T4-, T8-, DR-, Tac-, 4F2+, T44+) produced large 
amounts of IL-2 upon stimulation with PHA, anti-T3, or anticlonotypic mAb in 
conjunction with phorbol myristate acetate (or adherent cells). The molecules 
precipitated by anti-T44 mAb from 125I-labeled JA3 cells appeared as a diffuse 
band of Mr 40-45,000 under reducing conditions; under nonreducing conditions, a 
prominent band of Mr 80-85,000 was observed, while the Mr 40-45,000 band was 
greatly reduced. Thus, T44 molecules in both reducing and nonreducing conditions 
had relative molecular weights similar to that of molecules carrying clonotypic 
(Ti) determinants. In addition, like anti-Ti or anti-T3 mAb, anti-T44 antibody 
induced JA3 cells to produce large amounts of IL-2 in the presence of phorbol 
myristate acetate. Other similarities between T44 and molecules carrying 
clonotypic structures included the susceptibility to antibody-induced modulation 
and the late reexpression (72 h) at the cell surface after modulation. Taken 
together, these experiments suggest that anti-T44 mAb might recognize a 
monomorphic determinant of the T cell receptor molecule or be physically or 
functionally linked to the T3-Ti complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
