Complete amino acid sequence of human hemopexin, the heme-binding protein of 
serum.

Takahashi N, Takahashi Y, Putnam FW.

We have determined the complete primary structure of human hemopexin, a plasma 
beta-glycoprotein that specifically binds one heme with high affinity and 
transports it to hepatocytes for salvage of the iron. Human hemopexin (Mr 
approximately equal to 63,000) consists of a single polypeptide chain containing 
439 amino acid residues with six intrachain disulfide bridges. The 
amino-terminal threonine residue is blocked by an O-linked galactosamine 
oligosaccharide, and the protein has five glucosamine oligosaccharides N-linked 
to the acceptor sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr. The 18 tryptophan residues are arranged 
in four clusters, and 12 of the tryptophans are conserved in homologous 
positions. Computer-assisted analysis of the internal homology in amino acid 
sequence indicates that hemopexin consists of two similar halves, thus 
suggesting duplication of an ancestral gene. Limited tryptic digestion cleaves 
apohemopexin after arginine-216 into two half-molecules, whereas heme-saturated 
hemopexin is cleaved after lysine-101. The half-molecules are connected by a 
histidine-rich hinge-like region that contains two glucosamine oligosaccharides. 
A structural model for human hemopexin is proposed that is based on these 
properties and on computer-assisted predictions of the secondary structure and 
the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character. In this model alpha-helices and 
beta-turns predominate, and the two halves are connected by an exposed 
connecting region in apohemopexin that becomes inaccessible to trypsin in 
hemesaturated hemopexin. Many segments of hemopexin are similar to sequences of 
other heme proteins, but no overall structural relationship of hemopexin to any 
other heme protein was identified.
