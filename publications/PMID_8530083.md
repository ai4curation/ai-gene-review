The heat shock cognate protein HSP73 (or HSC70) is a member of the HSP70 
multigene family. This protein has several functions, including binding to 
nascent polypeptides to facilitate correct folding and the uncoating of 
clathrin-coated vesicles. Analysis of somatic cell hybrids by two-dimensional 
protein gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of a 73-kDa protein in two 
hybrids containing human chromosomes 5, 6, 9, and 11 in common. Using Western 
blot analysis, we demonstrate that this protein is a member of the HSP70 family 
and, by Southern blot analysis, that the HSP73 gene is located on human 
chromosome 11. Fluorescence in situ hybridization further localized HSP73 to the 
region 11q23.3-q25. This region is involved in a number of genetic 
rearrangements and is associated with several well-characterized tumours.
