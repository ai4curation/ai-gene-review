Apoptosis of the developing metanephric kidney plays an important role in renal 
organogenesis. The bcl-2 is an oncogene that inhibits apoptotic cell death in a 
variety of settings. The bcl-2 (-/-) mice complete embryonic development but, in 
contrast to bcl-2 (+/-) and bcl-2 (+/+) littermates, manifest growth 
retardation, hypopigmentation of hair, lymphoid apoptosis, abnormal kidney 
morphology, and renal failure postnatally. To provide insight into the mechanism 
for the latter abnormalities, we examined metanephric kidneys from bcl-2 (-/-), 
bcl-2 (+/-), and bcl-2 (+/+) mice, as well as embryonic day 12 (E12) mouse 
embryos, and compared growth and development of metanephroi in vitro. Kidneys 
from bcl-2 (+/-) mice developed normally. In contrast, development of kidneys 
from bcl-2 (-/-) mice was abnormal as reflected by a marked reduction of renal 
size in newborns compared with kidneys of bcl-2 (+/-) littermates. In addition, 
kidneys from bcl-2 (-/-) mice contained far fewer nephrons and had smaller 
nephrogenic zones. Although metanephroi obtained from E12 bcl-2 (+/-) and bcl-2 
(-/-) mouse embryos were comparable in size, apoptosis of cells within 
metanephric blastemas of metanephroi from E12 bcl-2 (-/-) embryos was strikingly 
enhanced compared with that in blastemas of metanephroi from bcl-2 (+/-) 
embryos. During 3 days in culture, growth and development of metanephroi from 
bcl-2 (-/-) embryos were visibly reduced compared with those from bcl-2 (+/-) 
embryos.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
