Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant disorder 
characterized by endocrine tumors of parathyroids, pancreatic islets, and 
anterior pituitary. The MEN1 gene encodes a nuclear protein called menin. In 
MEN1 carriers inactivating mutations give rise to a truncated product consistent 
with menin acting as a tumor suppressor gene. However, the role of menin in 
tumorigenesis and its physiological functions are not known. Here, we show that 
menin inactivation by antisense RNA antagonizes transforming growth factor type 
beta-mediated cell growth inhibition. Menin interacts with Smad3, and antisense 
menin suppresses transforming growth factor type beta-induced and Smad3-induced 
transcriptional activity by inhibiting Smad3/4-DNA binding at specific 
transcriptional regulatory sites. These results implicate a mechanism of 
tumorigenesis by menin inactivation.
