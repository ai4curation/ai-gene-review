Receptor tyrosine kinase activity is known to occur in the absence of 
extracellular stimuli. Importantly, this "background" level of receptor 
phosphorylation is insufficient to effect a downstream response, suggesting that 
strict controls are present and prohibit full activation. Here a mechanism is 
described in which control of FGFR2 activation is provided by the adaptor 
protein Grb2. Dimeric Grb2 binds to the C termini of two FGFR2 molecules. This 
heterotetramer is capable of a low-level receptor transphosphorylation, but 
C-terminal phosphorylation and recruitment of signaling proteins are sterically 
hindered. Upon stimulation, FGFR2 phosphorylates tyrosine residues on Grb2, 
promoting dissociation from the receptor and allowing full activation of 
downstream signaling. These observations establish a role for Grb2 as an active 
regulator of RTK signaling.
