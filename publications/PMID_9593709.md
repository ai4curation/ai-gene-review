Spectrin is a widely expressed protein with specific isoforms found in erythroid 
and nonerythroid cells. Spectrin contains an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of 
unknown function. A cDNA encoding a candidate spectrin SH3 domain-binding 
protein was identified by interaction screening of a human brain expression 
library using the human erythroid spectrin (alphaI) SH3 domain as a bait. Five 
isoforms of the alphaI SH3 domain-binding protein mRNA were identified in human 
brain. Mapping of SH3 binding regions revealed the presence of two alphaI SH3 
domain binding regions and one Abl-SH3 domain binding region. The gene encoding 
the candidate spectrin SH3 domain-binding protein has been located to human 
chromosome 10p11.2 --> p12. The gene belongs to a recently identified family of 
tyrosine kinase-binding proteins, and one of its isoforms is identical to e3B1, 
an eps8-binding protein (Biesova, Z., Piccoli, C., and Wong, W. T. 
(1997)Oncogene 14, 233-241). Overexpression of the green fluorescent protein 
fusion of the SH3 domain-binding protein in NIH3T3 cells resulted in cytoplasmic 
punctate fluorescence characteristic of the reticulovesicular system. This 
fluorescence pattern was similar to that obtained with the anti-human erythroid 
spectrin alphaI SigmaI/betaI SigmaI antibody in untransfected NIH3T3 cells; in 
addition, the anti-alphaI SigmaI/betaI SigmaI antibody also stained Golgi 
apparatus. Immunofluorescence obtained using antibodies against alphaI 
SigmaI/++betaI SigmaI spectrin and Abl tyrosine kinase but not against 
alphaII/betaII spectrin colocalized with the overexpressed green fluorescent 
protein-SH3-binding protein. Based on the conservation of the spectrin SH3 
binding site within members of this protein family and published interactions, a 
general mechanism of interactions of tyrosine kinases with the spectrin-based 
membrane skeleton is proposed.
