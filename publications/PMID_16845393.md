Using a defined substrate DNA with a single psoralen interstrand cross-link 
(ICL), we studied the molecular mechanism of human ICL repair. In vitro ICL 
repair by human extracts is dependent on replication and is a largely error-free 
process. Extracts from a human BRCA2-defective mutant cell line, CAPAN-1, are 
severely compromised in ICL repair. Specifically, 'unhooked' but not fully 
repaired products accumulate in the reaction with CAPAN-1, and transient 
expression of BRCA2 in CAPAN-1 restores repair activity. Together, these results 
reveal that BRCA2 participates in repair of replication-mediated double-strand 
breaks generated when replication forks encounter ICLs. We also show that 
nucleotide excision repair is essential for the removal of the lesion left 
behind on one strand after unhooking. This study provides new mechanistic 
insights into the repair of ICLs in human cells.
