To address the role of D1 receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex, we combined 
pharmacological and genetic manipulations to examine long-term synaptic 
potentiation (LTP)/long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in brain slices of rats 
and mice. We found that the D1 antagonist SCH23390 selectively blocked the 
maintenance but not the induction of LTP in the prefrontal cortex. Conversely, 
activation of D1 receptors facilitated the maintenance of LTP, and this effect 
is impaired in heterozygous D1 receptor knockout mice. Low-frequency stimulation 
induced a transient depression in the medial prefrontal cortex. This depression 
could be transformed into LTD by coapplication of dopamine. Coapplication of 
dopamine, however, shows no facilitating effect on LTD in heterozygous D1 
receptor knockout mice. These results provide pharmacological and genetic 
evidence for a role of D1 receptors in the bidirectional modulation of synaptic 
plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex. The absence of this modulation in 
heterozygous knockout mice shows that a dysregulation of dopamine receptor 
expression levels can have dramatic effects on synaptic plasticity in the 
prefrontal cortex.
