The vps (vacuolar protein sorting) mutants have been used to dissect and 
characterize the vacuolar biogenesis pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. The vps mutants were isolated through their loss of ability to 
correctly sort the vacuolar hydrolase CPY, which travels from Golgi membranes to 
the vacuole through a prevacuolar compartment. Over 50 VPS genes have been 
divided into 6 classes according to vacuolar morphology. Mutations in any one of 
the class E VPS genes, such as VPS27, lead to an exaggerated form of the 
prevacuolar compartment. This class E compartment contains endocytosed proteins 
as well as proteins en route to the vacuole, and is thus taken to represent an 
intersection point between the endocytic and biosynthetic pathways. Mutations in 
the class D gene VPS45 can be used to define a second transport intermediate 
along the vacuolar biogenesis pathway, Golgi-derived transport vesicles carrying 
vacuolar membrane proteins on their way to the vacuole. Here we demonstrate that 
the Sec1p-like protein Vps45p is required for the fusion of Golgi-derived 
vesicles with the prevacuolar compartment indicating that VPS45 functions before 
VPS27 in the vacuolar biogenesis pathway. In addition, we show that VPS45 
function is not required for the delivery of endocytosed proteins to the 
prevacuolar compartment from the plasma membrane suggesting that the function of 
Vps45p is restricted to a single vesicular pathway.
