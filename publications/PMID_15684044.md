Changes in the substrate specificities of factors that irreversibly modify the 
histone components of chromatin are expected to have a profound effect on gene 
expression through epigenetics. Ezh2 is a histone-lysine methyltransferase with 
activity dependent on its association with other components of the Polycomb 
Repressive Complexes 2 and 3 (PRC2/3). Ezh2 levels are increasingly elevated 
during prostate cancer progression. Other PRC2/3 components also are elevated in 
cancer cells. Overexpression of Ezh2 in tissue culture promotes formation of a 
previously undescribed PRC complex, PRC4, that contains the NAD+-dependent 
histone deacetylase SirT1 and isoform 2 of the PRC component Eed. Eed2 is 
expressed in cancer and undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells but is 
undetectable in normal and differentiated ES cells. The distinct PRCs exhibit 
differential histone substrate specificities. These findings suggest that 
formation of a transformation-specific PRC complex may have a major role in 
resetting patterns of gene expression by regulating chromatin structure.
