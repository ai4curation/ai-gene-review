On the basis of the unknown tags in the mature human sperm serial analysis of 
gene expression library constructed by our laboratory, some transcripts were 
cloned, including Iqcf1 (IQ motif containing F1). To investigate the function of 
sperm-retained Iqcf1 in spermatogenesis and fertilization of mice, we 
investigated the spatial and temporal expression of IQCF1. By using the 
(transcription activator-like effector nuclease) strategy, Iqcf1-knockout mice 
were produced, and the phenotypes of the Iqcf1(-/-) mice were analyzed. The 
results showed that IQCF1 was localized in the acrosome of spermatozoa and 
spermatids; the expression of IQCF1 in testes was associated with spermatogenic 
capacity. The Iqcf1(-/-) mice were significantly less fertile than the wild-type 
mice (p = 0.0057) because of reduced sperm motility (p = 0.0094) and the 
acrosome reaction (AR) (p = 0.0093). In spermatozoa, IQCF1 interacted with 
calmodulin (CaM) and possibly participated in the tyrosine phosphorylation of 
sperm proteins during capacitation. In conclusion, a newly identified acrosomal 
protein, IQCF1, is closely related to sperm capacitation and AR; in particular, 
it is involved in tyrosine phosphorylation of sperm proteins through interaction 
with CaM. Research into the function of IQCF1 during fertilization could 
facilitate the investigation of the molecular mechanism of capacitation, which 
is unclear.
