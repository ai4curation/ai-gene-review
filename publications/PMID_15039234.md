Genetic loss of surface Fas antigen expression leads to reduced apoptosis of 
myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells, and a propensity to develop autoimmunity 
and myeloid leukemia in mouse models. Oncogenic p21(ras) decreases surface Fas 
antigen expression and renders fibroblasts resistant to Fas mediated apoptosis. 
Neurofibromin, which is encoded by NF1, is a GTPase activating protein that 
negatively regulates p21(ras) activity. NF1 loss leads to deregulation of 
p21(ras)-effector pathways, which control myeloid cell survival. Heterozygous 
inactivation of Nf1 increases mast cell numbers in Nf1 +/- mice, and enhances 
mast cell survival in response to c-kit ligand (kit-L). Here, we show that 
Nf1-deficient mast cells have reduced surface Fas antigen expression in response 
to kit-L and are resistant to Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis. Using genetic 
intercrosses between Nf1 +/- and class I (A)-PI-3K-deficient mice, we 
demonstrate that hyperactivation of the p21(ras)-class I(A) PI-3K pathway is the 
mechanism for this phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that mast cells from both 
Fas antigen-deficient mice and Nf1 +/- mice are resistant to apoptosis following 
kit-L withdrawal in vivo. Thus, therapies designed to decrease p21(ras) activity 
and up-regulate Fas antigen expression may limit the pathological accumulation 
of myeloid cells in disease states where p21(ras) is hyperactivated.
