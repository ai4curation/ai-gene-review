The role of regucalcin, which is a regulatory protein in intracellular signaling 
pathway, in the regulation of glucose utilization and lipid production was 
investigated using the cloned rat hepatoma H4-II-E cells overexpressing 
regucalcin. The hepatoma cells (wild-type) and stable 
regucalcin/pCXN2-transfected cells (transfectant) were cultured for 72 h in a 
medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to obtain subconfluent 
monolayers. Cells with subconfluency were cultured for 24 or 72 h in medium 
containing either vehicle or insulin (10(-8) or 10(-7) M) with or without 
supplementation of glucose (10, 25, or 50 mg/ml of medium) in the absence of 
insulin. The production of triglyceride and free fatty acid was significantly 
increased in transfectants cultured without insulin and glucose supplementation 
as compared with that of wild-type cells. The supplementation of glucose (10, 
25, or 50 mg/ml) caused a remarkable increase in medium glucose consumption, 
triglyceride, and free fatty acid productions in transfectants cultured without 
insulin. The presence of insulin (10(-7) M) caused a significant increase in 
medium glucose consumption, triglyceride, and free fatty acid productions in 
wild-type cells cultured with glucose supplementation. These increases were 
significantly prevented in transfectants cultured for 72 h. The expression of 
acetyl-CoA carboxylase, HMG-CoA reductase, glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, and 
glyceroaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) mRNAs in wild-type cells was 
not significantly changed by culture with or without glucose supplementation in 
the presence of insulin. These gene expressions were not significantly changed 
in transfectants. The expression of glucose transporter 2 mRNA was significantly 
increased in transfectants as compared with that of wild-type cells. Such an 
increase was not seen in transfectants cultured in the presence of insulin with 
or without glucose supplementation. This study demonstrates that overexpression 
of regucalcin enhances glucose utilization and lipid production in the cloned 
rat hepatoma H4-II-E cells, and that it regulates the effect of insulin.
