Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a principal regulatory cytokine during an immune 
response and a crucial determinant for allergy and asthma. IL-4 binds with high 
affinity and specificity to the ectodomain of the IL-4 receptor alpha chain 
(IL4-BP). Subsequently, this intermediate complex recruits the common gamma 
chain (gamma c), thereby initiating transmembrane signaling. The crystal 
structure of the intermediate complex between human IL-4 and IL4-BP was 
determined at 2.3 A resolution. It reveals a novel spatial orientation of the 
two proteins, a small but unexpected conformational change in the receptor-bound 
IL-4, and an interface with three separate clusters of trans-interacting 
residues. Novel insights on ligand binding in the cytokine receptor family and a 
paradigm for receptors of IL-2, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15, which all utilize gamma 
c, are provided.
