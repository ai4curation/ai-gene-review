Cystic fibrosis arises from the misfolding and premature degradation of CFTR 
Delta F508, a Cl- ion channel with a single amino acid deletion. Yet, the 
quality-control machinery that selects CFTR Delta F508 for degradation and the 
mechanism for its misfolding are not well defined. We identified an ER 
membrane-associated ubiquitin ligase complex containing the E3 RMA1, the E2 
Ubc6e, and Derlin-1 that cooperates with the cytosolic Hsc70/CHIP E3 complex to 
triage CFTR and CFTR Delta F508. Derlin-1 serves to retain CFTR in the ER 
membrane and interacts with RMA1 and Ubc6e to promote CFTR's proteasomal 
degradation. RMA1 is capable of recognizing folding defects in CFTR Delta F508 
coincident with translation, whereas the CHIP E3 appears to act 
posttranslationally. A folding defect in CFTR Delta F508 detected by RMA1 
involves the inability of CFTR's second membrane-spanning domain to productively 
interact with amino-terminal domains. Thus, the RMA1 and CHIP E3 ubiquitin 
ligases act sequentially in ER membrane and cytosol to monitor the folding 
status of CFTR and CFTR Delta F508.

Abstract

Cystic Fibrosis, one of the most common inherited lethal disease among Caucasians, is caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR protein acts as a gated Cl âˆ’ channel at the apical membrane of epithelial cells, thereby facilitating proper hydration of mucosal linings. Disease causing mutations in the CFTR protein can affect a variety of steps in the biogenesis of a functional protein including the folding and trafficking of CFTR as well as the channel activity of plasma membrane-localized protein. Therefore, current research is focused on the use of small molecules to not only correct folding defects but also to enhance channel activity of mutant CFTR proteins. This review discusses the current knowledge of the folding, trafficking, and gating defects caused by CFTR mutations, the manner by which these defects are monitored by the cell, as well as the strategies which are currently being utilized to develop and screen for small molecule therapeutics.
