Cystic fibrosis arises from the misfolding and premature degradation of CFTR 
Delta F508, a Cl- ion channel with a single amino acid deletion. Yet, the 
quality-control machinery that selects CFTR Delta F508 for degradation and the 
mechanism for its misfolding are not well defined. We identified an ER 
membrane-associated ubiquitin ligase complex containing the E3 RMA1, the E2 
Ubc6e, and Derlin-1 that cooperates with the cytosolic Hsc70/CHIP E3 complex to 
triage CFTR and CFTR Delta F508. Derlin-1 serves to retain CFTR in the ER 
membrane and interacts with RMA1 and Ubc6e to promote CFTR's proteasomal 
degradation. RMA1 is capable of recognizing folding defects in CFTR Delta F508 
coincident with translation, whereas the CHIP E3 appears to act 
posttranslationally. A folding defect in CFTR Delta F508 detected by RMA1 
involves the inability of CFTR's second membrane-spanning domain to productively 
interact with amino-terminal domains. Thus, the RMA1 and CHIP E3 ubiquitin 
ligases act sequentially in ER membrane and cytosol to monitor the folding 
status of CFTR and CFTR Delta F508.
