A human brain cDNA clone encoding glutathione synthetase (EC 6.3.2.3) has been 
sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein is 474 amino acids in 
length with a subunit molecular mass of 52,352 Da. The recombinant protein 
exhibits glutathione synthetase activity and occurs as a homodimer. The 
recombinant glutathione synthetase was purified to homogeneity and had a 
specific activity of 1.73 mumol/min per mg of protein, an isoelectric point of 
5.35 and a pH optimum between 7.0 and 7.5. Southern blots of human genomic DNA 
hybridized with the glutathione synthetase cDNA revealed a relatively simple 
pattern of strongly hybridizing fragments, indicating the absence of a large 
gene family and suggesting that there may be only one glutathione synthetase 
gene in the human genome.
