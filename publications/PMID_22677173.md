Although SPE-39 is a binding protein to Vps33B that is one of the subunit in the 
mammalian HOPS complex, the elements of SPE-39 function remain unknown. Here, we 
show that tyrosine phosphorylation of SPE-39 following EGF stimulation plays a 
role in the stability of SPE-39 itself. Ubiquitination of the C-terminal region 
of SPE-39 was also elevated in response to EGF stimulation, and this process was 
regulated by the phosphorylation of Tyr-11 in SPE-39. However, association of 
Vps33B with SPE-39 inhibited the elevation of ubiquitination of SPE-39 following 
EGF stimulation, which might be responsible for the stabilization of SPE-39. 
Furthermore, an opposing functional relationship between SPE-39 and Vps33B on 
the downregulation of the EGF receptor was observed in EGF-stimulated COS-7 
cells.
