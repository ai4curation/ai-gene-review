Mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) genes increase the 
production of the highly amyloidogenic 42-residue form of amyloid beta-protein 
(Abeta42) in a variety of cell lines and transgenic mice. To elucidate the 
molecular mechanism of this effect, wild-type (wt) or mutant PS1 and PS2 genes 
were stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing endogenous 
or transfected beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). By 
immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis, APP was consistently found to 
coimmunoprecipitate with PS1 or PS2 proteins. Several distinct PS1, PS2, or APP 
antibodies precipitated PS-APP complexes that were detectable by blotting with 
either APP or PS antibodies. Importantly, complex formation could be detected at 
endogenous protein levels in nontransfected cells. In various Chinese hamster 
ovary cell lines, the amounts of APP coprecipitated by PS antibodies were 
proportional to the expression levels of both APP and PS. APP-PS complexes also 
were recovered from human 293 and HS683 cells. Full maturation of APP was not 
required for the interaction; most APP molecules complexed with PS were solely 
N-glycosylated. Treatment of cells with brefeldin A or incubation at 20 degrees 
C did not block complex formation, suggesting that the association between APP 
and PS occurs in part in the endoplasmic reticulum. Complex formation was 
detected for both wt and mutant PS and APP proteins. Deletion of the APP 
C-terminal domain did not abrogate complex formation, suggesting that the 
interaction does not occur in the cytoplasmic domains of the proteins. Our 
results demonstrate that wt and mutant PS1 and PS2 proteins form complexes with 
APP in living cells, strongly supporting the hypothesis that mutant PS interacts 
with APP in a way that enhances the intramembranous proteolysis of the latter by 
a gamma-secretase cleaving at Abeta42.
