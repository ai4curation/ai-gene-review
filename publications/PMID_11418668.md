The sequence of a novel hemopoietic cytokine was discovered in a computational 
screen of genomic databases, and its homology to mouse thymic stromal 
lymphopoietin (TSLP) suggests that it is the human orthologue. Human TSLP is 
proposed to signal through a heterodimeric receptor complex that consists of a 
new member of the hemopoietin family termed human TSLP receptor and the IL-7R 
alpha-chain. Cells transfected with both receptor subunits proliferated in 
response to purified, recombinant human TSLP, with induced phosphorylation of 
Stat3 and Stat5. Human TSLPR and IL-7Ralpha are principally coexpressed on 
monocytes and dendritic cell populations and to a much lesser extent on various 
lymphoid cells. In accord, we find that human TSLP functions mainly on myeloid 
cells; it induces the release of T cell-attracting chemokines from monocytes 
and, in particular, enhances the maturation of CD11c(+) dendritic cells, as 
evidenced by the strong induction of the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD80 
and the enhanced capacity to elicit proliferation of naive T cells.
