A novel 28 kDa glycoprotein was purified from exocytosed material from human 
neutrophils and its primary structure partially determined. Degenerate 
oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify cDNA clones from a human bone 
marrow cDNA library. The deduced 245 amino acid sequence of the 2124 bp 
full-length cDNA showed high degrees of similarity to the deduced sequences of 
human gene TPX-1 and of sperm-coating glycoprotein from rat and mouse. 
Subcellular fractionation of human neutrophils indicated that the protein is 
localized in specific granules. The protein was named SGP28 (specific granule 
protein of 28 kDa).
