We have cloned a novel cell-surface protein designated SPAP1a for SH2 
domain-containing phosphatase anchor protein 1a. SPAP1a belongs to the group of 
type I transmembrane proteins. Its extracellular domain contains a single 
immunoglobulin-like domain, and its intracellular segment has two immunoreceptor 
tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs). We also identified two alternatively 
spliced products that were named SPAP1b and SPAP1c. SPAP1b contains a short 
intracellular part without ITIMs, while SPAP1c lacks the transmembrane segment 
and represents a potential soluble protein. Sequence alignment with the genomic 
database revealed that the SPAP1 gene contains seven exons and is localized at 
chromosome 1q21. PCR analyses demonstrated that SPAP1a mRNA is specifically 
expressed in human hematopoietic tissues including spleen, peripheral blood, and 
bone marrow, and it may be restricted to expression in B cells. Recombinant 
SPAP1a is tyrosine phosphorylated in cells upon pervanadate stimulation and 
tyrosine-phosphorylated SPAP1a recruits the SH2 domain containing phosphatase 
SHP-1, but not SHP-2. As a specific anchor protein of SHP-1, SPAP1a may have an 
important role in hematopoietic cell signaling.
