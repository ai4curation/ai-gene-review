Targeted cancer therapies that use genetics are successful, but principles for 
selectively targeting tumor metabolism that is also dependent on the environment 
remain unknown. We now show that differences in rate-controlling enzymes during 
the Warburg effect (WE), the most prominent hallmark of cancer cell metabolism, 
can be used to predict a response to targeting glucose metabolism. We establish 
a natural product, koningic acid (KA), to be a selective inhibitor of GAPDH, an 
enzyme we characterize to have differential control properties over metabolism 
during the WE. With machine learning and integrated pharmacogenomics and 
metabolomics, we demonstrate that KA efficacy is not determined by the status of 
individual genes, but by the quantitative extent of the WE, leading to a 
therapeutic window in vivo. Thus, the basis of targeting the WE can be encoded 
by molecular principles that extend beyond the status of individual genes.
