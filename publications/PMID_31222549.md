Wnt signaling is important for both skeletal development and bone disease, with 
Wnt inhibitory factors playing critical roles in bone metabolism. SHISA3 blocks 
the maturation and transportation of Frizzled receptors to the cell surface, 
thereby inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in lung cancer. However, 
the function of Shisa3 in bone biology remains uninvestigated. This study found 
that Shisa3 was strongly expressed in the calvarial bones of mice, especially in 
osteoblasts. In addition, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of murine Shisa3 
significantly inhibited Wnt3a-induced nuclear translocation of β-catenin and 
mRNA expression of the Wnt target gene Axin2. In bone phenotype assessments of 
Shisa3 knockout (Shisa3 KO) mice, micro-computed tomography, mRNA expressions of 
osteoblast markers, and skeletal preparations all displayed no significant 
differences compared with Shisa3 wild-type mice. mRNA expression analysis of 
canonical Wnt signaling target genes (Axin2, Lef1, Dkk1, and Tnfrsf11b) in 
calvarial bones at P0.5 also revealed no significant findings. In Axin2Cre/ERT2 
knock-in mice, the number of Axin2-expressing cells in the calvariae of Shisa3 
KO and control mice were comparable. Thus, there appears to be a redundancy in 
the function of Shisa3 in bone development, likely with other Shisa family 
members.
