Glypicans are a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell 
surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). The glypican family, which 
currently includes glypican, the developmentally regulated rat intestinal 
transcript OCI-5, and cerebroglycan, is characterized by a similar core protein 
size and almost complete conservation of cysteine residues. By RT-PCR using 
degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on the sequence homologies, we isolated 
mouse cDNA encoding a novel member of the glypican family as well as mouse 
homologues of glypican and OCI-5. The novel molecule, named K-glypican, has a 
predicted molecular mass of 57.5 kD and potential attachment sites for heparan 
sulfate chains and a GPI anchor in its COOH-terminal region, like other members 
of the glypican family. Transfection of an epitope-tagged full-length K-glypican 
cDNA into MDCK cells demonstrated that K-glypican is indeed expressed as a 
GPI-anchored HSPG. Northern blot analyses with K-glypican, glypican, and OCI-5 
probes demonstrated that kidney and developing brain, and that these three 
molecules show remarkable patterns of cell type- and developmental 
stage-specific expression. In situ hybridization revealed that the major sites 
of K-glypican expression in developing embryo are tubular epithelial cells in 
the kidney and proliferating neuroepithelial cells in the brain. These results 
indicate that K-glypican is a novel GPI-anchored HSPG involved in embryonic 
development.
