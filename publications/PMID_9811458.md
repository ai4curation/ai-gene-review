There are several lines of evidence indicating that the carboxy-terminal region 
of the tumor suppressor protein BRCA1 is a functionally significant domain. 
Using the yeast two-hybrid and in vitro biochemical assays, we show that a 
protein, CtIP, interacts specifically with the carboxy-terminal segment of human 
BRCA1 from residues 1602-1863. A germ line truncation mutation, Y1853ter, that 
removes the last 11 amino acids from the carboxy-terminus of BRCA1, abolishes 
not only its transcriptional activation function, but also binding to CtIP. The 
function of CtIP is unknown, but its reported association with a transcriptional 
repressor CtBP lends further support that it may have a role in transcription. A 
sequence based screen of a panel of 89 tumor cell line cDNAs for mutations in 
the CtIP coding region identified five missense variants. In the pancreatic 
carcinoma cell line, BxPC3, the non-conservative lysine to glutamic acid change 
at codon 337 is accompanied with apparent loss of heterozygosity or 
non-expression of the wild type allele. Thus it is plausible that CtIP may 
itself be a tumor suppressor acting in the same pathway as BRCA1.
