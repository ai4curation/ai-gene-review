14-3-3 proteins are a family of conserved dimeric molecules that bind to a range 
of cellular proteins involved in signal transduction and oncogenesis. Our 
solution of the crystal structure of 14-3-3zeta revealed a conserved amphipathic 
groove that may allow the association of 14-3-3 with diverse ligands (Liu, D., 
Bienkowska, J., Petosa, C., Collier, R. J., Fu, H., and Liddington, R. (1995) 
Nature 376, 191-194). Here, the contributions of three positively charged 
residues (Lys-49, Arg-56, and Arg-60) that lie in this Raf-binding groove were 
investigated. Two of the charge-reversal mutations greatly (K49E) or partially 
(R56E) decreased the interaction of 14-3-3zeta with Raf-1 kinase, whereas R60E 
showed only subtle effects on the binding. Interestingly, these mutations 
exhibited similar effects on the functional interaction of 14-3-3zeta with 
another target protein, exoenzyme S (ExoS), an ADP-ribosyltransferase from 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The EC50 values of 14-3-3zeta required for ExoS 
activation increased by approximately 110-, 5-, and 2-fold for the K49E, R56E, 
and R60E mutants, respectively. The drastic reduction of 14-3-3zeta/ligand 
affinity by the K49E mutation is due to a local electrostatic effect, rather 
than the result of a gross structural alteration, as evidenced by partial 
proteolysis and circular dichroism analysis. This work identifies the first 
point mutation (K49E) that dramatically disrupts 14-3-3zeta/ligand interactions. 
The parallel effects of this single point mutation on both Raf-1 binding and 
ExoS activation strongly suggest that diverse associated proteins share a common 
structural binding determinant on 14-3-3zeta.
