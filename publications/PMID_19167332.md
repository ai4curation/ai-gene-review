How autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved intracellular catabolic system for 
bulk degradation, selectively degrades protein aggregates is poorly understood. 
Here, we show that several maternally derived germ P granule components are 
selectively eliminated by autophagy in somatic cells during C. elegans 
embryogenesis. The activity of sepa-1 is required for the degradation of these P 
granule components and for their accumulation into aggregates, termed PGL 
granules, in autophagy mutants. SEPA-1 forms protein aggregates and is also a 
preferential target of autophagy. SEPA-1 directly binds to the P granule 
component PGL-3 and also to the autophagy protein LGG-1/Atg8. SEPA-1 aggregates 
consistently colocalize with PGL granules and with LGG-1 puncta. Thus, SEPA-1 
functions as a bridging molecule in mediating the specific recognition and 
degradation of P granule components by autophagy. Our study reveals a mechanism 
for preferential degradation of protein aggregates by autophagy and emphasizes 
the physiological significance of selective autophagy during animal development.
