The protein Raf-1, a key mediator of mitogenesis and differentiation, associates 
with p21ras (refs 1-3). However, the regulation of the serine/threonine kinase 
activity of Raf-1 is still not understood. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we 
identified two structurally related proteins that interact with the 
aminoterminal region of Raf-1. These proteins, 14-3-3 zeta (PLA2) and 14-3-3 
beta (HS1), are members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. Expression of 14-3-3 
proteins in Xenopus oocytes enhanced Raf-1 activity and promoted Raf-1-dependent 
oocyte maturation. A dominant negative mutant of Raf-1 blocked the effects of 
14-3-3 protein.
