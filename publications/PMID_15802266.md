Mutations in the Wnt co-receptor LRP5 alter bone mass in humans, but the 
mechanisms responsible for Wnts actions in bone are unclear. To investigate the 
role of the classical Wnt signaling pathway in osteogenesis, we generated mice 
lacking the beta-catenin or adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) genes in 
osteoblasts. Loss of beta-catenin produced severe osteopenia with striking 
increases in osteoclasts, whereas constitutive activation of beta-catenin in the 
conditional Apc mutants resulted in dramatically increased bone deposition and a 
disappearance of osteoclasts. In vitro, osteoblasts lacking the beta-catenin 
gene exhibited impaired maturation and mineralization with elevated expression 
of the osteoclast differentiation factor, receptor activated by nuclear 
factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL), and diminished expression of the RANKL decoy 
receptor, osteoprotegerin. By contrast, Apc-deficient osteoblasts matured 
normally but demonstrated decreased expression of RANKL and increased 
osteoprotegerin. These findings suggest that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in 
osteoblasts coordinates postnatal bone acquisition by controlling the 
differentiation and activity of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts.
