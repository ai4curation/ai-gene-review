Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder that is 
generally inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. However, in some 
families, trans mutant alleles interact with the primary causal locus to 
modulate the penetrance and/or the expressivity of the phenotype. CCDC28B 
(MGC1203) was identified as a second site modifier of BBS encoding a protein of 
unknown function. Here we report the first functional characterization of this 
protein and show it affects ciliogenesis both in cultured cells and in vivo in 
zebrafish. Consistent with this biological role, our in silico analysis shows 
that the presence of CCDC28B homologous sequences is restricted to ciliated 
metazoa. Depletion of Ccdc28b in zebrafish results in defective ciliogenesis and 
consequently causes a number of phenotypes that are characteristic of BBS and 
other ciliopathy mutants including hydrocephalus, left-right axis determination 
defects and renal function impairment. Thus, this work reports CCDC28B as a 
novel protein involved in the process of ciliogenesis whilst providing 
functional insight into the cellular basis of its modifier effect in BBS 
patients.
