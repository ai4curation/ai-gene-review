CTLA-4 is an essential protein in the regulation of T cell responses that 
interacts with two ligands found on the surface of APCs (CD80 and CD86). CTLA-4 
is itself poorly expressed on the T cell surface and is predominantly localized 
to intracellular compartments. We have studied the mechanisms involved in the 
delivery of CTLA-4 to the cell surface using a model Chinese hamster ovary cell 
system and compared this with activated and regulatory human T cells. We have 
shown that expression of CTLA-4 at the plasma membrane (PM) is controlled by 
exocytosis of CTLA-4-containing vesicles and followed by rapid endocytosis. 
Using selective inhibitors and dominant negative mutants, we have shown that 
exocytosis of CTLA-4 is dependent on the activity of the GTPase ADP ribosylation 
factor-1 and on phospholipase D activity. CTLA-4 was identified in a perinuclear 
compartment overlapping with the cis-Golgi marker GM-130 but did not colocalize 
strongly with lysosomal markers such as CD63 and lysosome-associated membrane 
protein. In regulatory T cells, activation of phospholipase D was sufficient to 
trigger release of CTLA-4 to the PM but did not inhibit endocytosis. Taken 
together, these data suggest that CTLA-4 may be stored in a specialized 
compartment in regulatory T cells that can be triggered rapidly for deployment 
to the PM in a phospholipase D- and ADP ribosylation factor-1-dependent manner.
