SNX-2112, a novel inhibitor of Hsp90 currently used as an anti-tumor drug, 
induces apoptosis in multiple tumor cell lines. It destabilizes specific client 
proteins, but the molecular mechanism of the apoptosis effect of SNX-2112 is 
poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the apoptotic effect of SNX-2112 on human 
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) K562 cells. Transcriptomic and proteomic 
approaches further revealed that caspase signals originated from mitochondria 
dysfunction, mediated by Akt signaling pathway inactivity. Additionally, 
SNX-2112 prolonged the survival time of NOD/SCID mice inoculated with K562 tumor 
cells. Our results demonstrated the therapeutic potential of SNX-2112 against 
human CML.
