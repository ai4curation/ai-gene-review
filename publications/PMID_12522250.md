Lymphatic vessels develop from specialized endothelial cells in preexisting 
blood vessels, but the molecular signals that regulate this separation are 
unknown. Here we identify a failure to separate emerging lymphatic vessels from 
blood vessels in mice lacking the hematopoietic signaling protein SLP-76 or Syk. 
Blood-lymphatic connections lead to embryonic hemorrhage and arteriovenous 
shunting. Expression of slp-76 could not be detected in endothelial cells, and 
blood-filled lymphatics also arose in wild-type mice reconstituted with 
SLP-76-deficient bone marrow. These studies reveal a hematopoietic signaling 
pathway required for separation of the two major vascular networks in mammals.

Abstract

Lymphatic vessels develop from specialized endothelial cells in preexisting blood vessels, but the molecular signals that regulate this separation are unknown. Here we identify a failure to separate emerging lymphatic vessels from blood vessels in mice lacking the hematopoietic signaling protein SLP-76 or Syk. Blood-lymphatic connections lead to embryonic hemorrhage and arteriovenous shunting. Expression of slp-76 could not be detected in endothelial cells, and blood-filled lymphatics also arose in wild-type mice reconstituted with SLP-76 â€“ deficient bone marrow. These studies reveal a hematopoietic signaling pathway required for separation of the two major vascular networks in mammals.
