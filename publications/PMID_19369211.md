Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 and 2 (BRCA1 and BRCA2) 
predispose individuals to breast and ovarian cancer development. We previously 
reported an in vivo interaction between BRCA1 and BRCA2. However, the biological 
significance of their association is thus far undefined. Here, we report that 
PALB2, the partner and localizer of BRCA2, binds directly to BRCA1, and serves 
as the molecular scaffold in the formation of the BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. The 
association between BRCA1 and PALB2 is primarily mediated via apolar bonding 
between their respective coiled-coil domains. More importantly, BRCA1 mutations 
identified in cancer patients disrupted the specific interaction between BRCA1 
and PALB2. Consistent with the converging functions of the BRCA proteins in DNA 
repair, cells harboring mutations with abrogated BRCA1-PALB2 interaction 
resulted in defective homologous recombination (HR) repair. We propose that, via 
its direct interaction with PALB2, BRCA1 fine-tunes recombinational repair 
partly through its modulatory role in the PALB2-dependent loading of BRCA2-RAD51 
repair machinery at DNA breaks. Our findings uncover PALB2 as the molecular 
adaptor between the BRCA proteins, and suggest that impaired HR repair is one of 
the fundamental causes for genomic instability and tumorigenesis observed in 
patients carrying BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 mutations.
