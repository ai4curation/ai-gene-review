Cellular information processing via reversible protein phosphorylation requires 
tight control of the localization, activity, and substrate specificity of 
protein kinases, which to a large extent is accomplished by complex formation 
with other proteins. Despite their critical role in cellular regulation and 
pathogenesis, protein interaction information is available for only a subset of 
the 518 human protein kinases. Here we present a global proteomic analysis of 
complexes of the human CMGC kinase group. In addition to subgroup-specific 
functional enrichment and modularity, the identified 652 high-confidence 
kinase-protein interactions provide a specific biochemical context for many 
poorly studied CMGC kinases. Furthermore, the analysis revealed a kinase-kinase 
subnetwork and candidate substrates for CMGC kinases. Finally, the presented 
interaction proteome uncovered a large set of interactions with proteins 
genetically linked to a range of human diseases, including cancer, suggesting 
additional routes for analyzing the role of CMGC kinases in controlling human 
disease pathways.
