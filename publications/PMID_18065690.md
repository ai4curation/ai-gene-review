The conserved eukaryotic protein SGT1 (for Suppressor of G2 allele of skp1) has 
characteristics of an HSP90 (for heat shock protein 90 kD) cochaperone and in 
plants regulates hormone responses and Resistance gene-triggered immunity. We 
affinity-purified SGT1-interacting proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana leaf 
extracts and identified by mass spectrometry cytosolic heat shock cognate 70 
(HSC70) chaperones as the major stable SGT1 interactors. Arabidopsis SGT1a and 
SGT1b proteins associate with HSC70 in vivo and distribute with HSC70 in the 
cytosol and nucleus. An intact C-terminal SGT1-specific (SGS) domain that is 
required for all known SGT1b functions in immunity and development is needed for 
HSC70 interaction and for the nuclear accumulation of SGT1b. Interaction assays 
of transiently expressed proteins or their domains in Nicotiana benthamiana 
point to a role of SGT1 as a HSC70 cofactor. Expression of two HSC70 isoforms is 
upregulated by pathogen challenge, and while loss of function of individual 
cytosolic HSC70 genes has no defense phenotype, HSC70-1 overexpression disables 
resistance to virulent and avirulent pathogens. Moreover, mutations in SGT1b 
lead to a similar degree of heat shock tolerance as deregulation of HSC70-1. We 
conclude that an HSC70-SGT1 chaperone complex is important for multiple plant 
environmental responses and that the evolutionarily conserved SGS domain of SGT1 
is a key determinant of the HSC70-SGT1 association.

We conclude that an HSC70-SGT1 chaperone complex is important for multiple plant environmental responses and that the evolutionarily conserved SGS domain of SGT1 is a key determinant of the HSC70–SGT1 association.

INTRODUCTION

Molecular chaperones are essential for cell viability by ensuring the proper folding of nascent polypeptides, protein complex maturation, and the translocation of proteins through membranes. In eukaryotic cells, the conserved chaperones of the Hsp90 (for heat shock protein 90 kD) and DnaK/Hsc70 (for heat shock cognate 70 kD) families control cellular protein homeostasis through ATP-dependent cycles ( Young et al., 2003 ). Hsc70 predominantly binds nonnative polypeptides and folding intermediates that are either newly synthesized or stress-induced ( Erbse et al., 2004 ; Bukau et al., 2006 ). By contrast, Hsp90 chaperones bind proteins in their near-native state and mediate the maturation and activation of signaling complexes ( Young et al., 2003 ). In yeast and mammalian cells, the activities of Hsp90 and Hsc70 are modulated by a complex network of cochaperones that define the balance of protein assembly and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery ( Esser et al., 2004 ; Bukau et al., 2006 ).

Sgt1 (for Suppressor of G2 allele of skp1 ) is a conserved, essential protein in eukaryotes that interacts with multiple protein complexes and has features of a cochaperone ( Shirasu and Schulze-Lefert, 2003 ). The Sgt1 protein has three domains: an N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain that resembles the folds of Hop/Sti1 (for Hsp70/Hsp90 organizing protein); a central CHORD-Sgt1 (CS) domain that is similar to the Hsp20/α-crystallin domain of the human p23 cochaperone family; and a C-terminal Sgt1-specific (SGS) domain that is structurally less well defined although highly conserved relative to the other SGT1 domains ( Dubacq et al., 2002 ; Garcia-Ranea et al., 2002 ; Lee et al., 2004 ). Yeast Sgt1p associates with Skp1p (for Suppressor of kinetochore protein) and Hsp90p through its TPR and CS domains, respectively, and is needed to assemble an active centromere binding factor3 kinetochore complex in cell cycle progression ( Kitagawa et al., 1999 ; Bansal et al., 2004 ; Lingelbach and Kaplan, 2004 ; Catlett and Kaplan, 2006 ). Yeast Sgt1p is also required for activation of an SCF (for Skp1-Cul1-F box) ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates the ubiquitination of Sic2p, an inhibitor of Cdc28 kinase ( Kitagawa et al., 1999 ). A Skp1p-independent but essential function of Sgt1p was identified in the activation of the yeast adenylyl cyclase (Cyr1p) protein through interaction between the Sgt1p SGS and Cyr1p leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains ( Dubacq et al., 2002 ). Thus, Sgt1 has a role in diverse signaling processes.

Plant SGT1 proteins associate with cytosolic HSP90s in vivo, consistent with a conserved cochaperone activity ( Hubert et al., 2003 ; Takahashi et al., 2003 ; Liu et al., 2004 ). Also, in tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ) and barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) extracts, SGT1 coimmunoprecipitated with the SCF structural subunits SKP1 and CUL1 and the COP9 signalosome that regulates the SCF ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system ( Azevedo et al., 2002 ; Liu et al., 2002a ). A link between SGT1 in plants and yeast ( Kitagawa et al., 1999 ; Lyapina et al., 2001 ) with components of the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery suggests that SGT1 may assist in the controlled degradation of target proteins. Indeed, the loss of Arabidopsis thaliana SGT1b (one of two functional Arabidopsis SGT1 genes, SGT1a and SGT1b ) compromised the functions of SCF TIR1 and SCF COI1 that mediate the ubiquitination-dependent degradation of proteins in response to the phytohormones auxin and jasmonic acid, respectively ( Gray et al., 2003 ).

Plant SGT1 interacts through its CS domain with another cytosolic HSP90 binding protein, RAR1 (for Required for Mla12 Resistance) ( Hubert et al., 2003 ; Takahashi et al., 2003 ; Liu et al., 2004 ), and both RAR1 and SGT1 were identified as components of plant resistance mediated by intracellular nucleotide binding–leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) immune receptors ( Shirasu et al., 1999 ; Austin et al., 2002 ; Azevedo et al., 2002 ; Liu et al., 2002b ; Muskett et al., 2002 ; Tornero et al., 2002 ). A body of genetic and molecular evidence points to functions of plant SGT1 and RAR1 as cofactors in HSP90-mediated stabilization of preactivated NB-LRR protein complexes ( Tornero et al., 2002 ; Hubert et al., 2003 ; Lu et al., 2003 ; Bieri et al., 2004 ; Liu et al., 2004 ; Azevedo et al., 2006 ). These receptors (also known as R proteins) are present in the cell in a constrained conformation and can be specifically activated by the action of pathogen-derived effectors ( Shirasu and Schulze-Lefert, 2003 ). Pathogen recognition potentiates low-level basal defense that limits the growth of virulent pathogens and is often accompanied by localized programmed cell death ( Chisholm et al., 2006 ). SGT1 can interact with the LRR domains of certain NB-LRR proteins and may assist in their proper folding ( Bieri et al., 2004 ; Leister et al., 2005 ). There is no evidence for a direct association of RAR1 with NB-LRR proteins; therefore, RAR1 may operate at another level of immune receptor assembly or maintenance. While genetically additive contributions of SGT1b and RAR1 were observed in resistance mediated by the NB-LRR genes Arabidopsis RPP5 and barley MLA6 ( Austin et al., 2002 ; Azevedo et al., 2002 ), an antagonistic relationship was found between SGT1b and the assembly roles of RAR1 and HSP90 in certain Arabidopsis NB-LRR conditioned responses ( Holt et al., 2005 ). This likely reflects a fine balance between the assembly and degradative activities of the chaperone/cochaperone machineries in maintaining NB-LRR proteins poised for activation. Also, the Arabidopsis SGT1 homolog SGT1a may compensate for the loss of SGT1b in controlling the steady state levels of certain NB-LRR proteins, since SGT1a has intrinsic SGT1 activity but is expressed at a lower level than SGT1b ( Azevedo et al., 2006 ). SGT1a and SGT1b have redundant essential roles in early embryo development, but only mutations in SGT1b compromise plant immunity or auxin signaling ( Azevedo et al., 2006 ).

Therefore, SGT1 is necessary for plant development and disease resistance, but it is unclear how it operates molecularly and whether its activity as a HSP90 cofactor accounts entirely for its diverse cellular functions. We report here that affinity purification–tagged Arabidopsis SGT1 protein interacts stably with cytosolic/nuclear HSC70 chaperones in vivo. This interaction occurs with native SGT1 protein and requires an intact SGS domain for which no direct partners were known. Mutations in SGT1b and deregulation of HSC70-1, the predominant cytosolic HSC70 isoform in Arabidopsis , disable R protein–specified and basal disease resistance and lead to increased heat shock tolerance. We conclude that the SGT1–HSC70 association is important for the regulation of plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses.

DISCUSSION

We present evidence that two functional isoforms of Arabidopsis SGT1, SGT1a and SGT1b, form stable interactions with cytosolic/nuclear HSC70 chaperones in vivo and that these interactions depend on the SGS domain of SGT1. Several observations point to SGT1 behavior as a HSC70 cofactor rather than a substrate. First, SGT1 is not bound strongly by the HSC70 client binding domain. Second, interaction between SGT1b eta3 and HSC70 is reduced, arguing against potentially misfolded SGT1 serving as an HSC70 client. Third, the 36 residues that are missing in SGT1b eta3 form part of a hydrophilic domain with helices that are not optimally recognized as a substrate by HSC70 chaperones ( Rudiger et al., 1997 ; Lee et al., 2004 ). Resistance responses in Arabidopsis to virulent and avirulent pathogen isolates are compromised both by mutations in SGT1b and by deregulation of HSC70-1 expression. This newly identified connection between SGT1 and HSC70 activities correlates with an enhanced heat shock tolerance of sgt1b mutants, resembling the HSC70-1 overexpression phenotype. Together with the colocalization of SGT1 and HSC70 proteins in the cytosol and nuclei, these data lead us to propose that the interaction between SGT1 and HSC70 chaperones is important for plant defense against pathogens and some other stress responses that are controlled by HSC70 chaperones. Our findings are reinforced by a global study of the yeast Hsp90 interaction network that identified Sgt1 as an Hsc70 (Ssa1, Ssa2) interactor ( Zhao et al., 2005 ). Also, coimmunoprecipitation of human Sgt1 and Hsp70 was recently reported after transfection of cultured cells and in ELISAs of recombinant proteins ( Spiechowicz et al., 2007 ). The analysis by Spiechowicz et al. (2007) and results from our size-exclusion and N. benthamiana interaction assays ( Figures 4 and 5 ) support direct chaperone–cochaperone binding. However, we did not observe any specific interaction between recombinant SGT1 and HSC70-1 in vitro or in yeast two-hybrid assays; therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that their association is mediated or assisted by another component.
