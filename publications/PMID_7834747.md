Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a 
novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-1. The BAG-1 protein shares no 
significant homology with Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form 
homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell 
line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased 
protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, 
anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene 
transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or Bcl-2 protein alone. 
BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in 
response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a 
new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis 
induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect 
a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.
