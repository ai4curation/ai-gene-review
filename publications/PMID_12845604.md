Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-modified (GPI) proteins share structural features 
that allow their identification using a genomic approach. From the known S. 
cerevisiae and C. albicans GPI proteins, the following consensus sequence for 
the GPI attachment site and its downstream region was derived: 
[NSGDAC]-[GASVIETKDLF]-[GASV]-X(4,19)-[FILMVAGPSTCYWN](10)>, where > indicates 
the C-terminal end of the protein. This consensus sequence, which recognized 
known GPI proteins from various fungi, was used to screen the genomes of the 
yeasts S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, Sz. pombe and the filamentous fungus N. 
crassa for putative GPI proteins. The subsets of proteins so obtained were 
further screened for the presence of an N-terminal signal sequence for the 
secretion and absence of internal transmembrane domains. In this way, we 
identified 66 putative GPI proteins in S. cerevisiae. Some of these are known 
GPI proteins that were not identified by earlier genomic analyses, indicating 
that this selection procedure renders a more complete image of the S. cerevisiae 
GPI proteome. Using the same approach, 104 putative GPI proteins were identified 
in the human pathogen C. albicans. Among these were the proteins Gas/Phr, Ecm33, 
Crh and Plb, all members of GPI protein families that are also present in S. 
cerevisiae. In addition, several proteins and protein families with no 
significant homology to S. cerevisiae proteins were identified, including the 
cell wall-associated Als, Csa1/Rbt5, Hwp1/Rbt1 and Hyr1 protein families. In Sz. 
pombe, which has a low level of (galacto)mannan in the cell wall compared to C. 
albicans and S. cerevisiae, only 33 GPI candidates were identified and in N. 
crassa 97. BLAST searches revealed that about half of the putative GPI proteins 
that were identified in Sz. pombe and N. crassa are homologous to known or 
putative GPI proteins from other fungi. We conclude that our algorithm is 
selective and can also be used for GPI protein identification in other fungi.

Fungal cell walls are essential for growth, division, and survival, and are prime targets for antifungal therapy. Here, we identify two conserved α-amylase-like enzymes, Aah1 and Aah3, as redundant key contributors to α-glucan remodeling in the cell wall of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Using solid-state NMR spectroscopy on intact cells, we show that these enzymes are required for normal wall composition, structure, and mechanics. Their absence leads to reduced α-glucans, increased β-glucans, and altered polysaccharide dynamics. We also uncover in vivo structural polymorphs of glucans, revealing aspects of fungal wall complexity. As similar enzymes exist in many fungi, including pathogens, these findings highlight broadly relevant targets for antifungal drug development.

Cell walls are critical structures of fungi, bacteria, and plants, providing mechanical strength, maintaining shape, and protecting cells from environmental stress. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the α-glucan synthase Ags1 produces α-1,3-glucan chains essential for cell wall integrity, but how these chains are further assembled into mature polymers is not understood. Here, we identify two conserved glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored α-amylase-like enzymes, Aah1 and Aah3, which act redundantly as key contributors to α-glucan network formation. Cells lacking both enzymes exhibit severe growth and morphological defects, including rounded shape, delayed division, and cell clumping. Using solid-state NMR spectroscopy of intact cells, we show that the double mutant cell walls have dramatically reduced α-1,3-glucan and galactomannan content, with a compensatory increase in β-glucans driven by the activation of the cell integrity pathway. These changes correlate with cell wall thickening, increased rigidity, and reduced polymer mobility and hydration. We also uncover in vivo polymorphic forms of α- and β-glucans, some of which are selectively lost or gained in the mutant cells. Our data suggest that Aah1 and Aah3 function as GH13-family transglycosylases that collaborate nonredundantly with the α-glucan synthase to build a properly organized α-glucan matrix. These findings highlight a previously unrecognized layer of complexity in fungal cell wall biosynthesis and point to GH13-family enzymes as potential antifungal targets given that related enzymes are found in many fungi.
