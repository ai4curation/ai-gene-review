CD4 is the primary receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Nef is 
an accessory protein of HIV that decreases the expression of CD4 on the surface 
of infected cells. In this study, we identified the Nef binding protein 1 
(NBP1), which interacts specifically with Nef in vitro and in vivo. Since it 
shares sequence similarity with the catalytic subunit of the vacuolar ATPase 
(V-ATPase) and complements the loss of this VMA13 gene in yeast, NBP1 is the 
human homolog of Vma13p. Direct interactions between Nef and NBP1 were 
correlated with the ability of Nef to internalize CD4. The expression of the 
antisense NBP1 abrogated these effects. We conclude that NBP1 helps to connect 
Nef with the endocytic pathway.
