A human gene encoding the c-myc purine-binding transcription factor PuF was 
identified by screening of a cervical carcinoma cell complementary DNA library 
with a DNA fragment containing PuF binding sites. The 17-kilodalton bacterially 
produced PuF was shown to have biological activity and properties similar to 
that of human PuF. DNA sequence analysis of recombinant PuF revealed perfect 
identity with the human nm23-H2 nucleoside diphosphate kinase gene, a potential 
negative regulator of cancer metastasis. These results provide a link between 
nm23 and the c-myc oncogene and suggest that the nm23 protein can function in 
vitro in the transcriptional regulation of c-myc expression.
