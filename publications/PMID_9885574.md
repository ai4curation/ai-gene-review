PCAF histone acetylase is found in a complex with more than 20 associated 
polypeptides. Here we report cloning and characterization of the 400 kDa 
PCAF-associated factor referred to as PAF400. PAF400 is almost identical to 
TRRAP, which binds to c-Myc and E2F, and has significant sequence similarities 
to the ATM superfamily including FRAP, ATM, ATR, and the catalytic subunit of 
DNA-PK. Remarkably, PAF400 and FRAP share sequence similarity in broad regions 
that cover 80% of the entire PAF400 sequence. However, unlike the other members 
of the ATM superfamily, PAF400 is not a protein kinase as judged from the lack 
of kinase motif and autophosphorylation activity. We discuss the possibility 
that PAF400 may play a role in signaling of DNA damage to p53 by stimulation of 
p53 acetylation.
