Endocytosed membrane components are recycled to the cell surface either directly 
from early/sorting endosomes or after going through the endocytic recycling 
compartment (ERC). Studying recycling mechanisms is difficult, in part due to 
the fact that specific tools to inhibit this process are scarce. In this study, 
we have characterized a novel widely expressed protein, named Rififylin (Rffl) 
for RING Finger and FYVE-like domain-containing protein, that, when 
overexpressed in HeLa cells, induced the condensation of transferrin receptor-, 
Rab5-, and Rab11-positive recycling tubulovesicular membranes in the perinuclear 
region. Internalized transferrin was able to access these condensed endosomes 
but its exit from this compartment was delayed. Using deletion mutants, we show 
that the carboxy-terminal RING finger of Rffl is dispensable for its action. In 
contrast, the amino-terminal domain of Rffl, which shows similarities with the 
phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate-binding FYVE finger, is critical for the 
recruitment of Rffl to recycling endocytic membranes and for the inhibition of 
recycling, albeit in a manner that is independent of PtdIns(3)-kinase activity. 
Rffl overexpression represents a novel means to inhibit recycling that will help 
to understand the mechanisms involved in recycling from the ERC to the plasma 
membrane.

Abstract

Endocytosed membrane components are recycled to the cell surface either directly from early/sorting endosomes or after going through the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC). Studying recycling mechanisms is difficult, in part due to the fact that specific tools to inhibit this process are scarce. In this study, we have characterized a novel widely expressed protein, named Rififylin (Rffl) for RI NG Fi nger and FY VE- li ke domain-containing protein, that, when overexpressed in HeLa cells, induced the condensation of transferrin receptor-, Rab5-, and Rab11-positive recycling tubulovesicular membranes in the perinuclear region. Internalized transferrin was able to access these condensed endosomes but its exit from this compartment was delayed. Using deletion mutants, we show that the carboxy-terminal RING finger of Rffl is dispensable for its action. In contrast, the amino-terminal domain of Rffl, which shows similarities with the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate–binding FYVE finger, is critical for the recruitment of Rffl to recycling endocytic membranes and for the inhibition of recycling, albeit in a manner that is independent of PtdIns(3)-kinase activity. Rffl overexpression represents a novel means to inhibit recycling that will help to understand the mechanisms involved in recycling from the ERC to the plasma membrane.

INTRODUCTION

Endocytosis is a fundamental cellular process, whereby extracellular material as well as plasma membrane proteins and lipids are internalized and transported to various intracellular compartments ( Mukherjee et al., 1997 ). Initially, internalized molecules are delivered to early/sorting endosomes, which constitute the first sorting station of the pathway. Ligands may dissociate from their receptor at the mildly acidic pH of the early/sorting endosomes and are then targeted to the late endosome degradation compartment, whereas receptors may be transported back to the plasma membrane through recycling endosomes. Underlying the complexity and dynamic nature of the endocytic compartment, a large array of cellular proteins act together to ensure complex sorting decisions and precise targeting of internalized molecules.

About 95% of endocytosed membrane is recycled to the plasma membrane. This recycling is important for the maintenance of membrane composition and for receptors involved in nutrient uptake as well as for other several cellular processes. To study the recycling pathway, the transferrin receptor (TfR) and its ligand transferrin (Tf) have been used extensively (reviewed in Mellman, 1996 ; Mukherjee et al., 1997 ; Maxfield and McGraw, 2004 ). Within early endosomes, Fe 3+ dissociates from Tf and the TfR-Tf complexes, either return directly to the plasma membrane or reach a network of tubular membranes, called the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) before returning to the plasma membrane. These two pathways are believed to rely on distinct molecular machineries and the functional significance of these two recycling pathways is poorly understood. Some evidence indicates that ERC has sorting abilities. Indeed, ERC has been shown to be instrumental in basolateral/apical sorting in epithelial cells ( Apodaca et al., 1994 ; Knight et al., 1995 ) as well as to be involved in the delivery of membrane proteins to the trans -Golgi network (TGN; Ghosh et al., 1998 ). ERC may therefore represent, in addition to early/sorting endosomes, another sorting station along the recycling pathway.

Only a few molecules involved in the function of the ERC have been identified so far. Among the large Rab family ( Zerial and McBride, 2001 ), Rab11 has been shown to localize to and to function in endocytic recycling from the ERC to the plasma membrane ( Ullrich et al., 1996 ) and the TGN ( Wilcke et al., 2000 ). Several Rab11-interacting proteins have been isolated: Rab11BP/Rabphillin11 ( Zeng et al., 1999 ), myosin Vb ( Lapierre et al., 2001 ), and members of the Rab11-FIP family ( Lindsay et al., 2002 ; Lindsay and McCaffrey, 2002 ; Meyers and Prekeris, 2002 ; Wallace et al., 2002a , 2002b ). Overexpression of truncated versions of some of these proteins alters the morphology of the Rab11-positive compartment, sometimes affecting Tf recycling, indicating that they participate in the functions of Rab11 in the ERC. Syntaxin13, a member of the SNARE protein family, is found preferentially associated with recycling endosomes, where it plays a role in membrane fusion events during recycling of plasma membrane proteins ( Prekeris et al., 1998 ). Rme-1, a protein identified in a genetic screen for endocytosis mutants in Caenorhabditis elegans , has been reported to be involved in the exit of membrane proteins from the ERC to the TGN and the plasma membrane ( Lin et al., 2001 ). Altogether, very little is known about the regulation of membrane trafficking through the ERC ( Maxfield and McGraw, 2004 ). A major difficulty stems from the paucity of specific tools to inhibit recycling and from the existence of several recycling pathways.

We have identified a novel gene coding for a protein, Rififylin (Rffl), containing both a FYVE-like domain and a RING finger in the amino- and carboxy-terminal region, respectively. Using deletion mutant analysis, we found that the amino-terminal domain is a key component of Rffl. This domain presents sequence similarities with the well-characterized phosphatidyl-inositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P)-binding FYVE finger. It is instrumental for Rffl recruitment to recycling endosome, but in contrast to FYVE fingers, is not dependent on PtdIns(3)-kinase activity. We show that overexpression of Rffl alters both the morphology and the function of recycling endosomes, as illustrated by the massive accumulation of TfR and Rab11 in the perinuclear region and the inhibition of Tf recycling.

DISCUSSION

The term ERC refers to a set of endocytic membranes, essentially tubules, that usually concentrate in the perinuclear region of the cell and in which membrane components following the endocytic recycling pathway travel. Few proteins were shown to localize to the ERC ( Prekeris et al., 1998 ; Lin et al., 2001 ; Lindsay et al., 2002 ; Lindsay and McCaffrey, 2002 ; Meyers and Prekeris, 2002 ; Wallace et al., 2002a , 2002b ). However, how these different proteins intervene in ERC function is largely unknown ( Maxfield and McGraw, 2004 ).

In the present study, we have identified a novel protein, Rffl, that, when overexpressed in HeLa cells, localized to and induced the condensation of endosomal structures displaying TfR, Rab5, and Rab11 markers into several perinuclear globular structures. In contrast, the localization of EEA1, another marker of the early endocytic endosomes was not altered by Rffl overexpression. Finally, lysosomal markers, like Lamp2, or markers of secretory organelles, including the TGN, were not affected by Rffl overexpression. Consistently with confocal microscopy data, ultrastructural analysis showed that Rffl was mainly located on densely packed tubulovesicular membrane profiles. Altogether, these data suggest that the compartment affected by Rffl overexpression is the ERC.

Furthermore, recycling of TfR was inhibited by Rffl overexpression. Indeed, the aggregated recycling endosomes were accessible to endocytosed TfR-Tf complexes. However, recycling from the Rffl-positive compartment was delayed, Tf being still detected in the perinuclear region of transfected cells after several hours of chase. Recycling of membrane proteins can occur through at least two different routes that appear to depend on different molecular machineries ( Hao and Maxfield, 2000 ; Sheff et al., 2002 ). Rffl is involved in the recycling of only part of endocytosed TfR, suggesting that it affects the dynamics of a subdomain of recycling endosomes. The cumulative inhibitory effects of Rffl overexpression and of LY294002 treatment on Tf recycling suggests that Rffl acts mainly on a PtdIns(3)-kinase independent recycling pathway. This is consistent with our observations that Rffl affects the ERC and the proposal that, in HeLa cells, PtdIns(3)-kinase activity is required for recycling directly from early endosomes, a recycling route that bypasses the ERC ( van Dam et al., 2002 ).

We observed a major redistribution of Rab5 immunostaining upon Rffl overexpression. In normal cells, Rab5 overlaps extensively with EEA1 ( Simonsen et al., 1998 ; Lawe et al., 2000 ), whereas it shows little colocalization with Rab11 ( Sonnichsen et al., 2000 ). In transfected cells, both Rab5 and Rab11 but not EEA1 concentrate in the aggregated recycling endosomes. This is a striking observation because EEA1 is a Rab5 effector ( Simonsen et al., 1998 ) and perturbations of the endocytic pathway that affect Rab5 without affecting EEA1 have not been reported so far. The way in which Rab5-positive endocytic membranes are disturbed by Rffl overexpression is unknown. However, it is unlikely to rely on direct physical interactions between Rab5 and Rffl, because the two proteins failed to interact in a yeast two-hybrid assay (F.Coumailleau and M.Cohen-Tannoudji, unpublished observations).

Concerning late endosomes, we noticed that some CD63-positive vesicles showed a tendency to be distributed around the aggregated Rffl-GFP–positive recycling endosomes. These surrounding endosomes appeared at the electron microscopy level as vacuoles with a limited amount of internal CD63-containing membranes and may correspond to early multivesicular bodies (MVB). We observed some Rffl staining on the limiting membrane of MVB-like endosomes, suggesting that Rffl overexpression might also perturb this compartment but to a much lesser extent than ERC.

Rffl is a previously uncharacterized protein that contains a zinc finger domain at both ends. The amino-terminal domain is similar to the well-characterized PtdIns(3)P-binding FYVE finger but presents noticeable departures from the consensus sequence in particular at the level of the core R(R/K)HHCR sequence, which is the principal site of interaction with PtdIns(3)P ( Dumas et al., 2001 ; Stenmark et al., 2002 ). For this reason, we named it FYVE-like domain. Besides sequence similarities, the FYVE-like domain of Rffl shares other similarities with bona fide FYVE domains. Indeed, we have shown that it was necessary for the recruitment of Rffl to endocytic membranes. In addition, it is sufficient, if duplicated, to target GFP to endosomes. This is reminiscent of what has been described for the FYVE domains of EEA1 and Hrs ( Stenmark et al., 1996 ; Gillooly et al., 2000 ; Lawe et al., 2000 ). In these cases, the fact that isolated FYVE domains were not targeted to endosomes has been interpreted as due to a weak affinity for PtdIns(3)P that could be compensated by duplication. Similarly, the FYVE-like domain of Rffl may mediate weak interactions with components of recycling endocytic membranes, the nature and the identity of which remain to be identified. Importantly, major differences exist that distinguish the Rffl FYVE-like domain from bona fide FYVE domain. First, Rffl was found on membranes with characteristic of recycling endosomes and did not overlap with EEA1-positive early endosomes membranes. On the contrary, bona fide FYVE domain-containing proteins localize to PtdIns(3)P-containing membranes, i.e., early endosomes and internal vesicles of the MVB ( Gillooly et al., 2000 ). These proteins play important roles in endocytic membrane trafficking such as early endosome fusion (EEA1; Simonsen et al., 1998 ), traffic from early endosome to recycling endosomes (Rabip4 and Rabenosyn-5; Nielsen et al., 2000 ; Cormont et al., 2001 ; de Renzis et al., 2002 ), or from early endosome to late endosomes (Hrs and PikFYVE; Komada and Soriano, 1999 ; Ikonomov et al., 2001 ; Raiborg et al., 2002 ) but are not involved in traffic from ERC to plasma membrane. A second important difference is that endosomal localization of full-length Rffl or DFL-GFP is independent of PtdIns(3)-kinase activity, whereas that of bona fide FYVE domain-containing proteins is not. This indicates that, as already suggested by the amino-acid sequence, Rffl FYVE-like domain does not bind to PtdIns(3)P. It is therefore not surprising that Rffl does not localize to PtdIns(3)P-enriched membranes. Of special interest will be the characterization of the natural ligand of the FYVE-like domain.

The second zinc finger domain of Rffl is a carboxy-terminal RING finger motif. Within the past few years, evidence has accumulated arguing in favor of a general role in ubiquitination for RING finger-containing proteins ( Freemont, 2000 ; Weissman, 2001 ). Recently, it has been shown that SAKURA, the rat ortholog of Rffl, exhibited E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and ex vivo ( Araki et al., 2003 ). However, the RING domain of Rffl does not appear to participate in the recycling inhibition mediated by Rffl overexpression because similar perturbations of recycling endosomes were obtained upon transfection of full-length and RING finger-deleted version of Rffl (Rffl-ΔCter).

Exactly how Rffl could affect the morphology and the function of the ERC is unclear. However, it should be noted that inhibition of Tf recycling was obtained by overexpressing the full-length protein. This is in contrast with other proposed ERC regulatory proteins for which recycling was affected upon overexpression of constitutively active or inactive forms (Rab4, Rab11) or dominant negative mutated or truncated proteins (RCP, Rme1, Rab11BP/Rabphillin11), whereas the overexpression of full-length proteins had little or no effect on the Tf recycling pathway ( van der Sluijs et al., 1992 ; Ullrich et al., 1996 ; Zeng et al., 1999 ; Wilcke et al., 2000 ; Lin et al., 2001 ; McCaffrey et al., 2001 ; Lindsay et al., 2002 ). Therefore, the phenotype observed in cells overexpressing Rffl may be due to enhancement of the normal functions of Rffl, resulting in excess Rffl activity. Underlying this hypothesis is the assumption that in untransfected cells Rffl is a limiting component. When the FYVE-like domain of Rffl was removed, the protein remained cytosolic and inhibition of Tf recycling was no longer observed. This suggests that association of Rffl with ERC membranes is necessary for its interference with recycling. Interestingly, we found that DFL-GFP has an inhibitory effect on recycling. This could be the consequence of the occupancy of FYVE-like domain binding sites on ERC membranes by DFL-GFP and the consecutive displacement of endogenous Rffl or other proteins targeted to ERC membranes through similar mechanism.

In conclusion, we have characterized a new protein that, when overexpressed, alters both the morphology and the function of the ERC. Further studies on how Rffl overexpression inhibits recycling from ERC to the plasma membrane will certainly help to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying membranes proteins trafficking along this poorly characterized compartment.
