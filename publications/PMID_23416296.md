Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a critical 
transcriptional factor in a variety of cellular processes, and is frequently 
over-activated in a range of human tumors. However, the processes that regulate 
STAT3 activation need to be further clarified. With a yeast two-hybrid 
screening, we identified enoyl-CoA hydratase short chain 1 (ECHS1) as a novel 
STAT3 binding protein. We further confirmed the interaction between STAT3 and 
ECHS1 by GST-pull down and co-immnunoprecipitation. Importantly, we found that 
ECHS1 specifically represses STAT3 activity and negatively regulates the 
expression of several target genes of STAT3 through inhibiting STAT3 
phosphorylation. Therefore, our findings will provide new insights into the 
mechanism of STAT3 signaling regulation.
