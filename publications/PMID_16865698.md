Disruption of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB1/TGF-beta) signaling 
contributes to the formation of human hematological malignancies. Smad4, a tumor 
suppressor, functions as an essential intracellular signal transducer of the 
TGF-beta signaling pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that some 
tumor-derived mutations of Smad4 are associated with protein instability; 
however, the precise mechanism by which mutated Smad4 proteins undergo rapid 
degradation remains to be elucidated. A missense mutation of the SMAD4 gene in 
the Mad homology 1 (MH1) domain (c.305C>T, Pro102Leu) and one frameshift 
mutation resulting in termination in the Mad homology 2 (MH2) domain 
(c.1447_1448insAATA, Delta483-552) have been identified in acute myelogenous 
leukemia. It is not known whether protein instability of these SMAD4 mutants is 
one of the contributors to TGF-beta signaling disruption in acute myelogenous 
leukemia. Here we report that these two acute myelogenous leukemia-derived SMAD4 
mutants are degraded rapidly when compared to their wild-type counterpart. We 
have demonstrated that both mutated proteins exhibit enhanced polyubiquitination 
(or polyubiquitylation) and proteasomal degradation. Importantly, we found that 
beta-transducin-repeat-containing protein 1 (beta-TrCP1), an F-box protein in 
the ubiquitin E3 ligase Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein (SCF) complex, directly 
interacts with and acts as a critical determinant for degradation of both 
mutated SMAD4 proteins. In addition, small interference RNA (siRNA)-triggered 
endogenous beta-TrCP1 suppression increased the protein expression level of both 
overexpressed SMAD4 mutants and endogenous mutated SMAD4 protein in acute 
myelogenous leukemia cells. These data suggest that mutated SMAD4 proteins 
undergo rapid degradation in acute myelogenous leukemia cells via 
SCF(beta-TrCP1) E3 ligase-mediated protein ubiquitination (or ubiquitylation) 
and subsequent proteasomal degradation.
