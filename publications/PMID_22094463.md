The YjgF/YER057c/UK114 family of proteins is conserved in all domains of life, 
suggesting that the role of these proteins arose early and was maintained 
throughout evolution. Metabolic consequences of lacking this protein in 
Salmonella enterica and other organisms have been described, but the biochemical 
function of YjgF remained unknown. This work provides the first description of a 
conserved biochemical activity for the YjgF protein family. Our data support the 
conclusion that YjgF proteins have enamine/imine deaminase activity and 
accelerate the release of ammonia from reactive enamine/imine intermediates of 
the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent threonine dehydratase (IlvA). Results from 
structure-guided mutagenesis experiments suggest that YjgF lacks a catalytic 
residue and that it facilitates ammonia release by positioning a critical water 
molecule in the active site. YjgF is renamed RidA (reactive intermediate/imine 
deaminase A) to reflect the conserved activity of the protein family described 
here. This study, combined with previous physiological studies on yjgF mutants, 
suggests that intermediates of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-mediated reactions may 
have metabolic consequences in vivo that were previously unappreciated. The 
conservation of the RidA/YjgF family suggests that reactive enamine/imine 
metabolites are of concern to all organisms.
