EphA2, a member of the Eph receptor family, is frequently overexpressed in a 
variety of human cancers, including breast cancers, and promotes cancer cell 
motility and invasion independently of its ligand ephrin stimulation. In this 
study, we identify Ephexin4 as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for 
RhoG that interacts with EphA2 in breast cancer cells, and knockdown and rescue 
experiments show that Ephexin4 acts downstream of EphA2 to promote 
ligand-independent breast cancer cell migration and invasion toward epidermal 
growth factor through activation of RhoG. The activation of RhoG recruits its 
effector ELMO2 and a Rac GEF Dock4 to form a complex with EphA2 at the tips of 
cortactin-rich protrusions in migrating breast cancer cells. In addition, the 
Dock4-mediated Rac activation is required for breast cancer cell migration. Our 
findings reveal a novel link between EphA2 and Rac activation that contributes 
to the cell motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells.
