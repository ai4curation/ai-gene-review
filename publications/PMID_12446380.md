AIMS: To localise Smads3/4 proteins in lens epithelial cells (LECs) of fresh and 
postoperative human specimens. Smads3/4 are involved in signal transduction 
between transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) cell surface receptors and 
gene promoters. Nuclear localisation of Smads indicates achievement of 
endogenous TGFbeta signalling in cells.
METHODS: Three circular sections of the anterior capsule, one lens, and 17 
capsules undergoing postoperative healing were studied. Immunohistochemistry was 
performed for Smads3/4 in paraffin sections of the specimens. The effect of 
exogenous TGFbeta2 on Smad3 subcellular localisation was examined in explant 
cultures of extracted human anterior lens epithelium.
RESULTS: The cytoplasm, but not the nuclei, of LECs of uninjured lenses was 
immunoreactive for Smads3/4. In contrast, nuclear immunoreactivity for Smads3/4 
was detected in LECs during capsular healing. Nuclei positive for Smads3/4 were 
observed in monolayered LECs adjacent to the regenerated lens fibres of 
Sommerring's ring. Interestingly, the nuclei of LECs that were somewhat 
elongated, and appeared to be differentiating into fibre-like cells, were 
negative for Smads3/4. Fibroblast-like, spindle-shaped lens cells with nuclear 
immunoreactivity for nuclear Smads3/4 were occasionally observed in the 
extracellular matrix accumulated in capsular opacification. Exogenous TGFbeta 
induced nuclear translocation of Smad3 in LECs of anterior capsule specimens in 
explant culture.
CONCLUSIONS: This is consistent with TGFbeta induced Smad signalling being 
involved in regulating the behaviour of LECs during wound healing after cataract 
surgery.
