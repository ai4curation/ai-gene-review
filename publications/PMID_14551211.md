The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ku heterodimer comprising Yku70p and Yku80p is 
involved in telomere maintenance and DNA repair by the pathway of non-homologous 
end joining. It is also a key regulator of transcriptional silencing of genes 
placed in close proximity to telomeres. Here, we describe the identification of 
separation-of-function mutants of Yku80p that exhibit defects in silencing but 
not DNA repair and show that these mutations map to an evolutionarily conserved 
domain within Yku80p. Furthermore, we reveal that Yku80p interacts with the 
silent information regulator protein Sir4p and that this interaction is mediated 
by the N-terminal 200 amino acid residues of Sir4p. Notably, this interaction 
also requires the region of Yku80p that contains the sites of the silencing 
defective mutations. Finally, we show that these mutations impair the 
Yku80p-Sir4p interaction and recruitment of Sir3p to telomeric regions in vivo. 
Taken together with other data, these findings indicate that the Yku80p-Sir4p 
interaction plays a vital role in the assembly of telomeric heterochromatin.
