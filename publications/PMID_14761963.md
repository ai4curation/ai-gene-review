Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a mitogen-activated protein 
kinase kinase kinase family member that plays a central role in cytokine- and 
stress-induced apoptosis by activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 signaling 
cascades. ASK1-induced apoptotic activity is up-regulated by two cellular 
factors, Daxx and TRAF2, through direct protein-protein interactions. Daxx and 
TRAF2 are death receptor-associated proteins in Fas and tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha pathways, respectively. Recent studies suggest that calcium 
signaling may regulate ASK1 pathway. Here we report that human D53L1, a member 
of the tumor protein D52 family involved in cell proliferation and calcium 
signaling, up-regulates the ASK1-induced apoptosis. The human D53L1 physically 
interacts with the C-terminal regulatory domain of ASK1 and promotes 
ASK1-induced apoptotic activity by activating caspase signaling in mammalian 
cells. In luciferase reporter assays, hD53L1 activates c-Jun N-terminal 
kinase-mediated transactivation in the presence of ASK1. Expression of hD53L1 
enhances autophosphorylation and kinase activity of ASK1 but has no effect on 
ASK1 oligomerization that is necessary for kinase activity and on binding of 
ASK1 to MKK6, a downstream factor of ASK1. Taken together, these results suggest 
that activation of ASK1 by hD53L1 may provide a novel mechanism for ASK1 
regulation.
