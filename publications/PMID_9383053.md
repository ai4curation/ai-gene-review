Regulated cell cycle progression depends on the proper integration of growth 
control pathways with the basic cell cycle machinery. While many of the central 
molecules such as cyclins, CDKs, and CKIs are known, and many of the kinases and 
phosphatases that modify the CDKs have been identified, little is known about 
the additional layers of regulation that impinge upon these molecules. To 
identify new regulators of cell proliferation, we have selected for human and 
yeast cDNAs that when overexpressed were capable of specifically overcoming G1 
arrest signals from the cell cycle branch of the mating pheromone pathway, while 
still maintaining the integrity of the transcriptional induction branch. We have 
identified 13 human CPR (cell cycle progression restoration) genes and 11 yeast 
OPY (overproduction-induced pheromone-resistant yeast) genes that specifically 
block the G1 arrest by mating pheromone. The CPR genes represent a variety of 
biochemical functions including a new cyclin, a tumor suppressor binding 
protein, chaperones, transcription factors, translation factors, RNA-binding 
proteins, as well as novel proteins. Several CPR genes require individual CLNs 
to promote pheromone resistance and those that require CLN3 increase the basal 
levels of Cln3 protein. Moreover, several of the yeast OPY genes have 
overlapping functions with the human CPR genes, indicating a possible 
conservation of roles.
