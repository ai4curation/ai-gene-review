Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3) are key intracellular signal transducers for TGF-beta 
signaling, and their transcriptional activities are controlled through 
reversible phosphorylation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. However, the precise 
mechanism underlying nuclear export of Smad2/3 remains elusive. Here we report 
the essential function of RanBP3 in selective nuclear export of Smad2/3 in the 
TGF-beta pathway. RanBP3 directly recognizes dephosphorylated Smad2/3, which 
results from the activity of nuclear Smad phosphatases, and mediates nuclear 
export of Smad2/3 in a Ran-dependent manner. As a result, increased expression 
of RanBP3 inhibits TGF-beta signaling in mammalian cells and Xenopus embryos. 
Conversely, depletion of RanBP3 expression or dominant-negative inhibition of 
RanBP3 enhances TGFbeta-induced antiproliferative and transcriptional responses. 
In conclusion, our study supports a definitive role for RanBP3 in mediating 
Smad2/3 nuclear export and terminating TGF-beta signaling.
