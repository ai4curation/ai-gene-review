We have identified a serine/threonine kinase that is rapidly activated during 
Fas-mediated apoptosis. Fas-activated serine/threonine kinase (FAST) is 
phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in Jurkat cells. In response to 
Fas ligation, it is rapidly dephosphorylated and concomitantly activated to 
phosphorylate TIA-1, a nuclear RNA-binding protein that has been implicated as 
an effector of apoptosis. Phosphorylation of TIA-1 precedes the onset of DNA 
fragmentation, suggesting a role in signaling downstream events in the apoptotic 
program. Our results introduce Fast and TIA-1 as components of a molecular 
cascade involved in signaling Fas-mediated apoptosis.
