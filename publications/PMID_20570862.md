Ldb1 and erythroid partners SCL, GATA-1, and LMO2 form a complex that is 
required to establish spatial proximity between the β-globin locus control 
region and gene and for transcription activation during erythroid 
differentiation. Here we show that Ldb1 controls gene expression at multiple 
levels. Ldb1 stabilizes its erythroid complex partners on β-globin chromatin, 
even though it is not one of the DNA-binding components. In addition, Ldb1 is 
necessary for enrichment of key transcriptional components in the locus, 
including P-TEFb, which phosphorylates Ser2 of the RNA polymerase C-terminal 
domain for efficient elongation. Furthermore, reduction of Ldb1 results in the 
inability of the locus to migrate away from the nuclear periphery, which is 
necessary to achieve robust transcription of β-globin in nuclear transcription 
factories. Ldb1 contributes these critical functions at both embryonic and adult 
stages of globin gene expression. These results implicate Ldb1 as a factor that 
facilitates nuclear relocation for transcription activation.
