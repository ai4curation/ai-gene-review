The heat shock protein (Hsp) 70/Hsp40 chaperone system plays an essential role 
in cell physiology, but few of its in vivo functions are known. We report that 
biogenesis of Axl1p, an insulinase-like endoprotease from yeast, is dependent 
upon the cytosolic Hsp40 protein Ydj1p. Axl1 is responsible for cleavage of the 
P2 processing intermediate of pro-a-factor, a mating pheromone, to its mature 
form. Mutant ydj1 strains exhibited a severe mating defect, which correlated 
with a 90% reduction in a-factor secretion. Reduced levels of a-factor export 
were caused by defects in the endoproteolytic processing of P2, which led to its 
intracellular accumulation. Defective P2 processing correlated with the 
reduction in the steady state level of active Axl1p. Two mechanisms were 
uncovered to explain why Axl1p activity was diminished in ydj1 strains. First, 
AXL1 mRNA levels were reduced ydj1 strains. Second, the half-life of newly 
synthesized Axl1p was greatly diminished in ydj1 strains. Collectively, these 
data indicate Ydj1p functions to promote AXL1 mRNA accumulation and in addition 
appears to facilitate the proper folding of nascent Axl1p. This study is the 
first to suggest a role for Ydj1p in RNA metabolism and identifies Axl1p as an 
in vivo substrate of the Hsp70/Ydj1p chaperone system.
