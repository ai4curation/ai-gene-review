The PAX6 gene is involved in ocular morphogenesis, and PAX6 mutations have been 
detected in various types of ocular anomalies, including aniridia, Peters 
anomaly, corneal dystrophy, congenital cataract, and foveal hypoplasia. The gene 
encodes a transcriptional regulator that recognizes target genes through its 
paired-type DNA-binding domain. The paired domain is composed of two distinct 
DNA-binding subdomains, the N-terminal subdomain (NTS) and the C-terminal 
subdomain (CTS), which bind respective consensus DNA sequences. The human PAX6 
gene produces two alternative splice isoforms that have the distinct structure 
of the paired domain. The insertion, into the NTS, of 14 additional amino acids 
encoded by exon 5a abolishes the DNA-binding activity of the NTS and unmasks the 
DNA-binding ability of the CTS. Thus, exon 5a appears to function as a molecular 
switch that specifies target genes. We ascertained a novel missense mutation in 
four pedigrees with Peters anomaly, congenital cataract, Axenfeldt anomaly, 
and/or foveal hypoplasia, which, to our knowledge, is the first mutation 
identified in the splice-variant region. A T-->A transition at the 20th 
nucleotide position of exon 5a results in a Val-->Asp (GTC-->GAC) substitution 
at the 7th codon of the alternative splice region. Functional analyses 
demonstrated that the V54D mutation slightly increased NTS binding and decreased 
CTS transactivation activity to almost half.
