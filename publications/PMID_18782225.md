Glycerophospholipids in biological membranes are metabolically active and 
participate in a series of deacylation-reacylation reactions, which may lead to 
accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) at the sn-2 position of the 
glycerol backbone. The reacylation reaction is believed to be catalyzed by 
acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA):lysophospholipid acyltransferase. Very recently, we 
have shown that Caenorhabditis elegans mboa-7, which belongs to the 
membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family, encodes 
lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI)-specific acyltransferase (LPIAT). In this study, 
we found that knockdown of another member of the MBOAT family in C. elegans, 
named mboa-6, reduced incorporation of exogenous PUFAs into phosphatidylcholine 
(PC), phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in C. elegans. 
Knockdown of a human mboa-6 homologue, referred to as MBOAT5, also impaired the 
incorporation of PUFAs into PC, PS and PE in HeLa cells. In in vitro assays, 
lysoPC (LPC), lysoPS (LPS) and lysoPE (LPE) acyltransferase activities using 
[(14)C]arachidonoyl-CoA were significantly reduced in the microsomes of MBOAT5 
knockdown cells. Conversely, over-expression of MBOAT5 in human embryonic kidney 
(HEK) 293 cells resulted in great increases in LPC, LPS and LPE acyltransferase 
activities but not in LPIAT or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) acyltransferase 
(LPAAT) activities. These results indicate that human MBOAT5 is a 
lysophospholipid acyltransferase acting preferentially on LPC, LPS and LPE.
