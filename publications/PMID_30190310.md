Aberrant complex formation by recurrent interaction modules, such as BTB 
domains, leucine zippers, or coiled coils, can disrupt signal transduction, yet 
whether cells detect and eliminate complexes of irregular composition is 
unknown. By searching for regulators of the BTB family, we discovered a quality 
control pathway that ensures functional dimerization [dimerization quality 
control (DQC)]. Key to this network is the E3 ligase SCFFBXL17, which 
selectively binds and ubiquitylates BTB dimers of aberrant composition to 
trigger their clearance by proteasomal degradation. Underscoring the 
physiological importance of DQC, SCFFBXL17 is required for the differentiation, 
function, and survival of neural crest and neuronal cells. We conclude that 
metazoan organisms actively monitor BTB dimerization, and we predict that 
distinct E3 ligases similarly control complex formation by other recurrent 
domains.
