Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a proline-directed serine/threonine protein 
kinase that requires association with a regulatory protein, p35 or p39, to form 
an active enzyme. Munc18-1 plays an essential role in membrane fusion, and its 
function is regulated by phosphorylation. We report here that both p35 and p39 
were expressed in insulin-secreting beta-cells, where they exhibited individual 
subcellular distributions and associated with membranous organelles of different 
densities. Overexpression of Cdk5, p35, or p39 showed that Cdk5 and p39 
augmented Ca(2+)-induced insulin exocytosis. Suppression of p39 and Cdk5, but 
not of p35, by antisense oligonucleotides selectively inhibited insulin 
exocytosis. Transient transfection of primary beta-cells with Munc18-1 templates 
mutated in potential Cdk5 or PKC phosphorylation sites, in combination with Cdk5 
and the different Cdk5 activators, suggested that Cdk5/p39-promoted 
Ca(2+)-dependent insulin secretion from primary beta-cells by phosphorylating 
Munc18-1 at a biochemical step immediately prior to vesicle fusion.
