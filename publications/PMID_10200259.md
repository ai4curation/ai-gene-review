Recently a number of nonclass I genes were discovered in the human MHC class I 
region. One of these, FAT10, encodes a protein consisting of two domains with 
homology to ubiquitin. FAT10 mRNA is expressed constitutively in some 
lymphoblastoid lines and dendritic cells and in certain other cells after 
gamma-interferon induction. FAT10 protein expression is controlled at several 
levels including transcription, translation, and protein stability. Yeast 
two-hybrid screening of a human lymphocyte library and immunoprecipitation 
studies revealed that FAT10 noncovalently associated with MAD2, a protein 
implicated in a cell-cycle checkpoint for spindle assembly during anaphase. 
Thus, FAT10 may modulate cell growth during B cell or dendritic cell development 
and activation.
