The OspF family of phosphothreonine lyase, including SpvC from Salmonella, 
irreversibly inactivates the dual-phosphorylated host MAPKs (pT-X-pY) through 
beta elimination. We determined crystal structures of SpvC and its complex with 
a phosphopeptide substrate. SpvC adopts a unique fold of alpha/beta type. The 
disordered N terminus harbors a canonical D motif for MAPK substrate docking. 
The enzyme-substrate complex structure indicates that recognition of the 
phosphotyrosine followed by insertion of the threonine phosphate into an 
arginine pocket places the phosphothreonine into the enzyme active site. This 
requires the conformational flexibility of pT-X-pY, which suggests that p38 
(pT-G-pY) is likely the preferred physiological substrate. Structure-based 
biochemical and enzymatic analysis allows us to propose a general acid/base 
mechanism for beta elimination reaction catalyzed by the phosphothreonine lyase. 
The mechanism described here provides a structural understanding of MAPK 
inactivation by a family of pathogenic effectors conserved in plant and animal 
systems and may also open a new route for biological catalysis.
