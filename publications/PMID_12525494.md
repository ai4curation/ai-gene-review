Two genes YER081W and YIL074C, renamed SER3 and SER33, respectively, which 
encode phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were 
identified. These dehydrogenases catalyze the first reaction of serine and 
glycine biosynthesis from the glycolytic metabolite 3-phosphoglycerate. Unlike 
either single mutant, the ser3Delta ser33Delta double mutant lacks detectable 
phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase activity and is auxotrophic for serine or glycine 
for growth on glucose media. However, the requirement for the SER-dependent 
"phosphoglycerate pathway" is conditional since the "glyoxylate" route of 
serine/glycine biosynthesis is glucose-repressed. Thus, in cells grown on 
ethanol both expression and activity of all SER-encoded proteins are low, 
including the remaining enzymes of the phosphoglycerate pathway, Ser1p and 
Ser2p. Moreover the available nitrogen source regulates the expression of SER 
genes. However, for only SER33, and not SER3, expression was regulated in 
relation to the available nitrogen source in a coordinated fashion with SER1 and 
SER2. Based on these mRNA data together with data on enzyme activities, Ser33p 
is likely to be the main isoenzyme of the phosphoglycerate pathway during growth 
on glucose. Moreover, since phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase activity requires 
NAD(+) as cofactor, deletion of SER3 and SER33 markedly affected redox 
metabolism as shown by substrate and product analysis.
