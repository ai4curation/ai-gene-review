PDZK1, a multi-PDZ domain containing adaptor protein, interacts with various 
membrane proteins, including the high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor 
scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). Here we show that PDZK1 controls in a 
tissue-specific and post-transcriptional fashion the expression of SR-BI in 
vivo. SR-BI protein expression in PDZK1 knock-out (KO) mice was reduced by 95% 
in the liver, 50% in the proximal intestine, and not affected in steroidogenic 
organs (adrenal, ovary, and testis). Thus, PDZK1 joins a growing list of 
adaptors that control tissue-specific activity of cell surface receptors. 
Hepatic expression of SR-BII, a minor splice variant with an alternative 
C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, was not affected in PDZK1 KO mice, suggesting 
that binding of PDZK1 to SR-BI is required for controlling hepatic SR-BI 
expression. The loss of hepatic SR-BI was the likely cause of the elevation in 
plasma total and HDL cholesterol and the increase in HDL particle size in PDZK1 
KO mice, phenotypes similar to those observed in SR-BI KO mice. PDZK1 KO mice 
differed from SR-BI KO mice in that the ratio of unesterified to total plasma 
cholesterol was normal, females were fertile, and cholesteryl ester stores in 
steroidogenic organs were essentially unaffected. These differences may be due 
to nearly normal extrahepatic expression of SR-BI in PDZK1 KO mice. The 
PDZK1-dependent regulation of hepatic SR-BI and, thus, lipoprotein metabolism 
supports the proposal that this adaptor may represent a new target for 
therapeutic intervention in cardiovascular disease.
