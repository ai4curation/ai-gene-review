The MAML (mastermind-like) proteins are a family of three co-transcriptional 
regulators that are essential for Notch signaling, a pathway critical for cell 
fate determination. Though the functions of MAML proteins in normal development 
remain unresolved, their distinct tissue distributions and differential 
activities in cooperating with various Notch receptors suggest that they have 
unique roles. Here we show that mice with a targeted disruption of the Maml1 
gene have severe muscular dystrophy. In vitro, Maml1-null embryonic fibroblasts 
failed to undergo MyoD-induced myogenic differentiation, further suggesting that 
Maml1 is required for muscle development. Interestingly, overexpression of MAML1 
in C2C12 cells dramatically enhanced myotube formation and increased the 
expression of muscle-specific genes, while RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated 
MAML1 knockdown abrogated differentiation. Moreover, we determined that MAML1 
interacts with MEF2C (myocyte enhancer factor 2C), functioning as its potent 
co-transcriptional regulator. Surprisingly, however, MAML1's promyogenic effects 
were completely blocked upon activation of Notch signaling, which was associated 
with recruitment of MAML1 away from MEF2C to the Notch transcriptional complex. 
Our study thus reveals novel and nonredundant functions for MAML1: It acts as a 
coactivator for MEF2C transcription and is essential for proper muscle 
development. Mechanistically, MAML1 appears to mediate cross-talk between Notch 
and MEF2 to influence myogenic differentiation.
