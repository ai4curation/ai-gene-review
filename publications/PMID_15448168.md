DNA topoisomerase I (topo I) is involved in the regulation of DNA supercoiling, 
gene transcription, recombination, and DNA repair. The anticancer agent 
camptothecin specifically targets topo I. The mechanisms responsible for the 
regulation of topo I in cells, however, are not known. This study demonstrates 
that c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation up-regulates topo I activity. The c-Abl SH3 
domain bound directly to the N-terminal region of topo I. The results 
demonstrate that c-Abl phosphorylated topo I at Tyr268 in core subdomain II. 
c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of topo I Tyr268 in vitro and in cells conferred 
activation of the topo I isomerase function. Moreover, activation of c-Abl by 
treatment of cells with ionizing radiation was associated with c-Abl-dependent 
phosphorylation of topo I and induction of topo I activity. The functional 
significance of the c-Abl/topo I interaction is supported by the findings that 
(i) mutant topo I(Y268F) exhibited loss of c-Abl-induced topo I activity, and 
(ii) c-Abl-/- cells were deficient in the accumulation of protein-linked DNA 
breaks. In addition, loss of topo I phosphorylation in c-Abl-deficient cells 
conferred resistance to camptothecin-induced apoptosis. These findings 
collectively support a model in which c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of topo I 
is functionally important to topo I activity and sensitivity to topo I poisons.
