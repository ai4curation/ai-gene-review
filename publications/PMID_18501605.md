BACKGROUND: Epigenetic regulation by diverse classes of small RNAs is mediated 
by the highly conserved Argonaute/Piwi family of proteins. Although Argonautes 
are broadly expressed, the Piwi subfamily primarily functions in the germ line. 
Piwi proteins are associated with germline-specific ribonucleoprotein (RNP) 
granules in Drosophila, zebrafish, and mouse. Depending on the species and on 
the specific family member, Piwis play important roles in spermatogenesis and/or 
in maintaining germ cell and stem cell totipotency. Piwis bind to a newly 
discovered class of small RNAs, called piRNAs. C. elegans contains a large set 
of Argonaute/Piwi-related proteins, including two closely related to piwi called 
prg-1 and prg-2. The function of prg-1 and prg-2 and whether piRNAs exist in C. 
elegans is unknown.
RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that the Piwi-like protein PRG-1 is localized to P 
granules in germ cells entering spermatogenesis and is required for successful 
spermatogenesis. Loss of prg-1 causes a marked reduction in expression of a 
subset of mRNAs expressed during spermatogenesis, and prg-1 mutant sperm exhibit 
extensive defects in activation and fertilization. Moreover, prg-1 activity is 
required for the presence of the small RNAs called 21U-RNAs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that PRG-1 promotes expression, processing, or 
stability of 21U-RNAs, which, in turn or in concert with PRG-1, promote proper 
expression of spermatogenesis transcripts.
