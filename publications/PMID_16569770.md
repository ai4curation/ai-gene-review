Gimap4, a member of the newly identified GTPase of the immunity-associated 
protein family (Gimap), is strongly induced by the pre-T-cell receptor in 
precursor T lymphocytes, transiently shut off in double-positive thymocytes, and 
reappears after TCR-mediated positive selection. Here, we show that Gimap4 
remains expressed constitutively in the cytosol of mature T cells. A C-terminal 
IQ domain binds calmodulin in the absence of calcium, and conserved PKC 
phosphorylation motifs are targets of concanavalin A (ConA)- or 
PMA/ionomycin-induced PKC activation. To address the role of Gimap4 in T-cell 
physiology, we completed the genomic organization of the gimap4 locus and 
generated a Gimap4-null mutant mouse. Studies in these mice revealed no critical 
role of Gimap4 in T-cell development but in the regulation of apoptosis. We have 
found that Gimap4 accelerates the execution of programmed cell death induced by 
intrinsic stimuli downstream of caspase-3 activation and phosphatidylserine 
exposure. Apoptosis directly correlates with the phosphorylation status of 
Gimap4.
