Collecting duct (CD)-derived endothelin-1 (ET-1) inhibits renal Na reabsorption 
and its deficiency increases blood pressure (BP). The role of CD endothelin B 
(ETB) receptors in mediating these effects is unknown. CD-specific knockout of 
the ETB receptor was achieved using an aquaporin-2 promoter-Cre recombinase 
transgene and the loxP-flanked ETB receptor gene (CD ETB KO). Systolic BP in 
mice with CD-specific knockout of the ETB receptor, ETA receptor (CD ETA KO) and 
ET-1 (CD ET-1 KO), and their respective controls were compared during normal- 
and high-salt diet. On a normal-sodium diet, CD ETB KO mice had elevated BP, 
which increased further during high salt feeding. However, the degree of 
hypertension in CD ETB KO mice and the further increase in BP during salt 
feeding were lower than that of CD ET-1 KO mice, whereas CD ETA KO mice were 
normotensive. CD ETB KO mice had impaired sodium excretion following acute 
sodium loading. Aldosterone and plasma renin activity were decreased in CD ETB 
KO mice on normal- and high-sodium diets, while plasma and urinary ET-1 levels 
did not differ from controls. In conclusion, the CD ETB receptor partially 
mediates the antihypertensive and natriuretic effects of ET-1. CD ETA and ETB 
receptors do not fully account for the antihypertensive and natriuretic effects 
of CD-derived ET-1, suggesting paracrine effects of this peptide.
