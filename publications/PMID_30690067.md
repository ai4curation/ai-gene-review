The mosquito immune and circulatory systems are functionally integrated. During 
an infection, hemocytes aggregate around the ostia (valves) of the dorsal vessel 
- areas of the heart called the periostial regions - where they phagocytose live 
and melanized pathogens. Although periostial hemocyte aggregation is an immune 
response that occurs following infection with bacteria and malaria parasites, 
the molecular basis of this process remains poorly understood. Here, we show 
that the thioester-containing proteins, TEP1, TEP3 and TEP4 are positive 
regulators of periostial hemocyte aggregation in the African malaria mosquito, 
Anopheles gambiae. RNAi-based knockdown of TEP1, TEP3 and TEP4 resulted in fewer 
periostial hemocytes following Escherichia coli infection, without affecting the 
adjacent population of non-periostial, sessile hemocytes. Moreover, knockdown of 
TEP1, TEP3 and TEP4 expression resulted in reduced bacterial accumulation and 
melanin deposition at the periostial regions. Finally, this study confirmed the 
role that TEP1 plays in reducing infection intensity in the hemocoel. Overall, 
this research shows that the complement-like proteins, TEP1, TEP3 and TEP4, are 
positive regulators of the functional integration between the immune and 
circulatory systems of mosquitoes.
