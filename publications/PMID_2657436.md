Subtilisin E, an alkaline serine protease consisting of a single polypeptide 
chain of 275 amino acids is produced from a pre-pro-protein. The pre-sequence 
functions as the signal peptide for protein secretion across the membrane. 
Deletion of the pro-sequence yields mature but inactive subtilisin: the 77-amino 
acid pro-sequence must precede the mature subtilisin to guide the latter into an 
active conformation. Pro-subtilisin denatured in 6 M guanidine-HCl can be 
self-processed to the active enzyme intramolecularly, with concomitant cleavage 
of the pro-sequence, when dialysed against renaturing buffer. We have 
constructed an active-centre mutant of pro-subtilisin (Asp 32----Asn) which is 
not processed to active enzyme, unlike the wild-type pro-subtilisin, because 
intramolecular processing is prevented. Here we report an intermolecular pathway 
for the refolding of the inactive mature protein to an active enzyme in vitro 
with the aid of exogenously added pro-sequence. We establish conditions under 
which the mature inactive form, as well as acid-denatured subtilisins Carlsberg 
and BPN', can be renatured by the mutant pro-subtilisin.
