The most common form of blindness at birth, Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA), 
is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Mutations in six different 
retina-specific genes, including a recently discovered gene, AIPL1, have been 
linked to LCA in humans. To understand the molecular basis of LCA caused by aryl 
hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein-like 1 (AIPL1) mutations, and to 
elucidate the normal function of AIPL1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen 
using AIPL1 as bait. The screen demonstrated that AIPL1 interacts specifically 
with farnesylated proteins. Mutations in AIPL1 linked to LCA compromise this 
activity. These findings suggest that the essential function of AIPL1 within 
photoreceptors requires interactions with farnesylated proteins. Analysis of 
isoprenylation in cultured human cells shows that AIPL1 enhances the processing 
of farnesylated proteins. Based on these findings, we propose that AIPL1 
interacts with farnesylated proteins and plays an essential role in processing 
of farnesylated proteins in retina.
