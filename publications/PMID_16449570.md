To understand the organization of the transcriptional networks that govern cell 
differentiation, we have investigated the transcriptional circuitry controlling 
pseudohyphal development in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The binding targets of 
Ste12, Tec1, Sok2, Phd1, Mga1, and Flo8 were globally mapped across the yeast 
genome. The factors and their targets form a complex binding network, containing 
patterns characteristic of autoregulation, feedback and feed-forward loops, and 
cross-talk. Combinatorial binding to intergenic regions was commonly observed, 
which allowed for the identification of a novel binding association between Mga1 
and Flo8, in which Mga1 requires Flo8 for binding to promoter regions. Further 
analysis of the network showed that the promoters of MGA1 and PHD1 were bound by 
all of the factors used in this study, identifying them as key target hubs. 
Overexpression of either of these two proteins specifically induced pseudohyphal 
growth under noninducing conditions, highlighting them as master regulators of 
the system. Our results indicate that target hubs can serve as master regulators 
whose activity is sufficient for the induction of complex developmental 
responses and therefore represent important regulatory nodes in biological 
networks.
