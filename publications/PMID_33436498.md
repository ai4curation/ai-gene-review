The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 
on the host cell surface and subsequently enters host cells through 
receptor-mediated endocytosis. Additional cell receptors may be directly or 
indirectly involved, including integrins. The cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and 
integrins contain several predicted short linear motifs (SLiMs) that may 
facilitate internalization of the virus as well as its subsequent propagation 
through processes such as autophagy. Here, we measured the binding affinity of 
predicted interactions between SLiMs in the cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and 
integrin β3 with proteins that mediate endocytic trafficking and autophagy. We 
validated that a class I PDZ-binding motif mediated binding of ACE2 to the 
scaffolding proteins SNX27, NHERF3, and SHANK, and that a binding site for the 
clathrin adaptor AP2 μ2 in ACE2 overlaps with a phospho-dependent binding site 
for the SH2 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, we validated 
that an LC3-interacting region (LIR) in integrin β3 bound to the ATG8 domains of 
the autophagy receptors MAP1LC3 and GABARAP in a manner enhanced by LIR-adjacent 
phosphorylation. Our results provide molecular links between cell receptors and 
mediators of endocytosis and autophagy that may facilitate viral entry and 
propagation.
