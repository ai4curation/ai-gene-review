By mimicking sympathetic stimulation in vivo, we previously reported that mice 
globally lacking serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptors did not develop 
isoproterenol-induced left ventricular hypertrophy. However, the exact cardiac 
cell type(s) expressing 5-HT(2B) receptors (cardiomyocytes versus 
noncardiomyocytes) involved in pathological heart hypertrophy was never 
addressed in vivo. We report here that mice expressing the 5-HT(2B) receptor 
solely in cardiomyocytes, like global 5-HT(2B) receptor-null mice, are resistant 
to isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction, as well as to 
isoproterenol-induced increases in cytokine plasma-levels. These data reveal a 
key role of noncardiomyocytes in isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy in vivo. 
Interestingly, we show that primary cultures of angiotensinogen null adult 
cardiac fibroblasts are releasing cytokines on stimulation with either 
angiotensin II or serotonin, but not in response to isoproterenol stimulation, 
demonstrating a critical role of angiotensinogen in adrenergic-dependent 
cytokine production. We then show a functional interdependence between AT(1)Rs 
and 5-HT(2B) receptors in fibroblasts by revealing a transinhibition mechanism 
that may involve heterodimeric receptor complexes. Both serotonin- and 
angiotensin II-dependent cytokine production occur via a Src/heparin-binding 
epidermal growth factor-dependent transactivation of epidermal growth factor 
receptors in cardiac fibroblasts, supporting a common signaling pathway. 
Finally, we demonstrate that 5-HT(2B) receptors are overexpressed in hearts from 
patients with congestive heart failure, this overexpression being positively 
correlated with cytokine and norepinephrine plasma levels. Collectively, these 
results reveal for the first time that interactions between AT(1) and 5-HT(2B) 
receptors coexpressed by noncardiomyocytes are limiting key events in adrenergic 
agonist-induced, angiotensin-dependent cardiac hypertrophy. Accordingly, 
antagonists of 5-HT(2B) receptors might represent novel therapeutics for 
sympathetic overstimulation-dependent heart failure.
