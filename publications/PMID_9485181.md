The TCR/CD3 complex is composed of six subunits which are expressed on the cell 
surface in a coordinate fashion after assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER). The TCR/CD3 complex is assembled after a series of pairwise interactions 
involving the formation of dimers of CD3 epsilon with either CD3 gamma or CD3 
delta. These dimers assemble with TCR alpha and TCR beta chains, and finally, 
the CD3 zeta homodimer is added to allow export of the full complex from the ER. 
A model has been proposed suggesting that during assembly the CD3 epsilon/CD3 
gamma dimer interacts exclusively with TCR beta and the CD3 epsilon/CD3 delta 
dimer with TCR alpha to form a complex with a single TCR alpha/beta heterodimer. 
We show in this study, by immunoprecipitation and two-dimensional gel 
electrophoresis, that in the human T cell line Jurkat as well as in total human 
thymocytes, this preferential interaction does not occur and instead, the CD3 
epsilon/CD3 gamma and CD3 epsilon/CD3 delta dimers associate with both TCR 
chains simultaneously and indistinctly. These data are confirmed by the analysis 
of the TCR alpha-negative T cell line MOLT-4 in which TCR beta is found 
separately associated with CD3 epsilon/CD3 gamma and with CD3 epsilon/CD3 delta 
dimers. Indirectly, our results support a model of stoichiometry in which two 
TCR alpha/beta heterodimers are present in a TCR/CD3 complex. Furthermore, 
immunoprecipitation with anti-CD3 gamma and anti-CD3 delta antibodies from 1% 
NP40 and 1% Brij96 cell lysates showed that these subunits form independent 
partial complexes which are cross-linked through the CD3 zeta homodimer. This 
suggests that CD3 zeta mediates the interaction between both TCR alpha/beta 
heterodimers contained in the double TCR complex. Further proof for this 
hypothesis is obtained after analysis of a Jurkat cell transfectant containing a 
point mutation in the transmembrane domain of TCR beta that impairs the 
association of CD3 zeta. In this mutant cell line, unlike a control line with 
wild-type TCR beta, the CD3 gamma- and CD3 delta-containing complexes were found 
completely independent. Altogether, these results support a model of TCR/CD3 
assembly and stoichiometry in which two TCR-alpha/beta heterodimers form two 
hemicomplexes containing either CD3 epsilon/gamma or CD3 epsilon/delta dimers 
which become associated via the CD3 zeta homodimer.
