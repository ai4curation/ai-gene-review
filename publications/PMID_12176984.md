Tuberous sclerosis is caused by mutations to either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor 
suppressor gene. The disease is characterized by a broad phenotypic spectrum 
that includes seizures, mental retardation, renal dysfunction, and 
dermatological abnormalities. TSC1 encodes a 130-kDa protein called hamartin, 
and TSC2 encodes a 200-kDa protein called tuberin. Although it has been shown 
that hamartin and tuberin form a complex and mediate phosphoinositide 
3-kinase/Akt-dependent phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6, it is not 
yet clear how inactivation of either protein leads to tuberous sclerosis. 
Therefore, to obtain additional insight into tuberin and hamartin function, 
yeast two-hybrid screening experiments were performed to identify proteins that 
interact with tuberin. One of the proteins identified was 14-3-3zeta, a member 
of the 14-3-3 protein family. The interaction between tuberin and 14-3-3zeta was 
confirmed in vitro and by co-immunoprecipitation; multiple sites within tuberin 
for 14-3-3zeta binding were identified; and it was determined that 14-3-3zeta 
associated with the tuberin-hamartin complex. Finally, it was shown that the 
tuberin/14-3-3zeta interaction is regulated by Akt-mediated phosphorylation of 
tuberin, providing insight into how tuberin may regulate phosphorylation of S6.
