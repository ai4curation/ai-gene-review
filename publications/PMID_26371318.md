The timing of cortical neurogenesis has a major effect on the size and 
organization of the mature cortex. The deletion of the LIM-homeodomain 
transcription factor Lhx2 in cortical progenitors by Nestin-cre leads to a 
dramatically smaller cortex. Here we report that Lhx2 regulates the cortex size 
by maintaining the cortical progenitor proliferation and delaying the initiation 
of neurogenesis. The loss of Lhx2 in cortical progenitors results in precocious 
radial glia differentiation and a temporal shift of cortical neurogenesis. We 
further investigated the underlying mechanisms at play and demonstrated that in 
the absence of Lhx2, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway failed to maintain progenitor 
proliferation. We developed and applied a mathematical model that reveals how 
precocious neurogenesis affected cortical surface and thickness. Thus, we 
concluded that Lhx2 is required for β-catenin function in maintaining cortical 
progenitor proliferation and controls the timing of cortical neurogenesis.

Abstract

The timing of cortical neurogenesis has a major effect on the size and organization of the mature cortex. The deletion of the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor Lhx2 in cortical progenitors by Nestin -cre leads to a dramatically smaller cortex. Here we report that Lhx2 regulates the cortex size by maintaining the cortical progenitor proliferation and delaying the initiation of neurogenesis. The loss of Lhx2 in cortical progenitors results in precocious radial glia differentiation and a temporal shift of cortical neurogenesis. We further investigated the underlying mechanisms at play and demonstrated that in the absence of Lhx2, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway failed to maintain progenitor proliferation. We developed and applied a mathematical model that reveals how precocious neurogenesis affected cortical surface and thickness. Thus, we concluded that Lhx2 is required for β-catenin function in maintaining cortical progenitor proliferation and controls the timing of cortical neurogenesis.

Discussion

In this study, we uncovered biological mechanisms regulating the timing of neurogenesis. We found that Lhx2 deletion by Nestin -cre leads to a shift of the sequential process of neurogenesis to an earlier time. We thus concluded that Lhx2 maintains cortical progenitors in proliferative state and delays the initiation of neurogenic differentiation at early developmental stages. This finding is consistent with the fact that Lhx2 expression in cortical progenitors decays during cortical development and that Lhx2 is expressed in a pattern opposite to that of neurogenesis: it forms a high/medial to low/lateral and high/caudal to low/rostral gradient, whereas neurogenesis initiates from the rostrolateral cortex, where Lhx2 is expressed at the lowest level ( 38 ).

Further, we identified that Lhx2 is involved in the Wnt/β-Cat signaling pathway. This pathway is known to play important roles in regulating cortical neurogenesis; however, it was shown to induce both progenitor proliferation and differentiation, two contradicting events ( 28 ). It has been difficult to analyze β-Cat function in knockout animals because mutants also show defects in cell adhesion and tissue integrity. Ectopic expression of Dkk1, a negative regulator of Wnt signaling pathway, in the developing cortex was used to reduce Wnt signaling activity while maintaining β-Cat function in cortical progenitors. It confirmed that Wnt signaling plays a positive role in the expansion of progenitors ( 39 ). Recently, the role of β-Cat in cortical development was studied elegantly by constructing a mutant form of β-Cat with normal cell–cell adhesion activity, but defective transcriptional activity ( 40 ). Interestingly, mice harboring this mutant form of β-Cat exhibited a phenotype similar to what we observe in Lhx2 cKO, including a temporal shift of neurogenesis and fewer neurons in both deep and upper cortical layers ( 40 ).

As the deletion of Lhx2 resembles the loss of Wnt/β-Cat signaling activity, we expected to find decreased β-Cat transcriptional activity in Lhx2 cKO. However, with BAT-Gal reporter, we found an increase in β-Cat transcriptional activity in Lhx2 cKO dTel ( Fig. 3 ). Interestingly, we observed a discrepancy between the expression of the BAT-Gal reporter, a faithful reporter for Wnt/β-Cat signaling pathway in many systems ( 9 , 29 , 39 , 41 , 42 ), and the known Wnt/β-Cat downstream genes, such as Axin2 and CyclinD1 ( SI Appendix , Fig. S7 ). Only Ngn1 , a neurogenic Wnt/β-Cat downstream gene ( 28 ), is up-regulated in the Lhx2 cKO ( Fig. 3 ). We further confirmed that the loss of Lhx2 impairs cortical progenitor self-renewal promoted by Wnt/β-Cat signaling by showing that the expression of stabilized β-Cat maintains transfected cells in the ventricular zone in WT, but not in Lhx2 cKO ( Fig. 3 ). Thus, we proposed that Lhx2 is involved in directing the activity of the Wnt/β-Cat signaling pathway to promote progenitor proliferation, probably in a similar way as Axin, a component in the Wnt/β-Cat signaling pathway, directing the proliferation or differentiation choice in the intermediate progenitors ( 43 ).

During cortical development, patterning centers express signaling molecules such as Fgfs and Wnts to establish expression patterns of transcription factors and regulate cortical neurogenesis and patterning. Several patterning transcription factors, including Emx2 (empty spiracles homeobox 2), COUP-TF1 (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 1 or NR2F1), Pax6 (paired box 6), and Sp8 (trans-acting transcription factor 8), were shown to collaboratively regulate the proliferation and differentiation of cortical progenitors and cortical arealization ( 44 ). In cortical progenitors, these transcription factors establish a regulatory network, such as the reciprocal regulation between COUP-TF1 and Sp8 ( 45 ), to coordinate multiple signaling pathways. For example, COUP-TF1 regulates progenitor proliferation and differentiation ( 46 ) and also plays an important role in regulating cortical areal patterning ( 47 ). Similar to these patterning transcription factors, Lhx2 controls multiple aspects of cortical development. It is likely these different functions of Lhx2 are coordinated in cortical progenitors by interacting with other transcription factors during cortical neurogenesis. Further studies of genetic machinery regulated by Lhx2 and the interactions between Lhx2 and other transcription factors are needed to understand the mechanisms of the temporal regulation of neurogenesis.

Cortical size expansion and the increase in cortical neuronal number suggest that regulation of neurogenesis has changed over evolution ( 48 , 49 ). The mathematical model of cortical neurogenesis we developed provided insights on how the timing of different phases in neurogenesis affect the size and composition of the cortex. Our findings suggested that the intricate interplay between Lhx2 and Wnt/β-Cat signaling pathway, by modifying the timing of neurogenesis, appears to be a key regulatory mechanism in cortical evolution and may function in cortical developmental disorders, such as microcephaly.
