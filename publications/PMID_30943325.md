During the transition to the reproductive phase, the shoot apical meristem 
switches from the developmental program that generates vegetative organs to 
instead produce flowers. In this study, we examined the genetic interactions of 
FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)/TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) and TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1) in 
the determination of inflorescence meristem identity in Arabidopsis thaliana. 
The ft-10 tsf-1 mutants produced a compact inflorescence surrounded by serrated 
leaves (hyper-vegetative shoot) at the early bolting stage, as did plants 
overexpressing TFL1. Plants overexpressing FT or TSF (or both FT and TFL1) 
generated a terminal flower, as did tfl1-20 mutants. The terminal flower formed 
in tfl1-20 mutants converted to a hyper-vegetative shoot in ft-10 tsf-1 mutants. 
Grafting ft-10 tsf-1 or ft-10 tsf-1 tfl1-20 mutant scions to 35S::FT rootstock 
plants produced a normal inflorescence and a terminal flower in the scion 
plants, respectively, although both scions showed similar early flowering. 
Misexpression of FT in the vasculature and in the shoot apex in wild-type plants 
generated a normal inflorescence and a terminal flower, respectively. By 
contrast, in ft-10 tsf-1 mutants the vasculature-specific misexpression of FT 
converted the hyper-vegetative shoot to a normal inflorescence, and in the 
ft-10 tsf-1 tfl1-20 mutants converted the shoot to a terminal flower. TFL1 
levels did not affect the inflorescence morphology caused by FT/TSF 
overexpression at the early bolting stage. Taking these results together, we 
proposed that FT/TSF and TFL1 play antagonistic roles in the determination of 
inflorescence meristem identity, and that FT/TSF are more important than TFL1 in 
this process.
