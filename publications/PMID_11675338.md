A family with recessive X-linked thrombocytopenia affecting 4 males in 2 
generations, characterized by macrothrombocytopenia, profound bleeding, and mild 
dyserythropoiesis, is described. Microsatellite linkage analysis identified a 
region of the X chromosome including the GATA-1 gene, which encodes a critical 
transcription factor involved in erythrocyte and megakaryocyte development. By 
sequencing the entire coding region of GATA-1, a 2-base mutation was detected 
that results in a single amino acid substitution (glycine 208 to serine) within 
a highly conserved portion of the N-terminal zinc finger domain. Restriction 
fragment length polymorphism confirmed that this novel mutation segregated with 
the affected males and female carrier. Although not required for DNA binding, 
Gly208 of GATA-1 is involved in direct interaction with Friend of GATA-1 (FOG), 
a cofactor required for normal megakaryocytic and erythroid development. These 
results demonstrate that the GATA-1-FOG interaction is partially disrupted by 
the mutation and that the greatest effect involves contact with the FOG zinc 
finger 9. These findings help describe a novel mutation of GATA-1 in humans as a 
cause of X-linked thrombocytopenia, and they confirm the vital role played by 
this transcription factor during in vivo megakaryocyte development.
