The Rb/E2F pathway is deregulated in virtually all human tumors. It is clear 
that, in addition to Rb itself, essential cofactors required for transcriptional 
repression and silencing of E2F target genes are mutated or lost in cancer. To 
identify novel cofactors required for Rb/E2F-mediated inhibition of cell 
proliferation, we performed a genome-wide short hairpin RNA screen. In addition 
to several known Rb cofactors, the screen identified components of the Mediator 
complex, a large multiprotein coactivator required for RNA polymerase II 
transcription. We show that the Mediator complex subunit MED13L is required for 
Rb/E2F control of cell growth, the complete repression of cell cycle target 
genes, and cell cycle inhibition.
