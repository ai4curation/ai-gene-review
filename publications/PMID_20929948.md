The avian and mammalian heart originates from two distinct embryonic regions: an 
early differentiating first heart field and a dorsomedially located second heart 
field. It remains largely unknown when and how these subdivisions of the heart 
field divide into regions with different fates. Here, we identify in the mouse a 
subpopulation of the first (crescent-forming) field marked by endothelin 
receptor type A (Ednra) gene expression, which contributes to chamber myocardium 
through a unique type of cell behavior. Ednra-lacZ/EGFP-expressing cells arise 
in the ventrocaudal inflow region of the early linear heart tube, converge to 
the midline, move anteriorly along the outer curvature and give rise to chamber 
myocardium mainly of the left ventricle and both atria. This movement was 
confirmed by fluorescent dye-labeling and transplantation experiments. The 
Ednra-lacZ/EGFP-expressing subpopulation is characterized by the presence of 
Tbx5-expressing cells. Ednra-null embryonic hearts often demonstrate hypoplasia 
of the ventricular wall, low mitotic activity and decreased Tbx5 expression with 
reciprocal expansion of Tbx2 expression. Conversely, endothelin 1 stimulates ERK 
phosphorylation and Tbx5 expression in the early embryonic heart. These results 
indicate that early Ednra expression defines a subdomain of the first heart 
field contributing to chamber formation, in which endothelin 1/Ednra signaling 
is involved. The present finding provides an insight into how subpopulations 
within the crescent-forming (first) heart field contribute to the coordination 
of heart morphogenesis through spatiotemporally defined cell movements.
