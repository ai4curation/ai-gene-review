In hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), intestinal absorption of dietary iron is 
increased, leading to excessive iron accumulation in tissues and resultant organ 
damage. The HFE protein, which is defective in HH, normally is expressed in 
crypt enterocytes of the duodenum where it has a unique, predominantly 
intracellular localization. In placenta, the HFE protein colocalizes with and 
forms a stable association with the transferrin receptor (TfR), providing a link 
between the HFE protein and iron transport. In the present study, we examined 
the relationship of the HFE protein to the TfR in enterocytes of the human 
duodenum and measured the uptake of transferrin-bound iron and ionic iron by 
isolated crypt and villus enterocytes. Immunocytochemistry showed that the HFE 
protein and TfR both are expressed in the crypt enterocytes. Western blots 
showed that, as was the case in human placenta, the HFE protein in crypt 
enterocytes is physically associated with the TfR and with beta2-microglobulin. 
The crypt cell fraction exhibited dramatically higher transferrin-bound iron 
uptake than villus cells. On the other hand, the villus cells showed 2-3 times 
higher uptake of ionic iron than crypt cells. We propose that the HFE protein 
modulates the uptake of transferrin-bound iron from plasma by crypt enterocytes 
and participates in the mechanism by which the crypt enterocytes sense the level 
of body iron stores. Impairment of this function caused by HFE gene mutations in 
HH could provide a paradoxical signal in crypt enterocytes that programs the 
differentiating enterocytes to absorb more dietary iron when they mature into 
villus enterocytes.

Abstract

In hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), intestinal absorption of
 dietary iron is increased, leading to excessive iron accumulation in
 tissues and resultant organ damage. The HFE protein, which is defective
 in HH, normally is expressed in crypt enterocytes of the duodenum where
 it has a unique, predominantly intracellular localization. In placenta,
 the HFE protein colocalizes with and forms a stable association with
 the transferrin receptor (TfR), providing a link between the HFE
 protein and iron transport. In the present study, we examined the
 relationship of the HFE protein to the TfR in enterocytes of the human
 duodenum and measured the uptake of transferrin-bound iron and ionic
 iron by isolated crypt and villus enterocytes. Immunocytochemistry
 showed that the HFE protein and TfR both are expressed in the crypt
 enterocytes. Western blots showed that, as was the case in human
 placenta, the HFE protein in crypt enterocytes is physically associated
 with the TfR and with β 2 -microglobulin. The crypt cell
 fraction exhibited dramatically higher transferrin-bound iron uptake
 than villus cells. On the other hand, the villus cells showed 2–3
 times higher uptake of ionic iron than crypt cells. We propose that the
 HFE protein modulates the uptake of transferrin-bound iron from plasma
 by crypt enterocytes and participates in the mechanism by which the
 crypt enterocytes sense the level of body iron stores. Impairment of
 this function caused by HFE gene mutations in HH could
 provide a paradoxical signal in crypt enterocytes that programs the
 differentiating enterocytes to absorb more dietary iron when they
 mature into villus enterocytes.

DISCUSSION

The absorption of dietary iron is a tightly regulated process,
 occurring mainly in the proximal small intestine. Under normal
 conditions, the amount of absorbed iron is closely linked to the body
 iron needs ( 27 – 29 ). Iron absorption is increased when body iron stores
 are low and tissue iron requirements are high. Conversely, iron
 absorption is depressed if body iron stores are increased. There is
 considerable evidence that this regulation is defective in HH ( 27 , 30 ),
 but the precise mechanism of the mucosal abnormality in this disorder
 is not known. Physiological studies by McLaren et al. ( 31 )
 suggested that the increased iron absorption in HH may be mediated
 primarily by an increase in the rate constant for transfer of mucosal
 iron to the plasma. Our previous studies showed that the HFE protein,
 which is defective in HH, is expressed in the epithelial cells of the
 gastrointestinal tract ( 17 ). The unique localization in the crypt
 enterocytes of the duodenum suggested that the HFE protein may
 participate in the regulation of intestinal iron absorption. The
 studies reported here demonstrate that the HFE protein colocalizes with
 and is physically associated with the TfR in the crypt enterocytes.

Our findings that crypt cells take up much more transferrin-bound iron
 than villus cells, whereas the villus cells show higher uptake of ionic
 iron, are in agreement with previous studies indicating differences in
 the transport of iron along the crypt-villus axis. For example, Conrad
 and Crosby ( 32 ) showed by autoradiography that the epithelial cells of
 the mid to upper villus are able to absorb iron from the diet, whereas
 crypt enterocytes take up iron from body iron stores that is delivered
 to them by the circulation. Oates et al. ( 33 ) showed that
 crypt cells not only showed greater uptake of transferrin-bound iron,
 but that this uptake was regulated by dietary iron consumption in that
 greater uptake of transferrin-bound iron was seen when dietary loading
 raised the serum transferrin saturation. Presumably, this uptake of
 transferrin-bound iron leads to a regulatory response that
 down-regulates further absorption of dietary iron.

A key question in understanding HH is how this transferrin-bound iron
 uptake by crypt cells regulates absorption of dietary iron by the
 villus cells. There is physiological evidence that the iron
 concentration within the crypt cells is the most important determinant
 of regulation of dietary iron absorption ( 27 , 32 ). When serum
 transferrin-bound iron levels are low, reflecting low body iron stores,
 the reduced transferrin-bound iron uptake by crypt cells programs the
 differentiating enterocytes to absorb more dietary iron in the villus
 ( 27 ). The 2- to 3-day time interval required for newly formed crypt
 cells to mature into absorptive enterocytes explains the delay between
 a physiological stimulus to alter iron absorption and the actual change
 in the iron absorption rate. Presumably, this transition to mature
 ionic iron-absorptive enterocytes involves regulation of the level of
 iron regulatory proteins, which stabilize the iron-responsive mRNA for
 DMT1, leading to increased synthesis of DMT1 in the differentiating
 enterocytes ( 34 , 35 ). Increased expression of DMT1 in the villus, the
 scenario reported in iron deprivation ( 34 ), would in turn lead to
 greater absorption of dietary iron at the apical surface.

What then is the role of the normal HFE protein in this process and how
 do the mutations in this protein in HH lead to elevated levels of
 dietary iron absorption, even in the face of iron overload? We propose
 that the normal HFE protein participates in the regulation and uptake
 of transferrin-bound iron in the crypt cells, and that the HH mutations
 disrupt this function, leading to decreased transferrin-bound iron
 uptake by the crypt cells. The lower than appropriate levels of iron in
 the crypt cells, relative to the total body iron stores, would lead to
 an inappropriate signal to absorb more dietary iron in the
 differentiating villus cells.

The normal HFE protein, which we show here associates with the TfR in
 crypt cells, could modulate the uptake of transferrin-bound iron by the
 crypt cells by one or more of several mechanisms ( 21 ). First, it might
 enhance the cycling rate of the TfR cycle, expediting the delivery of
 transferrin-bound iron into the cells. Second, it might facilitate the
 endosomal egress of iron released during the TfR cycle. Third, it might
 change the affinity of the TfR for its ligand, diferric transferrin,
 and thus indirectly influence the uptake of iron. Actually, the HFE
 protein has been reported to reduce the affinity of the TfR for its
 ligand ( 19 – 21 ). However, the nanomolar changes in affinity reported
 seem unlikely to influence the TfR occupancy significantly at
 physiological levels of transferrin (≈25 μM). An intracellular
 effect of HFE protein on TfR trafficking resulting in increased iron
 uptake by crypt cells seems more consistent with the predominantly
 intracellular localization of the HFE protein in crypt enterocytes of
 the duodenum ( 17 ). Whatever the mechanism by which the HFE protein
 regulates the uptake of transferrin-bound iron in crypt enterocytes, we
 propose that the effect of HH mutations is to impair uptake of
 transferrin-bound iron. Lower than appropriate intracellular iron
 levels, in turn, would signal the need for greater iron absorption at
 the luminal surface of the villus, even in the face of excess
 transferrin-bound iron in serum and iron storage in parenchymal cells,
 as are characteristic of HH.

The one clear prediction of this model is that the anticipated low
 levels of iron in crypt enterocytes in HH should signal up-regulation
 of enterocyte DMT1 mRNA through its iron response element ( 36 ). The
 availability of the mouse model of HH in which the murine HFE gene has been disrupted should allow a direct test of
 this prediction.
