During prometaphase, dense microtubule nucleation sites at centrosomes form 
robust spindles that align chromosomes promptly. Failure of centrosome 
maturation leaves chromosomes scattered, as seen routinely in cancer cells, 
including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We previously reported that the Miki 
(LOC253012) gene is frequently deleted in MDS patients, and that low levels of 
Miki are associated with abnormal mitosis. Here we demonstrate that Miki 
localizes to the Golgi apparatus and is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by tankyrase-1 
during late G2 and prophase. PARsylated Miki then translocates to mitotic 
centrosomes and anchors CG-NAP, a large scaffold protein of the γ-tubulin ring 
complex. Due to impairment of microtubule aster formation, cells in which 
tankyrase-1, Miki, or CG-NAP expression is downregulated all show prometaphase 
disturbances, including scattered and lagging chromosomes. Our data suggest that 
PARsylation of Miki by tankyrase-1 is a key initial event promoting 
prometaphase.
