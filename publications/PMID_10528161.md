Transmembrane adapter proteins are a class of molecules that mediate signals 
from an extracellular receptor to the cytoplasm of the cell. We have cloned a 
novel transmembrane adapter protein called KAP10, a approximately 10-kDa protein 
that is encoded within 100 bp of the DAP12 locus on human chromosome 19. KAP10 
is predominantly expressed in immune cells, including NK cells, T cells, and 
monocytes. We show that KAP10, unlike other transmembrane adapter proteins, 
binds phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase following phosphorylation of a cytoplasmic 
YINM motif, which results in activation of Akt. In addition, we identify KAP10 
as being able to bind the adapter protein Grb2. Based on our data, we suggest 
that this molecule is involved in stimulation and costimulation in cells of both 
myeloid and lymphoid origin.
