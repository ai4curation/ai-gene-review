Integrator is a multi-subunit protein complex responsible for premature 
transcription termination of coding and non-coding RNAs. This is achieved via 
two enzymatic activities, RNA endonuclease and protein phosphatase, acting on 
the promoter-proximally paused RNA polymerase Ⅱ (RNAPⅡ). Yet, it remains unclear 
how Integrator assembly and recruitment are regulated and what the functions of 
many of its core subunits are. Here, we report the structures of two human 
Integrator sub-complexes: INTS10/13/14/15 and INTS5/8/10/15, and an integrative 
model of the fully assembled Integrator bound to the RNAPⅡ paused elongating 
complex (PEC). An in silico protein-protein interaction screen of over 1,500 
human transcription factors (TFs) identified ZNF655 as a direct interacting 
partner of INTS13 within the fully assembled Integrator. We propose a model 
wherein INTS13 acts as a platform for the recruitment of TFs that could modulate 
the stability of the Integrator's association at specific loci and regulate 
transcription attenuation of the target genes.
