Histone acetylation and deacetylation were found to be catalyzed by structurally 
distinct, multisubunit complexes that mediate, respectively, activation and 
repression of transcription. ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling, mediated by 
different multisubunit complexes, was thought to be involved only in 
transcription activation. Here we report the isolation of a protein complex that 
contains both histone deacetylation and ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling 
activities. The complex contains the histone deacetylases HDAC1/2, 
histone-binding proteins, the dermatomyositis-specific autoantigen Mi2beta, a 
polypeptide related to the metastasis-associated protein 1, and a novel 
polypeptide of 32 kDa. Patients with dermatomyositis have a high rate of 
malignancy. The finding that Mi2beta exists in a complex containing histone 
deacetylase and nucleosome remodeling activities suggests a role for chromatin 
reorganization in cancer metastasis.
