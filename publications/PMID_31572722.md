The coat protein complex I (COPI) is an essential, highly conserved pathway that 
traffics proteins and lipids between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the 
Golgi. Many aspects of the COPI machinery are well understood at the structural, 
biochemical and genetic levels. However, we know much less about how cells 
dynamically modulate COPI trafficking in response to changing signals, metabolic 
state, stress or other stimuli. Recently, post-translational modifications 
(PTMs) have emerged as one common theme in the regulation of the COPI pathway. 
Here, we review a range of modifications and mechanisms that govern COPI 
activity in interphase cells and suggest potential future directions to address 
as-yet unanswered questions.
