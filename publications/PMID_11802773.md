Neuronal members of the degenerin/epithelial Na(+) channel (DEG/ENaC) family of 
cation channels include the mammalian brain Na(+) channel 1 (BNC1), acid-sensing 
ion channel (ASIC) and dorsal-root acid-sensing ion channel (DRASIC). Their 
response to acidic pH, their sequence similarity to nematode proteins involved 
in mechanotransduction and their modulation by neuropeptides suggest that they 
may function as receptors for a number of different stimuli. Using the yeast 
two-hybrid assay, we found that the PDZ domain-containing protein PICK1 (protein 
interacting with C kinase) interacts specifically with the C-termini of BNC1 and 
ASIC, but not DRASIC or the related alphaENaC or betaENaC. In both the yeast 
two-hybrid system and mammalian cells, deletion of the BNC1 and ASIC C-termini 
abolished the interaction with PICK1. Likewise, mutating the PDZ domain in PICK1 
abolished its interaction with BNC1 and ASIC. In addition, in a heterologous 
expression system PICK1 altered the distribution of BNC1 channels; this effect 
was dependent on the PDZ domain of PICK1 and the C-terminus of BNC1. We found 
crude synaptosomal fractions of brain to be enriched in ASIC, suggesting a 
possible synaptic localization. Moreover, in transfected hippocampal neurons 
ASIC co-localized with PICK1 in a punctate pattern at synapses. These data 
suggest that PICK1 binds ASIC and BNC1 via its PDZ domain. This interaction may 
be important for the localization and/or function of these channels in both the 
central and peripheral nervous systems.
