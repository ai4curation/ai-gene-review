Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF) plays an important role in erythroid 
development by stimulating β-globin gene expression. We have examined the 
details by which the minimal transactivation domain (TAD) of EKLF (EKLFTAD) 
interacts with several transcriptional regulatory factors. We report that 
EKLFTAD displays homology to the p53TAD and, like the p53TAD, can be divided 
into two functional subdomains (EKLFTAD1 and EKLFTAD2). Based on sequence 
analysis, we found that EKLFTAD2 is conserved in KLF2, KLF4, KLF5, and KLF15. In 
addition, we demonstrate that EKLFTAD2 binds the amino-terminal PH domain of the 
Tfb1/p62 subunit of TFIIH (Tfb1PH/p62PH) and four domains of CREB-binding 
protein/p300. The solution structure of the EKLFTAD2/Tfb1PH complex indicates 
that EKLFTAD2 binds Tfb1PH in an extended conformation, which is in contrast to 
the α-helical conformation seen for p53TAD2 in complex with Tfb1PH. These 
studies provide detailed mechanistic information into EKLFTAD functions as well 
as insights into potential interactions of the TADs of other KLF proteins. In 
addition, they suggest that not only have acidic TADs evolved so that they bind 
using different conformations on a common target, but that transitioning from a 
disordered to a more ordered state is not a requirement for their ability to 
bind multiple partners.

Abstract

Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF) plays an important role in erythroid development by stimulating β-globin gene expression. We have examined the details by which the minimal transactivation domain (TAD) of EKLF (EKLFTAD) interacts with several transcriptional regulatory factors. We report that EKLFTAD displays homology to the p53TAD and, like the p53TAD, can be divided into two functional subdomains (EKLFTAD1 and EKLFTAD2). Based on sequence analysis, we found that EKLFTAD2 is conserved in KLF2, KLF4, KLF5, and KLF15. In addition, we demonstrate that EKLFTAD2 binds the amino-terminal PH domain of the Tfb1/p62 subunit of TFIIH (Tfb1PH/p62PH) and four domains of CREB-binding protein/p300. The solution structure of the EKLFTAD2/Tfb1PH complex indicates that EKLFTAD2 binds Tfb1PH in an extended conformation, which is in contrast to the α-helical conformation seen for p53TAD2 in complex with Tfb1PH. These studies provide detailed mechanistic information into EKLFTAD functions as well as insights into potential interactions of the TADs of other KLF proteins. In addition, they suggest that not only have acidic TADs evolved so that they bind using different conformations on a common target, but that transitioning from a disordered to a more ordered state is not a requirement for their ability to bind multiple partners.

Discussion

The structures of EKLFTAD2, p53TAD2 ( 27 ), and VP16C ( 26 ) bound to Tfb1PH allow us to make comparisons between the three acidic TADs bound to a common target. In both the p53TAD2/TFb1PH and the VP16C/Tfb1PH complexes ( 26 , 27 ), three hydrophobic residues on one face of the α-helix make crucial contacts with Tfb1PH and in both cases one of the hydrophobic residues (Phe54 of p53TAD2 and Phe479 of VP16C) is inserted into the same pocket on Tfb1PH as Trp73 of EKLFTAD2 (Fig. S5 A and B ). In this pocket, the phenylalanine residues of p53TAD2 and VP16C participate in virtually identical interactions with Tfb1PH as observed for Trp73 in EKLFTAD2. Surprisingly, this is the only real similarity between the EKLFTAD2/Tfb1PH complex and either the p53TAD2/Tfb1PH or VP16C/Tfb1PH complex along the binding interface. However, by binding in an elongated form, EKLFTAD2 contributes a significantly larger interface (≈700 Å 2 ) than either p53TAD2 (≈380 Å 2 ) or VP16C (≈500 Å 2 ) in complex with Tfb1PH.

Previous structural studies indicate that acidic TADs have the capability to interact with multiple partners due to their ability to couple folding with binding ( 23 , 36 – 38 ). The transition of p53TAD2 and VP16C from a disordered state to a helical conformation when bound to Tfb1PH is consistent with this idea ( 26 , 27 ). In contrast, EKLFTAD2 binds to Tfb1PH in a nonhelical form, and this indicates that acidic TADs can recognize identical target proteins using different structural conformations. The structures of p53TAD2, VP16C, and EKLFTAD2 in complex with Tfb1PH/p62PH also suggest that coupling folding and binding is common, but not a strict requirement for TADs interacting with their partner proteins. This is further supported by the structure of a complex containing the acidic carboxyl-terminal domain of the alpha subunit of the general transcription factor IIE (TFIIEαCTD) bound to p62PH. In this structure, an acidic region of TFIIEαCTD binds in a virtually identical conformation as EKLFTAD2 along the same binding interface and inserts a phenylalanine side chain (Phe387) in the same pocket of Tfb1PH as Trp73 ( Figs. S5 C and Fig. S6 ) ( 39 , 40 ).

A similar situation is observed with the structures of the TADs of STAT2, CITED2, and HIF-1α bound to the TAZ1 domain of CBP ( 36 , 38 , 41 ). These TADs bind to the same surface of TAZ1, but they bind using two different orientations (N to C and C to N) and by utilizing different combinations of helical segments. Despite binding through distinct mechanisms they differ from EKLFTAD2 in that all three of these acidic TADs require the formation of an alpha helical conformation through a coupled folding and binding mechanism ( 36 , 38 , 41 ). However, they clearly demonstrate that the target (TAZ1) is able to bind acidic TADs containing different structural conformations.

The interaction of EKLFTAD with Tfb1PH/p62PH is consistent with the fact that TFIIH is required for β-globin expression and a mutation in TFIIH leads to β-thalassemia ( 28 – 30 ). The structure of the Tfb1PH/EKLFTAD2 complex demonstrates that Trp73 is crucial for this interaction and is supported by in vivo results demonstrating that mutations of Trp73 leads to significantly lower levels of β-globin gene activation in K562 cells. The results demonstrating that EKLFTAD2 binds the same four subdomains of CBP as p53TAD2 are in agreement with studies demonstrating that acetylation of EKLF by CBP is required for activation of β-globin gene expression ( 12 – 14 ). As was the case for binding to Tfb1PH/p62PH, Trp73 is important for EKLFTAD2 interaction with CBP. These results also suggest that p53TAD2 and EKLFTAD2 may share other common binding partners, but they may bind these targets using different conformations.

Sequence comparisons indicate that a domain similar to EKLFTAD2 is also present in KLF2, KLF4, KLF5, and KLF15 ( Fig. 1 ) ( 1 ). This is supported by studies demonstrating that these four KLF proteins all interact with CBP/p300 through the region that is homologous to EKLFTAD2 ( 42 – 45 ). This strongly suggests that KLF2, KLF4, KLF5, and KLF15 will bind to a number of the same regulatory factors as EKLFTAD2. Additional structural and functional studies are needed to determine whether these homologous regions of the other KLF proteins bind to their target proteins in an elongated form like EKLFTAD2 or if they form helices as typically seen with acidic TADs such as p53 and VP16. In addition to the minimal EKLFTAD, EKLF contains a second domain (residues 140–232) that is sufficient for activation of β-globin gene expression ( 34 , 35 ). Mutational analysis demonstrated that these domains appear to serve redundant functions ( 34 ), although the mechanistic details by which this second region of EKLF functions is not understood ( 35 ). The primary sequences of the two domains are very different, with EKLFTAD being very acidic (pI = 3.8) and the region between residues 140 and 232 being very basic (pI = 9.7) with only two acidic residues. However, the redundant functions suggest the two domains recruit the same transcriptional regulatory factors and future studies are needed to determine if this second domain of EKLF also binds TFIIH and CBP/p300.
