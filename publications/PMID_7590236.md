A protein has been identified that interacts specifically with both the Src 
homologous 3 (SH3) domain and carboxy-terminal sequences of the c-Abl tyrosine 
kinase. The cDNA encoding the Abl interactor protein (Abi-2), was isolated from 
a human lymphocyte library using the yeast two-hybrid system with the Abl SH3 
domain as bait. Abi-2 binds to c-Abl in vitro and in vivo. Abi-2 is a novel 
protein that contains an SH3 domain and proline-rich sequences critical for 
binding to c-Abl. A basic region in the amino terminus of Abi-2 is homologous to 
the DNA-binding sequence of homeo-domain proteins. We show that Abi-2 is a 
substrate for the c-Abl tyrosine kinase. Expression of an Abi-2 mutant protein 
that lacks sequences required for binding to the Abl SH3 domain but retains 
binding to the Abl carboxyl terminus activates the transforming capacity of 
c-Abl. The properties of Abi-2 are consistent with a dual role as regulator and 
potential effector of the c-Abl protein and suggest that Abi-2 may function as a 
tumor suppressor in mammalian cells.
