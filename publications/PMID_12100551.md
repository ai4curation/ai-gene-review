Most bacteriophages abruptly terminate their vegetative cycle by causing lysis 
of the host cell. The ssDNA phage phi X174 uses a single lysis gene, E, encoding 
a 91-amino-acid membrane protein that causes lysis of Escherichia coli by 
inhibiting MraY, a conserved enzyme of murein biosynthesis. Recessive mutations 
in the host gene slyD (sensitivity to lysis) absolutely block E-mediated lysis 
and phi X174 plaque formation. The slyD gene encodes a FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl 
cis-trans isomerase (PPIase). To investigate the molecular basis of this unique 
FKBP-dependence, spontaneous plaque-forming mutants of phi X174 were isolated on 
a slyD lawn. All of these Epos ('plates on slyD') suppressors encode proteins 
with either a R3H or L19F change. The double mutant was also isolated and 
generated the largest plaques on the slyD lawn. A c-myc epitope tag sequence was 
incorporated into the parental E and Epos genes without effect on lytic 
function. Western blots and pulse-chase labelling experiments showed that both 
Epos and E are highly unstable in a slyD background; however, Epos is 
synthesized at a higher rate, allowing a lysis-sufficient level of Epos to 
accumulate. Our results indicate that SlyD is required for stabilizing the E 
protein and allowing it to accumulate to the levels required to exert its lytic 
effect. These data are discussed in terms of a model for the specific role of 
the SlyD PPIase in E folding, and of the use of the very strict SlyD- dependence 
phenotype for identifying elements of PPIase selectivity.
