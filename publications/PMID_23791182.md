Sequencing efforts led to the identification of somatic mutations that could 
affect the self-renewal and differentiation of cancer-initiating cells. One such 
recurrent mutation targets the binding pocket of the ubiquitin ligase Fbxw7. 
Missense FBXW7 mutations are prevalent in various tumors, including T cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). To study the effects of such lesions, we 
generated animals carrying regulatable Fbxw7 mutant alleles. Here, we show that 
these mutations specifically bolster cancer-initiating cell activity in 
collaboration with Notch1 oncogenes but spare normal hematopoietic stem cell 
function. We were also able to show that FBXW7 mutations specifically affect the 
ubiquitylation and half-life of c-Myc protein, a key T-ALL oncogene. Using 
animals carrying c-Myc fusion alleles, we connected Fbxw7 function to c-Myc 
abundance and correlated c-Myc expression to leukemia-initiating activity. 
Finally, we demonstrated that small-molecule-mediated suppression of MYC 
activity leads to T-ALL remission, suggesting an effective therapeutic strategy.

INTRODUCTION

As next generation sequencing studies identify novel genetic lesions in cancer, it becomes evident that mutations affecting key regulators of diverse cellular processes ranging from metabolism to protein stability are somatically selected in cancer cells ( Downing et al., 2012 ; Hodis et al., 2012 ; Zhang et al., 2012 ). The most obvious explanation for these paradoxical events is that such mutations are somehow able to bestow cells with tumorigenic properties while sparing normal cell functions. Heterozygosity of several such mutations further complicates the understanding of such mechanisms as it suggests that either small protein expression differences can have profound outcomes or that missense mutants could have neomorphic and/or dominant negative functions. Finally, it is conceivable that similar mutations do not act in isolation but in combination with additional oncogenic lesions. It is thus imperative to study the impact of somatic missense mutations using both genetic models closely mimicking the corresponding human cancer genotypes and studying in vivo effects of mutational cooperation.

The study of leukemia offers a large number of somatic missense mutations that target key components of cellular function. One of the most prominent examples is the large number of recurrent mutations targeting Fbxw7 , a constituent of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-Fbox) ubiquitin ligase complex that controls the degradation and half-life of key cellular regulators including Cyclin E, Notch1, c-Myc and Mcl1 ( Crusio et al., 2010 ; Inuzuka et al., 2011 ; Popov et al., 2010 ; Wertz et al., 2011 ). FBXW7 is mutated in a significant fraction of human tumors, including approximately 20% of patients with pediatric T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) ( O’Neil et al., 2007 ; Thompson et al., 2007 ). These mutations are predominantly heterozygous and cluster within the WD40 substrate-binding domain, and specifically affect three highly conserved arginine residues ( Nash et al., 2001 ). Although the outcome of expressing these particular mutations in somatic tissues remains unknown, monoallelic deletion of Fbxw7 in the hematopoietic system fails to induce leukemia. Complete deletion can lead to T-ALL establishment, albeit with low penetrance ( Matsuoka et al., 2008 ). However, the prevailing phenotype of Fbxw7 loss is progressive bone marrow failure, eventually leading to fatal anemia, suggesting that complete Fbxw7 inactivation is incompatible with physiological stem and progenitor cell differentiation. In agreement with this finding, nonsense FBXW7 mutations are relatively rare in T-ALL ( O’Neil et al., 2007 ; Thompson et al., 2007 ). These studies suggest that FBXW7 missense mutants are not simply “dead” alleles and could behave differently in normal and malignant cells. Although the biochemical mechanisms behind FBXW7 mutations in T-ALL remains unclear, we and others have suggested that these lesions could affect the stability of NOTCH1, the main T-ALL oncogene, itself mutated in approximately half of T cell leukemia patients ( Weng et al., 2004 ). In agreement with this notion, approximately 25% of NOTCH1 mutations in T-ALL truncate the protein deleting the conserved degron sequence recognized by Fbxw7. Similar mutations in either NOTCH1 or FBXW7 genes are also found in a larger number of additional cancer types, including marginal B cell lymphoma, melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma ( Akhoondi et al., 2007 ; Hodis et al., 2012 ; Rossi et al., 2012 ; Stransky et al., 2011 ), making the thorough understanding of their function critical for future therapies.

To study in vivo the transforming effects of such missense mutations, we have generated mice that carry Cre-inducible Fbxw7 heterozygote mutants, mimicking the most common substitution found in human T-ALL. Interestingly, in contrast to previous knockout models, such missense Fbxw7 mutations did not compromise normal hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor function, suggesting distinct thresholds of Fbxw7 activity in normal versus malignant hematopoiesis. Consistent with this notion, further studies demonstrated that Fbxw7 mutations lead to a marked increase in the number of leukemia-initiating cells (LIC) due to stabilization of the Fbxw7 substrate c-Myc. Using animals expressing fluorescent c-Myc fusion proteins ( Myc GFP ) we were able to show a perfect correlation between c-Myc stabilization and leukemia-initiating activity. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate that c-Myc deletion in established T-ALL specifically ablates LIC and that inhibition of c-Myc induction using small molecule BET/BRD inhibitors ( Filippakopoulos et al., 2010 ; Zuber et al., 2011 ) can suppress growth of mouse and human T-ALL cells. Finally, genomic studies identified direct c-Myc and Brd4 gene targets in T-ALL and suggested an intriguing transcriptional co-operation between Notch1 and Myc in this type of leukemia. Taken together, these studies identify FBXW7 R465C as a novel class of cancer somatic mutations, as it has the ability to specifically alter cancer-initiating cell activity without consequence to normal stem cell differentiation.

DISCUSSION

In this study we used animal modeling of recurrent somatic FBXW7 mutations to study their function in leukemia initiation and progression. We found that such missense mutations specifically augment the function of leukemia-initiating cells (LIC) and at the same time are dispensable for normal hematopoiesis, explaining their selection during evolution of leukemia genomes and the significant abundance of FBXW7 missense (but fewer nonsense, insertion or deletion) mutations in human T-ALL. The differential function of FBXW7 mutations could be explained by the existence of distinct thresholds of c-Myc expression between physiological and malignant stem cells. This is an important finding as it suggests that genetic or pharmacological modulation of the FBXW7:MYC interaction could specifically target leukemia stem cells. Indeed, we were able to show that Myc deletion suppresses established TALL by eliminating leukemia initiating cells and pharmacologic targeting of c-Myc induction suppresses the growth of human and mouse T-ALL, including those that carry FBXW7 mutations and are resistant to NOTCH inhibition.

Another important finding illustrated here is that for the first time we are able to visualize cancer (leukemia) initiating cells using in vivo genetic fluorescent labeling. Indeed, using the c-Myc GFP reporter strain, we were able to correlate c-Myc protein abundance to leukemia initiating cell (LIC) activity. The correlation was complete, as we were able to show total absence of LIC activity in the c-Myc GFP negative tumor fraction. This is an exciting finding as it gives us the ability to highly purify LIC and study their biology. For example, we were able to demonstrate that T-ALL LIC have a characteristic surface phenotype and their gene expression patterns correlate to gene signatures characteristic of earlier stages of differentiation, including hematopoietic and embryonic stem cells. Interestingly, a large proportion of these LIC-specific genes are bound by both c-Myc and Notch1, both of which are key oncogenes in T-ALL. Brd4 is also present at most of these loci, a finding that can explain the therapeutic efficacy of BET inhibitors. Moreover, this is the first time that c-Myc expression directly correlated in vivo to LIC populations. Accordingly, human T-ALL LIC-enriched populations also express high levels of c-Myc protein and FBXW7 mutations lead to significant MYC stabilization, suggesting that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. However, this is not a universal characteristic of tumor initiating cell populations. Indeed, we have recently performed studies using animal models of BCR-ABL-driven chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a prototypic LIC-driven disease. In this leukemia model, Myc expression does not define the cell population that has the ability to initiate and propagate disease ( Reavie et al., 2013 ), suggesting that different oncogenes and cellular settings could have distinct requirements for Myc expression and function.

As we have identified c-Myc as marker of LIC in animal models of T-ALL, we hypothesized that pharmacologic inhibition of MYC induction would be a feasible approach in the treatment of human TALL. Initially, inhibition of the Notch pathway using gamma-secretase inhibitors (γSI) was a promising therapeutic approach, but it has presented considerable challenges (GI toxicity, acquisition of resistance) for its adaptation in the clinic. While c-Myc is critical in the development of a wide range of tissues, recent studies have suggested that c-Myc inhibition is surprisingly well tolerated at least in pre-clinical animal studies ( Soucek et al., 2008 ). We show here that genetic inactivation of Myc in established T-ALL specifically targeted the LIC fraction, eventually leading to tumor regression and loss of LIC self-renewal. Similarly, treatment of human T-ALL lines and primary leukemic cells with BET inhibitors (JQ1, CPI203) completely suppressed c-Myc response, leading to rapid growth arrest. Unlike γSI treatment, this effect is irrespective of FBXW7 status, suggesting such compounds could have broader applications across tumor genotypes. It remains to be seen whether BET inhibition will be as efficient for the treatment of either relapsed T-ALL or highly aggressive T-ALL subtypes, including early T cell progenitor (ETP) T-ALL that is also resistant to NOTCH pathway inhibition ( Zhang et al., 2012 ).

The combination of disease modeling to whole genome and transcriptome studies lead to findings that could have major implications for the understanding of oncogenic (NOTCH, MYC) interactions and their role in gene expression regulation and cancer initiation. Indeed our studies suggest that Notch1 is not sufficient to induce or maintain transplantable T-ALL in the absence of c-Myc function. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the majority of LIC-specific genes are bound by both transcription factors but deletion of Myc can abrogate LIC activity. In agreement to this notion, it has been shown in vitro that MYC overexpression can induce resistance to Notch pathway inhibition ( Weng et al., 2006 ). We thus hypothesize that Notch1 acts as a pioneering factor, influencing lineage commitment and the activity of epigenetic regulators ( Ntziachristos et al., 2012 ), altering the chromatin structure of its transcriptional targets to a more permissive state. When c-Myc becomes expressed and stabilized (due to mutation or downregulation of FBXW7 ), it can bind to newly accessible E-box motifs, thereby amplifying established gene expression programs ( Figure 7C ). These studies support, in an in vivo tumor model, the “MYC transcriptional amplification” hypothesis recently postulated ( Lin et al., 2012 ; Nie et al., 2012 ). They also prove that this transcriptional amplification mode has in vivo consequences in cancer initiation and can be pharmacologically targeted. Finally, our studies show that such key transcriptional responses can be post-translationally regulated and that oncogenic events invented ways to hijack them, as shown using in vivo modeling of the FBXW7 missense mutations.
