Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common neurological disorder caused by 
mutations in the gene encoding Neurofibromin, a p21Ras GTPase Activating Protein 
(GAP). Importantly, NF1 causes learning disabilities and attention deficits. A 
previous study showed that the learning and memory deficits of a mouse model of 
NF1 (nf1+/-) appear to be caused by excessive p21Ras activity leading to 
impairments in long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular mechanism of learning 
and memory. Here, we identify lovastatin as a potent inhibitor of p21Ras/Mitogen 
Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) activity in the brain. Lovastatin is a specific 
inhibitor of three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, used 
commonly for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. We report that lovastatin 
decreased the enhanced brain p21Ras-MAPK activity of the nf1+/- mice, rescued 
their LTP deficits, and reversed their spatial learning and attention 
impairments. Therefore, these results demonstrate that lovastatin may prove 
useful in the treatment of Neurofibromatosis Type 1.
