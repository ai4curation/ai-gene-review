Elevated beta-amyloid is thought to trigger the onset of Alzheimer's disease. 
Alzheimer's disease is marked by progressive loss of cognitive function, an 
early symptom of which is episodic memory deficits. Impairment of episodic 
memory is linked to hippocampal pathology. We investigated the signal 
transduction consequences of exposure to nanomolar to low micromolar 
concentrations of aggregate forms of beta-amyloid in the hippocampus. We found 
that, in addition to activation of ERK MAPK and its downstream target ribosomal 
S6 kinase in hippocampal slice cultures following acute exposure to oligomeric 
beta-amyloid(1-42), ERK activation also requires phosphoinositide-3 kinase 
activity. These effects were contingent on the alpha7 subtype of nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptor. Hippocampal slice cultures treated acutely with 
oligomeric beta-amyloid(1-42) did not exhibit JNK MAPK activation; however, 
chronic exposure to oligomers or high molecular weight aggregates of 
beta-amyloid(1-42) led to JNK MAPK activation coincident with ERK MAPK 
down-regulation. In contrast to the effects of acute application of oligomeric 
beta-amyloid(1-42), nicotine activated ERK MAPK via alpha7 nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptors utilizing protein kinase A as an intermediate. In 
conclusion, we found that both the physical state and duration of exposure to 
beta-amyloid are determinants of MAPK recruitment in hippocampus. We also found 
that nicotine and beta-amyloid activate ERK MAPK via alpha7 nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptors but use distinct intermediate kinases. These data 
indicate the existence of differential coupling of alpha7 to downstream targets 
depending on the type of ligand that leads to receptor activation.
