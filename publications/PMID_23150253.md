RNA Polymerase (Pol) I produces ribosomal (r)RNA, an essential component of the 
cellular protein synthetic machinery that drives cell growth, underlying many 
fundamental cellular processes. Extensive research into the mechanisms governing 
transcription by Pol I has revealed an intricate set of control mechanisms 
impinging upon rRNA production. Pol I-specific transcription factors guide Pol I 
to the rDNA promoter and contribute to multiple rounds of transcription 
initiation, promoter escape, elongation and termination. In addition, many 
accessory factors are now known to assist at each stage of this transcription 
cycle, some of which allow the integration of transcriptional activity with 
metabolic demands. The organisation and accessibility of rDNA chromatin also 
impinge upon Pol I output, and complex mechanisms ensure the appropriate 
maintenance of the epigenetic state of the nucleolar genome and its effective 
transcription by Pol I. The following review presents our current understanding 
of the components of the Pol I transcription machinery, their functions and 
regulation by associated factors, and the mechanisms operating to ensure the 
proper transcription of rDNA chromatin. The importance of such stringent control 
is demonstrated by the fact that deregulated Pol I transcription is a feature of 
cancer and other disorders characterised by abnormal translational capacity.
