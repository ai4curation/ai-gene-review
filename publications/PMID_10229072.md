The Nck adaptor protein links tyrosine kinases or their substrates to proteins 
containing proline-rich motifs. Here we show that in activated T cells two 
tyrosine phosphoproteins of 75 and 120 kDa are co-immunoprecipitated with 
polyclonal antibodies against Nck. Analysis of Nck immunoprecipitates with 
various candidate antibodies revealed that the 75-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein is 
the SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein referred to as SLP-76. In vitro 
experiments show that the interaction between Nck and SLP-76 is mediated via the 
Nck SH2 domain. Using specific phosphopeptides corresponding to the major 
tyrosine phosphorylation sites of SLP-76, it was found that Y113 and Y128 
phosphopeptides could compete binding of SLP-76 to the SH2 domain of Nck. In 
addition, the 120-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein was recognized by an antibody 
raised against Cbl, a proto-oncogene product that has been previously found to 
be associated with Nck. These results suggest that the Nck adaptor protein 
interacts with key signaling molecules and may play an important role in 
activation of T lymphocytes.
