The Hsp27 gene is not required for Drosophila development but its activity is 
associated with starvation resistance.

Heat shock proteins are induced under stress conditions and they act as 
molecular chaperones to refold denatured polypeptides. Stress resistances 
including thermotolerance generally are correlated with levels of the heat shock 
proteins. We investigated a fruit fly gene encoding a small heat shock protein, 
Hsp27, to determine if it functions in stress response of Drosophila 
melanogaster. A knockout Hsp27 allele was generated. Flies homozygous for this 
allele were viable, without obvious defects, and fertile, indicating Hsp27 is 
not essential for development. In stress-response tests, loss of the Hsp27 gene 
caused no defects in resistance to heat shock or oxidative treatments. However, 
a significant reduction in starvation resistance was associated with the 
genotype without a functional Hsp27 gene. The data suggest that the Drosophila 
HSP27 protein acts as a chaperone to provide cellular stress resistance, 
although its function may be limited to a subset of the stress response such as 
the starvation resistance.
