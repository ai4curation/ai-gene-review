BACKGROUND: We investigated changes in the gene expression profile in colon 
cancer in order to identify gene markers that may be useful in the management of 
this disease.
METHODS: The Cancer Genome Anatomy Project was used to detect differences in 
gene expression between normal and cancer tissue. The overexpression of 
dipeptidase-1 (DPEP1) in cancer tissue was confirmed in a sample of 76 patients 
by real-time PCR. To identify the function of DPEP1, RNA interference (RNAi) was 
used to inactivate this gene in the colon cancer cell line. Immunohistochemical 
analysis was performed to characterize the pattern of DPEP1 expression in colon 
cancer.
RESULTS: DPEP1 expression in cancer was significantly higher than that in normal 
tissue. However, DPEP1 expression decreased with pathological differentiation, 
lymph-node and distant metastasis. Patients with tumors with decreased DPEP1 
expression showed a poorer prognosis, and this was also true of patients with 
tumors who are treated with curative intent. RNAi-mediated DPEP1 reduction in 
the colon cancer cell line did not result in cell proliferation or apoptosis, 
but was associated with an increased invasive ability. DPEP1 protein was 
observed on the apical side of the cancer cells, and is expressed in the early 
stages of carcinogenesis, even in adenomas of both sporadic colorectal cancer 
and familial adenomatous polyposis patients.
CONCLUSIONS: DPEP1 expression in normal colonic mucosa is very low, but it is 
highly expressed in colorectal adenoma and cancer specimens and is negatively 
correlated with parameters of pathological aggressiveness and poor prognosis. 
DPEP1 is expressed in the early stages of colon carcinogenesis and affects 
cancer cell invasiveness.
