Platelet-derived growth factor: purification and partial characterization.

Heldin CH, Westermark B, Wasteson A.

A cationic protein that stimulates DNA synthesis in human cultured cells was 
isolated from human platelets by ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic 
chromatography, gel chromatography, and gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl 
sulfate. The electrophoretic behavior of biologically active or radioiodinated 
and reduced growth factor indicated that the native protein (approximately 
30,000 daltons) was composed of two different polypeptides (approximately 
13,000-14,000 and 16,000-17,000 daltons, respectively) linked via 
reduction-susceptible bonds. The stimulatory activity on human glial cells of 
the purified product at a concentration of approximately 4 ng/ml (0.13 nM) was 
equal to that of 1% human serum.
