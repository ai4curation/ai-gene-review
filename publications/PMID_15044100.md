Human LPTS/PinX1 is a telomerase-inhibitory protein, which binds to the telomere 
protein Pin2/TRF1 and the catalytic subunit hTERT of telomerase. To explore the 
proteins that might be involved in the telomerase pathway, we performed a yeast 
two-hybrid screening with LPTS/PinX1 as the bait. A novel gene, MCRS2, encoding 
for an isoform of MCRS1/p78 and MSP58 was isolated. The expression of MCRS2 
protein is cell-cycle dependent, accumulating in the very early S phase. MCRS2 
interacts with LPTS/PinX1 in vitro, in vivo and colocalizes with LPTS/PinX1 in 
cells. MCRS2 and its amino terminus inhibit telomerase activity in vitro and 
long-term overexpression of MCRS2 in SMMC-7721 cells results in a gradual and 
progressive shortening of telomeres. Our findings suggest that MCRS2 might be a 
linker between telomere maintenance and cell-cycle regulation.
