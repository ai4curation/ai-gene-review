The Polycomb-group (PcG) is a diverse set of proteins required for maintenance 
of gene silencing during development. In a screen for conserved partners of the 
PcG protein Polycomblike (Pcl), we have identified a new protein, human CHMP1 
(CHromatin Modifying Protein; CHarged Multivesicular body Protein), which is 
encoded by an alternative open reading frame in the PRSM1 gene and is conserved 
in both complex and simple eukaryotes. CHMP1 contains a predicted bipartite 
nuclear localization signal and distributes as distinct forms to the cytoplasm 
and the nuclear matrix in all cell lines tested. We have constructed a stable 
HEK293 cell line that inducibly overexpresses CHMP1 under ecdysone control. 
Overexpressed CHMP1 localizes to a punctate subnuclear pattern, encapsulating 
regions of nuclease-resistant, condensed chromatin. These novel structures are 
also frequently surrounded by increased histone H3 phosphorylation and 
acetylation. CHMP1 can recruit a PcG protein, BMI1, to these regions of 
condensed chromatin and can cooperate with co-expressed vertebrate Pcl in a 
Xenopus embryo PcG assay; this is consistent with a role in PcG function. In 
combination, these observations suggest that CHMP1 plays a role in stable gene 
silencing within the nucleus.
