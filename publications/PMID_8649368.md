Integrin-mediated cell adhesion triggers intracellular signaling cascades, 
including tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins. Among these are 
the focal adhesion proteins p130cas (Cas) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Here 
we identify the kinase(s) mediating integrin-induced Cas phosphorylation and 
characterize protein-protein interactions mediated by phosphorylated Cas. We 
found that expression of a constitutively active FAK in fibroblasts results in a 
consecutive tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas. This effect required the 
autophosphorylation site of FAK, which is a binding site for Src family kinases. 
Integrin-mediated phosphorylation of Cas was not, however, compromised in 
fibroblasts lacking FAK. In contrast, adhesion-induced tyrosine phosphorylation 
of Cas was reduced in cells lacking Src, whereas enhanced phosphorylation of Cas 
was observed Csk- cells, in which Src kinases are activated. These results 
suggest that Src kinases are responsible for the integrin-mediated tyrosine 
phosphorylation of Cas. FAK seems not to be necessary for phosphorylation of 
Cas, but when autophosphorylated, FAK may recruit Src family kinases to 
phosphorylate Cas. Cas was found to form complexes with Src homology 2 (SH2) 
domain-containing signaling molecules, such as the SH2/SH3 adapter protein Crk, 
following integrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Guanine nucleotide exchange 
factors C3G and Sos were found in the Cas-Crk complex upon integrin ligand 
binding. These observations suggest that Cas serves as a docking protein and may 
transduce signals to downstream signaling pathways following integrin-mediated 
cell adhesion.
