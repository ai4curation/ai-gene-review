We have identified a novel p110 isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase from 
human leukocytes that we have termed p110delta. In addition, we have 
independently isolated p110delta from a mouse embryo library on the basis of its 
ability to interact with Ha-RasV12 in the yeast two-hybrid system. This unique 
isoform contains all of the conserved structural features characteristic of the 
p110 family. Recombinant p110delta phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol and 
coimmunoprecipitates with p85. However, in contrast to previously described p110 
subunits, p110delta is expressed in a tissue-restricted fashion; it is expressed 
at high levels in lymphocytes and lymphoid tissues and may therefore play a role 
in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated signaling in the immune system.
