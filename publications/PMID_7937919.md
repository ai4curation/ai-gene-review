Hypersensitive site 2 located in the beta-globin locus control region confers 
high levels of expression to the genes of the beta-globin cluster. A tandem 
repeat of the consensus sequence for the transcription factors AP1 and NF-E2 
(activating protein 1 and nuclear factor erythroid 2, respectively) is present 
within hypersensitive site 2 and is absolutely required for strong enhancer 
activity. This sequence binds, in vitro and in vivo, to ubiquitous proteins of 
the AP1 family and to the recently cloned erythroid-specific transcription 
factor NF-E2. Using the tandem repeat as a recognition site probe to screen a 
lambda gt11 cDNA expression library from K562 cells, we isolated several DNA 
binding proteins. Here, we report the characterization of one of the clones 
isolated. The gene, which we named Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2), is encoded 
within a 2.2-kb transcript and predicts a 66-kDa protein with a basic leucine 
zipper DNA binding domain highly homologous to that of NF-E2. Although Nrf2 is 
expressed ubiquitously, a role of this protein in mediating enhancer activity of 
hypersensitive site 2 in erythroid cells cannot be excluded. In this respect, 
Nrf2 contains a powerful acidic activation domain that may participate in the 
transcriptional stimulation of beta-globin genes.
