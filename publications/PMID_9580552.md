Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) coordinates the trafficking and regulation of 
diverse signalling proteins, but its precise role in regulating specific 
cellular targets is not known. Here we show that Hsp90 associates with 
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and is rapidly recruited to the eNOS 
complex by agonists that stimulate production of nitric oxide, namely vascular 
endothelial growth factor, histamine and fluid shear stress. Moreover, the 
binding of Hsp90 to eNOS enhances the activation of eNOS. Inhibition of 
signalling through Hsp90 attenuates both agonist-stimulated production of nitric 
oxide and endothelium-dependent relaxation of isolated blood vessels. Our 
results indicate that Hsp90 facilitates signalling mediated by growth-factor, 
G-protein and mechanotransduction pathways that lead to the activation of eNOS. 
These observations indicate that in addition to its role as a molecular 
chaperone involved in protein folding and maturation, Hsp90 may also be 
recruited to cellular targets depending on the activation state of the cell.
