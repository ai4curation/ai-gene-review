Inclusions of TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43), a nuclear protein that 
regulates transcription and RNA splicing, are the defining histopathological 
feature of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions 
(FTLD-Us) and sporadic and familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS). In ALS and FTLD-U, aggregated, ubiquitinated, and N-terminally truncated 
TDP-43 can be isolated from brain tissue rich in neuronal and glial cytoplasmic 
inclusions. The loss of TDP-43 function resulting from inappropriate cleavage, 
translocation from the nucleus, or its sequestration into inclusions could play 
important roles in neurodegeneration. However, it is not known whether TDP-43 
fragments directly mediate toxicity and, more specifically, whether their 
abnormal aggregation is a cause or consequence of pathogenesis. We report that 
the ectopic expression of a approximately 25-kDa TDP-43 fragment corresponding 
to the C-terminal truncation product of caspase-cleaved TDP-43 leads to the 
formation of toxic, insoluble, and ubiquitin- and phospho-positive cytoplasmic 
inclusions within cells. The 25-kDa C-terminal fragment is more prone to 
phosphorylation at S409/S410 than full-length TDP-43, but phosphorylation at 
these sites is not required for inclusion formation or toxicity. Although this 
fragment shows no biological activity, its exogenous expression neither inhibits 
the function nor causes the sequestration of full-length nuclear TDP-43, 
suggesting that the 25-kDa fragment can induce cell death through a toxic 
gain-of-function. Finally, by generating a conformation-dependent antibody that 
detects C-terminal fragments, we show that this toxic cleavage product is 
specific for pathologic inclusions in human TDP-43 proteinopathies.
