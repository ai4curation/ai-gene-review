A yeast nuclear gene (ATP10) is reported whose product is essential for the 
assembly of a functional mitochondrial ATPase complex. Mutations in ATP10 induce 
a loss of rutamycin sensitivity in the mitochondrial ATPase but do not affect 
respiratory enzymes. This phenotype has been correlated with a defect in the F0 
sector of the ATPase. The wild type ATP10 gene has been cloned by transformation 
of an atp 10 mutant with a yeast genomic library. The gene codes for a protein 
of Mr = 30,293. The primary structure of the ATP10 product is not related to any 
known subunit of the yeast or mammalian mitochondrial ATPase complexes. To 
further clarify the role of this new protein in the assembly of the ATPase, an 
antibody was prepared against a hybrid protein expressed from a trpE/ATP 10 
fusion gene. The antibody recognizes a 30-kDa protein present in wild type 
mitochondria. The protein is associated with the mitochondrial membrane but does 
not co-fractionate either with F1 or with the rutamycin-sensitive F1-F0 complex. 
These data suggest that the ATP10 product is not a subunit of the ATPase complex 
but rather is required for the assembly of the F0 sector of the complex.
