Dynactin is a multisubunit complex and a required cofactor for most, or all, of 
the cellular processes powered by the microtubule-based motor cytoplasmic 
dynein. Using a dynein affinity column, the previously uncharacterized p62 
subunit of dynactin was isolated and microsequenced. Two peptide sequences were 
used to clone human cDNAs encoding p62. Sequence analysis of the predicted human 
polypeptide of 53 kDa revealed a highly conserved pattern of eleven cysteine 
residues, eight of which fit the consensus sequence for a Zn(2+)-binding RING 
domain. We have characterized p62 as an integral component of 20 S dynactin by 
biochemical and immunocytochemical methods. Affinity chromatography experiments 
demonstrate that p62 binds directly to the Arp1 subunit of dynactin. 
Immunocytochemistry with antibodies to p62 demonstrates that this polypeptide 
has a punctate cytoplasmic distribution as well as centrosomal distribution 
typical of dynactin. In transfected cells, overexpression of p62 did not disrupt 
microtubule organization or the integrity of the Golgi but did cause both 
cytosolic and nuclear distribution of the protein, suggesting that this 
polypeptide may be targeted to the nucleus at very high expression levels.
