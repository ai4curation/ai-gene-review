Human mitochondrial F(1)F(0) ATP synthase was isolated with a one-step 
immunological approach, using a monoclonal antibody against F(1) in a 96-well 
microplate activity assay system, to establish a method for fast high throughput 
screening of inhibitors, toxins, and drugs with very small amounts of enzyme. 
For preparative purification, mitochondria from human heart tissue as well as 
cultured fibroblasts were solubilized with dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside, and the 
F(1)F(0) was isolated with anti-F(1) monoclonal antibody coupled to protein 
G-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitated F(1)F(0) contained a full complement of 
subunits that were identified with specific antibodies against five of the 
subunits (alpha, beta, OSCP, d, and IF(1)) and by MALDI-TOF and/or LC/MS/MS for 
all subunits except subunit c, which could not be resolved by these methods 
because of the limits of detection. Microscale immunocapture of F(1)F(0) from 
detergent-solubilized mitochondria or whole cell fibroblast extracts was 
performed using anti-F(1) monoclonal antibody immobilized on 96-well 
microplates. The captured complex V displayed ATP hydrolysis activity that was 
fully oligomycin and inhibitor protein IF(1)-sensitive. Moreover, IF(1) could be 
co-isolated with F(1)F(0) when the immunocapture procedure was carried out at pH 
6.5 but was absent when the ATP synthase was isolated at pH 8.0. Immunocaptured 
F(1)F(0) lacking IF(1) could be inhibited by more than 90% by addition of 
recombinant inhibitor protein, and conversely, F(1)F(0) containing IF(1) could 
be activated more than 10-fold by brief exposure to pH 8.0, inducing the release 
of inhibitor protein. With this microplate system an ATP hydrolysis assay of 
complex V could be carried out with as little as 10 ng of heart 
mitochondria/well and as few as 3 x 10(4) cells/well from fibroblast cultures. 
The system is therefore suitable to screen patient-derived samples for 
alterations in amount or functionality of both the F(1)F(0) ATPase and IF(1).
