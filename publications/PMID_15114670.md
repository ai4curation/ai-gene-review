Dendritic cells (DC) are the main orchestrators of specific immune responses. 
Depending on microbial information they encounter in peripheral tissues, they 
promote the development of Th1, Th2 or unpolarized Th cell responses. In this 
study we have investigated the immunomodulatory effect of non-pathogenic 
intestinal Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Bacteroides vulgatus,Veillonella 
parvula, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Bifidobacterium 
adolescentis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus 
aureus) bacteria on human monocyte-derived DC (moDC). None of the Gram-positive 
bacteria (GpB) primed for Th1 or Th2 development. In contrast, despite the low 
levels of IL-12 they induce, all Gram-negative bacteria (GnB) primed moDC for 
enhanced Th1 cell development, which was dependent on IL-12 and an additional 
unidentified cofactor. Strikingly, GnB-matured moDC expressed elevated levels of 
p19 and p28 mRNA, the critical subunits of IL-23 and IL-27, respectively, 
suggesting that the IL-12 family members may jointly be responsible for their 
Th1-driving capacity. Purified major cell wall components of either GnB or GpB 
did not yield Th cell profiles identical to those obtained with whole bacteria, 
and could not explain the induction of the IL-12 family members nor Th1 priming 
by GnB. Importantly, this study gives indications that the expression of the 
different IL-12 family members is dictated by different priming conditions of 
immature DC.
