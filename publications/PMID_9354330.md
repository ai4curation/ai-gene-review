The dopamine D3 receptor is expressed primarily in regions of the brain that are 
thought to influence motivation and motor functions. To specify in vivo D3 
receptor function, we generated mutant mice lacking this receptor. Our analysis 
indicates that in a novel environment, D3 mutant mice are transiently more 
active than wild-type mice, an effect not associated with anxiety state. 
Moreover, D3 mutant mice exhibit enhanced behavioral sensitivity to combined 
injections of D1 and D2 class receptor agonists, cocaine and amphetamine. 
However, the combined electrophysiological effects of the same D1 and D2 
agonists on single neurons within the nucleus accumbens were not altered by the 
D3 receptor mutation. We conclude that one function of the D3 receptor is to 
modulate behaviors by inhibiting the cooperative effects of postsynaptic D1 and 
other D2 class receptors at systems level.
