BACKGROUND: Parental separation or divorce is a known risk factor for poorer 
adult health. One mechanism may operate through the uptake of risky health 
behaviours, such as smoking. This study investigated the association between 
parental separation and adult smoking in a large British birth cohort and also 
examined potential socioeconomic, relational and psychosocial mediators. 
Differences by gender and timing of parental separation were also assessed.
METHODS: Multiply imputed data on 11 375 participants of the National Child 
Development Study (the 1958 British birth cohort) were used. A series of 
multinomial logistic regression models were estimated to investigate the 
association between parental separation (0-16 years) and adult smoking status 
(age 42), and the role of potential socioeconomic, relational and psychosocial 
mediators.
RESULTS: Parental separation in childhood was associated with an increased risk 
of being a current (RRR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.77, 2.60) or ex-smoker (RRR = 1.50, 
95% CI: 1.22, 1.85) at age 42. This association remained after consideration of 
potential socioeconomic, psychosocial and relational mediators. Relational 
(parent-child relationship quality, parental involvement and adult partnership 
status) and socioeconomic factors (overcrowding, financial hardship, housing 
tenure, household amenities, free school meal receipt and educational 
attainment) appeared to be the most important of the groups of mediators 
investigated. No differences by gender or the timing of parental separation were 
observed.
CONCLUSION: Parental separation experienced in childhood was associated with 
increased risk of smoking. Families undergoing separation should be further 
supported in order to prevent the uptake of smoking and to prevent later health 
problems.
