There is growing evidence that macroautophagic cargo is not limited to bulk 
cytosol in response to starvation and can occur selectively for substrates, 
including aggregated proteins. It remains unclear, however, whether 
starvation-induced and selective macroautophagy share identical adaptor 
molecules to capture their cargo. Here, we report that Alfy, a 
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding protein, is central to the selective 
elimination of aggregated proteins. We report that the loss of Alfy inhibits the 
clearance of inclusions, with little to no effect on the starvation response. 
Alfy is recruited to intracellular inclusions and scaffolds a complex between 
p62(SQSTM1)-positive proteins and the autophagic effectors Atg5, Atg12, Atg16L, 
and LC3. Alfy overexpression leads to elimination of aggregates in an 
Atg5-dependent manner and, likewise, to protection in a neuronal and Drosophila 
model of polyglutamine toxicity. We propose that Alfy plays a key role in 
selective macroautophagy by bridging cargo to the molecular machinery that 
builds autophagosomes.

Abstract

There is growing evidence that macroautophagic cargo is not limited to bulk cytosol in response to starvation, and can occur selectively for substrates including aggregated proteins. It remains unclear, however, if starvation-induced and selective macroautophagy share identical adapter molecules to capture their cargo. Here we report that Alfy, a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binding protein, is central to the selective elimination of aggregated proteins. We report that the loss of Alfy inhibits the clearance of inclusions, with little to no effect on the starvation response. Alfy is recruited to intracellular inclusions and scaffolds a complex between p62(SQSTM1)-positive proteins and the autophagic effectors Atg5, Atg12, Atg16L and LC3. Alfy overexpression leads to elimination of aggregates in an Atg5-dependent manner, and likewise, to protection in a neuronal and Drosophila model of polyglutamine toxicity. We propose that Alfy plays a key role in selective macroautophagy, by bridging cargo to the molecular machinery that builds autophagosomes.

Introduction

The fundamental ability of a cell to function is tightly linked to its capacity for protein synthesis. Equally important is the cell's ability to eliminate proteins that are deemed no longer necessary or misfolded. In light of this, it is unsurprising that a common cytopathological feature of disease is the presence of intracellular inclusions. The pathological significance of aggregated proteins has been of particular interest in the area of neurodegeneration, as symptomatic reversal in mouse models of spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) and Huntington's disease (HD) tightly correlates with the clearance of accumulated protein ( Yamamoto et al., 2000 ; Zu et al., 2004 ).

Cytosolic proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosome systems. Over the last several years, the latter has been brought to the forefront with macroautophagy- a process through which cytosolic constituents are taken up into a multimembranous structure known as the autophagosome, which upon fusion to endosomal ( Berg et al., 1998 ; Filimonenko et al., 2007 ; Kochl et al., 2006 ) and lysosomal structures permits degradation ( Klionsky, 2005 ). Predominantly known to nonspecifically engulf and degrade cytosol and long-lived proteins (LLP) in response to nutrient deprivation or inhibition of the kinase mTOR, macroautophagy also permits elimination of organelles such as mitochondria ( Kanki et al., 2009 ; Klionsky, 2005 ; Okamoto et al., 2009 ). Recently, macroautophagy has been implicated in the elimination of aggregated proteins across various cell types including neurons ( Boland and Nixon, 2006 ; Iwata et al., 2005b ; Ravikumar et al., 2002 ; Yamamoto et al., 2006 ). These proteins are often polyubiquitinated and can be recognized by the ubiquitin- and LC3-binding proteins p62 and NBR1( Bjorkoy et al., 2005 ; Kirkin et al., 2009 ).

Alfy (Autophagy linked FYVE protein) is a 400kDa protein that contains a BEACH domain, WD-40 domain and a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) binding FYVE domain ( Simonsen et al., 2004 ). We have previously shown that it is recruited to ubiquitin-positive protein inclusions under stress conditions ( Simonsen et al., 2004 ). Although mammalian studies of Alfy have been limited, Drosophila lacking the Alfy homologue Blue Cheese ( bchs ) are adult viable, but have a reduced lifespan due to an accelerated accumulation of ubiquitin-positive inclusions and neuronal degeneration ( Finley et al., 2003 ). In this study we demonstrate that aggregated proteins are sequestered into autophagic vesicles, and present evidence that Alfy is essential for their macroautophagic clearance. Despite, however, its role in selective autophagy, Alfy is not required for macroautophagy due to nutrient deprivation. Alfy co-localizes and interacts with p62 and NBR1 positive proteins, and directly interacts with Atg5. This interaction permits the creation of a greater complex with Atg12, Atg16L, and LC3, suggesting that Alfy acts as a scaffold that bridges its cargo to the macroautophagic machinery. Finally, we find that Alfy overexpression can decrease aggregated polyglutamine protein levels, and protect cells from expanded polyglutamine toxicity both a primary neuronal HD model and a Drosophila eye model of polyglutamine disease.

DISCUSSION

In this study we have found that Alfy is required for the macroautophagic elimination of aggregated proteins, but not for macroautophagic elimination of bulk cytosol in response to starvation. We propose that Alfy functions as a scaffold which brings together the E3-like ligase, Atg5-Atg12-Atg16L and LC3 to the target substrate to permit the degradation of expanded polyglutamine proteins in different cell types, including neurons. Finally, we have found that its overexpression can enhance the elimination of toxic polyglutamine proteins in a primary neuronal model, and permit protection in a Drosophila eye model of polyQ toxicity.

The role of the lysosome and its capacity to eliminate aggregated proteins of expanded polyQ proteins has been explored extensively ( Iwata et al., 2005a ; Ravikumar et al., 2002 ; Yamamoto et al., 2006 ). It has remained a question, however, how they are targeted to the autophagosome for degradation. Our findings demonstrate that Alfy plays an important role in this process, and we suggest the following model ( Figure 7 ): As the polyQ protein is expressed and accumulates, it evolves from oligomers to increasingly larger aggregates to inclusions. The polyubiquitinated forms of the accumulating mutant protein are recognized by p62, which may aid aggregate-growth via self-polymerization of its PB1 domain ( Bjorkoy et al., 2005 ), together with previously implicated microtubule- and HDAC6-dependent mechanisms ( Iwata et al., 2005b ; Johnston et al., 1998 ; Kawaguchi et al., 2003 ). Meanwhile, in the presence of aggregation-prone proteins, Alfy is transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it may interact with PI3P-containing membranes through its FYVE domain ( Simonsen et al, 2004 ) and Atg5-Atg12 through its WD-40 domain. Although drawn as a vesicle, the membrane source for the autophagosome is still unclear, although the ER( Axe et al., 2008 ; Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009 ; Yla-Anttila et al., 2009 ) has been implicated. Once at the membrane, Atg5-Atg12 can interact with Atg16L ( Fujita et al., 2008 ; Mizushima et al., 2003 ). Alfy also interacts with aggregated polyQ proteins most likely through its interaction with p62 (Høyevarde et al, 2010). In this manner, we speculate that Alfy brings a membrane source and Atg5-Atg12-Atg16L to the inclusion, so that they can act as part of a greater E3 ligase-like complex for LC3 ( Hanada et al., 2007 ). The presence of p62 may stabilize the lipid bound LC3, thus permitting the autophagosome to build directly around the inclusion. Although giant (diameter > 1um) inclusions were not found frequently in double membrane structures by immuno-EM, the large inclusions contained were much larger than the usual 100nm size AVs. Clearly further in vitro and in vivo experiments must be performed to test this model directly.

This selective sorting of cargo in macroautophagy is reminiscent of protein trafficking, from endocytosis to secretion, for which particular cargo are directed to unique trafficking fates. Recently in yeast, Atg32 has been shown to confer selectivity during mitophagy( Kanki et al., 2009 ; Okamoto et al., 2009 ). In mammalian systems, several proteins that link the autophagic machinery to its substrates have been identified. Termed `autophagy receptors', they are involved in degradation of ubiquitinated bacteria (NDP52) ( Thurston et al., 2009 ), mitochondria (NIX)( Novak et al., ; Sandoval et al., 2008 ), as well as protein aggregates (p62 and NBR1)( Kirkin et al., 2009 ; Pankiv et al., 2007 ). All proteins contain an LIR and substrate recognition domain. Since Alfy interacts with p62 (Høyevarde et al, 2010), it will be interesting to determine how Alfy influences the degradation of other autophagy receptor proteins and their cargo.

Our findings indicate that an innate cellular process to package protein aggregates into autophagic vacuoles exists in mammalian cells. Several results echo the Cvt (cytosol to vacuole targeting) pathway in yeast ( Nair and Klionsky, 2005 ). Our ultrastructural studies show that relatively large aggregated structures can be found sequestered in double membrane vesicles, devoid of bulk cytosol. Further, the clearance of aggregated proteins clearly requires the macroautophagic machinery, but like Cvt, also requires additional unique factors to acts as a scaffold between the cargo aggregate and the membrane building machinery. Aggregation of the cargo may therefore be one of the first steps towards degradation, and hence inhibition thereof may confer toxicity, since the protein can no longer be eliminated. This may explain studies indicating the `protective' nature of inclusions in neurons( Arrasate et al., 2004 ; Taylor et al., 2003 ). Nonetheless, if indeed a Cvt-like process exists, why is there a prevalence of protein accumulation in human disease? Do levels of Alfy relate to the susceptibility to protein aggregation? We have previously shown that Alfy is ubiquitously expressed in mouse tissue, with highest levels found in brain ( Simonsen et al., 2004 ). In Drosophila , expression level of the Alfy homologue bchs is highest in neurons. Alfy/bchs may be especially important in non-dividing cells which require `more help' to clear aggregate-prone or aggregated proteins to prevent accumulation of protein aggregates. Consistent with this are previously published studies demonstrating that loss of Bchs leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in fly neurons ( Finley et al., 2003 ). Our complimentary experiment using overexpression of Alfy in neurons shows that increased levels of Alfy or its C-terminus permits clearance ( Figure 6 , S7A ), suggesting that Alfy may be rate limiting to the degradation of aggregated proteins. This may be linked to the prospect that Alfy can corral key members of the macroautophagy machinery, and thus its constitutive presence may limit the starvation response, leading to cell death. The nuclear localization of Alfy may limit its bioavailability, to avoid this possibility. This hypothesis and how cellular stress permits Alfy to exit the nucleus is under current investigation.
