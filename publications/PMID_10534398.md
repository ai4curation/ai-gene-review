Although most retroposons that arose by reverse transcription of cellular mRNAs 
and by reintegration into the genome are nonfunctional, several examples exist 
in which the retroposon acquired a novel function and became fixed in the genome 
as a functional gene. We identified another such case: the ubiquitously 
expressed X-linked XAP-5 gene with unknown function gave rise to its retroposed 
counterpart, XAP-5-like (X5L), which has an intronless open reading frame and is 
autosomal in human. Phylogenetic analysis of the human and mouse XAP-5 and X5L 
genes shows that the retroposition most likely took place before the radiation 
of eutherian mammals. The XAP-5 and X5L genes are expressed in a wide range of 
tissues but are differentially expressed in testis. The ancient origin and broad 
expression of the X5L retroposon indicate that the XAP-5 and X5L genes may have 
assumed different functions in somatic cells. In addition to this, because of 
its autosomal location and its high level and particular pattern of expression 
in spermatogenic cells, the X5L expression in testis may compensate for the 
X-linked XAP-5 gene, which may be silenced during spermatogenesis.
