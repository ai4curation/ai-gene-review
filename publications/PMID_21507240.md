BACKGROUND: Glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDA) is one of the major human bile salts. 
Bile salts stimulate cell survival and proliferation through the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase, but the downstream signaling mechanism(s) 
remains enigmatic. Mcl-1 is an antiapoptotic molecule of the Bcl2 family that is 
extensively overexpressed in tumor tissues of patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC).
RESULTS: Here we found that exposure of HepG2 cells to GCDA results in 
activation of ERK1 and ERK2 and phosphorylation of Mcl-1 in a PD98059 (MEK 
inhibitor)-sensitive manner. GCDA stimulates Mcl-1 phosphorylation in cells 
expressing WT but not T163A Mcl-1 mutant, indicating that GCDA-induced Mcl-1 
phosphorylation occurs exclusively at the T163 site in its PEST region. 
GCDA-induced Mcl-1 phosphorylation at T163 enhances the half-life of Mcl-1. 
Treatment of HepG2 cells with GCDA facilitates Mcl-1 dissociation from Mule (a 
physiological Mcl-1 ubiquitin E3 ligase). Specific depletion of Mcl-1 from HepG2 
cells by RNA interference increases sensitivity of HepG2 cells to 
chemotherapeutic drugs (i.e. cisplatin and irinotecan). In addition to 
activation of the ERK/Mcl-1 survival pathway, GCDA can also induce 
dose-dependent apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites of DNA lesions, which may 
partially neutralize its survival activity.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that bile salt may function as a survival 
agonist and/or potential carcinogen in the development of HCC. Molecular 
approaches that inactivate Mcl-1 by blocking its T163 phosphorylation may 
represent new strategies for treatment of HCC.
