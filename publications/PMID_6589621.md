Isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone for human ferritin heavy chain.

Boyd D, Jain SK, Crampton J, Barrett KJ, Drysdale J.

Ferritin, the main iron-storage protein, is composed of two partially homologous 
subunits, heavy (H) and light (L), with MrS of 21,000 and 19,000, respectively. 
We have isolated a cDNA clone for human ferritin H chains by screening a human 
lymphocyte cDNA library with synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides. The 
oligonucleotide sequences were derived from two pentapeptides found in human 
spleen ferritin. The selected clone hybridized to both probes and selected 
H-chain mRNA, but not L-chain mRNA, when hybridized to HeLa cell mRNA. These 
results indicate that the cloned DNA codes for a H chain of human ferritin. 
Since the amino acid sequence derived from the cloned DNA was almost identical 
to the partial amino acid sequence of a minor component found in human spleen 
ferritin, we conclude that the minor sequence found in human spleen ferritin 
must be a H subunit. Genomic analysis gives a complex pattern that suggests that 
ferritin H chains are encoded by a multigene family or have an unusually large 
number of exons.
