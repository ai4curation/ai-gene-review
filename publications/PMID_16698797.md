A defect of protein O-mannosylation causes congenital muscular dystrophy with 
brain malformation and structural eye abnormalities, so-called Walker-Warburg 
syndrome. Protein O-mannosylation is catalyzed by protein O-mannosyltransferase 
1 (POMT1) and its homologue, POMT2. Coexpression of POMT1 and POMT2 is required 
to show O-mannosylation activity. Here we have shown that POMT1 forms a complex 
with POMT2 and the complex possesses protein O-mannosyltransferase activity. 
Results indicate that POMT1 and POMT2 associate physically and functionally in 
vivo. Recently, three mutations were reported in the POMT1 gene of patients who 
showed milder phenotypes than typical Walker-Warburg syndrome. We coexpressed 
these mutant POMT1s with POMT2 and found that none of them had any activity. 
However, all POMT1 mutants, including previously identified POMT1 mutants, 
coprecipitated with POMT2. These results indicate that the mutant POMT1s could 
form heterocomplexes with POMT2 but that such complexes are insufficient for 
enzymatic activity.
