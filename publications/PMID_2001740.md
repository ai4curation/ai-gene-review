Incubation of isolated rat liver nuclei with ATP, NAD+, and micromolar Ca2+ 
concentrations of various metal ions resulted in extensive DNA hydrolysis. 
Half-maximal activity occurred with 1.0 microM Ca2+ added, and saturation of the 
process was observed with 10 microM Ca2+. The Ca2+ (10 microM)-activated DNA 
fragmentation was inhibited by the presence of Ca2(+)-binding protein regucalcin 
isolated from rat liver cytosol. The inhibitory effect of regucalcin was 
complete at 0.5 microM. At 25 microM Ca2+ added, such an effect of regucalcin 
(1.0 microM) was not seen. Regucalcin also inhibited Ca2(+)-activated DNA 
fragmentation in the presence of calmodulin (10 and 20 micrograms). The results 
show that regucalcin can inhibit the Ca2(+)-activated DNA fragmentation due to 
binding the metal, suggesting a role in regulation of liver nuclear functions.

Abstract

Regucalcin, which its gene is located on the X chromosome, plays a multifunctional role as a suppressor protein in cell signal transduction in various types of cells and tissues. The suppression of regucalcin gene expression has been shown to involve in carcinogenesis. Regucalcin gene expression was uniquely downregulated in carcinogenesis of rat liver in vivo, although the expression of other many genes was upregulated, indicating that endogenous regucalcin plays a suppressive role in the development of hepatocarcinogenesis. Overexpression of endogenous regucalcin was found to suppress proliferation of rat cloned hepatoma cells in vitro. Moreover, the regucalcin gene and its protein levels were demonstrated specifically to downregulate in human hepatocellular carcinoma by analysis with multiple gene expression profiles and proteomics. Regucalcin gene expression was also found to suppress in human tumor tissues including kidney, lung, brain, breast and prostate, suggesting that repressed regucalcin gene expression leads to the development of carcinogenesis in various tissues. Regucalcin may play a role as a suppressor protein in carcinogenesis. Overexpression of endogenous regucalcin is suggested to reveal preventive and therapeutic effects on carcinogenesis. Delivery of the regucalcin gene may be a novel useful tool in the gene therapy of carcinogenesis. This review will discuss regarding to an involvement of regucalcin as a suppressor protein in human carcinogenesis in insight into the gene therapy.

Introduction

Regucalcin plays a pivotal role as a suppressor protein in various signal transductions to maintain cell homeostasis for stimuli in various types of cells and tissues (reviewed in Yamaguchi 2005 , 2011a ). The regucalcin gene is located on the X chromosome, and its organization consists of seven exons and six introns (Shimokawa et al. 1995 ). Regucalcin and its gene (gene symbol; rgn ) are identified in over 15 species consisting of regucalcin family in vertebrate and invertebrate species (Yamaguchi 2011b ). Regucalcin is expressed in various types of cells and tissues, although its expression is predominant in the liver and kidney (Yamaguchi 2005 , 2011a ). Regucalcin gene expression is regulated through various transcription factors (including AP-1, NF1-A1, RGPR-p117, β-catenin, SP1 and others), which are identified as the enhancer and suppressor, and this expression is regulated by hormonal stimulation and physiological state (Yamaguchi 2010 , 2013a ).

Regucalcin plays a pivotal role as a suppressor protein in signal transductions to maintain cell homeostasis for stimuli in various type cells (Yamaguchi 2005 , 2011a ). Regucalcin, which is localized in the nucleus, inhibits nuclear Ca 2+ -dependent and nuclear Ca 2+ -independent protein kinases and protein phosphatases, Ca 2+ -activated endonuclease and DNA and RNA synthesis (Yamaguchi 2005 , 2011a , 2013a ). Regucalcin plays a role as a suppressor protein in cell proliferation that is mediated through various signaling pathways in normal cells and hepatoma cells (Yamaguchi 2013b ). Regucalcin causes G1 and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in normal and cancer cells (Yamaguchi 2013b ). Overexpression of endogenous regucalcin regulates the gene expression of various proteins that are related to cell proliferation (Yamaguchi 2013b ). Suppressive effects of regucalcin on cell proliferation are not dependent on apoptosis; regucalcin prevents apoptosis that is mediated through multisignaling pathways (Yamaguchi 2013c ).

There is growing evidence that regucalcin is involved in human carcinogenesis. Regucalcin plays a regulatory role in the suppression of cell proliferation, depression of oncogene expression and stimulation of tumor suppressor gene expression in hepatoma cells (Yamaguchi 2013a , b ). Moreover, the regucalcin gene and protein expressions have been demonstrated to specifically downregulate in human carcinoma by analysis with multiple gene expression profiles and proteomics (Suzuki et al. 2004 ; Fernando et al. 2013 ; Graveel et al. 2001 ; Choia et al. 2004 ; Blanc et al. 2005 ; Roy et al. 2010 ; Schröder et al. 2011 ). Suppressed regucalcin gene expression is proposed to lead to carcinogenesis. Regucalcin may play a role as a key molecule as a suppressor protein in cell proliferation and carcinogenesis. Overexpression of regucalcin may reveal preventive and therapeutic effects on carcinogenesis in vivo. This review will discuss concerning an involvement of regucalcin as a suppressor in human carcinogenesis.
