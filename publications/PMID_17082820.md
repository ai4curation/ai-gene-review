Defects in protein folding and the proteasomal pathway have been linked with 
many neurodegenerative diseases. PLIC-1 (protein linking IAP to the 
cytoskeleton) is a ubiquitin-like protein that binds to the 
ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) of the proteasomal subunit S5a. Here, we show 
that PLIC-1 also binds to the UIM proteins ataxin 3--a deubiquitinating 
enzyme--HSJ1a--a co-chaperone--and EPS15 (epidermal growth factor substrate 
15)--an endocytic protein. Using a polyglutamine (polyQ) disease model, we found 
that both endogenous PLIC-1 and EPS15 localize to perinuclear aggresomes, and 
that polyQ enhances their in vivo interaction. We show that knockdown of PLIC-1 
and EPS15 by RNA interference reduces aggresome formation. In addition, 
PLIC-1(DeltaUBL) functions as a dominant-negative mutant, blocking both polyQ 
transport to aggresomes and the association of EPS15 with dispersed aggregates. 
We also show that PLIC-1 is upregulated by arsenite-induced protein misfolding. 
These results indicate a role for PLIC-1 in the protein aggregation-stress 
pathway, and we propose a novel function for the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain--by 
means of UBL-UIM interactions--in transport to aggresomes.
