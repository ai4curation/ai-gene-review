Bv8, a protein from skin secretions of Bombina variegata, reacts with receptors 
present in mammalian brain and intestine (Mollay et al. (1999) Eur. J. 
Pharmacol. 374, 189-196). As deduced from cloned cDNAs, the murine and human Bv8 
homologues have identical amino-terminal sequences and also contain 10 
cysteines. From mouse testes, two forms of Bv8 mRNA have been characterized, of 
which one contains an additional exon which codes for 21 mostly basic amino 
acids. The mouse Bv8 gene is most active in mid-late pachytene spermatocytes. In 
mouse testes, Bv8 mRNA can first be detected at the end of the second week post 
partum.
