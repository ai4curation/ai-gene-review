Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common inherited disease in which affected 
children exhibit abnormalities in astrocyte growth regulation and are prone to 
the development of brain tumors (astrocytoma). Previous studies from our 
laboratory demonstrated that Nf1 mutant mouse astrocytomas contains populations 
of proliferating nestin+ progenitor cells, suggesting that immature astroglial 
progenitors may serve as a reservoir of proliferating tumor cells. Here, we 
directly examined the consequences of Nf1 inactivation on neural stem cell (NSC) 
proliferation in vitro and in vivo. We found dose-dependent effects of 
neurofibromin expression on NSC proliferation and survival in vitro, which 
reflected increased RAS pathway activation and increased bcl2 expression. In 
addition, unlike wild-type NSCs, Nf1-/- NSCs and, to a lesser extent, Nf1+/- 
NSCs survive as xenografts in naive recipient brains in vivo. Although Nf1-/- 
NSCs are multipotent, Nf1-/- and Nf1+/-, but not wild-type, NSCs generated 
increased numbers of morphologically abnormal, immature astroglial cells in 
vitro. Moreover, the Nf1-/- NSC growth and survival advantage as well as the 
astroglial cell differentiation defect were completely rescued by expression of 
the GAP (RAS-GTPase activating protein) domain of neurofibromin. Finally, the 
increase in astroglial progenitors and proliferating cells seen in vitro was 
also observed in Nf1-/- and Nf1+/- embryonic as well as Nf1+/- adult brains in 
vivo. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that alterations in 
neurofibromin expression in the developing brain have significant consequences 
for astrocyte growth and differentiation relevant to normal brain development 
and astrocytoma formation in children.
