Richard Feynman postulated in 1948 that the path of an electron can be best 
described by the sum or functional integral of all possible trajectories rather 
than by the notion of a single, unique trajectory. As a consequence, the 
position of an electron does not harbor any information about the paths that 
contributed to this position. This observation constitutes a classical endpoint 
observation. The endpoint assay is the desired type of experiment for 
high-throughput screening applications, mainly because of limitations in data 
acquisition and handling. Quite contrary to electrons, it is possible to extract 
information about the path of a protein using endpoint assays, and these types 
of applications are reviewed in this article.
