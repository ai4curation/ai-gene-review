A prominent response during the Drosophila host defence is the induction of 
proteolytic cascades, some of which lead to localized melanization of pathogen 
surfaces, while others activate one of the major players in the systemic 
antimicrobial response, the Toll pathway. Despite the fact that gain-of-function 
mutations in the Toll receptor gene result in melanization, a clear link between 
Toll activation and the melanization reaction has not been firmly established.

with activation of the Toll pathway in the Drosophila host defence. The 
melanization reaction requires Toll pathway activation and depends on the 
removal of the Drosophila serine protease inhibitor Serpin27A. Flies deficient 
for this serpin exhibit spontaneous melanization in larvae and adults. Microbial

Abstract

A prominent response during the Drosophila host defence is the induction of proteolytic cascades, some of which lead to localized melanization of pathogen surfaces, while others activate one of the major players in the systemic antimicrobial response, the Toll pathway. Despite the fact that gain-of-function mutations in the Toll receptor gene result in melanization, a clear link between Toll activation and the melanization reaction has not been firmly established. Here, we present evidence for the coordination of hemolymph-borne melanization with activation of the Toll pathway in the Drosophila host defence. The melanization reaction requires Toll pathway activation and depends on the removal of the Drosophila serine protease inhibitor Serpin27A. Flies deficient for this serpin exhibit spontaneous melanization in larvae and adults. Microbial challenge induces its removal from the hemolymph through Toll-dependent transcription of an acute phase immune reaction component.

Introduction

Insects are particularly resistant to invading microorganisms. In response to microbial infection, they mount a multitude of defence reactions that include synthesis of potent antimicrobial peptides by the fat body (systemic antimicrobial response), phagocytosis by macrophage-like blood cells and activation of protease cascades leading to localized melanization and coagulation (reviewed in Hoffmann and Reichhart, 2002 ). Genetic studies have shown that antimicrobial responses against fungi and Gram-positive bacteria are regulated by the transmembrane receptor protein Toll, and several additional genes of the dorsoventral regulatory cassette of Drosophila ( Lemaitre et al., 1996 ), whereas resistance to Gram-negative bacteria depends on the imd gene (for immune deficiency). This gene has since been shown to act upstream of a regulatory pathway independent of Toll (reviewed in Hoffmann and Reichhart, 2002 ). Gain-of-function mutations in the Toll receptor gene result in spontaneous melanization ( Gerttula et al., 1988 ; Lemaitre et al., 1995 ; Govind 1996 ; Qui et al., 1998 ). It has been hypothesized for some time that a link exists between the challenge-dependent proteolytic cascades leading to melanization and the systemic Toll-mediated antimicrobial response ( Lemaitre et al., 1995 ; Govind, 1996 ). However, the molecular and genetic basis of this putative link has remained elusive so far.

The infection-dependent melanization reaction requires the activation of phenoloxidase (PO), which is an oxidoreductase that catalyzes the conversion of phenols to quinones. The quinones may be directly toxic to bacteria, fungi and eucaryotic parasites, and can also polymerize to form melanotic capsules that surround parasites ( Pye, 1974 ; Nappi and Vass, 1993 ; Nappi et al., 1995 ; for a review, see Ashida and Brey, 1997 ). PO is present as an inactive precursor prophenoloxydase (PPO) that must be proteolytically activated by a serine protease (for a review, see Ashida and Brey, 1997 ). This protease, which is the terminal component of a proteolytic cascade, has been identified in several insect species and has been called prophenoloxydase-activating enzyme (PPAE) ( Ashida and Brey, 1995 ; Chosa et al., 1997 ; Jiang et al., 1998 ). Biochemical studies in crustaceans by Söderhäll and co-workers (for a review, see Söderhäll and Cerenius, 1998 ) and in the silkworm Bombyx mori by Ashida and collaborators (for a review, see Ashida and Brey, 1997 ) have established that this protease cascade can be initiated upon recognition of foreign material. In arthropods, the presence of serine protease inhibitors regulates this process by preventing excessive activation ( Ashida and Sasaki, 1994 ; Jiang and Kanost, 1997 ; Park et al., 2000 ; for a review, see Jiang and Kanost, 2000 ).

In this study, we show that the blood serine protease inhibitor Spn27A controls melanization in Drosophila . Absence of this serpin in the hemolymph leads to a high rate of spontaneous melanization both in larvae and in adults and a constitutively elevated PO activity. In wild-type adult flies, we find that Spn27A is depleted from the hemolymph during the melanization process. Moreover, this depletion is infection-dependent and controlled by the Toll pathway. In Toll pathway mutants, serpin depletion and PO activation are blocked. Elimination of the serpin during melanization is most probably dependent on a protease. Infection-dependent secretion of this protease or of the factor that triggers its activation in the hemolymph is in need of NF-κB-mediated transcription and requires de novo protein synthesis. These results present the first genetic link between melanization and Toll pathway activation.

Discussion

In this study, we present evidence for the in vivo regulation of the melanization reaction and its activation through the Toll pathway, one of the major players of the antimicrobial host defence of Drosophila ( Lemaitre et al., 1996 ). We show that Toll pathway mutants do not exhibit PO induction following bacterial challenge. In wild-type flies, PO activity reaches its maximum 3 h post-infection and decreases significantly at 17 h following immune challenge. Most of the larvae and a significant number of adults (see Table I ) deficient for the serpin Spn27A show spontaneous melanization and increased PO activity. Our results further indicate that this circulating serpin disappears from the hemolymph 3 h following bacterial challenge and re-emerges at 17 h post-infection. This time window correlates with PO activation kinetics. Moreover, overexpression of Spn27A in fat body cells of adults prevents PO activation by immune challenge. Serpin depletion (as PO activation) relies on the Toll pathway, as in mutants of this pathway Spn27A is not removed from the hemolymph. Finally, we show that serpin depletion requires de novo protein synthesis, since infection in the presence of an inhibitor of translation (cycloheximide) does not result in its removal. We observed that among the serpin-deficient flies, only those with melanotic tumors showed a constitutive expression of the antimicrobial peptide genes drosomycin and diptericin . We do not yet have a clear explanation for their expression, which is dependent on Toll and Imd respectively. We believe that this could be an indirect effect of the presence of the melanotic capsules in the body cavity. It is relevant to note here that other mutations, which are not specifically linked to the immune response but result in melanotic tumors, activate antimicrobial peptide gene expression in the absence of an overt microbial infection ( Manfruelli and Mathey-Prevot, 2002 ). An alternative model could be that Spn27A blocks both the Imd and Toll pathways and these pathways would be constitutively activated in flies deficient for the serpin. Although equally interesting, this possibility does not seem to be the case. If Spn27A negatively controlled these pathways, then all the serpin-deficient flies, and not only those with melanotic tumors, would exhibit expression of the peptides. Conversely, overexpression of the serpin would inhibit antimicrobial peptide induction following microbial challenge. Finally, bacterial infection of flies overexpressing the serpin (through a UAS-Spn27A transgene) results in expression of peptides at wild-type levels (P.Ligoxygakis, unpublished observations).

A surprising implication of our results is that at least one component of the melanization cascade is controlled by the Toll pathway and has to be synthesized de novo after infection. Two pieces of evidence support this hypothesis: (i) in a loss of function allele of Dif ( Dif 1 ), which encodes a protein able to translocate to the nucleus but unable to bind DNA ( Rutschmann et al., 2000a ), depletion of serpin27A and concomitant PO activation did not take place after bacterial challenge, and (ii) in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, Spn27A was not removed. Since the sequence found in the hinge region of serpin27A suggests that it is an active serine protease inhibitor ( Irving et al., 2000 ), we propose that Spn27A is removed by its target protease, forming a covalent complex. Such complexes have a half-life of a few minutes and are rapidly cleared from the hemolymph, which could explain in a simple manner the observed depletion.

The model that we believe accommodates our data best is illustrated in Figure 5 . In non-infection condi tions, Spn27A inhibits PPAE and blocks melanization (Figure 5 A). Circulating pathogen recognition receptors sense the bacterial infection and signal to the Toll pathway. Intracellular transduction of the signal is mediated by the Rel transcription factor DIF ( Rutschmann et al., 2000a ), which initiates an acute phase transcription. This leads to de novo production of a further amount of PPAE, which induces PO cleavage and targets Spn27A for removal. Alternatively, Toll activation could lead to the production of serine protease homologs that are co-factors of PPAE, as demonstrated in a beetle ( Kwon et al., 2000 ), or a modifying enzyme that triggers the cascade (like the Drosophila pipe gene; Sen et al., 1998 ; Figure 5 B). Reappearance of the serpin in the hemolymph should inhibit any further melanization-associated proteolytic action (Figure 5 C). We did not address the question whether this reappearance is a consequence of transcription. Nevertheless, DNA microarray data show that the Spn27A transcription level is strongly elevated after septic injury ( De Gregorio et al., 2001 , 2002a ; P.Irving, personal communication). Finally, the fact that in the spn27A ; spz double mutant spontaneous melanization is not suppressed evokes the possibility that the Toll pathway is activating a protease dedicated to the removal of Spn27A without taking part in the actual melanization cascade. Given that Spn27A has been shown to inhibit biochemically a PPAE of another insect ( De Gregorio et al., 2002b ) and that in turn Drosophila PPAEs are rapidly upregulated following infection ( De Gregorio et al., 2001 , 2002a ; Irving et al., 2001 ), we favor the simpler scenario depicted in Figure 5 . Analysis of an XP element insertion in a putative PPAE gene (N.Pelte and J.-M.Reichhart, unpublished data) will probably help to clarify the matter.

Although a large body of evidence addressing the putative role of melanization in host defence has been available for some time, this is the first genetic study that establishes a link between melanization and the activation of a major mediator of antimicrobial responses, namely the Toll pathway in Drosophila . Our data point to the requirement of Toll-dependent de novo protein synthesis for the depletion of Spn27A and the subsequent activation of melanization. Further analysis is needed to identify the components that are synthesized and released into the hemolymph to trigger melanization. In a recent study, mutations in the serine protease persephone were found to suppress the loss-of-function phenotype of the serpin necrotic ( Ligoxygakis et al., 2002 ). This study sets the stage for a similar suppressor screen on the melanization phenotype caused by the deficit of Spn27A in adult flies.
