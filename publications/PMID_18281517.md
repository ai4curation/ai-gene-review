3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM) is a stable condensation product of 
indole-3-carbanol, a potential breast cancer chemoprevention agent. Human breast 
cancer cell lines were studied to better understand its mechanisms. In vitro 
experiments were done in MCF-7, T47D, BT-20 and BT-474 cells using MTT, ELISA, 
immunoblotting assays, reverse transcription-PCR, protein half-life, confocal 
microscopy, cell fractionation, and immunoprecipitation assays. We found that 
DIM inhibited the growth of all four breast cancer cell lines (IC(50)s, 25-56 
micromol/L). Because BT-20 and BT-474 overexpressed Her-2 and activated Akt, and 
BT-20 lacks estrogen receptor, these were studied further. In both cell lines, 
DIM appeared to induce expression of p27(kip) protein before the loss of cell 
viability and apoptosis. In BT-20 cells, DIM also inhibited expression of 
activated Akt, but this appeared after p27(kip) induction. In both cell lines, 
DIM induced p27(kip) transcript expression within 6 h. DIM prolonged the 
p27(kip) protein half-life in BT-20 but not BT-474 cells. We also showed, for 
the first time, that DIM induced nuclear localization of p27(kip) in both cell 
lines. Moreover, in BT-20 cells, DIM induced a decrease in p27(kip) 
phosphorylation at Thr(187), and its association with the 14-3-3 protein, which 
helped to explain the protein half-life increase and nuclear localization, 
respectively. DIM modulates p27(kip) through transcription, prolongation of 
protein half-life, and nuclear localization. These effects appear to be 
independent of Her-2, Akt, or estrogen receptor status and should support 
further study for its chemoprevention potential in breast cancer.
