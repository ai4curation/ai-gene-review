While all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia 
(APL) has been the paradigm of targeted therapy for oncogenic transcription 
factors, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown, and a significant 
number of patients still relapse and become ATRA resistant. We identified the 
histone demethylase PHF8 as a coactivator that is specifically recruited by RARα 
fusions to activate expression of their downstream targets upon ATRA treatment. 
Forced expression of PHF8 resensitizes ATRA-resistant APL cells, whereas its 
downregulation confers resistance. ATRA sensitivity depends on the enzymatic 
activity and phosphorylation status of PHF8, which can be pharmacologically 
manipulated to resurrect ATRA sensitivity to resistant cells. These findings 
provide important molecular insights into ATRA response and a promising avenue 
for overcoming ATRA resistance.
