INTRODUCTION

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a master regulator of cellular responses to genotoxic and other cellular stress signals that functions to maintain genomic integrity. In response to stress, p53 regulates the transcription of a number of specific target genes, such as CDKN1A (which encodes p21), BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CHEK1 , and CHEK2 , in order to control various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA repair, apoptosis, and autophagy ( 1 , 2 ). Several posttranslational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and neddylation) affect p53 protein stability, sequence-specific DNA binding properties, and transcriptional activity ( 3 ). Transcriptional coregulators also play an integral role in the signaling mechanisms by which transcription factors such as p53 elicit their physiological functions. They can either activate (coactivator) or repress (corepressor) gene transcription, at least in part by altering the acetylation of lysine residues in histone tails, thereby favoring an open or closed chromatin structure and thereby regulating the accessibility of DNA to the general transcriptional machinery. Among p53 coactivators, p300, CREB-binding protein (CBP), and CBP-associated factor (p/CAF) are well characterized for their histone acetyltransferase activity and ability to interact with and stimulate p53 transactivation functions ( 4 – 6 ). In contrast, corepressors such as mSin3a play a role in p53-mediated transcriptional repression, likely through p53 tethering a repressor complex containing histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to target genes ( 7 ). Moreover, as acetylation of p53 promotes its transcriptional activity ( 8 ), a number of HDACs (e.g., HDACs 1 to 4) can also downregulate p53-dependent gene expression by deacetylation of the p53 protein ( 9 ).

The silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT; also known as NCoR2) and its paralog, nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR), are transcriptional corepressors that are best characterized relative to their abilities to bind to unliganded or antagonist-bound nuclear receptors and repress their transcriptional activity ( 10 , 11 ). These large (∼270-kDa) proteins share a molecular architecture and an overall sequence identity of ∼36% ( 12 ). Nonetheless, each of them can also perform distinct functions in neurogenesis, development, and hormonal regulation pathways ( 13 – 15 ), and their repression activities can be regulated by distinct regulatory pathways ( 16 ). Moreover, deletion of either gene in knockout experiments is embryonically lethal, demonstrating that these corepressors cannot compensate for one another during development ( 11 ). While the repressive activity of SMRT resides largely within the N-terminal portion of the molecule, the interaction domains for binding to nuclear receptors, referred to as CoRNR box motifs, are located in the C terminus ( 11 , 17 ). In addition, the C-terminal and central regions of SMRT can interact with several other DNA binding transcription factors, including BCL6, ETO, NF-κB, and CBF1, and repress the expression of their target genes ( 18 ).

The inhibitory chromatin remodeling elicited by SMRT is mediated by its recruitment of deacetylases, particularly HDAC3, to SMRT-associated transcription factors and, hence, their target genes ( 11 , 19 ). In spite of a high degree of disordered structure ( 20 ), there are several well-structured regions within the N-terminal region of SMRT ( 11 ), including two highly conserved Swi3-Ada2-NCoR-TFIIIB (SANT)-like domains, as well as repression domain 1 (RD1). These regions provide binding sites for other components of the core SMRT repression complex, namely, HDAC3, G-protein suppressor 2 (GPS2), and the exchange factors TBL1/TBL1R, and consequently are critical for mediating SMRT's repressor activity ( 19 , 21 , 22 ). The RD1 domain of SMRT, TBL1, and GPS2 make contacts with each other, leading to the formation of a stable complex ( 20 , 22 ). These proteins, in turn, enable interaction of SMRT with HDAC3 through the first of the corepressor's two extended SANT domains, termed the deacetylase activation domain (DAD); the second mediates SMRT interactions with histones and is referred to as the histone interaction domain ( 23 ). Inositol tetraphosphate (IP4) binds to the DAD region of SMRT and is an important mediator of the corepressor's interaction with HDAC3 ( 24 ). Binding of SMRT to HDAC3 specifically activates the latent activity of the latter to form an enzymatically active deacetylase complex ( 23 ). Thus, SMRT molecules with mutations in the DAD or deletion of the DAD are unable to stimulate the deacetylase activity of HDAC3 ( 19 , 24 ). Moreover, in mice carrying point mutations in the DADs of SMRT and NCoR, HDAC3 activity was undetectable, despite normal expression of the HDAC3 protein, and there was an increase in nucleosomal histone acetylation and gene expression ( 25 ). Overall, these studies suggest that HDAC3 interaction with SMRT is indispensable for the repressive activity of this coregulator.

In addition to the established corepressor role of SMRT-HDAC3 complexes in the regulation of metabolism ( 26 ), evidence demonstrating a correlation between high levels of SMRT in breast cancer and a poor prognosis ( 27 , 28 ) suggested a potential role of this coregulator in breast tumorigenesis. Although the mechanism(s) by which this occurs remains undefined, depletion of SMRT expression reduced the proliferation of estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells ( 15 ). Unlike for other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, SMRT can promote estrogen-induced ERα transcriptional activity ( 15 ). Since estrogen and ERα signaling are important regulators in breast cancer, this raises the possibility that SMRT promotes breast tumorigenesis, at least in part through amplifying ERα target gene expression. Furthermore, overexpression of SMRT stimulated the intrinsic transcriptional activity of the oncogene steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3), itself an ERα coactivator and positive regulator of breast cancer cell proliferation, and together these coregulators cooperatively promoted estrogen-dependent expression of some but not all ERα target genes, including the cyclin D1 and progesterone receptor genes ( 29 – 31 ). Collectively, these candidate gene studies demonstrated that SMRT can coactivate ERα transcriptional activity in a gene-selective manner and indicated that SMRT has both coactivator and corepressor activities in breast cancer cells.

In order to obtain a more global perspective of the relative ability of SMRT to coactivate versus corepress gene expression, a microarray analysis of control and SMRT-depleted MCF-7 breast cancer cells was performed. Gene ontological analyses revealed an association between SMRT depletion in these cells and a decrease in the expression of genes involved in DNA damage responses. Interestingly, several of the genes identified in these analyses are targets of p53, suggesting a possible role for SMRT in the regulation of gene expression by this tumor suppressor protein, and we therefore investigated the role of SMRT in modulating p53 transcriptional activity and cellular responses to DNA damage. Silencing of SMRT expression in MCF-7 cells enhanced the DNA damage response, abrogated p53 transcriptional activity, and decreased the doxorubicin-dependent induction of the p53 target genes CDKN1A (which encodes p21), BRAC1 , CHEK1 , and RAD51 . SMRT directly interacted with p53 and was recruited to p53 binding sites in the CDKN1A gene promoter in response to genotoxic stress. Moreover, the minimal interaction region was mapped to the N-terminal region of SMRT that encompasses the DAD, the region essential for HDAC3 enzyme activation, and therefore reveals an HDAC3-independent role for SMRT as a coactivator of p53-dependent gene expression and promoter of DNA damage repair functions.

DISCUSSION

Maintenance of the genome is pivotal for protecting organisms against the harmful consequences of DNA damage, which, if not properly dealt with, can lead to genomic instability, cancer, and cell death ( 52 , 53 ). The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a critical role in preserving genomic integrity by mediating cellular responses to genotoxic insults through transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis, cellular senescence, and ageing ( 1 , 2 ). Consistent with this, the p53 gene is mutated in ∼50% of all cancers, making it the single most frequently inactivated gene in human cancers ( 54 , 55 ). Like other transcription factors, the function of p53 is affected by transcriptional coregulators, and given the importance of this regulator to genomic integrity, it is important to fully understand the molecular mechanisms by which p53 activity is modulated. Our study reveals that the nuclear receptor coregulator SMRT, which is best known for its ability to inhibit the transcriptional activity of many members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors through recruitment of HDAC3, directly binds to p53 and serves as a coactivator of its transcriptional activity. Cells depleted of SMRT expression exhibit abrogated p53 transcriptional activity, decreased doxorubicin induction of endogenous p53 target gene expression without alteration of p53 protein levels, and a compromised DNA damage response. Moreover, this is an HDAC3-independent effect of SMRT. Collectively, these data indicate a biological role for SMRT in mediating DNA damage responses through promotion of p53 transcriptional activity and suggest that SMRT, via p53, protects the genome from genotoxic insults that may contribute to carcinogenesis.

As a regulator of genomic integrity, a number of pathways exist to promote p53-dependent gene expression ( 3 , 56 ). Some of these are involved in modulating p53 posttranslational modifications (e.g., acetylation) that ultimately stabilize the protein, while other cellular factors (e.g., coactivators) interact with p53 at the regulatory regions of target genes and potentiate their expression. The identification of SMRT as a positive regulator of p53 transcriptional activity expands the cohort of transcription factors that can be coactivated by this coregulator. Although SMRT is widely recognized as a corepressor of type II nuclear receptors, such as for thyroid hormone and retinoic acid ( 11 ), previous work from our laboratory has established SMRT to be a cell type-specific coactivator of ERα ( 15 ), an estrogen-regulated member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Not all ERα target genes are positively regulated by SMRT, but for those coactivated by this regulator (e.g., cyclin D1, progesterone receptor), E2 treatment induces the recruitment of SMRT to gene regulatory regions and stimulates ERα transcriptional activity. At present, our data suggest that SMRT regulation of p53 is limited to coactivation, and thus, while it may be considered a dual coactivator/corepressor of ERα ( 15 ), the available information indicates only a coactivator role relative to p53 and, thus, adds SMRT to an expanding group of p53 coactivators including CBP/p300, pCAF, JMY, ADA3, and MAML1 ( 4 , 5 , 57 – 59 ). Interestingly, several proteins previously shown to stimulate p53 transcriptional activity, namely, the TATA box binding protein (TBP)-associated factors (TAFs), TAFII-32/70, and AMF1 (also known as GPS2), can also bind to SMRT ( 50 , 60 , 61 ). TAFII-32/70, which binds to the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53, promotes p53-mediated transcription ( 62 – 64 ), while GPS2 associates with p53 in vivo and in vitro and augments p53-dependent expression of genes such as the gene for p21, CDKN1A ( 50 ). By virtue of being able to bind to both p53 and SMRT, any of these proteins could potentially play a role in promoting SMRT-p53 interactions and stimulating p53 target gene expression.

In addition to activating gene expression, p53 can repress transcription directed from various viral and cellular promoters ( 2 , 43 ), with proteins such as mSin3a tethering p53 to a repressor complex containing HDAC1 ( 7 ). Other HDACs (e.g., HDACs 2, 3, and 4) can also modulate p53 function through its deacetylation and downregulation of p53-dependent gene activation ( 9 ). In contrast, our results demonstrate that silencing of HDAC3 expression increased the levels of doxorubicin-induced p21 mRNA, without altering p53 expression, indicating that a loss of gene repression rather than an increase in p53 protein was mediating the increase in p21 mRNA levels. The deacetylase activity of HDAC3 is dependent upon the activation achieved via association of this enzyme with either SMRT or NCoR ( 19 , 25 ), and based upon the depletion of NCoR but not SMRT to stimulate doxorubicin-induced expression of p21 mRNA, we propose a model in which NCoR and HDAC3 limit p53 transcriptional activity on target genes, such as CDKN1A . Thus, even though NCoR and SMRT are closely related paralogs that can repress the activity of many different transcription factors ( 11 , 20 ), these studies add p53 to the growing list of instances in which SMRT and NCoR perform distinct physiological functions ( 13 – 16 , 65 – 68 ).

The core SMRT corepressor complex encompasses a tetramer of the exchange factor TBL1 and/or TBLR1 and two molecules each of GPS2 and SMRT ( 19 , 21 , 22 , 69 , 70 ). Structural characterization experiments demonstrate that the N termini of GPS2 (aa 1 to 53) and TBL1 (aa 1 to 71) bind to the RD1 domain of SMRT in the region from aa 167 to 297 ( 22 ). Conversely, a distinct region of GPS2 (aa 103 to 250) mediates binding of this protein to the central DNA binding region of p53 (aa 161 to 333) ( 50 ), while the DAD of SMRT binds to the C terminus of p53. Collectively, the ability of SMRT (reported herein) and GPS2 ( 50 ) to bind to and coactivate p53 transcriptional activity, as well as the established ability of SMRT and GPS2 to bind to one another ( 22 ), all through nonoverlapping sites, suggests that SMRT and GPS2 can work together to stimulate p53 transcriptional activity. Indeed, our data demonstrating that silencing of SMRT, GPS2, or TBL1 leads to a significant decrease in doxorubicin-induced p53 transcriptional activity, as measured by the p21-Luc assay, are consistent with the hypothesis that these proteins function as a SMRT-GPS2-TBL1 complex to coactivate p53 transcriptional activity. However, SMRT is subject to extensive alternative splicing, leading to the generation of multiple forms of this coregulator ( 71 ). One such splice variant, SMRTβ, lacks aa 34 to 254 due to exclusion of exons 2 to 6 and therefore the GPS2 binding site and a portion of the TBL1 interaction domain ( 12 , 72 ). As SMRTβ retains the ability to coactivate p53 in p21-Luc transactivation assays, it appears that GPS2 is not required for SMRT stimulation of p53 function. However, this does not preclude the possibility that by promotion of SMRT-GPS2-p53 interactions, as well as through its apparent interactions with the p300 coregulator protein ( 50 ), GPS2 enhances SMRT coactivation of p53-dependent gene expression.

The essential role of the SMRT DAD region for recruitment and activation of HDAC3 activity was demonstrated in previous studies showing that mutations in the DAD or deletion of this domain affected HDAC3 interaction with SMRT and thus eliminated corepressor stimulation of HDAC3 activity ( 19 ). In addition, mice with point mutations in the DADs of SMRT and NCoR had no detectable HDAC3 activity, despite having normal levels of this deacetylase ( 25 ). Through a combination of coimmunoprecipitation and GST pulldown assays, the region of SMRT from aa 389 to 480 encompassing the DAD was found to be essential for p53 interaction with the N terminus of SMRT, although comparisons of the interactions between p53 and SMRT-NTΔ5-312 and SMRT-NTΔ5-254 suggested that the region of SMRT from aa 250 to 312, which is N terminal to the DAD and binds to TBL1, may be required to mediate the maximal interaction of p53 with SMRT. The former, necessary region (aa 389 to 480) aligns very closely to the region of SMRT from aa 395 to 489 shown previously to mediate the corepressor's interaction with HDAC3 ( 19 ), suggesting that the same region of SMRT is employed for binding to HDAC3 and p53, with SMRT serving as a corepressor with the former and as a coactivator for the latter. This suggests that HDAC3 and p53 can physically compete for binding to SMRT, or alternatively, there may be distinct pools of SMRT, one in which the corepressor is bound to HDAC3 and can repress gene expression and another in which SMRT is available to bind to p53 and ultimately contributes to activation of gene expression. Most importantly, our collective data indicate that SMRT coactivation of p53 is independent of HDAC3 activation by the DAD, and we therefore propose a model ( Fig. 10 ) in which DNA damage increases p53 expression, whereupon the C terminus of this transcription factor binds to the DAD of SMRT, and in conjunction with GPS2, TBL1, and CBP/p300, this HDAC3-independent SMRT complex can stimulate p53 transcriptional activity.

The ability of p53 and HDAC3 to bind to the same domain of SMRT highlights the importance of understanding cellular factors that can influence SMRT interactions with these two transcriptional regulators. Recent crystallographic determinations of the SMRT DAD-HDAC3 structure reveal that the interaction is dependent upon IP4 binding to the SMRT DAD ( 24 ). Thus, cellular IP4 availability may be one factor regulating SMRT corepressor versus coactivator potential. One of the enzymes that controls IP4 synthesis is inositol polyphosphate multikinase ( 73 ), which binds to p53 ( 74 ), thereby placing it in an appropriate location for influencing SMRT-HDAC3 interactions. Reduced expression levels of phosphatidylinositol phosphatases, such as PTEN or INPP4B, in cancers ( 75 – 77 ) could also be expected to influence the relative affinity of SMRT for HDAC3 and, consequently, the availability of SMRT for coactivation of p53. At this time, it is not clear what, if any, signaling pathways directly regulate SMRT-p53 interactions. However, the C-terminal domain of p53, required for binding to SMRT, is subject to extensive posttranslational modifications which have the potential to impact protein-protein interactions ( 78 ).

In its coactivation role, SMRT must be able to interact with proteins that can promote gene expression, quite possibly acting as a type of scaffold protein. A significant portion of the SMRT structure is highly disordered, suggesting that it serves as a hub protein for transient yet highly specific binding to other transcriptional regulatory proteins that promote p53-dependent gene expression ( 20 , 79 , 80 ). Conceivably, this could occur through SMRT-mediated recruitment and stabilization of complexes of positive regulators of transcription, and/or it may be due to SMRT facilitating a positively acting p53 posttranslational modification by another protein with enzymatic activity. For instance, SMRT has been shown to bind to members of the p160 family of steroid receptor coactivators and stimulate their intrinsic transcriptional activity ( 30 ). Members of this family, SRC-1 and, potentially, SRC-3, can coactivate p53 transcriptional activity ( 81 ), and SMRT and SRC coactivators are therefore likely candidates for jointly promoting p53-dependent gene expression. Moreover, the SRC coactivators can bind to CBP/p300 ( 82 ), which are known positive regulators of p53 ( 4 , 5 , 8 ), and this implicates the possibility of a SMRT-SRC-CBP/p300 complex as a potential stimulator of p53-dependent gene expression. It should be noted that SMRT binds to the C-terminal region of p53, which, as noted above, is heavily modified by posttranslational marks that can lead to p53 stabilization or stimulation of its transcriptional activity ( 78 ). As a scaffold, SMRT may recruit or stabilize the binding of other proteins, such as acetyltransferases (e.g., SRC-3), that can modify p53 and ultimately increase the expression of its target genes.

Our microarray results revealed that SMRT depletion decreases the expression of a group of genes involved in the DNA damage response and provide insight into the importance of SMRT's coactivator role in mediating DNA damage responses. Indeed, decreased expression of DNA damage response genes was initially noted in cells naive to genotoxic stress, indicating that SMRT regulates the basal transcription of these genes and may provide to cells protection against the intrinsic DNA damage (e.g., replication errors) that arises during cell division, thus extending the transcriptional regulatory role of SMRT to protection of the genome.

With respect to the DNA damage resulting from genotoxic stresses, other investigators have demonstrated that a reduction of SMRT but not NCoR enhanced the sensitivity of HeLa cells to ionizing radiation or DNA damage-inducing drugs, presumably through loss of the ability of SMRT to promote the inherent repressive activity of the Ku70 subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex that is required for double-strand break repair via the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway ( 68 ). More recently, it was demonstrated that knockdown of SMRT affected the expression of a number of genes that are regulated upon cellular exposure to the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin by an unknown mechanism ( 67 ). In particular, SMRT but not NCoR inhibited apoptosis associated with DNA damage, at least in part through inhibition of the expression of the Wip1 phosphatase that negatively regulates proapoptotic proteins, such as Chk2 ( 67 ). Taken together, the ability of SMRT to contribute to cellular responses to DNA damage via transcriptional regulation of the expression of genes involved in apoptosis (i.e., WIP1 ) and the repair of DNA damage via homologous recombination (i.e., RAD51 , BRCA1 , and CHEK1 ) and SMRT's interaction with the Ku70 subunit of the DNA-PK required for NHEJ repair pathways place SMRT in a position to coordinately effect the necessary alterations in chromatin architecture and the activity of the DNA repair pathways so that cells can effectively mount responses to DNA damage incurred either through normal cell division processes or as a result of external stresses to the cell.
