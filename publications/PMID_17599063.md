The WD-repeat protein factor associated with nSMase activity (FAN) is a member 
of the family of TNF receptor adaptor proteins that are coupled to specific 
signaling cascades. However, the precise functional involvement of FAN in 
specific cellular TNF responses remain unclear. Here, we report the involvement 
of FAN in TNF-induced actin reorganization and filopodia formation mediated by 
activation of Cdc42. The pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain of FAN specifically 
binds to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P), which targets FAN 
to the plasma membrane. Site-specific mutagenesis revealed that the ability of 
FAN to mediate filopodia formation was blunted either by the destruction of the 
PtdIns(4,5)P binding motif, or by the disruption of intramolecular interactions 
between the PH domain and the adjacent beige and Chediak-Higashi (BEACH) domain. 
Furthermore, FAN was shown to interact with the actin cytoskeleton in 
TNF-stimulated cells via direct filamentous actin (F-actin) binding. The results 
of this study suggest that PH-mediated plasma membrane targeting of FAN is 
critically involved in TNF-induced Cdc42 activation and cytoskeleton 
reorganization.

Abstract

The WD-repeat protein f actor a ssociated with n SMase activity (FAN) is a member of the family of TNF receptor adaptor proteins that are coupled to specific signaling cascades. However, the precise functional involvement of FAN in specific cellular TNF responses remain unclear. Here, we report the involvement of FAN in TNF-induced actin reorganization and filopodia formation mediated by activation of Cdc42. The pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain of FAN specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P), which targets FAN to the plasma membrane. Site-specific mutagenesis revealed that the ability of FAN to mediate filopodia formation was blunted either by the destruction of the PtdIns(4,5)P binding motif, or by the disruption of intramolecular interactions between the PH domain and the adjacent be ige a nd C hediak- Hi gashi (BEACH) domain. Furthermore, FAN was shown to interact with the actin cytoskeleton in TNF-stimulated cells via direct filamentous actin (F-actin) binding. The results of this study suggest that PH-mediated plasma membrane targeting of FAN is critically involved in TNF-induced Cdc42 activation and cytoskeleton reorganization.

Introduction

TNF is a pleiotropic and broadly active cytokine exerting its effects on many cell types inside and outside of the immune system. TNF orchestrates a wide range of biological functions including host defense against intracellular pathogens, septic shock, development of autoimmune diseases, wound healing and tumor defense ( Locksley et al , 2001 ; Wajant et al , 2003 ). Two distinct cell surface receptors have been identified for TNF, TNF-receptor I (TNF-RI) and TNF-receptor II (TNF-RII) ( Pfeffer et al , 1993 ; Vandenabeele et al , 1995 ). We and others have demonstrated a critical role for TNF-RI in the majority of biological effects promoted by TNF ( Wiegmann et al , 1992 ; Neumann et al , 1996 ). By binding to TNF-RI, TNF mediates diverse cellular events in various cell types from proliferation to apoptosis as a result of engaging different cellular compartments and signaling cascades. These include JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), NF-κB, caspase cascades, acidic sphingomyelinase (aSMase) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). The majority of the known effects of TNF are initiated by binding of various adaptor molecules to the cytoplasmic death domain (DD) of TNF-RI ( Chen and Goeddel, 2002 ; Wajant et al , 2003 ).

However, next to DD binding adaptor proteins, TNF-RI binds additional factors that may be important for TNF signaling ( Boldin et al , 1995 ; Adam-Klages et al , 1998 ). For example, a more membrane-proximal neutral SMase (nSMase) activation domain (NSD) of TNF-RI has previously been recognized as a distinct functional domain that is both required and sufficient for the activation of nSMase ( Adam et al , 1996 ). The only protein identified so far that binds to the NSD is the adaptor protein, f actor a ssociated with n SMase activity (FAN) ( Adam-Klages et al , 1996 ). Bioinformatic analysis classified FAN as a WD-repeat containing protein, a growing family of regulatory proteins that are involved in signal transduction. Besides a C-terminal cluster of WD repeats mediating binding to the NSD of TNF-RI ( Adam-Klages et al , 1996 ), FAN also contains a BEACH ( be ige a nd C hediak- Hi gashi) domain with unknown function. Structural analysis of neurobeachin (Nbea) that contains a BEACH domain homologous to the BEACH domain of FAN revealed that this domain is associated with a novel, weakly conserved pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain ( Jogl et al , 2002 ). Biochemical studies and structural analysis suggested that the PH and BEACH domains interact to function as a single unit, forming a prominent groove at the interface that may be used for the recruitment and interaction with downstream binding partners ( Jogl et al , 2002 ).

Originally shown to mediate TNF-induced activation of nSMase, FAN has been suggested to play an important role in the regulation of major inflammatory cellular responses to TNF ( Adam-Klages et al , 1996 ). However, mice deficient for FAN do not exhibit any striking abnormalities, except a delay in cutaneous barrier recovery, suggesting a physiological role of FAN in epidermal barrier repair ( Kreder et al , 1999 ). In addition, FAN has been implicated in TNF- and CD40-mediated induction of apoptosis ( Segui et al , 1999 , 2001 ), lysosomal permeabilization ( Werneburg et al , 2004 ), IL-6 secretion ( Malagarie-Cazenave et al , 2004 ), interaction with the WD protein RACK1 ( Tcherkasowa et al , 2002 ) and regulation of cardiac cell death ( O'Brien et al , 2003 ). However, mechanistic insights into FAN function in TNF-RI signaling are still missing.

Previously, the involvement of the membrane proximal region of TNF-RI in TNF-induced actin polymerization has been suggested ( Peppelenbosch et al , 1999 ). As this membrane proximal region included NSD, the FAN binding site, we hypothesized that FAN is involved in TNF-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. TNF is a potent modulator of the actin cytoskeleton in various cell types. It induces the formation of actin containing structures like stress fibers, lamellipodia and filopodia ( Puls et al , 1999 ) and affects chemotaxis and motility ( Leibovich et al , 1987 ; Postlethwaite and Seyer, 1990 ; Cumberbatch et al , 1997 ; Puls et al , 1999 ; Banno et al , 2004 ; Kutsuna et al , 2004 ; Lokuta and Huttenlocher, 2005 ). The modulation of the actin cytoskeleton by the TNF-RI signaling complex appears to be mediated by small GTPases like Cdc42. However, upstream molecules present in the TNF-RI signaling complex that link TNF-RI to these processes have not yet been identified.

We show here that murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) deficient for FAN display defective TNF-induced actin reorganization and filopodia formation. Mechanistically, this function of FAN requires the PH domain that localizes FAN to the plasma membrane via specific binding to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P) and is essentially required for FAN function in TNF-induced actin reorganization.

Discussion

In contrast to other TNF receptor adaptor proteins such as TRADD, FADD, RIP or TRAF2, FAN does not bind to, or interact with death domains, and its precise function in specific cellular responses to TNF remained largely unclear. Here, we show that FAN is crucial for the formation of filopodia and actin cytoskeleton reorganization induced by TNF. A major finding of our study demonstrates specific binding of the FAN PH domain to PtdIns(4,5)P, which directs FAN to the plasma membrane. Additionally, FAN binds to the actin cytoskeleton machinery upon TNF treatment, which is modulated by PH action. FAN-PH mutants with a non-functional PtdIns(4,5)P binding site were unable to mediate TNF-induced filopodia formation. Furthermore, disruption of the intramolecular interaction between the PH and BEACH domains abrogated the actin modulatory function of FAN without affecting membrane localization. Thus, the molecular mode of PH domain action in FAN signaling is defined by two independent functional features, that is, targeting of FAN to the plasma membrane and correct interdomain interaction between BEACH and PH regulating FAN function.

Several proteins involved in modulating the actin cytoskeleton via regulation of Rho GTPases contain PH or PH-like domains with lipid binding properties ( Bellanger et al , 2000 ; Ohta et al , 2006 ), which enable these proteins to localize correctly to the plasma membrane ( Cozier et al , 2004 ; Lemmon, 2004 ). PtdIns(4,5)P has been shown to directly interact with a large number of regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and control their activity at the plasma membrane ( Hilpela et al , 2004 ). Accumulating evidence also suggests PtdIns(4,5)P as a spatial marker for directing actin polymerization close to the plasma membrane ( Insall and Weiner, 2001 ). Like other cytoskeletal modulators FAN contains a PH domain that can bind to PtdIns(4,5)P ( Figure 5 ). FAN utilizes its PtdIns(4,5)P binding ability to associate with the plasma membrane, where interaction with plasma membrane TNF-RI and possibly additional proteins can occur ( Tcherkasowa et al , 2002 ).

In this study FAN was identified as a TNF-RI binding adaptor protein, which promotes Cdc42 activation upon TNF stimulation ( Figure 3 ). Since FAN does not contain any known Rho GTPase regulatory capacities like GAP (GTPase-activating protein) or GEF (guanine nucleotide-exchange factor) activity, further modulators of actin cytoskeleton might be the downstream target of FAN. As shown in Figure 7 , FAN appeared as a functionally dormant, plasma membrane-associated protein without actin cytoskeleton binding property in untreated cells. Upon TNF stimulation FAN interacted with the actin cytoskeleton machinery demonstrated by co-precipitation with actin and VASP and by F-actin co-sedimentation ( Figure 7A–C ). A fundamental property of many actin cytoskeleton modulators including ERM and WASP/WAVE proteins is their association with the plasma membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton connecting the plasma membrane and plasma membrane proteins to the cortical cytoskeleton ( Bretscher et al , 2002 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007 ). These proteins are mainly activated by extracellular signals, undergo conformational change and bind to the actin cytoskeleton. Similarly, FAN binds TNF-RI, associates with the plasma membrane ( Figure 5 ) and interacts with actin cytoskeleton machinery upon TNF treatment ( Figure 7 ). By interaction with the actin cytoskeleton machinery and TNF-RI, FAN could form a signaling platform, which locally modulates TNF-induced actin reorganization in a phosphoinositide-dependent manner, a mechanism similar to what has been recently shown for Toll-like receptor signaling ( Kagan and Medzhitov, 2006 ). In this context, the PH domain may modulate the actin binding capacity of FAN in a dual way: first by correct subcellular localization of FAN and second by promoting a conformational change of FAN ( Jogl et al , 2002 ) upon specific PtdIns(4,5)P binding ( Figure 6B ), as described for N-WASP (neural WASP) ( Prehoda et al , 2000 ). In contrast to ERM proteins, which are mainly linked to the plasma membrane by additional membrane proteins, FAN can directly associate with the plasma membrane via its specific PtdIns(4,5)P binding capacity. The direct association with plasma membrane lipids enables FAN for immediate early reaction to plasma membrane lipid modification, probably resulting in modulation of its downstream binding partners.

It has been proposed that PtdIns(4,5)P accumulates at plasma membrane lipid-microdomains, where it modulates the activity of proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton ( Chong et al , 1994 ; Honda et al , 1999 ; Laux et al , 2000 ). Sphingolipids are known to form liquid-ordered microdomains that segregate from the more fluid regions of membranes. In particular, sphingomyelin (SM) has been shown to form tight hydrophobic interactions with cholesterol and to play a key role in the formation of lipid rafts ( Barenholz, 2004 ). FAN has been initially identified as the factor associated with nSMase activity, an enzyme belonging to the family of sphingomyelinases that hydrolyze SM to ceramide (Cer), and thereby alter membrane lipid composition ( Cremesti et al , 2002 ). A recently identified novel nSMase3 was shown to be TNF responsive in a FAN-dependent manner ( Krut et al , 2006 ), and to localize to the plasma membrane (K Wiegmann and M Krönke, unpublished data). By modulating nSMase3 activity, FAN could influence membrane lipid composition and PtdIns(4,5)P distribution, and thus modulate downstream signaling of TNF-RI.

FAN appears to be important for TNF-induced Cdc42 activation. It is worth noting that, next to neutral sphingomyelinases including nSMase3, Cdc42 is the first signaling component identified to be regulated by FAN ( Figure 3 ). Strikingly, Hanna et al (2001) have previously reported that exogenous sphingomyelinase and synthetic C2-ceramide induce membrane association of Rho GTPases like Cdc42 and phosphorylation of paxillin and focal adhesion kinase. Thus, it will be interesting to test a possible functional link between FAN and nSMase3 in TNF-induced activation of Cdc42 and subsequent formation of filopodia. This idea is supported by the observation that mutations of PH or BEACH that disrupt the interaction between the PH and BEACH domains not only block TNF-induced filopodia formation but also destroy FAN-mediated activation of nSMase ( Jogl et al , 2002 ).

Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to cytokines like TNF plays a central role in modulating the shape and behavior of cells. Cellular motility modulated by TNF has been shown to be especially important in epidermal repair and wound healing ( Cumberbatch et al , 1997 ; Banno et al , 2004 ; Lokuta and Huttenlocher, 2005 ). The identification of FAN as a mediator of Cdc42 activation and cell polarization closes an important gap in our understanding of TNF-induced molecular pathways regulating cytoskeletal reorganization.
