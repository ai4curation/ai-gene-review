During the G0/G1-S phase transition, the timely synthesis and degradation of key 
regulatory proteins is required for normal cell cycle progression. Two of these 
proteins, c-Myc and cyclin E, are recognized by the Cdc4 E3 ligase of the 
Skp1/Cul1/Rbx1 (SCF) complex. SCF(Cdc4) binds to a similar phosphodegron 
sequence in c-Myc and cyclin E proteins resulting in ubiquitylation and 
degradation of both proteins via the 26 S proteosome. Since the prolyl isomerase 
Pin1 binds the c-Myc phosphodegron and participates in regulation of c-Myc 
turnover, we hypothesized that Pin1 would bind to and regulate cyclin E turnover 
in a similar manner. Here we show that Pin1 regulates the turnover of cyclin E 
in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Pin1 binds to the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex in a manner 
that depends on Ser384 of cyclin E, which is phosphorylated by Cdk2. The absence 
of Pin1 results in an increased steady-state level of cyclin E and stalling of 
the cells in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. The cellular changes that result 
from the loss of Pin1 predispose Pin1 null mouse embryo fibroblasts to undergo 
more rapid genomic instability when immortalized by conditional inactivation of 
p53 and sensitizes these cells to more aggressive Ras-dependent transformation 
and tumorigenesis.
