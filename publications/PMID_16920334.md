CARD only protein (Cop) was recently identified as a protein with significant 
homology with the CARD of caspase-1. We have conducted functional studies on Cop 
and report on its role as an inhibitor of cell death in a broad range of cell 
death paradigms. A notable exception in the ability of Cop to inhibit cell death 
pertains to its inability to inhibit ER stress-mediated cell death. Furthermore, 
in addition to the known interaction of Cop and caspase-1, we demonstrated a 
novel interaction of Cop with caspase-4. We propose that Cop's action to prevent 
TNF-alpha-induced cell death may operate independently of the mitochondrial 
death pathway. Furthermore, Cop overexpression inhibits Bid cleavage. In 
summary, Cop inhibition of cell death, at least to a certain extent, results 
from its interference with the activation of caspase-1 and caspase-4. 
Understanding the mechanistic details modulating caspase cell death pathways 
should provide important information for the development of therapies for 
diseases featuring aberrant caspase activation. Cop, as an inhibitor of an 
important apical caspase cell death axis, may provide a tool for modulating 
pathological cell death.
