A novel human inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family member termed Livin 
was identified, containing a single baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domain and a 
COOH-terminal RING finger domain. The mRNA for livin was not detectable by 
Northern blot in most normal adult tissues with the exception of the placenta, 
but was present in developmental tissues and in several cancer cell lines. 
Highest levels were observed in two melanoma-derived cell lines, G361 and 
SK-Mel29. Transfection of livin in HeLa cells resulted in protection from 
apoptosis induced by expression of FADD, Bax, RIP, RIP3, and DR6. Similar to 
other IAP family members, the anti-apoptotic activity of Livin was dependent on 
the BIR domain. Livin was also capable of inhibiting DEVD-like caspase activity 
triggered by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In vitro binding studies demonstrated 
a direct interaction between Livin and the active form of the downstream 
caspases, caspase-3 and -7, that was dependent on the BIR domain of Livin. In 
addition, the unprocessed and cleaved forms of caspase-9 co-immunoprecipitated 
with Livin in vivo, and recombinant Livin could inhibit the activation of 
caspase-9 induced by Apaf-1, cytochrome c, and dATP. The subcellular 
distribution of the transfected Livin was analyzed by immunofluorescence. Both 
Livin and Survivin were expressed in the nucleus and in a filamentous pattern 
throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast to the apoptotic activity, the 
COOH-terminal RING domain mediated its subcellular localization patterning. 
Further studies found that transfection of an antisense construct against livin 
could trigger apoptosis specifically in cell lines expressing livin mRNA. This 
was associated with an increase in DNA fragmentation and in DEVD-like caspase 
activity. Thus, disruption of Livin may provide a strategy to induce apoptosis 
in certain cancer cells.
