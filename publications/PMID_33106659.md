De novo formation of the double-membrane compartment autophagosome is seeded by 
small vesicles carrying membrane protein autophagy-related 9 (ATG9), the 
function of which remains unknown. Here we find that ATG9A scrambles 
phospholipids of membranes in vitro. Cryo-EM structures of human ATG9A reveal a 
trimer with a solvated central pore, which is connected laterally to the cytosol 
through the cavity within each protomer. Similarities to ABC exporters suggest 
that ATG9A could be a transporter that uses the central pore to function. 
Moreover, molecular dynamics simulation suggests that the central pore opens 
laterally to accommodate lipid headgroups, thereby enabling lipids to flip. 
Mutations in the pore reduce scrambling activity and yield markedly smaller 
autophagosomes, indicating that lipid scrambling by ATG9A is essential for 
membrane expansion. We propose ATG9A acts as a membrane-embedded funnel to 
facilitate lipid flipping and to redistribute lipids added to the outer leaflet 
of ATG9 vesicles, thereby enabling growth into autophagosomes.
