The nuclear yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system is the most widely used technology for 
detecting interactions between proteins. A common approach is to screen specific 
test proteins (baits) against large compilations of randomly cloned proteins 
(prey libraries). For eukaryotic organisms, libraries have traditionally been 
generated using messenger RNA (mRNA) extracted from various tissues and cells. 
Here we present a library construction strategy made possible by ongoing public 
efforts to establish collections of full-length protein encoding clones. Our 
approach generates libraries that are essentially normalized and contain both 
randomly fragmented as well as full-length inserts. We refer to this type of 
protein-coding clone-derived library as random and full-length (RAFL) Y2H 
library. The library described here is based on clones from the Mammalian Gene 
Collection, but our strategy is compatible with the use of any protein-coding 
clone collection from any organism in any vector and does not require inserts to 
be devoid of untranslated regions. We tested our prototype human RAFL library 
against a set of baits that had previously been searched against multiple cDNA 
libraries. These Y2H searches yielded a combination of novel as well as expected 
interactions, indicating that the RAFL library constitutes a valuable complement 
to Y2H cDNA libraries.
