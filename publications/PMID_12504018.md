Chromatin remodeling can facilitate the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol 
II) to targeted promoters, as well as enhancing the level of transcription. 
Here, we describe a further key role for chromatin remodeling in transcriptional 
termination. Using a genetic screen in S. pombe, we identified the CHD-Mi2 class 
chromatin remodeling ATPase, Hrp1, as a termination factor. In S. cerevisiae, we 
show that transcriptional termination and chromatin structure at the 3' ends of 
three genes all depend on the activity of the Hrp1 homolog, Chd1p, either alone 
or redundantly with the ISWI ATPases, Isw1p, and Isw2p. We suggest that 
chromatin remodeling of termination regions is a necessary prelude to efficient 
Pol II termination.
