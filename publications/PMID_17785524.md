Autophagy is a major pathway used to degrade long-lived proteins and organelles. 
Autophagy is thought to promote both cell and organism survival by providing 
fundamental building blocks to maintain energy homeostasis during starvation. 
Under different conditions, however, autophagy may instead act to promote cell 
death through an autophagic cell death pathway distinct from apoptosis. Although 
several recent papers suggest that autophagy plays a role in cell death, it is 
not known whether autophagy can cause the death of an organism. Furthermore, why 
autophagy acts in some instances to promote survival but in others to promote 
death is poorly understood. Here we show that physiological levels of autophagy 
act to promote survival in Caenorhabditis elegans during starvation, whereas 
insufficient or excessive levels of autophagy contribute to death. We found that 
inhibition of autophagy decreases survival of wild-type worms during starvation, 
and that muscarinic signaling regulates starvation-induced autophagy, at least 
in part, through the death-associated protein kinase signaling pathway. 
Furthermore, we found that in gpb-2 mutants, in which muscarinic signaling 
cannot be down-regulated, starvation induces excessive autophagy in pharyngeal 
muscles, which in turn, causes damage that may contribute to death. Taken 
together, our results demonstrate that autophagy can have either prosurvival or 
prodeath functions in an organism, depending on its level of activation.
