The cilium-centrosome complex contains triplet, doublet, and singlet 
microtubules. The lumenal surfaces of each microtubule within this diverse array 
are decorated by microtubule inner proteins (MIPs). Here, we used 
single-particle cryo-electron microscopy methods to build atomic models of two 
types of human ciliary microtubule: the doublet microtubules of multiciliated 
respiratory cells and the distal singlet microtubules of monoflagellated human 
spermatozoa. We discover that SPACA9 is a polyspecific MIP capable of binding 
both microtubule types. SPACA9 forms intralumenal striations in the B tubule of 
respiratory doublet microtubules and noncontinuous spirals in sperm singlet 
microtubules. By acquiring new and reanalyzing previous cryo-electron tomography 
data, we show that SPACA9-like intralumenal striations are common features of 
different microtubule types in animal cilia. Our structures provide detailed 
references to help rationalize ciliopathy-causing mutations and position cryo-EM 
as a tool for the analysis of samples obtained directly from ciliopathy 
patients.
