The NK cell maturation from CD34(+) Lin(-) hematopoietic cell precursors is a 
complex process that requires the direct contact with stromal cells and/or the 
synergistic effect of different cytokines. In this study we show that IL-21 is 
capable of inducing an accelerated NK cell maturation when added to cultures of 
CD34(+) Lin(-) cells isolated from human cord blood supplemented with IL-15, 
Flt3-L and SCF. After 25 days of culture, 50% of CD56(+) cells expressed various 
NK cell markers including the NKp46 and NKp30 triggering receptors, the 
CD94/NKG2A inhibitory receptor and CD16. At day 35, substantial fractions of NK 
cells expressed KIR, CD8 and CD2, i.e. surface markers expressed by mature NK 
cells, that are virtually undetectable in developing NK cells cultured in the 
absence of IL-21. Remarkably, similar to mature NK cells all these markers were 
included in the CD56(dim) cell fraction, while the CD56(bright) population was 
only composed of CD94/NKG2A(-) and CD94/NKG2A(+) cells. Thus, IL-21 allows the 
induction of a full NK cell maturation in vitro and offers an important tool for 
dissecting the molecular mechanisms involved in different steps of NK cell 
maturation and in the acquisition of a mature KIR repertoire.
