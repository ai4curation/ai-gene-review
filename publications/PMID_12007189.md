The SSX gene family is composed of at least five functional and highly 
homologous members, SSX1 to SSX5, that are normally expressed in only the testis 
and thyroid. SSX1, SSX2, or SSX4 may be fused to the SYT gene as a result of the 
t(X;18) translocation in synovial sarcoma. In addition, the SSX1, SSX2, SSX4, 
and SSX5 genes were found to be aberrantly expressed in several other 
malignancies, including melanoma. The SSX proteins are localized in the nucleus 
and are diffusely distributed. In addition, they may be included in 
polycomb-group nuclear bodies. Other studies have indicated that the SSX 
proteins may act as transcriptional repressors. As a first step toward the 
elucidation of the cellular signaling networks in which the SSX proteins may 
act, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify SSX2-interacting proteins. 
By doing so, two novel human proteins were detected: RAB3IP, the human homolog 
of an interactor of the Ras-like GTPase Rab3A; and a novel protein, SSX2IP. 
RAB3IP did not interact with either SSX1, SSX3, or SSX4 in the yeast two-hybrid 
system, whereas SSX2IP interacted with SSX3 but not with either SSX1 or SSX4. 
Further analysis of deletion mutants showed that both RAB3IP and SSX2IP interact 
with the N-terminal moiety of the SSX2 protein. Immunofluorescence analyses of 
transfected cells revealed that the RAB3IP protein is normally localized in the 
cytoplasm. However, coexpression of both RAB3IP and SSX2 led to colocalization 
of both proteins in the nucleus. Likewise, the SSX2IP protein was found to be 
colocalizing with SSX2 in the nucleus. By performing glutathione-S-transferase 
pull-down assays, we found that both RAB3IP and SSX2IP interact directly with 
SSX2 in vitro. These newly observed protein/protein interactions may have 
important implications for the mechanisms underlying normal and malignant 
cellular growth.
