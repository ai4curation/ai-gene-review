In both flies and mammals, almost one-third of the newly emerging male germ 
cells are spontaneously eliminated before entering meiosis. Here, we show that 
in Drosophila, germ cell death (GCD) involves the initiator caspase Dronc 
independently of the apoptosome and the main executioner caspases. Electron 
microscopy of dying germ cells revealed mixed morphologies of apoptosis and 
necrosis. We further show that the lysosomes and their catabolic enzymes, but 
not macroautophagy, are involved in the execution of GCD. We then identified, in 
a screen, the Parkinson's disease-associated mitochondrial protease, HtrA2/Omi, 
as an important mediator of GCD, acting mainly through its catalytic activity 
rather than by antagonizing inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. Concomitantly, 
other mitochondrial-associated factors were also implicated in GCD, including 
Pink1 (but not Parkin), the Bcl-2-related proteins, and endonuclease G, which 
establish the mitochondria as central mediators of GCD. These findings uncover 
an alternative developmental cell death pathway in metazoans.
