Although protein quality control (PQC) is generally perceived as important for 
the development of the nervous system, the specific mechanisms of neuronal PQC 
have remained poorly understood. Here, we report that C. elegans Elongin 
BC-binding axon regulator (EBAX-1), a conserved BC-box protein, regulates axon 
guidance through PQC of the SAX-3/Robo receptor. EBAX-1 buffers guidance errors 
against temperature variations. As a substrate-recognition subunit in the 
Elongin BC-containing Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL), EBAX-1 also binds to 
DAF-21, a cytosolic Hsp90 chaperone. The EBAX-type CRL and DAF-21 
collaboratively regulate SAX-3-mediated axon pathfinding. Biochemical and 
imaging assays indicate that EBAX-1 specifically recognizes misfolded SAX-3 and 
promotes its degradation in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, vertebrate EBAX also 
shows substrate preference toward aberrant Robo3 implicated in horizontal gaze 
palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS). Together, our findings demonstrate a 
triage PQC mechanism mediated by the EBAX-type CRL and DAF-21/Hsp90 that 
maintains the accuracy of neuronal wiring.
