We report the isolation and characterisation of cDNAs encoding three different, 
human members of the cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP) family. The novel 
CRISP-1 exists in five cDNA subtypes differing by the presence or absence of a 
stretch coding for a C-terminal cysteine-rich domain so far found in all members 
of the family, and by the length of their 3'-untranslated region. CRISP-2 cDNA 
corresponds to the previously described TPX1 form, with so far unreported 
5'-untranslated sequence heterogeneities while CRISP-3 cDNA codes for a new, 
unique protein. Northern blot analysis of various human organs indicates that 
CRISP-1 transcripts are epididymis-specific whereas CRISP-2/TPX1 transcripts are 
detected mainly in the testis and also in the epididymis. CRISP-3 transcripts 
are more widely distributed and found predominantly in the salivary gland, 
pancreas and prostate, and in less abundance in the epididymis, ovary, thymus 
and colon. A protein reacting with an anti-mouse CRISP-1 antibody was isolated 
from human epididymal extracts and N-terminal sequencing revealed that it 
corresponded to the CRISP-1 cDNA we have isolated. In contrast to findings on 
its rat counterpart epididymal protein DE/acidic epididymal glycoprotein (AEG), 
no significant association of CRISP-1 with human spermatozoa was observed.
