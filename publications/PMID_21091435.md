In eukaryotes, disulfide bonds are formed in the endoplasmic reticulum, 
facilitated by the Ero1 (endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin 1) oxidase/PDI 
(protein disulfide-isomerase) system. Mammals have two ERO1 genes, encoding 
Ero1α and Ero1β proteins. Ero1β is constitutively expressed in professional 
secretory tissues and induced during the unfolded protein response. In the 
present work, we show that recombinant human Ero1β is twice as active as Ero1α 
in enzymatic assays. Ero1β oxidizes PDI more efficiently than other PDI family 
members and drives oxidative protein folding preferentially via the active site 
in the á domain of PDI. Our results reveal that Ero1β oxidase activity is 
regulated by long-range disulfide bonds and that Cys130 plays a critical role in 
feedback regulation. Compared with Ero1α, however, Ero1β is loosely regulated, 
consistent with its role as a more active oxidase when massive oxidative power 
is required.
