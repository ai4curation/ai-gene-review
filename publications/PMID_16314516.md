The cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) binding factor, CPEB, is a 
sequence-specific RNA binding protein that controls polyadenylation-induced 
translation in germ cells and at postsynaptic sites of neurons. A yeast 
two-hybrid screen with a mouse brain cDNA library identified the transmembrane 
amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) as a CPEB-interacting factor. CPEB 
binds the small intracellular domain (ICD) of APLP1 and the related proteins 
APLP2 and APP. These proteins promote polyadenylation and translation by 
stimulating Aurora A catalyzed CPEB serine 174 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, 
CPEB, Maskin, CPSF, and several other factors involved in polyadenylation and 
translation and CPE-containing RNA are all detected on membranes by cell 
fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy. Moreover, most of the RNA that 
undergoes polyadenylation does so in membrane-containing fractions. These data 
demonstrate a link between cytoplasmic polyadenylation and membrane association 
and implicate APP family member proteins as anchors for localized mRNA 
polyadenylation and translation.
