The activity of a damage-specific DNA-binding protein (DDB) is absent from a 
subset, Ddb-, of cell strains from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum group E 
(XP-E). DDB is a heterodimer of 127-kDa and 48-kDa subunits. We have now 
identified single-base mutations in the gene of the 48-kDa subunit in cells from 
the three known Ddb- individuals, but not in XP-E strains that have the 
activity. An A --> G transition causes a K244E change in XP82TO and a G --> A 
transition causes an R273H change in XP2RO and XP3RO. No mutations were found in 
the cDNA of the 127-kDa subunit. Overexpression of p48 in insect cells greatly 
increases DDB activity in the cells, especially if p127 is jointly 
overexpressed. These results demonstrate that p48 is required for DNA binding 
activity, but at the same time necessitate further definition of the genetic 
basis of XP group E.
