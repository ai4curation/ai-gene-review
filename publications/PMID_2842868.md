Human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) consists of two distinct but related 
polypeptide chains designated PDGF-A and PDGF-B. The gene encoding PDGF-B has 
given rise to the v-sis oncogene. In the present study the transforming 
activities of PDGF-A and PDGF-B genes are compared. The PDGF-A chain gene is 
markedly less efficient in inducing transformation than the PDGF-B gene under 
the influence of the same promoter. There are significant differences in the 
secretory and growth stimulating properties of the two chains. These properties 
appear to account for the much more potent transforming ability of the PDGF-B 
gene. These findings provide insights into biologic properties of a growth 
factor responsible for potent autocrine stimulation of abnormal cell 
proliferation.
