Cancer cells have complex, unique characteristics that distinguish them from 
normal cells, such as increased growth rates and evasion of anti-proliferative 
signals. Global inhibition of class I and II histone deacetylases (HDACs) stops 
cancer cell proliferation in vitro and has proven effective against cancer in 
clinical trials, at least in part, through transcriptional reactivation of the 
p21(WAF1/Cip1)gene. The HDACs that regulate p21(WAF1/Cip1) are not fully 
identified. Using small interfering RNAs, we found that HDAC4 participates in 
the repression of p21(WAF1/Cip1) through Sp1/Sp3-, but not p53-binding sites. 
HDAC4 interacts with Sp1, binds and reduces histone H3 acetylation at the 
Sp1/Sp3 binding site-rich p21(WAF1/Cip1) proximal promoter, suggesting a key 
role for Sp1 in HDAC4-mediated repression of p21(WAF1/Cip1). Induction of 
p21(WAF1/Cip1) mediated by silencing of HDAC4 arrested cancer cell growth in 
vitro and inhibited tumor growth in an in vivo human glioblastoma model. Thus, 
HDAC4 could be a useful target for new anti-cancer therapies based on selective 
inhibition of specific HDACs.
