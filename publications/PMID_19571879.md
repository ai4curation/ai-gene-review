Stem cells are controlled, in part, by genetic pathways frequently dysregulated 
during human tumorigenesis. Either stimulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling or 
overexpression of telomerase is sufficient to activate quiescent epidermal stem 
cells in vivo, although the mechanisms by which telomerase exerts these effects 
are not understood. Here we show that telomerase directly modulates 
Wnt/beta-catenin signalling by serving as a cofactor in a beta-catenin 
transcriptional complex. The telomerase protein component TERT (telomerase 
reverse transcriptase) interacts with BRG1 (also called SMARCA4), a 
SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodelling protein, and activates Wnt-dependent 
reporters in cultured cells and in vivo. TERT serves an essential role in 
formation of the anterior-posterior axis in Xenopus laevis embryos, and this 
defect in Wnt signalling manifests as homeotic transformations in the vertebrae 
of Tert(-/-) mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the endogenous TERT protein 
from mouse gastrointestinal tract shows that TERT physically occupies gene 
promoters of Wnt-dependent genes. These data reveal an unanticipated role for 
telomerase as a transcriptional modulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling 
pathway.
