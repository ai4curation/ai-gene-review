Different signal-regulated serine/threonine kinases phosphorylate class II 
histone deacetylases (HDACs) to promote nuclear export, cytosolic accumulation, 
and activation of gene transcription. However, little is known about mechanisms 
operating in the opposite direction, which, possibly through phosphatases, 
should promote class II HDACs nuclear entry and subsequent gene repression. Here 
we show that HDAC4 forms a complex with the PP2A holoenzyme C alpha, A alpha, 
B/PR55 alpha. In vitro and in vivo binding studies demonstrate that the 
N-terminus of HDAC4 interacts with the catalytic subunit of PP2A. HDAC4 is 
dephosphorylated by PP2A and experiments using okadaic acid or RNA interference 
have revealed that PP2A controls HDAC4 nuclear import. Moreover, we identified 
serine 298 as a putative phosphorylation site important for HDAC4 nuclear 
import. The HDAC4 mutant mimicking phosphorylation of serine 298 is defective in 
nuclear import. Mutation of serine 298 to alanine partially rescues the defect 
in HDAC4 nuclear import observed in cells with down-regulated PP2A. These 
observations suggest that PP2A, via the dephosphorylation of multiple serines 
including the 14-3-3 binding sites and serine 298, controls HDAC4 nuclear 
import.
