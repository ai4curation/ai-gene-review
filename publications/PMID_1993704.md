A cDNA encoding chicken glycine decarboxylase (pCP15b) was isolated using an 
antibody specific to this protein. Additional cDNAs were cloned with the aid of 
the genomic fragments obtained by using the pCP15b cDNA probe. No initiator 
methionine codon is found in the currently elucidated cDNA sequence, and an ATG 
codon in an exon is assigned to this role. The precursor glycine decarboxylase 
deduced from the 3514-base pair nucleotide sequence is comprised of 1,004 amino 
acids (Mr = 111,848). The 1,020 amino acid residues are encoded for the 
precursor form of human glycine decarboxylase (Mr = 112,869) in the 3,783-base 
long cDNA sequence of two 1.9-kilobase pair cDNAs with a pentanucleotide 
overlap. The pyridoxal phosphate binding site lysine and a glycine-rich region, 
which is suggested to be responsible for the attachment of the phosphate moiety 
of pyridoxal phosphate, are found in close proximity in both the chicken and 
human enzymes. This region essential for the enzyme action is suggested to be 
embedded in a segment rich in beta-turns and random coils and is surrounded by 
conserved and repetitive amino acid sequences. It is suggested that these 
structures are involved in the organization of the active site of glycine 
decarboxylase.
