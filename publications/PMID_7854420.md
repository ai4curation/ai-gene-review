The Axl receptor tyrosine kinase was identified as a protein encoded by a 
transforming gene from primary human myeloid leukaemia cells by DNA-mediated 
transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. Axl is the founding member of a family of 
related receptors that includes Eyk, encoded by a chicken proto-oncogene 
originally described as a retroviral transforming gene, and c-Mer, encoded by a 
human proto-oncogene expressed in neoplastic B- and T-cell lines. The 
transforming activity of Axl demonstrates that the receptor can drive cellular 
proliferation. The function of Axl in non-transformed cells and tissues is 
unknown, but may involve the stimulation of cell proliferation in response to an 
appropriate signal, namely a ligand that activates the receptor. We report here 
the purification of an Axl stimulatory factor, and its identification as the 
product of growth-arrest-specific gene 6 (ref. 6). This is, to our knowledge, 
the first description of a ligand for the Axl family of receptors.
