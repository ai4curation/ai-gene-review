Clusterin (CLU) is an extracellular chaperone that is likely to play an 
important role in protein folding quality control. This study identified three 
deposition disease-associated proteins as major plasma clients for clusterin by 
studying CLU-client complexes formed in response to physiologically relevant 
stress (shear stress, approximately 36 dynes/cm(2) at 37 degrees C). Analysis of 
plasma samples by size exclusion chromatography indicated that (i) relative to 
control plasma, stressed plasma contained proportionally more soluble protein 
species of high molecular weight, and (ii) high molecular weight species were 
far more abundant when proteins purified by anti-CLU immunoaffinity 
chromatography from stressed plasma were compared with those purified from 
control plasma. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses indicated that a variety of 
proteins co-purified with CLU from both stressed and control plasma; however, 
several proteins were uniquely present or much more abundant when plasma was 
stressed. These proteins were identified by mass spectrometry as ceruloplasmin, 
fibrinogen, and albumin. Immunodot blot analysis of size exclusion 
chromatography fractionated plasma suggested that CLU-client complexes generated 
in situ are very large and may reach >or=4 x 10(7) Da. Lastly, sandwich 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detected complexes containing CLU and 
ceruloplasmin, fibrinogen, or albumin in stressed but not control plasma. We 
have previously proposed that CLU-client complexes serve as vehicles to dispose 
of damaged misfolded extracellular proteins in vivo via receptor-mediated 
endocytosis. A better understanding of these mechanisms is likely to ultimately 
lead to the identification of new therapies for extracellular protein deposition 
disorders.
