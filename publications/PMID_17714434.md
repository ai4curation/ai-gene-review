The ubiquitin-binding protein Hrs and endosomal sorting complex required for 
transport (ESCRT)-I and ESCRT-III are involved in sorting endocytosed and 
ubiquitinated receptors to lysosomes for degradation and efficient termination 
of signaling. In this study, we have investigated the role of the ESCRT-II 
subunit Vps22/EAP30 in degradative protein sorting of ubiquitinated receptors. 
Vps22 transiently expressed in HeLa cells was detected in endosomes containing 
endocytosed epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) as well as Hrs and ESCRT-I 
and ESCRT-III. Depletion of Vps22 by small interfering RNA, which was 
accompanied by decreased levels of other ESCRT-II subunits, greatly reduced 
degradation of EGFR and its ligand EGF as well as the chemokine receptor CXCR4. 
EGFR accumulated on the limiting membranes of early endosomes and aberrantly 
small multivesicular bodies in Vps22-depleted cells. Phosphorylation and nuclear 
translocation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase1/2 downstream of the 
EGF-activated receptor were sustained by depletion of Hrs or the ESCRT-I subunit 
Tsg101. In contrast, this was not the case when Vps22 was depleted. These 
results indicate an important role for Vps22 in ligand-induced EGFR and CXCR4 
turnover and suggest that termination of EGF signaling occurs prior to ESCRT-II 
engagement.
