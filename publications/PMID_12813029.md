TNF-alpha activates ASK1 in part by dissociating 14-3-3 from apoptosis 
signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). In the present study, we identified a novel 
Ras GTPase-activating protein (Ras-GAP) as an ASK1-interacting protein (AIP1). 
AIP1 binds to the C-terminal domain of ASK1 via a lysine-rich cluster within the 
N-terminal C2 domain. AIP1 exists in a closed form through an intramolecular 
interaction between the N-terminus and the C-terminus, and TNF-alpha induces 
unfolding of AIP1 leading to association of AIP1 with ASK1. Thus, the N-terminus 
of AIP1 containing the C2 and GAP domains constitutively binds to ASK1 and 
facilitates the release of 14-3-3 from ASK1. In contrast to 14-3-3, AIP1 binds 
preferentially to dephosphorylated ASK1. Recruited AIP1 enhances ASK1-induced 
JNK activation, and the ASK1 binding and the GAP activity of AIP1 are critical 
for AIP1-enhanced ASK1 activation. Furthermore, TNF-induced ASK1/JNK activation 
is significantly blunted in cells where AIP1 is knocked down by RNA 
interference. These data suggest that AIP1 mediates TNF-alpha-induced ASK1 
activation by facilitating dissociation of inhibitor 14-3-3 from ASK1, a novel 
mechanism by which TNF-alpha activates ASK1.

Introduction

Apoptosis signal–regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a member of the MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K) family, is an upstream activator of JNK and p38 MAPK signaling cascades ( 1 ). ASK1 can be activated in response to diverse stress and apoptotic stimuli, including proinflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and reactive oxygen species ( 2 , 3 ). Activation of ASK1 triggers various biological responses such as apoptosis, inflammation, differentiation, and survival in different cell types ( 4 – 7 ). Recent studies from ASK1-deficient mice indicate that ASK1 is critical for TNF-α– and reactive oxygen species–induced apoptosis signaling ( 8 ). ASK1 is a 170-kDa protein that functionally is composed of an inhibitory N-terminal domain, an internal kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain. The C-terminal domain of ASK1 binds to the TRAF domain; this association is required for ASK1 activation by TRAF2 and TRAF6 ( 3 , 9 ). Several cellular factors including thioredoxin (Trx), glutaredoxin, and 14-3-3 have been reported to inhibit ASK1 activity. The cellular redox sensors Trx and glutaredoxin in reduced form bind to ASK1 and block cytokine- and reactive oxygen species–induced ASK1 activation ( 6 , 7 , 10 – 12 ). 14-3-3, a phosphoserine-binding molecule, binds to ASK1 specifically via Ser-967 of ASK1 and has been reported to inhibit ASK1-induced apoptosis ( 6 , 13 ).

The mechanism by which stress stimuli activate ASK1 is not clear. It has been shown that TNF-α activates ASK1 in part by dissociating ASK1 from its inhibitors Trx and 14-3-3. Trx binds to ASK1 in a reduced form via either one of the two critical Cys residues Cys-32 and Cys-35 of Trx. We have recently shown that association of Trx with ASK1 induces ASK1 ubiquitination and degradation, leading to inhibition of ASK1 activity ( 7 ). TNF-α dissociates Trx from ASK1 by generating intracellular reactive oxygen species to oxidize Trx ( 7 , 10 ). The role of 14-3-3 in regulation of TNF-α–induced ASK1 activation in endothelial cells (ECs) has also been demonstrated. We have previously shown that TNF-α activates ASK1 by dissociating it from the ASK1–14-3-3 complex ( 6 ). In contrast, laminar flow in ECs inhibits TNF-α–induced ASK1 and JNK activation by preventing the release of ASK1 from 14-3-3 ( 6 ). However, the mechanism by which TNF-α dissociates 14-3-3 from ASK1 is not understood.

In the present study, we show that a novel ASK1-interacting protein (AIP1) associates with ASK1 in response to TNF-α. AIP1 binds to a sequence surrounding the 14-3-3 binding site (phosphoserine-967, or pSer-967) on ASK1, but binds preferentially to a dephosphorylated active form of ASK1. More importantly, AIP1 induces dissociation of 14-3-3 from ASK1, leading to enhanced ASK1 activity. We propose that AIP1 mediates TNF-α–induced ASK1 activation by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3, a novel mechanism for ASK1 activation.

Discussion

In this study we show that AIP1, a newly described Ras-GAP protein, facilitates TNF-α–induced dissociation of ASK1 from its inhibitor 14-3-3, leading to enhanced ASK1 activation. Association of AIP1 with ASK1 and the GAP activity of AIP1 are required for AIP1-enhanced ASK1 activity. While 14-3-3 binds to phosphorylated ASK1 (pSer-967 ASK1) in resting ECs, AIP1 binds to the dephosphorylated active form of ASK1. Moreover, TNF-α–induced ASK1-JNK activation is significantly blunted in cells where AIP1 is knocked down by RNA interference. These data suggest that AIP1 mediates TNF-α–induced ASK1 activation by dissociating inhibitor 14-3-3 from ASK1, a novel mechanism by which TNF-α activates ASK1 (Figure 8 d). Based on these results, we conclude that AIP1 is a novel regulator of ASK1.

14-3-3 binds to ASK1 in resting ECs, indicating that ASK1 is basally phosphorylated at Ser-967 and forms a preexisting complex with 14-3-3. TNF-α activates ASK1 in part by dissociating ASK1 from 14-3-3. We have previously proposed that TNF-α activates a phosphatase that dephosphorylates ASK1 at Ser-967 and releases ASK1 from 14-3-3 inhibitor. Phosphatases such as cdc25A and PP5 have been implicated in regulating ASK1 activation in a negative fashion ( 22 , 23 ). The cdc25A phosphatase binds to ASK1 at a site adjacent to the kinase domain and inhibits ASK1 activity in a phosphatase activity–independent manner ( 19 ). PP5 has been shown to associate with ASK1 in response to hydrogen peroxide and to dephosphorylate ASK1 at Thr-845 to inhibit ASK1 activation as a feedback mechanism ( 23 ). The phosphatase(s) that targets ASK1 Ser-967 needs to be identified. It is plausible that AIP1 recruits the phosphatase to ASK1 to facilitate 14-3-3 release. Identification of this phosphatase will help us to further understand the mechanism for AIP1-mediated 14-3-3 release from ASK1.

Recent studies have demonstrated that ASK1 activation involves several steps, including release of inhibitors (such as Trx, glutaredoxin, glutathione S–transferase-μ, heat shock proteins, and 14-3-3) ( 6 , 10 , 13 , 24 – 26 ), TRAF-dependent homodimerization/polymerization ( 11 , 12 ), autophosphorylation at Thr-845 ( 27 ), and scaffold protein–mediated association of ASK1 with downstream MKK and JNK ( 28 – 30 ). Our data show that AIP1 overexpression alone does not activate the endogenous ASK1-JNK signaling pathway in ECs. It seems that release of 14-3-3 by AIP1 is necessary but not sufficient for ASK1 activation. Release of other inhibitors such as Trx is also required. It is conceivable that TNF-α induces release of Trx and 14-3-3 in a coordinated fashion, leading to ASK1-JNK activation.

AIP1 mutants defective in ASK1 binding or GAP activity failed to increase ASK1 activity, suggesting that both association of AIP1 with ASK1 and GAP activity of AIP1 are required for AIP1-enhanced ASK1 activity. The GAP activity of Ras-GAP is known to be critical for regulation of Ras-Raf-ERK activation. The requirement for AIP1 GAP activity in ASK1-JNK activation is supported by the observation that ERK exerts an inhibitory effect on ASK1-JNK signaling. Crosstalk among MAPKs has been well documented: one MAPK (such as ERK) may inhibit or oppose the activation of another MAPK (such as JNK). Many stimuli reciprocally regulate ERK and JNK activation. We have previously shown that atheroprotective laminar flow inhibits TNF-α–induced ASK1-JNK activation, and that laminar flow–induced MEK-ERK activation is required for inhibition of JNK ( 6 , 21 ). Conversely, our data support the notion that ERK inhibition by AIP1 (via GAP activity) may be required for AIP1-enhanced ASK1-JNK activation (Figure 8 ). Our study has established a link between Ras-GAP and the stress-activated ASK1-JNK signaling pathway. It remains to be determined whether recruitment of AIP1 to ASK1 activates the GAP activity of AIP1.

Both TNF-α and TRAF2 overexpression enhance association of AIP1 with ASK1. In contrast, AIP1 overexpression has no effect on TNF-α–induced formation of TRAF2-ASK1 complex, suggesting that AIP1 is downstream of TRAF2 in ASK1 activation. The mechanism by which TNF-α induces unfolding of AIP1 is not clear. The role of TRAF2 in TNF-induced AIP1 unfolding is currently under investigation.

In conclusion, our data show that AIP1 facilitates dissociation of 14-3-3 from ASK1, leading to enhanced ASK1-JNK activation, and suggest that AIP1 is a novel regulator in TNF-α–induced ASK1 activation.
