Glycosylation of beta1 integrin (beta1) in the Golgi complex has been related to 
its function in multiple cell processes, e.g., invasiveness, matrix adhesion, 
and migration. Brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins (BIG) 
1 and BIG2 activate human ADP-ribosylation factors (ARF) 1 and ARF3 by 
catalyzing the replacement of ARF-bound GDP with GTP to regulate Golgi vesicular 
transport. We show here a requirement for BIG1 (but not BIG2) in glycosylation 
and function of beta1. In HepG2 cells treated for 48 or 72 h with BIG1, but not 
BIG2, siRNA, both the amount and electrophoretic mobility of the initially 
130-kDa beta1 were increased. BIG1 content had risen by 48 h after removal of 
BIG1 siRNA, and the faster-migrating, aberrant 130-kDa beta1 was not seen. 
Peptide N-glycosidase F, but not endoglycosidase H, digestion converted all 
beta1 to an approximately 85-kDa (core protein) form. By electron microscopy, 
Golgi membranes in BIG1-depleted cells were less sharply defined than those in 
mock or BIG2 siRNA-treated cells, with more vesicle-like structures at the 
transface. Amounts of active RhoA-GTP also were decreased in such cells and 
restored by overexpression of HA-BIG1. Aberrant beta1 was present on the cell 
surface, but its function in cell spreading, adhesion, and migration was 
impaired. By immunofluorescence microscopy, BIG1 siRNA-treated cells showed less 
spreading and concentration of beta1 at the cell surface. These results indicate 
a previously unrecognized role for BIG1 in the glycosylation of beta1 by Golgi 
enzymes, which is critical for its function in developmental and other vital 
cell processes.
