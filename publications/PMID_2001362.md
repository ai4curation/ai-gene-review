The human T-cell protein cyclophilin shows high affinity for and is the proposed 
target of the major immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A (CsA). Cyclophilin also 
has peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity that is inhibited by CsA with 
an IC50 of 6 nM, while by contrast a homologous PPIase from Escherichia coli has 
been found to be much less sensitive to CsA, shown here to be 500-fold less 
potent at an IC50 of 3000 nM. This E. coli rotamase lacks the single highly 
conserved tryptophan residue of eukaryotic cyclophilins, and we show here that 
mutation of the natural F112 to W112 enhances E. coli rotamase susceptibility to 
CsA inhibition by 23-fold. Correspondingly, the human W121 mutations to F121 or 
A121 yield cyclophilins with 75- and 200-fold decreased sensitivity to CsA, 
while kcat/Km values of rotamase activity in a tetrapeptide assay drop only 2- 
and 13-fold, respectively. This complementary gain and loss of CsA sensitivity 
to mutation to or from tryptophan validate the indole side chain as a major 
determinant in immunosuppressant drug recognition and the separation of PPIase 
catalytic efficiency from CsA affinity.
