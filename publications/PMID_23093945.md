Autophagy is the mechanism by which cytoplasmic components and organelles are 
degraded by the lysosomal machinery in response to diverse stimuli including 
nutrient deprivation, intracellular pathogens, and multiple forms of cellular 
stress. Here, we show that the membrane-associated E3 ligase RNF5 regulates 
basal levels of autophagy by controlling the stability of a select pool of the 
cysteine protease ATG4B. RNF5 controls the membranal fraction of ATG4B and 
limits LC3 (ATG8) processing, which is required for phagophore and autophagosome 
formation. The association of ATG4B with-and regulation of its ubiquitination 
and stability by-RNF5 is seen primarily under normal growth conditions. 
Processing of LC3 forms, appearance of LC3-positive puncta, and p62 expression 
are higher in RNF5(-/-) MEF. RNF5 mutant, which retains its E3 ligase activity 
but does not associate with ATG4B, no longer affects LC3 puncta. Further, 
increased puncta seen in RNF5(-/-) using WT but not LC3 mutant, which bypasses 
ATG4B processing, substantiates the role of RNF5 in early phases of LC3 
processing and autophagy. Similarly, RNF-5 inactivation in Caenorhabditis 
elegans increases the level of LGG-1/LC3::GFP puncta. RNF5(-/-) mice are more 
resistant to group A Streptococcus infection, associated with increased 
autophagosomes and more efficient bacterial clearance by RNF5(-/-) macrophages. 
Collectively, the RNF5-mediated control of membranalATG4B reveals a novel layer 
in the regulation of LC3 processing and autophagy.
