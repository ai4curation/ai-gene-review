Ferritin is a spherical molecule composed of 24 subunits of two types, ferritin 
H chain (FHC) and ferritin L chain (FLC). Ferritin stores iron within cells, but 
it also circulates and binds specifically and saturably to a variety of cell 
types. For most cell types, this binding can be mediated by ferritin composed 
only of FHC (HFt) but not by ferritin composed only of FLC (LFt), indicating 
that binding of ferritin to cells is mediated by FHC but not FLC. By using 
expression cloning, we identified human transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) as an 
important receptor for HFt with little or no binding to LFt. In vitro, HFt can 
be precipitated by soluble TfR1, showing that this interaction is not dependent 
on other proteins. Binding of HFt to TfR1 is partially inhibited by diferric 
transferrin, but it is hindered little, if at all, by HFE. After binding of HFt 
to TfR1 on the cell surface, HFt enters both endosomes and lysosomes. TfR1 
accounts for most, if not all, of the binding of HFt to mitogen-activated T and 
B cells, circulating reticulocytes, and all cell lines that we have studied. The 
demonstration that TfR1 can bind HFt as well as Tf raises the possibility that 
this dual receptor function may coordinate the processing and use of iron by 
these iron-binding molecules.

Abstract

Ferritin is a spherical molecule composed of 24 subunits of two types, ferritin H chain (FHC) and ferritin L chain (FLC). Ferritin stores iron within cells, but it also circulates and binds specifically and saturably to a variety of cell types. For most cell types, this binding can be mediated by ferritin composed only of FHC (HFt) but not by ferritin composed only of FLC (LFt), indicating that binding of ferritin to cells is mediated by FHC but not FLC. By using expression cloning, we identified human transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) as an important receptor for HFt with little or no binding to LFt. In vitro, HFt can be precipitated by soluble TfR1, showing that this interaction is not dependent on other proteins. Binding of HFt to TfR1 is partially inhibited by diferric transferrin, but it is hindered little, if at all, by HFE. After binding of HFt to TfR1 on the cell surface, HFt enters both endosomes and lysosomes. TfR1 accounts for most, if not all, of the binding of HFt to mitogen-activated T and B cells, circulating reticulocytes, and all cell lines that we have studied. The demonstration that TfR1 can bind HFt as well as Tf raises the possibility that this dual receptor function may coordinate the processing and use of iron by these iron-binding molecules.

Discussion

Our studies show that TfR1 serves as a receptor for HFt. Binding occurs in the absence of Tf or HFE and is significantly inhibited by diferric Tf, although not completely. TfR1 accounts for most of the binding of HFt to all cell lines that we have studied, as well as to mitogen-stimulated blood lymphocytes and fresh reticulocytes.

After binding to TfR1, HFt enters not only endosomes but also lysosomes. Other studies have shown that cytoplasmic ferritin similarly reaches lysosomes and that lysosomes may facilitate the release of iron from ferritin ( 29 , 30 ). De Domenico et al. ( 31 ) recently showed that lysosomal degradation of cytosolic ferritin can be by induced by autophagy. Alternatively, cytosolic ferritin can be ubiquitinated and subjected to proteasomal degradation ( 3 , 31 , 32 ). It will be of interest to define the fate of HFt after it reaches lysosomes after endocytosis through TfR1, as well as the fate of iron contained within the HFt.

Konijn and coworkers ( 18 , 19 ) have shown that erythroid precursors can internalize and use iron from HFt in the production of Hb, and this process is blocked by inhibitors of endocytosis ( 18 , 19 ). Our studies show that the binding of HFt to fresh reticulocytes is dependent on TfR1 and that TfR1 mediates endocytosis of HFt as well as diferric Tf. It is, thus, highly likely that binding of HFt to TfR1 on erythroid precursors is required for its use in supplying iron for erythropoiesis.

Anti-TfR1 blocks binding of HFt but not diferric Tf to TfR1, suggesting that the binding sites for HFt and Tf may not be identical. Nonetheless, diferric Tf inhibits binding of HFt to TfR1, indicating either that the binding sites for HFt and Tf overlap or that Tf alters TfR1 in a way that reduces binding by HFt. Reciprocally, high concentrations of HFt partially block binding by diferric Tf to TfR1. This likely explains the observation by Tsunoo and Sussman ( 33 ) over 25 years ago that human placental ferritin or horse splenic ferritin inhibit binding of Tf to placental extracts. We did not observe a significant effect of HFE on binding by HFt to TfR1, unlike its known effect on binding by Tf ( 26 , 34 ). Importantly, neither HFE nor Tf is required for binding by HFt to TfR1; binding of HFt to TfR1 occurs in the absence of either. HFt consists of 24 identical subunits, and TfR1 consists of two identical subunits, so the interactions between these proteins on the cell surface may be complex. We were not able to perform Scatchard analysis of binding by 125 I-HFt, because iodination reduced binding of HFt to TfR1; however, other approaches will be of interest to examine this interaction.

The selective binding by TfR1 of HFt, not LFt, is consistent with prior observations that cell lines and hematopoietic cells selectively bind HFt ( 12 – 17 ). In this regard, it may be noteworthy that the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1α selectively induce transcription of FHC but not FLC through induction of the transcription factor NFkB, thereby increasing the content of the FHC in ferritin ( 5 ). Although an increase in circulating FHC in inflammation has not yet been directly shown, the induction of FHC by inflammatory cytokines suggests the possibility that FHC may serve as a secondary signal in inflammation. Studies to test this can now focus in particular on TfR1.

Because TfR1 seems to bind HFt but not LFt, our findings do not explain prior evidence that human liver cells can bind LFt as well as HFt ( 17 ), and this receptor remains to be identified. In mice, Li et al. ( 35 ) recently identified Scara5 as a receptor for LFt in the developing kidney and showed that this accounted for iron uptake in the absence of TfR1 or TfR2. However, Scara5 is not expressed in liver ( 36 ), and human orthologs have not yet been described.

In mice, we previously identified Tim-2 as a receptor for HFt, but Tim-2 is not expressed in humans ( 21 ). Interestingly, we have so far found no evidence that murine HFt or human HFt binds to murine TfR1, suggesting that these mechanisms for recognition of HFt have diverged between humans and mice. The extracellular domains of mouse and human TfR1 protein are 76% identical at the protein level (86% conserved), but areas of nonhomology are found throughout these domains. We have not yet studied binding by HFt to the more distantly related (but still 46% identical) TfR2.

Of particular relevance to our studies, Li et al. ( 37 ) have recently shown that the human chemokine receptor CXRC4 binds cytosolic FHC in a manner that is dependent on the serine phosphorylation of FHC at position 178. In cells overexpressing CXCR4, its interaction with cytosolic FHC is increased by the internalization of CXCR4 after binding by its ligand CXCL12, and FHC inhibits activation of ERK1/2 by CXCL12 in these cells ( 37 ). This may relate to prior observations by Pham et al. ( 38 ) that showed that FHC inhibits JNK activation by inhibiting ROS. It will be important to determine if HFt imported through the TfR1 can reach the cell compartments where it could contribute to these effects.

The shared use of TfR1 to bind and internalize both Tf and HFt suggests that this pathway may serve to coordinate the uptake and use of iron by these two ligands. Tf binds ferric iron (Fe 3+ ), but in the endosomes of erythrocyte precursors, this is reduced to ferrous iron (Fe 2+ ) by ferroreductases, notably Steap3 ( 39 , 40 ). Thus, ferrous iron would be available for uptake by HFt in endosomes. We have not observed this in preliminary studies, but further studies are in progress. Alternatively, or perhaps additionally, Tf and HFt may serve as redundant mechanisms for the uptake of iron by cells.
