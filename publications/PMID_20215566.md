Retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA) is crucial for germ cell development in the 
testis, as shown by the degenerated testis in Rara gene knockout mice, which are 
sterile. Similarly, FSH is known to regulate Sertoli cell proliferation and 
differentiation, indirectly controlling the quantity of the spermatogenic 
output. Interestingly, FSH inhibited, via activation of FSH receptor, cAMP, and 
protein kinase A (PKA), the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of 
RARA. Given that retinoic acid, the ligand for RARA, is known to regulate cell 
proliferation and differentiation, we investigated whether FSH regulates RARA by 
a direct posttranslational phosphorylation mechanism. Mutagenesis of serine 219 
(S219) and S369 at the PKA sites on RARA to either double alanines or double 
glutamic acids showed that both PKA sites are important for RARA activity. The 
negative charges at the PKA sites, whether they are from glutamic acids or 
phosphorylation of serines, decreased the nuclear localization of RARA, 
heterodimerization with retinoid X receptor-alpha, and the transcriptional 
activity of the receptor. On the other hand, the double-alanine mutant that 
cannot be phosphorylated at the 219 and 369 amino acid positions did not respond 
to cAMP and PKA activation. Wild-type and double-mutant RARA interacted with 
PKA, but only in the presence of cAMP or FSH. These results together suggest 
that FSH may regulate cell proliferation and differentiation of Sertoli cells, 
at least partially, by directly affecting the PKA sites of RARA and controlling 
the transcriptional function of the receptor.
