Tankyrase-1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates the telomere-binding protein TRF1. This 
post-translational modification dissociates TRF1 from telomeres, enhancing 
telomerase-mediated telomere elongation. Tankyrase-1 multimerizes via its 
sterile alpha motif domain, but its functional implication remains elusive. 
Here, we found that excessive amounts of tankyrase-1 form punctate nuclear foci. 
This focus formation depends on both homophilic multimerization and heterophilic 
protein-protein interaction. These foci are functionally dormant because they do 
not efficiently release TRF1 from telomeres. Consistently, hyper-overexpression 
of tankyrase-1 attenuates its ability to elongate telomeres. These observations 
suggest that tankyrase-1 assembly to large protein complexes masks its telomeric 
function.
