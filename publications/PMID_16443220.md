A novel C3G isoform, designated p87C3G, lacking the most amino terminal region 
of the cognate protein has been found to be overexpressed in two CML cell lines, 
K562 and Boff 210, both expressing Bcr-Abl p210. p87C3G expression is also 
highly augmented in patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) Ph+, 
in comparison with healthy individuals, and returns to basal levels after 
treatment with STI571. p87C3G co-immunoprecipitates with both CrkL and Bcr-Abl 
in CML cell lines and co-immunoprecipitation between p87C3G and Bcr-Abl was also 
detected in primary cells from CML patients. These interactions have been 
confirmed by in vitro pull down experiments. The interaction between p87C3G and 
Bcr-Abl involves the SH3-binding domain of p87C3G and the SH3 domain of Abl and 
depends mostly on the first polyproline region of p87C3G. Furthermore, we also 
demonstrated that p87C3G is phosphorylated in vitro by a Bcr-Abl-dependent 
mechanism. These results indicate that p87C3G overexpression is linked to CML 
phenotype and that p87C3G may exert productive functional interactions with 
Bcr-Abl signaling components suggesting the implication of this C3G isoform in 
the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia.
