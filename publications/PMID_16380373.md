Sec14 protein was first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where it serves 
as a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein that is essential for the transport 
of secretory proteins from the Golgi complex. A protein domain homologous to 
Sec14 was identified in several mammalian proteins that regulates Rho GTPases, 
including exchange factors and GTPase activating proteins. P50RhoGAP, the first 
identified GTPase activating protein for Rho GTPases, is composed of a 
Sec14-like domain and a Rho-GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain. The 
biological function of its Sec14-like domain is still unknown. Here we show that 
p50RhoGAP is present on endosomal membranes, where it colocalizes with 
internalized transferrin receptor. We demonstrate that the Sec14-like domain of 
P50RhoGAP is responsible for the endosomal targeting of the protein. We also 
show that overexpression of p50RhoGAP or its Sec14-like domain inhibits 
transferrin uptake. Furthermore, both P50RhoGAP and its Sec14-like domain show 
colocalization with small GTPases Rab11 and Rab5. We measured bioluminescence 
resonance energy transfer between p50RhoGAP and Rab11, indicating that these 
proteins form molecular complex in vivo on endosomal membranes. The interaction 
was mediated by the Sec 14-like domain of p50RhoGAP. Our results indicate that 
Sec14-like domain, which was previously considered as a phospholipid binding 
module, may have a role in the mediation of protein-protein interactions. We 
suggest that p50RhoGAP provides a link between Rab and Rho GTPases in the 
regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis.
