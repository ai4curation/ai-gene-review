This article examines differential expression and heterodimer formation of ErbB 
family members in tumorigenic and nontumorigenic human bronchial epithelial 
cells (HBECs). This cell system was developed previously as a model for lung 
adenocarcinoma by overexpression of c-erbB-2 in nontumorigenic, T 
antigen-immortalized HBECs. Earlier studies demonstrated that a tumorigenic 
clone from T antigen-immortalized nontumorigenic cells overexpressing ErbB-2 
endogenously produced high levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, and 
that reducing TGF-alpha by 93% eliminated tumorigenicity. In the present report, 
comparison of ErbB species between the tumorigenic cells (E6T) and their 
nontumorigenic derivatives (E6TA) demonstrated all four receptors in both cell 
types. However, in E6TA cells, ErbB-3 and -4 were present primarily in ErbB-1 
heterodimers, suggesting that ErbB-1 is a preferred heterodimer partner within 
this cell system, expressing endogenous ErbB receptors and ligands and 
overexpressing ErbB-2. The ErbB-1/-2 species was present at high levels in E6T 
and absent in E6TA cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was elevated 
in E6T relative to E6TA. Elevated activity was eliminated by blocking surface 
expression of either ErbB-1 or ErbB-2. Endoplasmic reticulum trapping of ErbB-1 
eliminated tumorigenicity, whereas ErbB-2 internalization was selected against 
during tumor formation. These data demonstrate the importance of 
TGF-alpha-mediated signaling through the ErbB-1/-2 heterodimer in development of 
the tumorigenic phenotype. This work further suggests that ErbB-3 and -4 species 
may also contribute to tumorigenic conversion and that their expression levels 
may be increased by signaling initiated by TGF-alpha.
