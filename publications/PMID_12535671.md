The Hairy-related bHLH proteins function as transcriptional repressors in most 
cases and play important roles in diverse aspects of metazoan development. 
Recently, it was shown that the Drosophila bHLH repressor proteins, Hairy and 
Deadpan, bind to and function with the NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase, 
Sir2. Here we demonstrate that the human Sir2 homologue, SIRT1, also physically 
associates with the human bHLH repressor proteins, hHES1 and hHEY2, both in 
vitro and in vivo. Moreover, using the reporter assay, we show that both 
SIRT1-dependent and -independent deacetylase pathways are involved in the 
transcriptional repressions mediated by these bHLH repressors. These results 
indicate that the molecular association between bHLH proteins and Sir2-related 
proteins is conserved among metazoans, from Drosophila to human, and suggest 
that the Sir2-bHLH interaction also plays important roles in human cells.
