Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an underdiagnosed cause of 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) that usually presents in young female patients. 
Risk factors include female sex, physical and emotional stressors, and 
fibromuscular dysplasia, and diagnosis is usually made by coronary angiography 
aided by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or optical coherence tomography (OCT). 
While conservative treatment is usually preferred over percutaneous coronary 
intervention or surgery, medical management of SCAD has been under debate. This 
comprehensive review aims to summarize findings from recent studies exploring 
various medical treatment approaches for the management of SCAD. Antiplatelet 
therapy with aspirin is generally safe and beneficial for SCAD patients, with 
dual antiplatelet (DAPT) being recommended for patients undergoing PCI. In the 
absence of intervention, DAPT may be given for a short period followed by a 
longer single-antiplatelet (SAPT) therapy with aspirin. Beta-blockers appear to 
be safe and effective for SCAD patients. On the other hand, fibrinolytics, 
anticoagulants, and glycoprotein IIa/IIIb inhibitors are contraindicated. 
Cardiovascular medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and statins are not 
recommended in the absence of left ventricular dysfunction. Hormonal therapy is 
contraindicated for patients who develop SCAD during pregnancy and future 
pregnancy is discouraged in that patient population.
