Mammalian centrioles play a dynamic role in centrosome function, but they also 
have the capacity to nucleate the assembly of cilia. Although controls must 
exist to specify these different fates, the key regulators remain largely 
undefined. We have purified complexes associated with CP110, a protein that 
plays an essential role in centrosome duplication and cytokinesis, and have 
identified a previously uncharacterized protein, Cep97, that recruits CP110 to 
centrosomes. Depletion of Cep97 or expression of dominant-negative mutants 
results in CP110 disappearance from centrosomes, spindle defects, and 
polyploidy. Remarkably, loss of Cep97 or CP110 promotes primary cilia formation 
in growing cells, and enforced expression of CP110 in quiescent cells suppresses 
their ability to assemble cilia, suggesting that Cep97 and CP110 collaborate to 
inhibit a ciliogenesis program. Identification of Cep97 and other genes involved 
in regulation of cilia assembly may accelerate our understanding of human 
ciliary diseases, including renal disease and retinal degeneration.
