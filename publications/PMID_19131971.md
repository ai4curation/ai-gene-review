Expression of the c-Myc proto-oncoprotein is tightly regulated in normal cells. 
Phosphorylation at two conserved residues, threonine58 (T58) and serine62 (S62), 
regulates c-Myc protein stability. In cancer cells, c-Myc can become aberrantly 
stabilized associated with altered T58 and S62 phosphorylation. A complex 
signalling cascade involving GSK3beta kinase, the Pin1 prolyl isomerase, and the 
PP2A-B56alpha phosphatase controls phosphorylation at these sites. We report 
here a novel role for the tumour suppressor scaffold protein Axin1 in 
facilitating the formation of a degradation complex for c-Myc containing 
GSK3beta, Pin1, and PP2A-B56alpha. Although knockdown of Axin1 decreases the 
association of c-Myc with these proteins, reduces T58 and enhances S62 
phosphorylation, and increases c-Myc stability, acute expression of Axin1 
reduces c-Myc levels and suppresses c-Myc transcriptional activity. Moreover, 
the regulation of c-Myc by Axin1 is impaired in several tested cancer cell lines 
with known stabilization of c-Myc or loss of Axin1. This study provides critical 
insight into the regulation of c-Myc expression, how this can be disrupted in 
three cancer types, and adds to our knowledge of the tumour suppressor activity 
of Axin1.

Abstract

Expression of the c-Myc proto-oncoprotein is tightly regulated in normal cells. Phosphorylation at two conserved residues, threonine58 (T58) and serine62 (S62), regulates c-Myc protein stability. In cancer cells, c-Myc can become aberrantly stabilized associated with altered T58 and S62 phosphorylation. A complex signalling cascade involving GSK3β kinase, the Pin1 prolyl isomerase, and the PP2A-B56α phosphatase controls phosphorylation at these sites. We report here a novel role for the tumour suppressor scaffold protein Axin1 in facilitating the formation of a degradation complex for c-Myc containing GSK3β, Pin1, and PP2A-B56α. Although knockdown of Axin1 decreases the association of c-Myc with these proteins, reduces T58 and enhances S62 phosphorylation, and increases c-Myc stability, acute expression of Axin1 reduces c-Myc levels and suppresses c-Myc transcriptional activity. Moreover, the regulation of c-Myc by Axin1 is impaired in several tested cancer cell lines with known stabilization of c-Myc or loss of Axin1. This study provides critical insight into the regulation of c-Myc expression, how this can be disrupted in three cancer types, and adds to our knowledge of the tumour suppressor activity of Axin1.

Introduction

c-Myc is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation, growth, apoptosis, and differentiation ( Dang et al , 1999 ). Normal cell function requires proper regulation of c-Myc expression, which occurs at multiple levels through transcriptional, translational, and post-translational mechanisms. Recent research has identified a complex signalling pathway that controls c-Myc protein expression at the post-translational level through sequential and reversible phosphorylation at two highly conserved sites, t hreonine 58 (T58) and s erine 62 (S62), that regulate ubiquitination and 26S proteasomal turnover of c-Myc (reviewed in Sears, 2004 ). Specifically, S62 phosphorylation increases c-Myc protein stability, whereas T58 phosphorylation stimulates its ubiquitination and degradation by the SCF Fbw7 complex ( Sears et al , 2000 ; Welcker et al , 2004 ; Yada et al , 2004 ). A number of reports have identified GSK3β, the prolyl isomerase Pin1, and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) with the associated B56α regulatory subunit as critical components in c-Myc protein turnover as GSK3β mediates T58 phosphorylation and Pin1 and PP2A-B56α cooperate to dephosphorylate S62 ( Sears et al , 2000 ; Gregory et al , 2003 ; Yeh et al , 2004 ; Arnold and Sears, 2006 ).

Axin1 is a multi-domain scaffold protein that coordinates several different protein complexes that are involved in regulating Wnt, TGFβ, SAPK/JNK, and p53 signalling ( Zeng et al , 1997 ; Zhang et al , 1999 ; Rui et al , 2004 ; Liu et al , 2006 ). Thus far Axin1 has been characterized to be a tumour suppressor and numerous gene mutations have been identified throughout AXIN1 from a number of different cancers ( Salahshor and Woodgett, 2005 ). These mutations most likely compromise the ability of Axin1 to form complexes with DVL, MEKK, GSK3α/β, PP2A, APC, β-catenin, and even Axin1 with itself (summarized in Salahshor and Woodgett, 2005 ). It has been shown in some cases of h epato c ellular c arcinomas (HCCs) harbouring mutations in AXIN1 that re-introduction of wild-type Axin1 expression increases apoptosis ( Satoh et al , 2000 ), suggesting that Axin1 may be an important molecular target in HCC as well as other cancers with compromised Axin1 function.

We now report an additional regulatory role for Axin1 in negatively controlling c-Myc protein levels at the post-translational level. Axin1 facilitates the interaction of c-Myc with GSK3β, PP2A, and Pin1, stimulates c-Myc ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and inhibits c-Myc transcriptional activity. Interestingly, several cancer cell lines with increased c-Myc stability have impaired formation of the Axin1–c-Myc degradation complex. Altogether, our results add to our understanding of the regulation of c-Myc expression and provide a new mechanism for the tumour suppressor activity of Axin1.

Discussion

The regulation of c-Myc expression at the post-translational level involves a number of proteins, which sequentially modify the phosphorylation status of c-Myc on the conserved T58 and S62 residues ( Sears, 2004 ; Escamilla-Powers and Sears, 2007 ). To date, we have focused on the signalling pathways that activate or repress the activity of these proteins. It is now becoming clear that signalling pathways are regulated by the coordination of proteins into complexes by multi-domain scaffold proteins. We previously characterized critical roles for GSK3β, PP2A-B56α, and Pin1 in promoting c-Myc protein turnover ( Sears et al , 2000 ; Yeh et al , 2004 ; Arnold and Sears, 2006 ). We report here that the scaffold protein Axin1 facilitates the association of GSK3β, PP2A-B56α, and Pin1 with c-Myc, which negatively regulates c-Myc protein expression and transcriptional activity. Our findings expand our understanding of the regulation of c-Myc and provide a new important target for the tumour suppressor activity of Axin1.
