Many patients with anemia fail to respond to treatment with erythropoietin 
(Epo), a commonly used hormone that stimulates erythroid progenitor production 
and maturation by human BM or by murine spleen. The protein product of growth 
arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) is important for cell survival across several cell 
types, but its precise physiological role remains largely enigmatic. Here, we 
report that murine erythroblasts released Gas6 in response to Epo and that Gas6 
enhanced Epo receptor signaling by activating the serine-threonine kinase Akt in 
these cells. In the absence of Gas6, erythroid progenitors and erythroblasts 
were hyporesponsive to the survival activity of Epo and failed to restore 
hematocrit levels in response to anemia. In addition, Gas6 may influence 
erythropoiesis via paracrine erythroblast-independent mechanisms involving 
macrophages. When mice with acute anemia were treated with Gas6, the protein 
normalized hematocrit levels without causing undesired erythrocytosis. In a 
transgenic mouse model of chronic anemia caused by insufficient Epo production, 
Gas6 synergized with Epo in restoring hematocrit levels. These findings may have 
implications for the treatment of patients with anemia who fail to adequately 
respond to Epo.
