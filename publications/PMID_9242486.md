Cdc37 is required for cyclin-dependent kinase activation and is genetically 
linked with the activity of several other kinases, including oncogenic v-Src, 
casein kinase II, MPS-1 kinase, and sevenless. Strikingly, many pathways 
involving Cdc37 also involve the protein chaperone Hsp90. The identification of 
Cdc37 as the 50-kD protein in several Hsp90-kinase complexes, together with 
other data, led to the recent suggestion that Cdc37 is a kinase-targeting 
"subunit" of Hsp90. We directly examined the effect of Cdc37 on Hsp90 functions. 
Rather than simply acting as an accessory factor for Hsp90, Cdc37 is itself a 
protein chaperone with properties remarkably similar to those of Hsp90. In 
vitro, Cdc37 maintains denatured beta-galactosidase in an activation-competent 
state without reactivating it and stabilizes mature, but unstable, casein kinase 
II. In vivo, Cdc37 overexpression can compensate for decreased Hsp90 function, 
but the proteins are not interchangeable. Cdc37 can compensate for Hsp90 in 
maintaining the activity of v-Src kinase but does not maintain the activity of 
the glucocorticoid receptor. Thus, the very similar chaperone activities of the 
two proteins, uncovered through in vitro analysis, diverge in vivo in specific 
signal transduction pathways.
