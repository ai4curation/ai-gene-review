Hydroxypyruvate reductase was purified to homogeneity from the facultative 
methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. It has a molecular mass of about 
71 kDa, and it consists of two identical subunits with a molecular mass of about 
37 kDa. This enzyme uses both NADH (Km = 0.04 mM) and NADPH (Km = 0.06 mM) as 
cofactors, uses hydroxypyruvate (Km = 0.1 mM) and glyoxylate (Km = 1.5 mM) as 
the only substrates for the forward reaction, and carries out the reverse 
reaction with glycerate (Km = 2.6 mM) only. It was not possible to detect the 
conversion of glycolate to glyoxylate, a proposed role for this enzyme. Kinetics 
and inhibitory studies of the enzyme from M. extorquens AM1 suggest that 
hydroxypyruvate reductase is not a site for regulation of the serine cycle at 
the level of enzyme activity.
