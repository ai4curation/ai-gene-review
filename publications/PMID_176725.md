Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in man-rodent somatic cell 
hybrids.

Bruns GA, Gerald PS.

The human enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) forms 
heteropolymers with the rodent enzyme in man-rodent somatic cell hybrids. A gene 
specifying GAPDH is syntenic with the genes specifying the glycolytic enzymes 
triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) and lactate dehydrogenase B (LDH-B). The synteny 
of GAPDH, TPI, and LDH-B is the first evidence for the syntenic association of 
human genes that specify enzymes of the Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic pathway.
