In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one determinant of aging or life span is 
the accumulation of extrachromosomal copies of rDNA circles in old mother cells 
[1]. The production of rDNA circles depends upon intrachromosomal recombination 
within the rDNA tandem array, a process regulated by the protein Sir2 (Sir2p). 
Together with Sir1p, Sir3p, Sir4p and Orc1p, Sir2p is also involved in 
transcriptional silencing of genes at the silent mating-type cassettes, in the 
rDNA array, and at telomeres. Using a 'triple silencer' strain that can monitor 
an increase or decrease in gene expression at these three loci, we found that 
deletion of the ZDS1 gene caused an increase in silencing in the rDNA and at a 
silent mating-type cassette at the expense of telomere silencing. The zds1 
deletion also resulted in an increase in life span and a decrease in Sir3p 
phosphorylation. In contrast, deletion of its paralog ZDS2 caused a decrease in 
rDNA silencing, a decrease in life span and an increase in Sir3p 
phosphorylation. As Zds2p, but not Zds1p, had strong two-hybrid interactions 
with Orc1p and the four Sir proteins, Zds1p might indirectly control Sir3p 
through a Sir3p kinase.
