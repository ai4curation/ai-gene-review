Telomerase is a multisubunit ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that adds telomere 
repeats to the ends of chromosomes. Three essential telomerase components have 
been identified thus far: the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), the 
telomerase RNA component (TERC), and the TERC-binding protein dyskerin. Few 
other proteins are known to be required for human telomerase function, limiting 
our understanding of both telomerase regulation and mechanisms of telomerase 
action. Here, we identify the ATPases pontin and reptin as telomerase components 
through affinity purification of TERT from human cells. Pontin interacts 
directly with both TERT and dyskerin, and the amount of TERT bound to pontin and 
reptin peaks in S phase, evidence for cell-cycle-dependent regulation of TERT. 
Depletion of pontin and reptin markedly impairs telomerase RNP accumulation, 
indicating an essential role in telomerase assembly. These findings reveal an 
unanticipated requirement for additional enzymes in telomerase biogenesis and 
suggest alternative approaches for inhibiting telomerase in cancer.
