Zfp148 belongs to a large family of C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factors. 
Zfp148 is expressed in fetal germ cells in 13.5-d-old (E13.5) mouse embryos. 
Germ-line transmission of mutations were not observed in chimeric Zfp148(+/-) 
mice, and some of these mice completely lacked spermatogonia. The number of 
primordial germ cells in Zfp148(+/-) tetraploid embryos was normal until E11.5, 
but declined from E11.5 to E13.5 and continued to decline until few germ cells 
were present at E18.5. This phenotype was not rescued by wild-type Sertoli or 
stromal cells, and is therefore a cell-autonomous phenotype. These results 
indicate that two functional alleles of Zfp148 are required for the normal 
development of fetal germ cells. Recent studies have shown that Zfp148 activates 
p53, which has an important role in cell-cycle regulation. Primordial germ cells 
stop proliferating at approximately E13.5, which correlates with induction of 
phosphorylation of p53 and its translocation to the nucleus. Phosphorylation of 
p53 is impaired in Zfp148(+/-) embryonic stem cells and in fetal germ cells from 
chimeric Zfp148(+/-) embryos. Thus, Zfp148 may be required for regulating p53 in 
the development of germ cells.
