Legionella pneumophila (L.p.), the microbe responsible for Legionnaires' 
disease, secretes ∼300 bacterial proteins into the host cell cytosol. A subset 
of these proteins affects a wide range of post-translational modifications 
(PTMs) to disrupt host cellular pathways. L.p. has 5 conserved eukaryotic-like 
Ser/Thr effector kinases, LegK1-4 and LegK7, which are translocated during 
infection. Using a chemical genetic screen, we identified the Hsp70 chaperone 
family as a direct host target of LegK4. Phosphorylation of Hsp70s at T495 in 
the substrate-binding domain disrupted Hsp70's ATPase activity and greatly 
inhibited its protein folding capacity. Phosphorylation of cytosolic Hsp70 by 
LegK4 resulted in global translation inhibition and an increase in the amount of 
Hsp70 on highly translating polysomes. LegK4's ability to inhibit host 
translation via a single PTM uncovers a role for Hsp70 in protein synthesis and 
directly links it to the cellular translational machinery.
