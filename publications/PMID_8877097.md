The fte-1 gene, previously cloned in our laboratory as a putative v-fos 
transformation effector gene (C.J. Kho and H. Zarbl, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 
89: 2200-2204, 1992), has been shown to encode ribosomal protein S3a. Comparison 
of fte-1 expression in a variety of normal and transformed cells indicated that 
elevated expression of fte-1 mRNA was frequently associated with transformation 
of rodent and human cells. In an effort to understand how monoallelic disruption 
of fte-1 is able to block v-fos-induced cell transformation, we examined the 
pattern of fte-1 expression during cell cycle progression and determined its 
effects on protein synthesis and cell growth. In synchronously cultured human 
fibroblasts, fte-1 mRNA was found to accumulate in cells undergoing DNA 
synthesis, suggesting that its expression is correlated with S-phase 
progression. fte-1 does not function as a dominant oncogene because ectopic 
overexpression of fte-1 in normal Rat-1 fibroblasts failed to induce cell 
transformation. However, the expression of antisense fte-1 resulted in growth 
inhibition. Monoallelic disruption of the fte-1 gene in v-fos-transformed Rat-1 
fibroblasts resulted not only in loss of the transformed phenotype but also in a 
decreased rate of protein synthesis due to decreased polysome formation. Taken 
together, these results indicate that the accumulation of ribosomal subunits and 
the rate of protein synthesis are important modulators of neoplastic 
transformation and cell growth.
