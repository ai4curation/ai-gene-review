Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common cause of liver 
cirrhosis and cancer. We performed RNA sequencing in primary human hepatocytes 
activated with synthetic double-stranded RNA to mimic HCV infection. Upstream of 
IFNL3 (IL28B) on chromosome 19q13.13, we discovered a new transiently induced 
region that harbors a dinucleotide variant ss469415590 (TT or ΔG), which is in 
high linkage disequilibrium with rs12979860, a genetic marker strongly 
associated with HCV clearance. ss469415590[ΔG] is a frameshift variant that 
creates a novel gene, designated IFNL4, encoding the interferon-λ4 protein 
(IFNL4), which is moderately similar to IFNL3. Compared to rs12979860, 
ss469415590 is more strongly associated with HCV clearance in individuals of 
African ancestry, although it provides comparable information in Europeans and 
Asians. Transient overexpression of IFNL4 in a hepatoma cell line induced STAT1 
and STAT2 phosphorylation and the expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Our 
findings provide new insights into the genetic regulation of HCV clearance and 
its clinical management.
