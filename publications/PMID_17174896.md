The RNA exosome is a multisubunit 3' to 5' exoribonuclease complex that 
participates in degradation and processing of cellular RNA. To determine the 
activities and structure of the eukaryotic exosome, we report the reconstitution 
of 9-subunit exosomes from yeast and human and reconstitution of 10- and 
11-subunit exosomes from yeast. Comparative biochemical analysis between 
purified subunits and reconstituted exosomes using AU-rich, polyadenylated 
(poly[A]), generic, and structured RNA substrates reveals processive 
phosphorolytic activities for human Rrp41/Rrp45 and the 9-subunit human exosome, 
processive hydrolytic activities for yeast Rrp44 and the yeast 10-subunit 
exosome, distributive hydrolytic activities for Rrp6, and processive and 
distributive hydrolytic activities for the yeast 11-subunit exosome. To 
elucidate the architecture of a eukaryotic exosome, its conserved surfaces, and 
the structural basis for RNA decay, we report the X-ray structure determination 
for the 286 kDa nine-subunit human exosome at 3.35 A.
