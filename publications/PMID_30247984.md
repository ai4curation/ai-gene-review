Hemochromatosis is a frequent genetic disorder, characterized by the 
accumulation of excess iron across tissues. Mutations in the FPN1 gene, encoding 
a cell surface iron exporter [ferroportin (Fpn)], are responsible for 
hemochromatosis type 4, also known as ferroportin disease. Recently, Fpn has 
been implicated in the regulation of manganese (Mn), another essential nutrient 
required for numerous cellular enzymes. However, the roles of Fpn in Mn 
regulation remain ill-defined, and the impact of disease mutations on cellular 
Mn levels is unknown. Here, we provide evidence that Fpn can export Mn from 
cells into extracellular space. Fpn seems to play protective roles in Mn-induced 
cellular toxicity and oxidative stress. Finally, disease mutations interfere 
with the role of Fpn in controlling Mn levels as well as the stability of Fpn. 
These results define the function of Fpn as an exporter of both iron and Mn and 
highlight the potential involvement of Mn dysregulation in ferroportin 
disease.-Choi, E.-K., Nguyen, T.-T., Iwase, S., Seo, Y. A. Ferroportin disease
