Alzheimer's disease constitutes a rising threat to public health. Despite 
extensive research in cellular and animal models, identifying the pathogenic 
agent present in the human brain and showing that it confers key features of 
Alzheimer's disease has not been achieved. We extracted soluble amyloid-beta 
protein (Abeta) oligomers directly from the cerebral cortex of subjects with 
Alzheimer's disease. The oligomers potently inhibited long-term potentiation 
(LTP), enhanced long-term depression (LTD) and reduced dendritic spine density 
in normal rodent hippocampus. Soluble Abeta from Alzheimer's disease brain also 
disrupted the memory of a learned behavior in normal rats. These various effects 
were specifically attributable to Abeta dimers. Mechanistically, metabotropic 
glutamate receptors were required for the LTD enhancement, and N-methyl 
D-aspartate receptors were required for the spine loss. Co-administering 
antibodies to the Abeta N-terminus prevented the LTP and LTD deficits, whereas 
antibodies to the midregion or C-terminus were less effective. Insoluble amyloid 
plaque cores from Alzheimer's disease cortex did not impair LTP unless they were 
first solubilized to release Abeta dimers, suggesting that plaque cores are 
largely inactive but sequester Abeta dimers that are synaptotoxic. We conclude 
that soluble Abeta oligomers extracted from Alzheimer's disease brains potently 
impair synapse structure and function and that dimers are the smallest 
synaptotoxic species.
