Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was the first human DNA virus to be associated with 
cancer. Its oncogenic potential was further demonstrated by its ability to 
transform primary B lymphocytes in vitro. EBV nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) is one 
of a small subset of latent antigens critical for the transformation of human 
primary B lymphocytes. Although EBNA3C has been shown to modulate several 
cellular functions, additional targets involved in cellular transformation 
remain to be explored. EBNA3C can recruit key components of the SCF(Skp2) 
ubiquitin ligase complex. In this report, we show that EBNA3C residues 130 to 
190, previously shown to bind to the SCF(Skp2) complex, also can strongly 
associate with the c-Myc oncoprotein. Additionally, the interaction of EBNA3C 
with c-Myc was mapped to the region of c-Myc that includes the highly conserved 
Skp2 binding domain. Skp2 has been shown to regulate c-Myc stability and also 
has been shown to function as a coactivator of transcription for c-Myc target 
genes. We now show that the EBV latent oncoprotein EBNA3C can stabilize c-Myc 
and that the recruitment of both c-Myc and its cofactor Skp2 to c-Myc-dependent 
promoters can enhance c-Myc-dependent transcription. This same region of EBNA3C 
also recruits and modulates the activity of retinoblastoma and p27, both major 
regulators of the mammalian cell cycle. The inclusion of c-Myc in the group of 
cellular targets modulated by this domain further accentuates the importance of 
these critical residues of EBNA3C in bypassing the cell cycle checkpoints.

Abstract

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was the first human DNA virus to be associated with cancer. Its oncogenic potential was further demonstrated by its ability to transform primary B lymphocytes in vitro. EBV nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) is one of a small subset of latent antigens critical for the transformation of human primary B lymphocytes. Although EBNA3C has been shown to modulate several cellular functions, additional targets involved in cellular transformation remain to be explored. EBNA3C can recruit key components of the SCF Skp2 ubiquitin ligase complex. In this report, we show that EBNA3C residues 130 to 190, previously shown to bind to the SCF Skp2 complex, also can strongly associate with the c-Myc oncoprotein. Additionally, the interaction of EBNA3C with c-Myc was mapped to the region of c-Myc that includes the highly conserved Skp2 binding domain. Skp2 has been shown to regulate c-Myc stability and also has been shown to function as a coactivator of transcription for c-Myc target genes. We now show that the EBV latent oncoprotein EBNA3C can stabilize c-Myc and that the recruitment of both c-Myc and its cofactor Skp2 to c-Myc-dependent promoters can enhance c-Myc-dependent transcription. This same region of EBNA3C also recruits and modulates the activity of retinoblastoma and p27, both major regulators of the mammalian cell cycle. The inclusion of c-Myc in the group of cellular targets modulated by this domain further accentuates the importance of these critical residues of EBNA3C in bypassing the cell cycle checkpoints.

DISCUSSION

A great deal of attention has been focused on c-Myc translocation to the immunoglobulin G loci in Burkitt lymphoma and its consequent amplification. This translocation was only the second genetic aberration associated with cancer, and at the time it underscored the importance of c-Myc in tumorigenesis and in EBV biology ( 26 ). Since then, it has been reported that, in most Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, not only is c-Myc amplified but it also is stabilized due to mutations in conserved c-Myc degron 1 at T48 ( 10 ). These observations, however, do not provide any clear insights on the ability of EBV to transform B lymphocytes in vitro. In most such cases of in vitro transformation, it is reasonable to assume that c-Myc is wild type and not amplified. A few viral proteins ostensibly are able to transform these cells. It is conceivable, then, that the virus has other modes of regulating c-Myc that come to the fore in these cells carrying the wild-type c-Myc allele.

EBNA3C is one of the four EBV proteins that are critical for the transformation of B lymphocytes in vitro ( 37 ). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of EBNA3C to target cell cycle regulators, resulting in the deregulation of the mammalian cell cycle ( 21 - 24 , 32 ). EBNA3C targets the key cell cycle regulators p27 and pRb by recruiting components of the SCF Skp2 ubiquitin ligase and facilitating the degradation of these inhibitors of the mammalian cell cycle ( 21 , 23 ). In this report, we investigated the role of EBNA3C in regulating another key component of the mammalian cell cycle control, c-Myc ( 15 ). Like p27 and pRb, c-Myc also is a target of the SCF Skp2 complex ( 31 ). Unlike p27 and pRb, however, the association of c-Myc with SCF Skp2 is somewhat more complex. Not only has Skp2 been shown to regulate the stability of c-Myc but it also is a cofactor in the c-Myc-regulated transcription of its target genes ( 12 , 17 , 46 ).

Our results show that c-Myc binds to EBNA3C. EBNA3C associates with c-Myc via the same domain, amino acids 130 to 190, that has been implicated in recruiting the SCF Skp2 complex. Residues of c-Myc that associate with EBNA3C overlap those that have been shown to bind Skp2. It is possible, then, that EBNA3C recruits both c-Myc and its transcriptional cofactor Skp2 to the same domain, thus bringing them together and facilitating c-Myc-regulated transcription. Indeed, we find that EBNA3C can modulate transcription from the promoter of a well-known c-Myc target gene, the telomerase reverse transcriptase. Whether EBNA3C can bind to the promoter via c-Myc or requires additional factors currently is under investigation in our laboratory. Recent reports on human papillomavirus E7, which also recruits the SCF Skp2 complex and similarly regulates the stability of p27 and pRb, have shown that E7 also binds to c-Myc and promotes its transcriptional activity ( 47 ).

Previous data from our laboratory show that the recruitment of SCF Skp2 by EBNA3C leads to the degradation of targets of the ubiquitin ligase complex ( 23 , 24 ). Paradoxically, here we found that EBNA3C enhances the stability of c-Myc. A possible explanation for this might be that the ubiquitylation of c-Myc by SCF Skp2 is necessary for transcriptional activation by c-Myc ( 17 , 45 , 46 ). The coupling of ubiquitylation and transcription under normal circumstances ensures rapid degradation after the G 1 /S transition and acts as a safety mechanism to ensure that cells do not continuously cycle ( 44 ). Whether the lysine residues that are involved in transcriptional activation and degradation are unique or the same remains an open question. The exact mechanism of how EBNA3C disrupts this coupling of ubiquitylation/degradation and the specific lysine residues involved in each currently is under investigation in our laboratory.

This work constitutes an initial report showing the modulation of c-Myc activity by EBNA3C. We believe this report points to a possible mechanism of c-Myc deregulation in EBV-infected cells that does not involve chromosomal translocation or amplification. This work also underscores the importance of the EBNA3C region of amino acids 130 to 190 in cell cycle deregulation. Further elucidation of the mechanism by which EBNA3C is able to deregulate c-Myc would not only be important for understanding EBV pathogenesis but also would shed light on mammalian cell cycle control.
