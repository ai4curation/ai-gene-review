Bestrophin-1 (Best1) is a Cl(-) channel that is linked to various retinopathies 
in both humans and dogs. Dysfunction of the Best1 Cl(-) channel has been 
proposed to cause retinopathy because of altered Cl(-) transport across the 
retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In addition to Cl(-), many Cl(-) channels also 
transport HCO3(-). Because HCO3(-) is physiologically important in pH regulation 
and in fluid and ion transport across the RPE, we measured the permeability and 
conductance of bestrophins to HCO3(-) relative to Cl(-). Four human bestrophin 
homologs (hBest1, hBest2, hBest3, and hBest4) and mouse Best2 (mBest2) were 
expressed in HEK cells, and the relative HCO3(-) permeability (P HCO3/PCl) and 
conductance (G HCO3/GCl) were determined. P HCO3/PCl was calculated from the 
change in reversal potential (Erev) produced by replacing extracellular Cl(-) 
with HCO3(-). hBest1 was highly permeable to HCO3(-) (P HCO3)/PCl = 
approximately 0.44). hBest2, hBest4, and mBest2 had an even higher relative 
HCO3(-) permeability (P HCO3/PCl = 0.6-0.7). All four bestrophins had HCO3(-) 
conductances that were nearly the same as Cl(-) (G HCO3/GCl = 0.9-1.1). 
Extracellular Na+ did not affect the permeation of hBest1 to HCO3(-). At 
physiological HCO3(-) concentration, HCO3(-) was also highly conductive. The 
hBest1 disease-causing mutations Y85H, R92C, and W93C abolished both Cl(-) and 
HCO3(-) currents equally. The V78C mutation changed P HCO3/PCl and G HCO3/GCl of 
mBest2 channels. These results raise the possibility that disease-causing 
mutations in hBest1 produce disease by altering HCO3(-) homeostasis as well as 
Cl(-) transport in the retina.
