Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), a heterotrimeric guanosine 
triphosphatase, has a central role in protein biosynthesis by supplying 
methionylated initiator tRNA to the ribosomal translation initiation complex and 
by serving as a target for translational control in response to stress. Recent 
work identified a novel step indispensable for eIF2 function: assembly of eIF2 
from its three subunits by the cell proliferation protein Cdc123. We report the 
first crystal structure of a Cdc123 representative, that from 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, both isolated and bound to domain III of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae eIF2γ. The structures show that Cdc123 resembles 
enzymes of the ATP-grasp family. Indeed, Cdc123 binds ATP-Mg(2+), and conserved 
residues contacting ATP-Mg(2+) are essential for Cdc123 to support eIF2 assembly 
and cell viability. A docking of eIF2αγ onto Cdc123, combined with genetic and 
biochemical experiments, allows us to propose a model explaining how Cdc123 
participates in the biogenesis of eIF2 through facilitating assembly of eIF2γ to 
eIF2α.
