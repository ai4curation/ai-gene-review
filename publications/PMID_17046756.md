Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with plaque deposition in the brain of AD 
patients. The major component of the aggregate is a 39-42 long peptide termed 
beta-amyloid (Abeta). Except for Abeta, plaques contain several other components 
which co-precipitate together with Abeta. One such component is the small heat 
shock protein (sHSP) alphaB-crystallin. Instead of preventing the cell from the 
neurotoxicity of Abeta, alphaB-crystallin induces an increased neurotoxicity. We 
find - using solution state NMR spectroscopy - that alphaB-crystallin competes 
efficiently for Abeta monomer-monomer interactions. Interactions between Abeta 
and alphaB-crystallin involve the hydrophobic core residues 17-21 as well as 
residues 31-32 of Abeta, and thus the same chemical groups which are important 
for Abeta aggregation. In the presence of alphaB-crystallin, Met35 in Abeta 
becomes efficiently oxidized. In order to quantify the redox properties of the 
different complexes consisting of Abeta/alphaB-crystallin/copper, we suggest an 
NMR assay which allows to estimate the electrochemical properties indirectly by 
monitoring the rate of glutathion (GSH) auto-oxidation. The oxidation of the 
side chain Met35 in Abeta might account for the increased neurotoxicity and the 
inability of Abeta to form fibrillar structures, which has been observed 
previously in the presence of alphaB-crystallin [Stege, G.J. et al. (1999) The 
molecular chaperone alphaB-crystallin enhances amyloid-beta neurotoxicity.
