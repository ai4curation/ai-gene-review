Studying viral-host protein-protein interactions can facilitate the discovery of 
therapies for viral infection. We use high-throughput yeast two-hybrid 
experiments and mass spectrometry to generate a comprehensive SARS-CoV-2-human 
protein-protein interactome network consisting of 739 high-confidence binary and 
co-complex interactions, validating 218 known SARS-CoV-2 host factors and 
revealing 361 novel ones. Our results show the highest overlap of interaction 
partners between published datasets and of genes differentially expressed in 
samples from COVID-19 patients. We identify an interaction between the viral 
protein ORF3a and the human transcription factor ZNF579, illustrating a direct 
viral impact on host transcription. We perform network-based screens of >2,900 
FDA-approved or investigational drugs and identify 23 with significant network 
proximity to SARS-CoV-2 host factors. One of these drugs, carvedilol, shows 
clinical benefits for COVID-19 patients in an electronic health records analysis 
and antiviral properties in a human lung cell line infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our 
study demonstrates the value of network systems biology to understand 
human-virus interactions and provides hits for further research on COVID-19 
therapeutics.
