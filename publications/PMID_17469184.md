OBJECTIVE: The principal effect of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) 
on mesenchymal cells is its stimulation of extracellular matrix synthesis. 
Previous reports indicated the significance of the autocrine TGFbeta loop in the 
pathogenesis of scleroderma. The aim of this study was to examine c-Ski and 
SnoN, principal molecules in the negative regulation of TGFbeta signaling, to 
further understand the autocrine TGFbeta loop in scleroderma.
METHODS: Levels of expression of c-Ski/SnoN on cultured normal and scleroderma 
fibroblasts were determined by Western blotting, Northern blotting, and 
immunohistochemical staining. To determine the protein-protein interaction 
between c-Ski/SnoN, Smads, and p300, immunoprecipitation was performed. A 
transient transfection assay was performed to measure promoter activity of the 
alpha2(I) collagen gene and the 3TP-Lux plasmid construct.
RESULTS: Scleroderma fibroblasts exhibited increased c-Ski/SnoN levels compared 
with normal fibroblasts, both in vivo and in vitro. Although c-Ski/SnoN 
constitutively formed a complex with Smads by immunoprecipitation, the 
inhibitory effect of c-Ski/SnoN on the promoter activity of human alpha2(I) 
collagen and 3TP-Lux was impaired in scleroderma fibroblasts. 
Immunoprecipitation analyses also revealed that overexpressed c-Ski/SnoN could 
not compete with p300 in these cells.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that impaired competition with p300 is the 
possible cause of dysfunction of c-Ski/SnoN in scleroderma fibroblasts and that 
this might contribute to maintenance of the autocrine TGFbeta loop in this 
disease.
