Stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR).CD3 complex induces rapid 
tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl, a protooncogene product which has been 
implicated in intracellular signaling pathways via its interaction with several 
signaling molecules. We found recently that Cbl associates directly with a 
member of the 14-3-3 protein family (14-3-3tau) in T cells and that the 
association is increased as a consequence of anti-CD3-mediated T cell 
activation. We report here that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation of T 
cells also enhanced the interaction between Cbl and two 14-3-3 isoforms (tau and 
zeta). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl was not sufficient or required for this 
increased interaction. Thus, cotransfection of COS cells with Cbl plus Lck 
and/or Syk family protein-tyrosine kinases caused a marked increase in the 
phosphotyrosine content of Cbl without a concomitant enhancement of its 
association with 14-3-3. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation induced 
serine phosphorylation of Cbl, and dephosphorylation of immunoprecipitated Cbl 
by a Ser/Thr phosphatase disrupted its interaction with 14-3-3. By using 
successive carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of Cbl, the 14-3-3-binding domain 
was mapped to a serine-rich 30-amino acid region (residues 615-644) of Cbl. 
Mutation of serine residues in this region further defined a binding motif 
distinct from the consensus sequence RSXSXP, which was recently identified as a 
14-3-3-binding motif. These results suggest that TCR stimulation induces both 
tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Cbl. These phosphorylation events allow 
Cbl to recruit distinct signaling elements that participate in TCR-mediated 
signal transduction pathways.
