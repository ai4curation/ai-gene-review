The family of human proteins containing a potassium channel tetramerization 
domain (KCTD) includes 21 members whose function is largely unknown. Recent 
reports have however suggested that these proteins are implicated in very 
important biological processes. KCTD11/REN, the best-characterized member of the 
family to date, plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination of HDAC1 by acting, 
in complex with Cullin3, as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. By combining bioinformatics 
and mutagenesis analyses, here we show that the protein is expressed in two 
alternative variants: a short previously characterized form (sKCTD11) composed 
by 232 amino acids and a longer variant (lKCTD11) which contains an N-terminal 
extension of 39 residues. Interestingly, we demonstrate that lKCTD11 starts with 
a non-canonical AUU codon. Although both sKCTD11 and lKCTD11 bear a POZ/BTB 
domain in their N-terminal region, this domain is complete only in the long 
form. Indeed, sKCTD11 presents an incomplete POZ/BTB domain. Nonetheless, 
sKCTD11 is still able to bind Cul3, although to much lesser extent than lKCTD11, 
and to perform its biological activity. The heterologous expression of sKCTD11 
and lKCTD11 and their individual domains in Escherichia coli yielded soluble 
products as fusion proteins only for the longer form. In contrast to the closely 
related KCTD5 which is pentameric, the characterization of both lKCTD11 and its 
POZ/BTB domain by gel filtration and light scattering indicates that the protein 
likely forms stable tetramers. In line with this result, experiments conducted 
in cells show that the active protein is not monomeric. Based on these findings, 
homology-based models were built for lKCTD11 BTB and for its complex with Cul3. 
These analyses indicate that a stable lKCTD11 BTB-Cul3 three-dimensional model 
with a 4:4 stoichiometry can be generated. Moreover, these models provide 
insights into the determinants of the tetramer stability and into the regions 
involved in lKCTD11-Cul3 recognition.
