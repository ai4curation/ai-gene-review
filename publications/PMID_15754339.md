epsilon-N-Trimethyllysine hydroxylase (TMLH) (EC 1.14.11.8) is a 
non-heme-ferrous iron hydroxylase, Fe(++) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent, 
catalyzing the first of four enzymatic reactions of the highly conserved 
carnitine biosynthetic pathway. Otherwise from all the other enzymes of 
carnitine biosynthesis, TMLH was found to be associated to the mitochondrial 
fraction. We here report molecular cloning of two alternative spliced forms of 
TMLH, which appear ubiquitously expressed in human adult and fetal tissues. The 
deduced proteins are designated TMLH-a and TMLH-b, and contain 421 and 399 amino 
acids, respectively. They share the first N-terminal 332 amino acids, including 
a mitochondrial targeting signal, but diverge at the C-terminal end. TMLH-a and 
TMLH-b exogenous expression in COS-1 cells shows that the first 15 amino acids 
are necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial import. Furthermore, comparative 
evolutionary analysis of the C-terminal portion of TMLH-a identifies a conserved 
domain characterized by a key triad of residues, His242-Glu244-His389 predicted 
to bind 2OG end. This sequence is conserved in the TMLH enzyme from all species 
but is partially substituted by a unique sequence in the TMLH-b variant. Indeed, 
TMLH-b is not functional by itself as well as a TMLH-H389L mutant produced by 
site directed mutagenesis. As great interest, we found that TMLH-b and 
TMLH-H389L, individually co-expressed with TMLH-a in COS-1 cells, negatively 
affect TMLH activity. Therefore, our studies on the TMLH alternative form 
provide relevant novel information, first that the C-terminal region of TMLH 
contains the main determinants for its enzymatic activity including a key H389 
residue, and second that TMLH-b could act as a crucial physiological negative 
regulator of TMLH.
