We have cloned two human putative steroid binding membrane proteins, termed 
Hpr6.6 and Dg6. Hpr6.6 is the human homolog of a previously cloned porcine 
progesterone binding protein. Both proteins contain a putative transmembrane 
domain and a highly conserved stretch of 58 amino acids. Hpr6.6 mRNA is 
expressed predominantly in liver and kidney, whereas Dg6 mRNA is preferentially 
expressed in placenta. Hpr6.6 is located on the X chromosome and dg6 on 
chromosome 4. The two proteins are the first putative steroid membrane receptors 
cloned from man.
