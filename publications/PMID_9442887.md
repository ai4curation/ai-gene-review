The vacuolar (H+)-ATPases (or V-ATPases) function in the acidification of 
intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells. The V-ATPases are multisubunit 
complexes composed of two functional domains. The peripheral V1 domain, a 
500-kDa complex responsible for ATP hydrolysis, contains at least eight 
different subunits of molecular weight 70-13 (subunits A-H). The integral V0 
domain, a 250-kDa complex, functions in proton translocation and contains at 
least five different subunits of molecular weight 100-17 (subunits a-d). 
Biochemical and genetic analysis has been used to identify subunits and residues 
involved in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, proton translocation, and 
coupling of these activities. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the 
regulation of vacuolar acidification in vivo, including control of pump density, 
regulation of assembly of V1 and V0 domains, disulfide bond formation, activator 
or inhibitor proteins, and regulation of counterion conductance. Recent 
information concerning targeting and regulation of V-ATPases has also been 
obtained.
