Formation of a bipolar spindle is essential for faithful chromosome segregation 
at mitosis. Because centrosomes define spindle poles, defects in centrosome 
number and structural organization can lead to a loss of bipolarity. In 
addition, microtubule-mediated pulling and pushing forces acting on centrosomes 
and chromosomes are also important for bipolar spindle formation. Polo-like 
kinase 1 (Plk1) is a highly conserved Ser/Thr kinase that has essential roles in 
the formation of a bipolar spindle with focused poles. However, the mechanism by 
which Plk1 regulates spindle-pole formation is poorly understood. Here, we 
identify a novel centrosomal substrate of Plk1, Kizuna (Kiz), depletion of which 
causes fragmentation and dissociation of the pericentriolar material from 
centrioles at prometaphase, resulting in multipolar spindles. We demonstrate 
that Kiz is critical for establishing a robust mitotic centrosome architecture 
that can endure the forces that converge on the centrosomes during spindle 
formation, and suggest that Plk1 maintains the integrity of the spindle poles by 
phosphorylating Kiz.
