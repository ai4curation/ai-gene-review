Peyer's patches (PPs) play an important role in the induction of immune 
responses in the intestine, but regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced 
innate immune responses in PPs is not well understood. We investigated the 
responses of PPs and other immune cells to the TLR9 agonist, CpG 
oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymph node 
cells secreted significant amounts of interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFNgamma, and 
interleukin (IL)-12 following stimulation with CpG ODN. In contrast, PP cells 
exhibited poor cytokine responses, despite abundant expression of TLR9 mRNA. PP 
cells spontaneously secreted high levels of IL-10, and the primary source of the 
IL-10 was resting CD5(-)CD11c(-)CD21(+) B cells. Neutralization of the IL-10 or 
depletion of CD21(+) B cells resulted in a significant increase in CpG-induced 
IFNalpha-response in PPs, suggesting that IL-10 from B cells regulate innate 
responses in PPs. These IL-10-secreting PP B cells may represent a novel subset 
of the recently proposed regulatory B cells (B(regs)) in the intestine.
