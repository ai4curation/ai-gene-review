Angiogenesis is critical for the growth and proliferation of tumors as well as 
for normal development. We now describe a novel role for histidine-rich 
glycoprotein (HRGP) in the modulation of angiogenesis. HRGP is a plasma protein 
that circulates in relatively high concentrations (1.5 microM), but has no known 
function in vivo. We have shown previously that HRGP binds with high affinity to 
thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a homotrimeric glycoprotein that is a potent inhibitor 
of angiogenesis. The antiangiogenic activity of TSP-1 is mediated by the binding 
of properdin-like type I repeats to the receptor CD36. We found that binding of 
HRGP to TSP-1 was similarly mediated by TSP type I repeats. HRGP colocalized 
with TSP-1 in the stroma of human breast cancer specimens, and this interaction 
masked the antiangiogenic epitope of TSP-1. In assays performed in vitro of 
endothelial cell migration and tube formation, and in vivo corneal angiogenesis 
assays, HRGP inhibited the antiangiogenic effect of TSP-1. These studies suggest 
that HRGP can modulate the antiangiogenic activity of TSP-1, and identify a 
potential mechanism of resistance to the antiangiogenic effect of TSP-1.

Abstract

Angiogenesis is critical for the growth and proliferation of tumors as well as for normal development. We now describe a novel role for histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) in the modulation of angiogenesis. HRGP is a plasma protein that circulates in relatively high concentrations (1.5 μM), but has no known function in vivo. We have shown previously that HRGP binds with high affinity to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a homotrimeric glycoprotein that is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. The antiangiogenic activity of TSP-1 is mediated by the binding of properdin-like type I repeats to the receptor CD36. We found that binding of HRGP to TSP-1 was similarly mediated by TSP type I repeats. HRGP colocalized with TSP-1 in the stroma of human breast cancer specimens, and this interaction masked the antiangiogenic epitope of TSP-1. In assays performed in vitro of endothelial cell migration and tube formation, and in vivo corneal angiogenesis assays, HRGP inhibited the antiangiogenic effect of TSP-1. These studies suggest that HRGP can modulate the antiangiogenic activity of TSP-1, and identify a potential mechanism of resistance to the antiangiogenic effect of TSP-1.

Introduction

Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels, is necessary for a variety of normal physiologic processes as well as for the growth and proliferation of tumors. The identification of natural modulators of angiogenesis is essential to the understanding of this complex process, and may provide attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) is a plasma protein with an unusually high histidine and proline content that circulates in relatively high concentrations (1.5 μM), but has no known function in vivo ( 1 ). Several in vitro interactions of HRGP have been described, such as binding to metals, heparin, and several proteins including plasminogen, fibrinogen, and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) ( 2 , 3 ). Surface-bound HRGP can accelerate the activation of plasminogen by tissue plasminogen activator, suggesting a role for HRGP in the fibrinolytic system ( 4 ). Although there are reports of inherited HRGP polymorphisms and elevated HRGP levels in families with thromboembolic disease, the role of HRGP in thrombosis and fibrinolysis in humans has not been determined ( 5 ).

We have shown previously that HRGP binds with high affinity to TSP-1 ( 6 ), a 450-kDa homotrimeric adhesive glycoprotein that is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis ( 7 – 9 ). TSP-1 is secreted by activated platelets and a variety of normal vascular cells, including endothelial and smooth muscle cells ( 10 ), and has been shown to inhibit endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, migration, and tube formation in response to multiple angiogenic stimuli ( 11 ). The antiangiogenic activity of TSP-1 has been localized to the properdin-like type I repeats, and synthetic peptides derived from the type I domains have been found to have potent antiangiogenic activity in vivo and in assays of EC function ( 9 ).

Although TSP-1 interacts with a number of distinct cellular receptors, CD36 has been recognized as the critical angiostatic receptor for TSP-1 ( 12 , 13 ). The binding of TSP-1 to CD36 is mediated by the peptide sequence cysteine-serine-valine-threonine-cysteine-glycine (CSVTCG), the same type I repeat shown to have antiangiogenic activity ( 14 ). We have now explored the structure-function relationships that mediate interactions between TSP-1 and HRGP, and report that the binding of HRGP is localized to the type I repeats, the same sequence motifs responsible for CD36 binding. Moreover, we now report the role of HRGP in inhibiting the antiangiogenic activity of TSP-1.

Discussion

The process of angiogenesis requires intricate control to allow for normal development and wound healing, and may lead to the progression and metastasis of tumors. Tumor masses that remain dormant and undetectable for years may suddenly acquire the ability to promote neovascularization, a process that has been termed “angiogenic switch” ( 34 ). Studies in murine models show that inhibition of angiogenesis may lead to regression of large tumor masses, suggesting that tumor angiogenesis is a dynamic process ( 35 ). Recent attention has therefore focused on the identification and characterization of natural inhibitors of angiogenesis and their receptors, which provide attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.

Although several specific inhibitors of angiogenesis have been described, many of which have been found to be fragments of larger extracellular matrix–associated proteins ( 7 , 36 ), TSP-1 is the only one for which a receptor-ligand interaction has been well characterized. The chymotrypsin-resistant core of TSP-1, consisting of several properdin-like type I repeats, retains the antiangiogenic capacity of the intact molecule. Synthetic peptides derived from the type I domains have also been found to have potent antiangiogenic activity in vivo and in assays of EC function. Although TSP-1 interacts with a number of proteins, its antiangiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo is mediated by the glycoprotein receptor CD36 ( 12 , 13 ). Inhibition of the TSP-1–CD36 interaction with a blocking Ab to TSP-1 has been shown to lead to more rapid re-endothelialization in a post-angioplasty setting, a process similar mechanistically to angiogenesis ( 37 ).

Although a number of interactions have been reported for HRGP, no in vivo physiologic function has been described previously for this abundant plasma protein. The structure of HRGP is unique, consisting of a number of discrete domains, including two cystatin-like domains at the NH 2 -terminus, a histidine-rich region, and two proline-rich domains ( 38 ). We have identified two regions in HRGP with significant homology to the TSP-1 binding site of CD36. These regions, known as CLESH-1 motifs, are conserved among members of the CD36 gene family and other TSP-1 binding proteins. Our studies show that binding of HRGP to TSP-1 was mediated by the TSP type I repeats, the same sequence motifs responsible for antiangiogenic activity and CD36 binding. We demonstrated that HRGP inhibited the antiangiogenic activity of TSP-1 in vivo, and that HRGP augmented response to low doses of bFGF in a CD36-dependent manner, suggesting that HRGP antagonizes the effect of endogenous TSP-1.

We therefore propose a model of the inhibition of the antiangiogenic effect of TSP-1 by HRGP (Figure 9 ). Interaction of the type I repeats of TSP-1 with the CLESH-1 domain of CD36 leads to a cascade of signaling events mediated by CD36. HRGP can interfere with the interaction of TSP-1 with CD36, and may therefore be a natural modulator of angiogenesis. The activity of HRGP may provide a mechanism by which tumors escape or become resistant to the antiangiogenic effects of TSP-1.

Previously described interactions of HRGP support the hypothesis that HRGP is an important modulator of angiogenesis. Because the binding of HRGP to heparin is pH dependent and increases at lower pH, circulating HRGP may bind to glycosaminoglycans in matrix or on the surface of ECs, especially in areas of relative hypoxia and low pH. HRGP in the matrix may also enhance angiogenesis by increasing fibrinolytic activity. Immobilized HRGP on a metal substrate ( 4 ) or in a trimolecular complex with TSP-1 and plasminogen accelerates plasminogen activation by tissue plasminogen activator. The rate of plasmin generation from the trimolecular complex was greater than from a bimolecular complex of TSP-plasminogen, suggesting an important interaction of HRGP with plasminogen when both are complexed to TSP ( 39 ). Therefore, the organization of a protein complex in the matrix may play an important role in the regulation of proteolytic activity, and HRGP may serve as a natural, circulating mediator of the angiogenic switch.

Angiogenesis is particularly relevant to the pathogenesis of breast cancer. The degree of angiogenesis in breast cancer specimens has been shown to correlate with the rate of metastasis, and the level of angiogenesis in breast cancers has been shown to be an independent prognostic factor ( 40 , 41 ). Primary human breast cancer cells express a number of proangiogenic factors such as bFGF and vascular endothelial growth factor, and TSP has long been known to be localized in the basement membrane and desmoplastic stroma of malignant breast epithelium ( 31 ). Using immunohistochemical studies of human breast cancer specimens, we found that HRGP colocalized with TSP-1 in the tumor matrix, and that this interaction masked the antiangiogenic epitope of TSP-1. Therefore, in areas where TSP-1 is an important inhibitor of angiogenesis, HRGP could serve as a modulator of TSP-1 activity, promoting angiogenesis. The biologic impact of these interactions may vary in different tumors as a consequence of the matrix components. Elucidation of these relationships may lead to new modalities of anticancer therapy.
