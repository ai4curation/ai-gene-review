Osteoclasts, multinucleated cells of myeloid-monocytic origin, are responsible 
for bone resorption, which is crucial for maintenance of bone homeostasis in 
concert with bone-forming osteoblasts of nonhematopoietic, mesenchymal origin. 
Receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) and M-CSF, expressed on the 
surface of and secreted by osteoblasts, respectively, are essential factors that 
facilitate osteoclast formation. In contrast to the activation processes for 
osteoclast formation, inhibitory mechanisms for it are poorly understood. Herein 
we demonstrate that inhibitory Ig-like receptors recruiting Src homology 2 
domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) are expressed on osteoclast 
precursor cells like other myeloid cells, and that they play a regulatory role 
in the development of osteoclasts. We detected cell-surface expression of paired 
Ig-like receptor (PIR)-B and four isoforms of leukocyte Ig-like receptor (LILR)B 
on cultured osteoclast precursor cells of mouse and human origin, respectively, 
and showed that all of these ITIM-harboring inhibitory receptors constitutively 
recruit SHP-1 in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF, and that some of them can 
suppress osteoclast development in vitro. Fluorescence energy transfer analyses 
have suggested that the constitutive binding of either murine PIR-B or its human 
ortholog LILRB1 to MHC class I molecules on the same cell surface comprises one 
of the mechanisms for developmental regulation. These results constitute the 
first evidence of the regulation of osteoclast formation by cell-surface, 
ITIM-harboring Ig-like receptors. Modulation of these regulatory receptors may 
be a novel way to control various skeletal system disorders and inflammatory 
arthritis.
