The death domain of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 (TNFR1) triggers 
distinct signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation 
through its interaction with the death domain protein TRADD. Here, we show that 
TRADD interacts strongly with RIP, another death domain protein that was shown 
previously to associate with Fas antigen. We also show that RIP is a 
serine-threonine kinase that is recruited by TRADD to TNFR1 in a TNF-dependent 
process. Overexpression of the intact RIP protein induces both NF-kappa B 
activation and apoptosis. However, expression of the death domain of RIP Induces 
apoptosis, but potently inhibits NF-kappa B activation by TNF. These results 
suggest that distinct domains of RIP participate in the TNF signaling cascades 
leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation.
