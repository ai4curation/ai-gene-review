lamination defects, seizures, and adult lethality.

The adult mammalian cortex is characterized by a distinct laminar structure 
generated through a well-defined pattern of neuronal migration. Successively 
generated neurons are layered in an "inside-out" manner to produce six cortical 
laminae. We demonstrate here that p35, the neuronal-specific activator of 
cyclin-dependent kinase 5, plays a key role in proper neuronal migration. Mice 
lacking p35, and thus p35/cdk5 kinase activity, display severe cortical 
lamination defects and suffer from sporadic adult lethality and seizures. 
Histological examination reveals that the mutant mice lack the characteristic 
laminated structure of the cortex. Neuronal birth-dating experiments indicate a 
reversed packing order of cortical neurons such that earlier born neurons reside 
in superficial layers and later generated neurons occupy deep layers. The 
phenotype of p35 mutant mice thus demonstrates that the formation of cortical 
laminar structure depends on the action of the p35/cdk5 kinase.
