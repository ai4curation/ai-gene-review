To control gene transcription, DNA-binding transcription factors recognise 
specific sequence motifs in gene regulatory regions. A complete and reliable GO 
annotation of all DNA-binding transcription factors is key to investigating the 
delicate balance of gene regulation in response to environmental and 
developmental stimuli. The need for such information is demonstrated by the many 
lists of transcription factors that have been produced over the past decade. The 
COST Action Gene Regulation Ensemble Effort for the Knowledge Commons (GREEKC) 
Consortium brought together experts in the field of transcription with the aim 
of providing high quality and interoperable gene regulatory data. The Gene 
Ontology (GO) Consortium provides strict definitions for gene product function, 
including factors that regulate transcription. The collaboration between the 
GREEKC and GO Consortia has enabled the application of those definitions to 
produce a new curated catalogue of over 1400 human DNA-binding transcription 
factors, that can be accessed at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/targetset/dbTF. 
This catalogue has facilitated an improvement in the GO annotation of human 
DNA-binding transcription factors and led to the GO annotation of almost sixty 
thousand DNA-binding transcription factors in over a hundred species. Thus, this 
work will aid researchers investigating the regulation of transcription in both 
biomedical and basic science.
