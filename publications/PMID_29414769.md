The enzyme AICAR-transformylase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC) catalyzes the last two 
steps of purine de novo synthesis. It metabolizes 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 
ribonucleoside (AICAR), which is an AMP analogue, leading to activation of 
AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). We investigated whether the AICAR-ATIC pathway 
plays a role in the high glucose (HG)-mediated DNA damage response and 
AICAR-mediated AMPK activation, explaining the detrimental effects of glucose on 
neuronal damage and shortening of the lifespan. HG up-regulated the expression 
and activity of the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of ATIC, C55F2.1 (atic-1), 
and increased the levels of reactive oxygen species and methylglyoxal-derived 
advanced glycation end products. Overexpression of atic-1 decreased the lifespan 
and head motility and increased neuronal damage under both standard and HG 
conditions. Inhibition of atic-1 expression, by RNAi, under HG was associated 
with increased lifespan and head motility and reduced neuronal damage, reactive 
oxygen species, and methylglyoxal-derived advanced glycation end product 
accumulation. This effect was independent of an effect on DNA damage or 
antioxidant defense pathways, such as superoxide dismutase (sod-3) or 
glyoxalase-1 (glod-4), but was dependent on AMPK and accumulation of AICAR. 
Through AMPK, AICAR treatment also reduced the negative effects of HG. The 
mitochondrial inhibitor rotenone abolished the AICAR/AMPK-induced amelioration 
of HG effects, pointing to mitochondria as a prime target of the glucotoxic 
effects in C. elegans We conclude that atic-1 is involved in glucotoxic effects 
under HG conditions, either by blocked atic-1 expression or via AICAR and AMPK 
induction.
