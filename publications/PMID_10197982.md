Most normal human diploid cells have no detectable telomerase; however, 
expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase is sufficient to induce 
telomerase activity and, in many cases, will bypass normal senescence. We and 
others have previously demonstrated in vitro assembly of active telomerase by 
combining the purified RNA component with the reverse transcriptase catalytic 
component synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte extract. Here we show that assembly 
of active telomerase from in vitro-synthesized components requires the 
contribution of proteins present in reticulocyte extracts. We have identified 
the molecular chaperones p23 and Hsp90 as proteins that bind to the catalytic 
subunit of telomerase. Blockade of this interaction inhibits assembly of active 
telomerase in vitro. Also, a significant fraction of active telomerase from cell 
extracts is associated with p23 and Hsp90. Consistent with in vitro results, 
inhibition of Hsp90 function in cells blocks assembly of active telomerase. To 
our knowledge, p23 and Hsp90 are the first telomerase-associated proteins 
demonstrated to contribute to telomerase activity.
