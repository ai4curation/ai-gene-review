The human hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen (CD34) recently was shown to 
react with a variety of nonhematopoietic tissues and their tumors, including 
vascular endothelium, dendritic interstitial fibroblastic cells, and endoneurial 
cells as well as with the neoplastic cells in a variety of mesenchymal neoplasms 
of unknown etiology, such as Kaposi's sarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, 
epithelioid sarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and solitary fibrous 
tumors. Additionally, it has been claimed that normal adipocytes may also react 
with this antibody. We studied a series of 90 lipomatous lesions to examine the 
pattern of immunoreactivity of the CD34 antigen in adipose tissue neoplasms. The 
study included 14 lipomas, 19 angiolipomas, 4 atypical lipomas, 18 spindle cell 
lipomas, 3 renal angiomyolipomas, 1 intramuscular lipoma, and 31 liposarcomas. 
Immunostains identified a network of CD34+ spindle cells admixed with the 
adipose tissue elements in all cases of lipoma, angiolipoma, angiomyolipoma, 
intramuscular lipoma, and well-differentiated lipoma-like liposarcoma. 
Additionally, the spindle cell component in all cases of spindle cell lipoma 
were strongly positive for this antigen. Atypical, stellate spindle cells and 
multinucleated "floret" cells in all cases of atypical lipoma as well as in six 
of 12 cases of well-differentiated lipoma-like liposarcoma of deep soft tissue 
were also positive for CD34. Scattered spindle cells in all cases of myxoid 
liposarcoma and in one case of round cell liposarcoma, as well as the 
sarcomatous component in one case of "dedifferentiated" liposarcoma, were 
strongly positive for this antigen. The round cells in myxoid liposarcoma and 
round cell liposarcoma, the signet-ring and multivacuolated lipoblasts in 
well-differentiated liposarcoma, and the pleomorphic atypical cells in 
pleomorphic liposarcoma were uniformly negative. The results of this study 
appear to indicate that lipomatous tumors may harbor a population of CD34+ 
interstitial dendritic spindle cells. Overgrowth or clonal expansion of this 
dendritic cell subpopulation may account for the development of spindle cell 
lipomas and for the spindle cell component in some cases of "dedifferentiated" 
liposarcoma.
