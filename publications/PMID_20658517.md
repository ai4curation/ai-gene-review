We investigated the possible functional- and physical protein-interactions 
between two airway Cl(-) channels, SLC26A9 and CFTR. Bronchial CFBE41o- cell 
lines expressing CFTR(WT) or CFTR(ΔF508) were transduced with SLC26A9. 
Immunoblots identified a migrating band corresponding to SLC26A9 present in 
whole-cell lysates as on apical membrane of cells grown on polarized filters. 
CFTR levels were increased by the presence of SLC26A9 in both CFTR(WT) and 
CFTR(ΔF508) cell lines. In CFBE41o- cells and CFBE41o-/CFTR(WT) cells transduced 
with SLC26A9, currents associated to the protein expression were not detected. 
However, the forskolin (FK)-stimulated currents were enhanced in 
SLC26A9-transduced cells compared to control cells. Therefore, the presence of 
SLC26A9 resulted in an increase in CFTR activity (same % of CFTR((inh)-172) or 
GlyH-101 inhibition in both groups). In CFBE41o-/CFTR(ΔF508) cells transduced 
with SLC26A9 (at 27°C), a current associated to the protein expression was also 
lacking. FK-stimulated currents and level of CFTR((inh)-172) inhibition were not 
different in both groups. The presence of SLC26A9 in Xenopus oocytes expressing 
CFTR also enhanced the FK-stimulated currents as compared to oocytes expressing 
CFTR alone. This stimulation was mostly linked to CFTR. An enhancement of 
FK-stimulated currents was not found in oocytes co-expressing SLC26A9 and 
CFTR(ΔF508). In conclusion, in both protein expression systems used, SLC26A9 
stimulates CFTR activity but not that of CFTR(ΔF508). Our co-immunoprecipitation 
studies demonstrate a physical interaction between both anion channels. We 
propose as an alternative hypothesis (not exclusive) to the known SLC26A9-STAS 
domain/CFTR interaction, that SLC26A9 favors the biogenesis and/or stabilization 
of CFTR, leading to stimulated currents.

## Full Text

The SLC26 solute carrier family performs diverse and critical physiological functions in epithelia of multiple organs among different species. The SLC26 family shares a 7 + 7 transmembrane segment inverted repeat architecture with SLC4 and SLC23 families (1, 2, 3), but holds a regulatory sulfate transporter and anti-sigma (STAS) domain (4) and a PDZ-binding motif in its cytoplasmic region (5). The STAS domain is named due to its weak but structural similarity to the Bacillus sp. antisigma protein SpoIIAA (4). A general structure model for SLC26 STAS domain, six β-strands surrounded by five α-helices, has been initially suggested by crystal structure of prestin STAS domain (6).

Recent studies indicate there is a reciprocal-stimulatory interaction of the STAS domains of SLC26A3 and SLC26A6 with the regulatory region (R-region) of CFTR (7, 8, 9). Conversely, Slc26a9 activity is inhibited by interaction of its STAS domain via the R-region of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) (10), but CFTR activity is enhanced with coexpression of SLC26A9 (11). These results not only suggest that a different structural interaction may exist between specific STAS domains and the R-region of CFTR but also imply there may be several parts to this protein–protein interaction.

SLC26A9 functions as a Cl--HCO3- exchanger, a Cl- channel, and rodent Slc26a9 as a Na+-coupled transporter (12, 13, 14). Structural variants in the STAS domain were reported to associate with diseases linked to SLC26 transporters (15). Previously, we reported that STAS domain variant V622L and domain adjacent variant V744M decreased chloride currents of SLC26A9 (16). Coding mutations located in the STAS domain of SLC26A9 may disrupt this stimulatory interaction, as demonstrated by functional analysis of variant L683P (17). Although no disease association has been reported for the variants above, these studies demonstrate the role of SLC26A9 STAS domain in channel function and stimulation of CFTR currents.

Recently, the cryo-EM was used to gain the insight into the SLC26A9 structure by a truncated mouse Slc26a9 protein, revealing its dimerization mechanism (18). More recently, a full-length human SLC26A9 protein, except for several flexible regions, was resolved by cryo-EM at a resolution of 2.6 Å (19). The contribution of STAS domain to SLC26A9 dimerization was illustrated by both cryo-EM structures. All SLC26/Slc26 proteins are characterized by containing a STAS-domain. Most of the variability in these SLC26-STAS domains resides in the loop between α-helix1 and β-strand3, while other STAS domain parts are mostly conserved (4, 20). Among the different SLC26 family members, these disordered loops have variable lengths (32–128 amino acids) and show no similarity to each other. However, this disordered loop (also named as variable loop or intervening sequence) is neither resolved by crystal structure nor by the cryo-EM structure. While many studies have illustrated the critical role of STAS domain by recreating human disease mutations (9, 21), mutagenesis (22) or deletions (10, 23, 24), little is known about the structure of this disordered loop and its relationship to the SLC26 protein’s function.

Previous work illustrated that deletion of the entire Slc26a9-STAS domain almost completely removed whole-cell currents (10). To determine the potential role of the SLC26A9 disordered loop, we performed a series of deletions and selective mutations of the STAS disordered loop in human SLC26A9. Function was assessed in Xenopus oocytes by voltage clamp and ion-selective microelectrode experiments. Our results indicate that the SLC26A9 disordered loop has an inhibitory role and a potential phosphorylation site in its S/T-rich motif. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that a disordered loop of a STAS domain controls function of the same SLC26 protein.

ResultsPrediction of disorder loop and S/T-rich motif within the STAS domainIntracellular regions of transmembrane proteins play pivotal roles in cellular crosstalk, often being mediated by protein–protein interactions. Work over the last decade demonstrated that STAS domain and its interactors play critical roles in regulation of SLC26 exchangers/channels. Disordered protein regions, and short conserved motifs within them, are emerging as key determinants of many such interactions. Most SLC26 proteins have a long-disordered linker (nearly 100 residues for most members) separating the cytoplasmic STAS domain into two conserved regions (Fig. 1, A and D, and Fig. 2). Previous studies named this disordered linker as the variable loop (4), the intervening sequence (IVS) (15), the intrinsic variable sequence (IVS), or intrinsically disordered region. This intervening sequence is predicted to have no regular secondary structure. In this article, we refer to this region as the “disordered loop” as a counterpart of another “ordered motif” hidden within this disordered loop.Figure 1Schematic representation of the SLC26A9 disordered loop within STAS domain. Bioinformatics analysis of disordered loop within STAS domain in Slc26a9 proteins. A, SLC26A9 shares a common transmembrane topology (14 TM) with other SLC26 family members and contains a long cytoplasmic C terminus with the STAS domain. A long-disordered loop separates two comparative conserved domains in the STAS domain. The disordered loop of human SLC26A9 has 93 amino acids in length. B, sequence alignment of the disordered loops of Slc26a9 in different species. K/R-rich, middle, S/T-rich subregions are indicated by the black arrows. Partial sequences of Slc26a9 channels from Homo sapiens (human), Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee), Mus musculus (mouse), Rattus norvegicus (rat), Equus caballus (horse), Bos taurus (cattle), Sus scrofa domesticus (pig), Gallus gallus (chicken), Meleagris gallopavo (turkey), Xenopus laevis (frog), Ophiophagus Hannah (king cobra), Oreochromis niloticus (nile tilapia), and Gasterosteidae (stickleback) were aligned using Clustal Omega.

The disordered loop (blue block), a conserved loop (orange block), and a conserved phosphorylation motif (D[S/T](2)G) (red block) are indicated. B, alignment of the disordered loop for Slc26a9 members. A Ser/Thr cluster (red block) is indicated in human SLC26A9. The Slc26a9 disordered loop (blue block) can be subdivided into three subregions: K/R-rich (red block); middle (wine block), and S/T-rich (green block). STAS, sulfate transporter and anti-sigma.We aligned the amino acid sequences of the disordered loops within STAS domain in various species orthologs of Slc26a9 using ClustalX. Sequence alignment (25) (Fig. 1B). Phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1C) analysis revealed that the disordered loops of Slc26a9 proteins are highly conserved in mammals (e.g., human, chimpanzee, horse, cattle, mouse, rat), but are poorly conserved in nonmammals (e.g., chicken, turkey, king cobra, frog, nile tilapia, stickleback). The whole cytoplasmic region of human SLC26A9 was further investigated by Predictors of Natural Disordered Regions (PONDR) predictions (Fig. 1D). The other part of STAS domain is predicted as an ordered region with the disordered loop and the tail of C terminus predicted as disorder regions. This ordered region (GTSVSYITFS) harbors several serines and threonines in the otherwise disordered loop. This region is designated as the “S/T-rich motif” in this paper.Deletion of STAS-disordered loop dramatically increases SLC26A9 functionLarge Cl- currents have been reported from two-electrode voltage clamp in the Xenopus oocytes expressing mouse Slc26a9 (26) and human SLC26A9 (13). However, deletion of STAS domain containing the disordered loop eliminates the Cl- channel activity of Slc26a9 and fully inhibits the Cl- currents (10). We sought to determine whether only deletion of disordered loop resulted in a similar effect on the Cl- channel activity of human SLC26A9. To answer this question, full deletion of disordered loop (SLC26A9 ΔLoop) was generated in the template of a triple FLAG-tagged SLC26A9 (Fig. 3) and was expressed in Xenopus oocytes for functional analysis. The Cl- current of oocytes injected with WT SLC26A9’s complementary RNA (cRNA) was compared with that of Xenopus oocytes injected with same amount cRNA of the SLC26A9 ΔLoop (Fig. 4A). The Xenopus oocytes were clamped at −60 mV. SLC26A9, I(SLC26A9), Fig. 4, A and B, black) show voltage-dependent I (I–V) response and exhibit Cl- conductance (31.24 ± 12.83 μS) as previously reported (13, 26). Compared with I(SLC26A9), SLC26A9 ΔLoop showed enlarged Cl- current (p < 0.001) and large whole-cell, Cl- conductance (294.12 ± 120.04 μS) (Fig. 4, A and B, blue) but showed similar overall I-V shapes. Fig. 4C shows that I(ΔLoop) is 8.7-fold increased (40.8 ± 4.73 μA, p < 0.001) at +60 mV compared to I(SLC26A9) (4.68 ± 0.99 μA). The I-V relationship illustrate that the I-V slope (i.e., conductance) by deletion of disordered loop in SLC26A9 is enhanced over the entire voltage range tested (Fig. 4B).Figure 3Schematic diagram of SLC26A9 deletions and mutants within disordered loop. Those SLC26A9 deletions and mutants in the disordered loop are categorized into three groups for the purpose of defining the borders (Group 1); analyzing the subregions (Group 2) and analyzing the potential phosphorylation sites (Group 3). Dashed lines indicate deleted sequence. Numbers denote amino acid position of the human SLC26A9. In 620 to 628 S/T-rich motif, Serine/Threonine residues are highlighted as blue color. Alanine residues are highlighted as red color in Ala-replacement mutants. Individual deletions and mutants with indicated amino acid positions were constructed and expressed in Xenopus oocytes.Figure 4Deletion of disordered loop increases SLC26A9 function in Xenopus oocytes. A, I to V relationship obtained from voltage-clamp experiments in Xenopus oocytes. SLC26A9 WT (black) and Δ-loop (blue)-injected oocytes were clamped to −60 mV in the ND96 solution (black square) and Cl--free ND96 solution (blue circle). B, the conductance (μSiemens), that is., slope of individual I to V curves calculated between −160 to +60 mV (panel A), for SLC26A9 WT (black) and Δ-loop (red). C, relative currents for ΔLoop (at +60 mV) are dramatically great than that of SLC26A9-injected oocytes). D, measurement of intracellular Cl- [Cl-]i activity for SLC26A9-injected oocytes (black) and ΔLoop-injected oocytes (blue). In the presence of ND96 solution, pH 7.5, extracellular Cl- was replaced by gluconate (0 Cl-) to show Cl- channel activity. Average Cl- transport response (Δ [Cl-]i = end[Cl-]i - initial[Cl-]i) in presence of Cl--free ND96 are indicated in the column graphs. E, simultaneous measurement of intracellular pH (pHi) and membrane potential in Xenopus oocytes expressing SLC26A9 (black, left) and Δ-loop (blue, right). In the presence of 5% CO2, 33 mM HCO3, pH 7.5, ND96 solution, extracellular Cl- was replaced by gluconate (0 Cl-) to show Cl--HCO3- exchange activity (increase in pHi during 0 Cl-). The pHi transport response (Δ[pH]i = end[pH]i - initial[pH]i) divided by time of the initial slope (5 min) in units “10-5 pH unit∗s-1,” in presence of 5% CO2, 33 mM HCO3, pH 7.5, ND96 solution are indicated in the column graphs. F, The normalized ratio of anti-flag signal versus WGA (wheat germ agglutinin) signal representing the relative surface protein expression level is displayed for triple-flag tagged SLC26A9 WT and triple-flag tagged SLC26A9 Δloop. The uninjected oocytes were used as negative controls. Individual points in bar graphs are individual oocyte experiments. Error bars represent mean ± SD. Student t test was used for statistical analysis. Individual points in bar graphs are individual oocyte experiments. Error bars represent mean ± SD. ∗∗∗∗ denotes p ≤ 0.0001 by Student’s t test.Measuring intracellular [Cl-] ([Cl-]i) by Cl- microelectrodes reveals that Cl- removal decreased [Cl-]i for SLC26A9-WT (−8.8 ± 0.8 mM) oocytes. The same response to extracellular Cl- ([Cl-]o) removal from SLC26A9 ΔLoop expressing oocytes decreased by 3.6-fold more (−31.67 ± 4.56 mM) (Fig. 4D). This data indicates that SLC26A9 ΔLoop increased the Cl- transport activity of SLC26A9-WT.SLC26A9 functions not only as Cl- transporter-channel but also a nCl--HCO3- exchanger (11, 12, 13, 14). Since enlarged Cl- currents and Cl- transport were observed for Δ-loop, we determined if the Cl--HCO3- exchanger activity was similarly enhanced. To evaluate Cl--HCO3- exchanger activity, we used pH microelectrodes to measure time dependence of intracellular pH (pHi) changes after Cl- removal (d(pHi)/dt; Fig. 4E) and readdition in a CO2/HCO3- buffered bath solution for SLC26A9 WT and SLC26A9 ΔLoop. Fig. 4E and Fig. S5 illustrate that SLC26A9 ΔLoop increased electrogenic nCl--HCO3- exchange activity, that is, SLC26A9 ΔLoop has an increased pHi change and obvious depolarization after switching to the 0 Cl-/5% CO2 solution.Cl- conductance (Fig. 5A) and current (Fig. 5B) of SLC26A9-injected oocytes increases as cRNA amount-injected increases. After injection of 0.5 ng cRNAs, both I(SLC26A9) and I(ΔLoop) were decreased to 1.81 ± 0.26 μA and 19.1 ± 1.59 μA, respectively. For this cRNA concentration, I(ΔLoop) is 10.6-fold greater than I(SLC26A9). With 3 ng cRNAs injected, I(SLC26A9) and I(ΔLoop) were further increased to 7.43 ± 1.07 μA and 88.1 ± 9.77 μA, respectively, that is, I(ΔLoop) is 11.9-fold of I(SLC26A9). Voltage-dependent currents and whole oocyte Cl- conductances both increased similarly with increasing cRNA-injection.Figure 5Dose-dependent effect of Cl-current in SLC26A9 ΔLoop. A, the conductance (μS, as in Fig. 4B) calculated by the I to V curve from voltage-clamp experiments in Xenopus oocytes expressing 0.5 ng, 1 ng, and 3 ng SLC26A9 WT (black) and ΔLoop (blue), respectively. B, relative currents for ΔLoop (@+60 mV) are dramatically great than that of SLC26A9-injected oocytes when the cRNAs were injected as 0.5 ng, 1 ng, and 3 ng, respectively. Individual points in bar graphs are individual oocyte experiments. Error bars represent mean ± SD. The data were analyzed by Student’s t test. ∗∗, p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗∗, p < 0.0001.Next, the membrane expression levels of the SLC26A9-WT and SLC26A9 Δ-loop were measured by anti-Flag labeling and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) labeling. The normalized density of the flag signal against the density of WGA signal represents the comparative surface protein expression level. As is shown in Fig. 6C, the normalized Flag/WGA signal for SLC26A9-WT is 1.28 ± 0.52 (mean ± SD). The normalized Flag/WGA signal for SLC26A9 ΔLoop is 0.85 ± 0.36, which is 66% expression level of SLC26A9-WT.Figure 6Functional investigate the boundaries of the disordered Loop within STAS domain of SLC26A9.A, I to V relationship obtained from voltage-clamp experiments in Xenopus oocytes expressing SLC26A9-WT, SLC26A9 ΔLoop, SLC26A9 ΔLoop + Δ5(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop + Δ10(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop + Δ5(C), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop + Δ10(C) in standard ND96 solution. For clarity, SDs are not shown here but rather in Fig. S1. B, the conductance calculated as the slope of I to V curves from voltage-clamp experiments in Xenopus oocytes expressing SLC26A9 WT, SLC26A9 ΔLoop, SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C) in standard ND96 solution. Individual points in bar graphs are individual oocyte experiments. Error bars represent mean ± SD (n = 10–12). The results of the statistical analysis are indicated by lowercase letters, that is,. groups sharing letters are statistically similar, whereas those not sharing any letters are significantly different (p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test for multiple comparisons). C, the normalized ratio of anti-Flag signal versus wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) signal representing the relative surface protein expression level were displayed for triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9WT, triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 ΔLoop, triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N), triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N), triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C), and triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C). The uninjected oocytes were used as negative controls. Individual points in bar graphs are individual oocyte experiments. Error bars represent mean ± SD (n = 10–12).

Representative stained oocyte images used for quantification (panel C) are shown in Fig. S2. STAS, sulfate transporter and anti-sigma.Functional estimation of the boundaries of the disordered loopBy protein sequence alignment, the STAS-disordered loop of SLC26A9 is predicted to begin at amino acid L562 and end at amino acid A654 (Figs. 1B, 2B). Based on our previous study, deletion of STAS domain containing the disordered loop inhibits Slc26a9 chloride channel’s function (10). Conversely, deletion of only the STAS-disordered loop increases the function of SLC26A9. Therefore, deletions were designed to investigate the boundaries between the STAS domain and the disordered loop. To functionally estimate the disordered loop boundaries, four constructs were made that deleted five or 10 additional amino acids on the N terminus or C terminus of the disordered loop (Fig. 3): SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C). These four constructs were generated using the triple FLAG-tagged SLC26A9 (Fig. 3) and expressed in Xenopus oocytes for functional analysis.Compared to the conductance of SLC26A9 WT (31.24 ± 12.83 μS), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N) showed increased Cl- current (Fig. 6A) and conductance (262.78 ± 105.51 μS) (Fig. 6B), while there is no significant difference from the conductance of SLC26A9 ΔLoop (294.12 ± 120.04 μS). Further N-terminal deletion (SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N)) showed similar Cl- whole-cell currents (Fig. 6A) and conductance (Fig. 6B; 27.85 ± 20.06 μS) to that of SLC26A9 WT. Similarly, SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C) displayed enhanced whole-cell Cl- currents and conductance (280.26 ± 104.53 μS) compared to that of SLC26A9 WT. There is no significant difference between SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C) and SLC26A9 ΔLoop. Furthermore C-terminal deletion (SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C)) showed similar Cl- currents and conductance (27.89 ± 12.64 μS) to that of SLC26A9 WT. Based on the above results, we localized the proximal boundary of the disordered loop into the D557 and the distal boundary into the F659. The 552 to 557 region and the 660 to 664 region should be considered as the part of STAS domain.Membrane expression levels of the SLC26A9-WT, SLC26A9 ΔLoop, SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C) were measured using anti-Flag labeling (3x-Flag tag on each SLC26A9 construct) and WGA labeling (total plasma membrane). As shown in Fig. 6C, the normalized Flag/WGA signals of SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N) (0.64 ± 0.21), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N) (0.42 ± 0.06), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C) (0.75 ± 0.43), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C) (0.40 ± 0.12) are lower than that of SLC26A9-WT (1.28 ± 0.52).Deletion of specific subregions within disordered loop enhances the functions of SLC26A9Next, the functional significance of specific regions of the STAS-disordered loop of SLC26A9 was investigated. Positively charged amino acids such as Lysine (K) and Arginine (R) are conserved and enriched in the N terminus of the disordered loop, while the Serine (S) and Threonine (T) are conserved and enriched in the C terminus (Fig. 2B). Based on these distinctions, the disordered loop was subdivided into three subregions: (a) K/R-rich subregion (30 aa), (b) middle subregion (31 aa), and (c) S/T-rich subregion (32 aa) (Fig. 1B). The next experiments sought to determine whether the deletion and enhanced function effect depends on the length or on the specific sequence of the disordered loop. One deletion to probe each of the three areas was investigated (Fig. 3, Group 2): SLC26A9 ΔLoop (K/R), SLC26A9 ΔLoop (M), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop (S/T). SLC26A9 ΔLoop (K/R) deletes the K/R-rich region of the disordered loop that incorporates amino acid L562 to amino acid K591 (29 aa). SLC26A9 ΔLoop (M) deletes the middle region the disordered loop that is designated as amino acid T592 to amino acid T620 (28 aa). SLC26A9 ΔLoop (S/T) deletes the S/T-rich region of the disordered loop that encompasses amino acid S621 to amino acid A654 (33 aa).Fig. 7 illustrates that SLC26A9 ΔLoop (K/R) has whole-cell Cl- currents (Fig. 7A) and conductance (Fig. 7B; 336.13  ± 127.83 μS) that are 114% of SLC26A9 ΔLoop (294.12 ± 120.04 μS) and 10.75-fold of SLC26A9 WT (31.24 ± 12.83 μS). SLC26A9 ΔLoop (M) displays Cl- conductance (148.12 ± 80.06 μS) that are 50% of SLC26A9 ΔLoop and 4.7-fold of SLC26A9 WT, while SLC26A9 ΔLoop (S/T) has Cl- conductance (80.17 ± 35.97 μS) that are 27% of SLC26A9 Δ-loop and 2.56-fold of SLC26A9 WT. Evaluation of Cl--nHCO3- exchange activity for these same “Group 2” deletions show results similar to whole-cells currents for the M and S/T regions (Fig. S5).Figure 7Positional deletions of subregions in disordered loop enhance the function of SLC26A9.

Representative stained oocyte images used for quantification (panel C) are shown in Fig. S4. Representative Cl-/HCO3- exchanger activities are shown in Fig. S5.Likewise, the membrane expression levels of the SLC26A9-WT, SLC26A9 ΔLoop, SLC26A9 ΔLoop(K/R), SLC26A9 ΔLoop(M), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop(S/T) were measured by anti-Flag labeling and WGA labeling as we described above. As shown in Fig. 7C, the normalized Flag/WGA signals of SLC26A9 ΔLoop(K/R) (1.29 ± 0.81), SLC26A9 ΔLoop(M) (1.20 ± 0.63), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop(S/T) (1.25 ± 0.48) are similar to that of SLC26A9-WT (1.28 ± 0.52). Compared to SLC26A9 ΔLoop, the reduced membrane expression of SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N) and SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C) could partially account for the reduction in Cl- conductance. However, while the Cl- conductances of SLC26A9 ΔLoop(M) and SLC26A9 ΔLoop(S/T) are reduced compared to SLC26A9 ΔLoop, the membrane expression levels do not change (compare Fig. 7, B and C).Functional assay and cell surface protein assay of single alanine substitutions of serine or threonine within S/T-rich motif of disordered loopThe third structural region within disordered loop is a S/T-rich motif that is closely aligned to the conserved phosphorylation motif D[S/T](2)G (27). Serine or threonine was replaced by alanine to test the possible phosphorylation residues using single alanine substitutions in SLC26A9: T620A, S621A, S623A, T626A, and S628A (Fig. 3, Group 3; Figs. 8 and 9).Figure 8The conductance and surface protein expression of human SLC26A9, its Ala-substitutions in Ser/Thr-rich motif. A, the conductances calculated as the slope of I to V curves from voltage clamp experiments in Xenopus oocytes expressing SLC26A9 WT, T620A, S621A, S623A, T626A, and S628A ala-substitutions of SLC26A9 in standard ND96 solution. Individual points in bar graphs are individual oocyte experiments. Error bars represent mean ± SD.

B, the normalized ratio of anti-Flag signal versus wheat germ agglutininsignal representing the relative surface protein expression level were displayed for triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 WT, its T620A, S621A, S623A, T626A, and S628A Ala-substitutions, and triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 Δloop. Staining of representative oocyte-cryosections with individual labeling are shown in Fig. 10. The uninjected oocytes and oocytes expression nontagged SLC26A9 (WT) were used as negative controls. Individual points in bar graphs are individual oocyte experiments. Error bars represent mean ± SD.

STAS, sulfate transporter and anti-sigma.The Cl- conductances of oocytes injected with the SLC26A9 single alanine substitutions were compared to SLC26A9 WT (3 ng cRNA per oocyte). By one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons, the Cl- conductance of T620A (16.65 ± 12.56 μS), S621A (11.47 ± 4.02 μS), T626A (17.13 ± 15.58 μS), and S628A (29.67 ± 19.72 μS) was significantly lower than that of SLC26A9 WT (60.78 ± 17.31 μS) (Fig. 8A). There is no significant difference between S623A (36.65 ± 2.36 μS) and SLC26A9 WT (60.78 ± 17.31 μS). As the triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 does not have effect the function and surface expression of SLC26A9 proteins (16), we reconstructed the T620A, S621A, S623A, T626A, and S628A substitutions in this construct. To quantify surface expression, we performed stained oocyte sections with anti-Flag and normalized to membrane labeling with WGA signal for each alanine substitution (Figs 8B and 9, WGA channel). Only S621A exhibited lower surface protein expression (Figs. 8B and 9) coinciding with lowered whole-cell conductance (Fig. 8A). Uninjected and nontagged SLC26A9-expressing oocytes were used as the controls.

Prediction of disorder loop and S/T-rich motif within the STAS domainIntracellular regions of transmembrane proteins play pivotal roles in cellular crosstalk, often being mediated by protein–protein interactions. Work over the last decade demonstrated that STAS domain and its interactors play critical roles in regulation of SLC26 exchangers/channels. Disordered protein regions, and short conserved motifs within them, are emerging as key determinants of many such interactions. Most SLC26 proteins have a long-disordered linker (nearly 100 residues for most members) separating the cytoplasmic STAS domain into two conserved regions (Fig. 1, A and D, and Fig. 2). Previous studies named this disordered linker as the variable loop (4), the intervening sequence (IVS) (15), the intrinsic variable sequence (IVS), or intrinsically disordered region. This intervening sequence is predicted to have no regular secondary structure. In this article, we refer to this region as the “disordered loop” as a counterpart of another “ordered motif” hidden within this disordered loop.Figure 1Schematic representation of the SLC26A9 disordered loop within STAS domain.

Sequence alignment (25) (Fig. 1B). Phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1C) analysis revealed that the disordered loops of Slc26a9 proteins are highly conserved in mammals (e.g., human, chimpanzee, horse, cattle, mouse, rat), but are poorly conserved in nonmammals (e.g., chicken, turkey, king cobra, frog, nile tilapia, stickleback). The whole cytoplasmic region of human SLC26A9 was further investigated by Predictors of Natural Disordered Regions (PONDR) predictions (Fig. 1D). The other part of STAS domain is predicted as an ordered region with the disordered loop and the tail of C terminus predicted as disorder regions. This ordered region (GTSVSYITFS) harbors several serines and threonines in the otherwise disordered loop. This region is designated as the “S/T-rich motif” in this paper.

We aligned the amino acid sequences of the disordered loops within STAS domain in various species orthologs of Slc26a9 using ClustalX. Sequence alignment (25) (Fig. 1B). Phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1C) analysis revealed that the disordered loops of Slc26a9 proteins are highly conserved in mammals (e.g., human, chimpanzee, horse, cattle, mouse, rat), but are poorly conserved in nonmammals (e.g., chicken, turkey, king cobra, frog, nile tilapia, stickleback).

Deletion of STAS-disordered loop dramatically increases SLC26A9 functionLarge Cl- currents have been reported from two-electrode voltage clamp in the Xenopus oocytes expressing mouse Slc26a9 (26) and human SLC26A9 (13). However, deletion of STAS domain containing the disordered loop eliminates the Cl- channel activity of Slc26a9 and fully inhibits the Cl- currents (10). We sought to determine whether only deletion of disordered loop resulted in a similar effect on the Cl- channel activity of human SLC26A9. To answer this question, full deletion of disordered loop (SLC26A9 ΔLoop) was generated in the template of a triple FLAG-tagged SLC26A9 (Fig. 3) and was expressed in Xenopus oocytes for functional analysis. The Cl- current of oocytes injected with WT SLC26A9’s complementary RNA (cRNA) was compared with that of Xenopus oocytes injected with same amount cRNA of the SLC26A9 ΔLoop (Fig. 4A). The Xenopus oocytes were clamped at −60 mV. SLC26A9, I(SLC26A9), Fig. 4, A and B, black) show voltage-dependent I (I–V) response and exhibit Cl- conductance (31.24 ± 12.83 μS) as previously reported (13, 26). Compared with I(SLC26A9), SLC26A9 ΔLoop showed enlarged Cl- current (p < 0.001) and large whole-cell, Cl- conductance (294.12 ± 120.04 μS) (Fig. 4, A and B, blue) but showed similar overall I-V shapes. Fig. 4C shows that I(ΔLoop) is 8.7-fold increased (40.8 ± 4.73 μA, p < 0.001) at +60 mV compared to I(SLC26A9) (4.68 ± 0.99 μA). The I-V relationship illustrate that the I-V slope (i.e., conductance) by deletion of disordered loop in SLC26A9 is enhanced over the entire voltage range tested (Fig. 4B).Figure 3Schematic diagram of SLC26A9 deletions and mutants within disordered loop. Those SLC26A9 deletions and mutants in the disordered loop are categorized into three groups for the purpose of defining the borders (Group 1); analyzing the subregions (Group 2) and analyzing the potential phosphorylation sites (Group 3). Dashed lines indicate deleted sequence. Numbers denote amino acid position of the human SLC26A9. In 620 to 628 S/T-rich motif, Serine/Threonine residues are highlighted as blue color. Alanine residues are highlighted as red color in Ala-replacement mutants. Individual deletions and mutants with indicated amino acid positions were constructed and expressed in Xenopus oocytes.Figure 4Deletion of disordered loop increases SLC26A9 function in Xenopus oocytes. A, I to V relationship obtained from voltage-clamp experiments in Xenopus oocytes. SLC26A9 WT (black) and Δ-loop (blue)-injected oocytes were clamped to −60 mV in the ND96 solution (black square) and Cl--free ND96 solution (blue circle). B, the conductance (μSiemens), that is., slope of individual I to V curves calculated between −160 to +60 mV (panel A), for SLC26A9 WT (black) and Δ-loop (red).

D, measurement of intracellular Cl- [Cl-]i activity for SLC26A9-injected oocytes (black) and ΔLoop-injected oocytes (blue). In the presence of ND96 solution, pH 7.5, extracellular Cl- was replaced by gluconate (0 Cl-) to show Cl- channel activity. Average Cl- transport response (Δ [Cl-]i = end[Cl-]i - initial[Cl-]i) in presence of Cl--free ND96 are indicated in the column graphs. E, simultaneous measurement of intracellular pH (pHi) and membrane potential in Xenopus oocytes expressing SLC26A9 (black, left) and Δ-loop (blue, right). In the presence of 5% CO2, 33 mM HCO3, pH 7.5, ND96 solution, extracellular Cl- was replaced by gluconate (0 Cl-) to show Cl--HCO3- exchange activity (increase in pHi during 0 Cl-). The pHi transport response (Δ[pH]i = end[pH]i - initial[pH]i) divided by time of the initial slope (5 min) in units “10-5 pH unit∗s-1,” in presence of 5% CO2, 33 mM HCO3, pH 7.5, ND96 solution are indicated in the column graphs. F, The normalized ratio of anti-flag signal versus WGA (wheat germ agglutinin) signal representing the relative surface protein expression level is displayed for triple-flag tagged SLC26A9 WT and triple-flag tagged SLC26A9 Δloop. The uninjected oocytes were used as negative controls. Individual points in bar graphs are individual oocyte experiments. Error bars represent mean ± SD. Student t test was used for statistical analysis. Individual points in bar graphs are individual oocyte experiments. Error bars represent mean ± SD. ∗∗∗∗ denotes p ≤ 0.0001 by Student’s t test.Measuring intracellular [Cl-] ([Cl-]i) by Cl- microelectrodes reveals that Cl- removal decreased [Cl-]i for SLC26A9-WT (−8.8 ± 0.8 mM) oocytes. The same response to extracellular Cl- ([Cl-]o) removal from SLC26A9 ΔLoop expressing oocytes decreased by 3.6-fold more (−31.67 ± 4.56 mM) (Fig. 4D). This data indicates that SLC26A9 ΔLoop increased the Cl- transport activity of SLC26A9-WT.SLC26A9 functions not only as Cl- transporter-channel but also a nCl--HCO3- exchanger (11, 12, 13, 14). Since enlarged Cl- currents and Cl- transport were observed for Δ-loop, we determined if the Cl--HCO3- exchanger activity was similarly enhanced. To evaluate Cl--HCO3- exchanger activity, we used pH microelectrodes to measure time dependence of intracellular pH (pHi) changes after Cl- removal (d(pHi)/dt; Fig. 4E) and readdition in a CO2/HCO3- buffered bath solution for SLC26A9 WT and SLC26A9 ΔLoop. Fig. 4E and Fig. S5 illustrate that SLC26A9 ΔLoop increased electrogenic nCl--HCO3- exchange activity, that is, SLC26A9 ΔLoop has an increased pHi change and obvious depolarization after switching to the 0 Cl-/5% CO2 solution.Cl- conductance (Fig. 5A) and current (Fig. 5B) of SLC26A9-injected oocytes increases as cRNA amount-injected increases. After injection of 0.5 ng cRNAs, both I(SLC26A9) and I(ΔLoop) were decreased to 1.81 ± 0.26 μA and 19.1 ± 1.59 μA, respectively. For this cRNA concentration, I(ΔLoop) is 10.6-fold greater than I(SLC26A9). With 3 ng cRNAs injected, I(SLC26A9) and I(ΔLoop) were further increased to 7.43 ± 1.07 μA and 88.1 ± 9.77 μA, respectively, that is, I(ΔLoop) is 11.9-fold of I(SLC26A9). Voltage-dependent currents and whole oocyte Cl- conductances both increased similarly with increasing cRNA-injection.Figure 5Dose-dependent effect of Cl-current in SLC26A9 ΔLoop.

The normalized density of the flag signal against the density of WGA signal represents the comparative surface protein expression level. As is shown in Fig. 6C, the normalized Flag/WGA signal for SLC26A9-WT is 1.28 ± 0.52 (mean ± SD). The normalized Flag/WGA signal for SLC26A9 ΔLoop is 0.85 ± 0.36, which is 66% expression level of SLC26A9-WT.Figure 6Functional investigate the boundaries of the disordered Loop within STAS domain of SLC26A9.A, I to V relationship obtained from voltage-clamp experiments in Xenopus oocytes expressing SLC26A9-WT, SLC26A9 ΔLoop, SLC26A9 ΔLoop + Δ5(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop + Δ10(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop + Δ5(C), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop + Δ10(C) in standard ND96 solution.

Schematic diagram of SLC26A9 deletions and mutants within disordered loop. Those SLC26A9 deletions and mutants in the disordered loop are categorized into three groups for the purpose of defining the borders (Group 1); analyzing the subregions (Group 2) and analyzing the potential phosphorylation sites (Group 3). Dashed lines indicate deleted sequence. Numbers denote amino acid position of the human SLC26A9. In 620 to 628 S/T-rich motif, Serine/Threonine residues are highlighted as blue color. Alanine residues are highlighted as red color in Ala-replacement mutants. Individual deletions and mutants with indicated amino acid positions were constructed and expressed in Xenopus oocytes.

Deletion of disordered loop increases SLC26A9 function in Xenopus oocytes. A, I to V relationship obtained from voltage-clamp experiments in Xenopus oocytes.

D, measurement of intracellular Cl- [Cl-]i activity for SLC26A9-injected oocytes (black) and ΔLoop-injected oocytes (blue). In the presence of ND96 solution, pH 7.5, extracellular Cl- was replaced by gluconate (0 Cl-) to show Cl- channel activity. Average Cl- transport response (Δ [Cl-]i = end[Cl-]i - initial[Cl-]i) in presence of Cl--free ND96 are indicated in the column graphs. E, simultaneous measurement of intracellular pH (pHi) and membrane potential in Xenopus oocytes expressing SLC26A9 (black, left) and Δ-loop (blue, right). In the presence of 5% CO2, 33 mM HCO3, pH 7.5, ND96 solution, extracellular Cl- was replaced by gluconate (0 Cl-) to show Cl--HCO3- exchange activity (increase in pHi during 0 Cl-).

Measuring intracellular [Cl-] ([Cl-]i) by Cl- microelectrodes reveals that Cl- removal decreased [Cl-]i for SLC26A9-WT (−8.8 ± 0.8 mM) oocytes. The same response to extracellular Cl- ([Cl-]o) removal from SLC26A9 ΔLoop expressing oocytes decreased by 3.6-fold more (−31.67 ± 4.56 mM) (Fig. 4D). This data indicates that SLC26A9 ΔLoop increased the Cl- transport activity of SLC26A9-WT.

SLC26A9 functions not only as Cl- transporter-channel but also a nCl--HCO3- exchanger (11, 12, 13, 14). Since enlarged Cl- currents and Cl- transport were observed for Δ-loop, we determined if the Cl--HCO3- exchanger activity was similarly enhanced. To evaluate Cl--HCO3- exchanger activity, we used pH microelectrodes to measure time dependence of intracellular pH (pHi) changes after Cl- removal (d(pHi)/dt; Fig. 4E) and readdition in a CO2/HCO3- buffered bath solution for SLC26A9 WT and SLC26A9 ΔLoop. Fig. 4E and Fig. S5 illustrate that SLC26A9 ΔLoop increased electrogenic nCl--HCO3- exchange activity, that is, SLC26A9 ΔLoop has an increased pHi change and obvious depolarization after switching to the 0 Cl-/5% CO2 solution.

Cl- conductance (Fig. 5A) and current (Fig. 5B) of SLC26A9-injected oocytes increases as cRNA amount-injected increases. After injection of 0.5 ng cRNAs, both I(SLC26A9) and I(ΔLoop) were decreased to 1.81 ± 0.26 μA and 19.1 ± 1.59 μA, respectively. For this cRNA concentration, I(ΔLoop) is 10.6-fold greater than I(SLC26A9). With 3 ng cRNAs injected, I(SLC26A9) and I(ΔLoop) were further increased to 7.43 ± 1.07 μA and 88.1 ± 9.77 μA, respectively, that is, I(ΔLoop) is 11.9-fold of I(SLC26A9). Voltage-dependent currents and whole oocyte Cl- conductances both increased similarly with increasing cRNA-injection.Figure 5Dose-dependent effect of Cl-current in SLC26A9 ΔLoop.

B, relative currents for ΔLoop (@+60 mV) are dramatically great than that of SLC26A9-injected oocytes when the cRNAs were injected as 0.5 ng, 1 ng, and 3 ng, respectively.

Next, the membrane expression levels of the SLC26A9-WT and SLC26A9 Δ-loop were measured by anti-Flag labeling and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) labeling. The normalized density of the flag signal against the density of WGA signal represents the comparative surface protein expression level. As is shown in Fig. 6C, the normalized Flag/WGA signal for SLC26A9-WT is 1.28 ± 0.52 (mean ± SD). The normalized Flag/WGA signal for SLC26A9 ΔLoop is 0.85 ± 0.36, which is 66% expression level of SLC26A9-WT.Figure 6Functional investigate the boundaries of the disordered Loop within STAS domain of SLC26A9.A, I to V relationship obtained from voltage-clamp experiments in Xenopus oocytes expressing SLC26A9-WT, SLC26A9 ΔLoop, SLC26A9 ΔLoop + Δ5(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop + Δ10(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop + Δ5(C), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop + Δ10(C) in standard ND96 solution.

Functional estimation of the boundaries of the disordered loopBy protein sequence alignment, the STAS-disordered loop of SLC26A9 is predicted to begin at amino acid L562 and end at amino acid A654 (Figs. 1B, 2B). Based on our previous study, deletion of STAS domain containing the disordered loop inhibits Slc26a9 chloride channel’s function (10). Conversely, deletion of only the STAS-disordered loop increases the function of SLC26A9. Therefore, deletions were designed to investigate the boundaries between the STAS domain and the disordered loop. To functionally estimate the disordered loop boundaries, four constructs were made that deleted five or 10 additional amino acids on the N terminus or C terminus of the disordered loop (Fig. 3): SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C). These four constructs were generated using the triple FLAG-tagged SLC26A9 (Fig. 3) and expressed in Xenopus oocytes for functional analysis.Compared to the conductance of SLC26A9 WT (31.24 ± 12.83 μS), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N) showed increased Cl- current (Fig. 6A) and conductance (262.78 ± 105.51 μS) (Fig. 6B), while there is no significant difference from the conductance of SLC26A9 ΔLoop (294.12 ± 120.04 μS). Further N-terminal deletion (SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N)) showed similar Cl- whole-cell currents (Fig. 6A) and conductance (Fig. 6B; 27.85 ± 20.06 μS) to that of SLC26A9 WT. Similarly, SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C) displayed enhanced whole-cell Cl- currents and conductance (280.26 ± 104.53 μS) compared to that of SLC26A9 WT. There is no significant difference between SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C) and SLC26A9 ΔLoop. Furthermore C-terminal deletion (SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C)) showed similar Cl- currents and conductance (27.89 ± 12.64 μS) to that of SLC26A9 WT. Based on the above results, we localized the proximal boundary of the disordered loop into the D557 and the distal boundary into the F659. The 552 to 557 region and the 660 to 664 region should be considered as the part of STAS domain.Membrane expression levels of the SLC26A9-WT, SLC26A9 ΔLoop, SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C) were measured using anti-Flag labeling (3x-Flag tag on each SLC26A9 construct) and WGA labeling (total plasma membrane). As shown in Fig. 6C, the normalized Flag/WGA signals of SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N) (0.64 ± 0.21), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N) (0.42 ± 0.06), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C) (0.75 ± 0.43), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C) (0.40 ± 0.12) are lower than that of SLC26A9-WT (1.28 ± 0.52).

Functional estimation of the boundaries of the disordered loop

By protein sequence alignment, the STAS-disordered loop of SLC26A9 is predicted to begin at amino acid L562 and end at amino acid A654 (Figs. 1B, 2B). Based on our previous study, deletion of STAS domain containing the disordered loop inhibits Slc26a9 chloride channel’s function (10). Conversely, deletion of only the STAS-disordered loop increases the function of SLC26A9. Therefore, deletions were designed to investigate the boundaries between the STAS domain and the disordered loop. To functionally estimate the disordered loop boundaries, four constructs were made that deleted five or 10 additional amino acids on the N terminus or C terminus of the disordered loop (Fig. 3): SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C). These four constructs were generated using the triple FLAG-tagged SLC26A9 (Fig. 3) and expressed in Xenopus oocytes for functional analysis.

Compared to the conductance of SLC26A9 WT (31.24 ± 12.83 μS), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N) showed increased Cl- current (Fig. 6A) and conductance (262.78 ± 105.51 μS) (Fig. 6B), while there is no significant difference from the conductance of SLC26A9 ΔLoop (294.12 ± 120.04 μS). Further N-terminal deletion (SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N)) showed similar Cl- whole-cell currents (Fig. 6A) and conductance (Fig. 6B; 27.85 ± 20.06 μS) to that of SLC26A9 WT. Similarly, SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C) displayed enhanced whole-cell Cl- currents and conductance (280.26 ± 104.53 μS) compared to that of SLC26A9 WT. There is no significant difference between SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C) and SLC26A9 ΔLoop. Furthermore C-terminal deletion (SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C)) showed similar Cl- currents and conductance (27.89 ± 12.64 μS) to that of SLC26A9 WT. Based on the above results, we localized the proximal boundary of the disordered loop into the D557 and the distal boundary into the F659. The 552 to 557 region and the 660 to 664 region should be considered as the part of STAS domain.

Membrane expression levels of the SLC26A9-WT, SLC26A9 ΔLoop, SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C) were measured using anti-Flag labeling (3x-Flag tag on each SLC26A9 construct) and WGA labeling (total plasma membrane). As shown in Fig. 6C, the normalized Flag/WGA signals of SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N) (0.64 ± 0.21), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N) (0.42 ± 0.06), SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(C) (0.75 ± 0.43), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C) (0.40 ± 0.12) are lower than that of SLC26A9-WT (1.28 ± 0.52).

Deletion of specific subregions within disordered loop enhances the functions of SLC26A9Next, the functional significance of specific regions of the STAS-disordered loop of SLC26A9 was investigated. Positively charged amino acids such as Lysine (K) and Arginine (R) are conserved and enriched in the N terminus of the disordered loop, while the Serine (S) and Threonine (T) are conserved and enriched in the C terminus (Fig. 2B). Based on these distinctions, the disordered loop was subdivided into three subregions: (a) K/R-rich subregion (30 aa), (b) middle subregion (31 aa), and (c) S/T-rich subregion (32 aa) (Fig. 1B). The next experiments sought to determine whether the deletion and enhanced function effect depends on the length or on the specific sequence of the disordered loop. One deletion to probe each of the three areas was investigated (Fig. 3, Group 2): SLC26A9 ΔLoop (K/R), SLC26A9 ΔLoop (M), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop (S/T). SLC26A9 ΔLoop (K/R) deletes the K/R-rich region of the disordered loop that incorporates amino acid L562 to amino acid K591 (29 aa). SLC26A9 ΔLoop (M) deletes the middle region the disordered loop that is designated as amino acid T592 to amino acid T620 (28 aa). SLC26A9 ΔLoop (S/T) deletes the S/T-rich region of the disordered loop that encompasses amino acid S621 to amino acid A654 (33 aa).Fig. 7 illustrates that SLC26A9 ΔLoop (K/R) has whole-cell Cl- currents (Fig. 7A) and conductance (Fig. 7B; 336.13  ± 127.83 μS) that are 114% of SLC26A9 ΔLoop (294.12 ± 120.04 μS) and 10.75-fold of SLC26A9 WT (31.24 ± 12.83 μS). SLC26A9 ΔLoop (M) displays Cl- conductance (148.12 ± 80.06 μS) that are 50% of SLC26A9 ΔLoop and 4.7-fold of SLC26A9 WT, while SLC26A9 ΔLoop (S/T) has Cl- conductance (80.17 ± 35.97 μS) that are 27% of SLC26A9 Δ-loop and 2.56-fold of SLC26A9 WT. Evaluation of Cl--nHCO3- exchange activity for these same “Group 2” deletions show results similar to whole-cells currents for the M and S/T regions (Fig. S5).Figure 7Positional deletions of subregions in disordered loop enhance the function of SLC26A9. A, I to V relationship obtained from voltage-clamp experiments in Xenopus oocytes expressing SLC26A9-WT, SLC26A9 ΔLoop, SLC26A9 ΔLoop (K/R), SLC26A9 ΔLoop (M), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop (S/T) in standard ND96 solution. For clarity, SDs are not shown here but rather in Fig. S3. B, the conductance calculated as the slope of I to V curves from voltage-clamp experiments in Xenopus oocytes expressing SLC26A9 WT, SLC26A9 ΔLoop, SLC26A9 ΔLoop (K/R), SLC26A9 ΔLoop (M), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop (S/T) in standard ND96 solution. Individual points in bar graphs are individual oocyte experiments. Error bars represent mean ± SD. The results of the statistical analysis are indicated by lowercase letters, that is,. groups sharing letters are statistically similar, whereas those not sharing any letters are significantly different (p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test for multiple comparisons). C, the normalized ratio of anti-Flag signal versus wheat germ agglutinin signal representing the relative surface protein expression level were displayed for triple-Flag tagged SLC26A9 WT, triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 ΔLoop, triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 ΔLoop (K/R), triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 ΔLoop (M), and triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 ΔLoop (S/T). The uninjected oocytes were used as negative controls. Individual points in bar graphs are individual oocyte experiments. Error bars represent mean ± SD. The results of the statistical analysis are indicated by lowercase letters, that is, groups sharing letters are statistically similar, whereas those not sharing any letters are significantly different (p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test for multiple comparisons). Representative stained oocyte images used for quantification (panel C) are shown in Fig. S4. Representative Cl-/HCO3- exchanger activities are shown in Fig. S5.Likewise, the membrane expression levels of the SLC26A9-WT, SLC26A9 ΔLoop, SLC26A9 ΔLoop(K/R), SLC26A9 ΔLoop(M), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop(S/T) were measured by anti-Flag labeling and WGA labeling as we described above. As shown in Fig. 7C, the normalized Flag/WGA signals of SLC26A9 ΔLoop(K/R) (1.29 ± 0.81), SLC26A9 ΔLoop(M) (1.20 ± 0.63), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop(S/T) (1.25 ± 0.48) are similar to that of SLC26A9-WT (1.28 ± 0.52). Compared to SLC26A9 ΔLoop, the reduced membrane expression of SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N) and SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C) could partially account for the reduction in Cl- conductance. However, while the Cl- conductances of SLC26A9 ΔLoop(M) and SLC26A9 ΔLoop(S/T) are reduced compared to SLC26A9 ΔLoop, the membrane expression levels do not change (compare Fig. 7, B and C).

Deletion of specific subregions within disordered loop enhances the functions of SLC26A9

Next, the functional significance of specific regions of the STAS-disordered loop of SLC26A9 was investigated. Positively charged amino acids such as Lysine (K) and Arginine (R) are conserved and enriched in the N terminus of the disordered loop, while the Serine (S) and Threonine (T) are conserved and enriched in the C terminus (Fig. 2B). Based on these distinctions, the disordered loop was subdivided into three subregions: (a) K/R-rich subregion (30 aa), (b) middle subregion (31 aa), and (c) S/T-rich subregion (32 aa) (Fig. 1B). The next experiments sought to determine whether the deletion and enhanced function effect depends on the length or on the specific sequence of the disordered loop. One deletion to probe each of the three areas was investigated (Fig. 3, Group 2): SLC26A9 ΔLoop (K/R), SLC26A9 ΔLoop (M), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop (S/T). SLC26A9 ΔLoop (K/R) deletes the K/R-rich region of the disordered loop that incorporates amino acid L562 to amino acid K591 (29 aa). SLC26A9 ΔLoop (M) deletes the middle region the disordered loop that is designated as amino acid T592 to amino acid T620 (28 aa). SLC26A9 ΔLoop (S/T) deletes the S/T-rich region of the disordered loop that encompasses amino acid S621 to amino acid A654 (33 aa).

Fig. 7 illustrates that SLC26A9 ΔLoop (K/R) has whole-cell Cl- currents (Fig. 7A) and conductance (Fig. 7B; 336.13  ± 127.83 μS) that are 114% of SLC26A9 ΔLoop (294.12 ± 120.04 μS) and 10.75-fold of SLC26A9 WT (31.24 ± 12.83 μS). SLC26A9 ΔLoop (M) displays Cl- conductance (148.12 ± 80.06 μS) that are 50% of SLC26A9 ΔLoop and 4.7-fold of SLC26A9 WT, while SLC26A9 ΔLoop (S/T) has Cl- conductance (80.17 ± 35.97 μS) that are 27% of SLC26A9 Δ-loop and 2.56-fold of SLC26A9 WT. Evaluation of Cl--nHCO3- exchange activity for these same “Group 2” deletions show results similar to whole-cells currents for the M and S/T regions (Fig. S5).Figure 7Positional deletions of subregions in disordered loop enhance the function of SLC26A9.

C, the normalized ratio of anti-Flag signal versus wheat germ agglutinin signal representing the relative surface protein expression level were displayed for triple-Flag tagged SLC26A9 WT, triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 ΔLoop, triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 ΔLoop (K/R), triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 ΔLoop (M), and triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 ΔLoop (S/T).

Likewise, the membrane expression levels of the SLC26A9-WT, SLC26A9 ΔLoop, SLC26A9 ΔLoop(K/R), SLC26A9 ΔLoop(M), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop(S/T) were measured by anti-Flag labeling and WGA labeling as we described above. As shown in Fig. 7C, the normalized Flag/WGA signals of SLC26A9 ΔLoop(K/R) (1.29 ± 0.81), SLC26A9 ΔLoop(M) (1.20 ± 0.63), and SLC26A9 ΔLoop(S/T) (1.25 ± 0.48) are similar to that of SLC26A9-WT (1.28 ± 0.52). Compared to SLC26A9 ΔLoop, the reduced membrane expression of SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(N) and SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ10(C) could partially account for the reduction in Cl- conductance. However, while the Cl- conductances of SLC26A9 ΔLoop(M) and SLC26A9 ΔLoop(S/T) are reduced compared to SLC26A9 ΔLoop, the membrane expression levels do not change (compare Fig. 7, B and C).

There is no significant difference between S623A (36.65 ± 2.36 μS) and SLC26A9 WT (60.78 ± 17.31 μS). As the triple-Flag–tagged SLC26A9 does not have effect the function and surface expression of SLC26A9 proteins (16), we reconstructed the T620A, S621A, S623A, T626A, and S628A substitutions in this construct. To quantify surface expression, we performed stained oocyte sections with anti-Flag and normalized to membrane labeling with WGA signal for each alanine substitution (Figs 8B and 9, WGA channel). Only S621A exhibited lower surface protein expression (Figs. 8B and 9) coinciding with lowered whole-cell conductance (Fig. 8A). Uninjected and nontagged SLC26A9-expressing oocytes were used as the controls.

DiscussionOur group previously reported that Slc26a9 has three distinct transport models: Cl- channel, nCl-/HCO3- exchanger, and Na+ transporter (12). However, neither Na+ transport nor Na+ dependence of human SLC26A9 has been observed. These earlier studies also demonstrated that Slc26a9 and CFTR have protein–protein interactions via the Slc26a9 STAS domain and the CFTR R-domain (10). Based on prestin (Slc26a5) STAS crystals, a generalized STAS domain has up to six β-strands surrounded by five α-helices (6). Structural and sequence variability is highest in the “loop” between α-helix1 and β-strand3 (4, 20). While Fig. 1B shows that animal sequences diverge outside of mammals (Fig. 1C), there are preserved sequences and motifs in this disordered loop. Nevertheless, the function or molecular significance of the disordered loop (i.e., variable loop or IVS (intervening sequence) within SLC26-STAS domains have not been investigated and are thus unknown. Importantly, the disordered loop is structural significance as its deletion was required for the crystal formation of the prestin (Slc26a5) STAS domain (6) and the cryo-EM structure of Slc26a9 (18).The disordered loop is an inhibitory domain of SLC26A9Noting that deletion of the Slc26a9-STAS domain removed whole-cell currents (10), we initially hypothesized that the variable length and disordered loops of Slc26-STAS domains could account for the different interactions of STAS-domains with the R-region of CFTR. However, the current results show that the deletion of the STAS-disordered loop increases both the SLC26A9 Cl- channel’s activity (whole-cell currents and conductance) and Cl-/HCO3- exchanger activity (Figs. 4 and 7, Fig. S5). This is the first study to functionally analyze the disordered loop in any STAS domain of any SLC26 protein. Thus, the data suggest that at least part of this disordered loop is an inhibitory domain within SLC26A9-STAS–limiting transmembrane ion movements. These data are consistent with the supplemental data of the Slc26a9 cryo-EM work which deleted both the intervening sequence (IVS: P558-V660, i.e., this article’s disordered region) as well as the entire C terminus (18). This investigation found that deleting these regions (Slc26a9T) allowed small crystals for cryo-EM structural analysis, and that in HEK293 cells Slc26a9T displayed much larger whole-cell currents than full-length-Slc26a9 (18). Here, the K/R-rich subregion seems critical for Cl- conductance activation (Fig. 7) and to a lesser extent Cl-/HCO3- exchanger activity (Fig. S5). Deletion of the middle subregion and S/T subregion, not the K/R-rich subregion, of the disordered loop remove part of the blockade increasing SLC26A9 whole-cell conductance but a value less than the complete loop deletion (Fig. 7). These data suggest that the inhibitory domain is located at the middle and distal subregions of the disordered loop (Fig. 1). Our findings provide functional evidence that the STAS-disordered loop contains several regulatory elements associated with the control of SLC26A9 function. Apparently, each of subregion is needed to maintain moderate SLC26A9 activity. Consistent with this idea, there are no missense mutations of the disordered loop sequences of SulP/SLC26 human genes linked to the human disease except for some missense variations in the pendrin (SLC26A5) disordered loop (15, 28). Large Cl- conductances would be predicted to keep intracellular [Cl-] much lower than normal (10–20 mM) making mutations or sequence variations in this region inconsistent with long-term cellular health without a competing pathology.Boundaries of the disordered loopWhile deletion of the Slc26a9 STAS domain virtually eliminates the Cl- currents (10), deletion of the SLC26A9 disordered loop dramatically increase the Cl- current. By generating four additional SLC26A9 constructs (Fig. 2, Group 1) and performing the subsequent experiments (Fig. 4), we localized the proximal boundary of the disordered loop within the region between A552 and D557. The distal boundary of the disordered loop is localized within the region between F659 and T664. By removing 10 amino acids to the N terminus or C terminus there is a loss of cell surface protein expression (Fig. 6C) that in turn results in Cl- current loss (Fig. 6, A and B) compared to that of SLC26A9 ΔLoop. Conversely, cell surface labeling reveals that SLC26A9 ΔLoop has slightly less protein expression than SLC26A9 WT (Fig. 6C even though Cl- currents are increased. Since complete loss of the disordered loop does not dramatically change surface protein expression (Fig. 6C), these data indicate that presence or absence of the disordered loop is not responsible for SLC26A9 protein loss of protein until 10 N-terminal, or 10 C-terminal, amino acids deletions (Fig. 6, B and C). Of note, is that while the conductance of SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N) is equivalent to SLC26A9 ΔLoop, Fig. 6A shows that the reversal potential is about −40 mV similar to SLC26A9 rather than the −60 mV of SLC26A9 ΔLoop. This is unusual because high conductance is often associated with large changes of intracellular ion concentrations. Our working hypothesis is that Δ5(N) may have large single channel conductances but low open probability or very long close times. This argument is speculative and will need to be explored in a future study.Potential phosphorylation sitesSeveral studies have shown that Slc26a3 (29), Slc26a6 (30) and Slc26a9 (13) are controlled by with-no lysine kinases (WNKs). Functional clues for the regulation of anion transport are provided by the identification of the STAS domain in the anion transporters and the bacterial antisigma-factor antagonists such as SpoIIAA.(4) SpoIIAB functions as a phosphokinase and phosphorylates SpoIIAA at S58 (27) to control bacterial sporulation. This critical phosphorylation site (Asp followed by one or two Ser/Thr, then Gly, i.e., motif D[S/T](2)G), is conserved in the Sultr1.2 STAS domain and several other Slc26 STAS domains except for SLC26A1, SLC26A4, and SLC26A9 (Fig. 2B). A high stringency motif scan suggested a potential phosphorylation site at S628 of SLC26A9 located in Ser/Thr motif (620–628 in SLC26A9). Ala substitution of each of these Ser/Thr residues, all reduced SLC26A9 Cl- currents implying a vital role for this Ser/The cluster. This could indicate that phosphorylation of SLC26A9 in Ser/Thr cluster of the disordered loop is needed to maintain basal function. Knepper’s lab found that S586 of SLC26A1 (located in the disordered loop of the SLC26A1 STAS domain) is phosphorylated (31). Intrinsically disordered regions of proteins are often responsible for phospho-regulation. Even though SLC26A9 and SLC26A1 seem to lose a conserved phosphorylation motif (D(S/T)(2)G), the Ala replacement of these sites, especially S621, suggests another functional phosphorylation site may exist in the disordered loop within the STAS domain (Fig. 8A). Presently, we do not know which intracellular kinase might be involved, however, the conductance and proteins expression results imply that phosphorylation regulation can dramatically SLC26A9 activity and thus may be physiologically important.Disorder within order, order within disorder, and complicated regulatory roles of disordered loopRecent studies have indicated that the presence, folding, and structure of STAS domains are important for the transport function of the SLC26 proteins (9, 10). However, without a more systematic study of this region, possible control functions of STAS domain components are anecdotal. Several studies have explored STAS domain structures or predictions but do not include its disordered loop. We sought to explore the impact of this loop by aligning the STAS domains of Bacillus SPOIIAA, Arabidopsis sulfate transporters and human SLC26 anion transporters to categorize this region. Each human SLC26 member (except SLC26A11) has the disordered loop within their STAS domain, while the Bacillus SPOIIAA and the Arabidopsis sulfate transporters do not (Fig. 2B). We grouped the human SLC26 family based on the length of the disordered loop: Group 1 (SLC26A1, SLC26A2, and SLC26A7: ∼30 residues), Group 2 (SLC26A3, SLC26A4, SLC26A5, SLC26A6, and A9; 60–90 residues), and Group 3 (only SLC26A8; longest, 128 residues). Group 2-SLC26 proteins all interact with the R-region of CFTR, making this length classification attractive to reveal hypothetical STAS length-function insights; nevertheless, even these STAS–CFTR interactions seem to result in a variety of functional outcomes for both the SLC26 protein and CFTR. Disordered regions are widely observed in integral membrane proteins (32). Forty percent of the human plasma membrane proteins are predicted to contain long intrinsically disordered protein regions in which the region is more than 30 residues and preferentially occur in cytoplasmic segments (33). The current data indicate that a combination of conserved STAS domain structure and its disordered loop, including the 620 to 628 S/T-rich motif inside of the disordered loop, combine to control the overall conductance of SLC26A9 and likely are a general regulation mechanism for SLC26 anion transporters. The poor conservation of disordered loop among different SLC26 members indicates that its feature is unique to each member allowing for different interactions and functional outcomes. This is merely a working model until a thorough investigation of disordered regions of several SLC26 proteins are investigated.Proposed “filter-gate” modelRecently, Chi and colleagues found that the C-terminal end is bound to the entry of the intracellular vestibule of the potential transport pathway by a cryo-EM structure of human SLC26A9 dimer at 2.6 Å resolution (PBD: 7CH1). Their electrophysiological experiments found that a C-terminal (residue 773–784) truncated SLC26A9 exhibited 3-fold larger currents than that of WT SLC26A9 (19). A new gating mechanism for the SLC26A9’s anion transport by the C-terminal (residue 773–784) was proposed by the authors. Similarly Walter and coworkers inadvertently found that C-terminal removal and IVS (disordered region) deletion, which mouse Slc26a9 currents were increased about 10-fold (see Supplement of (18). The increased conductance of SLC26A9 ΔLoop (residue 562–654) and SLC26A9 ΔLoop (K/R) (residue 562–591) presented here (∼9-fold larger currents and conductance than WT SLC26A9) indicate that the disordered region alone accounts for the larger effect. That is, these data are consistent with the disordered loop contributing to the gating mechanism of SLC26A9 anion transport. Although the full length of disordered loop (intervening STAS sequence) was not resolved by Chi and his colleagues, they found that a short helix after α1 in STAS (α1-extension, part of the disordered loop) is actually well folded and functionally connects the STAS domain to transmembrane span 8 (TM8) (Fig. 10, A and C: initial blue line and red line, K/R region) from another protomer through hydrophilic interactions between Q559 and N35 (19). This is additional evidence that disordered loop, together with the transmembrane region, contributes to the regulation of overall STAS domain and thus controls the activity of SLC26A9.Figure 10Role of disordered loop and S/T motif within STAS domain in the function of SLC26A9 (proposed dimer model). A, SLC26A9 dimer cartoon representing the human SLC26A9 cryo-EM structure (PDB: 7CH1) (19). In the WT SLC26A9 (SLC26A9-wt), the disordered loop (blue line on left, red-brown-green on right, colors in Fig. 7) within STAS domain forms a filter gate as a dimer for the Cl- channel activity. As noted by Chi and co-workers, the STAS domain of monomer 2 (purple) is below monomer 1 (light orange) and interact at TM8. The C terminus of monomer 2, also structurally interacts with TM8 of monomer 1 (see PDZ designation). The same interactions occur between monomer 2 and the STAS and C terminus of monomer 1. B, removal of the gate, results in greatly increased ionic flux (current and conductance). C, certain S/T variants in 620 to 628 subregions (red pentagons) are suggested to change the structure of this “filter gate” and thus alter ion permeation. In the absence of disordered loop (B) or the K/R region (red lines in A, C), we hypothesize that the channel is fully open and the Cl--HCO3- exchange activity is enhanced. STAS, sulfate transporter and anti-sigma.Our model predicts that this “filter-gate” control function of the full disordered loop would then manifest as a removal of the filter and the gate being fully open for SLC26A9 anion channel when the “loop” is deleted (Fig. 4A) or the K/R region is deleted (Fig. 7). This, in turn, would result in maximal transport activity (either Cl- conductance or Cl-/HCO3- exchange; Fig. 10B). Even the smaller disordered-loop deletions (∼30 residues for middle and S/T-rich subregions, respectively) displayed moderately increased function (∼2- to –3-fold) compared to the WT SLC26A9. However, individual replacement of potential phosphorylation sites, for example, the serine or threonine in the S/T-rich motif of disordered loop, are replaced by alanine, SLC26A9 conductance is decreased (Fig. 8A; 18% ∼ 57% of the WT). This could be explained by key filter-gate sites changing such that anion transport of SLC26A9 is hindered (Fig. 10C). These data also support the hypothesis that the disordered loop somehow controls access to or exit from the plasma membrane likely involving TM8 (19). This membrane expression issue becomes clear when moving the SLC26A9 ΔLoop boundaries by 5 and 10 amino acids in either the N-terminal or C-terminal directions (Fig. 6C). Recently, Takahashi and Homma have evaluated anion binding and transport of SLC26A4, SLC26A5, and SLC26A9 (34). This study illustrates clear ionic binding or interactions with SLC26 TM areas, but it does not elucidate any roles for the STAS domains for similar ionic interaction. Currently, it is speculative whether these boundary changes are due to structural protein processing issues or if there may be further functional information due to 3D protein structure constraints. Interestingly, we found a similar “filter-gate” function for a salt-bridge in the N terminus of NBCe1 (SLC4A4, an electrogenic Na+ bicarbonate cotransporter) (35), suggesting that anion (or at least HCO3-) transporters have transport rate (i.e., rheostat) controls outside of the plasma membrane. Perhaps this filter or gate feature allows these SLC4 and SLC26 acid-base transporters to more quickly respond to intracellular environment, thereby helping to maintain intracellular pH or Cl- homeostasis.Perspective: Activating SLC26A9 chloride channel to treat CF?In the lung epithelia, Slc26a9 has overlapping expression with CFTR, making protein–protein interactions important. Slc26a9 channel and transporter activity is inhibited by interaction of its STAS domain with the R-region of CFTR in Xenopus oocytes (10). It is also well known that CFTR interacts with SLC26A3 (36), SLC26A5 (37), SLC26A6 (36) and SLC26A8 (38), mostly with a reciprocal regulatory mechanism through the interaction between the R-domain of CFTR and the STAS domain. Interestingly, cAMP-activation CFTR activity is enhanced with coexpression of SLC26A9 in mammalian cells (11, 17). A genome-wide association study analysis of CF patients indicates that expression of human SLC26A9 is associated with some intestinal, CF phenotypes (39). Indeed, CFTR and SLC26A9 proteins are found in the same epithelia, and SLC26A9 variants are reported to modify or manifest in a CF-like presentation (40, 41). Moreover, Strug and co-workers have also noted that SLC26A9 seems to mediate airway responses to CFTR-directed drugs indicating that the two proteins seem to functionally interact in vivo (42, 43). Combined these studies have led to the hypothesis that SLC26A9 mutations may impart large (monogenic) or small (polygenic) phenotypic effects in CF, stomach-related diseases, and/or other diseases in humans.This study offers new evidence that the anion transport function of SLC26A9 is regulated by the cytoplasmic STAS domain (18), and that the disordered loop inside the STAS domain works similar to a break-inhibitory motif. That is, deletion of the disordered loop dramatically enhanced SLC26A9’s activity (conductance and exchange activity). The SLC26A9 ΔLoop protein (698 aa) is about half the size of the CFTR protein (1480 aa) yet is a high conductance Cl- channel. Thus, the delivery of SLC26A9 ΔLoop construct by engineered AAV, adeno-associated virus, to CF tissue could be a promising strategy for the treatment of CF in absence of functional CFTR. In this context, our findings present an alternative gene therapy strategy for the patients containing different mutations of CFTR.Limitation of the studyWhile our data seem consistent with the SLC26A9-disordered loop functioning as a filter gate or ratchet (i.e, controlling an open-state, closed-state, or both), there could be other explanations. A previous study demonstrated that WNK1, WNK3, and WNK4 can inhibit SLC26A9 activity by limiting plasma membrane expression (13). Similar results were found with kinase dead WNK3 and WNK4 implicating a direct binding to SLC26A9. As we did not test phosphorylation per se, it is possible that the opening and/or closing rates of SLC26A9 could be controlled by the phosphorylation of the candidate phosphorylated site in S/T-rich motif. Reduced conductance and membrane expression of S621A-SLC26A9 (Fig. 8) would be consistent with this possibility. However, this phosphorylation-regulator possibility alone does not easily explain why especially the Δloop(K/R) subdomain has similar Cl- conductance to SLC26A9 Δloop as the S/T-rich motif is still present. Future experiments should likely examine these possibilities as well as their potential interrelationship.

Our group previously reported that Slc26a9 has three distinct transport models: Cl- channel, nCl-/HCO3- exchanger, and Na+ transporter (12). However, neither Na+ transport nor Na+ dependence of human SLC26A9 has been observed. These earlier studies also demonstrated that Slc26a9 and CFTR have protein–protein interactions via the Slc26a9 STAS domain and the CFTR R-domain (10). Based on prestin (Slc26a5) STAS crystals, a generalized STAS domain has up to six β-strands surrounded by five α-helices (6). Structural and sequence variability is highest in the “loop” between α-helix1 and β-strand3 (4, 20). While Fig. 1B shows that animal sequences diverge outside of mammals (Fig. 1C), there are preserved sequences and motifs in this disordered loop. Nevertheless, the function or molecular significance of the disordered loop (i.e., variable loop or IVS (intervening sequence) within SLC26-STAS domains have not been investigated and are thus unknown. Importantly, the disordered loop is structural significance as its deletion was required for the crystal formation of the prestin (Slc26a5) STAS domain (6) and the cryo-EM structure of Slc26a9 (18).

The disordered loop is an inhibitory domain of SLC26A9Noting that deletion of the Slc26a9-STAS domain removed whole-cell currents (10), we initially hypothesized that the variable length and disordered loops of Slc26-STAS domains could account for the different interactions of STAS-domains with the R-region of CFTR. However, the current results show that the deletion of the STAS-disordered loop increases both the SLC26A9 Cl- channel’s activity (whole-cell currents and conductance) and Cl-/HCO3- exchanger activity (Figs. 4 and 7, Fig. S5). This is the first study to functionally analyze the disordered loop in any STAS domain of any SLC26 protein. Thus, the data suggest that at least part of this disordered loop is an inhibitory domain within SLC26A9-STAS–limiting transmembrane ion movements. These data are consistent with the supplemental data of the Slc26a9 cryo-EM work which deleted both the intervening sequence (IVS: P558-V660, i.e., this article’s disordered region) as well as the entire C terminus (18). This investigation found that deleting these regions (Slc26a9T) allowed small crystals for cryo-EM structural analysis, and that in HEK293 cells Slc26a9T displayed much larger whole-cell currents than full-length-Slc26a9 (18). Here, the K/R-rich subregion seems critical for Cl- conductance activation (Fig. 7) and to a lesser extent Cl-/HCO3- exchanger activity (Fig. S5). Deletion of the middle subregion and S/T subregion, not the K/R-rich subregion, of the disordered loop remove part of the blockade increasing SLC26A9 whole-cell conductance but a value less than the complete loop deletion (Fig. 7). These data suggest that the inhibitory domain is located at the middle and distal subregions of the disordered loop (Fig. 1). Our findings provide functional evidence that the STAS-disordered loop contains several regulatory elements associated with the control of SLC26A9 function. Apparently, each of subregion is needed to maintain moderate SLC26A9 activity. Consistent with this idea, there are no missense mutations of the disordered loop sequences of SulP/SLC26 human genes linked to the human disease except for some missense variations in the pendrin (SLC26A5) disordered loop (15, 28). Large Cl- conductances would be predicted to keep intracellular [Cl-] much lower than normal (10–20 mM) making mutations or sequence variations in this region inconsistent with long-term cellular health without a competing pathology.

Boundaries of the disordered loopWhile deletion of the Slc26a9 STAS domain virtually eliminates the Cl- currents (10), deletion of the SLC26A9 disordered loop dramatically increase the Cl- current. By generating four additional SLC26A9 constructs (Fig. 2, Group 1) and performing the subsequent experiments (Fig. 4), we localized the proximal boundary of the disordered loop within the region between A552 and D557. The distal boundary of the disordered loop is localized within the region between F659 and T664. By removing 10 amino acids to the N terminus or C terminus there is a loss of cell surface protein expression (Fig. 6C) that in turn results in Cl- current loss (Fig. 6, A and B) compared to that of SLC26A9 ΔLoop. Conversely, cell surface labeling reveals that SLC26A9 ΔLoop has slightly less protein expression than SLC26A9 WT (Fig. 6C even though Cl- currents are increased. Since complete loss of the disordered loop does not dramatically change surface protein expression (Fig. 6C), these data indicate that presence or absence of the disordered loop is not responsible for SLC26A9 protein loss of protein until 10 N-terminal, or 10 C-terminal, amino acids deletions (Fig. 6, B and C). Of note, is that while the conductance of SLC26A9 ΔLoop+Δ5(N) is equivalent to SLC26A9 ΔLoop, Fig. 6A shows that the reversal potential is about −40 mV similar to SLC26A9 rather than the −60 mV of SLC26A9 ΔLoop. This is unusual because high conductance is often associated with large changes of intracellular ion concentrations. Our working hypothesis is that Δ5(N) may have large single channel conductances but low open probability or very long close times. This argument is speculative and will need to be explored in a future study.

Potential phosphorylation sitesSeveral studies have shown that Slc26a3 (29), Slc26a6 (30) and Slc26a9 (13) are controlled by with-no lysine kinases (WNKs). Functional clues for the regulation of anion transport are provided by the identification of the STAS domain in the anion transporters and the bacterial antisigma-factor antagonists such as SpoIIAA.(4) SpoIIAB functions as a phosphokinase and phosphorylates SpoIIAA at S58 (27) to control bacterial sporulation. This critical phosphorylation site (Asp followed by one or two Ser/Thr, then Gly, i.e., motif D[S/T](2)G), is conserved in the Sultr1.2 STAS domain and several other Slc26 STAS domains except for SLC26A1, SLC26A4, and SLC26A9 (Fig. 2B). A high stringency motif scan suggested a potential phosphorylation site at S628 of SLC26A9 located in Ser/Thr motif (620–628 in SLC26A9). Ala substitution of each of these Ser/Thr residues, all reduced SLC26A9 Cl- currents implying a vital role for this Ser/The cluster. This could indicate that phosphorylation of SLC26A9 in Ser/Thr cluster of the disordered loop is needed to maintain basal function. Knepper’s lab found that S586 of SLC26A1 (located in the disordered loop of the SLC26A1 STAS domain) is phosphorylated (31). Intrinsically disordered regions of proteins are often responsible for phospho-regulation. Even though SLC26A9 and SLC26A1 seem to lose a conserved phosphorylation motif (D(S/T)(2)G), the Ala replacement of these sites, especially S621, suggests another functional phosphorylation site may exist in the disordered loop within the STAS domain (Fig. 8A). Presently, we do not know which intracellular kinase might be involved, however, the conductance and proteins expression results imply that phosphorylation regulation can dramatically SLC26A9 activity and thus may be physiologically important.

Disorder within order, order within disorder, and complicated regulatory roles of disordered loopRecent studies have indicated that the presence, folding, and structure of STAS domains are important for the transport function of the SLC26 proteins (9, 10). However, without a more systematic study of this region, possible control functions of STAS domain components are anecdotal. Several studies have explored STAS domain structures or predictions but do not include its disordered loop. We sought to explore the impact of this loop by aligning the STAS domains of Bacillus SPOIIAA, Arabidopsis sulfate transporters and human SLC26 anion transporters to categorize this region. Each human SLC26 member (except SLC26A11) has the disordered loop within their STAS domain, while the Bacillus SPOIIAA and the Arabidopsis sulfate transporters do not (Fig. 2B). We grouped the human SLC26 family based on the length of the disordered loop: Group 1 (SLC26A1, SLC26A2, and SLC26A7: ∼30 residues), Group 2 (SLC26A3, SLC26A4, SLC26A5, SLC26A6, and A9; 60–90 residues), and Group 3 (only SLC26A8; longest, 128 residues). Group 2-SLC26 proteins all interact with the R-region of CFTR, making this length classification attractive to reveal hypothetical STAS length-function insights; nevertheless, even these STAS–CFTR interactions seem to result in a variety of functional outcomes for both the SLC26 protein and CFTR. Disordered regions are widely observed in integral membrane proteins (32). Forty percent of the human plasma membrane proteins are predicted to contain long intrinsically disordered protein regions in which the region is more than 30 residues and preferentially occur in cytoplasmic segments (33). The current data indicate that a combination of conserved STAS domain structure and its disordered loop, including the 620 to 628 S/T-rich motif inside of the disordered loop, combine to control the overall conductance of SLC26A9 and likely are a general regulation mechanism for SLC26 anion transporters. The poor conservation of disordered loop among different SLC26 members indicates that its feature is unique to each member allowing for different interactions and functional outcomes. This is merely a working model until a thorough investigation of disordered regions of several SLC26 proteins are investigated.

Proposed “filter-gate” modelRecently, Chi and colleagues found that the C-terminal end is bound to the entry of the intracellular vestibule of the potential transport pathway by a cryo-EM structure of human SLC26A9 dimer at 2.6 Å resolution (PBD: 7CH1). Their electrophysiological experiments found that a C-terminal (residue 773–784) truncated SLC26A9 exhibited 3-fold larger currents than that of WT SLC26A9 (19). A new gating mechanism for the SLC26A9’s anion transport by the C-terminal (residue 773–784) was proposed by the authors. Similarly Walter and coworkers inadvertently found that C-terminal removal and IVS (disordered region) deletion, which mouse Slc26a9 currents were increased about 10-fold (see Supplement of (18). The increased conductance of SLC26A9 ΔLoop (residue 562–654) and SLC26A9 ΔLoop (K/R) (residue 562–591) presented here (∼9-fold larger currents and conductance than WT SLC26A9) indicate that the disordered region alone accounts for the larger effect. That is, these data are consistent with the disordered loop contributing to the gating mechanism of SLC26A9 anion transport. Although the full length of disordered loop (intervening STAS sequence) was not resolved by Chi and his colleagues, they found that a short helix after α1 in STAS (α1-extension, part of the disordered loop) is actually well folded and functionally connects the STAS domain to transmembrane span 8 (TM8) (Fig. 10, A and C: initial blue line and red line, K/R region) from another protomer through hydrophilic interactions between Q559 and N35 (19). This is additional evidence that disordered loop, together with the transmembrane region, contributes to the regulation of overall STAS domain and thus controls the activity of SLC26A9.Figure 10Role of disordered loop and S/T motif within STAS domain in the function of SLC26A9 (proposed dimer model). A, SLC26A9 dimer cartoon representing the human SLC26A9 cryo-EM structure (PDB: 7CH1) (19). In the WT SLC26A9 (SLC26A9-wt), the disordered loop (blue line on left, red-brown-green on right, colors in Fig. 7) within STAS domain forms a filter gate as a dimer for the Cl- channel activity. As noted by Chi and co-workers, the STAS domain of monomer 2 (purple) is below monomer 1 (light orange) and interact at TM8. The C terminus of monomer 2, also structurally interacts with TM8 of monomer 1 (see PDZ designation). The same interactions occur between monomer 2 and the STAS and C terminus of monomer 1. B, removal of the gate, results in greatly increased ionic flux (current and conductance). C, certain S/T variants in 620 to 628 subregions (red pentagons) are suggested to change the structure of this “filter gate” and thus alter ion permeation. In the absence of disordered loop (B) or the K/R region (red lines in A, C), we hypothesize that the channel is fully open and the Cl--HCO3- exchange activity is enhanced. STAS, sulfate transporter and anti-sigma.Our model predicts that this “filter-gate” control function of the full disordered loop would then manifest as a removal of the filter and the gate being fully open for SLC26A9 anion channel when the “loop” is deleted (Fig. 4A) or the K/R region is deleted (Fig. 7). This, in turn, would result in maximal transport activity (either Cl- conductance or Cl-/HCO3- exchange; Fig. 10B). Even the smaller disordered-loop deletions (∼30 residues for middle and S/T-rich subregions, respectively) displayed moderately increased function (∼2- to –3-fold) compared to the WT SLC26A9. However, individual replacement of potential phosphorylation sites, for example, the serine or threonine in the S/T-rich motif of disordered loop, are replaced by alanine, SLC26A9 conductance is decreased (Fig. 8A; 18% ∼ 57% of the WT). This could be explained by key filter-gate sites changing such that anion transport of SLC26A9 is hindered (Fig. 10C). These data also support the hypothesis that the disordered loop somehow controls access to or exit from the plasma membrane likely involving TM8 (19). This membrane expression issue becomes clear when moving the SLC26A9 ΔLoop boundaries by 5 and 10 amino acids in either the N-terminal or C-terminal directions (Fig. 6C). Recently, Takahashi and Homma have evaluated anion binding and transport of SLC26A4, SLC26A5, and SLC26A9 (34). This study illustrates clear ionic binding or interactions with SLC26 TM areas, but it does not elucidate any roles for the STAS domains for similar ionic interaction. Currently, it is speculative whether these boundary changes are due to structural protein processing issues or if there may be further functional information due to 3D protein structure constraints. Interestingly, we found a similar “filter-gate” function for a salt-bridge in the N terminus of NBCe1 (SLC4A4, an electrogenic Na+ bicarbonate cotransporter) (35), suggesting that anion (or at least HCO3-) transporters have transport rate (i.e., rheostat) controls outside of the plasma membrane. Perhaps this filter or gate feature allows these SLC4 and SLC26 acid-base transporters to more quickly respond to intracellular environment, thereby helping to maintain intracellular pH or Cl- homeostasis.

Our model predicts that this “filter-gate” control function of the full disordered loop would then manifest as a removal of the filter and the gate being fully open for SLC26A9 anion channel when the “loop” is deleted (Fig. 4A) or the K/R region is deleted (Fig. 7). This, in turn, would result in maximal transport activity (either Cl- conductance or Cl-/HCO3- exchange; Fig. 10B). Even the smaller disordered-loop deletions (∼30 residues for middle and S/T-rich subregions, respectively) displayed moderately increased function (∼2- to –3-fold) compared to the WT SLC26A9. However, individual replacement of potential phosphorylation sites, for example, the serine or threonine in the S/T-rich motif of disordered loop, are replaced by alanine, SLC26A9 conductance is decreased (Fig. 8A; 18% ∼ 57% of the WT). This could be explained by key filter-gate sites changing such that anion transport of SLC26A9 is hindered (Fig. 10C). These data also support the hypothesis that the disordered loop somehow controls access to or exit from the plasma membrane likely involving TM8 (19). This membrane expression issue becomes clear when moving the SLC26A9 ΔLoop boundaries by 5 and 10 amino acids in either the N-terminal or C-terminal directions (Fig. 6C). Recently, Takahashi and Homma have evaluated anion binding and transport of SLC26A4, SLC26A5, and SLC26A9 (34). This study illustrates clear ionic binding or interactions with SLC26 TM areas, but it does not elucidate any roles for the STAS domains for similar ionic interaction. Currently, it is speculative whether these boundary changes are due to structural protein processing issues or if there may be further functional information due to 3D protein structure constraints. Interestingly, we found a similar “filter-gate” function for a salt-bridge in the N terminus of NBCe1 (SLC4A4, an electrogenic Na+ bicarbonate cotransporter) (35), suggesting that anion (or at least HCO3-) transporters have transport rate (i.e., rheostat) controls outside of the plasma membrane. Perhaps this filter or gate feature allows these SLC4 and SLC26 acid-base transporters to more quickly respond to intracellular environment, thereby helping to maintain intracellular pH or Cl- homeostasis.

Perspective: Activating SLC26A9 chloride channel to treat CF?In the lung epithelia, Slc26a9 has overlapping expression with CFTR, making protein–protein interactions important. Slc26a9 channel and transporter activity is inhibited by interaction of its STAS domain with the R-region of CFTR in Xenopus oocytes (10). It is also well known that CFTR interacts with SLC26A3 (36), SLC26A5 (37), SLC26A6 (36) and SLC26A8 (38), mostly with a reciprocal regulatory mechanism through the interaction between the R-domain of CFTR and the STAS domain. Interestingly, cAMP-activation CFTR activity is enhanced with coexpression of SLC26A9 in mammalian cells (11, 17). A genome-wide association study analysis of CF patients indicates that expression of human SLC26A9 is associated with some intestinal, CF phenotypes (39). Indeed, CFTR and SLC26A9 proteins are found in the same epithelia, and SLC26A9 variants are reported to modify or manifest in a CF-like presentation (40, 41). Moreover, Strug and co-workers have also noted that SLC26A9 seems to mediate airway responses to CFTR-directed drugs indicating that the two proteins seem to functionally interact in vivo (42, 43). Combined these studies have led to the hypothesis that SLC26A9 mutations may impart large (monogenic) or small (polygenic) phenotypic effects in CF, stomach-related diseases, and/or other diseases in humans.This study offers new evidence that the anion transport function of SLC26A9 is regulated by the cytoplasmic STAS domain (18), and that the disordered loop inside the STAS domain works similar to a break-inhibitory motif. That is, deletion of the disordered loop dramatically enhanced SLC26A9’s activity (conductance and exchange activity). The SLC26A9 ΔLoop protein (698 aa) is about half the size of the CFTR protein (1480 aa) yet is a high conductance Cl- channel. Thus, the delivery of SLC26A9 ΔLoop construct by engineered AAV, adeno-associated virus, to CF tissue could be a promising strategy for the treatment of CF in absence of functional CFTR. In this context, our findings present an alternative gene therapy strategy for the patients containing different mutations of CFTR.

Perspective: Activating SLC26A9 chloride channel to treat CF?

In the lung epithelia, Slc26a9 has overlapping expression with CFTR, making protein–protein interactions important. Slc26a9 channel and transporter activity is inhibited by interaction of its STAS domain with the R-region of CFTR in Xenopus oocytes (10). It is also well known that CFTR interacts with SLC26A3 (36), SLC26A5 (37), SLC26A6 (36) and SLC26A8 (38), mostly with a reciprocal regulatory mechanism through the interaction between the R-domain of CFTR and the STAS domain. Interestingly, cAMP-activation CFTR activity is enhanced with coexpression of SLC26A9 in mammalian cells (11, 17). A genome-wide association study analysis of CF patients indicates that expression of human SLC26A9 is associated with some intestinal, CF phenotypes (39). Indeed, CFTR and SLC26A9 proteins are found in the same epithelia, and SLC26A9 variants are reported to modify or manifest in a CF-like presentation (40, 41).

This study offers new evidence that the anion transport function of SLC26A9 is regulated by the cytoplasmic STAS domain (18), and that the disordered loop inside the STAS domain works similar to a break-inhibitory motif.

Limitation of the studyWhile our data seem consistent with the SLC26A9-disordered loop functioning as a filter gate or ratchet (i.e, controlling an open-state, closed-state, or both), there could be other explanations. A previous study demonstrated that WNK1, WNK3, and WNK4 can inhibit SLC26A9 activity by limiting plasma membrane expression (13). Similar results were found with kinase dead WNK3 and WNK4 implicating a direct binding to SLC26A9. As we did not test phosphorylation per se, it is possible that the opening and/or closing rates of SLC26A9 could be controlled by the phosphorylation of the candidate phosphorylated site in S/T-rich motif. Reduced conductance and membrane expression of S621A-SLC26A9 (Fig. 8) would be consistent with this possibility. However, this phosphorylation-regulator possibility alone does not easily explain why especially the Δloop(K/R) subdomain has similar Cl- conductance to SLC26A9 Δloop as the S/T-rich motif is still present. Future experiments should likely examine these possibilities as well as their potential interrelationship.

Experimental proceduresTopology, multiple sequence alignment, and phylogenetic analysisThe 14 transmembrane regions of SLC26A9 in Fig. 1 are predicted by the topology of rat prestin (44). The amino acid sequences of STAS domain of Slc26a9 proteins: Homo sapiens (human), Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee), Equus caballus (horse), Bos taurus (cattle), Sus scrofa domesticus (pig), Mus musculus (mouse), Rattus norvegicus (rat), Gallus gallus (chicken), Meleagris gallopavo (turkey), Xenopus laevis (frog), Ophiophagus Hannah (king cobra), Oreochromis niloticus (nile tilapia), Gasterosteidae (stickleback), and other SLC26 members (SLC26A1–SLC26A9) were obtained from NCBI database and aligned using the Clustal Omega algorithm (25). The border of STAS domain and its disordered loop are based on the SpoIIAA and other Slc26 proteins (4, 6). The phylogenetic tree of disordered loop in Slc26a9 proteins were generated by DNAMAN software (Lynnon Biosoft; https://www.lynnon.com/dnaman.html).Prediction of disorder in STAS domain in SLC26 familyPredication of disorder in STAS domain in SLC26 family was made using the PONDR XL1 predictor. The PONDR XL1 predictor is a feedforward neural network optimized to predict regions of disorder greater than 39 amino acids (45). The sequences of STAS domain of SLC26 family (SLC26A1–SLC26A9) are listed in Table S1.Generation of SLC26A9 mutants and deletionsThe human SLC26A9’s ORF was amplified by PCR, sequence verified and subcloned into the Xenopus expression vector pGEMHE. Generation of triple FLAG-tagged SLC26A9 was reported by our group (Chen et al., 2012) for surface expression assay. This 3xFLAG-tag did not change function and expression of human SLC26A9. Using site-directed mutagenesis (PfuTurbo DNA polymerase, Stratagene), we generated single site mutants—T620A, S621A, S623A, T626A, S628A—and small deletions, namely, ΔLoop, ΔLoop+Δ5(N), ΔLoop+Δ5(C), ΔLoop+Δ10(N), ΔLoop+Δ10(C), ΔLoop(K/R), ΔLoop(M), ΔLoop(S/T) of SLC26A9 by taking the 3xFLAG-tagged SLC26A9-pGEMHE as template. The positive clones were verified by sequencing prior to experiments. In the following section, the SLC26A9 indicate the “SLC26A9-WT” for functional analysis and “triple FLAG-tagged SLC26A9-WT” for surface protein expression detection. The mutants and small deletions of SLC26A9 indicate the “mutants and small deletions of triple FLAG-tagged SLC26A9” for the functional analysis and surface protein expression detection (Fig. 9).Animal health and welfareX. laevis were housed and cared for in accordance and approval of the Institutional Care and Use Committees of Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science.Oocyte experimentsFemale X. laevis were purchased from Xenopus Express. Oocytes were removed and collagenase dissociated (46, 47). Capped cRNA was synthesized with the T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNA (10, 12) or water. Equal injection of cRNA was confirmed by UV absorbance (A260) and ethidium bromide staining.Surface immunofluorescence stainingXenopus oocytes were injected with cRNAs encoding triple-Flag–tagged human SLC26A9 WT, SLC26A9 ΔLoop, and its other deletions, respectively. Seventy-twohours postinjection, the oocytes were fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 1 h, followed by 100 mM glycine in PBS for 30 min. Then, the oocytes were stored in 30% sucrose at 4 °C overnight and were frozen in Cryomolds with OCT (Optimal cutting temperature compound; (Tissue-Tek) with liquid N2. Ten micrometers sections were cut using a cryostat (Leica) and mounted on slides coated with poly-L-Lysine solution (Sigma-Aldrich, P4832). Sections were rehydrated with PBS for 5 min. WGA with Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate (Fisher Healthcare, W32466) was used at a concentration of 5.0ug/ml for 10 min at room temperature (RT). The slides were washed twice with PBS and then blocked for 1 h at RT (10% donkey serum, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBST (PBS with 0.2% Triton-X). A mouse anti-Flag tag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804) was used at a 1:200 dilution overnight at 4 °C. Sections were washed 3x (total of 30 min) with PBST and then a donkey anti mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, 715-545-150) was applied at 1:500 dilution for 1 h at RT. Slides were washed 4x (total of 40 min) with PBST. Cover slips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc, H-1500-10) and then imaged using a Zeiss Observer inverted microscope and Zen software (Carl Zeiss,. Inc.; https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/us/products/software/zeiss-zen.html). Within Zen, images were gathered in single sessions, making sure to not change light intensities nor imaging parameters. Fluorescence was quantified using ImageJ software (https://imagej.net/ij/). The membrane region of each oocyte was selected with the freehand contour tool and the fluorescence intensity of the regions was measured. The raw intensity density of the flag signal was normalized to the raw intensity density of the WGA signal (Fig. 8B).Electrophysiology solutionsAll solutions were either ND96 (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.5) or iso-osmotic ion replacements (10, 12, 48). Cl- was replaced by gluconate unless indicated otherwise. For HCO3- solutions, we used 5% CO2/33 mM HCO3- (pH 7.5).Two-electrode voltage clampAs previously described (10, 12), oocytes were injected with 0.5 ng, 1 ng or 3 ng cRNA, and membrane currents were recorded with an OC-725C voltage clamp (Warner Instruments), filtered at 2 to 5 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz. The I to V protocol was held at −60 mV and 40-ms steps from −160 mV to +60 mV by 20-mV using HEKA software (HEKA Elektronik, Harvard Bioscience Inc; https://www.heka.com/) (10, 12).Ion-selective microelectrodesIon-selective microelectrodes were used to monitor pHi and intracellular Cl- ([Cl-]i) oocytes (10, 12, 47, 48, 49). Intracellular pH and Cl- microelectrodes had slopes of at least −54 mV/pH unit or decade, respectively.Statistical analysisValue quantities of ion activities or currents are indicated as the mean ± SD, and n is the number of experiments. One-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test was performed using GraphPad Prism software (https://www.graphpad.com/) to determine statistical significance. The p value adjusted in one-way ANOVA less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
