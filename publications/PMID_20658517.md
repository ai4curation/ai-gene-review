We investigated the possible functional- and physical protein-interactions 
between two airway Cl(-) channels, SLC26A9 and CFTR. Bronchial CFBE41o- cell 
lines expressing CFTR(WT) or CFTR(ΔF508) were transduced with SLC26A9. 
Immunoblots identified a migrating band corresponding to SLC26A9 present in 
whole-cell lysates as on apical membrane of cells grown on polarized filters. 
CFTR levels were increased by the presence of SLC26A9 in both CFTR(WT) and 
CFTR(ΔF508) cell lines. In CFBE41o- cells and CFBE41o-/CFTR(WT) cells transduced 
with SLC26A9, currents associated to the protein expression were not detected. 
However, the forskolin (FK)-stimulated currents were enhanced in 
SLC26A9-transduced cells compared to control cells. Therefore, the presence of 
SLC26A9 resulted in an increase in CFTR activity (same % of CFTR((inh)-172) or 
GlyH-101 inhibition in both groups). In CFBE41o-/CFTR(ΔF508) cells transduced 
with SLC26A9 (at 27°C), a current associated to the protein expression was also 
lacking. FK-stimulated currents and level of CFTR((inh)-172) inhibition were not 
different in both groups. The presence of SLC26A9 in Xenopus oocytes expressing 
CFTR also enhanced the FK-stimulated currents as compared to oocytes expressing 
CFTR alone. This stimulation was mostly linked to CFTR. An enhancement of 
FK-stimulated currents was not found in oocytes co-expressing SLC26A9 and 
CFTR(ΔF508). In conclusion, in both protein expression systems used, SLC26A9 
stimulates CFTR activity but not that of CFTR(ΔF508). Our co-immunoprecipitation 
studies demonstrate a physical interaction between both anion channels. We 
propose as an alternative hypothesis (not exclusive) to the known SLC26A9-STAS 
domain/CFTR interaction, that SLC26A9 favors the biogenesis and/or stabilization 
of CFTR, leading to stimulated currents.
