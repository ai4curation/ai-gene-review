Introduction

Internalization of plasma membrane receptors by endocytosis is regulated by ubiquitination and leads to receptor sorting into intralumenal vesicles at the endosome giving rise to multivesicular bodies [ 1 – 3 ]. The sorting process is catalyzed by ESCRTs (Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) and their associated molecules [ 2 , 4 , 5 ]. Part of the same machinery is recruited by some enveloped viruses to facilitate budding [ 6 – 9 ] and during cytokinesis of eukaryotes [ 10 – 12 ] and Crenarchaea [ 13 , 14 ].

The ESCRT pathway is linked to the activity of deubiquitinating enzymes (deubiquitinase, DUB, or ubiquin hydrolase or deubiquitylating enzyme) in order to maintain a constant pool of ubiquitin [ 15 ]. DUB Doa4 has an essential recycling role in the yeast MVB pathway [ 16 ] and controls the function of ESCRTs [ 17 ]. The mammalian MVB pathway employs several DUBs including AMSH (associated molecule with the Src homology 3 domain of STAM, also known as STAMBP) [ 18 ], AMSH-LP (AMSH-like protein) [ 19 ] and UBPY (Ub-specific protease Y) [ 20 ]. Both AMSH and UBPY are recruited early in the pathway via interaction with the ESCRT-0 subunit STAM [ 21 – 23 ] and their localization to early endosomes is supported by interaction with the clathrin heavy chain [ 24 ].

Deubiquitination by AMSH is thought to precede cargo incorporation into MVB vesicles and lysosomal degradation [ 25 , 26 ]. Depletion of AMSH was reported to increase degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [ 18 ]. In contrast a dominant negative form of CHMP3 prevents AMSH localization to the endosome, which in turn inhibits EGFR degradation [ 27 ]. Other studies implicate UBPY in the control of EGFR ubiquitination [ 20 , 22 , 28 ]. Besides EGFR, AMSH is involved in downregulation of the calcium sensing receptor [ 29 ], G protein-coupled receptors [ 30 ], the protease-activated receptor 2 [ 31 ] and the CXCR4 chemokine receptor [ 32 ]. The latter study suggests that AMSH not only regulates cargo ubiquitination but also ubiquitination of the endocytic machinery [ 32 ]. Furthermore, depletion of AMSH leads to defects in cytokinesis [ 33 ] and inactive AMSH exerts a dominant negative effect on retrovirus budding [ 34 , 35 ].

The N-terminus of AMSH is predicted to contain a MIT domain [ 36 ]. This is followed by a central proline rich region providing the framework for STAM SH3 domain binding [ 37 ], which was suggested to control the isopeptidase activity of the C-terminal JAMM domain, a metalloprotease with specificity for K63-linked polyubiquitin chains [ 19 , 21 ]. AMSH interacts with ESCRT-III CHMP1 [ 35 , 36 ], CHMP2A and CHMP3 [ 21 , 27 , 34 - 36 , 38 ] as well as Ist1 [ 39 ]. ESCRT-III proteins are auto-inhibited in the cytosol [ 34 , 40 , 41 ]. Activation leads to membrane interaction [ 42 , 43 ] and polymerization in vitro [ 41 , 44 – 46 ] and in vivo inducing membrane deformation [ 47 ]. Current models implicate ESCRT-I and II in vesicle formation [ 48 ] while the ordered assembly of ESCRT-III catalyzes membrane fission [ 49 – 52 ]. ESCRT-III proteins contain MIT domain interacting motifs (MIMs) within their C-termini which bind to MIT domains of VPS4 and spastin [ 53 – 56 ].

In order to understand the structural basis of the AMSH-CHMP3 interaction we defined an N-terminal AMSH domain (AMSHΔC) by proteolysis that allowed the isolation of a soluble complex with a C-terminal fragment of CHMP3. The crystal structure of AMSHΔC-CHMP3ΔN reveals an unconventional MIT domain within AMSHΔC. The CHMP3 C-terminus adopts a helical conformation upon binding and the molecular details of the interaction provide a novel MIM sequence motif. Although CHMP3 binds with high affinity to AMSH, ESCRT-III CHMP1A and B show only micromolar interactions. Mutagensis studies suggest further that AMSH employs a different molecular surface for CHMP1 interaction. Structural analyses indicate that the N-terminal helix preceding the MIT domain is mobile consistent with data demonstrating that this region might control the activity of AMSH during HIV-1 budding. Although the CHMP3-AMSH interaction site overlaps with the VPS4 binding site the high K D renders it unlikely to be displaced by VPS4.

Discussion

Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) AMSH and UBPY targeting ESCRT-III play an important role in ESCRT regulated processes [ 15 , 61 , 62 ] and many ESCRT-III interaction partners recognize sequence motifs located within the C-terminus of ESCRT-III family members [ 34 , 35 , 53 , 55 , 56 , 63 ]. The crystal structure of AMSH in complex with CHMP3 demonstrates that the C-terminal CHMP3 MIM adopts a helical conformation, which is induced by complex formation, since the same peptide is unstructured in solution. However our CD analysis also suggest that part of it might be structured within full-length CHMP3 and thus contribute to the autoinhibited conformation of CHMP3 [ 34 , 40 , 64 ]. The structure of AMSH contains a region that resembles a MIT domain as predicted [ 36 ], which interacts with the CHMP3 MIM. However, we propose that the structure does not qualify as a classical MIT domain [ 63 ], due to the presence of an N-terminal region including helix 1 and because of the 90 Å-long extension of helix 5 (corresponding to helix 3 of a MIT domain). This is further supported by the poor solubility of the MIT-like domain of AMSH on its own and by AMSHΔC lacking helix 1 in vitro (Solomons et al. unpublished results). However, the general mode of target recognition is similar to that of MIT domains. CHMP3 binds in a helical conformation diagonal along a groove made up by helices 3 (VPS4 MIT helix 2) and 4/5 (VPS4 MIT helix 3). The AMSH-CHMP3 interaction site resembles VPS4 interactions with CHMP1A or yeast Vps2p, which employ helices 2 and 3 for the recognition of a shorter helical motif (MIM 1) [ 53 ] [ 55 ]. In contrast the spastin MIT domain interacts with a helical segment of CHMP1B via its helices 1 and 3 [ 56 ]. The same groove between helices 1 and 3 is employed by VPS4 to bind the CHMP6 MIM2 motif [ 54 ] and by Vps4 (Saci1372) from Crenarchaea to interact with the MIM2-like motif present in the ESCRT-III-like protein Saci1373 [ 65 ]. The general MIT-MIM contacts range from mostly hydrophobic interactions observed in the VPS4-CHMP1A, Vps4p-Vps2p, VPS4B-CHMP6 and Saci1372 (Vps4-like)-Saci1373 (ESCRT-II-like) complexes [ 53 – 55 , 65 ] to a mixture of polar and hydrophobic interactions in case of spastin MIT and CHMP1B [ 56 ] to mostly polar contacts dominating the AMSH-CHMP3 complex. Thus the structure of the AMSH-CHMP3 complex extends the diversity of MIT domain interaction surfaces for peptide ligands.

AMSH was reported to interact not only with CHMP3 but also with CHMP1A/B and CHMP2A [ 35 ]. SPR measurements show that both CHMP1A and B interact with low micromolar affinities with AMSH. The low the sequence conservation between CHMP3 and CHMP1A/B and the fact that two AMSH mutants that show up to a 130 times lower CHMP3 binding activity still interact with CHMP1B, indicate that CHMP1 and CHMP3 binding sites do not overlap. This is further indirectly supported by the low sequence similarity between AMSH and UBPY that both bind CHMP1A/B [ 22 , 35 ].

The ~ 60 nM K d for the CHMP3-AMSH interaction is to date the highest K d reported for an ESCRT-III MIM-MIT interaction. In contrast spastin-MIT binds to CHMP1A with a K d of 12 μM K d [ 56 ] ~ 3 times higher than the ~30 μM determined for the VPS4-MIT-MIM1 and MIM2 interactions [ 53 – 55 , 65 ]. The high affinity interaction between CHMP3 and AMSH is mainly mediated by 6 salt bridges along the CHMP3 helix compared to 2 salt bridges in case of the spastin-MIT-CHMP1B interaction. Furthermore the total solvent-accessible surface area buried upon complex formation is 1650 Å 2 (20 residues) compared to 1946 Å 2 (24 residues) of the spastin-CHMP1B complex [ 56 ] and 1238 Å 2 (15 residues) for the Vps4 MIT-Vps2 complex [ 55 ]. The importance of CHMP3 Arg216, which makes a double dent salt bridge with AMSH Glu104 and of an intact CHMP3 C-terminus, has been documented by mutagenesis analysis. Notably, deletion of residues 221 and 222 lead to a loss of interaction [ 34 ] consistent with the structural details revealing that CHMP3 Arg221 forms a salt bridge with AMSH Glu72 and the carboxyl group of the C-terminal CHMP3 Ser222 contacts AMSH Lys107 via a salt bridge. Vice versa we show here that mutagenesis of AMSH residues Lys88, Glu104 and Lys107 abrogates CHMP3 binding in vitro .

In yeast, Doa4 DUB activity has been genetically linked to Snf7 (CHMP4) and Bro1, which leads to endosomal recruitment after ESCRT-III assembly [ 66 ] [ 67 ]. It is thus conceivable that AMSH is also recruited to ESCRT-III polymers assembled on cellular membranes [ 49 , 50 ]. The helical extension of the MIT domain could then serve as a long arm to position the DUB activity [ 19 ] > 20 nm away from the ESCRT-III polymer ( Figure 7 ) thus reaching into the vesicle formed by ESCRT-I and II [ 48 ] for deubiquitination of cargo.

The MIM 1 sequence motif responsible for VPS4 interaction [ 53 ] overlaps with the CHMP3-AMSH binding site and superpositioning of the VPS4A-CHMP1B and VPS4B-CHMP2A structures with AMSH-CHMP3 demonstrates the overlap of the binding motifs, which prohibits simultaneous binding of AMSH and VPS4 to CHMP3. Although we do not know the sequence of recruitment, it is most likely that AMSH has to be released from CHMP3 before interacting with VPS4. Since the AMSH interaction is ~ 300 fold tighter than VPS4 binding, a specific mechanism must exist such as potential conformational changes that release AMSH from CHMP3 before it becomes a target for VPS4-driven ESCRT-III disassembly [ 68 ].

The structure of AMSHΔC resembles the structure of the N-terminal domain of USP8/UBPY, a DUB acting in the ESCRT pathway [ 58 ]. This structural similarity is not evident from the low sequence similarity of AMSH and UBPY. One notable structural difference is however the different conformation of a short N-terminal segment that is attached to the core of the monomer in case of AMSHΔC and is detached in UBPY mediating dimerization in the crystal [ 58 ]. N-terminal fusions of catalytic inactive AMSH have been shown previously to exert a dominant negative effect on HIV-1 and MLV budding [ 34 , 35 ], which was confirmed by our assay. However destabilization of the N-terminus by structure based mutagenesis led to the loss of the dominant negative effect indicating that an intact N-terminus is important for budding inhibition, which correlated with the ability to interact with CHMP3. Since we observed the dramatic effect of the N-terminal MBP fusion on the oligomerization states of AMSH in vitro we reexamined the role of AMSH in HIV-1 budding by using C-terminal-tagged versions of AMSH. This showed indeed that catalytic inactive AMSH-HA has no effect on HIV-1 budding and only a mild effect upon co-expression with CHMP3, which was abrogated by the AMSH mutations that destabilize helix 1 interaction with the core. We conclude from these results that (i) N-terminal fusions of AMSH change the function of AMSH, which renders it dominant negative in combination with its ESCRT-III binding partner CHMP3. This function requires an intact N-terminus and is disturbed by His4 and Arg14 mutations. (ii) Destabilization of the N-terminus is not sufficient to induce a strong dominant negative effect of AMSH-HA, indicating that mutations of His4 and Arg14 interfere with the structural changes required to become dominant negative. In summary we have provided structural principles of a novel MIT-like MIM interaction. The structural and functional analyses demonstrate that conformational plasticity of the N-terminus might play an important role in the regulation of AMSH activity. This might entail activation of the catalytic activity by either STAM binding [ 21 ] or other regulatory factors.
