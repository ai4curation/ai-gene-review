Functional inactivation of p53 and constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB 
pathway has been associated with several human cancers. In this study, we show 
that IkappaB kinase 2 (IKK2/IKKbeta), which is critical for NF-kappaB 
activation, also phosphorylates p53. Phosphorylation of p53 at serines 362 and 
366 by IKK2 leads to its recruitment to and ubiquitination by beta-TrCP1. 
Degradation of ubiquitinated p53 is independent of Mdm2, because it occurs in 
both wild-type and Mdm2(-/-) cells. SiRNA-mediated reduction in the levels of 
beta-TrCP1 and other members of the SCF(beta-TrCP1)E3 ubiquitin ligase complex 
or overexpression of a dominant negative form of beta-TrCP1 enhances p53 
stability. Substitutions at Ser-362 and 366 of p53 by alanines (p53 AA) result 
in reduced phosphorylation of p53 by IKK2, decreased association with 
beta-TrCP1, and thus increased stability of p53 and expression of p53 target 
genes such as p21, altering the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Our results identify 
IKK2 and beta-TrCP1 as novel regulators of the p53 pathway and suggest that 
blocking of IKK2 and beta-TrCP1 could be a means of regulating p53 stability and 
thereby modulating its biological activity.

Abstract

Functional inactivation of p53 and constitutive activation of the NF-κB pathway has been associated with several human cancers. In this study, we show that IκB kinase 2 (IKK2/IKKβ), which is critical for NF-κB activation, also phosphorylates p53. Phosphorylation of p53 at serines 362 and 366 by IKK2 leads to its recruitment to and ubiquitination by β-TrCP1. Degradation of ubiquitinated p53 is independent of Mdm2, because it occurs in both wild-type and Mdm2 −/− cells. SiRNA-mediated reduction in the levels of β-TrCP1 and other members of the SCF β−TrCP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex or overexpression of a dominant negative form of β-TrCP1 enhances p53 stability. Substitutions at Ser-362 and 366 of p53 by alanines (p53 AA) result in reduced phosphorylation of p53 by IKK2, decreased association with β-TrCP1, and thus increased stability of p53 and expression of p53 target genes such as p21, altering the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Our results identify IKK2 and β-TrCP1 as novel regulators of the p53 pathway and suggest that blocking of IKK2 and β-TrCP1 could be a means of regulating p53 stability and thereby modulating its biological activity.

Discussion

We have found that IKK2 phosphorylates p53 at serines 362 and 366, facilitating degradation of p53, independent of Mdm2 and NF-κB. Although we only detected p53 serine 366 phosphorylation in vivo, due to the limited availability of serine 366 phosphorylation–specific antibody, we cannot exclude the possibility of serine 362 phosphorylation. Interestingly, phosphopeptide mapping ( Fig. 1 C ) produced much stronger signal for serine 366 phosphorylation than for serine 362 phosphorylation. Thus, phosphorylation on serine 366 by IKK2 likely plays a more important role in the cellular context.

We have previously shown that IKK2 can promote p53 destabilization through NF-κB– mediated Mdm2 expression ( 27 ). Our present findings indicate yet another mechanism through which IKK2 directly regulates p53 degradation ( Fig. 5 D ). This alternative mechanism of p53 phosphorylation by IKK2 could provide an Mdm2-independent mechanism of attenuating p53 response. A study of the kinetics of phosphorylation of p53 immediately after DNA damage showed that S15 phosphorylation precedes phosphorylation of p53 at S366 ( Fig. 5 C ). This may be an important mechanism in resolving p53 activity after DNA damage response.

It is well known that phosphorylation of IκBs by IKK2 results in ubiquitination of IκBs by β-TrCP, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and WD40 repeat–containing F-box protein ( 28 ). Our findings indicate that β-TrCP1 also can bind to p53, promote p53 ubiquitination, and regulate p53 steady-state levels only in the presence of IKK2. In addition, we found that β-TrCP1 functions independently of Mdm2. Although p53 lacks a consensus DS(p)GXXS(p) phospho-dependent binding motif for β-TrCP, binding of p53 to β-TrCP1 requires phosphorylation. β-TrCP has been identified as the E3 ligase for ubiquitination of Wee1, p100, and Smad3, all of which lack the consensus binding motif for β-TrCP ( 29 – 31 ). Therefore, it is reasonable to propose that IKK2 phosphorylation at serines 362 and 366 targets p53 for ubiquitination by β-TrCP1.

Mdm2 is a well-established important regulator of p53 turnover; however, a number of studies have shown that degradation of p53 can occur independent of Mdm2. HPV E6 protein, JNK, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), RING domain-containing protein Pirh2, and COP1 have been shown to promote p53 ubiquitination independent of Mdm2 ( 32 – 36 ). It has been demonstrated that adenovirus E1B55K and E4orf6 proteins function together to promote p53 ubiquitination and degradation through a Cullin-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex ( 37 ). β-TrCP is strikingly similar to the E4orf6 ubiquitin ligase complex, in that each contains a substrate recognition subunit linked to a Cullin/Rbx1 subcomplex through either Elongin BC or the Elongin C-like protein Skp1. Previous studies have suggested that the viral protein E4orf6 may have evolved functions similar to those of unidentified cellular regulators of p53 degradation; thus, β-TrCP possibly could be a cellular homolog of E4orf6. It is interesting to note that mice lacking Cullin1, a subunit of the β-TrCP–SCF complex, have higher levels of p53 during embryonic development ( 38 ). Similarly, p53 is more stabilized in cells in which Cullin1 has been knocked down ( Fig. 3 E ).

There is growing evidence that inflammatory genes induced by NF-κB are critical components of tumor progression ( 39 , 40 ). Although it has been shown that cytokines (such as IL-6, an NF-κB target gene) may disturb the p53 tumor-suppressor pathway ( 41 – 43 ), they do not modulate p53 stability. In line with this observation, we found no effect of TNF-α, which efficiently activates the NF-κB pathway, on the stability of p53 ( Fig. S6 ). However, the presence of DNA damage in cancers arising at the sites of chronic inflammation (where IKK2 could be constitutively activated by the cytokines) could provide an apt clinical setting in which constitutively active IKK2 possibly could regulate p53 stability and function over a long period. Further in vivo demonstration of a physiological role for IKK2 in controlling p53 function has shown that cell type–specific deletion of IKK2 in mice leads to stabilization of p53 and plays an important role in p53-induced apoptosis in the intestine ( 44 ).

The programs governing tumorigenesis are complex and varied. Our findings may point toward a novel mechanism that can explain the role of constitutive IKK2 observed in the progression of several cancers. Further studies are needed to investigate whether elevated IKK2 activity and decreased p53 levels are correlated in human biopsy specimens. The role of IKK2 in regulating p53 steady-state levels makes IKK2 an attractive target for developing therapeutic strategies for human cancers.
