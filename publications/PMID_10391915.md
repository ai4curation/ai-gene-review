We have identified a new human cDNA, L-amino acid transporter-2 (LAT-2), that 
induces a system L transport activity with 4F2hc (the heavy chain of the surface 
antigen 4F2, also named CD98) in oocytes. Human LAT-2 is the fourth member of 
the family of amino acid transporters that are subunits of 4F2hc. The amino acid 
transport activity induced by the co-expression of 4F2hc and LAT-2 was 
sodium-independent and showed broad specificity for small and large zwitterionic 
amino acids, as well as bulky analogs (e.g. BCH 
(2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid)). This transport activity was 
highly trans-stimulated, suggesting an exchanger mechanism of transport. 
Expression of tagged N-myc-LAT-2 alone in oocytes did not induce amino acid 
transport, and the protein had an intracellular location. Co-expression of 
N-myc-LAT-2 and 4F2hc gave amino acid transport induction and expression of 
N-myc-LAT-2 at the plasma membrane of the oocytes. These data suggest that LAT-2 
is an additional member of the family of 4F2 light chain subunits, which 
associates with 4F2hc to express a system L transport activity with broad 
specificity for zwitterionic amino acids. Human LAT-2 mRNA is expressed in 
kidney >>> placenta >> brain, liver > spleen, skeletal muscle, heart, small 
intestine, and lung. Human LAT-2 gene localizes at chromosome 14q11.2-13 (13 cR 
or approximately 286 kb from marker D14S1349). The high expression of LAT-2 mRNA 
in epithelial cells of proximal tubules, the basolateral location of 4F2hc in 
these cells, and the amino acid transport activity of LAT-2 suggest that this 
transporter contributes to the renal reabsorption of neutral amino acids in the 
basolateral domain of epithelial proximal tubule cells.
