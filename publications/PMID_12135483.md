Telomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase responsible for synthesizing 
telomeric DNA at the ends of chromosomes. Six subunits composing the telomerase 
complex have been cloned: hTR (human telomerase RNA), TEP1 
(telomerase-associated protein 1), hTERT (human telomerase reverse 
transcriptase), hsp90 (heat shock protein 90), p23, and dyskerin. In this study, 
we investigated the role of each the telomerase subunit on the activity of 
telomerase. Through down- or upregulation of telomerase, we found that only 
hTERT expression changed proportionally with the level of telomerase activity. 
The other components, TEP1, hTR, hsp90, p23, and dyskerin remained at high and 
unchanged levels throughout modulation. In vivo and in vitro experiments with 
antisense oligonucleotides against each telomerase component were also 
performed. Telomerase activity was decreased or abolished by antisense 
treatment. To correlate clinical sample status, four pairs of normal and 
malignant tissues from patients with oral cancer were examined. Except for the 
hTERT subunit, which showed differential expression in normal and cancer 
tissues, all other components were expressed in both normal and malignant 
tissues. We conclude that hTERT is a regulatable subunit, whereas the other 
components are expressed more constantly in cells. Although hTERT has a 
rate-limiting effect on enzyme activity, the other telomerase subunits (hTR, 
TEP1, hsp90, p23, dyskerin) participated in full enzyme activity. We hypothesize 
that once hTERT is expressed, all other telomerase subunits can be assembled to 
form a highly active holoenzyme.
