The small hydrophobic (SH) protein is a short channel-forming polypeptide 
encoded by the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV). Deletion of SH protein 
leads to the viral attenuation in mice and primates, and delayed apoptosis in 
infected cells. We have used a membrane-based yeast two-hybrid system (MbY2H) 
and a library from human lung cDNA to detect proteins that bind SH protein. This 
led to the identification of a membrane protein, B-cell associated protein 31 
(BAP31). Transfected SH protein co-localizes with transfected BAP31 in cells, 
and pulls down endogenous BAP31. Titration of purified C-terminal endodomain of 
BAP31 against isotopically labeled SH protein in detergent micelles suggests 
direct interaction between the two proteins. Given the key role of BAP31 in 
protein trafficking and its critical involvement in pro- and anti-apoptotic 
pathways, this novel interaction may constitute a potential drug target.
