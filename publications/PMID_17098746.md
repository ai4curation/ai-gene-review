The p53 tumor suppressor is regulated by post-translational modification, 
including ubiquitination, phosphorylation and acetylation. It has previously 
been shown that the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 also promotes the conjugation of 
Nedd8, a ubiquitin-like protein, to p53, inhibiting its transcriptional 
activity. We report the identification of FBXO11, a member of the F-box protein 
family and a component of the Skp1.Cullin1.F-box (SCF) complex, as a new 
p53-interacting protein. We show that FBXO11 promotes the neddylation of p53 
both in vitro and in vivo. In addition to the C-terminal lysine residues, FBXO11 
can also promote Nedd8 conjugation to Lys-320 and Lys-321, and neddylation of 
p53 leads to suppression of p53 function. This is consistent with recent studies 
showing that a lysine to arginine mutation at Lys-320 significantly enhances p53 
function, although Lys-320 was originally identified as an acetylation site 
involving PCAF-mediated activation of p53. Our study provides an example of an 
F-box protein acting as an adaptor protein that can mediate the neddylation of a 
non-cullin substrate.

Abstract

The p53 tumor suppressor is regulated by post-translational modification, including ubiquitination, phosphorylation and acetylation. It has previously been shown that the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 also promotes the conjugation of Nedd8, a ubiquitin-like protein, to p53, inhibiting its transcriptional activity. We report the identification of FBXO11, a member of the F-box protein family and a component of the Skp1·Cullin1·F-box (SCF) complex, as a new p53-interacting protein. We show that FBXO11 promotes the neddylation of p53 both in vitro and in vivo . In addition to the C-terminal lysine residues, FBXO11 can also promote Nedd8 conjugation to Lys-320 and Lys-321, and neddylation of p53 leads to suppression of p53 function. This is consistent with recent studies showing that a lysine to arginine mutation at Lys-320 significantly enhances p53 function, although Lys-320 was originally identified as an acetylation site involving PCAF-mediated activation of p53. Our study provides an example of an F-box protein acting as an adaptor protein that can mediate the neddylation of a non-cullin substrate.

DISCUSSION

Mdm2 has been established as a key regulator of p53 activity. Knockout of Mdm2 in mice results in loss of p53 inhibition and p53-dependent embryonic death that can be rescued by knockout of Trp53 ( 40 , 41 ). Mdm2 inhibits p53 primarily through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Mdm2 ubiquitinates p53 on six C-terminal lysines and targets it to the proteasome for degradation ( 4 , 5 ). Interestingly, Mdm2 was also shown to have Nedd8 ligase activity for p53, and the neddylation of p53 was shown to be inhibitory, although the significance of this pathway in vivo is not yet clear ( 9 ). Studies on Mdm2 have shed light on important aspects of p53 regulation, but Mdm2-independent pathways are also known to be involved in activating and repressing p53. A number of proteins, including MdmX, COP1, Pirh2, and ARF-BP1 were found to be involved in the ubiquiti-nation and degradation of p53 ( 42 – 45 ), while several other proteins are known to regulate p53 activity through phosphorylation and acetylation ( 3 ).

In this report, we show that FBXO11, a novel p53-interacting protein that is a component of the SCF complex, can promote the neddylation of p53 and is an inhibitor of p53 transcriptional activity. FBXO11, a component of the SCF complex, was able to promote Nedd8 conjugation to p53 both in vivo and in vitro . FBXO11 does not promote the ubiquitination of p53 in vivo , and it does not affect p53 stability both in overexpression and in siRNA knockdown experiments.

We show that a p53-Nedd8 fusion protein, used to mimic Nedd8 conjugation to the C terminus of p53, has decreased transcription activation function compared with wild-type p53, in accordance with previous data suggesting that Nedd8 conjugation to p53 is inhibitory ( 9 ). While we expect that Nedd8 fusion to the C terminus of p53 approximates the effect of Nedd8 conjugation to lysines at the extreme C terminus of the protein, as previously reported for ubiquitin fusion proteins ( 38 , 39 ), we recognize that this is an artificial system that may not fully recapitulate the effect of p53 neddylation by FBXO11 in vivo . In particular, Nedd8 C-terminal fusion does not approximate Nedd8 conjugation to Lys-320 and Lys-321, two internal lysines located within a nuclear localization signal, as discussed below, and may not have a similar effect on p53 sub-cellular localization as FBXO11-mediated neddylation. We also show that FBXO11 is an inhibitor of p53 function, as knockdown of FBXO11 using three different siRNA oligos results in an increase in the level of the p53 target p21, without affecting p53 stability.

While Mdm2 was reported to promote the neddylation of p53 on three lysine residues in the C-terminal regulatory domain of p53, we found that FBXO11 also neddylates p53 on two lysines, Lys-320 and Lys-321, within a nuclear localization signal that spans residues 300–323. This raises the possibility that neddylation by FBXO11 may affect p53 localization, sequestering p53 away from its nuclear site of action, but this issue is yet to be addressed. Interestingly, a recent report showed that thymocytes, epithelial, and retinal cells and E1A/Ras-expressing mouse embryonic fibroblasts from mice carrying a homozygous lysine 317 to arginine mutation, the site corresponding to human lysine 320, undergo increased p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage compared with wild-type cells, whereas p53 level remains unchanged ( 46 ). This data suggests that modification at lysine 320 is important for the repression of p53 activity in vivo , and it would be interesting to see whether FBXO11-mediated neddylation has a role in this repression.

The observation that a RING finger-containing complex is able to promote Nedd8 conjugation of p53 is in line with other evidence showing that RING finger proteins, including Mdm2 and c-Cbl, can act as Nedd8 E3 ligases ( 9 , 17 ). Roc1, the RING domain-containing subunit of SCF, was in fact the first protein shown to have Nedd8 ligase activity in the Cullin1 neddylation reaction. It is somewhat surprising, however, that FBXO11 can bind p53 without promoting its ubiquitination or degradation, since SCF complexes are generally thought to be involved in the ubiquitination and proteasomal targeting of their substrates. Our data suggests that the SCF complex can also promote nondegradative modifications of target proteins, and we give the first example of an SCF protein promoting Nedd8 conjugation to its substrate. This finding raises the question of whether F-box proteins can promote the neddylation of additional non-cullin substrates. It would be interesting to see whether other F-box proteins, some of which have already been shown to ubiquitinate their targets and affect their stability, can also promote Nedd8 conjugation, and whether neddylation has a role in the regulation of substrate degradation.

It is unclear how the modular SCF complex, which comprises three constant subunits, Skp1, Cullin1, Roc1, and a variable substrate-binding F-box protein could distinguish between Nedd8 and ubiquitin conjugation. FBXO11 is a member of the F-box protein sub-family lacking a distinct unifying domain (the O in FBXO11 stands for other) ( 24 ). The two other F-box sub-families are FBXW, for proteins containing WD-40 repeat domains that are involved in phosphoprotein binding ( 47 ), and FBXL, for proteins containing leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which also mediate protein-protein interactions ( 48 , 49 ). A few F-box proteins have been well studied; among them Skp2 (FBXL1), β -Trcp (FBXW1), Cdc4 (FBXW7), and structural studies suggest that the SCF complex maintains a C-shape structure with the substrate-binding domain of the F-box protein at one end and the Roc1/E2 subunits at the other ( 50 , 51 ). Although Cullin1 acts as a scaffold, maintaining the overall rigid structure of the complex, the variable F-box protein could provide flexibility, particularly through the linker region between the F-box and substrate-binding domains, in the positioning of the substrate relative to Roc1 and the E2 enzyme, which could allow for differential recruitment of Nedd8 versus ubiquitin-conjugating machinery.

p53 was previously shown to be neddylated and inhibited by Mdm2. We report here the identification of a novel Nedd8 ligase for p53, FBXO11, a component of the SCF complex, and show that FBXO11 is an inhibitor of p53 transcriptional activity. Although the role of Nedd8 modification in the regulation of p53 in vivo is not yet understood, our results raise the possibility that Nedd8 conjugation may be involved in the regulation of p53 function under some conditions. FBXO11 was initially identified as Vit1 , a gene located on chromosome 2p21 and down-regulated in vitiligo, a skin disorder characterized by loss of melanocytes ( 52 ). It would be interesting to determine whether the p53 Nedd8-conjugation pathway has a role in this or in similar disease processes.
