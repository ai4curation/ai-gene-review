In animal cells, the centrosome is the main microtubule-organizing centre where 
microtubules are nucleated and anchored. The centriole subdistal appendages 
(SDAs) are the key structures that anchor microtubules in interphase cells, but 
the composition and assembly mechanisms of SDAs are not well understood. Here, 
we reveal that centrosome-binding proteins, coiled-coil domain containing (CCDC) 
120 and CCDC68 are two novel SDA components required for hierarchical SDA 
assembly in human cells. CCDC120 is anchored to SDAs by ODF2 and recruits CEP170 
and Ninein to the centrosome through different coiled-coil domains at its N 
terminus. CCDC68 is a CEP170-interacting protein that competes with CCDC120 in 
recruiting CEP170 to SDAs. Furthermore, CCDC120 and CCDC68 are required for 
centrosome microtubule anchoring. Our findings elucidate the molecular basis for 
centriole SDA hierarchical assembly and microtubule anchoring in human 
interphase cells.
