Telomerase synthesizes telomeres at the ends of human chromosomes during S 
phase. The results presented here suggest that telomerase activity may be 
regulated by intranuclear trafficking of the key components of the enzyme in 
human cells. We examined the subcellular localization of endogenous human 
telomerase RNA (hTR) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in HeLa 
cervical carcinoma cells. Throughout most of the cell cycle, we found that the 
two essential components of telomerase accumulate at intranuclear sites separate 
from telomeres. However, during S phase, both hTR and hTERT are specifically 
recruited to subsets of telomeres. The localization of telomerase to telomeres 
is dynamic, peaking at mid-S phase. We also found complex associations of both 
hTR and hTERT with nucleoli and Cajal bodies during S phase, implicating both 
structures in the biogenesis and trafficking of telomerase. Our results mark the 
first observation of human telomerase at telomeres and provide a mechanism for 
the cell cycle-dependent regulation of telomere synthesis in human cells.
