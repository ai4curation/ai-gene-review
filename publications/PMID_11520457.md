In contrast to the current model of MHC class I trafficking, which predicts that 
once a MHC class I molecule leaves the ER, it moves to the cell surface by bulk 
flow, we show that HLA-G that is loaded with suboptimal peptides is retrieved 
from post-ER compartments to the ER. Loading of HLA-G with high-affinity 
peptides abrogates this retrieval due to the lack of binding affinity to 
coatomer. Moreover, the loss of the endocytosis motif in the truncated 
cytoplasmic tail results in the prolonged half-life of HLA-G on the cell 
surface. Our findings reveal that surface expression of HLA-G can be further 
regulated in post-ER compartments and that the truncated cytoplasmic tail plays 
a critical role in such quality-control mechanisms.
