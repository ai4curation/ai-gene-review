Adenovirus E1A drives oncogenesis by targeting key regulatory pathways that are 
critical for cellular growth control. The interaction of E1A with p400 is 
essential for many E1A activities, but the downstream target of this interaction 
is unknown. Here, we present evidence that the oncoprotein transcription factor 
Myc is the target of this interaction. We show that E1A stabilizes Myc protein 
via p400 and promotes the coassociation of Myc and p400 at Myc target genes, 
leading to their transcriptional induction. We also show that E1A requires Myc 
for its ability to activate Myc-dependent gene expression and induce apoptosis, 
and that forced expression of Myc is sufficient to rescue the activity of an 
E1A-mutant defective in p400 binding. Together, these findings establish that 
Myc, via p400, is an essential downstream target of E1A.

Abstract

Adenovirus E1A drives oncogenesis by targeting key regulatory pathways that are critical for cellular growth control. The interaction of E1A with p400 is essential for many E1A activities, but the downstream target of this interaction is unknown. Here, we present evidence that the oncoprotein transcription factor Myc is the target of this interaction. We show that E1A stabilizes Myc protein via p400 and promotes the coassociation of Myc and p400 at Myc target genes, leading to their transcriptional induction. We also show that E1A requires Myc for its ability to activate Myc-dependent gene expression and induce apoptosis, and that forced expression of Myc is sufficient to rescue the activity of an E1A-mutant defective in p400 binding. Together, these findings establish that Myc, via p400, is an essential downstream target of E1A.

Results and Discussion

To examine the effects of E1A on Myc protein stability, human U2OS cells were infected with the Ad5 adenovirus dl520 , which expresses WT 12S E1A, and endogenous Myc protein levels were assessed by Western blot (WB; Fig. 1 A ). Six to 8 h after infection, at the point at which E1A expression was first detected, we observed an increase in steady-state Myc levels, which gradually subsided over a 12- to 24-h period. Consistent with previous reports ( 5 ), the increase in Myc protein levels at 6 h was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of Myc mRNA ( Fig. 1 B ). Although Baluchamy et al. ( 7 ) have reported that adenovirus activates Myc gene expression, these experiments were done in quiescent cells; our assays, and those of Lohr et al. ( 5 ), were performed in cycling cells, suggesting that regulation of Myc transcription by adenovirus is influenced by the growth status of the cells.

The transient increase in Myc levels we observed, together with the decline in Myc mRNA, suggested that Myc is stabilized during the course of adenovirus infection. This notion was confirmed by treating infected cells with cyclohexamide (CHX), and monitoring Myc levels by WB ( Fig. 1 C ). Under these conditions, adenovirus stabilized Myc considerably, and in a manner that depended on E1A; a virus that expresses LacZ (β-gal) instead of E1A did not induce Myc stability ( Fig. 1 C ). Importantly, expression of E1A alone was sufficient to stabilize Myc; retroviral expression of 12S E1A in U2OS cells resulted in a potent stabilization of Myc ( Fig. 1 D ) and a commensurate decrease in Myc mRNA levels ( Fig. 1 E ). Thus, confirming earlier work ( 5 ), E1A promotes Myc stability.

E1A has been shown to interact with multiple subunits of the 19S proteasome, and this interaction has been proposed to inhibit proteasomal proteolysis ( 6 ). Because Myc proteolysis requires proteasome function ( 8 ), global inhibition of proteasome activity by E1A could account for its ability to stabilize Myc. It is important to note, however, that E1A has not been shown to elicit widespread proteasome inhibition in vivo . We therefore asked whether adenoviral infection stabilizes the synthetic protein U-GFP ( 9 ), a substrate that is widely used as an in vivo reporter of proteasome activity ( Fig. 1 F ). Under conditions where adenovirus stabilized Myc, there was little, if any, change in the rate of destruction of U-GFP, demonstrating that proteasome function is not generally attenuated in adenovirus-infected cells. This notion was supported by comparing the effects of adenovirus infection and proteasome inhibition on Myc localization [ supporting information (SI) Fig. S1 ]. Whereas proteasome inhibition results in the redistribution of Myc from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus ( 10 ), infection of cells with adenovirus expressing E1A did not significantly alter the nuclear distribution of the Myc protein. Thus the consequences of stabilization of Myc by E1A are different from those of proteasome inhibition. Taken together, these data support a model in which the ability of E1A to stabilize Myc does not involve general inhibition of proteasome function.

Conclusions

Together, our data support a model in which the binding of E1A to p400 promotes the formation of a Myc–p400 complex at Myc-target gene promoters. The increase in interaction of Myc and p400 is associated with stabilization of the Myc protein and an induction of Myc target genes. These functions of E1A are required for its ability to induce the ARF/p53 pathway, promote apoptosis, and drive cellular transformation, revealing that the downstream arm of the E1A–p400 interaction is mediated via Myc. Although it has long been known that E2F functions as the downstream target of the E1A–Rb interaction, the molecular processes downstream of the E1A–p400 connection have remained obscure. Our data indicate that Myc is the ultimate target of this connection. This finding not only provides an explanation for the overlapping biological functions of Myc and E1A, but also reveals an interesting viral strategy for promoting oncogenesis. By targeting and activating both the E2F and Myc transcriptional networks, E1A can provoke a synergistic response in parallel pathways to efficiently couple cell cycle progression, transformation, and apoptosis. Moreover, given that E1A targets cellular pathways relevant to transformation, our data also support an important role for the Myc–p400 connection in human cancer.
