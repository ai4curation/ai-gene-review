In the past decades, there have been numerous studies in the gene therapy for 
Parkinson's disease (PD), especially in delivering genes of enzymes for dopamine 
(DA) synthesis. Gene therapy in PD appears to be at the brink of the clinical 
study phase. However, there are many questions that need to be solved before 
this approach can be contemplated clinically, especially the question about the 
control of DA production because too much DA could cause toxicity. Until 
recently, few studies have investigated the relation between DA production and 
PD improvement and respective expressed human tyrosine hydroxylase (hTH), human 
GTP-cyclohydrolase 1 (hGCH1), and human aromatic acid decarboxylase (hAADC) in 
ex vivo gene therapy for PD. Now, we have developed a simple, fast, and reliable 
method to assay the activities of TH and AADC and have provided the possibility 
of ex vivo gene therapy for PD by genetically modifying cells with separate hTH, 
hGCH1, and hAADC genes. Using the method, we found though hTH, hGCH1, and hAADC 
genes were expressed, respectively, they could fulfil the function of DA 
synthesis by incubating together in vitro, and more DA was synthesized in vitro 
when hTH, hGCH1, and hAADC genes were expressed together rather than hTH and 
hAADC genes expressed or hTH expressed. The result suggests that we could easily 
control DA production in ex vivo gene therapy before transplantation. By 
combining this method and microdialysis, we also could further investigate the 
DA production in vitro and in vivo and then decide the optimal number and ratio 
of different transduced cells to improve the therapy of PD. Thus, the method has 
potential use in ex vivo gene therapy of PD.
