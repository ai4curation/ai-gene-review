ISL1 is a LIM homeodomain protein that plays an important role in insulin gene 
transcriptional activation and islet cell formation. BETA2 is a transcription 
factor in the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family, which activates expression 
of tissue-specific genes in several developmental systems. In this study, we 
investigated the functional and physical interactions of ISL1 and BETA2 in 
promoting insulin gene transcription in non-beta cells. Using the luciferase 
assay, we demonstrated that ISL1 and BETA2 could activate insulin gene 
transcription synergistically. Co-immunoprecipitation also supported that ISL1 
and BETA2 appear in one complex and this physical interaction mediates the 
synergy between these two proteins.
