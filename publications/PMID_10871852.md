Identifying mechanisms that underlie the resistance of human melanoma to 
radiation and chemotherapy is expected to assist in developing new strategies 
for the treatment of this tumor type. We recently demonstrated that through 
up-regulation of TNFalpha, ATF2 increases the resistance of late stage melanoma 
cells to apoptosis induced by UV-irradiation. In elucidating the role of ATF2 
kinases, we now demonstrate that ASK1/MKK6/p38 elicits suppression of Fas 
expression. ASK1/p38 downregulates the expression of a Fas via NF-kappaB/SP1 
site on the Fas promoter. Deletion or mutation of NF-kappaB/SP1 within the Fas 
promoter abrogates p38 effect. ASK1/p38 silences the Fas promoter by inhibition 
of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation - thereby limiting NF-kappaB activity. Forced 
expression of a dominant negative form of p38 (p38-ASP) or treatment with p38 
pharmacological inhibitor, SB203580, increases NF-kappaB activity, Fas 
expression and the levels of UVC-induced apoptosis in late stage melanoma cells. 
Inhibition of p38 activity also restored NF-kappaB activity and Fas expression 
in early-phase melanoma cells, suggesting that p38 elicited suppression of Fas 
expression is not restricted to late phase melanoma. Identifying p38-mediated 
down-regulation of Fas expression illustrates a novel regulatory pathway by 
which ASK1/MKK6/p38 alters the degree and nature of the UV-induced apoptosis of 
melanoma cells. Oncogene (2000).
