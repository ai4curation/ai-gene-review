The cycle of deacylation and reacylation of phospholipids plays a critical role 
in regulating availability of arachidonic acid for eicosanoid production. The 
major yeast lysophospholipid acyltransferase, Ale1p, is related to mammalian 
membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) proteins. We expressed four human 
MBOATs in yeast strains lacking Ale1p and studied their acyl-CoA and 
lysophospholipid specificities using novel mass spectrometry-based enzyme 
assays. MBOAT1 is a lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) acyltransferase with 
preference for oleoyl-CoA. MBOAT2 also prefers oleoyl-CoA, using 
lysophosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidylethanolamine as acyl acceptors. MBOAT5 
prefers lysophosphatidylcholine and lyso-PS to incorporate linoleoyl and 
arachidonoyl chains. MBOAT7 is a lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase with 
remarkable specificity for arachidonoyl-CoA. MBOAT5 and MBOAT7 are particularly 
susceptible to inhibition by thimerosal. Human neutrophils express mRNA for 
these four enzymes, and neutrophil microsomes incorporate arachidonoyl chains 
into phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, PS, and phosphatidylethanolamine 
in a thimerosal-sensitive manner. These results strongly implicate MBOAT5 and 
MBOAT7 in arachidonate recycling, thus regulating free arachidonic acid levels 
and leukotriene synthesis in neutrophils.
