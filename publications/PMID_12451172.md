The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor plays a pivotal role in cholesterol 
metabolism. Inherited mutations that disturb the activity of the receptor lead 
to elevations in plasma cholesterol levels and early-onset coronary 
atherosclerosis. Defects in either the LDL receptor or apolipoprotein B, the 
proteinaceous component of LDL particles that binds the LDL receptor, elevate 
circulating LDL-cholesterol levels in an autosomal-dominant fashion, with 
heterozygotes displaying values between homozygous and normal individuals. 
Rarely, similar clinical phenotypes occur with a recessive pattern of 
inheritance, and several genetic lesions in the autosomal recessive 
hypercholesterolemia (ARH) gene on chromosome 1 have been mapped in this class 
of patients. ARH has an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain 
evolutionarily related to that found in Disabled-2 and numb, two endocytic 
proteins. PTB domains bind to the consensus sequence FXNPXY, corresponding to 
the internalization motif of the LDL receptor. We show here that in addition to 
the FXNPXY sequence, ARH binds directly to soluble clathrin trimers and to 
clathrin adaptors by a mode involving the independently folded appendage domain 
of the beta subunit. At steady state, ARH colocalizes with endocytic proteins in 
HeLa cells, and the LDL receptor fluxes through peripheral ARH-positive sites 
before delivery to early endosomes. Because ARH also binds directly to 
phosphoinositides, which regulate clathrin bud assembly at the cell surface, our 
data suggest that in ARH patients, defective sorting adaptor function in 
hepatocytes leads to faulty LDL receptor traffic and hypercholesterolemia.
