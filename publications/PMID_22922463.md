Abstract

The role of microtubules (MTs) in the control and dynamics of the immune synapse (IS) remains unresolved. Here, we show that T cell activation requires the growth of MTs mediated by the plus-end specific protein end-binding 1 (EB1). A direct interaction of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex with EB1 provides the molecular basis for EB1 activity promoting TCR encounter with signalling vesicles at the IS. EB1 knockdown alters TCR dynamics at the IS and prevents propagation of the TCR activation signal to LAT, thus inhibiting activation of PLCγ1 and its localization to the IS. These results identify a role for EB1 interaction with the TCR in controlling TCR sorting and its connection with the LAT/PLCγ1 signalosome.

Introduction

The T cell receptor (TCR) complex is exposed on the surface of T cells, and is formed by heterodimers of ligand-binding subunits, either TCR-α and TCR-β (in αβ T cells) or TCR-γ and TCR-δ (in γδ T cells), which associate with the signal-transducing subunits CD3γ, -δ, -ε and -ζ ( van der Merwe and Dushek, 2011 ). The cytoplasmic tails of CD3γ, -δ and -ε contain a single copy of a motif called ITAM (immune-receptor tyrosine-based activation motif), whereas CD3ζ contains three ITAMs. ITAMs are phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation by kinases of the src family. Phosphorylated ITAMs are docking sites for SH2-domain containing proteins ( Schamel et al, 2006 ). ITAM phosphorylation is necessary for the polarization of the centrosome to the immune synapse (IS; Lowin-Kropf et al, 1998 ), which is therefore dependent on Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinase activity ( Lowin-Kropf et al, 1998 ; Martin-Cofreces et al, 2006 ; Etienne-Manneville, 2010 ). Centrosome movement is dependent on the dynein/dynactin motor, which allows sustained TCR activation ( Martin-Cofreces et al, 2008 ) and polarized secretion ( Huse et al, 2008 ). The movement of the centrosome carries cytoplasmic organelles, including the Golgi, multivesicular bodies and the mitochondria network, towards the IS ( Calabia-Linares et al, 2011 ), contributing to TCR signalling and IS formation ( Baixauli et al, 2011 ).

The specific function of microtubules (MTs) in T cell activation is poorly understood. MTs are large polymers of α/β-tubulin dimers that control intracellular organelle distribution and trafficking ( Etienne-Manneville, 2010 ). MTs show intrinsic polarity, with minus-ends that can anchor to the centrosome to avoid rapid de-polymerization ( Li and Gundersen, 2008 ). MT plus-ends show dynamic instability, being able to switch between growing and shrinkage phases. End-binding proteins (EBs) are highly conserved and ubiquitous plus-end tracking proteins (+TIP) ( Tirnauer and Bierer, 2000 ). The three EBs (EB1, 2 and 3) are small dimeric proteins that contain an N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, which is able to bind to MTs. These proteins possess, at their C-terminus, a flexible acidic tail that contains the sequence EEY/F, required for self-inhibition and binding to various partners, that can control MT growth ( Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008 ; Manna et al, 2008 ).

In this study, EB1 was found to bind to the CD3 ITAMs. Knockdown of EB1 in T cells prevents TCR clustering at the IS and the correct phosphorylation of LAT and PLCγ1. We found that EB1 regulates vesicular trafficking at the IS and therefore the connection between the TCR and downstream signalling molecules, such as LAT/PLCγ1. These results suggest that TCR–EB1 interaction may play a dual role at the IS, controlling both TCR sorting and its encounter with the LAT/PLCγ1 signalosome.

Discussion

In this study, we report the role of the +TIP MT-associated protein EB1 in IS formation and T cell activation in cells of human and mouse origin. We identify a new function for EB1 in connecting the trajectories of signalling vesicles at the IS, allowing coordinated transfer of the activation signal from the TCR to the LAT signalosomes.

The MT network organized around the MTOC has historically been viewed as a static scaffold for vesicle movement in polarized secretion ( Stinchcombe and Griffiths, 2007 ) or for specific signalling microclusters at the IS ( Lasserre et al, 2010 ; Hashimoto-Tane et al, 2011 ). The MT network was also found to be important for maintaining the contact area of T cells with a stimulating surface ( Bunnell et al, 2001 ). The dynamics of the tubulin cytoskeleton has been analysed in T cells in terms of post-translational modifications, particularly acetylation of lysine 40 in the α-tubulin subunit, which marks a population of more stable MTs ( Serrador et al, 2004 ). Overexpression of histone-deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), which deacetylates acetylated α-tubulin, prevents localization of the TCR at the centre of the IS and the translocation of the MTOC. CD3ζ ( Serrador et al, 2004 ) and ZAP70 ( Huby et al, 1995 ) signalling components of the TCR complex have been shown to associate with α-tubulin upon TCR stimulation, and this is prevented by chemical inhibition of HDAC6 ( Serrador et al, 2004 ). A specific relationship is thus established between tubulin and the TCR complex during T cell activation. However, the specific growth of MTs at the IS and the role of this process has not been addressed previously. We detected active and specific tubulin polymerization at the IS, paralleling the localized polymerization of actin ( Gomez and Billadeau, 2008 ). Our data show that the centrosome of the activated T lymphocyte is very active as a centre of tubulin polymerization (MTOC) upon TCR engagement, and its translocation to the IS facilitates the localization of newly polymerized MTs to this active cellular location. These MTs may serve to guide the trafficking of specific vesicles at the IS to the plasma membrane and from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments since inhibition of MT growth through specific knock-down of EB1 ( Komarova et al, 2009 ), prevents the correct movement of vesicles. Other foci of MT growth, unrelated to the centrosome and the Golgi Apparatus ( Vinogradova et al, 2009 ), may contribute to intracellular traffic at the IS and further studies should elucidate their role.

EB1 is composed of two well-differentiated domains: a globular CH domain that encompasses the N-terminal half of the protein and binds to MTs, and a C-terminal homodimerization domain. In the EB1 homodimer, the C-terminal domain adopts a novel coiled-coil, four-helix bundle conformation. Our results show that EB1 interacts through this four-helix bundle domain with the ITAM of CD3ε and the ITAMs of CD3ζ. This interaction may underlie the ability of EB1-decorated MT plus-ends to bind TCR-bearing vesicles, promoting their movement in and out of the IS plane. Interestingly, the movement of the vesicles is erratic when EB1 expression is reduced, and corresponds to the localization of accumulated, peripheral clusters of TCR in fixed cell conjugates.

Our results reveal that signals from the TCR signalosome ( Guy and Vignali, 2009 ) cannot propagate to the LAT/PLCγ1 cassette when EB1-dependent tracking of MTs is disrupted, supporting the notion that a continuously remodelled microtubular network is essential for the trafficking of vesicles at the IS. Moreover, TCR and LAT vesicles appear to be different and must encounter each other to allow the specific propagation of activation signals. These effects are very rapid and can be observed readily after T cell activation, correlating with the described effect of HDAC6 on tubulin dynamics upon TCR engagement ( Serrador et al, 2004 ). The backward trafficking to intracellular compartments of vesicles docked at MT plus-tips is in accord with a recently proposed model ( Akhmanova and Hammer, 2010 ), in which dynein/dynactin molecular motors would drive movement toward the minus end of the MTs (the centrosome). In this regard, EB1 C terminus ends with an acidic stretch that has been described as the binding site for p150 Glued , a dynactin subunit ( Manna et al, 2008 ). Therefore, EB1 localized at MT plus-ends may help the interaction of TCR and thus CD3ζ-enriched vesicles with dynein/dynactin motors. A dynein/dynactin-driven movement would promote the movement of vesicles along MTs towards their minus-end, the centrosome, where the Golgi is organized. The multivesicular bodies found at the IS ( Calabia-Linares et al, 2011 ; Mittelbrunn et al, 2011 ) might also be the fate of the TCR-containing vesicles, on their way to recycling or degradation pathways. Early endosomal compartments may also be attained through MT-driven trafficking ( Nielsen et al, 1999 ).

The failure of MTOC translocation in dynein/dynactin-disrupted T cells of human origin ( Martin-Cofreces et al, 2008 ) would prevent the tubulin polymerization at the IS observed here, preventing correct movement of vesicles towards intracellular compartments. The predicted outcome would be accumulation of TCR at the periphery of the IS instead of forming a central cluster, as observed ( Martin-Cofreces et al, 2008 ). The tubulin cytoskeleton and related proteins therefore appear to be of critical importance for the formation of the IS and sustained T cell activation. In this regard, a recent report has identified casein kinase I δ (CKIδ) as an important molecule controlling MTOC translocation to the IS and MT growing. CKIδ can bind to EB1 and the region of CKIδ implicated in this interaction is required for MTOC translocation ( Zyss et al, 2011 ). Therefore, EB1 localization at the MTOC may be determined by CKIδ, and its plus-end tracking activity regulated by the kinase through phosphorylation to promote the MT growing observed herein. However, the absence of CKIδ does neither affect IS architecture nor signalling ( Zyss et al, 2011 ), which points to other complementary mechanisms to regulate EB1 function.

We found that vesicle movement is important for correct activation of signalling via LAT and PLCγ1. Phosphorylation of these proteins on key residues was decreased in EB1-silenced cells, even though the rate of phosphorylation of CD3ζ and ZAP70 was similar to control cells. LAT phosphorylation during T cell spreading and its correspondence with microclusters has been shown to be relevant during T cell activation ( Campi et al, 2005 ). Indeed, the relative movement of LAT microclusters with respect to LAT vesicles has also been shown to be important for correct T cell activation ( Purbhoo et al, 2010 ). Our results show that the coordinated movement and correct encounter between CD3ζ- and LAT-enriched vesicles is necessary for signal propagation from the TCR. This movement may help the relationship between the described protein islands for TCR and LAT ( Lillemeier et al, 2010 ). The specific contribution of MTOC translocation to the localization of vesicles at the IS and subsequent MT polymerization warrants further research.
