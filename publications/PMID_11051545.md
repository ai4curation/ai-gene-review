mRNA turnover mediated by the major protein-coding-region determinant of 
instability (mCRD) of the c-fos proto-oncogene transcript illustrates a 
functional interplay between mRNA turnover and translation. We show that the 
function of mCRD depends on its distance from the poly(A) tail. Five 
mCRD-associated proteins were identified: Unr, a purine-rich RNA binding 
protein; PABP, a poly(A) binding protein; PAIP-1, a poly(A) binding protein 
interacting protein; hnRNP D, an AU-rich element binding protein; and NSAP1, an 
hnRNP R-like protein. These proteins form a multiprotein complex. Overexpression 
of these proteins stabilized mCRD-containing mRNA by impeding deadenylation. We 
propose that a bridging complex forms between the poly(A) tail and the mCRD and 
ribosome transit disrupts or reorganizes the complex, leading to rapid RNA 
deadenylation and decay.
