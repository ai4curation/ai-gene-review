Calmodulin (CaM) binding to the type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) regulates Ca 
release from the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). However, the structural 
basis of CaM regulation of the RyR2 is poorly defined, and the presence of other 
potential CaM binding partners in cardiac myocytes complicates resolution of 
CaM's regulatory interactions with RyR2. Here, we show that a 
fluorescence-resonance-energy-transfer (FRET)-based approach can effectively 
resolve RyR2 CaM binding, both in isolated SR membrane vesicles and in 
permeabilized ventricular myocytes. A small FRET donor was targeted to the RyR2 
cytoplasmic assembly via fluorescent labeling of the FKBP12.6 subunit. Acceptor 
fluorophore was attached at discrete positions within either the N- or the 
C-lobe of CaM. FRET between FKBP12.6 and CaM bound to SR vesicles indicated CaM 
binding at a single high-affinity site within 60 Å of FKBP12.6. Micromolar Ca 
increased the apparent affinity of CaM binding and slowed CaM dissociation, but 
did not significantly affect maximal FRET efficiency at saturating CaM. FRET was 
strongest when the acceptor was attached at either of two positions within CaM's 
N-lobe versus sites in CaM's C-lobe, providing CaM orientation information. In 
permeabilized ventricular myocytes, FKBP12.6 and CaM colocalized to Z-lines, and 
the efficiency of energy transfer to both the N- and C-lobes of CaM was 
comparable to that observed in SR vesicle experiments. Results also indicate 
that both the location and orientation of CaM binding on the RyR2 are very 
similar to the skeletal muscle RyR1 isoform. Specific binding of CaM to 
functional RyR2 channels in the cardiac myocyte environment can be monitored 
using FKBP biosensors and FRET.

Calmodulin (CaM) binding to the type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) regulates Ca release from the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). However, the structural basis of CaM regulation of the RyR2 is poorly defined, and the presence of other potential CaM binding partners in cardiac myocytes complicates resolution of CaM's regulatory interactions with RyR2. Here, we show that a fluorescence-resonance-energy-transfer (FRET)-based approach can effectively resolve RyR2 CaM binding, both in isolated SR membrane vesicles and in permeabilized ventricular myocytes. A small FRET donor was targeted to the RyR2 cytoplasmic assembly via fluorescent labeling of the FKBP12.6 subunit. Acceptor fluorophore was attached at discrete positions within either the N- or the C-lobe of CaM. FRET between FKBP12.6 and CaM bound to SR vesicles indicated CaM binding at a single high-affinity site within 60 Å of FKBP12.6. Micromolar Ca increased the apparent affinity of CaM binding and slowed CaM dissociation, but did not significantly affect maximal FRET efficiency at saturating CaM. FRET was strongest when the acceptor was attached at either of two positions within CaM's N-lobe versus sites in CaM's C-lobe, providing CaM orientation information.

Results also indicate that both the location and orientation of CaM binding on the RyR2 are very similar to the skeletal muscle RyR1 isoform. Specific binding of CaM to functional RyR2 channels in the cardiac myocyte environment can be monitored using FKBP biosensors and FRET.

Introduction

Calmodulin (CaM) is a versatile intracellular Ca sensor, capable of modulating the activity of diverse binding partners. CaM is comprised of roughly symmetrical N- and C-lobes that are joined by a flexible hinge ( 1,2 ). Ca binding at EF hand motifs within CaM's N- and C-lobes evokes conformational changes within CaM that expose hydrophobic residues and transduce intracellular Ca signals ( 3 ). Among CaM's many binding partners are various ion channels ( 4 ), including the large intracellular Ca release channels known as ryanodine receptors (RyRs), which are central to excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac and skeletal muscle ( 5–7 ).

CaM binding to the cardiac RyR2 channel isoform causes a rightward shift in the steady-state [Ca]-dependence of RyR2 activation in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles ( 8 ), a decrease in the frequency and duration of channel opening events in lipid bilayers ( 9 ), and a decrease in the frequency of Ca sparks in permeabilized myocytes ( 10 ). Meissner and co-workers have demonstrated that the specific disruption of RyR2 CaM binding by targeted substitutions within a core CaM binding sequence results in severe cardiac hypertrophy and early death in mutant mice ( 11 ). CaM regulation of RyR2 is therefore crucial for normal cardiac function and development. However, efforts to resolve CaM's functional interactions with the RyR2 specifically have been confounded by the many other potential CaM binding partners that are also present in the cardiac myocyte, including calcineurin, CaM-dependent protein kinase II, and L-type Ca channels ( 12–14 ). In addition, the structural basis of RyR2 regulation by CaM remains poorly defined, as 3D mapping of CaM binding by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has thus far been limited to the skeletal muscle RyR1 isoform ( 7 ). RyR1 and RyR2 exhibit important isoform differences in CaM regulation, including differences in the functional effect of CaM binding at submicromolar Ca ( 8 ), the molecular determinants of binding ( 15 ), and the thermodynamics of binding ( 16 ). Whether these isoform differences reflect major differences in the location or orientation of CaM binding to the different channel isoforms is not yet clear, and this study aims to help clarify these issues.

In the case of the RyR1 isoform, 3D cryo-EM indicates that CaM binds adjacently to the cleft that separates the handle and clamp regions of the cytoplasmic assembly ( 17,18 ). This places CaM near the base of a major structural hinge involved in the translation of large-scale motions of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane assemblies ( 19 ). The location of CaM binding predicted by cryo-EM was supported by FRET mapping of CaM bound to the RyR1 isoform ( 20 ). These FRET studies further demonstrated that CaM binds to RyR1 in an extended conformation, oriented with its N-lobe nearer to, and its C-lobe farther from, a donor-labeled FKBP subunit. Given the functional difference in effects of CaM on RyR2 versus RyR1 gating ( 8 ), it is possible that the relative positions of FKBP and CaM could differ among RyR isoforms.

Here, we use FRET to characterize CaM binding to the RyR2 channel isoform. We examine whether our approach based on site-directed fluorescent labeling of CaM and FKBP12.6 can effectively resolve CaM's interactions with the RyR2, both in SR vesicle preparations and in the more physiological environment of permeabilized ventricular myocytes. We also examine whether CaM's location and orientation when bound to the RyR2 are similar to what has been demonstrated previously for the RyR1 macromolecular complex.

Discussion

We show for the first time, to our knowledge, that the specific binding of CaM to cardiac RyR2 channels can be monitored using an F-FKBP biosensor and FRET. We show that this approach reports on RyR2 CaM binding not only in isolated SR vesicles but also in saponin-permeabilized ventricular myocytes. Because our donor-acceptor pair can only detect distances of <100 Å, our FRET approach effectively resolves CaM's interactions with RyR2 channels from its interactions with numerous other CaM binding partners that are also present in cardiac myocytes and SR vesicles.

The likelihood that our FRET signal reflects donor and acceptor binding at RyR2 channels is supported by multiple findings. We find that FRET in cardiac SR vesicles ( Fig. 3 A ) and in permeabilized myocytes ( Fig. 6 ) is essentially abolished by suramin, which acts as a competitive inhibitor of RyR CaM binding, and discriminates among different CaM targets ( 27,28 ). We also find that our FRET signals are remarkably similar in magnitude across different preparations, in which the complement of non-RyR binding partners is likely to differ greatly. Thus, we show that FRET between FKBP12.6 and CaM is similar in experiments using sucrose-gradient-fractionated skeletal muscle SR vesicles ( Fig. 4 A ), cardiac SR vesicles ( Fig. 4 B ), and saponin-permeabilized ventricular myocytes ( Fig. 7 B ). Steady-state binding isotherms ( Fig. 2 ) and CaM dissociation kinetics ( Fig. 1 D ) derived from FRET measurements are well fit using models that assume a single population of CaM binding sites. Furthermore, distances calculated from E max determinations are consistent with the proximity of the FKBP12 and CaM subunits on the same face of the channel tetramer in RyR1 cryo-EM structural models ( 18 ), whereas FKBP12 and CaM on different faces of RyR1, or on different channels within an array, are too widely separated for FRET ( 20,21 ). Corresponding high-resolution structures showing the positions of FKBP12.6 and CaM on the RyR2 isoform are not yet available. However, 3D structures of RyR1 and RyR2 are very similar overall ( 7 ), as are our measurements of FRET efficiency using the different isoforms ( Fig. 4 ). Thus, although we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that the binding of F-CaMs and/or F-FKBPs at other targets may contribute to a very small fraction of our FRET signal, we attribute the vast majority (>95%) of this signal to FRET between donors and acceptors bound in close proximity on the same face of RyR2 channels.

These findings also demonstrate that CaM binds RyR2 in approximately the same position and in the same orientation as shown previously for RyR1. FRET was markedly stronger when the acceptor was attached at either of two positions within CaM's N-lobe versus positions in CaM's C-lobe, indicating that for both RyR isoforms CaM binds in an extended conformation, with its lobes widely separated. We conclude that the important differences in CaM function on RyR2 versus RyR1 are not linked to gross structural differences in the location of CaM binding on the 3D structure of RyR, particularly with respect to the FKBP location. Micromolar Ca increased the apparent affinity of RyR2 CaM binding, but did not significantly affect the maximal FRET efficiency at saturating CaM ( Fig. 2 ). Thus, we find no evidence for the large-scale Ca-dependent translocation of CaM that has been demonstrated in RyR1 cryo-EM studies ( 18 ).

An intriguing observation arising from this study is that the apparent K d for F-CaM binding to the RyR2 in SR vesicle experiments at physiological diastolic [Ca] of 100 nM (93 nM) is threefold higher than the value of 31 nM that we have measured in permeabilized myocytes at 50 nM [Ca] using methods similar to those used here ( 25 ). It is not clear what this moderate threefold difference is attributable to, but factors could include species differences, small differences in the solutions, differential loss of partners present in the intact cellular environment, or subtle differences in structure or modulation (e.g., oxidation, nitrosylation, or phosphorylation). In preliminary experiments, we were unable to identify a clear explanation.

CaM's regulatory interactions with RyR2 channels are critical for normal cardiac function and development, and altered CaM binding may contribute to defects in SR Ca handling in arrhythmias and heart failure. CaM is thought to function as a resident regulatory subunit ( 5 ), and results in this study ( Fig. 1 ) confirm that CaM binding and unbinding are too slow for us to expect beat-to-beat changes in the occupancy of RyR2 CaM sites. Indeed, at diastolic [Ca] of ∼100 nM and free [CaM] of 60–100 nM, the RyR2 would be at least 50–70% saturated with CaM, and that would be a lower limit compared to the steady state during normal cardiac function and Ca transients.

If physiological RyR2 saturation with CaM is incomplete, the inhibitory effect of CaM on RyR2 gating would mean that either gain or loss of CaM on the RyR could have regulatory effects on RyR2 gating. For example, in a rabbit heart-failure model, Ai et al. ( 30 ) found less CaM coimmunoprecipitation with RyR2, despite unaltered expression levels. This reduced CaM bound to RyR2 could thus contribute to enhanced SR Ca leak in heart failure that can also be arrhythmogenic, similar to the pathophysiologic effects seen when knocking in an RyR2 that is defective in CaM binding ( 11 ). Moreover, this CaM-depleted RyR2 phenotype resembles that seen with numerous human RyR2 mutations associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia ( 31 ). Our ability to monitor CaM binding specifically to RyR2 in myocytes using this FRET approach could be utilized to monitor conditions that cause CaM (or FKBP) dissociation from the RyR2 in more physiological and pathophysiological conditions (e.g., RyR2 oxidation/nitrosylation, phosphorylation, S100A1 binding).
