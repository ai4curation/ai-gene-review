Since 2003, highly pathogenic A(H5N1) influenza viruses have been the cause of 
large-scale death in poultry and the subsequent infection and death of over 140 
humans. A group of 55 influenza A(H5N1) viruses isolated from various regions of 
South East Asia between 2004 and 2006 were tested for their susceptibility to 
the anti-influenza drugs the neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes. The 
majority of strains were found to be fully sensitive to the neuraminidase 
inhibitors oseltamivir carboxylate, zanamivir and peramivir; however two strains 
demonstrated increased IC50 values. Sequence analysis of these strains revealed 
mutations in the normally highly conserved residues 116 and 117 of the N1 
neuraminidase. Sequence analysis of the M2 gene showed that all of the A(H5N1) 
viruses from Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia contained mutations (L26I and S31N) 
associated with resistance to the adamantane drugs (rimantadine and amantadine), 
while strains from Indonesia were found to be a mix of both adamantane resistant 
(S31N) and sensitive viruses. None of the A(H5N1) viruses from Myanmar contained 
mutations known to confer adamantane resistance. These results support the use 
of neuraminidase inhibitors as the most appropriate class of antiviral drug to 
prevent or treat human A(H5N1) virus infections.
