DYT1 dystonia is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation that leads to a 
glutamic acid deletion in torsinA (TA), a member of the AAA+ ATPase superfamily. 
In this study, we identified a novel-binding partner of TA, the subunit 4 (CSN4) 
of CSN signalosome. TA binds CSN4 and the synaptic regulator snapin in 
neuroblastoma cells and in brain synaptosomes. CSN4 and TA are required for the 
stability of both snapin and the synaptotagmin-specific endocytic adaptor stonin 
2, as downregulation of CSN4 or TA reduces the levels of both proteins. Snapin 
is phosphorylated by the CSN-associated kinase protein kinase D (PKD) and its 
expression is decreased upon PKD inhibition. In contrast, the stability of 
stonin 2 is regulated by neddylation, another CSN-associated activity. 
Overexpression of the pathological TA mutant (ΔE-TA) reduces stonin 2 
expression, causing the accumulation of the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 1 on 
the cell surface. Retrieval of surface-stranded synaptotagmin 1 is restored by 
overexpression of stonin 2 in ΔE-TA-expressing cells, suggesting that the DYT1 
mutation compromises the role of TA in protein stabilisation and synaptic 
vesicle recycling.
