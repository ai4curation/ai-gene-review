Transition metal homeostasis ensures that cells and organisms obtain sufficient 
metal to meet cellular demand while dispensing with any excess so as to avoid 
toxicity. In bacteria, zinc restriction induces the expression of one or more 
Zur (zinc-uptake repressor)-regulated Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) 
COG0523 proteins. COG0523 proteins encompass a poorly understood sub-family of 
G3E P-loop small GTPases, others of which are known to function as 
metallochaperones in the maturation of cobalamin (CoII) and NiII 
cofactor-containing metalloenzymes. Here, we use genomic enzymology tools to 
functionally analyse over 80 000 sequences that are evolutionarily related to 
Acinetobacter baumannii ZigA (Zur-inducible GTPase), a COG0523 protein and 
candidate zinc metallochaperone. These sequences segregate into distinct 
sequence similarity network (SSN) clusters, exemplified by the 
ZnII-Zur-regulated and FeIII-nitrile hydratase activator CxCC (C, Cys; X, any 
amino acid)-containing COG0523 proteins (SSN cluster 1), NiII-UreG (clusters 2, 
8), CoII-CobW (cluster 4), and NiII-HypB (cluster 5). A total of five large 
clusters that comprise ≈ 25% of all sequences, including cluster 3 which harbors 
the only structurally characterized COG0523 protein, Escherichia coli YjiA, and 
many uncharacterized eukaryotic COG0523 proteins. We also establish that 
mycobacterial-specific protein Y (Mpy) recruitment factor (Mrf), which promotes 
ribosome hibernation in actinomycetes under conditions of ZnII starvation, 
segregates into a fifth SSN cluster (cluster 17). Mrf is a COG0523 paralog that 
lacks all GTP-binding determinants as well as the ZnII-coordinating Cys found in 
CxCC-containing COG0523 proteins. On the basis of this analysis, we discuss new 
perspectives on the COG0523 proteins as cellular reporters of widespread 
nutrient stress induced by ZnII limitation.

Abstract

Transition metal homeostasis ensures that cells and organisms obtain sufficient metal to meet cellular demand while dispensing with any excess so as to avoid toxicity. In bacteria, zinc restriction induces the expression of one or more Zur (zinc-uptake repressor)-regulated Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) COG0523 proteins. COG0523 proteins encompass a poorly understood sub-family of G3E P-loop small GTPases, others of which are known to function as metallochaperones in the maturation of cobalamin (Co II ) and Ni II cofactor-containing metalloenzymes. Here, we use genomic enzymology tools to functionally analyse over 80 000 sequences that are evolutionarily related to Acinetobacter baumannii ZigA (Zur-inducible GTPase), a COG0523 protein and candidate zinc metallochaperone. These sequences segregate into distinct sequence similarity network (SSN) clusters, exemplified by the Zn II -Zur-regulated and Fe III -nitrile hydratase activator CxCC (C, Cys; X, any amino acid)-containing COG0523 proteins (SSN cluster 1), Ni II -UreG (clusters 2, 8), Co II -CobW (cluster 4), and Ni II -HypB (cluster 5). A total of five large clusters that comprise ≈ 25% of all sequences, including cluster 3 which harbors the only structurally characterized COG0523 protein, Escherichia coli YjiA, and many uncharacterized eukaryotic COG0523 proteins. We also establish that mycobacterial-specific protein Y (Mpy) recruitment factor (Mrf), which promotes ribosome hibernation in actinomycetes under conditions of Zn II starvation, segregates into a fifth SSN cluster (cluster 17). Mrf is a COG0523 paralog that lacks all GTP-binding determinants as well as the Zn II -coordinating Cys found in CxCC-containing COG0523 proteins. On the basis of this analysis, we discuss new perspectives on the COG0523 proteins as cellular reporters of widespread nutrient stress induced by Zn II limitation.

Introduction

Late 3d -block, first-row metals from manganese (Mn) to zinc (Zn) play myriad and often highly specialized catalytic, structural, and regulatory roles in cellular physiology. Whether living in the soil or colonizing an infected host, all bacterial cells must acquire sufficient transition metal from the surrounding milieu to meet significant cellular demands, while avoiding toxicity associated with too much metal. 1 More than 30% of all proteins encoded by a typical bacterial genome require transition metals to function. 2 Bacterial transcriptional regulators ensure the bioavailable concentrations of transition metals to meet cellular metal needs, defined as sufficient metal to fill all metal binding sites of the metalloproteome. 3 This allows, for example, a Zn II enzyme to access only the bioavailable pool of Zn II and not other noncognate metals. Some metalloenzymes, however, cannot assemble an active site spontaneously within the cellular milieu and require one or more accessory proteins to build the metallocenter. While the necessity for accessory proteins in the biogenesis of complex metallocenters like, for example the organometallic Ni II -pincer nucleotide cofactor in Lactobacillus plantarum lactate racemase 4 is easy to understand, it is not as clear for other enzymes, including urease which simply incorporates a binuclear Ni II active center bridged by a carbamylated Lys residue. 5 Nonetheless, both enzymes require accessory proteins for metallocofactor assembly and often require the activity of one or more dedicated metallochaperones. 6

A metallochaperone is defined as a metal-binding protein that acquires a specific metal within the context of the cellular milieu, physically interacts with an unmetallated client or intermediary protein, and transfers the metal to the acceptor protein. The concept of a metallochaperone originated in the copper (Cu) homeostasis and resistance fields. 7–9 Cu chaperones are generally small single domain proteins that bind Cu I with high affinity, transiently dock with apo or metal-free client protein, and, via metal–ligand exchange and without dissociation into bulk solvent, transfer the metal to an acceptor protein down a shallow thermodynamic gradient, regenerating the apo-chaperone and a metalated client (Fig. 1A ). 10 , 11 In the case of bacterial Cu resistance, the chaperone and the client adopt isostructural folds of opposite electrostatic potential and form a specific, yet transient protein-protein complex; the ‘client’ is an appended domain of a Cu I efflux pump, which removes the Cu I from the cytoplasm. 10 , 12 A physiologically distinct, yet mechanistically analogous model of chaperone-dependent enzyme metalation underpins the maturation of superoxide dismutase in eukaryotic cells, which is required only under conditions of intracellular Cu limitation. 13 Here, a metallochaperone can be expected to traffic a specific metal to an acceptor as a result of highly specific coordination chemistry and protein–protein interactions but becomes dispensable under conditions where the cognate metal is replete in the cell. 13

One important group of metallochaperones is the P-loop G3E GTPase family, which is named for a D-to-E substitution relative to a canonical P-loop GTPase, e.g. human Ras and is thus denoted G3E. 14 Rather than relying solely on metal–ligand exchange like Cu I chaperones, the G3E family is thought to utilize GTP hydrolysis to thermodynamically drive and/or regulate metallocofactor assembly (Fig. 1B ). These are known to include subfamilies for the Ni II chaperone HypB, which functions in the pathway of NiFe-hydrogenase cofactor assembly, 15–17 UreG, the Ni II chaperone required for the assembly of the binuclear Ni II site in urease, 18 , 19 and MeaB (CblA 20 ), the cobalamin (vitamin B 12 ) chaperone for methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase (Fig. 2 ). 21 , 22 Although all are metallochaperones, the MeaB subfamily is not considered further here because it functions to gate Co III -corrinoid cofactor, 5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, to an apoprotein client, rather than inserting the free metal itself. 21 G3E GTPases have five signature G (GTP-binding) loops required for GTP binding and hydrolysis. G1 consists of the Walker A GxG KT T motif or P-loop that binds the β-phosphate group of GTP. 15 , 23 G2 comprises Switch 1, which interacts with the γ-phosphate and is responsible for molecular switching upon GTP hydrolysis. The G3 or Walker B (Switch 2) loop harbors the D-to-E substitution that coordinates the Mg II in the Mg II -GTP substrate, while G4 and G5 are guanine binding motifs that dictate GTP specificity (Fig. 3A ). Mechanistically, UreG and HypB operate through nucleotide- or metal-inducible oligomers, interactions with various accessory proteins, and a subunit-bridging metal binding site, to fulfill GTP hydrolysis-dependent metallochaperone function. 24–27 The Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) COG0523 subfamily, defined by the conserved CxCC (C, Cys; x, any amino acid) primary structure motif responsible for high affinity metal binding, 28 , 29 comprises the last known subfamily of the G3E P-loop superfamily, and is far less understood.

Conclusions

In this perspective, we provide a comprehensive comparative phylogenetic, biochemical, structural, and functional analysis of the two-domain COG0523 proteins placed in the context of our increasingly sophisticated understanding of the G3E P-loop family metallochaperones and more broadly, cellular nutrient restriction. We show that much of the phylogenetic and structural diversity of COG0523 proteins localizes to the C-terminal domain, which makes the prediction that this domain is responsible for mediating a specific protein-protein interaction that is necessary for intermolecular, directional metal transfer to one or a small number of closely related client proteins. 108 More structures of closely related as well as more distantly related COG0523 proteins are needed to obtain a sense of this structural diversity, while the identification of client proteins with which individual COG0523 proteins interact is an important goal. Comparative structural, dynamical and mechanistic characterization of these complexes will elucidate those features that are common to COG0523 enzymes.

A striking finding from this work is an evolutionary link between COG0523 proteins and one class of actinomycete ribosome hibernation promotion factors (Mrf; SSN cluster 17), 76 which suggests the intriguing possibility that some COG053 enzymes function co-translationally under conditions of metal nutrient restriction. Productive lines of investigation for future experiments are to systematically investigate whether cluster 1 COG0523 proteins reversibly associate with the ribosome under conditions of extreme Zn II limitation, and/or the extent to which ZagA might catalyze subunit exchange in a FolE oligomer in a ZTP/GTP-hydrolysis dependent manner. Quantification of the number of the cluster 1 COG0523 molecules per cell relative to the number of ribosomes will provide new insights into COG0523 function, while chemical cross-linking approaches promise to identify protein–protein interaction partners for individual members of this enigmatic family of P-loop G3E GTPases. Given the dramatic structural diversity of COG0523 proteins described here, it may well be that these three mechanistic models are not mutually exclusive, and that individual members may function differently, as implied by the large numbers of COG0523 proteins encoded in single genomes, particularly by marine phytoplankton. 79 Likewise, the infected host represents a strongly zinc-restricted microenvironment where the high affinity Zn II uptake system of many bacterial pathogens is a documented virulence factor, 109 novel Zur-regulated targets in general, 110 , 111 and COG0523 proteins and their metalloenzyme clients specifically, represent highly expressed targets for the development of new antimicrobial strategies to combat multi-drug resistance in bacterial pathogens. 38
