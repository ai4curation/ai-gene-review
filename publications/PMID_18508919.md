Molecular chaperones prevent aggregation of denatured proteins in vitro and are 
thought to support folding of diverse proteins in vivo. Chaperones may have some 
selectivity for their substrate proteins, but knowledge of particular in vivo 
substrates is still poor. We here show that yeast Rot1, an essential, type-I ER 
membrane protein functions as a chaperone. Recombinant Rot1 exhibited 
antiaggregation activity in vitro, which was partly impaired by a 
temperature-sensitive rot1-2 mutation. In vivo, the rot1-2 mutation caused 
accelerated degradation of five proteins in the secretory pathway via 
ER-associated degradation, resulting in a decrease in their cellular levels. 
Furthermore, we demonstrate a physical and probably transient interaction of 
Rot1 with four of these proteins. Collectively, these results indicate that Rot1 
functions as a chaperone in vivo supporting the folding of those proteins. Their 
folding also requires BiP, and one of these proteins was simultaneously 
associated with both Rot1 and BiP, suggesting that they can cooperate to 
facilitate protein folding. The Rot1-dependent proteins include a soluble, type 
I and II, and polytopic membrane proteins, and they do not share structural 
similarities. In addition, their dependency on Rot1 appeared different. We 
therefore propose that Rot1 is a general chaperone with some substrate 
specificity.
