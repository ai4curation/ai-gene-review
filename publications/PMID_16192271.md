CNS neurons are endowed with the ability to recover from cytotoxic insults 
associated with the accumulation of proteinaceous polyglutamine aggregates via a 
process that appears to involve capture and degradation of aggregates by 
autophagy. The ubiquitin-proteasome system protects cells against proteotoxicity 
by degrading soluble monomeric misfolded aggregation-prone proteins but is 
ineffective against, and impaired by, non-native protein oligomers. Here we show 
that autophagy is induced in response to impaired ubiquitin proteasome system 
activity. We show that ATG proteins, molecular determinants of autophagic 
vacuole formation, and lysosomes are recruited to pericentriolar cytoplasmic 
inclusion bodies by a process requiring an intact microtubule cytoskeleton and 
the cytoplasmic deacetylase HDAC6. These data suggest that HDAC6-dependent 
retrograde transport on microtubules is used by cells to increase the efficiency 
and selectivity of autophagic degradation.
