Degradation of certain inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) appears to be 
critical in the initiation of apoptosis, but the factors that regulate their 
degradation in mammalian cells are unknown. Nrdp1/FLRF is a RING 
finger-containing ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes degradation of the EGF 
receptor family member, ErbB3. We show here that Nrdp1 associates with 
BRUCE/apollon, a 530 kDa membrane-associated IAP, which contains a 
ubiquitin-carrier protein (E2) domain. In the presence of an exogenous E2, 
UbcH5c, purified Nrdp1 catalyzes BRUCE ubiquitination. In vivo, overexpression 
of Nrdp1 promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of BRUCE. In many 
cell types, apoptotic stimuli induce proteasomal degradation of BRUCE (but not 
of XIAP or c-IAP1), and decreasing Nrdp1 levels by RNA interference reduces this 
loss of BRUCE. Furthermore, decreasing BRUCE content by RNA interference or 
overexpression of Nrdp1 promotes apoptosis. Thus, BRUCE normally inhibits 
apoptosis, and Nrdp1 can be important in the initiation of apoptosis by 
catalyzing ubiquitination and degradation of BRUCE.
