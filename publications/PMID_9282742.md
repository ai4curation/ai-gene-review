The localization of FtsN in Escherichia coli was inves tigated by 
immunofluorescence microscopy. FtsN is an essential cell division protein with a 
simple bitopic topology, a short N-terminal cytoplasmic segment fused to a large 
carboxy periplasmic domain through a single transmembrane domain. FtsN was found 
to localize to the septum in a ring pattern similar to that observed for FtsZ 
and FtsA, although the frequency of cells with rings was less. A MalG-FtsN 
fusion was also localized to the septum, indicating that the information for 
FtsN localization is supplied by its periplasmic domain. FtsN localization was 
dependent upon the prior localization of FtsZ and FtsA and required the function 
of FtsI and FtsQ. Consistent with FtsN functioning after FtsZ, Z rings were 
observed in a mutant depleted of FtsN.
