We analyzed the targeting of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes by 
DNA-binding activators during transcriptional activation and the resulting 
distribution of acetylated histones. An in vitro competition assay was developed 
to acetylate and transcribe a nucleosomal array template in the presence of 
excess non-specific chromatin, which mimics in vivo conditions. Stimulation of 
transcription from the nucleosomal array template under competitive conditions 
by the SAGA and NuA4 HAT complexes depended on the presence of the Gal4-VP16 
activator, which recognizes sites in the promoter and directly interacts with 
these HATs. Importantly, the stimulation of transcription by SAGA and NuA4 
depended on the presence of Gal4-VP16 during histone acetylation, and 
Gal4-VP16-bound nucleosomal templates were acetylated preferentially by SAGA and 
NuA4 relative to the competitor chromatin. While targeting of the SAGA complex 
led to H3 acetylation of promoter-proximal nucleosomes, targeting of the NuA4 
complex led to a broader domain of H4 acetylation of >3 kbp. Thus, either 
promoter-proximal H3 acetylation by SAGA or broadly distributed acetylation of 
H4 by NuA4 activated transcription from chromatin templates.
