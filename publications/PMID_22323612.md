Topoisomerase II resolves intrinsic topological problems of double-stranded DNA. 
As part of its essential cellular functions, the enzyme generates DNA breaks, 
but the regulation of this potentially dangerous process is not well understood. 
Here we report single-molecule fluorescence experiments that reveal a previously 
uncharacterized sequence of events during DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II: 
nonspecific DNA binding, sequence-specific DNA bending, and stochastic cleavage 
of DNA. We have identified unexpected structural roles of Mg(2+) ions 
coordinated in the TOPRIM (topoisomerase-primase) domain in inducing 
cleavage-competent DNA bending. A break at one scissile bond dramatically 
stabilized DNA bending, explaining how two scission events in opposing strands 
can be coordinated to achieve a high probability of double-stranded cleavage. 
Clamping of the protein N-gate greatly enhanced the rate and degree of DNA 
bending, resulting in a significant stimulation of the DNA cleavage and opening 
reactions. Our data strongly suggest that the accurate cleavage of DNA by 
topoisomerase II is regulated through a tight coordination with DNA bending.

Abstract

Topoisomerase II resolves intrinsic topological problems of double-stranded DNA. As part of its essential cellular functions, the enzyme generates DNA breaks, but the regulation of this potentially dangerous process is not well understood. Here we report single-molecule fluorescence experiments that reveal a previously uncharacterized sequence of events during DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II: nonspecific DNA binding, sequence-specific DNA bending, and stochastic cleavage of DNA. We have identified unexpected structural roles of Mg 2+ ions coordinated in the TOPRIM (topoisomerase-primase) domain in inducing cleavage-competent DNA bending. A break at one scissile bond dramatically stabilized DNA bending, explaining how two scission events in opposing strands can be coordinated to achieve a high probability of double-stranded cleavage. Clamping of the protein N -gate greatly enhanced the rate and degree of DNA bending, resulting in a significant stimulation of the DNA cleavage and opening reactions. Our data strongly suggest that the accurate cleavage of DNA by topoisomerase II is regulated through a tight coordination with DNA bending.

Discussion

The transient nature of key steps of the catalytic cycle of type II topoisomerases has hindered a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanisms of these enzymes. Therefore, we developed single-molecule fluorescence methods that were capable of visualizing the individual steps of the topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage reaction. These methods allowed us to dissect the operational and regulatory mechanisms of the DNA cleavage reaction, which is summarized in SI Appendix , Fig. S20 and below.

It has long been known that type II topoisomerases cleave DNA in a sequence-dependent manner ( 3 , 5 , 24 ), but the mechanistic basis for G -segment selection was not apparent. We found that the cleavage reaction of type II topoisomerases proceeds through three ordered steps: DNA binding, bending, and cleavage. DNA bending was observed only in specific sequences that could be cleaved by the enzyme, while binding was not ( Fig. 2 A – C ). This finding suggests that the G -segment is selected by topoisomerase II via an “indirect readout” mechanism—by the physical properties, or deformability, of a DNA sequence, as opposed to the chemical information stored in the DNA sequence ( 46 , 47 ). Consistent with this conclusion, recent high-resolution crystal structures indicated few direct interactions between DNA bases and eukaryotic topoisomerase II ( 27 , 30 ).

The use of divalent metal cations by type II topoisomerases for their ATPase, cleavage, and ligation activities has been known for decades ( 3 , 5 , 32 , 48 ). Our observations revealed an unexpected role of divalent metal ions in the operation of type II topoisomerases. DNA bending by hTopoIIα required the active site divalent cations, and this metal ion-dependent global conformational change was an intermediate reaction step en route to DNA cleavage. Furthermore, we showed that the highly conserved acidic residues in the TOPRIM domain are critical for the proper bending of gate-DNA.

Topoisomerase II coordinates cleavage of the two scissile bonds of the gate-DNA, but the mechanism underlying this coordination was not clear ( 25 , 26 ). We observed that a single-stranded break increased the bending state lifetime dramatically, suggesting a unique biophysical mechanism by which the two independent cleavage events in the cleavage site are coordinated: cleavage of the first strand increases the flexibility of DNA, and as a result enhances the probability of the second strand cleavage by maintaining the DNA substrate in a cleavage-competent bent conformation ( 26 ).

There have been intriguing questions about the coupling mechanism of DNA cleavage and N -gate clamping. We found that the rate and degree of gate-DNA bending are greatly enhanced in the presence of AMPPNP, resulting in stimulated cleavage and opening of gate-DNA. Therefore, the cleavage and opening reactions of gate-DNA are well coordinated with the N -gate clamping motion of the enzyme through modulation of DNA bending. Through this tight control of DNA cleavage/opening processes, the probability of an accidental double-stranded breaks can be minimized, resulting in a protection of the genome from cytotoxic lesions caused by a misoperation of type II topoisomerases.

Materials and Methods

Detailed information on single-molecule measurements and determination of kinetic rates are available in SI Appendix , Materials and Methods .

Wild-type and mutant human topoisomerase IIα proteins were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae JEL1Δtop1 cells and purified as described previously ( 49 , 50 ). HPLC-purified DNA strands were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies except the phosphorothiolate modified DNA strand, which was purchased from Purimex. DNA oligonucleotides ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 ) were labeled at the amine group of an internal amino modifier (dTC6) with either Cy3 or Cy5 ( 51 ). DNA duplexes were annealed by slowly cooling the mixture of the biotinylated strand and nonbiotinylated strand in 2∶3 molar ratio at 10 μM concentration in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 50 mM NaCl.
