Phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinases control essential cellular functions such as 
cytoskeletal dynamics, signal transduction and membrane trafficking. FYVE, PX 
and PH domains mediate the binding of effector proteins to the lipid products of 
PI 3-kinases. Recent studies have provided significant insights into the roles 
of PI 3-kinases, their catalytic products and their downstream effectors in 
membrane trafficking. Class I and II PI 3-kinases trigger receptor-induced 
trafficking processes, such as phagocytosis, macropinocytosis and regulated 
exocytosis. Class I PI 3-kinases also function to inhibit autophagy. By 
contrast, class III PI 3-kinases mainly mediate receptor-independent trafficking 
events, which mostly are related to endocytic membrane traffic, phagosome 
maturation and autophagy.
