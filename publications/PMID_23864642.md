A straightforward method is presented to estimate peak skin doses (PSDs) 
delivered by computed tomography (CT) scanners. The measured PSD values are 
related to the well-known volume CT dose index (CTDI(vol)), displayed on the 
console of CT scanners. PSD measurement estimates were obtained, in four CT 
units, by placing radiochromic film on the surface of a CTDI head phantom. Six 
different X-ray tube currents including the maximum allowed value were used to 
irradiate the phantom. PSD and CTDI(vol) were independently measured and later 
related to the CTDI(vol) value displayed on the console. A scanner-specific 
relationship was found between the measured PSD and the associated CTDI(vol) 
displayed on the console. The measured PSD values varied between 27 and 136 mGy 
among all scanners when the routine head scan parameters were used. The results 
of this work allow relating the widely used CTDI(vol) to an actual radiation 
dose delivered to the skin of a patient.
