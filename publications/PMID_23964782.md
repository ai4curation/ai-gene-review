Starmerella (Candida) bombicola is the biosurfactant-producing species that 
caught the greatest deal of attention in the academic and industrial world due 
to its ability of producing large amounts of sophorolipids. Despite its high 
economic potential, the biochemistry behind the sophorolipid biosynthesis is 
still poorly understood. Here we present the first proteomic characterization of 
S. bombicola for which we created a lys1Δ mutant to allow the use of SILAC for 
quantitative analysis. To characterize the processes behind the production of 
these biosurfactants, we compared the proteome of sophorolipid producing (early 
stationary phase) and nonproducing cells (exponential phase). We report the 
simultaneous production of all known enzymes involved in sophorolipid 
biosynthesis including a predicted sophorolipid transporter. In addition, we 
identified the heme binding protein Dap1 as a possible regulator for Cyp52M1. 
Our results further indicate that ammonium and phosphate limitation are not the 
sole limiting factors inducing sophorolipid biosynthesis.
