Pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced activation of nuclear factor, NF-κB has an

Abstract

Pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced activation of nuclear factor, NF- κ B has an important role in leukocyte adhesion to, and subsequent migration across, brain endothelial cells (BECs), which is crucial for the development of neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). In contrast, microRNA-146a (miR-146a) has emerged as an anti-inflammatory molecule by inhibiting NF- κ B activity in various cell types, but its effect in BECs during neuroinflammation remains to be evaluated. Here, we show that miR-146a was upregulated in microvessels of MS-active lesions and the spinal cord of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In vitro , TNF α and IFN γ treatment of human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) led to upregulation of miR-146a. Brain endothelial overexpression of miR-146a diminished, whereas knockdown of miR-146a augmented cytokine-stimulated adhesion of T cells to hCMEC/D3 cells, nuclear translocation of NF- κ B, and expression of adhesion molecules in hCMEC/D3 cells. Furthermore, brain endothelial miR-146a modulates NF- κ B activity upon cytokine activation through targeting two novel signaling transducers, RhoA and nuclear factor of activated T cells 5, as well as molecules previously identified, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1, and TNF receptor-associated factor 6. We propose brain endothelial miR-146a as an endogenous NF- κ B inhibitor in BECs associated with decreased leukocyte adhesion during neuroinflammation.

Introduction

In neuroinflammation such as multiple sclerosis (MS), the blood–brain barrier (BBB) becomes compromised with intensive migration of leukocytes into the central nervous system (CNS), contributing to disease pathogenesis. 1 To migrate into the CNS, leukocytes follow a finely regulated sequence of events starting from tethering and rolling along the vessel, then firmly adhering to and migrating out of the vasculature. Firm adhesion is triggered by chemokines and mediated by interactions between integrins on leukocytes and adhesion molecules on brain endothelial cells (BECs). 2

Overwhelming evidence highlights that the nuclear factor, NF- κ B, drives transcription of cell adhesion molecules, chemokines, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. 3 The NF- κ B complex consists of a family of dimeric transcription factors comprising RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52. The classic pathway involves p50/p65 heterodimers complexed to I κ B in unstimulated cells. Upon stimulation, IKK β mediates the phosphorylation-induced ubiquitination of I κ B, which frees p50/p65 to translocate to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription. 3 NF- κ B also coordinates with other signaling pathways, such as RhoA and transforming growth factor- β to modulate the inflammatory response. 4 , 5 NF- κ B has been proposed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of MS, 3 thereby highlighting endogenous inhibitors of NF- κ B as potential novel therapies.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous noncoding RNAs ~22 nucleotides long that pair to the 3′-untranslated region of messenger RNAs and incorporate them into RNA-induced silencing complexes to repress gene expression. Accumulating evidence implicates certain miRNAs in the pathogenesis of MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE): miR-155 contributes to the pathogenesis of EAE by modulating T-cell differentiation and promoting endothelial barrier dysfunction, 6 , 7 whereas brain endothelial miR-125a-5p tightens BBB and prevents leukocyte migration during inflammation. 8

NF- κ B not only initiates the transcription of protein-coding genes but also drives the expression of miRNA precursors, which act as feedback modulators of NF- κ B. 9 Among them, miR-146a is an NF- κ B-dependent gene and downregulates NF- κ B activities by repressing two signal transducers in human monocytes: TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1). 10 Several studies suggest miR-146a as a molecular brake on inflammation, myeloid cell proliferation, and oncogenic transformation. 11 The anti-inflammatory role of miR-146a has been demonstrated in several cell types including monocytes, 10 T cells, 12 astrocytes, 13 human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), 14 and human BECs. 15 However, its function in BECs remains to be elucidated. Here we show that miR-146a is upregulated in cytokine-activated BECs and decreases leukocyte adhesion by inhibiting NF- κ B through repressing not only TRAF6 and IRAK1 but also RhoA and nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5).

Discussion

miR-146a has been demonstrated as a NF- κ B inhibitor in several cell types other than brain endothelium. In this study, we provide evidence that brain endothelial miR-146a represses multiple targets: NFAT5, RhoA, IRAK1, and TRAF6, to inhibit NF- κ B activity, and subsequently negatively modulate leukocyte adhesion ( Figure 7 ).

In vivo , we have shown that miR-146a is significantly upregulated in isolated microvessels of MS-active lesions and of spinal cords of mice during EAE-APP. In the spinal cords of EAE mice, we further confirmed the expression of miR-146a in endothelium by in situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry. The expression of miR-146a starts to appear before the onset of signs, reaches high levels during EAE-APP when pro-inflammatory cytokines are extensively produced 1 , 2 , 3 and maximum cell infiltration is occurring around the vasculature, and draws back to baseline at remission when BBB dysfunction is restored and with minimal cell infiltration. 7 This observation is in line with the increased expression of miR-146a detected in active MS lesions and in cytokine-treated astrocytes. 21 We also demonstrate that miR-146a is upregulated in cytokine-activated cultured BECs, where NF- κ B activation occurs earlier than miR-146a upregulation. It is possible that miR-146a is transcribed upon onset of inflammation by NF- κ B and levels increase during acute stage of inflammatory conditions to resolve neuroinflammation ( Figure 7 ). It is thus reasonable to predict that miR-146a may act as an anti-inflammatory microRNA in astrocytes and brain endothelial cells as they form a functional neurovascular unit to maintain the integrity of BBB. 22

NF- κ B has been shown to play a central role in several autoimmune diseases such as MS. 3 The NF- κ B pathway fulfils diverse roles in development, maturation, activation and proliferation of lymphocytes, and in regulating pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory function of dendritic cells and macrophages. 3 Brain endothelial transcripts regulated by NF- κ B may include not only miR-146a 11 but also nitric oxide synthases, pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules. 3 In cultured brain, 23 umbilical vein, 18 or retina 24 endothelial cells, inhibition of NF- κ B activity reduces TNF α -induced permeability and/or leukocyte migration. In vivo , reagents used to block NF- κ B activity can reduce the incidence of disease and clinical score of EAE. 25 Here, we show that endothelial miR-146a diminishes both Jurkat T-cell and primary T-cell adhesion to BECs, an effect that is associated with a decrease in NF- κ B nuclear translocation. Similar effects on leukocyte adhesion to endothelium have been observed with NF- κ B inhibitors such as MG-132, adenoviral I κ B, 18 , 23 and small interference for RelA ( Figure 3D ). The effect of miR-146a on NF- κ B nuclear translocation was relatively small at the very early time point. This may result from the fine tuning properties of miRNAs 7 and the kinetics of NF- κ B nuclear translocation that peaks at early time points and then resolves gradually ( Figure 3A ). Furthermore, the relative large effect of miR-146a at later time points may result from additive effects of NF- κ B induced negative feedback regulators such as Bcl3 and I κ B. 3 Nevertheless, the general effect of endothelial miR-146a on leukocyte adhesion to BECs through inactivating NF- κ B is evident. Even though MS is regarded as a T lymphocyte-dependent chronic inflammatory disease, other cells like B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and CNS-resident glia also contribute to the pathogenesis of disease. 3 The effects of endothelial expression of miR-146a on other cell types including various subsets of T cells remain to be explored.

It has been demonstrated that miR-146a negatively modulates NF- κ B through downregulating TRAF6 and IRAK1. 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 In BECs, we also demonstrated that miR-146a repressed translation of TRAF6 and IRAK1 in response to TNF α and IFN γ . Knockdown of TRAF6 and IRAK1 either individually or simultaneously show similar effects as miR-146a on Jurkat T-cell adhesion and nuclear translocation of NF- κ B, although simultaneous knockdown of both proteins together did not result in synergistic effects. TRAF6 and IRAK1 have been mainly associated with IL-1 β signal transduction leading to NF- κ B activation, 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 but several reports demonstrate a role for these two signaling molecules in TNF α -induced NF- κ B activation. 26 , 27 , 28 In addition, an endogenous IL-1 inhibitor, IL1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), blocked IL-1 β - but not TNF α /INF γ -induced NF- κ B activation and Jurkat T-cell adhesion to BECs ( Supplementary Figure 4 ), indicating that TNF α -induced IL-1 expression was not involved in the miR-146a-mediated TRAF6 and/or IRAK1 inhibition on NF- κ B activity. This effect is, however, limited, suggesting the involvement of other NF- κ B modulators targeted by miR-146a that are specific for TNF α and IFN γ . However, levels of another two known miR-146a targets, ROCK1 (ref. 19 ) and STAT1 (ref. 20 ), were not affected by miR-146a overexpression, suggesting tissue-specific actions of miRNAs.

We also identified two other novel miR-146a targets known to modulate NF- κ B activity, NFAT5, and RhoA. NFAT5 together with NFAT1–4 belong to the Rel family, sharing 15% to 17% identity with p50 in the Rel homology region. 29 Most reports on NFAT5 refer to its transcriptional activity in the context of hypertonicity. 29 However, its role in inflammation is only beginning to emerge, with evidence that pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF α , IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, and chemokines, such as CXCL8, CCL2, and CCL5 are transcriptional targets of NFAT5 in various cell types and under various inflammatory stimuli. 29 , 30 Furthermore, there appears to be cross-talk between NFAT5 and NF- κ B 30 or Wnt/ β -catenin, 31 where the latter is important for BBB development. Accumulating evidence suggests the onset of local or systemic hyperosmolality during the course of various inflammatory disorders, such as diabetic microvascular lesions and inflammatory bowel disease. Recently, it has been reported that a high-salt diet leads to a more severe EAE clinical outcome through an effect relying on p38-MAPK and NFAT5-dependent Th17 development. 32 We provide further evidence that NFAT5 is involved in the activation of cerebral endothelium by cytokines, particularly concerning regulation of NF- κ B activation and T-cell adhesion.

RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 are members of the Rho family of small GTPases. Endothelial Rho has been shown to have a crucial role in leukocyte migration across BECs either by modulating the cytoskeleton to embrace leukocytes by promoting docking structures 33 or by acting as an intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) signal transducer. 34 In other endothelium (mostly HUVECs), RhoA has been shown to modulate expression of cytokines, adhesion molecules, and chemokines via Rho/ROCK/(actin cytoskeleton)/NF- κ B signaling cascade. 4 Rho family members and their exchange factors Dbl, Ost, and Vav potently activate NF- κ B, though other transcription factors such as the activating protein-1 (AP-1) family member c-Jun and may also coordinately act together to modulate NF- κ B activities. Our results demonstrating a link between miR-146a and RhoA are in agreement with the role of RhoA in NF- κ B activation and leukocyte adhesion to endothelium.

We have also examined the levels of adhesion molecules downregulated by miR-146a ( Figure 6 ), because of the well-documented observation that NF- κ B initiates adhesion molecule expression and chemokine production in multiple cell types including brain endothelial cells. 3 It seems a reasonable assumption therefore, that cerebral endothelial miR-146a may regulate signal transducers for NF- κ B activation posttranscriptionally, thereby leading to decreased expression of NF- κ B transcriptional targets. Indeed, our results are in line with those obtained in HUVECs, where manipulating levels of miR-146 had a significant indirect effects on transcription of ICAM1, VCAM1, E-selectin and CCL2, whereas these effects are not only because of targeting of NF- κ B activation but also other signaling molecules such as mitogen-activated protein kinase/early growth response pathway and AP-1 signaling. 15 Unexpectedly, we also observed that siIRAK1 and/or siTRAF6 decreased VCAM1 protein levels without affecting its corresponding mRNA levels. It is possible that the role of these two signaling proteins in the inflammatory activation of brain endothelial cells induced by cytokines is a complex process and that, in addition to their role in NF- κ B-mediated transcriptional activation, IRAK1, and TRAF6 may regulate inflammatory molecules such as VCAM1 at the posttranslational level. As an example, IL-1 activates a translational control mechanism that modulates expression of a group of genes, 35 including IL-6, via IRAK1. Alternatively, combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines increases the half-life of VCAM1 mRNA, 36 and TRAF6 and IRAK1 actively regulate the ubiquitin-proteasome system. 37 It is thus conceivable that VCAM1 protein turnover is affected by ablation of IRAK1 and/or TRAF6 in the absence of apparent changes of VCAM1 mRNA levels by a mechanism that remains to be determined.

In summary, we have delineated further the underlying mechanisms through which miR-146a affects T-cell adhesion to human brain endothelium by identifying two novel targets NFAT5 and RhoA, and we have demonstrated the role of IRAK1 and TRAF6, two signaling molecules usually associated with IL-1R and Toll-like receptor responses, in brain endothelial activation by TNF α and IFN γ , we have characterized the temporal and spatial expression of miR-146a in CNS endothelium in MS-active lesions, EAE model, and cultured brain endothelium. As the complex signaling networks appear to control inflammation progression, 28 , 38 it is unlikely that rational therapeutic strategies should focus on modulating the activity of one signaling molecule. Indeed, the emerging role of miRNAs in directly regulating complex signaling networks involved in inflammation, such as cell adhesion molecules 39 , 40 by targeting the expression of several genes makes them suitable therapeutic targets for neuroinflammatory disorders. The limited increase of miR-146a in MS brain endothelium further stresses the necessity to increase miR-146a through therapeutic manipulation to counteract inflammatory responses, thereby potentially preventing the progression of MS pathogenesis.
