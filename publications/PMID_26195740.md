The homeostatic maintenance of the genomic DNA is crucial for regulating aging 
processes. However, the role of RNA homeostasis in aging processes remains 
unknown. RNA helicases are a large family of enzymes that regulate the 
biogenesis and homeostasis of RNA. However, the functional significance of RNA 
helicases in aging has not been explored. Here, we report that a large fraction 
of RNA helicases regulate the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. In particular, 
we show that a DEAD-box RNA helicase, helicase 1 (HEL-1), promotes longevity by 
specifically activating the DAF-16/forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor 
signaling pathway. We find that HEL-1 is required for the longevity conferred by 
reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling (IIS) and is 
sufficient for extending lifespan. We further show that the expression of HEL-1 
in the intestine and neurons contributes to longevity. HEL-1 enhances the 
induction of a large fraction of DAF-16 target genes. Thus, the RNA helicase 
HEL-1 appears to promote longevity in response to decreased IIS as a 
transcription coregulator of DAF-16. Because HEL-1 and IIS are evolutionarily 
well conserved, a similar mechanism for longevity regulation via an RNA 
helicase-dependent regulation of FOXO signaling may operate in mammals, 
including humans.
