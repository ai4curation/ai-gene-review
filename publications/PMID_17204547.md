The IL-10-like cytokine IL-22 is produced by activated T cells. In this study, 
we analyzed the role of this cytokine system in hepatic cells. Expression 
studies were performed by RT-PCR and quantitative PCR. Signal transduction was 
analyzed by Western blot experiments and ELISA. Cell proliferation was measured 
by MTS and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assays. Hepatocyte regeneration was 
studied in in vitro restitution assays. Binding of IL-22 to its receptor complex 
expressed on human hepatic cells and primary human hepatocytes resulted in the 
activation of MAPKs, Akt, and STAT proteins. IL-22 stimulated cell proliferation 
and migration, which were both significantly inhibited by the 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. IL-22 increased the mRNA 
expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 and the proinflammatory 
cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha. SOCS-1/3 overexpression abrogated 
IL-22-induced STAT activation and decreased IL-22-mediated liver cell 
regeneration. Hepatic IL-22 mRNA expression was detectable in different forms of 
human hepatitis, and hepatic IL-22 mRNA levels were increased in murine T 
cell-mediated hepatitis in vivo following cytomegalovirus infection, whereas no 
significant differences were seen in an in vivo model of ischemia-reperfusion 
injury. In conclusion, IL-22 promotes liver cell regeneration by increasing 
hepatic cell proliferation and hepatocyte migration through the activation of 
Akt and STAT signaling, which is abrogated by SOCS-1/3 overexpression.
