Previously we characterized by immunohistology a group of rat anti-mouse thymic 
stromal mAbs (MTS 12, 32, 33, 35, and 37), which recognized novel plasma 
membrane determinants on both thymic stromal cells (TSCs) and thymocytes. The 
present study investigates in more detail this incidence of shared phenotype by 
an extensive flow cytometric analysis of MTS mAb reactivity on TSCs, thymocyte 
subsets, peripheral lymphocytes, and bone marrow cells. Examination of freshly 
isolated or cultured heterogeneous TSCs and TSC clones confirmed that the mAb 
identified plasma membrane molecules on distinct subsets of these cells. All but 
MTS 12 reacted with epithelial cells. Triple-labelling illustrated that MTS 32, 
33, and 37 were also reactive with more than 90% of total thymocytes, but varied 
in their distribution on the four major CD4 and CD8 defined subsets. MTS 12, 
staining with thymic vascular endothelium by immunohistology, labelled more than 
95% of each subset. MTS 35 reactivity in each subset correlated strongly with 
only the immature populations. Examination of peripheral lymphocytes by triple- 
and double-labelling unexpectedly showed that MTS 33, 35, and 37 did not 
recognize peripheral T cells but labelled all B cells. MTS 32 was negative for B 
cells, but positive for all CD8+ T cells, yet only a subset of CD4+ T cells. 
Further, MTS 33, 35, and 37 were present on a significant percentage of bone 
marrow cells. MTS 12 reacted with virtually all peripheral T and B cells, and 
about 50% bone marrow leukocytes. Collectively these results reveal the same 
novel epitopes on different thymic cell types and subsets thereof, highlighting 
specific similarities between cells of apparently diverse lineages. These 
findings may be of importance in the delineation of intercellular communications 
within the thymus and emphasize the integrated nature of the microenvironment in 
this organ.
