The defective expression of frataxin causes the hereditary neurodegenerative 
disorder Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). Human frataxin is synthesized as a 210 
amino acid precursor protein, which needs proteolytic processing into 
mitochondria to be converted into the functional mature form. In vitro 
processing of human frataxin was previously described to yield a 155 amino acid 
mature form, corresponding to residues 56-210 (frataxin(56-210)). Here, we 
studied the maturation of frataxin by in vivo overexpression in human cells. Our 
data show that the main form of mature frataxin is generated by a proteolytic 
cleavage between Lys80 and Ser81, yielding a 130 amino acid protein 
(frataxin(81-210)). This maturation product corresponds to the endogenous 
frataxin detected in human heart, peripheral blood lymphocytes or dermal 
fibroblasts. Moreover, we demonstrate that frataxin(81-210) is biologically 
functional, as it rescues aconitase defects in frataxin-deficient cells derived 
from FRDA patients. Importantly, our data indicate that frataxin(56-210) can be 
produced in vivo when the primary 80-81 maturation site is unavailable, 
suggesting the existence of proteolytic mechanisms that can actively control the 
size of the mature product, with possible functional implications.
