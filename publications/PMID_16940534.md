Emerging data have indicated that hepatitis C virus (HCV) subverts the host 
antiviral response to ensure its persistence. We previously demonstrated that 
HCV protein expression suppresses type I interferon (IFN) signaling by leading 
to the reduction of phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1). We also demonstrated that 
HCV core protein directly bound to STAT1. However, the detailed mechanisms by 
which HCV core protein impacts IFN signaling components have not been fully 
clarified. In this report, we show that the STAT1 interaction domain resides in 
the N-terminal portion of HCV core (amino acids [aa] 1 to 23). This domain is 
also required to produce P-STAT1 reduction and inhibit IFN signaling 
transduction. Conversely, the C-terminal region of STAT1, specifically the SH2 
domain (aa 577 to 684), is required for the interaction of HCV core with STAT1. 
The STAT1 SH2 domain is critical for STAT1 hetero- or homodimerization. We 
propose a model by which the binding of HCV core to STAT1 results in decreased 
P-STAT, blocked STAT1 heterodimerization to STAT2, and, therefore, reduced 
IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 binding to DNA and disrupted IFN-stimulated gene 
transcription.
