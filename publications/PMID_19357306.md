Aurora kinase-A and -B are key regulators of the cell cycle and tumorigenesis. 
It has remained a mystery why these 2 Aurora kinases, although highly similar in 
protein sequence and structure, are distinct in subcellular localization and 
function. Here, we report the striking finding that a single amino acid residue 
is responsible for these differences. We replaced the Gly-198 of Aurora-A with 
the equivalent residue Asn-142 of Aurora-B and found that in HeLa cells, 
Aurora-A(G198N) was recruited to the inner centromere in metaphase and the 
midzone in anaphase, reminiscent of the Aurora-B localization. Moreover, 
Aurora-A(G198N) compensated for the loss of Aurora-B in chromosome misalignment 
and cell premature exit from mitosis. Furthermore, Aurora-A(G198N) formed a 
complex with the Aurora-B partners, INCENP and Survivin, and its localization 
depended on this interaction. Aurora-A(G198N) phosphorylated the Aurora-B 
substrates INCENP and Survivin in vitro. Therefore, we propose that the presence 
of Gly or Asn at a single site assigns Aurora-A and -B to their respective 
partners and thus to their distinctive subcellular localizations and functions.
