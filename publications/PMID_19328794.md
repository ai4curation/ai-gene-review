BACKGROUND & AIMS: Actin-myosin II motor converts chemical energy into 
force/motion in muscle and nonmuscle cells. The phosphorylation of 20-kilodalton 
regulatory myosin light chain (MLC(20)) is critical to the cytoplasmic functions 
of these motors. We do not know whether myosin II and actins in the nucleus 
function as motors to generate relative motion, such as that between RNA 
polymerase II holoenzyme and DNA, for assembly of the preinitiation complex.
METHODS: The experiments were performed on primary cultures of human colonic 
circular smooth muscle cells and rat colonic circular muscle strips.
RESULTS: We show that myosin II and alpha- and beta-actins are present in the 
nuclei of colonic smooth muscle cells. The nuclear myosin II is tethered to 
recognition sequence AGCTCC (-39/-34) in the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 
(ICAM-1) core promoter region. The actins are known to complex with RNA 
polymerase II, and they are tethered to the nucleoskeleton. The 
dephosphorylation of MLC(20) increases the transcription of ICAM-1, whereas its 
phosphorylation decreases it. Colonic inflammation suppresses nuclear myosin 
light chain kinase, which increases the unphosphorylated form of nuclear 
MLC(20), resulting in enhanced transcription of ICAM-1.
CONCLUSIONS: Myosin II is a core transcription factor. The 
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of nuclear MLC(20) results in the sliding of 
myosin and actin molecules past each other, producing relative motion between 
DNA bound to the myosin II and RNA polymerase II holoenzyme bound to actins and 
nucleoskeleton.

Methods

The experiments were performed on primary cultures of human colonic circular smooth muscle cells (HCCSMCs) and rat colonic circular muscle strips.

Results

We show that myosin II and α- and β-actins are present in the nuclei of colonic smooth muscle cells. The nuclear myosin II is tethered to recognition sequence AGCTCC (−39/−34) in the ICAM-1 core promoter region. The actins are known to complex with RNA polymerase II and they are tethered to the nucleoskeleton. The dephosphorylation of MLC 20 increases the transcription of ICAM-1, whereas its phosphorylation decreases it. Colonic inflammation suppresses nuclear MLCK, which increases the unphosphorylated form of nuclear MLC 20 , resulting in enhanced transcription of ICAM-1.

Conclusions

1) Myosin II is a core transcription factor; 2) the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of nuclear MLC 20 results in the sliding of myosin and actin molecules past each other producing relative motion between the DNA bound to the myosin II and RNA polymerase II holoenzyme bound to actins and nucleoskeleton.

Discussion

The presence of myosin I and β-actin in the nuclei of several cell-types, and their associations with RNA polymerases is widely accepted. 4 , 5 , 31 ’ 3 , 6 – 10 Loss-of-function (using antibodies and siRNAs) and gain-of-function (overexpression) paradigms show that the nuclear myosin I and actins are involved in the transcription of ribosomal RNA genes. However, we do not know whether myosin I and -actin interact with each other to regulate the transcription of rRNA genes.

Very little is known about the presence or the function of myosin II in the nucleus. A previous study identified a myosin heavy chain of size identical to that of muscle myosin heavy chain in the nuclear pore complexes 32 and embryonic myosin heavy chain was identified in myoblast nuclei. 33 However, another study ruled out a role of myosin II in the nucleus because its antibodies failed to block the transcription of rRNA genes mediated by RNAP I. 5 These investigators did not examine the potential role of myosin II in mediating the transcription of protein-coding genes by RNAP II. Our immunohistochemical and immunoblotting data show that both smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin II are present in the nuclei of the human colonic circular smooth muscle cells. The nuclear myosin II contains all the essential components, such as MLC 20 , MLC 17 , and MHC, to function as an actin-based motor. The nuclei of these cells also express α-actin and β-actin. Previous studies focused only on β-actin because they used non-muscle cells.

Both smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin IIs in the nucleus are associated with chromatin, which suggests they might regulate transcription. We examined this possibility by investigating the regulation of ICAM-1 gene expression in HCCSMCs. These cells express ICAM-I at a low level in the resting state. Colonic inflammation enhances the expression of ICAM-1 gene by transcriptional upregulation. 13 We found that overexpression of smMLC 20 or nmMLC 20 increases the protein and mRNA expressions of ICAM-I in HCCSMCs. On the other hand, the suppression of MLC 20 by its RNAi decreases the expression of ICAM-I. The transcriptional effects of smMLC 20 and nmMLC 20 are additive, suggesting that they may act independent of each other. Therefore, the non-muscle myosin II alone may regulate gene transcription in cell-types that do not express the smooth muscle-specific myosin II.

The presence of actins and myosin II in the nucleus raised the possibility that they function as a nuclear motor. The classic motor action of actin-based myosin II motor depends on the phosphorylation of MLC 20 . The phosphorylation of MLC 20 primarily at Ser19 by kinases, such as MLCK or Rho-kinase, 34 – 38 increases myosin’s affinity for actin. 27 , 28 The binding of actin results in the hydrolysis of ATP, assembly of myosin II into filaments, and the sliding of myosin and actin filaments past each other to generate motion. The dephosphorylation of MLC 20 by MLCP, reduces the myosin-actin interaction to reverse motion-induced effects. 39

We tested the above hypothesis by investigating whether the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of MLC 20 alters the transcription of ICAM-1. We found that the dephosphorylation of MLC 20 by MLCK inhibitor ML-7 time-dependently enhances the luciferase activity of the ICAM-1/Luc construct as well as the expression of ICAM-1 protein. On the other hand, the phosphorylation of MLC 20 by MLCP inhibitor MCLR time-dependently suppresses the activity of the promoter-reporter construct and the protein expression of ICAM-1. This suggests that unphosphorylated MLC 20 is the active form to induce transcription. The motion produced by the phosphorylation of MLC 20 may distance the core promoter region and RNAP II holoenzyme attached to actins, while its dephosphorylation brings them together.

ChIP and agarose nucleotide pulldown assays showed that myosin II is tethered to the cis -element AGCTCC (−39~−34). The general understanding is that the negatively charged tail of myosin (MHC) binds to the cargo-requiring motion, in this case the positively charged DNA, 4 while the myosin heads walk-along the actin polymers/filaments to produce motion. In the nucleus, the actins bind to the RNA polymerases as well as to the nucleoskeleton. 4 , 8 , 14 , 15 This configuration suggests that an interaction between the actins bound to the nucleoskeleton and RNAPs, and myosin II bound to the DNA may produce relative motion between them to bring together the RNAP II and its associated general transcription factors (GTFs) to the core promoter region of the DNA to form the PIC. The immunoprecipitation experiments showing that myosin II associates with RNAP II, TFIIB, α-actin and β-actin support this suggestion.

The ratio of actin monomers to polymers (about 4:1) in the nucleus is about the same as that in the cytoplasm. 40 The major difference in the two compartments is that the nuclear polymers do not bundle up to form stress fibers. The formation of stress fibers in the cytoplasm may allow the generation of larger forces required for deformations of the cytoskeleton along more or less fixed directions. On the other hand, the actin oligomers in the nucleus may allow more flexibility to the nuclear myosin in moving its cargo in different directions required for the concurrent transcriptional regulation of various genes along the DNA. 31 , 41 The force required to bend or move a small segment of DNA is expected to be much less than that required deforming the stiffer cytoskeleton, therefore, the formation of stress fibers may not be necessary in the nucleus.

The actin-based myosin motor is a ubiquitous transducer of chemical energy stored in ATP to mechanical energy. Our study is the first to show that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of MLC 20 in the nucleus regulates gene transcription. Some of the other prominent nuclear functions that require motion are chromatin-remodeling, elongation and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. ATP-hydrolysis and the presence of both actins and myosin I have been associated with these functions also. 42 , 43 Our findings suggest that actin-myosin II motors may also regulate these nuclear functions requiring the generation of force and motion.

We established the translational relevance of cellular findings by showing that dephosphorylation of MLC 20 is associated with enhanced transcription of ICAM-1 gene in the muscularis externa during colonic inflammation. The inflammatory response suppressed the expression of MLC 20 in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. It also suppressed the expression of MLCK in the cytoplasm and almost obliterated it in the nucleus. As a result, the phospho-MLC 20 was almost absent in the nucleus, but unphosphorylated MLC 20 was increased, which is equivalent to the blockade of MLCK by ML-7. The absence of phosphorylated MLC 20 resulted in an increase in the association of TFIIB with myosin II and increase in the expression of ICAM-1. On the other hand, when we treated the strips of muscularis externa taken from the animals with inflamed colons with MCLR, the expression of ICAM-1 in these tissues decreased time-dependently. MCLR increases the phosphorylation of MLC 20 by inhibiting MLCP. In vivo treatment of rats with MCLR prior to the induction of inflammation also reduced the expression of ICAM-1.

We conclude that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of nuclear MLC 20 regulates the expression of ICAM-1 gene in vitro and in intact animals. Myosin II is a core transcription factor. It binds to its recognition sequence in the core promoter region. MHC may tether to this cis -element. On the other hand, α-actin and β-actin are associated with the RNAP II holoenzyme containing TFIIB and other GTFs. The phosphorylation of MLC 20 initiates motor action to distance DNA from the RNAP II and its associated GTFs and decreases transcription. The dephosphorylation of MLC 20 reverses the motor action to bring DNA closer to the RNAP II and enhances transcription.
