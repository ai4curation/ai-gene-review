"Smart-pooling," in which test reagents are multiplexed in a highly redundant 
manner, is a promising strategy for achieving high efficiency, sensitivity, and 
specificity in systems-level projects. However, previous applications relied on 
low redundancy designs that do not leverage the full potential of smart-pooling, 
and more powerful theoretical constructions, such as the Shifted Transversal 
Design (STD), lack experimental validation. Here we evaluate STD smart-pooling 
in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) interactome mapping. We employed two STD designs and 
two established methods to perform ORFeome-wide Y2H screens with 12 baits. We 
found that STD pooling achieves similar levels of sensitivity and specificity as 
one-on-one array-based Y2H, while the costs and workloads are divided by three. 
The screening-sequencing approach is the most cost- and labor-efficient, yet STD 
identifies about twofold more interactions. Screening-sequencing remains an 
appropriate method for quickly producing low-coverage interactomes, while STD 
pooling appears as the method of choice for obtaining maps with higher coverage.
