Autophagy and endocytosis are dynamic and tightly regulated processes that 
contribute to many fundamental aspects of biology including survival, longevity, 
and development. However, the molecular links between autophagy and endocytosis 
are not well understood. Here, we report that BEC-1, the C. elegans ortholog of 
Atg6/Vps30/Beclin1, a key regulator of the autophagic machinery, also 
contributes to endosome function. In particular we identify a defect in 
retrograde transport from endosomes to the Golgi in bec-1 mutants. 
MIG-14/Wntless is normally recycled from endosomes to the Golgi through the 
action of the retromer complex and its associated factor RME-8. Lack of retromer 
or RME-8 activity results in the aberrant transport of MIG-14/Wntless to the 
lysosome where it is degraded. Similarly, we find that lack of bec-1 also 
results in mislocalization and degradation of MIG-14::GFP, reduced levels of 
RME-8 on endosomal membranes, and the accumulation of morphologically abnormal 
endosomes. A similar phenotype was observed in animals treated with dsRNA 
against vps-34. We further identify a requirement for BEC-1 in the clearance of 
apoptotic corpses in the hermaphrodite gonad, suggesting a role for BEC-1 in 
phagosome maturation, a process that appears to depend upon retrograde 
transport. In addition, autophagy genes may also be required for cell corpse 
clearance, as we find that RNAi against atg-18 or unc-51 also results in a lack 
of cell corpse clearance.
