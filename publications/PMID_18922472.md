Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are proteases that can antagonize 
ubiquitin-mediated signaling by disassembling ubiquitin-protein conjugates. How 
DUBs are regulated in vivo and how their substrate specificities are achieved 
are largely unknown. The conserved DUB Uch37 is found on proteasomes in 
organisms ranging from fission yeast to humans. Deubiquitination by Uch37 is 
activated by proteasomal binding, which enables Uch37 to process polyubiquitin 
chains. Here we show that in the nucleus Uch37 is also associated with the human 
Ino80 chromatin-remodeling complex (hINO80). In hINO80, Uch37 is held in an 
inactive state; however, it can be activated by transient interaction of the 
Ino80 complex with the proteasome. Thus, DUB activities can be modulated both 
positively and negatively via dynamic interactions with partner proteins. In 
addition, our findings suggest that the proteasome and the hINO80 
chromatin-remodeling complex may cooperate to regulate transcription or DNA 
repair, processes in which both complexes have been implicated.
