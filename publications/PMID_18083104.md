Inactivation of constitutive autophagy results in formation of cytoplasmic 
protein inclusions and leads to liver injury and neurodegeneration, but the 
details of abnormalities related to impaired autophagy are largely unknown. Here 
we used mouse genetic analyses to define the roles of autophagy in the 
aforementioned events. We report that the ubiquitin- and LC3-binding protein 
"p62" regulates the formation of protein aggregates and is removed by autophagy. 
Thus, genetic ablation of p62 suppressed the appearance of ubiquitin-positive 
protein aggregates in hepatocytes and neurons, indicating that p62 plays an 
important role in inclusion body formation. Moreover, loss of p62 markedly 
attenuated liver injury caused by autophagy deficiency, whereas it had little 
effect on neuronal degeneration. Our findings highlight the unexpected role of 
homeostatic level of p62, which is regulated by autophagy, in controlling 
intracellular inclusion body formation, and indicate that the pathologic process 
associated with autophagic deficiency is cell-type specific.
