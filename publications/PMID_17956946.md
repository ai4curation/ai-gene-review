COPI recruitment to membranes appears to be essential for the biogenesis of the 
Golgi and for secretory trafficking. Preventing COPI recruitment by expressing 
inactive forms of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) or the ARF-activating 
guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1, or by treating cells with brefeldin A 
(BFA), causes the collapse of the Golgi into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and 
arrests trafficking of soluble and transmembrane proteins at the ER. Here, we 
assess COPI function in Golgi biogenesis and protein trafficking by preventing 
COPI recruitment to membranes by removing GBF1. We report that siRNA-mediated 
depletion of GBF1 causes COPI dispersal but does not lead to collapse of the 
Golgi. Instead, it causes extensive tubulation of the cis-Golgi. The 
Golgi-derived tubules target to peripheral ER-Golgi intermediate compartment 
(ERGIC) sites and create dynamic continuities between the ERGIC and the 
cis-Golgi compartment. COPI dispersal in GBF1-depleted cells causes dramatic 
inhibition of the trafficking of transmembrane proteins. Unexpectedly, soluble 
proteins continue to be secreted from GBF1-depleted cells. Our findings suggest 
that a secretory pathway capable of trafficking soluble proteins can be 
maintained in cells in which COPI recruitment is compromised by GBF1 depletion. 
However, the trafficking of transmembrane proteins through the existing pathway 
requires GBF1-mediated ARF activation and COPI recruitment.
