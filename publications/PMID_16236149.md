Auxin is important for lateral root (LR) initiation and subsequent LR primordium 
development. However, the roles of tissue-specific auxin signaling in these 
processes are poorly understood. We analyzed transgenic Arabidopsis plants 
expressing the stabilized mutant INDOLE-3 ACETIC ACID 14 (IAA14)/SOLITARY-ROOT 
(mIAA14) protein as a repressor of the auxin response factors (ARFs), under the 
control of tissue-specific promoters. We showed that plants expressing the 
mIAA14-glucocorticoid receptor (GR) fusion protein under the control of the 
native IAA14 promoter had the solitary-root/iaa14 mutant phenotypes, including 
the lack of LR formation under dexamethasone (Dex) treatment, indicating that 
mIAA14-GR is functional in the presence of Dex. We then demonstrated that 
expression of mIAA14-GR under the control of the stele-specific SHORT-ROOT 
promoter suppressed LR formation, and showed that mIAA14-GR expression in the 
protoxylem-adjacent pericycle also blocked LR formation, indicating that the 
normal auxin response mediated by auxin/indole-3 acetic acid (Aux/IAA) signaling 
in the protoxylem pericycle is necessary for LR formation. In addition, we 
demonstrated that expression of mIAA14-GR under either the ARF7 or the ARF19 
promoter also suppressed LR formation as in the arf7 arf19 double mutants, and 
that IAA14 interacted with ARF7 and ARF19 in yeasts. These results strongly 
suggest that mIAA14-GR directly inactivates ARF7/ARF19 functions, thereby 
blocking LR formation. Post-embryonic expression of mIAA14-GR under the 
SCARECROW promoter, which is expressed in the specific cell lineage during LR 
primordium formation, caused disorganized LR development. This indicates that 
normal auxin signaling in LR primordia, which involves the unknown ARFs and 
Aux/IAAs, is necessary for the establishment of LR primordium organization. 
Thus, our data show that tissue-specific expression of a stabilized Aux/IAA 
protein allows analysis of tissue-specific auxin responses in LR development by 
inactivating ARF functions.
