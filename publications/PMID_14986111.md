PURPOSE: Nitric oxide, a messenger molecule has been reported as having various 
antineoplastic properties. The activation of insulin-activated nitric oxide 
synthase (IANOS) was found to be related to the production of NO as a result of 
the binding of insulin to its receptor through the activation of tyrosine kinase 
in erythrocyte membrane. As nitric oxide is reported to be a systemic anticancer 
agent, studies were carried out to determine the role of insulin receptor 
binding that lead to the activation of tyrosine kinase and IANOS in erythrocytes 
in breast cancer.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from female breast cancer patients who, at 
the time of participation in the study, had not undergone any therapeutic 
intervention but had opted for surgery. The binding of insulin to its receptor 
in erythrocyte membrane and the activation of both receptor tyrosine kinase and 
IANOS due to the hormone binding were determined and compared with the 
appropriate control.
RESULTS: It was found that the impaired NO synthesis in erythrocyte membrane in 
breast cancer was related to the marked decrease of insulin binding sites of the 
high-affinity hormone receptor population. This impaired insulin binding to 
high-affinity receptors resulted in the impairment of both reaction velocity 
(Vmax) of the IANOS and receptor tyrosine kinase activation.
CONCLUSION: These results indicated that the impairment of interaction between 
insulin and its high-affinity receptors in erythrocyte membrane might be a 
critical pathophysiological event in the development of breast cancer.

Methods

Blood samples were collected from female breast cancer patients who, at the time of participation in the study, had not undergone any therapeutic intervention but had opted for surgery. The binding of insulin to its receptor in erythrocyte membrane and the activation of both receptor tyrosine kinase and IANOS due to the hormone binding were determined and compared with the appropriate control.

Results

It was found that the impaired NO synthesis in erythrocyte membrane in breast cancer was related to the marked decrease of insulin binding sites of the high-affinity hormone receptor population. This impaired insulin binding to high-affinity receptors resulted in the impairment of both reaction velocity (Vmax) of the IANOS and receptor tyrosine kinase activation.

Conclusion

These results indicated that the impairment of interaction between insulin and its high-affinity receptors in erythrocyte membrane might be a critical pathophysiological event in the development of breast cancer.

Introduction

Nitric oxide, a physiologic messenger molecule, is synthesized from l -Arginine, by a family of isoenzymes called nitric oxide synthases (Palmer et al. 1988 , Ignarro et al. 1990 ). Nitric oxide (NO), also known as endothelial-derived relaxing factor, has been reported to have diverse effects in various physiological and pathological events (Bredt and Snyder 1994 ; Camehn and Reshe 2000 ; Sinha et al. 2000 ; Acharya et al. 2001 ; Sinha et al. 2002 ; Hofseth et al. 2003 ).

Cancer cells are known for their uncontrolled growth, loss of contact inhibition, differentiation, and impaired programmed cell death or apoptosis (Simeone et al. 2002 ; Hofseth et al. 2003 ). Nitric oxide has been shown to be cytostatic/cytotoxic for cancer cells through its ability to induce apoptosis and differentiation in neoplastic cells (Jenkins et al. 1995 ). It has also been reported that the tumoricidal effects of lipopolysaccharides and γ-interferon are mediated through the production of NO by the macrophages (Dong et al. 1993 ; Uchida et al. 1997 ). These studies on the antineoplastic properties of NO would suggest that the messenger molecule could have an important role in the control of various kinds of cancer (Sinha et al. 2002 ).

Recently, our laboratory reported a novel constitutive form of insulin-activated nitric oxide synthase (IANOS) in human erythrocyte membrane that could be activated by physiologic amounts of the hormone (Bhattacharya et al. 2001 ). Nitric oxide thus formed was not only reported as being the “second messenger “ for the well-known hypoglycemic effect of insulin (Kahn et al. 2000 ), but we have also recently described the impairment of IANOS activity of the erythrocytes in the setting of various neoplastic conditions (Sinha et al. 2002 ). Since the activation of IANOS was found to be related both to the binding of the hormone to the hormone receptor and to the activation of receptor tyrosine kinase (Bhattacharya et al. 2001 ), we investigated the role of insulin receptor interaction in the activation of both tyrosine kinase and IANOS in erythrocyte membrane in human breast cancer.

Materials and methods

All chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade. l-Arginine, protein A, DEAE cellulose, cyanogen bromide, aprotinin, and phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) were purchased from Sigma Chemical, USA. Insulin was purchased from Novo Nordisk, and 125 I was purchased from BRIT, Bhaba Atomic Research Center, Mumbai, India. γ 32 P ATP was obtained from Amersham, England.

Discussion

These results demonstrated that as a consequence of impaired interaction between insulin and its high-affinity receptor population on the membrane surface, the stimulation of NO synthesis in erythrocytes by insulin was decreased due to the impairment of receptor tyrosine kinase activity in human breast cancer (Fig. 1 , Fig. 4 , and Fig. 5 ; Table 2 ).

It could be argued that the impairment of insulin-stimulated synthesis of NO as reported here was an erythrocyte-specific phenomenon in breast cancer and may not be relevant to the breast cancer tissue per se. However, we have reported before that the impairment of insulin-induced stimulation of NO in human breast cancer occurred not only in the case of erythrocytes which were apparently of nonmalignant origin, but also in the case of the cells from malignant tissue itself indicating a systemic impairment of IANOS activity in this condition leading to the reduction of cellular NO level (Guha et al. 2002 ).

This reduction of cellular NO level might have important consequences in the pathophysiology of the malignant condition. For example, it has been reported by several investigators that the increase of NO level resulted in the expression of maspin, a serine protease inhibitor, that controlled the progression and metastasis of breast cancer (Khalkhali et al. 2003 ). We have reported that the treatment of erythrocytes from breast cancer patients with tamoxifen, a widely used nonsteroidal compound in this condition, partially restored the insulin-stimulated NO production (Guha et al. 2002 ). Other investigators have reported that tamoxifen was capable of increasing both the secretion of maspin and the invasion blocking ability in human breast cancer cells through NO production (Shao et al. 2000 ). Moreover, the increased NO level has been reported to play an essential role in TNFα -induced apoptosis in human breast cancer (Binder et al. 1999 ; Reveneau et al. 1999 ). When all these effects of increased cellular NO level in breast cancer cells are taken together it could be hypothesized that the impairment of insulin induced NO synthesis might provide a procarcinogenic milieu for the progression of breast cancer due to “suboptimal” cellular NO level. On the other hand, the increase of cellular NO level has been correlated positively with tumor grade in breast cancer. Nevertheless, it was concluded by the investigators that this protumor activity of NO was related to the “local” concentration of the molecule (Jenkins et al. 1995 ).

In this context, it should be motioned here that while “excess” (nonphysiologic) production of NO at the cellular level—due to uncontrolled activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase—could be procarcinogenic, the activity of insulin-activated nitric oxide synthase was stringently regulated by NO itself to maintain homeostasis for its anticancer activity (Sinha et al. 2002 ).

Although it is not known whether the decreased level of the high-affinity insulin receptor population in breast cancer was an inborn or an acquired defect, in a preliminary study it was found that the stage of the malignant condition did not influence the degree of impairment of insulin receptor interaction (unpublished), indicating that the defect was probably an early event in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. However, it is not known whether the defect was the manifestation of systemic flaw in the synthesis of the receptor protein or to the synthesis of site-specific anti-receptor antibody due to molecular mimicry (Sinha et al. 2002 ). In any event, this defect would not only favor the development of breast cancer and impaired stimulation of NO synthesis by insulin, but might also result in the development of diabetes mellitus (Kahn et al. 2000 ), which might be a risk factor for breast cancer itself (Weiderpass et al. 1997 ; Bruning et al. 1992 ).

As described above, the Lineweaver-Burk plot of the activity of IANOS in normal erythrocyte membranes in the presence of insulin resulted in the marked decrease of K m of l-Arginine. In the case of erythrocyte membranes from breast cancer patients, the presence of the hormone resulted only in the marginal decrease of K m of the substrate (Table 1 ) As the K m of a substrate for an enzyme catalyzed reaction is necessarily related to the enzymic efficacy for the synthesis of the product, these results indicate that IANOS in the erythrocyte membranes in breast cancer is less efficient in the production of NO through the l-Arginine dependent reaction. As such, these results imply that an increased availability of l-Arginine in the system would favor the production of NO more efficiently in breast cancer and consequently might be beneficial in this condition.
