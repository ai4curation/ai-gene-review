In addition to inter-chromatid cohesion, mitotic and meiotic chromatids must 
have three physical properties: compaction into 'threads' roughly co-linear with 
their DNA sequence, intra-chromatid cohesion determining their rigidity, and a 
mechanism to promote sister chromatid disentanglement. A fundamental issue in 
chromosome biology is whether a single molecular process accounts for all three 
features. There is universal agreement that a pair of Smc-kleisin complexes 
called condensin I and II facilitate sister chromatid disentanglement, but 
whether they also confer thread formation or longitudinal rigidity is either 
controversial or has never been directly addressed respectively. We show here 
that condensin II (beta-kleisin) has an essential role in all three processes 
during meiosis I in mouse oocytes and that its function overlaps with that of 
condensin I (gamma-kleisin), which is otherwise redundant. Pre-assembled meiotic 
bivalents unravel when condensin is inactivated by TEV cleavage, proving that it 
actually holds chromatin fibres together.
