When faced with nutrient deprivation, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells enter into 
a nondividing resting state, known as stationary phase. The Ras/PKA 
(cAMP-dependent protein kinase) signaling pathway plays an important role in 
regulating the entry into this resting state and the subsequent survival of 
stationary phase cells. The survival of these resting cells is also dependent 
upon autophagy, a membrane trafficking pathway that is induced upon nutrient 
deprivation. Autophagy is responsible for targeting bulk protein and other 
cytoplasmic constituents to the vacuolar compartment for their ultimate 
degradation. The data presented here demonstrate that the Ras/PKA signaling 
pathway inhibits an early step in autophagy because mutants with elevated levels 
of Ras/PKA activity fail to accumulate transport intermediates normally 
associated with this process. Quantitative assays indicate that these increased 
levels of Ras/PKA signaling activity result in an essentially complete block to 
autophagy. Interestingly, Ras/PKA activity also inhibited a related process, the 
cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway that is responsible for the 
delivery of a subset of vacuolar proteins in growing cells. These data therefore 
indicate that the Ras/PKA signaling pathway is not regulating a switch between 
the autophagy and Cvt modes of transport. Instead, it is more likely that this 
signaling pathway is controlling an activity that is required during the early 
stages of both of these membrane trafficking pathways. Finally, the data suggest 
that at least a portion of the Ras/PKA effects on stationary phase survival are 
the result of the regulation of autophagy activity by this signaling pathway.
