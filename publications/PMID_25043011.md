Ubiquitination is a crucial cellular signalling process, and is controlled on 
multiple levels. Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) are regulated by the 
eight-subunit COP9 signalosome (CSN). CSN inactivates CRLs by removing their 
covalently attached activator, NEDD8. NEDD8 cleavage by CSN is catalysed by 
CSN5, a Zn(2+)-dependent isopeptidase that is inactive in isolation. Here we 
present the crystal structure of the entire ∼350-kDa human CSN holoenzyme at 
3.8 Å resolution, detailing the molecular architecture of the complex. CSN has 
two organizational centres: a horseshoe-shaped ring created by its six 
proteasome lid-CSN-initiation factor 3 (PCI) domain proteins, and a large bundle 
formed by the carboxy-terminal α-helices of every subunit. CSN5 and its 
dimerization partner, CSN6, are intricately embedded at the core of the helical 
bundle. In the substrate-free holoenzyme, CSN5 is autoinhibited, which precludes 
access to the active site. We find that neddylated CRL binding to CSN is sensed 
by CSN4, and communicated to CSN5 with the assistance of CSN6, resulting in 
activation of the deneddylase.
