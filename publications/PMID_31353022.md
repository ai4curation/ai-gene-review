The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor links over 150 proteins to the 
cell surface and is present on every cell type. Many of these proteins play 
crucial roles in neuronal development and function. Mutations in 18 of the 29 
genes implicated in the biosynthesis of the GPI anchor have been identified as 
the cause of GPI biosynthesis deficiencies (GPIBDs) in humans. GPIBDs are 
associated with intellectual disability and seizures as their cardinal features. 
An essential component of the GPI transamidase complex is PIGU, along with PIGK, 
PIGS, PIGT, and GPAA1, all of which link GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) onto 
the GPI anchor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we report two homozygous 
missense mutations (c.209T>A [p.Ile70Lys] and c.1149C>A [p.Asn383Lys]) in five 
individuals from three unrelated families. All individuals presented with global 
developmental delay, severe-to-profound intellectual disability, muscular 
hypotonia, seizures, brain anomalies, scoliosis, and mild facial dysmorphism. 
Using multicolor flow cytometry, we determined a characteristic profile for GPI 
transamidase deficiency. On granulocytes this profile consisted of reduced 
cell-surface expression of fluorescein-labeled proaerolysin (FLAER), CD16, and 
CD24, but not of CD55 and CD59; additionally, B cells showed an increased 
expression of free GPI anchors determined by T5 antibody. Moreover, 
computer-assisted facial analysis of different GPIBDs revealed a characteristic 
facial gestalt shared among individuals with mutations in PIGU and GPAA1. Our 
findings improve our understanding of the role of the GPI transamidase complex 
in the development of nervous and skeletal systems and expand the clinical 
spectrum of disorders belonging to the group of inherited GPI-anchor 
deficiencies.
