Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta1) suppresses the growth of mink lung 
Mv1Lu epithelial cells, whereas testicular hyaluronidase abolishes the growth 
inhibition. Exposure of Mv1Lu cells to TGF-beta1 rapidly resulted in 
down-regulation of cytosolic IkappaBalpha and hyaluronidase prevented this 
effect, suggesting a possible role of IkappaBalpha in the growth regulation. 
Ectopic expression of wild-type and dominant negative IkappaBalpha prevented 
TGF-beta1-mediated growth suppression. Nonetheless, the blocking effect of 
IkappaBalpha is not related to regulation of NF-kappaB function by its 
N-terminal ankyrin-repeat region (amino acids 1-243). Removal of the PEST 
(proline-glutamic acid-serine-threonine) domain-containing C terminus (amino 
acids 244-314) abolished the IkappaBalpha function, and the C terminus alone 
blocked the TGF-beta1 growth-inhibitory effect. Co-immunoprecipitation by 
anti-p53 antibody using Mv1Lu and other types of cells, as well as rat liver and 
spleen, revealed that a portion of cytosolic IkappaBalpha physically interacted 
with p53. In contrast, Mdm2, an inhibitor of p53, was barely detectable in the 
immunoprecipitates. The cytosolic p53 x IkappaBalpha complex rapidly dissociated 
in response to apoptotic stress, etoposide- and UV-mediated DNA damage, hypoxia, 
and TGF-beta1-mediated growth suppression. Also, a rapid increase in the 
formation of the nuclear p53 x IkappaBalpha complex was observed during exposure 
to etoposide and UV. In contrast, TGF-beta1-mediated promotion of fibroblast 
growth failed to mediate p53 x IkappaBalpha dissociation. Mapping by yeast 
two-hybrid showed that the non-ankyrin C terminus of IkappaBalpha physically 
interacted with the proline-rich region and a phosphorylation site, serine 46, 
in p53. Deletion of serine 46 or alteration of serine 46 to glycine abolished 
the p53 x IkappaBalpha interaction. Alteration to threonine retained the binding 
interaction, suggesting that serine 46 phosphorylation is involved in the p53 x 
IkappaBalpha complex formation. Functionally, enhancement of p53 apoptosis was 
observed when p53 and IkappaBalpha were transiently co-expressed in cells. 
Together, the IkappaBalpha x p53 complex plays an important role in responses 
involving growth regulation, apoptosis, and hypoxic stress.

## Full Text

The onco-suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that regulates a wide spectrum of genes involved in various cellular functions including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, senescence, autophagy, DNA repair and angiogenesis. p53 and NF-κB generally have opposing effects in cancer cells. While p53 activity is associated with apoptosis induction, the stimulation of NF-κB has been demonstrated to promote resistance to programmed cell death. Although the transcription factor NF-κB family is considered as the master regulator of cancer development and maintenance, it has been mainly studied in relation to its ability to regulate p53. This has revealed the importance of the crosstalk between NF-κB, p53 and other crucial cell signaling pathways. This review analyzes the various mechanisms by which NF-κB regulates the activity of p53 and the role of p53 on NF-κB activity.
