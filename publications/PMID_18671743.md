Understanding the neurobiology of the transition from initial drug use to 
excessive drug use has been a challenge in drug addiction. We examined the 
effect of chronic 'binge' escalating dose cocaine administration, which mimics 
human compulsive drug use, on behavioural responses and the dopaminergic system 
of mice and compared it with a chronic steady dose (3 x 15 mg/kg/day) 'binge' 
cocaine administration paradigm. Male C57BL/6J mice were injected with saline or 
cocaine in an escalating dose paradigm for 14 days. Locomotor and stereotypy 
activity were measured and quantitative autoradiographic mapping of D(1) and 
D(2) receptors, dopamine transporters and D(2)-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS 
binding was performed in the brains of mice treated with this escalating and 
steady dose paradigm. An initial sensitization to the locomotor effects of 
cocaine followed by a dose-dependent increase in the duration of the locomotor 
effect of cocaine was observed in the escalating but not the steady dose 
paradigm. Sensitization to the stereotypy effect of cocaine and an increase in 
cocaine-induced stereotypy score was observed from 3 x 20 to 3 x 25 mg/kg/day 
cocaine. There was a significant decrease in D(2) receptor density, but an 
increase in D(2)-stimulated G-protein activity and dopamine transporter density 
in the striatum of cocaine-treated mice, which was not observed in our steady 
dose paradigm. Our results document that chronic 'binge' escalating dose cocaine 
treatment triggers profound behavioural and neurochemical changes in the 
dopaminergic system, which might underlie the transition from drug use to 
compulsive drug use associated with addiction, which is a process of escalation.
