Activity of penicillin-binding protein 3 from Escherichia coli.

Pisabarro AG, Prats R, Váquez D, Rodríguez-Tébar A.

The activity of penicillin-binding protein 3 of Escherichia coli has been 
studied both in vivo and in ether-permeabilized cells. The peptidoglycan 
transpeptidase activity of penicillin-binding protein 3 appears to use either 
nascent or exogenously added UDP-N-acetylmuramyl tripeptide-derived substrates 
as acceptors. By means of a defilamentation system which elicited the activity 
of penicillin-binding protein 3 in vivo, the structure of peptidoglycan made by 
this enzyme has been elucidated. This peptidoglycan, very probably of septal 
location, contained increased amounts of cross-linked peptidoglycan as well as a 
higher ratio of tripeptide-containing cross-linked subunits.
