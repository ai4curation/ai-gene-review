TAP translocates virus-derived peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic 
reticulum, where the peptides are loaded onto MHC class I molecules. This 
process is crucial for the detection of virus-infected cells by CTL that 
recognize the MHC class I-peptide complexes at the cell surface. The 
varicellovirus bovine herpesvirus 1 encodes a protein, UL49.5, that acts as a 
potent inhibitor of TAP. UL49.5 acts in two ways, as follows: 1) by blocking 
conformational changes of TAP required for the translocation of peptides into 
the endoplasmic reticulum, and 2) by targeting TAP1 and TAP2 for proteasomal 
degradation. At present, it is unknown whether UL49.5 interacts with TAP1, TAP2, 
or both. The contribution of other members of the peptide-loading complex has 
not been established. Using TAP-deficient cells reconstituted with wild-type and 
recombinant forms of TAP1 and TAP2, TAP was defined as the prime target of 
UL49.5 within the peptide-loading complex. The presence of TAP1 and TAP2 was 
required for efficient interaction with UL49.5. Using deletion mutants of TAP1 
and TAP2, the 6+6 transmembrane core complex of TAP was shown to be sufficient 
for UL49.5 to interact with TAP and block its function. However, UL49.5-induced 
inhibition of peptide transport was most efficient in cells expressing 
full-length TAP1 and TAP2. Inhibition of TAP by UL49.5 appeared to be 
independent of the presence of other peptide-loading complex components, 
including tapasin. These results demonstrate that UL49.5 acts directly on the 
6+6 transmembrane TAP core complex of TAP by blocking essential conformational 
transitions required for peptide transport.
