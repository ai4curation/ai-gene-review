The human lysosomal polypeptide ABC transporter TAPL (ABC subfamily B member 9, 
ABCB9) transports 6-59-amino-acid-long polypeptides from the cytosol into 
lysosomes. The subcellular localization of TAPL depends solely on its N-terminal 
transmembrane domain, TMD0, which lacks conventional targeting sequences. 
However, the intracellular route and the molecular mechanisms that control TAPL 
localization remain unclear. Here, we delineated the route of TAPL to lysosomes 
and investigated the determinants of single trafficking steps. By synchronizing 
trafficking events by a retention using selective hooks (RUSH) assay and 
visualizing individual intermediate steps through immunostaining and confocal 
microscopy, we demonstrate that TAPL takes the direct route to lysosomes. We 
further identified conserved charged residues within TMD0 transmembrane helices 
that are essential for individual steps of lysosomal targeting. Substitutions of 
these residues retained TAPL in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi. We also 
observed that for release from the ER, a salt bridge between Asp-17 and Arg-57 
is essential. An interactome analysis revealed that Yip1-interacting factor 
homolog B membrane-trafficking protein (YIF1B) interacts with TAPL. We also 
found that YIF1B is involved in ER-to-Golgi trafficking and interacts with TMD0 
of TAPL via its transmembrane domain and that this interaction strongly depends 
on the newly identified salt bridge within TMD0. These results expand our 
knowledge about lysosomal trafficking of TAPL and the general function of extra 
transmembrane domains of ABC transporters.
