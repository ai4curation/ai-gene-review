Studies of the temperature-sensitive cdc37-1 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
suggest that Cdc37 is required for passage through the G1 phase of the cell 
cycle, but its precise function is not known. We have investigated the role of 
Cdc37 in the regulation of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase Cdc28. We find 
that G1 arrest in the cdc37-1 mutant is accompanied by a decrease in the Cdc28 
activity associated with the G1 cyclin Cln2. This defect appears to be caused by 
a decrease in the binding of Cdc28 and Cln2. cdc37-1 mutants also exhibit a 
defect in the binding and activation of Cdc28 by the mitotic cyclin Clb2. Thus 
Cdc37 may be a regulator that is required for the association of Cdc28 with 
multiple cyclins.
