IL-15 is a novel cytokine, produced by monocytes/macrophages, with biological 
activities similar to IL-2 but with no significant sequence homology. IL-15 also 
stimulates human B cells to proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion. We 
measured serum levels of IL-15 in 84 HIV-1-infected individuals at different 
stages of disease in reference to 41 healthy blood donors. Our results show a 
marked elevation of IL-15 serum levels during HIV-1 infection. Moreover, we 
found that this increase correlated with serum levels of IgG (r = 0.376, P < 
0.0001), and partly with serum IgM (r = 0.265, P = 0.015). A significant 
increase of IL-15 production by cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC) and purified monocytes in the presence of HIV-1 virus suggests that 
monocytes/macrophages may be a source of higher IL-15 serum levels in 
HIV-1-infected individuals. These findings indicate a participation of IL-15 in 
the hypergammaglobulinaemia frequently associated with HIV-1 infection.
