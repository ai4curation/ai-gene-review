Light is a major environmental signal for circadian rhythms. We have identified 
and analyzed cry, a novel Drosophila cryptochrome gene. All characterized family 
members are directly photosensitive and include plant blue light photoreceptors. 
We show that cry transcription is under circadian regulation, influenced by the 
Drosophila clock genes period, timeless, Clock, and cycle. We also show that cry 
protein levels are dramatically affected by light exposure. Importantly, 
circadian photosensitivity is increased in a cry-overexpressing strain. These 
physiological and genetic data therefore link a specific photoreceptor molecule 
to circadian rhythmicity. Taken together with the data in the accompanying 
paper, we propose that CRY is a major Drosophila photoreceptor dedicated to the 
resetting of circadian rhythms.
