Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) represents a group of recessive developmental 
disorders characterized by impaired growth of the pons and cerebellum, which 
frequently follows a degenerative course. Currently, there are 10 partially 
overlapping clinical subtypes and 13 genes known mutated in PCH. Here, we report 
biallelic TBC1D23 mutations in six individuals from four unrelated families 
manifesting a non-degenerative form of PCH. In addition to reduced volume of 
pons and cerebellum, affected individuals had microcephaly, psychomotor delay, 
and ataxia. In zebrafish, tbc1d23 morphants replicated the human phenotype 
showing hindbrain volume loss. TBC1D23 localized at the trans-Golgi and was 
regulated by the small GTPases Arl1 and Arl8, suggesting a role in trans-Golgi 
membrane trafficking. Altogether, this study provides a causative link between 
TBC1D23 mutations and PCH and suggests a less severe clinical course than other 
PCH subtypes.
