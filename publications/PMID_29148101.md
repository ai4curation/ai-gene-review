Homeobox protein MSX-1 (hereafter referred to as MSX-1) is essential for early 
tooth-germ development. Tooth-germ development is arrested at bud stage in Msx1 
knockout mice, which prompted us to study the functions of MSX-1 beyond this 
stage. Here, we investigated the roles of MSX-1 during late bell stage. 
Mesenchymal cells of the mandibular first molar were isolated from mice at 
embryonic day (E)17.5 and cultured in vitro. We determined the expression levels 
of β-catenin, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2), Bmp4, and lymphoid 
enhancer-binding factor 1 (Lef1) after knockdown or overexpression of Msx1. Our 
findings suggest that knockdown of Msx1 promoted expression of Bmp2, Bmp4, and 
Lef1, resulting in elevated differentiation of odontoblasts, which was rescued 
by blocking the expression of these genes. In contrast, overexpression of Msx1 
decreased the expression of Bmp2, Bmp4, and Lef1, leading to a reduction in 
odontoblast differentiation. The regulation of Bmp2, Bmp4, and Lef1 by Msx1 was 
mediated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Additionally, knockdown of Msx1 
impaired cell proliferation and slowed S-phase progression, while overexpression 
of Msx1 also impaired cell proliferation and prolonged G1-phase progression. We 
therefore conclude that MSX-1 maintains cell proliferation by regulating 
transition of cells from G1-phase to S-phase and prevents odontoblast 
differentiation by inhibiting expression of Bmp2, Bmp4, and Lef1 at the late 
bell stage via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
