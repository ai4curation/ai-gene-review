Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappaB signaling mechanisms provide central controls in 
development and disease, but how these pathways intersect is unclear. Using hair 
follicle induction as a model system, we show that patterning of dermal 
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling requires epithelial beta-catenin activity. We find 
that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is absolutely required for NF-kappaB activation, 
and that Edar is a direct Wnt target gene. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is 
initially activated independently of EDA/EDAR/NF-kappaB activity in primary hair 
follicle primordia. However, Eda/Edar/NF-kappaB signaling is required to refine 
the pattern of Wnt/beta-catenin activity, and to maintain this activity at later 
stages of placode development. We show that maintenance of localized expression 
of Wnt10b and Wnt10a requires NF-kappaB signaling, providing a molecular 
explanation for the latter observation, and identify Wnt10b as a direct 
NF-kappaB target. These data reveal a complex interplay and interdependence of 
Wnt/beta-catenin and EDA/EDAR/NF-kappaB signaling pathways in initiation and 
maintenance of primary hair follicle placodes.

INTRODUCTION

Hair follicle development requires reciprocal communication between surface epithelial cells and the underlying mesenchyme that is mediated by secreted signaling molecules ( Schmidt-Ullrich and Paus, 2005 ). A signal from the dermis is thought to initiate formation of a regular array of epithelial thickenings, known as hair follicle placodes ( Hardy, 1992 ). Whether this initiating dermal signal is broadly expressed or patterned is unknown. Signaling from the placodes promotes clustering of underlying dermal fibroblasts, forming dermal condensates that are the precursors of hair follicle dermal papillae ( Schmidt-Ullrich and Paus, 2005 ). Further signaling interactions between the hair placode and the nascent dermal papilla lead to placode down-growth and hair follicle morphogenesis. Mouse hair follicle development occurs in several waves, with primary (guard) hair follicle placodes appearing at approximately E14.5, and secondary (awl and zigzag hair) placodes forming between E16.5 and birth ( Schmidt-Ullrich and Paus, 2005 ).

Among known signaling mechanisms involved in hair follicle development, the Wnt/β-catenin and Eda/Edar pathways appear to play the earliest roles ( Fuchs, 2007 ; Schmidt-Ullrich and Paus, 2005 ). Expression of several Wnt ligands and Wnt reporter transgenes is specifically elevated in developing hair follicles ( DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999 ; Maretto et al., 2003 ; Reddy et al., 2001 ), and forced activation of β-catenin signaling promotes hair follicle fate in both embryonic and postnatal skin ( Gat et al., 1998 ; Narhi et al., 2008 ; Zhang et al., 2008 ). Conversely, ectopic expression of the secreted Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 in embryonic mouse epidermis prevents the initiation of hair follicle development and blocks patterned expression of all molecular placode markers, including Wnt ligands, suggesting the importance of an earlier acting, broadly expressed Wnt signal ( Andl et al., 2002 ). Inefficient depletion of β-catenin from embryonic epidermis also blocks early stages of hair follicle development ( Huelsken et al., 2001 ), although the precise stage of arrest remains unclear.

Binding of the A1 isoform of the Tumor Necrosis Factor α family member Ectodysplasin to its receptor EDAR induces nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB, and NF-κB pathway activation in developing hair follicle placodes ( Kumar et al., 2001 ; Schmidt-Ullrich et al., 2006 ; Yan et al., 2000 ). Loss of function mutations in these genes or suppression of NF-κB activity by ubiquitous expression of the transdominant super-repressor IκBαΔN block very early stages in the formation of primary and zigzag hair follicles, but do not affect awl or vibrissa follicle development ( Schmidt-Ullrich and Paus, 2005 ; Schmidt-Ullrich et al., 2006 ). Transient primary pre-placode structures are detected in the absence of Eda/Edar/NF-κB signaling (henceforth referred to as Edar signaling), but these fail to express Shh or cyclin D1 and are not maintained ( Schmidt-Ullrich et al., 2006 ).

Formation of a regular, patterned array of primary hair follicles is thought to occur via a reaction-diffusion mechanism based on competition between placode promoting and placode-inhibitory morphogens ( Jiang et al., 2004 ). Secreted Wnt inhibitors such as Dkk4 may contribute to array establishment by blocking the actions of placodal Wnts in adjacent interfollicular epidermis ( Bazzi et al., 2007 ; Sick et al., 2006 ), while the Edar-BMP mutual activation-inhibition system is suggested to stabilize a labile pre-pattern established by early Wnt/β-catenin signaling ( Mou et al., 2006 ). However, it is unclear how the Wnt/β-catenin and Edar signaling pathways intersect at the molecular level, and to what extent these pathways are inter-dependent. It is also not clear whether Wnt/β-catenin signaling operates solely within the ectoderm in its interactions with Edar pathway components or whether Wnt indirectly controls such interactions via the dermis ( Andl et al., 2002 ).

To address these questions we analyzed the effects of specific genetic manipulations of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway on the pattern of Wnt signaling activity, and on Edar signaling and function. Conversely, we determined the effects of loss of Edar signaling on Wnt pathway activity. The results of these experiments demonstrated an unexpected requirement for epithelial β-catenin in establishing patterned dermal Wnt activity, and revealed a complex interplay and interdependence between the Wnt and Edar signaling pathways in primary hair follicle placode formation.

DISCUSSION

The Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB signaling pathways play critical roles in development, homeostasis and cancer ( Clevers, 2006 ; Courtois, 2005 ; Naugler and Karin, 2008 ). However, how Wnt and NF-κB pathway components interact in the complex network of biological communication that regulates these processes remains unclear. Here we have used an accessible and well-characterized developmental system to dissect the precise temporal relationship and molecular cross-talk by which these key signaling pathways intersect to initiate development of a complex mini-organ, the primary hair follicle. Our results reveal a mandatory role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling within the surface ectoderm in priming keratinocytes to become follicular keratinocytes. This finding is consistent with the observed induction of ubiquitous hair placode formation in embryos carrying an activating mutation in surface ectodermal β-catenin ( Narhi et al., 2008 ; Zhang et al., 2008 ). Our data support a model in which Wnt/β-catenin and Eda/Edar signals engage in a complex interplay following the initial adoption of placode fate by surface ectodermal cells in response to activated Wnt signaling ( Figure 7 ).

Tissue recombination experiments suggest that a dermal signal initiates hair follicle placode development ( Hardy, 1992 ); however, whether this signal is uniform, or is generated by clustered mesenchymal cells that form a pre-pattern, has been unclear. We identified cond-lacZ expression as a very early marker of skin patterning that is initially expressed broadly in the upper dermis and becomes patterned in both epithelium and dermis at least one day before the morphological appearance of placodes. Our finding that patterning of dermal cond-lacZ expression requires epithelial β-catenin is consistent with a model in which patterning first arises in the epithelium rather than the dermis. Specific inhibition and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in upper dermal cells will be required to determine the functional relevance of dermal β-catenin signaling for epithelial patterning and hair follicle development.

Irrespective of the contribution of dermal Wnt signaling, we show here that Wnt/β-catenin signaling within epithelial cells is required for activation of Eda/Edar/NF-κB signaling, and subsequent molecular and morphological events essential for hair follicle development. We find that, in addition to its known role in regulating Eda expression ( Durmowicz et al., 2002 ; Laurikkala et al., 2001 ), Wnt/β-catenin also directly regulates expression of Edar . One role of Edar signaling is to suppress placode-inhibitory BMP signals ( Mou et al., 2006 ; Pummila et al., 2007 ). However, we find that neither exogenous Noggin, nor forced activation of Eda-A1 or ligand-independent Edar, can rescue hair follicle development in the absence of Wnt signaling. These data indicate that expression of additional Wnt targets is required. As secondary (awl) hair follicle morphogenesis requires Wnt/β-catenin but is independent of NF-κB signaling, some of these additional targets may also be utilized in secondary hair follicle development. Our data further suggest that formation of the “messy” pre-pattern established by focal activation of β-catenin signaling at E13.5 is necessary to produce a molecular context in which downstream patterning events can proceed.

While focal Wnt/β-catenin signaling occurs in the absence of Edar signaling, we show that refinement of the pattern of Wnt/β-catenin activation is dependent on activity of the Edar pathway in primary placode induction. In the absence of NF-κB signaling, the borders of Wnt reporter-positive cell patches are irregular, and these patches sometimes appear to be fused, or occur in string-like shapes. Thus, consistent with previous suggestions ( Mou et al., 2006 ), NF-κB signaling plays a critical role in refining the pattern of hair placode borders. Our data, and those from another group ( Fliniaux et al., 2008 ), indicate that expression of the secreted Wnt inhibitor Dkk4 is regulated by NF-κB as well as by LEF/TCF/β-catenin, suggesting a possible mechanism by which NF-κB signaling indirectly limits Wnt activity and refines placode borders. Competition between short range or cell autonomous placode promoting signals (such as WNT10B and β-catenin) and longer range inhibitory signals (DKK4) acting downstream of initial irregular Wnt activation is consistent with a reaction-diffusion model for establishment of a regular array of placodes ( Sick et al., 2006 ).

Although initially activated, Wnt signaling and focal expression of Wnt10b and its close relative Wnt10a are not maintained in the skin in the absence of NF-κB signaling. Our data implicate Wnt10b as a potential direct target of the Edar pathway in primary placode induction, and suggest that NF-κB-dependent maintenance of Wnt10b and Wnt10a expression could explain in part the eventual disappearance of Wnt pathway activity in the absence of NF-κB signaling. Wnt10a and Wnt10b display overlapping expression in developing hair follicles, suggesting partial functional redundancy ( Reddy et al., 2001 ). Consistent with this, while the precise role of Wnt10b in hair follicle development is unclear, loss of function mutations in human WNT10A are associated with hair follicle defects but do not cause complete absence of hair follicle development ( Adaimy et al., 2007 ).

Unlike Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity, upregulated β-catenin-lacZ expression is maintained in Eda/Edar/NF-κB pathway mutants at E15.5. Patterned upregulation of β-catenin mRNA expression is absent in embryos with forced epithelial expression of the Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 , indicating that initiation of this transcriptional activity depends on Wnt signaling ( Andl et al., 2002 ). However, our results suggest that, once established, upregulated β-catenin transcription may occur independently of both Wnt and Edar signaling.

The Wnt/β-catenin and Edar pathways are activated and have important functions in tooth and sweat gland development, suggesting that similar interacting mechanisms to those described here may be relevant to the development of other ectodermal appendages. While β-catenin signaling plays a critical role in diverse skin cancers ( Malanchi et al., 2008 ; Yang et al., 2008 ), possible interactions of the Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB signaling pathways in these conditions have not been fully explored and would be an interesting subject for future studies.
