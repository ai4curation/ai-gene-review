Dysfunction of TMEM70 disrupts the biogenesis of ATP synthase and represents the 
frequent cause of autosomal recessive encephalocardiomyopathy. We used tagged 
forms of TMEM70 and demonstrated that it has a hairpin structure with the N- and 
C-termini oriented towards the mitochondrial matrix. On BN-PAGE TMEM70 was 
detected in multiple forms including dimers and displayed partial overlap with 
assembled ATP synthase. Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed mutual 
interactions between TMEM70 molecules but, together with immunogold electron 
microscopy, not direct interaction with ATP synthase subunits. This indicates 
that the biological function of TMEM70 in the ATP synthase biogenesis may be 
mediated through interaction with other protein(s).
