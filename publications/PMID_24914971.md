The death receptors Fas, p75(NTR) and DR6 are key components of extrinsically 
activated apoptosis. Characterization of how they interact with the adaptors is 
crucial in order to unravel the signalling mechanisms. However, the exact 
conformation that their intracellular death domain adopts upon binding 
downstream partners remains unclear. One model suggests that it adopts a typical 
compact fold, whilst a second model proposed an open conformation. Calmodulin 
(CaM), a major calcium sensor, has previously been reported to be one of the Fas 
adaptors that modulate apoptosis. This work reports that CaM also binds directly 
to the death domains of p75(NTR) and DR6, indicating that it serves as a common 
modulator of the death receptors. Two crystal structures of CaM in complexes 
with the corresponding binding regions of Fas and p75(NTR) are also reported. 
Interestingly, the precise CaM-binding sites were mapped to different regions: 
helix 1 in Fas and helix 5 in p75(NTR) and DR6. A novel 1-11 motif for CaM 
binding was observed in p75(NTR). Modelling the complexes of CaM with 
full-length receptors reveals that the opening of the death domains would be 
essential in order to expose their binding sites for CaM. These results may 
facilitate understanding of the diverse functional repertoire of death receptors 
and CaM and provide further insights necessary for the design of potential 
therapeutic peptide agents.
