Plants and animals use innate immunity as a first defense against pathogens, a 
costly yet necessary tradeoff between growth and immunity. In Arabidopsis, the 
regulatory leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) BAK1 combines with 
the LRR-RLKs FLS2 and EFR in pathogen-associated molecular pattern 
(PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and the LRR-RLK BRI1 in brassinosteroid 
(BR)-mediated growth. Therefore, a potential tradeoff between these pathways 
mediated by BAK1 is often postulated. Here, we show a unidirectional inhibition 
of FLS2-mediated immune signaling by BR perception. Unexpectedly, this effect 
occurred downstream or independently of complex formation with BAK1 and 
associated downstream phosphorylation. Thus, BAK1 is not rate-limiting in these 
pathways. BRs also inhibited signaling triggered by the BAK1-independent 
recognition of the fungal PAMP chitin. Our results suggest a general mechanism 
operative in plants in which BR-mediated growth directly antagonizes innate 
immune signaling.

Abstract

Plants and animals use innate immunity as a first defense against pathogens, a costly yet necessary tradeoff between growth and immunity. In Arabidopsis , the regulatory leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) BAK1 combines with the LRR-RLKs FLS2 and EFR in pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and the LRR-RLK BRI1 in brassinosteroid (BR)-mediated growth. Therefore, a potential tradeoff between these pathways mediated by BAK1 is often postulated. Here, we show a unidirectional inhibition of FLS2-mediated immune signaling by BR perception. Unexpectedly, this effect occurred downstream or independently of complex formation with BAK1 and associated downstream phosphorylation. Thus, BAK1 is not rate-limiting in these pathways. BRs also inhibited signaling triggered by the BAK1-independent recognition of the fungal PAMP chitin. Our results suggest a general mechanism operative in plants in which BR-mediated growth directly antagonizes innate immune signaling.

Conclusions

We have shown that activation of the BRI1 pathway leads to inhibition of PTI signaling mediated by several PRRs. This reveals a potential tradeoff between RLK-mediated growth and innate immunity in plants. BR perception in rice was shown to increase resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses ( 31 , 33 ). Consistently, BRs activate the expression of several immunity-related genes, including PR1 and AtMYB30 ( 33 , 41 ). Conversely, the BR-activated transcription factor BZR1 represses the promoters of several immune genes, including FLS2 ( 42 ). However, our observation that the FLS2 protein level is unaffected by epiBL treatment does not support this finding.

Because the LRR-RLK BAK1 serves in multiple signaling pathways ( 43 ), it was an attractive candidate to regulate tradeoff between immunity and growth already at receptor level. It is still unclear how this tradeoff is regulated. Here we have shown that the most likely scenario, in which BAK1 protein is present in rate-limiting amounts, cannot provide the explanation. Also, there is no direct effect of active PAMP signaling on the BR pathway, ruling out a bidirectional cross-talk mechanism as occurs between EGF and insulin signaling ( 44 ). Instead, an asymmetric mechanism operating downstream or independently of the common component BAK1 modulates early immune signaling mediated by PAMP recognition. Although BAK1 has been proposed to mediate interplay between BR and PAMP signaling ( 12 ), we provided evidence that the growth-inhibiting effect of PAMP perception does not operate through antagonism of BR signaling. Our experiments suggest that different pools of BAK1 exist that are not freely interchangeable. BAK1 recruited by FLS2 seems to be different from that recruited by BRI1, as BL did not displace the amount of BAK1 immunoprecipitated with FLS2. Alternatively, this could be explained by the fact that more BAK1 is recruited into FLS2 complexes than into the BRI1 complex, or that the complexes are more stable. This idea is corroborated by the observed weak impact of BAK1 loss-of-function mutations on BR sensitivity ( 4 , 5 , 23 ), whereas BAK1 plays a more important role in FLS2 signaling ( 11 , 12 , 24 ), and by the finding that the role of BAK1 in BR and PTI signaling can be mechanistically uncoupled ( 24 ).

Tradeoffs between endogenous hormonal pathways and responses to exogenous cues have been proposed previously. For example, the nuclear growth-repressing DELLA proteins negatively regulate gibberellic acid (GA) signaling, but are important to mediate the balance between the immune hormones salicylic acid and jasmonic acid in response to biotic and abiotic stresses ( 45 â€“ 48 ). Also, auxin and salicylic acid signaling antagonize each other ( 49 , 50 ). Notably, flg22 perception inhibits auxin signaling by inducing the expression of the microRNA miR393 that targets auxin receptors to increase disease resistance to biotrophic pathogens ( 49 ). Similarly, flg22 perception dampens GA signaling by stabilizing DELLA proteins that are negative regulators of this pathway ( 47 ). Given the important role of endogenous hormones in modulating plant defense, several pathogens produce GA or auxin as potential virulence strategies ( 51 ). Interestingly, the obligate biotrophic oomycete Albugo laibachii appears to encode a complete BR biosynthesis pathway ( 52 ). Together with our results, this leads to the tentative hypothesis that BR production may contribute to the ability of this pathogen to suppress plant immunity. On the plant side, recent work shows that enhanced BR signaling as observed in gain-of-function mutations in BAK1 ( 27 ) and in BRI1 ( 28 ), both impair responses to flagellin, supporting this idea.

Therefore, BR signaling may play an important role in the modulation of plant immunity during plant growth, by regulating immune signaling downstream of BIK1, and is a potential site of manipulation by pathogens during infection.
