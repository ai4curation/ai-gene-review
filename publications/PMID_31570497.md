Novel tick-borne phleboviruses in the Phenuiviridae family, which are highly 
pathogenic in humans and all closely related to Uukuniemi virus (UUKV), have 
recently emerged on different continents. How phleboviruses assemble, bud, and 
exit cells remains largely elusive. Here, we performed high-resolution, 
label-free mass spectrometry analysis of UUKV immunoprecipitated from cell 
lysates and identified 39 cellular partners interacting with the viral envelope 
glycoproteins. The importance of these host factors for UUKV infection was 
validated by silencing each host factor by RNA interference. This revealed 
Golgi-specific brefeldin A-resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 
(GBF1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor resident in the Golgi, as a 
critical host factor required for the UUKV life cycle. An inhibitor of GBF1, 
Golgicide A, confirmed the role of the cellular factor in UUKV infection. We 
could pinpoint the GBF1 requirement to UUKV replication and particle assembly. 
When the investigation was extended to viruses from various positive and 
negative RNA viral families, we found that not only phleboviruses rely on GBF1 
for infection, but also Flavi-, Corona-, Rhabdo-, and Togaviridae In contrast, 
silencing or blocking GBF1 did not abrogate infection by the human adenovirus 
serotype 5 and immunodeficiency retrovirus type 1, the replication of both 
requires nuclear steps. Together our results indicate that UUKV relies on GBF1 
for viral replication, assembly and egress. This study also highlights the 
proviral activity of GBF1 in the infection by a broad range of important 
zoonotic RNA viruses.
