The Kcnq1 imprinted domain encodes a paternally expressed noncoding RNA Kcnq1ot1 
and several paternally repressed protein-coding genes. Transcriptional 
regulation is controlled by the Kcnq1ot1 gene whose maternal germline 
methylation imprint overlaps with the Kcnq1ot1 promoter. The domain can be 
divided into two groups of genes. One group is imprinted in all lineages and is 
reliant on DNA methylation for its imprinting. The other group contains genes 
that are imprinted specifically in the placenta and retain their imprinting in 
the absence of Dnmt1, the primary DNA maintenance methylase. In the placenta 
paternal Kcnq1ot1 expression is associated with the acquisition of repressive 
histone modifications throughout the domain. Using the Dnmt1o knockout, we have 
analyzed the effect of removing DNA maintenance methylation at the eight-cell 
stage on the Kcnq1 imprinted domain. In the placenta the expression of the 
normally silent maternal Kcnq1ot1 allele leads to reduced expression of the 
surrounding maternally expressed genes. This repression is seen in both the 
placental-specific imprinted genes and the ubiquitously imprinted genes. 
Conversely, reduction of functional Dnmt1 results solely in reduced expression 
of the ubiquitously imprinted genes in the placenta. This suggests that Kcnq1ot1 
expression can epigenetically silence placentally imprinted genes in the cluster 
only during a specific developmental window. This highlights the possibility 
that Kcnq1ot1-mediated repression is temporally regulated leading to epigenetic 
silencing of placental-specific genes. We show that allele-specific histone 
modifications are still present in the Dnmt1 ( -/- ) trophoblast at 
placental-specific imprinted loci and are likely responsible for maintaining the 
imprinting of these genes in the absence of DNA methylation.
