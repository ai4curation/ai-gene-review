Oxidative stress plays an important role in the progression of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative conditions. Glutathione (GSH), the 
major antioxidant in the central nervous system, is primarily synthesized and 
released by astrocytes. We determined if β-amyloid (Aβ42), crucially involved in 
Alzheimer's disease, affected GSH release. Monomeric Aβ (mAβ) stimulated GSH 
release from cultured cortical astrocytes more effectively than oligomeric Aβ 
(oAβ) or fibrillary Aβ (fAβ). Monomeric Aβ increased the expression of the 
transporter ABCC1 (also referred to as MRP1) that is the main pathway for GSH 
release. GSH release from astrocytes, with or without mAβ stimulation, was 
reduced by pharmacological inhibition of ABCC1. Astrocytes robustly express 
connexin proteins, especially connexin43 (Cx43), and mAβ also stimulated Cx43 
hemichannel-mediated glutamate and GSH release. Aβ-stimulation facilitated 
hemichannel opening in the presence of normal extracellular calcium by reducing 
astrocyte cholesterol level. Aβ treatment did not alter the intracellular 
concentration of reduced or oxidized glutathione. Using a mouse model of AD with 
early onset Aβ deposition (5xFAD), we found that cortical ABCC1 was 
significantly increased in temporal register with the surge of Aβ levels in 
these mice. ABCC1 levels remained elevated from 1.5 to 3.5 months of age in 
5xFAD mice, before plunging to subcontrol levels when amyloid plaques appeared. 
Similarly, in cultured astrocytes, prolonged incubation with aggregated Aβ, but 
not mAβ, reduced induction of ABCC1 expression. These results support the 
hypothesis that in the early stage of AD pathogenesis, less aggregated Aβ 
increases GSH release from astrocytes (via ABCC1 transporters and Cx43 
hemichannels) providing temporary protection from oxidative stress which 
promotes AD development.
