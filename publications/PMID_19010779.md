The Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is a disorder affecting endosome sorting. Disease 
is triggered by defects in any of 15 mouse gene products, which are part of five 
distinct cytosolic molecular complexes: AP-3, homotypic fusion and vacuole 
protein sorting, and BLOC-1, -2, and -3. To identify molecular associations of 
these complexes, we used in vivo cross-linking followed by purification of 
cross-linked AP-3 complexes and mass spectrometric identification of associated 
proteins. AP-3 was co-isolated with BLOC-1, BLOC-2, and homotypic fusion and 
vacuole protein sorting complex subunits; clathrin; and 
phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase type II alpha (PI4KIIalpha). We previously 
reported that this membrane-anchored enzyme is a regulator of AP-3 recruitment 
to membranes and a cargo of AP-3 ( Craige, B., Salazar, G., and Faundez, V. 
(2008) Mol. Biol. Cell 19, 1415-1426 ). Using cells deficient in different 
Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome complexes, we identified that BLOC-1, but not BLOC-2 
or BLOC-3, deficiencies affect PI4KIIalpha inclusion into AP-3 complexes. 
BLOC-1, PI4KIIalpha, and AP-3 belong to a tripartite complex, and 
down-regulation of either PI4KIIalpha, BLOC-1, or AP-3 complexes led to similar 
LAMP1 phenotypes. Our analysis indicates that BLOC-1 complex modulates the 
association of PI4KIIalpha with AP-3. These results suggest that AP-3 and BLOC-1 
act, either in concert or sequentially, to specify sorting of PI4KIIalpha along 
the endocytic route.
