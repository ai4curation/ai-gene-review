In order to elucidate the role of neuromodulator endothelin-1 (ET-1) in 
cerebellar degeneration we determined ET-1 receptor binding in the control and 
lurcher mice cerebella at different postnatal (P) ages. The lurcher mutant is a 
suggested animal model for human cerebellar ataxias. The cerebellar membranes 
were prepared from 5 to 20 day old lurcher mice and littermate controls. ET-1 
receptor binding was determined using radioligand assay and affinity 
cross-linking. There was a significant decrease in [125I]ET-1 receptor binding 
with increasing postnatal age in the control and lurcher mice cerebella. Lurcher 
mice showed a significant increase in [125I]ET-1 receptor binding at P 9 to P 20 
as compared with the controls. Whereas, at P5 to P7 no significant change was 
observed. By autoradiography, ET-1 receptors were localized in tile granule cell 
layer of 15 day old control and lurcher mice cerebella. Whereas, the lUrcher 
mice showed an increase in [125I]ET-1 binding in the cerebellum as compared with 
the littermate controls. The results of the present study suggest that the 
increase in ET-1 receptor binding as early as P9 (when neuronal loss is minimal) 
in the lurcher mutant may reflect upregulation of ET-1 receptors in the 
degenerating neurons. At P 15 to P 20, when about 50% to 75% neurons are lost 
respectively, these changes may also reflect astrogliosis.
