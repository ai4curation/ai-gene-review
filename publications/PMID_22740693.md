We have reported that hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP) promotes the 
proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. However, the underlying 
mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we report that HBXIP works in the 
event through up-regulating S100A4. We observed that HBXIP expression was 
positively correlated to that of S100A4 in 87 clinical breast cancer tissue 
samples. Then, we identified that HBXIP was able to up-regulate S100A4 
expression in breast cancer cells. Notably, we observed the HBXIP nuclear 
localization, implying that HBXIP may be associated with the promoter of S100A4. 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift 
assay (EMSA) showed that HBXIP was able to bind to the nucleotides +200~+239 
region of S100A4 promoter, containing two putative recognition motif of 
transcription factor STAT4 and GRβ. It suggests that HBXIP is able to activate 
S100A4 promoter via interacting with STAT4 in breast cancer cells, leading to 
the up-regulation of S100A4. In addition, we identified another pathway of 
S100A4 up-regulation mediated by HBXIP. We found that HBXIP activated the 
PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling by inducing DNA methylation of PTEN, which subsequently 
boosted S100A4 expression. In function, we demonstrated that HBXIP enhanced the 
growth or migration of breast cancer cells through S100A4 in vivo and in vitro. 
Collectively, we conclude that HBXIP up-regulates S100A4 through activating 
S100A4 promoter involving STAT4 and inducing PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling to promote 
growth and migration of breast cancer cells. Our finding provides new insight 
into the mechanism of HBXIP in promotion of the development of breast cancer.
