BACKGROUND INFORMATION: MYG1 [Melanocyte proliferating gene 1, also known as 
Gamm1 (NM_021640)] is a recently described gene of unknown function. MYG1 
orthologues are found in simple as well as complex eukaryotes. According to 
sequence homology, MYG1 is considered to have a metal-dependent protein 
hydrolase (UPF0160) domain. The purpose of the present study was to determine 
the expression and subcellular localization of MYG1 protein and to identify 
physiological processes connected to MYG1 function.
RESULTS: Human and mouse MYG1 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest level 
in the testis. Analysis of mouse embryos moreover revealed a uniform Myg1 
expression at E (embryonic day) 8.5, but at E11.75 expression becomes restricted 
predominantly to the developing brain and eye, limb buds and tail region. MYG1 
exhibits a mitochondrial targeting signal in the N-terminal region and a 
Pat7-type nuclear localization signal in the region between amino acids 33-39 
and localizes to these compartments. No active shuttling of MYG1 between the 
nucleus and the mitochondria was detected and the distribution of MYG1 was not 
dependent on the phase of the cell cycle. Immunoprecipitation of C-terminally 
FLAG-tagged MYG1 from HeLa cells did not identify any co-precipitated proteins. 
siRNA (short interfering RNA)-mediated knockdown of MYG1 mRNA was mainly 
followed by changes in the level of transcripts encoding factors involved in 
developmental tissue patterning and growth as well as immune-related processes.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we infer that MYG1 is a ubiquitous 
nucleo-mitochondrial protein, with differential pattern and level of expression 
during embryonic development. MYG1 expression in normal adult tissues is stable 
and our data suggest MYG1 involvement in early developmental processes and also 
in adult stress/illness conditions.
