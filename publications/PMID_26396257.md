The rod shape of most bacteria requires the actin homolog, MreB. Whereas MreB 
was initially thought to statically define rod shape, recent studies found that 
MreB dynamically rotates around the cell circumference dependent on cell wall 
synthesis. However, the mechanism by which cytoplasmic MreB is linked to 
extracytoplasmic cell wall synthesis and the function of this linkage for 
morphogenesis has remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that the transmembrane 
protein RodZ mediates MreB rotation by directly or indirectly coupling MreB to 
cell wall synthesis enzymes. Furthermore, we map the RodZ domains that link MreB 
to cell wall synthesis and identify mreB mutants that suppress the shape defect 
of ΔrodZ without restoring rotation, uncoupling rotation from rod-like growth. 
Surprisingly, MreB rotation is dispensable for rod-like shape determination 
under standard laboratory conditions but is required for the robustness of rod 
shape and growth under conditions of cell wall stress.
