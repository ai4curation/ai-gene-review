Beta-arrestins are cytosolic proteins that form complexes with 
seven-transmembrane receptors after agonist stimulation and phosphorylation by 
the G protein-coupled receptor kinases. They play an essential role in receptor 
desensitization and endocytosis, and they also serve as receptor-regulated 
signaling scaffolds and adaptors. Moreover, in the past decade, a growing list 
of protein-protein interactions of beta-arrestins pertinent to these functions 
has been documented. The discovery of several novel functions of beta-arrestins 
stimulated us to perform a global proteomics analysis of 
beta-arrestin-interacting proteins (interactome) as modulated by a model 
seven-transmembrane receptor, the angiotensin II type 1a receptor, in an attempt 
to assess the full range of functions of these versatile molecules. As 
determined by LC tandem MS, 71 proteins interacted with beta-arrestin 1, 164 
interacted with beta-arrestin 2, and 102 interacted with both beta-arrestins. 
Some proteins bound only after agonist stimulation, whereas others dissociated. 
Bioinformatics analysis of the data indicates that proteins involved in cellular 
signaling, organization, and nucleic acid binding are the most highly 
represented in the beta-arrestin interactome. Surprisingly, both S-arrestin 
(visual arrestin) and X-arrestin (cone arrestin) were also found in heteromeric 
complex with beta-arrestins. The beta-arrestin interactors distribute not only 
in the cytoplasm, but also in the nucleus as well as other subcellular 
compartments. The binding of 16 randomly selected newly identified beta-arrestin 
partners was validated by coimmunoprecipitation assays in HEK293 cells. This 
study provides a comprehensive analysis of proteins that bind beta-arrestin 
isoforms and underscores their potentially broad regulatory roles in mammalian 
cellular physiology.
