Paternal mitochondria are eliminated following fertilization by selective 
autophagy, but the mechanisms that restrict this process to sperm-derived 
organelles are not well understood. FUNDC1 (FUN14 domain containing 1) is a 
mammalian mitophagy receptor expressed on the mitochondrial outer membrane that 
contributes to mitochondrial quality control following hypoxic stress. Like 
FUNDC1, the C. elegans ortholog FNDC-1 is widely expressed in somatic tissues 
and mediates hypoxic mitophagy. Here, we report that FNDC-1 is strongly 
expressed in sperm but not oocytes and contributes to paternal mitochondria 
elimination. Paternal mitochondrial DNA is normally undetectable in wildtype 
larva, but can be detected in the cross-progeny of fndc-1 mutant males. 
Moreover, loss of fndc-1 retards the rate of paternal mitochondria degradation, 
but not that of membranous organelles, a nematode specific membrane compartment 
whose fusion is required for sperm motility. This is the first example of a 
ubiquitin-independent mitophagy receptor playing a role in the selective 
degradation of sperm mitochondria.
