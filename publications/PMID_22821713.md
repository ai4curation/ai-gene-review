Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most prevalent human birth defects. More 
than 85% of CHDs are thought to result from a combination of genetic 
susceptibilities and environmental stress. However, the stress-related 
signalling pathways involved remain largely unknown. The p53 transcription 
factor is a key tumour suppressor and a central regulator of the cellular stress 
responses. p53 activities are tightly regulated by its inhibitors Mdm2 and Mdm4 
at the post-translational level. Here we used the Cre-loxP system to delete Mdm2 
(Tie2Cre;Mdm2(FM/FM) ) or one copy of both Mdm2 and Mdm4 (Tie2Cre;Mdm2(FM/+) ; 
Mdm4(+/-) ) in endothelial/endocardial cells and their derivatives in mice to 
examine the regulation of the p53/Mdm2-Mdm4 pathway during vascular and 
cardiovascular development. The Tie2Cre;Mdm2(FM/FM) mice died before embryonic 
day 10.5 (E10.5) and displayed severe vascular defects. On the other hand, the 
Tie2Cre;Mdm2(FM/+) ; Mdm4(+/-) mice displayed atrial and ventricular septal 
defects (ASD, VSD) of the heart, leading to severe heart dysfunction and 
postnatal death. During cardiac endocardial cushion morphogenesis, p53 
activation was associated with defects in both the epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) of the endocardial cells and the post-EMT proliferation of the 
mesenchymal cells, and the valvuloseptal phenotypes of the Tie2Cre;Mdm2(FM/+) ; 
Mdm4(+/-) mice were fully rescued by deletion of one copy of p53. Strikingly, 
maternal exposure to low-dose X-rays in C57BL/6 mice mimicked the congenital 
heart malformations seen in the Tie2Cre;Mdm2(FM/+) ; Mdm4(+/-) model, which was 
also dependent on p53 status, establishing a link between maternal exposures and 
CHD susceptibility through the p53 pathway. These data revealed a new regulatory 
mechanism in cardiac endocardial cushion morphogenesis and suggested a possible 
cause of CHDs due to environmental stress.
