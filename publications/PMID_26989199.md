Steroids regulate cell proliferation, tissue development, and cell signaling via 
two pathways: a nuclear receptor mechanism and genome-independent signaling. 
Sperm activation, egg maturation, and steroid-induced anesthesia are executed 
via the latter pathway, the key components of which remain unknown. Here, we 
present characterization of the human sperm progesterone receptor that is 
conveyed by the orphan enzyme α/β hydrolase domain-containing protein 2 (ABHD2). 
We show that ABHD2 is highly expressed in spermatozoa, binds progesterone, and 
acts as a progesterone-dependent lipid hydrolase by depleting the 
endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2AG) from plasma membrane. The 2AG 
inhibits the sperm calcium channel (CatSper), and its removal leads to calcium 
influx via CatSper and ensures sperm activation. This study reveals that 
progesterone-activated endocannabinoid depletion by ABHD2 is a general mechanism 
by which progesterone exerts its genome-independent action and primes sperm for 
fertilization.
