In Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations that reduce the activity of an insulin-like 
receptor (daf-2) or a phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (age-1) favour entry into 
the dauer state during larval development and extend lifespan in adults. 
Downregulation of this pathway activates a forkhead transcription factor 
(daf-16), which may regulate targets that promote dauer formation in larvae and 
stress resistance and longevity in adults. In yeast, the SIR2 gene determines 
the lifespan of mother cells, and adding an extra copy of SIR2 extends lifespan. 
Sir2 mediates chromatin silencing through a histone deacetylase activity that 
depends on NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) as a cofactor. We have 
surveyed the lifespan of C. elegans strains containing duplications of 
chromosomal regions. Here we report that a duplication containing sir-2.1-the C. 
elegans gene most homologous to yeast SIR2-confers a lifespan that is extended 
by up to 50%. Genetic analysis indicates that the sir-2.1 transgene functions 
upstream of daf-16 in the insulin-like signalling pathway. Our findings suggest 
that Sir2 proteins may couple longevity to nutrient availability in many 
eukaryotic organisms.
