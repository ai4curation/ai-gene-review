The circadian clock-associated 1 (CCA1) gene encodes a Myb-related transcription 
factor that has been shown to be involved in the phytochrome regulation of 
Lhcb1*3 gene expression and in the function of the circadian oscillator in 
Arabidopsis thaliana. By using a yeast interaction screen to identify proteins 
that interact with CCA1, we have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a regulatory 
(beta) subunit of the protein kinase CK2 and have designated it as CKB3. CKB3 is 
the only reported example of a third beta-subunit of CK2 found in any organism. 
CKB3 interacts specifically with CCA1 both in a yeast two-hybrid system and in 
an in vitro interaction assay. Other subunits of CK2 also show an interaction 
with CCA1 in vitro. CK2 beta-subunits stimulate binding of CCA1 to the CCA1 
binding site on the Lhcb1*3 gene promoter, and recombinant CK2 is able to 
phosphorylate CCA1 in vitro. Furthermore, Arabidopsis plant extracts contain a 
CK2-like activity that affects the formation of a DNA-protein complex containing 
CCA1. These results suggest that CK2 can modulate CCA1 activity both by direct 
interaction and by phosphorylation of the CCA1 protein and that CK2 may play a 
role in the function of CCA1 in vivo.

Abstract

The circadian clock-associated 1 (CCA1) gene encodes a Myb-related transcription factor that has been shown to be involved in the phytochrome regulation of Lhcb1*3 gene expression and in the function of the circadian oscillator in Arabidopsis thaliana . By using a yeast interaction screen to identify proteins that interact with CCA1, we have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a regulatory (β) subunit of the protein kinase CK2 and have designated it as CKB3 . CKB3 is the only reported example of a third β-subunit of CK2 found in any organism. CKB3 interacts specifically with CCA1 both in a yeast two-hybrid system and in an in vitro interaction assay. Other subunits of CK2 also show an interaction with CCA1 in vitro . CK2 β-subunits stimulate binding of CCA1 to the CCA1 binding site on the Lhcb1*3 gene promoter, and recombinant CK2 is able to phosphorylate CCA1 in vitro . Furthermore, Arabidopsis plant extracts contain a CK2-like activity that affects the formation of a DNA–protein complex containing CCA1. These results suggest that CK2 can modulate CCA1 activity both by direct interaction and by phosphorylation of the CCA1 protein and that CK2 may play a role in the function of CCA1 in vivo .

DISCUSSION

The protein kinase CK2 is a Ser/Thr kinase that is expressed ubiquitously and highly conserved ( 17 – 19 ). CK2 consists of two catalytic (α) and two regulatory (β) subunits, which form an α 2 β 2 heteromeric holoenzyme. Although most organisms have two genes encoding α-subunits and one gene encoding the β-subunit, two genes encoding β-subunits have been reported in S. cerevisiae and Arabidopsis ( 9 , 13 , 22 ). The CKB3 protein exhibits significant amino acid sequence identity with Arabidopsis CKB1 and CKB2. Two lines of evidence confirm that CKB3 does indeed function as a third CK2 β-subunit in Arabidopsis . First, CKB3 was able to compensate for the temperature-sensitive growth defect of an S. cerevisiae cka1-Δ1 cka2–8 mutation. Second, recombinant CKB3 was able to stimulate the catalytic activity of CKA1 when CCA1 was used as a substrate. CKB3 is the only reported example of a third CK2 β-subunit in any organism. Of interest, it had been suggested previously that there might be a third CK2 α-subunit in Arabidopsis ( 12 ). It is yet to be determined whether there are several forms of the holoenzyme with different subunit compositions or whether different subunits confer different substrate specificities and/or tissue specificities.

We have shown that CK2 β-subunits specifically interact with CCA1 both in yeast and in an in vitro interaction assay. We did not isolate clones for the two other CK2 β-subunits in the initial screen, but we have observed that the growth of yeast containing the constructs for these subunits is slower than that of cells expressing the GAL4-AD-CKB3 construct, and this may account for our failure to identify them along with CKB3.

We have found that recombinant His-tagged CK2 β-subunits stimulate binding of CCA1 to a fragment of the Lhcb1*3 gene. This effect is likely to be specific because OBP1, a DNA binding protein that stimulates interaction of OBF4 and OBF5 with ocs elements, did not affect binding of CCA1 to the A2 fragment ( 23 ). Also, both recombinant GST-CKB1 and GST-CKB3 stimulated DNA binding of CCA1, whereas GST alone had no effect (S.S. and E.M.T., unpublished data), demonstrating that CK2 β-subunits are responsible for the enhancement. The fact that the mobility of the complex was not affected suggests that the interaction of the proteins might be transient or unstable under the conditions for the EMSA. There have been other such reports of enhancement of DNA binding by a second protein without altering the mobility of the DNA–protein complex ( 23 – 26 ).

The fact that CK2 β-subunits associate with CCA1 and stimulate its binding to the Lhcb1*3 promoter suggests a different mechanism for regulation of CCA1–DNA binding activity other than phosphorylation. In fact, the α-subunit is not required for this stimulation, and CK2 β-subunits cannot themselves phosphorylate CCA1. It is possible that, in addition to being the regulatory subunit of CK2, the β-subunit might play other roles in the cell. Overexpression of the CK2 β-subunit in Schizosaccharomyces pombe causes multiple septation and inhibits cell growth and cytokinesis ( 27 ). These phenotypes appear to result from the production of free β-subunit rather than excess holoenzyme. In Xenopus oocytes, the β-subunit interacts with Mos, a germ cell-specific Ser/Thr kinase that is required for oocyte maturation, and this interaction negatively regulates Mos-mediated, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, resulting in repression of oocyte maturation ( 28 , 29 ). Recently, it also was shown that cyclin D, which is a regulatory component of complexes of cyclin with cyclin-dependent kinase, stimulates transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor independent of interaction with cyclin-dependent kinases ( 30 ). Therefore, it is intriguing to speculate that direct interaction of CK2 β-subunits with CCA1 stimulates binding of CCA1 to promoter sequences and can affect CCA1-mediated transcription.

We have demonstrated that CKA1 phosphorylates CCA1 in vitro and that both CKB1 and CKB3 stimulate this phosphorylation. Although CKA1CKB1 showed a higher activity of CCA1 phosphorylation than did CKA1CKB3, the possibility that this difference was caused by differing relative activities of CKB1 and CKB3 in their corresponding preparations cannot be excluded. We have demonstrated also that Arabidopsis plants contain a CK2-like protein kinase activity that can phosphorylate CCA1 in vitro and that this is a major kinase activity for CCA1 phosphorylation in the extracts. The identity of this kinase was confirmed in two ways. First, the kinase activity phosphorylated CCA1 in the presence of GTP as well as ATP, a unique characteristic that distinguishes CK2 from other Ser/Thr kinases. Second, addition of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, an inhibitor of CK2, inhibited most of the CCA1 phosphorylating activity in the plant extracts.

Phosphorylation of transcription factors by CK2 has been reported to modulate their DNA binding activity, cellular localization, metabolism, and interaction with other proteins ( 19 , 31 – 37 ). It was shown recently that the Lhcb1*1 RNA level in transgenic plants overexpressing CCA1 decreased steadily when plants were transferred from light–dark cycles into constant dark, even though CCA1 was expressed at a high level ( 7 ). We also have observed that the Lhcb1*1 RNA level in etiolated transgenic plants overexpressing CCA1 was as low as that in etiolated wild-type plants (Z.-Y.W. and E.M.T., unpublished data). These observations suggest that CCA1 activity is regulated by light through posttranslational modifications, one of which could be phosphorylation. In this regard, our finding that plant extracts contain a CK2-like activity that is required for formation of the major DNA–protein complex containing CCA1 is especially noteworthy. The CCA1-containing complex is likely to contain a protein or proteins in addition to CCA1 (see Results ). Although CK2 phosphorylation of recombinant CCA1 did not affect its DNA binding activity in vitro , it is possible that, in the plants, the other proteins affect the relative binding affinities of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of CCA1 for CCA1 binding sites. Alternatively, the phosphorylation state of CCA1 might be important for protein–protein interactions of CCA1 with other protein(s) in the complex. It is also possible that phosphorylation of other protein(s) by CK2 is essential for the CCA1 complex formation.

In summary, interaction of subunits of CK2 with CCA1 and phosphorylation of CCA1 by CK2 may modulate CCA1 activities that are required for phytochrome regulation of Lhcb1*3 gene expression and for circadian clock function. In light of the involvement of CCA1 in circadian rhythms ( 7 ), it is of particular interest that the clock gene affected in the double-time mutant of Drosophila, which is required for circadian rhythmicity, recently has been cloned and has been found to be closely related to human casein kinase Iɛ ( 38 ). Whereas the physiological significance of the CK2-CCA1 association remains to be elucidated, our findings should be important steps toward understanding the regulation of CCA1 function in Arabidopsis .
