Cholesterol synthesis in animals is controlled by the regulated transport of 
sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) from the endoplasmic 
reticulum to the Golgi, where the transcription factors are processed 
proteolytically to release active fragments. Transport is inhibited by either 
cholesterol or oxysterols, blocking cholesterol synthesis. Cholesterol acts by 
binding to the SREBP-escort protein Scap, thereby causing Scap to bind to anchor 
proteins called Insigs. Here, we show that oxysterols act by binding to Insigs, 
causing Insigs to bind to Scap. Mutational analysis of the six transmembrane 
helices of Insigs reveals that the third and fourth are important for Insig's 
binding to oxysterols and to Scap. These studies define Insigs as 
oxysterol-binding proteins, explaining the long-known ability of oxysterols to 
inhibit cholesterol synthesis in animal cells.

Abstract

Cholesterol synthesis in animals is controlled by the regulated transport of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where the transcription factors are processed proteolytically to release active fragments. Transport is inhibited by either cholesterol or oxysterols, blocking cholesterol synthesis. Cholesterol acts by binding to the SREBP-escort protein Scap, thereby causing Scap to bind to anchor proteins called Insigs. Here, we show that oxysterols act by binding to Insigs, causing Insigs to bind to Scap. Mutational analysis of the six transmembrane helices of Insigs reveals that the third and fourth are important for Insig's binding to oxysterols and to Scap. These studies define Insigs as oxysterol-binding proteins, explaining the long-known ability of oxysterols to inhibit cholesterol synthesis in animal cells.

Discussion

The current experiments define Insig-2 as a membrane-bound oxysterol-binding protein with specificity for cholesterol derivatives that possess hydroxyl groups on the side chain. This finding appears to unravel the conundrum raised by previous studies showing that oxysterols could block SREBP cleavage by promoting Scap/Insig binding, and yet oxysterols did not bind to Scap ( 20 , 21 ). Instead, the data now show that oxysterols bind to Insigs. Inasmuch as we were unable to purify human Insig-1 in a stable form, all of the current experiments were conducted with human Insig-2. However, we believe that the conclusions apply equally to human Insig-1, whose membrane domain is 85% identical to that of human Insig-2 ( 26 , 30 ). Previous studies have shown that 25-HC indeed induces the binding of Insig-1 to Scap ( 20 ). Moreover, each of the five amino acids that we show to be crucial for Insig-2 function are conserved in both Insig-1 and Insig-2 from nine vertebrate species, including lamprey, puffer fish, and zebrafish. One of these residues (D149 in Insig-2) is equivalent to D205 in Insig-1. Previous studies showed that D205 of Insig-1 is crucial for its function in blocking SREBP processing ( 34 ).

The reciprocity between the sterol-binding properties of Scap and Insig-2 is striking ( Figs. 2 and 3 ). Scap recognizes the tetracyclic steroid nucleus and the 3β-hydroxyl group of cholesterol. It binds the sterol equally well even when it lacks a side chain. However, Scap does not bind a sterol that contains a polar group such as a hydroxyl group on the side chain. In contrast, Insig-2 binding absolutely requires the sterol side chain with a hydroxyl group that can be located at positions 22, 24, 25, or 27. Insig-2 binding also requires the steroid nucleus, as evidenced by the observation that binding of [ 3 H]25-HC was not inhibited by mimics of the oxygenated iso-octyl side chain of 25-HC, such as 2-octanol and 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol (data not shown). The contrasts between the binding properties of Scap and Insig-2 suggest that Scap may recognize cholesterol in its usual orientation in the membrane, i.e., when its 3β-hydroxyl is exposed at the surface and its side chain is buried in the hydrophobic bilayer. It is likely that a hydroxylated side chain would prevent such membrane insertion ( 35 , 36 ), and hence Insig-2 would more likely recognize a sterol that lies on the surface of a membrane with its hydroxylated side chain exposed. It is unlikely that Insig-2 binds directly to the hydroxylated side chain because the hydroxyl group can be on any one of several different positions. Rather, it may be that the hydroxyl group orients the sterol in relation to the lipid bilayer so that Insig-2 can recognize it. It is also possible that Insig-2 interacts indirectly with the hydroxyl group on an oxysterol through water-mediated interactions as in the case of Osh4, a yeast oxysterol-binding protein whose crystal structures has been determined with bound ligand ( 37 ). Whatever the mechanism of binding, it is noteworthy that all sterols that completely inhibit SREBP processing bind to either Scap or Insig, but not to both ( Fig. 3 B ).

One caveat to the current studies is the low stoichiometry of 25-HC binding to Insig-2 in the in vitro binding assay. Gel filtration suggests that purified Insig-2 exists as a dimer in Fos–Choline 13 micelles. At saturation, we calculated that one 25-HC molecule was bound for every 40 dimers. It is likely that this inefficiency relates to the physical configuration of the Insig-2 protein in the micelles. This configuration only partially approximates the configuration of Insig-2 in a planar lipid bilayer. We also noted that detergent-solubilized Insig-2 was stable for only a few days. Thereafter, the binding activity declined even further. So far, experiments designed to reconstitute Insig-2 into lipid bilayers have failed, but efforts to overcome this obstacle are being pursued.

The alanine-scanning mutagenesis studies reveal that the third and fourth membrane spanning helices of Insig-2 play a role in 25-HC binding as well as Scap binding. Two mutations in these helices (F115A and T136A) reduced the amount of [ 3 H]25-HC binding ( Fig. 5 ). Interestingly, the reduction occurred in B max without an apparent change in affinity. This raises the possibility that these two mutations alter the configuration of Insig-2 in the micelle so that fewer binding sites are exposed. These mutations also reduced the ability of Insig-2 to bind to Scap, even when Scap was induced to assume its binding-competent configuration through the binding of cholesterol ( Fig. 7 ). Other mutations in the fourth membrane spanning helix reduced the ability of Insig to bind to Scap without reducing its ability to bind to 25-HC. As expected, all of these mutations impaired the ability of both cholesterol and 25-HC to block SREBP-2 cleavage in intact cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the third and fourth membrane helices of Insig-2 play a primary role in Insig binding to Scap and a lesser role in its binding to 25-HC.

Insig proteins also bind in a sterol-dependent manner to HMGR, the rate-limiting enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway ( 38 ). Formation of the HMGR·Insig complex leads to ubiquitination and degradation of HMGR, whereas formation of the Scap·Insig complex leads to ER retention of SREBP ( 3 ). There is partially overlapping sterol specificity for HMGR·Insig and Scap·Insig complex formation. Oxysterols (such as 25-HC) can induce formation of both HMGR·Insig and Scap·Insig complexes. Cholesterol, which binds to Scap and induces Scap·Insig complex formation, has no effect on HMGR·Insig complex formation ( 27 ). On the other hand, lanosterol (a cholesterol precursor) can stimulate formation of HMGR·Insig complex ( 27 ), although it has no effect on Scap·Insig complex formation as inferred from its inability to produce a conformational change in Scap ( 22 ) and its inability to block SREBP processing ( 27 ). Based on the current studies, it is tempting to speculate that the oxysterol-bound form of Insig (the common denominator to both systems) can form a complex with HMGR just as it can with Scap, whereas lanosterol acts by binding to HMGR much like cholesterol binds directly to Scap. It is possible that Insig, upon activation by oxysterol, can bind other proteins as well.

In an accompanying paper, we show that the conformational change in Scap is similar whether it is elicited when Scap binds to cholesterol or when Scap binds to the Insig·25-HC complex ( 23 ). In both cases, this conformational change precludes the binding of COPII proteins to Scap, and this appears to explain the inhibition of Scap · SREBP transport from ER to Golgi. Thus, vertebrate cells have two sterol sensors for the SREBP pathway, Scap and Insig, which together enable them to turn off cholesterol synthesis in response to the buildup of either cholesterol or its hydroxylated derivatives.
