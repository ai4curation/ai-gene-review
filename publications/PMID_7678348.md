The delayed implantation model was used to study epidermal growth factor 
receptor(s) (EGF-R) in the mouse blastocyst. Delayed implantation and blastocyst 
dormancy were induced by ovariectomy on day 4 of pregnancy and were maintained 
by daily (days 5-7) injections of progesterone (P4). Blastocyst activation and 
implantation were initiated by coinjection of estradiol-17 beta (E2) with P4 on 
the 3rd day of delay. Immunostaining of EGF-R, autoradiographic detection of 
125I-labeled EGF binding, and measurement of EGF-inducible subcellular protein 
tyrosine phosphorylation demonstrated the loss of EGF-R from blastocysts 
(dormant) recovered 24 h after ovariectomy or on the 3rd day of P4-maintained 
delay. However, increased EGF-R levels were detected in blastocysts (activated) 
recovered 12 or 24 h after E2 injection. Blastocyst EGF-R mRNA levels were 
quantitated by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and distribution of this mRNA was 
examined by in situ hybridization. To provide a homologous probe for these 
studies, a mouse EGF-R partial cDNA was cloned and used as the template for 
synthesis of antisense- and sense-strand EGF-R RNA. Quantitative RT-PCR 
demonstrated an 8- to 10-fold reduction in EGF-R mRNA copies per cell in dormant 
blastocysts. In contrast, an 8-fold increase in EGF-R mRNA copies per cell was 
detected in activated blastocysts 8 h after injection of E2. In situ 
hybridization detected EGF-R mRNA in most cells of normal day 4 blastocysts but 
not in those of dormant blastocysts. These studies establish that expression of 
the EGF-R gene in mouse blastocysts is tightly regulated by maternal steroid 
hormonal status.
