IRSp53 has been characterized as an adaptor protein that links Rho-family small 
GTPases, such as Rac, to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we 
search for other binding partners for the IRSp53 SH3 domain and identify Eps8 as 
the major binding protein in fibroblasts and various cancer cell lines. Eps8 has 
been shown to form a Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor complex 
with Abi-1 and Sos-1, which seems essential for ruffling formation induced by 
oncogenic Ras. We confirm the IRSp53/Eps8 complex formation in vivo and the 
direct association between Eps8 NH(2)-terminal proline-rich sequence and IRSp53 
SH3 domain. This complex synergistically activates Rac by reinforcing the 
formation of the Eps8/Abi-1/Sos-1 Rac-guanine nucleotide exchange factor 
complex, which mediates positive regulation of Rac activity. In addition, 
IRSp53/Eps8 complex formation as determined by fluorescent resonance energy 
transfer analysis, occurs at the leading edge of motile cells, and the motility 
and invasiveness of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells are suppressed by inhibiting 
complex formation. These findings implicate the importance of the IRSp53/Eps8 
complex in Rac activation and metastatic behavior of the malignant tumor cells.
