In many organisms, the replication of DNA requires the binding of a protein 
called the initiator to DNA sites referred to as origins of replication. 
Analyses of multiple initiator proteins bound to their cognate origins have 
provided important insights into the mechanism by which DNA replication is 
initiated. To extend this level of analysis to the study of eukaryotic 
chromosomal replication, we have investigated the architecture of the 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae origin recognition complex (ORC) bound to yeast origins 
of replication. Determination of DNA residues important for ORC-origin 
association indicated that ORC interacts preferentially with one strand of the 
ARS1 origin of replication. DNA binding assays using ORC complexes lacking one 
of the six subunits demonstrated that the DNA binding domain of ORC requires the 
coordinate action of five of the six ORC subunits. Protein-DNA cross-linking 
studies suggested that recognition of origin sequences is mediated primarily by 
two different groups of ORC subunits that make sequence-specific contacts with 
two distinct regions of the DNA. Implications of these findings for ORC function 
and the mechanism of initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication are discussed.
