The vesicle docking protein p115 was found to be phosphorylated in a cell 
cycle-specific manner; it was found phosphorylated in interphase but not in 
mitotic cells. During interphase, however, two forms of p115 were detected in 
the cells; the phosphorylated form was found exclusively in cytosol, whereas the 
unphosphorylated form was associated with membranes, mostly of the Golgi 
complex. The latter form was released from the membranes upon phosphorylation. 
Mutational analysis revealed that the phosphorylation site of p115 was the 
Ser942 residue in the C-terminal acidic domain. A mutant with a single 
substitution of Ser942 --> Ala markedly increased its association with the Golgi 
membrane. Another mutant with Ser942 --> Asp was able to associate with the 
membrane, although at a decreased level, indicating that the dissociation of 
p115 from the membrane is not simply due to the negative charge of 
phosphorylated Ser942. Taken together, these results suggest that the 
phosphorylation of Ser942 at the C-terminal acidic domain regulates the 
interaction of p115 with the Golgi membrane, possibly taking part in the 
regulatory mechanism of vesicular transport.
