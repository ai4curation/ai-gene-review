CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that represses 
photomorphogenesis in the dark. Therefore, proteins interacting with COP1 could 
be important regulators of light-dependent development. Here, we identify 
CONSTANS-LIKE3 (COL3) as a novel interaction partner of COP1. A green 
fluorescent protein-COL3 fusion protein colocalizes with COP1 to nuclear 
speckles when transiently expressed in plant cells. This localization requires 
the B-box domains in COL3, indicating a novel function of this domain. A 
loss-of-function col3 mutant has longer hypocotyls in red light and in short 
days. Unlike constans, the col3 mutant flowers early and shows a reduced number 
of lateral branches in short days. The mutant also exhibits reduced formation of 
lateral roots. The col3 mutation partially suppresses the cop1 and deetiolated1 
(det1) mutations in the dark, suggesting that COL3 acts downstream of both of 
these repressors. However, the col3 mutation exerts opposing effects on cop1 and 
det1 in terms of lateral roots and anthocyanin accumulation, suggesting that 
COL3 also has activities that are independent of COP1 and DET1. In conclusion, 
we have identified COL3 as a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis that acts 
downstream of COP1 but can promote lateral root development independently of 
COP1 and also function as a daylength-sensitive regulator of shoot branching.

INTRODUCTION

The perception of light participates in the gating of key developmental transitions throughout the life cycle of the plant, such as germination of the seed, photomorphogenesis or deetiolation of the seedling, and flowering. Deetiolation is arguably the most dramatic of these light-dependent transitions. Exposure of an etiolated seedling to light results in the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, the promotion of cotyledon expansion, and the synthesis of a number of pigments, including chlorophyll and anthocyanin, and entails a dramatic transcriptional reprogramming ( Ma et al., 2001 ).

Arabidopsis thaliana has three major classes of photoreceptors: red/far-red-light–responding phytochromes, blue light/UV-A light–responding cryptochromes, and phototropins. The cytoplasmic phototropins primarily regulate processes optimizing photosynthesis, whereas the transcriptional and developmental changes are attributed to the phytochromes and the cryptochromes. The phytochromes, encoded by the five genes PHYA to PHYE , are cytoplasmic in the dark but translocate into the nucleus in the light ( Kircher et al., 2002 ). The active far-red-light–absorbing form of phyB was found to interact with a DNA-bound transcription factor, suggesting a rather direct signal transduction in which the photoreceptor could act in the promoter context ( Martinez-Garcia et al., 2000 ). The two cryptochromes cry1 and cry2 are nuclear in darkness; both are phosphorylated in response to light, whereby cry1 becomes enriched in the cytoplasm and the light-labile cry2 is degraded. Cryptochromes interact genetically with multiple phytochromes ( Neff et al., 2000 ). phyB and cry2 have been shown to tightly colocalize in vivo ( Mas et al., 2000 ), suggesting that the different photoreceptors might act together to initiate similar developmental pathways. This is consistent with the large overlap in transcription profiles seen in microarray studies of seedlings grown in different monochromatic lights ( Ma et al., 2001 ). Microarray studies performed in far-red light suggest that light initiates a transcriptional cascade in which a large fraction of the early affected genes are transcription factors ( Tepperman et al., 2001 ).

In the absence of light, the seedlings become etiolated, a developmentally arrested growth mode characterized by limited root growth, an elongated hypocotyl, closed undifferentiated cotyledons, and an apical hook. The developmental arrest seen during etiolated growth is mediated by the COP/DET/FUS proteins, which act as repressors of the default photomorphogenic pathway. Mutations in any of these 10 genes result in deetiolated growth in darkness. Dark-grown cop/det/fus alleles have genome expression profiles closely resembling those of light-grown seedlings ( Ma et al., 2003 ). Recent results have shown that COP/DET/FUS repression involves protein degradation. CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, mediates ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the transcription factors HY5, HYH, LAF1, and HFR1 as well as the phyA photoreceptor ( Osterlund et al., 2000a ; Holm et al., 2002 ; Seo et al., 2003 , 2004 ; Duek et al., 2004 ; Jang et al., 2005 ; Yang et al., 2005 ). The COP1-dependent degradation requires the activity of at least three different protein complexes: an ∼700-kD complex containing COP1 and SPA1 ( Saijo et al., 2003 ); a 350-kD complex containing COP10, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant, and DEETIOLATED1 (DET1) ( Yanagawa et al., 2004 ); and the COP9 signalosome, a nuclear protein complex that activates cullin-containing multisubunit ubiquitin ligases ( Cope and Deshaies, 2003 ; Wei and Deng, 2003 ).

The failure of plants with mutations in the COP/DET/FUS genes to arrest development during etiolated growth suggests that the targets of this pathway are likely to be key regulators of photomorphogenic development. To date, several photoreceptors as well as transcription factors have been shown to interact with COP1. phyB, cry1, and cry2 were found to interact with COP1 ( Wang et al., 2001 ; Yang et al., 2001 ), and cry2 accumulates in cop1-4 and cop1-6 mutants ( Shalitin et al., 2002 ), suggesting that COP1 might regulate cry2 abundance. Furthermore, COP1 was recently shown to interact with and ubiquitinate phyA ( Seo et al., 2004 ). These interactions suggest that COP1 could mediate the desensitization and/or termination of signaling through the photoreceptors in the light.

By contrast, the photomorphogenic development seen in cop/det/fus mutants in the dark could not be mediated by photoreceptors because they are activated by light. Furthermore, genetic analysis revealed that cop1 is epistatic to mutations disrupting phytochrome and cry1 function in darkness ( Ang and Deng, 1994 ). The photomorphogenic development in dark-grown cop/det/fus seedlings, therefore, is likely caused by the loss of COP/DET/FUS repression of factors acting downstream of the photoreceptors. Four of the previously identified COP1-interacting proteins are transcription factors, and all four are positive regulators of light signaling. HY5 acts as a positive regulator in far-red, red, blue, and UV-B light conditions, HFR1 is a positive regulator in far-red and blue light, whereas LAF1 and HYH promote light-dependent development in far-red and blue light, respectively ( Osterlund et al., 2000b ; Ballesteros et al., 2001 ; Holm et al., 2002 ; Duek and Fankhauser, 2003 ; Ulm et al., 2004 ). Despite significant recent progress, only a few downstream regulators of light signaling have been identified, and the functional relationship between them is not well understood.

To date, mutations in only two genes have been found to suppress the phenotypes conferred by both cop1 and det1 . One of these is HY5 ( Ang and Deng, 1994 ; Pepper and Chory, 1997 ), the first identified target of the COP/DET/FUS pathway. The other gene, TED3 , encodes a peroxisomal protein, and analysis of the dominant ted3 mutation revealed that enhanced peroxisomal function partially suppresses weak cop1 and det1 alleles ( Hu et al., 2002 ).

Here, we identify COL3 (for CONSTANS-LIKE3) as a COP1-interacting protein. Characterization of a col3 mutant indicates that COL3 positively regulates the light-dependent development and formation of lateral roots. Furthermore, COL3 inhibits shoot elongation and promotes branching of the shoot specifically in short-day conditions. Finally, col3 can suppress the deetiolated phenotype conferred by both cop1 and det1 alleles, and we characterize genetic interactions between col3 and hy5 , cop1 , and det1 .

DISCUSSION

Here, we report the identification of COL3 as a COP1-interacting protein and the characterization of a col3 loss-of-function mutant. The interaction between COP1 and COL3 that was identified in yeast two-hybrid assays is supported by colocalization and positive FRET signals between the proteins in onion epidermal cells. A functional interaction between COP1 and COL3 is further supported by phenotypic and genetic analyses of the col3 mutant.

Yeast Two-Hybrid Methods and Onion Experiments

The yeast strain Y190 ( Kim et al., 1997 ) was used for the two-hybrid screen and for the two-hybrid assays. The conversion of the λ ACT cDNA expression library (ABRC number CD4-22) into a pACT library, the two-hybrid screen, and the β-galactosidase assays were performed as described by Holm et al. (2001) . The pAVA321-S65TGFP-COL3 and pRTL2-mGFP-ΔCOL3 constructs, containing versions of the GFP ( von Arnim et al., 1998 ), the pAM-PAT-35SS-CFP-COP1 and pAM-PAT-35SS-YFP-COL3, and the pRTL2-COP1 overexpression constructs were introduced into onion ( Allium cepa ) epidermal cells by particle bombardment, incubated, and examined by epifluorescence microscopy as described previously ( Holm et al., 2002 ).

For the FRET–acceptor photobleaching experiments, live cell images were acquired using an Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a laser-scanning confocal imaging LSM 510 META system (Carl Zeiss). Cells were visualized 24 h after particle bombardment using the confocal microscope through a Plan-Neofluor 40×/1.3 oil (differential interference contrast) objective. The multitracking mode was used to eliminate spillover between fluorescence channels. The CFP was excited by a laser diode 405 laser and the YFP by an argon-ion laser, both at low intensities. Regions of interest were selected and bleached with 100 iterations using the argon-ion laser at 100%.

Expression of AD-COL3 and the three VP-substituted COL3 fusion proteins was examined by protein gel blot analysis using polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against COL3.
