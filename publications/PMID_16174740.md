sorLA (Sorting protein-related receptor) is a type-1 membrane protein of unknown 
function that is expressed in neurons. Its homology to sorting receptors that 
shuttle between the plasma membrane, endosomes, and the Golgi suggests a related 
function in neuronal trafficking processes. Because expression of sorLA is 
reduced in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), we tested 
involvement of this receptor in intracellular transport and processing of the 
amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), the 
principal component of senile plaques. We demonstrate that sorLA interacts with 
APP in vitro and in living cells and that both proteins colocalize in endosomal 
and Golgi compartments. Overexpression of sorLA in neurons causes redistribution 
of APP to the Golgi and decreased processing to Abeta, whereas ablation of sorLA 
expression in knockout mice results in increased levels of Abeta in the brain 
similar to the situation in AD patients. Thus, sorLA acts as a sorting receptor 
that protects APP from processing into Abeta and thereby reduces the burden of 
amyloidogenic peptide formation. Consequently, reduced receptor expression in 
the human brain may increase Abeta production and plaque formation and promote 
spontaneous AD.
