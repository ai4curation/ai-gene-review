The heterodimeric Ku complex affects telomere structure in diverse organisms. We 
report here that in the absence of Ku, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, 
Est2p, was not telomere-associated in G1 phase, and its association in late S 
phase was decreased. The telomere association of Est1p, a telomerase component 
that binds telomeres only in late S phase, was also reduced in the absence of 
Ku. The effects of Ku on telomerase binding require a 48-nucleotide (nt) 
stem-loop region of TLC1 telomerase RNA. Ku interacts with TLC1 RNA via this 
48-nt region throughout the cell cycle, but this interaction was reduced after 
telomere replication. These data support a model in which Ku recruits telomerase 
to telomeres in G1 phase when telomerase is inactive and promotes 
telomerase-mediated telomere lengthening in late S phase.
