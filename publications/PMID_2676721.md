The CYC1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is positively regulated by the HAP2 
and HAP3 proteins, which form a heteromeric complex that binds to a CCAAT box in 
the upstream activation site, UAS2, and which activate transcription in a 
nonfermentable carbon source. We carried out a genetic analysis to identify 
additional trans-acting regulatory factors exerting their effects through UAS2. 
We present the identification and characterization of a new locus, HAP4, which 
is shown to encode a subunit of the DNA-binding complex at UAS2. In the hap4 
mutant, the binding of HAP2 and HAP3 (HAP2/3) is not observed in vitro. The HAP4 
gene is regulated transcriptionally by a carbon source, suggesting that it 
encodes a regulatory subunit of the bound complex. The sequence of HAP4 shows a 
highly acidic region, which innactivated the protein when deleted. Replacement 
of this region with the activation domain of GAL4 restored activity, suggesting 
that it provides the principal activation domain to the bound HAP2/3/4 complex.
