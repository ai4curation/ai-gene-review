Nutrient starvation and inactivation of target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) 
protein kinase induce nucleophagy preferentially degrading only nucleolar 
components in budding yeast. Nucleolar proteins are relocated to sites proximal 
to the nucleus-vacuole junction (NVJ), where micronucleophagy occurs, whereas 
rDNA, which is embedded in the nucleolus under normal conditions, moves to 
NVJ-distal regions, causing rDNA dissociation from nucleolar proteins after 
TORC1 inactivation. This repositioning is mediated via chromosome linkage INM 
protein (CLIP)-cohibin complexes that tether rDNA to the inner nuclear membrane. 
Here, we show that TORC1 inactivation-induced rDNA condensation promotes the 
repositioning of rDNA and nucleolar proteins. Defects in condensin, Rpd3-Sin3 
histone deacetylase (HDAC), and high-mobility group protein 1 (Hmo1), which are 
involved in TORC1 inactivation-induced rDNA condensation, compromised the 
repositioning and nucleophagic degradation of nucleolar proteins, although rDNA 
still escaped from nucleophagic degradation in these mutants. We propose a model 
in which rDNA condensation after TORC1 inactivation generates a motive force for 
the repositioning of rDNA and nucleolar proteins.
