Eukaryotic topoisomerase II is a nuclear enzyme essential for DNA metabolism and 
chromosome dynamics. The enzyme has a dimeric structure, and subunit 
dimerization is vital to the cellular functions and activities of the enzyme. 
Two biochemical approaches based on metal ion affinity chromatography and 
immunoprecipitation have been carried out to map the dimerization region(s) in 
human topoisomerase IIalpha. The results demonstrate that two regions spanning 
amino acids 1053-1069 and 1124-1143 are both essential for dimerization. The 
regions correspond to the interaction domains revealed in yeast topoisomerase II 
after crystallization of a central fragment of this enzyme, indicating that the 
overall C-terminal dimerization structure of eukaryotic topoisomerase II is 
conserved from yeast to human. Furthermore, linker insertion analysis has 
demonstrated that the two dimerization regions are located in a highly flexible 
part of the enzyme. Topoisomerase IIalpha mutant enzymes unable to dimerize via 
the C-terminal primary dimerization regions due to lack of one of the defined 
dimerization regions can still be forced to dimerize if DNA and an ATP analog 
are added to the reaction mixture. The result indicates that secondary 
interactions occur by ATP analog-mediated clamp closing when the subunits are 
brought together on DNA.
