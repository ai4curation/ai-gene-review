Biofilm formation is an example of a multicellular process which depends on 
cooperative behavior and differentiation within a bacterial population. Our 
findings indicate that there is a complex feedback loop that maintains the 
stoichiometry of the extracellular matrix and other proteins required for 
complex colony development by Bacillus subtilis. Analysis of the transcriptional 
regulation of two DegU-activated genes that are required for complex colony 
development by B. subtilis revealed additional involvement of global regulators 
that are central to controlling biofilm formation. Activation of transcription 
from both the yvcA and yuaB promoters requires DegU approximately phosphate, but 
transcription is inhibited by direct AbrB binding to the promoter regions. 
Inhibition of transcription by AbrB is relieved when Spo0A approximately 
phosphate is generated due to its known role in inhibiting abrB expression. 
Deletion of SinR, a key coordinator of motility and biofilm formation, enhanced 
transcription from both loci; however, no evidence of a direct interaction with 
SinR for either the yvcA or yuaB promoter regions was observed. The enhanced 
transcription in the sinR mutant background was subsequently demonstrated to be 
dependent on biosynthesis of the polysaccharide component that forms the major 
constituent of the B. subtilis biofilm matrix. Together, these findings indicate 
that a genetic network dependent on activation of both DegU and Spo0A controls 
complex colony development by B. subtilis.
