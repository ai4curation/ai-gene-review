C. elegans OSM-9 is a TRPV channel protein involved in sensory transduction and 
adaptation. Here, we show that distinct sensory functions arise from different 
combinations of OSM-9 and related OCR TRPV proteins. Both OSM-9 and OCR-2 are 
essential for several forms of sensory transduction, including olfaction, 
osmosensation, mechanosensation, and chemosensation. In neurons that express 
both OSM-9 and OCR-2, tagged OCR-2 and OSM-9 proteins reside in sensory cilia 
and promote each other's localization to cilia. In neurons that express only 
OSM-9, tagged OSM-9 protein resides in the cell body and acts in sensory 
adaptation rather than sensory transduction. Thus, alternative combinations of 
TRPV proteins may direct different functions in distinct subcellular locations. 
Animals expressing the mammalian TRPV1 (VR1) channel in ASH nociceptor neurons 
avoid the TRPV1 ligand capsaicin, allowing selective, drug-inducible activation 
of a specific behavior.
