The epidermal growth factor (EGF) family hormones amphiregulin (AR), 
transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), and heparin-binding EGF-like 
growth factor (HB-EGF) are thought to play significant roles in the genesis or 
progression of a number of human malignancies. However, the ability of these 
ligands to activate all four erbB family receptors has not been evaluated. 
Therefore, we have assessed the stimulation of erbB family receptor tyrosine 
phosphorylation by these hormones in a panel of mouse Ba/F3 cell lines 
expressing the four erbB family receptors, singly and in pairwise combinations. 
We also measured the stimulation of interleukin-3-independent survival or 
proliferation in this panel of Ba/F3 cell lines to compare the patterns of erbB 
family receptor coupling to physiologic responses induced by these peptides. 
EGF, TGF-alpha, AR, and HB-EGF all stimulated qualitatively similar patterns of 
erbB family receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and coupling to physiologic 
responses. Therefore, EGF, TGF-alpha, AR, and HB-EGF are functionally identical 
in this model system and behave differently from the EGF family hormones 
betacellulin and neuregulins.
