Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated self-degradation process of eukaryotic cells 
that, depending on the cellular milieu, can either promote survival or act as an 
alternative mechanism of programmed cell death (PCD) in terminally 
differentiated cells. Despite the important developmental and medical 
implications of autophagy and the main form of PCD, apoptosis, orchestration of 
their regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we show in the nematode 
Caenorhabditis elegans, that various genetic and pharmacological interventions 
causing embryonic lethality trigger a massive cell death response that has both 
autophagic and apoptotic features. The two degradation processes are also 
redundantly required for normal development and viability in this organism. 
Furthermore, the CES-2-like basic region leucine-zipper (bZip) transcription 
factor ATF-2, an upstream modulator of the core apoptotic cell death pathway, is 
able to directly regulate the expression of at least two key autophagy-related 
genes, bec-1/ATG6 and lgg-1/ATG8. Thus, the two cell death mechanisms share a 
common method of transcriptional regulation. Together, these results imply that 
under certain physiological and pathological conditions, autophagy and apoptosis 
are co-regulated to ensure the proper morphogenesis and survival of the 
developing organism. The identification of apoptosis and autophagy as 
compensatory cellular pathways in C. elegans might help us to understand how 
dysregulated PCD in humans can lead to diverse pathologies, including cancer, 
neurodegeneration and diabetes.
