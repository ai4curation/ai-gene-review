The matrix protein thrombospondin-4 has an acidic amphipathic C-terminal peptide 
(C21) which stimulates erythroid cell proliferation. Here we show that C21 
stimulates red cell formation in anemic mice in vivo. In vitro experiments 
indicated that the peptide-mediated increase of erythroid colony formation in 
cultures of human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells was possible only under 
continuous presence of erythropoietin. In the absence of this cytokine, C21 
stimulated exclusively myeloid colony formation. Therefore, the peptide is not a 
specific erythroid differentiation factor. In fact, it is mitogenic in 
non-erythroid cells, such as skin fibroblasts and kidney epithelial cells. In 
erythroleukemic TF-1 cells, it actually decreased the production of the 
erythroid differentiation marker glycophorin A. C21-affinity chromatography 
revealed regulator of differentiation 1 (ROD1) as a major C21-binding protein. 
ROD1 is the hematopoietic cell paralog of polypyrimidine tract binding proteins 
(PTBs), RNA splice regulators which regulate differentiation by repressing 
tissue-specific exons. ROD1 binding to C21 was strongly inhibited by synthetic 
RNAs in the order poly A > poly U > poly G = poly C and was weakly inhibited by 
a synthetic phosphorylated peptide mimicking the C-terminal domain of RNA 
polymerase II. Cellular overexpression or knockdown experiments of ROD1 suggest 
a role for this protein in the mitogenic activity of C21. Since the nuclear 
proteins ROD1 and PTBs regulate differentiation at a posttranscriptional level 
and there is a fast nuclear uptake of C21, we put forward the idea that the 
peptide is internalized, goes to the nucleus and maintains cells in a 
proliferative state by supporting ROD1-mediated inhibition of differentiation.
