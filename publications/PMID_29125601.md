Autophagy is a highly complicated process with participation of large numbers of 
autophagy-related proteins. Under nutrient starvation, autophagy promotes cell 
survival by breaking down nonessential cellular components for recycling use. 
However, due to its high complexity, molecular mechanism of autophagy is still 
not fully understood. In the present study, we report a novel autophagy-related 
protein TM9SF4, which plays a functional role in the induction phase of 
autophagic process. TM9SF4 proteins were abundantly expressed in the kidney, 
especially in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. At subcellular cells, 
TM9SF4 proteins were mostly localized in lysosome, Golgi, late endosome and 
autophagosome. Knockdown of TM9SF4 with TM9SF4-shRNAs markedly reduced the 
starvation-induced autophagy in HEK293 cells, the effect of which persisted in 
the presence of bafilomycin A1. TM9SF4-shRNAs also substantially attenuated the 
starvation-induced mTOR inactivation. In animal model, starvation was able to 
induce LC3-II accumulation and cause mTOR inactivation in renal cortical tissue 
in wild-type mice, the effect of which was minimal/absent in TM9SF4 knockout 
(TM9SF4-/-) mice. Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay 
demonstrated physical interaction of TM9SF4 proteins with mTOR. In addition, 
knockdown or knockout of TM9SF4 reduced the starvation-induced cell death in 
HEK293 cells and animal model. Taken together, the present study identifies 
TM9SF4 as a novel autophagy-related protein. Under nutrient starvation, TM9SF4 
functions to facilitate mTOR inactivation, resulting in an enhanced autophagic 
flux, which serves to protect cells from apoptotic cell death.
