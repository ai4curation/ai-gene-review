Protein O-mannosylation is found in yeast and metazoans, and a family of

this important post-translational modification. We recently discovered that the 
cadherin superfamily carries O-linked mannose (O-Man) glycans at highly 
conserved residues in specific extracellular cadherin domains, and it was 
suggested that the function of E-cadherin was dependent on the O-Man glycans. 
Deficiencies in enzymes catalyzing O-Man biosynthesis, including the two human 
protein O-mannosyltransferases, POMT1 and POMT2, underlie a subgroup of 
congenital muscular dystrophies designated α-dystroglycanopathies, because 
deficient O-Man glycosylation of α-dystroglycan disrupts laminin interaction 
with α-dystroglycan and the extracellular matrix. To explore the functions of 
O-Man glycans on cadherins and protocadherins, we used a combinatorial 
gene-editing strategy in multiple cell lines to evaluate the role of the two 
POMTs initiating O-Man glycosylation and the major enzyme elongating O-Man 
glycans, the protein O-mannose β-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, POMGnT1. 
Surprisingly, O-mannosylation of cadherins and protocadherins does not require 
POMT1 and/or POMT2 in contrast to α-dystroglycan, and moreover, the O-Man 
glycans on cadherins are not elongated. Thus, the classical and evolutionarily 
conserved POMT O-mannosylation pathway is essentially dedicated to 
α-dystroglycan and a few other proteins, whereas a novel O-mannosylation process 
in mammalian cells is predicted to serve the large cadherin superfamily and

Abstract

Protein O- mannosylation is found in yeast and metazoans, and a family of conserved orthologous protein O- mannosyltransferases is believed to initiate this important post-translational modification. We recently discovered that the cadherin superfamily carries O- linked mannose ( O -Man) glycans at highly conserved residues in specific extracellular cadherin domains, and it was suggested that the function of E-cadherin was dependent on the O- Man glycans. Deficiencies in enzymes catalyzing O- Man biosynthesis, including the two human protein O- mannosyltransferases, POMT1 and POMT2, underlie a subgroup of congenital muscular dystrophies designated α-dystroglycanopathies, because deficient O- Man glycosylation of α-dystroglycan disrupts laminin interaction with α-dystroglycan and the extracellular matrix. To explore the functions of O- Man glycans on cadherins and protocadherins, we used a combinatorial gene-editing strategy in multiple cell lines to evaluate the role of the two POMTs initiating O- Man glycosylation and the major enzyme elongating O- Man glycans, the protein O- mannose β-1,2- N -acetylglucosaminyltransferase, POMGnT1. Surprisingly, O- mannosylation of cadherins and protocadherins does not require POMT1 and/or POMT2 in contrast to α-dystroglycan, and moreover, the O- Man glycans on cadherins are not elongated. Thus, the classical and evolutionarily conserved POMT O- mannosylation pathway is essentially dedicated to α-dystroglycan and a few other proteins, whereas a novel O- mannosylation process in mammalian cells is predicted to serve the large cadherin superfamily and other proteins.

Introduction

Protein O- glycosylation of the O- mannose type was originally thought to be found only in yeast and fungi, but studies over the last 30 years have identified O- Man 2 glycans and specific glycoproteins carrying O- Man glycans in human and rodents ( 1 – 9 ). The basement membrane glycoprotein α-dystroglycan (α-DG) was for some time the only well characterized O- mannosylated protein known in mammals despite evidence that O- Man glycans constitute a major part of the total O- glycans in the brain ( 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 ). O- Mannosylation of α-DG is essential for assembly and function of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex that links the cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix, and deficiencies in all of the enzymes involved in the O- Man glycosylation underlie a subgroup of congenital muscular dystrophies ( 10 – 12 ). More recently, the human O- Man glycoproteome was characterized, and it was found that the large superfamily of cadherins (cdhs) and protocadherins (pcdhs) are also decorated with α-linked O- Man glycans on extracellular cadherin (EC) domains. The attachment sites of these O- Man glycans appear to be highly conserved throughout evolution ( 13 , 14 ); moreover, O- mannosylation of E-cadherin was suggested to be crucial for E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion ( 15 , 16 ).

O -Man glycosylation in metazoans is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by transfer of mannose from dolichol monophosphate-activated mannose to serine and threonine by the POMT1 and POMT2 protein O- mannosyltransferases. Our insight into the substrate specificities of these enzymes largely stems from studies of the yeast orthologs, which consist of a larger family of six or more p rotein O- m annosyl t ransferases (PMTs) ( 17 , 18 ). These are grouped into three subfamilies, PMT1, PMT2, and PMT4, and the two metazoan orthologs, POMT1 and POMT2, are grouped in subfamilies PMT4 and PMT2, respectively ( 17 , 18 ). This categorization is based on sequence similarities, but a recent study confirmed the functional similarity between the human POMT1 and yeast PMT4 enzymes ( 19 ). O- Mannosylation of proteins in yeast is widespread, and we recently characterized the yeast O- Man glycoproteome identifying almost 300 glycoproteins that enter the secretory pathway ( 20 ). In addition, we also found that yeast has an additional and unique nucleocytoplasmic O- Man glycoproteome, which is predicted to be glycosylated by a yet unknown cytosolic/nuclear O- mannosyltransferase(s) different from the ER-located PMTs ( 21 ). The nucleocytoplasmic O- mannosylation system is only found in yeast and is predicted to serve similar functions as the nucleocytoplasmic O- GlcNAcylation found in all eukaryotic cells except yeast ( 22 ). The ER-located PMTs in yeast have wide glycosylation functions of ER/Golgi, cell wall, and secreted proteins, similar to the metazoan GalNAc-type O- glycosylation ( 23 ), and in fact it appears that the two types of glycosylation have great overlaps in proteins and glycosites as well as biological functions ( 20 , 24 ). Interestingly, the orthologous metazoans POMT1 and POMT2 are predicted to have narrower substrate specificities and only serve in glycosylating a limited number of proteins, including α-DG and cdhs/pcdhs ( 13 , 15 , 19 ). However, the functions of the POMT1 and POMT2 isoenzymes and their relationship with the larger family of yeast PMTs are still poorly understood.

In this study, we aimed to explore the biological roles of O- mannosylation of the large families of important cdh and pcdh adhesion proteins. We used a knock-out strategy to deconstruct the genetic regulation targeting the POMT1 and POMT2 genes as well as POMGNT1 in two mammalian cell lines. We also used the SimpleCell O- glycoproteomics approach targeting both COSMC and POMGNT1 to demonstrate a predicted interplay between O- Man and O- GalNAc glycosylation in human HEK293 cells. We found in agreement with previous reports that both POMT1 and POMT2 were required for O- mannosylation of α-DG; however, to our surprise, deficiency in either or both POMT1 and POMT2 did not affect O- mannosylation of cdhs, pcdhs, and additional proteins. This finding was confirmed by analysis of a human skin fibroblast cell line derived from a POMT1-deficient patient. Thus, our study suggests that the function of the two mammalian POMTs is even more limited than previously predicted and serves α-DG and few additional proteins, including the mucin-like protein KIAA1549. Most importantly, the results suggest the existence of a previously unknown ER/Golgi-located protein O- mannosylation pathway in mammalian cells that specifically control O- Man glycosylation of the superfamily of cadherins.

Discussion

The original aim of our study was to explore the function of O- Man glycans on cadherins and protocadherins by genetic deconstruction of the protein O- mannosylation capacity in mammalian cells and enabling direct functional assays. It was previously suggested that POMT2 was required for E-cadherin cell adhesion ( 15 ), and we wanted to evaluate the role of the two POMTs and POMGnT1 for functions of cdhs and pcdhs. To our surprise, knock-out of any of these three genes alone or in combination did not affect O- mannosylation of cdhs and pcdhs, in striking contrast to α-DG. We unequivocally demonstrate that both POMT1 and POMT2 are required for O- mannosylation of α-DG, and our findings strongly indicate the existence of a novel O- mannosylation process in mammalian cells that is distinct from the classical yeast type controlled by the PMT orthologs POMT1 and POMT2. The developed double POMT1/POMT2 knock-out cell lines now offer the opportunity to distinguish and screen for the glycosyltransferase genes controlling this novel type of O- mannosylation, and this gene hunt is now in progress. Interestingly, our results also suggest that this novel O- mannosylation pathway targets substrate sites involving distinct conformations such as the EC domains in cdhs/pcdhs and not unstructured regions such as the mucin domains of α-DG and KIAA1549. Moreover, the novel type of O- mannosylation appears to be limited to a single α-Man residue, although we cannot completely exclude that elongation may occur in other cell types. How the POMGnTs avoid elongating these O- Man glycans will be an interesting topic for future studies. A recent report demonstrates that POMGnT1 controlling the core M1 elongation uses a βGlcNAc-binding lectin domain in its stem region for clustered glycosylation of α-DG ( 35 ); however, it has also recently been demonstrated that POMGnT1 exhibits rather promiscuous acceptor substrate specificity, whereas POMGnT2 controlling the competing core M3 elongation pathway has restricted peptide acceptor specificity and thus is predicted to be the gatekeeper for the site-specific glycosylation of α-DG ( 36 ).

The functions of the metazoan POMT1 and POMT2 isoenzymes and their relationship with the larger family of yeast PMTs are still poorly understood. The cumulative function of the yeast PMT isoenzymes are expected to cover a wide range of protein substrates as evidenced by our recent analysis of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe O- Man glycoproteomes ( 20 , 21 ), but detailed substrate specificities of the individual PMTs and their contributions to the yeast O- Man glycoproteome are missing ( 19 ). Previous reports indicate that POMT1 and POMT2 are both required to form a functional complex for initiation of O- mannosylation of the α-DG mucin-like domain ( 37 ), and this was confirmed here in both CHO and HEK293 cells where single knock-out of either POMT gene eliminated detection of α-DG O- Man glycopeptides ( Figs. 2 and 3 ). It has been hypothesized that the individual POMT1 and POMT2 could have independent glycosylation functions ( 15 , 38 ), but we found no consistent differences in the O- Man glycoproteomes of single versus double knock-out of the two POMTs suggesting that this is not the case. Although our gene-targeting strategy for POMT1 and POMT2 included targeting of different exons in CHO and HEK293 cells that are known to be important for the catalytic function, it should be emphasized that we cannot unequivocally exclude the remote possibility that the mutant genes could encode enzymatic functions. However, we propose that our results strongly indicate that POMT1 and POMT2 have narrow functions in O- glycosylation and serve a few proteins with unstructured mucin-like regions such as the N-terminal part of the mucin domain α-DG and the KIAA1549 protein. How this selectivity is obtained given that a large number of mucins and mucin-like proteins that passes through the ER before being GalNAc O- glycosylated in the Golgi is unclear but suggests the presence of a special signal. Hanisch and co-workers ( 28 ) originally suggested that an upstream sequence N-terminal to the α-DG mucin domain directed O- mannosylation, and such a mechanism is found for other types of glycosylation, including selection of N -glycoproteins destined for the lysosome by the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase ( 39 ) and the hormone β4GalNAc-transferases ( 40 , 41 ).

Genetic deconstruction and simplification of glycosylation capacities in cell lines have been fruitful strategies to uncover glycoproteomes and novel types of glycosylation ( 13 , 23 ), and the present example adds to this by deciphering the functions of the POMTs and uncovering a previously unknown type of O- mannosylation. Protein O- mannosylation in eukaryotes now comprise at least three distinct types as follows: the evolutionarily conserved PMT/POMT ER-located type that serves α-DG and some unstructured mucin-like proteins; the yeast-specific nucleocytoplasmic type ( 21 ); and a pathway as predicted here to serve the folded EC domains of the large cadherin superfamily in higher eukaryotic cells.

The finding that POMTs do not control glycosylation of cadherins suggests the original observation that the POMT2 important for E-cadherin function may not be directly associated with O- glycans on cadherins. Strahl and co-workers ( 15 ) used genetic and pharmacological approaches to block POMTs, and observed that mouse embryos deficient in O- mannosylation failed to proceed from the morula to the blastocyst stage due to defects in cell-cell contact. In a recent report, POMT2 was also shown to affect E-cadherin N -glycosylation and O- mannosylation in cancer ( 42 ). Strahl and co-workers ( 43 ) also demonstrated with a monoclonal antibody developed to an O- Man glycopeptide that reactivity in the murine brain was dependent on POMT2. Currently, we have no explanation for these findings in relation to our results.

Our finding also has relevance for congenital diseases of glycosylation associated with partial deficiencies in POMT1 or POMT2 (OMIM 607423 and 607439) and causing three different forms of muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy, including severe forms with brain and eye anomalies also designated Walker-Warburg syndrome or muscle-eye-brain disease, a less severe congenital form with mental retardation, and a milder limb-girdle form also designated LGMD2 ( 44 – 47 ). Deficiency in the POMGNT1 gene (OMIM 606822) underlies similar but less severe dystroglycanopathies and phenotypes as those of the POMTs ( 48 ), and this may be in agreement with our finding that this enzyme only elongates O- Man glycans on α-DG and related proteins and not those on the cadherin family of proteins. Provided that the highly conserved O- mannosylation of the large cadherin family has important functions, this would be in agreement with our finding that this process is unrelated to the POMTs and α-DG glycosylation.

An overlap in proteins and sites undergoing O- glycosylation by yeast PMTs and metazoan GalNAc-Ts has been discussed for some time, and for example, recombinant expression of human O- glycoproteins in yeast has resulted in attachment of O- Man glycans on sites normally undergoing GalNAc glycosylation ( 49 ). In vitro studies with peptides have further supported this ( 24 ), and here we provided evidence that elimination of POMT-driven O- mannosylation of α-DG in HEK293 cells results in GalNAc glycosylation at sites normally occupied by O- Man glycans, as shown previously by in vivo studies in Drosophila melanogaster ( 50 ). In normal human cells, the two glycosylation processes are topologically separated in ER and Golgi, but in cancer the GalNAc-Ts may relocate to the ER and thus potentially compete with POMTs ( 51 , 52 ). In this study we did not consider the POMGnT2 pathway ( Fig. 1 ), involving addition of β4GlcNAc to O- Man glycans to form the M3 core ( 53 , 54 ). We reasoned that it would not substantially affect our global glycoproteomic analysis since it has only been reported to occur on α-DG ( 27 , 54 – 57 ).

Our study strongly suggests that the α-linked O- Man glycans on the cadherin superfamily is not elongated. Recombinant expression in HEK293 POMT1/POMT2 and bottom-up mass spectrometry of three representative members of the cadherin superfamily provided further insight into the O- Man biosynthesis on these glycoproteins. In contrast to the global approach using total cell lysates, the targeted analysis using purified cadherins enabled a focused search for defined glycan modifications on specific glycopeptides where O- Man elongation was expected to occur. Although routine data processing and manual inspection of both MS1 and HCD-MS2 spectra were performed in search of mass increments and signature oxonium ions ( m/z 204.09) indicative of O- Man elongation, the bottom-up analysis identified only simple O- Man monosaccharides on the purified cadherins. This does not exclude a possible scenario where cadherin O- Man glycans are elongated into high-molecular-weight complex polysaccharides, similar to the α-DG complex O- Man glycans initiated by the POMGnT2 pathway ( Fig. 1 ) ( 55 – 57 ), which would result in generation of glycopeptides that evade detection and/or identification by our mass spectrometry approach. However, this possibility is unlikely considering that the purified cadherins migrated as homogeneous bands at the expected molecular weights following SDS-PAGE analysis ( Fig. 6 ). Still, we cannot completely rule out temporal and/or spatial mechanisms capable of regulating elongation of cadherin O- Man glycans. Analogous to the Notch signaling system where O- linked fucose ( O -Fuc) may be present as a single monosaccharide unit or elongated into a tetrasaccharide with profound consequences on cell signaling ( 58 ), a similar but as yet unknown biosynthetic pathway capable of modifying and elongating the O- Man monosaccharides found on cadherins and plexins, for example, may still exist. However, using HEK293 as a model system, we find no evidence to support this hypothesis and conclude that the O- Man glycosylation found on cadherin superfamily members is not elongated into complex glycans but rather is limited to single O- Man monosaccharide units. This is in agreement with the recent conclusions drawn by Strahl and co-workers ( 43 ) based on immunohistochemical and glycoproteomics studies.

The cadherin superfamily is characterized by the specific EC domain protein fold ( 59 ), and the O- Man glycans on cadherins and protocadherins are all located at evolutionarily conserved sites found on the β-sheet elements of EC domains ( 13 , 14 ). In contrast, α-DG O- Man glycans are located in the mucin-like domain that is predicted to be unstructured and disordered. Notably, O- Man glycosylations outside the mucin-like domain of α-DG have been demonstrated in D. melanogaster ( 50 ). However, these O- Man glycosites were found on α-DG regions poorly conserved in higher species, e.g. mouse or humans, suggesting that O- Man glycosylation outside the unstructured mucin-like domain of α-DG may be restricted to lower species. Thus, the POMT1/POMT2-independent O- Man initiation appears to have a preference for specific folded protein domains, analogous to the process of O- Fuc glycosylation on structured EGF domains of Notch proteins ( 58 ). This conclusion is further supported by the observation that the POMT1/POMT2-independent O- Man glycosylation of plexins is found on β-strands of IPT/TIG domain folds. Furthermore, a third example of structured protein regions targeted by the POMT1/POMT2-independent O- Man pathway appears to include the Ig-like C2-type domains. We have previously identified intracellular adhesion molecule 1 with O- Man glycans on the Ig-like C2-type domain ( 13 ), and here we found two additional members, hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PGFRA). It is interesting to note that there are currently 22 and 323 human proteins in UniProtKB annotated with IPT/TIG and Ig-like C2-type domains, respectively ( supplemental Table S8 ). It is conceivable that a majority of these proteins may be targets for the novel POMT1/POMT2-independent O- mannosylation pathway.

In summary, our study highlights that our knowledge of protein glycosylation is still incomplete and that O- mannosylation of proteins is far more complicated than previously thought. We present evidence that the large family of cadherins and other proteins are not O- mannosylated by the POMTs, indicating the existence of a novel O- mannosylation pathway for these proteins. Instead, the POMTs are suggested to have exquisitely narrow glycosylation functions of α-DG and a few other unstructured protein domains, which may explain the well defined α-dystroglycanopathy phenotypic features associated with deficiencies. Our study enables the discovery of the O- mannosylation enzymes for cadherins and the characterization of biological functions related to this unique type of protein glycosylation. In preliminary studies we have identified a homologous gene family conserved in metazoans that is indispensable for O- mannosylation of cadherins in HEK293 cells in contrast to POMTs as shown here, and we are in progress with characterization of this gene family.
