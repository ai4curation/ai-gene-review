Gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells has been used to mutate the murine 
DNA methyltransferase gene. ES cell lines homozygous for the mutation were 
generated by consecutive targeting of both wild-type alleles; the mutant cells 
were viable and showed no obvious abnormalities with respect to growth rate or 
morphology, and had only trace levels of DNA methyltransferase activity. A 
quantitative end-labeling assay showed that the level of m5C in the DNA of 
homozygous mutant cells was about one-third that of wild-type cells, and 
Southern blot analysis after cleavage of the DNA with a methylation-sensitive 
restriction endonuclease revealed substantial demethylation of endogenous 
retroviral DNA. The mutation was introduced into the germline of mice and found 
to cause a recessive lethal phenotype. Homozygous embryos were stunted, delayed 
in development, and did not survive past mid-gestation. The DNA of homozygous 
embryos showed a reduction of the level of m5C similar to that of homozygous ES 
cells. These results indicate that while a 3-fold reduction in levels of genomic 
m5C has no detectable effect on the viability or proliferation of ES cells in 
culture, a similar reduction of DNA methylation in embryos causes abnormal 
development and embryonic lethality.
