The multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) is assembled on mRNAs as a 
consequence of splicing. EJC core components maintain a stable grip on mRNAs 
even as the overall EJC protein composition evolves while mRNAs travel to the 
cytoplasm. Here we show that recombinant EJC subunits MLN51, MAGOH and Y14, 
together with the DEAD-box protein eIF4AIII bound to ATP, are necessary and 
sufficient to form a highly stable complex on single-stranded RNA. Cross-linking 
and RNase protection studies indicate that this recombinant complex 
recapitulates the EJC core. The stable association of the recombinant EJC core 
with RNA is maintained by inhibition of eIF4AIII ATPase activity by MAGOH-Y14. 
We elucidate the modalities of EJC binding to RNA and provide the first example 
of how cellular machineries may use RNA helicases to clamp several proteins onto 
RNA in stable and sequence-independent manners.
