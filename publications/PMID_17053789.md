POT1 (protection of telomere 1) is a highly conserved single-stranded telomeric 
binding protein that is essential for telomere end protection. Here, we report

POT1b binds telomeric DNA via conserved DNA binding 
oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide (OB) folds. Compared to POT1a, POT1b OB-folds

vivo. Overexpression of a mutant Pot1b allele that cannot bind telomeric DNA 
initiated a DNA damage response at telomeres that led to p53-dependent

Abstract

POT1 ( p rotection o f t elomere 1) is a highly conserved single-stranded telomeric binding protein that is essential for telomere end protection. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a second member of the mouse POT family. POT1b binds telomeric DNA via conserved DNA binding oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide (OB) folds. Compared to POT1a, POT1b OB-folds possess less sequence specificity for telomeres. In contrast to POT1a, truncated POT1b possessing only the OB-folds can efficiently localize to telomeres in vivo . Overexpression of a mutant Pot1b allele that cannot bind telomeric DNA initiated a DNA damage response at telomeres that led to p53-dependent senescence. Furthermore, a reduction of the 3′ G-rich overhang, increased chromosomal fusions and elevated homologous recombination (HR) were observed at telomeres. shRNA mediated depletion of endogenous Pot1b in Pot1a deficient cells resulted in increased chromosomal aberrations. Our results indicate that POT1b plays important protective functions at telomeres and that proper maintenance of chromosomal stability requires both POT proteins.

Introduction

Telomeres are specialized protein–DNA complexes that cap the ends of linear chromosomes and maintain genome stability by providing both end protection and a mechanism for complete replication of chromosomal termini. In mammals, telomeres consist of TTAGGG repetitive sequences that terminate in single-stranded (ss) 3′ G-rich overhangs that can be sequestered into lariat-like structures termed the t-loop ( Griffith et al , 1999 ; Murti and Prescott, 1999 ; Nikitina and Woodcock, 2004 ). A model has been proposed in which this altered telomeric conformation is required to protect telomeres from being recognized as double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) that would otherwise activate DNA damage checkpoint responses (reviewed in de Lange, 2005 ). Failure to properly maintain telomere end capping functions results in dysfunctional telomeres that are processed by the DNA damage response pathways to initiate the onset of replicative senescence or fuel genomic instability associated with cancer cells ( Karlseder et al , 1999 ; Celli and de Lange, 2005 ; Wong et al , 2006 ).

The telomeric G-rich overhang is evolutionarily conserved and is a substrate for ss DNA binding proteins TEBPαβ (telomere end binding protein) found in the ciliate Oxytricha nova ( Price and Cech, 1987 ), Cdc13p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Garvik et al , 1996 ; Chandra et al , 2001 ) and p rotection o f t elomere 1 (POT1), first identified in S. pombe and are present in diverse organisms including plant, chicken, mouse and human ( Baumann and Cech, 2001 ; Baumann et al , 2002 ; Wei and Price, 2004 ; Shakirov et al , 2005 ; Wu et al , 2006 ). All three proteins bind ss telomeric DNA through oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding motifs (OB-fold), a structurally conserved protein domain capable of binding to ss DNA with both high affinity and specificity ( Mitton-Fry et al , 2002 ; Lei et al , 2003 , 2004 ). While POT1, Cdc13p and TEBPαβ all use OB-folds to bind ss telomeric DNA, considerable diversity exists between the DNA binding domains of these proteins. Cdc13p uses only one OB-fold to bind DNA, while POT1 and TEBPαβ use two or more OB-folds for DNA binding ( Price and Cech, 1987 ; Horvath et al , 1998 ; Lei et al , 2002 , 2004 ; Trujillo et al , 2005 ). The importance of POT1 in mediating telomere end protection is further revealed by observations that deletion of SpPot1 results in catastrophic loss of telomeric DNA and cell death ( Baumann and Cech, 2001 ). Survivors emerge with circularized chromosomes, obviating the need for the telomeric protective function of Pot1a . In addition, conditional knockout of the mouse Pot1a gene leads to chromosomal fusions and initiation of replicative senescence ( Wu et al , 2006 ). These results indicate that POT1 is an integral telomere end protection protein, and that loss of POT1 results in dysfunctional telomeres that are targeted for chromosomal end-joining reactions.

POT1 is part of a complex of six core telomere-binding proteins termed the telosome ( Liu et al , 2004b ) or shelterin ( de Lange, 2005 ). Both human and mouse POT1 interacts with the TPP1 protein through its C-terminal domain, which in turn interacts with the protein TIN2 ( Kim et al , 2004 ; Liu et al , 2004a , 2004b ; Ye et al , 2004a , 2004b ; Wu et al , 2006 ). This protein complex can then interact with TRF1 or TRF2/Rap1 to form subcomplexes, although additional studies are required to determine the specific stochiometry of protein subunits ( Kim et al , 2004 ; Liu et al , 2004b ; Ye et al , 2004b ; Yang et al , 2005 ). As the only ss telomere binding protein in the complex, POT1 serves a critically important role by transducing telomere length information to the TRF1 complex ( Loayza and de Lange, 2003 ). Indeed, reduction of endogenous POT1 levels by siRNA knockdown ( Liu et al , 2004a ; Ye et al , 2004a ) or elimination of POT1 protein by a conditional knockout approach ( Wu et al , 2006 ) results in telomere length elongation. In addition, biochemical analyses using purified POT1 and telomerase demonstrated that POT1 negatively regulates telomerase activity in vitro by limiting its access to the terminal G residue of telomeres ( Kelleher et al , 2005 ; Lei et al , 2005 ). These results are consistent with POT1's function as a negative regulator of telomere length.

Several organisms possess more than one Pot gene, and recent data in plants suggest that different POT proteins may perform different functions in telomere maintenance ( Shakirov et al , 2005 ). In this study, we report the identification and characterization of POT1b, a second member of the mouse POT family. POT1b is highly homologous to POT1a and efficiently binds telomeric DNA in vitro via its conserved OB-folds. However, in contrast to POT1a, a truncated POT1b protein possessing only the OB-folds can efficiently localize to telomeres in vivo . Overexpression of a mutant allele of POT1b resulted in a potent DNA damage response at telomeres and the onset of a p53-dependent senescence phenotype. shRNA mediated depletion of Pot1b in the setting of Pot1 deficiency resulted in increased chromosomal aberrations. Our results indicate that POT1b plays important protective functions at telomeres and that proper maintenance of chromosomal stability requires both POT proteins.

Discussion

The data presented here indicate that POT1b, ss telomere binding protein, plays a role in repressing both NHEJ and HR at telomeres. The presence of two POT proteins in the mouse genome suggests that they may mediate distinct roles at telomeres. Our data suggest that POT1a negatively regulates telomere length ( Wu et al , 2006 ), while POT1b plays a role in maintaining the 3′ G-rich overhang.
