Nedd4-binding partner-1 (N4BP1) has been identified as a protein interactor and 
a substrate of the homologous to E6AP C terminus (HECT) domain-containing E3 
ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3), Nedd4. Here, we describe a previously 
unrecognized functional interaction between N4BP1 and Itch, a Nedd4 structurally 
related E3, which contains four WW domains, conferring substrate-binding 
activity. We show that N4BP1 association with the second WW domain (WW2) of Itch 
interferes with E3 binding to its substrates. In particular, we found that N4BP1 
and p73 alpha, a target of Itch-mediated ubiquitin/proteasome proteolysis, share 
the same binding site. By competing with p73 alpha for binding to the WW2 
domain, N4BP1 reduces the ability of Itch to recruit and ubiquitylate p73 alpha 
and inhibits Itch autoubiquitylation activity both in in vitro and in vivo 
ubiquitylation assays. Similarly, both c-Jun and p63 polyubiquitylation by Itch 
are inhibited by N4BP1. As a consequence, genetic and RNAi knockdown of N4BP1 
diminish the steady-state protein levels and significantly impair the 
transcriptional activity of Itch substrates. Notably, stress-induced induction 
of c-Jun was impaired in N4BP1(-/-) cells. These results demonstrate that N4BP1 
functions as a negative regulator of Itch. In addition, because inhibition of 
Itch by N4BP1 results in the stabilization of crucial cell death regulators such 
as p73 alpha and c-Jun, it is conceivable that N4BP1 may have a role in 
regulating tumor progression and the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy.
