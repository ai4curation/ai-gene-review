Membrane-bound mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TFP) catalyzes β-oxidation 
of long chain fatty acyl-CoAs, employing 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECH), 
3-hydroxyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HAD), and 3-ketothiolase (KT) activities 
consecutively. Inherited deficiency of TFP is a recessive genetic disease, 
manifesting in hypoketotic hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy, and sudden death. We 
have determined the crystal structure of human TFP at 3.6-Å resolution. The 
biological unit of the protein is α2β2 The overall structure of the 
heterotetramer is the same as that observed by cryo-EM methods. The two 
β-subunits make a tightly bound homodimer at the center, and two α-subunits are 
bound to each side of the β2 dimer, creating an arc, which binds on its concave 
side to the mitochondrial innermembrane. The catalytic residues in all three 
active sites are arranged similarly to those of the corresponding, soluble 
monofunctional enzymes. A structure-based, substrate channeling pathway from the 
ECH active site to the HAD and KT sites is proposed. The passage from the ECH 
site to the HAD site is similar to those found in the two bacterial TFPs. 
However, the passage from the HAD site to the KT site is unique in that the 
acyl-CoA intermediate can be transferred between the two sites by passing along 
the mitochondrial inner membrane using the hydrophobic nature of the acyl chain. 
The 3'-AMP-PPi moiety is guided by the positively charged residues located along 
the "ceiling" of the channel, suggesting that membrane integrity is an essential 
part of the channel and is required for the activity of the enzyme.
