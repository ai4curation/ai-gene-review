Recently, we have identified a novel epidermal growth factor receptor isoform 
(EGFRvA), which has higher tumor-promoting capacity than EGFR. However, the 
underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that EGFRvA is 
more stable than EGFR. Interestingly, we observe that EGFRvA binds less to E3 
ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl than EGFR does, although Y1045, a direct binding site of 
c-Cbl, is well phosphorylated in both of them. Further study reveals that EGFRvA 
cannot bind to Grb2, an important binding mediator between EGFR and c-Cbl. Thus, 
our study finds that EGFRvA is more stable than EGFR because of its decreased 
binding to c-Cbl.
