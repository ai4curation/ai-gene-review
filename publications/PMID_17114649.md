Activity-dependent protein phosphorylation is a highly dynamic yet tightly 
regulated process essential for cellular signaling. Although recognized as 
critical for neuronal functions, the extent and stoichiometry of phosphorylation 
in brain cells remain undetermined. In this study, we resolved 
activity-dependent changes in phosphorylation stoichiometry at specific sites in 
distinct subcellular compartments of brain cells. Following highly sensitive 
phosphopeptide enrichment using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and 
mass spectrometry, we isolated and identified 974 unique phosphorylation sites 
on 499 proteins, many of which are novel. To further explore the significance of 
specific phosphorylation sites, we used isobaric peptide labels and determined 
the absolute quantity of both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides of 
candidate phosphoproteins and estimated phosphorylation stoichiometry. The 
analyses of phosphorylation dynamics using differentially stimulated synaptic 
terminal preparations revealed activity-dependent changes in phosphorylation 
stoichiometry of target proteins. Using this method, we were able to 
differentiate between distinct isoforms of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein 
kinase (CaMKII) and identify a novel activity-regulated phosphorylation site on 
the glutamate receptor subunit GluR1. Together these data illustrate that mass 
spectrometry-based methods can be used to determine activity-dependent changes 
in phosphorylation stoichiometry on candidate phosphopeptides following large 
scale phosphoproteome analysis of brain tissue.
