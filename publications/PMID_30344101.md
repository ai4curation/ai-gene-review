Hundreds of clinics in India offer unproven stem cell therapies despite having 
remarkably stringent guidelines and regulations for fraudulent advertisements 
and clinical practice. We discuss the challenges with current regulations, how a 
recently proposed amendment may further legitimize unproven stem cell therapies, 
and discuss paths forward in a global context.
