Angiocidin, a matrix bound and tumor associated protein, has been shown to inhibit tumor progression and angiogenesis. We previously demonstrated that angiocidin binds to thrombospondin-1 and alpha2beta1 integrin. We now show that angiocidin binds and is a preferred substrate for tissue transglutaminase-2 (tTgase). Angiocidin bound tissue tTgase saturably with a Kd of 26 nM, while an angiocidin deletion mutant missing the matrix binding domain of angiocidin failed to bind tTgase. tTgase colocalized with angiocidin on endothelial cells. tTgase bound anti-angiocidin immunoprecipitates of endothelial cell lysates. Breast cancer cells expressing high levels of tTgase attached to angiocidin immobilized on tissue culture plates. Angiocidin was a preferred substrate for tTgase forming high molecular weight cross-linked multimers when treated with tTgase. Cross-linked angiocidin contained iso-peptide bonds as demonstrated by Western blotting and immunohistochemical colocalization studies using endothelial cells treated with angiocidin. Cross-linked angiocidin inhibited cell migration in contrast to monomeric angiocidin and inhibited localization of fibronectin (FN), a pro-tumorigenic matrix protein, into the extracellular matrix (ECM) of tumor and HUVE cells. Our studies provide an additional explanation for the anti- tumor activity of angiocidin suggesting that cross-linked angiocidin disrupts the tumor ECM making it less permissive for tumor growth.

Introduction

Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from the endothelium of pre-existing vasculature and is the main mechanism of vascularization during physiological processes such as embryonic development, growth, regeneration, and wound healing ( Folkman, 2006 ). This tightly controlled process in healthy tissues differs greatly from the perpetuation of neovascularization involved in a number of pathological processes including tumor growth, metastasis, diabetic retinopathy, and arthritis ( Folkman, 2002 ).

We isolated a protein from lung carcinoma by peptide affinity chromatography using a highly hydrophobic sequence from the type 1 repeat domain of thrombospondin-1, a matrix protein over-expressed in tumor stroma ( Tuszynski et al., 1993 ). The immunohistochemical localization of this protein showed selective expression on invasive cancer cells and capillary endothelial cells ( Arnoletti et al., 1994 ; Tuszynski and Nicosia, 1994 ; Wakiyama et al., 2001 ). These results suggested that the protein could function in mechanisms of metastasis and angiogenesis.

We cloned the full-length cDNA for this protein and expressed the protein in bacteria ( Zhou et al., 2004 ). The recombinant protein, referred to as angiocidin, had potent anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity. The recombinant angiocidin induced endothelial apoptosis when added to growth cultures of endothelial cells in full media or when cells were plated on angiocidin adsorbed on tissue culture plastic. Antibodies prepared against the recombinant angiocidin showed over-expression of angiocidin in hepatocellular carcinoma ( Poon et al., 2004 ), prostate, lung, bladder, and melanoma cancers ( Zhou et al., 2004 ). Angiocidin showed both matrix and cytoplasmic distribution. A Blast search of the full-length cDNA of angiocidin revealed that the protein sequence had a high degree of homology with S5a ( Young et al., 1998 ) and antisecretory factor ( Nilsson et al., 1992 ) but differed from them by three additional amino acids in its carboxyl terminus (G 255 ER 257 ). Since it is not clear how many genes encode for angiocidin and its homologues, we have elected to call our recombinant protein, angiocidin, based on its observed functional activity in inhibiting angiogenesis.

While the anti-angiogenic mechanism of action of angiocidin has not been fully characterized, we have observed that the exogenous application of the recombinant protein to endothelial cell culture inhibits adhesion, migration, and proliferation and that these activities are related to the ability of angiocidin to inhibit cell proteasome activity and cell-extracellular matrix interactions ( Dimitrov et al., 2005 ; Sabherwal et al., 2006 ). In a previous study, we made the interesting observation that angiocidin bound tissue transglutaminase-2 (tTgase) from endothelial cell lysates when passed over columns containing immobilized angiocidin ( Dimitrov et al., 2005 ). Establishing the significance of this observation is the topic of the present paper.

tTgase is an enzyme that catalyzes the cross-linking of proteins through an acyl transfer reaction between the c-carboxamide group of peptide-bound glutamine and the epsilon -amino group of peptide-bound lysine, resulting in an epsilon - lysine - carboxy glutamyl isopeptide bond ( Pisano et al., 1968 ). The chemical bond formed by tTgase catalysis is highly stable and is resistant to mechanical and proteolytic degradation.

tTgase is ubiquitously expressed in various tissue types, occurs in both an intracellular and extracellular form, and is highly expressed in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in the vasculature ( Sane et al., 2007 ). tTgase recognizes both intracellular and extracellular proteins with both intracellular and extracellular proteins modified post-translationally by tTgase. Despite the lack of a leader sequence, tTgase is secreted from cells externally and binds to the cell surface or extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, it has been implicated in the stabilization of the extracellular matrix and in cell–ECM interactions important in angiogenesis and cancer by cross-linking matrix proteins ( Belkin et al., 2001 ; Mehta, 2009 ). Under normal physiological conditions, tTgase externalized from cells becomes tightly bound to fibronectin (FN) and forms ternary complexes with collagens that function as a cementing substance in the ECM. This mechanism probably serves to clear the enzyme from the circulation to prevent it inducing adverse effects ( Esposito et al., 2005 ). The interactions between molecules that form heteromeric complexes in the ECM of specific tissues are stabilized by tTgase like FN, thrombospondin-1(TSP-1) and collagen ( Bale and Mosher, 1986 ; Mosher and Johnson, 1983 ).

Based on the ability of tTgase to remodel ECM and the importance of tumor matrix in mechanisms of angiogenesis and tumor progression, we postulate that the interaction of angiocidin with tTgase may contribute to the anti-angiogenic activity of angiocidin by remodeling the ECM. In this report, we provide evidence that angiocidin not only binds tTgase, but is a preferred substrate for tTgase forming a cross-linked angiocidin product both in the presence of cultured endothelial cells and in the tumor stroma. We show that cross-linked angiocidin inhibits the ECM incorporation of FN, an important component of the basement membrane that promotes tumor progession and angiogenesis ( Akerman et al., 2005 ). These results suggest that tTgase cross-linked angiocidin may significantly contribute to the anti-angiogenic activity of monomeric angiocidin by generating an ECM that is less permissive for tumor progression.

Discussion

Several experimental observations support the hypothesis that tTgase plays a role in the development of certain types of cancer. First, multiple studies have shown that the tTgase protein is up-regulated in cancerous tissue relative to adjacent healthy tissue such as glioblastomas ( Yuan et al., 2005 ), malignant melanomas ( Fok et al., 2006 ), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas ( Verma et al., 2006 ). Additionally, chemotherapeutic resistance and metastatic potential of certain cancers with tTgase expression levels have been correlated with therapeutic outcomes ( Verma and Mehta, 2007 ). tTgase has been shown to exert anti-apoptotic effects on cells while its down-regulation by siRNA inhibition or treatment with tTgase inhibitors makes these cells more sensitive to apoptosis ( Mangala and Mehta, 2005 ). In neoplasia, tTgase has been implicated in cancer progression with several different players, even though no unifying molecular mechanism has been established. Recent data suggest that intracellular tTgase is able to crosslink nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, IκBα, an inhibitory subunit of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, NF-κB. This would constitutively activate the transcription factor NF-κB and promote expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-xL and BFL1 ( Lee et al., 2004 ; Mann et al., 2006 ). Other data suggest that tTgase expression activates focal adhesion kinase, FAK, through a mechanism independent of its enzymatic activity. Activated FAK subsequently activates anti-apoptotic pathways and promotes a pro-survival PI3K/Akt pathway. The activation of FAK may lead to uncontrolled cell growth if constitutively activated ( Verma et al., 2006 ). Therefore, with the underlying molecular connection between tTgase expression and cancer poorly characterized, it is difficult to ascertain if tTgase inhibition has therapeutic potential in hindering tumorigenesis and metastatic spread ( Siegel and Khosla, 2007 ).

We isolated a tumor-associated protein from lung carcinoma extracts by affinity chromatography with CSVTCG, peptide fragment of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a matrix protein that has been implicated in mechanisms of tumor progression ( Tuszynski et al., 1993 ). The CSVTCG type I peptide repeats of TSP-1 are essential for many of the adhesive interactions that mediate cell adhesion, platelet aggregation, and tumor cell metastasis ( Tuszynski et al., 1992 ). The full-length cDNA of this binding protein was isolated from a prostate cancer cell (PC3-NI) cDNA library and the recombinant protein termed angiocidin was shown to be a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor progression ( Zhou et al., 2004 ). Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies prepared against the recombinant protein showed cellular distribution in both the ECM and cytoplasm. With these antibodies, immunohistochemical analysis of different tissues showed an over-expression of angiocidin in melanoma, breast, prostate, colon tumors ( Zhou et al., 2004 ). The full-length protein sequence angiocidin revealed that the protein sequence was nearly homologous with S5a, the major polyubiquitin recognition subunit of the eukaryotic 26S proteasome enzyme complex that binds polyubiquitin chains ( Deveraux et al., 1995 ) and anti-secretory factor, a regulatory protein which inhibits the intestinal fluid secretion induced by cholera toxin ( Johansson et al., 1995 ).

Our laboratory has been actively investigating the anti-tumor activity of angiocidin. We have discovered that the protein binds not only TSP-1 but other matrix proteins such as FN and type 1 collagen and the cell surface type 1 collagen receptor α2β1 ( Sabherwal et al., 2006 ). A 20 amino residue in the amino terminal end of angiocidin is necessary for its anti-tumor as well as its matrix and integrin binding activities ( Sabherwal et al., 2006 ). This domain may also signal activation of the NFκβ pathway which can initiate pathways of cell differentiation through the production of cytokines ( Gaurnier-Hausser et al., 2008 ).

While investigating the interaction of angiocidin with potential HUVE cell protein binding partners using angiocidin-affinity chromatography ( Dimitrov et al., 2005 ), we discovered that one of the protein bands that was eluted from the column was a 150 kDa protein whose tryptic fragments matched those of tissue transglutaminase 2 (tTgase) as revealed by mass spectral fingerprinting. In this study we have attempted to investigate the significance of this finding as it relates to the anti-tumor activity of recombinant angiocidin. We show here for the first time that angiocidin binds to purified tTgase and in endogenous tTgase present in cell extracts of HUVE cells ( Fig. 1A and B ). When added to growing cultures of HUVE cells, recombinant angiocidin rapidly co-localized with tTgase ( Fig. 1C ). The interaction of tTgase with angiocidin was further confirmed by adhesion studies with MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells expressing various levels of tTgase. We found that adhesion of these cells to angiocidin increased with increasing expression of tTgase ( Fig. 1D ).

Now that the interaction of angiocidin with tTgase has been established, the question then arises as to what the consequences of this interaction are? To answer this question we investigated whether recombinant angiocidin could act as a substrate for tTgase. We found that angiocidin could be rapidly crosslinked by tTgase forming a large molecular weight multimer that could not be resolved by SDS-PAGE and was observed at the top of the resolving gel or in the sample well ( Fig. 2A ). Using size exclusion chromatography, we estimate that the angiocidin multimer is in excess of 10 6 daltons (data not shown). The cross-linked angiocidin is truly an poly-isopeptide product of tTgase since it is recognized by an antibody against the isopeptide bond ( Fig. 2A ) and will not be generated by tTgase unless calcium ion, a divalent cation requirement for tTgase catalyzed isopeptide bond formation, is present. We also found that angiocidin is a preferred substrate for tTgase as is TSP-1 and FN showing complete cross-linking in 30 min under our experimental conditions, whereas laminin was not appreciably cross-linked under these conditions ( Fig. 2B ). A deletion mutant M1 of angiocidin missing residues F 86 -H 105 was not appreciably cross-linked by tTgase whereas another mutant missing residues I 36 -S 43 cross-linked as well as angiocidin ( Fig. 3A ). We conclude that Q 101 contained in the 20 residues F 86 -H 105 may be acting as the Q donor in the cross-linking reaction since a peptide containing residues F 86 -H 105 effectively inhibited tTgase-mediated cross-linking of angiocidin ( Fig. 3B ). These results are particularly significant and strongly suggest that tTgase-dependent cross-linking of angiocidin to the ECM may play a role in the anti-tumor activity of angiocidin because M1 has been shown not to bind to extracellular matrix or have anti-tumor activity( Sabherwal et al., 2006 ; Zhou et al., 2004 ).

The functional significance of tTgase –dependent cross-linking of angiocidin in HUVE cells was investigated using a motility assay. We found that monomeric angiocidin caused some inhibition of migration while in marked contrast cross-linked angiocidin was an effective barrier to cell migration when added to collagen causing an almost complete inhibition in cell migration ( Fig. 4 ). These results suggested that matrix barriers containing cross-linked angiocidin might inhibit tumor progression. To provide further evidence in support of this idea, we investigated whether exogenous recombinant angiocidin added to growing HUVE cultures was cross-linked. We found that addition of angiocidin to HUVE cultures promoted isopeptide bond formation ( Fig. 5A ) and that recombinant angiocidin appeared to contain isopeptide bonds based on co-localization of angiocidin and isopeptide bond staining ( Fig 5B ).

Since angiocidin appeared to be cross-linked by HUVE cells, we wanted to know if angiocidin competed with other matrix proteins for tTgase thereby changing the composition of the ECM. To answer this question, we treated HUVE cells with biotin cadaverine, a polyamine substrate for tTgase, which catalyzes the amination of an appropriate Q donor protein. The incorporation of labeled cadaverine into cells has been used to identify tTgase targets and activity in cell-based assays ( Summey et al., 2002 ). When HUVE cells were treated with biotin- cadaverine for 30 min and the cell lysate analyzed by SDS- PAGE and the blots subsequently probed with HRP-streptavidin, a major labeled band at 220 kDa was observed ( Fig 6A ). This band was identified as FN by Western blot analysis. When cells were treated with biotin-cadaverine in the presence of angiocidin or with an antibody against tTgase, cadaverine incorporation into FN decreased significantly while total FN levels were unchanged ( Fig. 6A ). When cells were stained for FN, we observed a decrease FN incorporation into the ECM with increased focal staining of FN in the cell cytoplasm either after treatment with angiocidin or after treatment with anti-tTgase antibody ( Fig. 6B and C ). These results suggested that angiocidin or anti-tTgase antibody disrupted incorporation of FN into the ECM, replacing an ECM rich in FN with one rich in angiocidin. Loss of FN from the ECM would be expected to be less permissive for microvessel formation and tumor and endothelial cell migration ( Ruoslahti, 1999 ).

To further investigate if such a mechanism might be operative in vivo , we compared the expression of FN, isopeptide bond formation, His-tag angiocidin in tumor tissue harvested from mice treated with angiocidin or buffer as described in a previously published study ( Sabherwal et al., 2006 ). We found that tumor tissue obtained from animals treated with an iv. injection of 1 mg/kg recombinant angiocidin every other day for two weeks expressed significantly more isopeptide bond formation, and less FN than controls ( Fig. 7 ). As expected His-tag angiocidin was only present in the angiocidin-treated animals and the pattern of isopeptide bond expression and His-tag angiocidin localization was very similar suggesting that angiocidin was cross-linked and sequestered in the tumor ECM.

Taken together the data presented in this paper suggest that recombinant angiocidin is a preferred substrate for tTgase and consequently can alter the tumor matrix making it less permissive for angiogenesis and cell migration. This activity together with its capacity to stimulate innate immunity ( Gaurnier-Hausser and Tuszynski, 2009 ) and differentiate tumor cells ( Gaurnier-Hausser et al., 2008 ) makes angiocidin an attractive candidate for development as a therapeutic for the inhibition of tumor progression.
