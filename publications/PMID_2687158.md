In humans, the functional F0F1-ATP synthase beta subunit gene is located on 
chromosome 12 in the p13----qter region. Other partially homologous sequences 
have been detected on chromosomes 2 and 17. The bona fide beta subunit gene has 
10 exons encoding a leader peptide of 49 amino acids and a mature protein of 480 
amino acids. Thirteen Alu family DNA repeats are found upstream from the gene 
and in four introns. The gene has four "CCAAT" sequences upstream and in close 
proximity to the transcriptional initiation site. A 13-bp motif is found in the 
5' nontranscribed region of both the beta subunit gene and an ADP/ATP 
translocator gene that is expressed in high levels in cardiac and skeletal 
muscle. Analysis of the beta subunit mRNA levels reveals marked differences 
among tissues. The highest levels are found in heart, lower levels in skeletal 
muscle, and the lowest levels in liver and kidney. These findings suggest that 
the tissue-specific levels of ATP synthase beta subunit mRNA may be generated 
through transcriptional control.
