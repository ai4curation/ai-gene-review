We have isolated lethal mutations in the Drosophila lkb1 gene (dlkb1), the 
homolog of C. elegans par-4 and human LKB1 (STK11), which is mutated in 
Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. We show that these mutations disrupt spindle formation, 
resulting in frequent polyploid cells in larval brains. In addition, dlkb1 
mutations affect asymmetric division of larval neuroblasts (NBs); they suppress 
unequal cytokinesis, abrogate proper localization of Bazooka, Par-6, DaPKC and 
Miranda, but affect neither Pins/Galphai localization nor spindle rotation. Most 
aspects of the dlkb1 phenotype are exacerbated in dlkb1 pins double mutants, 
which exhibit more severe defects than those observed in either single mutant. 
This suggests that Dlkb1 and Pins act in partially redundant pathways to control 
the asymmetry of NB divisions. Our results also indicate that Dlkb1 and Pins 
function in parallel pathways controlling the stability of spindle microtubules. 
The finding that Dlkb1 mediates both the geometry of stem cell division and 
chromosome segregation provides novel insight into the mechanisms underlying 
tumor formation in Peutz-Jeghers patients.
