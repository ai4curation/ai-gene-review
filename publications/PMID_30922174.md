RATIONALE: Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) optimizes systemic oxygen 
delivery by matching ventilation to perfusion. HPV is intrinsic to pulmonary 
artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Hypoxia dilates systemic arteries, 
including renal arteries. Hypoxia is sensed by changes in mitochondrial-derived 
reactive oxygen species, notably hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) ([H2O2]mito). 
Decreases in [H2O2]mito elevate pulmonary vascular tone by increasing 
intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) through reduction-oxidation regulation of ion 
channels. Although HPV is mimicked by the Complex I inhibitor, rotenone, the 
molecular identity of the O2 sensor is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of Ndufs2 (NADH [nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide] dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 2), Complex I's 
rotenone binding site, in pulmonary vascular oxygen-sensing.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Mitochondria-conditioned media from pulmonary and renal 
mitochondria isolated from normoxic and chronically hypoxic rats were infused 
into an isolated lung bioassay. Mitochondria-conditioned media from normoxic 
lungs contained more H2O2 than mitochondria-conditioned media from chronic 
hypoxic lungs or kidneys and uniquely attenuated HPV via a catalase-dependent 
mechanism. In PASMC, acute hypoxia decreased H2O2 within 112±7 seconds, 
followed, within 205±34 seconds, by increased intracellular calcium 
concentration, [Ca2+]i. Hypoxia had no effects on [Ca2+]i in renal artery SMC. 
Hypoxia decreases both cytosolic and mitochondrial H2O2 in PASMC while 
increasing cytosolic H2O2 in renal artery SMC. Ndufs2 expression was greater in 
PASMC versus renal artery SMC. Lung Ndufs2 cysteine residues became reduced 
during acute hypoxia and both hypoxia and reducing agents caused functional 
inhibition of Complex I. In PASMC, siNdufs2 (cells/tissue treated with Ndufs2 
siRNA) decreased normoxic H2O2, prevented hypoxic increases in [Ca2+]i, and 
mimicked aspects of chronic hypoxia, including decreasing Complex I activity, 
elevating the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH/NAD+) ratio and decreasing 
expression of the O2-sensitive ion channel, Kv1.5. Knocking down another Fe-S 
center within Complex I (Ndufs1, NADH [nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide] 
dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 1) or other mitochondrial 
subunits proposed as putative oxygen sensors (Complex III's Rieske Fe-S center 
and COX4i2 [cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 isoform 2] in Complex IV) had no 
effect on hypoxic increases in [Ca2+]i. In vivo, siNdufs2 significantly 
decreased hypoxia- and rotenone-induced constriction while enhancing 
phenylephrine-induced constriction.
CONCLUSIONS: Ndufs2 is essential for oxygen-sensing and HPV.
