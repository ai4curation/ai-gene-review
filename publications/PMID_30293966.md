Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are a ubiquitous family of molecular 
chaperones that rescue misfolded proteins from irreversible aggregation during 
cellular stress. Many such sHsps exist as large polydisperse species in 
solution, and a rapid dynamic subunit exchange between oligomeric and 
dissociated forms modulates their function under a variety of stress conditions. 
Here, we investigated the structural and functional properties of Hsp20 from 
thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. To provide a framework 
for investigating the structure-function relationship of Hsp20 and understanding 
its dynamic nature, we employed several biophysical and biochemical techniques. 
Our data suggested the existence of a ~24-mer of Hsp20 at room temperature 
(25 °C) and a higher oligomeric form at higher temperature (50 °C-70 °C) and 
lower pH (3.0-5.0). To our surprise, we identified a dimeric form of protein as 
the functional conformation in the presence of aggregating substrate proteins. 
The hydrophobic microenvironment mainly regulates the oligomeric plasticity of 
Hsp20, and it plays a key role in the protection of stress-induced protein 
aggregation. In Sulfolobus sp., Hsp20, despite being a non-secreted protein, has 
been reported to be present in secretory vesicles and it is still unclear 
whether it stabilizes substrate proteins or membrane lipids within the secreted 
vesicles. To address such an issue, we tested the ability of Hsp20 to interact 
with membrane lipids along with its ability to modulate membrane fluidity. Our 
data revealed that Hsp20 interacts with membrane lipids via a hydrophobic 
interaction and it lowers the propensity of in vitro phase transition of 
bacterial and archaeal lipids.
