A quality control system in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) efficiently 
discriminates polypeptides that are in the process of productive folding from 
conformers that are trapped in an aberrant state. Only the latter are 
transported into the cytoplasm and degraded in a process termed ER-associated 
protein degradation (ERAD). In the ER, an enzymatic cascade generates a specific 
N-glycan structure of seven mannosyl and two N-acetylglucosamine residues 
(Man7GlcNAc2) on misfolded glycoproteins to facilitate their disposal. We show 
that a complex encompassing the yeast lectin-like protein Htm1 and the 
oxidoreductase Pdi1 converts Man8GlcNAc2 on glycoproteins into the Man7GlcNAc2 
signal. In vitro the Htm1-Pdi1 complex processes both unfolded and native 
proteins albeit with a preference for the former. In vivo, elevated expression 
of HTM1 causes glycan trimming on misfolded and folded proteins, but only 
degradation of the non-native species is accelerated. Thus, modification with a 
Man7GlcNAc2 structure does not inevitably commit a protein for ER-associated 
protein degradation. The function of Htm1 in ERAD relies on its association with 
Pdi1, which appears to regulate the access to substrates. Our data support a 
model in which the balanced activities of Pdi1 and Htm1 are crucial determinants 
for the efficient removal of misfolded secretory glycoproteins.
