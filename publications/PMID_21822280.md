To our knowledge, no structural study to date has characterized, in an intact 
receptor, the coupling of conformational change in extracellular domains through 
a single-pass transmembrane domain to conformational change in cytoplasmic 
domains. Here we examine such coupling, and its unexpected complexity, using 
nearly full-length epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and negative-stain 
EM. The liganded, dimeric EGFR ectodomain can couple both to putatively active, 
asymmetrically associated kinase dimers and to putatively inactive, 
symmetrically associated kinase dimers and monomers. Inhibitors that stabilize 
the active or inactive conformation of the kinase active site, as well as 
mutations in the kinase dimer interface and a juxtamembrane phosphorylation 
site, shift the equilibrium among the three kinase association states. This 
coupling of one conformation of an activated receptor ectodomain to multiple 
kinase-domain arrangements reveals previously unanticipated complexity in 
transmembrane signaling and facilitates regulation of receptor function in the 
juxtamembrane and cytoplasmic environments.

Abstract

To our knowledge, no structural study to date has characterized, in an intact receptor, the coupling of conformational change in extracellular domains through a single-pass transmembrane domain to conformational change in cytoplasmic domains. Here we examine such coupling, and its unexpected complexity, using nearly full-length epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and negative-stain EM. The liganded, dimeric EGFR ectodomain can couple both to putatively active, asymmetrically associated kinase dimers and to putatively inactive, symmetrically associated kinase dimers and monomers. Inhibitors that stabilize the active or inactive conformation of the kinase active site, as well as mutations in the kinase dimer interface and a juxtamembrane phosphorylation site, shift the equilibrium among the three kinase association states. This coupling of one conformation of an activated receptor ectodomain to multiple kinase-domain arrangements reveals previously unanticipated complexity in transmembrane signaling and facilitates regulation of receptor function in the juxtamembrane and cytoplasmic environments.

DISCUSSION

We have provided the first structures, to our knowledge, that simultaneously reveal the conformations of the ectodomain and the cytoplasmic domain in a receptor that has separate domains connected by a single-pass transmembrane domain. The unliganded EGFR was largely monomeric and showed the tethered, autoinhibited conformation of the extracellular domain seen in crystal structures 4 , 5 . The EGF-liganded receptor was largely dimeric and showed the dimeric conformation of the ectodomain as well as two distinct dimeric states and one unassociated state of the kinase domain.

Together with crystal structures 1 – 6 , our results suggest that two types of kinase-domain conformation exist in dimeric EGF–EGFR complexes: inactive and active conformations, present in symmetric and asymmetric kinase-domain dimers, respectively. A third, unassociated kinase-domain state observed in presence of mutations and inhibitors may hint at yet a third conformational state of the kinase domain. Relative to our previous EM studies 12 , the structural detail present in the kinase-domain moiety here was greatly improved owing to the use of the lowest DDM concentration that enables fractionation by gel filtration (and that also preserves kinase activity 12 ) and because only 5–7 h elapsed between cell lysis and application of purified EGFR to EM grids. However, an important caveat is that although the nonionic detergents used here probably preserve overall features such as the predicted α-helices in the transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains, they differ in curvature and charge distribution from lipid bilayers and are imperfect membrane mimics.

A rod-like kinase-domain dimer connected at one end to the EGFR ectodomain demonstrated asymmetric dimerization of the kinase domains and cross-correlated well with an asymmetric dimer seen in crystals 3 . Mutagenesis has shown that kinase association through the asymmetric interface is closely linked to activation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity 3 ; here mutation also blocked formation of the asymmetric kinase dimer seen in EM. Our results in nearly full-length, intact EGF receptors directly confirm the remarkable idea, previously suggested on the basis of crystal structures of the isolated extracellular and kinase domains, that the symmetric, liganded ectodomain dimer is linked to an asymmetric kinase-domain dimer (refs. 3 , 6 ). In better-resolved class averages, the long axes of the ectodomain and asymmetric kinase dimer approached perpendicular. This orientation would place both kinase domains in proximity to the inner face of the plasma membrane. A similar orientation of the kinase domains has been proposed on the basis of crystal, mutagenesis and modeling studies 6 .

We also observed both a distinct, symmetric-like kinase dimer that cross-correlated well with symmetric dimers seen in crystal structures and also an unassociated, monomeric kinase state. The inhibitors PD168393 and gefitinib, known to favor the active kinase-domain conformation 19 increased the proportion of asymmetric kinase dimer. Conversely, two inhibitors, lapatinib and HKI-272, that stabilize the kinase active site in an inactive conformation abolished the asymmetric kinase dimer. In the presence of the latter inhibitors, the dimeric ectodomain was either associated with the symmetric kinase dimer and unassociated kinase monomers (lapatinib) or associated almost exclusively with unassociated kinase monomers (HKI-272).

In all class averages with dimeric ectodomains and kinase domains, the positions of the ectodomains and kinase domains in projections were consistent with their being on opposite sides of an imaginary plasma-membrane projection. However, in class averages with monomeric kinase domains, the positions of kinase domains were much more variable and included nonphysiologic positions proximal to the ectodomain. The two kinase domains were also sometimes distant from each other. These results are consistent not only with a lack of dimerization of the kinase domains but also with a lack of dimerization of the 34-residue juxtamembrane linkers between the transmembrane and kinase domains. Notably, despite the absence of a plasma-membrane barrier, the kinase domains in asymmetric and symmetric dimers oriented in two-dimensional projections on the opposite side of a putative transmembrane and juxtamembrane domain density from the ectodomain. This may reflect shortening of the juxtamembrane region by its participation in the kinase-domain dimer interface and, in the case of the asymmetric kinase dimer, additional antiparallel interactions between the N-terminal segments of the juxtamembrane regions that potentiate dimerization 6 .

Our observation that one overall extracellular domain conformation can couple to multiple intracellular domain arrangements contrasts with a previously widely held notion: that ligand binding would induce a specific, dimeric conformation of the extracellular domain, which in turn would be transmitted through the membrane to promote a specific, dimeric conformation of the intracellular domain. However, the lack of a requirement for a fixed orientation between the EGFR ectodomain and kinase domain is consistent with early evidence for triggering by antibodies to different ectodomain epitopes, by truncation of the ectodomain in the V- erb B avian oncogene and by insertion in the ectodomain (see ref. 21 and references therein). Furthermore, we have found that no specific transmembrane α-helical interface is required for EGFR activation 13 .

Linking one ligand-bound ectodomain conformation with multiple kinase-domain arrangements provides more scope for regulation of EGFR activity. Regulation is known to be highly complex and to operate on many levels, including phosphorylation of threonine and serine residues in the juxtamembrane region 9 , 10 , 22 – 25 . Furthermore, activity is regulated through binding of inhibitory factors such as Mig-6 (refs. 22 , 23 ), ubiquitination 26 and internalization followed by degradation or recycling 24 , 25 . These processes might alter the populations of the three different kinase association states visualized here or select for states. We have found that mutation to aspartate of two juxtamembrane residues known to be phosphorylated in vivo , Thr669 and Ser671 (refs. 14 , 15 ), inhibits kinase activity and asymmetric dimer formation; double mutation to alanine of these residues has also been reported to be inhibitory 15 . Further mutations showed that Ser671, but not Thr669, is required for kinase activity, and that both S671A and S671D mutations are inhibitory ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ). Notably, the side chain of Ser671, but not that of Thr669, is in the asymmetric kinase dimer interface 6 , 7 . Furthermore, a side chain hydrogen bond between Ser671 of one kinase monomer and Asp950 of the other monomer 7 is consistent with inhibition by both the S671A mutation and the phosphomimetic S671D mutation, and predicts inhibition by phosphorylation in vivo .

Our study also has implications for small-molecule therapeutics targeting EGFR, several of which, including lapatinib, are approved for treatment of cancer 27 . All of these bind to the active site and block kinase activity. However, we have shown that inhibitors with different effects on the conformation around the kinase active site have very different effects on the state of association of the kinase domain in liganded receptors. These different association states could have distinct downstream effects, such as on receptor internalization and degradation, with important clinical consequences.
