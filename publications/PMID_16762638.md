BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hints, histidine triad nucleotide-binding proteins, are 
adenosine monophosphate-lysine hydrolases of uncertain biological function. Here 
we report the characterization of human Hint2.
METHODS: Tissue distribution was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction and immunoblotting, cellular localization by immunocytochemistry, 
and transfection with green fluorescent protein constructs. Enzymatic activities 
for protein kinase C and adenosine phosphoramidase in the presence of Hint2 were 
measured. HepG2 cell lines with Hint2 overexpressed or knocked down were 
established. Apoptosis was assessed by immunoblotting for caspases and by flow 
cytometry. Tumor growth was measured in SCID mice. Expression in human tumors 
was investigated by microarrays.
RESULTS: Hint2 was predominantly expressed in liver and pancreas. Hint2 was 
localized in mitochondria. Hint2 hydrolyzed adenosine monophosphate linked to an 
amino group (AMP-pNA; k(cat):0.0223 s(-1); Km:128 micromol/L). Exposed to 
apoptotic stress, fewer HepG2 cells overexpressing Hint2 remained viable (32.2 
+/- 0.6% vs 57.7 +/- 4.6%), and more cells displayed changes of the 
mitochondrial membrane potential (87.8 +/- 2.35 vs 49.7 +/- 1.6%) with more 
cleaved caspases than control cells. The opposite was observed in HepG2 cells 
with knockdown expression of Hint2. Subcutaneous injection of HepG2 cells 
overexpressing Hint2 in SCID mice resulted in smaller tumors (0.32 +/- 0.13 g vs 
0.85 +/- 0.35 g). Microarray analyses revealed that HINT2 messenger RNA is 
downregulated in hepatocellular carcinomas (-0.42 +/- 0.58 log2 vs -0.11 +/- 
0.28 log2). Low abundance of HINT2 messenger RNA was associated with poor 
survival.
CONCLUSION: Hint2 defines a novel class of mitochondrial apoptotic sensitizers 
down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma.
