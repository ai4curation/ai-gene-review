A cyclin B homolog was identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using degenerate 
oligonucleotides and the polymerase chain reaction. The protein, designated 
Scb1, has a high degree of similarity with B-type cyclins from organisms ranging 
from fission yeast to human. Levels of SCB1 mRNA and protein were found to be 
periodic through the cell cycle, with maximum accumulation late, most likely in 
the G2 interval. Deletion of the gene was found not to be lethal, and 
subsequently other B-type cyclins have been found in yeast functionally 
redundant with Scb1. A mutant allele of SCB1 that removes an amino-terminal 
fragment of the encoded protein thought to be required for efficient degradation 
during mitosis confers a mitotic arrest phenotype. This arrest can be reversed 
by inactivation of the Cdc28 protein kinase, suggesting that cyclin-mediated 
arrest results from persistent protein kinase activation.
