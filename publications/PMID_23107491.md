The heat shock transcription factor (HSF) is a conserved regulator of heat 
shock-inducible gene expression. Organismal roles for HSF in physiological 
processes such as development, aging, and immunity have been defined largely 
through studies of the single Caenorhabditis elegans HSF homolog, hsf-1. 
However, the molecular and cell biological properties of hsf-1 in C. elegans are 
incompletely understood. We generated animals expressing physiological levels of 
an HSF-1::GFP fusion protein and examined its function, localization, and 
regulation in vivo. HSF-1::GFP was functional, as measured by its ability to 
rescue phenotypes associated with two hsf-1 mutant alleles. Rescue of hsf-1 
development phenotypes was abolished in a DNA-binding-deficient mutant, 
demonstrating that the transcriptional targets of hsf-1 are critical to its 
function even in the absence of stress. Under nonstress conditions, HSF-1::GFP 
was found primarily in the nucleus. Following heat shock, HSF-1::GFP rapidly and 
reversibly redistributed into dynamic, subnuclear structures that share many 
properties with human nuclear stress granules, including colocalization with 
markers of active transcription. Rapid formation of HSF-1 stress granules 
required HSF-1 DNA-binding activity, and the threshold for stress granule 
formation was altered by growth temperature. HSF-1 stress granule formation was 
not induced by inhibition of IGF signaling, a pathway previously suggested to 
function upstream of hsf-1. Our findings suggest that development, stress, and 
aging pathways may regulate HSF-1 function in distinct ways, and that HSF-1 
nuclear stress granule formation is an evolutionarily conserved aspect of HSF-1 
regulation in vivo.
