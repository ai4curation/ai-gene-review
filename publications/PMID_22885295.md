In Escherichia coli, cell division is performed by a multimolecular machinery 
called the divisome, made of 10 essential proteins and more than 20 accessory 
proteins. Through a bacterial two-hybrid library screen, we identified the E. 
coli β-lactam resistance protein Blr, a short membrane polypeptide of 41 
residues, as an interacting partner of the essential cell division protein FtsL. 
In addition to FtsL, Blr was found to associate with several other divisomal 
proteins, including FtsI, FtsK, FtsN, FtsQ, FtsW, and YmgF. Using fluorescently 
tagged Blr, we showed that this peptide localizes to the division septum and 
that its colocalization requires the presence of the late division protein FtsN. 
Although Blr is not essential, previous studies have shown that the inactivation 
of the blr gene increased the sensitivity of bacteria to β-lactam antibiotics or 
their resistance to cell envelope stress. Here, we found that Blr, when 
overproduced, restores the viability of E. coli ftsQ1(Ts) cells, carrying a 
thermosensitive allele of the ftsQ gene, during growth under 
low-osmotic-strength conditions (e.g., in synthetic media or in Luria-Bertani 
broth without NaCl). In contrast, the inactivation of blr increases the 
osmosensitivity of ftsQ1(Ts) cells, and blr ftsQ1 double mutants exhibit 
filamentous growth in LB broth even at a moderate salt concentration (0.5% NaCl) 
compared to parental ftsQ1(Ts) cells. Altogether, our results suggest that the 
small membrane polypeptide Blr is a novel component of the E. coli cell division 
apparatus involved in the stabilization of the divisome under certain stress 
conditions.
