Phosphorylation events play a crucial role in Raf activation. Phosphorylation of 
serines 259 and 621 in C-Raf and serines 364 and 728 in B-Raf has been suggested 
to be critical for association with 14-3-3 proteins. To study the functional 
consequences of Raf phosphorylations at these positions, we developed and 
characterized phosphospecific antibodies directed against 14-3-3 binding 
epitopes: a monoclonal phosphospecific antibody (6B4) directed against pS621 and 
a polyclonal antibody specific for B-Raf-pS364 epitope. Although 6B4 detected 
both C- and B-Raf in Western blots, it specifically recognizes the native form 
of C-Raf but not B-Raf. Contrary to B-Raf, a kinase-dead mutant of C-Raf was 
found to be only poorly phosphorylated in the Ser-621 position. Moreover, serine 
259 to alanine mutation prevented the Ser-621 phosphorylation suggesting an 
interdependence between these two 14-3-3 binding domains. Direct C-Raf.14-3-3 
binding studies with purified proteins combined with competition assays revealed 
that the 14-3-3 binding domain surrounding pS621 represents the high affinity 
binding site, whereas the pS259 epitope mediates lower affinity binding. Raf 
isozymes differ in their 14-3-3 association rates. The time course of endogenous 
C-Raf activation in mammalian cells by nerve growth factor (NGF) has been 
examined using both phosphospecific antibodies directed against 14-3-3 binding 
sites (6B4 and anti-pS259) as well as phosphospecific antibodies directed 
against the activation domain (anti-pS338 and anti-pY340/pY341). Time course of 
Ser-621 phosphorylation, in contrast to Ser-259 phosphorylation, exhibited 
unexpected pattern reaching maximal phosphorylation within 30 s of NGF 
stimulation. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 340/341 reached maximal levels 
subsequent to Ser-621 phosphorylation and was coincident with emergence of 
kinase activity. Taken together, we found substantial differences between 
C-Raf.14-3-3 binding epitopes pS259 and pS621 and visualized for the first time 
the sequence of the essential C-Raf phosphorylation events in mammalian cells in 
response to growth factor stimulation.
