The breast and ovarian tumor suppressor BRCA1 constitutes a RING heterodimer E3 
ligase with BARD1. BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a ubiquitin 
COOH-terminal hydrolase that was initially identified as a protein that bound to 
the RING finger domain of BRCA1. However, how BAP1 contributes to the E3 
activity of BRCA1/BARD1 is unclear. Here, we report that BAP1 interacts with 
BARD1 to inhibit the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1/BARD1. Domains comprised by 
residues 182-365 of BAP1 interact with the RING finger domain of BARD1, and 
surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (BIAcore) analyses showed that BAP1 
interferes with the BRCA1/BARD1 association. The perturbation resulted in 
inhibition of BRCA1 autoubiquitination and NPM1/B23 ubiquitination by 
BRCA1/BARD1. Although BAP1 was capable of deubiquitinating the polyubiquitin 
chains mediated by BRCA1/BARD1 in vitro, a catalytically inactive mutant of 
BAP1, C91S, still inhibited the ubiquitination in vitro and in vivo, implicating 
a second mechanism of action. Importantly, inhibition of BAP1 expression by 
short hairpin RNA resulted in hypersensitivity of the cells to ionizing 
irradiation and in retardation of S-phase progression. Together, these results 
suggest that BAP1 and BRCA1/BARD1 coordinately regulate ubiquitination during 
the DNA damage response and the cell cycle.

Abstract

BRCA1-associated protein 1 ( BAP1 ) is a tumor suppressor gene that was first identified in 1998. Germline loss of functional variants in BAP1 is associated with a tumor predisposition syndrome with at least four cancers; uveal melanoma (UM), malignant mesothelioma (MMe), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and cutaneous melanoma (CM). Furthermore, somatic BAP1 mutations are important drivers for several cancers most notably UM, MMe, RCC, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Emerging evidence substantiates the fundamental role of BAP1 in suppressing cancer initiation and progression by tuning DNA damage repair, apoptosis, ferroptosis, immune response, Warburg phenomenon, and metastasis. Multiple treatment strategies such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibitors, alkylating agents, and immunotherapy have been used as potential therapies for BAP1 -mutated tumors. Although these agents showed promising results in BAP1 -mutated tumors in preclinical studies, the results of most clinical trials are still dismal. The objectives of this review are to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the biological functions of BAP1, the implications of these functions in tumorigenesis and the current progress in BAP1-targeted therapy.

1. Introduction

BRCA-1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) was first cloned in 1998 by Rauscher and his group. It is a unique ubiquitin C terminal hydrolase (UCH), a member of the deubiquitylase (DUB) family of proteins, that removes ubiquitin from target proteins. Initially, BAP1 was discovered as a protein that directly interacts with the ring finger domain of BRCA1 [ 1 , 2 ]. However, subsequent research revealed that BAP1 interacts with BARD1, rather than directly with BRCA1, to inhibit the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1/BARD1 [ 3 , 4 ]. At the genomic level, BAP1 maps to the short arm (p) of chromosome 3 at position 21.1 (3p21.1), comprises approximately 9 kilobases, and contains 17 exons that encode for a 729 amino acids protein [ 5 ]. At the proteomic level, BAP1 contains a catalytic ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH) domain located within 240 amino acids of the N-terminal region. BAP1 has two different nuclear localization signals (NLS) located within the C-terminal region (656 – 661 and 717 – 722 amino acids) with the more distal one believed to play a critical role in its nuclear localization [ 6 , 7 ]. In addition, multiple protein-binding domains have been identified including binding domains to HCF1, YY1, BRCA1, FOXK1/2, BARD1, and ASXL1/2. The presence of multiple protein-binding domains along with the UCH catalytic domain may explain the multifaceted role of BAP1 in regulating different biological functions ( Figure 1 ) [ 5 , 8 ].

BAP1 has been identified as a part of the polycomb group (PcG) proteins. This family comprises three major complexes: polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1/2) and polycomb repressive deubiquitylase complex (PR-DUB). PcG complexes play a fundamental role in the regulation of chromatin remodeling and transcription repression. PCR1 has an E3 ubiquitin ligase that monoubiquitylates histone 2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119), whereas PCR2 is a methyltransferase that catalyzes the methylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27) [ 9 , 10 ]. BAP1 is a major component of PR-DUB complex, a multiprotein complex composed of HCF1, FOXK1/2, OGT, MBD5/6, LSD2 and ASXL1/2/3. The catalytic activity of BAP1 counteracts PRC1 function by deubiquitylating H2A119Kub [ 6 , 11 ]. Initially, it was believed that BAP1 functions are solely mediated through its nuclear localization, where it can interact with several proteins to orchestrate chromatin remodeling, transcription, cell cycle regulation and double strand DNA damage repair. However, subsequent studies have revealed that cytoplasmic function of BAP1 also plays a fundamental role in BAP1 tumor suppressor action via regulating apoptosis, aerobic glycolysis, immune response, and ferroptosis [ 8 , 12 , 13 ].

It is worthy to mention that BAP1 mutations are important drivers for tumorigenesis in many cancers. Somatic mutations are observed in up to 60% of tumors such as mesothelioma and up to 47% of uveal melanoma (UM). Moreover, germline BAP1 mutations are associated with a highly penetrant tumor predisposition syndrome (BAP1-TPDS) with four main cancers: UM, mesothelioma, cutaneous melanoma (CM) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Biallelic inactivation of BAP1 is observed in tumors whether the first hit is germline or somatic [ 14 – 18 ]. This highlights the critical need for identifying BAP1-targeted therapies to manage BAP1 mutated cancers and prevent cancer development in BAP1 carriers. Although several recent reviews have detailed the various functions of BAP1, the use of BAP1 to predict the response to anticancer therapy is not well summarized. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the biological functions of BAP1, potential use of BAP1 signature in therapeutics, and advances in the field of targeted therapy of BAP1 mutated tumors.

8. Conclusions

BAP1 is an important tumor suppressor gene with germline loss of function mutations predisposing carriers to a highly penetrant tumor predisposition syndrome with at least four cancers UM, MMe, RCC and CM. Several other cancers in particular intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and atypical meningioma have been observed in germline BAP1 mutation carriers but their association with the syndrome is still not confirmed. Somatic BAP1 mutations occur more frequently than germline mutations and have been observed in up to 60% of MMe, 47% of UM, 15% of RCC, and other cancers. Except for MMe, tumors associated with somatic BAP1 mutations exhibit aggressive phenotype with shorter overall survival and higher tendency to metastasis. BAP1 plays a critical role in regulating multiple pathways important for tumor initiation and progression including DNA damage repair, apoptosis, ferroptosis, immune response, and aerobic glycolysis. BAP1 role in tumorigenesis is complex and likely includes a combination of genomic instability through both defective DNA damage repair and apoptosis resistance, immune suppression, impaired ferroptosis, and enhanced Warburg effect ( Figure 5 ).

Multiple treatment strategies such as PARP inhibitors, EZH2 blockers, HDAC inhibitors, alkylating agents, and immunotherapy have been utilized as potential targets for therapy in BAP1 -mutated tumors. Although several preclinical studies emphasized the significant role of BAP1 in therapeutics, the outcome of clinical trials is still unsatisfactory. The success so far is limited by samples size and lack of patients’ stratification based on BAP1 status. The use of combination therapies in particular PARP inhibitors/immunotherapy, EZH2 inhibitors/mevalonate pathway blockers, and immunotherapy/alkylating agents could improve the outcome in patients with BAP1 mutated tumors. Prospective clinical trials in diseases with common BAP1 mutations such as MMe, UM, RCC, ICC and HCC should consider stratification of patients based on their BAP1 mutation status. Understanding the cancer biology of BAP1 will help to develop preventive strategies for the highly penetrant cancer predisposition in germline BAP1 -mutation carriers.
