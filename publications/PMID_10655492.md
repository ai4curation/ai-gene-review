cerevisiae, is required for ER exit of the high-affinity phosphate transporter 
Pho84p.

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PHO84 and PHO86 are among the 
genes that are most highly induced in response to phosphate starvation. They are 
essential for growth when phosphate is limiting, and they function in the 
high-affinity phosphate uptake system. PHO84 encodes a high-affinity phosphate 
transporter, and mutations in PHO86 cause many of the same phenotypes as 
mutations in PHO84, including a phosphate uptake defect and constitutive 
expression of the secreted acid phosphatase, Pho5p. Here, we show that the 
subcellular localization of Pho84p is regulated in response to extracellular 
phosphate levels; it is localized to the plasma membrane in low-phosphate medium 
but quickly endocytosed and transported to the vacuole upon addition of 
phosphate to the medium. Moreover, Pho84p is localized to the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) and fails to be targeted to the plasma membrane in the absence of 
Pho86p. Utilizing an in vitro vesicle budding assay, we demonstrate that Pho86p 
is required for packaging of Pho84p into COPII vesicles. Pho86p is an ER 
resident protein, which itself is not transported out of the ER. Interestingly, 
the requirement of Pho86p for ER exit is specific to Pho84p, because other 
members of the hexose transporter family to which Pho84 belongs are not 
mislocalized in the absence of Pho86p.
