Sugars modulate many vital processes that are also controlled by hormones during 
plant growth and development. Characterization of sugar-signalling mutants in 
Arabidopsis has unravelled a complex signalling network that links sugar 
responses to two plant stress hormones--abscisic acid and ethylene--in opposite 
ways. Recent molecular analyses have revealed direct, extensive glucose control 
of abscisic acid biosynthesis and signalling genes that partially antagonizes 
ethylene signalling during seedling development under light. Glucose and 
abscisic acid promote growth at low concentrations but act synergistically to 
inhibit growth at high concentrations. The effects of sugar and osmotic stress 
on morphogenesis and gene expression are distinct. The plasticity of plant 
growth and development are exemplified by the complex interplay of sugar and 
hormone signalling.
