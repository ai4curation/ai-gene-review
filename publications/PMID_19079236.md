Aberrant folding of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum activates the 
bifunctional transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease Ire1. Ire1 excises an intron 
from HAC1 messenger RNA in yeasts and Xbp1 messenger RNA in metozoans encoding 
homologous transcription factors. This non-conventional mRNA splicing event 
initiates the unfolded protein response, a transcriptional program that relieves 
the endoplasmic reticulum stress. Here we show that oligomerization is central 
to Ire1 function and is an intrinsic attribute of its cytosolic domains. We 
obtained the 3.2-A crystal structure of the oligomer of the Ire1 cytosolic 
domains in complex with a kinase inhibitor that acts as a potent activator of 
the Ire1 RNase. The structure reveals a rod-shaped assembly that has no known 
precedence among kinases. This assembly positions the kinase domain for 
trans-autophosphorylation, orders the RNase domain, and creates an interaction 
surface for binding of the mRNA substrate. Activation of Ire1 through 
oligomerization expands the mechanistic repertoire of kinase-based signalling 
receptors.
