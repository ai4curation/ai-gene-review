BACKGROUND: Alix/Bro1p family proteins have recently been identified as 
important components of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) and are involved in the 
sorting of endocytosed integral membrane proteins, interacting with components 
of the ESCRT complex, the unconventional phospholipid LBPA, and other known 
endocytosis regulators. During infection, Alix can be co-opted by enveloped 
retroviruses, including HIV, providing an important function during virus 
budding from the plasma membrane. In addition, Alix is associated with the actin 
cytoskeleton and might regulate cytoskeletal dynamics.
RESULTS: Here we demonstrate a novel physical interaction between the only 
apparent Alix/Bro1p family protein in C. elegans, ALX-1, and a key regulator of 
receptor recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane, called RME-1. The 
analysis of alx-1 mutants indicates that ALX-1 is required for the endocytic 
recycling of specific basolateral cargo in the C. elegans intestine, a pathway 
previously defined by the analysis of rme-1 mutants. The expression of truncated 
human Alix in HeLa cells disrupts the recycling of major histocompatibility 
complex class I, a known Ehd1/RME-1-dependent transport step, suggesting the 
phylogenetic conservation of this function. We show that the interaction of 
ALX-1 with RME-1 in C. elegans, mediated by RME-1/YPSL and ALX-1/NPF motifs, is 
required for this recycling process. In the C. elegans intestine, ALX-1 
localizes to both recycling endosomes and MVEs, but the ALX-1/RME-1 interaction 
appears to be dispensable for ALX-1 function in MVEs and/or late endosomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This work provides the first demonstration of a requirement for an 
Alix/Bro1p family member in the endocytic recycling pathway in association with 
the recycling regulator RME-1.
