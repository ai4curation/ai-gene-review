Microtubules (MTs) are crucial for both the establishment of cellular polarity 
and the progression of all mitotic phases leading to karyokinesis and 
cytokinesis. MT organization and spindle formation rely on the activity of 
γ-tubulin and associated proteins throughout the cell cycle. To date, the 
molecular mechanisms modulating γ-tubulin complex location remain largely 
unknown. In this work, two Arabidopsis thaliana proteins interacting with 
gamma-tubulin complex protein3 (GCP3), GCP3-interacting protein1 (GIP1) and 
GIP2, have been characterized. Both GIP genes are ubiquitously expressed in all 
tissues analyzed. Immunolocalization studies combined with the expression of 
GIP-green fluorescent protein fusions have shown that GIPs colocalize with 
γ-tubulin, GCP3, and/or GCP4 and reorganize from the nucleus to the prospindle 
and the preprophase band in late G2. After nuclear envelope breakdown, they 
localize on spindle and phragmoplast MTs and on the reforming nuclear envelope 
of daughter cells. The gip1 gip2 double mutants exhibit severe growth defects 
and sterility. At the cellular level, they are characterized by MT 
misorganization and abnormal spindle polarity, resulting in ploidy defects. 
Altogether, our data show that during mitosis GIPs play a role in γ-tubulin 
complex localization, spindle stability and chromosomal segregation.
