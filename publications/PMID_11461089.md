Tumour progression is regulated by the balance of proliferation and apoptosis in 
the tumour cell population. To date, the role of vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) in tumour growth has been attributed to the induction of 
angiogenesis. VEGF has been shown to be a survival factor for endothelial cells, 
preventing apoptosis by inducing Bcl-2 expression. In both murine (4T1) and 
human (MDA-MB-231) metastatic mammary carcinoma cell lines, we found that VEGF 
upregulated Bcl-2 expression and anti-VEGF antibodies reduced Bcl-2 expression. 
These alterations in Bcl-2 expression were reflected by the levels of tumour 
cell apoptosis. VEGF resulted in reduced tumour cell apoptosis, whereas its 
inhibition with anti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies induced apoptosis directly in 
tumour cells. Therefore, in addition to its role in angiogenesis and vessel 
permeability, VEGF acts as a survival factor for tumour cells, inducing Bcl-2 
expression and inhibiting tumour cell apoptosis.
