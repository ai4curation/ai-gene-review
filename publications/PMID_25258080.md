Animal behaviors are reinforced by subsequent rewards following within a narrow 
time window. Such reward signals are primarily coded by dopamine, which 
modulates the synaptic connections of medium spiny neurons in the striatum. The 
mechanisms of the narrow timing detection, however, remain unknown. Here, we 
optically stimulated dopaminergic and glutamatergic inputs separately and found 
that dopamine promoted spine enlargement only during a narrow time window (0.3 
to 2 seconds) after the glutamatergic inputs. The temporal contingency was 
detected by rapid regulation of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate in thin 
distal dendrites, in which protein-kinase A was activated only within the time 
window because of a high phosphodiesterase activity. Thus, we describe a 
molecular basis of reinforcement plasticity at the level of single dendritic 
spines.
