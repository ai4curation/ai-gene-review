p53 has pleiotropic functions including control of genomic plasticity and 
integrity. Here we report that p53 can bind to several transcription factor 
IIH-associated factors, including transcription-repair factors, XPD (Rad3) and 
XPB, as well as CSB involved in strand-specific DNA repair, via its C-terminal 
domain. We also found that wild-type, but not Arg273His mutant p53 inhibits XPD 
(Rad3) and XPB DNA helicase activities. Moreover, repair of UV-induced dimers is 
slower in Li-Fraumeni syndrome cells (heterozygote p53 mutant) than in normal 
human cells. Our findings indicate that p53 may play a direct role in modulating 
nucleotide excision repair pathways.
