A human protein kinase, p53-related protein kinase (PRPK), was cloned from an 
interleukin-2-activated cytotoxic T-cell subtraction library. PRPK appears to be 
a homologue of a growth-related yeast serine/threonine protein kinase, YGR262c. 
However, a complementation assay using YGR262c-disrupted yeast indicated that 
PRPK is not functionally identical to the yeast enzyme. PRPK expression was 
observed in interleukin-2-activated cytotoxic T-cells, some human epithelial 
tumor cell lines, and the testes. The intrinsic transcriptional activity of p53 
was up-regulated by a transient transfection of PRPK to COS-7 cells. PRPK was 
shown to bind to p53 and to phosphorylate p53 at Ser-15. These results indicate 
that PRPK may play an important role in the cell cycle and cell apoptosis 
through phosphorylation of p53.
