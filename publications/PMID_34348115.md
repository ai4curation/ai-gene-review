With the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease, there 
is still an unmet need to better treat hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Here, 
we identify isthmin-1 (Ism1) as an adipokine and one that has a dual role in 
increasing adipose glucose uptake while suppressing hepatic lipid synthesis. 
Ism1 ablation results in impaired glucose tolerance, reduced adipose glucose 
uptake, and reduced insulin sensitivity, demonstrating an endogenous function 
for Ism1 in glucose regulation. Mechanistically, Ism1 activates a PI3K-AKT 
signaling pathway independently of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor 
receptors. Notably, while the glucoregulatory function is shared with insulin, 
Ism1 counteracts lipid accumulation in the liver by switching hepatocytes from a 
lipogenic to a protein synthesis state. Furthermore, therapeutic dosing of 
recombinant Ism1 improves diabetes in diet-induced obese mice and ameliorates 
hepatic steatosis in a diet-induced fatty liver mouse model. These findings 
uncover an unexpected, bioactive protein hormone that might have simultaneous 
therapeutic potential for diabetes and fatty liver disease.
