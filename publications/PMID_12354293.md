The dopamine D1 receptor plays a major role in mediating behavioral responses to 
cocaine administration. The time course for the acquisition and the relative 
stability for the expression of behavioral responses suggest the involvement of 
enduring neuroadaptations in response to repeated cocaine exposure. Changes in 
gene expression through the D1 receptors may accompany and mediate the 
development of such neuroadaptations to repeated cocaine stimulation. To test 
this possibility, we systematically compared the expression of the fos and Jun 
family immediate early genes in the nucleus accumbens and caudoputamen in D1 
receptor mutant and wild-type control mice after acute and repeated cocaine 
exposure. Moreover, we compared the expression of three molecules that have been 
implicated in mediating the actions of cocaine, Galphaolf, beta-catenin and 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor, in the two groups of mice before and after 
cocaine administration. We found that there is a lack of induction of c-Fos, 
FosB, Fra-2 and JunB by acute cocaine exposure, and of DeltaFosB by repeated 
cocaine administration in both the NAc and CPu of D1 receptor mutant mice 
compared with wild-type control mice. Moreover, the D1 receptor is 
differentially required for mediating Galphaolf, beta-catenin and BDNF 
expression in the NAc and CPu upon cocaine exposure. These results suggest that 
the D1 receptor is a critical mediator for cocaine-induced expression of these 
genes.
