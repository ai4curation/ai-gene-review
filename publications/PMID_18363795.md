The characteristic shape of bacterial cells is mainly determined by the cell 
wall, the synthesis of which is orchestrated by penicillin-binding proteins 
(PBPs). Rod-shaped bacteria have two distinct modes of cell wall synthesis, 
involved in cell elongation and cell division, which are believed to employ 
different sets of PBPs. A long-held question has been how these different modes 
of growth are co-ordinated in space and time. We have now identified the cell 
division protein, EzrA, and a newly discovered protein, GpsB, as key players in 
the elongation-division cycle of Bacillus subtilis. Mutations in these genes 
have a synthetic phenotype with defects in both cell division and cell 
elongation. They also have an unusual bulging phenotype apparently due to a 
failure in properly completing cell pole maturation. We show that these 
phenotypes are tightly associated with disturbed localization of the major 
transglycosylase/transpeptidase of the cell, PBP1. EzrA and GpsB have partially 
differentiated roles in the localization cycle of PBP1, with EzrA mainly 
promoting the recruitment of PBP1 to division sites, and GpsB facilitating its 
removal from the cell pole, after the completion of pole maturation.
