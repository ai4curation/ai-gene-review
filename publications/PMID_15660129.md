Abstract

The DEAD box RNA helicase, p68, has been implicated in various cellular processes and has been shown to possess transcriptional coactivator function. Here, we show that p68 potently synergises with the p53 tumour suppressor protein to stimulate transcription from p53-dependent promoters and that endogenous p68 and p53 co-immunoprecipitate from nuclear extracts. Strikingly, RNAi suppression of p68 inhibits p53 target gene expression in response to DNA damage, as well as p53-dependent apoptosis, but does not influence p53 stabilisation or expression of non-p53-responsive genes. We also show, by chromatin immunoprecipitation, that p68 is recruited to the p21 promoter in a p53-dependent manner, consistent with a role in promoting transcriptional initiation. Interestingly, p68 knock-down does not significantly affect NF-κB activation, suggesting that the stimulation of p53 transcriptional activity is not due to a general transcription effect. This study represents the first report of the involvement of an RNA helicase in the p53 response, and highlights a novel mechanism by which p68 may act as a tumour cosuppressor in governing p53 transcriptional activity.

Introduction

The DEAD box family of RNA helicases includes a large number of conserved proteins, which are found in all organisms from bacteria to humans and have been shown to be involved in virtually all cellular processes that require manipulation of RNA structure, including transcription, pre-mRNA processing, RNA degradation, RNA export, ribosome assembly and translation. Although the characteristic biochemical properties for this family are RNA-dependent ATPase and RNA helicase activities, relatively few members appear to be true processive helicases and it is clear that many are likely to be involved in unwinding of short base-paired regions of RNA or indeed in the disruption or rearrangement of RNA–protein interactions ( Tanner and Linder, 2001 ).

p68 is a prototypic member of the DEAD box family ( Ford et al , 1988 ) and is an established ATPase and RNA helicase ( Hirling et al , 1989 ; Iggo and Lane, 1989 ). Previous reports have shown that p68 expression is growth and developmentally regulated, and that p68 is overexpressed and abnormally polyubiquitylated in colorectal tumours ( Stevenson et al , 1998 ; Causevic et al , 2001 ). Recently, p68 has been shown to be essential for pre-mRNA splicing in vitro ( Liu, 2002 ) and to play a role in the regulation of c-H- ras alternative splicing ( Guil et al , 2003 ). Dbp2p, the yeast homologue of p68 ( Iggo et al , 1991 ), was found to be important for both rRNA processing and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( Bond et al , 2001 ), while, in an earlier study, overexpressed human p68 was found to stabilise T7 mRNAs in bacteria ( Iost and Dreyfus, 1994 ). Although the roles of p68 in pre-mRNA/rRNA processing and mRNA decay/stability are consistent with its function as an RNA helicase, p68 has also been reported to act as a transcriptional coactivator for oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα), a function that appears to be independent of helicase activity ( Endoh et al , 1999 ; Watanabe et al , 2001 ). Moreover, p68 has recently been shown to be recruited to the promoter of the ERα target gene pS2 ( Metivier et al , 2003 ), consistent with it playing a role in ERα-dependent transcriptional initiation. p68 has also been reported to interact with the transcriptional coactivators CBP/p300 as well as RNA polymerase II and to stimulate transcriptional activation mediated by CBP/p300 although, in this case, p68 ATPase/RNA helicase activity appeared to be required ( Rossow and Janknecht, 2003 ). These findings therefore suggest that, in addition to its role in RNA processing, p68 may also have an important function as a transcriptional regulator.

Given the implied role of p68 in growth regulation and tumour progression ( Stevenson et al , 1998 ; Causevic et al , 2001 ), we investigated the ability of p68 to coactivate other transcription factors that are important in tumour development. One such protein is the critical tumour suppressor p53, a latent and labile transcription factor that is induced and activated in response to several stresses, including DNA damage ( Vogelstein et al , 2000 ; Balint and Vousden, 2001 ). Activated p53 induces transcription of a host of downstream target genes, which are mainly involved in growth arrest, apoptosis and DNA repair. In addition, p53 also induces expression of its negative regulatory partner Mdm2 ( Vogelstein et al , 2000 ; Balint and Vousden, 2001 ).

In this report, we show that p68 is a potent transcriptional coactivator of p53, as shown by its ability to synergise with p53 to activate transcription from p53-responsive promoters. Additionally, endogenous p53 and p68 co-immunoprecipitate from nuclear protein extracts, suggesting that these proteins interact in the cell. Furthermore, by RNAi-mediated suppression of p68 expression in cells that express wild-type (WT) p53, we show that p68 is specifically required for the induction of expression of the cellular p53 target genes p21 WAF-1 , mdm2 , Fas/APO1 and PIG3 in response to treatment with the DNA-damaging agent etoposide, while it has no effect on non-p53-responsive genes. This activity is specific to p68 since RNAi suppression of the highly related RNA helicase p72 ( Lamm et al , 1996 ) has no effect on the induction of p53 transcriptional activity by DNA damage. We also show that p68 knock-down results in a reduction in apoptosis in response to p53 induction. Finally, we show by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that p68 is recruited to the p21 promoter. These findings are therefore consistent with p68 being an important regulator of the p53 response and suggest a novel mechanism for regulating p53 transcriptional activity.

Discussion

In this report, we demonstrate a novel function for the DEAD box RNA helicase p68, namely as a potent coactivator of the tumour suppressor p53. We show that p68 synergises with p53 to stimulate transcription from p53-responsive promoters but not from promoters that lack p53-binding sites ( Figure 1 ) and that this synergism is dependent on transcriptionally active p53 ( Figure 2A ). Our studies also revealed that p68 is an important element of the p53 transcriptional response to DNA damage. This represents a novel mechanism for regulating p53 function and defines a new physiological role for p68 in a critical pathway that typically protects organisms from tumorigenesis. Notably, suppression of endogenous p68 expression has no discernible effect on the induction of endogenous p53 protein in response to DNA damage ( Figure 4A ), that is, its stabilisation, which occurs through post-translational events. Strikingly, however, the data show that induced p53 requires the presence of p68 in order to effectively stimulate expression of key downstream genes involved in growth arrest ( p21 ), apoptosis ( Fas and PIG3 ) and negative feedback ( mdm2 ). This was observed both at the protein level for p21 and Mdm2 ( Figure 4A ) and at the mRNA level by quantitative RT–PCR for p21 , mdm2 , Fas and PIG3 ( Figure 5 ), consistent with the defect being in the ability of p53 to stimulate transcription of these genes. These effects are clearly specific since a promoter lacking p53-binding elements is not affected by p68 ( Figure 1E ) and the p68 siRNA does not suppress p72 or GAPDH expression ( Figures 4A and 5E ). Furthermore, an RNAi knock-down of the highly related p72 RNA helicase had no significant effect on the ability of p53 to induce p21 or Mdm2 expression following etoposide treatment ( Figure 4B ), suggesting that the effect on p53 is specific to p68. In addition, we show that a p68 RNAi knock-down has no effect on the induction of NF-κB in response to TNFα ( Figure 9 ), indicating that p68 is not simply a general transcriptional coactivator. Importantly, we also show that RNAi depletion of p68 results in a significant reduction in the ability of cells to undergo apoptosis in response to p53 induction ( Figure 6 ), indicating that p68 is important for the biological consequences of p53 induction and highlighting a role for p68 in p53-dependent apoptosis.

Our findings also show that p68 interacts with p53 in vitro ( Figure 3A and B) and that endogenous p68 and p53 co-immunoprecipitate from nuclear extracts, indicating that the interaction is physiological ( Figure 3C–E ). Previous reports have shown that p68 can also interact with components of the transcription machinery including CBP/p300 and RNA polymerase II itself ( Endoh et al , 1999 ; Rossow and Janknecht, 2003 ). These findings would therefore be consistent with p68 stimulating p53 function by assisting its association with the transcription complex. Moreover, p68 has been shown to interact with and stimulate ERα transcriptional activity ( Endoh et al , 1999 ; Watanabe et al , 2001 ), possibly in a p53-independent manner. There are several potential mechanisms by which p68 could coactivate gene expression through single or combinational interactions with these, and perhaps other, transcription factors. Defining this mechanism precisely will be the next challenge in understanding p68 function. In this respect, it is of interest to note that other DEAD/DEAH box RNA helicases have been shown to act as transcriptional coactivators and to be associated with transcription complexes. These include RHII/Gu, which acts as a coactivator for c-Jun ( Westermarck et al , 2002 ), and RNA helicase A, which stimulates transcription mediated by the cAMP-responsive factor (CREB) by acting as a bridge between CBP and the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme ( Nakajima et al , 1997 ).

In an effort to explore potential mechanisms by which p68 could stimulate p53 transcriptional activity, we examined whether p68 is recruited to the promoter of the p53 target gene p21 . Our ChIP experiments ( Figure 7 ) show that, like p53, p68 is recruited to the p21 promoter but not to the control GAPDH promoter ( Figure 7A ), consistent with p68 coactivating p53 transcriptional activity by promoting initiation. In this respect, it is interesting to note that p68 has been shown to be recruited to the promoter of the ERα target promoter pS2 ( Metivier et al , 2003 ). Interestingly, this recruitment of p68 to the p21 promoter is significantly enhanced in response to DNA damage ( Figure 7A ) and is dependent on p53 ( Figure 7B ). As shown in Figure 4 , while etoposide treatment, as expected, causes a marked increase in the level of p53 protein, it has no effect on the levels of p68 protein. Therefore, while the increased recruitment of p53 to the p21 promoter could be explained by the increased level of p53 protein in the cell after etoposide treatment, the increase in p68 at the promoter suggests, instead, an increased level of recruitment to the p21 promoter in response to DNA damage, perhaps through interaction with p53 since the recruitment is also dependent on p53. However, we did not observe an increase in p53/p68 co-IP due to etoposide treatment, suggesting that DNA damage does not significantly enhance p53/p68 interaction per se ( Figure 8 ). Additionally, for both p53 and p68, there is a low level of protein present at the promoter prior to treatment with etoposide, suggesting the presence of low levels of these proteins in a preassembled complex at the promoter prior to DNA damage-induced p53 activation, and consistent with results from a previous study on p53 recruitment to the p21 promoter before and after DNA damage ( Espinosa et al , 2003 ). However, for both p53 and p68, there is a significant increase in recruitment after etoposide treatment ( Figure 7A ), suggesting an enhancement in the reinitiation of transcription in response to DNA damage.

While our findings indicate a significant and previously unknown function for p68, they also raise a number of questions and implications concerning p68 function. Firstly, it seems probable that p68 is a pleiotropic protein with a number of biological roles in different cellular pathways and with different biochemical activities. Our data from the p53/p68 cotransfection/luciferase assays ( Figure 2B ) and those from with respect to ERα ( Endoh et al , 1999 ) suggest that ATPase/helicase activity can be uncoupled from the role of p68 in transcriptional transactivation. However, it is also possible that recruitment of p68 to transcriptional complexes localises other functions of p68, such as its ability to unwind RNA structures, to sites of transcriptional activity. This is important since p68 has been shown to be involved in pre-mRNA splicing ( Liu, 2002 ) and mRNA stability ( Bond et al , 2001 ). Thus, p68 may play a role in coupling the processes of transcription and pre-mRNA processing and RNA helicase activity may be required for the post-transcriptional functions of p68. Such effects may not be detected in reporter gene assays, which utilise a heterologous unspliced mRNA encoding the luciferase protein.

Another prediction from our results is that, if p68 is required for p53 transactivation function, loss of p68 coactivator function may be one of the many mechanisms that could attenuate p53 action during tumorigenesis. We previously reported that p68 is overexpressed in colon carcinomas in a heavily post-translationally modified form (mainly ubiquitylated protein) ( Causevic et al , 2001 ). Interestingly, in that study, we observed a gradual disappearance of the ‘normal' p68 species during tumour progression and suggested that the loss of the normal p68, rather than the appearance of the modified forms, may be important in tumour development ( Causevic et al , 2001 ). That report did not investigate whether this might influence p68-dependent effects on transcription, but it certainly raises the possibility that alteration of p68 function in this manner could be important during cancer development. Our finding that p68 appears to be required for p53 to function as a transcriptional activator in response to DNA damage thus suggests a potential role for p68 as a tumour cosuppressor.
