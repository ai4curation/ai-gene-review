Photomorphogenesis is a critical plant developmental process that involves 
light-mediated transcriptome and histone modification changes. The transcription 
factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) acts downstream of multiple families of 
photoreceptors to promote photomorphogenesis by regulating the expression of 
light-responsive genes. However, the molecular mechanism for HY5-mediated 
transcriptional regulation remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrated that 
HY5 directly interacts with a Reduced Potassium Dependence3/Histone Deacetylase1 
(HDA1)-type histone deacetylase, HDA15, both in vitro and in vivo. Phenotypic 
analysis revealed that HDA15 is a negative regulator of hypocotyl cell 
elongation under both red and far-red light conditions in Arabidopsis 
(Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings. The enzymatic activity of HDA15 is required 
for inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. Furthermore, HDA15 and HY5 act 
interdependently in the repression of hypocotyl cell elongation in 
photomorphogenesis. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed that HDA15 and 
HY5 corepress the transcription of a subset of cell wall organization and auxin 
signaling-related genes. In addition, HDA15 is required for the function of HY5 
in the repression of genes related to hypocotyl cell elongation in Arabidopsis 
seedlings. Moreover, HY5 recruits HDA15 to the promoters of target genes and 
represses gene expression by decreasing the levels of histone H4 acetylation in 
a light-dependent manner. Our study revealed a key transcription regulatory node 
in which HY5 interacts with HDA15 involved in repressing hypocotyl cell 
elongation to promote photomorphogenesis.

Abstract

Photomorphogenesis is a critical plant developmental process that involves light-mediated transcriptome and histone modification changes. The transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) acts downstream of multiple families of photoreceptors to promote photomorphogenesis by regulating the expression of light-responsive genes. However, the molecular mechanism for HY5-mediated transcriptional regulation remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrated that HY5 directly interacts with a Reduced Potassium Dependence3/Histone Deacetylase1 (HDA1)-type histone deacetylase, HDA15, both in vitro and in vivo. Phenotypic analysis revealed that HDA15 is a negative regulator of hypocotyl cell elongation under both red and far-red light conditions in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) seedlings. The enzymatic activity of HDA15 is required for inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. Furthermore, HDA15 and HY5 act interdependently in the repression of hypocotyl cell elongation in photomorphogenesis. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed that HDA15 and HY5 corepress the transcription of a subset of cell wall organization and auxin signaling-related genes. In addition, HDA15 is required for the function of HY5 in the repression of genes related to hypocotyl cell elongation in Arabidopsis seedlings. Moreover, HY5 recruits HDA15 to the promoters of target genes and represses gene expression by decreasing the levels of histone H4 acetylation in a light-dependent manner. Our study revealed a key transcription regulatory node in which HY5 interacts with HDA15 involved in repressing hypocotyl cell elongation to promote photomorphogenesis.
