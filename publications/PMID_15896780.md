Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) interacts with and
phosphorylates various transcription factors that are critical regulators of
cell fate decisions and apoptosis during development. Here we show that lysine
25 of HIPK2 is the major sumoylation site, both in vitro and in vivo, and that
the sumoylation of this site occurs in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This
became clear with the finding that kinase-dead HIPK2 (K221R) could not be
efficiently sumoylated in vitro. The sumoylation of HIPK2 resulted in the
disruption of its interaction with a Groucho corepressor. Consequently,
sumoylation inhibited the regulatory activity of HIPK2 on the Groucho-mediated
repression of transcription, whereas not on p53-mediated transactivation. These
results suggest that phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation enables HIPK2 to
drive different target gene transcription by means of differential interactions
with its binding partners.
