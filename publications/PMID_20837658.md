Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal brain tumor characterized by intense 
apoptosis resistance and extensive necrosis. Bcl2L12 (for Bcl2-like 12) is a 
cytoplasmic and nuclear protein that is overexpressed in primary GBM and 
functions to inhibit post-mitochondrial apoptosis signaling. Here, we show that 
nuclear Bcl2L12 physically and functionally interacts with the p53 tumor 
suppressor, as evidenced by the capacity of Bcl2L12 to (1) enable bypass of 
replicative senescence without concomitant loss of p53 or p19 (Arf), (2) inhibit 
p53-dependent DNA damage-induced apoptosis, (3) impede the capacity of p53 to 
bind some of its target gene promoters, and (4) attenuate endogenous 
p53-directed transcriptomic changes following genotoxic stress. Correspondingly, 
The Cancer Genome Atlas profile and tissue protein analyses of human GBM 
specimens show significantly lower Bcl2L12 expression in the setting of genetic 
p53 pathway inactivation. Thus, Bcl2L12 is a multifunctional protein that 
contributes to intense therapeutic resistance of GBM through its ability to 
operate on two key nodes of cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling cascades.

Abstract

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal brain tumor characterized by intense apoptosis resistance and extensive necrosis. Bcl2L12 (for Bcl2-like 12) is a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein that is overexpressed in primary GBM and functions to inhibit post-mitochondrial apoptosis signaling. Here, we show that nuclear Bcl2L12 physically and functionally interacts with the p53 tumor suppressor, as evidenced by the capacity of Bcl2L12 to (1) enable bypass of replicative senescence without concomitant loss of p53 or p19 Arf , (2) inhibit p53-dependent DNA damage-induced apoptosis, (3) impede the capacity of p53 to bind some of its target gene promoters, and (4) attenuate endogenous p53-directed transcriptomic changes following genotoxic stress. Correspondingly, The Cancer Genome Atlas profile and tissue protein analyses of human GBM specimens show significantly lower Bcl2L12 expression in the setting of genetic p53 pathway inactivation. Thus, Bcl2L12 is a multifunctional protein that contributes to intense therapeutic resistance of GBM through its ability to operate on two key nodes of cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling cascades.

Discussion

Previous work has established that p53 plays pivotal roles in cell death execution following genotoxic stress (for review, see Aylon and Oren 2007 ), and, consequently, is intricately intertwined with canonical apoptosis signaling pathways, particularly those executed by Bcl-2 family proteins. Correspondingly, p53-dependent transcriptional up-regulation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Puma and Noxa is essential for DNA damage-mediated apoptosis via induction of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization ( Jeffers et al. 2003 ; Villunger et al. 2003 ; Shibue et al. 2006 ). Independently of its transactivational activity, cytoplasmic p53 can interact physically with Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-x L , and Bax to trigger cytochrome c release (for review, see Vaseva and Moll 2009 ). Notably, nuclear/transactivational and cytoplasmic activities may be linked, as p53 transcriptionally induces Puma that can bind Bcl-x L to displace p53 from a p53:Bcl-x L complex. Subsequently, released p53 directly interacts with and activates Bax to induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization ( Chipuk et al. 2005 ).
