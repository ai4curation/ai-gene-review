Cohesin associates with distinct sites on chromosomes to mediate sister 
chromatid cohesion. Single cohesin complexes are thought to bind by encircling 
both sister chromatids in a topological embrace. Transcriptionally repressed 
chromosomal domains in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae represent specialized 
sites of cohesion where cohesin binds silent chromatin in a Sir2-dependent 
fashion. In this study, we investigated the molecular basis for Sir2-mediated 
cohesion. We identified a cluster of charged surface residues of Sir2, 
collectively termed the EKDK motif, that are required for cohesin function. In 
addition, we demonstrated that Esc8, a Sir2-interacting factor, is also required 
for silent chromatin cohesion. Esc8 was previously shown to associate with Isw1, 
the enzymatic core of ISW1 chromatin remodelers, to form a variant of the ISW1a 
chromatin remodeling complex. When ESC8 was deleted or the EKDK motif was 
mutated, cohesin binding at silenced chromatin domains persisted but cohesion of 
the domains was abolished. The data are not consistent with cohesin embracing 
both sister chromatids within silent chromatin domains. Transcriptional 
silencing remains largely intact in strains lacking ESC8 or bearing EKDK 
mutations, indicating that silencing and cohesion are separable functions of 
Sir2 and silent chromatin.
