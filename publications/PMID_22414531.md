Development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) requires secretion of specific 
isoforms of the proteoglycan agrin by motor neurons. Secreted agrin is widely 
expressed in the basal lamina of various tissues, whereas a transmembrane form 
is highly expressed in the brain. Expression in the brain is greatest during the 
period of synaptogenesis, but remains high in regions of the adult brain that 
show extensive synaptic plasticity. The well-established role of agrin in NMJ 
development and its presence in the brain elicited investigations of its 
possible role in synaptogenesis in the brain. Initial studies on the embryonic 
brain and neuronal cultures of agrin-null mice did not reveal any defects in 
synaptogenesis. However, subsequent studies in culture demonstrated inhibition 
of synaptogenesis by agrin antisense oligonucleotides or agrin siRNA. More 
recently, a substantial loss of excitatory synapses was found in the brains of 
transgenic adult mice that lacked agrin expression everywhere but in motor 
neurons. The mechanisms by which agrin influences synapse formation, maintenance 
and plasticity may include enhancement of excitatory synaptic signaling, 
activation of the "muscle-specific" receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) and positive 
regulation of dendritic filopodia. In this article I will review the evidence 
that agrin regulates synapse development, plasticity and signaling in the brain 
and discuss the evidence for the proposed mechanisms.
