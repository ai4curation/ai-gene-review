Fundamental open questions in signal transduction remain concerning the sequence 
and distribution of molecular signaling events among individual cells. In this 
work, we have characterized the intercellular variability of transforming growth 
factor β-induced Smad interactions, providing essential information about TGF-β 
signaling and its dependence on the density of cell populations and the cell 
cycle phase. By employing the recently developed in situ proximity ligation 
assay, we investigated the dynamics of interactions and modifications of Smad 
proteins and their partners under native and physiological conditions. We 
analyzed the kinetics of assembly of Smad complexes and the influence of 
cellular environment and relation to mitosis. We report rapid kinetics of 
formation of Smad complexes, including native Smad2-Smad3-Smad4 trimeric 
complexes, in a manner influenced by the rate of proteasomal degradation of 
these proteins, and we found a striking cell to cell variation of signaling 
complexes. The single-cell analysis of TGF-β signaling in genetically unmodified 
cells revealed previously unknown aspects of regulation of this pathway, and it 
provided a basis for analysis of these signaling events to diagnose pathological 
perturbations in patient samples and to evaluate their susceptibility to drug 
treatment.
