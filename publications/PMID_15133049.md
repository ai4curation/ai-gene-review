A member of the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family of proteins, 
PIAS1, have been reported to serve as an E3-type SUMO ligase for tumor 
suppressor p53 and its own. It also was proposed that the N-terminal domain of 
PIAS1 interacts with DNA as well as p53. Extensive biochemical studies have been 
devoted recently to understand sumoylations and its biological implications, 
whereas the structural aspects of the PIAS family and the mechanism of its 
interactions with various factors are less well known to date. In this study, 
the three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain (residues 1-65) of SUMO 
ligase PIAS1 was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure revealed a unique 
four-helix bundle with a topology of an up-down-extended loop-down-up, a part of 
which the helix-extended loop-helix represented the SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and 
PIAS) motif. Thus, this N-terminal domain may be referred to as a four-helix SAP 
domain. The glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay demonstrated that this 
domain possesses a binding ability to tumor suppressor p53, a target protein for 
sumoylation by PIAS1, whereas gel mobility assays showed that it has a strong 
affinity toward A/T-rich DNA. An NMR analysis of the four-helix SAP domain 
complexed with the 16-bp-long DNA demonstrated that one end of the four-helix 
bundle is the binding site and may fit into the minor groove of DNA. The 
three-dimensional structure and its binding duality are discussed in conjunction 
with the biological functions of PIAS1 as a SUMO ligase.
