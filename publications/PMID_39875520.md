Ferroptosis is one of the cell death programs occurring after spinal cord injury 
(SCI) and is driven by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation. However, little 
is known about its underlying regulation mechanism. The present study 
demonstrated that lipid peroxidation was promoted in patients with SCI. Neurons 
affected by ferroptosis following SCI had a high expression of ferroptotic 
protein ACSL4. The E3 SUMOylase TRIM28 promoted neuronal ferroptosis by 
enhancing ACSL4 expression. Genetic deletion of Trim28 significantly attenuated 
neuronal ferroptosis and improved mouse hindlimb motor function following SCI. 
In contrast, mice with Trim28 overexpression demonstrated poor neurological 
function after SCI, which was attenuated by ferroptosis inhibitor 
Liproxstatin-1. Mechanistically, TRIM28 bound to ACSL4, promoted SUMO3 
modification at lysine (K) 532, and inhibited K63-linked ACSL4 ubiquitination, 
thereby suppressing OPTN-dependent autophagic degradation. Additionally, SENP3 
was identified as the deSUMOylation enzyme that can reverse this process and 
compete with TRIM28, which was transcriptionally upregulated due to excessive 
oxidative stress. These data unveiled a mechanism by which TRIM28-mediated 
SUMOylation regulated neuronal ACSL4 levels and ferroptosis, identified 
interactions and correlations involved in ACSL4 SUMOylation, ubiquitination, and 
autophagic degradation, and discovered a positive feedback loop where oxidative 
stress transcriptionally upregulated Trim28, and conversely TRIM28 promoted 
ferroptosis and oxidative stress. Notably, screening of the FDA-approved drug 
library revealed that pharmacological TRIM28/ACSL4 axis interventions with Rutin 
hydrate inhibited neuronal ferroptosis and improved hindlimb motor function in 
mice after SCI, thus providing a promising therapeutic strategy for its 
treatment.
