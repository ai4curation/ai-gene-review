Abstract

In early secretory transport, coat recruitment for the formation of coat protein I (COPI) vesicles involves binding to donor Golgi membranes of the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 and subsequent attachment of the cytoplasmic heptameric complex coatomer. Various hypotheses exist as to the precise role of and possible routes taken by COPI vesicles in the mammalian cell. Here we report the ubiquitous expression of two novel isotypes of coatomer subunits γ- and ζ-COP that are incorporated into coatomer, and show that three isotypes exist of the complex defined by the subunit combinations γ1/ζ1, γ1/ζ2, and γ2/ζ1. In a liver cytosol, these forms make up the total coatomer in a ratio of about 2:1:2, respectively. The coatomer isotypes are located differentially within the early secretory pathway, and the γ2/ζ1 isotype is preferentially incorporated into COPI vesicles. A population of COPI vesicles was characterized that almost exclusively contains γ2/ζ1 coatomer. This existence of three structurally different forms of coatomer will need to be considered in future models of COPI-mediated transport.

DISCUSSION

Coatomer is a stable protein complex composed of seven subunits, α-, β-, β′-, γ-, δ-, ɛ-, and ζ-COP. Three subcomplexes have been characterized that make up its architecture. A trimeric subcomplex of α-, β′-, and ɛ-COP, a dimeric subcomplex of β- and δ-COP, and a dimeric subcomplex of γ- and ζ-COP ( 14 , 32 , 42 ). These subcomplexes form the overall complex by additional interactions of various subunits ( 13 ). Human genomic sequences have shown the presence of an additional gene for γ-COP, and the corresponding mRNA was described ( 4 ). Likewise, a cDNA for a second ζ-COP was found (A. Whitney, personal communication, group of the late Thomas Kreis) (SwissProt accession number Q9JHH9 ). The cDNAs of both genes were cloned with an HA tag in rat hepatocytes and found to be incorporated into coatomer. Additionally, the tagged versions of γ2-COP and ζ2-COP colocalize with coatomer as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy ( 15 ). In light of the fact that γ- and ζ-COP form within coatomer a dimeric subcomplex, which is involved in membrane binding of the overall complex ( 22 , 23 , 62 ), this concurrence of γ and ζ isotypes might indicate specialized functions of the respective complexes.

The presence of isotypic COPs in conventional preparations of coatomer may have escaped our (and other investigators') notice because the γ2 isotype migrates a little faster than the family of 100-kDa subunits and cross-reacts with most of the antibodies against γ1-COP. Therefore, γ2-COP was misleadingly addressed as a degradation product of γ1-COP. ζ2-COP, making up only about 20% of total ζ-COP, was frequently seen as a contamination.

The above findings raised questions as to the relative masses of COP isotypes, about their stoichiometry within a coatomer complex, and about specific combinations of γ- and ζ-COP that would define individual complexes. Here we have shown that the endogenous isotypes of both γ- and ζ-COP are incorporated individually into coatomer, i.e., into complexes, each with seven subunits. We find a total of three combinations, γ1/ζ1-, γ1/ζ2-, and γ2/ζ1-COP that define coatomer isoforms in a liver cytosol at a ratio of about 2:1:2 (Fig. 10 ). Thus, the novel isotypic complexes make up more than one half of total coatomer, and this remarkable amount suggested to us a possibility that different functions may be attributed to the individual isoforms.

However, two hybrid studies have pointed to a functional redundancy of the isotypes because all four possible interactions of γ and ζ subunits were found ( 15 ). A structural discrimination of protein-protein interactions may, however, depend on the context of the overall structure of a complex, and thus, interactions of individual subunits do not necessarily reflect an in vivo situation. Moreover, these findings might be a consequence of incorporation of the subunits into yeast coatomer, a unique complex that has not evolved a mechanism to discriminate between individual COP isotypes.

At this point we can only speculate about a structural basis for the specific γ/ζ-COP interactions that define the three coatomer isotypes in mammals. At the level of primary structure, only two short sequences are found in γ1- and γ2-COP of marked heterogeneity (which were used to raise anti-γ2-specific antibodies) (cf. supplemental material [ http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/archiv/4012 ]). The ζ isotypes differ more markedly, with an N-terminal extension of about 30 aa in ζ2-COP. This additional sequence might be involved either in the specificity of ζ2-COP for γ1-COP and/or in differential functions that the γ1/ζ2 subcomplex might confer to its coatomer isotype.

Interestingly, our gene bank data mining has revealed a coexistence of γ and ζ isotypes, i.e., the existence of a second γ-COP in an organism is linked to the presence of a second ζ-COP, as evidenced in all vertebrates investigated as well as in plants and some insects. Altogether, this points to a specialized function of γ/ζ-COP dimeric subcomplexes within coatomer isotypes.

This view is strengthened by our finding of differential locations of the subunits in membranes of the early secretory pathway and, finally, in isolating a population of COPI vesicles quite homogeneously coated with a single isotype of coatomer, defined by γ2/ζ1-COP.

A variety of functions have been proposed for coatomer. The complex was localized to endosomal membranes, and a role has been discussed in retrieving proteins from endosomes back to the Golgi and the ER ( 10 , 18 , 61 ). Peroxisomes were described to bind coatomer in an ADP-ribosylation factor- and GTP-dependent manner, and consequently the COPI coat was suggested to be involved in a transport pathway between these organelles and the ER. This pathway might serve peroxisome biogenesis by mediating exchange of ER-derived proteins and lipids ( 41 , 58 ). As opposed to a role in biosynthetic anterograde protein transport ( 35 , 37 , 39 ), COPI vesicles are held to mediate retrograde transport, between the Golgi and the ER ( 9 , 30 , 56 ) or retrograde transport within the Golgi apparatus to maintain the identity of Golgi cisternae during maturation of this organelle system ( 7 , 17 , 33 ). Furthermore, a structural role was attributed to coatomer in the maintenance of the Golgi apparatus ( 19 ) and as a device to protect the Golgi membrane from uncontrolled fusion ( 12 , 31 , 50 ).

With the characterization of three isotypes of coatomer, the stage is now set for experiments with a focus on individual functions that individual isoforms of the complex may serve.
