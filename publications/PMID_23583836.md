Abstract

The mature aortic valve is composed of a structured trilaminar extracellular matrix that is interspersed with aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) and covered by endothelium. Dysfunction of the valvular endothelium initiates calcification of neighboring AVICs leading to calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). The molecular mechanism by which endothelial cells communicate with AVICs and cause disease is not well understood. Using a co-culture assay, we show that endothelial cells secrete a signal to inhibit calcification of AVICs. Gain or loss of nitric oxide (NO) prevents or accelerates calcification of AVICs, respectively, suggesting that the endothelial cell-derived signal is NO. Overexpression of Notch1, which is genetically linked to human CAVD, retards the calcification of AVICs that occurs with NO inhibition. In AVICs, NO regulates the expression of Hey1, a downstream target of Notch1, and alters nuclear localization of Notch1 intracellular domain. Finally, Notch1 and NOS3 (endothelial NO synthase) display an in vivo genetic interaction critical for proper valve morphogenesis and the development of aortic valve disease. Our data suggests that endothelial cell-derived NO is a regulator of Notch1 signaling in AVICs in the development of the aortic valve and adult aortic valve disease.

1. Introduction

Valvular heart disease is responsible for over 20,000 deaths each year in the United States alone and the aortic valve is commonly affected [ 1 ]. Calcific aortic stenosis affects an estimated 2–3% of the population over 75 years of age and results in progressive aortic valve stenosis, which will ultimately require valve replacement [ 2 , 3 ]. Along with clinical risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholestoleremia, and diabetes, the presence of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), a congenital malformation, increases the risk of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) [ 4 ]. BAV has a prevalence of 1–2% in the population and is the second most common cause of aortic stenosis [ 5 ]. The molecular mechanisms that underlie CAVD are not well understood.

Calcific aortic valve disease is manifested by the identification of calcific nodules on the arterial aspect of the aortic valve, which do not allow the valve to function properly. In addition to calcification, diseased valves display a loss of organization of the normal trilaminar valve structure [ 6 ]. The normal valve ECM is composed of collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans and is interspersed with valvular interstitial cells (VICs), which are proposed to mediate the process of calcification [ 7 ]. The valve ECM and VICs are surrounded by an overlying cell layer of valve endothelium. Injury, by abnormal hemodynamics or systemic disease states, to valve endothelial cells has been postulated to be the initiating factor for the development of CAVD [ 8 , 9 ].

Several studies in multiple species have demonstrated a role for endothelial nitric oxide (NO) in CAVD but the mechanism by which it affects underlying VICs is unknown [ 10 – 12 ]. NO is generated by three synthases, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS/NOS3), inducible NOS (iNOS/NOS2) and neuronal NOS (nNOS/NOS1). Targeted deletion of NOS3 in mice has not been reported to result in CAVD, but interestingly is associated with BAV. The molecular mechanisms underlying this link are not known [ 13 ].

The Notch signaling pathway has been linked to aortic valve disease in humans [ 14 ]. The Notch family contains four transmembrane receptors, Notch 1–4, and functions in a broad spectrum of cell fate decisions, developmental processes and vascular disease states [ 15 – 17 ]. Activation of Notch receptors by the Jagged and Delta-like ligands results in a series of proteolytic cleavages that generate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional co-activator and initiates the expression of target genes, including the HEY (Hes-related with YPRW motif) family of transcriptional repressors [ 15 ]. Using a traditional genetic linkage approach, heterozygous loss of function mutations in NOTCH1 were found to be associated with autosomal-dominant BAV and CAVD [ 14 ]. In addition, Notch1 haploinsufficient mice have been shown to develop aortic valve calcification [ 18 , 19 ]. Using an established aortic valve interstitial cell (AVIC) culture system that spontaneously calcifies in vitro , it has been shown that inhibition of Notch signaling in AVICs accelerates the calcification process, potentially by regulating Bmp2 signaling and Sox9 [ 18 – 20 ]. However, the mechanisms by which Notch1 signaling is regulated in the process of CAVD has not been investigated.

Here, we show that a secreted signal from endothelial cells inhibits calcification of porcine AVICs using co-culture and transwell assays. We further demonstrate that nitric oxide (NO), which is secreted by endothelial cells, prevents calcification of AVICs similar to the presence of endothelial cells, while the absence of NO increases calcification. To demonstrate that endothelial cell-derived NO is signaling to Notch1 in AVICs, we show that overexpression of a constitutively active Notch1 in AVICs prevents calcification that occurs with NO inhibition and that endothelial-derived NO signaling increases the expression of a Notch signaling target gene in AVICs. We identify a novel molecular mechanism by which endothelial cell-derived NO is communicating to neighboring cells by altering the nuclear localization of NICD in AVICs. Lastly, we show that the NO and Notch1 signaling pathways genetically interact in vivo as NOS3;Notch1 compound mutant mice display a highly penetrant model of aortic valve disease, characterized by abnormal gene expression and valve dysfunction. These data demonstrate that NO signaling in valve endothelial cells affects Notch1 signaling pathways in AVICs and may be critical in the pathogenesis of adult aortic valve disease.

4. DISCUSSION

Endothelial cell injury has been proposed to be the initiating factor for CAVD, and in this study we have defined a molecular pathway linking endothelial cells to molecular changes in AVICs that lead to the development of calcification and aortic valve malformations. We show that endothelial cell secreted NO affects the calcification process using a well-established porcine AVIC culture system. Our data uncover a novel mechanism by which NO modulates Notch1 signaling in neighboring AVICs by altering the nuclear localization of NICD. In addition, we describe a previously unrecognized in vivo genetic interaction between NOS3 and Notch1 , demonstrating compound mutant mice ( NOS3 −/− ;Notch1 +/− ) develop aortic valve disease. The findings demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism for aortic valve disease that links the endothelium to the underlying interstitial cells.

CAVD has similar risk factors to coronary atherosclerosis and many of these are associated with endothelial cell dysfunction [ 31 ]. Consistent with this, evidence of oxidative stress as measured by superoxide was demonstrated in a hypercholestolemic mouse model of CAVD [ 32 ]. To our knowledge, this study provides the first molecular evidence linking endothelial cell dysfunction and its resultant abnormal signaling to alter gene expression in underlying AVICs. We demonstrate that NO is a molecular signal that mediates this crosstalk between the endothelium and interstitial layers of the aortic valve. Other signaling pathways also implicated in valve calcification include Wnt/Lrp5 and Bmp2 however further investigation is required to determine if endothelial NO intersects with these other molecular pathways in AVICs [ 33 – 35 ].

In the course of this work, we have uncovered a novel mechanism by which NO signaling modulates gene expression in neighboring cells. We found that endothelial cell-produced NO signaling effects the expression of Hey1, a downstream mediator of Notch1 signaling. We show that this effect is associated with altered nuclear localization of NICD. A similar finding has been reported with inducible NO in cholangiocytes, where expression of inducible NOS induces nuclear translocation of NICD suggesting that this maybe a more general mechanism by which NO regulates gene expression [ 29 ]. It is known that NO regulates downstream signaling pathways by two potential mechanisms, either by the canonical pathway involving cGMP/PKG or by S-nitrosylation. A recent publication demonstrates that NO regulates the nuclear localization of the transcription factor Nrf2 by S-nitrosylation of Keap1, which normally functions to sequester Nrf2 in the cytoplasm [ 36 ]. Additional research is required to determine if NO utilizes a similar strategy to modify NICD localization in the aortic valve. Interestingly, the interaction between these two signaling pathways maybe more complex as Notch has been shown to directly regulate the expression of soluble guanyl cyclases, which act as NO receptors, suggesting both pathways may have the ability to regulate each other [ 37 ]. Our observations are similar to the report of NOS3 functioning as a genetic modifier of Tbx5 in atrial septal formation [ 38 ]. Furthermore, while our data connect NO to Notch signaling, it does not preclude the possibility of alternative Notch1 activation or attenuation in parallel to our system.

The first evidence linking NOTCH1 mutations to aortic valve disease was described in families with autosomal dominant form of BAV and CAVD [ 14 ]. Interestingly, a BAV was not found in all family members with CAVD as some family members had CAVD in the setting of a three leaflet aortic valve. This initial observation suggested that Notch1 may function in both adult aortic valve disease and morphogenesis [ 39 ]. While multiple studies have provided evidence for a role of Notch1 signaling in adult aortic valve disease, here we have demonstrated a molecular link to NOS3 in the overlying endothelium. This observation is also supported by the finding that patients having a BAV display decreased levels of NOS3 in the aortic endothelium [ 40 ]. Furthermore, our data suggest that alteration of Notch signaling in the AVICs, not the endothelial cells, leads to calcification. Additional investigation is required to determine if the Notch signaling pathway is perturbed in other models of aortic valve disease.
