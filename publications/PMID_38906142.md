The Integrator complex attenuates gene expression via the premature termination 
of RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) at promoter-proximal pausing sites. It is required 
for stimulus response, cell differentiation, and neurodevelopment, but how 
gene-specific and adaptive regulation by Integrator is achieved remains unclear. 
Here, we identify two sites on human Integrator subunits 13/14 that serve as 
binding hubs for sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) and other 
transcription effector complexes. When Integrator is attached to paused RNAP2, 
these hubs are positioned upstream of the transcription bubble, consistent with 
simultaneous TF-promoter tethering. The TFs co-localize with Integrator 
genome-wide, increase Integrator abundance on target genes, and co-regulate 
responsive transcriptional programs. For instance, sensory cilia formation 
induced by glucose starvation depends on Integrator-TF contacts. Our data 
suggest TF-mediated promoter recruitment of Integrator as a widespread mechanism 
for targeted transcription regulation.
