Lysyl oxidases are major actors of microenvironment and extracellular matrix 
(ECM) remodeling. These cross-linking enzymes are thus involved in many aspects 
of physiopathology, including tumor progression, fibrosis and cardiovascular 
diseases. We have already shown that Lysyl Oxidase-Like 2 (LOXL2) regulates 
collagen IV deposition by endothelial cells and angiogenesis. We here provide 
evidence that LOXL2 also affects deposition of other ECM components, including 
fibronectin, thus altering structural and mechanical properties of the matrix 
generated by endothelial cells. LOXL2 interacts intracellularly and directly 
with collagen IV and fibronectin before incorporation into ECM fibrillar 
structures upon exocytosis, as demonstrated by TIRF time-lapse microscopy. 
Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance experiments using recombinant scavenger 
receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains truncated for the catalytic domain 
demonstrated their direct binding to collagen IV. We thus used directed 
mutagenesis to investigate the role of LOXL2 catalytic domain. Neither enzyme 
activity nor catalytic domain were necessary for collagen IV deposition and 
angiogenesis, whereas the SRCR domains were effective for these processes. 
Finally, surface coating with recombinant SRCR domains restored deposition of 
collagen IV by LOXL2-depleted cells. We thus propose that LOXL2 SRCR domains 
orchestrate scaffolding of the vascular basement membrane and angiogenesis 
through interactions with collagen IV and fibronectin, independently of the 
enzymatic cross-linking activity.
