The transition to flowering is a tightly controlled developmental decision in 
plants. In Arabidopsis, LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1) are key regulators of 
this transition and expression of these genes in primordia produced by the 
inflorescence meristem confers floral fate. Here, we examine the role of 
architectural regulators BLADE-ON-PETIOLE1 (BOP1) and BOP2 in promotion of 
floral meristem identity. Loss-of-function bop1 bop2 mutants show subtle defects 
in inflorescence and floral architecture but in combination with lfy or ap1, 
synergistic defects in floral meristem fate and determinacy are revealed. The 
most dramatic changes occur in bop1 bop2 ap1-1 triple mutants where flowers are 
converted into highly branched inflorescence-like shoots. Our data show that 
BOP1/2 function distinctly from LFY to upregulate AP1 in floral primordia and 
that all three activities converge to down-regulate flowering-time regulators 
including AGAMOUS-LIKE24 in stage 2 floral meristems. Subsequently, BOP1/2 
promote A-class floral-organ patterning in parallel with LFY and AP1. Genetic 
and biochemical evidence support the model that BOP1/2 are recruited to the 
promoter of AP1 through direct interactions with TGA bZIP transcription factors, 
including PERIANTHIA. These data reveal an important supporting role for BOP1/2 
in remodeling shoot architecture during the floral transition.
