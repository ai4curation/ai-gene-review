We have previously reported on a unique patient in whom homozygosity for a 
mutation at IRF8 (IRF8(K108E)) causes a severe immunodeficiency. Laboratory 
evaluation revealed a highly unusual myeloid compartment, remarkable for the 
complete absence of CD141 and CD161 monocytes, absence of CD11c1 conventional 
dendritic cells (DCs) and CD11c1/CD1231 plasmacytoid DCs, and striking 
granulocytic hyperplasia. The patient initially presented with severe 
disseminated mycobacterial and mucocutaneous fungal infections and was 
ultimately cured by cord blood transplant. Sequencing RNA from the IRF8(K108E) 
patient's primary blood cells prior to transplant shows not only depletion of 
IRF8-bound and IRF8-regulated transcriptional targets, in keeping with the 
distorted composition of the myeloid compartment, but also a paucity of 
transcripts associated with activated CD41 and CD81 T lymphocytes. This suggests 
that T cells reared in the absence of a functional antigen-presenting 
compartment in IRF8(K108E) are anergic. Biochemical characterization of the 
IRF8(K108E) mutant in vitro shows that loss of the positively charged side chain 
at K108 causes loss of nuclear localization and loss of transcriptional 
activity, which is concomitant with decreased protein stability, increased 
ubiquitination, increased small ubiquitin-like modification, and enhanced 
proteasomal degradation. These findings provide functional insight into the 
molecular basis of immunodeficiency associated with loss of IRF8.
