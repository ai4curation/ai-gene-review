We have isolated two novel human cDNAs, gps1-1 and gps2, that suppress lethal 
G-protein subunit-activating mutations in the pheromone response pathway of the 
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Suppression of other pathway-activating events 
was examined. In wild-type cells, expression of either gps1-1 or gps2 led to 
enhanced recovery from cell cycle arrest induced by pheromone. Sequence analysis 
indicated that gps1-1 contains only the carboxy-terminal half of the gps1 coding 
sequence. The predicted gene product of gps1 has striking similarity to the 
protein encoded by the Arabidopsis FUS6 (COP11) gene, a negative regulator of 
light-mediated signal transduction that is known to be essential for normal 
development. A chimeric construct containing gps1 and FUS6 sequences also 
suppressed the yeast pheromone pathway, indicating functional conservation 
between these human and plant genes. In addition, when overexpressed in 
mammalian cells, gps1 or gps2 potently suppressed a RAS- and mitogen-activated 
protein kinase-mediated signal and interfered with JNK activity, suggesting that 
signal repression is part of their normal function. For gps1, these results are 
consistent with the proposed function of FUS6 (COP11) as a signal transduction 
repressor in plants.
