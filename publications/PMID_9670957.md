The chemokines are a growing family of low m.w., 70- to 80-residue 
proinflammatory cytokines that operate by interacting with G protein-coupled 
receptors. Chemokines are involved in cell migration and in the activation of 
specific leukocyte subsets. Using the Mono Mac 1 monocytic cell line, we show 
that monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) triggers activation of the Janus 
kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 pathway and CCR2 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Both 
Ca2+ mobilization and cell migration are blocked in Mono Mac 1 cells by 
tyrphostin B42, a specific JAK2 kinase inhibitor. Within seconds of MCP-1 
activation, JAK2 phosphorylates CCR2 at the Tyr139 position and promotes 
JAK2/STAT3 complex association to the receptor. This MCP-1-initiated 
phosphorylation and association to JAK2 is also observed in CCR2B-transfected 
HEK293 cells. In contrast, when a CCR2B Tyr139Phe mutant is expressed in HEK293 
cells, it is not phosphorylated in tyrosine and triggers neither JAK2/STAT3 
activation nor Ca2+ mobilization in response to MCP-1. These results implicate 
the tyrosine kinase pathway in early chemokine signaling, suggesting a key role 
for this kinase in later events.
