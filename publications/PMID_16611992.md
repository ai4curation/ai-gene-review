Stimulation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) can initiate several 
cellular responses, including apoptosis, which relies on caspases, necrotic cell 
death, which depends on receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1), and 
NF-kappaB activation, which induces survival and inflammatory responses. The 
TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD) protein has been suggested to be a crucial 
signal adaptor that mediates all intracellular responses from TNFR1. However, 
cells with a genetic deficiency of TRADD are unavailable, precluding analysis 
with mature immune cell types. We circumvented this problem by silencing TRADD 
expression with small interfering RNA. We found that TRADD is required for TNFR1 
to induce NF-kappaB activation and caspase-8-dependent apoptosis but is 
dispensable for TNFR1-initiated, RIP1-dependent necrosis. Our data also show 
that TRADD and RIP1 compete for recruitment to the TNFR1 signaling complex and 
the distinct programs of cell death. Thus, TNFR1-initiated intracellular signals 
diverge at a very proximal level by the independent association of two death 
domain-containing proteins, RIP1 and TRADD. These single transducers determine 
cell fate by triggering NF-kappaB activation, apoptosis, and nonapoptotic death 
signals through separate and competing signaling pathways.
