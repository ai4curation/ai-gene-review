Abstract

The mechanisms regulating the size of the cerebral cortex are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, C3G (Grf2, Rapgef1), controls the size of the cerebral precursor population. Mice lacking C3G show overproliferation of the cortical neuroepithelium. C3G-deficient neuroepithelial cells accumulate nuclear β-catenin and fail to exit the cell cycle in vivo . C3G mutant neural precursor cells fail to activate Rap1, exhibit activation of Akt/PKB, inhibition of the β-catenin-degrading enzyme, Gsk3β and accumulation of cytosolic and nuclear β-catenin when exposed to growth factors, in vitro . Our results show that the size of the cortical neural precursor population is controlled by C3G-mediated inhibition of the Ras signalling pathway.

Introduction

Intellectual capacity is tightly correlated with cerebral cortex size relative to body size, both during human evolution and among mammalian species. The increase in cerebral cortex size in higher mammals is predominantly an increase in surface area with relatively little increase in cortical thickness ( Rakic, 1995 ). It has been proposed that an increase in the neural precursor population before and during the first half of neurogenesis during prenatal development underlies the increase in cortical size ( Caviness et al , 1995 ; Rakic, 1995 ).

Understanding the genetic regulation of the size of the cerebral neural precursor population in vivo is in its infancy. Clearly molecular pathways must exist, which allow differential growth of specific brain areas by regulating the neural precursor population. Among molecules shown to regulate the size of the cerebral neural precursor population in vivo are fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and β-catenin. FGF2 has been shown to be essential for normal cerebral cortex expansion during development ( Raballo et al , 2000 ). Overexpression of degradation-resistant β-catenin leads to an immense expansion of the neuroepithelium ( Chenn and Walsh, 2002 ). However, how these molecules may relate to each other while regulating the neural precursor population is not known.

Growth factor signalling via the Ras pathway regulates many biological processes, including cell division, migration, differentiation and survival. Ras proteins are small GTPases that are activated by guanine exchange before stimulating downstream targets, including the mitogen-activated kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathways ( Mitin et al , 2005 ). Key regulatory elements of Ras signal transduction are guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( Mitin et al , 2005 ). C3G (Grf2, Rapgef1) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras family members ( Tanaka et al , 1994 ). C3G is activated in response to extracellular signals, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), nerve growth factor (NGF) ( York et al , 1998 ; Kao et al , 2001 ) and integrin binding ( Arai et al , 1999 ; Uemura and Griffin, 1999 ). C3G stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange predominantly on Rap1 ( Ohba et al , 2001 ). Rap1 activation can reinforce or oppose the downstream consequences of Ras activation (reviewed in Stork, 2003 ). For example, Rap1 activation can lead to the sustained activation of Erk in differentiating pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) ( York et al , 1998 ; Kao et al , 2001 ) or inhibition of Erk in proliferating fibroblasts ( Schmitt and Stork, 2002 ). Very little is known about the circumstances under which C3G/Rap1 act as agonists or antagonists of Ras.

In vivo C3G is essential for embryonic development to proceed normally. C3G null embryos die around day 5.0 of gestation ( Ohba et al , 2001 ) precluding the study of the function of C3G in nervous system development, where C3G is expressed at higher levels than elsewhere in the embryo. However, we previously generated a C3G hypomorphic allele, C3G gt , which produces less than 5% normal protein allowing survival of the C3G gt/gt mutant embryos up to embryonic day 14 (E14.5) ( Voss et al , 2003 ). C3G gt/gt mutant embryos die due to a blood vessel maturation defect ( Voss et al , 2003 ). Interestingly, C3G gt/gt mutant embryos display defects in the developing nervous system before the onset of blood vessel maturation. Lack of C3G causes abnormalities in the proliferating neural precursor population and in differentiating neurons. The role of C3G in neural precursors is the subject of this study.

We show here that C3G deficiency leads to an increase in nuclear β-catenin and causes a prominent increase of neural precursor proliferation in the cerebral cortex. Our findings suggest that C3G signalling is required to activate Rap1 in response to extracellular stimuli, restrict Akt/PKB activation, alleviate Gsk3β inhibition, limit cytosolic and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, and to restrict the size of the cerebral cortex precursor population. We provide a functional link between one novel player, C3G, two downstream effectors, Akt/PKB and Gsk3β, and two known regulators, FGF2 and β-catenin, of the size of the cerebral cortex.
