Alkaline sphingomyelinase (alk-SMase) hydrolyzes dietary sphingomyelin and 
generates sphingolipid messengers in the gut. In the present study, we purified 
the enzyme, identified a part of the amino acid sequence, and found a cDNA in 
the GenBank coding for the protein. The cDNA contains 1841 bp, and the open 
reading frame encodes 458 amino acids. Transient expression of the cDNA linked 
to a Myc tag in COS-7 cells increased alk-SMase activity in the cell extract by 
689-fold and in the medium by 27-fold. High activity was also identified in the 
anti-Myc immunoprecipitated proteins and the proteins cross-reacted with 
anti-human alk-SMase. Northern blotting of human intestinal tissues found high 
levels of alk-SMase mRNA in the intestine and liver. The amino acid sequence 
shared no similarity with acid and neutral SMases but was related to the 
ecto-nucleotide phosphodiesterase (NPP) family with 30-36% identity to human 
NPPs. Alk-SMase has a predicted signal peptide domain at the N terminus and a 
signal anchor domain at the C terminus. The ion-binding sites and the catalytic 
residue of NPPs were conserved, but the substrate specificity domain was 
modified. Alk-SMase had no detectable nucleotidase activity, but its activity 
against sphingomyelin could be inhibited by orthovanadate, imidazole, and ATP. 
In contrast to NPPs, alk-SMase activity was not stimulated by divalent metal 
ions but inhibited by Zn2+. Differing from NPP2, the alk-SMase cleaved 
phosphocholine but not choline from lysophosphatidylcholine. Phylogenetic tree 
indicated that the enzyme is a new branch derived from the NPP family. Two cDNA 
sequences of mouse and rat that shared 83% identity to human alk-SMase were 
identified in the GenBank. In conclusion, we identified the amino acid and cDNA 
sequences of human intestinal alk-SMase, and found that it is a novel 
ecto-enzyme related to the NPP family with specific features essential for its 
SMase activity.
