Hsc70 is a multifunctional protein that is capable of shuttling between the 
nucleus and the cytoplasm. In this study we investigated the signal-mediated 
nuclear import step, using Xenopus oocytes as a model system. Purified rat 
hsc70, and hybrid proteins, which contained either the full-length or the 
mutated forms of rat hsc70 fused with the maltose binding protein, were labeled 
with 125I and used as transport substrates. In competition experiments, it was 
found that the nuclear import of neither purified hsc70 nor the full-length 
fusion protein was inhibited by an excess of SV40 large T or nucleoplasmin 
nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that were conjugated with BSA. Since hsc70 
contains only a single basic domain (246KRKHKKDISENKRAVRR262), which has the 
characteristics of an NLS, we examined its role in nuclear import. It was 
determined, by conjugating this sequence with BSA, that it is capable of 
promoting nuclear import and, therefore, acts as a prototypical basic NLS. 
However, inactivation of this signal by deleting the first six amino acids 
(246KRKHKK251) had no effect on hsc70 import. Overall, the present results 
indicate that hsc70 utilizes a novel import signal and enters the nucleus by a 
different mechanism than that employed by simple and bipartite NLSs. The novel 
signal has not been identified, but we have obtained evidence that it is located 
in the amino terminus of hsc70.
