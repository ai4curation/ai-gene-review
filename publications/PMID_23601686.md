MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the function of several immune cells, but their role 
in promoting CD8(+) T cell immunity remains unknown. Here we report that 
miRNA-155 is required for CD8(+) T cell responses to both virus and cancer. In 
the absence of miRNA-155, accumulation of effector CD8(+) T cells was severely 
reduced during acute and chronic viral infections and control of virus 
replication was impaired. Similarly, Mir155(-/-) CD8(+) T cells were ineffective 
at controlling tumor growth, whereas miRNA-155 overexpression enhanced the 
antitumor response. miRNA-155 deficiency resulted in accumulation of suppressor 
of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) causing defective cytokine signaling through 
STAT5. Consistently, enforced expression of SOCS-1 in CD8(+) T cells phenocopied 
the miRNA-155 deficiency, whereas SOCS-1 silencing augmented tumor destruction. 
These findings identify miRNA-155 and its target SOCS-1 as key regulators of 
effector CD8(+) T cells that can be modulated to potentiate immunotherapies for 
infectious diseases and cancer.

INTRODUCTION

CD8 + T cells are essential effectors in immune responses to intracellular pathogens and cancer ( Zhang and Bevan, 2011 ). Upon stimulation, antigen-specific CD8 + T cells massively expand and differentiate into inflammatory cytokine producing, cytolytic T cells able to eliminate virally infected or transformed cells. As the antigen is cleared, the majority of specific CD8 + effector T cells die ( Marrack and Kappler, 2004 ), whereas only a small number of memory cells survives. The CD8 + T cell response is influenced by a series of costimulatory (and inhibitory) ligands and by multiple soluble mediators such as IL-2 ( Boyman and Sprent, 2012 ). The latter is essential for sustaining an efficient effector response, whereas other cytokines such as IL-7 and IL-15 play crucial roles for the survival of naïve or memory T cells ( Cui and Kaech, 2010 ). Several studies have identified key molecular factors involved in the differentiation from naïve to effector CD8 + T cells, but the contribution of microRNAs (miRs) has just begun to be investigated ( Almanza et al., 2010 ).

miRs are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that impart post-transcriptional gene regulation ( Bartel, 2004 ) through several mechanisms including translational repression and mRNA degradation ( Djuranovic et al., 2011 ). They are important in many physiological processes, in carcinogenesis ( Calin and Croce, 2006 ) and in the immune system ( Xiao and Rajewsky, 2009 ). Early studies in mice deficient for Dicer, an RNAse III enzyme important for mature miR production, revealed that miRs are involved in CD4 + T cell differentiation and strongly influence CD8 + T cell responses ( Muljo et al., 2005 ; Zhang and Bevan, 2010 ). Specific miRs were shown to regulate both lymphocyte development and function. For instance, miR-181a influences thymocyte selection by modulating the expression of molecules involved in TCR signaling ( Li et al., 2007 ). Moreover, the miR-17~92 cluster regulates B cell development ( Ventura et al., 2008 ), autoimmunity and Th1cell differentiation ( Jiang et al., 2011 ; Xiao et al., 2008 ).

miR-155 is upregulated upon lymphocyte activation ( Haasch et al., 2002 ) to control cell proliferation and differentiation ( O’Connell et al., 2008 ; Turner and Vigorito, 2008 ). For instance, miR-155 regulates B cell proliferation, malignancy and antibody production, at least in part through inhibition of activation-induced cytidine deaminase and PU.1 expression ( Rodriguez et al., 2007 ; Thai et al., 2007 ; Vigorito et al., 2007 ). In CD4 + T cells, miR-155 has been shown to suppress differentiation of naïve cells into Th2 by downregulation of c-Maf, to promote Th17 cell mediated inflammation ( Kurowska-Stolarska et al., 2011 ; O’Connell et al., 2010 ) and to inhibit IFN-γR expression ( Banerjee et al., 2010 ; Martinez-Nunez et al., 2011 ). In addition to direct modulation of cytokine receptor expression, miR-155 shapes cytokine signaling in several cell subsets via downregulation of SMAD2 ( Louafi et al., 2010 ) and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS-1) ( Lu et al., 2009 ; O’Connell et al., 2010 ; Wang et al., 2010 ). Despite the evidence for an important role of miR-155 in a wide spectrum of immune compartments, it is not known if this miRNA, which is highly expressed in antigen-experienced CD8 + T cells ( Salaun et al., 2011 ), influences CD8 + T cells in vivo . In the present study, we have investigated the role of miR-155 during CD8 + T cell responses to viral infection, vaccination and cancer.

DISCUSSION

We have shown that miR-155 expression is essential for optimal CD8 + T cell responses towards virus infection, vaccination and cancer. Interestingly, the phenotype of Mir155 -/- CD8 + T cells was similar to Dicer deficient CD8 + T cells ( Zhang and Bevan, 2010 ), suggesting that miR-155 is an important, likely non-redundant miRNA for CD8 + effector T cells. Recently, we and others found differential miR-155 expression associated with discrete differentiation stages in CD8 + T cells ( Almanza et al., 2010 ; Salaun et al., 2011 ; Wu et al., 2007 ). Here, we showed that miR-155 is highly upregulated in effector CD8 + T cells responding to viral infection but at intermediate concentration in memory cells. This dynamic modulation of miR-155 raises the question of the nature of the regulating factors that are involved. miR-155 is induced by NF-kappaB dependent factors ( Kluiver et al., 2007 ) and AP-1 downstream of B and T cell receptors ( Haasch et al., 2002 ; Yin et al., 2008 ). Interestingly, we observed that miR-155 expression was proportional to the strength of TCR signaling, suggesting that miR-155 provides competitive fitness to the most avid antigen-specific CD8 + T cells.

Whereas others reported a disadvantage of Mir155 -/- naive CD8 + T cells in bone-marrow chimeras ( Lu et al., 2009 ), we found that expansion and long term survival of naïve Mir155 -/- CD8 + T cells transferred into lymphopenic hosts were not different from wild type cells. miR-155 was crucial for effector CD8 + T cell proliferation and survival during the peak of LCMV infection, but it did not influence cell survival upon antigen clearance. In contrast to the reported role of miR-155 in other immune cells, CD8 + T cells were not affected in effector functions such as killing or cytokine production and miR-155 deleted mice readily cleared low doses of LCMV. Interestingly, we detected an impaired generation of virus-specific central memory CD8 + T cells as most Mir155 -/- cells displayed a terminally differentiated phenotype. Whether this was due to a lack of CD4 + T cell help ( Janssen et al., 2003 ; Shedlock and Shen, 2003 ), lower cytokine signaling due to higher SOCS-1 expression and/or additional miR-155 targets will be subject of further investigation. In contrast to low-dose LCMV infection, we found that virus-specific Mir155 -/- effector cells disappeared during chronic LCMV infection using high doses of clone 13. Under these conditions, wild type CD8 + T cells undergo progressive attrition and display an ‘exhausted’ phenotype with impaired effector functions and high PD-1 expression ( Jin et al., 2010 ; Mueller and Ahmed, 2009 ; Wherry et al., 2003 ). We hypothesize that miR-155 is key for the survival of effector CD8 + T cells in conditions of long-term exposure to antigen and inflammation as found in chronic viral infections or cancer. Consistent with the impaired virus control, lack of miR-155 protected from LCMV-induced severe immunopathology, which is in line with reports demonstrating a pivotal role of miR-155 in autoimmune inflammation ( Murugaiyan et al., 2011 ; O’Connell et al., 2010 ). With regard to T cell survival, miR-155 was shown to inhibit caspase 3 activity in Jurkat T cells ( Ovcharenko et al., 2007 ), and FADD expression in macrophages ( Tili et al., 2007 ). Whether the increased apoptosis of Mir155 -/- CD8 + T cells was due to such mechanisms remains to be determined.

In line with our results in virus infection, we demonstrate a central role for miR-155 in tumor specific CD8 + T cells. First, the efficient accumulation of CD8 + T cells by vaccination with adjuvanted peptide required intrinsic miR-155 function, recapitulating our observations in LCMV infection. More importantly, Mir155 -/- effector cells were severely impaired in their ability to curb tumor growth. Since these cells acquired full effector functions independently of miR-155, the different tumor control was likely due to defect in the magnitude of tumor-specific T cells, or to higher susceptibility to the suppressive tumor-microenvironment ( Klebanoff et al., 2011 ). Conversely, overexpression of miR-155 greatly increased tumor killing by wild type CD8 + T cells. This indicates that tumor specific CD8 + T cell activity is directly dependent on miR-155 expression.

The accumulation of effector CD8 + T cells is influenced by the cytokine milieu, e.g. their initial expansion is promoted by γc cytokines, which signaling is regulated by SOCS-1 ( Cornish et al., 2003 ). More specifically, CD8 + effector cell accumulation in the LCMV response is reduced if cells lack γc signaling ( Decaluwe et al., 2010 ). Interestingly, IL-2 was found to be critical for the maintenance of effector CD8 + T cells in chronic LCMV infections ( Bachmann et al., 2007 ). Here we show that miR-155 enhances cytokine signaling in CD8 + T cells by targeting SOCS-1. Consequently, Mir155 -/- naïve and effector CD8 + T cells failed to mount physiologic levels of pSTAT5 in response to γc cytokines. In line with in vitro experiments using CD4 + T cells ( Lu et al., 2009 ), we observed strong and transient in vivo downregulation of SOCS-1 mRNA in virus-specific CD8 + T cells at day 6 of the response. Interestingly, this occurred in a partially miR-155 independent manner, whereas SOCS-1 protein concentrations of naïve and effector CD8 + T cells were found to be clearly dependent on miR-155. Moreover, we did not detect an impact of miR-155 on pSTAT5 in response to IL-2 in the early effector response in vivo as well as after in vitro priming (unpublished data), whereas the effect was pronounced in naïve and late effector cells. This suggests a miR-155 independent mechanism allowing full cytokine signaling early in the effector response, whereas miR-155 is modulating cytokine signaling in naïve and late effector cells, promoting their accumulation and survival. Interestingly, at the peak of the response, effector CD8 + T cells are reportedly dependent on IL-2 and IL-15 for sustained expansion ( D’Souza and Lefrancois, 2003 ; Sanjabi et al., 2009 ). We were able to confirm a SOCS-1 dependent inhibition of cytokine signaling in Mir155 -/- T cells by transduction with a shSOCS-1 lentivirus in in vitro experiments. Although the formal proof that loss of SOCS-1 in Mir155 -/- CD8 + T cells in vivo would restore their function remains to be shown, the observed rescue of STAT5 phosphorylation in Mir155 -/- cells back to wild type levels suggests that suppression of SOCS-1 in wild type but not Mir155 -/- T cells caused the differences in pSTAT5 signaling. This hypothesis was further supported by our observation that virus specific, SOCS-1 transgenic CD8 + T cells fully differentiated but failed to accumulate to normal numbers at the peak of the LCMV response, which mirrors the phenotype of Mir155 -/- T cells and identifies SOCS-1 as an important regulator of CD8 + T cell responses in vivo . Conversely, suppression of SOCS-1 in tumor specific cells increased the accumulation of transferred cells and subsequently was highly therapeutic in limiting growth of established melanoma. Thus, although a negative role for SOCS-1 in CD8 + T cell responses has been suggested before ( Chong et al., 2003 ; Cornish et al., 2003 ; Davey et al., 2005 ; Marine et al., 1999 ; Palmer and Restifo, 2009 ), we here demonstrate a cell-intrinsic role of SOCS-1 in responses to virus and cancer. Our results of the highly dynamic regulation of SOCS-1 expression in vivo and the strong impact of SOCS-1 alterations in responses to virus and tumor suggests that a major part of the effects caused in CD8 + T cells by miR-155 deletion are due to increased SOCS-1 expression.

In summary, the results presented here identified a crucial cell-intrinsic role of miR-155 and its target SOCS-1 in effector CD8 + T cells, and demonstrated that this miRNA is required for an optimal CTL response to both virus and tumor. Moreover, miR-155 overexpression in tumor specific CD8 + T cells substantially increased their potency, thus providing strong evidence for a clinical potential in the context of therapeutic adoptive T cell transfer.
