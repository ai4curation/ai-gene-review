ROT1 is an essential gene whose inactivation causes defects in cell cycle 
progression and morphogenesis in budding yeast. Rot1 affects the actin 
cytoskeleton during the cell cycle at two levels. First, it is required for the 
maintenance of apical growth during bud growth. Second, Rot1 is necessary to 
polarize actin cytoskeleton to the neck region at the end of mitosis; because of 
this defect, rot1 cells do not properly form a septum to complete cell division. 
The inability to polarize the actin cytoskeleton at the end of mitosis is not 
due to a defect in the recruitment of the polarisome scaffold protein Spa2 or 
the actin cytoskeleton regulators Cdc42 and Cdc24 in the neck region. Previous 
results indicate a connection between Rot1 and the cyclin Clb2. In fact, 
overexpression of CLB2 is toxic when ROT1 is partially inactivated, and 
reciprocally, deletion of CLB2 suppresses the lethality of the rot1 mutant, 
which indicates a functional antagonism between Clb2 and Rot1. Several genetic 
interactions suggest a link between Rot1 and the ubiquitin-proteasome system and 
we show that the Clb2 cyclin is not properly degraded in rot1 cells.
