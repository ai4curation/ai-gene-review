Of the five known dopamine receptors, D1A and D2 represent the major subtypes 
expressed in the striatum of the adult brain. Within the striatum, these two 
subtypes are differentially distributed in the two main neuronal populations 
that provide direct and indirect pathways between the striatum and the output 
nuclei of the basal ganglia. Movement disorders, including Parkinson disease and 
various dystonias, are thought to result from imbalanced activity in these 
pathways. Dopamine regulates movement through its differential effects on D1A 
receptors expressed by direct output neurons and D2 receptors expressed by 
indirect output neurons. To further examine the interaction of D1A and D2 
neuronal pathways in the striatum, we used homologous recombination to generate 
mutant mice lacking functional D1A receptors (D1A-/-). D1A-/- mutants are growth 
retarded and die shortly after weaning age unless their diet is supplemented 
with hydrated food. With such treatment the mice gain weight and survive to 
adulthood. Neurologically, D1A-/- mice exhibit normal coordination and 
locomotion, although they display a significant decrease in rearing behavior. 
Examination of the striatum revealed changes associated with the altered 
phenotype of these mutants. D1A receptor binding was absent in striatal sections 
from D1A-/- mice. Striatal neurons normally expressing functional D1A receptors 
are formed and persist in adult homozygous mutants. Moreover, substance P mRNA, 
which is colocalized specifically in striatal neurons with D1A receptors, is 
expressed at a reduced level. In contrast, levels of enkephalin mRNA, which is 
expressed in striatal neurons with D2 receptors, are unaffected. These findings 
show that D1A-/- mice exhibit selective functional alterations in the striatal 
neurons giving rise to the direct striatal output pathway.
