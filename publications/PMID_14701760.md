Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are highly conserved among all organisms from 
prokaryotes to eukaryotes. In mice, the HSP genes Hsp70.1 and Hsp70.3 are 
induced by both endogenous and exogenous stressors, such as heat and toxicants. 
In order to determine whether such proteins specifically influence genomic 
instability, mice deficient for Hsp70.1 and Hsp70.3 (Hsp70.1/3(-/-) mice) were 
generated by gene targeting. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) prepared from 
Hsp70.1/3(-/-) mice did not synthesize Hsp70.1 or Hsp70.3 after heat-induced 
stress. While the Hsp70.1/3(-/-) mutant mice were fertile, their cells displayed 
genomic instability that was enhanced by heat treatment. Cells from 
Hsp70.1/3(-/-) mice also display a higher frequency of chromosome end-to-end 
associations than do control Hsp70.1/3(+/+) cells. To determine whether observed 
genomic instability was related to defective chromosome repair, Hsp70.1/3(-/-) 
and Hsp70.1/3(+/+) fibroblasts were treated with ionizing radiation (IR) alone 
or heat and IR. Exposure to IR led to more residual chromosome aberrations, 
radioresistant DNA synthesis (a hallmark of genomic instability), increased cell 
killing, and enhanced IR-induced oncogenic transformation in Hsp70.1/3(-/-) 
cells. Heat treatment prior to IR exposure enhanced cell killing, 
S-phase-specific chromosome damage, and the frequency of transformants in 
Hsp70.1/3(-/-) cells in comparison to Hsp70.1/3(+/+) cells. Both in vivo and in 
vitro studies demonstrate for the first time that Hsp70.1 and Hsp70.3 have an 
essential role in maintaining genomic stability under stress conditions.
