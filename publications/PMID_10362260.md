Recently Gadd45, a p53-regulated stress protein, has been implicated in the 
activation of a G2/M checkpoint after damage by UV radiation and alkylating 
agents. While inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 and suppression of cyclin B1 
levels are known to be involved in G2 delays after genotoxic stress, Gadd45 has 
now been found to directly inhibit the activity of Cdc2/Cyclin B1 complex, while 
it had no appreciable effect on Cdk2/ Cyclin E activity even at very high levels 
of Gadd45. In contrast, p21CiP1/Waf1 is an universal cdk/cyclin inhibitor and 
inhibited both of the cyclin complexes tested here. Gadd45 was also able to 
physically interact with Cdc2, but not Cyclin B1. Addition of Gadd45 to 
immunoprecipitated Cdc2/Cyclin B1 in vitro led to a dissociation of this 
complex, and thus may represent a new checkpoint mechanism whereby Cdc2/Cyclin 
B1 can be inhibited. With the use of an antisense approach, reduced Gadd45 
expression attenuated the suppression of Cdc2/Cyclin B1 activity in 
UV-irradiated human cells. Taken together, these results implicate Gadd45 in the 
control of G2/M cell cycle progression after certain stresses.
