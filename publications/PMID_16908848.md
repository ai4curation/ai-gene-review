Bet3 is a component of the transport protein particle complex involved in 
vesicular trafficking to and through the Golgi complex. X-ray structural 
analysis of human and mouse Bet3 revealed a hydrophobic tunnel inside the 
protein, which is occupied by a fatty acid linked to cysteine-68. We show here 
that Bet3 has strong self-palmitoylating activity. Incubation of purified Bet3 
with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA (Pal-CoA) leads to a rapid and stoichiometric attachment 
of fatty acids to cysteine-68. Bet3 has an intrinsic affinity for Pal-CoA, and 
the palmitoylation reaction occurs at physiological pH values and Pal-CoA 
concentrations. Moreover, Bet3 is also efficiently palmitoylated at cysteine-68 
inside vertebrate cells. Palmitoylation can occur late after Bet3 synthesis, but 
once the fatty acids are bound they are not removed, not even by disassembly of 
the Golgi complex. Narrowing the hydrophobic tunnel by exchange of alanine-82 
with bulkier amino acids inhibits palmitoylation, both in vitro and inside 
cells, indicating that the fatty acid must insert into the tunnel for stable 
attachment. Finally, we show that palmitoylation of Bet3 plays a structural 
role. CD spectroscopy reveals that chemically deacylated Bet3 has a reduced 
melting temperature. As a consequence of its structural defect nonacylated Bet3 
does not bind to TPC6, a further subunit of the transport protein particle 
complex, and is degraded inside cells.
