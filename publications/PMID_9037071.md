Activation of the c-Abl protein tyrosine kinase by certain DNA-damaging agents 
contributes to downregulation of Cdk2 and G1 arrest by a p53-dependent 
mechanism. The present work investigates the potential role of c-Abl in 
apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Transient transfection studies with wild-type, 
but not kinase-inactive, c-Abl demonstrate induction of apoptosis. Cells that 
stably express inactive c-Abl exhibit resistance to ionizing radiation-induced 
loss of clonogenic survival and apoptosis. Cells null for c-abl are also 
impaired in the apoptotic response to ionizing radiation. We further show that 
cells deficient in p53 undergo apoptosis in response to expression of c-Abl and 
exhibit decreases in radiation-induced apoptosis when expressing inactive c-Abl. 
These findings suggest that c-Abl kinase regulates DNA damage-induced apoptosis.
