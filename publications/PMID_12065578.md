Changes in the concentration of malonyl-CoA in many tissues have been related to 
alterations in the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the rate-limiting 
enzyme in its formation. In contrast, little is known about the physiological 
role of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD), an enzyme responsible for malonyl-CoA 
catabolism. In this study, we examined the effects of voluntary exercise on MCD 
activity in rat liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. In addition, the 
activity of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), which like MCD and 
ACC can be regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), was assayed. Thirty 
min after the completion of a treadmill run, MCD activity was increased 
approximately 2-fold, malonyl-CoA levels were reduced, and ACC and GPAT 
activities were diminished by 50% in muscle and liver. These events appeared to 
be mediated via activation of AMPK since: 1) AMPK activity was concurrently 
increased by exercise in both tissues; 2) similar findings were observed after 
the injection of 5-amino 4 imidazole carboxamide, an AMPK activator; 3) changes 
in the activity of GPAT and ACC paralleled that of MCD; and 4) the increase in 
MCD activity in muscle was reversed in vitro by incubating immunoprecipitated 
enzyme from the exercised muscle with protein phosphatase 2A, and it was 
reproduced by incubating immunopurified MCD from resting muscle with purified 
AMPK. An unexpected finding was that exercise caused similar changes in the 
activities of ACC, MCD, GPAT, and AMPK and the concentration of malonyl-CoA in 
adipose tissue.
IN CONCLUSION: MCD, GPAT, and ACC are coordinately regulated by AMPK in liver 
and adipose tissue in response to exercise, and except for GPAT, also in muscle. 
The results suggest that AMPK activation plays a major role in regulating lipid 
metabolism in many cells following exercise. They also suggest that in each of 
them, it acts to increase fatty acid oxidation and decrease its esterification.
