Schwann cell migration facilitates peripheral nerve regeneration after injury. 
We have recently found increased activation of Cdc2 kinase in regenerating 
sciatic nerves. Here we show that Cdc2 phosphorylation of caldesmon regulates 
Schwann cell migration and nerve regeneration. A robust but transient increase 
in Cdc2 expression was found in cultured Schwann cells prepared from the sciatic 
nerve in rats that had undergone crush injury for 7 days. These 
;injury-preconditioned' Schwann cells exhibited enhanced migration compared with 
non-preconditioned control cells and treatment with the cdk inhibitor 
roscovitine prevented cell migration. After transduction with recombinant Cdc2 
DNA adenoviral vectors, Schwann cells were implanted into sciatic nerves; those 
expressing wild-type Cdc2 migrated further in the distal direction than those 
expressing dominant-negative Cdc2. We identified caldesmon as a downstream 
substrate of Cdc2 in Schwann cells and its phosphorylation by Cdc2 changed its 
subcellular localization. Overexpression of dominant-negative caldesmon 
significantly counteracted the migration effect caused by Cdc2. Finally, neurite 
outgrowth of cultured DRG sensory neurons, facilitated by co-culture with 
injury-preconditioned Schwann cells, was suppressed by roscovitine treatment. 
The results indicate that activation of the Cdc2-caldesmon pathway is necessary 
for Schwann cell migration and suggest a role for this pathway in peripheral 
axonal growth.
