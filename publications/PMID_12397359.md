The circadian rhythms in mammals are regulated by a pacemaker located in the 
suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. Four clock-gene families have been 
found to be involved in a transcription-translation feedback loop that generates 
the circadian rhythm at the intracellular level. The proteins Clock and Bmal1 
form a heterodimer which activates the transcription of the Per gene from the 
E-box elements in its promoter region. Protein products of Per act together with 
Cry proteins to inhibit Per transcription, thus closing the autoregulatory 
feedback loop. We found that Dec1 and Dec2, basic helix-loop-helix transcription 
factors, repressed Clock/Bmal1-induced transactivation of the mouse Per1 
promoter through direct protein-protein interactions with Bmal1 and/or 
competition for E-box elements. Dec1 and Dec2 are expressed in the suprachiasmic 
nucleus in a circadian fashion, with a peak in the subjective day. A brief light 
pulse induced Dec1 but not Dec2 expression in the suprachiasmic nucleus in a 
phase-dependent manner. Dec1 and Dec2 are regulators of the mammalian molecular 
clock, and form a fifth clock-gene family.
