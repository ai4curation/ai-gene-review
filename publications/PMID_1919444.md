## Abstract

1. J Exp Med. 1991 Oct 1;174(4):949-52. doi: 10.1084/jem.174.4.949.

The lymphocyte glycoprotein CD6 contains a repeated domain structure 
characteristic of a new family of cell surface and secreted proteins.

The isolation, characterization, and expression of a full-length cDNA encoding 
the human T cell glycoprotein CD6 is described. COS cells transfected with the 
CD6 clone express a 90-kD protein that reacts with all available anti-CD6 
monoclonal antibodies. RNA blot hybridization analysis indicates that CD6 
transcripts are predominantly restricted to cells in the T lineage. The 
predicted CD6 sequence is 468 amino acids long, with the typical features of a 
type I integral membrane protein. The cytoplasmic domain of CD6 contains two 
serine residues, one or both of which are substrates for phosphorylation during 
T cell activation. The extracellular domain of CD6 is significantly related to 
the extracellular domain of the human and mouse T cell antigen CD5, the 
cysteine-rich domain of the bovine and mouse type I macrophage scavenger 
receptor, the extracellular domain of the sea urchin spermatozoa protein that 
crosslinks the egg peptide speract, the mammalian complement factor 1, and the 
human lung tumor antigen L3. These molecules, therefore, constitute a new gene 
superfamily that is well conserved across species boundaries.
