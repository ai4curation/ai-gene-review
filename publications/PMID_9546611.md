The expression of hepatic calcium-binding protein regucalcin mRNA in fetal rats 
was investigated. The alteration in regucalcin mRNA levels was analyzed by 
Northern blotting using liver regucalcin cDNA (0.9 kb with complete open reading 
frame). Hepatic regucalcin mRNA levels were progressively increased with fetal 
development; the mRNA was clearly expressed at 15 and 21 days of pregnancy but 
only slightly at the 8 days. Meanwhile, beta-actin mRNA levels in the fetal 
liver were remarkable at 8 and 15 days of pregnancy. The fetal liver regucalcin 
mRNA levels at 15 days of pregnancy were significantly decreased by 
overnight-fasting of maternal rats. The oral administration of calcium chloride 
(50 mg Ca/100 g body weight) to maternal rats at 15 days of pregnancy caused a 
remarkable elevation (about 2 fold) of regucalcin mRNA levels in the fetal 
liver; this increase was seen 60 and 180 min after the calcium administration. 
After birth, regucalcin mRNA was increasingly expressed in the livers of newborn 
and weanling rats, while hepatic beta-actin mRNA expression was not appreciably 
altered with increasing ages. These findings demonstrate that the expression of 
hepatic regucalcin mRNA is increased with fetal development, and that the gene 
expression may be stimulated by the ingestion of dietary calcium.
