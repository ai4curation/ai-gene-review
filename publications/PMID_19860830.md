We have previously shown that casein kinase (CK) Ialpha from mammalian brain 
phosphorylates 14-3-3 zeta and tau isoforms on residue 233. In the present 
study, we show that CKIalpha associates with 14-3-3 both in vitro and in vivo. 
The interaction between CKIalpha and 14-3-3 is dependent on CKIalpha 
phosphorylation, unlike centaurin-alpha1 (also known as ADAP1), which binds to 
unphosphorylated CKIalpha on the same region. CKIalpha preferentially interacts 
with mammalian eta and gamma 14-3-3 isoforms, and peptides that bind to the 
14-3-3 binding pocket prevent this interaction. The region containing Ser218 in 
this CKIalpha binding site was mutated and the interaction between CKIalpha and 
14-3-3 was reduced. We subsequently identified a second 
phosphorylation-dependent 14-3-3 binding site within CKIalpha containing Ser242 
that may be the principal site of interaction. We also show that both fission 
and budding yeast CKI kinase homologues phosphorylate mammalian and budding 
yeast (BMH1 and BMH2) 14-3-3 at the equivalent site.
