Natural killer (NK) cells are a subset of lymphocytes that mediate major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC)-nonrestricted cytotoxicity against tumours and 
virus-infected cells and secrete numerous cytokines on activation. NK cells are 
distinct from mature T lymphocytes, because they do not rearrange or 
productively transcribe T-cell receptor alpha-, beta-, gamma- or delta-chain 
genes and do not express the CD3 gamma- or delta-subunits. But recent studies 
indicate that NK cells do express CD3 zeta, co-associated with other membrane 
proteins. Here we report that CD16, the receptor for the Fc (constant) region of 
IgG, specifically associates with the CD3 zeta homodimer on the membrane of 
human NK cells, and that co-transfection with CD3 zeta complementary DNA permits 
expression of a transmembrane-linked CD16 complex on COS-7 cells. These findings 
indicate that CD3 zeta can co-associate with membrane receptors of diverse cell 
types and function as a common structure for signal transduction.
