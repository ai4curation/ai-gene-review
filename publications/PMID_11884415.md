Tapasin is a subunit of the transporter associated with antigen processing 
(TAP). It associates with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. We 
show that tapasin interacts with beta- and gamma-subunits of COPI coatomer. COPI 
retrieves membrane proteins from the Golgi network back to the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER). The COPI subunit-associated tapasin also interacts with MHC 
class I molecules suggesting that tapasin acts as the cargo receptor for packing 
MHC class I molecules as cargo proteins into COPI-coated vesicles. In tapasin 
mutant cells, neither TAP nor MHC class I are detected in association with the 
COPI coatomer. Interestingly, tapasin-associated MHC class I molecules are 
antigenic peptide-receptive and detected in both the ER and the Golgi. Our data 
suggest that tapasin is required for the COPI vesicle-mediated retrograde 
transport of immature MHC class I molecules from the Golgi network to the ER.
