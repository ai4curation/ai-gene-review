TOX3 is a neuronal survival factor that induces transcription depending on the 
presence of CITED1 or phosphorylated CREB in the transcriptionally active 
complex.

TOX3 is a nuclear protein containing a high mobility group (HMG)-box domain, 
which regulates Ca(2+)-dependent transcription in neurons through interaction 
with the cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB). TOX3 appears to be 
associated with breast cancer susceptibility and was previously shown to be 
expressed downstream of a cytoprotective cascade together with CITED1, a 
transcriptional regulator that does not bind directly to DNA. In the present 
study we show that TOX3 is predominantly expressed in the brain, forms 
homodimers and interacts with CITED1. TOX3 overexpression protects neuronal 
cells from cell death caused by endoplasmic reticulum stress or BAX 
overexpression through the induction of anti-apoptotic transcripts and 
repression of pro-apoptotic transcripts, which correlates with enhanced 
transcription involving isolated estrogen-responsive elements and 
estrogen-responsive promoters. However, both functions cannot be inhibited with 
the anti-estrogen fulvestrant and are only attenuated by mutation of 
estrogen-responsive elements. TOX3 also interacts with native CREB and induces 
the CREB-responsive BCL-2 promoter, which can be inhibited by coexpression of 
CITED1. Coexpression of CREB, by contrast, abolishes TOX3-mediated transcription 
from the estrogen-responsive complement C3 promoter. Our results suggest that 
TOX3 can enhance transcriptional activation from different cytoprotective 
promoters and that this is dependent on the predominance of either 
phosphorylated CREB or CITED1 within the transcriptionally active complex.
