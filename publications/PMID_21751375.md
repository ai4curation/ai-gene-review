In the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, p300/CBP (CREB-binding protein) is recruited by 
nuclear β-catenin to regulate a wide array of T-cell factor (TCF)-dependent gene 
expression. Previous studies have indicated that CBP/β-catenin complex-mediated 
transcription is critical for cell proliferation. Both CBP and β-catenin are 
phosphoproteins. The interaction domain has been mapped to the N-terminal region 
of CBP (amino acids 1-111) and the C-terminal region of β-catenin, but it is 
unclear whether phosphorylation on specific residues of these regions is 
required for the interaction. To address this unmet challenge, phosphoproteomic 
profile of the critical N-terminus of CBP was determined by utilizing TiO(2) 
affinity chromatography followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. Two unique and novel 
phosphorylation sites Ser77 and Ser92 were identified. Further studies aided by 
site-directed mutagenesis, immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid assay 
have concluded that the phosphorylation of a Proline-directed Ser92 residue 
modulates the selective binding ability of CBP with β-catenin. The specific 
Mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor PD98059, which promotes cell cycle G1 
arrest, concomitantly inhibits the interaction, and the evidences suggest that 
the MEK/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) cascade activation is the 
upstream signal required for Ser92 phosphorylation, leading to enhancement of 
the interaction of CBP with β-catenin.
