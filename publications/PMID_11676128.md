The polarized Th2 cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of atopic 
asthma as well as in the induction of airway inflammation. Th2 cytokines, such 
as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, are pivotal in regulating the allergic phenotype, the 
IgE response or the inflammatory cell-mediated function. Selective inhibition of 
Th2 cytokines by pharmacologic agents, including anti-cytokine blocking 
antibody, cytokine mutant and soluble cytokine receptor, will contribute to 
asthma therapy. Strategies based on blocking key signaling cytokines are also 
discussed.
