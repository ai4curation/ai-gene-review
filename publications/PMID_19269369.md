TRIM-NHL proteins represent a large class of metazoan proteins implicated in 
development and disease. We demonstrate that a C. elegans TRIM-NHL protein, 
NHL-2, functions as a cofactor for the microRNA-induced silencing complex 
(miRISC) and thereby enhances the posttranscriptional repression of several 
genetically verified microRNA targets, including hbl-1 and let-60/Ras (by the 
let-7 family of microRNAs) and cog-1 (by the lsy-6 microRNA). NHL-2 is localized 
to cytoplasmic P-bodies and physically associates with the P-body protein CGH-1 
and the core miRISC components ALG-1/2 and AIN-1. nhl-2 and cgh-1 mutations 
compromise the repression of microRNA targets in vivo but do not affect microRNA 
biogenesis, indicating a role for an NHL-2:CGH-1 complex in the effector phase 
of miRISC activity. We propose that the NHL-2:CGH-1 complex functions in 
association with mature miRISC to modulate the efficacy of microRNA:target 
interactions in response to physiological and developmental signals, thereby 
ensuring the robustness of genetic regulatory pathways regulated by microRNAs.
