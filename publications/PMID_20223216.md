Interleukin-13 is a cytokine important for development of T helper cell type 2 
(Th2) responses and plays a critical role in asthma and allergy. The IL-13 
Receptor alpha2 (IL-13Ralpha2) is a receptor for IL-13 lacking canonical 
Jak/STAT signaling functions. Here we present the crystal structure along with a 
mutational and biophysical analysis of the IL-13/IL-13Ralpha2 complex. While 
retaining a similar mode of IL-13 binding to its related signaling receptor, 
IL-13Ralpha1, IL-13Ralpha2 uses peripheral receptor residues unused in the 
IL-13/IL-13Ralpha1 complex to generate a larger and more complementary interface 
for IL-13. This results in a four orders of magnitude increase in affinity, to 
the femtomolar level, compared to IL-13Ralpha1. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of 
the IL-13 interface reveals several common "hotspot" residues important for 
binding to both receptors, but also identifies a prominent IL-13Ralpha2-specific 
contact. These results provide a framework for development of receptor 
subtype-selective IL-13 antagonists and indicate a decoy function for 
IL-13Ralpha2.
