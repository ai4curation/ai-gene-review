The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, 
plays an important role in cell migration by interacting with various proteins. 
In this report, we demonstrated that SHP-2 inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of 
Crk-associated substrate lymphocyte type (Cas-L), a docking protein which 
mediates cell migration, and found that SHP-2 negatively regulates migration of 
A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells induced by fibronectin (FN). We showed that 
overexpressed SHP-2 co-localizes with Cas-L at focal adhesions and that 
exogenous expression of SHP-2 abrogates cell migration mediated by Cas-L. SHP-2 
inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas-L, and associates with Cas-L to form a 
complex in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. Finally, 
immunoprecipitation experiments with deletion mutants revealed that both SH2 
domains of SHP-2 are necessary for this association. These results suggest that 
SHP-2 regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas-L, hence opposing the effect of 
kinases, and SHP-2 is a negative regulator of cell migration mediated by Cas-L.
