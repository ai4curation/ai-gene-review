Congenital cataracts are a common major abnormality of the eye that frequently 
cause blindness in infants. At least a third of all cases are familial; 
autosomal dominant congenital cataract (ADCC) appears to be the most common 
familial form in the Western world. We have mapped an ADCC gene in family ADCC-2 
to chromosome 21q22.3 near the alpha-crystallin gene CRYAA. By sequencing the 
coding regions of CRYAA, we found that a missense mutation, R116C, is associated 
with ADCC in this family.
