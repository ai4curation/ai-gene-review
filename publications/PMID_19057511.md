The PTEN tumour suppressor gene is induced by the early growth response 1 (EGR1) 
transcription factor, which also transactivates p53, p73, and p300/CBP as well 
as other proapoptotic and anti-cancer genes. Here, we describe a novel 
Akt-EGR1-alternate reading frame (ARF)-PTEN axis, in which PTEN activation in 
vivo requires p14ARF-mediated sumoylation of EGR1. This modification is 
dependent on the phosphorylation of EGR1 at S350 and T309 by Akt, which promotes 
interaction of EGR1 with ARF at K272 in its repressor domain by the 
ARF/Ubc9/SUMO system. EGR1 sumoylation is decreased by ARF reduction, and no 
EGR1 sumoylation is detected in ARF(-/-) mice, which also exhibit reduced 
amounts of PTEN. Our model predicts that perturbation of any of the clinically 
important tumour suppressors, PTEN, EGR1, and ARF, will cause some degree of 
dysfunction of the others. These results also explain the known negative 
feedback regulation by PTEN on its own synthesis through PI3 kinase inhibition.

Abstract

The PTEN tumour suppressor gene is induced by the early growth response 1 (EGR1) transcription factor, which also transactivates p53, p73, and p300/CBP as well as other proapoptotic and anti-cancer genes. Here, we describe a novel Akt–EGR1–alternate reading frame (ARF)–PTEN axis, in which PTEN activation in vivo requires p14ARF-mediated sumoylation of EGR1. This modification is dependent on the phosphorylation of EGR1 at S350 and T309 by Akt, which promotes interaction of EGR1 with ARF at K272 in its repressor domain by the ARF/Ubc9/SUMO system. EGR1 sumoylation is decreased by ARF reduction, and no EGR1 sumoylation is detected in ARF −/− mice, which also exhibit reduced amounts of PTEN. Our model predicts that perturbation of any of the clinically important tumour suppressors, PTEN, EGR1, and ARF, will cause some degree of dysfunction of the others. These results also explain the known negative feedback regulation by PTEN on its own synthesis through PI3 kinase inhibition.

Introduction

PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue, deleted on chromosome 10) is one of the most frequently lost tumour suppressors in human cancer ( Li et al , 1997 ; Teng et al , 1997 ). The PTEN gene can be damaged by mutation ( Priulla et al , 2007 ) or silenced by epigenetic mechanisms ( Mirmohammadsadegh et al , 2006 ), and PTEN protein stability or function can be reduced by other mechanisms ( Priulla et al , 2007 ). However, in many cancers, the PTEN gene is intact, but appears to be transcriptionally silent. PTEN is a rapidly degraded protein with a half-life (T 1/2 ) of only 2–4 h (depending on cell type), and it appears that many of the genetic alterations found in PTEN in cancer cells further accelerate this rapid degradation ( Davies et al , 1999 ). Thus, PTEN function is critically dependent on de novo synthesis to replenish the pool. We discovered that the early growth response gene 1 ( EGR1 ) transcription factor ( Sukhatme et al , 1988 ) binds directly to a consensus EGR1-binding motif in the PTEN promoter, activates gene transcription, and is necessary for upregulation of PTEN mRNA in response to UV and γ-irradiation and other stress stimuli ( Virolle et al , 2001 ). PTEN transcription can also be induced by p53 ( Stambolic et al , 2001 ), which binds to a site in the promoter close to the EGR1-binding site. Taken together with reports that PTEN and p53 can form a complex ( Mayo and Donner, 2002 ) and our finding that EGR1 transactivates p53 and p73 ( Yu et al , 2007 ), which also transactivates p53, it seems that EGR1, PTEN, and p53 form an intimately connected regulatory network, the understanding of which could be vital to targeted cancer therapy. EGR1 is receiving much attention recently because of its wide range of activities as a transcription factor. Remarkably, EGR1 can exert an effect either as a growth promoter or as a tumour suppressor. EGR1 can also be induced by mutant p53 to contribute to gain of tumour-transforming function ( Weisz et al , 2004 ). In contrast, EGR1 is also upregulated by growth factor addition to normal cells. This may result in cell proliferation or, as described here, suppress cell proliferation or induce apoptosis of transformed or cancer cells; and the alternate reading frame (ARF) protein expedites this latter effect.

The ARF protein (p19ARF in mouse and p14ARF in human) is a product of ARF of the CDKN2A locus. ARF functions mainly as a tumour suppressor essential for ARF–MDM2–p53 pathway ( Zhang et al , 1998 ) and the Rb–E2F-1 pathway ( Dimri et al , 2000 ). ARF has a p53-independent function, promoting the sumoylation of several ARF-interacting proteins, such as Topoisomerase I ( Karayan et al , 2001 ), MDM2 ( Xirodimas et al , 2002 ), Werners helicase ( Woods et al , 2004 ) as well as p53 ( Chen and Chen, 2003 ), and the proteasome-dependent degradation of CtBP ( Paliwal et al , 2007 ).

Here, we show that IGF-1-activated AKT leads to phosphorylation of EGR1 followed by sumoylation of EGR1 by ARF, thereby producing a new modified molecule that directly transactivates the PTEN promoter. The resulting PTEN provides one of many pathways showing how EGR1 can stimulate growth or apoptosis, through specific pathways for each different outcome.

Discussion

Both EGR1 and p53 transcription factors have major functions in controlling cell proliferation, and together they can additively suppress transformed growth ( de Belle et al , 1999 ). Whereas p53 expression is associated with tumour suppression and apoptosis, EGR1 has dual functions in cell proliferation and in the promotion of apoptosis ( Huang et al , 1998 ; Krones-Herzig et al , 2005 ). There are also several instances of interaction between EGR1 and p53, and the most important is the ability of each of the two transcription factors to induce the transcription of the other ( Yu et al , 2007 ). Although p53 is more frequently inactivated in cancer cells compared with EGR1, the latter can also induce the p53-related p73 ( Yu et al , 2007 ) to cause tumour suppression. In some conditions, p53 also binds to EGR1 to interfere or modify transcriptional activities ( Liu et al , 2001 ).

Although EGR1 was first shown to be activated by growth factors and to stimulate proliferation of cells, we here show that the activation of Akt by IGF-1 leads to the phosphorylation of EGR1 at T309 and S350. The activation of EGR1 continues by its migration to the nucleolus ( Figure 5C ), where ARF-mediated sumoylation of EGR1 occurs, and where ARF and nucleophosmin have accumulated ( den Besten et al , 2006 ). Sumoylation of other transcription factors has been described before, for example, for p53 ( Chen and Chen, 2003 ). The process requires interaction of ARF with Ubc9/SUMO1, to cause the 80 kDa EGR1 protein to become the reactive 100 kDa molecule, SUMO1-EGR1. This modified form in the nucleolus appears to have an increased ability to induce PTEN transcription, thus providing the tumour suppressor activity through PTEN. This is a notable pathway owing to the fact that IGF-1 can cause the switch of functions of its transcription factor target, EGR1, to exert an effect as an inhibitor of growth factor-stimulated cancer cells.

Our data demonstrate that EGR1 is important for PTEN transcription in response to irradiation or IGF-1 and that this activity of EGR1 is controlled by ARF and EGR1 sumoylation. This implies that loss of EGR1, or loss of ARF, in cancer cells would be expected to lead to reduced PTEN expression as well. Indeed, EGR1 is often downregulated or lost in human cancer and in immortalized cell lines, such as HT1080 human fibrosarcoma ( Liu et al , 1999 ) and many glial and breast tumour cell lines ( Huang et al , 1997 ). In EGR1-deficient cell lines, re-introduction of EGR1 suppresses transformation and tumorigenicity ( Huang and Adamson, 1995 ; Liu et al , 1999 ). Allelic deletions of EGR1 have been associated with the premalignant condition, myelodysplastic syndrome ( Le Beau et al , 1993 ), and with the development of acute myeloid leukaemia ( Horrigan et al , 1996 ) and small cell and non-small cell lung carcinoma ( Levin et al , 1995 ).

In both EGR1 −/− and ARF −/− mice, p53 is poorly induced upon γ-irradiation. This is at least partly because of the function of EGR1 in the transcription of p53 ( Krones-Herzig et al , 2005 ) and PTEN. Also at the protein level, p53 associates with nuclear PTEN protein ( Mayo and Donner, 2002 ; Mao et al , 2003 ), as well as with EGR1 and ARF. In addition, the promoter region of the ARF gene contains several perfect-match EGR1-binding sites, and ARF transcription is readily induced by EGR1 ( Supplementary Figure S8 ). Thus, these connections constitute an elaborate tumour suppressor network ( Figure 7F ), the perturbation of which appears to be common in human cancer. Further interactions, such as the ability of EGR1 to induce p53, together with a reverse positive feedback ( Yu et al , 2007 ), also modify the resulting expression levels of the interacting genes in the network described here, thus affecting the time of onset of tumour formation in each tissue of ARF −/− mice.

In addition to using ARF −/− MEFs to demonstrate the actions of ARF, we also used HeLa and 293T as readily transfectable cells that lack active p53. HeLa cells possess wild-type p53, but due to the expression of HPV-encoded E6 and E7 oncoproteins, both p53 and retinoblastoma functions are inactivated. p53, for example, undergoes accelerated degradation and is undetectable in these cells ( Wesierska-Gadek et al , 2002 ). Similarly p53 in 293T cells is disabled by the E1B and SV40 T-antigen used to immortalize the cells, and is therefore non-functional ( Tago et al , 2005 ; Sherr, 2006 ). We also tested the effect of the transfection of siRNA to p53 into HeLa cells to measure the effect on PTEN levels in growing HeLa cells. However, p53 protein was undetectable even in normal-growing HeLa cells. Therefore, in these cells, ARF is elevated independently of p53 and can be tested for the requirement of EGR1 for PTEN transcription in the absence of p53, which is also a known inducer of PTEN ( Stambolic et al , 2001 ) and can also bind to EGR1( Liu et al , 2001 ). Using these cells, we examined why ARF is needed for EGR1 function as a transcription factor.

PTEN transcription is controlled by several pathways that involve many transcription factors. In this study, we describe a novel multiple-stage pathway of PTEN transcription through a novel AKT–EGR1–ARF–PTEN axis and demonstrate its importance in cells and mice. ARF −/− tissues expressed much less PTEN when compared with ARF +/+ tissues; however, PTEN in the former was still detectable at the protein level ( Figure 1C ) and also inducible at the mRNA level ( Figure 1B ) after γ-irradiation, which involves other pathways, for example, PTEN transcription can also be induced by p53. Interestingly, studies show that the tumour suppressor effects of ARF and PTEN cooperate to reduce sarcomas ( Carrasco et al , 2006 ). PTEN +/− ARF −/− has effects beyond ARF −/− alone on histiocytic sarcoma ( Carrasco et al , 2006 ), probably due to PTEN expression that was reduced rather than absent in ARF −/− tissues. Also, there are other complex interactions with these two proteins that may occur. Therefore, it could not be simply concluded that ARF loss is a phenotype copy of PTEN loss.

Finally, as shown in the summary in Figure 7F , the target gene product, PTEN, also has a negative activity on its own production at the stage of interfering with the phosphorylation of Akt as the first step in the promotion of EGR1 as a tumour suppressor, following the steps outlined above. Thus, some feedback inhibition of the tumour suppressor activity of PTEN follows this additional effect.
