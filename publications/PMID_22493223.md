The spindle checkpoint prevents aneuploidy by delaying anaphase onset until all 
sister chromatids achieve proper microtubule attachment. The kinetochore-bound 
checkpoint protein complex Mad1-Mad2 promotes the conformational activation of 
Mad2 and serves as a catalytic engine of checkpoint signaling. How Mad1 is 
targeted to kinetochores is not understood. Here, we report the crystal 
structure of the conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) of human Mad1. Mad1 CTD forms 
a homodimer and, unexpectedly, has a fold similar to those of the 
kinetochore-binding domains of Spc25 and Csm1. Nonoverlapping Mad1 fragments 
retain detectable kinetochore targeting. Deletion of the CTD diminishes, does 
not abolish, Mad1 kinetochore localization. Mutagenesis studies further map the 
functional interface of Mad1 CTD in kinetochore targeting and implicate Bub1 as 
its receptor. Our results indicate that CTD is a part of an extensive 
kinetochore-binding interface of Mad1, and rationalize graded kinetochore 
targeting of Mad1 during checkpoint signaling.
