OBJECTIVE: Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2P (CMT2P) has been associated with 
frameshift mutations in the RING domain of LRSAM1 (an E3 ligase). This study 
describes families with a novel missense mutation of LRSAM1 gene and explores 
pathogenic mechanisms of CMT2P.
METHODS: Patients with CMT2P were characterized clinically, 
electrophysiologically, and genetically. A neuronal model with the LRSAM1 
mutation was created using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The neuronal cell line along 
with fibroblasts isolated from the patients was used to study RNA-binding 
proteins.
RESULTS: This American family with dominantly inherited axonal polyneuropathy 
reveals a phenotype similar to those in previously reported non-US families. The 
affected members in our family cosegregated with a novel missense mutation 
Cys694Arg that alters a highly conserved cysteine in the RING domain. This 
mutation leads to axonal degeneration in the in vitro neuronal cell line. 
Moreover, using protein mass spectrometry, we identified a group of RNA-binding 
proteins (including FUS, a protein critically involved in motor neuron 
degeneration) that interacted with LRSAM1. The interactions were disrupted by 
the Cys694Arg mutation, which resulted in reduction of intranuclear RNA-binding 
proteins.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that the mutant LRSAM1 may aberrantly 
affect the formation of transcription machinery. Given that a similar mechanism 
has been reported in motor neuron degeneration of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
abnormalities of RNA/RNA-binding protein complex may play a role in the neuronal 
degeneration of CMT2P. Ann Neurol 2016;80:834-845.
