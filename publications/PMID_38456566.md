The plant cuticle is composed of cuticular wax and cutin polymers and plays an 
essential role in plant tolerance to diverse abiotic and biotic stresses. 
Several stresses, including water deficit and salinity, regulate the synthesis 
of cuticular wax and cutin monomers. However, the effect of wounding on wax and 
cutin monomer production and the associated molecular mechanisms remain unclear. 
In this study, we determined that the accumulation of wax and cutin monomers in 
Arabidopsis leaves is positively regulated by wounding primarily through the 
jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway. Moreover, we observed that a wound- and 
JA-responsive gene (CYP96A4) encoding an ER-localized cytochrome P450 enzyme was 
highly expressed in leaves. Further analyses indicated that wound-induced wax 
and cutin monomer production was severely inhibited in the cyp96a4 mutant. 
Furthermore, CYP96A4 interacted with CER1 and CER3, the core enzymes in the 
alkane-forming pathway associated with wax biosynthesis, and modulated CER3 
activity to influence aldehyde production in wax synthesis. In addition, 
transcripts of MYC2 and JAZ1, key genes in JA signaling pathway, were 
significantly reduced in cyp96a4 mutant. Collectively, these findings 
demonstrate that CYP96A4 functions as a cofactor of the alkane synthesis complex 
or participates in JA signaling pathway that contributes to cuticular wax 
biosynthesis and cutin monomer formation in response to wounding.
