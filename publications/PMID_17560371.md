G1 cyclin Cln3 plays a key role in linking cell growth and proliferation in 
budding yeast. It is generally assumed that Cln3, which is present throughout 
G1, accumulates passively in the nucleus until a threshold is reached to trigger 
cell cycle entry. We show here that Cln3 is retained bound to the ER in early G1 
cells. ER retention requires binding of Cln3 to the cyclin-dependent kinase 
Cdc28, a fraction of which also associates to the ER. Cln3 contains a 
chaperone-regulatory Ji domain that counteracts Ydj1, a J chaperone essential 
for ER release and nuclear accumulation of Cln3 in late G1. Finally, Ydj1 is 
limiting for release of Cln3 and timely entry into the cell cycle. As protein 
synthesis and ribosome assembly rates compromise chaperone availability, we 
hypothesize that Ydj1 transmits growth capacity information to the cell cycle 
for setting efficient size/ploidy ratios.
