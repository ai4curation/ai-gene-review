ATG9A is the only polytopic protein of the mammalian autophagy-related protein 
family whose members regulate autophagosome formation during macroautophagy. At 
steady state, ATG9A localizes to several intracellular sites, including the 
Golgi apparatus, endosomes and the plasma membrane, and it redistributes towards 
autophagosomes upon autophagy induction. Interestingly, the transport of yeast 
Atg9 to the pre-autophagosomal structure depends on its self-association, which 
is mediated by a short amino acid motif located in the C-terminal region of the 
protein. Here, we investigated whether the residues that align with this motif 
in human ATG9A (V515-C519) are also required for its trafficking in mammalian 
cells. Interestingly, our findings support that human ATG9A self-interacts as 
well, and that this process promotes transport of ATG9A molecules through the 
Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, our data reveal that the transport of ATG9A out of 
the ER is severely impacted after mutation of the conserved V515-C519 motif. 
Nevertheless, the mutated ATG9A molecules could still interact with each other, 
indicating that the molecular mechanism of self-interaction differs in mammalian 
cells compared to yeast. Using sequential amino acid substitutions of glycine 
516 and cysteine 519, we found that the stability of ATG9A relies on both of 
these residues, but that only the former is required for efficient transport of 
human ATG9A from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.
