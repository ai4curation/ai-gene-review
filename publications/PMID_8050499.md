Growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) have been found to 
promote the survival and proliferation of endothelial cells. However, the 
mechanism by which growth factors control the regeneration and degeneration of 
the endothelial cells remained poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated 
that apoptosis of murine aortic endothelial (MAE) cells was induced by 
deprivation of bFGF but required new RNA and protein synthesis. Furthermore, 
enforced expression of bcl-2 gene in MAE cells using gene transfer techniques 
decreased apoptosis induced by deprivation of bFGF. These findings suggest that 
bcl-2 interferes with a pathway for endothelial cell death that is induced by 
deprivation of bFGF.
