EG-1 is significantly elevated in breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers. 
Overexpression of EG-1 stimulates cellular proliferation, and targeted 
inhibition blocks mouse xenograft tumor growth. To further clarify the function 
of EG-1, we investigated its role in c-Src activation. We observed that EG-1 
overexpression results in activation of c-Src, but found no evidence that EG-1 
is a direct Src substrate. EG-1 also binds to other members of the Src family. 
Furthermore, EG-1 shows interaction with multiple other SH3- and WW-containing 
molecules involved in various signaling pathways. These observations suggest 
that EG-1 may be involved in signaling pathways including c-Src activation.
