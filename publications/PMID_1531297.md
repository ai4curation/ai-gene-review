Mercuric ion reductase (MerA) catalyzes the reduction of Hg(II) to Hg(0) as the 
last step in the bacterial mercury detoxification pathway. A member of the 
flavin disulfide oxidoreductase family, MerA contains an FAD prosthetic group 
and redox-active disulfide in its active site. However, the presence of these 
two moieties is not sufficient for catalytic Hg(II) reduction, as other enzyme 
family members are potently inhibited by mercurials. We have previously 
identified a second pair of active site cysteines (Cys558 Cys559 in the Tn501 
enzyme) unique to MerA, that are essential for high levels of mercuric ion 
reductase activity [Moore, M. J., & Walsh, C. T. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 1183; 
Miller, S. M., et al. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 1194]. In this paper, we have 
examined the individual roles of Cys558 and Cys559 by site-directed mutagenesis 
of each to alanine. Phenotypic analysis indicates that both merA mutations 
result in a total disruption of the Hg(II) detoxification pathway in vivo, while 
characterization of the purified mutant enzymes in vitro shows each to have 
differential effects on catalytic function. Compared to wild-type enzyme, the 
C558A mutant shows a 20-fold reduction in kcat and a 10-fold increase in Km, for 
an overall decrease in catalytic efficiency of 200-fold in kcat/Km. In contrast, 
mutation of Cys559 to alanine results in less than a 2-fold reduction in kcat 
and an increase in Km of only 4-5 fold for an overall decrease in catalytic 
efficiency of only ca. 10-fold in vitro. From these results, it appears that 
Cys558 plays a more important role in forming the reducible complex with Hg(II), 
while both Cys558 and Cys559 seem to be involved in efficient scavenging (i.e., 
tight binding) of Hg(II).
