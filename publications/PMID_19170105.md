Cell cycle progression into S phase requires the induction of histone gene 
expression to package newly synthesized DNA as chromatin. Cyclin E stimulation 
of CDK2 at the Restriction point late in G1 controls both histone gene 
expression by the p220(NPAT)/HiNF-P pathway and initiation of DNA replication 
through the pRB/E2F pathway. The three CDK inhibitors (CKIs) p21(CIP1/WAF1), 
p27(KIP1), and p57(KIP2) attenuate CDK2 activity. Here we find that 
gamma-irradiation induces p21(CIP1/WAF1) but not the other two CKIs, while 
reducing histone H4 mRNA levels but not histone H4 gene promoter activation by 
the p220(NPAT)/HiNF-P complex. We also show that p21(CIP1/WAF1) is less 
effective than p27(KIP1) and p57(KIP2) in inhibiting the CDK2 dependent 
phosphorylation of p220(NPAT) at subnuclear foci and transcriptional activation 
of histone H4 genes. The greater effectiveness of p57(KIP2) in blocking the 
p220(NPAT)/HiNF-P pathway is attributable in part to its ability to form a 
specific complex with p220(NPAT) that may suppress CDK2/cyclin E phosphorylation 
through direct substrate inhibition. We conclude that CKIs selectively control 
stimulation of the histone H4 gene promoter by the p220(NPAT)/HiNF-P complex.

Abstract

Cell cycle progression into S phase requires the induction of histone gene expression to package newly synthesized DNA as chromatin. Cyclin E stimulation of CDK2 at the Restriction point late in G1 controls both histone gene expression by the p220 NPAT /HiNF-P pathway and initiation of DNA replication through the pRB/E2F pathway. The three CDK inhibitors (CKIs) p21 CIP1/WAF1 , p27 KIP1 and p57 KIP2 attenuate CDK2 activity. Here we find that γ-irradiation induces p21 CIP1/WAF1 but not the other two CKIs, while reducing histone H4 mRNA levels but not histone H4 gene promoter activation by the p220 NPAT /HiNF-P complex. We also show that p21 CIP1/WAF1 is less effective than p27 KIP1 and p57 KIP2 in inhibiting the CDK2 dependent phosphorylation of p220 NPAT at subnuclear foci and transcriptional activation of histone H4 genes. The greater effectiveness of p57 KIP2 in blocking the p220 NPAT /HiNF-P pathway is attributable in part to its ability to form a specific complex with p220 NPAT that may suppress CDK2/cyclin E phosphorylation through direct substrate inhibition. We conclude that CKIs selectively control stimulation of the histone H4 gene promoter by the p220 NPAT /HiNF-P complex.

DISCUSSION

The cyclin E/CDK2 dependent phosphorylation of pRB and p220 NPAT ensures that E2F and HiNF-P can activate their respective target genes, thus mechanistically separating the onset of histone production from DNA replication at the G1/S phase transition ( Fig. 9 ). Release of E2F from pRB can be inhibited by p57 KIP2 , p27 KIP1 or p21 CIP1/WAF1 with each preventing phosphorylation of pRB by blocking the activity of CDK2/Cyclin E kinase ( Sherr and Roberts, 2004 ). Our study shows that activity of the p220 NPAT /HiNF-P transcriptional co-activation complex is also directly controlled by CKIs. CKIs prevent phosphorylation by CDK2 of at least two phospho-epitopes of p220 NPAT that stimulate the functional activity of the p220 NPAT /HiNF-P complex. However, our studies suggest that p57 KIP2 is more potent than p27 KIP1 or p21 CIP1/WAF1 in blocking thein situ phosphorylation of p220 NPAT at Cajal Body-related subnuclear foci.

Interestingly, p57 KIP2 has weaker intrinsic CDK2 inhibitory activity than p27 KIP1 and our data suggest p57 KIP2 may compensate for weaker CDK2 inhibition by forming a complex with its substrate p220 NPAT . The question arises how p57 KIP2 but not p27 KIP1 or p21 CIP/WAF1 can selectively recognize p220 NPAT . The C-terminal sequences (e.g., PAPA repeats) of p57 KIP2 differ from the other two CKIs (p27 KIP1 and p21 CIP1/WAF1 ), and a chimeric protein that contains the C-terminus of p57 KIP2 fused to the cyclin binding domain of p27 KIP1 is as effective as the wild type p57 KIP2 protein in blocking p220 NPAT /HiNF-P activity. The unique structure of p57 KIP2 may provide the requisite specificity for direct interactions with p220 NPAT and thus endow p57 KIP2 with its ability to suppress the function of p220 NPAT more effectively. However, CKIs are unstructured in solution when they do not interact with their cognate cyclin/CDK complexes ( Lacy et al, 2004 ; Adkins and Lumb, 2002 ). Therefore, it is conceivable that p57 KIP2 may interact with p220 NPAT through a cyclin/CDK protein bridge with the unique C-terminus of p57 KIP2 stabilizing the ternary complex. Interestingly, both p57 KIP2 and p220 NPAT are CDK2 substrates and contain cyclin binding motifs which could permit formation of larger complexes and/or an exchange of components (e.g., cyclin E or CDK2). Consistent with this model, the cyclin binding motif and unique C-terminus of p57 KIP2 , as well as the CDK2 phosphorylation sites of p220 NPAT , are each required for the formation of complexes containing these two proteins.

It remains to be established whether the regulation of the p220 NPAT /HiNF-P complex occurs only at the level of protein/protein interactions or may also reflect promoter recruitment. We have been unable to detect p57 on the H4 gene promoter, possibly for technical reasons (e.g., detection of promoter-bound p57 may require multiple protein/DNA and protein/protein cross-links). Similarly, it will be of future interest to examine whether phosphorylation of p220 NPAT at the T1270 and T1350 phospho-epitopes affects recruitment of p220 NPAT to the H4 promoter. However, it is clear from our previous studies ( Miele et al, 2005 ; Holmes et al, 2005 ; Mitra et al, 2007 ) that recruitment of both HiNF-P and p220 NPAT to histone H4 gene promoters is detected in both T98G cells where p57 levels are below the level of detection, and in HeLa cells that express robust levels of p57. Thus, it appears that recruitment of HiNF-P and p220 NPAT to H4 gene promoters is independent of p57 KIP2 .

We have previously shown that exogenous HiNF-P cannot activate H4 gene transcription if endogenous levels of p57 KIP2 are high ( Mitra et al, 2006 ). Consistent with these findings, the data presented here indicate that p57 KIP2 is the most effective CKI in suppressing gene activation by the p220 NPAT /HiNF-P complex and operates via the HiNF-P binding motif in the cell cycle domain of histone H4 gene promoters. Furthermore, Skp2-dependent degradation and siRNA induced deficiency of p57 KIP2 can each alleviate inhibition of the p220 NPAT /HiNF-P pathway in cells that express p57 KIP2 . Depletion of p57 KIP2 levels by siRNA also alters the relative expression of different histone H4 gene copies. Taken together, we propose that one of the biological functions of p57 KIP2 in vivo is to control the activity of p220 NPAT as a co-activator of the HiNF-P mediated stimulation of histone H4 gene promoter activity.

The greater effectiveness of p57 KIP2 to block the function of the HiNF-P/p220 NPAT complex on the H4 gene promoter is consistent with cell type specific differences in the expression of this CKI in relation to the other two CKI members. For example, during myoblast differentiation, p57 KIP2 is upregulated in parallel with p21 CIP1/WAF1 , while p57 KIP2 and p27 KIP1 are selectively expressed in differentiated osteoblasts ( Drissi et al, 1999 ; Urano et al, 1999 ). In both mesenchymal lineages, the elevated expression of p57 KIP2 will support efficient inhibition of histone H4 gene transcription at the onset of quiescence during differentiation. However, the majority of proliferating cells express p57 KIP2 only at very low levels and its function in blocking histone H4 gene expression may be mostly restricted to quiescent cells. In comparison, the physiological elevation of p21 CIP1/WAF1 during the DNA damage response in proliferating cells may preferentially permit continued signaling through the CDK2 responsive p220 NPAT /HiNF-P pathway but not the E2F/RB pathway to allow histone gene transcription during DNA repair.
