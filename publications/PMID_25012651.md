Ki67 is a protein widely used as cell-proliferation marker, with its cellular 
functions being hardly unveiled. In this paper, we present the direct 
interaction between Ki67 and PP1γ, a protein phosphatase showing characteristic 
accumulation on anaphase chromosomes via the canonical PP1-binding motif within 
Ki67. In cells depleted of Ki67, PP1γ is targeted to anaphase chromosomes less 
efficiently. Additionally, overexpression of Ki67, but not a mutant form without 
the ability to bind PP1γ, induced ectopic localization of PP1γ οn metaphase 
chromosomes. These observations demonstrate that Ki67 is one factor that defines 
the cellular behavior of PP1γ in anaphase. To explore the specific roles of the 
subset of PP1γ recruited on chromosome via its interaction with Ki67 
(PP1γ-Ki67), endogenous Ki67 was replaced with a Ki67 mutant deficient in its 
ability to interact with PP1γ. Although no obvious defects in the progression of 
mitosis were observed, the timing of dephosphorylation of the mutant Ki67 in 
anaphase was delayed, indicating that Ki67 itself is one of the substrates of 
PP1γ-Ki67.
