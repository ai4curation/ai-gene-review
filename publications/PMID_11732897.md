The structures of a series of complexes designed to mimic intermediates along 
the reaction coordinate for beta-galactosidase are presented. These complexes 
clarify and enhance previous proposals regarding the catalytic mechanism. The 
nucleophile, Glu537, is seen to covalently bind to the galactosyl moiety. Of the 
two potential acids, Mg(2+) and Glu461, the latter is in better position to 
directly assist in leaving group departure, suggesting that the metal ion acts 
in a secondary role. A sodium ion plays a part in substrate binding by directly 
ligating the galactosyl 6-hydroxyl. The proposed reaction coordinate involves 
the movement of the galactosyl moiety deep into the active site pocket. For 
those ligands that do bind deeply there is an associated conformational change 
in which residues within loop 794-804 move up to 10 A closer to the site of 
binding. In some cases this can be inhibited by the binding of additional 
ligands. The resulting restricted access to the intermediate helps to explain 
why allolactose, the natural inducer for the lac operon, is the preferred 
product of transglycosylation.
