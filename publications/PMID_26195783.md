Repeated regions are widespread in eukaryotic genomes, and key functional 
elements such as the ribosomal DNA tend to be formed of high copy repeated 
sequences organized in tandem arrays. In general, high copy repeats are 
remarkably stable, but a number of organisms display rapid ribosomal DNA 
amplification at specific times or under specific conditions. Here we 
demonstrate that target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling stimulates ribosomal DNA 
amplification in budding yeast, linking external nutrient availability to 
ribosomal DNA copy number. We show that ribosomal DNA amplification is regulated 
by three histone deacetylases: Sir2, Hst3, and Hst4. These enzymes control 
homologous recombination-dependent and nonhomologous recombination-dependent 
amplification pathways that act in concert to mediate rapid, directional 
ribosomal DNA copy number change. Amplification is completely repressed by 
rapamycin, an inhibitor of the nutrient-responsive TOR pathway; this effect is 
separable from growth rate and is mediated directly through Sir2, Hst3, and 
Hst4. Caloric restriction is known to up-regulate expression of nicotinamidase 
Pnc1, an enzyme that enhances Sir2, Hst3, and Hst4 activity. In contrast, normal 
glucose concentrations stretch the ribosome synthesis capacity of cells with low 
ribosomal DNA copy number, and we find that these cells show a previously 
unrecognized transcriptional response to caloric excess by reducing PNC1 
expression. PNC1 down-regulation forms a key element in the control of ribosomal 
DNA amplification as overexpression of PNC1 substantially reduces ribosomal DNA 
amplification rate. Our results reveal how a signaling pathway can orchestrate 
specific genome changes and demonstrate that the copy number of repetitive DNA 
can be altered to suit environmental conditions.
