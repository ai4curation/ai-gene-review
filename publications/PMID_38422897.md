Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are fatty acids with a carbon chain length 
greater than 18 carbons (>C18) and exhibit various functions, such as in skin 
barrier formation, liver homeostasis, myelin maintenance, spermatogenesis, 
retinal function, and anti-inflammation. VLCFAs are absorbed by dietary or 
elongated from endogenous hexadecanoyl acids (C16). Similar to long-chain fatty 
acid synthesis, VLCFAs elongation begins with acyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA as 
sources, and the length of the acyl chain is extended by two carbon units in 
each cycle. However, the VLCFAs elongation machinery is located in ER membrane 
and consists of four components, FA elongase (ELOVL), 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase 
(KAR), 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase (HACD), and trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase 
(TECR), which is different with the long-chain fatty acid machinery fatty acid 
synthase (FAS) complex. Although the critical components in the elongation cycle 
are identified, the detailed catalytic and regulation mechanisms are still 
poorly understood. Here, we focused on the structural and biochemical analysis 
of TECR-associated VLCFA elongation reactions. Firstly, we identified a stable 
complex of human HACD2-TECR based on extensive in vitro characterizations. 
Combining computational modeling and biochemical analysis, we confirmed the 
critical interactions between TECR and HACD1/2. Then, we proposed the putative 
substrate binding sites and catalytic residues for TECR and HACD2. Besides, we 
revealed the structural similarities of HACD with ELOVLs and proposed the 
possible competition mechanism of TECR-associated complex formation.
