Plakophilin 2, a member of the arm-repeat protein family, is a dual location 
protein that occurs both in the cytoplasmic plaques of desmosomes as an 
architectural component and in an extractable form in the nucleoplasm. Here we 
report the existence of two nuclear particles containing plakophilin 2 and the 
largest subunit of RNA polymerase (pol) III (RPC155), both of which colocalize 
and are coimmunoselected with other pol III subunits and with the transcription 
factor TFIIIB. We also show that plakophilin 2 is present in the pol III 
holoenzyme, but not the core complex, and that it binds specifically to RPC155 
in vitro. We propose the existence of diverse nuclear particles in which 
proteins known as plaque proteins of intercellular junctions are complexed with 
specific nuclear proteins.
