The bioinformatics of a nine-gene locus, designated selenocysteine-assisted 
organometallic (SAO), was investigated after identifying six new selenoprotein 
families and constructing hidden Markov models (HMMs) that find and annotate 
members of those families. Four are selenoproteins in most SAO loci, including 
Clostridium difficile. They include two ABC transporter subunits, namely, 
permease SaoP, with selenocysteine (U) at the channel-gating position, and 
substrate-binding subunit SaoB. Cytosolic selenoproteins include SaoL, 
homologous to MerB organomercurial lyases from mercury resistance loci, and 
SaoT, related to thioredoxins. SaoL, SaoB, and surface protein SaoC (an 
occasional selenoprotein) share an unusual CU dipeptide motif, which is 
something rare in selenoproteins but found in selenoprotein variants of mercury 
resistance transporter subunit MerT. A nonselenoprotein, SaoE, shares homology 
with Cu/Zn efflux and arsenical efflux pumps. The organization of the SAO system 
suggests substrate interaction with surface-exposed selenoproteins, followed by 
import, metabolism that may cleave a carbon-to-heavy metal bond, and finally 
metal efflux. A novel type of mercury resistance is possible, but SAO instead 
may support fermentative metabolism, with selenocysteine-mediated formation of 
organometallic intermediates, followed by import, degradation, and metal efflux. 
Phylogenetic profiling shows SOA loci consistently co-occur with Stickland 
fermentation markers but even more consistently with 8Fe-9S cofactor-type 
double-cubane proteins. Hypothesizing that the SAO system forms organometallic 
intermediates, we investigated the known methylmercury formation protein 
families HgcA and HgcB. Both families contained overlooked selenoproteins. Most 
HgcAs have a CU motif N terminal to their previously accepted start sites. 
Seeking additional rare and overlooked selenoproteins may help reveal more 
cryptic aspects of microbial biochemistry. IMPORTANCE This work adds 8 novel 
prokaryotic selenoproteins to the 80 or so families previously known. It 
describes the SAO (selenocysteine-assisted organometallic) locus, with the most 
selenoproteins of any known system. The rare CU motif recurs throughout, 
suggesting the formation and degradation of organometallic compounds. That 
suggestion triggered a reexamination of HgcA and HcgB, which are methylmercury 
formation proteins that can adversely impact food safety. Both are 
selenoproteins, once corrected, with HgcA again showing a CU motif. The SAO 
system is plausibly a mercury resistance locus for selenium-dependent anaerobes. 
But instead, it may exploit heavy metals as cofactors in organometallic 
intermediate-forming pathways that circumvent high activation energies and 
facilitate the breakdown of otherwise poorly accessible nutrients. SAO could 
provide an edge that helps Clostridium difficile, an important pathogen, 
establish disease.

ABSTRACT

The bioinformatics of a nine-gene locus, designated selenocysteine-assisted organometallic (SAO), was investigated after identifying six new selenoprotein families and constructing hidden Markov models (HMMs) that find and annotate members of those families. Four are selenoproteins in most SAO loci, including Clostridium difficile . They include two ABC transporter subunits, namely, permease SaoP, with selenocysteine (U) at the channel-gating position, and substrate-binding subunit SaoB. Cytosolic selenoproteins include SaoL, homologous to MerB organomercurial lyases from mercury resistance loci, and SaoT, related to thioredoxins. SaoL, SaoB, and surface protein SaoC (an occasional selenoprotein) share an unusual CU dipeptide motif, which is something rare in selenoproteins but found in selenoprotein variants of mercury resistance transporter subunit MerT. A nonselenoprotein, SaoE, shares homology with Cu/Zn efflux and arsenical efflux pumps. The organization of the SAO system suggests substrate interaction with surface-exposed selenoproteins, followed by import, metabolism that may cleave a carbon-to-heavy metal bond, and finally metal efflux. A novel type of mercury resistance is possible, but SAO instead may support fermentative metabolism, with selenocysteine-mediated formation of organometallic intermediates, followed by import, degradation, and metal efflux. Phylogenetic profiling shows SOA loci consistently co-occur with Stickland fermentation markers but even more consistently with 8Fe-9S cofactor-type double-cubane proteins. Hypothesizing that the SAO system forms organometallic intermediates, we investigated the known methylmercury formation protein families HgcA and HgcB. Both families contained overlooked selenoproteins. Most HgcAs have a CU motif N terminal to their previously accepted start sites. Seeking additional rare and overlooked selenoproteins may help reveal more cryptic aspects of microbial biochemistry.

IMPORTANCE This work adds 8 novel prokaryotic selenoproteins to the 80 or so families previously known. It describes the SAO (selenocysteine-assisted organometallic) locus, with the most selenoproteins of any known system. The rare CU motif recurs throughout, suggesting the formation and degradation of organometallic compounds. That suggestion triggered a reexamination of HgcA and HcgB, which are methylmercury formation proteins that can adversely impact food safety. Both are selenoproteins, once corrected, with HgcA again showing a CU motif. The SAO system is plausibly a mercury resistance locus for selenium-dependent anaerobes. But instead, it may exploit heavy metals as cofactors in organometallic intermediate-forming pathways that circumvent high activation energies and facilitate the breakdown of otherwise poorly accessible nutrients. SAO could provide an edge that helps Clostridium difficile , an important pathogen, establish disease.

INTRODUCTION

Clostridioides ( Clostridium ) difficile , an important intestinal pathogen, can become prevalent after patients are exposed to certain antibiotics and then can maintain itself in a diarrheal disease-causing dysbiosis for extended periods. Several important principles of the survival of C. difficile as an obligate anaerobe in the intestinal milieu are well described ( 1 â€“ 3 ). Much of its energy generation depends on the extraction of energy substrates refractory to anaerobic oxidation by most other bacteria. C. difficile is a specialist at finding respiratory sinks, and several pathways it contains have been examined in detail. For one, it performs acetogenesis, converting carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), via carbon monoxide (CO), plus hydrogen (H 2 ), to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) through the Wood-Ljundahl pathway (WLP) ( 1 ). From acetyl-CoA, C. difficile does not simply export acetic acid, but instead it performs further transformations, generating both ethanol and butyrate ( 2 ). C. difficile also performs Stickland-type fermentations of a wide variety of amino acids ( 1 , 4 ), coupling some transformations to H+/Na+ transport, which creates gradients that it uses to generate ATP.

Several key proteins used in Stickland reactions invariably occur as selenoproteins. They include glycine reductase subunits GrdA and GrdB, sarcosine reductase subunit GrdF, and proline reductase subunit PrdB. Selenium in the form of selenocysteine is used in C. difficile also in a formate dehydrogenase and the selenophosphate synthase enzyme SelD, which are two of the most widespread selenoproteins in bacteria ( 5 ). In addition to selenocyteine-containing enzymes, C. difficile has the YqeB and YqeC gene pair for preparing the labile selenium-containing molybdenum cofactor (Se-cofactor) for enzymes referred to collectively as selenium-dependent molybdenum hydroxylases (SDMHs) ( 6 , 7 ). Characterized SDMH enzymes of this type include nicotinic acid hydroxylase from Clostridium barkeri ( 8 ), purine hydroxylase from Clostridium purinolyticum ( 9 ), and xanthine dehydrogenase EF2570 from Enterococcus faecalis ( 10 ). The protein CAJ70074.1 from C. difficile is 59% identical to the E. faecalis enzyme and is annotated as functionally equivalent. However, that enzyme is just one of several candidate SDMHs in the proteome, suggesting that several additional selenium-dependent pathways remain to be catalogued in clostridial species.

In light of the broad interest in the metabolic capabilities of C. difficile , in the relationships between microbiome-mediated fermentations in the gut and metabolites appearing in host serum, and in new protein family discoveries that expand the selenoproteome ( 5 , 11 ), we were surprised to find that the species carries a previously overlooked nine protein system extraordinarily rich in selenoproteins and closely associated with double-cubane proteins ( 12 ), which have a highly unusual 8Fe-9S cofactor and which are capable of performing reductions that have a high activation energy. The systemâ€™s overabundance of Cys-rich and Sec-containing motifs; its MerB-related putative organometallic lyase; its putative metal import and export transporters; and its correlations with anaerobic metabolism, Stickland fermentation, and 8Fe-9S cluster proteins suggest something novel. They suggest a system that exists for metabolic throughput and energy generation rather than heavy metal resistance, one that transports metal-containing compounds or ions both inward and outward, that is to say, a selenocysteine-assisted organometallic (SAO) system whose still-undescribed fermentative pathways may involve transient formation and later degradation of organometallic compounds.

Partial phylogenetic profiling results.

A phylogenetic profile was constructed by use of the new NCBIFAMs model NF040734 , which finds members of the SaoC family of CysCys-COOH proteins. The profile included 33 YES genomes, from 3,217 genomes in the PPP genomes, for a probability p of about 0.01. PPP was run with the YES frequency parameter elevated to the manually set value of 0.03. Increasing this parameter, used in binomial distribution computations by PPP, compensates for an intrinsic bias problem in comparative genomics studies from the fact that species from the same lineage share larger numbers of closely related protein pairs, simply because of recent common ancestry.

Partial phylogenetic profiling (PPP) studies were performed on the predicted proteomes of genomes with assembly identifiers GCF_000009205.1 ( Clostridioides difficile ), GCF_000014965 .1 ( Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans ), GCF_000325665.1 ( Brachyspira pilosicoli ), GCF_001754075.1 ( Merdimonas faecis ), and GCF_001940565.1 ( Tissierella creatinophila ). Table S2 in the supplemental materials lists the 40 top-scoring proteins from each of 5 species, showing the PPP score, RefSeq protein accession number, and functional name. All sets of results showed members of the SAO systemâ€™s nine core protein families of this system as the top-scoring proteins, although with gaps occurring for those proteins where previous treatment of selenocysteine-encoding TGA codons as stop codons blocked proper structural annotation. The high scores from PPP reflected not only that these proteins were all universal across species with the system (within the limits of structural annotation accuracy at the time the PPP data set was built) but also that proteins scoring equally well by BLAST are not encoded by genomes lacking the system.

All proteins with PPP scores higher than 50 (that is, with computed odds of such a high rate of co-occurrence just by chance being 1e-50 or less) from any of the 5 genomes belong to the SAO locus. That is, we detected no additional components of the SAO system outside the set of nine protein families described. High scores were achieved for them because all homologs in the PPP reference set were being found in species with the marker SaoC. Example scores in C. difficile include 115.7 for WP_070088344.1 (SaoC itself, hitting 33 YES genomes in the top 33 hits), 107.2 for WP_009897547.1 (SaoB fragment C-terminal to the selenocysteine, with 30 YES genomes out of 30 hit), and 53.3 for WP_004454661.1 (SaoB fragment N-terminal to the selenocysteine, with 16 YES genomes from the top 17 hits).

The next tier, with all scoring below 40, includes proteins such as WP_084191679.1 from Tissierella creatinophila , a glycine reductase complex selenoprotein B (GrdB). The top 148 sequences hit occur in 144 different genomes, including 27 that have the SAO system, for a score of 37.1. Proteins appearing in this tier can include both those with direct connections, as when the end product of one pathway is a substrate for another, and those frequently co-occurring because of sharing biological similarities, such niche and ancestry. GrdB may be correlated because (i) its species distribution, although broad, skews strongly toward the taxonomic class Clostridia ; (ii) it functions only in anaerobic environments, just as the SAO system seems to; and (iii) it shares with the SAO system a requirement for selenium insertion proteins SelA, SelB, and SelD. For similar reasons, proteins associated with selenium-dependent molybdopterin hydroxylases occur in this second tier, including predicted selenium cofactor biosynthesis proteins YqeB and YqeC ( 6 , 7 ).

DISCUSSION

The SAO system described here is exceptional in a number of ways. First, it encodes an unprecedented number of selenoproteins for a single operon, with all lacking obvious sequence homology to each other and four resembling transport or binding proteins rather than redox enzymes. Selenoproteins typically are encoded far apart from each other simply because they are so rare, about one protein per thousand in species that have any at all. The rare known clusterings of selenoproteins to small gene neighborhoods include subunits of some multisubunit enzymes, such as hydrogenases of certain archaeal methanogens, or Stickland metabolism amino acid reductases, but the SAO system surpasses them. Second, alignments to solved crystal structures, as well as structural prediction by AlphaFold2, show that selenocysteine side chains of the newly found selenoproteins would be positioned to contact the substrate. The repetition of the rare CU motif in otherwise unrelated proteins, found in different cellular compartments, suggests sequential interactions with a single chemical moiety that seems highly likely to be a heavy metal atom. Third, SAO occurs across a phylogenetically varied set of anaerobic heterotrophs that carry markers of unusual and biochemically challenging fermentations, namely, Stickland-type fermentations, with its absolute requirement for selenoproteins, and 8Fe-9S-type double-cubane proteins, which remain poorly understood. The SAO system could occur where it does as a further adaptation to the same biochemical niche. Lastly, despite indications of interactions with heavy metals, the SAO operon lacks the association with plasmids or transposons typical of resistance systems for metals, such as for mercury, arsenic, cadmium, or silver. In C. difficile at least, with thousands of isolates sequenced, the SAO operon appears to be part of the core proteome.

The presence in SAO of metal efflux pump SaoE and of the organomercurial lyase homolog SaoL suggests that the system works with mercury or some other heavy metal(s) that can bind carbon covalently and form organometallic compounds. Heavy metals typically are present only at very low levels and are toxic when levels are higher, so resistance systems have evolved to protect cells. The SAO system somewhat resembles resistance systems that translocate heavy metal ions or metal-containing compounds from the periplasm to the cytosol for conversion to a less toxic form and then efflux from the cell. In other ways, it resembles a nutrient utilization system, with an ATP-driven, binding protein-dependent high-affinity uptake system. The combination of the multisubunit ABC transporter with SaoL and SaoE might be understandable if the bacterium regularly encountered extracellular environments with sufficient concentrations of some specific but currently unidentified organometallic nutrient, such that the costs of maintaining a large operon in chromosomal DNA and expressing the nine encoded proteins would be offset by the energy yield. However, some unusual hallmarks of the SAO system led us to suggest that neither picture is an especially good fit.

Mercury resistance systems in Gram-negative bacteria include proteins such as MerT and MerP, which collaborate to clear the toxic Hg(II) ion from the periplasm, where it can damage proteins. They transport it to cytosol, where MerA can convert it to the less toxic, neutral, and easily volatilized Hg(0) atom. But the majority of species with the SAO system have no outer membrane to serve a permeability barrier and limit the levels of exposure. A mercury resistance system that imports a toxic substance from the extracellular milieu, expending ATP in the process, could impose a potentially unlimited energy cost on the cell. Biological systems that integrate the functions of enzymes and transporters tend to exhibit patterns of design that seem, to the examiner, to make good biological sense ( 35 ). Energy-requiring import of a toxic heavy metal atom from outside the permeability barrier of an outer membrane seems a less than optimal design. The heavy reliance on selenocysteine, and the presumable failure of the system when selenocysteine is scarce, seems also to run contrary to sensible design.

An additional challenge to the model of SAO as a resistance system is the design of the ABC transporter. There is only a single permease subunit, SaoP, homodimer-forming with a pair of selenocysteines meeting at the substrate-gating position. However, there are two different substrate-binding proteins, namely, SaoB and SaoX, and in addition the surface protein SaoC, all in support. All four surface-exposed families contain selenoproteins. This design would seem to be unusually complicated for binding and then importing some pre-existing toxic mercurial compound, only to transform it in some way and then expel it from the cell.

Our model integrates aspects of both the resistance and the nutrient uptake and utilization models, with some small additions that, in our opinion, produce a good fit to our observations. Figure 6 shows a sketch of the model. We suggest that the quantities of organometallic compounds in existence at any one time, inside or outside the cell, may be extremely small. Organometallic compounds that reach the cytosol likely are transformed and degraded rapidly, with efflux of the metal(s), so potential toxicity is minimized. Upon efflux, the metal ion is bound, carried to the ABC transporter, and joined covalently with some fermentable organic substrate in a formation process that is likely tied to its import. The combination of two different substrate-binding-like proteins, namely, SaoB and SaoX, paired with a single permease suggests an initially separate binding of two different entities and then a combination into a single organometallic (likely organomercurial) compound. Stable organometallic compounds are relatively few, but our model suggests a need only for relatively short-term stability, as that compound would count as an intermediate in a pathway. The biological justification for having such a system would be that covalent attachment of a heavy metal atom, such as Hg, to some fermentable organic substrate could achieve what ligation of coenzyme A achieves in, say, fatty acid metabolism. It could act as a cofactor in a pathway, which would be added covalently but later recovered. While bound, it might give enzymes a means to achieve high specificity or face lower activation energies for performing chemically difficult reactions. Capture and reuse of the heavy metal atom after its efflux would establish a cycle, allowing even barely detectable amounts of a trace element to have a large metabolic impact. Meanwhile, the cytosolic components of the system, including SaoT, SaoD, and SaoL, would protect the cell from the metal while it resides in the cell, conducting it toward SaoE for efflux. In this way, the SAO system would integrate the basic functions of a resistance system with that of a cofactor-dependent nutrient uptake and utilization system.

Our model does rely heavily on the notion that metal-binding activity is indicated by the repeated presence of selenocysteines, coming close to each other in the SaoP dimer interface or located in CU motifs homologous to CC motifs seen in nonselenoprotein homologs. This notion is now discussed further.

After this article was first submitted, a comprehensive review by Zhang et al. ( 36 ) of selenoproteins known or predicted in prokaryotes became available. It listed one representative protein each for 78 different families, allowing us to expand the coverage of RefSeq to some families we previously did not cover, explore the membership of each family, get a sense of taxonomic distributions and gene neighborhoods, align proteins for each family, and categorize the selenocysteine-containing motifs. More than half of the protein families catalogued by Zhang et al. ( 36 ) exhibit motifs such as CxxU or UxxC that align to CxxC motifs in thioredoxin-fold domains of nonselenoproteins. For 25 more families, we saw that no Cys is found within 3 residues on either side of the Sec residue (xxxUxxx motif). Relatively few families had motifs with Sec either next to Cys or no more than one residue away, but examples included CU and UC in two forms of CopZ family copper chaperone, CU in mercury resistance protein MerT, and UxC in a Cu/Zn efflux transporter. We confirmed that the CU motif was rare. The entire list of protein families with the rare CU motif is SaoL, SaoB, SaoX, SaoC, HgcA, MerT, one form of the copper chaperone CopZ, and three uncharacterized proteins.

The most recent and comprehensive review of prokaryotic selenoproteins predicts that the majority of uncharacterized selenoproteins serve redox functions ( 36 ). That generalization, while useful, seems most accurate for selenoproteins with thioredoxin-like CxxU and UxxC motifs. SitesBLAST ( 37 ) ( https://papers.genomics.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/sites.cgi ) is a newly available tool that allows any protein to be searched by BLAST against a large database of functional sites in proteins, taken from Swiss-Prot curation or computed from solved crystal structures of proteins bound to substrates or cofactors. It allows us to probe what other significance a given Sec residue might have. While Sec residues are understood broadly to be critical for function in the proteins in which they occur and are frequently discussed explicitly as active site residues, we note that contact with heavy metal atoms also can be a feature of Cys residues in crystal structures that align to Sec residues in bioinformatically identified selenoproteins. Examples seen easily by using SitesBLAST include Mo(VI) for formate dehydrogenase-N subunit alpha ( WP_010904702.1 ) and formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase subunit B ( WP_011019895.1 ), both with xxxUxxx motifs, Fe(III) for both CxU-containing motifs in the double-selenoprotein WP_256875638.1 , and arsenic for the CXU motif of arsenite methyltransferase ArsM ( WP_011987699.1 ), as well as Hg for MerB residues aligning to the CU motif SaoL, which was discussed earlier. The few cases of selenoproteins homologous to known transporter subunits are most closely related to known metal transporters. For selenoproteins generally, a Sec residue may be critical to catalysis, but it may bind directly to an atom of iron, molybdenum, tungsten, arsenic, or mercury. Selenoprotein P in the rat has 10 Sec residues, with some in UxU motifs, and has a reported ability to bind, sequester, and help remove methylmercury from experimentally poisoned animals. The selenoproteins of family TIGR04081 are not enzymes but target peptides for posttranslational modification by the radical SAM enzyme SbtM and precursors of thio(seleno)oxazole-containing RiPP natural products ( 38 , 39 ). We conclude that an uncharacterized selenoprotein, especially one without a thioredoxin-like motif, might be a transporter subunit, a chaperone, a carrier protein for heavy metals, or something else, rather than an enzyme or a thioredoxin-like redox protein. It is well known that there is an extraordinarily high binding affinity between selenium and mercury ( 40 ). Any given selenocysteine residue in an uncharacterized protein might be understood better as a ligand to a substrate or a cofactor than as an active site residue per se.
