Sigma factor σ(54) has a distinct modus operandi for mediating the activation of 
bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) at promoter recognition motifs 12 and 24 bp 
upstream from transcription start sites. σ(54) was thought to act as monomer in 
all transcription steps. However, we provide evidence that σ(54) of Pseudomonas 
putida interacts stably with itself. The interface between monomers involves 
contacts in σ(54) regions I and III, sequences that play key roles in the 
transcription activation of σ(54)-RNAP holoenzyme. These roles include 
interactions with activator proteins and the -12 and -24 motifs. In particular, 
we detected inter-monomer contacts between region I, and between region I and 
the C-terminal portion of region III. Our results suggest a new 
auto-antagonistic regulatory state of σ(54).
