Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are synthesized on 
membrane-bound ribosomes, translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum 
membrane, and GPI-anchored by GPI transamidase (GPIT). GPIT is a minimally 
heterotetrameric membrane protein complex composed of Gaa1, Gpi8, PIG-S and 
PIG-T. We describe structure-function analyses of Gaa1, the most hydrophobic of 
the GPIT subunits, with the aim of assigning a functional role to the different 
sequence domains of the protein. We generated epitope-tagged Gaa1 mutants and 
analyzed their membrane topology, subcellular distribution, complex-forming 
capability, and ability to restore GPIT activity in Gaa1-deficient cells. We 
show that (i) detergent-extracted, Gaa1-containing GPIT complexes sediment 
unexpectedly rapidly at approximately 17 S, (ii) Gaa1 is an endoplasmic 
reticulum-localized membrane glycoprotein with a cytoplasmically oriented N 
terminus and a lumenally oriented C terminus, (iii) elimination of C-terminal 
transmembrane segments allows Gaa1 to interact with other GPIT subunits but 
renders the resulting GPIT complex nonfunctional, (iv) interaction between Gaa1 
and other GPIT subunits occurs via the large lumenal domain of Gaa1 located 
between the first and second transmembrane segments, and (v) the cytoplasmic N 
terminus of Gaa1 is not required for formation of a functional GPIT complex but 
may act as a membrane-sorting determinant directing Gaa1 and associated GPIT 
subunits to an endoplasmic reticulum membrane domain.
