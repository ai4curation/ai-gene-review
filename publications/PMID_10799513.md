We provide evidence here that b(0,+) amino acid transporter (b(0, +)AT) 
interacts with 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc) as well as with the protein related to 
b(0,+) amino acid transporter (rBAT) to constitute functionally competent 
b(0,+)-like amino acid transport systems. This evidence has been obtained by 
co-expression of b(0, +)AT and 4F2hc or b(0,+)AT and rBAT in human retinal 
pigment epithelial cells and in COS-1 cells. The ability to interact with 4F2hc 
and rBAT is demonstrable with mouse b(0,+)AT as well as with human b(0,+)AT. 
Even though both the 4F2hc x b(0,+)AT complex and the rBAT x b(0,+)AT complex 
exhibit substrate specificity that is characteristic of system b(0,+), these two 
complexes differ significantly in substrate affinity. The 4F2hc x b(0,+)AT 
complex has higher substrate affinity than the rBAT x b(0,+)AT complex. In situ 
hybridization studies demonstrate that the regional distribution pattern of mRNA 
in the kidney is identical for b(0,+)AT and 4F2hc. The pattern of rBAT mRNA 
expression is different from that of b(0,+)AT mRNA and 4F2hc mRNA, but there are 
regions in the kidney where b(0,+)AT mRNA expression overlaps with rBAT mRNA 
expression as well as with 4F2hc mRNA expression.
