The multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) is deposited on mRNAs upstream of 
exon-exon junctions as a consequence of pre-mRNA splicing. In mammalian cells, 
this complex serves as a key modulator of spliced mRNA metabolism. To date, 
neither the complete composition nor the exact assembly pathway of the EJC has 
been entirely elucidated. Using in vitro splicing and a two-step chromatography 
procedure, we have purified the EJC and analyzed its components by mass 
spectrometry. In addition to finding most of the known EJC factors, we 
identified two novel EJC components, Acinus and SAP18. Heterokaryon analysis 
revealed that SAP18 is a shuttling protein whereas Acinus is restricted to the 
nucleus. In MS2 tethering assays Acinus stimulated gene expression at the RNA 
level, while MLN51, another EJC factor, stimulated mRNA translational 
efficiency. Using tandem affinity purification (TAP) of proteins overexpressed 
in HeLa cells, we demonstrated that Acinus binds directly to another EJC 
component, RNPS1, while stable association of SAP18 to form the trimeric 
apoptosis and splicing associated protein (ASAP) complex requires both Acinus 
and RNPS1. Using the same methodology, we further identified what appears to be 
the minimal stable EJC core, a heterotetrameric complex consisting of eIF4AIII, 
Magoh, Y14, and MLN51.
