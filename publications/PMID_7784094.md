We have examined the interaction between the DNA replication and repair protein 
PCNA, and the growth arrest and DNA damage induced protein Gadd45. An 
anti-Gadd45 polyclonal antibody co-immunoprecipitates PCNA but in reciprocal 
experiments, an anti-C terminal anti-PCNA antibody failed to 
co-immunoprecipitate Gadd45. We used a yeast two hybrid assay to demonstrate 
that human Gadd45 interacts with both human and S. pombe PCNA. We have 
determined that the N-terminal 94 amino acids of Gadd45 bind to PCNA, and using 
a series of N-terminal and C-terminal deletions of human PCNA we have mapped two 
potential Gadd45 binding sites. Deletion of the last 6 amino acids of PCNA 
ablated interaction, suggesting a role in Gadd45 binding. This explains the 
inability of an anti-C terminal PCNA antibody to co-immunoprecipitate Gadd45. 
Using a peptide ELISA approach, we showed that Gadd45 protein binds strongly to 
three regions of PCNA (residues 1-20, 61-80, and 196-215) and weakly to residues 
121-170. The crystal structure of PCNA provides insight into our genetic and 
immunochemical data. Our results confirm an interaction between PCNA and Gadd45, 
define regions of both molecules involved in this interaction, and are 
consistent with a potential stoichiometry of 2 Gadd45 molecules to each PCNA 
monomer. These data provide support for the notion that PCNA-Gadd45 interactions 
co-ordinate cell cycle and DNA repair.
