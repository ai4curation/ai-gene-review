DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) plays an important role in the inheritance of 
genomic DNA methylation, which is coupled to the DNA replication process. Early 
embryonic lethality in DNMT1-null mutant (Dnmt1(c)) mice indicates that DNA 
methylation is essential for mammalian development. DNMT1, however, interacts 
with a number of transcriptional regulators and has a transcriptional repressor 
activity independent of its catalytic activity. To examine the roles of the 
catalytic activity of DNMT1 in vivo, we generated a Dnmt1(ps) allele that 
expresses a point-mutated protein that lacks catalytic activity (DNMT1-C1229S). 
Dnmt1(ps) mutant mice showed developmental arrest shortly after gastrulation, 
near-complete loss of DNA methylation, and an altered distribution of repressive 
chromatin markers in the nuclei; these phenotypes are quite similar to those of 
the Dnmt1(c) mutant. The mutant DNMT1 protein failed to associate with 
replication foci in Dnmt1(ps) cells. Reconstitution experiments and replication 
labeling in Dnmt1-/- Dnmt3a-/- Dnmt3b-/- (i.e., unmethylated) embryonic stem 
cells revealed that preexisting DNA methylation is a major determinant for the 
cell cycle-dependent localization of DNMT1. The C-terminal catalytic domain of 
DNMT1 inhibited its stable association with unmethylated chromatin. Our results 
reveal essential roles for the DNA methylation mark in mammalian development and 
in DNMT1 localization.
