A key feature of the process of programmed cell death (apoptosis) is the 
efficiency with which the dying cells are recognized and engulfed by phagocytes 
[1]. Apoptotic cells are rapidly cleared either by neighbouring cells acting as 
semi-professional phagocytes or by experts of the macrophage line, so that an 
inflammatory response is avoided [2]. The Caenorhabditis elegans gene ced-6 is 
required for efficient engulfment of apoptotic cells [3] and is one of a group 
of genes that define two partially redundant parallel pathways for the 
engulfment process [4] [5]. These pathways may be conserved across evolution, as 
two other engulfment genes have human homologues. A CED-5 homologue is part of a 
human CrkII-DOCK180-Rac signaling pathway proposed to mediate cytoskeletal 
reorganization [6] [7] [8] and a CED-7 homologue is similar to the ABC 
transporters [9] [10]. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of human 
CED-6, a human homologue of C. elegans CED-6. The 34 kDa hCED-6 protein is 
expressed in most tissues, some human cancer cells, and in primary human 
macrophages. We developed an assay that quantitates the phagocytic activity of 
mammalian macrophages: the number of apoptotic cells that have been internalized 
is measured by the uptake of lacZ-positive apoptotic cells by adherent 
transgenic macrophages. The results of this assay demonstrate that 
overexpression of hCED-6 promotes phagocytosis only of apoptotic cells and 
suggest that hCED-6 is the mammalian orthologue of C. elegans CED-6 and is a 
part of a highly conserved pathway that specifically mediates the phagocytosis 
of apoptotic cells.
