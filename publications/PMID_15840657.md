The mammalian (Na(+),K(+))/H(+) exchanger NHE7 resides chiefly in the 
trans-Golgi network (TGN) and post-Golgi vesicles where it is thought to 
contribute to organellar pH homeostasis. However, the mechanisms that underlie 
the targeting and regulation of NHE7 are unknown. To gain insight into these 
processes, yeast two-hybrid methodology was used to screen a human brain cDNA 
library for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic C-terminus of NHE7. One 
binding partner we identified was SCAMP2, a member of the secretory carrier 
membrane protein (SCAMP) gene family. Direct association of these two proteins 
was further supported by co-immunolocalization and co-immunoprecipitation 
analyses using transfected cells, by their co-sedimentation in membrane 
fractions resolved on sucrose density gradients, and by in vitro protein binding 
assays. Other members of the SCAMP family, such as SCAMP1 and SCAMP5, also 
associated with NHE7. The majority of the NHE7-SCAMP complexes accumulated at 
the TGN, but a minor fraction also resided in recycling vesicles. Biochemical 
analyses indicated that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of NHE7 bound 
preferentially to a highly conserved cytoplasmic loop between the second and the 
third transmembrane segments (TM2-TM3 loop) of SCAMP2. A deletion mutant of 
SCAMP2 lacking this region (SCAMP2/Delta184-208) bound weakly to NHE7, but 
caused a significant fraction of NHE7 and wild-type SCAMP2 to redistribute to a 
pool of scattered recycling vesicles without noticeably affecting the location 
of other resident TGN (syntaxin 6) or Golgi cisternae (GM130) proteins. 
Conversely, a GFP-tagged TM2-TM3 construct of SCAMP2 interacted with NHE7, but 
also led to the redistribution of NHE7 to dispersed vesicular structures. We 
propose a model wherein SCAMPs participate in the shuttling of NHE7 between 
recycling vesicles and the TGN.
