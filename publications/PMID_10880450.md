Chromatin remodelling complexes containing the nucleosome-dependent ATPase ISWI 
were first isolated from Drosophila embryos (NURF, CHRAC and ACF). ISWI was the 
only common component reported in these complexes. Our purification of human 
CHRAC (HuCHRAC) shows that ISWI chromatin remodelling complexes can have a 
conserved subunit composition in completely different cell types, suggesting a 
conserved function of ISWI. We show that the human homologues of two novel 
putative histone-fold proteins in Drosophila CHRAC are present in HuCHRAC. The 
two human histone-fold proteins form a stable complex that binds naked DNA but 
not nucleosomes. HuCHRAC also contains human ACF1 (hACF1), the homologue of 
Acf1, a subunit of Drosophila ACF. The N-terminus of mouse ACF1 was reported as 
a heterochromatin-targeting domain. hACF1 is a member of a family of proteins 
with a related domain structure that all may target heterochromatin. We discuss 
a possible function for HuCHRAC in heterochromatin dynamics. HuCHRAC does not 
contain topoisomerase II, which was reported earlier as a subunit of Drosophila 
CHRAC.

Abstract

Chromatin remodelling complexes containing the nucleosome-dependent ATPase ISWI were first isolated from Drosophila embryos (NURF, CHRAC and ACF). ISWI was the only common component reported in these complexes. Our purification of human CHRAC (HuCHRAC) shows that ISWI chromatin remodelling complexes can have a conserved subunit composition in completely different cell types, suggesting a conserved function of ISWI. We show that the human homologues of two novel putative histone-fold proteins in Drosophila CHRAC are present in HuCHRAC. The two human histone-fold proteins form a stable complex that binds naked DNA but not nucleosomes. HuCHRAC also contains human ACF1 (hACF1), the homologue of Acf1, a subunit of Drosophila ACF. The N-terminus of mouse ACF1 was reported as a heterochromatin-targeting domain. hACF1 is a member of a family of proteins with a related domain structure that all may target heterochromatin. We discuss a possible function for HuCHRAC in heterochromatin dynamics. HuCHRAC does not contain topoisomerase II, which was reported earlier as a subunit of Drosophila CHRAC.

Introduction

Recent discoveries have highlighted the interrelationship of the packaging of the eukaryotic genome in chromatin and regulated processes such as transcription. Alterations in chromatin structure are often a prerequisite for transcriptional regulation. The nucleosome, the basic subunit of chromatin, is a major target for such alterations. Various enzymes change the nucleosome structure and mediate transcriptional regulation via ‘chromatin remodelling’. These enzymes include histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases, histone kinases and ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelling factors (reviewed in Workman and Kingston, 1998 ; Kingston and Narlikar, 1999 ). ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelling factors function as complexes, ranging from heterodimers to complexes of 12 or more subunits. Central to their function are ATPases with a conserved domain structure. Some of these ATPases are similar to the yeast SWI2/SNF2 ATPase, others are of the CHD type or of the ISWI-type ( Kingston and Narlikar, 1999 ).

Three different chromatin remodelling complexes, isolated from Drosophila embryos, contain the ISWI ATPase: (i) nucleosome remodelling factor (NURF; Tsukiyama and Wu, 1995 ); (ii) ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodelling factor (ACF; Ito et al., 1997 ); and (iii) chromatin accessibility complex (CHRAC; Varga-Weisz et al., 1997 ). Apart from the shared ISWI, no common subunits were reported for these complexes. Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two highly similar genes with homology to Drosophila ISWI. Nevertheless, their gene products form functionally and biochemically different complexes ( Tsukiyama et al., 1999 ). In human, two very similar ISWI homologues, hSNF2L ( Okabe et al., 1992 ) and hSNF2H ( Aihara et al., 1998 ), have been described. A heterodimeric complex termed RSF (remodelling and spacing factor) containing hSNF2H recently was purified from HeLa cell nuclear pellet ( LeRoy et al., 1998 ). The other subunit of RSF is a novel 325 kDa protein. RSF facilitates regular spacing between nucleosomes and allows transcription initiation from a nucleosomal promoter.

The finding of three different ISWI-containing complexes in Drosophila early embryos raises the question of whether they represent a limited number of functional units with an evolutionarily conserved subunit composition, or whether they are just a small sample of a much larger number of complexes that form as a result of promiscuous interaction with ISWI. The necessity for rapid replication-associated chromatin assembly in Drosophila embryos may influence the abundance and composition of ISWI-containing chromatin remodelling factors as compared with, for example, much slower dividing HeLa cells. The subunit composition and biochemistry of ISWI complexes in cells other than those from Drosophila embryos may provide clues about the in vivo function of ISWI.

Here we report the characterization of a human ISWI-containing complex, human CHRAC (HuCHRAC), purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. HuCHRAC contains subunits that are conserved in Drosophila ISWI complexes: hACF1, the human homologue of Drosophila Acf1, a subunit of ACF, and the human counterparts of two novel histone-fold proteins that are part of Drosophila CHRAC. This demonstrates conservation of ISWI complexes between Drosophila embryo cells and human cells, despite their physiological differences, and indicates a conserved function for ISWI. The N-terminal part of mouse ACF1 recently was shown to target pericentric heterochromatin upon cell differentiation ( Tate et al., 1998 ), and we discuss potential implications of this finding concerning the function of HuCHRAC.
