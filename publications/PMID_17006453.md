The movement of anionic porphyrins (for example, haem) across intracellular 
membranes is crucial to many biological processes, but their mitochondrial 
translocation and coordination with haem biosynthesis is not understood. 
Transport of porphyrins into isolated mitochondria is energy-dependent, as 
expected for the movement of anions into a negatively charged environment. 
ATP-binding cassette transporters actively facilitate the transmembrane movement 
of substances. We found that the mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette transporter 
ABCB6 is upregulated (messenger RNA and protein in human and mouse cells) by 
elevation of cellular porphyrins and postulated that ABCB6 has a function in 
porphyrin transport. We also predicted that ABCB6 is functionally linked to haem 
biosynthesis, because its mRNA is found in both human bone marrow and CD71+ 
early erythroid cells (by database searching), and because our results show that 
ABCB6 is highly expressed in human fetal liver, and Abcb6 in mouse embryonic 
liver. Here we demonstrate that ABCB6 is uniquely located in the outer 
mitochondrial membrane and is required for mitochondrial porphyrin uptake. After 
ABCB6 is upregulated in response to increased intracellular porphyrin, 
mitochondrial porphyrin uptake activates de novo porphyrin biosynthesis. This 
process is blocked when the Abcb6 gene is silenced. Our results challenge 
previous assumptions about the intracellular movement of porphyrins and the 
factors controlling haem biosynthesis.
