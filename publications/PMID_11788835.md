Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a dominant genetic disorder characterized by 
multiple benign and malignant nervous system tumors, and by learning defects in 
45% of children with NF1 mutations. Studies of neurofibromin, the protein 
encoded by NF1, have focused on its functions in tumorigenesis and regulation of 
Ras activity; however, Drosophila NF1 regulates both Ras and cyclic AMP (cAMP) 
pathways. Expression of a human NF1 transgene rescued cAMP-related phenotypes in 
NF1 mutant flies (small body size and G protein-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC) 
activity defects), and neuropeptide- and G protein-stimulated AC activity were 
lower in Nf1-/- as compared to Nf1+/- mouse brains, demonstrating that 
neurofibromin regulates AC activity in both mammals and flies.
