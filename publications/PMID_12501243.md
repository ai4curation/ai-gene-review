Lymphocyte stimulation by immunoreceptors is achieved through the activation of 
multiple signaling pathways leading to cytokine gene transcription. Adapter 
proteins are critical signaling components that can integrate multiple pathways 
by allowing the assembly of multimolecular signaling complexes. We previously 
showed that the cytoplasmic adapter 3BP2 (also known as SH3BP2) promotes 
NFAT/AP-1 transcriptional activities in T cells through the activation of Ras- 
and calcineurin-dependent pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms by which 
3BP2/SH3BP2 regulates cell signaling and activation remain poorly documented. In 
this study, using a combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis and biochemical 
approaches, we present evidence for a physical interaction between 3BP2 and the 
chaperone protein 14-3-3. This interaction was direct and constitutively 
detected in yeast and in mammalian cells. Phorbol ester, pervanadate, and 
forskolin/isobutylmethylxanthine stimulations enhanced this interaction, as well 
as co-expression of constitutive active mutants of serine/threonine kinases, 
including protein kinase C. We found that dephosphorylation of 3BP2 by alkaline 
phosphatase disrupted its interaction with 14-3-3 and that 3BP2 was a substrate 
of purified protein kinase C in vitro, suggesting that the phosphorylation of 
3BP2 by upstream kinases was required for 14-3-3 binding. Using deletion mutants 
of 3BP2, two 14-3-3 binding domains were mapped to two proline-rich (residues 
201-240 and 270-310) domains of 3BP2. These domains were shown to contain two 
14-3-3 consensus binding motifs. We identified residues Ser(225) and Ser(277) of 
3BP2 as being essential for interaction with 14-3-3 family proteins, optimal 
3BP2 serine phosphorylation, and then for 3BP2-dependent function. Indeed, a 
3BP2 mutant protein incapable of binding 14-3-3 showed increased capacity to 
stimulate NFAT transcriptional activities, suggesting that 14-3-3 binding to 
3BP2 negatively regulates 3BP2 adapter function in lymphocytes.
