Loss of mitotic checkpoint contributes to chromosomal instability, leading to 
carcinogenesis. In this study, we identified a novel splicing variant of mitotic 
arrest deficient 1 (MAD1), designated MAD1beta, and investigated its role in 
mitotic checkpoint control in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression 
levels of human MAD1beta were examined in hepatoma cell lines and human HCC 
samples. The functional roles of MAD1beta in relation to the mitotic checkpoint 
control, chromosomal instability, and binding with MAD2 were assessed in 
hepatoma cell lines. On sequencing, MAD1beta was found to have deletion of exon 
4. It was expressed at both mRNA and protein levels in the nine hepatoma cell 
lines tested and was overexpressed in 12 of 50 (24%) human HCCs. MAD1beta 
localized in the cytoplasm, whereas MAD1alpha was found in the nucleus. This 
cytoplasmic localization of MAD1beta was due to the absence of a nuclear 
localization signal in MAD1alpha. In addition, MAD1beta was found to physically 
interact with MAD2 and sequester it in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, expression of 
MAD1beta induced mitotic checkpoint impairment, chromosome bridge formation, and 
aberrant chromosome numbers via binding with MAD2. Our data suggest that the 
novel splicing variant MAD1beta may have functions different from those of 
MAD1alpha and may play opposing roles to MAD1alpha in mitotic checkpoint control 
in hepatocarcinogenesis.
