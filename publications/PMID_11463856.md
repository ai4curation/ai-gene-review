A combination of in vivo and in vitro assays was employed to describe the 
ligand-independent interaction of the orphan nuclear receptor TR2 and histone 
deacetylase proteins. The repressive effect of TR2 on transcription of a 
luciferase reporter driven by a promoter containing a direct repeat-5 (DR5) 
derived from the human RARbeta gene was suppressed by the addition of the 
histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. Immunoprecipitation with 
FLAG-epitope (MDYKDDDDK)-tagged histone deacetylase proteins was used to 
demonstrate that TR2 and histone deacetylases 3 or 4 are present in the same 
immunoprecipitated complex. Deacetylase activity was demonstrated for these 
coimmunoprecipitates, further confirming the in vivo interaction of TR2 and 
histone deacetylases. Immunoprecipitation with anti-TR2 antibody was used to 
demonstrate interaction of TR2 with endogenously expressed histone deacetylases 
3 and 4 in COS-1 cells. Dissection of TR2 domains showed that the DNA binding 
domain of the receptor was responsible for interaction with both histone 
deacetylases 3 and 4 in glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays, while the 
ligand binding domain did not interact. The pull-down data were confirmed with 
far Western blots that also showed a direct interaction between labeled histone 
deacetylase proteins and TR2. It is suggested that repression mediated by 
unliganded TR2 is mediated, in part, by a direct interaction of this receptor 
with histone deacetylase proteins.
