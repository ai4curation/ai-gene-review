Tapasin organizes the peptide-loading complex (PLC) by recruiting 
peptide-receptive MHC class I (MHC-I) and accessory chaperones to the N-terminal 
regions of the TAP subunits TAP1 and TAP2. Despite numerous studies have shown 
that the formation of the PLC is essential to facilitate proper MHC-I loading, 
the molecular architecture of this complex is still highly controversial. We 
studied the stoichiometry of the PLC by blue native-PAGE in combination with 
Ab-shift assays and found that TAP/tapasin complexes exist at steady state as a 
mixture of two distinct oligomers of 350 and 450 kDa. Only the higher m.w. 
complex contains MHC-I and disulfide-linked tapasin/ER60 conjugates. Moreover, 
we show for the first time to our knowledge that the fully assembled PLC 
comprises two tapasin, two ER60, but only one complex of MHC-I and calreticulin. 
Based hereon we postulate that the TAP subunits alternate in the recruitment and 
loading of a single MHC-I.
