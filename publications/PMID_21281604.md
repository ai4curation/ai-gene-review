The insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and the target of rapamycin (TOR) 
signaling pathways are known to regulate lifespan in diverse organisms. However, 
only a limited number of genes involved in these pathways have been examined 
regarding their effects on lifespan. Through a gain-of-function screen in 
Drosophila, we found that overexpression of the wdb gene encoding a regulatory 
subunit of PP2A, and overexpression of the lkb1 gene encoding a serine/threonine 
kinase, reduced organ size and extended lifespan. Overexpression of wdb also 
reduced the level of phosphorylated AKT, while overexpression of lkb1 increased 
the level of phosphorylated AMPK and decreased the level of phosphorylated S6K. 
Taken together, our results suggest that wdb- and lkb1-dependent lifespan 
extension is mediated by downregulation of S6K, a downstream component of the 
insulin/IGF and TOR signaling pathways.
