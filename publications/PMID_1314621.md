We isolated two cDNAs that encode isoforms of agrin, the basal lamina protein 
that mediates the motor neuron-induced aggregation of acetylcholine receptors on 
muscle fibers at the neuromuscular junction. Both proteins are the result of 
alternative splicing of the product of the agrin gene, but unlike agrin, they 
are inactive in standard acetylcholine receptor aggregation assays. They lack 
one (agrin-related protein 1) or two (agrin-related protein 2) regions in agrin 
that are required for its activity. Expression studies provide evidence that 
both proteins are present in the nervous system and muscle and that, in muscle, 
myofibers and Schwann cells synthesize the agrin-related proteins while the axon 
terminals of motor neurons are the sole source of agrin.
