Through the induction of apoptosis, CD95 plays a crucial role in the immune 
response and the elimination of cancer cells. Ligation of CD95 receptor 
activates a complex signaling network that appears to implicate the generation 
of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study investigated the place of ROS 
production in CD95-mediated apoptosis and the role of the antioxidant enzyme 
glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1). Anti-CD95 antibodies triggered an early 
generation of ROS in human breast cancer T47D cells that was blocked by 
overexpression of GPx1 and inhibition of initiator caspase activation. Enforced 
expression of GPx1 also resulted in inhibition of CD95-induced effector caspase 
activation, DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic cell death. Resistance to 
CD95-mediated apoptosis was not due to an increased expression of anti-apoptotic 
molecules and could be reversed by glutathione-depleting agents. In addition, 
whereas the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL prevented CD95-induced apoptosis in 
MCF-7 cells, it did not inhibit the early ROS production. Moreover, Bcl-xL but 
not GPx1 overexpression could suppress the staurosporine-induced late generation 
of ROS and subsequent cell death. Altogether, these findings suggest that GPx1 
functions upstream of the mitochondrial events to inhibit the early ROS 
production and apoptosis induced by CD95 ligation. Finally, transgenic mice 
overexpressing GPx1 were partially protected from the lethal effect of 
anti-CD95, underlying the importance of peroxide formation (and GPx1) in 
CD95-triggered apoptosis.
