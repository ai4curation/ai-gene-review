The characterization of all protein complexes of human cells under defined 
physiological conditions using affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) 
is a highly desirable step in the quest to understand the phenotypic effects of 
genomic information. However, such a challenging goal has not yet been achieved, 
as it requires reproducibility of the experimental workflow and high data 
consistency across different studies and laboratories. We systematically 
investigated the reproducibility of a standardized AP-MS workflow by performing 
a rigorous interlaboratory comparative analysis of the interactomes of 32 human 
kinases. We show that it is possible to achieve high interlaboratory 
reproducibility of this standardized workflow despite differences in mass 
spectrometry configurations and subtle sample preparation-related variations and 
that combination of independent data sets improves the approach sensitivity, 
resulting in even more-detailed networks. Our analysis demonstrates the 
feasibility of obtaining a high-quality map of the human protein interactome 
with a multilaboratory project.
