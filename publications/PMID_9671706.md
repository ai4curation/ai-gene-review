The Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) binds to the tail of the 
beta2-adrenergic receptor and plays a role in adrenergic regulation of Na+/H+ 
exchange. NHERF contains two PDZ domains, the first of which is required for its 
interaction with the beta2 receptor. Mutagenesis studies of the beta2 receptor 
tail revealed that the optimal C-terminal motif for binding to the first PDZ 
domain of NHERF is D-S/T-x-L, a motif distinct from those recognized by other 
PDZ domains. The first PDZ domain of NHERF-2, a protein that is 52% identical to 
NHERF and also known as E3KARP, SIP-1, and TKA-1, exhibits binding preferences 
very similar to those of the first PDZ domain of NHERF. The delineation of the 
preferred binding motif for the first PDZ domain of the NHERF family of proteins 
allows for predictions for other proteins that may interact with NHERF or 
NHERF-2. For example, as would be predicted from the beta2 receptor tail 
mutagenesis studies, NHERF binds to the tail of the purinergic P2Y1 receptor, a 
seven-transmembrane receptor with an intracellular C-terminal tail ending in 
D-T-S-L. NHERF also binds to the tail of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator, which ends in D-T-R-L. Because the preferred binding 
motif of the first PDZ domain of the NHERF family of proteins is found at the C 
termini of a variety of intracellular proteins, NHERF and NHERF-2 may be 
multifunctional adaptor proteins involved in many previously unsuspected aspects 
of intracellular signaling.

Abstract

The Na + /H + exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) binds to the tail of the β 2 -adrenergic receptor and plays a role in adrenergic regulation of Na + /H + exchange. NHERF contains two PDZ domains, the first of which is required for its interaction with the β 2 receptor. Mutagenesis studies of the β 2 receptor tail revealed that the optimal C-terminal motif for binding to the first PDZ domain of NHERF is D-S/T-x-L, a motif distinct from those recognized by other PDZ domains. The first PDZ domain of NHERF-2, a protein that is 52% identical to NHERF and also known as E3KARP, SIP-1, and TKA-1, exhibits binding preferences very similar to those of the first PDZ domain of NHERF. The delineation of the preferred binding motif for the first PDZ domain of the NHERF family of proteins allows for predictions for other proteins that may interact with NHERF or NHERF-2. For example, as would be predicted from the β 2 receptor tail mutagenesis studies, NHERF binds to the tail of the purinergic P2Y1 receptor, a seven-transmembrane receptor with an intracellular C-terminal tail ending in D-T-S-L. NHERF also binds to the tail of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which ends in D-T-R-L. Because the preferred binding motif of the first PDZ domain of the NHERF family of proteins is found at the C termini of a variety of intracellular proteins, NHERF and NHERF-2 may be multifunctional adaptor proteins involved in many previously unsuspected aspects of intracellular signaling.

RESULTS

The binding preferences of the first PDZ domain of NHERF were determined via mutagenesis of the β 2 receptor tail, the last four amino acids of which are D-S-L-L. Previous work demonstrated that mutation of the terminal leucine of the β 2 receptor tail to alanine completely abolishes binding of NHERF ( 10 ). Mutation of this position to six other amino acids (Fig. 1 A ) revealed that the wild-type leucine is strongly preferred. Even amino acids with similar side chains such as isoleucine and valine yield more than fivefold reductions in NHERF binding when they are substituted for leucine at the end of the β 2 receptor tail.

Previous studies revealed that mutation to alanine at the −2 or −3 positions of the β 2 receptor tail significantly inhibits NHERF binding but that mutation to alanine at the −1 position has no effect ( 10 ). Further mutations at the −1, −2, and −3 positions (Fig. 1 B ) revealed that aspartate is markedly better than any other amino acid examined at the −3 position but that threonine is slightly better than serine at the −2 position. There is a slight preference at the −1 position for basic residues over neutral or acidic residues (arginine is better than leucine, and leucine is better than glutamate), but the difference is less than a twofold change in NHERF binding either way compared with the wild-type β 2 receptor tail. Mutation to aspartate at the −2 position results in a complete loss of NHERF binding, suggesting that phosphorylation of this site in vivo is likely to inhibit the binding of NHERF to the β 2 receptor. Interestingly, this serine (Ser411) is a substrate for phosphorylation by the G protein-coupled receptor kinase GRK5 ( 14 ). The effects of point mutations at each of the final four positions of the β 2 receptor tail are summarized in Fig. 1 C .

Using primers based on GenBank accession no. Z50150 , a close relative of NHERF was cloned from a human lung cDNA library. This species will be referred to here as “NHERF-2.” The two PDZ domains of NHERF-2, like the two PDZ domains of NHERF, exhibit ≈60% identity with each other and 20–30% identity with the PDZ domains of other proteins such as PSD-95 and Dlg. In place of the G-L-G-F sequence found at the core of the earliest characterized PDZ domains, the NHERF PDZ domains contain the sequence G-Y-G-F. An alignment of the NHERF and NHERF-2 PDZ domains is shown in Fig. 2 A . Analysis of the binding of the β 2 receptor tail to NHERF-2 revealed that the receptor tail binds to full-length NHERF-2 and to the first NHERF-2 PDZ domain but not to the second PDZ domain (Fig. 2 B ). These findings are identical to the situation for β 2 receptor tail binding to NHERF ( 10 ). NHERF and NHERF-2 also exhibit a very similar pattern of preferences for the panel of β 2 receptor tail mutants presented in Fig. 1 (data not shown).

Database searches for other proteins containing consensus C-terminal sequences appropriate for interaction with the first PDZ domain of the NHERF proteins yield a number of intracellular proteins. Some of these proteins are listed in Table 1 . The list of potential NHERF-binding partners includes several proteins that are the products of known human disease genes, such as CFTR and the Menke’s disease gene protein (MNK). The list also includes a number of transmembrane receptors. In addition to the β 2 -adrenergic receptor, which is known to bind to NHERF in an agonist-dependent fashion in whole cells ( 10 ), the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and the P2Y1-purinergic receptor represent potential cellular-binding partners for the NHERF proteins.

The idea that binding partners for the NHERF proteins may be identified based on the presence of the C-terminal D-S/T-x-L motif was tested by preparing the C-terminal tails of the P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors as GST fusion proteins and examining their ability to bind NHERF in the overlay assay. These two purinergic receptor subtypes exhibit 33% overall sequence identity but are divergent at their C termini: the P2Y1 receptor ends in a good motif for NHERF PDZ1 binding (D-T-S-L) whereas the P2Y2 receptor ends in a motif that is less than ideal owing to the lack of a hydroxyl-bearing amino acid at the −2 position (D-I-R-L). As shown in Fig. 3 A , the P2Y1 receptor tail exhibits robust binding of NHERF, whereas the P2Y2 receptor tail exhibits poor NHERF binding. The affinity of NHERF PDZ1 for the P2Y1 receptor tail was quantified via saturation-binding studies and compared with the NHERF-binding affinity of the β 2 receptor tail (Fig. 3 B ); the K D for β 2 receptor tail binding to NHERF PDZ1 is 18 nM, whereas the K D for P2Y1 receptor tail binding is 300 nM.

The hypothesis that interaction with the NHERF family of proteins may be predicted from the presence of a C-terminal D-S/T-x-L motif was further tested by examining the binding of NHERF to the tail of CFTR, which ends in D-T-R-L. Blotted CFTR tail fusion protein exhibited robust and specific binding of overlaid NHERF PDZ1 (Fig. 4 A ). The ability of full-length NHERF to interact with full-length CFTR was tested by in vitro translating full-length CFTR in the presence of [ 35 S]methionine and overlaying it onto blotted full-length NHERF (Fig. 4 B ). Full-length CFTR bound avidly to NHERF, as did the C-terminal tail of CFTR when assayed separately. Conversely, neither the N-terminal portion of CFTR nor a C-terminally truncated mutant CFTR (K1468X) exhibited detectable binding to NHERF. CFTR tail bound not only to recombinantly expressed NHERF but also to native NHERF from differentiated airway epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 4 C , a Triton X-100 soluble fraction derived from cultured airway epithelia revealed a band of appropriate molecular mass (50 kDa) when probed with either an anti-NHERF antibody ( 10 ) or with 32 P-labeled CFTR C-terminal fusion protein.

DISCUSSION

The results presented here demonstrate that the first PDZ domain of NHERF family proteins binds to target proteins which terminate in the C-terminal motif D-S/T-x-L. The first PDZ protein for which a preferred C-terminal motif was identified was PSD-95, which recognizes the motif T/S-x-V at the C terminus of target proteins ( 4 ). The motif recognized by NHERF is distinct in that leucine is strongly preferred over valine at the terminal position and aspartate is preferred at the −3 position. Screening of peptide libraries has helped to define the binding partner preferences of a number of PDZ domains ( 5 ), and at the present time, no other PDZ domain has been reported to have exactly the same preferences as the first PDZ domain of the NHERF proteins. Thus, it is likely that the first NHERF PDZ domain binds to a unique set of intracellular partners that does not significantly overlap with the sets of proteins bound by other PDZ domains.

The nomenclature of the NHERF family of proteins is currently somewhat confusing. NHERF was originally purified and cloned from rabbit tissue ( 8 ). Human NHERF was recently cloned ( 15 – 16 ) and termed “hNHERF” (human NHERF) ( 16 ) or “ERM-binding protein 50” ( 15 ) because it was found to bind to the ERM family of actin-binding proteins (ezrin, radixin, and moesin). NHERF-2, the close relative of NHERF reported in the present manuscript, also has been cloned recently by three independent groups who have given the protein three different names: “TKA-1” (Seedorf and Ullrich, unpublished data; GenBank accession no. Z50150 ), “E3KARP” ( 9 ), and “SIP-1” ( 11 ). To simplify the nomenclature in this area, we propose to call this species NHERF-2 because it is closely related to NHERF (52% sequence identity) and has been shown to regulate NHE3 ( 9 ). NHERF-2 (GenBank accession no. AF035771 ) is essentially identical to TKA-1 and E3KARP and is also identical to SIP-1 except for a 33-bp insertion that is present in NHERF-2 but not in SIP-1. It is likely that NHERF-2 and SIP-1 represent alternatively spliced variants of the same gene.

The finding that NHERF and NHERF-2 both recognize the motif D-S/T-x-L at the C terminus of target proteins is of interest because NHERF-2 has been identified as a binding partner for two proteins which contain variants of the motif: the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (Seedorf and Ullrich, unpublished data; GenBank accession no. Z50150 ) and the testis-determining factor SRY ( 11 ). The last four amino acids of human PDGF-A and PDGF-B receptors are D-S-F-L, consistent with the C-terminal motif determined in the present study to be optimal for NHERF PDZ1 binding. Similarly, human SRY terminates in W-T-K-L, a C-terminal motif that would be predicted from our mutagenesis studies to bind NHERF-family proteins with a reasonable affinity.

The work described in the present report not only explains the interaction of NHERF family proteins with two previously identified binding partners, it also identifies two new potential cellular NHERF-associated proteins: the P2Y1 receptor and CFTR. Although the affinity of NHERF for the tail of the P2Y1 receptor is >10-fold lower than its affinity for the tail of the β 2 receptor, this interaction could still potentially be of physiological relevance given the abundance of NHERF in some cell types. We have performed quantitative Western-blotting studies, which indicate that NHERF represents 0.005–0.01% of the total protein in crude kidney tissue (data not shown). This result corresponds to a likely average intracellular NHERF concentration of 500 nM to 1 μM (see Materials and Methods for an explanation of the calculations behind these estimates). NHERF may thus potentially bind to the P2Y1 receptor in a manner that is of physiological interest, and such an interaction may have relevance for recent observations that agonist stimulation of P2Y1 receptors can lead in some instances to physiological responses that are independent of G protein activation ( 17 ).

The interaction of NHERF with CFTR also may be of physiological interest. Mutations in CFTR cause cystic fibrosis ( 18 ). CFTR is a chloride channel, but some cellular actions of CFTR are believed to be independent of its channel activity ( 19 – 22 ). NHERF joins syntaxin ( 23 ) on a short list of CFTR-interacting proteins that might potentially mediate some of these channel-independent actions of CFTR. Interestingly, a naturally occurring truncation of the tail of CFTR (S1455X) has been recently reported ( 24 ). This mutation deletes the NHERF-binding motif characterized in the present study and produces an interesting clinical phenotype, with subjects exhibiting elevated sweat chloride concentrations but no other manifestations of cystic fibrosis. These findings suggest that the binding of NHERF or NHERF-related proteins to the tail of CFTR may be important for some aspects of CFTR function.

In summary, the motif D-S/T-x-L at the end of the β 2 receptor is necessary for high affinity interaction with the first PDZ domain of the NHERF proteins. The presence of this motif at the C terminus of proteins is a useful indicator of potential NHERF binding, as we have shown here in verifying that the C termini of the P2Y1 receptor and CFTR bind to NHERF. Consensus NHERF-binding motifs are found at the C termini of many intracellular proteins. The variety of proteins possessing C termini appropriate for high-affinity binding to NHERF and NHERF-2 suggests that the NHERF proteins may be multifunctional adaptor proteins involved in many diverse aspects of cellular signaling.
