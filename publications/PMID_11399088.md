## Abstract

1. J Mol Biol. 2001 Jun 22;309(5):1189-99. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.2001.4709.

The activity of the murine DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is controlled by 
interaction of the catalytic domain with the N-terminal part of the enzyme 
leading to an allosteric activation of the enzyme after binding to methylated 
DNA.

The mammalian DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is responsible for the maintenance of 
the pattern of DNA methylation in vivo. It is a large multidomain enzyme 
comprising 1620 amino acid residues. We have purified and characterized 
individual domains of Dnmt1 (NLS-containing domain, NlsD, amino acid residues: 
1-343; replication foci-directing domain, 350-609; Zn-binding domain (ZnD), 
613-748; polybromo domain, 746-1110; and the catalytic domain (CatD), 
1124-1620). CatD, ZnD and NlsD bind to DNA, demonstrating the existence of three 
independent DNA-binding sites in Dnmt1. CatD shows a preference for binding to 
hemimethylated CpG-sites; ZnD prefers methylated CpGs; and NlsD specifically 
binds to CpG-sites, but does not discriminate between unmethylated and 
methylated DNA. These results are not compatible with the suggestion that the 
target recognition domain of Dnmt1 resides in the N terminus of the enzyme. We 
show by protein-protein interaction assays that ZnD and CatD interact with each 
other. The isolated catalytic domain does not methylate DNA, neither alone nor 
in combination with other domains. Full-length Dnmt1 was purified from 
baculovirus-infected insect cells. Under the experimental conditions, Dnmt1 has 
a strong (50-fold) preference for hemimethylated DNA. Dnmt1 is stimulated to 
methylate unmodified CpG sites by the addition of fully methylated DNA. This 
effect is dependent on Zn, suggesting that binding of methylated DNA to ZnD 
triggers the allosteric activation of the catalytic center of Dnmt1. The 
allosteric activation model can explain kinetic data obtained by others. It 
suggests that Dnmt1 might be responsible for spreading of methylation, a process 
that is observed during aging and carcenogenesis but may be important for de 
novo methylation of DNA.
