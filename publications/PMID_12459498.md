NF-kappaB activator 1 (Act1), also called CIKS, is a recently identified protein 
with NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation activities through its association with the 
IkappaB kinase complex. We identified and confirmed that Act1 interacts with 
tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6); notably, Act1 binds 
to TRAF6 only among TRAF family proteins. The amino-terminal half of Act1 is 
required for its interaction with the TRAF domain. Act1-mediated NF-kappaB 
activation was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of TRAF6 in a 
dose-dependent manner, and IL-1-induced NF-kappaB activation was inhibited by a 
high level of Act1 expression. Our results suggest that Act1 is involved in 
IL-1/Toll-mediated signaling through TRAF6.
