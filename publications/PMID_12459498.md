NF-kappaB activator 1 (Act1), also called CIKS, is a recently identified protein 
with NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation activities through its association with the 
IkappaB kinase complex. We identified and confirmed that Act1 interacts with 
tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6); notably, Act1 binds 
to TRAF6 only among TRAF family proteins. The amino-terminal half of Act1 is 
required for its interaction with the TRAF domain. Act1-mediated NF-kappaB 
activation was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of TRAF6 in a 
dose-dependent manner, and IL-1-induced NF-kappaB activation was inhibited by a 
high level of Act1 expression. Our results suggest that Act1 is involved in 
IL-1/Toll-mediated signaling through TRAF6.

1BACKGROUNDPsoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by sharply demarcated erythematous and scaly skin lesions. The prevalence of psoriasis varies across countries and ethnic groups, ranging from 0.91% to 8.5% in Western countries, while it is lower in Asian countries, ranging from 0.24% to 0.47%.
1
 Thus, psoriasis is a major public health concern worldwide and is challenging to treat because of its complex etiology and long course.Psoriasis is caused by systemic inflammation related to imbalance between the activities of skin cells such as keratinocytes and endothelial cells, and activities of immune cells such as dendritic cells, T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages.
2
 Psoriasis appears to arise when dendritic cells are activated to produce abundant interleukin (IL)‐23 and IL‐12, which promote the differentiation of T helper cells. This leads in turn to excessive production of the pro‐inflammatory factors IL‐17, IL‐22, and tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), which induce the abnormal proliferation and apoptosis of keratinocytes. Treatment with antibodies against IL‐23 or IL‐17 can effectively alleviate the pathological symptoms of patients with psoriasis. In these ways, the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. However, how this axis contributes to skin inflammation in the disease remains unclear.After IL‐17 binds to its receptor, the receptor recruits nuclear factor κB (NF‐κB) activator 1 (ACT1),
3
 which binds via its SEF/IL17R domain to tumor necrosis factor receptor‐associated factor 6 (TRAF6), inducing its activation.
3
 TRAF6 induces the downstream effector transforming growth factor β activated kinase 1 (TAK1) to activate inhibitor of kappa B kinase (IKK).
4
 IKK regulates the activation of NF‐κB by phosphorylating the inhibitor of NF‐κB (IκB).
5
 Therefore, we hypothesized that the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis might trigger skin inflammation in psoriasis by activating ACT1‐NF‐κB signaling in the skin.To test this idea, we first evaluated levels of inflammatory factors associated with the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis in the serum of patients with psoriasis. Then, we established a mouse model of imiquimod (IMQ)‐induced psoriasis and investigated the activation of the ACT1‐NF‐κB pathway in the skin. Finally, we evaluated the effect of the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis on ACT1‐NF‐κB signaling by treating mice with anti‐IL‐23A or anti‐IL‐17A antibodies.

 Therefore, we hypothesized that the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis might trigger skin inflammation in psoriasis by activating ACT1‐NF‐κB signaling in the skin.

To test this idea, we first evaluated levels of inflammatory factors associated with the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis in the serum of patients with psoriasis. Then, we established a mouse model of imiquimod (IMQ)‐induced psoriasis and investigated the activation of the ACT1‐NF‐κB pathway in the skin. Finally, we evaluated the effect of the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis on ACT1‐NF‐κB signaling by treating mice with anti‐IL‐23A or anti‐IL‐17A antibodies.

2RESULTS2.1The IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis is activated in patients with psoriasisWe found that compared to controls, patients with psoriasis showed higher levels of serum cytokines associated with dendritic cells (IL‐12 and IL‐23), T cells (IFN‐γ, IL‐2, IL‐4, IL‐12, and IL‐17) and neutrophils (IL‐8). However, there was no significant change in anti‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐10 in serum of psoriasis patients when compared with healthy people (Figure 1). These results suggest that the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis is activated in psoriasis.FIGURE 1Levels of cytokines involved in the interleukin‐23 (IL‐23)/IL‐17 axis are elevated in the serum of patients with psoriasis. Data are mean ± standard error of the mean (n = 8). ***p < 0.001 by paired Student's t test.2.2Inhibiting IL‐23 or IL‐17 alleviates IMQ‐induced dermatitis in miceTo investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis regulates the pathology of psoriasis, we established a model of psoriasis in male C57BL/6J mice and treated the animals with recombinant IL‐23A antibody (anti‐IL‐23A) or IL‐17A antibody (anti‐IL‐17A) for 7 days. IMQ induced a severe psoriatic phenotype with high PASI, and disease worsened with the duration of IMQ treatment (Figure 2A–E). Treatment with either anti‐IL‐23A or anti‐IL‐17A antibody significantly alleviated IMQ‐induced psoriasis‐like symptoms (Figure 2A), including ear erythema (Figure 2B), scales (Figure 2C), thickeness (Figure 2D) and total scores (Figure 2E).FIGURE 2Treatment with anti‐interleukin (IL)‐17 or anti‐IL‐23 antibody alleviates imiquimod (IMQ)‐induced psoriatic symptoms in mice.

IMQ downregulated the anti‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐10 in the skin, while either anti‐IL‐23A or anti‐IL‐17A antibody upregulated it (Figure 3F). These results suggest that blocking the IL‐23/IL‐17 axis may alleviate skin inflammation at least in part by restoring levels of IL‐10.FIGURE 3Treatment with anti‐interleukin (IL)‐17 or anti‐IL‐23 antibody alleviates skin inflammation in imiquimod (IMQ)‐treated mice.

This cytokine expression pattern was similar to the one observed in the serum of patients with psoriasis. Treatment with either anti‐IL‐23A or anti‐IL‐17A antibody downregulated pro‐inflammatory cytokines IL‐23p19, IL‐17, and IL‐18, and upregulated the IL‐10 in the serum of psoriatic mice (Figure 4A–E). These results suggest that blocking the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis can help restore the normal immune response in a psoriatic mouse model.FIGURE 4Treatment with anti‐interleukin (IL)‐17 or anti‐IL‐23 antibody helps restore normal IL levels in the serum of imiquimod (IMQ)‐treated mice.

IMQ significantly upregulated interleukin‐17 receptor (IL‐17R) and its ligand ACT1 in the ear (Figure 5A–C), as well as the downstream effectors TAK1 and TRAF6 (Figure 5D,E). It also upregulated total and phosphorylated levels of NF‐κB in the skin (Figure 5F,G). Treatment with either anti‐IL‐23A or anti‐IL‐17A antibody downregulated IL‐17RC, ACT1, TRAF6, TAK1, NF‐κB, and pNF‐κB (Figure 5A–G), supporting the idea that ACT1/TRAF6/TAK1/NF‐κB signaling contributes to the skin inflammation in IMQ‐treated mice.FIGURE 5Treatment with anti‐interleukin (IL)‐17 or anti‐IL‐23 antibody inhibits ACT1/NF‐κB signaling in the ear skin of imiquimod (IMQ)‐treated animals.

The results showed that a number of NF‐κB p65+ cells in both the epidermis and dermis of psoriatic lesional skin (Figure 6A). Meanwhile, an increased number of NF‐κB p65+ cells in the epidermis and dermis of psoriatic non‐lesional skin was observed compared to healthy skin (Figure 6A). We also found that a large proportion of NF‐κB p65 localized in nucleus of involucrin+ cells in the suprabasal layers of psoriatic lesional skin (Figure 6A), and only a few proportion of NF‐κB p65 localized in K14+ cells in the basal layer of psoriatic lesional skin (Figure 6B). These results suggested that NF‐κB pathway was activated by IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis in keratinocytes of epidermis that involves psoriatic skin inflammation.FIGURE 6NF‐κB p65 expression in keratinocytes of the epidermis of psoriatic lesional skin.

The NF‐κB p65+‐K14+ cell was marked with arrowhead in high resolution illustrations below. Scale bar, 100 μm.Additionally, we investigated the activation of NF‐κB signaling pathways in skin immune cells, including T cells (CD3+), macrophage (F4/80+) and neutrophil (CD11b+), in skin tissue of mice with IMQ‐induced psoriasis by immunofluorescent staining analysis. We observed a lot of CD3+, F4/80+ or CD11b+ cells infiltrated in dermis of psoriatic lesional skin (Figure 7A–C). We then identified NF‐κB p65 expression in these cells of skin tissue of mice with IMQ‐induced psoriasis by immunofluorescent staining analysis. We found that a large proportion of NF‐κB p65 expressed in nucleus of F4/80+ cells of the dermis of psoriatic lesional skin (Figure 7A), and only a few proportion of NF‐κB p65 localized in CD3+ or CD11b+ cells in the dermis of psoriatic lesional skin (Figure 7B,C). These results suggested that NF‐κB was activated by IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis in macrophage of dermis that mediates psoriatic skin inflammation.FIGURE 7NF‐κB p65 expression in immune cell of the dermis of psoriatic lesional skin.

However, there was no significant change in anti‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐10 in serum of psoriasis patients when compared with healthy people (Figure 1). These results suggest that the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis is activated in psoriasis.FIGURE 1Levels of cytokines involved in the interleukin‐23 (IL‐23)/IL‐17 axis are elevated in the serum of patients with psoriasis.

Inhibiting IL‐23 or IL‐17 alleviates IMQ‐induced dermatitis in mice

To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis regulates the pathology of psoriasis, we established a model of psoriasis in male C57BL/6J mice and treated the animals with recombinant IL‐23A antibody (anti‐IL‐23A) or IL‐17A antibody (anti‐IL‐17A) for 7 days. IMQ induced a severe psoriatic phenotype with high PASI, and disease worsened with the duration of IMQ treatment (Figure 2A–E). Treatment with either anti‐IL‐23A or anti‐IL‐17A antibody significantly alleviated IMQ‐induced psoriasis‐like symptoms (Figure 2A), including ear erythema (Figure 2B), scales (Figure 2C), thickeness (Figure 2D) and total scores (Figure 2E).

IMQ caused an inflammatory thickening of the skin (Figure 3A,B), and upregulated IL‐17, IL‐23p19 and IL‐36 in skin (Figure 3C–E), and antibodies against IL‐23A or IL‐17A reversed the changes in IL‐17 but not the other cytokines and alleviated IMQ‐induced inflammatory thickening of the skin (Figure 3A–E). IMQ downregulated the anti‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐10 in the skin, while either anti‐IL‐23A or anti‐IL‐17A antibody upregulated it (Figure 3F). These results suggest that blocking the IL‐23/IL‐17 axis may alleviate skin inflammation at least in part by restoring levels of IL‐10.

2.3Inhibiting IL‐23 or IL‐17 alleviates IMQ‐induced abnormal immunity in miceThe IL‐23/IL‐17 signal axis was abnormally activated in the serum of our psoriatic mouse model, based on increases in the pro‐inflammatory cytokines IL‐23p19, IL‐17, and IL‐18, but not IL‐36 and IL‐10 (Figure 4A–E). This cytokine expression pattern was similar to the one observed in the serum of patients with psoriasis. Treatment with either anti‐IL‐23A or anti‐IL‐17A antibody downregulated pro‐inflammatory cytokines IL‐23p19, IL‐17, and IL‐18, and upregulated the IL‐10 in the serum of psoriatic mice (Figure 4A–E). These results suggest that blocking the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis can help restore the normal immune response in a psoriatic mouse model.FIGURE 4Treatment with anti‐interleukin (IL)‐17 or anti‐IL‐23 antibody helps restore normal IL levels in the serum of imiquimod (IMQ)‐treated mice.

2.4Psoriatic skin inflammation due to the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis involves activation of the ACT1/NF‐κB pathway in keratinocytes and macrophageTo investigate how the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis mediates skin inflammation in psoriasis, we evaluated levels of IL‐17RC, ACT1, TRAF6, TAK1, NF‐κB, and pNF‐κB proteins in skin of different mouse groups using western blotting. IMQ significantly upregulated interleukin‐17 receptor (IL‐17R) and its ligand ACT1 in the ear (Figure 5A–C), as well as the downstream effectors TAK1 and TRAF6 (Figure 5D,E). It also upregulated total and phosphorylated levels of NF‐κB in the skin (Figure 5F,G). Treatment with either anti‐IL‐23A or anti‐IL‐17A antibody downregulated IL‐17RC, ACT1, TRAF6, TAK1, NF‐κB, and pNF‐κB (Figure 5A–G), supporting the idea that ACT1/TRAF6/TAK1/NF‐κB signaling contributes to the skin inflammation in IMQ‐treated mice.FIGURE 5Treatment with anti‐interleukin (IL)‐17 or anti‐IL‐23 antibody inhibits ACT1/NF‐κB signaling in the ear skin of imiquimod (IMQ)‐treated animals.

It also upregulated total and phosphorylated levels of NF‐κB in the skin (Figure 5F,G). Treatment with either anti‐IL‐23A or anti‐IL‐17A antibody downregulated IL‐17RC, ACT1, TRAF6, TAK1, NF‐κB, and pNF‐κB (Figure 5A–G), supporting the idea that ACT1/TRAF6/TAK1/NF‐κB signaling contributes to the skin inflammation in IMQ‐treated mice.

3DISCUSSIONPrevious studies reported on the characterization of the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis induces psoriasis inflammation, but how it contributes to the underlying skin inflammation is unclear. In the present study, we found that the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis is activated in patients with psoriasis and IMQ‐treated mice. Moreover, we found that IMQ‐treated mice showed increased expression of ACT1, TRAF6, TAK1, NF‐κB, and pNF‐κB in the skin. NF‐κB pathway was activated in keratinocytes of epidermis and in macrophage of dermis of psoriatic lesional skin that involves psoriatic skin inflammation. Treatment with anti‐IL‐23A or anti‐IL‐17A antibody rescued the changes induced by IMQ and ameliorated skin inflammation. Thus, our results suggest that the ACT1/TRAF6/TAK1/NF‐κB pathway in keratinocytes and macrophage contributes to the skin inflammation mediated by the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis in psoriasis.Several immune‐related pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The immune imbalance and inflammatory response mediated by the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis play a key role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.

 Long‐term Western diets high in fat and sugar promote Th2 and Th17 differentiation through the activation of TGR5 and S1PR2, thereby exacerbating skin inflammation in psoriasis.

 Indeed, we found that patients with psoriasis showed elevated serum levels of numerous cytokines involved in the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis: IL‐2, IL‐4, IL‐8, IL‐12, IL‐17, IL‐22, IL‐23, and IFN‐γ. The up‐regulation of IL‐12 and IL‐23 is related to the maturation of dendritic cells.
10
 IL‐2 is produced by helper T cells to amplify immune responses.
11
 The up‐regulation of IFN‐γ, IL‐4 and IL‐17 is related to the maturation of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells.
12
, 
13
 The significant increase of these molecules in the sera of patients with psoriasis suggests that a hyper systemic immune response is initiated in psoriasis, specifically, dendritic cell maturation and T cells activation.IMQ‐treated mice also showed elevated levels of IL‐23p19 and IL‐17 in serum and skin. Signaling mediated by IL‐23 and IL‐17 receptors are essential to the development of psoriasis: disease development was almost completely blocked in mice deficient in IL‐23 or the IL‐17 receptor.
14
 Thus, drugs targeting the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis may be effective against psoriasis. Consistently, we found that treating IMQ mice with anti‐IL‐23A or anti‐IL‐17A antibody improved pathology score and immune imbalance.IL‐10 is an anti‐inflammatory cytokine, which can exert either immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory effects on a variety of cell types. IL‐10 is a negative regulator of psoriasis.
15
 This immunomodulatory cytokine is a central anti‐inflammatory mediator that reduces tissue damage caused by excessive and uncontrolled inflammatory stimulation and protects the host from an excessive inflammatory response.
15
 Studies found that IL‐10 level was decreased in patients with psoriasis compared to healthy controls.
16
 Interestingly, patients during established antipsoriatic therapy showed a higher IL‐10 mRNA expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells than patients before the therapy.
17
 In the present study, we observed decreased expression of IL‐10 in the skin of IMQ‐treated mice compared to healthy mice. However, either anti‐IL‐23A or anti‐IL‐17A antibody upregulated IL‐10 level in the skin of IMQ‐treated mice. A study indicated that macrophages were the major population of IL‐10‐releasing myeloid cells in the skin of mice.
15
 These results suggest that blocking the IL‐23/IL‐17 axis may alleviate skin inflammation at least in part by restoring levels of IL‐10 in macrophages of skin.The NF‐κB family of transcription factors has an essential role in immune responses, inflammation and innate immunity.
18
 NF‐κB signaling may contribute to inflammation in cancer, chronic inflammation, and autoimmune diseases.
18
 It has been found that the NF‐κB signaling is activated in psoriatic lesions and participates in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
19
 We found that IMQ upregulated pNF‐κB in the skin lesions of mice, consistent with observations in another model of IMQ‐induced mice,
20
 supporting the idea that NF‐κB signaling contributes to pathology of psoriasis. Growing evidence suggests that activation of NF‐κB occurs through release of IκB.
21
 IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ in the IKK complex can activate IκB, which further activates the NF‐κB signaling pathway.
22
 TAK1 is an important regulator to activate IKK.
23
 In the present study, IMQ activated NF‐κB by inducing TAK1 expression.It has been reported that IL‐17 binds to its receptor IL‐17R to promote the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.
24
 Transcription factor NF‐κB activator 1 (ACT1) was found to contain a SEFIR domain which is recruited by IL‐17R and mediates the IL‐17R‐ACT1 interaction.
25
 ACT1 contains two tumor TRAF binding motifs, which binds to its downstream effector TRAF6 to activate TAK1.
4
, 
26
 Furthermore, studies have revealed that activation of TRAF6/TAK1 results in the triggering of NF‐κB pathway.
27
, 
28
 In the present study, we found that IMQ upregulated IL‐17RC, ACT1, and TRAF6 in the skin lesions of mice, presumably reflecting the ability of those molecules to activate TAK1. We found that a number of NF‐κB p65+ cells in both the epidermis and dermis of psoriatic lesional skin. Meanwhile, an increased number of NF‐κB p65+ cells in the epidermis and dermis of psoriatic non‐lesional skin was observed compared to healthy skin. These results suggest that in psoriasis, the ACT1/TRAF6/TAK1 pathway activates NF‐κB signaling.It is important that IL‐17 binds to its receptor and activates ACT1 to NF‐κB signaling activation in skin.
29
 Consistently, we showed here in a mouse model of psoriasis that anti‐IL‐17A antibody downregulates ACT1 as well as other proteins related to ACT1‐activated NF‐κB signaling. Similarly, anti‐IL‐23A antibody downregulated several proteins related to this pathway: IL‐17RC, ACT1, TRAF6, NF‐κB, and pNF‐κB. These results suggest that IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis‐mediated skin inflammation in psoriasis involves activation of the ACT1/NF‐κB pathway. It is thought that the inhibition of NF‐κB signaling pathway to reduce hyperproliferation and excessive inflammation in keratinocytes could be promising anti‐psoriatic strategy.
19
 Several compounds have been found to exhibit attractive therapeutic potential for psoriasis though inhibiting NF‐κB signaling pathway, such as daphnetin, ligustrazine, cimifugin and so on.
30
, 
31
, 
32
 In addition, some nutrients of foods have also been shown to alleviate psoriasis skin inflammation though inhibiting NF‐κB activation and NF‐κB‐dependent inflammatory cytokine production, such as Vitamin B12, Genistein, Selenium and so on.
33
 Further study is needed to clarify whether the NF‐κB signaling pathway is necessary for IL‐23/IL‐17‐mediated psoriatic skin inflammation. This will require blocking specific steps in this pathway.Finally, we also defined the specific skin cells in which the ACT1/NF‐κB pathway helps drive psoriasis. We observed a lot of CD3+, F4/80+ or CD11b+ cells infiltrated in dermis of psoriatic lesional skin. And a large proportion of NF‐κB p65 localized in nucleus of involucrin+ cells in the suprabasal layers and in F4/80+ cells of the dermis of psoriatic lesional skin, and only a few proportion of NF‐κB p65 localized in K14+ cells in the basal layer and in CD3+ or CD11b+ cells in the dermis of psoriatic lesional skin. Macrophages in the skin are located in the dermis, they have scavenging and phagocytic activities.
34
 Studies have shown that NF‐κB pathway activation could induce classically activated macrophages (M1 macrophages) to initiate inflammatory processes.
35
, 
36
 These results suggested that NF‐κB pathway was activated by IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis in keratinocytes of epidermis and in macrophage of dermis that mediates psoriatic skin inflammation.Our study presents several limitations. First, the role of the ACT1/NF‐κB pathway was demonstrated here in a mouse model of psoriasis, but this should be confirmed in tissues from patients with psoriasis. Second, further work is needed to establish whether the ACT1/NF‐κB pathway is required for inflammation mediated by the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis in psoriasis.Despite these limitations, our study provides strong evidence that skin inflammation mediated by the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis in psoriasis involves activation of the ACT1/TRAF6/TAK1/NF‐κB pathway in keratinocytes and macrophage. Our results provide further insights into the pathogenesis of psoriasis and may help guide the development of new therapies.

 These results suggest that blocking the IL‐23/IL‐17 axis may alleviate skin inflammation at least in part by restoring levels of IL‐10 in macrophages of skin.

The NF‐κB family of transcription factors has an essential role in immune responses, inflammation and innate immunity.
18
 NF‐κB signaling may contribute to inflammation in cancer, chronic inflammation, and autoimmune diseases.
18
 It has been found that the NF‐κB signaling is activated in psoriatic lesions and participates in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
19
 We found that IMQ upregulated pNF‐κB in the skin lesions of mice, consistent with observations in another model of IMQ‐induced mice,
20
 supporting the idea that NF‐κB signaling contributes to pathology of psoriasis. Growing evidence suggests that activation of NF‐κB occurs through release of IκB.
21
 IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ in the IKK complex can activate IκB, which further activates the NF‐κB signaling pathway.
22
 TAK1 is an important regulator to activate IKK.
23
 In the present study, IMQ activated NF‐κB by inducing TAK1 expression.

It has been reported that IL‐17 binds to its receptor IL‐17R to promote the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.
24
 Transcription factor NF‐κB activator 1 (ACT1) was found to contain a SEFIR domain which is recruited by IL‐17R and mediates the IL‐17R‐ACT1 interaction.
25
 ACT1 contains two tumor TRAF binding motifs, which binds to its downstream effector TRAF6 to activate TAK1.
4
, 
26
 Furthermore, studies have revealed that activation of TRAF6/TAK1 results in the triggering of NF‐κB pathway.
27
, 
28
 In the present study, we found that IMQ upregulated IL‐17RC, ACT1, and TRAF6 in the skin lesions of mice, presumably reflecting the ability of those molecules to activate TAK1. We found that a number of NF‐κB p65+ cells in both the epidermis and dermis of psoriatic lesional skin. Meanwhile, an increased number of NF‐κB p65+ cells in the epidermis and dermis of psoriatic non‐lesional skin was observed compared to healthy skin. These results suggest that in psoriasis, the ACT1/TRAF6/TAK1 pathway activates NF‐κB signaling.

It is important that IL‐17 binds to its receptor and activates ACT1 to NF‐κB signaling activation in skin.
29
 Consistently, we showed here in a mouse model of psoriasis that anti‐IL‐17A antibody downregulates ACT1 as well as other proteins related to ACT1‐activated NF‐κB signaling. Similarly, anti‐IL‐23A antibody downregulated several proteins related to this pathway: IL‐17RC, ACT1, TRAF6, NF‐κB, and pNF‐κB. These results suggest that IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis‐mediated skin inflammation in psoriasis involves activation of the ACT1/NF‐κB pathway. It is thought that the inhibition of NF‐κB signaling pathway to reduce hyperproliferation and excessive inflammation in keratinocytes could be promising anti‐psoriatic strategy.
19
 Several compounds have been found to exhibit attractive therapeutic potential for psoriasis though inhibiting NF‐κB signaling pathway, such as daphnetin, ligustrazine, cimifugin and so on.
30
, 
31
, 
32
 In addition, some nutrients of foods have also been shown to alleviate psoriasis skin inflammation though inhibiting NF‐κB activation and NF‐κB‐dependent inflammatory cytokine production, such as Vitamin B12, Genistein, Selenium and so on.
33
 Further study is needed to clarify whether the NF‐κB signaling pathway is necessary for IL‐23/IL‐17‐mediated psoriatic skin inflammation. This will require blocking specific steps in this pathway.

Finally, we also defined the specific skin cells in which the ACT1/NF‐κB pathway helps drive psoriasis. We observed a lot of CD3+, F4/80+ or CD11b+ cells infiltrated in dermis of psoriatic lesional skin. And a large proportion of NF‐κB p65 localized in nucleus of involucrin+ cells in the suprabasal layers and in F4/80+ cells of the dermis of psoriatic lesional skin, and only a few proportion of NF‐κB p65 localized in K14+ cells in the basal layer and in CD3+ or CD11b+ cells in the dermis of psoriatic lesional skin. Macrophages in the skin are located in the dermis, they have scavenging and phagocytic activities.
34
 Studies have shown that NF‐κB pathway activation could induce classically activated macrophages (M1 macrophages) to initiate inflammatory processes.
35
, 
36
 These results suggested that NF‐κB pathway was activated by IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis in keratinocytes of epidermis and in macrophage of dermis that mediates psoriatic skin inflammation.

Our study presents several limitations. First, the role of the ACT1/NF‐κB pathway was demonstrated here in a mouse model of psoriasis, but this should be confirmed in tissues from patients with psoriasis. Second, further work is needed to establish whether the ACT1/NF‐κB pathway is required for inflammation mediated by the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis in psoriasis.

Despite these limitations, our study provides strong evidence that skin inflammation mediated by the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis in psoriasis involves activation of the ACT1/TRAF6/TAK1/NF‐κB pathway in keratinocytes and macrophage. Our results provide further insights into the pathogenesis of psoriasis and may help guide the development of new therapies.

4CONCLUSIONOur results suggest that the IL‐23/IL‐17 immune axis helps drive skin inflammation in psoriasis via the activation of the NF‐κB signaling pathway in keratinocytes and macrophage through the ACT1/TRAF6/TAK1 pathway. These findings provide further insights into the pathogenesis of psoriasis and may guide the development of novel drugs for targeting the ACT1/NF‐κB pathway in skin.

On day 8 after the start of treatment, mice were euthanized (cervical dislocation), and skin was obtained and postfixed with 4.0% paraformaldehyde for 48 h and in 30% sucrose for 24 h. Skin sections (25 μm thick) were cut using a sliding vibratome (CM1900; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and collected in PBS. Six sequential slices were placed into each well of a 12‐well plate and stored at 4°C. Skin samples were immunofluorescence stained by involucrin for the precursor protein of the keratinocyte cornified envelope, Cytokeratin 14 antibody for mature keratinocytes, CD3 for T cells, F4/80 for macrophages, CD11b for granulocyte, NF‐κB p65 antibody for anti‐NF‐κB p65. The slices were blocked in 10% donkey serum for 2 h, incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies were Mouse anti‐NF‐κB p65 (1:300; Santa Cruz, USA), mouse anti‐involucrin (1:300; Novus, USA), mouse anti‐Cytokeratin 14 (1:300; Novus, USA), Rabbit anti‐NF‐κB p65 (1:300; G‐Biosciences, USA), Rabbit anti‐CD3 (1:400; Cell Signaling Technology, USA), Rabbit anti‐CD11b (1:400; Cell Signaling Technology), Rabbit anti‐ F4/80 (1:400; Cell Signaling Technology). Slices were washed three times with PBS, then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with DyLight 549‐ or DyLight 488‐conjugate secondary antibodies (both 1:300; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA). Finally, cells were incubated for 5 min with 4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI; 1:10,000, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX 73, Tokyo, Japan).5.9Statistical analysisStatistical analyses and graphic representations were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 software (San Diego, CA, USA). All data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Differences between the mean values were evaluated by a paired Student's t‐test for independent samples. Multiple groups were compared with either one‐way analysis of variance, followed by the Turkey post hoc test. Differences associated with p of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. Statistical tests are specified in individual figure legends.

Skin sections (25 μm thick) were cut using a sliding vibratome (CM1900; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and collected in PBS. Six sequential slices were placed into each well of a 12‐well plate and stored at 4°C. Skin samples were immunofluorescence stained by involucrin for the precursor protein of the keratinocyte cornified envelope, Cytokeratin 14 antibody for mature keratinocytes, CD3 for T cells, F4/80 for macrophages, CD11b for granulocyte, NF‐κB p65 antibody for anti‐NF‐κB p65. The slices were blocked in 10% donkey serum for 2 h, incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies were Mouse anti‐NF‐κB p65 (1:300; Santa Cruz, USA), mouse anti‐involucrin (1:300; Novus, USA), mouse anti‐Cytokeratin 14 (1:300; Novus, USA), Rabbit anti‐NF‐κB p65 (1:300; G‐Biosciences, USA), Rabbit anti‐CD3 (1:400; Cell Signaling Technology, USA), Rabbit anti‐CD11b (1:400; Cell Signaling Technology), Rabbit anti‐ F4/80 (1:400; Cell Signaling Technology). Slices were washed three times with PBS, then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with DyLight 549‐ or DyLight 488‐conjugate secondary antibodies (both 1:300; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA). Finally, cells were incubated for 5 min with 4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI; 1:10,000, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX 73, Tokyo, Japan).

5.9Statistical analysisStatistical analyses and graphic representations were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 software (San Diego, CA, USA). All data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Differences between the mean values were evaluated by a paired Student's t‐test for independent samples. Multiple groups were compared with either one‐way analysis of variance, followed by the Turkey post hoc test. Differences associated with p of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. Statistical tests are specified in individual figure legends.
