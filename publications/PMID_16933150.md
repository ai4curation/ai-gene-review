Examination of the cytoskeleton has demonstrated the pivotal role of regulatory 
proteins governing cytoskeletal dynamics. Most work has focused on cell cycle 
and cell migration regarding cancer. However, these studies have yielded 
tremendous insight for development, particularly in the nervous system where all 
major cell types remodel their shape, generate unsurpassed quantities of 
membranes and extend cellular processes to communicate, and regulate the 
activities of other cells. Herein, we analyze two microtubule regulatory 
alpha-tubulin deacetylases, histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) and SirT2. HDAC6 is 
expressed by most neurons but is abundant in cerebellar Purkinje cells. In 
contrast, SirT2 is targeted to myelin sheaths. Expression of these proteins by 
post-mitotic cells indicates novel functions, such as process outgrowth and 
membrane remodeling. In oligodendrocytes, targeting of SirT2 to paranodes 
coincides with the presence of the microtubule-destabilizing protein stathmin-1 
during early myelinogenesis and suggests the existence of a microtubule 
regulatory network that modulates cytoskeletal dynamics.
