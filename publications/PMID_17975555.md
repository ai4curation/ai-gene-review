Pathogen recognition through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is crucial in order to 
mount an appropriate immune response against microorganisms. On the basis of a 
lack of evidence indicating that Caenorhabditis elegans uses TLRs to elicit an 
immune response and on the absence of genes encoding Rel-like transcription 
factors in its genome, it is believed that TLR-mediated immunity arose after 
coelomates split from pseudocoelomates and acoelomates. Here, we show that C. 
elegans tol-1(nr2033) mutants are killed by the human pathogen Salmonella 
enterica, which causes a significant pharyngeal invasion in the absence of 
TOL-1-mediated immunity. We also show that TOL-1 is required for the correct 
expression of ABF-2, which is a defensin-like molecule expressed in the pharynx, 
and heat-shock protein 16.41, which is also expressed in the pharynx and is part 
of a HSP family of proteins required for C. elegans immunity. The results 
indicate that TOL-1 has a direct role in defence response to certain 
Gram-negative bacteria and indicate that part of the TLR-mediated immunity might 
be evolutionarily conserved.
