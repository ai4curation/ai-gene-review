Osteoclasts are multinucleated haematopoietic cells that resorb bone. Increased 
osteoclast activity causes osteoporosis, a disorder resulting in a low bone mass 
and a high risk of fractures. Increased osteoclast size and numbers are also a 
hallmark of other disorders, such as Paget's disease and multiple myeloma. The 
protein c-Fos, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, is 
essential for osteoclast differentiation. Here we show that the Fos-related 
protein Fra-2 controls osteoclast survival and size. The bones of 
Fra-2-deficient newborn mice have giant osteoclasts, and signalling through 
leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and its receptor is impaired. Similarly, 
newborn animals lacking LIF have giant osteoclasts, and we show that LIF is a 
direct transcriptional target of Fra-2 and c-Jun. Moreover, bones deficient in 
Fra-2 and LIF are hypoxic and express increased levels of hypoxia-induced factor 
1alpha (HIF1alpha) and Bcl-2. Overexpression of Bcl-2 is sufficient to induce 
giant osteoclasts in vivo, whereas Fra-2 and LIF affect HIF1alpha through 
transcriptional modulation of the HIF prolyl hydroxylase PHD2. This pathway is 
operative in the placenta, because specific inactivation of Fra-2 in the embryo 
alone does not cause hypoxia or the giant osteoclast phenotype. Thus 
placenta-induced hypoxia during embryogenesis leads to the formation of giant 
osteoclasts in young pups. These findings offer potential targets for the 
treatment of syndromes associated with increased osteoclastogenesis.
