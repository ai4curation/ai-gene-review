MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1) is an antiapoptotic BCL-2 family protein 
discovered as an early induction gene during myeloblastic leukemia cell 
differentiation. This survival protein has the BCL-2 homology (BH) domains 1, 2, 
and 3 and a C-terminal transmembrane region. We identified a short splicing 
variant of the MCL-1 mRNA in the human placenta encoding a protein, termed MCL-1 
short (MCL-1S), with an altered C terminus as compared with the full-length 
MCL-1 long (MCL-1L), leading to the loss of BH1, BH2, and the transmembrane 
domains. Analysis of the human MCL-1 gene indicated that MCL-1S results from the 
splicing out of exon 2 during mRNA processing. MCL-1S, unlike MCL-1L, does not 
interact with diverse proapoptotic BCL-2-related proteins in the yeast 
two-hybrid system. In contrast, MCL-1S dimerizes with MCL-1L in the yeast assay 
and coprecipitates with MCL-1L in transfected mammalian cells. Overexpression of 
MCL-1S induces apoptosis in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, and the 
MCL-1S action was antagonized by the antiapoptotic MCL-1L. Thus, the naturally 
occurring MCL-1S variant represents a new proapoptotic BH3 domain-only protein 
capable of dimerizing with the antiapoptotic MCL-1L. The fate of 
MCL-1-expressing cells could be regulated through alternative splicing 
mechanisms and interactions of the resulting anti- and proapoptotic gene 
products.
