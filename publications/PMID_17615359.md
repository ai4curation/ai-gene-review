Inflammation is increasingly recognized as an important component of 
tumorigenesis, although the mechanisms and pathways involved are not well 
understood. Tumor development is regulated by products of several modifier 
genes, but instructions for their tumor-specific expression are currently 
unknown. We show that the signaling through the adaptor protein MyD88 has a 
critical role in spontaneous tumor development in mice with heterozygous 
mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. We found that 
MyD88-dependent signaling controls the expression of several key modifier genes 
of intestinal tumorigenesis and has a critical role in both spontaneous and 
carcinogen-induced tumor development. This study thus reveals the important role 
of an innate immune signaling pathway in intestinal tumorigenesis.
