Clusterin is an extracellular chaperone present in all disease-associated 
extracellular amyloid deposits, but its roles in amyloid formation and protein 
deposition in vivo are poorly understood. The current study initially aimed to 
characterize the effects of clusterin on amyloid formation in vitro by a panel 
of eight protein substrates. Two of the substrates (Alzheimer's beta peptide and 
a PI3-SH3 domain) were then used in further experiments to examine the effects 
of clusterin on amyloid cytotoxicity and to probe the mechanism of clusterin 
action. We show that clusterin exerts potent effects on amyloid formation, the 
nature and extent of which vary greatly with the clusterin:substrate ratio, and 
provide evidence that these effects are exerted via interactions with 
prefibrillar species that share common structural features. Proamyloidogenic 
effects of clusterin appear to be restricted to conditions in which the 
substrate protein is present at a very large molar excess; under these same 
conditions, clusterin coincorporates with substrate protein into insoluble 
aggregates. However, when clusterin is present at much higher but still 
substoichiometric levels (e.g., a molar ratio of clusterin:substrate=1:10), it 
potently inhibits amyloid formation and provides substantial cytoprotection. 
These findings suggest that clusterin is an important element in the control of 
extracellular protein misfolding.
