An E3B1/Abi2/Argbp1/NESH protein family has recently emerged from analysis of 
the sequence and structural similarities. These are adaptor proteins possessing 
homeobox homology domain, proline rich region and Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain 
that interact with Abl-family tyrosine kinases. Some of the members of this 
family are involved in cytoskeletal reorganization that plays important roles in 
membrane-ruffling, lamellipodia formation and cell migration. Furthermore, it 
seems likely that this family may also regulate cancer development through 
modulation of the oncogenic Abl kinase. The knowledge of this status is helpful 
in thinking of the regulatory mechanisms to cell metastasis and to malignant 
transformation of cancer. We discuss how these interesting molecules work and 
consider their involvement in cancer.
