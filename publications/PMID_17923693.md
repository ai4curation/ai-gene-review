Spatial and temporal resolution of intracellular signaling can be achieved by 
compartmentalizing transduction units. Myopodin is a dual-compartment, 
actin-bundling protein that shuttles between the nucleus and the Z-disc of 
myocytes in a differentiation- and stress-dependent fashion. Importin alpha 
binding and nuclear import of myopodin are regulated by serine/threonine 
phosphorylation-dependent binding of myopodin to 14-3-3. Here we show that in 
the heart myopodin forms a Z-disc signaling complex with alpha-actinin, 
calcineurin, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), muscle-specific 
A-kinase anchoring protein, and myomegalin. Phosphorylation of myopodin by 
protein kinase A (PKA) or CaMKII mediates 14-3-3 binding and nuclear import in 
myoblasts. Dephosphorylation of myopodin by calcineurin abrogates 14-3-3beta 
binding. Activation of PKA or inhibition of calcineurin in adult cardiac 
myocytes releases myopodin from the Z-disc and induces its nuclear import. The 
identification of myopodin as a direct target of PKA, CaMKII, and calcineurin 
defines a novel intracellular signaling pathway whereby changes in Z-disc 
dynamics may translate into compartmentalized signal transduction in the heart.
