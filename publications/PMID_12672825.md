The inhibitor-of-growth (ING) family of proteins was founded by human ING1, a 
tumor suppressor interacting with p53 in vivo and required for its function in 
transcription/apoptosis. There are five different ING genes in humans, three of 
which have been linked to p53 function. In this study, we analyzed the three ING 
family members present in yeast. We demonstrate that each one is purified as a 
key component of a specific histone-modifying complex. Pho23 is part of 
Rpd3/Sin3 histone deacetylase complex, while Yng1 and Yng2 are subunits of the 
NuA3 and NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complexes, respectively. We also show 
that the three different ING proteins have opposite roles in transcriptional 
activation by p53 in vivo. These effects are linked to the presence of each ING 
in its respective chromatin modifying complex, since mutation of the 
corresponding catalytic subunit gave similar results. Depletion of Pho23/Rpd3 
leads to increased p53-dependent transcription in vivo while depletion of Yng2 
abrogates it. Surprisingly, deletion of YNG1 or SAS3 leads to increased 
transcriptional activation by p53. These data suggest that the NuA3 complex can 
function in gene-specific repression, an unusual role for a histone 
acetyltransferase complex. They also demonstrate the key specific role of ING 
proteins in different chromatin modifying complexes and their opposite functions 
in p53-dependent transcription.
