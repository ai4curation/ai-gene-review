In Drosophila embryos the protein Naked cuticle (Nkd) limits the effects of the 
Wnt signal Wingless (Wg) during early segmentation. nkd loss of function results 
in segment polarity defects and embryonic death, but how nkd affects Wnt 
signaling is unknown. Using ectopic expression, we find that Nkd affects, in a 
cell-autonomous manner, a transduction step between the Wnt signaling components 
Dishevelled (Dsh) and Zeste-white 3 kinase (Zw3). Zw3 is essential for 
repressing Wg target-gene transcription in the absence of a Wg signal, and the 
role of Wg is to relieve this inhibition. Our double-mutant analysis shows that, 
in contrast to Zw3, Nkd acts when the Wg pathway is active to restrain signal 
transduction. Yeast two hybrid and in vitro experiments indicate that Nkd 
directly binds to the basic-PDZ region of Dsh. Specially timed Nkd 
overexpression is capable of abolishing Dsh function in a distinct signaling 
pathway that controls planar-cell polarity. Our results suggest that Nkd acts 
directly through Dsh to limit Wg activity and thus determines how efficiently 
Wnt signals stabilize Armadillo (Arm)/beta-catenin and activate downstream 
genes.

Abstract

In Drosophila embryos the protein Naked cuticle (Nkd) limits the effects of the Wnt signal Wingless (Wg) during early segmentation. nkd loss of function results in segment polarity defects and embryonic death, but how nkd affects Wnt signaling is unknown. Using ectopic expression, we find that Nkd affects, in a cell-autonomous manner, a transduction step between the Wnt signaling components Dishevelled (Dsh) and Zeste-white 3 kinase (Zw3). Zw3 is essential for repressing Wg target-gene transcription in the absence of a Wg signal, and the role of Wg is to relieve this inhibition. Our double-mutant analysis shows that, in contrast to Zw3, Nkd acts when the Wg pathway is active to restrain signal transduction. Yeast two hybrid and in vitro experiments indicate that Nkd directly binds to the basic-PDZ region of Dsh. Specially timed Nkd overexpression is capable of abolishing Dsh function in a distinct signaling pathway that controls planar-cell polarity. Our results suggest that Nkd acts directly through Dsh to limit Wg activity and thus determines how efficiently Wnt signals stabilize Armadillo (Arm)/β-catenin and activate downstream genes.

Discussion

Segment polarity genes encode signaling proteins that establish cell fate within each segment of the Drosophila embryo. A positive feedback loop between the Wg and Hh signaling pathways, active in adjacent cells, specifies parasegmental boundaries during early segmentation. Previous work showed that nkd is necessary to restrict the expression of the Wg target gene en as soon as its expression becomes dependent on Wg ( Bejsovec and Wieschaus 1993 ; van den Heuvel et al. 1993 ). The inducible antagonist role of Nkd creates a negative feedback loop that limits Wg signaling during early embryogenesis ( Zeng et al. 2000 ). Here we provide experimental evidence that nkd also regulates Wg activity in the eye. Our epistasis study suggests that Nkd acts cell-autonomously to antagonize Wg signaling at the level of, or between, Dsh and Zw3. In agreement with this study, yeast and biochemical experiments reveal that Nkd can bind directly to Dsh. Misexpressed Nkd specifically phenocopies loss of dsh in planar cell polarity, showing that Nkd can specifically interfere with endogenous dsh function.

Our data suggest a model of how Nkd limits early Wg signaling in the embryo. At stage 8–9 of wild-type embryonic development, when early segmental patterning events are taking place, Wg protein maintains the transcription of en/hh in adjacent posterior cells ( Klingensmith and Nusse 1994 ). Cells located farther posterior receive an insufficient amount of Wg for induction of en/hh expression ( Vincent and O'Farrell 1992 ). In nkd mutants at this stage, the more posterior cells ectopically express en/hh in a fashion that is Wg-dependent ( Bejsovec and Wieschaus 1993 ; van den Heuvel et al. 1993 ). When ectopic en/hh transcription is first observed in nkd mutants at stage 8–9, Wg distribution is apparently normal ( Moline et al. 1999 ; data not shown), indicating that Nkd normally prevents more distant cells from turning on en/hh in response to Wg. Consistent with this requirement, we saw enhanced nkd expression precisely in these more distant cells during stage 9 ( Zeng et al. 2000 ). Our present results suggest that Nkd may act through Dsh in those cells to block Wg activity. Later in development, at stage 10–11, inappropriate Wg distribution may also contribute to the nkd phenotype ( Moline et al. 1999 ). By stage 11, an ectopic stripe of wg expression is induced just posterior to the expanded en/hh domain and is required for the excess naked cuticle seen in nkd mutants ( Dougan and DiNardo 1992 ). This extra wg stripe depends on Wg and Hh activities, as well as on the action of the pair-rule transcription factors Sloppy paired ( Bejsovec and Wieschaus 1993 ; van den Heuvel et al. 1993 ; Cadigan et al. 1994 ).

Our experiments further clarify the differences between Nkd and Zw3 in Wg signaling. Embryos lacking both maternal and zygotic zw3 have a naked cuticle phenotype and expanded stripes of en transcription as in nkd mutants ( Perrimon and Smouse 1989 ; Siegfried et al. 1992 ). Both Zw3 and Nkd are negative regulators of en transcription ( Martinez Arias et al. 1988 ; Siegfried et al. 1992 ), but en stripe expansion is independent of Wg signaling in zw3 mutants and Wg dependent in nkd mutants ( Siegfried et al. 1992 ; Bejsovec and Wieschaus 1993 ; van den Heuvel et al. 1993 ). Cuticles derived from double-mutant embryos illustrate the difference: zw3; wg and zw3 dsh mutants resemble zw3 embryos ( Siegfried et al. 1992 , 1994 ; Peifer et al. 1994 ), whereas embryos doubly mutant for nkd and either wg ( Bejsovec and Wieschaus 1993 ) or dsh (this study) have a wg -like phenotype. In the absence of Wg, Zw3 phosphorylates and causes degradation of Arm, whereas in cells receiving Wg signal, Zw3 activity is inactivated. If Zw3 function is eliminated by mutation, Arm becomes stable and stimulates target-gene transcription, regardless of upstream Wg or Dsh activities. In contrast, the removal of Nkd in wg or dsh embryos does not lead to excess target-gene activity. Therefore, Wg does not act through Nkd—in the sense that it does through Zw3—to regulate en transcription and epidermal patterning. Taken together, our findings show that Nkd acts as a regulatory component that restrains Wg signal transduction.

The phenotypes of double-mutant embryos are consistent with the observation that the nkd gene is itself regulated by Wg signaling ( Zeng et al. 2000 ). The level of nkd mRNA is markedly decreased in wg mutants ( Zeng et al. 2000 ); so complete loss of nkd (i.e., in a nkd mutant) in a wg mutant would not be expected to dramatically alter the wg phenotype. In contrast, zw3 transcripts are ubiquitous during embryonic stages ( Bourouis et al. 1990 ; Siegfried et al. 1990 ), and no indication of Wg control of zw3 transcription has been found. Various signaling pathways are regulated in a negative feedback loop by components acting in the extracellular space, in the cytoplasm and/or in the nucleus ( Perrimon and McMahon 1999 ; Freeman 2000 ). Those mechanisms elegantly buffer cellular responses against signal level fluctuations during pattern formation. Our results allow classification of Nkd as a novel intracellular negative feedback antagonist that acts cell-autonomously in the Wg/Wnt pathway in a manner analogous to sprouty in the EGFR pathway, puckered in the JNK pathway, or daughters against dpp in the TGF-β/Dpp pathway ( Perrimon and McMahon 1999 ).

The biochemical and cell biological roles of Dsh in Wg and PCP signaling remain a mystery. Previous work showed that these two pathways employ Dsh in distinct ways, through different domains, to transduce signals ( Axelrod et al. 1998 ; Boutros et al. 1998 ). Under certain circumstances Wg signaling can titrate Dsh from its function in planar cell polarity ( Axelrod et al. 1998 ). We showed that aberrant Nkd production during times when Dsh is participating in PCP signaling results in polarity defects specific to loss of dsh function, confirming that Nkd can affect the activity of endogenous Dsh. Polarized subcellular localization of PCP components appears to be essential for normal PCP signaling ( Tomlinson and Struhl 1999 ; Usui et al. 1999 ). Control of Dsh subcellular localization has been implicated as a distinguishing feature in its two distinct roles in signal transduction: In a heterologous system, Fz is capable of recruiting Dsh to the plasma membrane, whereas DFz2, which is not involved in PCP signaling, is not ( Axelrod et al. 1998 ). Recently, Dsh has been shown to regulate convergent extension movements during Xenopus gastrulation by modulating the frequency of filopodial extensions on adjacent faces of individual cells ( Wallingford et al. 2000 ). Upon Wg signal activation, Dsh is phosphorylated, but the biochemical function of this phosphorylation is not known ( Yanagawa et al. 1995 ). By directly interacting with Dsh, Nkd may sequester, degrade, or modify Dsh to block participation in PCP or Wg signaling. Future experiments will seek to elucidate the cellular and biochemical consequences of the interaction between Nkd and Dsh during Wg signaling.

That Nkd can act through Dsh has important implications for the dynamic control of Wg/Wnt signaling. By acting upstream of the β-catenin degradation machinery, Nkd may determine how effectively a given dose of Wnt causes β-catenin accumulation and target-gene activation and thereby influence the sensitivity of a cell to a given amount or type of Wnt ligand. The kinetic and dynamic parameters of the feedback loop involving Wg, Dsh, and Nkd may play key roles in controlling the duration and extent of signaling activity. Tight regulation of this feedback loop is clearly important for normal Drosophila embryonic development, and in various animals it may be subject to spatial and temporal adjustments during evolution or during disease progression. Future experiments will test how the interaction between Nkd and Dsh affects responses to Wnt signals during development and may provide insight into Wnt-associated tumor progression.
