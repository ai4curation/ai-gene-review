Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 are growth factor-sensitive 
serine/threonine kinases. cDNAs for both human kinases were isolated and 
sequenced. The nucleic acid and deduced protein sequences of human extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase 1 were 88% and 96% identical, respectively, to the 
homologous rat sequences. The nucleic acid and deduced protein sequences of 
human extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 were 90% and 98% identical, 
respectively, to the corresponding rat sequences. A human extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase 2 specific probe was used to demonstrate that the mRNA 
for this kinase was present in T cells and did not change with activation. The 
deduced protein sequences of both human kinases were greater than 95% identical 
to two Xenopus kinase sequences, indicating that these enzymes are highly 
conserved across species.
