Histones are rapidly evicted and deposited during transcription by RNA 
polymerase (Pol) II, but a factor that mediates histone eviction in vivo has not 
yet been identified. Here, we show that the histone chaperone Asf1 associates 
with promoters and coding regions of transcriptionally active genes. Asf1 
mediates histone H3, but not H2B, eviction and deposition during Pol II 
elongation, suggesting that nucleosome assembly and disassembly occur in a 
stepwise fashion. Lastly, Asf1 inhibits internal initiation from cryptic 
promoters within coding regions. These results strongly suggest that Asf1 
functions as an elongation factor to disassemble and reassemble histones during 
Pol II elongation.
