The coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 α 
(PGC-1α) is widely considered a central transcriptional regulator of adaptive 
thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, mice lacking PGC-1α 
specifically in adipose tissue have only mild thermogenic defects, suggesting 
the presence of additional regulators. Using the activity of estrogen-related 
receptors (ERRs), downstream effectors of PGC-1α, as read-out in a 
high-throughput genome-wide cDNA screen, we identify here growth arrest and 
DNA-damage-inducible protein 45 γ (GADD45γ) as a cold-induced activator of 
uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and oxidative capacity in BAT. Mice lacking Gadd45γ 
have defects in Ucp1 induction and the thermogenic response to cold. GADD45γ 
works by activating MAPK p38, which is a potent activator of ERRβ and ERRγ 
transcriptional function. GADD45γ activates ERRγ independently of PGC-1 
coactivators, yet synergizes with PGC-1α to induce the thermogenic program. Our 
findings elucidate a previously unidentified GADD45γ/p38/ERRγ pathway that 
regulates BAT thermogenesis and may enable new approaches for the stimulation of 
energy expenditure. Our study also implicates GADD45 proteins as general 
metabolic regulators.

Abstract

The coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 α (PGC-1α) is widely considered a central transcriptional regulator of adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, mice lacking PGC-1α specifically in adipose tissue have only mild thermogenic defects, suggesting the presence of additional regulators. Using the activity of estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), downstream effectors of PGC-1α, as read-out in a high-throughput genome-wide cDNA screen, we identify here growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45 γ (GADD45γ) as a cold-induced activator of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and oxidative capacity in BAT. Mice lacking Gadd45γ have defects in Ucp1 induction and the thermogenic response to cold. GADD45γ works by activating MAPK p38, which is a potent activator of ERRβ and ERRγ transcriptional function. GADD45γ activates ERRγ independently of PGC-1 coactivators, yet synergizes with PGC-1α to induce the thermogenic program. Our findings elucidate a previously unidentified GADD45γ/p38/ERRγ pathway that regulates BAT thermogenesis and may enable new approaches for the stimulation of energy expenditure. Our study also implicates GADD45 proteins as general metabolic regulators.

Discussion

BAT thermogenesis defends body temperature in cold environments and can dissipate excess energy in states of high caloric intake ( 1 , 2 , 7 ). Greater understanding of the transcriptional networks that regulate BAT thermogenic capacity is important to design strategies that enhance energy expenditure, which may serve to counteract obesity. Here, we identify GADD45γ as a regulator of thermogenic capacity in brown adipocytes. Gadd45γ is rapidly and transiently induced by norepinephrine in brown adipocytes, in a PKA-dependent manner, and by cold exposure in BAT of mice. GADD45γ mediates the norepinephrine-dependent activation of MAPK p38, which activates ERRγ transcriptional activity, leading to the induction of UCP1 and enhancement of oxidative capacity ( Fig. S6 A ). Our study establishes GADD45γ/p38/ERRγ as a BAT signaling pathway that links adrenergic stimulation to the induction of the thermogenic program. It also suggests that Gadd45 proteins may have more general metabolic roles.

GADD45γ and PGC-1α are coinduced in response to cold and synergistically induce genes important for BAT thermogenesis. Part of the observed synergy may reflect the ability of GADD45γ, via p38, to enhance the transcriptional activity of PGC-1α ( Fig. S6 A ) ( 28 , 29 ). In addition, GADD45γ and PGC-1α may selectively activate different DNA-binding transcription factors that synergize with each other (e.g., ERRβ/γ and ERRα, respectively). The existence of multiple inducible transcriptional regulators likely enables broad and robust thermogenic responses to signals like cold. It may also enable more specific activation of a narrower target gene set in response to signals, yet to be identified, that selectively induce just GADD45γ or just PGC-1α.

Our study shows that activation of p38 is the major mechanism by which GADD45γ induces Ucp1 and other ERR targets. In brown adipocytes, activation of p38 by norepinephrine requires PKA and is mediated by MKK3 and MKK6; the mechanism by which PKA activates the MKK3/6-p38 kinase cascade has so far been unknown ( 1 , 25 ). Our findings suggest that activated PKA drives the induction of Gadd45γ , which activates MTK1, the upstream activator of MKK3/6, which then phosphorylate p38 ( Fig. S6 A ) ( 23 , 24 ). GADD45γ action via p38 signaling is also seen in other physiological contexts ( 20 , 30 , 31 ). The two other GADD45 family members, GADD45α and GADD45β, can also activate p38 in a signal-dependent manner ( 23 ). Consistent with this conserved GADD45 function, overexpression of GADD45α in primary adipocytes mimicked GADD45γ and enhanced ERRγ-dependent transcription ( Fig. S6 B ). Although GADD45α and GADD45β are not induced in BAT by cold, they may be induced by other signals that activate the thermogenic program.

Although multiple kinases have been shown to regulate ERRα activity ( 32 ), our observation that p38 activates ERRβ and ERRγ provides, to our knowledge, the first insight into how these other ERRs integrate extracellular signals. Notably, p38 was able to strongly activate ERRβ and ERRγ in 10T1/2 cells that lack endogenous PGC-1α and PGC-1β expression, indicating that its effects were not mediated by phosphorylation and activation of PGC-1 coactivators. It remains to be determined whether MAPK p38 activates ERRβ and ERRγ via direct phosphorylation or through regulation of alternative coregulators. Interestingly, additional ERRβ/γ activators identified in the cDNA screen are known p38 activators, suggesting that multiple hits in our screen activated Gal4-ERRβ by increasing p38 signaling (e.g., the scaffold protein p62/SQSTM1 scored in the top 12 hits and has been shown to regulate p38 activity) ( 33 ).

The ability of p38 to activate ERRβ and ERRγ may have implications for physiological responses other than BAT thermogenesis where ERRs play roles, such as exercise-induced adaptations in skeletal muscle. The MKK3/6 and p38 signaling cascade is activated in skeletal muscle by exercise, and p38γ is necessary for aspects of the adaptive response to exercise ( 34 , 35 ). Muscle ERRγ expression levels correlate with exercise performance in humans ( 36 ). Moreover, mice lacking ERRβ and ERRγ in skeletal muscle have decreased running capacity whereas mice overexpressing ERRγ in muscle show increased exercise capacity ( 36 – 38 ). We speculate that p38-mediated activation of ERRβ and ERRγ may link exercise to adaptive metabolic changes in skeletal muscle.

Our work underscores the complexity of the transcriptional network that controls BAT thermogenesis. Multiple members of the PGC-1 and GADD45 families are expressed in BAT and have the potential to activate the thermogenic program. The existence of multiple interacting pathways likely explains why single knock-out mouse models (e.g., Pgc-1α or Gadd45γ) display relatively mild thermogenic phenotypes and highlights the challenge of defining the roles of these regulators in whole-body energy homeostasis. On the upside, the discovery of more molecular players that stimulate BAT activity may provide further avenues to increase energy expenditure for potential therapeutic purposes.
