The promoter regions of many interferon-inducible genes share a short DNA 
sequence motif, termed the interferon consensus sequence (ICS) to which several 
regulatory proteins bind. A murine cDNA which encodes an ICS binding protein has 
been reported (M-ICSBP). The cloning of the human homologue of ICSBP (H-ICSBP) 
is described. H-ICSBP shares high sequence homology with its murine cognate. The 
derived sequence of H-ICSBP reveals restricted homology within the first 120 
amino acids to three other interferon regulatory factors, IRF-1, IRF-2, and 
ISGF3 gamma. Truncated ICSBP lacking the first 33 amino-terminal amino acids 
fails to bind to the ICS, indicating that at least part of the DNA binding 
domain is located within the well conserved amino terminus. H-ICSBP is expressed 
exclusively in cell lines of hematopoietic origin. The results of transient 
transfection assays carried out either in hematopoietic or nonhematopoietic 
cells suggest that ICSBP acts as a negative regulatory factor on ICS-containing 
promoters. Furthermore, either interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or IFN-beta can 
alleviate the repression mediated by ICSBP. Therefore, ICSBP may be involved in 
maintaining submaximal transcriptional activity of IFN-inducible genes in 
hematopoietic cells. IFN treatment would then alleviate repression allowing 
maximal transcriptional activity of these genes.
