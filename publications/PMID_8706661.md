The mouse mAb 6C6, raised against a plasma-membrane preparation from human 
breast-cancer cells, reacts with an antigen that appears to be overexpressed in 
human breast cancers and other human tumors. Here we describe the cDNA cloning 
and characterization of the antigen recognized by the 6C6 mAb. The isolated cDNA 
clone encodes a protein of 246 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 
27 991 Da. The protein contains three amino-terminal hydrophobic regions, which 
could represent transmembrane domains, and a hydrophilic carboxy-terminal 
region, which we show to be extracellular. The identity of the protein encoded 
by the cloned cDNA as the 6C6 antigen was confirmed by in vitro translation and 
immunoprecipitation experiments, and by transfection into cell lines that do not 
react with the 6C6 mAb, which resulted in the expression of a 28-kDa surface 
protein that was recognized by the antibody. The 6C6 antigen appears to be a 
type II transmembrane protein, with multiple membrane-spanning domains and a 
long extracellular non-glycosylated carboxy-terminal domain, to which the 6C6 
epitope has been mapped. The overall structure of the protein and weak amino 
acid similarities with a family of multiple-transmembrane-spanning-domain 
proteins that includes some antigens (such as L6, CD63/ME491 and CO-029) that 
are overexpressed in tumor cells, suggest that the 6C6 antigen may belong to 
this family of proteins.
