Phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes of 15 kDa (PEA-15) is known to sequester 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the cytoplasm, inhibiting 
tumorigenesis of human breast cancer cells. Here, we describe how PEA-15 
expression affects the dephosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) through endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) contacts in 
MDA-MB-468, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. The increased 
intracellular calcium concentration resulting from increased cytoplasmic 
phosphorylated ERK facilitates movement of ER-anchored calcium sensors to the 
PM. The driving force of trans-localization of calcium-dependent proteins 
enhances the contact between the activated EGFR and ER-localized phosphatase, 
PTP1B. Consequently, our findings suggest a mechanism underneath the 
facilitation of EGFR dephosphorylation by cytoplasmic PEA-15 expression inside 
TNBC cells, which may be one of the dynamic mechanisms for down-regulation of 
activated EGFR in cancer cells.
