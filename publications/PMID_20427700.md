BACKGROUND: The recently developed and internally validated Health ABC HF model 
uses 9 routinely available clinical variables to determine incident heart 
failure risk. In this study, we sought to externally validate the Health ABC HF 
model.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Observed 5-year incidence of heart failure, defined as 
first hospitalization for new-onset heart failure, was compared with 5-year risk 
estimates derived from the Health ABC HF model among participants without heart 
failure at baseline in the Cardiovascular Health Study. During follow-up, 400 of 
5335 (7.5%) participants developed heart failure over 5 years versus 364 (6.8%) 
predicted by the Health ABC HF model (predicted-to-observed ratio, 0.90). 
Observed versus predicted 5-year heart failure probabilities were 3.2% versus 
2.8%, 9.0% versus 7.0%, 15.9% versus 13.7%, and 24.6% versus 30.8% for the <5%, 
5% to 10%, 10% to 20%, and >20% 5-year risk categories, respectively. The 
Hosmer-Lemeshow chi(2) was 14.72 (degrees of freedom, 10; P=0.14), and the C 
index was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.76). Calibration and discrimination 
demonstrated adequate performance across sex and race overall; however, risk was 
underestimated in white men, especially in the 5% to 10% risk category. Model 
performance was optimal when participants with normal left ventricular function 
at baseline were assessed separately. Performance was consistent across age 
groups. Analyses with death as a competing risk yielded similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: The Health ABC HF model adequately predicted 5-year heart failure 
risk in a large community-based study, providing support for the external 
validity of the model. This tool may be used to identify individuals to whom to 
target heart failure prevention efforts.
