In vascular endothelial cells, tetrahydrobiopterin serves as an essential 
cofactor required for enzymatic activity of nitric oxide synthase. GTP 
cyclohydrolase I is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of 
tetrahydrobiopterin. Previous studies have demonstrated that proinflammatory 
cytokines stimulate production of tetrahydrobiopterin in endothelial cells. 
Long-term regulation of GTP cyclohydrolase I gene expression in endothelium has 
not been studied. The present study was designed to determine whether the 
cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (INF-gamma), 
and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) stimulate tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis by 
increasing expression of GTP cyclohydrolase I mRNA in endothelial cells. The 
relative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify 
expression of GTP cyclohydrolase I mRNA in cultured human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells. Nuclear run-on assay was performed to determine the 
transcription rate of GTP cyclohydrolase I gene. GTP cyclohydrolase I enzymatic 
activity and production of tetrahydrobiopterin were measured in cell extracts. 
After incubation with TNF-alpha (2 microg/mL), INF-gamma (200 U/mL), and 
IL-1beta (5 U/mL) for 24 hours, significantly increased expression of GTP 
cyclohydrolase I mRNA was detected. Cytokines increased the transcription rate 
of GTP cyclohydrolase I 3.6-fold. This increase was associated with increased 
GTP cyclohydrolase I enzymatic activity and elevation of intracellular levels of 
tetrahydrobiopterin. An RNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D (2 microg/mL), 
inhibited cytokine-induced expression of GTP cyclohydrolase I gene. A protein 
synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (0.5 microg/mL), did not affect expression of 
GTP cyclohydrolase I mRNA but blocked the increase in enzyme activity, as well 
as production of tetrahydrobiopterin. Incubation of endothelial cells for 24 
hours in the presence of 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (10[-3] 
mol/L) did not affect expression of GTP cyclohydrolase I mRNA. These results 
demonstrate that in vascular endothelial cells, cytokines increase production of 
tetrahydrobiopterin by stimulating expression of GTP cyclohydrolase I gene. This 
effect is apparently due to increased transcription rather than stabilization of 
mRNA. Regulation of GTP cyclohydrolase I gene expression by cytokines may play 
an important role in control of endothelial nitric oxide synthesis.
