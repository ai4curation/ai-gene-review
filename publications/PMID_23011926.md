Archaeal and eukaryotic cytosols contain group II chaperonins, which have a 
double-barrel structure and fold proteins inside a cavity in an ATP-dependent 
manner. The most complex of the chaperonins, the eukaryotic TCP-1 ring complex 
(TRiC), has eight different subunits, chaperone containing TCP-1 (CCT1-8), that 
are arranged so that there is one of each subunit per ring. Aspects of the 
structure and function of the bovine and yeast TRiC have been characterized, but 
studies of human TRiC have been limited. We have isolated and purified 
endogenous human TRiC from HeLa suspension cells. This purified human TRiC 
contained all eight CCT subunits organized into double-barrel rings, consistent 
with what has been found for bovine and yeast TRiC. The purified human TRiC is 
active as demonstrated by the luciferase refolding assay. As a more stringent 
test, the ability of human TRiC to suppress the aggregation of human 
γD-crystallin was examined. In addition to suppressing off-pathway aggregation, 
TRiC was able to assist the refolding of the crystallin molecules, an activity 
not found with the lens chaperone, α-crystallin. Additionally, we show that 
human TRiC from HeLa cell lysate is associated with the heat shock protein 70 
and heat shock protein 90 chaperones. Purification of human endogenous TRiC from 
HeLa cells will enable further characterization of this key chaperonin, required 
for the reproduction of all human cells.

Introduction

Molecular chaperones in the cell guide nascent and misfolded proteins to their native states and protect misfolded proteins from aggregation. The three main ATP-dependent chaperone classes that assist in folding proteins are heat shock protein 70 and 90 (Hsp70 and Hsp90) and chaperonin (Hartl et al. 2011 ). These broad chaperone classes may function in pathways by transferring proteins that cannot be sufficiently folded from one chaperone to another (Frydman et al. 1994 ; Hartl et al. 2011 ). Hsp70 chaperones bind to nascent proteins immediately after exiting the ribosome, while Hsp90 chaperones assist their client proteins at the end of the folding process (Hartl et al. 2011 ). The most complex of the ATP-dependent chaperones, the chaperonins, fold substrates in a cavity within the chaperonin where the substrate is sequestered, in whole or in part, away from the environment of the cell (Thulasiraman et al. 1999 ; Tang et al. 2006 ).

Chaperonin ATPases are composed of two back-to-back rings with seven to nine subunits each (Horwich et al. 2007 ). Each subunit has three domains: the apical domain that recognizes substrates, the equatorial domain that contains the ATP-binding site and facilitates subunit–subunit contacts, and the intermediate domain that acts as a hinge region between the two other domains (Braig et al. 1994 ; Spiess et al. 2004 ). Chaperonins are divided into two groups: group I (found in prokaryotes and in the chloroplasts and mitochondria of eukaryotes) and group II (found in the Archaeal and eukaryotic cytosol) (Hartl et al. 2011 ). The Archaeal group II chaperonins consist of two seven to nine subunit rings that have one to three different subunits (Bigotti and Clarke 2008 ), while the eukaryotic group II chaperonin TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC) consists of two identical rings, each with eight different chaperone containing TCP-1 (CCT) subunits (Cong et al. 2010 ).

TRiC was first identified in rabbit reticulocytes when it was found that newly made tubulin subunits entered a 900-kDa complex before becoming competent to assemble into microtubules (Yaffe et al. 1992 ). This complex consisted of a set of polypeptides between 55 and 60 kDa; one of which was recognized by the TCP-1 antibody (Yaffe et al. 1992 ). Concurrently, preliminary characterization of human and mouse TCP-1 found that in both species TCP-1 made a complex of approximately 900 kDa and that TCP-1 associated with four to six unidentified polypeptides and two Hsp70 homologs (Lewis et al. 1992 ). Another simultaneous study showed that TRiC was capable of binding and folding proteins to their native states (Frydman et al. 1992 ). Structures of TRiC with tubulin and actin have since been resolved and showed that TRiC recognizes and binds these essential protein substrates that first led to its discovery (Hynes and Willison 2000 ; Llorca et al. 2001 ; Muñoz et al. 2011 ; Neirynck et al. 2006 ).

TRiC does not only bind actin and tubulin; Thulasiraman et al. demonstrated that TRiC binds 9–15 % of newly synthesized proteins in [ 35 S]-methionine pulse labeled baby hamster kidney cells (Thulasiraman et al. 1999 ). The mechanism and high-resolution structure of group II chaperonins has been elucidated using the archaeal chaperonin of Methanococcus maripauldis , Mm-Cpn (Douglas et al. 2011 ; Pereira et al. 2012 , 2010 ; Zhang et al. 2010 ). Due to the increased complexity of TRiC, much of the structural and biochemical research on group II chaperonins has been carried out with less complex archaeal chaperonins, such as Mm-Cpn.

The most common preparation of TRiC for biomedical research is endogenous TRiC from bovine testes tissue (Feldman et al. 2003 ; Ferreyra and Frydman 2000 ; Frydman et al. 1992 ). Purification of endogenous TRiC from rabbit reticulocytes has also been effective (Frydman et al. 1994 ; Gao et al. 1992 ; Nimmesgern and Hartl 1993 ; Norcum 1996 ). More recently, purification of exogenously tagged yeast TRiC in yeast has been developed (Dekker et al. 2011 ; Pappenberger et al. 2006 ), along with purification of endogenous yeast TRiC by exogenously tagging an interacting protein (Leitner et al. 2012 ). Co-expression of all eight human CCT subunits in baby hamster kidney cells has been attempted but resulted in very low yields (Machida et al. 2012 ). While these purifications have increased the opportunities to study TRiC, characterization of human TRiC has been lacking.

Investigations of the arrangement of the CCT subunits in TRiC purified from different species have given conflicting results (Cong et al. 2010 ; Dekker et al. 2011 ). However, a recent novel mass spectrometry method established that bovine TRiC purified from testes tissue and yeast TRiC purified via an interacting protein had the same arrangement with CCT2 and CCT6 forming the homotypic contacts (Leitner et al. 2012 ). This does not rule out that other CCT subunit arrangements of TRiC may exist, especially in different tissues and at different developmental stages. Previous research has shown that TRiC complexes containing specific subunits may have different roles (Roobol et al. 1995 ) and even that the CCT subunits may have functions in the cell independent of the TRiC complex (Roobol and Carden 1999 ).

The largest divergence of sequence among the CCT subunits is in the apical substrate–recognition domain, suggesting that the different subunits of TRiC may have evolved distinctive subunit specificities (Frydman 2001 ; Kim et al. 1994 ; Spiess et al. 2006 ). Although only a few substrates have been studied, it is clear that not all CCT subunits are involved in binding of non-native-state substrates to TRiC (Feldman et al. 2003 ; Hynes and Willison 2000 ; Llorca et al. 2001 ; Spiess et al. 2006 ). The apical domains of CCT1 and CCT4 have been implicated in TRiC binding to exon one of the huntingtin protein (Tam et al. 2006 ). Spiess et al. demonstrated that TRiC subunits CCT1 and CCT7 bind the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) (Spiess et al. 2006 ). While these studies show that not all CCT subunits are required to bind a substrate to TRiC, we cannot firmly conclude whether only specific CCT subunits can bind particular substrates.

While there is emerging understanding of the CCT subunit arrangement and the recognition of substrates by specific CCT subunits, there has been little study on the assembly of TRiC from the CCT subunits. With the eight CCT subunits expressed from seven different genes, the assembly of TRiC must be very finely regulated (Kubota et al. 1999 ). This regulation may mean that the TRiC rings can contain a different arrangement and ratio of CCT subunits at some point in their lifetime. To investigate whether human TRiC found in epithelial cells is the same as bovine TRiC from testes tissue, we purified endogenous TRiC from an epithelial cell derivative line. HeLa cells have previously been shown to express all eight CCT proteins at high levels (Fountoulakis et al. 2004 ), making this an appropriate cell line for endogenous TRiC purification. For consistency, the new nomenclature of Hsp70, α-crystallin, Hsp90, and the chaperonins GroE/TRiC is HSPA, HSPB4, HSPC, and HSPD/CCT, respectively, but the older names have been used herein (Kampinga et al. 2009 ).

Results

The first step in purifying endogenous human TRiC from HeLa cells was separating the cytoplasmic fraction of the cells from the nuclei because TRiC is a cytoplasmic chaperonin. This was accomplished using a HeLa nuclear extraction protocol (Tran et al. 2001 ) and verified by immunoblots probed with the CCT1 primary antibody (Fig. 1 ). Next, a series of ammonium sulfate cuts further purified TRiC from other HeLa proteins. The resuspended pellet was passed over three chromatography columns: anion exchange (Q sepharose)-, heparin-affinity-, and Superose-6 size exclusion chromatography. The elution peak from the size exclusion column was between 12 and 14.5 mL (Fig. 2 ). This was consistent with other TRiC purifications and the purification of Mm-Cpn (Frydman et al. 1994 ; Reissmann et al. 2007 ). The average yield of this purification from a 100 g HeLa cell pellet was 5 mg of purified human TRiC with ~90 % purity (Fig. 3a ).

All eight CCT subunits were present in the purified human TRiC sample as seen by immunoblots probed with antibodies against each of the eight subunits (Fig. 3b ). They were all present in roughly equal stoichiometry. By negative stain TEM, purified human TRiC appeared as two back-to-back rings approximately 185 Å in height and 165 Å in diameter (Fig. 4 ). The morphology of purified human TRiC was consistent with that of purified TRiC reported in the literature (Cong et al. 2010 ; Dekker et al. 2011 ).

When heparin-affinity chromatography was omitted from the purification, Hsp70/Hsc70 and Hsp90 co-purified with human TRiC (Fig. 5 ). This interaction may be due to human TRiC binding to Hsp70/Hsc70 and Hsp90 in HeLa cells, while exchanging substrates between the chaperones. When heparin-affinity chromatography was utilized, Hsp70/Hsc70 and Hsp90 were not seen in the purified human TRiC sample, demonstrating that while this interaction was quite robust, it could be eliminated.

Human TRiC purified from HeLa cells was active in the luciferase refolding assay, which has been previously used to test activity of TRiC purified from bovine testes (Frydman et al. 1992 ) and rabbit reticulocytes (Frydman et al. 1994 ; Nimmesgern and Hartl 1993 ). In the assay, luciferase was unfolded and then diluted into buffer with purified human TRiC (Thulasiraman et al. 2000 ). The presence of refolded luciferase in the mixture was assayed by addition of luciferin and subsequent luminescence production monitoring. Purified human TRiC refolded luciferase for over 2 h at room temperature (Fig. 6 ).

Though luciferase has frequently been used to assay the refolding activity of a variety of chaperonins, it is not an authentic substrate for human TRiC. A human protein whose folding and competing aggregation has been systematically studied is human γD-crystallin (HγD-Crys) (Flaugh et al. 2005 ; Kosinski-Collins and King 2003 ). TRiC is almost certainly present in lens epithelium cells and primary lens fibers (Hoehenwarter et al. 2008 ). In characterizing the activity of the archaeal chaperonin Mm-Cpn, Knee et al. found that Mm-Cpn not only suppressed the aggregation of HγD-Crys but also enhanced its refolding in vitro (2011). The major lens chaperone, α-crystallin, suppresses HγD-Crys aggregation in vitro but does not refold the molecules (Acosta-Sampson and King 2010 ; Moreau and King 2012a ).

Therefore, we decided to assess whether human TRiC was active with respect to the HγD-Crys substrate. In this assay, when unfolded HγD-Crys was diluted from denaturant into buffer at concentrations of 50 μg/mL, partially folded intermediates partitioned between productive refolding and off-pathway aggregation. This aggregation was monitored by sample turbidity. When purified human TRiC was added to the buffer, aggregation was significantly suppressed (Fig. 7a ). Furthermore, native-like HγD-Crys could be detected when the filtered sample was assessed on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7b ), suggesting that HγD-Crys was refolded by human TRiC.

In summary, human TRiC was purified from HeLa cells by first extracting the cytoplasmic layer of the cells and then performing three chromatography steps. The purified material contained all eight CCT subunits in approximately equal ratios. TRiC could be effectively separated from other chaperones in the cells by heparin-affinity chromatography. Purified human TRiC possessed the back-to-back ring morphology that defines the structure of chaperonins. Our purified human TRiC was not only active in refolding the model substrate luciferase but also suppressed the aggregation and refolded the authentic substrate HγD-Crys.

Discussion

While TRiC has been readily purified endogenously from bovine testes (Frydman et al. 1992 ; Leitner et al. 2012 ) and pseudo-exogenously from yeast (Leitner et al. 2012 ; Pappenberger et al. 2006 ), purification of human TRiC has been limited. Expression of all eight subunits exogenously from the cloned genes is difficult. The direct approach of growing a large amount of human epithelial cells and purifying endogenous TRiC has been successful in producing the authentic human chaperonin.

Molecular chaperones have been proposed to be therapeutic targets (Almeida et al. 2011 ). TRiC may play a role in suppressing Huntington's disease by decreasing huntingtin aggregate formation (Kitamura et al. 2006 ; Tam et al. 2009 ). If TRiC is to be used therapeutically in the clinic, it will be necessary to study human TRiC to further understand chaperonin functions inside human cells. While the TRiC isolated from bovine testes may be similar overall to the human version, there are differences in all eight subunits between bovine and human TRiC, let alone any type of arrangement or assembly differences.

Human TRiC activity in assisting the refolding of firefly luciferase corresponds to activities reported for other mammalian TRiC complexes (Frydman et al. 1992 , 1994 ; Nimmesgern and Hartl 1993 ). The lens crystallins represent a more rigorous test for the activity of human TRiC. The lens crystallins must remain stable and folded throughout life for the aggregated state results in the lens disease cataract (Moreau and King 2012b ). The α-crystallin chaperone present at high concentrations in the lens suppresses the aggregation of HγD-Crys but cannot refold it (Acosta-Sampson and King 2010 ; Evans et al. 2008 ; Horwitz 1992 ). The results showed that human TRiC both suppressed the aggregation of partially folded HγD-Crys and, in the presence of ATP, was able to refold the chains. Human TRiC may in fact play a role in protecting the lens fibers from cortical cataract (Mitchell et al. 1997 ).

We found that Hsp70 and Hsp90 remained bound to purified human TRiC if one of the chromatography steps is omitted. This is not surprising since TRiC co-purifies with Hsp70 and Hsp90 in rabbit reticulocytes (Frydman et al. 1994 ; Nimmesgern and Hartl 1993 ). However, while the shuttling of substrates between Hsp70 and TRiC has been widely studied (Kabir et al. 2011 ), substrate exchange from TRiC to Hsp90 is much less understood. The substantial amounts of Hsp90 that co-purified with TRiC from HeLa cells may make this a good system for further studying the TRiC-Hsp90 interaction.

Other directions with human TRiC will be to attempt high-resolution structural studies for comparison to yeast and bovine TRiC. The arrangement of human TRiC purified from HeLa cells may be different than that of bovine TRiC purified from testes, not only because of the differences in species as mentioned above but also due to differences between the tissue and the cells in culture. Furthermore, it will be interesting to see whether purified human TRiC can refold actin and tubulin, the two largest substrates of TRiC, as efficiently as bovine TRiC. We plan to study whether each CCT subunit is needed to recognize and refold particular substrates, such as actin and tubulin.

It has been postulated that the eight different CCT subunits of TRiC are needed to recognize a variety of substrates (Feldman et al. 2003 ; Llorca et al. 2001 ). The CCT subunits may recognize different types of proteins, e.g., CCT2 may recognize beta-propeller proteins, while CCT8 may recognize hydrophobic beta sheets. Even more specifically, the CCT subunits may recognize different proteins, e.g., CCT1 may bind huntingtin (Tam et al. 2006 ) while CCT7 recognizes pVHL (Spiess et al. 2006 ). However, with our limited knowledge on the substrate recognition of TRiC, it is unknown if different CCT subunits specifically or redundantly recognize these various substrates. It may be that while CCT1 recognizes huntingtin with the highest efficiency, CCT4 or CCT7 can bind it when CCT1 is not present or defective.

The arrangement of TRiC has been determined for TRiC purified from bovine testes and from yeast, but it is unknown how this arrangement varies among tissues or at different developmental stages. Also unknown is how TRiC can assemble into this arrangement. As with other large complexes, it is likely that a highly regulated sequence of events is needed for the final arrangement. Chaperonin-like Biedel–Bradet Syndrome subunits assemble into the final BBSome complex by sequential addition of each subunit (Zhang et al. 2012 ). Such sequential assembly is possible for TRiC as well. Our purified TRiC material is an initial step in furthering the knowledge on this crucial human chaperonin.
