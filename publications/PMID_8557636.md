Together with the 31-kDa microfibril-associated glycoprotein (MAGP), four 
polypeptides designated MP340 (340 kDa), MP78 (78 kDa), MP70 (70 kDa), and MP25 
(25 kDa) have previously been identified in tissue extracts designed 
specifically to solubilize the microfibrillar component of elastic fibers. In 
the present study, both MP78 and MP70 were shown to be forms of a protein which 
is closely related to the human protein beta ig-h3, and MP340 was confirmed to 
be the bovine form of fibrillin-1. Peptide sequences from MP25 proved to be 
unique, and affinity-purified anti-MP25 antibodies were shown, by 
immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, to localize specifically to 
the elastin-associated microfibrils. This confirmed that MP25 was a distinct 
component of these structures. Expression screening of nuchal ligament cDNA 
libraries yielded a cDNA, cM10A (770 base pairs) which encodes amino acid 
sequences matching those of the MP25 peptides. Further library screening with 
cM10A identified cDNAs which encode the complete primary structures of bovine 
and human MP25. Bovine and human MP25 were found to be around 80% homologous and 
contain 170 and 173 amino acids, respectively. Data base searches revealed that 
MP25 had significant similarity of structure only with MAGP, indicating that the 
two proteins form a new family of microfibrillar proteins. In acknowledgment, 
MP25 has been formally renamed MAGP-2, and MAGP is referred to as MAGP-1. The 
close similarity between the two proteins (57%) is confined to a central region 
of 60 amino acids where there is precise alignment of 7 cysteine residues. 
Elsewhere the MAGP-2 molecule is rich in serine and threonine residues and 
contains an RGD motif. MAGP-2 lacks the proline-, glutamine-, and tyrosine-rich 
sequences and a hydrophobic carboxyl terminus, characteristic of MAGP-1. These 
structural differences suggest that MAGP-2 has some functions which are distinct 
from those of MAGP-1. The locus of the human MAGP-2 gene was identified on 
chromosome 12 in the region of 12p12.3-12p13.1.
