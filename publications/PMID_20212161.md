The mitotic (or spindle assembly) checkpoint system ensures accurate segregation 
of chromosomes by delaying anaphase until all chromosomes are correctly attached 
to the mitotic spindle. This system acts by inhibiting the activity of the 
anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase to target securin 
for degradation. APC/C is inhibited by a mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) 
composed of BubR1, Bub3, Mad2, and Cdc20. The molecular mechanisms of the 
inactivation of the mitotic checkpoint, including the release of APC/C from 
inhibition, remain obscure. It has been reported that polyubiquitylation by the 
APC/C is required for the inactivation of the mitotic checkpoint [Reddy SK, Rape 
M, Margansky WA, Kirschner MW (2007) Nature, 446:921-924]. We confirmed the 
involvement of polyubiquitylation, but found that another process, which 
requires ATP cleavage at the beta-gamma position (as opposed to alpha-beta bond 
scission involved in ubiquitylation), is essential for the release of APC/C from 
checkpoint inhibition. ATP (beta-gamma) cleavage is required both for the 
dissociation of MCC components from APC/C and for the disassembly of free MCC, 
whereas polyubiquitylation is involved only in the former process. We find that 
the requirement for ATP (beta-gamma) cleavage is not due to the involvement of 
the 26S proteasome and that the phenomena observed are not due to sustained 
activity of protein kinase Cdk1/cyclin B, caused by inhibition of the 
degradation of cyclin B. Thus, some other energy-consuming process is needed for 
the inactivation of the mitotic checkpoint.
