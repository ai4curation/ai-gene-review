Plexins are widely expressed transmembrane proteins that, in the nervous system, 
mediate repulsive signals of semaphorins. However, the molecular nature of 
plexin-mediated signal transduction remains poorly understood. Here, we 
demonstrate that plexin-B family members associate through their C termini with 
the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG. Activation of 
plexin-B1 by semaphorin 4D regulates PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG activity leading to RhoA 
activation. In addition, a dominant-negative form of PDZ-RhoGEF blocks 
semaphorin 4D-induced growth cone collapse in primary hippocampal neurons. Our 
study indicates that the interaction of mammalian plexin-B family members with 
the multidomain proteins PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG represents an essential molecular 
link between plexin-B and localized, Rho-mediated downstream signaling events 
which underly various plexin-mediated cellular phenomena including axonal growth 
cone collapse.
