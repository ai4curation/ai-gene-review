The successive events of shedding and regulated intramembrane proteolysis are 
known to comprise a fundamental biological process of type I and II membrane 
proteins (e.g. amyloid precursor protein, Notch receptor and pro-tumor necrosis 
factor-α). Some of the resulting fragments were shown to be involved in 
important intra- and extracellular signalling events. Although shedding of the 
human transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) has been known for > 30 years and soluble 
TfR1 is an accepted diagnostic marker, the fate of the remaining N-terminal 
fragment (NTF) remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate for the 
first time that TfR1-NTF is subject to regulated intramembrane proteolysis and, 
using MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS, we have identified the cleavage site as being located 
C-terminal from Gly-84. We showed that the resulting C-terminal peptide is 
extracellularly released after regulated intramembrane proteolysis and it was 
detected as a monomer with an internal disulfide bridge. We further identified 
signal peptide peptidase-like 2a and mainly signal peptide peptidase-like 2b as 
being responsible for the intramembrane proteolysis of TfR1-NTF.
