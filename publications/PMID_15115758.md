Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a chromosomal instability disorder characterized by 
cellular sensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents and a high risk of 
cancer. Six of the eight proteins encoded by the known FA genes form a nuclear 
complex which is required for the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2 protein. 
FANCD2 complexes and colocalizes with BRCA1, but its presumptive role in DNA 
repair has not yet been clearly defined. We used yeast two-hybrid analysis to 
test for interaction between FANCD2 and 10 proteins involved in homologous 
recombination repair. FANCD2 did not interact with RAD51, the five RAD51 
paralogs, RAD52, RAD54 or DMC1. However, it bound to a highly conserved 
C-terminal site in BRCA2 that also binds FANCG/XRCC9. FANCD2 and BRCA2 can be 
coimmunoprecipitated from cell extracts of both human and Chinese hamster 
wild-type cells, thus confirming that the interaction occurs in vivo. Formation 
of nuclear foci of FANCD2 was normal in the BRCA2 mutant CAPAN-1 cells, which 
indicates that the recruitment of FANCD2 to sites of DNA-repair is independent 
of wild-type BRCA2 function. FANCD2 colocalized with RAD51 in foci following 
treatment with mitomycin C or hydroxyurea, and colocalized very tightly with 
PCNA after treatment with hydroxyurea. These findings suggest that FANCD2 may 
have a role in the cellular response to stalled replication forks or in the 
repair of replication-associated double-strand breaks, irrespective of the type 
of primary DNA lesion.

Fanconi anaemia signalling, a key genomic maintenance pathway, is activated in response to replication stress. Here, we report that phosphorylation of the pivotal pathway protein FANCD2 by CHK1 triggers its FBXL12-dependent proteasomal degradation, facilitating FANCD2 clearance at stalled replication forks. This promotes efficient DNA replication under conditions of CYCLIN E- and drug-induced replication stress. Reconstituting FANCD2-deficient fibroblasts with phosphodegron mutants failed to re-establish fork progression. In the absence of FBXL12, FANCD2 becomes trapped on chromatin leading to replication stress and excessive DNA damage. In human cancers, FBXL12, CYCLIN E, and Fanconi anaemia signalling are positively correlated and FBXL12 upregulation is linked to reduced survival in patients with high CYCLIN E expressing breast tumours. Finally, depletion of FBXL12 exacerbated oncogene-induced replication stress and sensitised cancer cells to drug-induced replication stress by WEE1 inhibition. Collectively, our results indicate that FBXL12 constitutes a vulnerability and a potential therapeutic target in CYCLIN E-overexpressing cancers.

The Fanconi anaemia pathway alleviates oncogene-induced replication stress. Brunner et al. report that the ubiquitin ligase SCFFBXL12 targets the key Fanconi anaemia protein FANCD2 for proteasomal degradation. They demonstrate that this occurs in the vicinity of replication forks and is critical for replication recovery and survival under CDK-driven replication stress.
