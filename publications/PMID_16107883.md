In response to DNA damage, p53 activates a G1 cell cycle checkpoint, in part 
through induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1). Here 
we report the identification of a new direct p53 target, Ptprv (or ESP), 
encoding a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase. Ptprv transcription is 
dramatically and preferentially increased in cultured cells undergoing 
p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, but not in cells undergoing p53-mediated 
apoptosis. This observation was further confirmed in vivo using a Ptprv 
null-reporter mouse line. A p53-responsive element is present in the Ptprv 
promoter and p53 is recruited to this site in vivo. Importantly, while 
p53-dependent apoptosis is intact in mice lacking Ptprv, Ptprv-null fibroblasts 
and epithelial cells of the small intestine are defective in G1 checkpoint 
control. Thus, Ptprv is a new direct p53 target and a key mediator of 
p53-induced cell cycle arrest. Finally, Ptprv loss enhances the formation of 
epidermal papillomas after exposure to chemical carcinogens, suggesting that 
Ptprv acts to suppress tumor formation in vivo.
