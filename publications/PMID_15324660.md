BACKGROUND: 14-3-3 proteins are abundant and conserved polypeptides that mediate 
the cellular effects of basophilic protein kinases through their ability to bind 
specific peptide motifs phosphorylated on serine or threonine.
RESULTS: We have used mass spectrometry to analyze proteins that associate with 
14-3-3 isoforms in HEK293 cells. This identified 170 unique 14-3-3-associated 
proteins, which show only modest overlap with previous 14-3-3 binding partners 
isolated by affinity chromatography. To explore this large set of proteins, we 
developed a domain-based hierarchical clustering technique that distinguishes 
structurally and functionally related subsets of 14-3-3 target proteins. This 
analysis revealed a large group of 14-3-3 binding partners that regulate 
cytoskeletal architecture. Inhibition of 14-3-3 phosphoprotein recognition in 
vivo indicates the general importance of such interactions in cellular 
morphology and membrane dynamics. Using tandem proteomic and biochemical 
approaches, we identify a phospho-dependent 14-3-3 binding site on the A kinase 
anchoring protein (AKAP)-Lbc, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the 
Rho GTPase. 14-3-3 binding to AKAP-Lbc, induced by PKA, suppresses Rho 
activation in vivo.
CONCLUSION: 14-3-3 proteins can potentially engage around 0.6% of the human 
proteome. Domain-based clustering has identified specific subsets of 14-3-3 
targets, including numerous proteins involved in the dynamic control of cell 
architecture. This notion has been validated by the broad inhibition of 14-3-3 
phosphorylation-dependent binding in vivo and by the specific analysis of 
AKAP-Lbc, a RhoGEF that is controlled by its interaction with 14-3-3.
