Sin3a is the central scaffold protein of the prototypical Hdac1/2 chromatin 
repressor complex, crucially required during early embryonic development for the 
growth of pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass. Here, we compare the 
composition of the Sin3a-Hdac complex between pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) 
and differentiated cells by establishing a method that couples two independent 
endogenous immunoprecipitations with quantitative mass spectrometry. We define 
the precise composition of the Sin3a complex in multiple cell types and identify 
the Fam60a subunit as a key defining feature of a variant Sin3a complex present 
in ES cells, which also contains Ogt and Tet1. Fam60a binds on H3K4me3-positive 
promoters in ES cells, together with Ogt, Tet1 and Sin3a, and is essential to 
maintain the complex on chromatin. Finally, we show that depletion of Fam60a 
phenocopies the loss of Sin3a, leading to reduced proliferation, an extended 
G1-phase and the deregulation of lineage genes. Taken together, Fam60a is an 
essential core subunit of a variant Sin3a complex in ES cells that is required 
to promote rapid proliferation and prevent unscheduled differentiation.
