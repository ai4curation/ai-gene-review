The biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) proteins in eukaryotes is a complex process 
involving more than 20 components. So far, functional investigations have mainly 
been performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we have analyzed the role of 
the human cysteine desulfurase Nfs1 (huNfs1), which serves as a sulfur donor in 
biogenesis. The protein is located predominantly in mitochondria, but small 
amounts are present in the cytosol/nucleus. huNfs1 was depleted efficiently in 
HeLa cells by a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach, resulting in a drastic 
growth retardation and striking morphological changes of mitochondria. The 
activities of both mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe/S proteins were strongly 
impaired, demonstrating that huNfs1 performs an essential function in Fe/S 
protein biogenesis in human cells. Expression of murine Nfs1 (muNfs1) in 
huNfs1-depleted cells restored both growth and Fe/S protein activities to 
wild-type levels, indicating the specificity of the siRNA depletion approach. No 
complementation of the growth retardation was observed, when muNfs1 was 
synthesized without its mitochondrial presequence. This extramitochondrial 
muNfs1 did not support maintenance of Fe/S protein activities, neither in the 
cytosol nor in mitochondria. In conclusion, our study shows that the essential 
huNfs1 is required inside mitochondria for efficient maturation of cellular Fe/S 
proteins. The results have implications for the regulation of iron homeostasis 
by cytosolic iron regulatory protein 1.
