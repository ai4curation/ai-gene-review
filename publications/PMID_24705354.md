HIP14 is the most highly conserved of 23 human palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) 
that catalyze the post-translational addition of palmitate to proteins, 
including huntingtin (HTT). HIP14 is dysfunctional in the presence of mutant HTT 
(mHTT), the causative gene for Huntington disease (HD), and we hypothesize that 
reduced palmitoylation of HTT and other HIP14 substrates contributes to the 
pathogenesis of the disease. Here we describe the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) 
interactors of HIP14 in the first comprehensive study of interactors of a 
mammalian PAT. Unexpectedly, we discovered a highly significant overlap between 
HIP14 interactors and 370 published interactors of HTT, 4-fold greater than for 
control proteins (P = 8 × 10(-5)). Nearly half of the 36 shared interactors are 
already implicated in HD, supporting a direct link between HIP14 and the 
disease. The HIP14 Y2H interaction set is significantly enriched for 
palmitoylated proteins that are candidate substrates. We confirmed that three of 
them, GPM6A, and the Sprouty domain-containing proteins SPRED1 and SPRED3, are 
indeed palmitoylated by HIP14; the first enzyme known to palmitoylate these 
proteins. These novel substrates functions might be affected by reduced 
palmitoylation in HD. We also show that the vesicular cargo adapter optineurin, 
an established HTT-binding protein, co-immunoprecipitates with HIP14 but is not 
palmitoylated. mHTT leads to mislocalization of optineurin and aberrant cargo 
trafficking. Therefore, it is possible that optineurin regulates trafficking of 
HIP14 to its substrates. Taken together, our data raise the possibility that 
defective palmitoylation by HIP14 might be an important mechanism that 
contributes to the pathogenesis of HD.

Abstract

HIP14 is the most highly conserved of 23 human palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) that catalyze the post-translational addition of palmitate to proteins, including huntingtin (HTT). HIP14 is dysfunctional in the presence of mutant HTT (mHTT), the causative gene for Huntington disease (HD), and we hypothesize that reduced palmitoylation of HTT and other HIP14 substrates contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease. Here we describe the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) interactors of HIP14 in the first comprehensive study of interactors of a mammalian PAT. Unexpectedly, we discovered a highly significant overlap between HIP14 interactors and 370 published interactors of HTT, 4-fold greater than for control proteins ( P = 8 × 10 −5 ). Nearly half of the 36 shared interactors are already implicated in HD, supporting a direct link between HIP14 and the disease. The HIP14 Y2H interaction set is significantly enriched for palmitoylated proteins that are candidate substrates. We confirmed that three of them, GPM6A, and the Sprouty domain-containing proteins SPRED1 and SPRED3, are indeed palmitoylated by HIP14; the first enzyme known to palmitoylate these proteins. These novel substrates functions might be affected by reduced palmitoylation in HD. We also show that the vesicular cargo adapter optineurin, an established HTT-binding protein, co-immunoprecipitates with HIP14 but is not palmitoylated. mHTT leads to mislocalization of optineurin and aberrant cargo trafficking. Therefore, it is possible that optineurin regulates trafficking of HIP14 to its substrates. Taken together, our data raise the possibility that defective palmitoylation by HIP14 might be an important mechanism that contributes to the pathogenesis of HD.

INTRODUCTION

Huntington disease (HD) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin ( HTT ) gene, resulting in loss of motor control and severe cognitive and psychiatric disturbances ( 1 ). HTT is a scaffold protein that is involved in hundreds of interactions ( 2 – 6 ). One of these is with Huntingtin Interacting Protein 14 (HIP14, or ZDHHC17), a highly conserved palmitoyl acyltransferase (PAT) ( 7 , 8 ) that was first discovered in a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen for proteins that interact with HTT ( 8 , 9 ). HIP14 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HD through multiple lines of evidence and aberrant palmitoylation contributes to the pathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric diseases in addition to HD (reviewed in ( 7 )).

HIP14 and HTT co-localize in the medium spiny neurons of the striatum in mice, the most severely affected and earliest target of neurodegeneration in HD ( 8 , 10 , 11 ). HIP14 modifies HTT post-translationally by adding the fatty acid palmitate to internal cysteine residues, primarily at Cys214, in a process known as palmitoylation, influencing trafficking and aggregation of HTT ( 12 – 14 ). Any process underlying the pathogenesis of HD should be altered in the presence of the causative mutation ( mHTT ). Indeed HTT's interaction with and palmitoylation by HIP14 are reduced in the presence of mHTT in vitro and in vivo ( 8 , 12 , 15 ). When mHTT is rendered palmitoylation-resistant (C214S-HTT-128Q), inclusion formation and toxicity are enhanced in neurons compared with those expressing fully palmitoylatable mHTT (HTT-128Q) ( 13 ).

In fact, the functions of HIP14 and HTT are interdependent. The activity of a PAT is dependent on palmitoylation of the PAT itself ( 16 ) and the palmitoylation of HIP14 is highly correlated with levels of wild-type HTT (wtHTT) ( 12 ). wtHTT promotes palmitoylation of the HIP14 substrate SNAP25 in vitro and loss of wtHTT leads to reduced palmitoylation of SNAP25 and GluR1 in vivo ( 12 ). HIP14's PAT activity is also altered in the presence of mHTT, with HIP14 isolated from brains of the YAC128 mouse model of HD ( 17 ) having a reduced ability to palmitoylate SNAP25 ( 15 ). Thus, HIP14 palmitoylation of HTT influences HTT function, and HTT modulates HIP14's activity toward its substrates.

HIP14 is the most highly conserved of 23 mammalian PATs ( 7 ) suggesting it has significant functional importance. There are 13 known substrates and three additional known interactors of HIP14 in mammals ( Supplementary Material, Table S1 ). HIP14 palmitoylates and/or interacts with proteins involved in neurotransmission and neuronal development ( 14 , 15 , 18 – 24 ) as well as with proteins involved in signal transduction ( 24 – 27 ) and transcriptional regulation ( 28 ). Proper palmitoylation is critical for trafficking and membrane localization of many neuronal proteins and has roles in neuronal development and in synaptic transmission and plasticity ( 29 ). Hip14 -deficient mice recapitulate some cardinal features of HD, such as reduced striatal volume and neuronal number, and motor deficits ( 15 ). We hypothesize that HIP14 dysfunction contributes to the phenotype in HD through a direct effect on HTT functions as well as an indirect effect of the reduced ability of HIP14 to palmitoylate key substrates, resulting in their mislocalization and altered function.

Here we report the first comprehensive study of interactors of a mammalian PAT. Our most surprising finding was that a significantly high proportion of known HTT interactors also interact with HIP14 and nearly half of the 36 shared interactors have previously been implicated in HD. The evidence presented here underlines the extensive functional connection between HIP14 and HD and highlights potential mechanisms for how an altered HIP14–HTT interaction and altered palmitoylation of HTT and other HIP14 substrates might contribute to the pathogenesis of HD. All protein interactions have been submitted to the IMEx Consortium ( http://www.imexconsortium.org ) through IntAct ( 30 ) and assigned the identifier IM- 21827.

DISCUSSION

Understanding the scope of HIP14's contribution to the pathogenesis of HD will require the identification of the full range of proteins that interact with HIP14. Prior to this study, HIP14 was known to have 16 substrates and interactors and our results increase this total number to 229. Figure 7 summarizes our expanded knowledge of HIP14-interacting proteins.

CONCLUSIONS

The HIP14 Y2H study described here, the first for a mammalian PAT, revealed a striking and specific overlap between interactors of HIP14 and HTT. Nearly half of the HIP14-HTT shared interactors, including GPM6A and optineurin, are implicated in HD, providing a further molecular rationale for the similarities between phenotypes of Hip14 −/− mice and the YAC128 mouse model of HD. The confirmed interaction between HIP14 and optineurin reveals a potential mechanism of HIP14 regulation that in the presence of mHTT might lead to reduced substrate palmitoylation. Taken together, our data suggest involvement of multiple candidate HIP14 substrates and regulators in HD, highlighting the significance of palmitoylation by HIP14 as a key contributor to pathogenesis of the disease.
