Circadian clocks regulate many molecular and physiological processes in 
Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), allowing the timing of these processes to 
occur at the most appropriate time of the day in a 24-h period. The accuracy of 
timing relies on the synchrony of the clock and the environmental day/night 
cycle. Visible light is the most potent signal for such synchronization, but 
light-induced responses are also rhythmically attenuated (gated) by the clock. 
Here, we report a similar mutual interaction of the circadian clock and 
non-damaging photomorphogenic UV-B light. We show that low-intensity UV-B 
radiation acts as entraining signal for the clock. UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) 
and CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) are required, but ELONGATED 
HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) and HY5 HOMOLOG (HYH) are dispensable for this process. UV-B 
responsiveness of clock gene expression suggests that photomorphogenic UV-B 
entrains the plant clock through transcriptional activation. We also demonstrate 
that UV-B induction of gene expression under these conditions is gated by the 
clock in a HY5/HYH-independent manner. The arrhythmic early flowering 3-4 mutant 
showed non-gated, high-level gene induction by UV-B, yet displayed no increased 
tolerance to UV-B stress. Thus, the temporal restriction of UV-B responsiveness 
by the circadian clock can be considered as saving resources during acclimation 
without losing fitness.
