IL-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of the IL-12p40 "soluble receptor" 
subunit and a novel cytokine-like subunit related to IL-12p35, termed p19. Human 
and mouse IL-23 exhibit some activities similar to IL-12, but differ in their 
capacities to stimulate particular populations of memory T cells. Like IL-12, 
IL-23 binds to the IL-12R subunit IL-12Rbeta1. However, it does not use 
IL-12Rbeta2. In this study, we identify a novel member of the hemopoietin 
receptor family as a subunit of the receptor for IL-23, "IL-23R." IL-23R pairs 
with IL-12Rbeta1 to confer IL-23 responsiveness on cells expressing both 
subunits. Human IL-23, but not IL-12, exhibits detectable affinity for human 
IL-23R. Anti-IL-12Rbeta1 and anti-IL-23R Abs block IL-23 responses of an NK cell 
line and Ba/F3 cells expressing the two receptor chains. IL-23 activates the 
same Jak-stat signaling molecules as IL-12: Jak2, Tyk2, and stat1, -3, -4, and 
-5, but stat4 activation is substantially weaker and different DNA-binding stat 
complexes form in response to IL-23 compared with IL-12. IL-23R associates 
constitutively with Jak2 and in a ligand-dependent manner with stat3. The 
ability of cells to respond to IL-23 or IL-12 correlates with expression of 
IL-23R or IL-12Rbeta2, respectively. The human IL-23R gene is on human 
chromosome 1 within 150 kb of IL-12Rbeta2.
