EGR2 plays a key role in the PTEN-induced apoptotic pathway. Using 
adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to 39 cancer cell lines, we found that EGR2 
could induce apoptosis in a large proportion of these lines by altering the 
permeability of mitochondrial membranes, releasing cytochrome c and activating 
caspase-3, -8, and -9. Analysis by cDNA microarray and subsequent functional 
studies revealed that EGR2 directly transactivates expression of BNIP3L and BAK. 
Our results helped to clarify the molecular mechanism of the apoptotic pathway 
induced by PTEN-EGR2, and suggested that EGR2 may be an excellent target 
molecule for gene therapy to treat a variety of cancers.
