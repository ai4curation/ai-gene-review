The effector arm of the cell-death pathway is composed of cysteine proteases 
belonging to the ICE/CED-3 family. In metazoan cells these exist as inactive 
polypeptide precursors (zymogens), each composed of a prodomain, which is 
cleaved to activate the protease, and a large and small catalytic subunit. The 
coupling of these 'death' proteases to signalling pathways is probably mediated 
by adaptor molecules that contain protein-protein interaction motifs such as the 
death domain. Here we describe such an adaptor molecule, RAIDD, which has an 
unusual bipartite architecture comprising a carboxy-terminal death domain that 
binds to the homologous domain in RIP, a serine/threonine kinase component of 
the death pathway. The amino-terminal domain is surprisingly homologous with the 
sequence of the prodomain of two ICE/CED-3 family members, human ICH-1 (ref. 5) 
and Caenorhabditis elegans CED-3 (ref. 6). This similar region mediates the 
binding of RAIDD to ICH-1 and CED-3, serving as a direct link to the death 
proteases, indicating that the prodomain may, through homophilic interactions, 
determine the specificity of binding of ICE/CED-3 zymogens to regulatory adaptor 
molecules. Finally, alternations in the sequence of the N-terminal domain that 
are equivalent to inactivating mutations in the C. elegans ced-3 gene prevent 
homophilic binding, highlighting the potentially primordial nature of this 
interaction.
