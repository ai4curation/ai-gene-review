Fbs1 is an F-box protein present abundantly in the nervous system. Similar to 
the ubiquitously expressed Fbs2, Fbs1 recognizes N-glycans at the innermost 
position as a signal for unfolded glycoproteins, probably in the endoplasmic 
reticulum-associated degradation pathway. Here, we show that the in vivo 
majority of Fbs1 is present as Fbs1-Skp1 heterodimers or Fbs1 monomers but not 
SCF(Fbs1) complex. The inefficient SCF complex formation of Fbs1 and the 
restricted presence of SCF(Fbs1) bound on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane 
were due to the short linker sequence between the F-box domain and the 
sugar-binding domain. In vitro, Fbs1 prevented the aggregation of the 
glycoprotein through the N-terminal unique sequence of Fbs1. Our results suggest 
that Fbs1 assists clearance of aberrant glycoproteins in neuronal cells by 
suppressing aggregates formation, independent of ubiquitin ligase activity, and 
thus functions as a unique chaperone for those proteins.
