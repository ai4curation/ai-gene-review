To examine the autocrine effects that an organizing extracellular matrix has on 
osteoblast precursors, we created MC3T3-E1 cell lines that stably expressed 
pro-alpha1(I) collagen chains with a truncated triple helical domain. Cells that 
had incorporated the pro-alpha1(I) expression plasmid (pMG155) expressed 
shortened pro-alpha1(I) transcripts at high levels and efficiently secreted the 
expression gene products into culture media. Those cells lost over 30% of newly 
deposited collagenous matrix compared with virtually no loss in control 
cultures, and media from the abnormal cells had qualitative differences in 
matrix metalloprotinase production. Electron micrographs strongly suggested that 
type I collagen molecules containing the truncated pro-alpha1(I) chains 
dramatically interfered with collagen fibrillogenesis in newly forming 
osteoblast matrix. Abnormal collagen fibrillogenesis was also associated with 
altered characteristics of cellular differentiation in that abnormal cells 
displayed a delayed and attenuated increase in alkaline phosphatase activity. 
Surprisingly, synthesis of osteocalcin was more than 5-fold higher than control 
cultures. These findings demonstrate that osteoblasts require a normally 
structured collagenous matrix for up-regulation of alkaline phosphatase 
activity. However, in the presence of rapid turnover of osteoblast matrix, 
osteocalcin gene expression may be up-regulated in response to local signals by 
an unknown mechanism.
