The impact of cAMP on ROS-balance in human and mammalian cell cultures was 
studied. cAMP reduced accumulation of ROS induced by serum-limitation, under 
conditions in which there was no significant change in the activity of scavenger 
systems. This effect was associated with cAMP-dependent activation of the 
NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity of complex I. In fibroblasts from a 
patient a genetic defect in the 75 kDa FeS-protein subunit of complex I resulted 
in inhibition of the activity of the complex and enhanced ROS production, which 
were reversed by cAMP. A missense genetic defect in the NDUFS4 subunit, putative 
substrate of PKA, suppressed, on the other hand, the activity of the complex and 
prevented ROS production.
