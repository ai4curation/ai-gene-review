Plasmodium development within Anopheles mosquitoes is a vulnerable step in the 
parasite transmission cycle, and targeting this step represents a promising 
strategy for malaria control. The thioester-containing complement-like protein 
TEP1 and two leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins, LRIM1 and APL1, have been 
identified as major mosquito factors that regulate parasite loads. Here, we show 
that LRIM1 and APL1 are required for binding of TEP1 to parasites. RNAi 
silencing of the LRR-encoding genes results in deposition of TEP1 on Anopheles 
tissues, thereby depleting TEP1 from circulation in the hemolymph and impeding 
its binding to Plasmodium. LRIM1 and APL1 not only stabilize circulating TEP1, 
they also stabilize each other prior to their interaction with TEP1. Our results 
indicate that three major antiparasitic factors in mosquitoes jointly function 
as a complement-like system in parasite killing, and they reveal a role for LRR 
proteins as complement control factors.
