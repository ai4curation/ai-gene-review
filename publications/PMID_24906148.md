Beige fat, which expresses the thermogenic protein UCP1, provides a defense 
against cold and obesity. Although a cold environment is the physiologic 
stimulus for inducing beige fat in mice and humans, the events that lead from 
the sensing of cold to the development of beige fat remain poorly understood. 
Here, we identify the efferent beige fat thermogenic circuit, consisting of 
eosinophils, type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4/13, and alternatively activated 
macrophages. Genetic loss of eosinophils or IL-4/13 signaling impairs 
cold-induced biogenesis of beige fat. Mechanistically, macrophages recruited to 
cold-stressed subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) undergo alternative 
activation to induce tyrosine hydroxylase expression and catecholamine 
production, factors required for browning of scWAT. Conversely, administration 
of IL-4 to thermoneutral mice increases beige fat mass and thermogenic capacity 
to ameliorate pre-established obesity. Together, our findings have uncovered the 
efferent circuit controlling biogenesis of beige fat and provide support for its 
targeting to treat obesity.
