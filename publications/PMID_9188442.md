The endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is a key determinant of vascular 
homeostasis. Like all known nitric-oxide synthases, eNOS enzyme activity is 
dependent on Ca2+-calmodulin. eNOS is dynamically targeted to specialized cell 
surface signal-transducing domains termed plasmalemmal caveolae and interacts 
with caveolin, an integral membrane protein that comprises a key structural 
component of caveolae. We have previously reported that the association between 
eNOS and caveolin is quantitative and tissue-specific (Feron, O., Belhassen, L., 
Kobzick, L., Smith, T. W., Kelly, R. A., and Michel, T. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 
271, 22810-22814). We now report that in endothelial cells the interaction 
between eNOS and caveolin is importantly regulated by Ca2+-calmodulin. Addition 
of calmodulin disrupts the heteromeric complex formed between eNOS and caveolin 
in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. In addition, overexpression of caveolin markedly 
attenuates eNOS enzyme activity, but this inhibition is reversed by purified 
calmodulin. Caveolin overexpression does not affect the activity of the other 
NOS isoforms, suggesting eNOS-specific inhibition of NO synthase by caveolin. We 
propose a model of reciprocal regulation of eNOS in endothelial cells wherein 
the inhibitory eNOS-caveolin complex is disrupted by binding of Ca2+-calmodulin 
to eNOS, leading to enzyme activation. These findings may have broad 
implications for the regulation of Ca2+-dependent signal transduction in 
plasmalemmal caveolae.
