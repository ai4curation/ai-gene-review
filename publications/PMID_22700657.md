To better understand the response to mitochondrial dysfunction, we examined the 
mechanism by which ATFS-1 (activating transcription factor associated with 
stress-1) senses mitochondrial stress and communicates with the nucleus during 
the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)) in Caenorhabditis elegans. 
We found that the key point of regulation is the mitochondrial import efficiency 
of ATFS-1. In addition to a nuclear localization sequence, ATFS-1 has an 
N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence that is essential for UPR(mt) 
repression. Normally, ATFS-1 is imported into mitochondria and degraded. 
However, during mitochondrial stress, we found that import efficiency was 
reduced, allowing a percentage of ATFS-1 to accumulate in the cytosol and 
traffic to the nucleus. Our results show that cells monitor mitochondrial import 
efficiency via ATFS-1 to coordinate the level of mitochondrial dysfunction with 
the protective transcriptional response.
