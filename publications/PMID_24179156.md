The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors Ascl1/Mash1, Hes1, and Olig2 
regulate fate choice of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, respectively. 
These same factors are coexpressed by neural progenitor cells. Here, we found by 
time-lapse imaging that these factors are expressed in an oscillatory manner by 
mouse neural progenitor cells. In each differentiation lineage, one of the 
factors becomes dominant. We used optogenetics to control expression of Ascl1 
and found that, although sustained Ascl1 expression promotes neuronal fate 
determination, oscillatory Ascl1 expression maintains proliferating neural 
progenitor cells. Thus, the multipotent state correlates with oscillatory 
expression of several fate-determination factors, whereas the differentiated 
state correlates with sustained expression of a single factor.
