Ligand-induced desensitization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is 
controlled by c-Cbl, a ubiquitin ligase that binds multiple signaling proteins, 
including the Grb2 adaptor. Consistent with a negative role for c-Cbl, here we 
report that defective Tyr1045 of EGFR, an inducible c-Cbl docking site, enhances 
the mitogenic response to EGF. Signaling potentiation is due to accelerated 
recycling of the mutant receptor and a concomitant defect in ligand-induced 
ubiquitylation and endocytosis of EGFR. Kinetic as well as morphological 
analyses of the internalization-defective mutant receptor imply that 
c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitylation sorts EGFR to endocytosis and to subsequent 
degradation in lysosomes. Unexpectedly, however, the mutant receptor displayed 
significant residual ligand-induced ubiquitylation, especially in the presence 
of an overexpressed c-Cbl. The underlying mechanism seems to involve recruitment 
of a Grb2 c-Cbl complex to Grb2-specific docking sites of EGFR, and concurrent 
acceleration of receptor ubiquitylation and desensitization. Thus, in addition 
to its well-characterized role in mediating positive signals, Grb2 can terminate 
signal transduction by accelerating c-Cbl-dependent sorting of active tyrosine 
kinases to destruction.
