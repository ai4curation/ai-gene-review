Depletion of EHD3 affects sorting in endosomes by altering the kinetics and 
route of receptor recycling to the plasma membrane. Here we demonstrate that 
siRNA knockdown of EHD3, or its interaction partner rabenosyn-5, causes 
redistribution of sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) to enlarged early endosomes and 
disrupts transport of internalized Shiga toxin B subunit (STxB) to the Golgi. 
Moreover, under these conditions, Golgi morphology appears as a series of highly 
dispersed and fragmented stacks that maintain characteristics of cis-, medial- 
and trans-Golgi membranes. Although Arf1 still assembled onto these dispersed 
Golgi membranes, the level of AP-1 gamma-adaptin recruited to the Golgi was 
diminished. Whereas VSV-G-secretion from the dispersed Golgi remained largely 
unaffected, the distribution of mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) was altered: 
it remained in peripheral endosomes and did not return to the Golgi. Cathepsin 
D, a hydrolase that is normally transported to lysosomes via an M6PR-dependent 
pathway, remained trapped at the Golgi. Our findings support a role for EHD3 in 
regulating endosome-to-Golgi transport, and as a consequence, lysosomal 
biosynthetic, but not secretory, transport pathways are also affected. These 
data also suggest that impaired endosome-to-Golgi transport and the resulting 
lack of recruitment of AP-1 gamma-adaptin to Golgi membranes affect Golgi 
morphology.
