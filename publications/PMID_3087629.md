An Hsp70-like protein in the ER: identity with the 78 kd glucose-regulated 
protein and immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein.

Munro S, Pelham HR.

We have characterized a cDNA clone that encodes a protein related to the 70 kd 
heat shock protein, but is expressed in normal rat liver. This protein has a 
hydrophobic leader and is secreted into the endoplasmic reticulum. We show that 
it is identical with two previously described proteins: GRP78, whose synthesis 
is induced by glucose starvation, and BiP, which is found bound to 
immunoglobulin heavy chains in pre-B cells. This protein, which is abundant in 
antibody-secreting cells, can be released from heavy chains by ATP, a reaction 
analogous to the release of hsp70 from heat shocked nuclear structures. We 
propose a specific role for this protein in the assembly of secreted and 
membrane-bound proteins.
