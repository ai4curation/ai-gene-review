The p62/SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1) protein, which acts as a cargo receptor for 
autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated targets, is up-regulated by various 
stressors. Induction of the p62 gene by oxidative stress is mediated by 
NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and, at the same time, p62 protein contributes to 
the activation of NRF2, but hitherto the mechanisms involved were not known. 
Herein, we have mapped an antioxidant response element (ARE) in the p62 promoter 
that is responsible for its induction by oxidative stress via NRF2. Chromatin 
immunoprecipitation and gel mobility-shift assays verified that NRF2 binds to 
this cis-element in vivo and in vitro. Also, p62 docks directly onto the 
Kelch-repeat domain of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), via a motif 
designated the KEAP1 interacting region (KIR), thereby blocking binding between 
KEAP1 and NRF2 that leads to ubiquitylation and degradation of the transcription 
factor. The KIR motif in p62 is located immediately C-terminal to the 
LC3-interacting region (LIR) and resembles the ETGE motif utilized by NRF2 for 
its interaction with KEAP1. KIR is required for p62 to stabilize NRF2, and 
inhibition of KEAP1 by p62 occurs from a cytoplasmic location within the cell. 
The LIR and KIR motifs cannot be engaged simultaneously by LC3 and KEAP1, but 
because p62 is polymeric the interaction between KEAP1 and p62 leads to 
accumulation of KEAP1 in p62 bodies, which is followed by autophagic degradation 
of KEAP1. Our data explain how p62 contributes to activation of NRF2 target 
genes in response to oxidative stress through creating a positive feedback loop.
