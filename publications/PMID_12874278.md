Wnt signaling is essential during development while deregulation of this pathway 
frequently leads to the formation of various tumors including colorectal 
carcinomas. A key component of the pathway is beta-catenin that, in association 
with TCF-4, directly regulates the expression of Wnt-responsive genes. To 
identify novel binding partners of beta-catenin that may control its 
transcriptional activity, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid screen and 
isolated the Tax-interacting protein (TIP-1). The in vivo complex formation 
between beta-catenin and TIP-1 was verified by coimmunoprecipitation, and a 
direct physical association was revealed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down 
experiments in vitro. By using a panel of deletion mutants of both proteins, we 
demonstrate that the interaction is mediated by the PDZ (PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1 
homology) domain of TIP-1 and requires primarily the last four amino acids of 
beta-catenin. TIP-1 overexpression resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the 
transcriptional activity of beta-catenin when tested on the TOP/FOPFLASH 
reporter system. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knock-down of endogenous TIP-1 
slightly increased endogenous beta-catenin transactivation function. Moreover, 
we show that overexpression of TIP-1 reduced the proliferation and 
anchorage-independent growth of colorectal cancer cells. These data suggest that 
TIP-1 may represent a novel regulatory element in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling 
pathway.
