We searched for novel proteins in lysosomal membranes, tentatively participating 
in molecular transport across the membrane and/or in interactions with other 
compartments. In membranes purified from placental lysosomes, we identified 58 
proteins, known to reside at least partially in the lysosomal membrane. These 
included 17 polypeptides comprising or associated with the vacuolar adenosine 
triphosphatase. We report on additional 86 proteins that were significantly 
enriched in the lysosomal membrane fraction. Among these, 12 novel proteins of 
unknown functions were found. Three were orthologues of rat proteins that have 
been identified in tritosomes by Bagshaw RD et al. (A proteomic analysis of 
lysosomal integral membrane proteins reveals the diverse composition of the 
organelle. Mol Cell Proteomics 2005;4:133-143). Here, the proteins encoded by 
LOC201931 (FLJ38482) and LOC51622 (C7orf28A) were expressed with an appended 
fluorescent tag in HeLa cells and found to be present in lysosomal organelles. 
Among the lysosomally enriched proteins, also 16 enzymes and transporters were 
detected that had not been assigned to lysosomal membranes previously. Finally, 
our results identified a particular set of proteins with known functions in 
signaling and targeting to be at least partially associated with lysosomes.
