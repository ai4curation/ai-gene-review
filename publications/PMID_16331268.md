Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) play key roles in the 
intracellular signaling pathways of the interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines, 
which exhibit a diverse set of cellular responses, including cell proliferation 
and differentiation. Dysregulated IL-6/STAT3 signaling is involved in the 
pathogenesis of several diseases, for example autoimmune diseases and tumors. 
Type I interferon (IFN) induces the expression of proapoptotic genes and has 
been used in the clinical treatment of several tumors. In the present study, we 
found that type I IFN suppressed IL-6/STAT3-mediated transcription and gene 
expression. Furthermore, a type I IFN-induced protein, Daxx, also suppressed 
STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation, while overexpression of Daxx 
inhibited IL-6/STAT3-mediated gene expression. Importantly, small-interfering 
RNA-mediated reduction of Daxx expression enhanced IL-6/leukemia inhibitory 
factor (LIF)-induced STAT3-dependent transcription. Co-immunoprecipitation 
studies revealed a physical interaction between Daxx and STAT3 in transiently 
transfected 293T cells. We further found that Daxx and STAT3 were co-localized 
in the nucleus. These results indicate that Daxx may serve as a transcriptional 
regulator of type I IFN-mediated suppression of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling 
pathway.
