Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and associated with 
progressive deposition of amyloid β-peptides (Aβ) in the brain. Aβ derives by 
sequential proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein by β- and 
γ-secretases. Rare mutations that lead to amino-acid substitutions within or 
close to the Aβ domain promote the formation of neurotoxic Aβ assemblies and can 
cause early-onset AD. However, mechanisms that increase the aggregation of 
wild-type Aβ and cause the much more common sporadic forms of AD are largely 
unknown. Here, we show that extracellular Aβ undergoes phosphorylation by 
protein kinases at the cell surface and in cerebrospinal fluid of the human 
brain. Phosphorylation of serine residue 8 promotes formation of oligomeric Aβ 
assemblies that represent nuclei for fibrillization. Phosphorylated Aβ was 
detected in the brains of transgenic mice and human AD brains and showed 
increased toxicity in Drosophila models as compared with non-phosphorylated Aβ. 
Phosphorylation of Aβ could represent an important molecular mechanism in the 
pathogenesis of the most common sporadic form of AD.
