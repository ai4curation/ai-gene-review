Cell migration driven by actomyosin filament assembly is a critical step in 
tumour invasion and metastasis. Herein, we report identification of myosin 
binding protein H (MYBPH) as a transcriptional target of TTF-1 (also known as 
NKX2-1 and TITF1), a master regulator of lung development that also plays a role 
as a lineage-survival oncogene in lung adenocarcinoma development. MYBPH 
inhibited assembly competence-conferring phosphorylation of the myosin 
regulatory light chain (RLC) as well as activating phosphorylation of LIM domain 
kinase (LIMK), unexpectedly through its direct physical interaction with Rho 
kinase 1 (ROCK1) rather than with RLC. Consequently, MYBPH inhibited ROCK1 and 
negatively regulated actomyosin organization, which in turn reduced single cell 
motility and increased collective cell migration, resulting in decreased cancer 
invasion and metastasis. Finally, we also show that MYBPH is epigenetically 
inactivated by promoter DNA methylation in a fraction of TTF-1-positive lung 
adenocarcinomas, which appears to be in accordance with its deleterious 
functions in lung adenocarcinoma invasion and metastasis, as well as with the 
paradoxical association of TTF-1 expression with favourable prognosis in lung 
adenocarcinoma patients.
