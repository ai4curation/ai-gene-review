The thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast is the center of oxygenic 
photosynthesis. To better understand the function of the luminal compartment 
within the thylakoid network, we have carried out a systematic characterization 
of the luminal thylakoid proteins from the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. 
Our data show that the thylakoid lumen has its own specific proteome, of which 
36 proteins were identified. Besides a large group of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans 
isomerases and proteases, a family of novel PsbP domain proteins was found. An 
analysis of the luminal signal peptides showed that 19 of 36 luminal precursors 
were marked by a twin-arginine motif for import via the Tat pathway. To compare 
the model organism Arabidopsis with another typical higher plant, we 
investigated the proteome from the thylakoid lumen of spinach and found that the 
luminal proteins from both plants corresponded well. As a complement to our 
experimental investigation, we made a theoretical prediction of the luminal 
proteins from the whole Arabidopsis genome and estimated that the thylakoid 
lumen of the chloroplast contains approximately 80 proteins.
