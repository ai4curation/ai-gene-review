Phospholipids are known to influence fibril formation of amyloid beta (Aβ) 
peptide. Here, we show that lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), a polar phospholipid, 
enhances Aβ(1-42) fibril formation, by decreasing the lag time and the critical 
peptide concentration required for fibril formation, and increasing the fibril 
elongation rate. Conversely, LPC did not have an enhancing effect on Aβ(1-40) 
fibril formation, and appeared to be inhibitory. Tyrosine fluorescence 
spectroscopy showed that LPC altered the fluorescence spectra of Aβ(1-40) and 
Aβ(1-42) in opposite ways. Further, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid 
fluorescence spectroscopy showed that LPC significantly increased the 
hydrophobicity of Aβ(1-42), but not of Aβ(1-40). Tris-tricine gradient SDS/PAGE 
revealed that LPC increased the formation of higher-molecular-weight species of 
Aβ(1-42), including trimers and tetramers. LPC had no such effect on Aβ(1-40), 
and thus may specifically influence the oligomerization and nucleation processes 
of Aβ(1-42) in a manner dependent on its native structure. Dot-blot assays 
confirmed that LPC induced Aβ(1-42) oligomer formation at an early time point. 
Thus our results indicate that LPC specifically enhances the formation of 
Aβ(1-42) fibrils, the main component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease 
patients, and may be involved in Alzheimer's disease pathology.
