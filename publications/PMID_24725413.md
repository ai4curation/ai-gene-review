Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulates numerous neuronal functions with its 
activator, p35. Under neurotoxic conditions, p35 undergoes proteolytic cleavage 
to liberate p25, which has been implicated in various neurodegenerative 
diseases. Here, we show that p25 is generated following neuronal activity under 
physiological conditions in a GluN2B- and CaMKIIα-dependent manner. Moreover, we 
developed a knockin mouse model in which endogenous p35 is replaced with a 
calpain-resistant mutant p35 (Δp35KI) to prevent p25 generation. The Δp35KI mice 
exhibit impaired long-term depression and defective memory extinction, likely 
mediated through persistent GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser845. Finally, crossing 
the Δp35KI mice with the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) resulted 
in an amelioration of β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced synaptic depression and cognitive 
impairment. Together, these results reveal a physiological role of p25 
production in synaptic plasticity and memory and provide new insights into the 
function of p25 in Aβ-associated neurotoxicity and AD-like pathology.
