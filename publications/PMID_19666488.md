Pmel17 is a melanocyte protein necessary for eumelanin deposition 1 in mammals 
and found in melanosomes in a filamentous form. The luminal part of human Pmel17 
includes a region (RPT) with 10 copies of a partial repeat sequence, 
pt.e.gttp.qv., known to be essential in vivo for filament formation. We show 
that this RPT region readily forms amyloid in vitro, but only under the mildly 
acidic conditions typical of the lysosome-like melanosome lumen, and the 
filaments quickly become soluble at neutral pH. Under the same mildly acidic 
conditions, the Pmel filaments promote eumelanin formation. Electron 
diffraction, circular dichroism, and solid-state NMR studies of Pmel17 filaments 
show that the structure is rich in beta sheet. We suggest that RPT is the 
amyloid core domain of the Pmel17 filaments so critical for melanin formation.
