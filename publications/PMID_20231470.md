The development of anther and pollen is important for male reproduction, and 
this process is coordinately regulated by many external and internal cues. In 
this study, we systematically examined the male reproductive phenotypes of a 
series of brassinosteroid biosynthetic and signaling mutants and found that, 
besides the expected cell-expansion defects, these mutants also showed reduced 
pollen number, viability, and release efficiency. These defects were related 
with abnormal tapetum and microspore development. Using both real-time 
quantitative RT-PCR and microarray experiments, we found that the expression of 
many key genes required for anther and pollen development was suppressed in 
these mutants. ChIP analysis demonstrated that BES1, an important transcription 
factor for brassinosteroid signaling, could directly bind to the promoter 
regions of genes encoding transcription factors essential for anther and pollen 
development, SPL/NZZ, TDF1, AMS, MS1, and MS2. Taken together, these data lead 
us to propose that brassinosteroids control male fertility at least in part via 
directly regulating key genes for anther and pollen development in Arabidopsis. 
Our work provides a unique mechanism to explain how a phytohormone regulates an 
essential genetic program for plant development.

Abstract

The development of anther and pollen is important for male reproduction, and this process is coordinately regulated by many external and internal cues. In this study, we systematically examined the male reproductive phenotypes of a series of brassinosteroid biosynthetic and signaling mutants and found that, besides the expected cell-expansion defects, these mutants also showed reduced pollen number, viability, and release efficiency. These defects were related with abnormal tapetum and microspore development. Using both real-time quantitative RT-PCR and microarray experiments, we found that the expression of many key genes required for anther and pollen development was suppressed in these mutants. ChIP analysis demonstrated that BES1, an important transcription factor for brassinosteroid signaling, could directly bind to the promoter regions of genes encoding transcription factors essential for anther and pollen development, SPL/NZZ , TDF1 , AMS , MS1 , and MS2 . Taken together, these data lead us to propose that brassinosteroids control male fertility at least in part via directly regulating key genes for anther and pollen development in Arabidopsis . Our work provides a unique mechanism to explain how a phytohormone regulates an essential genetic program for plant development.

Discussion

After systematic analyses of the male-fertility phenotypes of the BR-deficient and signaling mutants, and a transgenic line, we obtained strong evidence that supports the regulation of BR signaling on pollen and anther development. First, the pollen number is greatly reduced. Compared to the wild type, the BR mutants, bri1-116 and cpd , only produced fewer than half of the normal number of microspore mother cells, and produce about 25% of pollen grains at stages 8 and 9, and about 20% at stage 12 ( Fig. 1 J ). Therefore, the reduced pollen number in the BR mutants is likely caused by the decreased microspore mother cells and early abortion of some microspores. Second, the pollen grains produced in the BR mutants had an abnormal exine pattern, as indicated by lacking an obvious bacula/tectum structure ( Fig. 2 Jâ€“L ), resulting in rare release from anther locules. Third, tapetal development of the BR mutants was abnormal, indicated by the extremely vacuolated and enlarged tapetal cells ( Fig. 1 ), providing a reasonable explanation for the abnormal deposition of pollen wall components and abnormal pollen exine patterning.

Our results strongly suggest that BRs affect anther and pollen development at several stages by controlling the expression of SPL/NZZ , TDF1 , AMS , MYB103 , MS2 , MS1 , and many downstream genes of MS1 . First, in the BR mutants, the expression of SPL/NZZ is significantly inhibited. This decrease might account for the reduced number of microspore mother cells in the mutants. Interestingly, it was observed that the expression of BRI1 in the spl/nzz mutant was 3-fold higher than that in the wild type ( 4 ), suggesting that a feedback regulatory mechanism may also be involved in the BR signaling and the default regulator network in pollen and anther development. Furthermore, the expression of multiple genes, including TDF1 , AMS , MYB103 , and MS1 , involved in pollen development is significantly inhibited in the mutants, which might cause the early abortion of some microspores and finally lead to the greatly reduced number of pollen grains. Finally, the expression of MS2 and many MS1 -regulated genes, which directly regulate the structure and composition of pollen coat, is also suppressed in the BR mutants. Therefore, BRs function from the early microspore mother formation to late pollen maturation to regulate anther development by controlling the expression of SPL/NZZ , TDF1 , MYB103 , MS1 , and MS2.

Although it is well known that many genes involved in wall loosing and cell elongation are activated by the BR-regulated transcription factors, such as BES1/BZR1 ( 37 , 43 ), it is poorly understood whether the BR-activated transcription factors can directly regulate genes involved in other developmental processes. For instance, BES1 and BIM1 can directly bind to the promoter regions of SAUR-AC1 and regulate its expression ( 37 ). A recent study found that AtMYB30 , encoding a MYB family transcription factor, is a direct target gene of BES1, which may play an important role in the early stage of plant development ( 44 ). It was reported that BRs may play an important role in directing root epidermal cells to differentiate into hair cells or mature hairless cells in Arabidopsis ( 45 ). In this work, we found that the promoter regions of many genes involved in pollen and anther development contain multiple binding sites of BES1/BZR1 ( Fig. S4 ), and our ChIP experiments demonstrated that at least one site in the promoter regions of NZZ/SPL , TDF1 , MS1 , MS2 , MYB103, and AT3g23770 can directly bind to BES1. Therefore, this study provides a unique example to demonstrate that BRs regulate cell division and differentiation, leading to a specific developmental process, which is largely beyond the known BR-regulated cell expansion.

Based on the current and previous findings, we summarize a model to illustrate the cellular and molecular basis of BRs in regulating male fertility in Arabidopsis . As shown in Fig. 4 , BR signaling can positively regulate filament and pollen tube elongation, which are related to cell elongation. More importantly, BRs control multiple steps of anther development, including microspore mother cell formation, microspore development, tapetal development, and pollen coat formation. The regulation is largely through the direct binding of BES1 to the promoter regions of NZZ/SPL , TDF1 , AMS , MYB103 , MS2 , MS1 , and MS1 -target genes. Many external and internal stimuli can also regulate male fertility. For example, a high temperature treatment on 3-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings with four to five mature flowers led to the failure of separation of pollen mother cells, inhibition of microspore differentiation and male meiotic processes, and finally, failure to produce any pollen grains ( 46 ). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for such regulation are still largely unknown. Moreover, although the hand pollination with bri1-116 pollen can lead to successful fertilization under optimal conditions, we did observe the slower growth of bri1-116 pollen tubes than the wild-type pollen tubes. Therefore, the large amount of BRs in mature pollens may play an important role in regulating efficiency of fertilization under adverse conditions. Our study provides important insights into the mechanisms by which an internal signal interacts with an essential genetic program to regulate the corresponding developmental process. Furthermore, various stimuli, including multiple phytohormones, may coordinately regulate several steps of anther and pollen development; thus, further studies on the interaction of different signals are needed to understand this regulatory network.
