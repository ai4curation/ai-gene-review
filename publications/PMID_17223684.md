Distinct catalytic mechanisms have been proposed for the Gcn5 and MYST histone 
acetyltransferase (HAT) families. Gcn5-like HATs utilize an ordered sequential 
mechanism involving direct nucleophilic attack of the N-epsilon-lysine on the 
enzyme-bound acetyl-CoA. Recently, MYST enzymes were reported to employ a 
ping-pong route of catalysis via an acetyl-cysteine intermediate. Here, using 
the prototypical MYST family member Esa1, and its physiological complex (piccolo 
NuA4), steady-state kinetic analyses revealed a kinetic mechanism that requires 
the formation of a ternary complex prior to catalysis, where acetyl-CoA binds 
first and CoA is the last product released. In the absence of histone acceptor, 
slow rates of enzyme auto-acetylation (7 x 10(-4) s(-1), or approximately 
2500-fold slower than histone acetylation; kcat = 1.6 s(-1)) and of CoA 
formation (0.0021 s(-1)) were inconsistent with a kinetically competent 
acetyl-enzyme intermediate. Previously, Cys-304 of Esa1 was the proposed 
nucleophile that forms an acetyl-cysteine intermediate. Here, mutation of this 
cysteine (C304A) in Esa1 or within the piccolo NuA4 complex yielded an enzyme 
that was catalytically indistinguishable from the wild type. Similarly, a pH 
rate (kcat) analysis of the wild type and C304A revealed an ionization (pKa = 
7.6-7.8) that must be unprotonated. Mutation of a conserved active-site 
glutamate (E338Q) reduced kcat approximately 200-fold at pH 7.5; however, at 
higher pH, E338Q exhibited nearly wild-type activity. These data are consistent 
with Glu-338 (general base) activating the N-epsilon-lysine by deprotonation. 
Together, the results suggest that MYST family HATs utilize a direct-attack 
mechanism within an Esa1 x acetyl-CoA x histone ternary complex.
