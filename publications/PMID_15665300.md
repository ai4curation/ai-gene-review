Children with the tumor predisposition syndrome, neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), 
develop optic pathway gliomas. The NF1 gene product, neurofibromin, functions as 
a negative regulator of RAS, such that NF1 inactivation results in RAS 
hyperactivation. Recent studies have highlighted the divergent biological and 
biochemical properties of the various RAS isoforms, which prompted us to examine 
the consequence of Nf1 inactivation in astrocytes on RAS isoform activation in 
vitro and in vivo. In this report, we show that only K-RAS is activated in 
Nf1-/- astrocytes and that activation of K-RAS, but not H-RAS, accounts for the 
proliferative advantage and abnormal actin cytoskeleton-mediated processes 
observed in Nf1-/- astrocytes in vitro. Moreover, dominant inhibitory K-RAS 
corrects these abnormalities in Nf1-/- astrocytes invitro. Lastly, we show that 
Nf1+/- mice with astrocyte-specific activated K-RAS expression in vivo develop 
optic pathway gliomas, similar to our previously reported Nf1+/- mice with 
astrocyte Nf1 inactivation. Collectively, our results show that K-RAS is the 
primary target for neurofibromin GTPase-activating protein activity in vitro and 
in vivo and that K-RAS activation in astrocytes recapitulates the biochemical, 
biological, and tumorigenic properties of neurofibromin loss.
