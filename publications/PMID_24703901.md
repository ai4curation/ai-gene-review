Repetitive DNA sequences, such as those present in microsatellites and 
minisatellites, telomeres, and trinucleotide repeats (linked to fragile X 
syndrome, Huntington disease, etc.), account for nearly 30% of the human genome. 
These domains exhibit enhanced susceptibility to oxidative attack to yield base 
modifications, strand breaks, and abasic sites; have a propensity to adopt 
non-canonical DNA forms modulated by the positions of the lesions; and, when not 
properly processed, can contribute to genome instability that underlies aging 
and disease development. Knowledge on the repair efficiencies of DNA damage 
within such repetitive sequences is therefore crucial for understanding the 
impact of such domains on genomic integrity. In the present study, using 
strategically designed oligonucleotide substrates, we determined the ability of 
human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) to cleave at 
apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in a collection of tandem DNA repeat landscapes 
involving telomeric and CAG/CTG repeat sequences. Our studies reveal the 
differential influence of domain sequence, conformation, and AP site 
location/relative positioning on the efficiency of APE1 binding and strand 
incision. Intriguingly, our data demonstrate that APE1 endonuclease efficiency 
correlates with the thermodynamic stability of the DNA substrate. We discuss how 
these results have both predictive and mechanistic consequences for 
understanding the success and failure of repair protein activity associated with 
such oxidatively sensitive, conformationally plastic/dynamic repetitive DNA 
domains.
