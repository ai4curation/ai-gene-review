We describe a general method based on principal coordinates analysis to predict 
the effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms within regulatory sequences on 
DNA-protein interactions. We use binding data for the transcription factor 
NF-kappaB as a test system. The method incorporates the effects of interactions 
between base pair positions in the binding site, and we demonstrate that such 
interactions are present for NF-kappaB. Prediction accuracy is higher than with 
profile models, confirmed by crossvalidation and by the experimental 
verification of our predictions for additional sequences. The binding affinities 
of all potential NF-kappaB sites on human chromosome 22, together with the 
effects of known single-nucleotide polymorphisms, are calculated to determine 
likely functional variants. We propose that this approach may be valuable, 
either on its own or in combination with other methods, when standard profile 
models are disadvantaged by complex internucleotide interactions.

Abstract

We describe a general method based on principal coordinates analysis to predict the effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms within regulatory sequences on DNA–protein interactions. We use binding data for the transcription factor NF-κB as a test system. The method incorporates the effects of interactions between base pair positions in the binding site, and we demonstrate that such interactions are present for NF-κB. Prediction accuracy is higher than with profile models, confirmed by crossvalidation and by the experimental verification of our predictions for additional sequences. The binding affinities of all potential NF-κB sites on human chromosome 22, together with the effects of known single-nucleotide polymorphisms, are calculated to determine likely functional variants. We propose that this approach may be valuable, either on its own or in combination with other methods, when standard profile models are disadvantaged by complex internucleotide interactions.

Discussion

We have described a method to predict the quantitative effect of sequence variation on binding affinity, applicable to the analysis of any DNA-binding protein. It requires experimental binding data from only a selection of potential binding sites chosen so that all other sites are within a single base change of this training set. For NF-κB, binding data from only 52 of 256 decamers were used to predict the remainder. The least number of sequences spanning the consensus sequence space is 23. However, it is desirable that the number of data points should be large enough to reduce prediction error because of experimental variation. With microarrays, it is possible to assay the training set in a single experiment ( 12 , 13 ). In theory, data could also be acquired from crystallographic or NMR studies generated for a single site ( 25 ), but data from many structures would be needed to match the predictive power of the model presented here.

The PC analysis projects the set of binding sites into a space that reflects accurately the differences between the sequences. Directions in sequence space along which the binding sites do not vary are implicitly ignored, so parameters that could not contribute to the model are never included. We confirmed its accuracy by crossvalidation and by experimentally verifying our predictions for nine additional motifs not included in the training set. For NF-κB, binding affinity was modeled as a linear function of the sequences' coordinates. Nonlinear models did not improve the fit significantly (data not shown) but might be appropriate in other contexts. The PC model is accurate at prediction within the space of sequences matching the binding consensus but not necessarily outside of that space.

The PC approach compares favorably with profile-based methods. For instance, matinspector ( 7 ) predictions show much lower correlation with observed binding than does our PC model. However, because the profile database used by matinspector lacks our empirical data, as a fairer test we compared the PC model with two P models created from those data. The PC model performs significantly better than both P models for p50p65 and marginally better for p50p50. The crossvalidated correlation between predictions and observations is higher with the PC model in all cases, and moreover the fit improves significantly when the PC model is combined with either P model. Because the only additional information encoded by the PC model relates to the covariation of nucleotide positions in the binding site, these interactions must have a role in NF-κB binding. The extent to which such interactions occur in general remains to be seen, and a comprehensive study is desirable. The PC model is therefore valuable, either on its own or in combination with other methods, when empirical data are limited, and where internucleotide interactions occur. Profiles will continue to be useful, but we have shown they have limitations, and that one can do better.

Although the binding affinities for p50p50 and p50p65 are strongly correlated, we identified two directions in sequence space where the dimers had significantly different regression coefficients. The main distinguishing factors between the two complexes predominantly involve the inner core positions 5 and 6, defined as NN in the original consensus. We can therefore predict those sequences that are likely to bind differently to the two complexes. Kunsch et al. ( 14 ) came to a similar conclusion based on the selex -type assay with homodimeric NF-κB complexes, in which the preferential binding motif for p50p50 was GGGGATYCCC, whereas p65p65 preferred GGGRNTTTCC. Our results extend this observation. We find a number of motifs that have a higher predicted preference for one of the dimers (e.g., GGAAAGTTCC, 5 times higher for p50p65 that for p50p50). This is of particular biological relevance, as p50p65 is a potent transcriptional activator, and p50p50 is believed to act as a repressor ( 26 , 27 ).

Those sequences that define the original NF-κB consensus and that rank high in our model were discovered by their roles in the transcriptional regulation of Igκ, IFN-β, IL-6, E-selectin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), etc. As it excludes some sequences that bind strongly, e.g., the human TNF promoter ( 22 ), we broadened the consensus slightly. Fig. 4 suggests the consensus may need to be widened still further—for instance, a pair of flanking guanidines is not always necessary.

Our analysis of chromosome 22 and the MHC region indicates we can predict which NF-κB sites are likely to bind. These predictions should be tested in vivo ( 28 , 29 ) to determine whether other factors such as chromatin are involved. For example, the binding site for yeast Repressor-activated protein 1 is found throughout the yeast genome, but binding occurs preferentially to potential promotors in intergenic regions ( 30 ). It will also be interesting to examine the regions of extended cross-species homology, as it is believed that long-range regulatory sequences tend to be conserved among mammals ( 31 ).

We can readily predict those SNPs occurring within binding sites that are likely to have functional effects. Previously ( 3 ), we demonstrated that a SNP within the NF-κB motif of the tumor necrosis factor promoter dramatically decreased the binding of p50p50, yet left the binding of p50p65 practically unchanged and resulted in a higher level of gene transcription. We identified about 50 SNPs located within NF-κB-like motifs on chromosome 22 that would alter NF-κB binding to DNA. These SNPs may be good candidates for disease association studies.

Finally, NF-κB is only one among a few scores of common transcription factors that regulate a majority of genes. It should therefore be feasible to construct quantitative models for all these factors by performing a relatively small number of binding assays. Armed with these data, one would be well placed to predict the binding affinities at the complex of transcription sites that regulate each gene ( 32 , 33 ) and then begin to model how gene expression varies as a function of polymorphisms within the binding sites.
