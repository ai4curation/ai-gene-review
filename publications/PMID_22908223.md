The recognition between retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RLRs) and 
viral RNA triggers an intracellular cascade of signaling to induce the 
expression of type I IFNs. Both positive and negative regulation of the RLR 
signaling pathway are important for the host antiviral immune response. Here, we 
demonstrate that the tetraspanin protein TSPAN6 inhibits RLR signaling by 
affecting the formation of the adaptor MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral 
signaling)-centered signalosome. We found that overexpression of TSPAN6 impaired 
RLR-mediated activation of IFN-stimulated response element, NF-κB, and IFN-β 
promoters, whereas knockdown of TSPAN6 enhanced the RLR-mediated signaling 
pathway. Interestingly, as the RLR pathway was activated, TSPAN6 underwent 
Lys-63-linked ubiquitination, which promoted its association with MAVS. The 
interaction of TSPAN6 and MAVS interfered with the recruitment of RLR downstream 
molecules TRAF3, MITA, and IRF3 to MAVS. Further study revealed that the first 
transmembrane domain of TSPAN6 is critical for its ubiquitination and 
association with MAVS as well as its inhibitory effect on RLR signaling. We 
concluded that TSPAN6 functions as a negative regulator of the RLR pathway by 
interacting with MAVS in a ubiquitination-dependent manner.

Both positive and negative regulation of the RLR signaling pathway are important for the host antiviral immune response.

Introduction

It is known that retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) 3 and its closely related molecule, MDA5 ( m elanoma d ifferentiation- a ssociated gene 5 ), are categorized as RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which are essential cytosolic sensors for detecting RNA virus infection ( 1 ). Upon detecting viral RNAs, RLRs are recruited to the mitochondrial adaptor MAVS ( m itochondrial a nti v iral s ignaling; also called VISA, IPS-1, and Cardif) ( 2 – 5 ), then other RLR signaling components such as MITA (mediator of IRF3 activation), TRAF2/3/6 ( T NF r eceptor- a ssociated f actor 2/3/6 ), TRADD, and RIP1 are subsequently recruited to MAVS, forming a MAVS-centered signalosome, which further triggers TBK1- and IκB kinase-mediated activation of IRF3/7 ( I FN r egulatory f actor 3/7 ) and NF-κB. These signaling events ultimately lead to the induction of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines ( 6 ).

Nevertheless, the uncontrolled immune response will cause autoimmune and inflammatory-related diseases. Tight regulation of the RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway is consequently important to mount a strong antiviral response as well as to prevent ultra-immune responses due to overproduction of IFNs ( 1 , 6 ). Studies on how RLR-mediated immune signaling is regulated are important to understand the maintenance mechanisms of homeostasis. Ubiquitination regulates the stability, activity, and localization of proteins and has emerged as an effective mechanism that controls RLR-mediated immune signaling. Lys-63-linked ubiquitination normally elevates the stability and activity of target proteins, whereas Lys-48-linked ubiquitination usually leads to the degradation of target proteins ( 7 ). For instance, TRIM25 catalyzes Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, which enhances the RIG-I/MAVS interaction and the activation of downstream signaling ( 8 ). The Lys-63-linked self-ubiquitination of TRAF3 promotes its recruitment to MAVS and leads to the activation of IRF3 ( 9 ). The E3 ligase RNF125 can mediate Lys-48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, MDA5, and MAVS, which promotes their degradation ( 10 ).

It is well established that tetraspanins interact with multiple immune-related molecules, including immune receptors, integrins, and signaling molecules, and function as important immune response modulators ( 11 , 12 ). The tetraspanin CD9 regulates migration, adhesion, and homing of human cord blood CD34 + hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( 13 ). The presence of tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD81, and CD82 at viral exit sites and in viral particles inhibits HIV-1-induced membrane fusion ( 14 ). TSPAN6 belongs to tetraspanin superfamily, but its biological function is uncertain. In this study, we found that TSPAN6 inhibits the RLR-mediated immune response. It impairs RIG-I-, MDA5-, and MAVS-mediated (but not TBK1- and Toll-like receptor adaptor TRIF-mediated) activation of IFN-β. It also inhibits influenza A virus RNA- and Sendai virus (SeV)-induced IFN-β activation. As the RLR signaling pathway is activated, TSPAN6 undergoes Lys-63-linked ubiquitination, which is critical for its interaction with MAVS and the inhibitory effect on the recruitment of TRAF3, MITA, and IRF3 to MAVS. We also found that knockdown of TSPAN6 enhances the RLR-mediated immune response. Thus, we propose that TSPAN6 is a negative regulator of the RLR-mediated signaling pathway.

DISCUSSION

RLR-mediated immune signaling functions as an effective mechanism against RNA virus infection ( 1 , 19 ). However, the unstinted immune response is harmful to the host. To avoid this, the host evolved molecules that negatively regulate the RLR pathway activity ( 6 , 20 ), but so far, the molecules and the mechanisms involved in the down-regulation of RLR signaling are not fully understood. Here, we have shown TSPAN6 inhibits activation of the RLR pathway by affecting formation of the MAVS-centered signalosome in a ubiquitination-dependent manner.

We observed that TSPAN6 was recruited to mitochondria when 293T cells were challenged with SeV, and the interaction between TSPAN6 and MAVS was also consistently induced by SeV infection. Of note, TSPAN6 underwent ubiquitination as the RLR antiviral pathway was activated by overexpression of MAVS, transfection with viral RNA, or infection with SeV. More important, we found that the ubiquitination-defective form of TSPAN6, TSPAN6Δ1, neither interacted with MAVS nor exhibited an inhibitory effect on RLR signaling. Therefore, we hypothesize that the ubiquitination of TSPAN6 upon RLR activation will lead to its relocalization to mitochondria, promote its association with MAVS, and eventually inhibit formation of the MAVS-centered signalosome. This may represent a negative feedback loop of host innate immunity. However, in the process of RLR signaling activation, the detailed mechanism of how the ubiquitination of TSPAN6 is exactly controlled and which E3 ubiquitin ligase is involved still need further research, whereas according to our results, it is highly possible that the activity of some E3 ligases is also controlled by the status of the RLR-mediated immune response. It will be important to determine the E3 ligases or deubiquitinases that are involved in the RLR signaling pathway. In addition, the exact model of how TSPAN6 affects formation of the MAVS-centered signalosome requires further investigation.

The ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6 is critical for their recruitment to MAVS and the activation of IRF3 and NF-κB ( 7 ). In this study, we observed that the ubiquitination of TRAF3, but not TRAF6, was severely impaired when TSPAN6 was ectopically expressed in SeV-infected 293T cells (data not shown), whereas why and how TSPAN6 influences the ubiquitination of TRAF3 still need further elucidation.

In conclusion, we identified the tetraspanin protein TSPAN6 as a negative regulator of RLR pathway-mediated immune signaling. We demonstrated that RLR signaling-induced ubiquitination of TSPAN6 is a prerequisite for its inhibitory effect on the RLR pathway. This finding expands our knowledge about how host molecules are involved in the negative regulation of the RLR pathway.
