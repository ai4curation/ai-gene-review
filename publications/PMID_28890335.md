During autophagosome formation in mammalian cells, isolation membranes (IMs; 
autophagosome precursors) dynamically contact the ER. Here, we demonstrated that 
the ER-localized metazoan-specific autophagy protein EPG-3/VMP1 controls ER-IM 
contacts. Loss of VMP1 causes stable association of IMs with the ER, thus 
blocking autophagosome formation. Interaction of WIPI2 with the ULK1/FIP200 
complex and PI(3)P contributes to the formation of ER-IM contacts, and these 
interactions are enhanced by VMP1 depletion. VMP1 controls contact formation by 
promoting SERCA (sarco[endo]plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase) activity. VMP1 
interacts with SERCA and prevents formation of the SERCA/PLN/SLN inhibitory 
complex. VMP1 also modulates ER contacts with lipid droplets, mitochondria, and 
endosomes. These ER contacts are greatly elevated by the SERCA inhibitor 
thapsigargin. Calmodulin acts as a sensor/effector to modulate the ER contacts 
mediated by VMP1/SERCA. Our study provides mechanistic insights into the 
establishment and disassociation of ER-IM contacts and reveals that VMP1 
modulates SERCA activity to control ER contacts.
