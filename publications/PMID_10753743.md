BACKGROUND: The p35-Cdk5 kinase has been implicated in a variety of functions in 
the central nervous system (CNS), including axon outgrowth, axon guidance, 
fasciculation, and neuronal migration during cortical development. In p35(-/-) 
mice, embryonic cortical neurons are unable to migrate past their predecessors, 
leading to an inversion of cortical layers in the adult cortex.
RESULTS: In order to identify molecules important for p35-Cdk5-dependent 
function in the cortex, we screened for p35-interacting proteins using the 
two-hybrid system. In this study, we report the identification of a novel 
interaction between p35 and the versatile cell adhesion signaling molecule 
beta-catenin. The p35 and beta-catenin proteins interacted in vitro and 
colocalized in transfected COS cells. In addition, the p35-Cdk5 kinase was 
associated with a beta-catenin-N-cadherin complex in the cortex. In 
N-cadherin-mediated aggregation assays, inhibition of Cdk5 kinase activity using 
the Cdk5 inhibitor roscovitine led to the formation of larger aggregates of 
embryonic cortical neurons. This finding was recapitulated in p35(-/-) cortical 
neurons, which aggregated to a greater degree than wild-type neurons. In 
addition, introduction of active p35-Cdk5 kinase into COS cells led to a 
decreased beta-catenin-N-cadherin interaction and loss of cell adhesion.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between p35-Cdk5 and an N-cadherin adhesion complex 
in cortical neurons and the modulation of N-cadherin-mediated aggregation by 
p35-Cdk5 suggests that the p35-Cdk5 kinase is involved in the regulation of 
N-cadherin-mediated adhesion in cortical neurons.
