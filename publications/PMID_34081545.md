Ribosomal protein L3-like (RPL3L) is a poorly characterized ribosomal protein 
that is exclusively expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. RPL3L is also 
downregulated in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), suggesting that it may play 
an important role in muscle biology. In this study, we investigated the role of 
RPL3L in skeletal muscle of healthy C57 and dystrophic mdx mice. We show that 
RPL3L is developmentally regulated and that intramuscular adeno-associated virus 
(AAV)-mediated RPL3L knockdown in the tibialis anterior of C57 and mdx mice 
results in increased specific force with improved resistance to eccentric 
contraction induced muscle damage in dystrophic muscles. The mechanism by which 
RPL3L knockdown improves muscle function remains unclear. Histological 
observations showed a significant increase in muscle length and decrease in 
muscle cross-sectional area after RPL3L inhibition suggesting that this 
ribosomal protein may play a role in myofiber morphology. The endogenous 
downregulation of RPL3L in DMD may be a protective mechanism that attempts to 
improve skeletal muscle function and counteract the dystrophic phenotype.
