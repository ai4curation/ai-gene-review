We use an accurate coarse-grained model for DNA and stochastic molecular 
dynamics simulations to study the pore translocation of 10-kbp-long DNA rings 
that are knotted. By monitoring various topological and physical observables we 
find that there is not one, as previously assumed, but rather two qualitatively 
different modes of knot translocation. For both modes the pore obstruction 
caused by knot passage has a brief duration and typically occurs at a late 
translocation stage. Both effects are well in agreement with experiments and can 
be rationalized with a transparent model based on the concurrent tensioning and 
sliding of the translocating knotted chains. We also observed that the duration 
of the pore obstruction event is more controlled by the knot translocation 
velocity than the knot size. These features should advance the interpretation 
and design of future experiments aimed at probing the spontaneous knotting of 
biopolymers.
