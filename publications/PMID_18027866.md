Mucinous colorectal cancers are characterized by abundant production of 
intestinal goblet cell mucin, MUC2 and frequent ectopic expression of gastric 
foveolar mucin, MUC5AC. SOX2, an HMG-box transcription factor expressed in 
gastric mucosa but not in intestine is thought to play an important role in 
regulating transcription and expression of gastric differentiation related 
genes. Herein, we investigated the possible role of SOX2 in MUC5AC transcription 
and in the development of mucinous cancers. We observed good correlation between 
SOX2 and MUC5AC message levels in most colon cancer cell lines. SOX2 expression 
significantly transactivated MUC5AC promoter/reporter constructs in 3 of 5 colon 
cancer cell lines. We also examined SOX2 expression in normal stomach and colon, 
nonmucinous and mucinous colorectal cancers, serrated polyps and conventional 
adenomas using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. SOX2 was 
expressed in the nuclei of both gastric foveolar cells and fundic glands by 
immunohistochemistry and in the cytoplasm by in situ hybridization. SOX2 was not 
expressed in normal colon but was strongly expressed in serrated polyps, 
mucinous and signet ring cell carcinomas, but rarely in nonmucinous carcinomas 
and tubular adenomas. Concordant expression of SOX2 with MUC5AC was observed in 
these lesions. Our results suggest that SOX2 is important in the upregulation of 
gastric foveolar mucin, MUC5AC in colorectal mucinous and signet ring cell 
carcinomas. In addition, the expression of both SOX2 and MUC5AC in serrated 
polyps supports the hypothesis that these polyps may be predominant precursors 
of mucinous and signet ring cell carcinomas of the colorectum.
