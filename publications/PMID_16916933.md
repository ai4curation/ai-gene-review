Innate immunity comprises physical barriers, pattern-recognition receptors, 
antimicrobial substances, phagocytosis, and fever. Here we report that increased 
temperature results in the activation of a conserved pathway involving the 
heat-shock (HS) transcription factor (HSF)-1 that enhances immunity in the 
invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans. The HSF-1 defense response is independent 
of the p38 MAPK/PMK-1 pathway and requires a system of chaperones including 
small and 90-kDa inducible HS proteins. In addition, HSF-1 is needed for the 
effects of the DAF-2 insulin-like pathway in defense to pathogens, indicating 
that interacting pathways control stress response, aging, and immunity. The 
results also show that HSF-1 is required for C. elegans immunity against 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia pestis, and Enterococcus 
faecalis, indicating that HSF-1 is part of a multipathogen defense pathway. 
Considering that several coinducers of HSF-1 are currently in clinical trials, 
this work opens the possibility that activation of HSF-1 could be used to boost 
immunity to treat infectious diseases and immunodeficiencies.
