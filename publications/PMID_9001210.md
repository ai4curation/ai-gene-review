Entry into mitosis requires the activity of the Cdc2 kinase. Cdc2 associates 
with the B-type cyclins, and the Cdc2-cyclin B heterodimer is in turn regulated 
by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of threonine 161 is required for the 
Cdc2-cyclin B complex to be catalytically active, whereas phosphorylation of 
threonine 14 and tyrosine 15 is inhibitory. Human kinases that catalyze the 
phosphorylation of threonine 161 and tyrosine 15 have been identified. Here we 
report the isolation of a novel human cDNA encoding a dual-specificity protein 
kinase (designated Myt1Hu) that preferentially phosphorylates Cdc2 on threonine 
14 in a cyclin-dependent manner. Myt1Hu is 46% identical to Myt1Xe, a kinase 
recently characterized from Xenopus laevis. Myt1Hu localizes to the endoplasmic 
reticulum and Golgi complex in HeLa cells. A stretch of hydrophobic and 
uncharged amino acids located outside the catalytic domain of Myt1Hu is the 
likely membrane-targeting domain, as its deletion results in the localization of 
Myt1Hu primarily to the nucleus.
