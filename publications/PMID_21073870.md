Ras-GEF Cdc25p has been found to be hyperphosphorylated upon glucose addition. 
This work provides evidence indicating that PKA activity positively regulates 
the degree of Cdc25p phosphorylation, and that the intracellular association of 
Cdc25p and Ras2p is independent of PKA activity. In vitro experiments revealed 
that the Ras2-GEF activity of Cdc25p is inhibited by Cdc25p phosphorylation. 
These data suggest a negative feedback mechanism by which intracellular cAMP 
synthesis is inhibited by PKA through Cdc25p phosphorylation.
