Elite overhead throwing athletes with rotator cuff tears represent a unique 
group of patients with an ultimate goal of returning to their previous level of 
competition. We hypothesized débridement of small partial-thickness rotator cuff 
tears would return the majority of elite overhead throwing athletes to their 
previous level of competition. Preoperative and intraoperative findings on 82 
professional pitchers who had undergone débridement of partial-thickness rotator 
cuff tears were evaluated using our database. We obtained return to play data on 
67 of the 82 players (82%); 51 (76%) were able to return to competitive pitching 
at the professional level and 37 (55%) were able to return to the same or higher 
level of competition. Of the 67 patients, 34 pitchers returned a questionnaire 
with a minimum followup of 18 months (mean 38 months; range 18 to 59 months). 
SF-12 scores were above average with a mean PSF-12 and MSF-12 of 55.04 and 56.49 
respectively. An Athletic Shoulder Outcome Rating Scale score of greater than 60 
was found in 76.5% of pitchers. Débridement of small partial-thickness rotator 
cuff tears allowed a majority of elite overhead throwing athletes to return to 
competitive pitching, however, returning to their previous level of competition 
remains a challenge for many of these players.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines for Authors
