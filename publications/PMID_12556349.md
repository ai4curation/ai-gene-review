We have examined the effect of a hemodialysis-induced 40% reduction in plasma 
amino acid concentrations on rates of muscle protein synthesis and breakdown in 
normal swine. Muscle protein kinetics were measured by tracer methodology using 
[(2)H(5)]phenylalanine and [1-(13)C]leucine and analysis of femoral arterial and 
venous samples and tissue biopsies. Net amino acid release by muscle was 
accelerated during dialysis. Phenylalanine utilization for muscle protein 
synthesis was reduced from the basal value of 45 +/- 8 to 25 +/- 6 nmol x 
min(-1) x 100 ml leg(-1) between 30 and 60 min after start of dialysis and was 
stimulated when amino acids were replaced while dialysis continued. Muscle 
protein breakdown was unchanged. The signal for changes in synthesis appeared to 
be changes in plasma amino acid concentrations, as intramuscular concentrations 
remained constant throughout. The changes in muscle protein synthesis were 
accompanied by a reduction or stimulation, respectively, in the guanine 
nucleotide exchange activity of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2B following 
hypoaminoacidemia vs. amino acid replacement. We conclude that a reduction in 
plasma amino acid concentrations below the normal basal value signals an 
inhibition of muscle protein synthesis and that corresponding changes in eIF2B 
activity suggest a possible role in mediating the response.
