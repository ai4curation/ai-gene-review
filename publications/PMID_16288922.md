PAC-1 is an inducible, nuclear-specific, dual-specificity mitogen-activated 
protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase that has been shown recently to be a 
transcription target of the human tumor-suppressor protein p53 in signaling 
apoptosis and growth suppression. However, its substrate specificity and 
regulation of catalytic activity thus far remain elusive. Here, we report in 
vitro characterization of PAC-1 phosphatase activity with three distinct MAP 
kinase subfamilies. We show that the recombinant PAC-1 exists in a virtually 
inactive state when alone in vitro, and dephosphorylates extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) but not p38alpha or c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase 
2 (JNK2). ERK2 dephosphorylation by PAC-1 requires association of its 
amino-terminal domain with ERK2 that results in catalytic activation of the 
phosphatase. p38alpha also interacts with but does not activate PAC-1, whereas 
JNK2 does not bind to or cause catalytic activation by PAC-1. Moreover, our 
structure-based analysis reveals that individual mutation of the conserved 
Arg294 and Arg295 that likely comprise the phosphothreonine-binding pocket in 
PAC-1 to either alanine or lysine results in a nearly complete loss of its 
phosphatase activity even in the presence of ERK2. These results suggest that 
Arg294 and Arg295 play an important role in PAC-1 catalytic activation induced 
by ERK2 binding.
