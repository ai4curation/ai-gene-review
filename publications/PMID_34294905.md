More than one-third of the world's population is exposed to Plasmodium vivax 
malaria, mainly in Asia1. P. vivax preferentially invades reticulocytes 
(immature red blood cells)2-4. Previous work has identified 11 parasite proteins 
involved in reticulocyte invasion, including erythrocyte binding protein 2 (ref. 
5) and the reticulocyte-binding proteins (PvRBPs)6-10. PvRBP2b binds to the 
transferrin receptor CD71 (ref. 11), which is selectively expressed on immature 
reticulocytes12. Here, we identified CD98 heavy chain (CD98), a heteromeric 
amino acid transporter from the SLC3 family (also known as SLCA2), as a 
reticulocyte-specific receptor for the PvRBP2a parasite ligand using mass 
spectrometry, flow cytometry, biochemical and parasite invasion assays. We 
characterized the expression level of CD98 at the surface of immature 
reticulocytes (CD71+) and identified an interaction between CD98 and PvRBP2a 
expressed at the merozoite surface. Our results identify CD98 as an additional 
host membrane protein, besides CD71, that is directly associated with P. vivax 
reticulocyte tropism. These findings highlight the potential of using PvRBP2a as 
a vaccine target against P. vivax malaria.
