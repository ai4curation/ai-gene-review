Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 5 (EBNA5) is one of the first viral proteins 
detected after primary EBV infection and has been shown to be required for 
efficient transformation of B lymphocytes. EBNA5 is a protein that has many 
suggested functions but the underlying biology remains to be clarified. To gain 
further insight into the biological roles of the proposed multifunctional EBNA5, 
we isolated EBNA5 containing protein complexes using a modified tandem affinity 
purification (TAP) method and identified the protein components by LC-MS/MS 
analysis of tryptic digests on a LTQ-FT-ICR mass spectrometer. The modified TAP 
tag contained a Protein A domain and a StrepTagII sequence separated by two 
Tobacco Etch Virus protease cleavage sites and was fused to the C-terminus of 
EBNA5. Our results confirmed the wide applicability of this two-step affinity 
purification strategy for purification of protein complexes in mammalian cells. 
A total of 147 novel putative EBNA5 interaction partners were identified, 37 of 
which were validated with LC-MS/MS in split-tag experiments or in co-immuno 
precipitates from HEK293 cell extracts. This subgroup included the 
Bcl2-associated Athanogene 2 (BAG2) co-chaperone involved in protein folding and 
renaturation, the 26S proteasome subunit 2 involved in regulation of 
ubiquitin/proteasome protein degradation, and the heterogeneous 
ribonucleoprotein M (hnRNP M) involved in pre-mRNA processing. These EBNA5 
interactors were further verified by co-immunoprecipitations from cell extracts 
of three EBV-positive lymphoblastoid lines. The combination of the Hsp70, Hsc70, 
BAG2 and 26S proteasome subunit 2 interactors suggests that EBNA5 might have a 
functional relationship with protein quality control systems that recognize 
proteins with abnormal structures and either refold them to normal conformation 
or target them for degradation. Our study also confirms previously identified 
interactors including HA95, Hsp70, Hsc70, Hsp27, HAX-1, Prolyl 4-hydroxylase, 
S3a, and alpha- and beta-tubulin.
