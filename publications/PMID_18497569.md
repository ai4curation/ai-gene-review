Plasmid-based collections of fluorescent protein fusions are valuable and 
versatile resources, facilitating systematic studies of protein localization in 
multiple genetic backgrounds. At present, however, few such collections exist 
for the analysis of protein localization in any organism. To address this 
deficiency, we present here a plasmid-based set of resources for the analysis of 
protein localization in the budding yeast. Specifically, we constructed a suite 
of low-copy destination vectors for recombination-based cloning of yeast genes 
as fluorescent protein fusions. We cloned a set of 384 yeast genes encoding 
kinases, transcription factors and signaling proteins as "recombination-ready" 
cassettes; by Gateway cloning, these genes with native promoters can be easily 
introduced into the destination vectors described above, generating 
carboxy-terminal fusions to fluorescent proteins. Using these reagents, we 
constructed a subcollection of 276 genes encoding carboxy-terminal fusions to 
yellow fluorescent protein (vYFP). This collection encompasses 14 
autophagy-related (ATG) genes, and we localized these Atgp-vYFP chimeras during 
rapamycin-induced autophagy. To illustrate further the utility of this 
collection as a tool in exploring the functions and interactions of proteins in 
a pathway, we localized a subset of these Atg-vYFP chimeras in a strain deleted 
for the scaffolding protein Atg11p. In addition, we validated previous results 
identifying the integral membrane protein Atg9p at the pre-autophagosomal 
structure upon overexpression of ATG11 and upon deletion of ATG1. Collectively, 
this plasmid-based resource of yeast gene-vYFP fusions provides an initial 
toolkit for a variety of systematic and large-scale localization studies 
exploring pathway biology in the budding yeast.
