IL-2 is a cytokine that functions as a growth factor and central regulator in 
the immune system and mediates its effects through ligand-induced 
hetero-trimerization of the receptor subunits IL-2R alpha, IL-2R beta, and 
gamma(c). Here, we describe the crystal structure of the trimeric assembly of 
the human IL-2 receptor ectodomains in complex with IL-2 at 3.0 A resolution. 
The quaternary structure is consistent with a stepwise assembly from IL-2/IL-2R 
alpha to IL-2/IL-2R alpha/IL-2R beta to IL-2/IL-2R alpha/IL-2R beta/gamma(c). 
The IL-2R alpha subunit forms the largest of the three IL-2/IL-2R interfaces, 
which, together with the high abundance of charge-charge interactions, 
correlates well with the rapid association rate and high-affinity interaction of 
IL-2R alpha with IL-2 at the cell surface. Surprisingly, IL-2R alpha makes no 
contacts with IL-2R beta or gamma(c), and only minor changes are observed in the 
IL-2 structure in response to receptor binding. These findings support the 
principal role of IL-2R alpha to deliver IL-2 to the signaling complex and act 
as regulator of signal transduction. Cooperativity in assembly of the final 
quaternary complex is easily explained by the extraordinarily extensive set of 
interfaces found within the fully assembled IL-2 signaling complex, which nearly 
span the entire length of the IL-2R beta and gamma(c) subunits. Helix A of IL-2 
wedges tightly between IL-2R beta and gamma(c) to form a three-way junction that 
coalesces into a composite binding site for the final gamma(c) recruitment. The 
IL-2/gamma(c) interface itself exhibits the smallest buried surface and the 
fewest hydrogen bonds in the complex, which is consistent with its promiscuous 
use in other cytokine receptor complexes.
