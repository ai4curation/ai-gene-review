PA28 is a gamma-interferon-induced complex that associates with the 20S 
proteasome and stimulates breakdown of small peptides. Recent 
immunoprecipitation studies indicate that, in vivo, PA28 also exists in larger 
complexes that also contain the 19S particle, which is required for 
ATP-ubiquitin-dependent degradation of proteins. However, because of its 
lability, the structure and properties of this larger complex remain unclear. 
Here, we demonstrate that, in vitro, PA28 can associate with 'singly capped' 26S 
(i.e. 19S-20S) proteasomes. Electron microscopy of the resulting structures 
revealed one PA28 ring at one end of the 20S particle and a 19S complex at the 
other. These hybrid complexes show enhanced hydrolysis of small peptides, but no 
significant increase in rates of protein breakdown. Nevertheless, during 
breakdown of proteins, the complexes containing PA28alphabeta or PA28alpha 
generated a pattern of peptides different from those generated by 26S 
proteasomes, without altering mean product length. Presumably, this change in 
peptides produced accounts for the capacity of PA28 to enhance antigen 
presentation.
