It has been well established that estrogen is involved in the pathophysiology of 
breast cancer. Estrogen receptor (ER) alpha appears to promote the proliferation 
of cancer tissues, while ERbeta can protect against the mitogenic effect of 
estrogen in breast tissue. The expression status of ERalpha and ERbeta may 
greatly influence on the development, treatment, and prognosis of breast cancer. 
Previous studies have indicated that the deleted in breast cancer 1 
(DBC1/KIAA1967) gene product has roles in regulating functions of nuclear 
receptors. The gene encoding DBC1 is a candidate for tumor suppressor identified 
by genetic search for breast cancer. Caspase-dependent processing of DBC1 
promotes apoptosis, and depletion of the endogenous DBC1 negatively regulates 
p53-dependent apoptosis through its specific inhibition of SIRT1. In addition, 
DBC1 modulates ERalpha expression and promotes breast cancer cell survival by 
binding to ERalpha. Here we report an ERbeta-specific repressive function of 
DBC1. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies show that ERbeta and 
DBC1 interact in a ligand-independent manner similar to ERalpha. In vitro 
pull-down assays revealed a direct interaction between DBC1 amino-terminus and 
activation function-1/2 domain of ERbeta. Although DBC1 shows no influence on 
the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function of ERalpha, the 
expression of DBC1 negatively regulates the ligand-dependent transcriptional 
activation function of ERbetain vivo, and RNA interference-mediated depletion of 
DBC1 stimulates the transactivation function of ERbeta. These results implicate 
the principal role of DBC1 in regulating ERbeta-dependent gene expressions.
