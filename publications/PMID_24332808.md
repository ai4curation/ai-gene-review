PRP19 is a ubiquitin ligase involved in pre-mRNA splicing and the DNA damage 
response (DDR). Although the role for PRP19 in splicing is well characterized, 
its role in the DDR remains elusive. Through a proteomic screen for proteins 
that interact with RPA-coated single-stranded DNA (RPA-ssDNA), we identified 
PRP19 as a sensor of DNA damage. PRP19 directly binds RPA and localizes to DNA 
damage sites via RPA, promoting RPA ubiquitylation in a DNA-damage-induced 
manner. PRP19 facilitates the accumulation of ATRIP, the regulatory partner of 
the ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, at DNA damage 
sites. Depletion of PRP19 compromised the phosphorylation of ATR substrates, 
recovery of stalled replication forks, and progression of replication forks on 
damaged DNA. Importantly, PRP19 mutants that cannot bind RPA or function as an 
E3 ligase failed to support the ATR response, revealing that PRP19 drives ATR 
activation by acting as an RPA-ssDNA-sensing ubiquitin ligase during the DDR.
