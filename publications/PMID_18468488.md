The T-cell co-receptor cytotoxic T-cell antigen 4 (CTLA-4) has a strong 
inhibitory role as shown by the lymphoproliferative phenotype of 
CTLA-4-deficient mice. Despite its potent effects on T-cell function, CTLA-4 is 
primarily an intracellular antigen whose surface expression is tightly regulated 
by restricted trafficking to the cell surface and rapid internalisation. 
Recently, several signalling molecules such as Trim, PLD, ARF-1 and TIRC7 have 
been described to be involved in the transport of CTLA-4 to the cell surface. 
Minor changes in surface expression levels have major effects on the outcome of 
T-cell activation. Optimal regulation of CTLA-4 surface expression is crucial 
for the balance of stimulatory and inhibitory signals to maximize protective 
immune responses while maintaining immunological tolerance and preventing 
autoimmunity.
