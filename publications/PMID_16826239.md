The coordination of chromatin assembly with DNA replication, which is essential 
for genomic stability, requires the combined activation of histone deposition 
with the firing of replication origins. We report here the direct interaction of 
chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF1), a key factor involved in histone deposition, 
with the replication kinase Cdc7-Dbf4. We isolated a complex containing both the 
largest subunit of CAF1 (p150) and the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase specifically in S phase 
and thus prove the existence of this interaction in vivo. We then show that the 
Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase efficiently phosphorylates p150. This event induces a change in 
p150 oligomerization state, which promotes binding to proliferating cell nuclear 
antigen (PCNA). Conversely, CAF1 recruitment is reduced in a PCNA/DNA loading 
assay using Cdc7-depleted extracts. Our data define p150 as a new target for 
this kinase with implications for the coordination between DNA replication and 
CAF1 functions.

Abstract

The coordination of chromatin assembly with DNA replication, which is essential for genomic stability, requires the combined activation of histone deposition with the firing of replication origins. We report here the direct interaction of chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF1), a key factor involved in histone deposition, with the replication kinase Cdc7-Dbf4. We isolated a complex containing both the largest subunit of CAF1 (p150) and the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase specifically in S phase and thus prove the existence of this interaction in vivo . We then show that the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase efficiently phosphorylates p150. This event induces a change in p150 oligomerization state, which promotes binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Conversely, CAF1 recruitment is reduced in a PCNA/DNA loading assay using Cdc7-depleted extracts. Our data define p150 as a new target for this kinase with implications for the coordination between DNA replication and CAF1 functions.

Introduction

Eukaryotic genomes are organized into chromatin ( Kornberg, 1977 ), the dynamics of which have proved to be of importance in genome function ( Vaquero et al , 2003 ). Histone deposition onto DNA is the first step in the process of chromatin assembly to build up the core particle of chromatin, which consists of 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer (H2A–H2B) 2 (H3–H4) 2 . Biochemical approaches have identified crucial factors and histone chaperones involved in this process ( Mello & Almouzni, 2001 ; Loyola & Almouzni, 2004 ). Among these, the conserved chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF1) composed of three histone-binding proteins, p150, p60 and p48 ( Kaufman et al , 1995 ; Verreault et al , 1996 ) is the only characterized histone chaperone that promotes nucleosome assembly coupled to DNA synthesis in the context of DNA replication ( Smith & Stillman, 1989 ) and nucleotide excision repair ( Gaillard et al , 1996 ; Green & Almouzni, 2003 ). In both cases, its targeting to sites of DNA synthesis involves a physical interaction between its largest subunit, p150, and the homotrimeric sliding clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a DNA polymerase accessory factor ( Shibahara & Stillman, 1999 ; Moggs et al , 2000 ). Thus, the interaction between p150 and PCNA represents an attractive control point ( Mello & Almouzni, 2001 ) that could be exploited for the coordination of CAF1 recruitment with the activation of each replication origin or with an individual repair site. How such regulation can take place remains an open issue. Interestingly, both p150 and p60 are phosphoproteins ( Smith & Stillman, 1991 ) and CAF1 function in vitro can be regulated by cell-cycle kinases/phosphatases ( Martini et al , 1998 ; Keller & Krude, 2000 ). Moreover, p150 can dimerize in vitro , another property crucial for its function ( Quivy et al , 2001 ). Here, we investigate how such modifications might participate in regulating CAF1 function. We show that Dumb bell former 4 (Dbf4), a regulatory subunit of the cell division cycle 7 (Cdc7) kinase, which is essential for initiation of DNA replication ( Bell & Dutta, 2002 ), interacts directly with and phosphorylates p150 in vitro . This phosphorylation stabilizes p150 as a monomer and favours its interaction with PCNA, which can thus promote CAF1 recruitment at single-strand DNA breaks (intermediates found at replication and repair sites). We discuss the implications of our findings for both CAF1 and Cdc7-Dbf4 functions.

Discussion

In this study, we show the existence of a novel link between CAF1 and Cdc7-Dbf4, a key enzyme involved in the initiation of DNA replication. Our data enable us to propose a model in which p150 modification by Cdc7-Dbf4 controls CAF1 interaction with PCNA, which occurs precisely during S phase when Cdc7-Dbf4 activity is at a maximum. Such a control would participate in the tight coordination between DNA replication and CAF1 function to ensure the accurate perpetuation of genetic and epigenetic information and to avoid an excess of unused histone pools ( Groth et al , 2005 ; Gunjan et al , 2005 ).

We hypothesize that p150 oscillates between monomeric and dimeric forms. After Cdc7-Dbf4 phosphorylation of p150, the transition towards a monomeric state would favour an interaction with PCNA and thus ensure targeting of CAF1 to sites of DNA synthesis. We have focused our attention here on the initial event—PCNA binding—but it is clear that other conformational transitions are required. First, the necessity of a switch back to a dimeric state for p150 is supported by the fact that the constitutive monomeric p150Δ mutant cannot support histone deposition ( Quivy et al , 2001 ) whereas it binds to PCNA (this work). Second, a protein phosphatase 1 activity, which could favour the transition from a monomeric to a dimeric state of p150, by antagonizing Cdc7-Dbf4 phosphorylation, has been reported to be necessary for CAF1 activity ( Keller & Krude, 2000 ). Thus, one should not consider the monomeric or the dimeric forms of p150 as the ‘active' or ‘inactive' form of p150, but rather consider both conformations to be a requirement for CAF1 activity. Future work should aim at deciphering how the sequence of events that follow the targeting of CAF1 onto DNA can be orchestrated by the successive action of kinases/phosphatase, protein–protein interactions and/or other signals.

Importantly, we should also consider that the impact of Cdc7 in the recruitment of p150 to PCNA at the replication site could occur at a level that is distinct from nucleosome assembly. In mammals, p150 is involved in the deposition of a replicative pool of HP1α during replication of pericentric heterochromatin ( Quivy et al , 2004 ), and a connection between HP1 and Cdc7-Dbf4 has already been reported in Schizosaccharomyces pombe ( Bailis et al , 2003 ). We thus propose that the effect of Cdc7 on p150 might relate to heterochromatin functions. We believe that this work could open up avenues concerning a new role for the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase in connection to p150 function, with implications for temporal and spatial coordination of nucleosome assembly, DNA synthesis and/or heterochromatin organization in the context of DNA damage or DNA replication.

Methods

Cells. The 293Flp-In cell line stably expressing an epitope-tagged p150–Flag was generated with the Flp-In system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; supplementary information online). Cells were synchronized in G1 phase by a single thymidine block (5 mM, 20 h). S-phase cells were collected 6 h after release from this block in the presence of 30 μM deoxycytidine. Cells were synchronized in G2/M phase by adding nocodazole (100 ng/ml, 20 h). FACScan and CellQuest software allowed cell-cycle analysis (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). p150 and mutant p150Δ complementary DNAs were cloned into the peGFPc2 vector (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) to generate GFP–p150 and GFP–p150Δ expression plasmids. For transfection, we used the Effectene reagent (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany).

Crosslinking assays. We crosslinked purified His 6 –p150 and His 6 –p150Δ (100 ng) for 30 min at 23°C with 0.25, 1 or 2 mM EGS (ethylene glycol bis[succinimidyl succinate]; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) and terminated the reaction with 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5). We then added sample loading buffer and analysed reaction products by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

PCNA/DNA loading assay. For PCNA/DNA loading assays, we used DNase-1-nicked DNA (300 ng of DNA) linked to paramagnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway; Mello et al , 2004 ) and incubated with S100 extracts (120 μg) and purified His 6 –p150 (75 ng) at 37°C. After washes with 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes–KOH (pH 7.6), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% N -lauroyl sarcosine and 0.05% NP-40, DNA-bound proteins were analysed by western blot.
