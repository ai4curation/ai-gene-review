Compared to mammals, insects, and plants, relatively little is known about 
innate immune responses in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Previous work 
showed that Salmonella enterica serovars cause a persistent infection in the C. 
elegans intestine that triggers gonadal programmed cell death (PCD) and that C. 
elegans cell death (ced) mutants are more susceptible to Salmonella-mediated 
killing. To further dissect the role of PCD in C. elegans innate immunity, we 
identified both C. elegans and S. enterica factors that affect the elicitation 
of Salmonella-induced PCD. Salmonella-elicited PCD was shown to require the C. 
elegans homolog of the mammalian p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
encoded by the pmk-1 gene. Inactivation of pmk-1 by RNAi blocked 
Salmonella-elicited PCD, and epistasis analysis showed that CED-9 lies 
downstream of PMK-1. Wild-type Salmonella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was also 
shown to be required for the elicitation of PCD, as well as for persistence of 
Salmonella in the C. elegans intestine. However, a presumptive C. elegans TOLL 
signaling pathway did not appear to be required for the PCD response to 
Salmonella. These results establish a PMK-1-dependant PCD pathway as a C. 
elegans innate immune response to Salmonella.
