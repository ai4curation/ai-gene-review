Many actin binding proteins have a modular architecture, and calponin-homology 
(CH) domains are one such structurally conserved module found in numerous 
proteins that interact with F-actin. The manner in which CH-domains bind F-actin 
has been controversial. Using cryo-EM and a single-particle approach to helical 
reconstruction, we have generated 12-A-resolution maps of F-actin alone and 
F-actin decorated with a fragment of human fimbrin (L-plastin) containing tandem 
CH-domains. The high resolution allows an unambiguous fit of the crystal 
structure of fimbrin into the map. The interaction between fimbrin ABD2 (actin 
binding domain 2) and F-actin is different from any interaction previously 
observed or proposed for tandem CH-domain proteins, showing that the structural 
conservation of the CH-domains does not lead to a conserved mode of interaction 
with F-actin. Both the stapling of adjacent actin protomers and the additional 
closure of the nucleotide binding cleft in F-actin when the fimbrin fragment 
binds may explain how fimbrin can stabilize actin filaments. A mechanism is 
proposed where ABD1 of fimbrin becomes activated for binding a second actin 
filament after ABD2 is bound to a first filament, and this can explain how 
mutations of residues buried in the interface between ABD2 and ABD1 can rescue 
temperature-sensitive defects in actin.
