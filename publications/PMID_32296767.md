Adrenomedullin (AM) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors are 
critically important for metabolism, vascular tone, and inflammatory response. 
AM receptors are also required for normal lymphatic and blood vascular 
development and angiogenesis. They play a pivotal role in embryo implantation 
and fertility and can provide protection against hypoxic and oxidative stress. 
CGRP and AM receptors are heterodimers of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor 
(CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) (CGRPR), as well as 
RAMP2 or RAMP3 (AM1R and AM2R, respectively). However, the mechanistic basis for 
RAMP modulation of CLR phenotype is unclear. In this study, we report the 
cryo-EM structure of the AM1R in complex with AM and Gs at a global resolution 
of 3.0 Å, and structures of the AM2R in complex with either AM or 
intermedin/adrenomedullin 2 (AM2) and Gs at 2.4 and 2.3 Å, respectively. The 
structures reveal distinctions in the primary orientation of the extracellular 
domains (ECDs) relative to the receptor core and distinct positioning of 
extracellular loop 3 (ECL3) that are receptor-dependent. Analysis of dynamic 
data present in the cryo-EM micrographs revealed additional distinctions in the 
extent of mobility of the ECDs. Chimeric exchange of the linker region of the 
RAMPs connecting the TM helix and the ECD supports a role for this segment in 
controlling receptor phenotype. Moreover, a subset of the motions of the ECD 
appeared coordinated with motions of the G protein relative to the receptor 
core, suggesting that receptor ECD dynamics could influence G protein 
interactions. This work provides fundamental advances in our understanding of 
GPCR function and how this can be allosterically modulated by accessory 
proteins.
