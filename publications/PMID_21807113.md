The c-Myc oncoprotein plays critical roles in multiple biological processes by 
controlling cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and metabolism. 
Especially, c-Myc is frequently overexpressed in many human cancers and widely 
involved in tumorigenesis. However, how the post-translational modifications, 
especially acetylation of c-Myc, contribute to its activity in the leukemia 
cells remains largely unknown. Sirt1, a NAD-dependent class III histone 
deacetylase, has a paradoxical role in tumorigenesis by deacetylating several 
transcription factors, including p53, E2F1 and forkhead proteins. In this study, 
we show that Sirt1 interacts physically with the C-terminus of c-Myc and 
deacetylates c-Myc both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the deacetylation of 
c-Myc by Sirt1 promotes its association with Max, a partner essential for its 
activation, thereby facilitating c-Myc transactivation activity on hTERT 
promoter. Finally, inhibition of endogenous Sirt1 in K562 cells by either RNAi 
or its inhibitor NAM causes the overall decrease of c-Myc target genes 
expression, including hTERT, cyclinD2 and LDHA, which further suppress cell 
proliferation and arrest cell cycle at G1/S phase. Thus, our results demonstrate 
the positive effect of Sirt1 on c-Myc activity by efficiently enhancing 
c-Myc/Max association in human leukemia cell line K562, suggesting a potential 
role of Sirt1 in tumorigenesis.
