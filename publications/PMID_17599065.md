The c-Myc oncoprotein promotes cell growth by enhancing ribosomal biogenesis 
through upregulation of RNA polymerases I-, II-, and III-dependent 
transcription. Overexpression of c-Myc and aberrant ribosomal biogenesis leads 
to deregulated cell growth and tumorigenesis. Hence, c-Myc activity and 
ribosomal biogenesis must be regulated in cells. Here, we show that ribosomal 
protein L11, a component of the large subunit of the ribosome, controls c-Myc 
function through a negative feedback mechanism. L11 is transcriptionally induced 
by c-Myc, and overexpression of L11 inhibits c-Myc-induced transcription and 
cell proliferation. Conversely, reduction of endogenous L11 by siRNA increases 
these c-Myc activities. Mechanistically, L11 binds to the Myc box II (MB II), 
inhibits the recruitment of the coactivator TRRAP, and reduces histone H4 
acetylation at c-Myc target gene promoters. In response to serum stimulation or 
serum starvation, L11 and TRRAP display inverse promoter-binding profiles. In 
addition, L11 regulates c-Myc levels. These results identify L11 as a feedback 
inhibitor of c-Myc and suggest a novel role for L11 in regulating c-Myc-enhanced 
ribosomal biogenesis.

The c-Myc oncoprotein promotes cell growth by enhancing ribosomal biogenesis through upregulation of RNA polymerases I-, II-, and III-dependent transcription. Overexpression of c-Myc and aberrant ribosomal biogenesis leads to deregulated cell growth and tumorigenesis. Hence, c-Myc activity and ribosomal biogenesis must be regulated in cells.

L11 is transcriptionally induced by c-Myc, and overexpression of L11 inhibits c-Myc-induced transcription and cell proliferation. Conversely, reduction of endogenous L11 by siRNA increases these c-Myc activities. Mechanistically, L11 binds to the Myc box II (MB II), inhibits the recruitment of the coactivator TRRAP, and reduces histone H4 acetylation at c-Myc target gene promoters. In response to serum stimulation or serum starvation, L11 and TRRAP display inverse promoter-binding profiles. In addition, L11 regulates c-Myc levels. These results identify L11 as a feedback inhibitor of c-Myc and suggest a novel role for L11 in regulating c-Myc-enhanced ribosomal biogenesis.

Introduction

c-Myc is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in proliferation, cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, and neoplastic transformation (reviewed by Grandori et al , 2000 ; Pelengaris et al , 2002a ; Adhikary and Eilers, 2005 ). Maintaining the proper level of c-Myc expression is essential for normal cellular functions and animal development, as homozygous deletion of c-myc is embryonic lethal in mice ( Davis et al , 1993 ) and cells lacking c-Myc exit the cell cycle and do not proliferate ( de Alboran et al , 2001 ; Trumpp et al , 2001 ). However, deregulated expression of c-Myc contributes to tumorigenesis ( Pelengaris et al , 2002b ; Adhikary and Eilers, 2005 ). Overexpression of c-Myc is observed in various human tumors (reviewed by Nesbit et al , 1999 ; Pelengaris et al , 2002a ). Constitutive or inducible expression of c- myc transgene leads to neoplastic pre-malignant and malignant phenotypes in mice ( Adams et al , 1985 ; Felsher and Bishop, 1999 ; Pelengaris et al , 1999 , 2002b ). Thus, precise regulation of c-Myc expression and transcriptional activity is critical for normal cellular function.

Two critical domains are required for c-Myc biological activity. The C-terminal basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH/LZ) domain of c-Myc heterodimerizes with its partner protein Max ( Amati et al , 1992 ; Luscher and Larsson, 1999 ; Pelengaris et al , 2002a ; Adhikary and Eilers, 2005 ) and mediates sequence-specific DNA recognition of E-box elements. The N-terminal transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of c-Myc contains two conserved segments termed Myc box (MB) I and II. The MB I is implicated in regulation of c-Myc protein stability through a phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitylation-mediated proteasomal degradation pathway, which involves multiple protein kinases, protein phosphotase 2A, prolyl isomerase Pin 1, and Fbw7 containing E3 ubiquitin ligase ( Moberg et al , 2004 ; Sears, 2004 ; Welcker et al , 2004 ; Yada et al , 2004 ; Yeh et al , 2004 ; Arnold and Sears, 2006 , and reviewed by Dai et al , 2006a ). The MB II is critical for all known c-Myc functions. Several critical coactivators of c-Myc that have been shown to be essential for c-Myc-mediated transcription bind to the MB II. First, TRRAP ( McMahon et al , 1998 ), a core component of the TIP60 and GCN5 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, is recruited to c-Myc target gene promoters through binding to MB II. These complexes mediate histone acetylation and facilitate transcription of c-Myc target genes ( McMahon et al , 2000 ; Park et al , 2001 ; Frank et al , 2003 ; Bernardi et al , 2004 ). Second, TIP48/TIP49 ATPases, components of chromatin remodeling complexes, also interact with c-Myc at MB II and their ATPase activity is required for c-Myc-induced transformation ( Wood et al , 2000 ). Third, the F-box protein Skp2, a component of the SCF skp2 E3 ligase complex, binds to c-Myc at the MB II and mediates its ubiquitylation and degradation ( Kim et al , 2003 ; von der Lehr et al , 2003 ). However, Skp2-mediated degradation is required for c-Myc transactivation, suggesting that Skp2 is an important coactivator for c-Myc-regulated transcription as well ( Kim et al , 2003 ; von der Lehr et al , 2003 ). Recently, an HECT domain containing E3 ligase, named HectH9, has been shown to bind to the TAD of c-Myc and to ubiquitylate this protein through a Lysine-63 linked ubiquitin ( Adhikary et al , 2005 ). This ubiquitylation also enhances c-Myc activity by facilitating recruitment of coactivator p300 acetyltransferase ( Adhikary et al , 2005 ). Hence, the N-terminal TAD is crucial for regulating c-Myc stability and activity.

The importance of c-Myc activity for normal cell growth may be in part attributed to its recently identified role in ribosomal biogenesis (reviewed by Ruggero and Pandolfi, 2003 ; Oskarsson and Trumpp, 2005 ). Ribosomal biogenesis is a tightly regulated process requiring coordinated transcription mediated by all three RNA polymerases to ensure efficient and accurate production of ribosomes (reviewed by Ruggero and Pandolfi, 2003 ; White, 2005 ). Deregulation of ribosomal biogenesis also contributes to tumorigenesis (reviewed by Ruggero and Pandolfi, 2003 ). c-Myc appears to be a major player in controlling ribosomal biogenesis, as it has been shown to regulate transcription by these RNA polymerases ( Adhikary and Eilers, 2005 ; Oskarsson and Trumpp, 2005 ). Specifically, c-Myc has recently been shown to enhance Pol I-catalyzed rRNA synthesis ( Arabi et al , 2005 ; Grandori et al , 2005 ; Grewal et al , 2005 ) as well as Pol III-mediated 5S and tRNA transcription ( Gomez-Roman et al , 2003 ). In addition, Pol II-mediated transcription of genes encoding ribosome assembly proteins, and translation initiation and elongation factors is stimulated by c-Myc as well ( Coller et al , 2000 ; Guo et al , 2000 ; Boon et al , 2001 ; Menssen and Hermeking, 2002 ). In spite of the expanding list of c-Myc target genes, it remains unclear how c-Myc activity is regulated during ribosomal biogenesis to maintain homeostasis.

Here, we report that ribosomal protein L11 controls c-Myc function through a negative feedback mechanism. L11 is transcriptionally activated by c-Myc, whereas L11 in turn inhibits c-Myc transactivational activity by binding to the MB II region of c-Myc and inhibiting the recruitment of the TRRAP coactivator and subsequent histone H4 acetylation at the c-Myc target gene promoters. Consistently, reduction of endogenous L11 increases c-Myc activity. Our results demonstrate that L11 is a feedback inhibitor of c-Myc.

Discussion

One of the most elegant natural mechanisms for cellular homeostasis is feedback regulation that allows autoregulation of a cellular process. Our study as described here unveils, for the first time, that L11, a component of the ribosome, controls c-Myc activity through a feedback-inhibitory mechanism. Overexpression of L11 inhibits the transactivation activity of c-Myc ( Figure 1 ), whereas reduction of L11 by siRNA induces this activity ( Figure 7 ). Interestingly, the expression of l11 gene itself is induced by c-Myc ( Figure 9 ), and thus forming a negative autoregulatory feedback loop ( Figure 9H ). Mechanistically, we show that L11 binds to c-Myc at the MB II motif ( Figure 3C and D ), co-resides with c-Myc at its target gene promoters ( Figure 4 ), prevents the recruitment of the coactivator TRRAP by c-Myc, and consequently inhibits histone H4 acetylation at these promoters ( Figure 5 ). Thus, a key mechanism underlying the inhibition of c-Myc activity by L11 appears to involve L11 association with c-Myc at its target gene promoters, where it conceals c-Myc MB II, preventing the loading of TRRAP-containing HATs and remodeling of histones to a more transcriptionally active state.

The inhibition of c-Myc activity by overexpression of L11 is not due to a reduction of c-Myc protein levels, as L11 increased the total levels of ectopic c-Myc in cells ( Figures 7G, H and 8C ), although the soluble c-Myc was reduced by overexpression of L11 ( Supplementary Figures S1A and Figures 2A , 3A and 8C ). One explanation for these results is that L11 may block c-Myc degradation similar to the case of inhibition of MDM2 degradation by L11 ( Dai et al , 2006b ). It has been shown that c-Myc degradation occurs at the nucleolus ( Welcker et al , 2004 ). We observed that overexpression of L11 relocalizes c-Myc into the nucleolus (data not shown). Thus, it is possible that L11 may block the degradation of c-Myc at the nucleolus and lead to the accumulation of c-Myc in this compartment. Another possibility is that binding of L11 to c-Myc may block Skp2 binding to c-Myc, as Spk2 also binds to the MB II of c-Myc ( Kim et al , 2003 ; von der Lehr et al , 2003 ). Skp2 mediates c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation. This degradation is required for c-Myc transactivation activity ( Kim et al , 2003 ; von der Lehr et al , 2003 ). Therefore, it is possible that, by blocking Skp2-mediated c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation pathway, L11 impairs the dynamic turnover of c-Myc, most possibly at the promoters of c-Myc target genes. Consequently, L11 inhibits c-Myc activity. Although this hypothesis would be interesting for future research, our results as presented here demonstrate that binding to the MB II represents a crucial mechanism for L11 to inhibit c-Myc activity, as this binding would displace the binding of the c-Myc coactivator TRRAP to the same region.

Surprisingly, knocking down endogenous L11 also increased the level of c-Myc ( Figure 7E and F ). This increase is probably, in part, due to the increase of c-myc mRNA level when knocking down L11 (data not shown). It remains unclear how L11 regulates c-myc mRNA levels. One possibility is that L11 may regulate c-Myc transcription. It has been recently shown that several Drosophila ribosomal proteins are associated with linker histone H1 and suppress transcription of a set of genes ( Ni et al , 2006 ). Interestingly, we recently purified an L11-associated complex that also contains the linker histone H1 using an affinity purification method (data not shown). Thus, one of our future studies would be to test whether L11 could associate with histone H1 in chromatin and repress c-Myc transcription. Another testable possibility would be that L11 might regulate c-myc mRNA turnover. However, the regulation of c-myc mRNA and protein by knockdown of L11, although worthwhile for further investigation, would not discount or conflict with our findings that L11 represses c-Myc activity by directly binding to this protein as discussed above. Also, this regulation may be through an indirect and more complex process, as overexpression of L11 did not simply reduce endogenous c-Myc protein levels ( Figure 5A ), as discussed in the result section. Taken together, at least two mechanisms may account for the inhibitory effect of L11 on c-Myc: inhibiting the recruitment of TRRAP to c-Myc target gene promoters by directly binding to the MB II domain of c-Myc, and regulating c-Myc levels.

The regulation of c-Myc by L11 is specific to L11, because other tested ribosomal proteins, such as L29, L30, and S12, did not bind to c-Myc ( Figure 8A ). Further analyses show that overexpression of L29 neither changes the c-Myc protein levels nor reduces its activity in regulating the expression of the target gene, nucleolin ( Figure 8B and C ). Also, unlike the case of L11 knockdown, L29 knockdown does not increase c-Myc levels and its activity ( Figure 8D and E ). Thus, not all individual ribosomal proteins would regulate c-Myc. Although our study does not absolutely rule out the possibility that other untested ribosomal proteins may also play a role in regulating c-Myc activity similar to that of L11, our results as presented strongly demonstrate the role of L11 in repressing c-Myc activity as a feedback regulator.

The inhibition of c-Myc activity by L11 is also suggested in cells in response to growth signals. In early response to serum stimulation, c-Myc levels rapidly increased, whereas L11 binding to c-Myc target gene promoter inversely decreased ( Figure 6C ), indicating that the repression of L11 on c-Myc activity is de-repressed at a stage when c-Myc activity is required for cells to proliferate. The elevated L11 molecules by this enhanced c-Myc activity might be used for limiting c-Myc activity at the later stage of serum stimulation to prevent aberrant cell growth. Consistent with this notion, when growth signals are removed, as in the case of serum starvation ( Figure 6D ), L11 increasingly associates with c-Myc in a target gene promoter to block TRRAP binding to the same promoter, thus leading to inhibition of c-Myc-dependent transcription. It has been shown that serum starvation led to release of L11 from ribosome ( Bhat et al , 2004 ). Thus, growth inhibition would reduce ribosomal biogenesis and result in enhanced free form of L11 to target c-Myc. Another possibility is that post-transcriptional modification may play a role in regulating the L11-c-Myc interaction at c-Myc target gene promoter in response to growth signals. Nevertheless, these results suggest that L11-c-Myc regulatory loop is highly regulated in cells.

In summary, our findings extend the role of L11 in cell proliferation regulation beyond regulating the MDM2-p53 feedback loop ( Figure 9H ) ( Lohrum et al , 2003 ; Zhang et al , 2003 ; Bhat et al , 2004 ; Dai et al , 2006b ). In this respect, L11 resembles the function of ARF, which regulates both the MDM2-p53 pathway ( Sherr and Weber, 2000 ) and c-Myc function ( Datta et al , 2004 ; Qi et al , 2004 ); but L11 works independently of ARF and p53. It is likely that L11 may primarily act as a ‘sensor' of aberrant ribosomal biogenesis, whereas ARF primarily acts as a ‘sensor' of oncogenic stress ( Sherr and Weber, 2000 ). Because L11 activates p53 ( Lohrum et al , 2003 ; Zhang et al , 2003 ) and represses c-Myc activity, one important question would be if L11 could prevent cell transformation. More studies, such as genetic studies in animals and identification of L11 mutations in human cancers, are necessary to verify this prediction.
