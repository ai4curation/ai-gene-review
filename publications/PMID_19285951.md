Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) is a plasma protein implicated in the innate 
immune system. In recent studies, we showed that either HRG, or the Arg23-Lys66 
glycopeptide derived from HRG, in concert with concanavalin A (Con A), promotes 
a morphological change and adhesion of the human leukemic T-cell line MOLT-4 to 
culture dishes, and that cell surface glycosaminoglycan or Fcgamma receptors do 
not participate in this cellular event. In the present study, we identified the 
alpha-subunit of ATP synthase as one of the HRG-binding proteins on the surface 
of T-cells by HRG-derived glycopeptide affinity chromatography and by a peptide 
mass finger printing method. HRG specifically interacted with mitochondrial ATP 
synthase with a dissociation constant of 66 nM. The presence of alpha- and 
beta-subunits of ATP synthase on the plasma membrane of MOLT-4 cell was 
demonstrated by immunofluorescent staining and FACS analysis. The HRG/Con 
A-induced morphological changes of MOLT-4 cells were specifically inhibited by a 
monoclonal antibody against the beta-subunit of ATP synthase. These results 
strongly suggest that the cell surface ATP synthase functions as a binding 
protein for HRG on MOLT-4 cells, which is required for the morphological changes 
observed in MOLT-4 cells following treatment with HRG/Con A.
