The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein is a 
chloride channel localized at the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells. We 
previously described that syntaxin 8, an endosomal SNARE (Soluble 
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor) protein, 
interacts with CFTR and regulates its trafficking to the plasma membrane and 
hence its channel activity. Syntaxin 8 belongs to the endosomal SNARE complex 
which also contains syntaxin 7, vti1b and VAMP8. Here, we report that these four 
endosomal SNARE proteins physically and functionally interact with CFTR. In 
LLC-PK1 cells transfected with CFTR and in Caco-2 cells endogenously expressing 
CFTR, we demonstrated that endosomal SNARE protein overexpression inhibits CFTR 
activity but not swelling- or calcium-activated iodide efflux, indicating a 
specific effect upon CFTR activity. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments 
in LLC-PK1-CFTR cells showed that CFTR and SNARE proteins belong to a same 
complex and pull-down assays showed that VAMP8 and vti1b preferentially interact 
with CFTR N-terminus tail. By cell surface biotinylation and immunofluorescence 
experiments, we evidenced that endosomal SNARE overexpression disturbs CFTR 
apical targeting. Finally, we found a colocalization of CFTR and endosomal SNARE 
proteins in Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, suggesting a new role for 
endosomal SNARE proteins in CFTR trafficking in epithelial cells.
