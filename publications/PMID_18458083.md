Acyl-CoA-dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferases play an important role in 
attaining the appropriate molecular species of phospholipids. A number of genes 
encoding these activities were recently identified. It has become clear that 
multiple genes can encode one enzymatic activity and that a given gene may 
encode multiple activities. Here we report the identification of a gene encoding 
a mammalian acyl-CoA-dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferase with prominent 
activity toward ethanolamine-containing lysophospholipids, which we termed 
acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylethanolamine acyltransferase 2, LPEAT2 (previously 
annotated as AYTL3 or AGPAT7). LPEAT2 is predominantly expressed in brain, 
coinciding with an enrichment of phosphatidylethanolamine in this tissue. 
Ectopic expression of LPEAT2 in mammalian HEK293T cells led to a dramatic 
increase (up to 9-fold) in LPEAT activity when compared with cells transfected 
with empty vector or an unrelated acyltransferase. LPEAT2 also exhibited 
significant acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferase activity toward 
1-O-alkenyl-lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylglycerol, 
1-O-alkyl-lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylserine, and 
lysophosphatidylcholine but lacked appreciable acylating activity toward 
glycerol 3-phosphate, lysophosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidylinositol, and 
diacylglycerol, demonstrating multiple but selective functions of LPEAT2 as an 
enzyme involved in phospholipid remodeling. LPEAT2 recognizes a broad range of 
medium and long chain fatty acyl-CoA, and its activity was not affected by 
Ca(2+). When overexpressed in mammalian cells, LPEAT2 is localized to the 
endoplasmic reticulum. siRNA-mediated knockdown of LPEAT2 in HEK293T cells 
significantly decreased LPEAT and 1-alkenyl-LPEAT activities but did not affect 
other lysophospholipid acylating activities. These findings identify LPEAT2 as 
an important enzyme in the biosynthesis of ethanolamine-containing 
phospholipids, especially in brain.
