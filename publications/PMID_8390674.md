Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors of the achaete-scute family are 
instrumental in Drosophila neurosensory development and are candidate regulators 
of development in the mammalian central nervous system and neural crest. We 
report the isolation and initial characterization of a human achaete-scute 
homolog that is highly expressed in two neuroendocrine cancers, medullary 
thyroid cancer (MTC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The human gene, which we 
have termed human achaete-scute homology 1 (hASH1), was cloned from a human MTC 
cDNA library. It encodes a predicted protein of 238 aa that is 95% homologous to 
mammalian achaete-scute homolog (MASH) 1, a rodent basic helix-loop-helix 
factor. The 57-residue basic helix-loop-helix domain is identical to that in the 
rodent gene, and the basic and helical regions, excluding the loop, are 72-80% 
identical to Drosophila achaete-scute family members. The proximal coding region 
of the hASH1 cDNA contains a striking 14-copy repeat of the triplet CAG that 
exhibits polymorphism in human genomic DNA. Thus, hASH1 is a candidate locus for 
disease-causing mutations via triplet repeat amplification. Analysis of 
rodent-human somatic cell hybrids permitted assignment of hASH1 to human 
chromosome 12. Northern blots revealed hASH1 transcripts in RNA from a human MTC 
cell line, two fresh MTC tumors, fetal brain, and three lines of human SCLC. In 
contrast, cultured lines of non-SCLC lung cancers and a panel of normal adult 
human tissues showed no detectable hASH1 transcripts. Expression of hASH1 may 
provide a useful marker for cancers with neuroendocrine features and may 
contribute to the differentiation and growth regulation of these cells.
