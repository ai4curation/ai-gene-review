The use of 1H-1H nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) for structural studies of 
uniformly deuterated polypeptide chains in large structures is investigated by 
model calculations and NMR experiments. Detailed analysis of the evolution of 
the magnetization during 1H-1H NOE experiments under slow-motion conditions 
shows that the maximal 1H-1H NOE transfer is independent of the overall 
rotational correlation time, even in the presence of chemical exchange with the 
bulk water, provided that the mixing time is adjusted for the size of the 
structure studied. 1H-1H NOE buildup measurements were performed for the 472-kDa 
complex of the 72-kDa cochaperonin GroES with a 400-kDa single-ring variant of 
the chaperonin GroEL (SR1). These experiments demonstrate that multidimensional 
NOESY experiments with cross-correlated relaxation-enhanced polarization 
transfer and transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy elements can be 
applied to structures of molecular masses up to several hundred kilodaltabs, 
which opens new possibilities for studying functional interactions in large 
maromolecular assemblies in solution.
