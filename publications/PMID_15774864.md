Formation of the Escherichia coli division septum is catalyzed by a number of 
essential proteins (named Fts) that assemble into a ring-like structure at the 
future division site. Several of these Fts proteins are intrinsic transmembrane 
proteins whose functions are largely unknown. Although these proteins appear to 
be recruited to the division site in a hierarchical order, the molecular 
interactions underlying the assembly of the cell division machinery remain 
mostly unspecified. In the present study, we used a bacterial two-hybrid system 
based on interaction-mediated reconstitution of a cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling 
cascade to unravel the molecular basis of septum assembly by analyzing the 
protein interaction network among E. coli cell division proteins. Our results 
indicate that the Fts proteins are connected to one another through multiple 
interactions. A deletion mapping analysis carried out with two of these 
proteins, FtsQ and FtsI, revealed that different regions of the polypeptides are 
involved in their associations with their partners. Furthermore, we showed that 
the association between two Fts hybrid proteins could be modulated by the 
coexpression of a third Fts partner. Altogether, these data suggest that the 
cell division machinery assembly is driven by the cooperative association among 
the different Fts proteins to form a dynamic multiprotein structure at the 
septum site. In addition, our study shows that the cAMP-based two-hybrid system 
is particularly appropriate for analyzing molecular interactions between 
membrane proteins.
