BACKGROUND: Epithelial cells have apicobasal polarity and an asymmetric 
junctional complex that provides the bases for development and tissue 
maintenance. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the evolutionarily conserved 
protein complex, PAR-6/aPKC/PAR-3, localizes to the subapical region and plays 
critical roles in the establishment of a junctional complex and cell polarity. 
In Drosophila, another set of proteins called tumor suppressors, such as Lgl, 
which localize separately to the basolateral membrane domain but genetically 
interact with the subapical proteins, also contribute to the establishment of 
cell polarity. However, how physically separated proteins interact remains to be 
clarified.
RESULTS: We show that mammalian Lgl competes for PAR-3 in forming an independent 
complex with PAR-6/aPKC. During cell polarization, mLgl initially colocalizes 
with PAR-6/aPKC at the cell-cell contact region and is phosphorylated by aPKC, 
followed by segregation from apical PAR-6/aPKC to the basolateral membrane after 
cells are polarized. Overexpression studies establish that increased amounts of 
the mLgl/PAR-6/aPKC complex suppress the formation of epithelial junctions; this 
contrasts with the previous observation that the complex containing PAR-3 
promotes it.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that PAR-6/aPKC selectively interacts with 
either mLgl or PAR-3 under the control of aPKC activity to regulate epithelial 
cell polarity.
