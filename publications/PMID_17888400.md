Animals and plants respond to bacterial infections and environmental stresses by 
inducing overlapping repertoires of defense genes. How the signals associated 
with infection and abiotic stresses are differentially integrated within a whole 
organism remains to be fully addressed. We show that the transcription of a 
Caenorhabditis elegans ABC transporter, pgp-5 is induced by both bacterial 
infection and heavy metal stress, but the magnitude and tissue distribution of 
its expression differs, depending on the type of stressor. PGP-5 contributes to 
resistance to bacterial infection and heavy metals. Using pgp-5 transcription as 
a read-out, we show that signals from both biotic and abiotic stresses are 
integrated by TIR-1, a TIR domain adaptor protein orthologous to human SARM, and 
a p38 MAP kinase signaling cassette. We further demonstrate that not all the 
TIR-1 isoforms are necessary for nematode resistance to infection, suggesting a 
molecular basis for the differential response to abiotic and biotic stress.
