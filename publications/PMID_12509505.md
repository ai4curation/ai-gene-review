Ethylene signaling in plants is mediated by a family of receptors related to 
bacterial two-component histidine kinases. Of the five members of the 
Arabidopsis ethylene receptor family, members of subfamily I (ETR1 and ERS1) 
contain completely conserved histidine kinase domains, whereas members of 
subfamily II (ETR2, EIN4, and ERS2) lack conserved residues thought to be 
necessary for kinase activity. To examine the role of the conserved histidine 
kinase domain in receptor signaling, ers1;etr1 loss-of-function double mutants 
were generated. The double mutants exhibited a severe constitutive ethylene 
response phenotype consistent with the negative regulator model for receptor 
function. The adult ers1-2;etr1-6 and ers1-2;etr1-7 phenotypes included 
miniature rosette size, delayed flowering, and both male and female sterility, 
whereas etiolated-seedling responses were less affected. Chimeric transgene 
constructs in which the ETR1 promoter was used to drive expression of cDNAs for 
each of the five receptor isoforms were transferred into the ers1-2;etr1-7 
double-mutant plants. Subfamily I constructs restored normal growth, whereas 
subfamily II constructs failed to rescue the double mutant, providing evidence 
for a unique role for subfamily I in receptor signaling. However, transformation 
of either the ers1-2;etr1-6 or ers1-2;etr1-7 mutant with a kinase-inactivated 
ETR1 genomic clone also resulted in complete restoration of normal growth and 
ethylene responsiveness in the double-mutant background, leading to the 
conclusion that canonical histidine kinase activity by receptors is not required 
for ethylene receptor signaling.

Abstract

Ethylene signaling in plants is mediated by a family of receptors related to bacterial two-component histidine kinases. Of the five members of the Arabidopsis ethylene receptor family, members of subfamily I (ETR1 and ERS1) contain completely conserved histidine kinase domains, whereas members of subfamily II (ETR2, EIN4, and ERS2) lack conserved residues thought to be necessary for kinase activity. To examine the role of the conserved histidine kinase domain in receptor signaling, ers1;etr1 loss-of-function double mutants were generated. The double mutants exhibited a severe constitutive ethylene response phenotype consistent with the negative regulator model for receptor function. The adult ers1-2;etr1-6 and ers1-2;etr1-7 phenotypes included miniature rosette size, delayed flowering, and both male and female sterility, whereas etiolated-seedling responses were less affected. Chimeric transgene constructs in which the ETR1 promoter was used to drive expression of cDNAs for each of the five receptor isoforms were transferred into the ers1-2;etr1-7 double-mutant plants. Subfamily I constructs restored normal growth, whereas subfamily II constructs failed to rescue the double mutant, providing evidence for a unique role for subfamily I in receptor signaling. However, transformation of either the ers1-2;etr1-6 or ers1-2;etr1-7 mutant with a kinase-inactivated ETR1 genomic clone also resulted in complete restoration of normal growth and ethylene responsiveness in the double-mutant background, leading to the conclusion that canonical histidine kinase activity by receptors is not required for ethylene receptor signaling.

Discussion

The research reported here was undertaken to investigate whether the subfamily I receptors have a special role in ethylene signal transmission. A previous study with the receptor family from tomato demonstrated that overexpression of a subfamily II receptor could compensate for reduced expression of a subfamily I receptor ( 24 ). However, the tomato genome contains three subfamily I receptor isoforms, only one of which was suppressed in the study. In the present study, loss of function of the only two subfamily I receptors of Arabidopsis could not be compensated by overexpression of any of the three subfamily II receptors, supporting the idea that subfamily I receptors play a unique and necessary role in ethylene signaling.

Given that subfamily I receptors are distinguished from subfamily II receptors by the presence of a conserved histidine kinase domain, the ability of a kinase-inactivated form of ETR1 to provide a virtually complete rescue of the ers1;etr1 double mutants was unexpected and appears to rule out canonical histidine kinase phosphotransfer as the necessary mechanism by which ethylene receptors transmit signal to downstream effectors. A recent study of signaling by the dominant etr1-1 mutant receptor also failed to support, although did not rule out, a role for histidine kinase activity in signaling ( 25 ). Transgenic forms of the etr1-1 mutant receptor could confer dominant insensitivity to ethylene even when the kinase domain was rendered inactive by mutagenesis or truncated entirely, leading to the conclusion that constitutive signaling by the mutant receptor either occurred independently of histidine kinase activity, or was achieved by mutant receptors interacting with WT receptors. Further support for the latter possibility comes from another recent study demonstrating that ethylene insensitivity conferred by the dominant subfamily II etr2-1 allele partially depends on the presence of a functional ETR1 gene ( 26 ).

The finding that histidine kinase activity of ETR1 is not required for receptor signaling presents an interesting evolutionary parallel between the ethylene receptors and the phytochromes. Some cyanobacterial forms of phytochrome appear to signal as canonical histidine kinases, whereas phytochromes of flowering plants contain degenerate histidine kinase domains ( 27 ). Ethylene receptor-like genes are also found in cyanobacteria, including slr1212 of Synechocystis , that has a conserved ethylene binding domain with ethylene binding activity, but lacks a complete histidine kinase transmitter domain ( 5 ). However, genes from the recently sequenced Anabaena genome encode proteins with both an ethylene binding domain and a conserved histidine kinase domain ( 28 ). Given the likelihood that vascular plants recruited both phytochrome and ethylene receptor functions from the cyanobacterial ancestor of the chloroplast ( 29 ), it is interesting to speculate that what may have started as histidine kinase transmitters have evolved into novel signaling mechanisms.

Despite the degenerate nature of histidine kinase domains in plant phytochromes, they retain the capacity for both autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation of substrates with a specificity for Ser/Thr residues ( 27 , 30 ). In fact, histidine kinases may have evolved into Ser/Thr kinases several times independently ( 31 ). The possibility that ethylene receptor signaling occurs through a novel autophosphorylation mechanism in the subfamily II ethylene receptor isoforms and even in the WT subfamily I isoforms and the protein carrying the mutated getr1 -[ HGG ] gene cannot be ruled out.

Alternatively, a novel signaling mechanism that does not require phosphotransfer by receptor may have evolved in the ethylene receptor family. Precedents for such evolutionary trends are found in some receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in animals. A number of so-called “kinase dead” RTKs retain the capacity for signal tranduction ( 32 ). These systems may rely on heterologous RTKs or soluble kinases for transphosphorylation. Perhaps the RAF-related CTR1 fulfills this role in ethylene signaling.

The physical interaction of the ETR1 and ERS1 transmitter domains with the presumed regulatory domain of CTR1 ( 18 ) could provide for the direct propagation of conformational change from receptors to the CTR1 catalytic domain. Alternatively, conformational changes in receptors could recruit and/or release CTR1 from a receptor complex, analogous to the recruitment of RAF kinases to receptor complexes in animals ( 33 ). Further propagation of the signal by CTR1 could occur through autophosphorylation, transphosphorylation of receptors, or phosphorylation of downstream effectors.

Perhaps the physical interaction of the transmitter domains of ETR1 and ERS1 with the regulatory domain of CTR1 represents the special role that subfamily I receptors play in signaling. Physical interactions of the subfamily II ETR2 transmitter domain with CTR1 are much weaker than those reported for ETR1 and ERS1 ( 26 ). The severe phenotype of the ers1;etr1 double loss-of-function mutants implies that this weaker interaction may be insufficient to promote significant signaling, except perhaps in the case of etiolated hypocotyls (Fig. 4 B ). If this is the case, then subfamily II receptors could contribute to signaling through receptor/receptor interactions with subfamily I, as has been recently suggested ( 25 , 26 , 34 ). Recent studies with bacterial two-component systems support an important role for receptor interactions in signal output ( 35 ).

From an evolutionary perspective, all of these mechanisms can be viewed in terms of the recruitment of CTR1 as an adapter kinase that either led to or compensated for the loss of canonical histidine kinase activity as the principal mode of signal transduction by the ethylene receptors ( 32 ). The retention of histidine kinase activity in subfamily I receptors may have been selected in evolution to provide fine-tuning of the signaling pathway rather than functioning as the primary mechanism for signal transduction. More detailed studies of the activity of the getr1 -[ HGG ] protein in planta may reveal such a function.
