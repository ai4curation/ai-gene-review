Apoptosis is initiated when Bcl-2 and its prosurvival relatives are engaged by 
proapoptotic BH3-only proteins via interaction of its BH3 domain with a groove 
on the Bcl-2-like proteins. These interactions have been considered promiscuous, 
but our analysis of the affinity of eight BH3 peptides for five Bcl-2-like 
proteins has revealed that the interactions vary over 10,000-fold in affinity, 
and accordingly, only certain protein pairs associate inside cells. Bim and Puma 
potently engaged all the prosurvival proteins comparably. Bad, however, bound 
tightly to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w but only weakly to A1 and not to Mcl-1. 
Strikingly, Noxa bound only Mcl-1 and A1. In accord with their complementary 
binding, Bad and Noxa cooperated to induce potent killing. The results suggest 
that apoptosis relies on selective interactions between particular subsets of 
these proteins and that it should be feasible to discover BH3-mimetic drugs that 
inactivate specific prosurvival targets.
