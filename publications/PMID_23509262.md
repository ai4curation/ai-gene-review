Hyaluronan (HA) has an extraordinarily high turnover in physiological tissues, 
and HA degradation is accelerated in inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. CD44 
(a cell surface receptor) and two hyaluronidases (HYAL1 and HYAL2) are thought 
to be responsible for HA binding and degradation; however, the role of these 
molecules in HA catabolism remains controversial. Here we show that KIAA1199, a 
deafness gene of unknown function, plays a central role in HA binding and 
depolymerization that is independent of CD44 and HYAL enzymes. The specific 
binding of KIAA1199 to HA was demonstrated in glycosaminoglycan-binding assays. 
We found that knockdown of KIAA1199 abolished HA degradation by human skin 
fibroblasts and that transfection of KIAA1199 cDNA into cells conferred the 
ability to catabolize HA in an endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase-dependent manner 
via the clathrin-coated pit pathway. Enhanced degradation of HA in synovial 
fibroblasts from patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis was 
correlated with increased levels of KIAA1199 expression and was abrogated by 
knockdown of KIAA1199. The level of KIAA1199 expression in uninflamed synovium 
was less than in osteoarthritic or rheumatoid synovium. These data suggest that 
KIAA1199 is a unique hyaladherin with a key role in HA catabolism in the dermis 
of the skin and arthritic synovium.
