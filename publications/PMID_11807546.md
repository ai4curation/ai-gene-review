Oedema factor, a calmodulin-activated adenylyl cyclase, is important in the 
pathogenesis of anthrax. Here we report the X-ray structures of oedema factor 
with and without bound calmodulin. Oedema factor shares no significant 
structural homology with mammalian adenylyl cyclases or other proteins. In the 
active site, 3'-deoxy-ATP and a single metal ion are well positioned for 
catalysis with histidine 351 as the catalytic base. This mechanism differs from 
the mechanism of two-metal-ion catalysis proposed for mammalian adenylyl 
cyclases. Four discrete regions of oedema factor form a surface that recognizes 
an extended conformation of calmodulin, which is very different from the 
collapsed conformation observed in other structures of calmodulin bound to 
effector peptides. On calmodulin binding, an oedema factor helical domain of 
relative molecular mass 15,000 undergoes a 15 A translation and a 30 degrees 
rotation away from the oedema factor catalytic core, which stabilizes a 
disordered loop and leads to enzyme activation. These allosteric changes provide 
the first molecular details of how calmodulin modulates one of its targets.
