The TOR (target of rapamycin) pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling 
module regulating cell growth (accumulation of mass) in response to a variety of 
environmental cues such as nutrient availability, hypoxia, DNA damage and 
osmotic stress. Its pivotal role in cellular and organismal homeostasis is 
reflected in the fact that unrestrained signaling activity in mammals is 
associated with the occurrence of disease states including inflammation, cancer 
and diabetes. The existence of TOR homologs in unicellular organisms whose 
growth is affected by environmental factors, such as temperature, nutrients and 
osmolarity, suggests an ancient role for the TOR signaling network in the 
surveillance of stress conditions. Here, we will summarize recent advances in 
the TOR signaling field with special emphasis on how stress conditions impinge 
on insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling/TOR signaling.
