The tyrosine kinase Syk (relative molecular mass 72,000), which is widely 
expressed in haematopoietic cells, becomes associated with and activated by 
engagement of the B-cell antigen receptor. Furthermore, it has been implicated 
in signalling through the receptors for interleukin-2 (IL-2), granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and Fc, the T cell receptor, as well as 
through receptors for several platelet agonists. A homologous kinase, ZAP-70, is 
crucial in signalling through the T-cell receptor and in T-cell development. 
Using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells, we created mice null for 
the syk gene which showed petechiae in utero and died shortly after birth. 
Irradiated mice reconstituted with Syk-deficient fetal liver showed a block in 
B-cell development at the pro-B to pre-B cell transition, consistent with a key 
role for Syk in pre-B-cell receptor signalling. Despite the production of small 
numbers of immature B cells, Syk-deficient radiation chimaeras failed to 
accumulate mature B cells, indicating a possible role for this protein in the 
production or maintenance of mature B cells. In addition, whereas the 
development of alpha beta T cells proceeded normally, Syk-deficient mice showed 
impaired development of thymocytes using the V gamma 3 variable region gene (V 
gamma 3+ thymocytes). Finally, we show that Syk is not required for signalling 
through the IL-2 and G-CSF receptors.
