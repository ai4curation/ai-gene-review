Oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation are two major metabolic 
pathways in mitochondria. Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 (ACAD9), an enzyme assumed to 
play a role in fatty acid oxidation, was recently identified as a factor 
involved in complex I biogenesis. Here we further investigated the role of 
ACAD9's enzymatic activity in fatty acid oxidation and complex I biogenesis. We 
provide evidence indicating that ACAD9 displays enzyme activity in vivo. 
Knockdown experiments in very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 
(VLCAD)-deficient fibroblasts revealed that ACAD9 is responsible for the 
production of C14:1-carnitine from oleate and C12-carnitine from palmitate. 
These results explain the origin of these obscure acylcarnitines that are used 
to diagnose VLCAD deficiency in humans. Knockdown of ACAD9 in control 
fibroblasts did not reveal changes in the acylcarnitine profiles upon fatty acid 
loading. Next, we investigated whether catalytic activity of ACAD9 was necessary 
for complex I biogenesis. Catalytically inactive ACAD9 gave partial-to-complete 
rescue of complex I biogenesis in ACAD9-deficient cells and was incorporated in 
high-molecular-weight assembly intermediates. Our results underscore the 
importance of the ACAD9 protein in complex I assembly and suggest that the 
enzymatic activity is a rudiment of the duplication event.
