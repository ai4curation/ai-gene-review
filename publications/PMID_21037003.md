A cascade of alternative sigma factors governs the program of developmental gene 
expression during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. Little is known, however, 
about how the early-acting sigma factors are inactivated and replaced by the 
later-acting factors. Here we identify a small protein, Fin (formerly known as 
YabK), that is required for efficient switching from σ(F)- to σ(G)-directed gene 
expression in the forespore compartment of the developing sporangium. The fin 
gene, which is conserved among Bacillus species and species of related genera, 
is transcribed in the forespore under the control of both σ(F) and σ(G). Cells 
mutant for fin are unable to fully deactivate σ(F) and, conversely, are unable 
to fully activate σ(G). Consistent with their deficiency in σ(G)-directed gene 
expression, fin cells are arrested in large numbers following the engulfment 
stage of sporulation, ultimately forming 50-fold fewer heat-resistant spores 
than the wild type. Based in part on the similarity of Fin to the anti-σ(G) 
factor CsfB (also called Gin), we speculate that Fin is an anti-σ(F) factor 
which, by disabling σ(F), promotes the switch to late developmental gene 
expression in the forespore.
