Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARS) catalyze the ligation of amino acids to cognate 
tRNAs. Chordate ARSs have evolved distinctive features absent from ancestral 
forms, including compartmentalization in a multisynthetase complex (MSC), 
noncatalytic peptide appendages, and ancillary functions unrelated to 
aminoacylation. Here, we show that glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (GluProRS), a 
bifunctional ARS of the MSC, has a regulated, noncanonical activity that blocks 
synthesis of a specific protein. GluProRS was identified as a component of the 
interferon (IFN)-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex by RNA 
affinity chromatography using the ceruloplasmin (Cp) GAIT element as ligand. In 
response to IFN-gamma, GluProRS is phosphorylated and released from the MSC, 
binds the Cp 3'-untranslated region in an mRNP containing three additional 
proteins, and silences Cp mRNA translation. Thus, GluProRS has divergent 
functions in protein synthesis: in the MSC, its aminoacylation activity supports 
global translation, but translocation of GluProRS to an inflammation-responsive 
mRNP causes gene-specific translational silencing.
