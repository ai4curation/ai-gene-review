Hereditary cataract is a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous lens 
disease that is responsible for a significant proportion of the visual 
impairment and blindness that occurs in children. In a five-generation Chinese 
family with autosomal dominant inherited congenital cataract, clinical 
examination showed three cataract phenotypes: punctuate, nuclear, and total 
cataracts. Linkage analysis was performed and positive two-point LOD scores 
(with maximum of 4.43 and 4.27 at theta=0) were obtained for markers D21S1411 
and D21S1890 on chromosome 21q22.3, flanking the CRYAA 
(alphaA-crystallin-encoding gene) locus. Sequencing of CRYAA revealed a novel 
heterozygous G>A transition (c.346G>A) in exon 3 that cosegregated with the 
disease phenotype and results in a conservative substitution of Arg to His at 
codon 116 (p.R116H). To understand the molecular basis of cataract formation, 
mutant and wild-type alphaA-crystallins were expressed in E. coli. RP-HPLC 
(reverse phase-high-performance liquid chromatography) suggested an increased 
hydrophobicity of the mutant recombinant protein, compared to that of wild-type 
alphaA-crystallins. Furthermore, loss of chaperone activity of the mutant was 
seen in DTT (DL-dithiothreitol)-induced insulin aggregation assay. FPLC (fast 
protein liquid chromatography) purification showed that the His-116 mutant 
protein had increased binding affinity to lysozyme. Gain of activated lysozyme 
binding, elevation of hydrophobicity and loss of chaperone activity of the 
mutant protein may be some of the molecular mechanisms underlying cataract in 
this large family.
