Translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) bound to GTP transfers the initiator 
methionyl tRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit. The eIF5 stimulates GTP hydrolysis 
by the eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNA(i)(Met) ternary complex on base-pairing between 
Met-tRNA(i)(Met) and the start codon. The eIF2, eIF5, and eIF1 all have been 
implicated in stringent selection of AUG as the start codon. The eIF3 binds to 
the 40S ribosome and promotes recruitment of the ternary complex; however, 
physical contact between eIF3 and eIF2 has not been observed. We show that yeast 
eIF5 can bridge interaction in vitro between eIF3 and eIF2 by binding 
simultaneously to the amino terminus of eIF3 subunit NIP1 and the amino-terminal 
half of eIF2beta, dependent on a conserved bipartite motif in the carboxyl 
terminus of eIF5. Additionally, the amino terminus of NIP1 can bind concurrently 
to eIF5 and eIF1. These findings suggest the occurrence of an 
eIF3/eIF1/eIF5/eIF2 multifactor complex, which was observed in cell extracts 
free of 40S ribosomes and found to contain stoichiometric amounts of 
tRNA(i)(Met). The multifactor complex was disrupted by the tif5-7A mutation in 
the bipartite motif of eIF5. Importantly, the tif5-7A mutant is temperature 
sensitive and displayed a substantial reduction in translation initiation at the 
restrictive temperature. We propose that the multifactor complex is an important 
intermediate in translation initiation in vivo.
