WAVE2 belongs to a family of proteins that mediates actin reorganization by 
relaying signals from Rac to the Arp2/3 complex, resulting in lamellipodia 
protrusion. WAVE2 displays Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation activity in vitro, 
and does not bind directly to Rac. Instead, it forms macromolecular complexes 
that have been reported to exert both positive and negative modes of regulation. 
How these complexes are assembled, localized and activated in vivo remains to be 
established. Here we use tandem mass spectrometry to identify an Abi1-based 
complex containing WAVE2, Nap1 (Nck-associated protein) and PIR121. Abi1 
interacts directly with the WHD domain of WAVE2, increases WAVE2 actin 
polymerization activity and mediates the assembly of a WAVE2-Abi1-Nap1-PIR121 
complex. The WAVE2-Abi1-Nap1-PIR121 complex is as active as the WAVE2-Abi1 
sub-complex in stimulating Arp2/3, and after Rac activation it is re-localized 
to the leading edge of ruffles in vivo. Consistently, inhibition of Abi1 by RNA 
interference (RNAi) abrogates Rac-dependent lamellipodia protrusion. Thus, Abi1 
orchestrates the proper assembly of the WAVE2 complex and mediates its 
activation at the leading edge in vivo.
