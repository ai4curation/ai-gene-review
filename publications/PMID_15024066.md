In the past decade, traditional yeast two-hybrid techniques have identified a 
plethora of interactions among soluble proteins operating within diverse 
cellular pathways. The discovery of associations between membrane proteins by 
genetic approaches, on the other hand, is less well established due to technical 
limitations. Recently, a split-ubiquitin system was developed to overcome this 
barrier, but so far, this system has been limited to the analysis of known 
membrane protein interactions. Here, we constructed unique 
split-ubiquitin-linked cDNA libraries and provide details for implementing this 
system to screen for binding partners of a bait protein, in this case BAP31. 
BAP31 is a resident integral protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it 
operates as a chaperone or cargo receptor and regulator of apoptosis. Here we 
describe a novel human member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase-like B (PTPLB) 
family, an integral protein of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane with four 
membrane-spanning alpha helices, as a BAP31-interacting protein. PTPLB turns 
over rapidly through degradation by the proteasome system. Comparisons of mouse 
cells with a deletion of Bap31 or reconstituted with human BAP31 indicate that 
BAP31 is required to maintain PTPLB, consistent with a chaperone or quality 
control function for BAP31 in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
