As collective cell migration is intimately involved in different aspects of 
metazoan development, molecular mechanisms underlying this process are being 
explored in a variety of developmental contexts. Border cell (BC) migration 
during Drosophila oogenesis has emerged as an excellent genetic model for 
studying collective cell migration. BCs are of epithelial origin but acquire 
partial mesenchymal characteristics before migrating as a group towards the 
oocyte. Here, we report that insulin signaling modulates collective BC movement 
during Drosophila oogenesis. Supporting the involvement of Insulin pathway, we 
demonstrate that compromising Insulin-like Receptor (InR) levels in BCs, 
inhibits their migration. Furthermore, we show that canonical Insulin signaling 
pathway components participate in this process. Interestingly, visualization of 
InR-depleted BC clusters, using time-lapse imaging, revealed a delay in 
detachment of BC clusters from the surrounding anterior follicle cells and 
altered protrusion dynamics. Lastly, based on genetic interactions between InR, 
the polarity determinant, par-1 and a regulatory subunit of Drosophila Myosin 
(spaghetti squash), we propose that Insulin signaling likely influences par-1 
activity to engineer border cell detachment and subsequent movement via 
Drosophila Myosin.
