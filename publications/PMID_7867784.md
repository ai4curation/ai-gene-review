Ydj1p, a cytosolic DnaJ homolog from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is demonstrated 
to function as a molecular chaperone. Purified Ydj1p formed complexes with 
non-native polypeptides and suppressed protein aggregation. Ydj1p cooperated 
with Ssa Hsp70 proteins in the prevention of protein aggregation, but not with 
the Ssb Hsp70 proteins. Cooperation between these different molecular chaperones 
was only observed in the presence of hydrolyzable ATP and correlated with the 
ability of Ydj1p to stimulate the ATPase activity of the Hsp70 homolog with 
which it was paired. The regulatory and chaperone activities of a eukarytic DnaJ 
homolog thus act together to assist Hsp70 in modulating the conformation of 
proteins.
