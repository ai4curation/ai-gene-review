Aggregation of α-synuclein contributes to the formation of Lewy bodies and 
neurites, the pathologic hallmarks of Parkinson disease (PD) and 
α-synucleinopathies. Although a number of human mutations have been identified 
in familial PD, the mechanisms that promote α-synuclein accumulation and 
toxicity are poorly understood. Here, we report that hyperactivity of the 
nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl critically regulates α-synuclein-induced 
neuropathology. In mice expressing a human α-synucleinopathy-associated mutation 
(hA53Tα-syn mice), deletion of the gene encoding c-Abl reduced α-synuclein 
aggregation, neuropathology, and neurobehavioral deficits. Conversely, 
overexpression of constitutively active c-Abl in hA53Tα-syn mice accelerated 
α-synuclein aggregation, neuropathology, and neurobehavioral deficits. Moreover, 
c-Abl activation led to an age-dependent increase in phosphotyrosine 39 
α-synuclein. In human postmortem samples, there was an accumulation of 
phosphotyrosine 39 α-synuclein in brain tissues and Lewy bodies of PD patients 
compared with age-matched controls. Furthermore, in vitro studies show that 
c-Abl phosphorylation of α-synuclein at tyrosine 39 enhances α-synuclein 
aggregation. Taken together, this work establishes a critical role for c-Abl in 
α-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration and demonstrates that selective inhibition 
of c-Abl may be neuroprotective. This study further indicates that 
phosphotyrosine 39 α-synuclein is a potential disease indicator for PD and 
related α-synucleinopathies.
