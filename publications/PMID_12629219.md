A significant fraction of the total calciumcalmodulin-dependent protein kinase 
II (CaMKII) activity in neurons is associated with synaptic connections and is 
present in nerve terminals, thus suggesting a role for CaMKII in 
neurotransmitter release. To determine whether CaMKII regulates neurotransmitter 
release, we generated and analyzed knockout mice in which the dominant 
alpha-isoform of CaMKII was specifically deleted from the presynaptic side of 
the CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapse. Conditional CA3 alpha-CaMKII knockout mice 
exhibited an unchanged basal probability of neurotransmitter release at CA3-CA1 
synapses but showed a significant enhancement in the activity-dependent increase 
in probability of release during repetitive presynaptic stimulation, as was 
shown with the analysis of unitary synaptic currents. These data indicate that 
alpha-CaMKII serves as a negative activity-dependent regulator of 
neurotransmitter release at hippocampal synapses and maintains synapses in an 
optimal range of release probabilities necessary for normal synaptic operation.
