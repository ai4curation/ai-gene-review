The bestrophins are a newly described family of anion channels unrelated in 
primary sequence to any previously characterized channel proteins. The human 
genome codes for four bestrophins, each of which confers a distinctive plasma 
membrane conductance on transfected 293 cells. Extracellular treatment with 
methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET) of a series of substitution 
mutants that eliminate one or more cysteines from human bestrophin1 demonstrates 
that cysteine 69 is the single endogenous cysteine responsible for MTSET 
inhibition of whole-cell current. Cysteines introduced between positions 78-99 
and 223-226 are also accessible to external MTSET, with MTSET modification at 
positions 79, 80, 83, and 90 producing a 2-6-fold increase in whole-cell 
current. The latter set of four cysteine-substitution mutants define a region 
that appears to mediate allosteric control of channel activity. Mapping of 
transmembrane topography by insertion of N-linked glycosylation sites and 
tobacco etch virus protease cleavage sites provides evidence for cytosolic N and 
C termini and an unexpected transmembrane topography with at least three 
extracellular loops that include positions 60-63, 212-227, and 261-267. These 
experiments provide the first structural analysis of the bestrophin channel 
family.
