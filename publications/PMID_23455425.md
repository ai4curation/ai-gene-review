Autophagy is a tightly regulated intracellular bulk degradation/recycling system 
that has fundamental roles in cellular homeostasis. Autophagy is initiated by 
isolation membranes, which form and elongate as they engulf portions of the 
cytoplasm and organelles. Eventually isolation membranes close to form double 
membrane-bound autophagosomes and fuse with lysosomes to degrade their contents. 
The physiological role of autophagy has been determined since its discovery, but 
the origin of autophagosomal membranes has remained unclear. At present, there 
is much controversy about the organelle from which the membranes originate--the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and plasma membrane. Here we show that 
autophagosomes form at the ER-mitochondria contact site in mammalian cells. 
Imaging data reveal that the pre-autophagosome/autophagosome marker ATG14 (also 
known as ATG14L) relocalizes to the ER-mitochondria contact site after 
starvation, and the autophagosome-formation marker ATG5 also localizes at the 
site until formation is complete. Subcellular fractionation showed that ATG14 
co-fractionates in the mitochondria-associated ER membrane fraction under 
starvation conditions. Disruption of the ER-mitochondria contact site prevents 
the formation of ATG14 puncta. The ER-resident SNARE protein syntaxin 17 (STX17) 
binds ATG14 and recruits it to the ER-mitochondria contact site. These results 
provide new insight into organelle biogenesis by demonstrating that the 
ER-mitochondria contact site is important in autophagosome formation.
