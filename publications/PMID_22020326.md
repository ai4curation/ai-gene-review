MULTIMERIN2 (MMRN2), also known as Endoglyx-1, is an extracellular matrix 
glycoprotein whose function has so far remained elusive. Given its specific 
localization in tight association with the endothelium we hypothesized that this 
protein could modulate neo-angiogenesis. By multiple assays we showed that MMRN2 
significantly impaired endothelial cell (EC) migration and organization of a 
functional vessel network. The interaction of ECs with MMRN2 induced a striking 
impairment of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 activation. We focused our attention on VEGFR2, 
a chief regulator of angiogenesis, and clarified that MMRN2 interfered with the 
VEGF/VEGFR2 axis through a direct binding with VEGF-A. This novel interaction 
was assessed in several assays and the affinity was estimated (Kd ∼50  nM). We 
next questioned whether the anti-angiogenic properties of MMRN2 could impair 
tumor growth. Although overexpression of MMRN2 by HT1080 cells did not affect 
their growth and apoptotic rate in vitro, it remarkably affected their growth in 
vivo. In fact, MMRN2-positive cells failed to efficiently grow and form 
well-vascularized tumors; a similar outcome was observed following treatment of 
established tumors with a MMRN2 adenoviral construct. Tumor-section 
immunostaining revealed a strong co-localization of VEGF-A with the ectopically 
expressed MMRN2. These novel findings suggest that VEGF may be sequestered by 
MMRN2 and be less available for the engagement to the receptors. Taken together 
these results highlight MMRN2 as a crucial player in the regulation of EC 
function, neo-angiogenesis and hence tumor growth. We hypothesize that secreted 
and deposited MMRN2 may function as a homeostatic barrier halting the sprouting 
of novel vessels, and suggest that these studies may embody the potential for 
the development of novel tools for cancer treatment.
