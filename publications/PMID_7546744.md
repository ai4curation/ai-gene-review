Sympathetic neurons, when placed in culture during the period of naturally 
occurring cell death, will die by apoptosis when deprived of nerve growth factor 
(NGF). In this system, the mRNA levels of the BCL-2 family members decrease 
after NGF deprivation and during apoptosis. Sympathetic neurons from 
BCL-2-deficient mice died more rapidly after NGF deprivation than neurons from 
wild-type littermates. Sympathetic neurons of adult animals are relatively 
independent of NGF for survival. If sympathetic neurons are maintained in vitro 
for several weeks, loss of acute trophic factor dependence develops with a time 
course similar to that seen in the intact animal. Examination of neurons from 
BCL-2-deficient mice showed that BCL-2 expression is not required for the 
development of trophic factor independence. Therefore, BCL-2 is an important 
regulator of the survival of sympathetic neurons after NGF deprivation during 
the period of naturally occurring programmed neuronal death, but BCL-2 is not 
involved in the development of trophic factor independence in mature sympathetic 
neurons.
