14-3-3 proteins play an important role in a multitude of signalling pathways. 
The interactions between 14-3-3 and other signalling proteins, such as Raf and 
KSR (kinase suppressor of Ras), occur in a phospho-specific manner. Recently, a 
phosphorylation-independent interaction has been reported to occur between 
14-3-3 and several proteins, for example 5-phosphatase, p75NTR-associated cell 
death executor (NADE) and the bacterial toxin Exoenzyme S (ExoS), an 
ADP-ribosyltransferase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study we have 
identified the amino acid residues on ExoS, which are responsible for its 
specific interaction with 14-3-3. Furthermore, we show that a peptide derived 
from ExoS, containing the 14-3-3 interaction site, effectively competes out the 
interaction between ExoS and 14-3-3. In addition, competition with this peptide 
blocks ExoS modification of Ras in our Ras modification assay. We show that the 
ExoS protein interacts with all isoforms of the 14-3-3 family tested. Moreover, 
in vivo an ExoS protein lacking the 14-3-3 binding site has a reduced capacity 
to ADP ribosylate cytoplasmic proteins, e.g. Ras, and shows a reduced capacity 
to change the morphology of infected cells.
