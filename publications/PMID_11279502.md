Optimal immune responses require both an antigen-specific and a co-stimulatory 
signal. The shared ligands B7-1 and B7-2 on antigen-presenting cells deliver the 
co-stimulatory signal through CD28 and CTLA-4 on T cells. Signalling through 
CD28 augments the T-cell response, whereas CTLA-4 signalling attenuates it. 
Numerous animal studies and recent clinical trials indicate that manipulating 
these interactions holds considerable promise for immunotherapy. With the 
consequences of these signals well established, and details of the downstream 
signalling events emerging, understanding the molecular nature of these 
extracellular interactions becomes crucial. Here we report the crystal structure 
of the human CTLA-4/B7-1 co-stimulatory complex at 3.0 A resolution. In contrast 
to other interacting cell-surface molecules, the relatively small CTLA-4/B7-1 
binding interface exhibits an unusually high degree of shape complementarity. 
CTLA-4 forms homodimers through a newly defined interface of highly conserved 
residues. In the crystal lattice, CTLA-4 and B7-1 pack in a strikingly periodic 
arrangement in which bivalent CTLA-4 homodimers bridge bivalent B7-1 homodimers. 
This zipper-like oligomerization provides the structural basis for forming 
unusually stable signalling complexes at the T-cell surface, underscoring the 
importance of potent inhibitory signalling in human immune responses.
