Spliceosome rearrangements facilitated by RNA helicase PRP16 before catalytic 
step two of splicing are poorly understood. Here we report a 3D cryo-electron 
microscopy structure of the human spliceosomal C complex stalled directly after 
PRP16 action (C*). The architecture of the catalytic U2-U6 ribonucleoprotein 
(RNP) core of the human C* spliceosome is very similar to that of the yeast 
pre-Prp16 C complex. However, in C* the branched intron region is separated from 
the catalytic centre by approximately 20 Å, and its position close to the U6 
small nuclear RNA ACAGA box is stabilized by interactions with the PRP8 RNase 
H-like and PRP17 WD40 domains. RNA helicase PRP22 is located about 100 Å from 
the catalytic centre, suggesting that it destabilizes the spliced mRNA after 
step two from a distance. Comparison of the structure of the yeast C and human 
C* complexes reveals numerous RNP rearrangements that are likely to be 
facilitated by PRP16, including a large-scale movement of the U2 small nuclear 
RNP.
