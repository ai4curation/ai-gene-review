The nucleotide sequence of the nifA gene from Azotobacter vinelandii was 
determined. This gene encodes an Mr = 58,100 polypeptide that shares significant 
sequence identity when compared to nifA-encoded products from other organisms. 
Interspecies comparisons of nifA-encoded products reveal that they all have a 
consensus ATP binding site and a consensus DNA binding site in highly conserved 
regions of the respective polypeptides. The nifA gene immediately precedes the 
nifB-nifQ gene region but is unlinked to the major nif gene cluster from A. 
vinelandii. A potential regulatory gene precedes and is apparently cotranscribed 
with nifA. Mutant strains that have a deletion or a deletion plus an insertion 
within nifA are incapable of diazotrophic growth and they fail to accumulate 
nitrogenase structural gene products.
