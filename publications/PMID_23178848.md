The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the most extensively studied model of 
neuronal synaptogenesis. Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering on the 
postsynaptic membrane is a cardinal event in the differentiation of NMJs. AChR 
clustering and postsynaptic differentiation is orchestrated by sophisticated 
interactions among three proteins: the neuron-secreted proteoglycan agrin, the 
co-receptor LRP4, and the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK. LRP4 
and MuSK act as scaffolds for multiple binding partners, resulting in a complex 
and dynamic network of interacting proteins that is required for AChR 
clustering. In this review, we discuss the structural basis for NMJ postsynaptic 
differentiation mediated by the agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling pathway.
