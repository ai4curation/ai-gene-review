## Abstract

Evidence for an interaction of the metalloprotease-disintegrin tumour necrosis 
factor alpha convertase (TACE) with mitotic arrest deficient 2 (MAD2), and of 
the metalloprotease-disintegrin MDC9 with a novel MAD2-related protein, 
MAD2beta.

Metalloprotease-disintegrins are a family of transmembrane glycoproteins that 
have a role in fertilization, sperm migration, myoblast fusion, neural 
development and ectodomain shedding. In the present study we used the yeast 
two-hybrid system to search for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic 
domain of two metalloprotease-disintegrins, tumour necrosis factor alpha 
convertase (TACE; ADAM17) and MDC9 (ADAM9; meltrin gamma). We have identified 
mitotic arrest deficient 2 (MAD2) as a binding partner of the TACE cytoplasmic 
domain, and a novel MAD2-related protein, MAD2beta, as a binding partner of the 
MDC9 cytoplasmic domain. MAD2beta has 23% sequence identity with MAD2, which is 
a component of the spindle assembly (or mitotic) checkpoint mechanism. Northern 
blot analysis of human tissues indicates that MAD2beta mRNA is expressed 
ubiquitously. The interaction of the TACE and MDC9 cytoplasmic domains with 
their binding partners has been confirmed biochemically. The independent 
identification of MAD2 and MAD2beta as potential interacting partners of 
distinct metalloprotease-disintegrins raises the possibility of a link between 
metalloprotease-disintegrins and the cell cycle, or of functions for MAD2 and 
MAD2beta that are not related to cell cycle control.
