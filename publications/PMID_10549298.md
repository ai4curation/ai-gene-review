Mutations in three subunits of the SWI/SNF complex and in the Med2p subunit of 
the SRB/mediator of pol II holoenzyme impaired Gcn4p-activated transcription of 
HIS3 without reducing Gcn4p-independent transcription of this gene. Recombinant 
Gcn4p interacted with SWI/SNF and SRB/mediator subunits in cell extracts in a 
manner dependent on the same hydrophobic clusters in the Gcn4p activation 
domain; however, higher concentrations of Gcn4p were required for binding to 
SWI/SNF versus SRB/mediator subunits. In addition, SRB/mediator and SWI/SNF 
subunits did not coimmunopreciptate from the extracts. These findings, together 
with the fact that Gcn4p specifically interacted with purified SWI/SNF, strongly 
suggest that Gcn4p independently recruits SWI/SNF and holoenzyme to its target 
promoters in the course of activating transcription.
