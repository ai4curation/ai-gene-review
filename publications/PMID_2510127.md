Bacteriophage T4 codes for a DNA-[N6-adenine] methyltransferase (Dam) which 
recognizes primarily the sequence GATC in both cytosine- and 
hydroxymethylcytosine-containing DNA. Hypermethylating mutants, damh, exhibit a 
relaxation in sequence specificity, that is, they are readily able to methylate 
non-canonical sites. We have determined that the damh mutation produces a single 
amino acid change (Pro126 to Ser126) in a region of homology (III) shared by 
three DNA-adenine methyltransferases; viz, T4 Dam, Escherichia coli Dam, and the 
DpnII modification enzyme of Streptococcus pneumoniae. We also describe another 
mutant, damc, which methylates GATC in cytosine-containing DNA, but not in 
hydroxymethylcytosine-containing DNA. This mutation also alters a single amino 
acid (Phe127 to Val127). These results implicate homology region III as a domain 
involved in DNA sequence recognition. The effect of several different amino 
acids at residue 126 was examined by creating a polypeptide chain terminating 
codon at that position and comparing the methylation capability of partially 
purified enzymes produced in the presence of various suppressors. No enzyme 
activity is detected when phenylalanine, glutamic acid, or histidine is inserted 
at position 126. However, insertion of alanine, cysteine, or glycine at residue 
126 produces enzymatic activity similar to Damh.
