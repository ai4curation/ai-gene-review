Cholesterol molecules specifically bind to the resting αβTCR to inhibit 
cytoplasmic CD3ζ ITAM phosphorylation through sequestering the TCR-CD3 complex 
in an inactive conformation. The mechanisms of cholesterol-mediated inhibition 
of TCR-CD3 and its activation remain unclear. Here, we present cryoelectron 
microscopy structures of cholesterol- and cholesterol sulfate (CS)-inhibited 
TCR-CD3 complexes and an auto-active TCR-CD3 variant. The structures reveal that 
cholesterol molecules act like a latch to lock CD3ζ into an inactive 
conformation in the membrane. Mutations impairing binding of cholesterol 
molecules to the tunnel result in the movement of the proximal C terminus of the 
CD3ζ transmembrane helix, thereby activating the TCR-CD3 complex in human cells. 
Together, our data reveal the structural basis of TCR inhibition by cholesterol, 
illustrate how the cholesterol-binding tunnel is allosterically coupled to TCR 
triggering, and lay a foundation for the development of immunotherapies through 
directly targeting the TCR-CD3 complex.
