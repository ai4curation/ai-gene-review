Post-translational modification of histones enables dynamic regulation of 
chromatin structure in eukaryotes. Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone 
deacetylase (HDAC) modify the N-terminal tails of histones by adding or removing 
acetyl groups to specific lysine residues. A particular pair of HAT (Esa1) and 
HDAC (Rpd3) is proposed to modify the same lysine residue in vitro and in vivo. 
Thus, HAT and HDAC might have similar structural and functional motifs. Here we 
show that HAT (Esa1 family) and HDAC (Rpd3 family) have similar amino acid 
stretches in the primary structures through evolution. We refer to this region 
as the "ER (Esa1-Rpd3) motif." In the tertiary structure of Esa1, the ER motif 
is located near the active center. In Rpd3, for which the tertiary structure 
remains unclear, we demonstrate that the ER motif contains the same secondary 
structure as found in Esa1 by circular dichroism analysis. We did 
alanine-scanning mutagenesis and found that the ER motif regions of Esa1 or Rpd3 
are required for HAT activity of Esa1 or HDAC activity of Rpd3, respectively. 
Our discovery of the ER motif present in the pair of enzymes (HAT and HDAC) 
indicates that HAT and HDAC have common structural bases, although they catalyze 
the reaction with opposite functions.
