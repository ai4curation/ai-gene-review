The cDNA of a T-cluster binding protein (TCBP) has been cloned using the 
Southwestern method. The cDNA sequence of TCBP reveals that it has 78% homology 
to that of nucleolysin, a factor involved in apoptosis in cytolytic lymphocyte 
target cells. In particular, the 0.8kb sequences of the 5'-half of both cDNAs 
were identical. However, nucleolysin has a lysosome-targeting motif at the 
carboxy terminus, while TCBP has a hydrophobic sequence instead. Southern blot 
experiments have revealed that both cDNA sequences existed in the same YAC clone 
derived from chromosome 10. This strongly suggests that the TCBP cDNA is an 
alternatively spliced product of the nucleolysin/TCBP gene. The TCBP mRNA is 
ubiquitously expressed, not only in megakaryocytic cells but also in other 
hematopoietic cells. However, when HEL cells were induced to differentiate to 
megakaryocytes by DMSO, TCBP mRNA was reduced, while PF4 gene expression 
increased simultaneously. Gel mobility shift analysis demonstrated that 
recombinant TCBP specifically bound to the T-cluster and the proximal T-rich 
region of the PF4 promoter. Co-transfection experiments showed that TCBP reduced 
the gene expression from the PF4 promoter. On the other hand, TCBP did not 
affect expression from the PF4 promoter in which the T-cluster and the T-rich 
region had been removed. These results indicate that TCBP may participate in the 
regulation of PF4 gene expression by binding to the T-cluster and the T-rich 
sequence.
