Cellular responses produced by EGF are mediated through the receptor (EGFR) and 
by various enzymes and scaffolds. Recent studies document IQGAP1 as a scaffold 
for the MAPK cascade, binding directly to B-Raf, MEK, and ERK and regulating 
their activation in response to EGF. We previously showed that EGF is unable to 
activate B-Raf in cells lacking IQGAP1. However, the mechanism by which IQGAP1 
links B-Raf to EGFR was unknown. Here we report that endogenous EGFR and IQGAP1 
co-localize and co-immunoprecipitate in cells. EGF has no effect on the 
association, but Ca(2+) attenuates binding. In vitro analysis demonstrated a 
direct association mediated through the IQ and kinase domains of IQGAP1 and 
EGFR, respectively. Calmodulin disrupts this interaction. Using a mass 
spectrometry-based assay, we show that EGF induces phosphorylation of IQGAP1 
Ser(1443), a residue known to be phosphorylated by PKC. This phosphorylation is 
eliminated by pharmacological inhibition of either EGFR or PKC and transfection 
with small interfering RNA directed against the PKCα isoform. In IQGAP1-null 
cells, EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR is severely attenuated. 
Normal levels of autophosphorylation are restored by reconstituting wild type 
IQGAP1 and enhanced by an IQGAP1 S1443D mutant. Collectively, these data 
demonstrate a functional interaction between IQGAP1 and EGFR and suggest that 
IQGAP1 modulates EGFR activation.

Introduction

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR 5 ; also known as ErbB1 or HER1) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 2 ). These receptors mediate signaling pathways that govern cell growth and differentiation. Overactivation of EGFR contributes to several human cancers ( 3 ). The EGFR comprises an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular region with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Binding of EGF to the extracellular domain causes receptor homo- or heterodimerization. This leads to phosphorylation of distinct tyrosine residues within the C-terminal tail, which then serve as docking sites for Src homology 2 domain-containing effectors. Stimulation of EGFR kinase activity triggers signaling through several downstream pathways. Binding of activated EGFR to Grb2 induces the Ras-Raf-MAPK cascade ( 4 ), whereas its association with phospholipase Cγ leads to inositol triphosphate formation and Ca 2+ mobilization ( 5 ). The EGFR signaling network is highly complex and relies heavily on the formation of multiprotein complexes.

IQGAP1 is a ubiquitously expressed 190-kDa protein (reviewed in Ref. 6 ). It contains several protein interaction domains, including an IQ region (containing four tandem IQ motifs), a calponin homology domain, and a WW domain. IQGAP1 participates in protein-protein interactions and integrates diverse signaling pathways ( 6 ). Proteins that bind IQGAP1 include calmodulin, Cdc42, Rac1, actin, β-catenin, Rap1, and cadherin (reviewed in Refs. 6 – 9 ). Importantly, IQGAP1 regulates the function of its binding partners. For example, IQGAP1 inhibits cell-cell adhesion mediated by the E-cadherin-β-catenin complex ( 10 , 11 ) and increases β-catenin-mediated transcription ( 12 ). IQGAP1 therefore plays a role in multiple cellular activities, ranging from cell-cell adhesion and transcriptional regulation to cell migration, proliferation, and neurite outgrowth ( 6 ). Furthermore, accruing evidence strongly implicates IQGAP1 and its interaction with several binding proteins in tumorigenesis ( 13 , 14 ) and microbial pathogenesis ( 15 ).

In recent years, multifunctional adaptor proteins known as scaffold proteins have come to be appreciated as important mediators of many signaling pathways ( 16 , 17 ). One of the best characterized scaffolds in the MAPK cascade is KSR (kinase suppressor of Ras). KSR binds to C-Raf, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2, and optimal KSR expression is required for maximal MAPK activation ( 18 , 19 ). We have documented that IQGAP1 is a scaffold for MAPK signaling ( 20 – 22 ). IQGAP1 binds directly to B-Raf ( 20 ), MEK1/2 ( 22 ), and ERK1/2 ( 21 ) and modulates MAPK activity in response to EGF ( 20 – 22 ), CD44 ( 23 ), and N-cadherin ( 24 ). Altering the intracellular concentration of IQGAP1 attenuates EGF-dependent MEK and ERK activation ( 21 , 22 ). Several stimuli activate MAPK signaling ( 25 ). Neither EGF, PDGF, nor VEGF is able to significantly activate B-Raf in IQGAP1-deficient cells ( 20 ). Reconstitution of IQGAP1-null cells with IQGAP1 restores the ability of EGF to increase B-Raf kinase activity, suggesting that IQGAP1 is necessary for activation of B-Raf by EGF ( 20 ). However, the mechanism by which IQGAP1 links B-Raf and the MAPK cascade to EGFR has so far remained unknown.

Here, we present evidence that IQGAP1 and EGFR associate both in vitro and in intact cells. EGF-induced activation of EGFR catalyzes phosphorylation of IQGAP1 at Ser 1443 . Importantly, IQGAP1 phosphorylation on Ser 1443 enhances EGF-stimulated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser 1443 enables IQGAP1 to modulate EGFR activation through a positive feedback mechanism. Collectively, these data establish IQGAP1 as a molecular scaffold that modulates EGFR activation.

DISCUSSION

When EGF binds to its receptor, it triggers a network of signaling pathways, culminating in responses ranging from cell division to death and motility to adhesion ( 1 ). Numerous adaptors and enzymes are recruited to these pathways and participate in signal transmission and regulating the cell's response to EGFR activation. Prior work from our laboratory has implicated IQGAP1 as a scaffold in EGF signaling ( 20 – 22 ). IQGAP1 binds directly to B-Raf, MEK, and ERK and is required for maximal activation of the MAPK cascade by EGF. Previously, we made the intriguing observation that IQGAP1 is necessary for EGF to stimulate B-Raf activity in cells ( 20 ). How this occurs is not known. Published reports have failed to identify an association between IQGAP1 and H-Ras ( 32 , 43 ), the protein directly upstream of B-Raf. Any associations with other upstream molecules via which IQGAP1 might link EGF to B-Raf are also unknown. In this study, we propose a link between EGF, IQGAP1, and B-Raf signaling by demonstrating a functional interaction between EGFR and IQGAP1. Unexpectedly, we found that IQGAP1 is necessary for EGF to fully activate EGFR.

Analysis by both immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry reveals that IQGAP1 associates constitutively with EGFR. These data are consistent with recent observations that IQGAP1 can associate with EGFR from cells transfected with lipid raft-tethered RasV12 ( 44 ). Additionally, a proteomic screen identified IQGAP1 as being recruited to the activated Grb2-EGFR complex ( 45 ). Although these observations suggest an interaction between the two proteins, the possibility of an indirect association via a complex cannot be excluded. We show here for the first time with purified proteins that IQGAP1 and EGFR interact directly.

Evidence from several other groups suggests that IQGAP1 participates in multiple signaling cascades mediated by a heterogeneous group of receptors ( 6 ). For example, IQGAP1 interacts with the VEGF receptor (VEGFR2) ( 46 ), the hyaluronan receptor CD44 ( 23 ), the AMPA receptor subunit GluR4 ( 47 ), and FGFR1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) ( 48 ). However, in contrast to VEGFR2 or FGFR2, where association with IQGAP1 seems to require activation of the receptors, we have shown here the interaction between IQGAP1 and EGFR appears to be ligand-independent.

Although the interaction between IQGAP1 and EGFR in cells appears to be independent of receptor activation, it is dependent on Ca 2+ . However, the disruption of the EGFR-IQGAP1 complex by Ca 2+ in cells, but not in vitro , suggests that calmodulin plays a potential role in this interaction. Prior studies have shown that calmodulin reduces the association between IQGAP1 and all binding partners that have been examined. The N-terminal half of IQGAP1 contains four IQ motifs, which bind calmodulin ( 36 ), and Ca 2+ augments this interaction ( 26 , 29 , 33 ). Because the IQ domains are necessary for EGFR to bind IQGAP1, it is reasonable to postulate that the presence of Ca 2+ /calmodulin in the IQ domains blocks access to EGFR binding. In contrast to most other IQGAP1 binding partners, EGFR also binds calmodulin directly ( 49 ), and Ca 2+ is required for calmodulin to bind to the EGFR at the juxtamembrane region of the receptor (residues 645–660) ( 49 ). Thus, in intact cells, EGFR binding to Ca 2+ /calmodulin may also abrogate its interaction with IQGAP1.

Whereas apocalmodulin does not bind EGFR, it does bind IQGAP1. Nevertheless, there are several reasons why apocalmodulin does not block the interaction between IQGAP1 and EGFR in cells, including the low affinity of apocalmodulin for IQGAP1. Apocalmodulin has an ∼2.5-fold lower affinity for IQGAP1 than Ca 2+ /calmodulin ( 29 ), rendering it more susceptible to competition. For example, β-catenin can partially displace apocalmodulin, but not Ca 2+ /calmodulin, from IQGAP1 ( 12 ).

EGF, although not altering the association of EGFR with IQGAP1, elicits two important functional sequelae. It stimulates phosphorylation of IQGAP1 on Ser 1443 , and this phosphorylation is necessary for EGF to maximally promote EGFR autophosphorylation. Using siRNA, we targeted the TPA-responsive PKC isoenzymes expressed in HeLa cells ( 42 ) and identified PKCα as the isoform responsible for IQGAP1 phosphorylation in cells in response to EGF. Although phorbol esters have been shown to promote IQGAP1 phosphorylation at Ser 1443 , this work is the first conclusive evidence for in vivo phosphorylation of IQGAP1 in response to a physiological stimulus.

We did not find any evidence for IQGAP1 phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, either by mass spectrometry or Western blot analysis. Using unbiased mass spectrometry techniques that detect phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine equally, we found that only Ser 1443 was activated in response to EGF (data not shown). By Western blot, phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity is only detected when EGFR protein can also be detected (see Fig. 1 , C and D ). When IQGAP1 is immunoprecipitated in the presence of Ca 2+ , no phosphotyrosine signal is detected (EGFR does not co-purify).

Limited data exist on the functional consequences of IQGAP1 phosphorylation. Neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells is significantly enhanced by expression of a Ser 1443 phosphomimetic ( 28 ). PKCϵ-mediated phosphorylation of IQGAP1 participates in wound closure of bronchial epithelial cells ( 50 ), and NIH3T3 cells can be transformed by stable expression of IQGAP1 Ser 1443 phosphomimetic ( 51 ). The molecular mechanisms underlying these findings are unknown, although Ser 1443 phosphorylation on IQGAP1 was reported to affect binding to Cdc42 ( 37 ). Using transfected full-length IQGAP1 phosphomimetic and phosphodefective mutants in IQGAP1-null MEFs, we found that neither subcellular localization nor the extent of self-association differed significantly between the phosphomutants and wild-type IQGAP1 (data not shown). Additionally, in vitro binding assays did not reveal differences in the ability of the phosphomutants to bind either EGFR or calmodulin (data not shown).

The kinetics of PKCα-mediated Ser 1443 phosphorylation in response to EGF mirror the activation kinetics of EGFR. In a recent proteomics study, the temporal dynamics of the HeLa phosphoproteome in response to EGF was statistically grouped into six clusters, including one deemed signal initiators ( 52 ). Based on our data, Ser 1443 phosphorylation kinetics match those in the signal initiator cluster, which is enriched with proteins involved in membrane-proximal signaling events ( 42 , 52 ).

Previous studies have established that, following EGF stimulation, PKCα is activated and translocates from the nucleus to the membrane, where it phosphorylates EGFR at Thr 654, leading to receptor internalization and down-regulation of EGFR signaling ( 53 – 56 ). In light of this, it is significant that PKCα also phosphorylates IQGAP1 and that phospho-IQGAP1 modulates EGFR autophosphorylation during signal initiation.

Our data show that in the absence of IQGAP1, EGF induces minimal tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR and that reconstitution of IQGAP1-null cells with IQGAP1 significantly augments this phosphorylation. Our findings are consistent with the recent report that reducing IQGAP1 expression impaired phosphorylation of EGFR resulting from Ras activation at lipid rafts ( 44 ). Although it is as yet unclear how IQGAP1 facilitates EGFR activation, the site on EGFR where IQGAP1 binds may be relevant to our findings. Because IQGAP1 binds directly to the EGFR kinase domain, it is possible that this interaction alters the catalytic activity of the kinase, thus facilitating trans-autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the C-terminal tail ( 57 ). Another possibility is that the EGFR is phosphorylated by a non-receptor tyrosine kinase. c-Src, which catalyzes tyrosine phosphorylation of several sites within the EGFR ( 58 – 61 ), is a potential candidate. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that c-Src acts as an adaptor to bridge IQGAP1 to VEGFR-2 ( 62 ).

Replacing WT IQGAP1 with the phosphomimetic IQGAP1-SED construct significantly enhances the effect of IQGAP1 on EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR. This observation suggests that phosphorylation of IQGAP1 on Ser 1443 induced by EGF produces a positive feedback loop that stimulates EGFR activity. The molecular mechanism underlying this effect is not known. Regardless of the mechanism, our data indicate that IQGAP1 is required for EGF to maximally stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR.

Collectively, the data presented here enhance our comprehension of EGF signaling and provide additional insight into the established MAPK scaffold function of IQGAP1. We show that IQGAP1 serves as both a target and an effector of EGFR signaling, and regulation of IQGAP1 through phosphorylation at Ser 1443 is likely to play an important role in this function. Moreover, the direct interaction of IQGAP1 with multiple components of the MAPK cascade, namely EGFR, B-Raf, MEK, and ERK, firmly establishes IQGAP1 as an important scaffold in the EGF-stimulated MAPK cascade.
