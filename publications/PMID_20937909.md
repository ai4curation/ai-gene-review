Arginine methylation modulates diverse cellular processes and represents a 
molecular signature of germ-line-specific Piwi family proteins. A subset of 
Tudor domains recognize arginine methylation modifications, but the binding 
mechanism has been lacking. Here we establish that, like other germ-line Tudor 
proteins, the ancestral staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing 1 (SND1) 
polypeptide is expressed and associates with PIWIL1/Miwi in germ cells. We find 
that human SND1 binds PIWIL1 in an arginine methylation-dependent manner with a 
preference for symmetrically dimethylated arginine. The entire Tudor domain and 
a bifurcated SN domain are required for this binding activity, whereas the 
canonical Tudor domain alone is insufficient for methylarginine ligand binding. 
Crystal structures show that the intact SND1 extended Tudor domain forms a wide 
and negatively charged binding groove, which can accommodate distinct 
symmetrically dimethylated arginine peptides from PIWIL1 in different 
orientations. This analysis explains how SND1 preferentially recognizes 
symmetrical dimethylarginine via an aromatic cage and conserved hydrogen bonds, 
and provides a general paradigm for the binding mechanisms of 
methylarginine-containing peptides by extended Tudor domains.

Abstract

Arginine methylation modulates diverse cellular processes and represents a molecular signature of germ-line-specific Piwi family proteins. A subset of Tudor domains recognize arginine methylation modifications, but the binding mechanism has been lacking. Here we establish that, like other germ-line Tudor proteins, the ancestral staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing 1 (SND1) polypeptide is expressed and associates with PIWIL1/Miwi in germ cells. We find that human SND1 binds PIWIL1 in an arginine methylation-dependent manner with a preference for symmetrically dimethylated arginine. The entire Tudor domain and a bifurcated SN domain are required for this binding activity, whereas the canonical Tudor domain alone is insufficient for methylarginine ligand binding. Crystal structures show that the intact SND1 extended Tudor domain forms a wide and negatively charged binding groove, which can accommodate distinct symmetrically dimethylated arginine peptides from PIWIL1 in different orientations. This analysis explains how SND1 preferentially recognizes symmetrical dimethylarginine via an aromatic cage and conserved hydrogen bonds, and provides a general paradigm for the binding mechanisms of methylarginine-containing peptides by extended Tudor domains.

Discussion

Protein arginine methylation, catalyzed by PRMTs, modulates cellular processes such as mRNA splicing, DNA repair, transcription regulation, and signal transduction. These functions are believed to be mediated by methylarginine binding proteins. Thus far, a subset of Tudor domains from proteins, such as SMN and TDRDs, are the only modules identified as binding arginine methylation marks. Here we reported the crystal structures of the extended Tudor domain of SND1 in complex with two PIWIL1 N-terminal peptides harboring single symmetrically dimethylated arginines, and provide the structural basis for the binding preference of the extended Tudor domain for symmetrically dimethylated arginine. Like methyllysine-binding domains, the SND1 extended Tudor domain uses an aromatic cage to recognize methylated residues. Interestingly, in their unliganded forms, the Tudor domains of methylarginine-binding SMN and TDRD3 also have such an aromatic cage, although in the SMN structure the aromatic cage is not preformed because W102 occupies the binding pocket ( Fig. S5 ). Presumably, W102 in SMN will flip out to allow the methylarginine residue to reside in the aromatic cage. Hence, our complex structures of SND1 with PIWIL1 peptides provide a general binding mechanism for methylarginine recognition.

Arginine methylation sites on the N termini of Piwi proteins are evolutionarily conserved. The RG/RA-rich clusters provide docking sites for proteins with Tudor domains ( 8 ), resembling the recognition of histone modifications by methyllysine-binding domains. Given that there are six arginine sites in the first RG/RA-rich cluster on the PIWIL1/Miwi N terminus, multiple arginine residues may be methylated simultaneously. Our binding data showed that a peptide with three symmetrically dimethylated arginines (R4, R10, and R14) only showed slightly increased affinity toward the extended Tudor domain of SND1, indicating that one methylarginine is adequate for binding a single extended Tudor, and that there is no obvious requirement for multivalent interactions. However, it is conceivable that multiple methylation sites may increase the local concentration of available methylated ligands and enhance the possibility of initial recruitment of the extended Tudor domain. On the other hand, some germ-line Tudor domain proteins contain multiple Tudor domains. For instance, TDRD6 has eight different Tudor domains, which potentially could bind multiple distinct arginine methylation marks at the same time ( 30 ). Regardless, our finding that the binding surface of the SND1 extended Tudor domain can bind methylated peptides in opposite orientations suggests a surprising plasticity in its ability to accommodate arginine methylated sites. During the preparation of our manuscript, a significant study has shown the crystal structure of extended Tudor domain of Drosophila Tudor with arginine methylated peptides of Drosophila Aubergine ( 26 ). As predicted ( 19 ), the extended Tudor domain of the Drosophila Tudor protein displays similar domain folds and conserved aromatic cage residues for binding sDMA to the ancestral SND1 polypeptide. Together, these findings underscore a previously underappreciated requirement of the flanking sequences of canonical Tudor core domain in assisting the binding of methylarginine-containing peptides, a feature that is likely conserved across germ-line Tudor proteins ( 19 ).

A role for SND1 in small RNA pathways was first suggested by the discovery of SND1 as a component of RNA induced silencing complex of the siRNA pathway. Subsequently, SND1 has been shown to bind and cleave inosine-containing hyperedited micro-RNAs through its SN domains ( 31 ). However, the binding substrates for SND1 Tudor domain in these physiological contexts are still unclear. In this study, we showed the coexpression and interaction of PIWIL1/Miwi and SND1, suggesting a previously undescribed function for SND1 in regulating piRNA pathways. It will be of considerable interest to investigate whether SND1 may affect piRNA biogenesis, processing, or stability. A mouse knockout model is necessary to further understand the biological role of SND1 in these processes.
