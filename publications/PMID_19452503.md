The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a Gs protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 
expressed in melanocytes, is a major determinant of skin pigmentation and 
phototype. MC1R activation stimulates melanogenesis and increases the ratio of 
black, strongly photoprotective eumelanins to reddish, poorly photoprotective 
pheomelanins. Several MC1R alleles are associated with red hair, fair skin, 
increased sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation (the RHC phenotype) and increased 
skin cancer risk. Three highly penetrant RHC variants, R151C, R160W, and D294H 
are loss-of-function MC1R mutants with altered cell surface expression. In this 
study, we show that forward trafficking was normal for D294H. Conversely, export 
traffic was impaired for R151C, which accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER), and for R160W, which was enriched in the cis-Golgi. This is the first 
report of steady-state retention in a post-ER secretory compartment of a GPCR 
mutant found in the human population. Residues R151 and R160 are located in the 
MC1R second intracellular loop (il2). Two other mutations in il2, T157A 
preventing T157 phosphorylation and R162P disrupting a (160)RARR(163) motif, 
also caused intracellular retention. Moreover, T157 was phosphorylated in 
wild-type MC1R and a T157D mutation mimicking constitutive phosphorylation 
allowed normal traffic, and rescued the retention phenotype of R160W and R162P. 
Therefore, MC1R export is likely regulated by T157 phosphorylation and the 
(160)RARR(163) arginine-based motif functions as an ER retrieval signal. These 
elements are conserved in mammalian MC1Rs and in all five types of human 
melanocortin receptors. Thus, members of this GPCR subfamily might share common 
mechanisms for regulation of plasma membrane expression.
