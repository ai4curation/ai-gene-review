Six alpha-defensins have been found in humans. These small arginine-rich 
peptides play important roles in various processes related to host defense, 
being the effectors and regulators of innate immunity as well as enhancers of 
adoptive immune responses. Four defensins, called neutrophil peptides 1 through 
4, are stored primarily in polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Major sites of 
expression of defensins 5 and 6 are Paneth cells of human small intestine. So 
far, only one structure of human alpha-defensin (HNP3) has been reported, and 
the properties of the intestine defensins 5 and 6 are particularly poorly 
understood. In this report, we present the high-resolution X-ray structures of 
three human defensins, 4 through 6, supplemented with studies of their 
antimicrobial and chemotactic properties. Despite only modest amino acid 
sequence identity, all three defensins share their tertiary structures with 
other known alpha- and beta-defensins. Like HNP3 but in contrast to murine or 
rabbit alpha-defensins, human defensins 4-6 form characteristic dimers. Whereas 
antimicrobial and chemotactic activity of HNP4 is somewhat comparable to that of 
other human neutrophil defensins, neither of the intestinal defensins appears to 
be chemotactic, and for HD6 also an antimicrobial activity has yet to be 
observed. The unusual biological inactivity of HD6 may be associated with its 
structural properties, somewhat standing out when compared with other human 
alpha-defensins. The strongest cationic properties and unique distribution of 
charged residues on the molecular surface of HD5 may be associated with its 
highest bactericidal activity among human alpha-defensins.
