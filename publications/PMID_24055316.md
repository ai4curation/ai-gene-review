p97 (also called VCP and CDC-48) is an AAA+ chaperone, which consists of a 
substrate/cofactor-binding N domain and two ATPase domains (D1 and D2), and 
forms a homo-hexameric ring. p97 plays crucial roles in a variety of cellular 
processes such as the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, the endoplasmic 
reticulum-associated protein degradation, autophagy, and modulation of protein 
aggregates. Mutations in human p97 homolog VCP are linked to neurodegenerative 
diseases. The key mechanism of p97 in these various functions has been proposed 
to be the disassembly of protein complexes. To understand the molecular 
mechanism of p97, we studied the conformational changes of hexameric CDC-48.1, a 
Caenorhabditis elegans p97 homolog, using high-speed atomic force microscopy. In 
the presence of ATP, the N-D1 ring repeatedly rotates ~23 ± 8° clockwise and 
resets relative to the D2 ring. Mutational analysis reveals that this rotation 
is induced by ATP binding to the D2 domain.
