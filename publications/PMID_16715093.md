PUF proteins, a family of RNA-binding proteins, interact with the 3' 
untranslated regions (UTRs) of specific mRNAs to control their translation and 
stability. PUF protein action is commonly correlated with removal of the poly(A) 
tail of target mRNAs. Here, we focus on how PUF proteins enhance deadenylation 
and mRNA decay. We show that a yeast PUF protein physically binds Pop2p, which 
is a component of the Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not deadenylase complex, and that Pop2p is 
required for PUF repression activity. By binding Pop2p, the PUF protein 
simultaneously recruits the Ccr4p deadenylase and two other enzymes involved in 
mRNA regulation, Dcp1p and Dhh1p. We reconstitute regulated deadenylation in 
vitro and demonstrate that the PUF-Pop2p interaction is conserved in yeast, 
worms and humans. We suggest that the PUF-Pop2p interaction underlies regulated 
deadenylation, mRNA decay and repression by PUF proteins.
