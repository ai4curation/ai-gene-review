Bacteria are equipped with two-component systems to cope with environmental 
changes, and auxiliary proteins provide response to additional stimuli. The Cpx 
two-component system is the global modulator of cell envelope stress in 
gram-negative bacteria that integrates very different signals and consists of 
the kinase CpxA, the regulator CpxR, and the dual function auxiliary protein 
CpxP. CpxP both inhibits activation of CpxA and is indispensable for the quality 
control system of P pili that are crucial for uropathogenic Escherichia coli 
during kidney colonization. How these two essential biological functions of CpxP 
are linked is not known. Here, we report the crystal structure of CpxP at 1.45 Å 
resolution with two monomers being interdigitated like "left hands" forming a 
cap-shaped dimer. Our combined structural and functional studies suggest that 
CpxP inhibits the kinase CpxA through direct interaction between its concave 
polar surface and the negatively charged sensor domain on CpxA. Moreover, an 
extended hydrophobic cleft on the convex surface suggests a potent substrate 
recognition site for misfolded pilus subunits. Altogether, the structural 
details of CpxP provide a first insight how a periplasmic two-component system 
inhibitor blocks its cognate kinase and is released from it.
