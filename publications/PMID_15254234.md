Regulation of cell polarity is an important biological event that governs 
diverse cell functions such as localization of embryonic determinants and 
establishment of tissue and organ architecture. The Rho family GTPases and the 
polarity complex Par6/Par3/atypical protein kinase C (PKC) play a key role in 
the signaling pathway, but the molecules that regulate upstream signaling are 
still not known. Here we identified the guanine nucleotide exchange factor ECT2 
as an activator of the polarity complex. ECT2 interacted with Par6 as well as 
Par3 and PKCzeta. Coexpression of Par6 and ECT2 efficiently activated Cdc42 in 
vivo. Overexpression of ECT2 also stimulated the PKCzeta activity, whereas 
dominant-negative ECT2 inhibited the increase in PKCzeta activity stimulated by 
Par6. ECT2 localization was detected at sites of cell-cell contact as well as in 
the nucleus of MDCK cells. The expression and localization of ECT2 were 
regulated by calcium, which is a critical regulator of cell-cell adhesion. 
Together, these results suggest that ECT2 regulates the polarity complex 
Par6/Par3/PKCzeta and possibly plays a role in epithelial cell polarity.
