Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein involved in iron metabolism. Defective 
expression of frataxin causes Friedreich ataxia (FA), an inherited degenerative 
syndrome characterized by ataxia, cardiomyopathy, and high incidence of 
diabetes. Here we report that frataxin-deficient cells are more prone to undergo 
stress-induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis, while the overexpression of 
frataxin confers protection to a variety of cell types. Moreover, we reveal the 
existence of an extramitochondrial pool of frataxin, which can efficiently 
prevent mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in different cellular systems. 
Remarkably, extramitochondrial frataxin can fully replace mitochondrial frataxin 
in promoting survival of FA cells.
