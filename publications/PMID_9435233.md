Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce a variety of cellular responses at low 
picomolar concentrations. This is in apparent conflict with the published 
dissociation constants for TNF binding to TNF receptors in the order of 100-500 
pM. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the outstanding cellular sensitivity 
to TNF, we determined the binding characteristics of TNF to both human TNF 
receptors at 37 degrees C. Calculation of the dissociation constant (Kd) from 
the association and dissociation rate constants determined at 37 degrees C 
revealed a remarkable high affinity for TNF binding to the 60-kDa TNF type 1 
receptor (TNF-R1; Kd = 1.9 x 10(-11) M) and a significantly lower affinity for 
the 80-kDa TNF type 2 receptor (TNF-R2; Kd = 4.2 x 10(-10) M). The high affinity 
determined for TNF-R1 is mainly caused by the marked stability of 
ligand-receptor complexes in contrast to the transient interaction of soluble 
TNF with TNF-R2. These data can readily explain the predominant role of TNF-R1 
in induction of cellular responses by soluble TNF and suggest the stability of 
the TNF-TNF receptor complexes as a rationale for their differential signaling 
capability. In accordance with this reasoning, the lower signaling capability of 
homotrimeric lymphotoxin, compared with TNF, correlates with a lower stability 
of the lymphotoxin-TNF-R1 complex at 37 degrees C.
