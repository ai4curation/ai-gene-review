Tec, Btk, Itk, Bmx, and Txk constitute the Tec family of protein tyrosine 
kinases (PTKs), a family with the distinct feature of containing a pleckstrin 
homology (PH) domain. Tec acts in signaling pathways triggered by the B cell 
antigen receptor (BCR), cytokine receptors, integrins, and receptor-type PTKs. 
Although upstream regulators of Tec family kinases are relatively well 
characterized, little is known of the downstream effectors of these enzymes. The 
yeast two-hybrid system has identified several proteins that interact with the 
kinase domain of Tec, one of which is now revealed to be a previously unknown 
docking protein termed BRDG1 (BCR downstream signaling 1). BRDG1 contains a 
proline-rich motif, a PH domain, and multiple tyrosine residues that are 
potential target sites for Src homology 2 domains. In 293 cells expressing 
recombinant BRDG1 and various PTKs, Tec and Pyk2, but not Btk, Bmx, Lyn, Syk, or 
c-Abl, induced marked phosphorylation of BRDG1 on tyrosine residues. BRDG1 was 
also phosphorylated by Tec directly in vitro. Efficient phosphorylation of BRDG1 
by Tec required the PH and SH2 domains as well as the kinase domain of the 
latter. Furthermore, BRDG1 was shown to participate in a positive feedback loop 
by increasing the activity of Tec. BRDG1 transcripts are abundant in the human B 
cell line Ramos, and the endogenous protein underwent tyrosine phosphorylation 
in response to BCR stimulation. BRDG1 thus appears to function as a docking 
protein acting downstream of Tec in BCR signaling.
