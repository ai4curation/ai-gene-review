JAK-STAT-activated gene expression is both rapid and transient and requires 
dynamic post-translational modification of the chromatin template. Previously, 
we showed that following IFN-γ treatment, trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 
79 (H3K79me3) is rapidly and highly induced in the 5'-end of the STAT1-dependent 
gene interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), but the role of this histone 
modification was unexplored. Here we report that DOT1L, the non-SET domain 
containing methyltransferase that modifies Lys-79, is localized across IRF1 in 
the uninduced state and is not further recruited by IFN-γ induction. 
RNAi-mediated depletion of DOT1L prevents the induction of H3K79me3 and lowers 
the transcription of IRF1 2-fold, as expected. Surprisingly, STAT1 binding to 
its DNA recognition element near the IRF1 promoter is diminished 2-fold in the 
DOT1L-depleted cell line. In vivo and in vitro protein interaction assays reveal 
a DOT1L-STAT1 interaction. Domain mapping identifies the middle region of DOT1L 
(amino acids 580-1183) as the STAT1 interaction domain. Overexpression of the 
DOT1L STAT1 interaction domain represses IRF1 transcription (2-fold) and 
interferes with STAT1 DNA binding at IRF1 and endogenous DOT1L histone 
methyltransferase activity. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel 
STAT1-DOT1L interaction that is required for the regulation JAK-STAT-inducible 
gene expression.
