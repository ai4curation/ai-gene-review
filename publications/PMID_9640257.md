Human placental trophoblast expresses as unusual repertoire of major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I products that appears to reflect the 
unique role of this epithelium in mediating feto-maternal relations during 
pregnancy. Trophoblast is devoid of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A,-B antigens 
but can express one or more non-HLA-A,-B class I proteins. The human 
choriocarcinoma cell lines JEG-3, BeWo and JAR are widely used as models to 
study trophoblast. During attempts to isolate non-HLA-A,-B class I from JEG-3 
and BeWo by immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody to beta 
2-microglobulin we observed a 55,000 MW protein co-purifying with class I. 
N-terminal amino acid sequencing and immunoblotting using a specific antiserum 
identified this product as calreticulin, a molecule recently shown to be 
involved in the assembly of classical class I in human B-lymphoblastoid cells. 
In our hands JEG-3 and BeWo were found to express 45,000 MW non-HLA-A,-B class I 
proteins while the 40,000 MW HLA-G product was identified only in JEG-3. Our 
data suggest that calreticulin associates with non-HLA-A,-B class I heterodimers 
and with free 45,000 MW non-HLA-A,-B class I H chains in JEG-3. JAR was found to 
be devoid of detectable class I H chains but contained beta 2-microglobulin and 
calreticulin. However, calreticulin-beta 2-microglobulin complexes were not 
detected in JAR. Calreticulin and class I were apparently co-localized within 
the endoplasmic reticulum of JEG-3 cells whereas only class I was expressed at 
the cell surface. These studies demonstrate that calreticulin is associated with 
non-HLA-A,-B class I products in human choriocarcinoma cells.

Abstract

Human placental trophoblast expresses as unusual repertoire of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I products that appears to reflect the unique role of this epithelium in mediating feto-maternal relations during pregnancy. Trophoblast is devoid of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A,-B antigens but can express one or more non-HLA-A,-B class I proteins. The human choriocarcinoma cell lines JEG-3, BeWo and JAR are widely used as models to study trophoblast. During attempts to isolate non-HLA-A,-B class I from JEG-3 and BeWo by immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody to beta 2-microglobulin we observed a 55,000 MW protein co-purifying with class I. N-terminal amino acid sequencing and immunoblotting using a specific antiserum identified this product as calreticulin, a molecule recently shown to be involved in the assembly of classical class I in human B-lymphoblastoid cells. In our hands JEG-3 and BeWo were found to express 45,000 MW non-HLA-A,-B class I proteins while the 40,000 MW HLA-G product was identified only in JEG-3. Our data suggest that calreticulin associates with non-HLA-A,-B class I heterodimers and with free 45,000 MW non-HLA-A,-B class I H chains in JEG-3. JAR was found to be devoid of detectable class I H chains but contained beta 2-microglobulin and calreticulin. However, calreticulin-beta 2-microglobulin complexes were not detected in JAR. Calreticulin and class I were apparently co-localized within the endoplasmic reticulum of JEG-3 cells whereas only class I was expressed at the cell surface. These studies demonstrate that calreticulin is associated with non-HLA-A,-B class I products in human choriocarcinoma cells.
