Cell surface growth factor receptors couple environmental cues to the regulation 
of cytoplasmic homeostatic processes, including autophagy, and aberrant 
activation of such receptors is a common feature of human malignancies. Here, we 
defined the molecular basis by which the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
tyrosine kinase regulates autophagy. Active EGFR binds the autophagy protein 
Beclin 1, leading to its multisite tyrosine phosphorylation, enhanced binding to 
inhibitors, and decreased Beclin 1-associated VPS34 kinase activity. EGFR 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy disrupts Beclin 1 tyrosine 
phosphorylation and binding to its inhibitors and restores autophagy in 
non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells with a TKI-sensitive EGFR mutation. 
In NSCLC tumor xenografts, the expression of a tyrosine phosphomimetic Beclin 1 
mutant leads to reduced autophagy, enhanced tumor growth, tumor 
dedifferentiation, and resistance to TKI therapy. Thus, oncogenic receptor 
tyrosine kinases directly regulate the core autophagy machinery, which may 
contribute to tumor progression and chemoresistance.

Introduction

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), an oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase, links extracellular signals to cellular homeostasis. In normal cells, EGFR signaling is triggered by the binding of growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), leading to homodimerization or heterodimerization with other EGFR family members (such as HER2/neu) and autophosphorylation of the intracellular domain ( Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010 ). The phosphotyrosines formed serve as a docking site for adaptor molecules, which results in the activation of signaling pathways including the Ras/MAPK pathway, the PI3K/Akt pathway, and STAT signaling pathways. In tumor cells, the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR may be dysregulated by EGFR gene mutation, increased EGFR gene copy number, or EGFR protein overexpression, leading to aberrant EGFR signaling and increased tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion and metastasis ( Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008 ). EGFR signaling is deregulated in many human cancers, including those of the lung, head and neck, colon, pancreas, and brain.

The deregulation of EGFR in human cancers has led to the development of anticancer agents that target EGFR, including: (1) anti-EGFR antibodies that inhibit ligand binding: and (2) small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), erlotinib and gefitinib, that block EGFR intracellular tyrosine kinase activity. Although the EGFR TKIs have shown limited clinical benefit in the majority of solid tumors, they are effective in non-small lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) that harbor specific mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR (most commonly, in-frame deletion in exon 19 around codons 746-750 or single-base substitution, L858R, in exon 21) ( Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008 ; Lynch et al., 2004 ; Pao and Chmielecki, 2010 ). Most patients with NSCLCs with EGFR mutations initially respond favorably to erlotinib or gefitinib, suggesting these mutations drive tumorigenesis. However, among tumors that initially respond to EGFR TKIs, most eventually acquire resistance, often due to the emergence of a secondary mutation, T790M, in the kinase domain of EGFR ( Pao and Chmielecki, 2010 ).

Several studies have shown that EGFR signaling regulates autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway that functions in cellular homeostasis and protection against a variety of diseases, including cancer ( Levine and Kroemer, 2008 ). The downstream targets of EGFR – PI3K, Akt, and mTOR – are well-established negative regulators of autophagy ( Botti et al., 2006 ). Moreover, EGFR inhibitors induce autophagy in NSCLCs ( Gorzalczany et al., 2011 ; Han et al., 2011 ) and other cancer cells ( Fung et al., 2012 ). However, the links between EGFR signaling and autophagy remain poorly understood, particularly (1) the molecular mechanisms by which EGFR signaling suppresses autophagy; (2) the role of EGFR suppression of autophagy in lung cancer pathogenesis; and (3) the role of autophagy induction in the response to TKI therapy. EGFR inhibitor-induced autophagy in lung cancer cells has been postulated to exert either cytoprotective ( Han et al., 2011 ) or cytotoxic ( Gorzalczany et al., 2011 ) effects.

Conflicting results regarding the role of autophagy in the response or resistance to EGFR TKI treatment reflects broader uncertainties in the role of autophagy in cancer therapy ( Rubinsztein et al., 2012 ). It is not understood in what contexts autophagy induction contributes to tumor progression or suppression and to tumor chemoresistance or chemosensitivity. There is a general consensus that autophagy prevents tumor initiation, as loss-of-function mutations of several different autophagy genes results in spontaneous tumorigenesis ( beclin 1, Atg5, Atg7 ) and/or increased chemical-induced tumorigenesis ( Atg4C ) in mice ( Rubinsztein et al., 2012 ). Despite this inhibitory role in tumor initiation, it has been proposed that autophagy may promote the growth of established tumors and contribute to chemoresistance, principally through its actions to prolong the survival of metabolically-stressed neoplastic cells ( Rubinsztein et al., 2012 ).

To understand the relationship between oncogenic signaling, autophagy, and distinct stages of tumorigenesis, it is important to define the molecular mechanisms by which oncogenic signaling regulates autophagy. We recently showed that the oncogene Akt inhibits autophagy independently of mTOR signaling via serine phosphorylation of the essential autophagy protein, Beclin 1 ( Wang et al., 2012 ), a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor protein frequently monoallelically deleted in human breast and ovarian cancer ( Levine and Kroemer, 2008 ). Moreover, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Beclin 1 contributes to Akt-dependent fibroblast transformation, supporting the concept that inactivation of Beclin 1-dependent autophagy plays a role in tumor initiation. However, it is not known whether oncogenic inactivation of Beclin 1 (or other autophagy proteins) influences progression of established tumors and/or their response to therapy.

Here we identify the molecular basis by which EGFR tyrosine kinase activity regulates autophagy. We show that active EGFR binds to Beclin 1, leading to its tyrosine phosphorylation, alteration of its interactome, and inhibition of its autophagy function. A mutant of Beclin 1 containing phosphomimetic mutations in the EGFR-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation sites enhances autophagy suppression in EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells, resulting in enhanced tumor progression, altered tumor cell differentiation, and partial tumor resistance to EGFR TKI therapy. These findings demonstrate a heretofore unknown link between oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases and the autophagy machinery, which may contribute to tumor progression and resistance to targeted therapy.

Mutational Activation of EGFR and Ligand Stimulation of Wild-Type EGFR Results in Beclin 1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation

We investigated whether regulation of Beclin 1 function by active EGFR involves Beclin 1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Beclin 1 was tyrosine phosphorylated in NSCLC cells with WT EGFR after EGF stimulation ( Figure 5D ) and in NSCLC cells with active EGFR mutations (HCC827 and H1975 cells) ( Figure 5A ). This was decreased by erlotinib in TKI-sensitive HCC827 cells but not TKI-resistant H1975 cells. Inhibition of c-Met, another oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase activated in HCC827 cells, did not block Beclin 1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and Beclin 1 did not co-immunoprecipitate with active c-Met ( Figure S5A, S5B ). This suggests that active EGFR (but not other receptor tyrosine kinases) is responsible for Beclin 1 tyrosine phosphorylation in HCC827 cells.

We identified sites of EGFR-mediated in vitro Beclin 1 phosphorylation using recombinant active EGFR L858R/T790M and two synthetic peptides derived from regions of Beclin 1 containing three database-identified candidate tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Y229, Y233 and Y352. Active EGFR phosphorylated the Beclin 1 peptide spanning amino acids 223-239 in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure S5C ), while control tyrosine kinases, including PDGFRβ, mutationally active PDGFRα T674I and SRMS, did not (data not shown). Mutation of both Y229 and Y233 was required to block EGFR-dependent phosphorylation of the Beclin 1 amino acid 223-239 peptide. The peptide spanning Y352 (Beclin 1 amino acids 345-358) underwent low levels of phosphorylation at the highest peptide concentration examined. Thus, Beclin 1 Y229, Y233, and possibly Y352 may be substrates of EGFR-mediated Beclin 1 tyrosine phosphorylation.

To evaluate whether Beclin 1 Y229, Y233 and/or Y352 are required for Beclin 1 tyrosine phosphorylation in HCC827 NSCLC cells, we expressed Flag epitope-tagged WT and mutant Beclin 1 constructs. While the peptide spanning Beclin 1 Y352 was only mildly phosphorylated by active EGFR in vitro , simultaneous mutation of all three candidate tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Y229F, Y233F and Y352F) in full-length Beclin 1 was required to block Beclin 1 tyrosine phosphorylation ( Figure 5B , Figure S5D ). Thus, in NSCLC cells with active EGFR, three Beclin 1 tyrosine residues — Y229, Y233 and Y352 — are phosphorylated. These residues are conserved in Beclin 1 throughout metazoan evolution (data not shown).

Flag-Beclin 1 Y233 phosphorylation was detected in HCC827 cells transfected with WT Flag-Beclin 1 but not with mutant Flag-Beclin 1 Y233F using a phosphospecific antibody ( Figure 5C ). Endogenous Beclin 1 Y233 phosphorylation was detected in A549 cells expressing WT EGFR after EGF stimulation ( Figure 5D ) and in HCC827 and H1975 cells with active EGFR mutations ( Figure 5E ). This phosphorylation was blocked by erlotinib in HCC827 but not in H1975 cells. Thus, Beclin 1 Y233 phosphorylation is regulated by ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation of EGFR. Furthermore, NSCLC cells with activating mutations in EGFR (H1975, H3255 and HCC827) had detectable Beclin 1 Y233 phosphorylation, whereas cells with amplified wild-type EGFR (A549, H1703, H1819 and H2073), with amplified c-Met (H1933) or with K-Ras mutation (HCC4017, H2122) did not ( Figure 5F ), indicating that Beclin 1 Y233 phosphorylation may be a specific marker of mutationally active EGFR in NSCLC.

To evaluate the functional consequences of Beclin 1 tyrosine phosphorylation, we generated NSCLC cells that stably express WT Flag-Beclin 1 or Flag-Beclin 1 containing three non-phosphorylatable mutations, Y229F/Y233F/Y352F (FFF) or three phosphomimetic mutations, Y229E/Y233E/Y352E (EEE) ( Figure 5G ). Flag-Beclin 1 FFF interacted with active EGFR and its interactome was regulated by EGFR inhibition in a manner similar to that of WT Flag-Beclin 1. This most likely reflects the presence of endogenous Beclin 1 in these cells (which is tyrosine phosphorylated when EGFR is active) and the homodimerization of Beclin 1 FFF with WT Beclin 1 ( Figure 5H ), as Beclin 1 homodimerization is predicted to favor binding to Rubicon and Bcl-2 and disfavor binding to VPS34 (see model, Figure S5E ). In contrast, the phosphomimetic Beclin 1 EEE mutant escaped regulation by TKI treatment; erlotinib resulted in dephosphorylation of EGFR (indicating preserved receptor sensitivity to TKIs) but did not disrupt Beclin 1 EEE/EGFR, Beclin 1 EEE/Rubicon, or Beclin 1/Bcl-2 interactions, and did not increase the Beclin 1 EEE/VPS34 interaction or increase Beclin 1 EEE-associated VPS34 kinase activity. In addition, unlike WT Beclin 1 or Beclin 1 FFF, the Beclin 1 EEE mutant dimerized with itself or with WT Beclin 1 in HCC827 cells in the setting of EGFR inhibition ( Figure 5H ). Together, these findings indicate that the Beclin 1 EEE mutant mimics tyrosine phosphorylated Beclin 1.

Perhaps via constitutive dimerization with endogenous WT Beclin 1 ( Figure 5H ), Beclin 1 EEE functioned as a dominant negative mutant of TKI-induced autophagy. Despite the presence of endogenous Beclin 1 in NSCLC cells, overexpression of Beclin 1 EEE suppressed erlotinib-induced autophagy ( Figure 5G ). Thus, Beclin 1 tyrosine dephosphorylation (and disruption of Beclin 1 homodimerization) may be essential for TKI-induced autophagy. Moreover, a lower level of basal autophagy and Beclin 1-associated VPS34 kinase activity was observed in non-TKI-treated HCC827 cells expressing Beclin 1 EEE. This suggests that constitutive Beclin 1 tyrosine phosphorylation enhances autophagy suppression in cells with active EGFR mutation.

Inhibition of TKI-Induced Autophagy in NSCLC Xenografts Results in Resistance to TKI Therapy

We evaluated the effects of blocking TKI-mediated autophagy on the response of NSCLCs to TKI therapy. Since constitutive Beclin 1 EEE expression alters the natural history of HCC827 xenografts, we generated HCC827 cell lines that express tetracycline-inducible WT Beclin 1 or Beclin 1 Y229E/Y233E/Y352 (EEE) to induce protein expression in established tumors immediately prior to initiation of TKI therapy. We confirmed that doxycycline induction of Beclin 1 EEE expression (but not of WT Beclin 1) in HCC827 cells reduced levels of erlotinib-induced autophagy ( Figure 7A, 7B ). The suppression of erlotinib-induced autophagy by Beclin 1 EEE expression was associated with an increase in clonogenic survival of HCC827 cells after treatment with erlotinib ( Figure 7C ). A similar increase in clonogenic survival was also observed in erlotinib-treated HCC827 cells with ATG7 siRNA knockdown ( Figure S7A, S7B ), suggesting that autophagy suppression, rather than other potential effects of Beclin 1 EEE expression, contributes to TKI-resistance. Similarly, selective inhibition of autophagy (without inhibition of apoptosis) by a mutant viral Bcl-2 (M11 AAA) protein that binds to Beclin 1 but not Bax increased HCC827 clonogenic survival following treatment with erlotinib ( Figure S7C-G ).

We confirmed that these effects of autophagy suppression in vitro on NSCLC resistance to TKI therapy also occurred in vivo , using xenografts derived from HCC827 cells expressing tetracycline-inducible Beclin 1 EEE and from HCC827 cells expressing the mutant viral Bcl-2 protein. In HCC827 xenografts, induced expression of Beclin 1 EEE ( Figure 7D ) decreased numbers of autophagosomes one day after initiation of erlotinib ( Figure 7E, 7F ) and resulted in partial resistance to erlotinib ( Figure 7G ). In untreated control mice and in mice with induced expression of WT Beclin 1, there was complete regression of all tumor xenografts within 14 days ( Figure 7G ). In contrast, xenografts with induced expression of Beclin 1 EEE had a slower rate of tumor regression and all tumors remained at the end of the 28-day observation period. Similarly, xenografts derived from HCC827 cells expressing the viral Bcl-2 inhibitor of autophagy had decreased erlotinib-induced autophagy and were partially resistant to erlotinib ( Figure S7H-J ). Together, these results suggest that Beclin 1 tyrosine phosphorylation and autophagy suppression contribute to TKI resistance in NSCLCs with EGFR mutations.
