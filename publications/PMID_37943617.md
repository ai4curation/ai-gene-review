Comment in
    Hypomorphic human SEL1L and HRD1 variants uncouple multilayered 
ER-associated degradation machinery.

Suppressor of lin-12-like-HMG-CoA reductase degradation 1 (SEL1L-HRD1) 
ER-associated degradation (ERAD) plays a critical role in many physiological 
processes in mice, including immunity, water homeostasis, and energy metabolism; 
however, its relevance and importance in humans remain unclear, as no disease 
variant has been identified. Here, we report a biallelic SEL1L variant (p. 
Cys141Tyr) in 5 patients from a consanguineous Slovakian family. These patients 
presented with not only ERAD-associated neurodevelopmental disorders with onset 
in infancy (ENDI) syndromes, but infantile-onset agammaglobulinemia with no 
mature B cells, resulting in frequent infections and early death. This variant 
disrupted the formation of a disulfide bond in the luminal fibronectin II domain 
of SEL1L, largely abolishing the function of the SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD complex in part 
via proteasomal-mediated self destruction by HRD1. This study reports a disease 
entity termed ENDI-agammaglobulinemia (ENDI-A) syndrome and establishes an 
inverse correlation between SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD functionality and disease severity 
in humans.
