Type IV hemochromatosis is associated with dominant mutations in the SLC40A1 
gene encoding ferroportin (FPN). Known as the "ferroportin disease," this 
condition is typically characterized by high serum ferritin, reduced transferrin 
saturation, and macrophage iron loading. Previously FPN expression in vitro has 
been shown to cause iron deficiency in human cell lines and mediate iron export 
from Xenopus oocytes. We confirm these findings by showing that expression of 
human FPN in a human cell line results in an iron deficiency because of a 3-fold 
increased export of iron. We show that FPN mutations A77D, V162delta, and G490D 
that are associated with a typical pattern of disease in vivo cause a loss of 
iron export function in vitro but do not physically or functionally impede 
wild-type FPN. These mutants may, therefore, lead to disease by 
haploinsufficiency. By contrast the variants Y64N, N144D, N144H, Q248H, and 
C326Y, which can be associated with greater transferrin saturation and more 
prominent iron deposition in liver parenchyma in vivo, retained iron export 
function in vitro. Because FPN is a target for negative feedback in iron 
homeostasis, we postulate that the latter group of mutants may resist 
inhibition, resulting in a permanently "turned on" iron exporter.
