Proteins possessing a C-terminal CaaX motif, such as the Ras GTPases, undergo 
extensive post-translational modification that includes attachment of an 
isoprenoid lipid, proteolytic processing and carboxylmethylation. Inhibition of 
the enzymes involved in these processes is considered a cancer-therapeutic 
strategy. We previously identified nine in vitro inhibitors of the yeast CaaX 
protease Rce1p in a chemical library screen (Manandhar et al., 2007). Here, we 
demonstrate that these agents disrupt the normal plasma membrane distribution of 
yeast GFP-Ras reporters in a manner that pharmacologically phenocopies effects 
observed upon genetic loss of CaaX protease function. Consistent with Rce1p 
being the in vivo target of the inhibitors, we observe that compound-induced 
delocalization is suppressed by increasing the gene dosage of RCE1. Moreover, we 
observe that Rce1p biochemical activity associated with inhibitor-treated cells 
is inversely correlated with compound dose. Genetic loss of CaaX proteolysis 
results in mistargeting of GFP-Ras2p to subcellular foci that are positive for 
the endoplasmic reticulum marker Sec63p. Pharmacological inhibition of CaaX 
protease activity also delocalizes GFP-Ras2p to foci, but these foci are not as 
strongly positive for Sec63p. Lastly, we demonstrate that heterologously 
expressed human Rce1p can mediate proper targeting of yeast Ras and that its 
activity can also be perturbed by some of the above inhibitors. Together, these 
results indicate that disrupting the proteolytic modification of Ras GTPases 
impacts their in vivo trafficking.
