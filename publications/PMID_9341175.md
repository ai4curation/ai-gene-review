PTPH1 is a human protein-tyrosine phosphatase with homology to the band 4.1 
superfamily of cytoskeletal-associated proteins. PTPH1 was found to associate 
with 14-3-3beta using a yeast two-hybrid screen, and its interaction could be 
reconstituted in vitro using recombinant proteins. Examination of the 
interaction between 14-3-3beta and various deletion mutants of PTPH1 by 
two-hybrid tests suggested that the integrity of the PTP is important for this 
binding. Although both PTPH1 and Raf-1 form complexes with 14-3-3beta, they 
appear to do so independently. Binding of 14-3-3beta to PTPH1 in vitro was 
abolished by pretreating PTPH1 with potato acid phosphatase and was greatly 
enhanced by pretreating with Cdc25C-associated protein kinase. Thus the 
association between PTPH1 and 14-3-3beta is phosphorylation-dependent. Two novel 
motifs RSLS359VE and RVDS853EP in PTPH1 were identified as major 
14-3-3beta-binding sites, both of which are distinct from the consensus binding 
motif RSXSXP recently found in Raf-1. Mutation of Ser359 and Ser853 to alanine 
significantly reduced the association between 14-3-3beta and PTPH1. Furthermore, 
association of PTPH1 and 14-3-3beta was detected in several cell lines and was 
regulated in response to extracellular signals. These results raise the 
possibility that 14-3-3beta may function as an adaptor molecule in the 
regulation of PTPH1 and may provide a link between serine/threonine and tyrosine 
phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways.
