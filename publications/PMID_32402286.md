Centrosomes function in key cellular processes ranging from cell division to 
cellular signaling. Their dysfunction is linked to cancer and developmental 
disorders. Here, we identify CCDC57 as a pleiotropic regulator of centriole 
duplication, mitosis, and ciliogenesis. Combining proximity mapping with 
superresolution imaging, we show that CCDC57 localizes to the proximal end of 
centrioles and interacts with the microcephaly protein CEP63, centriolar 
satellite proteins, and microtubules. Loss of CCDC57 causes defects in centriole 
duplication and results in a failure to localize CEP63 and CEP152 to the 
centrosome. Additionally, CCDC57 depletion perturbs mitotic progression both in 
wild-type and centriole-less cells. Importantly, its centrosome-targeting region 
is required for its interaction with CEP63 and functions during centriole 
duplication and cilium assembly, whereas the microtubule-targeting region is 
required for its mitotic functions. Together, our results identify CCDC57 as a 
critical interface between centrosome and microtubule-mediated cellular 
processes that are deregulated in microcephaly.
