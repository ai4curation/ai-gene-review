We have determined the human genome to contain 296 different Src homology-3 
(SH3) domains and cloned them into a phage-display vector. This provided a 
powerful and unbiased system for simultaneous assaying of the complete human SH3 
proteome for the strongest binding to target proteins of interest, without the 
limitations posed by short linear peptide ligands or confounding variables of 
more indirect methods for protein interaction screening. Studies involving three 
ligand proteins, human immunodeficiency virus-1 Nef, p21-activated kinase (PAK)2 
and ADAM15, showed previously reported as well as novel SH3 partners with 
nanomolar affinities specific for them. This argues that SH3 domains may have a 
more dominant role in directing cellular protein interactions than has been 
assumed. Besides showing potentially important new SH3-directed interactions, 
these studies also led to the discovery of novel signalling proteins, such as 
the PAK2-binding adaptor protein POSH2 and the ADAM15-binding sorting nexin 
family member SNX30.
