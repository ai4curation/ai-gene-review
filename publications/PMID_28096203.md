BACKGROUND: Functional status is a key patient-centric outcome, but there are 
little data on whether functional recovery post-stroke varies among hospitals. 
This study examined the distribution of functional status 3 months after stroke, 
determined whether these outcomes vary among hospitals, and identified hospital 
characteristics associated with better (or worse) functional outcomes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Observational analysis of the AVAIL study (Adherence 
Evaluation After Ischemic Stroke-Longitudinal) included 2083 ischemic stroke 
patients enrolled from 82 US hospitals participating in Get With The 
Guidelines-Stroke and AVAIL. The primary outcome was dependence or death at 3 
months (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 3-6). Secondary outcomes included 
functional dependence (mRS score of 3-5), disabled (mRS score of 2-5), and mRS 
evaluated as a continuous score. By 3 months post-discharge, 36.5% of patients 
were functionally dependent or dead. Rates of dependence or death varied widely 
by discharging hospitals (range: 0%-67%). After risk adjustment, patients had 
lower rates of 3-month dependence or death when treated at teaching hospitals 
(odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.96) and certified primary 
stroke centers (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.91). In 
contrast, a composite measure of hospital-level adherence to acute stroke care 
performance metrics, stroke volume, and bed size was not associated with 
downstream patient functional status. Findings were robust across mRS end points 
and sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: One third of acute ischemic stroke patients were functionally 
dependent or dead 3 months postacute stroke; functional recovery rates varied 
considerably among hospitals, supporting the need to better determine which care 
processes can maximize functional outcomes.
