In response to DNA damage, cells need robust repair mechanisms to complete the 
cell cycle successfully. Severe forms of DNA damage are repaired by homologous 
recombination (HR), in which the XRCC2 protein plays a vital role. Cells 
deficient in XRCC2 also show disruption of the centrosome, a key component of 
the mitotic apparatus. We find that this centrosome disruption is dynamic and 
when it occurs during mitosis it is linked directly to the onset of mitotic 
catastrophe in a significant fraction of the XRCC2-deficient cells. However, we 
also show for the first time that XRCC2 and other HR proteins, including the key 
recombinase RAD51, co-localize with the centrosome. Co-localization is 
maintained throughout the cell cycle, except when cells are finishing mitosis 
when RAD51 accumulates in the midbody between the separating cells. Taken 
together, these data suggest a tight functional linkage between the centrosome 
and HR proteins, potentially to coordinate the deployment of a DNA damage 
response at vulnerable phases of the cell cycle.
