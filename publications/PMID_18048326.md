Isothiocyanates and phenolic antioxidants can prevent cancer through activation 
of Nrf2 (NF-E2 p45-related factor 2), a transcription factor that controls 
expression of cytoprotective genes through the antioxidant response element 
(ARE) enhancer. Using a human mammary MCF7-derived AREc32 reporter cell line, we 
now report that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and other retinoic acid receptor 
alpha (RARalpha) agonists, markedly reduces the ability of Nrf2 to mediate 
induction of ARE-driven genes by cancer chemopreventive agents including the 
metabolite of butylated hydroxyanisole, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ). The basal 
and tBHQ-inducible expression of aldo-keto reductase (AKR) AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 
genes, which are regulated by Nrf2, was also repressed by ATRA in AREc32 cells. 
Antagonists of RARalpha augmented induction of ARE-driven gene expression by 
tBHQ, as did knockdown of RARalpha by using RNAi. The expression of the ARE-gene 
battery was increased in the small intestine of mice fed on a vitamin 
A-deficient diet, and this increase was repressed by administration of ATRA. By 
contrast, in the small intestine of Nrf2 null mice, the expression of ARE-driven 
genes was not affected by vitamin A status. In MCF7 cells, ATRA did not block 
the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 but reduced the binding of Nrf2 to the ARE 
enhancer as a consequence of forming a complex with RARalpha. These data suggest 
that cross-talk between Nrf2 and RARalpha could markedly influence the 
sensitivity of cells to electrophiles and oxidative stressors and, as a 
consequence, to carcinogenesis.
