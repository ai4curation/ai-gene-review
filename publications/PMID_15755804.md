Many aspects of the genetic control of mammalian embryogenesis cannot be 
extrapolated from other animals. Taking a forward genetic approach, we have 
induced recessive mutations by treatment of mice with ethylnitrosourea and have 
identified 43 mutations that affect early morphogenesis and patterning, 
including 38 genes that have not been studied previously. The molecular lesions 
responsible for 14 mutations were identified, including mutations in nine genes 
that had not been characterized previously. Some mutations affect 
vertebrate-specific components of conserved signaling pathways; for example, at 
least five mutations affect previously uncharacterized regulators of the Sonic 
hedgehog (Shh) pathway. Approximately half of all of the mutations affect the 
initial establishment of the body plan, and several of these produce phenotypes 
that have not been described previously. A large fraction of the genes 
identified affect cell migration, cellular organization, and cell structure. The 
findings indicate that phenotype-based genetic screens provide a direct and 
unbiased method to identify essential regulators of mammalian development.
