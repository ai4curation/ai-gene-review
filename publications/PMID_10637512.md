Simian Virus 40 Large T-antigen expressed in NIH3T3 cells increases p53 level
and interacts with this tumor suppressor to form large nuclear complexes. We
show here that T-antigen sensitizes NIH3T3 cells to low doses of the oxidative
stress inducer menadione. This oxidant increased p53 accumulation and disrupted
p53/T-antigen interaction, but not T-antigen/pRb, T-antigen/Hsc70 and p53/Hsc70
complexes; a phenomenon inhibited by the anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cysteine.
Analysis of several p53 downstream gene products revealed that the level of Fas
receptor, which was sharply reduced by T-antigen expression, was drastically
increased in response to menadione treatment. Menadione also induced a T-antigen
dependent cleavage of Fas ligand. Analysis performed with Fas receptor
antagonist antibody and metalloproteinases inhibitor revealed that menadione
triggers a Fas-dependent death of a fraction of T-antigen expressing cells. This
Fas pathway does not activate caspase 8 or 3, probably because of the inhibition
induced by T-antigen, and leads to a necrotic cell death which contributes at
least in part to the hypersensitivity of T-antigen transformed cells to
oxidative stress.
