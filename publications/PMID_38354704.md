The interaction of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family member CD27 
on naive CD8+ T (Tn) cells with homotrimeric CD70 on antigen-presenting cells 
(APCs) is necessary for T cell memory fate determination. Here, we examined CD27 
signaling during Tn cell activation and differentiation. In conjunction with 
T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, ligation of CD27 by a synthetic trimeric CD70 
ligand triggered CD27 internalization and degradation, suggesting active 
regulation of this signaling axis. Internalized CD27 recruited the signaling 
adaptor TRAF2 and the phosphatase SHP-1, thereby modulating TCR and CD28 
signals. CD27-mediated modulation of TCR signals promoted transcription factor 
circuits that induced memory rather than effector associated gene programs, 
which are induced by CD28 costimulation. CD27-costimulated chimeric antigen 
receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells exhibited improved tumor control compared with 
CD28-costimulated CAR-T cells. Thus, CD27 signaling during Tn cell activation 
promotes memory properties with relevance to T cell immunotherapy.
