The phosphorylation of the serine 10 at histone H3 has been shown to be 
important for transcriptional activation. Here, we report the molecular 
mechanism through which H3S10ph triggers transcript elongation of the FOSL1 
gene. Serum stimulation induces the PIM1 kinase to phosphorylate the 
preacetylated histone H3 at the FOSL1 enhancer. The adaptor protein 14-3-3 binds 
the phosphorylated nucleosome and recruits the histone acetyltransferase MOF, 
which triggers the acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac). This 
histone crosstalk generates the nucleosomal recognition code composed of 
H3K9acS10ph/H4K16ac determining a nucleosome platform for the bromodomain 
protein BRD4 binding. The recruitment of the positive transcription elongation 
factor b (P-TEFb) via BRD4 induces the release of the promoter-proximal paused 
RNA polymerase II and the increase of its processivity. Thus, the single 
phosphorylation H3S10ph at the FOSL1 enhancer triggers a cascade of events which 
activate transcriptional elongation.
