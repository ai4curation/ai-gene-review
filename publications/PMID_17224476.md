BACKGROUND: Cardiac ion channelopathies are responsible for an ever-increasing 
number and diversity of familial cardiac arrhythmia syndromes. We describe a new 
clinical entity that consists of an ST-segment elevation in the right precordial 
ECG leads, a shorter-than-normal QT interval, and a history of sudden cardiac 
death.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-two consecutive probands with Brugada syndrome were 
screened for ion channel gene mutations with direct sequencing. Site-directed 
mutagenesis was performed, and CHO-K1 cells were cotransfected with cDNAs 
encoding wild-type or mutant CACNB2b (Ca(v beta2b)), CACNA2D1 (Ca(v 
alpha2delta1)), and CACNA1C tagged with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein 
(Ca(v)1.2). Whole-cell patch-clamp studies were performed after 48 to 72 hours. 
Three probands displaying ST-segment elevation and corrected QT intervals < or = 
360 ms had mutations in genes encoding the cardiac L-type calcium channel. 
Corrected QT ranged from 330 to 370 ms among probands and clinically affected 
family members. Rate adaptation of QT interval was reduced. Quinidine normalized 
the QT interval and prevented stimulation-induced ventricular tachycardia. 
Genetic and heterologous expression studies revealed loss-of-function missense 
mutations in CACNA1C (A39V and G490R) and CACNB2 (S481L) encoding the alpha1- 
and beta2b-subunits of the L-type calcium channel. Confocal microscopy revealed 
a defect in trafficking of A39V Ca(v)1.2 channels but normal trafficking of 
channels containing G490R Ca(v)1.2 or S481L Ca(v beta2b)-subunits.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of loss-of-function mutations in genes 
encoding the cardiac L-type calcium channel to be associated with a familial 
sudden cardiac death syndrome in which a Brugada syndrome phenotype is combined 
with shorter-than-normal QT intervals.
