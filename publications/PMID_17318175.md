The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is critical in both cellular 
proliferation and organismal development. However, how the beta-catenin 
degradation complex is inhibited upon Wnt activation remains unclear. Using a 
directed RNAi screen we find that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a ubiquitous 
serine/threonine phosphatase, is a novel potent positive physiologic regulator 
of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. PP1 expression synergistically 
activates, and inhibition of PP1 inhibits, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in 
Drosophila and mammalian cells as well as in Xenopus embryos. The data suggest 
that PP1 controls Wnt signaling through interaction with, and regulated 
dephosphorylation of, axin. Inhibition of PP1 leads to enhanced phosphorylation 
of specific sites on axin by casein kinase I. Axin phosphorylation markedly 
enhances the binding of glycogen synthase kinase 3, leading to a more active 
beta-catenin destruction complex. Wnt-regulated changes in axin phosphorylation, 
mediated by PP1, may therefore determine beta-catenin transcriptional activity. 
Specific inhibition of PP1 in this pathway may offer therapeutic approaches to 
disorders with increased beta-catenin signaling.
