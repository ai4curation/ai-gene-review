Copper,zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) in mammals is activated principally via 
a copper chaperone (CCS) and to a lesser degree by a CCS-independent pathway of 
unknown nature. In this study, we have characterized the requirement for CCS in 
activating SOD1 from Drosophila. A CCS-null mutant (Ccs(n)(29)(E)) of Drosophila 
was created and found to phenotypically resemble Drosophila SOD1-null mutants in 
terms of reduced adult life span, hypersensitivity to oxidative stress, and loss 
of cytosolic aconitase activity. However, the phenotypes of CCS-null flies were 
less severe, consistent with some CCS-independent activation of Drosophila SOD1 
(dSOD1). Yet SOD1 activity was not detectable in Ccs(n)(29)(E) flies, due 
largely to a striking loss of SOD1 protein. In contrast, human SOD1 expressed in 
CCS-null flies is robustly active and rescues the deficits in adult life span 
and sensitivity to oxidative stress. The dependence of dSOD1 on CCS was also 
observed in a yeast expression system where the dSOD1 polypeptide exhibited 
unusual instability in CCS-null (ccs1Delta) yeast. The residual dSOD1 
polypeptide in ccs1Delta yeast was nevertheless active, consistent with 
CCS-independent activation. Stability of dSOD1 in ccs1Delta cells was readily 
restored by expression of either yeast or Drosophila CCS, and this required 
copper insertion into the enzyme. The yeast expression system also revealed some 
species specificity for CCS. Yeast SOD1 exhibits preference for yeast CCS over 
Drosophila CCS, whereas dSOD1 is fully activated with either CCS molecule. Such 
variation in mechanisms of copper activation of SOD1 could reflect evolutionary 
responses to unique oxygen and/or copper environments faced by divergent 
species.

 by cytosolic superoxide dismutase
 (SOD1)3 is dependent
 upon the cyclic reduction and oxidation of the prosthetic transition metal,
 copper. The cell must strictly limit concentrations of free copper, while
 simultaneously ensuring efficient delivery of copper to the SOD1 apoprotein.
 Copper is inserted into the SOD1 apoprotein by a specific chaperone, the
 copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS). Initially
 identified in yeast as the protein product of the LYS7 gene
 (1), CCS molecules have been
 identified from a wide range of organisms ranging from fungi to various
 metazoans (2).

CCS is composed of three separate protein domains that function in concert
 to activate SOD1 with copper (see Fig.
 1B). At the N terminus of CCS, domain I resembles the
 ATX1 family of copper chaperones that harbor the well conserved CXXC
 Cu(I)-binding motif. The central domain II of CCS has significant homology to
 SOD1 and is important for forming a CCS-SOD1 heterodimer-docked complex as a
 prerequisite to copper transfer. Finally the C-terminal domain III contains a
 critical CXC copper-binding site that inserts copper and oxidizes the
 intramolecular disulfide in SOD1
 (3,
 4). In many models domain I and
 domain III cysteines together coordinate a copper ion
 (5,
 6), although the role of domain
 I cysteines in SOD1 activation in vivo is uncertain.

In addition to CCS, SOD1 can be activated by a so-called CCS-independent
 pathway that is currently of unknown nature but requires reduced GSH
 (7). The mode of copper
 activation (CCS versus CCS-independent) can vary among different
 organisms. For example, the SOD1 of bakers' yeast Saccharomyces
 cerevisiae is totally dependent on CCS for activation, whereas that of
 the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans only acquires copper through the
 CCS-independent pathway (8). In
 fact, C. elegans lacks an obvious CCS-encoding gene. Mammals express
 a CCS that is homologous to that of yeast, but mammalian SOD1 can acquire
 copper by either pathway (7,
 9). CCS-encoding genes have
 been identified in a wide array of metazoans, yet the biology of CCS from
 nonmammalian metazoans has not been investigated.

The invertebrate, Drosophila melanogaster, has provided an ideal
 organism in which to explore the role of SOD1 in development, survival, and
 aging. Mutant Drosophila lacking SOD1 survive well as embryos and
 larvae but experience high rates of mortality as late pupae and early adults.
 Surviving adults exhibit a median life span about 10% of normal, severely
 reduced fertility, hypersensitivity to a variety of oxidative stress
 conditions (10), retinal
 degeneration (11), and
 increased rates of spontaneous somatic and germ line mutation
 (12). The high rate of early
 mortality in SOD1-null mutants is related to a general pattern of premature
 aging as reflected by the precocious onset and rapid progression of patterns
 of marker gene expression that typify normal senescence
 (13). Clearly, SOD1 plays a
 critical role in the biology and life history of Drosophila, but the
 biochemistry of the maturation process for this critical enzyme has not been
 explored. Here we describe a single CCS-encoding gene from Drosophila
 and the biological and biochemical consequences of losing the copper chaperone
 for SOD1.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDrosophila Stocks, Culture Conditions—The
 Sod1n108 and ry+5 strains
 are described in Ref, 10.
 hSOD1 was expressed using lines carrying UAS-hSod1 and the GAL4 driver line,
 daGAL4G32 as described
 (14). Stocks were maintained
 at 25 °C on standard cornmeal and agar medium unless otherwise stated.The copper chaperone coding region was amplified by PCR (primers CCS5 +
 CCS7) using DNA extracted from a Drosophila Canton S adult cDNA
 library (Stratagene catalog number 936603). The 930-bp PCR product was
 blunt-ended and subcloned into the SmaI site of pBluescriptIISK (Stratagene)
 to generate the vector pBCC. The transformation vector pUCC was constructed by
 subcloning the EcoRI-NotI fragment of pBCC into pUAST
 (15).Yeast Strains, Growth Conditions, Plasmids—Yeast strains
 used in this study were derived from EG103 (MATα,
 leu2-3,112, his3Δ1, trp1-289, ura3-52)
 (16) and include KS107
 (sod1Δ) (17)
 and LS101 (sod1Δ ccs1Δ)
 (18). Cells were propagated at
 30 °C either in enriched yeast extract, peptone-based medium supplemented
 with 2% glucose (YPD), or in synthetic complete (SC) medium
 (19). Solid medium was
 supplemented with 15 mg/liter ergosterol and 0.5% Tween 80 to enhance growth
 in anaerobic conditions.Yeast expression plasmids for dSOD1 and dCCS were produced using cDNA clone
 RE52090 (Open Biosystems) for dSOD1 and plasmid pUCC for dCCS. The coding
 sequences for dSOD1 and dCCS were PCR0-amplified introducing 5′ BglII
 and 3′ SnaBI sites in dSOD1 and 5′ MluI and 3′ RsrII sites
 in dCCS. The dSOD1 PCR product was digested with the appropriate enzymes and
 ligated into pLS108 (18) cut
 with BglII/SnaBI, replacing the yeast SOD1 coding sequence with that of dSOD1
 resulting in plasmid pLJ373. The digested dCCS PCR product was inserted into
 pLJ366 (a derivative of pLS113
 (18) with an MluI site just
 prior to the yCCS1 start codon and an RsrII site immediately after the stop
 codon), replacing the yCCS1 coding sequence with that of dCCS, generating
 plasmid pLJ375. Both dSOD1 and dCCS were under control of their corresponding
 S. cerevisiae regulatory sequences. The sequence integrity of these
 plasmids was ensured by double-stranded DNA sequencing (DNA Analysis Facility,
 The Johns Hopkins University). Yeast CCS1 plasmids pHAL-413, pLS008 (C229S,
 C231S), and pLS010 (K136E, G137E) have been described previously
 (18). Domain I mutation in
 yCCS1 (C17S, C20S) was introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit
 (Stratagene) using pHAL-413 as a template
 (4) resulting in plasmid
 pPS031.SOD1 In-gel Activity Assay—To analyze SOD1 activity from
 Drosophila, five males were homogenized in 50 μl of 1% Triton
 X-100. 10 μl of supernatant was transferred to a tube containing an equal
 volume of loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol,
 0.01% bromphenol blue). 20 μl was run on a 10% polyacrylamide (4% stacking)
 gel. The gel was incubated in nitro blue tetrazolium (2 mg/ml) for 5 min
 followed by incubation in 36 mm K2HPO4, 0.035
 mm riboflavin, 0.3% TEMED for 7 min and then washed several times
 in H2O as described
 (20).SOD enzymatic activity was assayed from yeast grown shaking in selected SC
 medium to an A600 of 1.5. Yeast lysates were generated by
 glass bead homogenization in a buffer containing 0.6 m sorbitol, 10
 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and protease inhibitors. Analysis of SOD activity
 by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis using 12% pre-cast gel (Invitrogen) and
 staining with nitro blue tetrazolium was performed as described previously
 (21) except that 10
 mm EDTA was added to the native running buffer.SOD1 Spectrophotometric Assay—24–48-h-old males were
 homogenized in B1 (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1
 mm EDTA). The supernatant was extracted twice with chloroform (0.15
 V), ethanol (0.25 V) with a 15-min incubation time for each extraction. SOD1
 activity was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the autooxidation
 of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-HD) at 490 nm at 37 °C in 500 μl of B1
 containing 0.1 mm 6-HD
 (22). Protein concentration
 was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay.Aconitase Activity Assay—30 adult males were homogenized in
 120 μl of extraction buffer (0.6 mm MnCl2, 2
 mm citric acid, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and centrifuged
 at 13,000 × g. Samples were electrophoresed on Sepraphore III
 membranes (Pall Corp.). Aconitase was detected by incubation of the membrane
 in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 1 mm NADPH, 2
 mm cis-aconitic acid, 1.2 mm
 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 0.3
 mm phenazine methosulfate, 25 mm MgCl2, and 5
 units/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase
 (23,
 24).Western Blotting—For analysis of SOD1 from
 Drosophila, males were homogenized in 1% Triton X-100. The extracts
 were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the
 supernatant was transferred to a tube containing an equal volume of loading
 buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 4% SDS, 10% mercaptoethanol, 20%
 glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Samples were boiled for 5 min, and 10 μg
 of total protein was separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4% stacking, 15%
 separating). The protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (ECL) and
 probed with sheep anti-human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Cedarlane catalog
 number K9007C) and rabbit anti-sheep IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate
 (Chemicon catalog number AP147P). The ECL Western blotting detection reagents
 (RPN 2109, Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection.Immunoblot analysis of Cu,Zn-SOD expressed in yeast was carried out with
 cell lysates prepared as described above and a polyclonal antibody that
 displays strong reactivity with Cu,Zn-SODs from several species (JH765) at a
 1:5000 dilution (8). Detection
 utilized an Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen),
 and immunoblots were visualized using the Odyssey infrared imagining system
 (Licor Biosciences).FIGURE 1.Drosophila CCS. A, genomic architecture of

 cytogenetic region 46F1 of D. melanogaster chromosome 2. H340 is the
 Ccs+ parent chromosome. 29E is the mutant chromosome
 containing a 1907-bp deletion extending upstream from bp 124 of the 2nd exon
 through the first intron, the first exon and 1717 bp of the 5′-noncoding
 region. The precise details of the origin of 29E from H340 are unknown.

 Flies were transferred to fresh food every 2–3 days.Drosophila Paraquat Resistance—0–24-h-old males were
 collected and kept on cornmeal food for 24 h, 10 males in each vial. They were
 then transferred to vials containing 3-mm paper filter disks saturated with
 250 μl of 1% sucrose, 1% sucrose containing 2 mm paraquat
 (Sigma) or 1% sucrose and 5 mm paraquat. The vials were stored at
 25 °C in the dark, and flies were enumerated after 24 h as originally
 described (10).

RESULTSdCcs, the Copper Chaperone of SOD1 Gene of Drosophila—The
 Drosophila genomic homologue of yeast and mammalian Ccs was
 initially identified by isolation of a SOD1-like sequence from a
 Drosophila genomic library, later verified by sequence annotation in
 Flybase (CG17753, FBgn0010531, and confirmed by amplification of a
 Ccs cDNA from a D. melanogaster cDNA library
 (Fig. 1A). The
 architecture of the native Drosophila gene includes a 795-bp coding
 sequence interrupted by two small introns of 51 and 61 bp, respectively. The
 nearest open reading frame (CG11867) is ∼5 kb upstream from the
 5′-transcription start site. The encoded sequence contains the expected
 region of high homology to SOD1
 (2) in the central domain II of
 CCS; the domain III CXC is conserved. Unexpectedly, the domain I
 CXXC copper-binding motif is absent
 (Fig. 1B). A
 comparison to all known CCS-like molecules in the data base revealed that the
 absence of a CXXC motif in Drosophila CCS is unique. Of 20
 CCS sequences analyzed from fungi to humans, only D. melanogaster and
 Anopheles gambiae lack the MXCXXC copper-binding
 site (Table 1). However, all 20
 CCS molecules retain the CXC copper site in domain III.TABLE 1Drosophila CCS lacks domain 1 MTCXXCThe presence of the domain I MXCXXC and domain III
 CXC sequences was examined in CCS proteins from fungi, plants, and
 animals. Sequences were obtained from the GenBank™ database. Alignments
 were performed with Geneious (version 3.0.6).Ccs Deletion Mutation—A loss of function mutation of
 Ccs (Ccsn29E),
 generated by an apparent imprecise excision of a P element located near
 Ccs in the autosomal enhancer-detector parent strain, H340
 (25), was identified by
 recovery of a strain, 29E, with reduced SOD1 activity and a set of phenotypes
 exhibited by known SOD1 deficiency mutants (see below). Sequence analysis of
 Ccs, restriction analysis by Southern hybridization, and SOD1
 activity all indicated that Ccs is functionally and structurally
 intact in H340. The genomic deletion in
 Ccsn29E includes 1617 bp of
 5′-upstream region and 1907 bp downstream from the transcription start
 site, including all of the first exon, the first intron, and 124 bp of the
 second exon (Fig. 1A).
 Ccs transcripts are relatively rare throughout normal development in
 H340 and are undetectable by Northern blot analysis in 29E (data not
 shown).Loss of SOD1 Enzymatic Activity in CCS-null Flies—Because
 the only known assay for CCS function is via its role in the activation of
 SOD1, we assayed SOD1 activity in extracts of H340 and 29E using two
 functionally different methods, the in-gel with nitro blue tetrazolium
 reduction interference assay and the spectrophotometric 6-hydroxydopamine
 reduction interference assay (Fig. 2,
 A and B). Using both methods, we were unable to
 detect significant SOD1 activity in 29E. Loss of CCS in 29E appears to have no
 effect on the activity of the mitochondrial manganese-containing SOD2 (see
 Fig. 4A). These
 results by themselves would suggest that CCS in Drosophila, as in
 yeast and mammals, is specifically required for activating SOD1.However, analysis of SOD1 protein levels revealed that the steady state
 level of SOD1 polypeptide in 29E is reduced to about one-quarter of its normal
 level in H340 (Fig.
 2C). Thus, the loss of SOD1 activity in 29E probably
 arises primarily from the reduced level of SOD1 protein in the absence of CCS.
 Further analysis confirmed that the lack of SOD1 activity in 29E is not
 because of a mutation in the Sod1
 gene.4Deficiency of CCS Reduces the Functional Level of Specific Iron-Sulfur
 Protein Sentinels—The cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitases both
 contain cubane [4Fe-4S] centers that are sensitive targets of inactivation by
 superoxide (23,
 26). Steady state levels of
 these activities in Drosophila are significantly reduced in the
 absence of SOD1 and SOD2, respectively
 (24). Assay of cACON and mACON
 activities in 29E shows that cACON activity is selectively depleted by about
 50% (H340 ∼1.6 × 29E), with no detectable affect on the activity of
 mACON (Fig. 2D). Taken
 together, these data indicate that at the biochemical level, the absence of
 dCCS is equivalent to a deficiency in SOD1. The important question then
 arises, does this parallel extend to whole organism phenotypes?Genetic Ablation of CCS Elicits Broad Phenotypic
 Consequences—At a minimum, the mutational loss of CCS should
 generate a set of phenotypes predicted by the loss of SOD1, including reduced
 adult life span with little or no overt effect on pre-adult development and
 hypersensitivity to applied oxidative stress. Both of these expected
 phenotypes are realized. Fig.
 3A shows that the absence of CCS confers early onset
 adult mortality with an ∼30% reduction in the median adult life span. In
 contrast, 29E displays the extreme toxic hypersensitivity to the redox cycling
 agent, paraquat, exhibited by SOD1-null
 (Fig. 3B). In these
 respects, 29E appears to phenocopy a weakly expressing SOD1 hypomorphic
 mutant. Based on previous studies with RNA interference-mediated knockdown of
 SOD1 (27), and transgenic
 rescue of SOD1-null mutants
 (28), which show that paraquat
 toxicity is a more sensitive indicator of SOD1 deficiency than life span, the
 phenotype of 29E is consistent with the presence in 29E of a very small
 residual level of SOD1 activity which, although below the level of detection
 by conventional assays of whole-fly extracts, is sufficient to extend median
 adult life span (∼30 days) beyond the 10-day median life span of SOD1-null
 mutants. Such activity, if it were to occur, would have to arise via
 CCS-independent activation of apo-SOD1 (see below).Human SOD1 Is Active in CCS-null Drosophila and Restores Their Adult
 Life Span—In earlier work
 (14), we described the
 functional expression of human SOD1 (hSOD1) in Drosophila in a
 Ccs+ genetic background. Since then, the CCS-independent
 activation of hSOD1 has been described
 (7,
 9). Here we investigated the
 activation of hSOD1 in flies in the absence of functional dCCS. As would be
 expected from this SOD1 capable of CCS independent activation, hSOD1 is quite
 active in CCS-null flies (Fig.
 4A). Moreover, hSOD1 functions biologically to rescue the
 early mortality and reduced median life span of CCS-null flies
 (Fig. 4B). These
 results demonstrate the presence in Drosophila of a CCS-independent
 pathway capable of robust activation of heterologous hSOD1 while giving only
 weak activation of homologous dSOD1.CCS-independent Activation of Drosophila SOD1 Revealed in Yeast
 Expression System—Based on amino acid sequence alone, dSOD1 is
 predicted to acquire copper independently of CCS. Studies with yeast, human,
 and C. elegans SOD1 have identified a pair of prolines near the C
 terminus that can prohibit CCS-independent activation
 (7,
 8). Yeast SOD1 naturally
 contains these prolines and is incapable of CCS-independent activation,
 whereas mammalian and C. elegans SOD1 with nonproline residues at
 these positions can be activated independently of CCS. Drosophila
 SOD1 also lacks these prolines (Fig.
 5A) leading us to predict that dSOD1 should not exhibit
 dependence on CCS for activity. And although from the phenotype of dCCS-nulls
 we inferred the presence of a residual level of SOD1 activity, the instability
 of dSOD1 in the absence of CCS obscures any measurable CCS-independent
 activation of dSOD1 that might occur in the Drosophila model. We
 therefore turned to a yeast expression system to further examine
 Drosophila CCS and SOD1.FIGURE 2.Loss of CCS affects SOD1 and mAconitase. A, in-gel activity

 All strains are homozygous for Sod1+.To test the comparative functionality of dSOD1 in the absence of CCS, the
 coding sequences for human, yeast, and Drosophila SOD1 were all
 placed under control of the S. cerevisiae SOD1 gene promoter and
 analyzed for SOD1 activity and protein levels in
 CCS1+ versus ccs1Δ yeast. As in CCS-null
 flies (Fig. 2C), dSOD1
 appears highly unstable in ccs1Δ yeast
 (Fig. 5B), and dSOD1
 activity was initially difficult to discern
 (Fig. 5B, lane
 6). Yet when increasing levels of cell lysate were analyzed, the dSOD1
 polypeptide was readily detected, and CCS-independent activation of dSOD1
 became apparent (Fig.
 5B, lane 9), similar to levels seen with human
 SOD1 (lane 4). Hence, dSOD1 does have the capacity to be activated by
 the CCS-independent pathway, ostensibly explaining the less severe phenotypes
 of a CCS-null fly compared with a SOD1-null mutant.Role of CCS in Helping to Stabilize dSOD1—The dramatic loss
 of the dSOD1 polypeptide in both ccs1Δ null yeast
 (Fig. 5B) and in CCS
 null flies (Fig. 2C)
 is atypical, and it is not observed with yeast and human SOD1 analyzed in
 parallel (Fig. 5B,
 lanes 2 and 4). This loss in dSOD1 can be rescued by expressing
 either yeast CCS or Drosophila CCS in the ccs1Δ yeast
 (Fig. 6C, lanes
 8 and 9). This apparent stabilization of dSOD1 requires physical
 interactions between CCS and SOD1, as a K136E, G137E derivative of yeast CCS
 that cannot dock with SOD1
 (29) fails to increase dSOD1
 levels (Fig. 6A,
 lane 4). To test whether SOD1-CCS interactions are by themselves
 sufficient, we employed a C229S,C231S mutant of yeast CCS. The highly
 conserved cysteines Cys-229 and Cys-231 in domain III of CCS are needed for
 copper transfer and disulfide oxidation in SOD1, and a C229S,C231S mutant of
 CCS can dock with SOD1 but cannot activate the enzyme
 (29,
 30). As seen in
 Fig. 6A, lane
 3, C229S,C231S yCCS failed to stabilize dSOD1, indicating that copper
 transfer and/or disulfide oxidation are required. To directly test the
 requirement for copper, yeast cells were starved for copper by treatment with
 the Cu(I) chelator, bathocuproine sulfonate
 (31). Under such
 copper-limiting conditions, levels of the dSOD1 polypeptide were lowered even
 in cells expressing wild type CCS from yeast or Drosophila
 (Fig. 6B). Together,
 these studies indicate that apo-dSOD1 is unusually unstable and that CCS
 affords stability to dSOD1 by activating the enzyme through copper insertion
 and/or disulfide oxidation.Unique N Terminus of Drosophila CCS—As mentioned above,
 Drosophila CCS lacks the MXCXXC copper-binding
 motif that is well conserved in CCS molecules from phylogenetically distant
 taxa. In fact, an inspection of CCS molecules across diverse species reveals
 that with the exception of Drosophila and mosquito CCS, all CCS
 molecules identified to date harbor these cysteines
 (Table 1). Interestingly, we
 observed that Drosophila CCS is very poor at activating yeast SOD1
 compared with the homologous yeast CCS expressed from the identical yeast
 CCS1 gene promoter (Fig.
 6C, lanes 2 and 3). By comparison, fly
 CCS was nearly as effective as yeast CCS in activating human SOD1
 (Fig. 6C, lanes
 5 and 6), and Drosophila SOD1 exhibited no apparent
 preference for CCS and showed strong activation by both CCS molecules
 (lanes 8 and 9). To address whether the yeast SOD1
 preference for yeast CCS reflected loss of the conserved
 MXCXXC cysteines, we tested the effects of a C17S,C20S
 substitution in yeast CCS. As seen in Fig.
 6D, this mutant retains the ability to fully activate
 yeast SOD1. Despite the well conserved nature of domain I CXXCin CCS,
 these cysteines are not essential for activating SOD1. These results also
 demonstrate that the apparent poor reactivity between fly CCS and yeast SOD1
 is not simply explained by the absence of these CXXC cysteines. In
 any case, SOD1 molecules from phylogenetically distant organisms exhibit
 unique preferences in copper activation pathways.FIGURE 3.CCS deficiency confers early adult mortality and enhanced sensitivity to

dCcs, the Copper Chaperone of SOD1 Gene of Drosophila—The
 Drosophila genomic homologue of yeast and mammalian Ccs was
 initially identified by isolation of a SOD1-like sequence from a
 Drosophila genomic library, later verified by sequence annotation in
 Flybase (CG17753, FBgn0010531, and confirmed by amplification of a
 Ccs cDNA from a D. melanogaster cDNA library
 (Fig. 1A). The
 architecture of the native Drosophila gene includes a 795-bp coding
 sequence interrupted by two small introns of 51 and 61 bp, respectively. The
 nearest open reading frame (CG11867) is ∼5 kb upstream from the
 5′-transcription start site. The encoded sequence contains the expected
 region of high homology to SOD1
 (2) in the central domain II of
 CCS; the domain III CXC is conserved. Unexpectedly, the domain I
 CXXC copper-binding motif is absent
 (Fig. 1B). A
 comparison to all known CCS-like molecules in the data base revealed that the
 absence of a CXXC motif in Drosophila CCS is unique. Of 20
 CCS sequences analyzed from fungi to humans, only D. melanogaster and
 Anopheles gambiae lack the MXCXXC copper-binding
 site (Table 1). However, all 20
 CCS molecules retain the CXC copper site in domain III.

Ccs Deletion Mutation—A loss of function mutation of
 Ccs (Ccsn29E),
 generated by an apparent imprecise excision of a P element located near
 Ccs in the autosomal enhancer-detector parent strain, H340
 (25), was identified by
 recovery of a strain, 29E, with reduced SOD1 activity and a set of phenotypes
 exhibited by known SOD1 deficiency mutants (see below). Sequence analysis of
 Ccs, restriction analysis by Southern hybridization, and SOD1
 activity all indicated that Ccs is functionally and structurally
 intact in H340. The genomic deletion in
 Ccsn29E includes 1617 bp of
 5′-upstream region and 1907 bp downstream from the transcription start
 site, including all of the first exon, the first intron, and 124 bp of the
 second exon (Fig. 1A).
 Ccs transcripts are relatively rare throughout normal development in
 H340 and are undetectable by Northern blot analysis in 29E (data not
 shown).

Loss of SOD1 Enzymatic Activity in CCS-null Flies—Because
 the only known assay for CCS function is via its role in the activation of
 SOD1, we assayed SOD1 activity in extracts of H340 and 29E using two
 functionally different methods, the in-gel with nitro blue tetrazolium
 reduction interference assay and the spectrophotometric 6-hydroxydopamine
 reduction interference assay (Fig. 2,
 A and B). Using both methods, we were unable to
 detect significant SOD1 activity in 29E. Loss of CCS in 29E appears to have no
 effect on the activity of the mitochondrial manganese-containing SOD2 (see
 Fig. 4A). These
 results by themselves would suggest that CCS in Drosophila, as in
 yeast and mammals, is specifically required for activating SOD1.

However, analysis of SOD1 protein levels revealed that the steady state
 level of SOD1 polypeptide in 29E is reduced to about one-quarter of its normal
 level in H340 (Fig.
 2C). Thus, the loss of SOD1 activity in 29E probably
 arises primarily from the reduced level of SOD1 protein in the absence of CCS.
 Further analysis confirmed that the lack of SOD1 activity in 29E is not
 because of a mutation in the Sod1
 gene.4

Deficiency of CCS Reduces the Functional Level of Specific Iron-Sulfur
 Protein Sentinels—The cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitases both
 contain cubane [4Fe-4S] centers that are sensitive targets of inactivation by
 superoxide (23,
 26). Steady state levels of
 these activities in Drosophila are significantly reduced in the
 absence of SOD1 and SOD2, respectively
 (24). Assay of cACON and mACON
 activities in 29E shows that cACON activity is selectively depleted by about
 50% (H340 ∼1.6 × 29E), with no detectable affect on the activity of
 mACON (Fig. 2D). Taken
 together, these data indicate that at the biochemical level, the absence of
 dCCS is equivalent to a deficiency in SOD1. The important question then
 arises, does this parallel extend to whole organism phenotypes?

Genetic Ablation of CCS Elicits Broad Phenotypic
 Consequences—At a minimum, the mutational loss of CCS should
 generate a set of phenotypes predicted by the loss of SOD1, including reduced
 adult life span with little or no overt effect on pre-adult development and
 hypersensitivity to applied oxidative stress. Both of these expected
 phenotypes are realized. Fig.
 3A shows that the absence of CCS confers early onset
 adult mortality with an ∼30% reduction in the median adult life span. In
 contrast, 29E displays the extreme toxic hypersensitivity to the redox cycling
 agent, paraquat, exhibited by SOD1-null
 (Fig. 3B). In these
 respects, 29E appears to phenocopy a weakly expressing SOD1 hypomorphic
 mutant. Based on previous studies with RNA interference-mediated knockdown of
 SOD1 (27), and transgenic
 rescue of SOD1-null mutants
 (28), which show that paraquat
 toxicity is a more sensitive indicator of SOD1 deficiency than life span, the
 phenotype of 29E is consistent with the presence in 29E of a very small
 residual level of SOD1 activity which, although below the level of detection
 by conventional assays of whole-fly extracts, is sufficient to extend median
 adult life span (∼30 days) beyond the 10-day median life span of SOD1-null
 mutants. Such activity, if it were to occur, would have to arise via
 CCS-independent activation of apo-SOD1 (see below).

Human SOD1 Is Active in CCS-null Drosophila and Restores Their Adult
 Life Span—In earlier work
 (14), we described the
 functional expression of human SOD1 (hSOD1) in Drosophila in a
 Ccs+ genetic background. Since then, the CCS-independent
 activation of hSOD1 has been described
 (7,
 9). Here we investigated the
 activation of hSOD1 in flies in the absence of functional dCCS. As would be
 expected from this SOD1 capable of CCS independent activation, hSOD1 is quite
 active in CCS-null flies (Fig.
 4A). Moreover, hSOD1 functions biologically to rescue the
 early mortality and reduced median life span of CCS-null flies
 (Fig. 4B). These
 results demonstrate the presence in Drosophila of a CCS-independent
 pathway capable of robust activation of heterologous hSOD1 while giving only
 weak activation of homologous dSOD1.

CCS-independent Activation of Drosophila SOD1 Revealed in Yeast
 Expression System—Based on amino acid sequence alone, dSOD1 is
 predicted to acquire copper independently of CCS. Studies with yeast, human,
 and C. elegans SOD1 have identified a pair of prolines near the C
 terminus that can prohibit CCS-independent activation
 (7,
 8). Yeast SOD1 naturally
 contains these prolines and is incapable of CCS-independent activation,
 whereas mammalian and C. elegans SOD1 with nonproline residues at
 these positions can be activated independently of CCS. Drosophila
 SOD1 also lacks these prolines (Fig.
 5A) leading us to predict that dSOD1 should not exhibit
 dependence on CCS for activity. And although from the phenotype of dCCS-nulls
 we inferred the presence of a residual level of SOD1 activity, the instability
 of dSOD1 in the absence of CCS obscures any measurable CCS-independent
 activation of dSOD1 that might occur in the Drosophila model. We
 therefore turned to a yeast expression system to further examine
 Drosophila CCS and SOD1.

 coding sequences for human, yeast, and Drosophila SOD1 were all
 placed under control of the S. cerevisiae SOD1 gene promoter and
 analyzed for SOD1 activity and protein levels in

 of the dSOD1 polypeptide in both ccs1Δ null yeast
 (Fig. 5B) and in CCS
 null flies (Fig. 2C)
 is atypical, and it is not observed with yeast and human SOD1 analyzed in
 parallel (Fig. 5B,
 lanes 2 and 4). This loss in dSOD1 can be rescued by expressing
 either yeast CCS or Drosophila CCS in the ccs1Δ yeast
 (Fig. 6C, lanes
 8 and 9). This apparent stabilization of dSOD1 requires physical
 interactions between CCS and SOD1, as a K136E, G137E derivative of yeast CCS

 (29) fails to increase dSOD1
 levels (Fig. 6A,

 unique preferences in copper activation pathways.

DISCUSSIONCCS in Drosophila is encoded by a single genomic gene,
 Ccs. Mutational inactivation of Ccs generates a set of
 phenotypes that are equivalent to those from a weakly expressing SOD1
 hypomorphic mutation, and are consistent with the notion that CCS appears to
 have a single function in Drosophila, which is to mediate the
 activation of apo-SOD1 by copper. Compared with the severity of phenotypes
 caused by SOD1 deficiency (either genomic null mutation or RNA interference
 knockdown), the CCS-null phenotypes are unexpectedly mild. This likely arises
 from a vanishingly small amount of CCS-independent SOD1 activity that is at or
 just below the threshold of detectability in fly extracts and could only be
 discerned in concentrated lysates from yeast cells expressing dSOD1.
 Considering the rather severe phenotype of SOD1-null flies with respect to
 adult life span and oxidative stress resistance
 (10), these findings suggest
 that only a very small fraction of wild type SOD1 is actually required for
 adult viability in the absence of oxidative stress, whereas the bulk of SOD1
 is utilized in defense against oxidative stress. This view is supported by the
 contrasting modest and severe effects of CCS deficiency on life span and
 paraquat resistance, respectively. Thus, the age of onset and severity of
 early adult mortality in CCS-nulls is markedly less than in SOD1-nulls,
 whereas the hypersensitivity of CCS-nulls to paraquat is essentially
 equivalent to that of SOD1-nulls.FIGURE 5.Expression of Drosophila SOD1 (dSOD1) in yeast. A,

 cerevisiae, human, and Drosophila, highlighting the proline

 placed under control of the S. cerevisiae SOD1 gene promoter and used
 to transform a yeast strain that was sod1Δ and either

 SOD1 lysates were analyzed for SOD1 activity (top) or SOD1 protein
 levels using an antibody directed against C. elegans Cu,Zn-SOD1 that
 cross-reacts well with diverse SOD1 molecules
 (6). Amounts of lysate protein
 analyzed are as follows: lanes 1–6,5 μg; lane 7,10
 μg; lane 8,25 μg; lane 9,50 μg. Strains analyzed
 include KS107 (sod1Δ) and LS101 (sod1Δ
 ccs1Δ).FIGURE 6.Role of copper and CCS in stabilizing the dSOD1 expressed in yeast.

 designated SOD1 and CCS molecules was analyzed for SOD1 activity and SOD1
 polypeptide levels using 10 μg of cell lysate protein for each sample.

 indicated mutant versions of S. cerevisiae CCS1 or empty vector were

 quantitation software (version 1.2) where 100 = amount of dSOD1 polypeptide

 and either S. cerevisiae CCS1 or Drosophila CCS driven by
 the S. cerevisiae CCS1 promoter were grown in the presence of 100
 μm bathocuproine sulfonate where indicated (+), and dSOD1
 polypeptide levels measured as in A where 100 = amount of dSOD1
 polypeptide with no addition of bathocuproine sulfonate. C, cells
 expressing either yeast, human, or Drosophila SOD1 in combination
 with either yeast or Drosophila CCS or with vector as indicated were
 analyzed for SOD1 activity and SOD1 protein levels as
 Fig. 5B. D,
 cells expressing yeast SOD1 and either wild type or the indicated mutant
 versions of S. cerevisiae CCS1 were analyzed for SOD1 activity and
 protein levels as in Fig.
 5B.It is also possible that the residual SOD1 activity in CCS-nulls reflects
 the presence of enzymatically active SOD1 in just one or a small number of
 cell types in which the CCS-independent activation pathway is particularly
 active. Although we know of no direct evidence in support of this possibility,
 the ectopic expression of the CCS-independent hSOD1 in motor neurons, which
 confers robust rescue of the SOD1-null adult life span
 (14), suggests that motor
 neurons do possess an active CCS-independent activation pathway; consequently,
 motor neurons could potentially be one such cell type that could activate
 dSOD1 in the absence of CCS. Because Drosophila life span is
 sensitive to SOD1 activity in motor neurons, the functioning of the
 CCS-independent activation pathway in motor neurons could also help explain
 why CCS deficiency has such a modest effect on adult life span relative to the
 severe life span reduction conferred by SOD1 deficiency. Alternatively, and as
 discussed later, our results are consistent with the possibility that although
 most cells can survive under normal conditions with little SOD1, some cells
 may require more than the residual level of SOD1 activity present in CCS-nulls
 under conditions of applied oxidative stress (paraquat) or increased metabolic
 activity (motor neurons). Finally, it is also plausible that cell type
 variation in copper availability could, in principle, underpin such cell type
 specificity in CCS-independent activation of SOD1.Drosophila SOD1 can now be added to the growing list of SOD1
 molecules that can obtain copper independently of CCS. Currently, the only
 Cu,Zn-SOD known to solely rely on CCS is the SOD1 of S. cerevisiae.
 It is curious that yeast does not need a CCS independent pathway, yet retains
 the ability to activate heterologous SODs independent of CCS. A likely
 explanation is that the factors for CCS independent activation serve another
 function in the cell. For example, CCS independent activation may involve
 metal binding or thiol-reactive molecules that participate in more general
 metal homeostasis and/or redox control.Drosophila SOD1 appears unique in that the apo-form is very
 unstable in the absence of the copper chaperone. The apparent instability is
 not because of the Drosophila host, as human SOD1 expressed in
 CCS-null flies shows no polypeptide loss, and in the heterologous yeast
 expression system, ccs1Δ mutations affect loss of dSOD1 but not
 yeast or human SOD1 examined in parallel. Moreover, in
 CCS–/– mouse models, the mammalian SOD1 polypeptide is
 stable (32). This loss of
 dSOD1 in the absence of CCS is in fact reminiscent of what has been observed
 with certain amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutants of human SOD1 associated
 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
 (33). Because CCS both inserts
 copper and oxidizes the SOD1 disulfide, either one or both of these
 post-translational modifications must be important stabilizing factors for the
 dSOD1 molecule.Prior to these studies, apo-inactive SOD1 was generally thought to stably
 accumulate in cells, allowing for rapid enzyme activation by CCS without the
 need for new SOD1 synthesis
 (31,
 34). Yet Drosophila
 SOD1 does not stably accumulate in the inactive apo-form. Consequently, the
 high level of enzyme activity that is required to defend against oxidative
 challenge would require de novo SOD1 synthesis. The inability of
 CCS-null adults, which are constitutively deficient in SOD1 activity, to mount
 a successful defense against paraquat-induced oxidative stress is consistent
 with this scenario. It is also possible that available copper is limiting in
 Drosophila, and it would be disadvantageous to produce more
 copper-binding SOD1 than is needed.With the exception of certain insects, CCS molecules from diverse
 eukaryotes harbor an MXCXXC near the N terminus that is a
 well characterized Cu(I) site
 (35). Although earlier studies
 with human CCS indicated that the MXCXXC cysteines may be
 necessary for SOD1 activation in vivo
 (36), studies with recombinant
 CCS in vitro indicate that only the C-terminal CXC cysteines
 are needed to bind and transfer the metal
 (37,
 38). We observed that the
 MXCXXC motif is not required for activation of yeast SOD1
 in vivo; copper binding and transfer must occur exclusively via the
 C-terminal CXC motif of CCS and the same must be true for dCCS
 lacking the N-terminal cysteines. It remains possible that in certain species,
 the N-terminal MXCXXC site becomes critical for maintaining
 SOD1 activity when oxygen and/or copper are limiting reagents for CCS. If
 true, the absence of such a motif in Drosophila CCS would minimize
 copper loading of SOD1 when pools of the metal are sparse. However, the
 biological consequences of transient fluctuations in copper availability may
 be minimized by the relative stability of metalated SOD1 coupled with the low
 cell turnover in the post-mitotic Drosophila adult.

CCS in Drosophila is encoded by a single genomic gene,
 Ccs. Mutational inactivation of Ccs generates a set of
 phenotypes that are equivalent to those from a weakly expressing SOD1
 hypomorphic mutation, and are consistent with the notion that CCS appears to
