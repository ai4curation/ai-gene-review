RATIONALE: Cardiomyocytes in adult mammalian hearts are terminally 
differentiated cells that have exited from the cell cycle and lost most of their 
proliferative capacity. Death of mature cardiomyocytes in pathological cardiac 
conditions and the lack of regeneration capacity of adult hearts are primary 
causes of heart failure and mortality. However, how cardiomyocyte proliferation 
in postnatal and adult hearts becomes suppressed remains largely unknown. The 
miR-17-92 cluster was initially identified as a human oncogene that promotes 
cell proliferation. However, its role in the heart remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that miR-17-92 participates in the regulation 
of cardiomyocyte proliferation in postnatal and adult hearts.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We deleted miR-17-92 cluster from embryonic and postnatal 
mouse hearts and demonstrated that miR-17-92 is required for cardiomyocyte 
proliferation in the heart. Transgenic overexpression of miR-17-92 in 
cardiomyocytes is sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte proliferation in embryonic, 
postnatal, and adult hearts. Moreover, overexpression of miR-17-92 in adult 
cardiomyocytes protects the heart from myocardial infarction-induced injury. 
Similarly, we found that members of miR-17-92 cluster, miR-19 in particular, are 
required for and sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte proliferation in vitro. We 
identified phosphatase and tensin homolog, a tumor suppressor, as an miR-17-92 
target to mediate the function of miR-17-92 in cardiomyocyte proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our studies therefore identify miR-17-92 as a critical regulator of 
cardiomyocyte proliferation, and suggest this cluster of microRNAs could become 
therapeutic targets for cardiac repair and heart regeneration.
