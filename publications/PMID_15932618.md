Conditioned taste aversion (CTA), is a form of Pavlovian learning wherein a 
novel flavour is powerfully associated with subsequent feelings of illness, and 
is afterwards avoided. In rats, pharmacological blockade of dopamine D1 
receptors has been reported to prevent the expression of a CTA to the sweet 
taste of sucrose or saccharine. We used genetically modified mice to determine 
whether dopamine D1 receptors are necessary for the expression of a CTA. 
Food-deprived mice lacking the dopamine D1 receptor (D1r-/-) did not express a 
LiCl-induced (125 or 254 mg/kg) CTA to the sweet taste of 0.5 m sucrose, in 
agreement with previous pharmacological studies. However, water-deprived D1r-/- 
mice did express normal LiCl-induced (40, 150 and 254 mg/kg) CTA to a salty 
taste (0.2 m NaCl). Our results suggest that activation of D1 receptors might 
contribute to the strength of an aversive gustatory association, but might not 
be required for the formation of a CTA in general.
