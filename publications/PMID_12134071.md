The actin filament-associated protein and Src-binding partner, AFAP-110, is an 
adaptor protein that links signaling molecules to actin filaments. AFAP-110 
binds actin filaments directly and multimerizes through a leucine zipper motif. 
Cellular signals downstream of Src(527F) can regulate multimerization. Here, we 
determined recombinant AFAP-110 (rAFAP-110)-bound actin filaments cooperatively, 
through a lateral association. We demonstrate rAFAP-110 has the capability to 
cross-link actin filaments, and this ability is dependent on the integrity of 
the carboxy terminal actin binding domain. Deletion of the leucine zipper motif 
or PKC phosphorylation affected AFAP-110's conformation, which correlated with 
changes in multimerization and increased the capability of rAFAP-110 to 
cross-link actin filaments. AFAP-110 is both a substrate and binding partner of 
PKC. On PKC activation, stress filament organization is lost, motility 
structures form, and AFAP-110 colocalizes strongly with motility structures. 
Expression of a deletion mutant of AFAP-110 that is unable to bind PKC blocked 
the effect of PMA on actin filaments. We hypothesize that upon PKC activation, 
AFAP-110 can be cooperatively recruited to newly forming actin filaments, like 
those that exist in cell motility structures, and that PKC phosphorylation 
effects a conformational change that may enable AFAP-110 to promote actin 
filament cross-linking at the cell membrane.
