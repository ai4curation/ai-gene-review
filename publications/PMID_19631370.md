Type I interferons (IFNs) are important for antiviral and autoimmune responses. 
Retinoic acid-induced gene I (RIG-I) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling 
(MAVS) proteins mediate IFN production in response to cytosolic double-stranded 
RNA or single-stranded RNA containing 5'-triphosphate (5'-ppp). Cytosolic B form 
double-stranded DNA, such as poly(dA-dT)*poly(dA-dT) [poly(dA-dT)], can also 
induce IFN-beta, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that the 
cytosolic poly(dA-dT) DNA is converted into 5'-ppp RNA to induce IFN-beta 
through the RIG-I pathway. Biochemical purification led to the identification of 
DNA-dependent RNA polymerase III (Pol-III) as the enzyme responsible for 
synthesizing 5'-ppp RNA from the poly(dA-dT) template. Inhibition of RNA Pol-III 
prevents IFN-beta induction by transfection of DNA or infection with DNA 
viruses. Furthermore, Pol-III inhibition abrogates IFN-beta induction by the 
intracellular bacterium Legionella pneumophila and promotes the bacterial 
growth. These results suggest that RNA Pol-III is a cytosolic DNA sensor 
involved in innate immune responses.
