Nodal signaling, mediated through SMAD transcription factors, is necessary for 
pluripotency maintenance and endoderm commitment. We identified a new motif, 
termed SMAD complex-associated (SCA), that is bound by SMAD2/3/4 and FOXH1 in 
human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and derived endoderm. We demonstrate that two 
basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins-HEB and E2A-bind the SCA motif at regions 
overlapping SMAD2/3 and FOXH1. Furthermore, we show that HEB and E2A associate 
with SMAD2/3 and FOXH1, suggesting they form a complex at critical target 
regions. This association is biologically important, as E2A is critical for 
mesendoderm specification, gastrulation, and Nodal signal transduction in 
Xenopus tropicalis embryos. Taken together, E proteins are novel Nodal signaling 
cofactors that associate with SMAD2/3 and FOXH1 and are necessary for 
mesendoderm differentiation.
