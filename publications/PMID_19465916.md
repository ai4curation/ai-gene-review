Abstract

TRAF6 mediates Lys63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination for NF-κB activation via its N-terminal RING and zinc finger domains. Here we report the crystal structures of TRAF6 and its complex with the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) Ubc13. The RING and zinc fingers of TRAF6 assume a rigid, strikingly elongated structure. Interaction of TRAF6 with Ubc13 involves direct contacts of the RING and the preceding residues while the first zinc finger plays a structural role. Surprisingly, this region of TRAF6 is dimeric both in the crystal and in solution, different from the trimeric C-terminal TRAF domain. Structure-based mutagenesis reveals that TRAF6 dimerization is critical for polyubiquitin synthesis and auto-ubiquitination. Fluorescence energy transfer analysis shows that TRAF6 dimerization induces higher order oligomerization of full-length TRAF6. The mismatch of dimeric and trimeric symmetry may provide a mode of infinite oligomerization that facilitates ligand-dependent signal transduction of many immune receptors.

DISCUSSION

RING domains and their variants may comprise the largest family of ubiquitin ligases 19 . The established concept is that the RING interacts with E2 to bring the substrate to the proximity of E2 for ubiquitination. Our studies show that the RING of TRAF6 does not function alone, but function together with the neighboring sequences in TRAF6 including residues preceding the RING and a structural role of the first zinc finger. Despite the availability of several E2/E3 complex structures 26 , 27 , these details in the interaction of TRAF6 with Ubc13 could not have been predicted. Surprisingly, this interaction is specific for TRAF6, but not other members of the TRAF family, perhaps highlighting the unique critical biological roles of TRAF6 in multiple receptor signaling pathways.

Despite the trimeric symmetry of the C-terminal domain of TRAF6, the N-terminal domain of TRAF6 is dimerized via its RING domain and the linker helix to enable the formation of a dimeric TRAF6/Ubc13/Uev1A complex ( Fig. 6d ). While RING dimerization has been observed before 34 , 35 , its functional consequence has not been fully investigated. In the case of TRAF6, dimerization is important for its ability to promote poly-Ub synthesis, auto-ubiquitination and NF-κB activation and correlates with its higher order oligomerization. However, how TRAF6 dimerization facilitates these activities remains to be elucidated. For synthesizing long poly-Ub chains, it is crucial to preferentially re-use poly-Ub intermediates in the following cycle of ubiquitination. Therefore, a simplest explanation might be that TRAF6 dimerization results in increased local concentration of the Ubc13/Uev1A complex to trap locally generated poly-Ub intermediates. Heterologous dimerization has been shown to activate the E2 cdc34 E2 directly in the absence of E3 36 . In addition, when Ubc13 is loaded with donor Ub, the E2/E3 complex dimers may further tetramerize through the low affinity interaction between Uev1A and the Ub 14 ( Fig. 6e ). The tendency to form oligomers for Ub-loaded E2 UbcH5 has been shown and is required for processive BRCA1-directed ubiquitination 37 .

For TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination, it is possible that dimerization of the TRAF6 N-terminal region is required because it promotes higher order aggregation. We have shown that the N-terminal region per se is not sufficient for TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination in cells; instead, the trimeric coiled coil region is also needed (data not shown). On the molecular level, the observed higher order aggregation of TRAF6 is consistent with an infinite expandable model of full-length TRAF6 in its activated state as a consequence of the symmetry mismatch between its N- and C-terminal regions. In this model, the dimeric and trimeric symmetry axes are roughly parallel to each other and both perpendicular to the membrane surface to enable multiple engagements of receptor trimers ( Fig. 6f ). The size of the aggregate may depend on TRAF6 concentration, receptor engagement and interaction with other signaling proteins in the cell. Both dimerization and trimerization would cooperate in this model to form the lattice of interactions and the expanded lattice would in turn strengthen dimerization and trimerization. It is likely that the lattice of interactions, as well as the inherent flexibility at the N- and C-terminal region junctions, provides the necessary geometry required for transfer of poly-Ub chains, in trans , from one E2 to the TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination site at K124 of another TRAF6/E2 complex.

In the context of this model, the difference in FRET signals between wild type TRAF6 and the F118A mutant may have been resulted from stabilization of TRAF6 trimerization in the expanded lattice of interactions. The distance between the C-terminus of TRAF6 in the protomers of the trimer is approximately 26 Å in the crystal structure of the C-terminal region of TRAF6 3 , 5 , while the estimated distance between dimerically related C-termini is more than 200 Å. Alternatively, because the linker region between the end of zinc finger 4 and the beginning of the coiled coil is predicted to lack secondary structures and therefore may be flexible, it is also possible that different C-terminal trimers may be brought into close proximity as well in this higher order aggregation, leading to enhanced FRET signals.

Therefore, our studies have not only unveiled interesting aspects of TRAF6 E2 interaction and dimerization, but also revealed an unexpected platform of oligomerization in mediating TRAF6 function. The massive increase in local concentrations of the associated signaling proteins in this aggregation platform likely acts as a factory to promote poly-Ub synthesis, auto-ubiquitination and recruitment of downstream proteins such as the TAK1 complex and the IKK complex. In keeping with this concept, recent studies suggest that the critical role of oligomerization in ubiquitination in general may be more prevalent than previously anticipated 38 – 40 . Interestingly, the proposed model of TRAF6 aggregation bears unexpected similarity to assembly of the death receptor signaling complex upon activation of Fas, a death receptor in the TNF receptor superfamily 41 – 43 . The aggregations in both systems could provide an elegant scaffold to facilitate proximity-induced caspase activation, ubiquitination or kinase activation. On a conceptual level, these observations signify a convergence of the signaling mechanisms of caspase mediated death pathways and the TRAF mediated survival pathways in immune receptor signal transduction.
