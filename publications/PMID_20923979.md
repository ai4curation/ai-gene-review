In animals, RFX transcription factors govern ciliogenesis by binding to an X-box 
motif in the promoters of ciliogenic genes. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the sole 
RFX transcription factor (TF) daf-19 null mutant lacks all sensory cilia, fails 
to express many ciliogenic genes, and is defective in many sensory behaviors, 
including male mating. The daf-19c isoform is expressed in all ciliated sensory 
neurons and is necessary and sufficient for activating X-box containing 
ciliogenesis genes. Here, we describe the daf-19(n4132) mutant that is defective 
in expression of the sensory polycystic kidney disease (PKD) gene battery and 
male mating behavior, without affecting expression of ciliogenic genes or 
ciliogenesis. daf-19(n4132) disrupts expression of a new isoform, daf-19m (for 
function in male mating). daf-19m is expressed in male-specific PKD and core IL2 
neurons via internal promoters and remote enhancer elements located in introns 
of the daf-19 genomic locus. daf-19m genetically programs the sensory functions 
of a subset of ciliated neurons, independent of daf-19c. In the male-specific 
HOB neuron, DAF-19(M) acts downstream of the zinc finger TF EGL-46, indicating 
that a TF cascade controls the PKD gene battery in this cell-type specific 
context. We conclude that the RFX TF DAF-19 regulates ciliogenesis via X-box 
containing ciliogenic genes and controls ciliary specialization by regulating 
non-X-box containing sensory genes. This study reveals a more extensive role for 
RFX TFs in generating fully functional cilia.
