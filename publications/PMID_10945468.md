F-box proteins are critical components of the SCF ubiquitin-protein ligase 
complex and are involved in substrate recognition and recruitment for 
ubiquitination and consequent degradation by the proteasome. We have isolated 
cDNAs encoding a further 10 mammalian F-box proteins. Five of them (FBL3 to 
FBL7) share structural similarities with Skp2 and contain C-terminal 
leucine-rich repeats. The other 5 proteins have different putative 
protein-protein interaction motifs. Specifically, FBS and FBWD4 proteins contain 
Sec7 and WD40-repeat domains, respectively. The C-terminal region of FBA shares 
similarity with bacterial protein ApaG while FBG2 shows homology with the F-box 
protein NFB42. The marked differences in F-box gene expression in human tissues 
suggest their distinct role in ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation.
