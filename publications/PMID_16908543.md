Heterochromatin is nucleated at a specific site and subsequently spreads into 
distal sequences through multiple interactions between modified histones and 
nonhistone proteins. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these nonhistone 
proteins include Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4. We have previously shown that loss of the 
C-terminal Rap1 domain containing Sir3 and Sir4 association sites can be 
overcome by tethering a 144-amino-acid C-terminal domain (CTD) of Sir3 adjacent 
to the telomere. Here, we explore the substructure and functions of the CTD. We 
demonstrate that the CTD is the minimum domain for Sir3 homodimerization, a 
function that is conserved in related yeasts. However, CTD heterodimers 
associate at only low efficiencies and correspondingly have low levels of 
tethered silencing, consistent with an essential role for dimerization in 
tethered silencing. Six missense alleles were generated, with ctd-Y964A 
producing the most extreme phenotypes when tethered to the LexA binding sites. 
Although ctd-Y964A is capable of dimerization, telomere silencing is abrogated, 
indicating that the CTD serves a second essential function in silencing. 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of wild-type and ctd-Y964A mutant cells 
indicate an association of the CTD with the deacetylated histone tails of H3 and 
H4 that is necessary for the recruitment of Sir3. The efficiency of spreading 
depends upon the apparent stoichiometry and stability during the initiation 
event. The predicted Cdc6 domain III winged-helix structure may well be 
responsible for dimerization.
