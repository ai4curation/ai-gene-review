BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal (BRCT) motifs are present in a number of proteins 
involved in DNA repair and/or DNA damage signaling pathways. The BRCT 
domain-containing protein BRCTx has been shown to interact physically with 
RAD18, an E3 ligase involved in postreplication repair and homologous 
recombination repair. However, the physiological relevance of the interaction 
between RAD18 and BRCTx is largely unknown. In this study, we showed that RAD18 
interacts with BRCTx in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and that this 
interaction, mediated via highly conserved serine residues on the RAD18 C 
terminus, is required for BRCTx accumulation at DNA damage sites. Furthermore, 
we uncovered critical roles of the RAD18-BRCTx module in UV-induced DNA damage 
repair but not PCNA mono-ubiquitination or homologous recombination. Thus, our 
results suggest that RAD18 has an additional function in the surveillance of the 
UV-induced DNA damage response signal.
