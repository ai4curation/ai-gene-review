Notch signaling controls multiple developmental processes, thus demanding 
versatile functions. We have previously shown that this may be partly achieved 
by accelerating ubiquitin-mediated degradation of important regulators of 
differentiation. However, the underlying mechanism was unknown. We now find that 
Notch signaling transcriptionally activates the gene encoding ankyrin-repeat 
SOCS box-containing protein 2 (Asb2). Asb2 promotes the ubiquitination of Notch 
targets such as E2A and Janus kinase (Jak) 2, and a dominant-negative (DN) 
mutant of Asb2 blocks Notch-induced degradation of these proteins. Asb2 likely 
binds Jak2 directly but associates with E2A through Skp2. We next provide 
evidence to suggest that Asb2 bridges the formation of non-canonical 
cullin-based complexes through interaction with not only ElonginB/C and Cullin 
(Cul) 5, but also the F-box-containing protein, Skp2, which is known to 
associate with Skp1 and Cul1. Consistently, ablating the function of Cul1 or 
Cul5 using DN mutants or siRNAs protected both E2A and Jak2 from Asb2-mediated 
or Notch-induced degradation. By shifting monomeric E3 ligase complexes to 
dimeric forms through activation of Asb2 transcription, Notch could effectively 
control the turnover of a variety of substrates and it exerts diverse effects on 
cell proliferation and differentiation.
