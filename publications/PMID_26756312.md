The adaptor protein 4 (AP4) complex (ϵ/β4/μ4/σ4 subunits) forms a non-clathrin 
coat on vesicles departing the trans-Golgi network. AP4 biology remains poorly 
understood, in stark contrast to the wealth of molecular data available for the 
related clathrin adaptors AP1 and AP2. AP4 is important for human health because 
mutations in any AP4 subunit cause severe neurological problems, including 
intellectual disability and progressive spastic para- or tetraplegias. We have 
used a range of structural, biochemical and biophysical approaches to determine 
the molecular basis for how the AP4 β4 C-terminal appendage domain interacts 
with tepsin, the only known AP4 accessory protein. We show that tepsin harbors a 
hydrophobic sequence, LFxG[M/L]x[L/V], in its unstructured C-terminus, which 
binds directly and specifically to the C-terminal β4 appendage domain. Using 
nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift mapping, we define the binding site on 
the β4 appendage by identifying residues on the surface whose signals are 
perturbed upon titration with tepsin. Point mutations in either the tepsin 
LFxG[M/L]x[L/V] sequence or in its cognate binding site on β4 abolish in vitro 
binding. In cells, the same point mutations greatly reduce the amount of tepsin 
that interacts with AP4. However, they do not abolish the binding between tepsin 
and AP4 completely, suggesting the existence of additional interaction sites 
between AP4 and tepsin. These data provide one of the first detailed mechanistic 
glimpses at AP4 coat assembly and should provide an entry point for probing the 
role of AP4-coated vesicles in cell biology, and especially in neuronal 
function.
