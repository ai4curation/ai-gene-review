Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from human bone marrow have capability to 
differentiate into cells of mesenchymal lineage. The cells have already been 
applied in various clinical situations because of their expansion and 
differentiation capabilities. The cells lose their capabilities after several 
passages, however. With the aim of conferring higher capability on human bone 
marrow MSCs, we introduced the Sox2 or Nanog gene into the cells. Sox2 and Nanog 
are not only essential for pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem 
cells, but also expressed in somatic stem cells that have superior expansion and 
differentiation potentials. We found that Sox2-expressing MSCs showed consistent 
proliferation and osteogenic capability in culture media containing basic 
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) compared to control cells. Significantly, in the 
presence of bFGF in culture media, most of the Sox2-expressing cells were small, 
whereas the control cells were elongated in shape. We also found that 
Nanog-expressing cells even in the absence of bFGF had much higher capabilities 
for expansion and osteogenesis than control cells. These results demonstrate not 
only an effective way to maintain proliferation and differentiation potentials 
of MSCs but also an important implication about the function of bFGF for 
self-renewal of stem cells including MSCs.
