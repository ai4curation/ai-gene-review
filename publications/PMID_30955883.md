Maintaining proteostasis in eukaryotic protein folding involves cooperation of 
distinct chaperone systems. To understand how the essential ring-shaped 
chaperonin TRiC/CCT cooperates with the chaperone prefoldin/GIMc (PFD), we 
integrate cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), crosslinking-mass-spectrometry and 
biochemical and cellular approaches to elucidate the structural and functional 
interplay between TRiC/CCT and PFD. We find these hetero-oligomeric chaperones 
associate in a defined architecture, through a conserved interface of 
electrostatic contacts that serves as a pivot point for a TRiC-PFD 
conformational cycle. PFD alternates between an open "latched" conformation and 
a closed "engaged" conformation that aligns the PFD-TRiC substrate binding 
chambers. PFD can act after TRiC bound its substrates to enhance the rate and 
yield of the folding reaction, suppressing non-productive reaction cycles. 
Disrupting the TRiC-PFD interaction in vivo is strongly deleterious, leading to 
accumulation of amyloid aggregates. The supra-chaperone assembly formed by PFD 
and TRiC is essential to prevent toxic conformations and ensure effective 
cellular proteostasis.
