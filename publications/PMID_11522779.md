SRCAP (SNF2-related CPB activator protein) belongs to the SNF2 family of 
proteins whose members participate in various aspects of transcriptional 
regulation, including chromatin remodeling. It was identified by its ability to 
bind to cAMP-responsive-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), and it 
increases the transactivation function of CBP. The phosphoenolpyruvate 
carboxykinase (PEPCK) promoter was used as a model system to explore the role of 
SRCAP in the regulation of transcription mediated by factors that utilize CBP as 
a coactivator. We show that transcription of a PEPCK chloramphenicol 
acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene activated by protein kinase A (PKA) is 
enhanced 7-fold by SRCAP. In the absence of PKA this SRCAP-mediated enhancement 
does not occur, suggesting that SRCAP functions as a coactivator for 
PKA-activated factors such as CREB. Replacing the PEPCK promoter binding site 
for CREB with a binding site for Gal4 (DeltaCRE (cAMP-responsive element) Gal4 
PEPCK-CAT reporter gene) blocks the ability of SRCAP to activate transcription 
despite the presence of PKA. Expression of a Gal-CREB chimera restores the 
ability of PKA to regulate transcription of the DeltaCRE Gal4 PEPCK gene and 
restored the ability of SRCAP to stimulate PKA-activated transcription. In 
addition, SRCAP in the presence of PKA enhances the ability of the Gal-CREB 
chimera to activate transcription of a Gal-CAT reporter gene that contains only 
binding sites for Gal4. SRCAP binds to CBP amino acids 280-460, a region that is 
important for CBP to function as a coactivator for CREB. Overexpression of a 
SRCAP peptide corresponding to this CBP binding domain acts as a dominant 
negative inhibitor of CREB-mediated transcription. Structure-function studies 
were done to explore the mechanism(s) by which SRCAP regulates transcription. 
These studies indicate that the N-terminal region of SRCAP, which contains five 
of the seven regions that comprise the ATPase domain, is not needed for 
activation of CREB-mediated transcription. SRCAP apparently has several domains 
that participate in the activation of transcription.
