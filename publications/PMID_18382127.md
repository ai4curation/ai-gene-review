CARP1 and CARP2 proteins (CARPs) are E3 ligases that target p53 as well as 
phospho-p53 for degradation. Because MDM2 is a critical regulator of p53 
turnover, we investigated and found that CARPs associate with MDM2. We provide 
evidence that CARPs stabilize MDM2 by inhibiting MDM2 self-ubiquitination. CARPs 
together with MDM2 enhance p53 degradation, thereby inhibiting p53-mediated cell 
death. CARP protein levels correlate with MDM2 levels including under hypoxia 
where both are reduced. CARP2 was found to target 14-3-3sigma for degradation, 
leading to MDM2 stabilization. MDMX, a homolog of MDM2, is not absolutely 
required for MDM2 stabilization by CARPs, although overexpression of CARP2 
enhances MDM2/MDMX interaction. Taken together, our study identifies novel 
mechanisms by which CARP proteins regulate the p53 signaling pathway.
