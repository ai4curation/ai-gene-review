Wolfram (DIDMOAD) syndrome is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder 
accompanied by insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and progressive optic 
atrophy. Recent positional cloning led to identification of the WFS1 (Wolfram 
syndrome 1) gene, a member of a novel gene family of unknown function. In this 
study, we generated a specific antibody against the C-terminus of the WFS1 
protein and investigated its subcellular localization in cultured cells. We also 
studied its distribution in the rat brain. Biochemical studies indicated the 
WFS1 protein to be an integral, endoglycosidase H-sensitive membrane 
glycoprotein that localizes primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 
Consistent with this, immunofluorescence cell staining of overexpressed WFS1 
showed a characteristic reticular pattern over the cytoplasm and overlapped with 
the ER marker staining. No co-localization of WFS1 with mitochondria argues 
against an earlier clinical hypothesis that Wolfram syndrome is a 
mitochondria-mediated disorder. In the rat brain, at both the protein and mRNA 
level, WFS1 was found to be present predominantly in selected neurons in the 
hippocampus CA1, amygdaloid areas, olfactory tubercle and superficial layer of 
the allocortex. These expression sites, i.e. components of the limbic system or 
structures closely associated with this system, may be involved in the 
psychiatric, behavioral and emotional abnormalities characteristic of this 
syndrome. ER localization of WFS1 suggests that this protein plays an as yet 
undefined role in membrane trafficking, protein processing and/or regulation of 
ER calcium homeostasis. These studies represent a first step toward the 
characterization of WFS1 protein, which presumably functions to maintain certain 
populations of neuronal and endocrine cells.
