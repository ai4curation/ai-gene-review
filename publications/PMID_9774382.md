The gene encoding the human TLS protein, also termed FUS, is located at the site 
of chromosomal translocations in human leukemias and sarcomas where it forms a 
chimeric fusion gene with one of several different genes. To identify 
interacting partners of TLS, we screened a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library 
constructed from mouse hematopoietic cells using the C-terminal region of TLS in 
the bait plasmid. Two cDNAs encoding members of the serine-arginine (SR) family 
of proteins were isolated. The first SR protein is the mouse homolog of human 
splicing factor SC35, and the second SR member is a novel 183-amino acid protein 
that we term TASR (TLS-associated serine-arginine protein). cDNA cloning of 
human TASR indicated that mouse and human TASR have identical amino acid 
sequences. The interactions between TLS and these two SR proteins were confirmed 
by co-transfection and immunoprecipitation studies. In vivo splicing assays 
indicated that SC35 and TASR influence splice site selection of adenovirus E1A 
pre-mRNA. TLS may recruit SR splicing factors to specific target genes through 
interaction with its C-terminal region, and chromosomal translocations that 
truncate the C-terminal region of TLS may prevent this interaction. Thus TLS 
translocations may alter RNA processing and play a role in malignant 
transformation.
