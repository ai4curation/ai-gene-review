A yeast gene, SPA2, was isolated with human anti-spindle pole autoantibodies. 
The SPA2 gene was fused to the Escherichia coli trpE gene, and polyclonal 
antibodies were prepared to the fusion protein. Immunofluorescence experiments 
indicate that the SPA2 gene product has a sharply polarized distribution in 
yeast cells. In budded cells the SPA2 protein is present at the tip of the bud; 
in unbudded cells, it is localized to one edge of the cell. When a-cells are 
induced to form schmoos with alpha-factor, the SPA2 protein is found at the tip 
of the schmoo. These areas of SPA2 localization correspond to cellular sites 
expected to be involved in bud formation and/or cell growth. The SPA2 antigen is 
present in a-cells, alpha-cells, and a/alpha-diploid cells, but is absent in 
mutant cells in which the SPA2 gene has been disrupted. spa2 mutant cells are 
viable, but display defects in the direction and control of cell growth. 
Compared to wild-type cells, spa2 mutant cells have slightly altered budding 
patterns. Entry into stationary phase is impaired for spa2 mutants, and mutants 
with one particular allele, spa2-7, form multiple buds under nutrient-limiting 
conditions. Thus, SPA2 is a newly identified yeast gene that is involved in the 
direction and control of cell division, and whose gene product localizes to the 
site of cell growth.
