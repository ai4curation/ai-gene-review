Serglycin is a major proteoglycan of hematopoietic cells. It is thought to play 
a role in the packaging of granule proteins in human neutrophil granulocytes. 
The presence of serglycin in myeloid cells has been demonstrated only at the 
transcriptional level. We generated a polyclonal antibody against recombinant 
human serglycin. Here, we show the localization of serglycin in humans during 
neutrophil differentiation. Immunocytochemistry revealed serglycin 
immunoreactivity in the Golgi area of promyelocytes (PM) and myelocytes (MC), as 
well as in a few band cells and mature neutrophil granulocytes. Granular 
staining was detected near the Golgi apparatus in some of the PM, and the major 
part of the cytoplasm was negative. Immunoelectron microscopy showed serglycin 
immunoreactivity located to the Golgi apparatus and a few immature granules of 
PM and MC. The decreasing level of serglycin protein during myeloid 
differentiation coincided with a decrease of mRNA expression, as evaluated by 
Northern blotting. Subcellular fractions of neutrophil granulocytes were 
obtained. Serglycin immunoreactivity was detected in the fraction containing 
Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and secretory vesicles by Western blotting and 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serglycin was not detected in subcellular 
fractions containing primary, secondary, or tertiary granules. Together, these 
findings indicate that serglycin is located to the Golgi apparatus and a few 
immature granules during neutrophil differentiation. This is consistent with a 
function for serglycin in formation of granules in neutrophil granulocytes. Our 
findings contrast the view that native serglycin is present in mature granules 
and plays a role in packaging and regulating the activity of proteolytic enzymes 
there.
