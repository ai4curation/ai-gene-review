The microRNA, miR-155 regulates both adaptive and innate immune responses. In 
viral infections, miR-155 can affect both innate immunity (interferon response, 
natural killer cell activity, and macrophage polarization) and adaptive immunity 
(including generation of anti-viral antibodies, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, 
Th17, Th2, Th1, Tfh and Treg cells). In many viral infections, the proper and 
timely regulation of miR-155 expression is critical for the induction of an 
effective anti-virus immune response and viral clearance without any harmful 
immunopathologic consequences. MiR-155 may also exert pro-viral effects, mainly 
through the inhibition of the anti-viral interferon response. Thus, dysregulated 
expression of miR-155 can result in virus persistence and disruption of the 
normal response to viral infections. This review provides a thorough discussion 
of the role of miR-155 in immune responses and immunopathologic reactions during 
viral infections, and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target.
