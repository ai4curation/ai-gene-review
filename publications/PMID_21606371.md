Endogenous and pharmacologic glucocorticoids (GCs) limit inflammatory cascades 
initiated by Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation. A long-standing clinical 
observation has been the delay between GC administration and the manifestation 
of GC's anti-inflammatory actions. We hypothesized that the GCs would have 
inhibitory effects that target late temporal pathways that propagate 
proinflammatory signals. Here we interrogated signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 1 (STAT1) regulation by GC and its consequences for cytokine 
production during activation of macrophages with TLR-specific ligands. We found 
that robust STAT1 activation does not occur until 2-3 h after TLR engagement, 
and that GC suppression of STAT1 phosphorylation first manifests at this time. 
GC attenuates TLR4-mediated STAT1 activation only through induction of 
suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), which increases throughout the 6-h 
period after treatment. Inhibition of TLR3-mediated STAT1 activation occurs via 
two mechanisms, impairment of type I IFN secretion and induction of SOCS1. Our 
data show that SOCS1 and type I interferons are critical GC targets for 
regulating STAT1 activity and may account for overall GC effectiveness in 
inflammation suppression in the clinically relevant time frame.
