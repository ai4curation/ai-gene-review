Two interacting heat shock cognate proteins in the lumen of the yeast 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Sec63p and BiP (Kar2p), are required for 
posttranslational translocation of yeast alpha-factor precursor in vitro. To 
investigate the role of these proteins in cotranslational translocation, we 
examined the import of invertase into wild-type, sec63, and kar2 mutant yeast 
membranes. We found that Sec63p and Kar2p are necessary for both co- and 
posttranslational translocation in yeast. Several kar2 mutants, one of which had 
normal ATPase activity, were defective in cotranslational translocation of 
invertase. We conclude that the requirement for BiP/Kar2p, which is not seen in 
a reaction reconstituted with pure mammalian membrane proteins [Görlich, D. & 
Rapoport, T.A. (1993) Cell 75, 615-630], is not due to a distinction between 
cotranslational translocation in mammalian cells and posttranslational 
translocation in yeast cells.
