To determine the role of the transcription factor signal transducer and 
activator of transcription (STAT) 1 on endothelial cell function, human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with IFN-gamma, a potent 
activator of STAT1. IFN-gamma inhibited cell growth and tube formation of 
HUVECs. Although the potent proangiogenic protein vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) stimulated cell growth and tube formation, IFN-gamma could 
suppress these effects of VEGF. Transfection of HUVECs with short interfering 
RNA targeting STAT1 abrogated IFN-gamma-induced inhibition of HUVEC growth and 
tube formation, and suppressed the inhibition of VEGF-induced tube formation by 
IFN-gamma, indicating that STAT1 is critical for this process. IFN-gamma blocks 
the biological activity of VEGF through inhibition of genes necessary for the 
VEGF response, including angiopoietin-2, urokinase plasminogen activator, tissue 
inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1, cyclooxygenase-2, and VEGF receptor 2. 
To extend these findings in vivo, the role of STAT1 in angiogenesis was examined 
in STAT1-deficient mice using the Matrigel in vivo angiogenesis assay. 
Substantial cellular infiltration and formation of vascular structures occurred 
in STAT1-/- mice compared with wild-type controls. These data indicate that 
STAT1 plays a key role in the inhibition of angiogenesis through its action 
within endothelial cells, and exploiting this process may be useful in treating 
cancers and vascular tumors.
