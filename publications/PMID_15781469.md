Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling is critical in a variety of 
biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. 
TGF-beta signaling is mediated by a group of proteins including TGF-beta 
receptors and Smads. It is known that different cells can exhibit different 
sensitivities to TGF-beta. Several molecular mechanisms, such as the 
differential expression of the receptor levels, have been suggested as 
contributing to these differences. Here, we report evidence for a novel 
mechanism of regulating TGF-beta sensitivity that depends on the role of CHIP 
(carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) in regulating the basal level 
of Smad3 via the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway. First, using a 
luciferase assay we found that overexpression of CHIP inhibited TGF-beta 
signaling, whereas silencing CHIP expression by small interfering RNAs led to 
increased TGF-beta signaling sensitivity. Second, based on the results of cell 
proliferation assays and JunB expression, we found that TGF-beta signaling could 
be abolished by stably overexpressing CHIP. Third, in those cell lines with 
stably expressed CHIP, we observed that the Smad3 protein level was dramatically 
decreased. Finally, we demonstrated that CHIP served as a U-box dependent E3 
ligase that can directly mediate ubiquitination and degradation of Smad3 and 
that this action of CHIP was independent of TGF-beta signaling. Taken together, 
these findings suggest that CHIP can modulate the sensitivity of the TGF-beta 
signaling by controlling the basal level of Smad3 through ubiquitin-mediated 
degradation.
