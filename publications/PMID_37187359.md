ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The dried fruit of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis 
(Zhizi in Chinese) is a traditional medicine used for thousands of years in 
China, Japan and Korea. Zhizi was recorded in Shennong Herbal, as a folk 
medicine, it reduces fever and treats gastrointestinal disturbance with 
antiphlogistic effects. Geniposide, an iridoid glycoside, is an important 
bioactive compound derived from Zhizi and possesses remarkable antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory capacities. The pharmacological efficacy of Zhizi is highly 
related to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of geniposide.
AIM OF THE STUDY: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a common chronic gastrointestinal 
disease as a global public health threat. Redox imbalance is an essential factor 
in the progression and recurrence of UC. This study aimed to explore the 
therapeutic effect of geniposide on colitis and uncover the underlying 
mechanisms of geniposide-mediated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The study design involved investigating the novel mechanism 
by which geniposide ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in 
vivo and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged colonic epithelial cells in vitro.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The protective effect of geniposide against colitis was 
evaluated by histopathologic observation and biochemical analysis of colonic 
tissues in DSS-induced colitis mice. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
effects of geniposide were evaluated in both DSS-induced colitis mice and 
LPS-challenged colonic epithelial cells. Immunoprecipitation, drug affinity 
responsive target stability (DARTS), and molecular docking were performed to 
identify the potential therapeutic target of geniposide and the potential 
binding sites and patterns.
RESULTS: Geniposide ameliorated the symptoms of DSS-induced colitis and colonic 
barrier injury, inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and suppressed 
activation of the NF-κB signaling in colonic tissues of DSS-challenged mice. 
Geniposide also ameliorated lipid peroxidation and restored redox homeostasis in 
DSS-treated colonic tissues. In addition, in vitro experiments also showed that 
geniposide exhibited significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity, as 
evidenced by suppressed IκB-α and p65 phosphorylation and IκB-α degradation, and 
enhanced the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of Nrf2 in LPS-treated 
Caco2 cells. ML385, a specific Nrf2 inhibitor, abolished the protective effect 
of geniposide against LPS-induced inflammation. Mechanistically, geniposide 
could bind to KEAP1, thereby disrupting the interaction between KEAP1 and Nrf2, 
preventing Nrf2 from degradation and activating the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway, 
ultimately suppressing the onset of inflammation caused by redox imbalance.
CONCLUSIONS: Geniposide ameliorates colitis by activation of Nrf2/ARE signaling, 
while preventing colonic redox imbalance and inflammatory damage, indicating 
that geniposide can be considered as a promising lead compound for the treatment 
of colitis.
