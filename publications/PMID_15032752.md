Alpha-Sarcoglycan is a glycoprotein associated with the dystrophin complex at 
sarcolemma of skeletal and cardiac muscles. Gene defects in alpha-sarcoglycan 
lead to a severe muscular dystrophy whose molecular mechanisms are not yet 
clear. A first insight into the function of alpha-sarcoglycan was obtained by 
finding that it is an ATP-binding protein and that it probably confers ability 
to hydrolyse ATP to the purified dystrophin complex [Betto, Senter, Ceoldo, 
Tarricone, Biral and Salviati (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 7907-7912]. In the 
present study, we present definitive evidence showing that alpha-sarcoglycan is 
an ATP-hydrolysing enzyme. The appearance of alpha-sarcoglycan protein 
expression was correlated with the increase in ecto-nucleotidase activity during 
differentiation of C2C12 cells. Approx. 25% of ecto-nucleotidase activity 
displayed by the C2C12 myotubes was inhibited by preincubating cells with an 
antibody specific for the ATP-binding motif of alpha-sarcoglycan. This 
demonstrates that alpha-sarcoglycan substantially contributes to total 
ecto-nucleotidase activity of C2C12 myotubes. To characterize further this 
activity, human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with expression 
plasmids containing alpha-sarcoglycan cDNA. Transfected cells exhibited a 
significant increase in the ATP-hydrolysing activity that was abolished by the 
anti-alpha-sarcoglycan antibody. The enzyme had a substrate specificity for ATP 
and ADP, did not hydrolyse other triphosphonucleosides, and the affinity for ATP 
was in the low mM range. The ATPase activity strictly required the presence of 
both Mg2+ and Ca2+ and was completely inhibited by suramin and reactive blue-2. 
These results show that alpha-sarcoglycan is a Ca2+, Mg2+-ecto-ATPDase. The 
possible consequences of the absence of alpha-sarcoglycan activity in the 
pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy are discussed.
