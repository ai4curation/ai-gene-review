Matrix metalloproteinases are zinc-dependent endopeptidases conserved throughout 
the animal kingdom which primarily degrade components of the extracellular 
matrix. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the zinc matrix 
metalloproteinase (ZMP-2) was demonstrated to increase resistance versus heat 
and bacterial pathogens. Here, we show that the survival reducing activities 
caused by the knockdown of zmp-2 in C. elegans essentially requires the presence 
of vitellogenin-6, a protein homologous to mammalian apolipoprotein B, and 
RME-2, a receptor mediating endocytosis of cholesterol particles. Measurements 
of reactive oxygen species inside and outside C. elegans revealed that knockdown 
of zmp-2 causes a prooxidative extracellular mileu which is a prerequisite for 
the reduction of survival. Interestingly, RNAi for the foxo transcription factor 
daf-16 completely prevented those survival reducing effects of zmp-2 RNAi, and 
RNAi in mutants of the steroid signalling pathway revealed that DAF-16 acts by 
inhibition of DAF-9 and DAF-12. In conclusion, our study demonstrates survival 
reducing activities caused by the functional loss of ZMP-2 in C. elegans. Those 
effects are mediated by the transport of oxidized cholesterol adducts which then 
trigger the inhibition of DAF-9 and DAF-12 through the activation of DAF-16.
