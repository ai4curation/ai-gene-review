The molecular chaperone Hsc70 assists in the folding of non-native proteins 
together with its J domain- and BAG domain-containing cofactors. In 
Caenorhabditis elegans, two BAG domain-containing proteins can be identified, 
one of them being UNC-23, whose mutation induces severe motility dysfunctions. 
Using reporter strains, we find that the full-length UNC-23, in contrast to 
C-terminal fragments, localizes specifically to the muscular attachment sites. 
C-terminal fragments of UNC-23 instead perform all Hsc70-related functions, like 
ATPase stimulation and regulation of folding activity, albeit with lower 
affinity than BAG-1. Interestingly, overexpression of CFP-Hsc70 can induce 
muscular defects in wild-type nematodes that phenocopy the knockout of its 
cofactor UNC-23. Strikingly, the motility dysfunction in the unc-23 mutated 
strain can be cured specifically by down-regulation of the antagonistic Hsc70 
cochaperone DNJ-13, implying that the severe phenotype is caused by 
misregulation of the Hsc70 cycle. These findings point out that the balanced 
action of cofactors in the ATP-driven cycle of Hsc70 is crucial for the 
contribution of Hsc70 to muscle functionality.
