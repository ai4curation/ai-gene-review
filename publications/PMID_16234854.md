Tunicamycin-inducible gene A polypeptide (TIGA) is a member of the protein 
disulfide isomerase (PDI) family and is suggested to facilitate the folding of 
nascent polypeptides. The functional properties of TIGA were investigated here. 
TIGA acted as an isomerase, catalyzing the refolding of denatured and reduced 
ribonuclease A. TIGA also exhibited chaperone activity in the refolding of 
denatured prochymosin but not in the refolding of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), indicating that it had substrate specificity with respect 
to chaperone activity. Detailed study with a series of thioredoxin-motif 
(trx-motif) mutants revealed that the 2 trx-motifs of TIGA were not equal in 
activity. The N-terminal trx-motif was more active than the C-terminal 
trx-motif, and the first cysteine in each trx-motif was necessary for isomerase 
activity.
