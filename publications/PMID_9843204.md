Leigh Syndrome (LS) is a severe neurological disorder characterized by 
bilaterally symmetrical necrotic lesions in subcortical brain regions that is 
commonly associated with systemic cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency. COX 
deficiency is an autosomal recessive trait and most patients belong to a single 
genetic complementation group. DNA sequence analysis of the genes encoding the 
structural subunits of the COX complex has failed to identify a pathogenic 
mutation. Using microcell-mediated chromosome transfer, we mapped the gene 
defect in this disorder to chromosome 9q34 by complementation of the respiratory 
chain deficiency in patient fibroblasts. Analysis of a candidate gene (SURF1) of 
unknown function revealed several mutations, all of which predict a truncated 
protein. These data suggest a role for SURF1 in the biogenesis of the COX 
complex and define a new class of gene defects causing human neurodegenerative 
disease.
