Endosomal recycling of the mammalian iron transporter DMT1 is assumed to be 
important for efficient and rapid uptake of iron across the endosomal membrane 
in the transferrin cycle. Here, we show that the retromer, a complex that 
mediates retrograde transport of transmembrane cargoes from endosomes to the 
trans-Golgi network, is required for endosomal recycling of DMT1-II, an 
alternative splicing isoform of DMT1. Bacterially expressed Vps26-Vsp29-Vsp35 
trimer, a retromer cargo recognition complex, specifically binds to the 
cytoplasmic tail domain of DMT1-II in vitro. In particular, this binding is 
dependent on a specific hydrophobic motif of DMT1-II, which is required for its 
endosomal recycling. DMT1-II colocalizes with the Vps35 subunit of the retromer 
in TfR-positive endosomes. Depletion of the retromer by siRNA against Vps35 
leads to mis-sorting of DMT1-II to LAMP2-positive structures, and expression of 
siRNA-resistant Vps35 can rescue this effect. These findings demonstrate that 
the retromer recognizes the recycling signal of DMT1-II and ensures its proper 
endosomal recycling.
