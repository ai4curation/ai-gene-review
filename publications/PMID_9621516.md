We isolated a novel human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter cDNA, 
determined its nucleotide sequence, and designated it human ABC7 (hABC7). The 
nucleotide sequence was highly homologous to the ATM1 gene in yeast, which 
encodes an ABC transporter (yAtm1p) located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. 
The deduced human product, a putative half-type transporter, consists of 752 
amino acids that are 48.9% identical to those of yAtm1p. A computer-assisted 
protein structural and localization analysis revealed that the mitochondrial 
targeting signal of yAtm1p is conserved in the N-terminal region of the primary 
sequence of the hABC7 protein, and therefore this product is also likely to be 
located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The evidence strongly suggests that 
the hABC7 gene is a counterpart of ATM1 and that its product is probably 
involved in heme transport. We mapped the hABC7 gene to chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3 
by fluorescence in-situ hybridization. As band Xq13 has been implicated in 
X-linked sideroblastic anemia with spinocerebellar ataxia, hABC7 becomes a 
candidate gene for this heritable disorder.
