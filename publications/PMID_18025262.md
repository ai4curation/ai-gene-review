The estrogen receptor (ER), like other members of the nuclear receptor 
superfamily, possesses two separate transcriptional activation functions, AF-1 
and AF-2. Although a variety of coactivators and corepressors of AF-2 have been 
identified, less is known of the mechanism of action of AF-1. We have used the 
yeast two-hybrid system to isolate a cDNA coding for a protein that binds 
specifically to the AF-1 region of human ERalpha. This cDNA codes for the 
transcription factor basal transcription factor 3 (BTF3). The specificity of the 
interaction between BTF3 and ERalpha has been confirmed in vivo and in vitro. 
Transient transfection experiments reveal that overexpression of BTF3 modulates 
the transcriptional response of reporter genes to ERalpha. BTF3 interacts with 
ERalpha that has been activated either by 17beta-estradiol (ligand-dependent 
activation) or by epidermal growth factor (ligand-independent activation). The 
effects of BTF3 on the reporter genes requires the presence of ERalpha 
containing an active AF-1 function. BTF3 may be a component of the mechanism by 
which the AF-1 function of ERalpha stimulates gene transcription.
