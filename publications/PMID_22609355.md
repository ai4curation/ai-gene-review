Microspherule protein 2 (MCRS2) has been reported to associate with the cellular 
function of telomerase inhibition, transcriptional regulation and cellular 
transformation. Here, we report a novel function of MCRS2 in ASK1 pathway. We 
found that MCRS2 directly binds to ASK1 in vivo and co-localises with ASK1 in 
the cytoplasm. Overexpression of MCRS2 inhibited oxidative stress 
(H(2)O(2))-induced ASK1 activation. Knockdown of MCRS2 expression accelerated 
p38 and JNK phosphorylation and promoted apoptosis in response to H(2)O(2). 
Finally, H(2)O(2) treatment induced proteasomal degradation of MCRS2, which was 
further enhanced by activated ASK1. Our results clearly demonstrate that MCRS2 
plays a negative role in stress-induced ASK1 activation.
