Spontaneous aggregation of Aβ is a key factor in the development of Alzheimer's 
disease. In searching for Aβ aggregation inhibitors from traditional Chinese 
herbal medicines, we identified two active compounds from Psoraleae Fructus, 
namely isobavachalcone and bavachinin. We further demonstrated that the two 
compounds modulate Aβ42 aggregation process through different mechanisms. 
Isobavachalcone significantly inhibits both oligomerization and fibrillization 
of Aβ42, whereas bavachinin inhibits fibrillization and leads to off-pathway 
aggregation. Both of the compounds attenuated Aβ42-induced toxicity in a SH-SY5Y 
cell model. These findings may provide valuable information for new drug 
development and Alzheimer's therapy in the future.
