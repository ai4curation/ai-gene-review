Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-mediated liver diseases are one of the major health 
issues in the United States and worldwide. HCV infection has been reported to 
modulate microRNAs (miRNAs) that control various cell surface receptors and 
gene-regulatory complexes involved in hepatic inflammation and liver diseases. 
We report here that specific downregulation of miRNA-107 and miRNA-449a 
following HCV infection in patients with HCV-mediated liver diseases modulates 
expression of CCL2, an inflammatory chemokine upregulated in patients with 
chronic liver diseases, by targeting components of the interleukin-6 receptor 
(IL-6R) complex. Computational analysis for DNA-bound transcription factors in 
the CCL2 promoter identified adjacent binding sites for CCAAT/CEBPα, spleen 
focus-forming virus, proviral integration oncogene (SPI1/PU.1), and STAT3. We 
demonstrate that CEBPα, PU.1, and STAT3 interacted with each other physically to 
cooperatively bind to the promoter and activate CCL2 expression. Analysis of 
IL-6R and JAK1 expression in HCV patients by quantitative PCR showed significant 
upregulation when there was impaired miRNA-107 and miRNA-449a expression, along 
with upregulation of PU.1 and STAT3, but not CEBPα. miRNA-449a and miRNA-107 
target expression of IL-6R and JAK1, respectively, in vitro and also inhibit 
IL-6 signaling and impair STAT3 activation in human hepatocytes. Taken together, 
our results demonstrate a novel gene-regulatory mechanism in which HCV-induced 
changes in miRNAs (miRNA-449a and miRNA-107) regulate CCL2 expression by 
activation of the IL-6-mediated signaling cascade, which we propose will result 
in HCV-mediated induction of inflammatory responses and fibrosis.
IMPORTANCE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced hepatitis is a major health concern 
worldwide. HCV infection results in modulation of noncoding microRNAs affecting 
major cellular pathways, including inflammatory responses. In this study, we 
have identified a microRNA-regulated pathway for the chemokine CCL2 in 
HCV-induced hepatitis. Understanding microRNA-mediated 
transcriptional-regulatory pathways will result in development of noninvasive 
biomarkers for better disease prediction and development of effective 
therapeutics.
