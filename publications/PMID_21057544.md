Inducible acetylation of p53 at lysine residues has a great impact on regulating 
the transactivation of this protein, which is associated with cell growth arrest 
and/or apoptosis under various stress conditions. However, the factor(s) for 
regulating p53 acetylation remains largely unknown. In the current study, we 
have shown that p85α, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, 
has a critical role in mediating p53 acetylation and promoter-specific 
transactivation in the ultraviolet B (UVB) response. Depletion of p85α in mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts significantly impairs UVB-induced apoptosis, as well as 
p53 transactivation and acetylation at Lys370 (Lys373 of human p53); however, 
the accumulation, nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p53 are not 
affected. Interestingly, p85α binds to p300, promotes the p300-p53 interaction 
and the subsequent recruitment of the p53/p300 complex to the promoter region of 
the specific p53 target gene in response to UVB irradiation. Moreover, ablation 
of p53 acetylation at Lys370 by site-directed mutagenesis dramatically 
suppresses UVB-induced expression of the specific p53-responsive gene as well as 
cell apoptosis. Therefore, we conclude that p85α is a novel regulator of 
p53-mediated response under certain stress conditions, and targeting the 
p85α-dependent p53 pathway may be promising for cancer therapy.

Introduction

The transcription factor p53 has been referred to as ‘the guardian of the genome’ and functions as a critical regulator in cell fate determination under genotoxic stresses. p53 is normally present in a latent state and is maintained at low levels by constitutive degradation via the binding of E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as MDM2/HDM2, Pirh2, COP1 or ARF-BP1. Various stress stimuli initiate signaling pathways to increase the protein stability and the transcriptional activity of p53, which subsequently induces the expression of a large number of p53 downstream target genes. Induced activation of p53-dependent signaling events exerts multiple effects including growth arrest and apoptosis, depending on the cell types and the nature of the stimuli ( Levine et al. , 2006 ; Liu and Chen, 2006 ; Olsson et al. , 2007 ; Brooks and Gu, 2008 ; Kruse and Gu, 2009 ).

Posttranslational modifications, including ubiquitination, phosphorylation and acetylation, have critical roles in regulating p53 protein stability and transcriptional activity under various stress conditions ( Haupt et al. , 1997 ; Sakaguchi et al. , 1998 ; Li et al. , 2002 ; Feng et al. , 2005 ; Brooks and Gu, 2008 ; Tang et al. , 2008 ; Eischen and Lozano, 2009 ). The inducible phosphorylation of p53, especially at the N-terminal serine and threonine residues, is assumed to change the conformation of this protein, thereby prevents the p53–MDM2 interaction and consequently disrupts MDM2-dependent degradation and promotes the accumulation of p53 ( Haupt et al. , 1997 ; Kubbutat et al. , 1997 ; Brooks and Gu, 2003 ; Eischen and Lozano, 2009 ; Kruse and Gu, 2009 ). Acetylation of p53 has been identified to occur at several lysine residues within the C-terminal regulatory domain and/or the DNA-binding domain under various stress stimuli, which is carried out by histone acetyl-transferases (HATs), such as p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP), p300/CBP-associated factor and Tip60 ( Gu and Roeder, 1997 ; Liu et al. , 1999 ; Sykes et al. , 2006 ; Tang et al. , 2006 , 2008 ). Under most cases, p300/CBP-mediated p53 acetylation at the lysine residues in the C-terminal domain of p53 has been well studied and is thought to divert this protein from ubiquitination and degradation, and therefore stabilizes p53 ( Li et al. , 2002 ). In addition, acetylation of p53 at these sites also promotes its transcriptional activity by increasing the DNA-binding ability of p53 or facilitates the recruitment of its co-activators (that is, p300) to the promoter regions of p53-responsive genes ( Gu and Roeder, 1997 ; Sakaguchi et al. , 1998 ; Luo et al. , 2004 ). Therefore, C-terminal acetylation of p53 is essential for both the accumulation and the transactivation of p53; although the controversy regarding these outcome of p53 acetylation exists ( Li et al. , 2002 ; Feng et al. , 2005 ; Brooks and Gu, 2008 ; Kruse and Gu, 2009 ). Recent reports by Gu and colleagues have further disclosed that modifications at two additional lysine residues within the DNA-binding domain of p53 can compensate for the acetylation defects in its C-terminus, and thereby, mediate the transactivation of p53 in response to certain stress signals ( Tang et al. , 2006 , 2008 ). These novel discoveries further confirm that p53 acetylation is an indispensable event for mediating the p53 response. However, the regulatory mechanisms involving in this posttranslational modification are still largely unknown ( Kruse and Gu, 2009 ).

p85α is the major regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol- 3-kinase (PI-3K; Geering et al. , 2007 ). In addition to forming a complex with the p110 catalytic subunit and subsequently regulating PI-3K activity, p85α also exists in a monomeric form because of the greater abundance of p85α than p110 in many cell types ( Ueki et al. , 2002a ; Geering et al. , 2007 ). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that p85α may also function independently of PI-3K. In one of our recent studies, we have reported that genetic ablation of the p85 α gene in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) endows these cells with resistance to ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced apoptosis, indicating the specific role of p85α in mediating the UVB-induced cell apoptotic response. Further investigations have also shown that this proapoptotic effect of p85α is unrelated to PI-3K activity and is elicited by the induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α expression ( Song et al. , 2007 ). However, as suppression of TNFα induction by its specific small interfering RNA only modestly attenuates UVB-induced apoptosis in MEFs; therefore, we propose that p85α may exert its proapoptotic effect through other pathways in addition to TNFα induction. In this study, we further reveal a novel function of p85α as an upstream mediator for p300-mediated p53 acetylation at Lys370, which consequently enhances promoter-specific p53 transcriptional activity to mediate the cell apoptotic effect in response to UVB.

Discussion

p85α is a multi-functional protein that serves as the critical mediator in the various physiological processes via PI-3K activity-dependent or -independent mechanisms ( Yin et al. , 1998 ; Ueki et al. , 2002a , b ; Luo et al. , 2005 ; Geering et al. , 2007 ; Manning and Cantley, 2007 ). In our recent report, we have disclosed the novel role of p85α in mediating the apoptotic response under UVB exposure partially through the activation of NFAT3/TNFα pathway in mouse fibroblasts, which events do not involve PI-3K activity ( Song et al. , 2007 ). In the current study, we additionally validated the mechanism of p85α in transmitting the UVB-induced apoptotic response by positively regulating p53 acetylation and transactivation. These data together indicate that coordination of multiple signaling pathways is required for executing the proapoptotic and PI-3K-independent function of p85α under UVB.

Owing to the central role of p53 played in genotoxic and oncogenic stresses, great attention has been focused to elucidate the mechanisms by which p53 protein stability, subcellular localization, posttranslational modification, cofactor binding and transcriptional activity are regulated ( Levine et al. , 2006 ; Liu and Chen, 2006 ; Olsson et al. , 2007 ; Brooks and Gu, 2008 ; Kruse and Gu, 2009 ). Therefore, numerous protein factors have been found to modulate p53 activity, and then the activation of p53 has been demonstrated to link to the regulation of a variety of downstream signaling molecules ( Luo et al. , 2001 ; An et al. , 2004 ; Pedeux et al. , 2005 ; Kim et al. , 2007 ; Sasaki et al. , 2007 ; Cao et al. , 2008 ; Kitagawa et al. , 2008 ; Kurash et al. , 2008 ; Zhao et al. , 2008 ; Pan et al. , 2009 ; Zhu et al. , 2009 ). Data in the current study have shown that p85α has a critical role in mediating p300-dependent p53 acetylation without regulation of p53 stabilization, nuclear translocation and phosphorylation under UVB exposure. Therefore, as the novel and essential upstream regulator of p53, p85α functions to specifically link to the modulation of p53 acetylation, one of the most important posttranslational modifications responsible for p53 activation in the UVB response. In fact, the previous report from Dr Barrett and colleagues has revealed that p85α also participates in the downstream signaling of the p53 pathway to mediate the apoptotic response to hydrogen peroxide, whose effect is also unrelated to the activation status of the PI-3K signal transduction pathway ( Yin et al. , 1998 ). Therefore, these results have extended our understanding of the proapoptotic role of p85α through a PI-3K-independent mechanism under different stress conditions, either by taking part in the regulatory events upstream of the p53 pathway or functioning as the downstream mediator of p53.

p53 represents the first no-histone substrate functionally regulated by acetylation and deacetylation ( Gu and Roeder, 1997 ; Sakaguchi et al. , 1998 ; Luo et al. , 2000 , 2001 ; Vaziri et al. , 2001 ). The levels of p53 acetylation are markedly induced upon various types of stresses, suggesting a major role of this kind of modification for mediating p53 transactivation under stress conditions. However, the precise mechanism by which p53 acetylation and deacetylation are regulated remains largely unknown because of the complex and dynamic changes of the various posttranslational modifications occurring on p53 ( Levine et al. , 2006 ; Brooks and Gu, 2008 ; Kruse and Gu, 2009 ). p300/CBP, p300/CBP-associated factor and Tip60 are well identified HATs responsible for p53 acetylation at the individual lysine residues, and therefore function as the cofactors for p53 transactivation ( Avantaggiati et al. , 1997 ; Lill et al. , 1997 ; Liu et al. , 1999 ; Sykes et al. , 2006 ; Tang et al. , 2006 ). Conversely, the histone deacetylase complex containing histone deacetylase1 or human sirtuin 1 mediates p53 deacetylation and strongly represses p53 transactivation ( Juan et al. , 2000 ; Luo et al. , 2000 , 2001 ; Vaziri et al. , 2001 ). The limited literature regarding the regulation of p53 acetylation or deacetylation only elucidates several protein factors and a small molecule that are involved in enhancing or suppressing p53 transactivity by targeting p300 (that is, Bat3, SOX4, ING2, Skp2) or sirtuin 1 (that is, AROS, DBS, tenovin-6; Pedeux et al. , 2005 ; Kim et al. , 2007 ; Sasaki et al. , 2007 ; Lain et al. , 2008 ; Zhao et al. , 2008 ; Pan et al. , 2009 ; Zhu et al. , 2009 ). Therefore, our results have added a novel member, p85α, to the list of the limited positive regulators of p53 acetylation that can cooperate with p300 to stimulate p53 acetylation under certain stress condition.

During the elucidation of the detailed mechanism by which p85α regulates p53 acetylation and transactivation in the cellular UVB response, we demonstrated that p85α binds to p300 ( Figures 4a and b ), enhances the p53–p300 interaction ( Figures 4c–e ), and subsequently promotes the recruitment of the p53–p300 complex to the p53-RE within the specific p53 target genes ( Figure 5 ) in response to UVB irradiation. In the absence of p85α, p53 is stabilized, phosphorylated, localizes into the nucleus ( Figure 2 ), but fails to be acetylated ( Figure 3 ). Furthermore, the p53–p300 interaction ( Figures 4c–e ) and the promoter-specific binding ability of p53 ( Figure 5 ) are also impaired in p85α-null cells. These lines of evidence suggest that p85α has a critical role in promoter-specific p53 transactivation by facilitating p300-dependent p53 acetylation and enhancing the promoter-specific DNA binding ability of p53 in response to UVB exposure. Interestingly, p85α is also required for the autoacetylation of p53-associated p300 ( Figures 4c–e ), which events may be helpful to upregulate HATs activity of p300 and then increase p53 transcriptional activity by promoting histone acetylation in the vicinity of p53-RE, and therefore altering the chromatin structure for the access of p53.

Although numerous reports have validated the critical role of lysine acetylation in p53 transactivation, a great debate still exists regarding if the occurrence of p53 acetylation regulates DNA-binding ability as well as the protein stability of p53 ( Li et al. , 2002 ; Feng et al. , 2005 ; Sykes et al. , 2006 ; Tang et al. , 2008 ). Data from Dr Okata and colleagues have shown that Bat3-dependent p53 acetylation at Lys373/382 is necessary for the sequence-specific DNA binding and the transactivation of p53; although it is not involved in regulating p53 accumulation in response to DNA damage ( Sasaki et al. , 2007 ). Another group report that p53 acetylation mediated by SOX4, a recently identified regulator of the p53 pathway, affects both the protein stability and the cognate promoter-binding ability of p53 ( Pan et al. , 2009 ). In our experimental system, p85α-dependent p53 acetylation at Lys370 does not affect p53 accumulation induced by UVB ( Figures 3a and 6a, b ); however, it has a critical role in regulating the promoter-specific DNA-binding ability of p53 ( Figure 5 ). Therefore, we propose that the different biological significance resulting from p53 acetylation under various stress conditions may be determined by the upstream regulator(s) involved.

In conclusion, our results have shown that p85α acts as the critical upstream mediator for p300-mediated p53 acetylation and promoter-specific transactivation in the cellular UVB response. As dysregulation of the p300-p53 pathway has been observed in many human cancers ( Goodman and Smolik, 2000 ; Iyer et al. , 2004 ) and the potential tumor suppressor role of p85α has been revealed ( Yin et al. , 1998 ; Miled et al. , 2007 ), it will be promising to evaluate the anticancer strategy by targeting p85α/p300/p53 pathway.
