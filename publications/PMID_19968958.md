Besides their role in the generation of action potentials, voltage-gated 
potassium channels are implicated in cellular processes ranging from cell 
division to cell death. The K(+) channel regulator protein (KCNRG), identified 
as a putative tumor suppressor, reduces K(+) currents through human K(+) 
channels hKv1.1 and hKv1.4 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Current attenuation 
requires the presence of the N-terminal T1 Domain and immunoprecipitation 
experiments suggest association of KCNRG with the N-terminus of the channel. Our 
data indicates that KCNRG is an ER-associated protein, which we propose 
regulates Kv1 family channel proteins by retaining a fraction of channels in 
endomembranes.
