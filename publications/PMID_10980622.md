In haematopoietic malignancies the MLL gene, located on chromosome 11q23, is 
frequently disrupted by chromosome rearrangement, generally resulting in fusion 
to various partner genes. We have previously reported a t(11;15)(q23;q14) in a 
case of acute myeloblastic leukaemia. Here, we report the cloning of a novel MLL 
partner, AF15q14, at chromosome 15q14. In this translocation, the breakpoint 
occurred in exon 8 of MLL and exon 10 of AF15q14. The normal AF15q14 transcripts 
of approximately 8.5 kb in size, are expressed in different tumoral cell lines, 
in a variety of normal tissues, and in all the foetal tissues tested. Sequencing 
of AF15q14 cDNA revealed a putative open reading frame of 1833 amino acids that 
had no homology with any other known protein. The C-terminal end of the putative 
AF15q14 contained a bipartite nuclear localization site. The translocation 
t(11;15) preserved the open reading frame between MLL and the 3' end of AF15q14. 
The contribution of AF15q14 to the fusion protein was only 85 amino acids. 
Immunofluorescence staining experiments with expression vectors encoding these 
85 amino acids confirmed the functionality of the predicted nuclear localization 
site.
