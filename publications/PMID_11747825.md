Evolutionary models of aging propose that a trade-off exists between the 
resources an organism devotes to reproduction and growth and those devoted to 
cellular maintenance and repair, such that an optimal life history always 
entails an imperfect ability to resist stress. Yet, since environmental 
stressors, such as caloric restriction or exposure to mild stress, can increase 
stress resistance and life span, it is possible that a common genetic mechanism 
could regulate the allocation of resources in response to a changing environment 
(for overview, see ). Consistent with predictions of evolutionary trade-off 
models, we show that nematodes carrying an integrated DAF-16::GFP transgene grow 
and reproduce more slowly yet are more stress resistant and longer lived than 
controls carrying the integration marker alone. We also show that the nuclear 
localization of the DAF-16::GFP fusion protein responds to environmental inputs 
as well as genetic. Environmental stresses, such as starvation, heat, and 
oxidative stress, cause rapid nuclear localization of DAF-16. In conditions rich 
in food, we find that DAF-16::GFP is inhibited from entry into the nucleus by 
daf-2 and akt-1/akt-2, both components of insulin-like signaling in nematodes. 
We suggest that changes in the subcellular localization of DAF-16 by 
environmental cues allows for rapid reallocation of resources in response to a 
changing environment at all stages of life.
