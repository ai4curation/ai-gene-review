The late-flowering phenotype of dominant fwa mutants is caused by 
hypomethylation in the FWA locus leading to ectopic expression of a homeodomain 
leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) protein. However, little is known about whether FWA has 
any role in regulation of flowering and how ectopically expressed FWA delays 
flowering. Through analysis of FWA expression in wild-type seedlings, it was 
shown that FWA is not expressed during the vegetative phase. This suggests that 
FWA has no role in flowering. The previous reports that fwa suppressed the 
precocious-flowering phenotype of plants overexpressing FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) 
suggest that the flowering pathway(s) either at and/or downstream of FT is 
blocked by FWA. Comparison of gene expression profiles in three genetic 
backgrounds ectopically expressing FWA and their respective wild types failed to 
detect common changes, ruling out the possibility that FWA acts through 
transcriptional misregulation. Yeast two-hybrid analysis and in vitro pull-down 
assay showed that FWA protein can specifically interact with FT protein. The 
importance of protein interaction with FT in delaying flowering was supported by 
studies involving N-terminal and C-terminal truncations of FWA. The C-terminal 
truncation with abolished interaction did not delay flowering when 
overexpressed, while the N-terminal truncation, which retains interaction, did. 
Specific interaction of FWA with FT enabled us to use FWA protein as a specific 
inhibitor of FT protein function. Through tissue-specific ectopic expression of 
FWA, further support for the shoot apex being the site of action of FT protein 
was provided.
