Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is 
controlled by sequential phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of its 
inhibitory subunit IkappaB. A large multiprotein complex, the IkappaB kinase 
(IKK) signalsome, was purified from HeLa cells and found to contain a 
cytokine-inducible IkappaB kinase activity that phosphorylates IkappaB-alpha and 
IkappaB-beta. Two components of the IKK signalsome, IKK-1 and IKK-2, were 
identified as closely related protein serine kinases containing leucine zipper 
and helix-loop-helix protein interaction motifs. Mutant versions of IKK-2 had 
pronounced effects on RelA nuclear translocation and NF-kappaB-dependent 
reporter activity, consistent with a critical role for the IKK kinases in the 
NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

## Full Text

BackgroundThe innate immune response can be activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through a family of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [1–3], which maintain immune homeostasis. The hyper- or hypoactivation of TLR signaling causes human diseases [4, 5]. TLRs are primarily expressed in macrophages and neutrophils and play a crucial role in modulating the innate immune-inflammatory response and septic outcome. Sepsis is a complex syndrome characterized by infection and systemic inflammatory response, and it is attributed to over 14 million fatalities annually [6]; understanding the molecular switches underlying sepsis is, therefore, a high priority [7, 8].Upon activation of TLRs, the cytoplasmic domains recruit signaling adaptor molecules such as myeloid differential protein-88 (MYD88) and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), which then trigger a cascade of signaling events that lead to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and IκB kinases (IKKs) as well as downstream transcription factors AP-1, NF-κB, and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) [9]. The NF-κB signaling pathway is central to regulating of inflammatory and immune responses. In the canonical NF-κB pathway, proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin (IL)-1β, induce the activation of the canonical IKK complex [10]. The activated IKK complex phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα and thereby promotes its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation [11, 12]. Both positive and negative feedback mechanisms maintain appropriate NF-κB activity during an inflammatory response [13–15].RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5)-mediating protein (RMP) is also known as an unconventional prefoldin RBP5 interactor (URI) [16]. URI/RMP is an important chaperone member of Particle for Arrangement of Quaternary Structure (PAQosome), formerly known as the R2TP/PFDL complex [17]. URI/RMP is involved in essential cellular processes as a functional chaperone, including protein synthesis, gene transcription, and mRNA splicing [18]. RMP was also identified as a downstream effector of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) /ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1) signaling, beyond its chaperone function [19, 20]. In mammalian cells, RMP could be phosphorylated by mTOR to reach the hyperphosphorylated state, an effect induced by insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and blocked by rapamycin [21]. Additionally, RMP may be important for tumor progression in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma [22, 23], prostate cancer [24], and ovarian cancer [25]. For example, RMP increases the transcription of IL-6 by interacting with NF-κB, P65, and RPB5 in liver tumor cells [23], indicating a role for innate inflammatory responses. Here, we identified RMP as an inflammatory regulator and an inhibitor of NF-κB signaling in macrophages through direct interactions with IKKβ and inhibition of IKKβ kinase activity. In vivo, evidence further showed that myeloid-specific deletion of the Rmp gene impaired survival in mice with a dysregulated inflammatory response in an experimental model of sepsis.

The lysed products were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (Microfuge 20R, BECKMAN COULTER) for 15 min at 4 °C to remove precipitates. Primary antibodies used for immunoblot analysis were diluted at 1:1000 with 5% BSA buffer. Immunoblots were performed using specific primary antibodies, followed by a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody, and then detected using an Odyssey fluorescence scanner (Li-Cor). Immunoprecipitation was determined according to the instructions of MAg25K/Protein A/G beads (Enriching Biotechnology LTD).Luciferase reporter gene assayCells (20,000 cells/well) were plated in 300 µL/well in a 48-well plate. The Renilla (pRL-TK) 10 ng, and pNF-κB-luc 200 ng were co-transfected into cells. Cells were lysed by positive lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed employing the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, E1910) after 36 h according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase activities were detected by Single Tube Luminometer LB 9507 (Lumat).RNA extraction and RT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and then reverse-transcribed into cDNA using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). The resulting cDNA was diluted (1:20) for quantitative PCR using SYBR Green SuperMix (Roche) with gene-specific primers. The results were normalized to 18 S control. The sequences of the gene-specific primers involved in this study (forward and reverse, respectively) are as follows:Rmp, 5’-CAAGCAGGCTGTGGGTTTAGT-3’ and 5’-GTGAGCAATTCGTTGTTTTCCTT-3’; Il-6, 5’-TAGTCCTTCCTACCCCAATTTCC-3’ and 5’-TTGGTCCTTAGCCACTCCTTC − 3’; Il-1β, 5’-GCAACTGTTCCTGAACTCAACT-3’and 5’-ATCTTTTGGGGTCCGTCAACT − 3’; Tnfα, 5’-CCCTCACACTCAGATCATCTTCT-3’and 5’-GCTACGACGTGGGCTACAG − 3’; Ifnγ, 5’-TCTGGAGGAACTGGCAAAAG-3’and 5’-AGTGACAGGCTGGGATGG − 3’; Ccl2, 5’-TAAAAACCTGGATCGGAACCAAA-3’and 5’-GCATTAGCTTCAGATTTACGGGT-3’; Ccl5, 5’-GCTGCTTTGCCTACCTCTCC-3’and 5’-TCGAGTGACAAACACGACTGC-3’; Trail, 5’-ATGATGGTGATTTGCATAGTGCT − 3’ and 5’-AGCTGCTTCATCTCGTTGGTG − 3’; 18S, 5’-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA-3’and 5’-GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT-3’.Cytokine measurementThe concentrations of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 in cellular supernatants or serum were measured using ELISA kits (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cellular supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (Microfuge 20R, BECKMAN COULTER) for 5 min to remove precipitates. Standard concentrations of IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6 were prepared by serial dilutions of the peak concentration. 20 µL of each sample was added to 80 µL dilution buffer and transferred to the 96-well plate in the ELISA kit. After incubation and washing, 50 µL TMB One-Step Substrate Reagent was added to each well and incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The absolute absorbance value of each sample was obtained by subtracting the optical density readings at 570 nm from readings at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek).Mass spectrometry of phosphoproteinsRAW264.7 cells were treated with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 30 min. Then, whole cell extracts were collected and lysed to obtain protein samples as described above. After that, each protein sample was incubated with 3 µg anti-RMP antibody and 50 µL MAg25K/Protein A/G beads overnight according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Western blot and Coomassie brilliant blue staining procedures were performed to stain the targeted bands (between 72 and 95 kDa). Further LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Q Exactive Mass Spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) that was coupled to Easy nLC (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 60/120/240 min. The digested peptides were loaded onto a reverse phase trap column (ThermoFisher Scientific, Acclaim PepMap100, 100 μm*2 cm, nanoViper C18) connected to the C18-reversed-phase analytical column (ThermoFisher Scientific Easy Column, 10 cm long, 75 μm inner diameter, 3 μm resin) in buffer A (0.1% Formic acid) and separated with a linear gradient of buffer B (84% acetonitrile and 0.1% Formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min controlled by IntelliFlow technology. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode. MS data were acquired using a data-dependent top10 method. The MS raw data for each sample were combined and searched using the MaxQuant 1.5.3.17 software for further identification and quantitative analysis.Phos-tag SDS-PAGEPhosphorylated proteins were separated using conventional Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, as previously reported [27]. Phos-tag is a functional molecule that can specifically bind phosphate ions. In Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, a separation gel was prepared using acrylamide containing Mn2+ Phos-tag (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. By electrophoresis, phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated proteins can be separated according to their phosphorylation levels. The separation gel can be used for Coomassie blue staining, Western blotting, and mass spectrometry (MS) experiments.LPS-induced lethal septic shockFor the LPS-induced endotoxemia model, male mice (8–12 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich) at a dose of 25 mg/kg. Control animals were administered with an equal amount of saline. Mice grouping was blind to the model maker and data collector. The survival was monitored and recorded for up to 72 h. Mice were grouped and euthanized for determination of inflammatory factors in plasma (6 h), or collection of lung tissues for histological evaluation (24 h), respectively. Mouse blood samples were collected and left to set for at least 10 h without anticoagulants at room temperature, and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm/min for 10 min. Serum samples were used to measure the concentrations of corresponding cytokines using ELISA kits (eBioscience). Littermates of myeloid-specific Rmp-KO and Rmp-WT mice were grouped and tested.Establishment of CLP-induced sepsis and bacterial load measurementMale mice, 8–12 weeks old, were completely anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium (Sigma) according to weight (50 µg/g) by intraperitoneal injection before the surgery. After anesthetized, the central abdominal laparotomy was performed with an incision of 1–1.5 cm. 50% of the cecum was ligated with 4 − 0 silk suture, and one penetrable hole was made at the ligated cecum with a 21-G needle. Sham-operated animals underwent neither ligation nor puncture. Littermates of myeloid-specific Rmp-KO and Rmp-WT mice were grouped and tested. Mice grouping was blind to the model maker and data collector. Mice were resuscitated with 500 µL pre-warmed sterile physiological saline by subcutaneous injection after surgery. All mice had free access to food and water after recovery from anesthesia. Mice were checked for their survival state every 6 h after model construction until the 10th day. Test contents included the presence of heartbeat and mobility. Ascites obtained from tested mice were diluted at 1:1000, and then infiltrated cells in ascites were counted under the microscope by employing a blood cell counting plate. All blood, liver, and lung tissue collection and tissue homogenates were performed using sterile instruments. Serial dilutions were plated onto tryptic soy agar pre-poured petri dishes and incubated aerobically overnight at 37 °C.Flow cytometryPrimary BMDM or peritoneal lavage fluids, and spleen homogenates were prepared at 1 × 107/mL in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes (final volume of 100 µL). After washing with flow cytometry buffer (PBS with 2% FCS, 2 mM EDTA, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), cells were incubated with blocking buffer (5% goat serum in flow cytometry buffer) for 15 min at 4 °C. 0.5 µg/mL propidium iodide was added to each plate to identify and exclude dead cells. Then, cells were stained with the indicated antibody combinations for 30 min at room temperature. The antibodies used for flow cytometry are purchased from eBioscience and listed as follows: live/dead AmCyan, CD45.2-BV605, Cd11c-APC, Cd11b-PE, F4/80-FITC, Ly6C-pacific blue and Ly6G -Pe-Cy7 (all diluted at 1:100). Then, cells were washed twice with Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution/Ca/Mg and then transferred into flow testing tubes (FALCON). Unstained cells and single-stained cells were used as control groups. The cells were gated using forward and side scatters on a BD FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences). Raw FCS files were analyzed with the FlowJo software.Histology and injury evaluation of lungLung tissues were fixed in situ using 4% paraformaldehyde and then paraffin-embedded. Lung Sect. (4 μm thick) were stained with H&E and imaged using the Aperio ImageScope Viewer. Assessment of lung injury was previously described [28]. In brief, lung injury was assessed in four aspects, namely alveolar congestion, edema, cellular infiltrates, and widening of alveolar septa. Each aspect was given a score of 0 to 2 on the scale of severity. As a result, the total score of lung injury ranged from 0 to 8. The evaluation of lung injury was blindly conducted by two independent pathologists.GST pull-down assayThe proteins including GST, GST-mouse RMP-WT, GST-mouse RMP-S439A, and His-mouse IKKβ were constructed and purified by AtaGenix. 5 µg GST fusion proteins plus 50 µL glutathione beads (Boppard) were added to a purified protein of IKKβ in vitro. After incubation with gentle rotation overnight at 4 °C, beads were washed three times with cell lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted with 2 × SDS loading buffer and detected by immunoblot.ADP-Glo kinase assayADP-Glo Kinase kit was purchased from Promega. ADP-Glo Kinase Assay was conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified His-tagged IKKβ (0.5 µg), GST-RMP WT (1 µg) or GST-RMP S439A (1 µg), ATP (25 µM), and protease inhibitors were mixed with 50 µL kinase buffer. Mixtures were added to 96-well plates and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Then, 50 µL of ADP-Glo Reagent was added into each well and incubated for 40 min at room temperature. Subsequently, 100 µL of Kinase Detection Reagent was added to each well. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, samples underwent luminescence detection using a microplate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek).Immunofluorescence stainingRAW264.7 cell was treated with DMSO or LPS (30 min, 3 h). Then, the cells for immunostaining were fixed in 4% methanol-free formaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min and penetrated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min at 4 °C. After rinsing with PBS three times, cells were blocked with 10% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies (RMP, 1:100; IKKβ, 1:100) overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 (1:100) at room temperature for 1 h. After immunostaining, the cells were briefly stained with Hoechst to display the cell nuclei. Finally, images were visualized and photographed using a Leica confocal microscope.Surface plasmon resonance analysisInteractions between the GST-RMP WT, GST-RMP S439A, Flag-PP2Ab, and His-IKKβ proteins were analyzed using the OpenSPR system (Nicoya) at 25 °C. Recombinant His-IKKβ protein was immobilized on a sensor chip (NTA, Nicoya) using an amine coupling kit (Nicoya). Final His-IKKβ immobilized levels were typically ∼ 16,000 RU. Subsequently, GST, GST-RMP WT, GST-RMP S439A, and Flag-PP2Ab were injected as analytes at various concentrations. PBS-P (10 mM phosphate buffer with 2.7 mM KCl and 137 mM NaCl, 0.05% Surfactant P20, pH 4.5) was used as the running buffer. For binding studies, analytes were applied at corresponding concentrations in the running buffer at a flow rate of 20 µL/min with a contact time of 240 s and a dissociation time of 480 s. Chip platforms were washed with the running buffer and 50% DMSO. Data were analyzed with TraceDrawer (Ridgeview Instruments ab, Sweden) by curve fitting using a 1:1 binding model.Statistical analysisAll grouped data were statistically analyzed by GraphPad Prism software (version 7.0) and presented as bar plots in the figures. Data were presented as mean ± SEM. An unpaired Student’s t-test (two-tailed) was used to define the statistical significance between the two groups. One-way ANOVA was used to define the statistical significance in multiple groups of variables with more than three different managements. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated using GraphPad Prism software (version 7.0), and a log-rank test was performed to assess statistical significance. Asterisks presented P values in figures and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Isolation of pMφs and spleen cellsThioglycollate broth (3% in phosphate-buffered saline; Sigma-Aldrich) was steam-sterilized before use. Each mouse was injected intraperitoneally with 2.5 mL of broth. On the third day, mice were euthanized and enriched peritoneal macrophages were obtained by peritoneal lavage using 8 mL phosphate buffer. Peritoneal macrophages were activated by LPS (100 ng/mL) or TNFα (20 ng/mL). Spleen was collected aseptically, immediately after the euthanasia of mice. Then, the spleen was placed on a sterile 60-mesh stainless-steel sieve above a collector tube, perfused with culture medium, teased apart using micro-dissecting scissors, and gently pushed through the sieve using a syringe plunger. The splenic cell suspension was counted under the microscope by employing a blood-counting cell plate.

Establishment of CLP-induced sepsis and bacterial load measurementMale mice, 8–12 weeks old, were completely anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium (Sigma) according to weight (50 µg/g) by intraperitoneal injection before the surgery. After anesthetized, the central abdominal laparotomy was performed with an incision of 1–1.5 cm. 50% of the cecum was ligated with 4 − 0 silk suture, and one penetrable hole was made at the ligated cecum with a 21-G needle. Sham-operated animals underwent neither ligation nor puncture. Littermates of myeloid-specific Rmp-KO and Rmp-WT mice were grouped and tested. Mice grouping was blind to the model maker and data collector. Mice were resuscitated with 500 µL pre-warmed sterile physiological saline by subcutaneous injection after surgery. All mice had free access to food and water after recovery from anesthesia. Mice were checked for their survival state every 6 h after model construction until the 10th day. Test contents included the presence of heartbeat and mobility. Ascites obtained from tested mice were diluted at 1:1000, and then infiltrated cells in ascites were counted under the microscope by employing a blood cell counting plate. All blood, liver, and lung tissue collection and tissue homogenates were performed using sterile instruments. Serial dilutions were plated onto tryptic soy agar pre-poured petri dishes and incubated aerobically overnight at 37 °C.

Male mice, 8–12 weeks old, were completely anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium (Sigma) according to weight (50 µg/g) by intraperitoneal injection before the surgery. After anesthetized, the central abdominal laparotomy was performed with an incision of 1–1.5 cm. 50% of the cecum was ligated with 4 − 0 silk suture, and one penetrable hole was made at the ligated cecum with a 21-G needle. Sham-operated animals underwent neither ligation nor puncture. Littermates of myeloid-specific Rmp-KO and Rmp-WT mice were grouped and tested. Mice grouping was blind to the model maker and data collector. Mice were resuscitated with 500 µL pre-warmed sterile physiological saline by subcutaneous injection after surgery. All mice had free access to food and water after recovery from anesthesia. Mice were checked for their survival state every 6 h after model construction until the 10th day. Test contents included the presence of heartbeat and mobility. Ascites obtained from tested mice were diluted at 1:1000, and then infiltrated cells in ascites were counted under the microscope by employing a blood cell counting plate. All blood, liver, and lung tissue collection and tissue homogenates were performed using sterile instruments. Serial dilutions were plated onto tryptic soy agar pre-poured petri dishes and incubated aerobically overnight at 37 °C.

Flow cytometryPrimary BMDM or peritoneal lavage fluids, and spleen homogenates were prepared at 1 × 107/mL in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes (final volume of 100 µL). After washing with flow cytometry buffer (PBS with 2% FCS, 2 mM EDTA, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), cells were incubated with blocking buffer (5% goat serum in flow cytometry buffer) for 15 min at 4 °C. 0.5 µg/mL propidium iodide was added to each plate to identify and exclude dead cells. Then, cells were stained with the indicated antibody combinations for 30 min at room temperature. The antibodies used for flow cytometry are purchased from eBioscience and listed as follows: live/dead AmCyan, CD45.2-BV605, Cd11c-APC, Cd11b-PE, F4/80-FITC, Ly6C-pacific blue and Ly6G -Pe-Cy7 (all diluted at 1:100). Then, cells were washed twice with Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution/Ca/Mg and then transferred into flow testing tubes (FALCON). Unstained cells and single-stained cells were used as control groups. The cells were gated using forward and side scatters on a BD FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences). Raw FCS files were analyzed with the FlowJo software.

Histology and injury evaluation of lungLung tissues were fixed in situ using 4% paraformaldehyde and then paraffin-embedded. Lung Sect. (4 μm thick) were stained with H&E and imaged using the Aperio ImageScope Viewer. Assessment of lung injury was previously described [28]. In brief, lung injury was assessed in four aspects, namely alveolar congestion, edema, cellular infiltrates, and widening of alveolar septa. Each aspect was given a score of 0 to 2 on the scale of severity. As a result, the total score of lung injury ranged from 0 to 8. The evaluation of lung injury was blindly conducted by two independent pathologists.

ResultsRMP is a negative regulator of LPS-induced NF-κB signaling activationTo determine whether RMP affects innate immune activation of macrophages, we first constructed RAW264.7 cells stably transfected with RMP or GFP (Fig. 1A). When these cells were triggered by LPS, a TLR4 ligand, phosphorylation of IKK, P65, and IκBα was enhanced in GFP-overexpressing cells, compared with RMP-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1B, C). Notably, the most marked disparities manifested within the 15–30 min timeframe, coinciding temporally with the kinetic profile of NF-κB/IKKβ pathway activation. Given that IKK is the vital kinase in the NF-κB signaling pathway, we focused on its inhibition by RMP. NF-κB signaling is pivotal in modulating innate immune responses; thus, we investigated whether RMP affects cytokine production in macrophages under LPS treatment. GFP- and RMP-overexpressing cells were stimulated with LPS for 12 to 24 h and the mRNA and protein expressions of cytokines were assayed. RMP overexpression inhibited the transcription of Il-1β and Tnfα (Fig. 1D), two NF-κB-responsive cytokine genes, under 12 h of LPS treatment. Consistent with these results, the secretion of IL-1β and TNFα decreased in RMP-overexpressing cells, compared with control cells, under LPS treatment (Fig. 1E).

THP-1, a human monocyte cell line, was used to validate the negative regulation of NF-κB signaling by RMP. We constructed a cell line with stable knockdown of RMP (shRMP) and a cell line of RMP overexpressing THP-1 cells (Fig. 1F). The LPS treatment induced strong activation of IKK and P65 in shRMP cells, whereas the phosphorylation of IKK and P65 were much lower in RMP-overexpressing THP-1 cells than in GFP-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1G, H). Then, we performed NF-κB-luc reporter assays in THP-1 cells and found that LPS strongly induced NF-κB-Luciferases(luc) activity and this activity, which was increased in shRMP cells and reduced in RMP-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1I, J). Furthermore, real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that the knockdown of RMP in THP-1 cells enhanced the mRNA abundance of LPS-induced NF-κB-targeting genes, including Il-1β, Il-6, Tnfα, Ccl2, and Ccl5, whereas RMP overexpression decreased them (Fig. 1K, L). Taken together, these results suggested that RMP inhibited TLR-induced NF-κB activation in macrophages.Genetic knockout of Rmp enhances LPS-induced NF-κB signaling in macrophagesTo explore the role of RMP in macrophage activation, floxed Rmp (Rmpf/f) mice were constructed. The loxp sites were knocked into the RMP gene spanning the third exon, which led to a premature stop codon, as previously described [26]. We crossed Rmpf/f mice with the Lysozyme 2-Cre (Lyz2-Cre+) line to create myeloid-specific RMP-knockout (KO) mice (Rmpf/f; Lyz2-Cre+) (Fig. 2A), in which the expression of RMP was abolished in peritoneal macrophages (pMφs) but intact in liver cells (Fig. 2B, C). Relative to their Rmpf/f; Lyz2-Cre− (Rmp-Wild type,Rmp-WT) counterparts, Rmpf/f; Lyz2-Cre+ (Rmp-KO) mice did not exhibit defective developmental phenotypes or differences in body weight, organ weight, hemogram, or blood biochemistry (Fig. S1A-D), as well as the total cell number of leukocytes in the bone marrow or spleen (Fig. S2A). Moreover, flow cytometry analysis revealed that the percentages of monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils from bone marrow or spleen did not differ between myeloid-specific Rmp-KO and -WT mice (Fig. S2B-I), indicating that myeloid-specific Rmp-KO had a limited influence on the maturation and differentiation of mononuclear macrophages.

We then evaluated the activation of IKK and P65 stimulated by LPS in pMφs derived from genetically engineered mice. Rmp-knockout (Rmp-KO) macrophages exhibited much higher IKK and P65 phosphorylation activities than the floxed control (Rmp-WT) cells (Fig. 2D, E). Nevertheless, no alterations were observed in the phosphorylation status of AKT (Ser473), S6 (Ser235/236), JNK (Thr183/185), or ERK1/2 (Ser202/204) within various innate immunity-associated signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR/MAPKs (Fig. S1E). Quantitative analysis revealed that Rmp knockout significantly augmented LPS-induced secretion of these proinflammatory cytokines into the cellular supernatant. (Fig. 2F).Myeloid cell-specific deletion of Rmp promotes susceptibility to lethal LPS shock in miceTo investigate the function of myeloid-derived RMP in the innate immune response in vivo, endotoxin shock was induced by intraperitoneal injection of LPS. After administration of LPS, 40% of Rmp-WT mice survived within 48 h, whereas 80-90% of Rmp-KO mice died during the same period (Fig. 3A). Histopathological analysis revealed more severe lung injury in Rmp-KO mice than in Rmp-WT mice (Fig. 3B, C). Analyses of inflammatory cytokines in serum revealed an exacerbated cytokine storm in Rmp-KO mice. Enhanced LPS toxicity in Rmp-KO mice was correlated with increased serum abundance of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 (Fig. 3D-F). Furthermore, by examining the peritoneal lavage fluid, we found a much higher cell count in Rmp-KO mice than in RMP-WT mice under LPS treatment (Fig. 3G). In addition, the percentage of neutrophils was greater in the Rmp-KO group under LPS treatment, although there was no significant difference in the percentage of macrophages and monocytes (Fig. 3H and Fig. S3A). Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that genetic ablation of Rmp significantly upregulated transcriptional levels of Il-1β, Il-6 and Tnfα in pMφs isolated from lavage fluid of mice subjected to 12-hour LPS challenge (Fig. 3I). Taken together, these results suggested that RMP in myeloid cells was crucial for limiting the hyperactivation of the innate immune response and protecting hosts from lethal LPS shock.

Myeloid cell-specific deletion of Rmp augments mortality in polymicrobial sepsisThe LPS shock model has been extensively employed in mechanistic investigations of sepsis pathogenesis. However, its pathophysiological relevance is fundamentally constrained by its exclusive dependence on LPS/TLR4 signaling pathway activation, representing a sterile inflammatory paradigm. In contrast, the CLP model induces a polymicrobial septic state characterized by substantial intestinal microbiota translocation and subsequent systemic dissemination. This polymicrobial infection model more faithfully recapitulates the complex immunoregulatory mechanisms involving multiple cellular components and signaling pathways observed in clinical human sepsis, particularly those associated with host-pathogen interactions and bacterial toxin-mediated pathogenesis. Thus, to validate whether Rmp disruption in myeloid cells aggravated mortality after sepsis, myeloid-specific Rmp-KO and Rmp-WT mice were placed in a moderate grade of CLP model and the survival was monitored. After CLP treatment, the death of Rmp-KO mice was observed within 1 day. Within 2 days, 50% of Rmp-KO mice died, whereas Rmp-WT mice reached the same mortality rate (50%) on the fourth day. The survival of Rmp-KO mice was shorter compared to Rmp-WT mice (Fig. 4A). Sham surgery caused no death in mice of any genotypes. These data indicate that RMP plays a critical role in myeloid cells in regulating mortality after polymicrobial sepsis. The lethality in sepsis is associated with the failure of vital organs. Therefore, we next examined histopathological differences between Rmp-KO and Rmp-WT mice and showed that lung injury was more severe in Rmp-KO mice (Fig. 4B, C).

Next, we collected peritoneal lavage fluid, blood samples, and liver and lung homogenates from the sham-operated, CLP Rmp-KO, and CLP Rmp-WT groups. Microflora was cultured on agarose plates and there was no obvious colony formation from the sham-operated mice, whereas the colony numbers from CLP-treated Rmp-KO mice were much higher than those from CLP-treated Rmp-WT mice (Fig. 4D-G). ELISA analysis showed that the serum abundance of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 was greater in Rmp-KO mice than in Rmp-WT mice 24 h after CLP (Fig. 4H-J). Similarly to the LPS-induced endotoxin shock model, the number of cells and the percentage of macrophages in the peritoneal lavage fluid of Rmp-KO mice increased after 24 h of CLP, whereas the percentages of neutrophils and monocytes were not significantly different (Fig. 4K, L and Fig. S3B). Collectively, these results indicate that RMP in myeloid cells protected hosts from CLP-induced sepsis.Inflammatory stimulation induces RMP phosphorylation in macrophagesTo understand the cellular mechanisms by which RMP mediates LPS-induced NF-κB activation, we analyzed the expressions of RMP protein and mRNA after initial LPS treatment in RAW264.7 cell lines. The results showed a rapid downregulation of RMP protein after LPS stimulation for 3 to 24 h (Fig. 5A). RT-PCR analysis further showed that the Rmp mRNA expression reduced after 24 h of LPS treatment (Fig. 5B). The LPS-induced reduction of RMP suggested its role as a regulator of TLR4 signaling.

When endogenous RMP protein was detected in RAW264.7 cells, an upward band shift was observed after 15 to 60 min of stimulation with LPS (Fig. 5C). However, neither protein stability nor the transcriptional expressions of RMP were altered in LPS-treated macrophages within a short period (Fig. S4A-D). It has also been demonstrated that RMP can be hyperphosphorylated by mTOR and S6K1, and this hyperphosphorylation is efficiently blocked by rapamycin [21]. We postulated that this upward band shift may be a phosphorylation modification of the RMP protein. As expected, the slowly upshifting bands of RMP were sensitive to treatment with γPPase(Fig. 5D), representing it as one or more phosphorylated forms of RMP. To identify the exact phosphorylation site, we performed phosphorylation mass spectrometry identification of immunoprecipitation products from LPS-triggered macrophages and revealed that RMP was phosphorylated at Ser439 (Fig. 5E and Fig. S4E).Then, we pretreated cells with several signaling pathway inhibitors, including rapamycin, and then stimulated these cells with LPS. We found that SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), SCH772984 (ERK inhibitor), BAY (P65 inhibitor), and rapamycin, did not abrogate LPS-induced phosphorylation of RMP (Fig. S4F-I). However, treatment with the IKK inhibitors IKK-16 and TPCA-1 slowed the upward migration of RMP bands (Fig. 5F, G), a phenomenon that was consistently recapitulated in primary peritoneal macrophages under identical experimental conditions (Fig. S4L). In addition, activation by other ligands of TLRs, including Resiquimod (TLR7/8) and Pam3csk4 (TLR1/2), caused a similar upward band shift of RMP in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. S4J, K). Together, these data suggested that RMP may participate in inflammatory stimulation and serve as a downstream substrate of IKK kinase.IKKβ physically associates with and phosphorylates RMPTo determine the molecular mechanisms by which RMP negatively regulates NF-κB signaling, we detected whether RMP directly interacts with the IKK complex and P65 protein, as we found that IKK may phosphorylate RMP at Ser439. We transfected IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ, and P65 plasmids into HEK-293T cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with specific antibodies. Overexpressed RMP could interact with all these proteins, whereas IKKβ showed the strongest interaction with RMP protein (Fig. S5A, B). The same result was also observed in RAW264.7 macrophages by endogenous co-immunoprecipitation assays, in which RMP interacted with IKKβ (Fig. 6A, B). To determine whether IKKβ directly binds to RMP, a GST pull-down assay was performed in vitro, which showed that purified GST-tagged RMP pulled down IKKβ protein (Fig. 6C). Given that IKKβ binds to RMP and may phosphorylate RMP at Ser439 in response to LPS stimulation, we constructed and purified the GST-tagged RMP S439A mutant protein for the GST-pulldown assay. Compared to its wild type, RMP S439A pulled down more IKKβ protein (Fig. 6D), suggesting that phosphorylation of the RMP Ser439 site affects its binding to IKKβ. Moreover, we constructed constitutively active IKKβ-SSEE, in which the Ser177 and Ser181 sites were replaced by glutamic acids [12, 29]. The co-transfection of plasmids and immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in HEK-293T cells. Compared to RMP-WT, the RMP-S439A mutant immunoprecipitated more IKKβ-WT protein. Likewise, compared to active IKKβ-SSEE mutant, the IKKβ-WT immunoprecipitated more RMP-WT protein (Fig. S5C).

We further explored the association between RMP and IKKβ under LPS stimulation, since LPS could induce the phosphorylation of RMP and IKKβ. LPS stimulation attenuated the interaction between IKKβ and RMP in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 6E, F), and similar results were also observed in HEK-293T cells co-transfected with RMP, IKKβ, and TLR4 plasmids (Fig. S5D, E), suggesting that RMP separated from the IKK complex after LPS stimulation. These results were verified by immunofluorescence staining assays (Fig. S5F). The association between RMP and IKKβ partially recovered after LPS stimulation (Fig. S5F, G), suggesting a dynamic change in the RMP phosphorylation state may affect their association.Human RMP protein can be phosphorylated at Ser372, Ser442, and Thr373 sites by mTOR and S6K1 [20, 30]. Since the amino acid sequences of mouse RMP and human RMP are partially different, the Ser372 and Ser442 sites of human RMP correspond to the Ser369 and Ser439 sites of mouse RMP, whereas the Thr373 site of human RMP has no counterpart on the mouse RMP protein. To confirm which site of RMP is indispensable for regulating NF-κB signaling, mouse RMP S369A, S439A, and human RMP S372A plasmids were constructed. Their binding properties with IKKβ and function in regulating NF-κB signaling were tested. Increased binding to IKKβ was only observed in the immunoprecipitates of mouse RMP S439A (Fig. S6A). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the effect of mouse RMP WT and S369A mutants on LPS-induced IKKβ/NF-κB signaling, whereas mouse RMP S439A mutant reversed the effects of mouse RMP WT (Fig. S6B). Furthermore, inhibition of mTOR signaling also did not affect the binding of RMP to IKKβ (Fig. S6C). Next, we explored whether phosphorylation of RMP altered the downstream signaling of IKK. NF-κB-luc reporter assays revealed that RMP-WT decreased NF-κB signaling which was counteracted by the mouse RMP-S439A mutant (Fig. 6G). These results suggested that RMP inhibited NF-κB signaling through its phosphorylation at the Ser439 site.To determine whether IKKβ can directly phosphorylate the RMP protein, we performed in vitro ADP-Glo kinase assays in which control GST, GST-RMP-WT, and GST-RMP-S439A proteins were incubated with active IKKβ in an ADP-Glo kinase assay. The luminescence signal was positively correlated with the amount of ADP converted from ATP in the kinase reaction. We found that the RMP-WT protein increased the luminescence signal, whereas the S439A mutant did not (Fig. 6H). Moreover, the products of kinase assays were analyzed by Phospho-tag SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, in which the phosphorylated proteins were trapped by metal ions, separating them from their non-phosphorylated homologs. Immunoblotting showed that the RMP-WT protein could be phosphorylated by IKKβ kinase assay, whereas the RMP-S439A mutant was less responsive to this treatment (Fig. 6I). In addition, we observed that RMP did not affect the interaction of IKK subunits in co-immunoprecipitation assays, but inhibited the IKK activity in immunoprecipitation kinase assays, indicating RMP affected the activation of IKK complex rather than the formation (Fig. S6D, E). Taken together, IKKβ acted as an RMP kinase that phosphorylated RMP at the Ser439 site, and this phosphorylation was a negative feedback mechanism of IKKβ signaling.The C-terminal region of RMP binds to the kinase domain of IKKβTo identify the structural domain of the protein responsible for the interaction between RMP and IKKβ, truncations of mouse RMP were constructed according to the functional domains (Fig. 7A). We co-transfected IKKβ with various RMP truncations into HEK-293T cells and then performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The results showed that RMP-FL (1-531 aa), RMP-D3 (287–531 aa), and RMP-D5 (162–531 aa) interacted with IKKβ, whereas the N-terminal regions RMP-D1 (1-161 aa), RMP-D2 (162–286 aa), and RMP-D4 (1-286 aa) failed (Fig. 7B, C), suggesting that the C-terminal region of RMP is required for binding to IKKβ. The C-terminal truncations RMP-D3 (287–531 aa) and RMP-D5 (162–531 aa) both contain a Ser439 site targeted by active IKKβ, raising the possibility that RMP Ser439 site is vital for binding to IKKβ.

To further explore the mechanisms by which the RMP structural domain containing the Ser439 site binds to IKKβ, and based on the assumption that the kinase structural domain of IKKβ may be responsible for this interaction, we constructed several IKKβ truncations containing a kinase domain (KD), leucine-zipper (LZ) domain, or helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain (Fig. 7D). RMP interacted with the kinase domain of IKKβ (IKKβ-KD) but not with the IKKβ-HLH or IKKβ-LZ domain (Fig. 7E, F). We co-transfected RMP-D3 (287–531 aa) and the IKKβ-KD domain into HEK-293T cells and confirmed the interaction between the two regions (Fig. 7G, H). Together, these data verified that the C-terminal region of RMP binds to the kinase domain of IKKβ.Inhibition of LPS-induced activation of IKKβ requires the RMP/PP2A complexThe above data revealed that RMP acts as a downstream substrate of IKK kinase and attenuates LPS-induced inflammation. Next, we sought to investigate the mechanism by which RMP inhibits IKKβ phosphorylation. It has been reported that IKKβ can form signaling complexes with PP1γ and/or PP2A in response to TNFR/TLR activation, and these protein serine/threonine phosphatases negatively regulate NF-κB signaling through the dephosphorylation of IKKβ [31, 32]. Similarly, RMP also interacts with PP1γ and/or PP2A and is involved in their functional regulation [20, 24]. We speculated that RMP may act as a mediator of IKKβ inactivation by recruiting members of protein phosphatase. Indeed, we identified that PP2Ab, but not PP2Aa, PP2Ac, or PP1γ, could be precipitated by RMP and IKKβ antibodies in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 8A), indicating that RMP, IKKβ, and PP2Ab form a complex and that the PP2A holoenzyme may be involved in RMP-mediated inactivation of IKKβ. Then we discovered that RMP overexpression strengthened the interaction between IKKβ and PP2Ab (Fig. 8B-E), indicating that RMP promoted the formation of the IKK-PP2A complex. To verify that the PP2A holoenzyme dephosphorylates IKKβ and affects NF-κB signaling, we treated THP-1 cells with a PP2A inhibitor or overexpressed PP2Ab in THP-1 cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that under LPS treatment, PP2A inhibitor increased IKKβ phosphorylation and decreased the binding of IKKβ to RMP (Fig. S7A, B). Together, these data suggested that PP2A inhibited the phosphorylation of IKK and promoted the interaction between IKKβ and RMP.

To further probe whether PP2A was responsible for the RMP-mediated inhibition of IKKβ and NF-κB signaling, NF-κB-luc reporter gene assays and immunoblotting were performed in THP-1 cells. Consequently, the PP2A inhibitor restored the inhibitory effect of RMP overexpression on IKK/NF-κB signaling under LPS treatment (Fig. 8F, G). Similarly, under LPS treatment, PP2Ab overexpression could limit the excessive activation of IKK/NF-κB signaling (Fig. 8F, H). In conclusion, these results indicated a potential mechanism for RMP-induced IKK inactivation and suggested that RMP recruits the protein phosphatase PP2A to form the IKK-RMP-PP2A complex, which maintains IKK in its default inactive state in macrophages.To directly confirm the association between IKKβ, RMP, and PP2Ab proteins, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was employed to detect the binding characteristics and affinity constants between IKKβ, PP2Ab, and RMP WT or RMP S439A. RMP could bind to IKKβ in vitro and RMP mutation at the Ser439 site enhanced their binding (Fig. 8I and Fig. S7C, D), consistent with results of co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pulldown assay. Moreover, PP2Ab, RMP, and IKKβ potentially bound to each other in vitro to form a complex (Fig. 8J and Fig. S7E-G).Collectively, we proposed a model that IKKβ, RMP, and PP2Ab could form a complex in macrophages based on our in vivo and in vitro data. In the resting state, RMP would be associated with IKKβ and recruit PP2A to maintain IKKβ in an unphosphorylated inactive state. Treatment with LPS led to RMP phosphorylation at the Ser439 site by IKKβ and the release of both RMP and PP2A from the complex, permitting phosphorylated IKK complex to activate IκB, leading to the degradation of IκB and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB (Fig. 8K).

RMP is a negative regulator of LPS-induced NF-κB signaling activationTo determine whether RMP affects innate immune activation of macrophages, we first constructed RAW264.7 cells stably transfected with RMP or GFP (Fig. 1A). When these cells were triggered by LPS, a TLR4 ligand, phosphorylation of IKK, P65, and IκBα was enhanced in GFP-overexpressing cells, compared with RMP-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1B, C). Notably, the most marked disparities manifested within the 15–30 min timeframe, coinciding temporally with the kinetic profile of NF-κB/IKKβ pathway activation. Given that IKK is the vital kinase in the NF-κB signaling pathway, we focused on its inhibition by RMP. NF-κB signaling is pivotal in modulating innate immune responses; thus, we investigated whether RMP affects cytokine production in macrophages under LPS treatment. GFP- and RMP-overexpressing cells were stimulated with LPS for 12 to 24 h and the mRNA and protein expressions of cytokines were assayed. RMP overexpression inhibited the transcription of Il-1β and Tnfα (Fig. 1D), two NF-κB-responsive cytokine genes, under 12 h of LPS treatment. Consistent with these results, the secretion of IL-1β and TNFα decreased in RMP-overexpressing cells, compared with control cells, under LPS treatment (Fig. 1E).

THP-1, a human monocyte cell line, was used to validate the negative regulation of NF-κB signaling by RMP. We constructed a cell line with stable knockdown of RMP (shRMP) and a cell line of RMP overexpressing THP-1 cells (Fig. 1F). The LPS treatment induced strong activation of IKK and P65 in shRMP cells, whereas the phosphorylation of IKK and P65 were much lower in RMP-overexpressing THP-1 cells than in GFP-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1G, H). Then, we performed NF-κB-luc reporter assays in THP-1 cells and found that LPS strongly induced NF-κB-Luciferases(luc) activity and this activity, which was increased in shRMP cells and reduced in RMP-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1I, J). Furthermore, real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that the knockdown of RMP in THP-1 cells enhanced the mRNA abundance of LPS-induced NF-κB-targeting genes, including Il-1β, Il-6, Tnfα, Ccl2, and Ccl5, whereas RMP overexpression decreased them (Fig. 1K, L). Taken together, these results suggested that RMP inhibited TLR-induced NF-κB activation in macrophages.

The LPS treatment induced strong activation of IKK and P65 in shRMP cells, whereas the phosphorylation of IKK and P65 were much lower in RMP-overexpressing THP-1 cells than in GFP-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1G, H). Then, we performed NF-κB-luc reporter assays in THP-1 cells and found that LPS strongly induced NF-κB-Luciferases(luc) activity and this activity, which was increased in shRMP cells and reduced in RMP-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1I, J). Furthermore, real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that the knockdown of RMP in THP-1 cells enhanced the mRNA abundance of LPS-induced NF-κB-targeting genes, including Il-1β, Il-6, Tnfα, Ccl2, and Ccl5, whereas RMP overexpression decreased them (Fig. 1K, L). Taken together, these results suggested that RMP inhibited TLR-induced NF-κB activation in macrophages.

Genetic knockout of Rmp enhances LPS-induced NF-κB signaling in macrophagesTo explore the role of RMP in macrophage activation, floxed Rmp (Rmpf/f) mice were constructed. The loxp sites were knocked into the RMP gene spanning the third exon, which led to a premature stop codon, as previously described [26]. We crossed Rmpf/f mice with the Lysozyme 2-Cre (Lyz2-Cre+) line to create myeloid-specific RMP-knockout (KO) mice (Rmpf/f; Lyz2-Cre+) (Fig. 2A), in which the expression of RMP was abolished in peritoneal macrophages (pMφs) but intact in liver cells (Fig. 2B, C). Relative to their Rmpf/f; Lyz2-Cre− (Rmp-Wild type,Rmp-WT) counterparts, Rmpf/f; Lyz2-Cre+ (Rmp-KO) mice did not exhibit defective developmental phenotypes or differences in body weight, organ weight, hemogram, or blood biochemistry (Fig. S1A-D), as well as the total cell number of leukocytes in the bone marrow or spleen (Fig. S2A). Moreover, flow cytometry analysis revealed that the percentages of monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils from bone marrow or spleen did not differ between myeloid-specific Rmp-KO and -WT mice (Fig. S2B-I), indicating that myeloid-specific Rmp-KO had a limited influence on the maturation and differentiation of mononuclear macrophages.

We then evaluated the activation of IKK and P65 stimulated by LPS in pMφs derived from genetically engineered mice. Rmp-knockout (Rmp-KO) macrophages exhibited much higher IKK and P65 phosphorylation activities than the floxed control (Rmp-WT) cells (Fig. 2D, E). Nevertheless, no alterations were observed in the phosphorylation status of AKT (Ser473), S6 (Ser235/236), JNK (Thr183/185), or ERK1/2 (Ser202/204) within various innate immunity-associated signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR/MAPKs (Fig. S1E). Quantitative analysis revealed that Rmp knockout significantly augmented LPS-induced secretion of these proinflammatory cytokines into the cellular supernatant. (Fig. 2F).

Myeloid cell-specific deletion of Rmp promotes susceptibility to lethal LPS shock in miceTo investigate the function of myeloid-derived RMP in the innate immune response in vivo, endotoxin shock was induced by intraperitoneal injection of LPS. After administration of LPS, 40% of Rmp-WT mice survived within 48 h, whereas 80-90% of Rmp-KO mice died during the same period (Fig. 3A). Histopathological analysis revealed more severe lung injury in Rmp-KO mice than in Rmp-WT mice (Fig. 3B, C). Analyses of inflammatory cytokines in serum revealed an exacerbated cytokine storm in Rmp-KO mice. Enhanced LPS toxicity in Rmp-KO mice was correlated with increased serum abundance of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 (Fig. 3D-F). Furthermore, by examining the peritoneal lavage fluid, we found a much higher cell count in Rmp-KO mice than in RMP-WT mice under LPS treatment (Fig. 3G). In addition, the percentage of neutrophils was greater in the Rmp-KO group under LPS treatment, although there was no significant difference in the percentage of macrophages and monocytes (Fig. 3H and Fig. S3A). Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that genetic ablation of Rmp significantly upregulated transcriptional levels of Il-1β, Il-6 and Tnfα in pMφs isolated from lavage fluid of mice subjected to 12-hour LPS challenge (Fig. 3I). Taken together, these results suggested that RMP in myeloid cells was crucial for limiting the hyperactivation of the innate immune response and protecting hosts from lethal LPS shock.

Myeloid cell-specific deletion of Rmp augments mortality in polymicrobial sepsisThe LPS shock model has been extensively employed in mechanistic investigations of sepsis pathogenesis. However, its pathophysiological relevance is fundamentally constrained by its exclusive dependence on LPS/TLR4 signaling pathway activation, representing a sterile inflammatory paradigm. In contrast, the CLP model induces a polymicrobial septic state characterized by substantial intestinal microbiota translocation and subsequent systemic dissemination. This polymicrobial infection model more faithfully recapitulates the complex immunoregulatory mechanisms involving multiple cellular components and signaling pathways observed in clinical human sepsis, particularly those associated with host-pathogen interactions and bacterial toxin-mediated pathogenesis. Thus, to validate whether Rmp disruption in myeloid cells aggravated mortality after sepsis, myeloid-specific Rmp-KO and Rmp-WT mice were placed in a moderate grade of CLP model and the survival was monitored. After CLP treatment, the death of Rmp-KO mice was observed within 1 day. Within 2 days, 50% of Rmp-KO mice died, whereas Rmp-WT mice reached the same mortality rate (50%) on the fourth day. The survival of Rmp-KO mice was shorter compared to Rmp-WT mice (Fig. 4A). Sham surgery caused no death in mice of any genotypes. These data indicate that RMP plays a critical role in myeloid cells in regulating mortality after polymicrobial sepsis. The lethality in sepsis is associated with the failure of vital organs. Therefore, we next examined histopathological differences between Rmp-KO and Rmp-WT mice and showed that lung injury was more severe in Rmp-KO mice (Fig. 4B, C).

Next, we collected peritoneal lavage fluid, blood samples, and liver and lung homogenates from the sham-operated, CLP Rmp-KO, and CLP Rmp-WT groups. Microflora was cultured on agarose plates and there was no obvious colony formation from the sham-operated mice, whereas the colony numbers from CLP-treated Rmp-KO mice were much higher than those from CLP-treated Rmp-WT mice (Fig. 4D-G). ELISA analysis showed that the serum abundance of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 was greater in Rmp-KO mice than in Rmp-WT mice 24 h after CLP (Fig. 4H-J). Similarly to the LPS-induced endotoxin shock model, the number of cells and the percentage of macrophages in the peritoneal lavage fluid of Rmp-KO mice increased after 24 h of CLP, whereas the percentages of neutrophils and monocytes were not significantly different (Fig. 4K, L and Fig. S3B). Collectively, these results indicate that RMP in myeloid cells protected hosts from CLP-induced sepsis.

Next, we collected peritoneal lavage fluid, blood samples, and liver and lung homogenates from the sham-operated, CLP Rmp-KO, and CLP Rmp-WT groups. Microflora was cultured on agarose plates and there was no obvious colony formation from the sham-operated mice, whereas the colony numbers from CLP-treated Rmp-KO mice were much higher than those from CLP-treated Rmp-WT mice (Fig. 4D-G). ELISA analysis showed that the serum abundance of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 was greater in Rmp-KO mice than in Rmp-WT mice 24 h after CLP (Fig. 4H-J). Similarly to the LPS-induced endotoxin shock model, the number of cells and the percentage of macrophages in the peritoneal lavage fluid of Rmp-KO mice increased after 24 h of CLP, whereas the percentages of neutrophils and monocytes were not significantly different (Fig. 4K, L and Fig. S3B). Collectively, these results indicate that RMP in myeloid cells protected hosts from CLP-induced sepsis.

Inflammatory stimulation induces RMP phosphorylation in macrophagesTo understand the cellular mechanisms by which RMP mediates LPS-induced NF-κB activation, we analyzed the expressions of RMP protein and mRNA after initial LPS treatment in RAW264.7 cell lines. The results showed a rapid downregulation of RMP protein after LPS stimulation for 3 to 24 h (Fig. 5A). RT-PCR analysis further showed that the Rmp mRNA expression reduced after 24 h of LPS treatment (Fig. 5B). The LPS-induced reduction of RMP suggested its role as a regulator of TLR4 signaling.

When endogenous RMP protein was detected in RAW264.7 cells, an upward band shift was observed after 15 to 60 min of stimulation with LPS (Fig. 5C). However, neither protein stability nor the transcriptional expressions of RMP were altered in LPS-treated macrophages within a short period (Fig. S4A-D). It has also been demonstrated that RMP can be hyperphosphorylated by mTOR and S6K1, and this hyperphosphorylation is efficiently blocked by rapamycin [21]. We postulated that this upward band shift may be a phosphorylation modification of the RMP protein. As expected, the slowly upshifting bands of RMP were sensitive to treatment with γPPase(Fig. 5D), representing it as one or more phosphorylated forms of RMP. To identify the exact phosphorylation site, we performed phosphorylation mass spectrometry identification of immunoprecipitation products from LPS-triggered macrophages and revealed that RMP was phosphorylated at Ser439 (Fig. 5E and Fig. S4E).Then, we pretreated cells with several signaling pathway inhibitors, including rapamycin, and then stimulated these cells with LPS. We found that SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), SCH772984 (ERK inhibitor), BAY (P65 inhibitor), and rapamycin, did not abrogate LPS-induced phosphorylation of RMP (Fig. S4F-I). However, treatment with the IKK inhibitors IKK-16 and TPCA-1 slowed the upward migration of RMP bands (Fig. 5F, G), a phenomenon that was consistently recapitulated in primary peritoneal macrophages under identical experimental conditions (Fig. S4L). In addition, activation by other ligands of TLRs, including Resiquimod (TLR7/8) and Pam3csk4 (TLR1/2), caused a similar upward band shift of RMP in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. S4J, K). Together, these data suggested that RMP may participate in inflammatory stimulation and serve as a downstream substrate of IKK kinase.

Inflammatory stimulation induces RMP phosphorylation in macrophages

To understand the cellular mechanisms by which RMP mediates LPS-induced NF-κB activation, we analyzed the expressions of RMP protein and mRNA after initial LPS treatment in RAW264.7 cell lines. The results showed a rapid downregulation of RMP protein after LPS stimulation for 3 to 24 h (Fig. 5A). RT-PCR analysis further showed that the Rmp mRNA expression reduced after 24 h of LPS treatment (Fig. 5B). The LPS-induced reduction of RMP suggested its role as a regulator of TLR4 signaling.

When endogenous RMP protein was detected in RAW264.7 cells, an upward band shift was observed after 15 to 60 min of stimulation with LPS (Fig. 5C). However, neither protein stability nor the transcriptional expressions of RMP were altered in LPS-treated macrophages within a short period (Fig. S4A-D). It has also been demonstrated that RMP can be hyperphosphorylated by mTOR and S6K1, and this hyperphosphorylation is efficiently blocked by rapamycin [21]. We postulated that this upward band shift may be a phosphorylation modification of the RMP protein. As expected, the slowly upshifting bands of RMP were sensitive to treatment with γPPase(Fig. 5D), representing it as one or more phosphorylated forms of RMP. To identify the exact phosphorylation site, we performed phosphorylation mass spectrometry identification of immunoprecipitation products from LPS-triggered macrophages and revealed that RMP was phosphorylated at Ser439 (Fig. 5E and Fig. S4E).

Then, we pretreated cells with several signaling pathway inhibitors, including rapamycin, and then stimulated these cells with LPS. We found that SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), SCH772984 (ERK inhibitor), BAY (P65 inhibitor), and rapamycin, did not abrogate LPS-induced phosphorylation of RMP (Fig. S4F-I). However, treatment with the IKK inhibitors IKK-16 and TPCA-1 slowed the upward migration of RMP bands (Fig. 5F, G), a phenomenon that was consistently recapitulated in primary peritoneal macrophages under identical experimental conditions (Fig. S4L). In addition, activation by other ligands of TLRs, including Resiquimod (TLR7/8) and Pam3csk4 (TLR1/2), caused a similar upward band shift of RMP in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. S4J, K). Together, these data suggested that RMP may participate in inflammatory stimulation and serve as a downstream substrate of IKK kinase.

IKKβ physically associates with and phosphorylates RMPTo determine the molecular mechanisms by which RMP negatively regulates NF-κB signaling, we detected whether RMP directly interacts with the IKK complex and P65 protein, as we found that IKK may phosphorylate RMP at Ser439. We transfected IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ, and P65 plasmids into HEK-293T cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with specific antibodies. Overexpressed RMP could interact with all these proteins, whereas IKKβ showed the strongest interaction with RMP protein (Fig. S5A, B). The same result was also observed in RAW264.7 macrophages by endogenous co-immunoprecipitation assays, in which RMP interacted with IKKβ (Fig. 6A, B). To determine whether IKKβ directly binds to RMP, a GST pull-down assay was performed in vitro, which showed that purified GST-tagged RMP pulled down IKKβ protein (Fig. 6C). Given that IKKβ binds to RMP and may phosphorylate RMP at Ser439 in response to LPS stimulation, we constructed and purified the GST-tagged RMP S439A mutant protein for the GST-pulldown assay. Compared to its wild type, RMP S439A pulled down more IKKβ protein (Fig. 6D), suggesting that phosphorylation of the RMP Ser439 site affects its binding to IKKβ. Moreover, we constructed constitutively active IKKβ-SSEE, in which the Ser177 and Ser181 sites were replaced by glutamic acids [12, 29]. The co-transfection of plasmids and immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in HEK-293T cells. Compared to RMP-WT, the RMP-S439A mutant immunoprecipitated more IKKβ-WT protein. Likewise, compared to active IKKβ-SSEE mutant, the IKKβ-WT immunoprecipitated more RMP-WT protein (Fig. S5C).

We further explored the association between RMP and IKKβ under LPS stimulation, since LPS could induce the phosphorylation of RMP and IKKβ. LPS stimulation attenuated the interaction between IKKβ and RMP in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 6E, F), and similar results were also observed in HEK-293T cells co-transfected with RMP, IKKβ, and TLR4 plasmids (Fig. S5D, E), suggesting that RMP separated from the IKK complex after LPS stimulation. These results were verified by immunofluorescence staining assays (Fig. S5F). The association between RMP and IKKβ partially recovered after LPS stimulation (Fig. S5F, G), suggesting a dynamic change in the RMP phosphorylation state may affect their association.Human RMP protein can be phosphorylated at Ser372, Ser442, and Thr373 sites by mTOR and S6K1 [20, 30]. Since the amino acid sequences of mouse RMP and human RMP are partially different, the Ser372 and Ser442 sites of human RMP correspond to the Ser369 and Ser439 sites of mouse RMP, whereas the Thr373 site of human RMP has no counterpart on the mouse RMP protein. To confirm which site of RMP is indispensable for regulating NF-κB signaling, mouse RMP S369A, S439A, and human RMP S372A plasmids were constructed. Their binding properties with IKKβ and function in regulating NF-κB signaling were tested. Increased binding to IKKβ was only observed in the immunoprecipitates of mouse RMP S439A (Fig. S6A). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the effect of mouse RMP WT and S369A mutants on LPS-induced IKKβ/NF-κB signaling, whereas mouse RMP S439A mutant reversed the effects of mouse RMP WT (Fig. S6B). Furthermore, inhibition of mTOR signaling also did not affect the binding of RMP to IKKβ (Fig. S6C). Next, we explored whether phosphorylation of RMP altered the downstream signaling of IKK. NF-κB-luc reporter assays revealed that RMP-WT decreased NF-κB signaling which was counteracted by the mouse RMP-S439A mutant (Fig. 6G). These results suggested that RMP inhibited NF-κB signaling through its phosphorylation at the Ser439 site.To determine whether IKKβ can directly phosphorylate the RMP protein, we performed in vitro ADP-Glo kinase assays in which control GST, GST-RMP-WT, and GST-RMP-S439A proteins were incubated with active IKKβ in an ADP-Glo kinase assay. The luminescence signal was positively correlated with the amount of ADP converted from ATP in the kinase reaction. We found that the RMP-WT protein increased the luminescence signal, whereas the S439A mutant did not (Fig. 6H). Moreover, the products of kinase assays were analyzed by Phospho-tag SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, in which the phosphorylated proteins were trapped by metal ions, separating them from their non-phosphorylated homologs. Immunoblotting showed that the RMP-WT protein could be phosphorylated by IKKβ kinase assay, whereas the RMP-S439A mutant was less responsive to this treatment (Fig. 6I). In addition, we observed that RMP did not affect the interaction of IKK subunits in co-immunoprecipitation assays, but inhibited the IKK activity in immunoprecipitation kinase assays, indicating RMP affected the activation of IKK complex rather than the formation (Fig. S6D, E). Taken together, IKKβ acted as an RMP kinase that phosphorylated RMP at the Ser439 site, and this phosphorylation was a negative feedback mechanism of IKKβ signaling.

We further explored the association between RMP and IKKβ under LPS stimulation, since LPS could induce the phosphorylation of RMP and IKKβ. LPS stimulation attenuated the interaction between IKKβ and RMP in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 6E, F), and similar results were also observed in HEK-293T cells co-transfected with RMP, IKKβ, and TLR4 plasmids (Fig. S5D, E), suggesting that RMP separated from the IKK complex after LPS stimulation. These results were verified by immunofluorescence staining assays (Fig. S5F). The association between RMP and IKKβ partially recovered after LPS stimulation (Fig. S5F, G), suggesting a dynamic change in the RMP phosphorylation state may affect their association.

Human RMP protein can be phosphorylated at Ser372, Ser442, and Thr373 sites by mTOR and S6K1 [20, 30]. Since the amino acid sequences of mouse RMP and human RMP are partially different, the Ser372 and Ser442 sites of human RMP correspond to the Ser369 and Ser439 sites of mouse RMP, whereas the Thr373 site of human RMP has no counterpart on the mouse RMP protein.

Furthermore, inhibition of mTOR signaling also did not affect the binding of RMP to IKKβ (Fig. S6C). Next, we explored whether phosphorylation of RMP altered the downstream signaling of IKK. NF-κB-luc reporter assays revealed that RMP-WT decreased NF-κB signaling which was counteracted by the mouse RMP-S439A mutant (Fig. 6G). These results suggested that RMP inhibited NF-κB signaling through its phosphorylation at the Ser439 site.

The C-terminal region of RMP binds to the kinase domain of IKKβTo identify the structural domain of the protein responsible for the interaction between RMP and IKKβ, truncations of mouse RMP were constructed according to the functional domains (Fig. 7A). We co-transfected IKKβ with various RMP truncations into HEK-293T cells and then performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The results showed that RMP-FL (1-531 aa), RMP-D3 (287–531 aa), and RMP-D5 (162–531 aa) interacted with IKKβ, whereas the N-terminal regions RMP-D1 (1-161 aa), RMP-D2 (162–286 aa), and RMP-D4 (1-286 aa) failed (Fig. 7B, C), suggesting that the C-terminal region of RMP is required for binding to IKKβ. The C-terminal truncations RMP-D3 (287–531 aa) and RMP-D5 (162–531 aa) both contain a Ser439 site targeted by active IKKβ, raising the possibility that RMP Ser439 site is vital for binding to IKKβ.

To further explore the mechanisms by which the RMP structural domain containing the Ser439 site binds to IKKβ, and based on the assumption that the kinase structural domain of IKKβ may be responsible for this interaction, we constructed several IKKβ truncations containing a kinase domain (KD), leucine-zipper (LZ) domain, or helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain (Fig. 7D). RMP interacted with the kinase domain of IKKβ (IKKβ-KD) but not with the IKKβ-HLH or IKKβ-LZ domain (Fig. 7E, F). We co-transfected RMP-D3 (287–531 aa) and the IKKβ-KD domain into HEK-293T cells and confirmed the interaction between the two regions (Fig. 7G, H). Together, these data verified that the C-terminal region of RMP binds to the kinase domain of IKKβ.

To identify the structural domain of the protein responsible for the interaction between RMP and IKKβ, truncations of mouse RMP were constructed according to the functional domains (Fig. 7A). We co-transfected IKKβ with various RMP truncations into HEK-293T cells and then performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The results showed that RMP-FL (1-531 aa), RMP-D3 (287–531 aa), and RMP-D5 (162–531 aa) interacted with IKKβ, whereas the N-terminal regions RMP-D1 (1-161 aa), RMP-D2 (162–286 aa), and RMP-D4 (1-286 aa) failed (Fig. 7B, C), suggesting that the C-terminal region of RMP is required for binding to IKKβ. The C-terminal truncations RMP-D3 (287–531 aa) and RMP-D5 (162–531 aa) both contain a Ser439 site targeted by active IKKβ, raising the possibility that RMP Ser439 site is vital for binding to IKKβ.

To further explore the mechanisms by which the RMP structural domain containing the Ser439 site binds to IKKβ, and based on the assumption that the kinase structural domain of IKKβ may be responsible for this interaction, we constructed several IKKβ truncations containing a kinase domain (KD), leucine-zipper (LZ) domain, or helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain (Fig. 7D). RMP interacted with the kinase domain of IKKβ (IKKβ-KD) but not with the IKKβ-HLH or IKKβ-LZ domain (Fig. 7E, F). We co-transfected RMP-D3 (287–531 aa) and the IKKβ-KD domain into HEK-293T cells and confirmed the interaction between the two regions (Fig. 7G, H). Together, these data verified that the C-terminal region of RMP binds to the kinase domain of IKKβ.

Inhibition of LPS-induced activation of IKKβ requires the RMP/PP2A complexThe above data revealed that RMP acts as a downstream substrate of IKK kinase and attenuates LPS-induced inflammation. Next, we sought to investigate the mechanism by which RMP inhibits IKKβ phosphorylation. It has been reported that IKKβ can form signaling complexes with PP1γ and/or PP2A in response to TNFR/TLR activation, and these protein serine/threonine phosphatases negatively regulate NF-κB signaling through the dephosphorylation of IKKβ [31, 32]. Similarly, RMP also interacts with PP1γ and/or PP2A and is involved in their functional regulation [20, 24]. We speculated that RMP may act as a mediator of IKKβ inactivation by recruiting members of protein phosphatase. Indeed, we identified that PP2Ab, but not PP2Aa, PP2Ac, or PP1γ, could be precipitated by RMP and IKKβ antibodies in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 8A), indicating that RMP, IKKβ, and PP2Ab form a complex and that the PP2A holoenzyme may be involved in RMP-mediated inactivation of IKKβ. Then we discovered that RMP overexpression strengthened the interaction between IKKβ and PP2Ab (Fig. 8B-E), indicating that RMP promoted the formation of the IKK-PP2A complex. To verify that the PP2A holoenzyme dephosphorylates IKKβ and affects NF-κB signaling, we treated THP-1 cells with a PP2A inhibitor or overexpressed PP2Ab in THP-1 cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that under LPS treatment, PP2A inhibitor increased IKKβ phosphorylation and decreased the binding of IKKβ to RMP (Fig. S7A, B). Together, these data suggested that PP2A inhibited the phosphorylation of IKK and promoted the interaction between IKKβ and RMP.

To further probe whether PP2A was responsible for the RMP-mediated inhibition of IKKβ and NF-κB signaling, NF-κB-luc reporter gene assays and immunoblotting were performed in THP-1 cells. Consequently, the PP2A inhibitor restored the inhibitory effect of RMP overexpression on IKK/NF-κB signaling under LPS treatment (Fig. 8F, G). Similarly, under LPS treatment, PP2Ab overexpression could limit the excessive activation of IKK/NF-κB signaling (Fig. 8F, H). In conclusion, these results indicated a potential mechanism for RMP-induced IKK inactivation and suggested that RMP recruits the protein phosphatase PP2A to form the IKK-RMP-PP2A complex, which maintains IKK in its default inactive state in macrophages.To directly confirm the association between IKKβ, RMP, and PP2Ab proteins, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was employed to detect the binding characteristics and affinity constants between IKKβ, PP2Ab, and RMP WT or RMP S439A. RMP could bind to IKKβ in vitro and RMP mutation at the Ser439 site enhanced their binding (Fig. 8I and Fig. S7C, D), consistent with results of co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pulldown assay. Moreover, PP2Ab, RMP, and IKKβ potentially bound to each other in vitro to form a complex (Fig. 8J and Fig. S7E-G).Collectively, we proposed a model that IKKβ, RMP, and PP2Ab could form a complex in macrophages based on our in vivo and in vitro data. In the resting state, RMP would be associated with IKKβ and recruit PP2A to maintain IKKβ in an unphosphorylated inactive state. Treatment with LPS led to RMP phosphorylation at the Ser439 site by IKKβ and the release of both RMP and PP2A from the complex, permitting phosphorylated IKK complex to activate IκB, leading to the degradation of IκB and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB (Fig. 8K).

DiscussionTLRs are known to elicit conserved inflammatory pathways, which culminate in the activation of diverse signaling pathways, such as IKK/NF-κB, MAPK (JNK, ERK, and P38), PI3K-AKT and other pathways [9]. However, aberrant activation of TLRs disturbs immune homeostasis, which leads to the development of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases [33–35]. Multiple mechanisms have been reported to prevent inappropriate activation of TLRs, including kinase activity alteration, signal protein degradation, epigenetic modification, and transcriptional regulation [3, 9, 36–38]. Although overwhelming evidence shows that IKKβ is essential for the activation of NF-κB [12, 39, 40], relatively little is known about its negative regulation. In the present study, our data revealed a homeostatic mechanism in which RMP attenuates TLR-mediated NF-κB signaling through an inhibitory interaction with IKKβ.The RMP gene was first isolated and cloned from a human HepG2 cDNA and was found to counteract the transactivation of the hepatitis B virus X protein [16]. The primary structure of RMP contains all features of an α class PFD, an RPB5-binding region, and a long acidic C-terminal domain [19, 21]. RMP was found to be a part of the R2TP/PDFL complex and functioned as a chaperone that coordinated the interaction of proteins involved in transcription such as TFIIF, the Paf-1 complex, and the RNA polymerase II [16, 41, 42]. It has also been suggested that RMP could be phosphorylated by S6K1 at Ser371 to limit the mTOR signaling [20]. Thus, evidence suggests that RMP can also act as a substrate for several important kinases, and not simply as a chaperone. RMP was observed to associate with P65 and RPB5, which assemble in the pre-transcriptional initiation complex of IL-6 [23], indicating that RMP is involved in NF-κB signaling. However, since these studies were performed in parenchymal cells, the regulatory role of RMP in mesenchymal cells, particularly in immunocyte activation, remains to be fully elucidated.We found that RMP attenuated IKK phosphorylation and then NF-κB activation by selectively interacting with IKKβ. The IKK complex is composed of the kinase subunits IKKα and IKKβ as well as the regulatory subunit IKKγ. Also, our exogenous and endogenous co-immunoprecipitation results revealed that RMP was also slightly bound to IKKα/γ, so we speculated that RMP may indirectly interact with these two subunits by IKKβ. Few studies have discovered proteins that directly downregulate IKK activity. In our study, we found that RMP preferentially bound to the KD domain of IKKβ and inhibited its phosphorylation and activity.CUE domain-containing 2 (CUEDC2) interacts with IKKα/β but not IKKγ and recruits PP1 to deactivate the IKK complex by dephosphorylating IKKα/β [43]. Given that RMP was shown to interact with the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A [20, 24], which were reported to associate with IKKβ and deactivate the IKK complex [31, 32], we then explored whether RMP elicited a similar function as CUEDC2 on IKK kinases. We revealed that PP2Ab (rather than PP2Aa, PP2Ac, or PP1) interacted with RMP in macrophages. As a heterotrimer, PP2A is composed of three subunits: a structural A subunit (PP2Aa), a regulatory B-type subunit (PP2Ab), and a catalytic C subunit (PP2Ac). To further prove that PP2A was responsible for the RMP-mediated dephosphorylation of IKK, a PP2A inhibitor was used to treat RMP-overexpressing or RMP-knockdown macrophages, and results confirmed that the inhibitory role of RMP on the phosphorylation of IKKβ was dependent on PP2A enzymatic activation.The interaction between RMP and IKKβ appeared to be dynamic since LPS treatment decreased the interaction between RMP and IKKβ. We observed altered phosphorylation of RMP protein at the Ser439 site induced by LPS stimulation. Treatment with IKK inhibitors and in vitro IKK kinase assays confirmed that IKKβ was a functional kinase targeting the RMP. The S439 site is located at the C-terminal domain of RMP, which is responsible for interaction with the KD domain of IKKβ. When stimulated by LPS (an agonist of TLR4), Pam3csk4 (an agonist of TLR1/2), or Resiquimod (an agonist of TLR7/8), TLRs are activated, which in turn initiates a downstream kinase signaling cascade that includes IKKβ. Activated IKKβ begins to phosphorylate the RMP protein, and this phosphorylation may lead to conformational changes in RMP that reduce its ability to bind to IKKβ. To confirm this hypothesis, we mutated the Ser439 site in RMP and showed that the mutant bound more tightly to IKKβ than the wild-type RMP, regardless of treatment with LPS. The RMP S439A mutant also inhibited LPS-induced IKK activation, indicating that the Ser439 site is a checkpoint for RMP-mediated inflammatory signaling. Consequently, a working model was proposed to illustrate how RMP modulated NF-κB signaling. In resting macrophage cells, RMP binds to the kinase domain of IKKβ and recruits PP2A to prevent the phosphorylation of IKKβ. After LPS stimulation, however, RMP was phosphorylated by IKKβ at the Ser439 site and dissociated from IKKβ, allowing downstream NF-κB signaling activation. Therefore, RMP serves as a checkpoint in TLR signaling and is a key regulator of innate immunity.In addition, RMP promotes IL-6 transcription in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines through the NF-κB pathway [31, 32]. We discovered that RMP negatively regulated the TLR4-NF-κB pathway in macrophages, which led to alterations in IL-6 transcription. To our knowledge, HCC cells lack TLR4 receptors and cannot be activated by the corresponding ligands. Therefore, we speculated that RMP plays different roles in diverse cell types through particular signaling pathways. Conclusion.Collectively, our findings revealed the role of RMP in the negative regulation of NF-κB signaling and elucidated the molecular mechanism by which RMP dynamically interacts with the IKK complex in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Thus, RMP may represent a useful therapeutic target for microbial infections and inflammation-associated diseases.
