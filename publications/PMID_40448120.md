The CCC complex, composed of CCDC22, CCDC93, and ten proteins of the COMMD 
family, coordinates several critical steps required to recycle internalized 
plasma membrane proteins from endosomes to the cell surface. CCC interacts with 
Retriever, a trimeric cargo recognition complex comprising VPS35L, VPS26C, and 
VPS29, and works closely with the WASH complex, a crucial regulator of branched 
actin polymerization at endosomal membranes. Mutations in genes encoding 
subunits of these three complexes, CCDC22, VPS35L, and WASHC5, have been linked 
with a developmental syndrome known as 3 C (cranio-cerebello-cardiac) or 
Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome. Here, we report a new CCDC22 missense mutation, 
p.E208K, that results in attenuated 3 C syndrome, without cardiac or 
neuroanatomical abnormalities. We show that this mutation impairs CCC complex 
assembly by disrupting a conserved interaction surface required for 
CCDC22-COMMD4 binding. We also review previously described cases and identify 
that CCDC22 p.P172R has a similar attenuated phenotype and impairs complex 
assembly in a similar fashion as p.E208K. The characterization of these 
mutations adds to our understanding of the clinical and molecular spectrum of 
these disorders.
