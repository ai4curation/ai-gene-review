Telomeres are essential for chromosome integrity and protection, and their 
maintenance requires the ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase. Previously, we 
have shown that human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) contains a 
bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS; residues 222-240) that is 
responsible for nuclear import, and that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of residue 
S227 is important for efficient nuclear import of hTERT. Here, we show that 
hTERT binds to importin-α proteins through the bipartite NLS and that this 
heterodimer then forms a complex with importin-β proteins to interact with the 
nuclear pore complex. Depletion of individual importin-α proteins results in a 
failure of hTERT nuclear import, and the resulting cytoplasmic hTERT is degraded 
by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Crystallographic analysis reveals that the 
bipartite NLS interacts with both the major and minor sites of importin-α 
proteins. We also show that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of S227 increases the 
binding affinity for importin-α proteins and promotes nuclear import of hTERT, 
thereby resulting in increased telomerase activity. These data provide details 
of a binding mechanism that enables hTERT to interact with the nuclear import 
receptors and of the control of the dynamic nuclear transport of hTERT through 
phosphorylation.
