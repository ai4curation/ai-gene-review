Covalent modifications of histone N-terminal tails play a critical role in 
regulating chromatin structure and controlling gene expression. These 
modifications are controlled by histone-modifying enzymes and read out by 
histone-binding proteins. Numerous proteins have been identified as histone 
modification readers. Here we report the family-wide characterization of histone 
binding abilities of human CW domain-containing proteins. We demonstrate that 
the CW domains in ZCWPW2 and MORC3/4 selectively recognize histone H3 
trimethylated at Lys-4, similar to ZCWPW1 reported previously, while the MORC1/2 
and LSD2 lack histone H3 Lys-4 binding ability. Our crystal structures of the CW 
domains of ZCWPW2 and MORC3 in complex with the histone H3 trimethylated at 
Lys-4 peptide reveal the molecular basis of this interaction. In each complex, 
two tryptophan residues in the CW domain form the "floor" and "right wall," 
respectively, of the methyllysine recognition cage. Our mutation results based 
on ZCWPW2 reveal that the right wall tryptophan residue is essential for 
binding, and the floor tryptophan residue enhances binding affinity. Our 
structural and mutational analysis highlights the conserved roles of the cage 
residues of CW domain across the histone methyllysine binders but also suggests 
why some CW domains lack histone binding ability.
