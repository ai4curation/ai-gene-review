Many components of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway are expressed during 
mouse pre-implantation embryo development, suggesting that this pathway may 
control cell proliferation and differentiation at this time. We find no evidence 
for a functional activity of this pathway in cleavage-stage embryos using the 
Wnt-reporter line, BAT-gal. To further probe the activity of this pathway, we 
activated beta-catenin signaling by mating a zona pellucida3-cre (Zp3-cre) 
transgenic mouse line with a mouse line containing an exon3-floxed beta-catenin 
allele. The result is expression of a stabilized form of beta-catenin, resistant 
to degradation by the GSK3beta-mediated proteasome pathway, expressed in the 
developing oocyte and in each cell of the resulting embryos. Nuclear 
localization and signaling function of beta-catenin were not observed in 
cleavage-stage embryos derived from these oocytes. These results indicate that 
in pre-implantation embryos, molecular mechanisms independent of the 
GSK3beta-mediated ubiquitination and proteasome degradation pathway inhibit the 
nuclear function of beta-catenin. Although the mutant blastocysts initially 
developed normally, they then exhibited a specific phenotype in the embryonic 
ectoderm layer of early post-implantation embryos. We show a nuclear function of 
beta-catenin in the mutant epiblast that leads to activation of Wnt/beta-catenin 
target genes. As a consequence, cells of the embryonic ectoderm change their 
fate, resulting in a premature epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
