The bacterial cell division machinery is organized in the so-called divisome 
composed of highly dynamic but low abundant interacting (membrane-bound) 
proteins. In order to elucidate the molecular interactions between these 
proteins, we developed a robust background-insensitive quantitative spectral 
unmixing method for estimating FRET efficiencies at near endogenous protein 
levels using fluorescent protein fusions. The assembly of the division machinery 
of Escherichia coli occurs in two steps that are discrete in time: first the 
FtsZ-ring and the so-called early localizing proteins that together seem to 
prepare the division assembly at midcell. Subsequently, the late localizing 
protein complexes that contain the peptidoglycan-synthesizing proteins PBP1B and 
FtsI (PBP3) are recruited to the division site, which initiates septation. 
Physical interactions were observed between members within each group but also 
between the early and late localizing proteins strongly suggesting that these 
proteins despite their differential localization in time are linked at the 
molecular and functional level. Interestingly, we find FtsN, one of the latest 
proteins in the divisome assembly, interacting with late assembling proteins 
FtsI and FtsW, but also with early (proto-ring) protein ZapA. This is in line 
with the recently described role of FtsN in divisome stabilization including the 
proto-ring elements.
