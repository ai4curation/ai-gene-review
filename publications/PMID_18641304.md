The role of CTLA-4 in regulatory T cell (Treg) function is not well understood. 
We have examined the role of CTLA-4 and its relationship with the transcription 
factor FoxP3 using a model of Treg induction in human peripheral blood. 
Activation of human CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells resulted in the appearance of a de 
novo population of FoxP3-expressing cells within 48 h. These cells expressed 
high levels of CTLA-4 and cell sorting on expression of CTLA-4 strongly enriched 
for FoxP3(+)-expressing cells with suppressive function. Culture in IL-2 alone 
also generated cells with suppressive capacity that also correlated with the 
appearance of CTLA-4. To directly test the role of CTLA-4, we transfected 
resting human T cells with CTLA-4 and found that this method conferred 
suppression, similar to that of natural Tregs, even though these cells did not 
express FoxP3. Furthermore, transfection of FoxP3 did not induce CTLA-4 and 
these cells were not suppressive. By separating the expression of CTLA-4 and 
FoxP3, our data show that FoxP3 expression alone is insufficient to up-regulate 
CTLA-4; however, activation of CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells can induce both FoxP3 and 
CTLA-4 in a subpopulation of T cells that are capable of suppression. These data 
suggest that the acquisition of suppressive behavior by activated CD4(+)CD25(-) 
T cells requires the expression of CTLA-4, a feature that appears to be 
facilitated by, but is not dependent on, expression of FoxP3.
