The development and progression of Alzheimer's disease is linked to excessive 
production of toxic amyloid-β peptide, initiated by β-secretase cleavage of the 
amyloid precursor protein (APP). In contrast, soluble APPα (sAPPα) generated by 
the α-secretase is known to stimulate dendritic branching and enhance synaptic 
function. Regulation of APP processing, and the shift from neurotrophic to 
neurotoxic APP metabolism remains poorly understood, but the cellular 
localization of APP and its interaction with various receptors is considered 
important. We here identify sortilin as a novel APP interaction partner. Like 
the related APP receptor SorLA, sortilin is highly expressed in the CNS, but 
whereas SorLA mainly colocalizes with APP in the soma, sortilin interacts with 
APP in neurites. The presence of sortilin promotes α-secretase cleavage of APP, 
unlike SorLA, which inhibits the generation of all soluble products. Also, 
sortilin and SorLA both bind and mediate internalization of sAPP but to 
different cellular compartments. The interaction involves the 6A domain of APP, 
present in both neuronal and non-neuronal APP isoforms. This is important as 
sAPP receptors described so far only bind the non-neuronal isoforms, leaving 
SorLA and sortilin as the only receptors for sAPP generated by neurons. 
Together, our findings establish sortilin, as a novel APP interaction partner 
that influences both production and cellular uptake of sAPP.
