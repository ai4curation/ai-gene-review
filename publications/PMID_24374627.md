The main oncogenic driver in T-lymphoblastic leukemia is NOTCH1, which activates 
genes by forming chromatin-associated Notch transcription complexes. 
Gamma-secretase-inhibitor treatment prevents NOTCH1 nuclear localization, but 
most genes with NOTCH1-binding sites are insensitive to gamma-secretase 
inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that fewer than 10% of NOTCH1-binding sites 
show dynamic changes in NOTCH1 occupancy when T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells are 
toggled between the Notch-on and -off states with gamma-secretase inhibiters. 
Dynamic NOTCH1 sites are functional, being highly associated with Notch target 
genes, are located mainly in distal enhancers, and frequently overlap with RUNX1 
binding. In line with the latter association, we show that expression of IL7R, a 
gene with key roles in normal T-cell development and in T-lymphoblastic 
leukemia, is coordinately regulated by Runx factors and dynamic NOTCH1 binding 
to distal enhancers. Like IL7R, most Notch target genes and associated dynamic 
NOTCH1-binding sites cooccupy chromatin domains defined by constitutive binding 
of CCCTC binding factor, which appears to restrict the regulatory potential of 
dynamic NOTCH1 sites. More remarkably, the majority of dynamic NOTCH1 sites lie 
in superenhancers, distal elements with exceptionally broad and high levels of 
H3K27ac. Changes in Notch occupancy produces dynamic alterations in H3K27ac 
levels across the entire breadth of superenhancers and in the promoters of Notch 
target genes. These findings link regulation of superenhancer function to 
NOTCH1, a master regulatory factor and potent oncoprotein in the context of 
immature T cells, and delineate a generally applicable roadmap for identifying 
functional Notch sites in cellular genomes.
