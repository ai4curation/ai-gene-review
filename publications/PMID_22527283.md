The integral telomerase RNA subunit templates the synthesis of telomeric 
repeats. The biological accumulation of human telomerase RNA (hTR) requires hTR 
H/ACA domain assembly with the same proteins that assemble on other human H/ACA 
RNAs. Despite this shared RNP composition, hTR accumulation is particularly 
sensitized to disruption by disease-linked H/ACA protein variants. We show that 
contrary to expectation, hTR-specific sequence requirements for biological 
accumulation do not act at an hTR-specific step of H/ACA RNP biogenesis; 
instead, they enhance hTR binding to the shared, chaperone-bound scaffold of 
H/ACA core proteins that mediates initial RNP assembly. We recapitulate 
physiological H/ACA RNP assembly with a preassembled NAF1/dyskerin/NOP10/NHP2 
scaffold purified from cell extract and demonstrate that distributed sequence 
features of the hTR 3' hairpin synergize to improve scaffold binding. Our 
findings reveal that the hTR H/ACA domain is distinguished from other human 
H/ACA RNAs not by a distinct set of RNA-protein interactions but by an increased 
efficiency of RNP assembly. Our findings suggest a unifying mechanism for human 
telomerase deficiencies associated with H/ACA protein variants.
