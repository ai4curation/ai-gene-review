Wnt/β-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling is crucial for the proliferation and 
maintenance of intestinal stem cells (ISC), but excessive activation leads to 
ISC expansion and eventually colorectal cancer. Thus, negative regulators are 
required to maintain optimal levels of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Aminoacyl-tRNA 
synthetase-interacting multifunctional proteins (AIMP) function in protein 
synthesis, but have also been implicated in signaling cascades affecting 
angiogenesis, immunity, and apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the 
relationship between AIMP2 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in a murine model of 
intestinal homeostasis and tumorigenesis. Hemizygous deletion of Aimp2 resulted 
in enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling, increased proliferation of cryptic 
epithelial cells, and expansion of ISC compartments. In an Apc(Min/+) 
background, Aimp2 hemizygosity increased adenoma formation. Mechanistically, 
AIMP2 disrupted the interaction between AXIN and Dishevelled-1 (DVL1) to inhibit 
Wnt/β-catenin signaling by competing with AXIN. Furthermore, AIMP2 inhibited 
intestinal organoid formation and growth by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling 
in an Aimp2 gene dosage-dependent manner. Collectively, our results showed that 
AIMP2 acts as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor that fine-tunes Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling in the intestine, illuminating the regulation of ISC abundance and 
activity. Cancer Res; 76(15); 4559-68. ©2016 AACR.
