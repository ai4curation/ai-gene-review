The role of D1 dopamine (DA) receptors in mediating the ability of DA to 
modulate responses attributable to activation of NMDA receptors was examined in 
mice lacking D1A dopamine receptors. Specifically, experiments were designed to 
test the hypothesis that the ability of DA to potentiate responses mediated by 
activation of NMDA receptors was attributable to activation of D1 receptors. 
Based on this hypothesis, we would predict that in the D1A mutant mouse, either 
DA would not induce enhancement of NMDA-mediated responses, or the enhancement 
would be severely attenuated. The results provided evidence to support the 
hypothesis. In mutant mice, DA and D1 receptor agonists did not potentiate 
responses mediated by activation of NMDA receptors. In contrast, in control 
mice, both DA and D1 receptor agonists markedly potentiated responses mediated 
by activation of NMDA receptors. The effects of DA in attenuating responses 
mediated by activation of non-NMDA receptors also were altered in the mutant, 
suggesting that this action of DA may require coupling or interactions between 
D1 and D2 receptors. The present studies also provided an opportunity to assess 
some of the basic electrophysiological and morphological properties of 
neostriatal neurons in mice lacking D1A DA receptors. Resting membrane 
potential, action potential parameters, input resistance, excitability, somatic 
size, dendritic extent, and estimates of spine density in mutants and controls 
were similar, suggesting that these basic neurophysiological and structural 
properties have not been changed by the loss of the D1A DA receptor.
