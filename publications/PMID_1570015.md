Defects in the NF1 gene have been implicated in the inherited disorder 
neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized by several developmental 
abnormalities including an increased frequency of benign and malignant tumours 
of neural crest origin (neurofibromas and neurofibrosarcomas respectively). The 
NF1 gene encodes a ubiquitous protein homologous to p120GAP, the 
GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the products of the ras protooncogenes. When 
expressed in non-mammalian systems, the region of the NF1 gene homologous to 
p120GAP produces a protein with GAP-like activity. Here we present evidence that 
the ras proteins in malignant tumour cell lines from patients with type 1 
neurofibromatosis are in a constitutively activated state, as judged by the 
guanine nucleotide bound to them, and are necessary for cellular proliferation. 
These cells contain p21ras and p120GAP that are both functionally wild type, but 
barely any functional NF1 protein. Our results show that the NF1 protein is 
normally essential for correct negative regulation of ras proteins in the cell, 
even in the presence of normal p120GAP, and they support the hypothesis that NF1 
is a tumour-suppressor gene whose product acts upstream of ras.
