The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) delays anaphase until all chromosomes are 
bioriented on the mitotic spindle. Under current models, unattached kinetochores 
transduce the SAC by catalyzing the intramitotic production of a diffusible 
inhibitor of APC/C(Cdc20) (the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its 
coactivator Cdc20, a large ubiquitin ligase). Here we show that nuclear pore 
complexes (NPCs) in interphase cells also function as scaffolds for 
anaphase-inhibitory signaling. This role is mediated by Mad1-Mad2 complexes 
tethered to the nuclear basket, which activate soluble Mad2 as a binding partner 
and inhibitor of Cdc20 in the cytoplasm. Displacing Mad1-Mad2 from nuclear pores 
accelerated anaphase onset, prevented effective correction of merotelic errors, 
and increased the threshold of kinetochore-dependent signaling needed to halt 
mitosis in response to spindle poisons. A heterologous Mad1-NPC tether restored 
Cdc20 inhibitor production and normal M phase control. We conclude that nuclear 
pores and kinetochores both emit "wait anaphase" signals that preserve genome 
integrity.
