During development and continuing into adulthood, stem cells function as a 
reservoir of undifferentiated cell types, whose role is to support cell genesis 
in several tissues and organs. In the adult, they play an essential homeostatic 
role by replacing differentiated cells that are lost due to physiological 
turnover, injury, or disease. The discovery of such cells in the adult mammalian 
central nervous system (CNS), an organ traditionally thought to have little or 
no regenerative capacity, has opened the door to the possibility of designing 
innovative regenerative therapeutics, an unexpected concept in neurobiology 15 
years ago. In 1992, to detect precursor cells in the adult brain, we employed a 
serum-free culture system whereby the majority of primary differentiated CNS 
cells did not survive but a small population of EGF-responsive cells were 
maintained in an undifferentiated state and proliferated to form clusters, 
called neurospheres (Reynolds and Weiss, Science 255:1707-1710, 1992). These 
neurospheres could be (a) dissociated to form numerous secondary spheres or (b) 
induced to differentiate, generating the three major cell types of the CNS. This 
chapter outlines the adult mammalian NSC culture methodology and provides 
technical details of the neurosphere assay to achieve reproducible cultures.
