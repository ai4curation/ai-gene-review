Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative 
disorder coupled to selective degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the 
substantia nigra. The majority of PD incidents are sporadic, but monogenic cases 
account for 5-10% of cases. Mutations in PINK1 cause autosomal recessive forms 
of early-onset PD, and PINK1 stimulates Omi/HtrA2/PARK13 protease activity when 
both proteins act as neuroprotective components in the same stress pathway. 
Studies on PINK1 and PARK13 have concentrated on phosphorylation-dependent 
PINK1-mediated activation of PARK13 and mitochondrial functions, because both 
proteins are classically viewed as mitochondrial. Although PARK13-mediated 
protective mechanisms are at least in part regulated by PINK1, little is known 
concerning how these two proteins are regulated in different subcellular 
compartments or, indeed, the influence of PARK13 on PINK1 characteristics. We 
show that PARK13 localizes to a variety of subcellular locations in neuronal 
cells and that PINK1, although more restrictive, also localizes to locations 
other than those previously reported. We demonstrate that PARK13 accumulation 
leads to a concomitant accumulation of PINK1 and that the increase in PINK1 
levels is compartmental specific, indicating a correlative relationship between 
the two proteins. Moreover, we show that PARK13 and PINK1 protein levels 
accumulate in response to H2 O2 and L-DOPA treatments in a subcellular fashion 
and that both proteins show relocation to the cytoskeleton in response to H2 O2 
. This H2 O2 -mediated relocation is abolished by PARK13 overexpression. This 
study shows that PARK13 and PINK1 are subcellular-specific, but dynamic, 
proteins with a reciprocal molecular relationship providing new insight into the 
complexity of PD.
