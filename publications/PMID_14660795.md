Bcl2 functions to suppress apoptosis and retard cell cycle entry. Single-site 
phosphorylation at serine 70 (S70) is required for Bcl2's antiapoptotic 
function, and multisite phosphorylation at threonine 69 (T69), S70, and S87 has 
been reported to inactivate Bcl2. To address this apparent conflict and identify 
the regulatory role for Bcl2 phosphorylation in cell death and cell cycle 
control, a series of serine/threonine (S/T) --> glutamate/alanine (E/A) mutants 
including T69E/A, S70E/A, S87E/A, T69E/S70A/S87A (EAA), T69A/S70E/S87A (AEA), 
T69A/S70A/S87E (AAE), T69E/S70E/S87E (EEE), and T69A/S70A/S87A (AAA) was created 
to mimic or abrogate, respectively, either single-site or multisite 
phosphorylation. The survival and cell cycle status of cells expressing the 
phosphomimetic or nonphosphorylatable Bcl2 mutants were compared. Surprisingly, 
all of the E but not the A Bcl2 mutants potently enhance cell survival after 
stress and retard G(1)/S cell cycle transition. The EEE Bcl2 mutant is the most 
potent, indicating a possible cumulative advantage for multisite phosphorylation 
of Bcl2 in survival and retardation of G(1)/S transition functions. Because the 
E-containing Bcl2 mutants, but not the A-containing mutants, can more potently 
block cytochrome c release from mitochondria during apoptotic stress, even at 
times when steady-state expression levels are similar for all mutants, we 
conclude that phosphorylation at one or multiple sites within the flexible loop 
domain of Bcl2 not only stimulates antiapoptotic activity but also can regulate 
cell cycle entry.
