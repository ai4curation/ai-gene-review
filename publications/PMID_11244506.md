The BRCA1 gene was previously found to inhibit the transcriptional activity of 
the estrogen receptor [ER-alpha] in human breast and prostate cancer cell lines. 
In this study, we found that breast cancer-associated mutations of BRCA1 abolish 
or reduce its ability to inhibit ER-alpha activity and that domains within the 
amino- and carboxyl-termini of the BRCA1 protein are required for the 
inhibition. BRCA1 inhibition of ER-alpha activity was demonstrated under 
conditions in which a BRCA1 transgene was transiently or stably over-expressed 
in cell lines with endogenous wild-type BRCA1 and in a breast cancer cell line 
that lacks endogenous functional BRCA1 (HCC1937). In addition, BRCA1 blocked the 
expression of two endogenous estrogen-regulated gene products in human breast 
cancer cells: pS2 and cathepsin D. The BRCA1 protein was found to associate with 
ER-alpha in vivo and to bind to ER-alpha in vitro, by an estrogen-independent 
interaction that mapped to the amino-terminal region of BRCA1 (ca. amino acid 
1-300) and the conserved carboxyl-terminal activation function [AF-2] domain of 
ER-alpha. Furthermore, several truncated BRCA1 proteins containing the 
amino-terminal ER-alpha binding region blocked the ability of the full-length 
BRCA1 protein to inhibit ER-alpha activity. Our findings suggest that the 
amino-terminus of BRCA1 interacts with ER-alpha, while the carboxyl-terminus of 
BRCA1 may function as a transcriptional repression domain. Oncogene (2001) 20,
