Hu-K4 is a human protein homologous to the K4L protein of vaccinia virus. Due to 
the presence of two HKD motifs, Hu-K4 was assigned to the family of 
Phospholipase D proteins although so far no catalytic activity has been shown. 
The Hu-K4 mRNA is found in many human organs with highest expression levels in 
the central nervous system. We extended the ORF of Hu-K4 to the 5' direction. As 
a consequence the protein is 53 amino acids larger than originally predicted, 
now harbouring a putative transmembrane domain. The exon/intron structure of the 
Hu-K4 gene reveals extensive alternative splicing in the 5' untranslated region. 
Due to the absence of G/C-rich regions and upstream ATG codons, the mRNA isoform 
in brain may be translated with higher efficacy leading to a high Hu-K4 protein 
concentration in this tissue. Using a specific antiserum produced against Hu-K4 
we found that Hu-K4 is a membrane-bound protein colocalizing with protein 
disulfide isomerase, a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum. Glycosylation of 
Hu-K4 as shown by treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F or tunicamycin 
indicates that Hu-K4 has a type 2 transmembrane topology.
