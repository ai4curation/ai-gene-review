Exit from mitosis in budding yeast requires a group of essential 
proteins--including the GTPase Tem1 and the protein phosphatase Cdc14--that 
downregulate cyclin-dependent kinase activity. We identified a mutation, net1-1, 
that bypasses the lethality of tem1 delta. NET1 encodes a novel protein, and 
mass spectrometric analysis reveals that it is a key component of a 
multifunctional complex, denoted RENT (for regulator of nucleolar silencing and 
telophase), that also contains Cdc14 and the silencing regulator Sir2. From G1 
through anaphase, RENT localizes to the nucleolus, and Cdc14 activity is 
inhibited by Net1. In late anaphase, Cdc14 dissociates from RENT, disperses 
throughout the cell in a Tem1-dependent manner, and ultimately triggers mitotic 
exit. Nucleolar sequestration may be a general mechanism for the regulation of 
diverse biological processes.
