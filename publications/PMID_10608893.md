Human DNA polymerase gamma is composed of a 140-kDa catalytic subunit and a 
smaller accessory protein variously reported to be 43-54 kDa. Immunoblot 
analysis of the purified, heterodimeric native human polymerase gamma complex 
identified the accessory subunit as 55 kDa. We isolated the full-length cDNA 
encoding a 55-kDa polypeptide, expressed the cDNA in Escherichia coli and 
purified the 55-kDa protein to homogeneity. Recombinant Hp55 forms a high 
affinity, salt-stable complex with Hp140 during protein affinity chromatography. 
Immunoprecipitation, gel filtration, and sedimentation analyses revealed a 
190-kDa complex indicative of a native heterodimer. Reconstitution of Hp140.Hp55 
raises the salt optimum of Hp140, stimulates the polymerase and exonuclease 
activities, and increases the processivity of the enzyme by several 100-fold. 
Similar to Hp140, isolated Hp55 binds DNA with moderate strength and was a 
specificity for double-stranded primer-template DNA. However, Hp140.Hp55 has a 
surprisingly high affinity for DNA, and kinetic analyses indicate Hp55 enhances 
the affinity of Hp140 for primer termini by 2 orders of magnitude. Thus the 
enhanced DNA binding caused by Hp55 is the basis for the salt tolerance and high 
processivity characteristic of DNA polymerase gamma. Observation of native DNA 
polymerase gamma both as an Hp140 monomer and as a heterodimer with Hp55 
supports the notion that the two forms act in mitochondrial DNA repair and 
replication. Additionally, association of Hp55 with Hp140 protects the 
polymerase from inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide.
