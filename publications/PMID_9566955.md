Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are believed to play a key role in tissue 
differentiation and maturation. Thus, the expression of the four members of the 
high-affinity tyrosine kinase FGF receptor family (FGFRs) and of the 
low-affinity heparan sulphate proteoglycan binding sites, syndecan-1 and 
perlecan, was studied in the human skeletal muscle during development. Northern 
blot analysis demonstrated a developmentally regulated expression of the mRNAs 
for FGFR-1, FGFR-3, FGFR-4, whereas only traces of FGFR-2 mRNA were found. Each 
receptor type had a different developmental pattern, suggesting an independent 
regulation. Signal for FGFR-3 was retained only in the adult muscle. Among the 
low-affinity FGF binding sites, perlecan was absent, whereas RNA transcript for 
syndecan-1 peaked at week 13 of gestation, after which a significant decrease 
was observed. Immunohistochemistry for FGFRs revealed that their localization 
changed with muscle maturation. At early embryonic stages, FGFR-3 and FGFR-4 had 
a scattered distribution in the tissue, and FGFR-1 was found on myotube and 
myofiber plasma membranes. At later stages, FGFR-1 positivity decreased and was 
found in a few areas of the muscle, FGFR-3 was concentrated in the nuclei of 
some, but not all, muscle fibers, and FGFR-4 maintained an association with 
plasma membrane. In adult tissue, weak positivity for FGFR-3 and FGFR-4 was 
observed in the connective tissue only. When immunocytochemistry was performed 
on human fetal myoblasts in culture, confocal microscope analysis revealed a 
nonhomogeneous cell membrane distribution of FGFRs. Taken together, the data 
strongly suggest that developmentally regulated expression and cell distribution 
of FGFRs play a role during muscle maturation.
