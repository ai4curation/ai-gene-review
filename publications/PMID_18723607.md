TOR is a structurally and functionally conserved Ser/Thr kinase found in two 
multiprotein complexes that regulate many cellular processes to control cell 
growth. Although extensively studied, the localization of TOR is still 
ambiguous, possibly because endogenous TOR in live cells has not been examined. 
Here, we examined the localization of green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged, 
endogenous TOR1 and TOR2 in live S. cerevisiae cells. A DNA cassette encoding 
three copies of green fluorescent protein (3XGFP) was inserted in the TOR1 gene 
(at codon D330) or the TOR2 gene (at codon N321). The TORs were tagged 
internally because TOR1 or TOR2 tagged at the N or C terminus was not 
functional. The TOR1(D330-3XGFP) strain was not hypersensitive to rapamycin, was 
not cold sensitive, and was not resistant to manganese toxicity caused by the 
loss of Pmr1, all indications that TOR1-3XGFP was expressed and functional. 
TOR2-3XGFP was functional, as TOR2 is an essential gene and TOR2(N321-3XGFP) 
haploid cells were viable. Thus, TOR1 and TOR2 retain function after the 
insertion of 748 amino acids in a variable region of their noncatalytic domain. 
The localization patterns of TOR1-3XGFP and TOR2-3XGFP were documented by 
imaging of live cells. TOR1-3XGFP was diffusely cytoplasmic and concentrated 
near the vacuolar membrane. The TOR2-3XGFP signal was cytoplasmic but 
predominately in dots at the plasma membrane. Thus, TOR1 and TOR2 have distinct 
localization patterns, consistent with the regulation of cellular processes as 
part of two different complexes.
