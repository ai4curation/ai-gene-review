Endothelial cell (EC) migration, cell-cell adhesion, and the formation of

via beta-catenin/LEF-1 signaling in a phosphatase and tensin homologue 
(PTEN)-dependent manner. In confluent ECs, depletion of p120-catenin restored 
LPP3-mediated beta-catenin/LEF-1 signaling. Depletion of LPP3 resulted in 
destabilization of beta-catenin, which in turn reduced fibronectin synthesis and

reexpression of beta-catenin but not p120-catenin in LPP3-depleted ECs restored 
de novo synthesis of fibronectin, which mediated EC migration and formation of 
branching point structures. In confluent ECs, however, a fraction of 
p120-catenin associated and colocalized with LPP3 at the plasma membrane, via 
the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, thereby limiting the ability of LPP3 to

Abstract

Endothelial cell (EC) migration, cell-cell adhesion, and the formation of branching point structures are considered hallmarks of angiogenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms of these processes are not well understood. Lipid phosphate phosphatase 3 (LPP3) is a recently described p120-catenin-associated integrin ligand localized in adherens junctions (AJs) of ECs. Here, we tested the hypothesis that LPP3 stimulates β-catenin/lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (β-catenin/LEF-1) to induce EC migration and formation of branching point structures. In subconfluent ECs, LPP3 induced expression of fibronectin via β-catenin/LEF-1 signaling in a phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)-dependent manner. In confluent ECs, depletion of p120-catenin restored LPP3-mediated β-catenin/LEF-1 signaling. Depletion of LPP3 resulted in destabilization of β-catenin, which in turn reduced fibronectin synthesis and deposition, which resulted in inhibition of EC migration. Accordingly, reexpression of β-catenin but not p120-catenin in LPP3-depleted ECs restored de novo synthesis of fibronectin, which mediated EC migration and formation of branching point structures. In confluent ECs, however, a fraction of p120-catenin associated and colocalized with LPP3 at the plasma membrane, via the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, thereby limiting the ability of LPP3 to stimulate β-catenin/LEF-1 signaling. Thus, our study identified a key role for LPP3 in orchestrating PTEN-mediated β-catenin/LEF-1 signaling in EC migration, cell-cell adhesion, and formation of branching point structures.

DISCUSSION

Here, we demonstrated a critical role for LPP3-induced β-catenin/LEF-1 signaling in EC migration, cell-cell adhesion, and formation of branching point structures. In subconfluent ECs, LPP3 induced activation of β-catenin/LEF-1 signaling, resulting in the synthesis of the LEF-1 target fibronectin ( 26 , 27 ) and VE-cadherin. In confluent ECs, however, LPP3 remained bound to p120ctn, which reduced the ability of LPP3 to stimulate β-catenin/LEF-1 signaling (Fig. 11 ). Thus, LPP3-induced β-catenin/LEF-1 signaling is a critical pathway involved in the angiogenic activities of ECs.

Since LPP3 regulates the Wnt signaling pathway ( 11 ), we posited that LPP3-induced activation of β-catenin may be important in activating the TCF/LEF-1 transcription machinery and may thus contribute to LPP3-mediated EC migration, cell-cell adhesion, and formation of branching point structures. To test this hypothesis, we examined LPP3-induced activation of β-catenin-dependent LEF-1 transcription (Fig. 1 ). In confluent ECs, LPP3-dependent β-catenin/LEF-1 transcription activity was not detectable (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material); however, in subconfluent ECs, we observed marked LEF-1 activity (Fig. 1 ). Transfection of LPP3 in subconfluent ECs also stimulated the interaction of β-catenin with LEF-1, resulting in the production of the LEF-1 target fibronectin, a key molecule that is known to mediate EC migration and angiogenesis ( 10 , 26 , 27 ). In addition, both phosphatase-defective or adhesion-defective LPP3 mutants are capable of stimulating LEF-1 activity. In contrast, an LPP3 mutant carrying both mutations (PD plus RAD; acts as a dominant-negative mutant) failed to stimulate LEF-1. This result is attributable to the ability of the double mutant to titrate out endogenous LPP3. We were unable, however, to determine the precise biochemical mechanism(s) by which the phosphatase-defective LPP3 stimulated dephosphorylation of β-catenin. Nevertheless, our data show that LPP3 contains two functional domains: a lipid phosphatase domain and a cell binding domain. Moreover, these two domains function independently to stimulate LEF-1; however, both domains are required for optimal stimulation of LEF-1 (Fig. 1B ). We also identified a role for the phosphatase PTEN in the stimulation of β-catenin dephosphorylation, which is a mechanism responsible for LPP3-induced β-catenin/LEF-1 signaling (Fig. 1G, H , and 2 ). Together, these data show that LPP3 stabilizes β-catenin in subconfluent ECs and thereby promotes LEF-1 transcriptional activity. Interestingly, in p120ctn-depleted confluent ECs, β-catenin/LEF-1 signaling was restored (Fig. 3 ). These data indicate that LPP3-induced β-catenin/LEF-1 signaling is cell density dependent specifically when LPP3 is not localized to the inner face of the plasma membrane at the level of AJs and not bound to p120ctn. The inability of LPP3 to stimulate β-catenin/LEF-1 signaling in confluent ECs may also be partly due to the contact inhibition phenomenon.

Angiogenic activities of ECs require growth factor stimulation, EC migration, cell-cell adhesion, and the formation of branching point structures ( 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 29 , 33 , 34 , 37 - 39 , 41 , 42 ). We observed that depletion of endogenous LPP3 resulted in impairment of these events, suggesting an important role for LPP3 in angiogenesis (Fig. 4 ). LPP3 knockdown decreased total β-catenin, p120ctn, and VE-cadherin levels (Fig. 4 , 5 , and 6 ). Reexpression of β-catenin in LPP3-depleted cells restored the EC's ability to migrate, form AJ structures, and induce cell-cell adhesion, while p120ctn reexpression did not reverse the loss of LPP3. These results indicate the importance of β-catenin as a downstream mediator of LPP3 signaling (Fig. 5 and 6 ). Our current model (Fig. 11 ), therefore, predicts that LPP3 in the confluent EC monolayer is a negative regulator of β-catenin/LEF-1-activated transcription and that loss of EC confluence (e.g., wound) induces LPP3 activation of the β-catenin/LEF-1 pathway. This mechanism mediates de novo synthesis of LEF-1-induced protein fibronectin that contributes to negative-feedback regulation of EC migration and thus reestablishes the confluent monolayer (Fig. 4 ). Thus, our studies add to the increasing recognition that LPP3 plays a key role in β-catenin/LEF-1 signaling, which regulates diverse cellular responses, including cell migration, cell-cell adhesion, and the formation of branching point structures.

Since reexpression of β-catenin in LPP3-depleted ECs induced branching point structures (in rescue experiment) and cell-cell adhesion, we propose that β-catenin acts as a downstream mediator of LPP3 signaling. Whereas overabundance and degradation of β-catenin are regulated by its phosphorylation status, knockdown of LPP3 in sparse ECs decreased LEF-1 stimulation, which we attributed to reduced β-catenin stabilization. Our initial experiments indicated that silencing of either the LPP3 or p120ctn gene reduced the formation of branching point structures of ECs. We attributed this defect to the loss of p120ctn and VE-cadherin, which are two essential components of AJs. The loss of VE-cadherin from AJs is known to affect AJ stability and angiogenesis ( 40 , 43 ). Subsequently, the knockdown of the LPP3 gene resulted in altered angiogenic activities of ECs, such as EC migration, cell-cell adhesion, and branching point structure formation. These data suggest that LPP3 may regulate many aspects of angiogenesis by stabilizing β-catenin function.

Interestingly, the localization of LPP3 is cell density dependent. In subconfluent ECs, LPP3 was mostly distributed in the cytosol, whereas in confluent ECs, LPP3 interacted with a fraction of p120ctn at the plasma membrane. We also identified and characterized a novel interaction between LPP3 and p120ctn proteins (Fig. 7 to 9 ; see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). This interaction did not require VE-cadherin. Since LPP3-Δ-C-cyto did not colocalize with p120ctn and reexpression of LPP3-Δ-C-cyto in LPP3-knockdown ECs failed to induce branching point structures (Fig. 10 ) but induced cell proliferation, our data suggest that the C-terminal segment of LPP3 is required for the formation of branching point structures.

p120ctn binds the transcriptional repressor protein Kaiso ( 7 , 30 , 32 ). The interaction between p120ctn and Kaiso has been suggested to relieve Kaiso-mediated transcriptional repression ( 7 , 30 , 32 ). Whether the interaction between LPP3 and p120ctn may also release Kaiso from the cytoplasmic compartment, allowing this protein to translocate to the nucleus to repress genes, including Wnt target(s), would be of intrinsic value. Thus, investigation of possible cross talk between LPP3 and the Kaiso pathway will require further investigation. In summary, our results introduce the novel concept that LPP3 regulates PTEN-mediated β-catenin/LEF-1 transcriptional activity in subconfluent ECs, whereas LPP3 function in confluent ECs is blocked by binding to p120ctn to limit the extent of cell migration. Thus, our results demonstrate the ability of LPP3 to be activated in the subconfluent state and highlight the potentially important role of LPP3 in regulating endothelial homeostasis.
