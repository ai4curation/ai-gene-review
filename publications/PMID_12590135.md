Histone deacetylases (HDACs) perform an important function in transcriptional 
regulation by modifying the core histones of the nucleosome. We have now fully 
characterized a new member of the Class II HDAC family, HDAC9. The enzyme 
contains a conserved deacetylase domain, represses reporter activity when 
recruited to a promoter, and utilizes histones H3 and H4 as substrates in vitro 
and in vivo. HDAC9 is expressed in a tissue-specific pattern that partially 
overlaps that of HDAC4. Within the human hematopoietic system, expression of 
HDAC9 is biased toward cells of monocytic and lymphoid lineages. The HDAC9 gene 
encodes multiple protein isoforms, some of which display distinct cellular 
localization patterns. For example, full-length HDAC9 is localized in the 
nucleus, but the isoform lacking the region encoded by exon 7 is in the 
cytoplasm. HDAC9 interacts and co-localizes in vivo with a number of 
transcriptional repressors and co-repressors, including TEL and N-CoR, whose 
functions have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hematological 
malignancies. These results suggest that HDAC9 plays a role in hematopoiesis; 
its deregulated expression may be associated with some human cancers.
