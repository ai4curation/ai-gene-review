The highly conserved COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex is a key regulator of all 
cullin-RING-ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), the largest family of E3 ubiquitin 
ligases. Until now, it was accepted that the CSN is composed of eight canonical 
components. Here, we report the discovery of an additional integral and 
stoichiometric subunit that had thus far evaded detection, and we named it CSNAP 
(CSN acidic protein). We show that CSNAP binds CSN3, CSN5, and CSN6, and its 
incorporation into the CSN complex is mediated through the C-terminal region 
involving conserved aromatic residues. Moreover, depletion of this small protein 
leads to reduced proliferation and a flattened and enlarged morphology. Finally, 
on the basis of sequence and structural properties shared by both CSNAP and 
DSS1, a component of the related 19S lid proteasome complex, we propose that 
CSNAP, the ninth CSN subunit, is the missing paralogous subunit of DSS1.
