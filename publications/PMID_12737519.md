RMP was reported to regulate transcription via competing with HBx to bind the 
general transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) and interacting with RPB5 subunit of 
RNA polymerase II as a corepressor of transcription regulator. However, our 
present research uncovered that RMP also regulates the transcription through 
interaction with the general transcription factors IIF (TFIIF), which assemble 
in the preinitiation complex and function in both transcription initiation and 
elongation. With in vitro pull-down assay and Far-Western analysis, we 
demonstrated that RMP could bind with bacterially expressed recombinant RAP30 
and RAP74 of TFIIF subunits. In the immunoprecipitation assay in COS1 cells 
cotransfected with FLAG-tagged RMP or its mutants, GST-fused RAP30 and RAP74 
were co-immunoprecipitated with RMP in approximately equal molar ratio, which 
suggests that RAP30 and RAP74 interact with RMP as a TFIIF complex. 
Interestingly both RAP30 and RAP74 interact with the same domain (D5) of the 
C-terminal RMP of 118-amino-acid residuals which overlaps with its TFIIB-binding 
domain. Internal deletion of D5 region of RMP abolished its binding ability with 
both subunits of TFIIF, while D5 domain alone was sufficient to interact with 
TFIIF subunits. The result of luciferase assay showed that overexpression of 
RMP, but not the mutant RMP lacking D5 region, suppressed the transcription 
activated by Gal-VP16, suggesting that interaction with TFIIF is required for 
RMP to suppress the activated transcription. The interaction between RMP and 
TFIIF may be an additional passway for RMP to regulate the transcription, or 
alternatively TFIIF may cooperate with RPB5 and TFIIB for the corepressor 
function of RMP.
