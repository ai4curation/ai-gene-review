D-Glycerate kinase was measured in human livers thanks to a new, sensitive 
radiochemical assay. The enzyme was extremely unstable in extracts prepared in 
water, but was partly stabilized in a homogenization mixture containing 
inorganic phosphate, D-glycerate and EGTA. When extracted in such a stabilizing 
mixture, glycerate kinase activity amounted to 0.86 +/- 0.21 U/g in control 
livers and to 0.03 U/g in the liver of a patient with D-glyceric aciduria. In 
contrast, D-glycerate dehydrogenase (glyoxylate reductase) and triokinase 
activities were not deficient in the liver of the same patient. It is concluded 
that D-glycerate kinase deficiency is a cause of D-glyceric aciduria.
