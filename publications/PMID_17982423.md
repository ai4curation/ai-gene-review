PURPOSE: The corneal endothelium is a monolayer of cells in the posterior cornea 
that is responsible for maintaining a clear cornea. Corneal endothelial cells 
may be induced to divide, but it has been held that they do not divide in the 
normal cornea of an adult human. Some studies have suggested that a stem cell 
population for the corneal endothelium exists. This population could give rise 
to mature corneal endothelial cells and may reside either in the peripheral 
corneal endothelium or in the adjacent posterior limbus. This study was 
initiated to demonstrate the presence of such stem cells in the region of the 
posterior limbus and to show the response of these cells to corneal wounding.
METHODS: Unwounded and wounded corneas with their attached limbal sections were 
analyzed by immunofluorescence for the presence of nestin, telomerase, Oct-3/4, 
Pax-6, Wnt-1, and Sox-2. Alkaline phosphatase activity was observed with an 
enzyme-based reaction that produced a fluorescent product.
RESULTS: In the unwounded cornea, stem cell markers nestin, alkaline 
phosphatase, and telomerase were found in the trabecular meshwork (TM) and in 
the transition zone between the TM and the corneal endothelial periphery 
(including Schwalbe's line). Telomerase was also present in the peripheral 
corneal endothelium. When wounded corneas and their attached limbii were tested, 
the same markers were found. However, after wounding, additional stem cell 
markers, Oct-3/4 (in the TM) and Wnt-1 (in both the TM and the transition zone), 
appeared. Moreover, the differentiation markers Pax-6 and Sox-2 were seen. Pax-6 
and Sox-2 were also manifest in the peripheral endothelium post-wounding.
CONCLUSIONS: Well documented specific stem cell markers were found in the TM and 
the transition zone of the human posterior limbus. Wounding of the corneas 
activated the production of two additional stem cell markers (Oct-3/4, Wnt-1) as 
well as two differentiation markers (Pax-6, Sox-2), the latter of which also 
appeared in the corneal endothelial periphery. It is suggested that stem cells 
reside in the posterior limbus and respond to corneal wounding to initiate an 
endothelial repair process. The stem cells may also contribute to a normal, slow 
replacement of corneal endothelial cells.
