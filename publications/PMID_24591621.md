Mutation in leucine-rich-repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a common cause of Parkinson 
disease (PD). A disease-causing point mutation R1441H/G/C in the GTPase domain 
of LRRK2 leads to overactivation of its kinase domain. However, the mechanism by 
which this mutation alters the normal function of its GTPase domain [Ras of 
complex proteins (Roc)] remains unclear. Here, we report the effects of R1441H 
mutation (RocR1441H) on the structure and activity of Roc. We show that Roc 
forms a stable monomeric conformation in solution that is catalytically active, 
thus demonstrating that LRRK2 is a bona fide self-contained GTPase. We further 
show that the R1441H mutation causes a twofold reduction in GTPase activity 
without affecting the structure, thermal stability, and GDP-binding affinity of 
Roc. However, the mutation causes a twofold increase in GTP-binding affinity of 
Roc, thus suggesting that the PD-causing mutation R1441H traps Roc in a more 
persistently activated state by increasing its affinity for GTP and, at the same 
time, compromising its GTP hydrolysis.
