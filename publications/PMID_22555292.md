Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a late onset-disease characterized 
by skeletal muscle wasting and heart defects with associated risk of sudden 
death. The autosomal dominant form of the disease is caused by mutations in the 
LMNA gene encoding LaminA and C, the X-linked form results from mutations in the 
gene encoding the inner nuclear membrane protein Emerin (STA). Both Emerin and 
LaminA/C interact with the nuclear envelope proteins Nesprin-1 and -2 and 
mutations in genes encoding C-terminal isoforms of Nesprin-1 and -2 have also 
been implicated in EDMD. Here we analyse primary fibroblasts from patients 
affected by either Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or Emery-Dreifuss muscular 
dystrophy/Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (EDMD/CMT) that in addition to the 
disease causing mutations harbour mutations in the Nesprin-1 gene and in the 
SUN1 and SUN2 gene, respectively. SUN proteins together with the Nesprins form 
the core of the LINC complex which connects the nucleus with the cytoskeleton. 
The mutations are accompanied by changes in cell adhesion, cell migration, 
senescence, and stress response, as well as in nuclear shape and nuclear 
envelope composition which are changes characteristic for laminopathies. Our 
results point to a potential influence of mutations in components of the LINC 
complex on the clinical outcome and the molecular pathology in the patients.
