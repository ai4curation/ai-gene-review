The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the SOX trio genes 
(SOX-5, SOX-6, and SOX-9) have a lower level of expression during the 
chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) compared with 
chondrocytes and that the electroporation-mediated gene transfer of SOX trio 
promotes chondrogenesis from human MSCs. An in vitro pellet culture was carried 
out using MSCs or chondrocytes at passage 3 and analyzed after 7 and 21 days. 
Then, MSCs were transfected with SOX trio genes and analyzed for the expression 
of chondrogenic markers after 21 days of in vitro culture. Without transforming 
growth factor-β1, the untransfected MSCs had a lower level of SOX trio gene and 
protein expression than chondrocytes. However, the level of SOX-9 gene 
expression increased in MSCs when treated with transforming growth factor-β1. 
GAG level significantly increased 7-fold in MSCs co-transfected with SOX trio, 
which was corroborated by Safranin-O staining. SOX trio co-transfection 
significantly increased COL2A1 gene and protein and decreased COL10A1 protein in 
MSCs. It is concluded that the SOX trio have a significantly lower expression in 
human MSCs than in chondrocytes and that the electroporation-mediated 
co-transfection of SOX trio enhances chondrogenesis and suppresses hypertrophy 
of human MSCs.
