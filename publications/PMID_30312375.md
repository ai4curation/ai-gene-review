We read with great interest the article recently published in Brain by Nibbeling et al. (2017 ) reporting five novel spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) genes— FAT2 , PLD3 , KIF26B , EP300 and FAT1 —identified by exome sequencing and targeted resequencing of exome candidates in genetically undiagnosed families with autosomal dominant SCA. Of particular interest for us was the identification of a point mutation, presumably leading to loss of function, in PLD3 (coding for phospholipase D3). This new variant was assigned as SCA46 (OMIM #617770). We recently characterized PLD3 as a resident lysosomal protein that is synthesized as a transmembrane protein that undergoes proteolytic cleavage, thereby releasing a stable soluble lysosomal enzyme with 5′ exonuclease activity ( Gavin et al. , 2018 ; Gonzalez et al. , 2018 ).

While there is little doubt about the genetic data, we have concerns regarding the cell biology follow up experiments, particularly the localization studies and functional assay for PLD3 performed by Nibbeling et al. Importantly, we generated PLD3 knockout (KO) mice that do not present signs of cerebellar degeneration or spinocerebellar ataxia, challenging the interpretation of the suggested loss-of-function mechanism or PLD3 as the SCA46-causative gene.

Impaired lysosomal delivery, proteolytic processing and loss of function of the PLD3-L308P mutation. ( A ) Confocal microscopy of HeLa cells transfected with the PLD3-WT or PLD3-L308P mutation followed by staining with the indicated antibodies. Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for co-localization for the indicated antibodies is depicted; n = 12 cells. ( B ) Immunoblot of PLD3-WT or PLD3-L308P mutation with indicated PLD3-specific antibodies and GAPDH. Quantification of the fragments relative to full-length protein is shown. UT = untransfected. ( C ) Ethidium-bromide stained polyacrylamide gel analysis of untreated ssDNA substrate and treated with untransfected HeLa cell lysates or transfected with PLD3-WT or PLD3-L308P-mutation transfected HeLa cell lysates. Quantification represents n = 3. *** P < 0.001; ns = not significant.

PLD3 expression in the cerebellum is low and PLD3 KO mice do not show any signs of cerebellar degeneration. ( A ) Immunoblot analysis of PLD3 expression in different brain regions of adult wild-type mice with an antibody against the N-terminus of PLD3; n = 3. ( B ) Targeting vector for PLD3 LacZ reporter and PLD3 KO mice. ( C ) β-Galactosidase activity in different brain regions of an adult PLD3-reporter mouse with X-Gal as colorimetric substrate. ( D ) Immunoblot analysis of brain lysates with an antibody against the N-terminus of PLD3. ( E ) Photograph of the brain of wild-type and PLD3 KO mice, 20 months old. ( F ) Calbindin-immunofluorescence of the cerebellum of a wild-type and a PLD3 KO mouse, 20 months old. ( G ) Immunofluorescence staining for calbindin (red), GFAP (green) of the molecular layer in lobule IV of 20-month-old wild-type and PLD3 KO mice. Nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue). ( H ) Rotarod latency in 5- and 9-month-old animals ( n = 9–11).

Nibbeling et al. show a reduced phospholipase D (PLD) activity for PLD3-L308P. However, we failed to show PLD activity even for PLD3-WT (unpublished). To investigate possible changes on the lipid profile of the brain due to impaired catabolism of possible PLD3 substrates, we performed shotgun lipidomics on brain lysates covering 285 lipids ( Supplementary Table 1 ). We did not observe any major changes for lipid species associated with PLD activity, neither on substrates nor products site including phosphatidic acid species or phosphatidylcholine. This result rather shows that PLD3 does not perform a typical PLD activity.

In summary our data support the finding by Nibbeling et al. that the PLD3-L308P mutation leads to a loss of function. We show that PLD3 is not an ER-resident protein and is localized and active in lysosomes acting as a 5′ exonuclease. The PLD3 mutation leads to ER retention and lack of nuclease function. Importantly, the loss of PLD3 does not interfere with lipid catabolism. Our PLD3 KO mouse analysis challenges the interpretation of PLD3 mutations as the causative SCA46 gene and further characterization of additional patients will be required to clarify a role of PLD3 in spinocerebellar ataxia.

The authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and its supplementary material.
