Nodal, a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, has been 
recently shown to suppress cell proliferation and to stimulate the expression of 
cyclin G2 (CCNG2) in human epithelial ovarian cancer cells. However, the precise 
mechanisms underlying these events are not fully understood. In this study, we 
investigated the transcriptional regulation of CCNG2 by the Nodal signaling 
pathway. In ovarian cancer cells, overexpression of Nodal or its receptors, 
activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7) or ALK4, resulted in an increase in the 
CCNG2 promoter activity. Several putative Forkhead box class O (FoxO)3a-binding 
sites are present in the human CCNG2 promoter and overexpression of FoxO3a 
enhanced the CCNG2 promoter activity. The functional FoxO3a-binding element 
(FBE) was mapped to a proximal region located between -398 and -380 bp (FBE1) 
through deletion and mutation analyses, as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation 
(IP) assay. Interestingly, mutation of the FBE1 not only abolished the effect of 
FoxO3a, but also blocked Nodal-induced CCNG2 transcription. Nodal stimulated 
FoxO3a mRNA and protein expression through the canonical Smad pathway and 
suppressed FoxO3a inactivation by inhibiting AKT activity. Silencing of FoxO3a 
using small interfering RNA significantly reduced the effect of Nodal on the 
CCNG2 promoter activity. On the other hand, overexpression of Smad2 and Smad3 
enhanced the FoxO3a-induced CCNG2 promoter activity whereas knockdown of Smad4 
blocked the activity of FoxO3a. Furthermore, IP assays revealed that FoxO3a 
formed complexes with Smad proteins and that Nodal enhanced the binding of 
FoxO3a to the CCNG2 promoter. Finally, silencing of FoxO3a reversed the 
inhibitory effect of Nodal on cell proliferation. Taken together, these findings 
demonstrated that Nodal signaling promotes CCNG2 transcription by upregulating 
FoxO3a expression, inhibiting FoxO3a phosphorylation and enhancing its 
synergistic interaction with Smads. These results also suggest that FoxO3a is an 
important mediator of Nodal signaling in ovarian cancer cells.
