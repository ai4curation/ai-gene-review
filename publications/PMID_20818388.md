Mammalian ageing is accompanied by accumulation of genomic DNA damage and 
progressive decline in the ability of tissues to regenerate. DNA damage 
activates the tumour suppressor p53, which leads to cell-cycle arrest, 
senescence or apoptosis. The stability and activity of p53 are induced by DNA 
damage through posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation of Thr 21 
and Ser 23 (refs 2, 3, 4, 5). To investigate the roles of DNA damage and p53 in 
tissue-regenerative capability, two phosphorylation-site mutations (T21D and 
S23D) were introduced into the endogenous p53 gene in mice, so that the 
synthesized protein mimics phosphorylated p53. The knock-in mice exhibit 
constitutive p53 activation and segmental progeria that is correlated with the 
depletion of adult stem cells in multiple tissues, including bone marrow, brain 
and testes. Furthermore, a deficiency of Puma, which is required for 
p53-dependent apoptosis after DNA damage, rescues segmental progeria and 
prevents the depletion of adult stem cells. These findings suggest a key role of 
p53-dependent apoptosis in depleting adult stem cells after the accumulation of 
DNA damage, which leads to a decrease in tissue regeneration.

Abstract

Mammalian ageing is accompanied by accumulation of genomic DNA damage and progressive decline in the ability of tissues to regenerate 1 . DNA damage activates the tumour suppressor p53, which leads to cell-cycle arrest, senescence or apoptosis. The stability and activity of p53 are induced by DNA damage through posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation of Thr 21 and Ser 23 (refs 2 â€“ 5 ). To investigate the roles of DNA damage and p53 in tissue-regenerative capability, two phosphorylation-site mutations (T21D and S23D) were introduced into the endogenous p53 gene in mice, so that the synthesized protein mimics phosphorylated p53. The knock-in mice exhibit constitutive p53 activation and segmental progeria that is correlated with the depletion of adult stem cells in multiple tissues, including bone marrow, brain and testes. Furthermore, a deficiency of Puma, which is required for p53-dependent apoptosis after DNA damage 6 , rescues segmental progeria and prevents the depletion of adult stem cells. These findings suggest a key role of p53-dependent apoptosis in depleting adult stem cells after the accumulation of DNA damage, which leads to a decrease in tissue regeneration.

Statistical methods

For the survival curve, Prism5 software (GraphPad) was used to generate the Kaplan-Meier survival curve. For most presented data, mean values from multiple independently obtained data are shown with s.d. Two-tailed P values were obtained from a t -test with paired or unpaired samples using Excel (Microsoft).
