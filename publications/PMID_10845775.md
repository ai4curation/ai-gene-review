Embryonic sensory and sympathetic neurons that lack neurofibromin, the protein 
product of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nfl) gene, survive and extend neurites 
in the absence of neurotrophins. To determine whether neurofibromin negatively 
regulates neurotrophin signaling through its interaction with p21ras, we used 
Fab antibody fragments to block Ras function in DRG, trigeminal, nodose, and SCG 
neurons isolated from Nfl(-/-) and wild-type mouse embryos. We show that 
introduction of anti-Ras Fab fragments significantly reduces the ability of 
neurofibromin-deficient neurons to survive in the absence of neurotrophins. 
Moreover, addition of H-ras protein enhances the survival of Nfl(-/-), but not 
wild-type, DRG neurons. Our results are consistent with a major role for 
neurofibromin in modulating Trk signaling through p21ras during neuronal 
development.
