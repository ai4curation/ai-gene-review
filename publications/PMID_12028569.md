Arabidopsis COP1 is a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis, which targets 
HY5, a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis, for degradation via the 
proteasome pathway in the absence of light. COP1 and its interactive partner 
CIP8 both possess RING finger motifs, characteristic of some E3 ubiquitin 
ligases. Here we show that CIP8 promotes ubiquitin attachment to HY5 in 
E2-dependent fashion in vitro. CIP8 exhibits a strong interaction with the E2 
enzyme AtUBC8 through its N-terminal domain. Phosphorylation of HY5 by casein 
kinase II requires the beta subunit 2, but does not affect HY5's susceptibility 
to ubiquitination. The RING domain of CIP8 is required but is not sufficient for 
ubiquitin ligase activity. Although the RING domain of CIP8 interacts with the 
RING domain of COP1, addition of recombinant COP1 fails to affect CIP8's 
ubiquitin ligase activity towards HY5 in vitro. However, recombinant COP1 can 
pull-down native CIP8 from the extract of dark-grown seedlings, but not from the 
extract of light-grown seedlings in a column-binding assay, implying a 
requirement for light-regulated modification in vivo. Our data suggest that CIP8 
can form a minimal ubiquitin ligase in co-operation with the E2 enzyme AtUBC8. 
It is possible that the AtUBC8-CIP8 module might interact with COP1 in vivo, 
thereby participating in proteasome-mediated degradation of HY5.
