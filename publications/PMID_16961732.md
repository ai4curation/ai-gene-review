Ethylene is a plant hormone that regulates many aspects of growth and 
development. Despite the well-known association between ethylene and stress 
signalling, its effects on stomatal movements are largely unexplored. Here, 
genetic and physiological data are provided that position ethylene into the 
Arabidopsis guard cell signalling network, and demonstrate a functional link 
between ethylene and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). In wild-type leaves, ethylene 
induces stomatal closure that is dependent on H(2)O(2) production in guard 
cells, generated by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen 
(NADPH) oxidase AtrbohF. Ethylene-induced closure is inhibited by the ethylene 
antagonists 1-MCP and silver. The ethylene receptor mutants etr1-1 and etr1-3 
are insensitive to ethylene in terms of stomatal closure and H(2)O(2) 
production. Stomata of the ethylene signalling ein2-1 and arr2 mutants do not 
close in response to either ethylene or H(2)O(2) but do generate H(2)O(2) 
following ethylene challenge. Thus, the data indicate that ethylene and H(2)O(2) 
signalling in guard cells are mediated by ETR1 via EIN2 and ARR2-dependent 
pathway(s), and identify AtrbohF as a key mediator of stomatal responses to 
ethylene.
