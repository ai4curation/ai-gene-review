Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), a phosphorylated protein present in the mineral 
phase of both vertebrates and invertebrates, is a key regulatory protein during 
biogenic formation of mineral deposits. Previously we showed that DMP1 is 
localized in the nuclear compartment of preosteoblasts and preodontoblasts. In 
the nucleus DMP1 might play an important role in the regulation of genes that 
control osteoblast or odontoblast differentiation. Here, we show that cellular 
uptake of DMP1 occurs through endocytosis. Interestingly, this process is 
initiated by DMP1 binding to the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP-78) localized 
on the plasma membrane of preodontoblast cells. Binding of DMP1 to GRP-78 
receptor was determined to be specific and saturable with a binding dissociation 
constant K(D)=85 nm. We further depict a road map for the endocytosed DMP1 and 
demonstrate that the internalization is mediated primarily by caveolae and that 
the vesicles containing DMP1 are routed to the nucleus along microtubules. 
Immunohistochemical analysis and binding studies performed with biotin-labeled 
DMP1 confirm spatial co-localization of DMP1 and GRP-78 in the preodontoblasts 
of a developing mouse molar. Co-localization of DMP1 with GRP-78 was also 
observed in T4-4 preodontoblast cells, dental pulp stem cells, and primary 
preodontoblasts. By small interfering RNA techniques, we demonstrate that the 
receptor for DMP1 is GRP-78. Therefore, binding of DMP1 with GRP-78 receptor 
might be an important mechanism by which DMP1 is internalized and transported to 
the nucleus during bone and tooth development.
