The cerebellum provides an excellent system for understanding how afferent and 
target neurons coordinate sequential intercellular signals and cell-autonomous 
genetic programs in development. Mutations in the orphan nuclear receptor 
RORalpha block Purkinje cell differentiation with a secondary loss of afferent 
granule cells. We show that early transcriptional targets of RORalpha include 
both mitogenic signals for afferent progenitors and signal transduction genes 
required to process their subsequent synaptic input. RORalpha acts through 
recruitment of gene-specific sets of transcriptional cofactors, including 
beta-catenin, p300, and Tip60, but appears independent of CBP. One target 
promoter is Sonic hedgehog, and recombinant Sonic hedgehog restores granule 
precursor proliferation in RORalpha-deficient cerebellum. Our results suggest a 
link between RORalpha and beta-catenin pathways, confirm that a nuclear receptor 
employs distinct coactivator complexes at different target genes, and provide a 
logic for early RORalpha expression in coordinating expression of genes required 
for reciprocal signals in cerebellar development.

Abstract

The cerebellum provides an excellent system for understanding how afferent and target neurons coordinate sequential intercellular signals and cell-autonomous genetic programs in development. Mutations in the orphan nuclear receptor RORα block Purkinje cell differentiation with a secondary loss of afferent granule cells. We show that early transcriptional targets of RORα include both mitogenic signals for afferent progenitors and signal transduction genes required to process their subsequent synaptic input. RORα acts through recruitment of gene-specific sets of transcriptional cofactors, including β-catenin, p300, and Tip60, but appears independent of CBP. One target promoter is Sonic hedgehog and recombinant Sonic hedgehog restores granule precursor proliferation in RORα-deficient cerebellum. Our results suggest a link between RORα and β-catenin pathways, confirm that a nuclear receptor employs distinct coactivator complexes at different target genes, and provide a logic for early RORα expression in coordinating expression of genes required for reciprocal signals in cerebellar development.

Discussion

It is important to understand the mechanisms by which nuclear receptors mediate events in brain development and the potential unique function of orphan receptors versus liganded receptors. Our findings demonstrate an important role for RORα in the transcriptional coordination of sequential signaling pathways during cerebellar development and suggest a preliminary model for the reciprocal nature of these pathways ( Figure 8A ) and a mechanistic model for RORα-regulated expression of the component genes ( Figure 8B ). Identification of the earliest RORα-dependent genes suggests that RORα coordinates expression of both an outgoing Shh signal to granule cell precursors and a series of genes required to receive and interpret excitatory input from the mature granules that result. These are the earliest known effects of RORα and precede morphological abnormalities in the RORα-deficient cerebellum. RORα directly binds to the promoters of all five of the early target genes we tested. Intriguingly, the coactivators recruited in an RORα-dependent fashion exhibit target gene specificity, revealing additional patterns of coactivator usage for a nuclear receptor. Further, RORα is required to recruit β-catenin to the Shh promoter, suggesting the possibility that RORα mediates an unexpected link between the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and Shh expression. This analysis provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of RORα and sheds new light on the genetic architecture of Purkinje cell differentiation.
