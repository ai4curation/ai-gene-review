Dosage compensation equalizes X-linked gene expression between the sexes. This 
process is achieved in Caenorhabditis elegans by hermaphrodite-specific, dosage 
compensation complex (DCC)-mediated, 2-fold X chromosome downregulation. How the 
DCC downregulates gene expression is not known. By analyzing the distribution of 
histone modifications in nuclei using quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we 
found that H4K16 acetylation (H4K16ac) is underrepresented and H4K20 
monomethylation (H4K20me1) is enriched on hermaphrodite X chromosomes in a 
DCC-dependent manner. Depletion of H4K16ac also requires the conserved histone 
deacetylase SIR-2.1, while enrichment of H4K20me1 requires the activities of the 
histone methyltransferases SET-1 and SET-4. Our data suggest that the mechanism 
of dosage compensation in C. elegans involves redistribution of 
chromatin-modifying activities, leading to a depletion of H4K16ac and an 
enrichment of H4K20me1 on the X chromosomes. These results support conserved 
roles for histone H4 chromatin modification in worm dosage compensation 
analogous to those seen in flies, using similar elements and opposing strategies 
to achieve differential 2-fold changes in X-linked gene expression.
