Structural resolution of protein interactions enables mechanistic and functional 
studies as well as interpretation of disease variants. However, structural data 
is still missing for most protein interactions because we lack computational and 
experimental tools at scale. This is particularly true for interactions mediated 
by short linear motifs occurring in disordered regions of proteins. We find that 
AlphaFold-Multimer predicts with high sensitivity but limited specificity 
structures of domain-motif interactions when using small protein fragments as 
input. Sensitivity decreased substantially when using long protein fragments or 
full length proteins. We delineated a protein fragmentation strategy 
particularly suited for the prediction of domain-motif interfaces and applied it 
to interactions between human proteins associated with neurodevelopmental 
disorders. This enabled the prediction of highly confident and likely 
disease-related novel interfaces, which we further experimentally corroborated 
for FBXO23-STX1B, STX1B-VAMP2, ESRRG-PSMC5, PEX3-PEX19, PEX3-PEX16, and 
SNRPB-GIGYF1 providing novel molecular insights for diverse biological 
processes. Our work highlights exciting perspectives, but also reveals clear 
limitations and the need for future developments to maximize the power of 
Alphafold-Multimer for interface predictions.
