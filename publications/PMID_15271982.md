Nucling is a novel protein isolated from murine embryonal carcinoma cells with 
an up-regulated expression during cardiac muscle differentiation. We show here 
that Nucling was up-regulated by proapoptotic stimuli and important for the 
induction of apoptosis after cytotoxic stress. We further demonstrated that 
overexpressed Nucling was able to induce apoptosis. In Nucling-deficient cells, 
the expression levels of Apaf-1 and cytochrome c, which are the major components 
of an apoptosis-promoting complex named apoptosome, were both down-regulated 
under cellular stress. A deficiency of Nucling also conferred resistance to 
apoptotic stress on the cell. After UV irradiation, Nucling was shown to reside 
in an Apaf-1/pro-caspase-9 complex, suggesting that Nucling might be a key 
molecule for the formation and maintenance of this complex. Nucling induced 
translocation of Apaf-1 to the nucleus, thereby distributing the 
Nucling/Apaf-1/pro-caspase-9 complex to the nuclear fraction. These findings 
suggest that Nucling recruits and transports the apoptosome complex during 
stress-induced apoptosis.
