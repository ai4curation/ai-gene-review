The mechanisms by which apoptosis is prevented by survival factors are largely 
unknown. Using an interaction cloning approach, we identified a protein that 
binds to the intracellular domain of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) 
receptor. This protein was identified as BAG-1, a recently characterized Bcl-2 
functional partner, which prolongs cell survival through unknown mechanisms. 
Overexpression of BAG-1 in liver progenitor cells enhances protection from 
apoptosis by HGF. Association of the receptor with BAG-1 occurs in intact cells, 
is mediated by the C-terminal region of BAG-1 and is independent from tyrosine 
phosphorylation of the receptor. Formation of the complex is increased rapidly 
following induction of apoptosis. BAG-1 also enhances platelet-derived growth 
factor (PDGF)-mediated protection from apoptosis and associates with the PDGF 
receptor. Microinjection or transient expression of BAG-1 deletion mutants shows 
that both the N- and the C-terminal domains are required for protection from 
apoptosis. The finding of a link between growth factor receptors and the 
anti-apoptotic machinery fills a gap in the understanding of the molecular 
events regulating programmed cell death.
