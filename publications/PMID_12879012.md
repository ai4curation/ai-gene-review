Noxa is a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family, upregulated by p53 as a response 
to DNA damage. Mutations in the BH3-only region of other BH3-only members lead 
to an inactive protein. We have investigated the mRNA expression of Noxa with 
real-time PCR in 94 unselected colorectal adenocarcinomas and the corresponding 
normal mucosa. Among them, Noxa protein expression was investigated with 
immunohistochemistry in 16 tumors and six corresponding normal mucosa samples. 
Further, we searched for Noxa mutations in all the cases using single-stranded 
conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing. The mRNA expression of Noxa was 
weak in 9% and strong in 2% of the tumors, and decreased in 9% and increased in 
16% of the tumors compared with the normal mucosa; however, these changes did 
not have any clinical or pathological significance. The protein level in most of 
the cases investigated was correlated with the mRNA level. We did not find any 
mutations in the Noxa gene. Thus, we suggest that Noxa may not be of importance 
in the development of colorectal cancer.
