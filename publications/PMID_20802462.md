The molecular networks that control endoplasmic reticulum (ER) redox conditions 
in mammalian cells are incompletely understood. Here, we show that after 
reductive challenge the ER steady-state disulphide content is restored on a time 
scale of seconds. Both the oxidase Ero1α and the oxidoreductase protein 
disulphide isomerase (PDI) strongly contribute to the rapid recovery kinetics, 
but experiments in ERO1-deficient cells indicate the existence of parallel 
pathways for disulphide generation. We find PDI to be the main substrate of 
Ero1α, and mixed-disulphide complexes of Ero1 primarily form with PDI, to a 
lesser extent with the PDI-family members ERp57 and ERp72, but are not 
detectable with another homologue TMX3. We also show for the first time that the 
oxidation level of PDIs and glutathione is precisely regulated. Apparently, this 
is achieved neither through ER import of thiols nor by transport of disulphides 
to the Golgi apparatus. Instead, our data suggest that a dynamic equilibrium 
between Ero1- and glutathione disulphide-mediated oxidation of PDIs constitutes 
an important element of ER redox homeostasis.

Abstract

The molecular networks that control endoplasmic reticulum (ER) redox conditions in mammalian cells are incompletely understood. Here, we show that after reductive challenge the ER steady-state disulphide content is restored on a time scale of seconds. Both the oxidase Ero1α and the oxidoreductase protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) strongly contribute to the rapid recovery kinetics, but experiments in ERO1-deficient cells indicate the existence of parallel pathways for disulphide generation. We find PDI to be the main substrate of Ero1α, and mixed-disulphide complexes of Ero1 primarily form with PDI, to a lesser extent with the PDI-family members ERp57 and ERp72, but are not detectable with another homologue TMX3. We also show for the first time that the oxidation level of PDIs and glutathione is precisely regulated. Apparently, this is achieved neither through ER import of thiols nor by transport of disulphides to the Golgi apparatus. Instead, our data suggest that a dynamic equilibrium between Ero1- and glutathione disulphide-mediated oxidation of PDIs constitutes an important element of ER redox homeostasis.

Introduction

Regulation of the redox environment in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is emerging as an important aspect of cellular homeostasis ( Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007 ; Merksamer et al, 2008 ), and the thiol-disulphide oxidoreductases of the protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) family are central to ER redox control ( Appenzeller-Herzog and Ellgaard, 2008b ). PDIs contain one or more thioredoxin-like domains. These typically harbour a CXXC active-site sequence motif required for the catalysis of thiol-disulphide exchange reactions, such as the introduction of disulphides into substrate proteins.

The identification in yeast of the essential ER-resident sulfhydryl oxidase Ero1p ( Frand and Kaiser, 1998 ; Pollard et al, 1998 ), which oxidizes PDI ( Frand and Kaiser, 1999 ; Tu et al, 2000 ) and reduces molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide ( Gross et al, 2006 ), has led to an improved understanding of oxidative folding and ER redox regulation ( Sevier et al, 2007 ; Sevier and Kaiser, 2008 ). Consistent with an important function in ER protein oxidation, both human isoforms Ero1α and Ero1β are transcriptionally upregulated by the ER stress response ( Pagani et al, 2000 ; Marciniak et al, 2004 ), which can be associated with a reductive shift in the ER redox conditions ( Nadanaka et al, 2007 ; Merksamer et al, 2008 ). Moreover, the activity of Ero1α is subject to negative feedback regulation by intramolecular disulphide bonds ( Appenzeller-Herzog et al, 2008 ; Baker et al, 2008 ). The enzyme appears in at least three redox forms: reduced, OX1 and OX2 ( Benham et al, 2000 ). The latter is the most oxidized form with all regulatory disulphide bonds in place ( Appenzeller-Herzog et al, 2008 ; our unpublished observations). The cellular activation state of Ero1α is controlled by the availability of reduced PDI ( Appenzeller-Herzog et al, 2008 ), which can reduce the regulatory disulphide bonds (see also Discussion) ( Sevier et al, 2007 ; Appenzeller-Herzog et al, 2008 ; Baker et al, 2008 ). Ero1α also controls calcium fluxes from ER to mitochondria ( Li et al, 2009 ), which could correlate with its partial localization at mitochondria-associated ER membrane domains ( Gilady et al, 2010 ).

The dominance of Ero1 enzymes in providing the oxidizing equivalents for the synthesis of disulphides is, however, still a matter of debate ( Thorpe and Kodali, 2010 ). For instance, the slow in vitro rate of PDI oxidation by Ero1α ( Baker et al, 2008 ; Wang et al, 2009 ) appears at odds with a principal function in disulphide-bond generation. Knockout of the single Ero1 gene in fruit fly causes a specific defect in Notch signalling while apparently leaving the bulk disulphide-bond repertoire unperturbed ( Tien et al, 2008 ). Most importantly, however, Ero1α and Ero1β appear non-essential in the mouse, as evidenced by the viability of an Ero1α/Ero1β double mutant ( Zito et al, 2010 ). Indeed, several possible Ero1-independent pathways for disulphide generation and/or the oxidation of PDI in the ER of mammalian cells exist ( Margittai and Banhegyi, 2010 ). These include the activity of quiescin-sulfhydryl oxidases ( Thorpe and Kodali, 2010 ), import of dehydroascorbate from the cytosol and its reduction by dithiol groups ( Saaranen et al, 2010 ), ER-luminal detoxification of NADPH oxidase 4-generated hydrogen peroxide ( Santos et al, 2009 ) and a pathway that uses the oxidizing equivalents of radicals derived from mitochondrial respiration to generate disulphides in secretory compartments ( Yang et al, 2007 ). In analogy to a mechanism that operates in both archaea and bacteria ( Dutton et al, 2008 ; Singh et al, 2008 ), PDI could also be oxidized through the vitamin K cycle ( Wajih et al, 2007 ). Currently, we lack a thorough cell biological understanding of these pathways in relation to oxidative folding in the ER.

In addition to the PDIs and Ero1, glutathione also has a fundamental function in ER redox homeostasis. This low-molecular weight thiol compound exists as a mixture of reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulphide (GSSG). Cytosol-derived GSH can enter the ER where its reducing power is required for the rearrangement of aberrant disulphide bonds in folding substrates ( Chakravarthi et al, 2006 ).

On these premises, we decided to further explore the links between Ero1, PDIs and glutathione in cultured human cells. Our work shows a very rapid production of disulphides in the ER whose velocity depends on both Ero1α and PDI, but apparently less so on other PDI-family members. In cells devoid of both Ero1α and β, however, we present evidence for Ero1-independent pathway(s) for thiol oxidation. Finally, we show that ER oxidation is tightly regulated and propose a mechanistic model of ER redox homeostasis that integrates previous and current findings.
