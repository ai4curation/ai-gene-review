The glycoprotein clusterin has recently entered the scientific arena in diverse 
guises. It forms high-density lipoprotein complexes with apolipoprotein A-I, 
participates in the terminal complement reaction and serves as a granule 
constituent in neuronal and endocrine cells. Apically secreted, it is also found 
in the male reproductive tract and the tubular lumen of epithelial ducts. Thus, 
it may serve important functions in tissue remodelling, immune defense and 
transport of biologically active peptides.
