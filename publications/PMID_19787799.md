Combined deficiency of coagulation factor V (FV) and factor VIII (FVIII) (F5F8D) 
is an inherited bleeding disorder characterized by a reduction in plasma 
concentrations of FV and FVIII. F5F8D is genetically linked to mutations in 
either LMAN1 or MCFD2. Here, we investigated the molecular basis of F5F8D in a 
Japanese patient, and identified a novel missense mutation (p.Trp67Ser, 
c.200G>C) in the LMAN1, but no mutation in the MCFD2. The amount of LMAN1 in 
Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoblasts from the patient was found to be 
almost the same as that in cells from a normal individual. Interestingly, an 
anti-MCFD2 antibody did not co-immunoprecipitate the mutant LMAN1 with MCFD2 in 
lymphoblasts from the patient, suggesting the affinity of MCFD2 for the mutant 
LMAN1 is weak or abolished by the binding of the anti-MCFD2 antibody. In 
addition, a Myc/6xHis-tagged recombinant form of wild-type LMAN1 could bind to 
D-mannose, but that of the mutant could not. The p.Trp67Ser mutation was located 
in the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which is thought to participate in 
the selective binding of LMAN1 to the D-mannose of glycoproteins as well as the 
EF-motif of MCFD2. Taken together, it was suggested that the p.Trp67Ser mutation 
might affect the molecular chaperone function of LMAN1, impairing affinity for 
D-mannose as well as for MCFD2, which may be responsible for F5F8D in the 
patient. This is the first report of F5F8D caused by a qualitative defect of 
LMAN1 due to a missense mutation in LMAN1. Am. J. Hematol. 2009. (c) 2009
