P-type ATPase are present in nearly all organisms. They maintain electrochemical 
gradients for many solutes, in particular ions, they control membrane lipid 
asymmetry, and are crucial components of intricate signaling networks. All 
P-type ATPases share a common topology with a transmembrane and three 
cytoplasmic domains and their transport cycle follows a general scheme - the 
Post-Albers-cycle. Recently, P-type ATPase research has been advanced most 
significantly by the technological advancements in cryo-EM analysis, which has 
elucidated many new P-type ATPase structures and mechanisms and revealed several 
new ways of regulation. In this review, we highlight the progress of the field 
and focus on special features that are present in the five subfamilies. Hence, 
we outline the new intersubunit transport model of KdpFABC, the ways in which 
heavy metal pumps have evolved to accommodate various substrates, the strategies 
Ca2+ pumps utilize to adapt to different environmental needs, the intricate 
molecular builds of the ion binding sites in Na,K- and H,K-ATPases, the 
remarkable hexameric assembly of fungal proton pumps, the many ways in which 
P4-ATPase lipid flippases are regulated, and finally the deorphanization of P5 
pumps. Interestingly many of the described features are found in more than one 
of the five subfamilies, and mixed and matched together to provide optimal 
function and precise regulation.
