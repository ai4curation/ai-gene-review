Mutations of HSPB5 (also known as CRYAB or αB-crystallin), a bona fide heat 
shock protein and molecular chaperone encoded by the HSPB5 (crystallin, alpha B) 
gene, are linked to multisystem disorders featuring variable combinations of 
cataracts, cardiomyopathy, and skeletal myopathy. This study aimed to 
investigate the pathological mechanisms involved in an early-onset myofibrillar 
myopathy manifesting in a child harboring a homozygous recessive mutation in 
HSPB5, 343delT. To study HSPB5 343delT protein dynamics, we utilize model cell 
culture systems including induced pluripotent stem cells derived from the 
343delT patient (343delT/343delT) along with isogenic, heterozygous, 
gene-corrected control cells (WT KI/343delT) and BHK21 cells, a cell line 
lacking endogenous HSPB5 expression. 343delT/343delT and WT KI/343delT-induced 
pluripotent stem cell-derived skeletal myotubes and cardiomyocytes did not 
express detectable levels of 343delT protein, contributable to the extreme 
insolubility of the mutant protein. Overexpression of HSPB5 343delT resulted in 
insoluble mutant protein aggregates and induction of a cellular stress response. 
Co-expression of 343delT with WT prevented visible aggregation of 343delT and 
improved its solubility. Additionally, in vitro refolding of 343delT in the 
presence of WT rescued its solubility. We demonstrate an interaction between WT 
and 343delT both in vitro and within cells. These data support a 
loss-of-function model for the myopathy observed in the patient because the 
insoluble mutant would be unavailable to perform normal functions of HSPB5, 
although additional gain-of-function effects of the mutant protein cannot be 
excluded. Additionally, our data highlight the solubilization of 343delT by WT, 
concordant with the recessive inheritance of the disease and absence of symptoms 
in carrier individuals.
