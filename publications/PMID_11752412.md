Histone methylation has emerged as an important mechanism for regulating the 
transcriptional accessibility of chromatin. Several methyltransferases have been 
shown to target histone amino-terminal tails and mark nucleosomes associated 
with either euchromatic or heterochromatic states. However, the biochemical 
machinery responsible for regulating histone methylation and integrating it with 
other cellular events has not been well characterized. We report here the 
purification, molecular identification, and genetic and biochemical 
characterization of the Set1 protein complex that is necessary for methylation 
of histone H3 at lysine residue 4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The seven-member 
363-kDa complex contains homologs of Drosophila melanogaster proteins Ash2 and 
Trithorax and Caenorhabditis elegans protein DPY-30, which are implicated in the 
maintenance of Hox gene expression and regulation of X chromosome dosage 
compensation, respectively. Mutations of Set1 protein comparable to those that 
disrupt developmental function of its Drosophila homolog Trithorax abrogate 
histone methylation in yeast. These studies suggest that epigenetic regulation 
of developmental and sex-specific gene expression are species-specific readouts 
for a common chromatin remodeling machinery associated mechanistically with 
histone methylation.
