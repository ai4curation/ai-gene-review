Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
neurodegeneration and diabetes mellitus. The gene responsible for the syndrome 
(WFS1) encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane protein that 
also localizes to secretory granules in pancreatic beta cells. Although its 
precise functions are unknown, WFS1 protein deficiency affects the unfolded 
protein response, intracellular ion homeostasis, cell cycle progression and 
granular acidification. In this study, immunofluorescent and electron-microscopy 
analyses confirmed that WFS1 also localizes to secretory granules in human 
neuroblastoma cells. We demonstrated a novel interaction between WFS1 and the 
V1A subunit of the H(+) V-ATPase (proton pump) by co-immunoprecipitation in 
human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and with endogenous proteins in human 
neuroblastoma cells. We mapped the interaction to the WFS1-N terminal, but not 
the C-terminal domain. V1A subunit expression was reduced in WFS1 stably and 
transiently depleted human neuroblastoma cells and depleted NT2 (human 
neuron-committed teratocarcinoma) cells. This reduced expression was not 
restored by adenoviral overexpression of BiP (immunoglobulin-binding protein) to 
correct the ER stress. Protein stability assays demonstrated that the V1A 
subunit was degraded more rapidly in WFS1 depleted neuroblastoma cells compared 
with wild-type; however, proteosomal inhibition did not restore the expression 
of the V1A subunit. Cell cycle assays measuring p21(cip) showed reduced levels 
in WFS1 depleted cells, and an inverse association between p21(cip) expression 
and apoptosis. We conclude that WFS1 has a specific interaction with the V1A 
subunit of H(+) ATPase; this interaction may be important both for pump assembly 
in the ER and for granular acidification.
