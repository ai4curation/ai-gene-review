Activation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is initiated by a 
multiprotein complex formation between FGF, FGF receptor (FGFR), and heparan 
sulfate proteoglycan on the cell membrane. Cross-talk with other factors could 
affect this complex assembly and modulate the biological response of cells to 
FGF. We have previously demonstrated that anosmin-1, a glycosylated 
extracellular matrix protein, interacts with the FGFR1 signaling complex and 
enhances its activity in an IIIc isoform-specific and HS-dependent manner. The 
molecular mechanism of anosmin-1 action on FGFR1 signaling, however, remains 
unknown. Here, we show that anosmin-1 directly binds to FGFR1 with high 
affinity. This interaction involves domains in the N terminus of anosmin-1 
(cysteine-rich region, whey acidic protein-like domain and the first fibronectin 
type III domain) and the D2-D3 extracellular domains of FGFR1. In contrast, 
anosmin-1 binds to FGFR2IIIc with much lower affinity and displays negligible 
binding to FGFR3IIIc. We also show that FGFR1-bound anosmin-1, although capable 
of binding to FGF2 alone, cannot bind to a FGF2.heparin complex, thus preventing 
FGFR1.FGF2.heparin complex formation. By contrast, heparin-bound anosmin-1 binds 
to pre-formed FGF2.FGFR1 complex, generating an anosmin-1.FGFR1.FGF2.heparin 
complex. Furthermore, a functional interaction between anosmin-1 and the FGFR1 
signaling complex is demonstrated by immunofluorescence co-localization and 
Transwell migration assays where anosmin-1 was shown to induce opposing effects 
during chemotaxis of human neuronal cells. Our study provides molecular and 
cellular evidence for a modulatory action of anosmin-1 on FGFR1 signaling, 
whereby binding of anosmin-1 to FGFR1 and heparin can play a dual role in 
assembly and activity of the ternary FGFR1.FGF2.heparin complex.
