P granules are germ-cell-specific cytoplasmic structures containing RNA and 
protein, and required for proper germ cell development in C. elegans. PGL-1 and 
GLH-1 were previously identified as critical components of P granules. We have 
identified a new P-granule-associated protein, DEPS-1, the loss of which 
disrupts P-granule structure and function. DEPS-1 is required for the proper 
localization of PGL-1 to P granules, the accumulation of glh-1 mRNA and protein, 
and germ cell proliferation and fertility at elevated temperatures. In addition, 
DEPS-1 is required for RNA interference (RNAi) of germline-expressed genes, 
possibly because DEPS-1 promotes the accumulation of RDE-4, a dsRNA-binding 
protein required for RNAi. A genome wide analysis of gene expression in deps-1 
mutant germ lines identified additional targets of DEPS-1 regulation, many of 
which are also regulated by the RNAi factor RDE-3. Our studies suggest that 
DEPS-1 is a key component of the P-granule assembly pathway and that its roles 
include promoting accumulation of some mRNAs, such as glh-1 and rde-4, and 
reducing accumulation of other mRNAs, perhaps by collaborating with RDE-3 to 
generate endogenous short interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs).
