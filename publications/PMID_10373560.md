The Myt1 protein kinase functions to negatively regulate Cdc2-cyclin B complexes 
by phosphorylating Cdc2 on threonine 14 and tyrosine 15. Throughout interphase, 
human Myt1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, whereas 
Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Here we 
report that overproduction of either kinase-active or kinase-inactive forms of 
Myt1 blocked the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of cyclin B1 and caused cells to 
delay in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The COOH-terminal 63 amino acids of 
Myt1 were identified as a Cdc2-cyclin B1 interaction domain. Myt1 mutants 
lacking this domain no longer bound cyclin B1 and did not efficiently 
phosphorylate Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes in vitro. In addition, cells 
overproducing mutant forms of Myt1 lacking the interaction domain exhibited 
normal trafficking of cyclin B1 and unperturbed cell cycle progression. These 
results suggest that the docking of Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes to the COOH 
terminus of Myt1 facilitates the phosphorylation of Cdc2 by Myt1 and that 
overproduction of Myt1 perturbs cell cycle progression by sequestering 
Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes in the cytoplasm.
