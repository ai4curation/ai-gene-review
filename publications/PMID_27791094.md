Dysregulation of human trophoblast invasion and differentiation can result in 
preeclampsia (PE), a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy with significant 
morbidity and mortality for mother and offspring. miRNA microarray analysis of 
RNA from human cytotrophoblasts (CytT), before and after differentiation to 
syncytiotrophoblast (SynT) in primary culture, revealed that members of miR-515 
family-including miR-515-5p, miR-519e-5p, miR-519c-3p, and miR-518f, belonging 
to the primate- and placenta-specific chromosome 19 miRNA cluster (C19MC)-were 
significantly down-regulated upon human SynT differentiation. The 
proto-oncogene, c-MYC, which declines during SynT differentiation, interacted 
with E-boxes upstream of pri-miR-515-1 and pri-miR-515-2, encoding these mRNAs, 
to enhance their expression. Predicted targets of miR-515-5p, known to be 
critical for human SynT differentiation, including hCYP19A1/aromatase P450, 
glial cells missing 1 (GCM1), frizzled 5 (FZD5), WNT2, Sp1, and estrogen 
receptor-α (ERα) mRNA, were markedly up-regulated during SynT differentiation. 
Notably, overexpression of miR-515-5p in cultured primary human trophoblasts 
impaired SynT differentiation and specifically decreased expression of hCYP19A1, 
GCM1, and Fzd5, which were validated as its direct targets. Interestingly, 
miR-515-5p levels were significantly increased in PE placentas, whereas mRNA and 
protein levels of targets, hCYP19A1, GCM1, and FZD5, were significantly 
decreased, compared with placentas of normotensive women. Thus, miR-515-5p may 
serve a key role in human trophoblast differentiation; its aberrant 
up-regulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of PE.

Abstract

Dysregulation of human trophoblast invasion and differentiation can result in preeclampsia (PE), a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy with significant morbidity and mortality for mother and offspring. miRNA microarray analysis of RNA from human cytotrophoblasts (CytT), before and after differentiation to syncytiotrophoblast (SynT) in primary culture, revealed that members of miR-515 family—including miR-515-5p, miR-519e-5p, miR-519c-3p, and miR-518f, belonging to the primate- and placenta-specific chromosome 19 miRNA cluster ( C19MC )—were significantly down-regulated upon human SynT differentiation. The proto-oncogene, c-MYC, which declines during SynT differentiation, interacted with E-boxes upstream of pri-miR-515-1 and pri-miR-515-2 , encoding these mRNAs, to enhance their expression. Predicted targets of miR-515-5p, known to be critical for human SynT differentiation, including hCYP19A1/aromatase P450, glial cells missing 1 (GCM1), frizzled 5 (FZD5), WNT2, Sp1, and estrogen receptor-α (ERα) mRNA, were markedly up-regulated during SynT differentiation. Notably, overexpression of miR-515-5p in cultured primary human trophoblasts impaired SynT differentiation and specifically decreased expression of hCYP19A1, GCM1, and Fzd5, which were validated as its direct targets. Interestingly, miR-515-5p levels were significantly increased in PE placentas, whereas mRNA and protein levels of targets, hCYP19A1, GCM1, and FZD5, were significantly decreased, compared with placentas of normotensive women. Thus, miR-515-5p may serve a key role in human trophoblast differentiation; its aberrant up-regulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of PE.

Discussion

In this study, we made the striking observation that selected members of the C19MC were markedly down-regulated in midgestation human trophoblasts during differentiation to SynT in primary culture. These included members of the miR-515 family ( 33 ), miR-515-5p, miR-519e-5p, miR-519c-3p, and miR-518f. Using luciferase reporter assays, we found that miR-515-5p and miR-519e-5p, which share the same seed sequence, directly targeted hCYP19A1, GCM1, and FZD5, which were significantly induced in concert with the decline of these miRNAs and with SynT differentiation. Importantly, miR-515-5p and miR-519e-5p were significantly up-regulated in placentas of women with PE, compared with gestational age-matched normotensive subjects, whereas their targets were significantly decreased. Although WNT2, ERα, and Sp1 are predicted targets of these miRNAs and were significantly up-regulated during SynT differentiation, we were unable to establish that they are direct targets. On the other hand, ERα mRNA was reported to be directly targeted by members of the miR-17∼92 cluster, miR-18a and miR-19a, in human neuroblastoma cells ( 34 ). These miRNAs were previously found to be markedly down-regulated during differentiation of human trophoblasts in culture ( 18 ) as ERα expression increased ( 15 ).

The C19MC , which is primate-specific, largely placenta-specific, and expressed from the paternally inherited chromosome, spans ∼100 kb of genomic DNA and encodes 46 pri-miRNA genes that are processed into 58 mature miRNAs ( 21 , 23 ). C19MC is also highly expressed in human embryonic stem cells and has been linked to cell proliferation and stemness ( 35 ); expression declines upon stem cell differentiation ( 36 , 37 ). Furthermore, C19MC expression is up-regulated in a number of cancers and has been linked to tumor invasion and metastasis ( 22 , 38 , 39 ). Exosomes secreted by primary human trophoblasts were found to be enriched in miRNAs encoded within the C19MC ( 40 ). Secretion of these exosomal miRNAs has been suggested to play a role in fetoplacental–maternal communication ( 41 ) and to confer viral resistance ( 42 ). Exposure of nonplacental cells to trophoblast-derived, C19MC-enriched exosomes induced autophagy, which may promote degradation of foreign pathogens ( 43 ).

Our present findings, that miR-515-5p directly targeted GCM1 and FZD5, is of great interest. Gcm1 knockout mice die at midgestation because of a complete block of chorionic villous branching and absence of a functional placental labyrinth containing syncytial cells, analogous to the human SynT ( 24 , 44 ). GCM1 induces expression of Syncytin 1 , a gene involved in trophoblast fusion ( 45 ), and regulates expression of placental growth factor ( 46 ). hCYP19A1 promoter I.1 contains a GCM1 response element required for promoter activity ( 17 ). We observed that GCM1 serves an important role in regulating expression of hCYP19A1 and hCGβ during human trophoblast differentiation ( 18 ). Studies using gene-targeted mice further indicated a crucial role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway components in chorion branchpoint initiation, labyrinth development, and in SynT fusion. These studies include knockout of the Wnt receptor Fzd5 ( 26 ), as well as R-spondin3 ( 47 ) and Bcl9l ( 29 ), potentiators of Wnt-β-catenin signaling. Gcm1 up-regulates Fzd5 at sites in the basal chorion where branching is initiated. In turn, Fzd5/β-catenin maintains Gcm1 expression in a positive feedback loop ( 26 ). Interestingly, Gcm1 may promote branching by stimulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in chorionic trophoblasts, by causing decreased expression of tight junction proteins, zona dens-1 and claudins-4 and -7 ( 26 ).

To elucidate mechanisms for down-regulation of miR-515-5p in human trophoblasts during differentiation, we considered the role of c-MYC, which is highly expressed in CytT and declines during SynT differentiation ( 18 ). c-MYC, a basic helix–loop–helix zipper transcription factor, is believed to regulate an estimated 15% of genes in the human genome via binding to E-boxes within target promoters ( 48 ). We previously observed that c-MYC activated expression of the miR-17∼92 cluster and its paralogs ( 18 ), which we found to be significantly down-regulated during SynT differentiation, in association with the fall in c-MYC expression and its binding to their promoters ( 18 ). We observed that miR-17∼92 and paralogous members, miR-19b and miR-106a, directly targeted hCYP19A1 mRNA, whereas miR-19b also targeted GCM1. Overexpression of these miRNAs impaired SynT differentiation ( 18 ). Several members of the miR-17∼92 (miR-17, -19b, -20a) and miR-106a∼363 (miR-19b, -20b) clusters are known to target ERα (ESR1) ( 49 ), which we previously found to be up-regulated during human SynT differentiation and essential for induction of hCYP191A promoter I.1 activity ( 15 ). Placentas from PE women had higher levels of miR-106a and -19b and lower aromatase and GCM1 ( 18 ).

In the present study, we observed that c-MYC overexpression significantly increased miR-515-5p. This observation was associated with a significant decline in hCYP191A, GCM1, and FZD5 mRNA levels. miR-515-5p is encoded by two pri-miRs within C19MC, pri-miR-515-1 and pri-miR-515-2 . Using ChIP-qPCR, we found that endogenous c-MYC bound specifically to E-boxes upstream of pri-miR-515-1 and pri-miR-515-2 in freshly isolated CytT; binding declined in trophoblasts during SynT differentiation. Thus, increased expression of c-MYC in CytT may prevent SynT differentiation, in part, by up-regulating miRNAs in both the C19MC and miR-17∼92 clusters, which target important regulators of branching morphogenesis and cell fusion.

In conclusion, our studies have uncovered an inhibitory role of miR-515-5p, a miRNA within the primate-specific C19MC , in human trophoblast differentiation ( Fig. 5 H ). We observed that miR-515-5p, which was expressed at relatively high levels in CytT, isolated from midgestation human placenta, serves a critical role through its action to inhibit expression of a number of key genes involved in human trophoblast differentiation. Early in the first trimester when the placenta is poorly vascularized and relatively hypoxic, c-MYC expression is enhanced, resulting in increased transcription of the miR-515-1 and miR-515-2 precursors. Increased levels of miR-515-5p were found to directly target both FZD5 and GCM1, which are essential for SynT differentiation ( 26 ).

After ∼10 wk of gestation in the human, increased CytT invasion of the spiral arteries results in increased placental perfusion and enhanced O 2 tension ( Fig. 5 H ). This process is associated with suppression of c-MYC and decreased expression of the miR-515-1 and miR-515-2 precursors, and allows up-regulation of GCM1 and FZD5, which exist in a positive feedforward loop. In turn, Fzd5/β-catenin maintain elevated Gcm1 expression ( 26 ). GCM1 promotes trophoblast fusion, in part via its action to enhance expression of Syncytin 1 ( 45 ). GCM1 also regulates expression of placental growth factor ( 46 ), as well as hCYP19A1/aromatase ( 17 , 18 ), which contribute to SynT differentiation. Notably, increased E 2 has been observed to act via ERα to inhibit miR-515-5p expression ( 50 ). Thus, the up-regulation of E 2 /ERα signaling further suppresses miR-515-5p expression to promote human SynT differentiation. We suggest that aberrant regulation of this signaling pathway interferes with normal induction of trophoblast differentiation, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.
