Human heat shock protein of apparent molecular mass 20 kDa (Hsp20) and its 
mutant, S16D, mimicking phosphorylation by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein 
kinases, were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The proteins were 
obtained in a homogeneous state without utilization of urea or detergents. On 
size exclusion chromatography at neutral pH, Hsp20 and its S16D mutant were 
eluted as symmetrical peaks with an apparent molecular mass of 55-60 kDa. 
Chemical crosslinking resulted in the formation of dimers with an apparent 
molecular mass of 42 kDa. At pH 6.0, Hsp20 and its S16D mutant dissociated, and 
were eluted in the form of two peaks with apparent molecular mass values of 
45-50 and 28-30 kDa. At pH 7.0-7.5, the chaperone activity of Hsp20 (measured by 
its ability to prevent the reduction-induced aggregation of insulin or 
heat-induced aggregation of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase) was similar to or 
higher than that of commercial alpha-crystallin. Under these conditions, the 
S16D mutant of Hsp20 possessed lower chaperone activity than the wild-type 
protein. At pH 6.0, both alpha-crystallin and Hsp20 interacted with denatured 
alcohol dehydrogenase; however, alpha-crystallin prevented, whereas Hsp20 either 
did not affect or promoted, the heat-induced aggregation of alcohol 
dehydrogenase. The mixing of wild-type human Hsp27 and Hsp20 resulted in a slow, 
temperature-dependent formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes, with apparent 
molecular mass values of 100 and 300 kDa, which contained approximately equal 
amounts of Hsp27 and Hsp20 subunits. Phosphorylation of Hsp27 by mitogen 
activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 was mimicked by replacing 
Ser15, 78 and 82 with Asp. A 3D mutant of Hsp27 mixed with Hsp20 rapidly formed 
a hetero-oligomeric complex with an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa, 
containing approximately equal quantities of two small heat shock proteins.
