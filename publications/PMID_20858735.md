ErbB4 is unusual among receptor tyrosine kinases because some isoforms can be 
efficiently cleaved at the plasma membrane to release a soluble intracellular 
domain. The cleavage product has high kinase activity and homes to the nucleus. 
A screen for proteins that associate with the ErbB4 intracellular domain 
identified candidate interactors including ITCH, WWP2, Nucleolin, and 
Krab-associated protein 1 (Kap1). Kap1 binds to multiple isoforms of ErbB4 but 
does not require ErbB4 kinase activity for binding, nor is it an ErbB4 
substrate. Kap1 reduces ERBB4 transcription and either directly or indirectly 
modulates the expression of genes that are themselves regulated by ErbB4. 
Upregulation of ErbB4 and suppression of MDM2 jointly enhance and accelerate the 
accumulation of p21(CIP1) in response to DNA damage. Overall, these findings 
further substantiate the role of ErbB4 in conjoint regulation of growth factor 
signaling and DNA damage responses.
