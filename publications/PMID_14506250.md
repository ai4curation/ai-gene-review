MRGX is a novel transcription factor that is a member of the mortality factor 4 
(MORF4)-related gene family. MRG15, a closely related family member, is in a 
complex with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein Rb and activates the 
B-myb promoter, which is tightly controlled by Rb/E2F through the E2F binding 
site. In this study we investigated the effect of MRGX on the B-myb promoter. 
Interestingly, MRGX repressed the B-myb promoter in EJ cells (human bladder 
carcinoma cells), which have a functional Rb, but activated B-myb in HeLa cells 
(human cervical carcinoma cells), which express a lower amount of Rb. This 
repression and activation was dependent on the helix-loop-helix and leucine 
zipper regions of the MRGX protein but not the N-terminal region. MRGX interacts 
with Rb through the helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper regions. Using a 
treatment of trichostatin A, which is a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase 
(HDAC), we determined that the repression of the B-myb promoter by MRGX in EJ 
cells was dependent on HDAC activity. We confirmed the association of MRGX with 
HDAC1 by immunoprecipitation/Western analysis and determined that MRGX complexes 
had HDAC activity. The data indicate that MRGX can repress or activate the B-myb 
promoter depending on the cell type studied, suggesting that there may be 
tissue-specific functions of this protein.
