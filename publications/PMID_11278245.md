A novel human member of the Bcl-2 family was identified, Bcl-B, which is closest 
in amino acid sequence homology to the Boo (Diva) protein. The Bcl-B protein 
contains four Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains (BH1, BH2, BH3, BH4) and a predicted 
carboxyl-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain. The BCL-B mRNA is widely expressed 
in adult human tissues. The Bcl-B protein binds Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and Bax but not 
Bak. In transient transfection assays, Bcl-B suppresses apoptosis induced by Bax 
but not Bak. Deletion of the TM domain of Bcl-B impairs its association with 
intracellular organelles and diminishes its anti-apoptotic function. Bcl-B thus 
displays a unique pattern of selectivity for binding and regulating the function 
of other members of the Bcl-2 family.
