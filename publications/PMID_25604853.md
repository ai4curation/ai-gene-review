RMND1 is an integral inner membrane mitochondrial protein that assembles into a 
large 240 kDa complex to support translation of the 13 polypeptides encoded on 
mtDNA, all of which are essential subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation 
(OXPHOS) complexes. Variants in RMND1 produce global defects in mitochondrial 
translation and were first reported in patients with severe neurological 
phenotypes leading to mortality in the first months of life. Using whole-exome 
sequencing, we identified compound heterozygous RMND1 variants in a 4-year-old 
patient with congenital lactic acidosis, severe myopathy, hearing loss, renal 
failure, and dysautonomia. The levels of mitochondrial ribosome proteins were 
reduced in patient fibroblasts, causing a translation defect, which was rescued 
by expression of the wild-type cDNA. RMND1 was almost undetectable by immunoblot 
analysis in patient muscle and fibroblasts. BN-PAGE analysis showed a severe 
combined OXPHOS assembly defect that was more prominent in patient muscle than 
in fibroblasts. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that RMND1 localizes to 
discrete foci in the mitochondrial network, juxtaposed to RNA granules where the 
primary mitochondrial transcripts are processed. RMND1 foci were not detected in 
patient fibroblasts. We hypothesize that RMND1 acts to anchor or stabilize the 
mitochondrial ribosome near the sites where the mRNAs are matured, spatially 
coupling post-transcriptional handling mRNAs with their translation, and that 
loss of function variants in RMND1 are associated with a unique constellation of 
clinical phenotypes that vary with the severity of the mitochondrial translation 
defect.
