N-linked glycosylation requires the synthesis of an evolutionarily conserved 
lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor that is essential for glycoprotein 
folding and stability. Despite intense research, several of the enzymes required 
for LLO synthesis have not yet been identified. Here we show that two poorly 
characterized yeast proteins known to be required for the synthesis of the LLO 
precursor, GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol, interact to form an unusual hetero-oligomeric 
UDP-GlcNAc transferase. Alg13 contains a predicted catalytic domain, but lacks 
any membrane-spanning domains. Alg14 spans the membrane but lacks any sequences 
predicted to play a direct role in sugar catalysis. We show that Alg14 functions 
as a membrane anchor that recruits Alg13 to the cytosolic face of the ER, where 
catalysis of GlcNAc2-PP-dol occurs. Alg13 and Alg14 physically interact and 
under normal conditions, are associated with the ER membrane. Overexpression of 
Alg13 leads to its cytosolic partitioning, as does reduction of Alg14 levels. 
Concomitant Alg14 overproduction suppresses this cytosolic partitioning of 
Alg13, demonstrating that Alg14 is both necessary and sufficient for the ER 
localization of Alg13. Further evidence for the functional relevance of this 
interaction comes from our demonstration that the human ALG13 and ALG14 
orthologues fail to pair with their yeast partners, but when co-expressed in 
yeast can functionally complement the loss of either ALG13 or ALG14. These 
results demonstrate that this novel UDP-GlcNAc transferase is a unique 
eukaryotic ER glycosyltransferase that is comprised of at least two functional 
polypeptides, one that functions in catalysis and the other as a membrane 
anchor.
