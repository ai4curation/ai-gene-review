An autofeedback loop associated with transcription of clock gene(s), Per(s), is 
generally accepted as the molecular machinery of circadian rhythm generation, in 
which CLOCK/BMAL act as positive regulators and PER/CRY as negative ones. We 
show here an autofeedback loop of Dec1 encoding a basic helix-loop-helix 
transcription factor: CLOCK/BMAL increased the promoter activity of Dec1, and 
DEC1 and DEC2 as well as PERs and CRYs suppressed the induced expression. Three 
CACGTG E-boxes are responsible for both the activation and the suppression of 
Dec1 transcription. Forced expression of Clock/Bmal increased endogenous Dec1 
mRNA level, and overexpression of Dec1 resulted in suppression of Dec2, Per2, 
and Dbp expression. The level of Dec1 expression in the heart of Clock/Clock 
mutant mice was continuously low throughout the day. These findings suggest that 
Dec1 is positively regulated by CLOCK/BMAL and is involved in circadian rhythm 
regulation by suppressing CLOCK/BMAL-induced gene expression. The autofeedback 
loop of Dec1 may be interlocked with the core feedback loop of Per in some 
situations.
