HMBOX1 is a new member of homeobox family and predicted to be a transcriptional 
repressor, its function in NK cells is completely unclear. Previously we found 
that overexpression of HMBOX1 downregulated mRNA level of IFN-γ in NK cells 
during our gene screening work. In present study, we investigate the 
relationship between HMBOX1 and IFN-γ in detail. Firstly, we describe the 
properties of HMBOX1 gene transcription in activated NK cells, and found that 
the transcriptional levels of HMBOX1 were significantly decreased in NK cells 
after activated by IL-2, IL-15 and IL-12, which was opposite to the expression 
profile of IFN-γ. Subsequently, over-expression of HMBOX1 significantly 
inhibited the expression and production of IFN-γ in NK cells in response to the 
stimulation of tumor cell K562 or PMA/ionomycin. Additionally, by luciferase 
reporter assay, HMBOX1 displayed suppressive effect on the transcription 
activity of IFN-γ promoter. These findings indicated that HMBOX1 may function as 
a negative regulator of IFN-γ in NK cells.
