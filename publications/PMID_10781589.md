The activity of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is regulated by its 
subcellular localization, phosphorylation and through its interaction with 
different proteins. The association of eNOS with caveolin-1 (Cav) is believed to 
maintain eNOS in an inactive state; however, increased association of eNOS to 
heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) is observed following activation. In this study, 
we investigate the relationship between caveolin and hsp90 as opposing 
regulatory proteins on eNOS function. Immunoprecipitation of Cav-1 from bovine 
lung microvascular endothelial cells shows that eNOS and hsp90 are present in 
the Cav-1 complex. eNOS and hsp90 from the lysate also interact with exogenous 
glutathione S-transferase-linked caveolin-1 (GST-Cav), and the addition of 
calcium-activated calmodulin (CaM) to the GST-Cav complex partially inhibited 
the association of eNOS and hsp90. Purified eNOS associates with GST-Cav 
specifically through the caveolin-scaffolding domain (residues 82-101); however, 
the addition of CaM slightly, but nonstatistically, reduces eNOS binding to 
GST-Cav. When hsp90 is present in the binding reaction, the addition of 
increasing concentrations of CaM significantly displaces eNOS and hsp90 from 
GST-Cav. eNOS enzymatic activity is also less sensitive to inhibition by the 
caveolin scaffolding peptide (residues 82-101) when eNOS is prebound to hsp90. 
Collectively, our results show that the actions of CaM on eNOS dissociation from 
caveolin are facilitated in the presence of hsp90.
