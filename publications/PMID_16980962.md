Mutations in the the leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2) gene cause 
autosomal-dominant Parkinson disease and some cases of sporadic Parkinson 
disease. Here we found that LRRK2 kinase activity was regulated by GTP via the 
intrinsic GTPase Roc domain, and alterations of LRRK2 protein that reduced 
kinase activity of mutant LRRK2 correspondingly reduced neuronal toxicity. These 
data elucidate the pathogenesis of LRRK2-linked Parkinson disease, potentially 
illuminate mechanisms of sporadic Parkinson disease and suggest therapeutic 
targets.
