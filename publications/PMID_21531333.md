Arginine methylation is a widespread posttranslational modification of proteins 
catalyzed by a family of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). It is well 
established that PRMTs are implicated in various cellular processes, but their 
physiological roles remain unclear. Using nematodes with a loss-of-function 
mutation, we show that prmt-1, the major asymmetric arginine methyltransferase, 
is a positive regulator of longevity in C. elegans. This regulation is dependent 
on both its enzymatic activity and DAF-16/FoxO transcription factor, which is 
negatively regulated by AKT-mediated phosphorylation downstream of the 
DAF-2/insulin signaling. prmt-1 is also required for stress tolerance and fat 
storage but not dauer formation in daf-2 mutants. Biochemical analyses indicate 
that PRMT-1 methylates DAF-16, thereby blocking its phosphorylation by AKT. 
Disruption of PRMT-1 induces phosphorylation of DAF-16 with a concomitant 
reduction in the expression of longevity-related genes. Thus, we provide a 
mechanism by which asymmetric arginine dimethylation acts as an antiaging 
modification in C. elegans.
