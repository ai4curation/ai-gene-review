The oncoproteins MDM2 and MDMX negatively regulate the activity and stability of 
the tumor suppressor protein p53--a cellular process initiated by MDM2 and/or 
MDMX binding to the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53. MDM2 and MDMX in 
many tumors confer p53 inactivation and tumor survival, and are important 
molecular targets for anticancer therapy. We screened a duodecimal peptide phage 
library against site-specifically biotinylated p53-binding domains of human MDM2 
and MDMX chemically synthesized via native chemical ligation, and identified 
several peptide inhibitors of the p53-MDM2/MDMX interactions. The most potent 
inhibitor (TSFAEYWNLLSP), termed PMI, bound to MDM2 and MDMX at low nanomolar 
affinities--approximately 2 orders of magnitude stronger than the wild-type p53 
peptide of the same length (ETFSDLWKLLPE). We solved the crystal structures of 
synthetic MDM2 and MDMX, both in complex with PMI, at 1.6 A resolution. 
Comparative structural analysis identified an extensive, tightened 
intramolecular H-bonding network in bound PMI that contributed to its 
conformational stability, thus enhanced binding to the 2 oncogenic proteins. 
Importantly, the C-terminal residue Pro of PMI induced formation of a

Abstract

The oncoproteins MDM2 and MDMX negatively regulate the activity and stability of the tumor suppressor protein p53—a cellular process initiated by MDM2 and/or MDMX binding to the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53. MDM2 and MDMX in many tumors confer p53 inactivation and tumor survival, and are important molecular targets for anticancer therapy. We screened a duodecimal peptide phage library against site-specifically biotinylated p53-binding domains of human MDM2 and MDMX chemically synthesized via native chemical ligation, and identified several peptide inhibitors of the p53-MDM2/MDMX interactions. The most potent inhibitor (TSFAEYWNLLSP), termed PMI, bound to MDM2 and MDMX at low nanomolar affinities—approximately 2 orders of magnitude stronger than the wild-type p53 peptide of the same length (ETFSDLWKLLPE). We solved the crystal structures of synthetic MDM2 and MDMX, both in complex with PMI, at 1.6 Å resolution.

Discussion

Inhibition of p53 interactions with the oncogenic proteins MDM2 and MDMX is of important therapeutic value in cancer treatment. However, potent inhibitors active at low nanomolar concentrations against both MDM2 and MDMX are nonexistent. Using phage display coupled with chemical protein synthesis via native chemical ligation ( 37 , 38 ), we identified PMI—the strongest peptide ligand ever reported for MDM2/MDMX. Further, high-resolution crystal structures of syn MDM2 and syn MDMX in complex with PMI have been determined, unveiling not only the structural differences between MDM2 and MDMX but also the molecular determinants for high-affinity peptide inhibition of the 2 oncogenic proteins.

PMI binds MDM2 and MDMX similarly to p53 peptides. However, the improvement in binding affinity of PMI over (17–28) p53 by 2 orders of magnitude was surprising, partly because both peptides contained the same hydrophobic triad, Phe/Trp/Leu, known to be most critical for p53 transactivation and for MDM2 interactions ( 32 – 34 , 39 ). Structural analyses of the PMI complexes and of p53-bound MDM2/MDMX structures suggest that an extensive, tightened intramolecular H-bonding network found in PMI likely plays an important role in stabilizing its more extended α-helical conformation in the complex, thus contributing to high-affinity PMI binding to the oncoproteins. Central to the N-terminal H-bonding network in PMI is Ser-2, which donates and accepts up to 5 H-bonds as judged by their geometry. Not surprisingly, mutation of Ser-2 to Ala reduced the binding affinity of PMI for MDM2 by 1 order of magnitude, underscoring the importance of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in PMI-MDM2/MDMX interactions. It has been shown that Thr-18, highly conserved in p53 and important for MDM2 binding, can be substituted only by Ser ( 31 ). Consistent with the structural findings, the results from ITC measurements showed that the free energy of association gained by PMI over (17–28) p53 for MDM2/MDMX came entirely from a favorable enthalpy change counteracted by an unfavorable entropy change. A greater entropy loss for PMI ( Table S1 ) was indicative of a more stable peptide conformation in the complex than (17–28) p53.

An enhanced α-helicity of PMI and the tightening of its intramolecular H-bonding network seen in the MDM2 and MDMX complexes likely result, at least in part, from the selection of Ser-11 (as opposed to Pro-27 in p53). Zondlo et al. recently showed that mutation of the highly conserved Pro-27 in (12–30) p53 to Ser increased its binding affinity for MDM2 by 50-fold (a decrease in K d from 229 to 4.7 nM) ( 40 ). The authors attributed the improvement in MDM2 binding to increased α-helicity of the peptide in the complex—a thesis largely confirmed in a molecular dynamic simulation study by Dastidar et al. ( 41 ).

One of the most interesting structural findings entails the C-terminal residue Pro-12 of PMI interacting with a hydrophobic cleft unique to MDMX. Pro-12 is the third most buried residue at the PMI-MDMX interface with the second highest solvation energy effect ( Table S2 ). By contrast, residues flanking Leu-26 of p53 do not make energetically meaningful contact with either human MDM2 or zebra fish MDMX ( 25 , 29 ). In fact, deletion of Ser-11 and Pro-12 in PMI, while exhibiting little effect on MDM2 binding, weakened MDMX binding by 1 order of magnitude ( K d jumped from 3.6 to 29 nM), indicative of the importance of Pro-12 in binding MDMX but not MDM2. As shown in the known structures of MDM2 and zebra fish MDMX ( 23 , 25 – 29 ), the geometry of the binding pocket for the C-terminal residues of p53 hinges on the conformation of Tyr-100 of MDM2 or Tyr-99 of MDMX. The orientation of Tyr-100 or Tyr-99 seen in different MDM2 and MDMX complex structures ( Fig. 5 ) is clearly determined not only by the intrinsic properties of the α2′ helices but also by the chemical nature of the C-terminal residues of the ligand, supporting the notion that mutual conformational modulation of a protein-peptide complex leads to higher affinity ( 41 ). The hydrophobic binding cleft in MDMX induced by Pro-12 of PMI obviously affords an excellent opportunity to fine-tune binding affinity and specificity for MDM2/MDMX inhibitors.

Finally, it is worth noting that PMI, despite its high binding affinity for MDM2/MDMX, is much less active than Nutlin-3 in the killing of p53 +/+ HCT116 cells ( Fig. S6 ). The attenuated cytotoxic activity in vitro may reflect a low intracellular concentration of PMI, likely resulting from a combination of proteolytic degradation, inefficient cellular uptake, and endosomal sequestration ( 42 ). For these reasons, peptide inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents are generally considered “undruggable” compared with traditional low molecular weight compounds. Importantly, however, the discovery of small molecule drugs depends on high-resolution crystal structures of MDM2/MDMX complexed with high-affinity peptide ligands ( 22 , 23 ). The information obtained from high-affinity peptide inhibition of MDM2/MDMX is equally valuable for the design of miniature proteins that potently activate the p53 pathway and effectively kill p53 +/+ tumor cells in vitro ( 24 , 43 , 44 ). Our structural work reported here should aid in silico library screening and structure-based rational design of different classes of p53 activators for anticancer therapy.

Shortly before we submitted this manuscript, the crystal structure of human (23–111) MDMX in complex with (15–29) p53 at 1.9 Å resolution was reported ( 45 ). The complex structure is very similar to zebra fish MDMX- (15–29) p53 used for comparison in our article. Superposition of human MDMX- (15–29) p53 and syn MDMX-PMI yielded a RMSD of 0.8 Å. As observed in zebra fish MDMX- (15–29) p53 ( 29 ), the C-terminal residues of p53 (Pro-27 and Glu-28) are loosely bound to human MDMX with a single stabilizing H-bond between Tyr-99 O η and Pro-27 O. The hydrophobic cleft for Pro-12 of PMI seen in syn MDMX-PMI is not formed in the human MDMX- (15–29) p53 complex.
