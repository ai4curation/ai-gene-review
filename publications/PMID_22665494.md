Meiotic recombination hot spot locus (mrhl) RNA is a nuclear enriched long 
noncoding RNA encoded in the mouse genome and expressed in testis, liver, 
spleen, and kidney. mrhl RNA silencing in Gc1-Spg cells, derived from mouse 
spermatogonial cells, resulted in perturbation of expression of genes belonging 
to cell adhesion, cell signaling and development, and differentiation, among 
which many were of the Wnt signaling pathway. A weighted gene coexpression 
network generated nine coexpression modules, which included TCF4, a key 
transcription factor involved in Wnt signaling. Activation of Wnt signaling upon 
mrhl RNA downregulation was demonstrated by beta-catenin nuclear localization, 
beta-catenin-TCF4 interaction, occupancy of beta-catenin at the promoters of Wnt 
target genes, and TOP/FOP-luciferase assay. Northwestern blot and RNA pulldown 
experiments identified Ddx5/p68 as one of the interacting proteins of mrhl RNA. 
Downregulation of mrhl RNA resulted in the cytoplasmic translocation of 
tyrosine-phosphorylated p68. Concomitant downregulation of both mrhl RNA and p68 
prevented the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. mrhl RNA was downregulated 
on Wnt3a treatment in Gc1-Spg cells. This study shows that mrhl RNA plays a 
negative role in Wnt signaling in mouse spermatogonial cells through its 
interaction with p68.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, there has been an explosion in the discovery of several classes of noncoding RNAs which constitute a huge repertoire of gene regulatory molecules in higher eukaryotes ( 10 ). The discovery of these molecules has made a tremendous impact in our understanding of higher-order genome regulation and the complexity of an organism itself. The small noncoding RNAs such as microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) play critical roles in transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene regulation and also in fine-tuning the level of expression of cognate mRNAs ( 1 , 12 ). Another class of regulatory noncoding RNAs is long noncoding RNAs, which are of various sizes between 200 bp and several kilobases ( 41 ). Many studies have uncovered a plethora of processes in which these RNAs participate within the living cell, such as dosage compensation by XIST ( 14 ) and roX ( 30 ), imprinting by AIR ( 37 ) and Kcnq1ot1 ( 24 , 29 ), an architectural role by NEAT1 ( 6 ), RNA localization by CTN1 ( 31 ), etc. Many such functions are mediated through their protein binding partners wherein the noncoding RNA is an indispensable component of such complexes. For example, small RNAs (siRNA and miRNA) are often found in association with the RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex), which consist of Argonaute and other proteins ( 11 ). In the case of P-element-induced wimpy testis (Piwi)-associated RNAs (piRNAs), which are involved in transposon regulation, the RNA component is associated with Piwi proteins such as Miwi or Mili in mouse and Hiwi in humans ( 2 ). Long noncoding RNAs also have functional protein partners. For example, XIST RNA is associated with macroH2A during the process of X chromosome inactivation ( 32 ). The Kcnq1ot1 RNA interacts with PRC2 component members Ezh2 and Suz12 ( 40 ).

Wnt signaling is a highly conserved developmental signaling pathway involving the major effector protein beta-catenin ( 27 ). The canonical Wnt signaling is activated upon binding of Wnt ligands to its receptors Frizzled/LRP, which results in stabilization of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm. The stabilized beta-catenin translocates to the nucleus, whereby it binds to the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors and activates the Wnt target genes. In the Wnt-uninduced condition, beta-catenin is phosphorylated by the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β)/axin/adenomatous polyposis coli complex, which targets beta-catenin to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis ( 27 ). The Wnt signaling is a conserved and essential pathway in development and cell proliferation, and ES cell differentiation and dysregulation of Wnt signaling have been associated with many cancers ( 15 ).

p68, also referred to as Ddx5, is a founding member of a large family of DEAD box helicases. In addition to the DEAD box motif, they also possess other conserved sequences, including an ATPase domain and an RNA helicase domain ( 7 ). These proteins have been shown to play important roles in diverse biological processes such as development, regulation of transcription, RNA processing, and ribosome biogenesis and also in the miRNA pathway ( 7 , 36 ). DEAD box proteins act by promoting the formation of optimal secondary structure in RNA and mediate RNA-protein association or dissociation. Apart from its transcriptional coactivator function, p68 has been shown to play a role in signaling events. During the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that is induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation, p68, which gets phosphorylated at tyrosine 593, was shown to translocate to the cytoplasm, where it stabilizes beta-catenin; subsequently p68–beta-catenin translocates back to the nucleus, bringing about downstream transcriptional regulation ( 43 ).

mrhl is a 2.4-kb noncoding RNA, identified in our laboratory, encoded in the mouse genome embedded within a meiotic recombination hot spot locus on mouse chromosome 8 ( 26 ). mrhl RNA is an intronic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is transcribed by RNA polymerase II as an independent transcription unit from the intron of the phkb gene. It is a polyadenylated and unspliced transcript. mrhl RNA is expressed in liver, kidney, spleen, and testes but not in brain, heart, lung, and muscle tissues ( 26 ). The 2.4-kb primary transcript is nuclear restricted, localizes to the nucleolus, and gets processed to an 80-nucleotide (nt) intermediate RNA by the Drosha machinery ( 13 ). Although Dicer can further process the 80-nt intermediate RNA to 22 nt in an in vitro reaction, the mature 22-nt miRNA derived from mrhl RNA was not detected in vivo , suggesting a nuclear regulatory role for this noncoding RNA. In an effort to understand the function of mrhl RNA in vivo , we have now carried out siRNA-mediated silencing of mrhl RNA in mouse spermatogonial cells (Gc1-Spg) and carried out an expression array analysis to study the genes that are perturbed upon mrhl RNA silencing. We have also constructed a weighted gene coexpression network from the perturbed gene list, and we find representation of many of the important transcription factors and genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, including TCF4, which, in association with beta-catenin, regulates the expression of wnt downstream targets. A series of experiments described here demonstrate that beta-catenin does translocate into the nucleus under mrhl RNA downregulated conditions and interacts with TCF4 at the promoter of TCF4 target genes. Subsequently we have observed that p68/Ddx5 interacts with mrhl RNA and p68 translocates to the cytoplasm under mrhl RNA downregulated conditions. Further, we have shown that p68 is indeed essential in translocating beta-catenin to the nucleus upon mrhl RNA downregulation. Interestingly, there was a significant decrease in steady-state mrhl RNA levels in Gc1-Spg cells upon stimulation with Wnt3a ligand. Thus, here we report a functional role of a long noncoding mrhl RNA and its protein partner p68 in Wnt signaling in mouse male germ cells.

DISCUSSION

Noncoding RNAs have been shown to play multiple roles in many cellular processes. We have recently identified and characterized a novel noncoding RNA gene in the mouse genome ( 13 , 26 ). In our present study, through a series of experiments, we have conclusively shown the activation of a canonical Wnt signaling pathway upon mrhl RNA downregulation. It is interesting to note that TCF4, a key transcription factor in canonical Wnt signaling, is also upregulated under mrhl RNA gene silencing. We speculate a feed-forward loop in the wnt activation process that in turn activates TCF4 upon mrhl RNA downregulation. Additionally, we have also observed downregulation of extracellular negative modulators like Dkk3 and Sfrp1, suggesting a close relationship between Wnt activation and the expression of negative modulators. We also point out here that beta-catenin is recruited with TCF4 at the promoter sites of Dkk3, Tsc22d1, Elk3, Sox8, and Sox12; this has not been reported earlier in the literature. It is interesting to note that the two genes Prickle 1 and Rac1, which are part of the noncanonical pathway ( 16 , 45 ), are differentially perturbed upon mrhl RNA silencing, the significance of which cannot be commented upon at present. However, a recent report demonstrates that Rac1, a GTPase regulating cytoskeletal function, positively regulates nuclear localization of beta-catenin in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway ( 42 ). We find beta-catenin nuclear localization upon mrhl RNA downregulation in spite of about a 3-fold reduction in Rac1 mRNA levels ( Fig. 3A ). Although we have not measured Rac1 protein levels under these conditions, it is quite possible that the reduced levels of Rac1 protein in the activated (GTP-bound) form may be sufficient for beta-catenin nuclear translocation.

An important question that arises at this juncture is the mechanism of wnt activation under an mrhl RNA-downregulated condition. An important clue toward answering this question came from the Northwestern blot analysis and the mass spectrometric data of the RNA pulldown experiment. Among the four identified partners, Ddx5/p68 is a known RNA binding protein whose cytoplasmic translocation in its tyrosine-phosphorylated form is shown to stabilize cytoplasmic beta-catenin during PDGF-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colon cancer cells ( 43 ). In the present study, we observe tyrosine-phosphorylated p68 in the cytoplasm. In addition to p68, we have also identified Dusp11, a dual-specificity phosphatase, as another interacting protein of mrhl RNA ( Table 1 ). It is likely that Dusp11 is a part of the p68-RNA complex regulating the dynamics of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of p68. The role of mrhl RNA in this complex may be to serve as a scaffold for p68 protein binding and keep protein in a dephosphorylated state, thereby retaining it in the nucleus. Recently, long noncoding RNA Malat1 has been shown to regulate phosphorylation of SR proteins and in turn regulate alternative splicing ( 39 ). p68 is also shown to interact with another noncoding RNA, SRA, which is shown to have a coactivating role along with p68 in regulating gene expression at the chromatin level ( 5 ). Although we have not addressed the domain of mrhl RNA which interacts with p68 in this study, a preliminary exercise shows that a domain with a particular stem-loop secondary structure of SRA is also seen in mrhl noncoding RNA. Indeed, in our present study, we have observed that in addition to perturbation of expression of genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, many other genes belonging to other cellular processes are differentially regulated upon mrhl RNA silencing. It remains to be seen whether the p68-mrhl RNA complex also has an independent role, similar to that of the p68-SRA complex, in regulating chromatin-mediated gene expression.

In addition to Wnt pathway genes, many other genes were perturbed upon mrhl RNA downregulation. Perturbation of these non-Wnt pathway genes upon mrhl RNA silencing can be explained in part by perturbation of transcription factors and coactivators, which in turn can regulate many genes. Also, when we examined the perturbed gene list from the microarray data, we found that not all the Wnt target genes reported in the literature are perturbed under mrhl-downregulated conditions. Further, among the perturbed Wnt target genes, beta-catenin occupies the promoters of only a subset and not all of the genes ( Fig. 4C ). These observations can be explained by the fact that target gene regulation by the beta-catenin/TCF4 complex can be context and cell type specific and regulated by many other protein factors, chromatin remodelers, coactivators, and corepressors ( 25 ). We have also scanned a region of about 1 Mb upstream and downstream of the mrhl RNA gene and found that this region harbors genes like Gpt2 , Itfg1 , Dnaja2 , and Vps35 (upstream) and Siah1a , Abcc12 , Lonp2 , and N4bp1 (downstream). Expression of these genes was not perturbed under mrhl RNA downregulation, indicating that the perturbation of gene expression is trans in nature with respect to the mrhl RNA gene locus. We also observe in the present study that Lim domain-containing protein, a transcription factor, is one of the interacting proteins of mrhl RNA ( Table 1 ). To address these additional mechanisms of perturbation in gene expression, we have now begun to map the chromatin occupancy sites of mrhl RNA.

All the experiments reported in the present communication were carried out in a Gc1-Spg cell line derived from spermatogonial cells. Interestingly, we have come across a recent report by Yeh et al. ( 44 ) showing that Wnt signaling is suppressed in spermatogonial stem cells as well as spermatogonia but is activated in differentiating spermatocytes. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that mrhl RNA may function as one of the negative regulators of Wnt signaling in spermatogonial cells. We have also observed in the present study that mrhl RNA interacts with p68 in three other mouse tissues, namely, liver, kidney, and spleen, which had been shown earlier to express mrhl RNA ( 26 ). The functional significance of this association remains to be seen, and it would be most interesting to see whether mrhl RNA also acts as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling in these tissues.
