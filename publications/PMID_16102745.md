In the current analysis, we have investigated both the cytoskeletal and 
signaling roles of beta-catenin during the early phases of lens development 
using conditional loss- and gain-of-function strategies. Conditional loss of 
beta-catenin in the presumptive lens does not perturb the normal sequential 
appearance of lens fate markers but results in a dramatic failure of the 
coordinated epithelial cell behavior that constitutes lens morphogenesis. 
Similarly, loss-of-function for Lrp6, the Wnt pathway coreceptor expressed in 
the eye primordium, does not prevent expression of lens induction markers. 
Surprisingly, conditional deletion of beta-catenin in periocular ectoderm 
results in the formation of Prox-1 and beta-crystallin-positive ectopic lentoid 
bodies. Combined with the observation that the Wnt pathway reporter TOPGAL is 
expressed in nasal periocular ectoderm, these data suggest that, in this 
location, the canonical Wnt signaling pathway normally suppresses lens fate in 
favor of other structures. Consistent with this proposal, a dominant-active form 
of beta-catenin causes a loss of lens fate and a complete absence of lens 
development when expressed in the presumptive lens ectoderm.
