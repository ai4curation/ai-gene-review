How the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery accurately identifies 
terminally misfolded proteins is poorly understood. For luminal ERAD substrates, 
this recognition depends on their folding and glycosylation status as well as on 
the conserved ER lectin Yos9p. Here we show that Yos9p is part of a stable 
complex that organizes key components of ERAD machinery on both sides of the ER 
membrane, including the transmembrane ubiquitin ligase Hrd1p. We further 
demonstrate that Yos9p, together with Kar2p and Hrd3p, forms a luminal 
surveillance complex that both recruits nonnative proteins to the core ERAD 
machinery and assists a distinct sugar-dependent step necessary to commit 
substrates for degradation. When Hrd1p is uncoupled from the Yos9p surveillance 
complex, degradation can occur independently of the requirement for 
glycosylation. Thus, Yos9p/Kar2p/Hrd3p acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring correct 
identification of terminally misfolded proteins by recruiting misfolded forms to 
the ERAD machinery, contributing to the interrogation of substrate sugar status, 
and preventing glycosylation-independent degradation.
