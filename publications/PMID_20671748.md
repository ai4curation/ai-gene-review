The regulation of both mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis is key for 
maintaining the health of a cell. Bcl-2 family proteins, central in apoptosis 
regulation, also have roles in the maintenance of the mitochondrial network. 
Here we report that Bax and Bak participate in the regulation of mitochondrial 
fusion in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, primary mouse neurons and human colon 
carcinoma cells. To assess how Bcl-2 family members may regulate mitochondrial 
morphogenesis, we determined the binding of a series of chimeras between Bcl-xL 
and Bax to the mitofusins, mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2). One 
chimera (containing helix 5 (H5) of Bax replacing H5 of Bcl-xL (Bcl-xL/Bax H5)) 
co-immunoprecipitated with Mfn1 and Mfn2 significantly better than either 
wild-type Bax or Bcl-xL. Expression of Bcl-xL/Bax H5 in cells reduced the 
mobility of Mfn1 and Mfn2 and colocalized with ectopic Mfn1 and Mfn2, as well as 
endogenous Mfn2 to a greater extent than wild-type Bax. Ultimately, Bcl-xL/Bax 
H5 induced substantial mitochondrial fragmentation in healthy cells. Therefore, 
we propose that Bcl-xL/Bax H5 disturbs mitochondrial morphology by binding and 
inhibiting Mfn1 and Mfn2 activity, supporting the hypothesis that Bcl-2 family 
members have the capacity to regulate mitochondrial morphology through binding 
to the mitofusins in healthy cells.
