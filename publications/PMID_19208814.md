Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental 
disorders that share deficits in sociability, communication, and restrictive and 
repetitive interests. ASD is likely polygenic in origin in most cases, but we 
presently lack an understanding of the relationships between ASD susceptibility 
genes and the neurobiological and behavioral phenotypes of ASD. Two genes that 
have been implicated as conferring susceptibility to ASD are PTEN and Serotonin 
transporter (SLC6A4). The PI3K and serotonin pathways, in which these genes 
respectively act, are both potential biomarkers for ASD diagnosis and treatment. 
Biochemical evidence exists for an interaction between these pathways; however, 
the relevance of this for the pathogenesis of ASD is unclear. We find that Pten 
haploinsufficient (Pten(+/-)) mice are macrocephalic, and this phenotype is 
exacerbated in Pten(+/-); Slc6a4(+/-) mice. Furthermore, female Pten(+/-) mice 
are impaired in social approach behavior, a phenotype that is exacerbated in 
female Pten(+/-); Slc6a4(+/-) mice. While increased brain size correlates with 
decreased sociability across these genotypes in females, within each genotype 
increased brain size correlates with increased sociability, suggesting that 
epigenetic influences interact with genetic factors in influencing the 
phenotype. These findings provide insight into an interaction between two ASD 
candidate genes during brain development and point toward the use of compound 
mutant mice to validate biomarkers for ASD against biological and behavioral 
phenotypes.

Abstract

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders that share deficits in sociability, communication, and restrictive and repetitive interests. ASD is likely polygenic in origin in most cases, but we presently lack an understanding of the relationships between ASD susceptibility genes and the neurobiological and behavioral phenotypes of ASD. Two genes that have been implicated as conferring susceptibility to ASD are PTEN and Serotonin transporter ( SLC6A4 ). The PI3K and serotonin pathways, in which these genes respectively act, are both potential biomarkers for ASD diagnosis and treatment. Biochemical evidence exists for an interaction between these pathways; however, the relevance of this for the pathogenesis of ASD is unclear. We find that Pten haploinsufficient ( Pten +/− ) mice are macrocephalic, and this phenotype is exacerbated in Pten +/− ; Slc6a4 +/− mice. Furthermore, female Pten +/− mice are impaired in social approach behavior, a phenotype that is exacerbated in female Pten +/− ; Slc6a4 +/− mice. While increased brain size correlates with decreased sociability across these genotypes in females, within each genotype increased brain size correlates with increased sociability, suggesting that epigenetic influences interact with genetic factors in influencing the phenotype. These findings provide insight into an interaction between two ASD candidate genes during brain development and point toward the use of compound mutant mice to validate biomarkers for ASD against biological and behavioral phenotypes.

Results

To test for a potential interaction between Pten and Slc6a4 , we first needed to identify a phenotypic readout relevant to ASD. One of the most widely reported neuroanatomical abnormalities reported in ASD is macrocephaly, with an incidence of 10–30% in adulthood and up to 60% during development ( 17 ). Studies in ASD patients have shown that brain size is positively correlated with the severity of behavioral phenotypes in ASD-relevant measures ( 18 , 19 ). Reports from conditional knockouts of Pten in the mouse brain describe macrocephaly phenotypes, with increases in cell soma size and neurite hypertrophy likely contributing to these phenotypes ( 20 – 22 ). We generated Pten and Slc6a4 compound heterozygous mutant mice by crossing Pten haploinsufficient mice to a line carrying a previously described Slc6a4 loss-of-function allele ( 23 ). We focused on germline heterozygous mice to maximize clinical relevance. To examine whether Pten or Slc6a4 haploinsufficient mice exhibit brain overgrowth, we obtained measures of overall brain mass, normalized to body mass to account for variations in body size. These data showed that haploinsufficiency for Pten or Slc6a4 results in a macrocephaly phenotype in both males and females ( Fig. 1 A–C ). Furthermore, Pten +/− ; Slc6a4 +/− mice had an additive brain overgrowth phenotype more severe than that seen in either Pten or Slc6a4 haploinsufficient mice ( Fig. 1 A–C ). Although the cellular mechanism underlying the effect on growth remains to be identified, these data indicate that Pten and Slc6a4 act cooperatively to influence a phenotype relevant to ASD, brain overgrowth.

The above results argue that Pten haploinsufficient mice may be a useful tool to examine second-site genetic modifiers that interact with Pten in a manner relevant to polygenic ASD and for testing the effects of environmental modifications and the effects of therapeutic compounds. To investigate whether Pten haploinsufficient mice have surface validity for behavioral phenotypes relevant to ASD, we tested 12-week-old mice using several behavior assays. The assays we used tested sociability, which reflects a core diagnostic deficit seen in individuals with ASD ( 24 ), and prepulse inhibition, a measure of sensorimotor gating that has been reported to be abnormal in individuals with ASD ( 25 – 27 ). To test for a possible confounding factor of olfactory function in social behavior, we exposed Pten haploinsufficient mice and controls to an olfactory habituation–dishabituation test and found that these mice responded normally ( Fig. S1 ), indicating that they do not have a gross impairment in olfactory function. To measure social approach behavior, we used a variation of an apparatus in which mice have to choose between spending time interacting with an unfamiliar gender- and age-matched stimulus mouse (social chamber) or an inanimate object (nonsocial chamber) ( 28 , 29 ) ( Fig. 2 A ). Whereas wild-type mice of both genders showed a significant preference for spending time in the social chamber, Pten haploinsufficient female mice did not show this preference and spent roughly equal time in the social and nonsocial chambers ( Fig. 2 B ). Male Pten haploinsufficient mice did not show this same deficit in social approach behavior ( Fig. 2 C ). In tests of sensorimotor gating in Pten haploinsufficient mice and controls, we found that both genders had deficits in prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response ( Fig. 2 D ). Our results with Pten haploinsufficient mice generally agree with behavioral results from CNS-specific conditional Pten knockout mice ( 21 ), in which animals were tested for a variety of ASD-relevant phenotypes. Differences are seen in the initial tendency for social approach in males, where conditional knockouts show a deficit and Pten haploinsufficient mice do not. These differences are most likely attributable to the different nature of the genetic manipulation in these 2 complementary models. Identifying the neurobiological basis for different behavioral phenotypes in these models should provide insight into how Pten influences the development of neural circuitry relevant to ASD.

To test whether the social approach phenotype we observe in Pten +/− female mice may be modified by haploinsufficiency for Slc6a4 , as happens with brain size, we examined 8-week-old female wild-type, Pten haploinsufficient, Slc6a4 haploinsufficient, and Pten +/− ; Slc6a4 +/− compound mutant mice. Slc6a4 haploinsufficient and Pten +/− ; Slc6a4 +/− mice responded normally in a test of olfactory habituation–dishabituation ( Fig. S1 ), indicating no gross impairment of olfaction in these mice. We found that Slc6a4 haploinsufficient mice displayed a decreased preference for interacting with a stimulus mouse in the social approach assay as compared with wild-type mice, although this did not fall below the threshold for significance. However, Pten +/− ; Slc6a4 +/− mice did show a significant decrease in preference for interacting with a stimulus mousee ( Fig. 3 A ). Analyzing these data using a social approach–avoidance score ( 28 ) (time in social chamber 1 minus time in nonsocial chamber 3), we found that the time spent interacting with a stimulus mouse was significantly less in Pten +/− ; Slc6a4 +/− mice than in wild-type, Pten haploinsufficient, or Slc6a4 haploinsufficient mice ( Fig. 3 B ). This result is consistent with haploinsufficiency for Pten and Slc6a4 acting additively to influence an ASD-relevant behavioral phenotype, social approach.

To further examine social behavior in Pten +/− male mice, we tested 8-week-old male wild-type, Pten haploinsufficient, Slc6a4 haploinsufficient, and Pten +/− ; Slc6a4 +/− mice for social approach and recognition behavior. To do this, we adapted our 3-chamber apparatus to a protocol used to test social recognition in Oxytocin knockout mice, which show normal initial social investigation behavior but fail to recognize the same social target upon reexposure after 30 min ( 30 – 32 ). Consistent with our findings for 12-week-old male wild-type and Pten haploinsufficient mice ( Fig. 2 C ), we did not observe a significant change in preference for social interaction in any of these genotypes in the male groups for the first 10-min trial (trial 1) ( Fig. 3 C ). Upon reexposure to the same social target in trial 2 (5 min), wild-type mice showed equal interest in investigating the control and stimulus mouse-containing chambers, with this effect presumably due to habituation ( Fig. 3 C ). In contrast, Pten haploinsufficient, Slc6a4 haploinsufficient, and Pten +/− ; Slc6a4 +/− mice did not show attenuation of preference for social investigation between the first and second trials ( Fig. 3 D ). This finding indicates that haploinsufficiency for Pten and Slc6a4 may impair social recognition in male mice; however, further testing will be necessary to separate out a specific deficit in the social recognition pathway (i.e., oxytocin–vasopressin–dopamine) vs. sustained interest in social interaction.

In tests of prepulse inhibition, the relationship between Pten and Slc6a4 haploinsufficiency appeared to be epistatically dominant rather than additive, with Pten haploinsufficient and Pten +/− ; Slc6a4 +/− mice each being significantly impaired as compared to wild type but not as compared to one another ( Fig. 3 D ). This suggests that interactions between Pten and Slc6a4 may have a degree of specificity in regard to the development of brain circuitry underlying behavior. We speculate that cooperative function of Pten and Slc6a4 is particularly important for the assembly and function of circuitry involved in social behavior, as it is for brain size control, but not necessarily for circuitry involved in other ASD-relevant behaviors such as sensorimotor gating.

Finally, we asked whether the social approach phenotype related to brain size across genotypes and within each genotype. Analyzing population means revealed a negative correlation between brain size (relative to body mass) and social approach–avoidance score across genotypes ( Fig. 4 A ). Surprisingly, analysis of individual subjects within each genotype showed a significant positive correlation between these measures in each group, with the exception of Slc6a4 haploinsufficient mice, which showed more variability ( Fig. 4 B–E ). This indicates that haploinsufficiency for Pten and Slc6a4 leads to a decrease in sociability with increase in brain size. Within each of these genotypes, however, intragroup factors appear to mediate an increase in sociability with increase in brain size.

Discussion

In regard to brain structure and function, we find that Pten haploinsufficient mice of both genders have brain overgrowth and that females have deficits in social approach behavior. We find that these phenotypes can be modified in an additive fashion by Slc6a4 haploinsufficiency. These findings are striking given that autism affects males over females at a ratio of ≈4:1. At present we do not know why we see differential effects of gender in social behavior in Pten haploinsufficient mice. It is important to emphasize that the social approach assay we have used captures only one aspect of social behavior in rodents that may be relevant to ASD. Further testing of behaviors such as ultrasonic vocalization or social reward will be necessary to fully characterize the extent and nature of social impairment in these mice. However, one interesting possible clue for these gender differences in our assays comes from reports of evidence for a link between immune system dysfunction, particularly autoimmunity, and ASD ( 19 , 33 , 34 ). Postmortem studies have also shown an increase in the expression of several markers for neuroinflammation in ASD ( 35 ). Importantly, Pten +/− mice have immune system abnormalities, including autoimmunity, and these effects are more pronounced in female mice as compared to male mice ( 36 ). This argues that Pten haploinsufficient mice will be a useful model to study the influence of gender and immune system dysfunction on neural development.

Mechanisms by which serotonin signaling (including Slc6a4 ) and the PI3K pathway (including Pten ) may interact to influence brain development are illustrated in Fig. S2 . One possibility is that Pten and serotonin receptors may physically interact in a regulatory manner to influence brain development. In neurons, Pten binds the 5-HT2c receptor and, via its phosphatase activity, limits agonist-induced activation of this receptor and modulates the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area ( 10 ). It is interesting to note that 3 drugs that have been reported as alleviating symptoms of autism—the atypical antipsychotics risperidone ( 37 ) and olanzapine ( 38 ) and the antidepressant fluoxetine ( 39 )—all have antagonistic effects on the 5-HT2c receptor, in addition to well-known effects targeting other members of the serotonin and dopamine pathways. The degree to which antagonism of the 5-HT2c receptor is relevant for the action of these drugs in autism will be an interesting area for future investigation. It is also possible that the PI3K/Akt pathway is directly modulated by serotonin signaling. In cultured rodent hippocampal neurons, addition of 5-HT 1A receptor agonist can activate Akt and this activation can be blocked via pharmacological inhibition of PI3K ( 40 ). 5-HT 1A receptor is expressed in the brain as early as midembryogenesis ( 41 ), suggesting that altered activity of this receptor could modify the course of brain development even from early stages of morphogenesis. Stimulation of 5-HT 1B receptor is also capable of activating Akt ( 42 ). There is evidence that this receptor modulates axonal responses to guidance cues in the developing neocortex ( 43 ) and that excess serotonin acting on this receptor is responsible for specific cytoarchitechtonic abnormalities in Slc6a4 knockout mice ( 44 ). Either mechanism could converge on molecules capable of influencing morphogenesis, growth, and neuronal function, including mTOR, GSK-3beta, Creb, and NF-kappa-B. Interestingly, serotonergic stimulation increases ( 45 ), and serotonin deficiency decreases ( 46 ), levels of GSK-3beta phosphorylated at Ser 9 in the mouse brain. Regulation of GSK-3beta at Ser 9 by Pten via Akt is involved in establishing and maintaining neuronal polarity ( 47 ), and levels of phospho-GSK-3beta are reported as elevated in the brains of mice in which Pten has been conditionally knocked out in the CNS ( 21 ). While further experiments will be necessary to verify this model, molecules upon which the serotonin and Pten-PI3K pathways converge may prove to be useful biomarkers, and therapeutic targets, for a subset of individuals with ASD.

Our data also suggest that a negative correlation exists between brain size and sociability across the genotypes examined in this study. However, at the level of individual animals within a given genotypic group, we find a significant positive correlation between brain size and sociability. We interpret this finding as indicating that, in reference to sociability, there are both beneficial and detrimental ways of changing brain size. We have identified haploinsufficiency for Pten and Slc6a4 as additively leading to correlated increases in brain size and decreased sociability. Perhaps acting secondary to this, and possibly reflecting environmental effects on neural plasticity, we speculate that specific pathways influence brain size in a beneficial manner in reference to sociability. While in autism, clinical data indicate a negative correlation between head circumference and sociability ( 18 , 19 ), evidence exists from numerous studies that a positive correlation exists between brain size and social complexity in primates and other animals (reviewed in ref. 48 ). The possibility that distinct biological pathways influence brain size and lead to differential outcomes in regard to sociability may help explain this paradox. We hypothesize that these pathways may act as evolutionary substrates for changes in social behavior within and across species.

Our results also argue that overall brain size may serve as a convenient phenotypic readout for screening for interactions with the serotonin and PI3K pathways. It would be interesting to examine whether proposed mechanisms of ASD pathophysiology, including increased excitation/inhibition ratios ( 49 ) and altered local vs. long-distance connectivity in the frontal cortex ( 50 ), are apparent in this model. An elevated rate of de novo genomic copy number variation has been observed in ASD ( 51 ). Given that Pten has a role in the maintenance of genomic stability and that a loss of Pten results in an accumulation of double-stranded DNA breaks ( 52 , 53 ), it is possible that a background of PTEN haploinsufficiency may increase the probability of a secondary modifying event, such as a copy number variation in a gene relevant to ASD, occurring. In regard to environmental modifiers, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of organic compounds capable of disrupting neocortical development and are candidates for interacting with genetic susceptibility in ASD etiology ( 54 ). Experimental evidence exists for a PCB, PCB77, altering nitric oxide signaling and NF-kappa-B activity via the PI3K pathway, and this effect can be offset by inhibiting PI3K ( 55 ). Given the role of PTEN as a negative regulator of PI3K signaling, we hypothesize that haploinsufficiency for PTEN may be a genetic risk factor for abnormal brain development in response to exposure to environmental toxins that impinge on the PI3K pathway, such as PCBs.
