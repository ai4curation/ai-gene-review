Lysosome-associated protein transmembrane-4b (LAPTM4B) associates with poor 
prognosis in several cancers, but its physiological function is not well 
understood. Here we use novel ceramide probes to provide evidence that LAPTM4B 
interacts with ceramide and facilitates its removal from late endosomal 
organelles (LEs). This lowers LE ceramide in parallel with and independent of 
acid ceramidase-dependent catabolism. In LAPTM4B-silenced cells, LE sphingolipid 
accumulation is accompanied by lysosomal membrane destabilization. However, 
these cells resist ceramide-driven caspase-3 activation and apoptosis induced by 
chemotherapeutic agents or gene silencing. Conversely, LAPTM4B overexpression 
reduces LE ceramide and stabilizes lysosomes but sensitizes to drug-induced 
caspase-3 activation. Together, these data uncover a cellular ceramide export 
route from LEs and identify LAPTM4B as its regulator. By compartmentalizing 
ceramide, LAPTM4B controls key sphingolipid-mediated cell death mechanisms and 
emerges as a candidate for sphingolipid-targeting cancer therapies.
