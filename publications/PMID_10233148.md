Proper functioning of organelles necessitates efficient protein targeting to the 
appropriate subcellular locations. For example, degradation in the fungal 
vacuole relies on an array of targeting mechanisms for both resident hydrolases 
and their substrates. The particular processes that are used vary depending on 
the available nutrients. Under starvation conditions, macroautophagy is the 
primary method by which bulk cytosol is sequestered into autophagic vesicles 
(autophagosomes) destined for this organelle. Molecular genetic, morphological, 
and biochemical evidence indicates that macroautophagy shares much of the same 
cellular machinery as a biosynthetic pathway for the delivery of the vacuolar 
hydrolase, aminopeptidase I, via the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) 
pathway. The machinery required in both pathways includes a novel protein 
modification system involving the conjugation of two autophagy proteins, Apg12p 
and Apg5p. The conjugation reaction was demonstrated to be dependent on Apg7p, 
which shares homology with the E1 family of ubiquitin-activating enzymes. In 
this study, we demonstrate that Apg7p functions at the sequestration step in the 
formation of Cvt vesicles and autophagosomes. The subcellular localization of 
Apg7p fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) indicates that a subpopulation of 
Apg7pGFP becomes membrane associated in an Apg12p-dependent manner. Subcellular 
fractionation experiments also indicate that a portion of the Apg7p pool is 
pelletable under starvation conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that the Pichia 
pastoris homologue Gsa7p that is required for peroxisome degradation is 
functionally similar to Apg7p, indicating that this novel conjugation system may 
represent a general nonclassical targeting mechanism that is conserved across 
species.
