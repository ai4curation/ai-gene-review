Whole body hyperthermia (42-43 degrees C for 15-20 min) elicits the formation of 
heat shock proteins (hsps) and improves cardiac recovery from subsequent 
ischemia/reperfusion. However, the beneficial effects of this response are 
compromised by initial tissue injury, which limits its clinical applicability. 
Using a simplified myocardial model (rat heart-derived H9c2 myoblasts) a 
hypothesis was tested that chronic, mild hyperthermia is as effective as acute 
heat shock in inducing the heat shock response. Our results indicate that 39 
degrees C pre-conditioning evoked thermotolerance and oxidative resistance, but 
caused no detectable adverse effects. An improved survival after hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2) exposure (40-54 microm for 3 h) was first observed in cells 
pre-conditioned at 39 degrees C for 24 h. As the duration of thermal 
pre-incubation increased, cells became more resistant than the control (37 
degrees C) to a greater toxicity of H2O2(68 microm). An optimal oxidative 
protection developed by;4 days at 39 degrees C and this persisted for as long as 
the cells were incubated at this temperature. Three hsps are known to modulate 
cellular antioxidant defenses: the constitutive-hsp70 (hsc70), its inducible 
counterpart (hsp70), and hsp27. The authors found that mild hyperthermia 
selectively induced only hsc70, which demonstrates a lower temperature threshold 
for activation of hsc70. The initial protection against the milder H2O2challenge 
correlated with a homogenous distribution of pre-existing hsc70. The subsequent 
optimal protection was associated with an identical distribution pattern and a 
moderate increase of hsc70. These observations suggest that mild hyperthermia 
induces a beneficial adaptive response, in which hsc70 plays a critical role.
