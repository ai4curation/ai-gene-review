Ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms have emerged as essential regulatory elements 
controlling cellular levels of Smads and TGFβ-dependent biological outputs such 
as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we identify a HECT E3 
ubiquitin ligase known as WWP2 (Full-length WWP2-FL), together with two WWP2 
isoforms (N-terminal, WWP2-N; C-terminal WWP2-C), as novel Smad-binding 
partners. We show that WWP2-FL interacts exclusively with Smad2, Smad3 and Smad7 
in the TGFβ pathway. Interestingly, the WWP2-N isoform interacts with Smad2 and 
Smad3, whereas WWP2-C interacts only with Smad7. In addition, WWP2-FL and WWP2-C 
have a preference for Smad7 based on protein turnover and ubiquitination 
studies. Unexpectedly, we also find that WWP2-N, which lacks the HECT ubiquitin 
ligase domain, can also interact with WWP2-FL in a TGFβ-regulated manner and 
activate endogenous WWP2 ubiquitin ligase activity causing degradation of 
unstimulated Smad2 and Smad3. Consistent with our protein interaction data, 
overexpression and knockdown approaches reveal that WWP2 isoforms differentially 
modulate TGFβ-dependent transcription and EMT. Finally, we show that selective 
disruption of WWP2 interactions with inhibitory Smad7 can stabilise Smad7 
protein levels and prevent TGFβ-induced EMT. Collectively, our data suggest that 
WWP2-N can stimulate WWP2-FL leading to increased activity against unstimulated 
Smad2 and Smad3, and that Smad7 is a preferred substrate for WWP2-FL and WWP2-C 
following prolonged TGFβ stimulation. Significantly, this is the first report of 
an interdependent biological role for distinct HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase 
isoforms, and highlights an entirely novel regulatory paradigm that selectively 
limits the level of inhibitory and activating Smads.
