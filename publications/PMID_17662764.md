OBJECTIVES: Bicuspid aortic valve is a common condition and is associated with a 
significantly increased risk of developing thoracic aortic aneurysms and acute 
aortic dissection. Patient-specific prediction of the risk of developing 
thoracic aortic aneurysm, however, is imprecise. We hypothesize that genotypic 
variations in patients with bicuspid aortic valves contribute to this observed 
variability in aortic phenotype. We, therefore, investigated the potential 
relationship between mutations in regions of NOTCH1 recently reported to be 
associated with bicuspid aortic valve and the phenotype of bicuspid aortic valve 
and thoracic aortic aneurysms in unrelated patients undergoing surgical repair.
METHODS: We performed a targeted mutational analysis of NOTCH1 using genomic DNA 
from 48 unrelated subjects with concomitant bicuspid aortic valve and thoracic 
aortic aneurysm using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and DNA 
sequencing. We focused on exons in which mutations associated with bicuspid 
aortic valve have been reported previously. Results were compared with control 
subjects with trileaflet aortic valves (n = 94), bicuspid aortic valves, and 
normal aortas (n = 22) and in subjects with tricuspid aortic valves and thoracic 
aortic aneurysms (n = 28).
RESULTS: Four unique, nonsynonymous (3 novel) variants were identified in 5 
(10.4%) of 48 patients with concomitant bicuspid aortic valves and thoracic 
aortic aneurysms compared with only 3 (2.1%) of 144 control subjects (P = .02). 
Of these, 2 novel missense mutations, A1343V and P1390T, were observed only in 
patients with bicuspid aortic valves and tricuspid aortic aneurysms.
CONCLUSIONS: This targeted analysis involving NOTCH1 exons previously implicated 
in familial and sporadic bicuspid aortic valve demonstrates overrepresentation 
of NOTCH1 missense variants among patients with bicuspid aortic valves and 
thoracic aortic aneurysms. Identification of aneurysm-predisposing 
susceptibility genes may lead to gene-directed surgical therapy of the ascending 
aorta for patients with bicuspid aortic valves.
