Identification of protein-protein interactions is crucial for unraveling 
cellular processes and biochemical mechanisms of signal transduction. Here we 
describe, for the first time, the application of the tandem affinity 
purification (TAP) and LC-MS method to the characterization of protein complexes 
from transgenic mice. The TAP strategy developed in transgenic mice allows the 
emplacement of complexes in their physiological environment in contact with 
proteins that might only be specifically expressed in certain tissues while 
simultaneously ensuring the right stoichiometry of the TAP protein versus their 
binding partners and represents a novelty in proteomics approaches used so far. 
Mouse lines expressing TAP-tagged 14-3-3zeta protein were generated, and protein 
interactions were determined. 14-3-3 proteins are general regulators of cell 
signaling and represent up to 1% of the total brain protein. This study allowed 
the identification of almost 40 novel 14-3-3zeta-binding proteins. Biochemical 
and functional characterization of some of these interactions revealed new 
mechanisms of action of 14-3-3zeta in several signaling pathways, such as 
glutamate receptor signaling via binding to homer homolog 3 (Homer 3) and in 
cytoskeletal rearrangements and spine morphogenesis by binding and regulating 
the activity of the signaling complex formed by G protein-coupled receptor 
kinase-interactor 1 (GIT1) and p21-activated kinase-interacting exchange factor 
beta (betaPIX).
