Signalling through Notch receptors requires ligand-induced cleavage to release 
the intracellular domain, which acts as a transcriptional activator in the 
nucleus. Deregulated Notch1 signalling has been implicated in mammary 
tumorigenesis; however the mechanisms underlying Notch activation in breast 
cancer remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the prolyl-isomerase Pin1 
interacts with Notch1 and affects Notch1 activation. Pin1 potentiates Notch1 
cleavage by gamma-secretase, leading to an increased release of the active 
intracellular domain and ultimately enhancing Notch1 transcriptional and 
tumorigenic activity. We found that Notch1 directly induces transcription of 
Pin1, thereby generating a positive loop. In human breast cancers, we observed a 
strong correlation between Pin1 overexpression and high levels of activated 
Notch1. Thus, the molecular circuitry established by Notch1 and Pin1 may have a 
key role in cancer.
