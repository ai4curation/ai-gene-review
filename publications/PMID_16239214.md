How genetic and environmental factors interact in Parkinson disease is poorly 
understood. We have now compared the patterns of vulnerability and rescue of 
Caenorhabditis elegans with genetic modifications of three different genetic 
factors implicated in Parkinson disease (PD). We observed that expressing 
alpha-synuclein, deleting parkin (K08E3.7), or knocking down DJ-1 (B0432.2) or 
parkin produces similar patterns of pharmacological vulnerability and rescue. C. 
elegans lines with these genetic changes were more vulnerable than nontransgenic 
nematodes to mitochondrial complex I inhibitors, including rotenone, 
fenperoximate, pyridaben, or stigmatellin. In contrast, the genetic 
manipulations did not increase sensitivity to paraquat, sodium azide, divalent 
metal ions (Fe(II) or Cu(II)), or etoposide compared with the nontransgenic 
nematodes. Each of the PD-related lines was also partially rescued by the 
antioxidant probucol, the mitochondrial complex II activator, 
D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, or the anti-apoptotic bile acid tauroursodeoxycholic 
acid. Complete protection in all lines was achieved by combining 
d-beta-hydroxybutyrate with tauroursodeoxycholic acid but not with probucol. 
These results show that diverse PD-related genetic modifications disrupt the 
mitochondrial function in C. elegans, and they raise the possibility that 
mitochondrial disruption is a pathway shared in common by many types of familial 
PD.
