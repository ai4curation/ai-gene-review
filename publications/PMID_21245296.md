The assembly of MHC class I molecules is governed by stringent endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) quality control mechanisms. MHC class I heavy chains that fail to 
achieve their native conformation in complex with β2-microglobulin (β2m) and 
peptide are targeted for ER-associated degradation. This requires ubiquitination 
of the MHC class I heavy chain and its dislocation from the ER to the cytosol 
for proteasome-mediated degradation, although the cellular machinery involved in 
this process is unknown. Using an siRNA functional screen in β2m-depleted cells, 
we identify an essential role for the E3 ligase HRD1 (Synoviolin) together with 
the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2J1 in the ubiquitination and dislocation 
of misfolded MHC class I heavy chains. HRD1 is also required for the 
ubiquitination and degradation of the naturally occurring 
hemochromatosis-associated HFE-C282Y mutant, which is unable to bind β2m. In the 
absence of HRD1, misfolded HLA-B27 accumulated in cells with a normal MHC class 
I assembly pathway, and HRD1 depletion prevented the appearance of low levels of 
cytosolic unfolded MHC I heavy chains. HRD1 and UBE2J1 associate in a complex 
together with non-β2m bound MHC class I heavy chains, Derlin 1, and p97 and 
discriminate misfolded MHC class I from conformational MHC I-β2m-peptide 
heterotrimers. Together these data support a physiological role for HRD1 and 
UBE2J1 in the homeostatic regulation of MHC class I assembly and expression.
