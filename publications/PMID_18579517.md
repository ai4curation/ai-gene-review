Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF-1) and T cell factor (TCF-1) are 
downstream effectors of the Wnt signaling pathway and are involved in the 
regulation of T cell development in the thymus. LEF-1 and TCF-1 are also 
expressed in mature peripheral primary T cells, but their expression is 
down-regulated following T cell activation. Although the decisive roles of LEF-1 
and TCF-1 in the early stages of T cell development are well documented, the 
functions of these factors in mature peripheral T cells are largely unknown. 
Recently, LEF-1 was shown to suppress Th2 cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4), -5, 
and -13 expression from the developing Th2 cells that overexpress LEF-1 through 
retrovirus gene transduction. In this study, we further investigated the 
expression and functions of LEF-1 and TCF-1 in peripheral CD4+ T cells and 
revealed that LEF-1 is dominantly expressed in Th1 but not in Th2 cells. We 
identified a high affinity LEF-1-binding site in the negative regulatory element 
of the IL-4 promoter. Knockdown LEF-1 expression by LEF-1-specific small 
interfering RNA resulted in an increase in the IL-4 mRNA expression. This study 
further confirms a negative regulatory role of LEF-1 in mature peripheral T 
cells. Furthermore, we found that IL-4 stimulation possesses a negative effect 
on the expressions of LEF-1 and TCF-1 in primary T cells, suggesting a positive 
feedback effect of IL-4 on IL4 gene expression.
