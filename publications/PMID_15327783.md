Intercellular interactions within the branchial arch (BA) system is essential 
for craniofacial development. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), produced by the branchial 
epithelium and core mesenchyme, acts on cranial neural crest-derived 
ectomesenchymcal cells expressing endothelin A receptor (ETAR) and regulates 
expression of crucial genes such as Dlx6, a member of distalless homeobox gene 
family, and its downstream target dHAND, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription 
factor. To investigate the role of ET-1 and subsequent signaling cascades in BA 
development, we examined when and how they activate dHAND and Dlx6 expression. 
ETAR blockade by BQ123 in mouse embryo culture has revealed that ET-1/ETAR 
signaling is critical for dHAND and Dlx6 expression in the mandibular arch 
mesenchyme around embryonic day (E)8.75-E9.0 and becomes dispensable by E9.5. 
dHAND and Dlx6 expression after E9.5 was dependent on the presence of the 
epithelium, which was partly mediated by FGF-like signals. These findings 
indicate that ET-1/ETAR and subsequent epithelial signals are sequentially 
involved in BA development by maintaining dHAND and Dlx6 expression. 
Furthermore, discordance of dHAND and Dlx6 expression domains and heterogeneity 
with respect to dependency on ET-1 and FGF-like signals suggest that genetic 
hierarchy involving Dlx6 and dHAND is differently controlled among subdomains 
within the mandibular arch.
