Mutations in the Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene, first described in 
2004 have now emerged as the most important genetic finding in both autosomal 
dominant and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). While a formidable research 
effort has ensued since the initial gene discovery, little is known of either 
the normal or the pathological role of LRRK2. We have created lines of mice that 
express human wild-type (hWT) or G2019S Lrrk2 via bacterial artificial 
chromosome (BAC) transgenesis. In vivo analysis of the dopaminergic system 
revealed abnormal dopamine neurotransmission in both hWT and G2019S transgenic 
mice evidenced by a decrease in extra-cellular dopamine levels, which was 
detected without pharmacological manipulation. Immunopathological analysis 
revealed changes in localization and increased phosphorylation of microtubule 
binding protein tau in G2019S mice. Quantitative biochemical analysis confirmed 
the presence of differential phospho-tau species in G2019S mice but 
surprisingly, upon dephosphorylation the tau isoform banding pattern in G2019S 
mice remained altered. This suggests that other post-translational modifications 
of tau occur in G2019S mice. We hypothesize that Lrrk2 may impact on tau 
processing which subsequently leads to increased phosphorylation. Our models 
will be useful for further understanding of the mechanistic actions of LRRK2 and 
future therapeutic screening.
