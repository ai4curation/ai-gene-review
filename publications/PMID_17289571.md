Yeast cells arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle upon exposure to mating 
pheromones. As cells commit to a new cycle, G1 CDK activity (Cln/CDK) inhibits 
signaling through the mating MAPK cascade. Here we show that the target of this 
inhibition is Ste5, the MAPK cascade scaffold protein. Cln/CDK disrupts Ste5 
membrane localization by phosphorylating a cluster of sites that flank a small, 
basic, membrane-binding motif in Ste5. Effective inhibition of Ste5 signaling 
requires multiple phosphorylation sites and a substantial accumulation of 
negative charge, which suggests that Ste5 acts as a sensor for high G1 CDK 
activity. Thus, Ste5 is an integration point for both external and internal 
signals. When Ste5 cannot be phosphorylated, pheromone triggers an aberrant 
arrest of cells outside G1 either in the presence or absence of the 
CDK-inhibitor protein Far1. These findings define a mechanism and physiological 
benefit of restricting antiproliferative signaling to G1.

Yeast cells arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle upon exposure to mating pheromones. As cells commit to a new cycle, G1 CDK activity (Cln/CDK) inhibits signaling through the mating MAPK cascade. Here, we show that the target of this inhibition is Ste5, the MAPK cascade scaffold protein. Cln/CDK phosphorylates a cluster of sites flanking a small, basic membrane-binding motif in Ste5, thereby disrupting Ste5 membrane localization. Effective inhibition of Ste5 signaling requires multiple phosphorylation sites and a substantial accumulation of negative charge, suggesting that Ste5 acts as a sensor for high G1 CDK activity. Thus, Ste5 is an integration point for both external and internal signals. When Ste5 cannot be phosphorylated, pheromone triggers an aberrant arrest of cells outside G1, either in the presence or absence of the CDK inhibitor protein Far1. These findings define a mechanism and physiological benefit of restricting antiproliferative signaling to G1.
