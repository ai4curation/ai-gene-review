Prior studies have revealed that alternative mRNA splicing of the mouse NKG2D 
gene generates receptors that associate with either the DAP10 or DAP12 
transmembrane adapter signaling proteins. We report that NKG2D function is 
normal in human patients lacking functional DAP12, indicating that DAP10 is 
sufficient for human NKG2D signal transduction. Further, we show that human 
NKG2D is incapable of associating with DAP12 and provide evidence that 
structural differences in the transmembrane of mouse and human NKG2D account for 
the species-specific difference for this immune receptor.
