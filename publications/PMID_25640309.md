Despite the remarkable progress achieved in the identification of specific genes 
involved in breast cancer (BC), our understanding of their complex functioning 
is still limited. In this manuscript, we systematically explore the existence of 
direct physical interactions between the products of BC core and associated 
genes. Our aim is to generate a protein interaction network of BC-associated 
gene products and suggest potential molecular mechanisms to unveil their role in 
the disease. In total, we report 599 novel high-confidence interactions among 44 
BC core, 54 BC candidate/associated and 96 newly identified proteins. Our 
findings indicate that this network-based approach is indeed a robust inference 
tool to pinpoint new potential players and gain insight into the underlying 
mechanisms of those proteins with previously unknown roles in BC. To illustrate 
the power of our approach, we provide initial validation of two BC-associated 
proteins on the alteration of DNA damage response as a result of specific 
re-wiring interactions. Overall, our BC-related network may serve as a framework 
to integrate clinical and molecular data and foster novel global therapeutic 
strategies.
