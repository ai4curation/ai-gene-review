Expansion of polymorphic glutamine (Q) numbers present at the protein Huntingtin 
(Htt) beyond 36Q results in its misfolding and aggregation, and the aggregates 
recruit several other proteins. Here we show that HYPK, initially identified as 
an Htt-interacting partner by yeast two-hybrid assay, physically interacts with 
N-terminal Htt in Neuro2A cells and alters the numbers and distribution of 
aggregates formed by N-terminal Htt with 40Q. HYPK also alters the kinetics of 
mutated N-terminal Htt-mediated aggregate formation. Fluorescence recovery after 
photobleaching studies reveal that over-expression of HYPK results in the 
appearance of Htt poly Q aggregates, which upon bleaching recovers approximately 
80% of initial fluorescence intensity within 6 min. Fluorescence loss in 
photobleaching studies indicate loss off fluorescence intensity of the 
aggregates with time in presence of HYPK. Over-expression of this protein 
reduces poly Q-mediated caspase-2, caspase-3 and caspase-8 activations, whereas 
gamma ray-induced activations of these enzymes are not affected. In vitro and in 
vivo studies demonstrate that HYPK possesses a novel chaperone-like activity. We 
conclude that HYPK, without having any sequence similarity with known 
chaperones, plays an effective role in protecting neuronal cells against 
apoptosis induced by mutated N-terminal Htt by modulating the aggregate 
formation.
