We present a strategy for generating and analyzing comprehensive 
genetic-interaction maps, termed E-MAPs (epistatic miniarray profiles), 
comprising quantitative measures of aggravating or alleviating interactions 
between gene pairs. Crucial to the interpretation of E-MAPs is their 
high-density nature made possible by focusing on logically connected gene 
subsets and including essential genes. Described here is the analysis of an 
E-MAP of genes acting in the yeast early secretory pathway. Hierarchical 
clustering, together with novel analytical strategies and experimental 
verification, revealed or clarified the role of many proteins involved in 
extensively studied processes such as sphingolipid metabolism and retention of 
HDEL proteins. At a broader level, analysis of the E-MAP delineated pathway 
organization and components of physical complexes and illustrated the 
interconnection between the various secretory processes. Extension of this 
strategy to other logically connected gene subsets in yeast and higher 
eukaryotes should provide critical insights into the functional/organizational 
principles of biological systems.
