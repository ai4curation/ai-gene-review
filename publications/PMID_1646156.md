Subunit Vb of mammalian cytochrome c oxidase (COX; EC 1.9.3.1) is encoded by a 
nuclear gene and assembled with the other 12 COX subunits encoded in both 
mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. We have cloned the gene for human COX subunit Vb 
(COX5B) and determined the exon-intron structure by both hybridization analysis 
and DNA sequencing. The gene contains five exons and four introns; the four 
coding exons span a region of approximately 2.4 kb. The 5' end of the COX5B gene 
is GC-rich and contains many HpaII sites. Genomic Southern blot analysis of 
human DNA probed with the human COX Vb cDNA identified eight restriction 
fragments containing COX Vb-related sequences that were mapped to different 
chromosomes with panels of human x Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids. Because 
only one of these fragments hybridized with a 210-bp probe from intron 4, we 
conclude that there is a single expressed gene for COX subunit Vb in the human 
genome. We have mapped this gene to chromosome 2, region cen-q13.
