The G1 cyclin Cln3 is a key activator of cell-cycle entry in budding yeast. Here 
we show that Whi3, a negative G1 regulator of Cln3, interacts in vivo with the 
cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 and regulates its localization in the cell. 
Efficient interaction with Cdc28 depends on an N-terminal domain of Whi3 that is 
also required for cytoplasmic localization of Cdc28, and for proper regulation 
of G1 length and filamentous growth. On the other hand, nuclear accumulation of 
Cdc28 requires the nuclear localization signal of Cln3, which is also found in 
Whi3 complexes. Both Cln3 and Cdc28 are mainly cytoplasmic during early G1, and 
become nuclear in late G1. However, Whi3-deficient cells show a distinct nuclear 
accumulation of Cln3 and Cdc28 already in early G1. We propose that Whi3 
constitutes a cytoplasmic retention device for Cln3-Cdc28 complexes, thus 
defining a key G1 event in yeast cells.

Abstract

The G1 cyclin Cln3 is a key activator of cell-cycle entry in budding yeast. Here we show that Whi3, a negative G1 regulator of Cln3, interacts in vivo with the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 and regulates its localization in the cell. Efficient interaction with Cdc28 depends on an N-terminal domain of Whi3 that is also required for cytoplasmic localization of Cdc28, and for proper regulation of G1 length and filamentous growth. On the other hand, nuclear accumulation of Cdc28 requires the nuclear localization signal of Cln3, which is also found in Whi3 complexes. Both Cln3 and Cdc28 are mainly cytoplasmic during early G1, and become nuclear in late G1. However, Whi3-deficient cells show a distinct nuclear accumulation of Cln3 and Cdc28 already in early G1. We propose that Whi3 constitutes a cytoplasmic retention device for Cln3–Cdc28 complexes, thus defining a key G1 event in yeast cells.

Introduction

While a single cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk), termed Cdc28, is sufficient to drive the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , at least nine cyclins act with some redundancy at different stages of the cycle: Cln1, Cln2 and Cln3 in the G1 phase; Clb5 and Clb6 in the S phase; and Clb1, Clb2, Clb3 and Clb4 in the G2 and M phases ( Futcher, 1996 ; Mendenhall and Hodge, 1998 ). Binding of regulatory cyclin subunits to Cdc28 induces a conformational change that is required for kinase activity. As Cdc28 executes diverse events through the cell cycle, cyclin moieties are presumed to provide the required specificity by participating in substrate recognition ( Morgan, 1995 ). On the other hand, most cyclins are expressed only at particular times during the cell cycle, thus imposing temporal constraints to each cyclin–Cdc28 complex. An exception to this rule is Cln3, a cyclin with a key role in triggering cell-cycle entry that is nonetheless present at rather constant levels during late G1 and the G1/S transition ( Tyers et al , 1993 ).

The G1 cyclin Cln3 is the most upstream effector of cell-cycle entry. In combination with Cdc28, Cln3 activates the expression of a large set of G1/S genes that are regulated by the transcriptional factors SBF and MBF ( Andrews and Herskowitz, 1989 ; Nasmyth and Dirick, 1991 ; Lowndes et al , 1992 ; Tyers et al , 1993 ; Dirick et al , 1995 ; Stuart and Wittenberg, 1995 ; Spellman et al , 1998 ). Cln3 contains a functional bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the C-terminus, and seems to perform its essential functions as a nuclear protein ( Edgington and Futcher, 2001 ; Miller and Cross, 2001 ). Transcriptional induction by Cln3–Cdc28 involves the loading of RNA polymerase II onto SBF-containing promoters in late G1 ( Cosma et al , 2001 ). Nutrients, which are among the most important trophic factors for yeast cells, control cell-cycle entry by regulating Cln3 expression at different levels ( Huble et al , 1993 ; Barbet et al , 1996 ; Gallego et al , 1997 ; Hall et al , 1998 ; Newcomb et al , 2002 ). However, when nutritional and other external signals are kept constant, additional mechanisms must exist to restrict Cln3–Cdc28-dependent activation of gene expression to late G1, perhaps after some cell size and/or growth requirements have been met. Cell division is coupled to cell growth in budding yeast by multiple mechanisms ( Jorgensen et al , 2002 ), and CLN3 itself had been first identified as a mutation that conferred a small cell size phenotype ( Sudbery et al , 1980 ). Similarly, WHI3 was isolated as a gene involved in cell size regulation ( Nash et al , 2001 ), and we have shown recently that Whi3 is a cytoplasmic protein that exerts a negative role on Cln3 activity in G1 ( Garí et al , 2001 ).

Here we show that Whi3 is associated to Cdc28 in vivo , and restricts its cellular distribution to the cytoplasm. Whi3 contains an N-terminal domain required for (1) interaction with Cdc28, (2) cytoplasmic retention of Cdc28, (3) proper regulation of cell-cycle entry, and (4) initiation of developmental programs in G1 such as filamentous growth. We also show that both Cdc28 and Cln3 are cytoplasmic in early G1 cells and accumulate in the nucleus in late G1, while they are already nuclear in early G1 cells deficient for Whi3. Our results suggest that Whi3 constitutes a cytoplasmic retention device for Cln3–Cdc28 complexes, thus defining a key G1 event in the regulatory network that controls cell-cycle entry in yeast cells.

Discussion

We have shown that Whi3 interacts with Cdc28 in vivo and plays a key role in retaining both Cdc28 and Cln3 in the cytoplasm until late G1. We have identified an N-terminal domain in Whi3 that is required for efficient interaction with and cytoplasmic localization of Cdc28. This CRR is also essential for key aspects of Whi3 function such as G1 length regulation and filamentous growth, suggesting that the interaction between Whi3 and Cdc28 is part of a cytoplasmic retention mechanism with an important role in regulating G1 events.

Whi3 had been identified as a putative RNA-binding protein involved in cell size regulation ( Nash et al , 2001 ). In addition, we had shown that Whi3 binds the CLN3 mRNA and plays an important negative role in all functional aspects of Cln3 activity, that is regulation of G1 length, and modulation of cell fate options such as mating, meiosis and filamentous growth ( Garí et al , 2001 ). Here we propose that Whi3 recruits Cdc28 and retains Cln3–Cdc28 complexes in the cytoplasm during G1. We have detected Whi3 in complexes with Cln3, showing that these multimeric complexes do exist, although perhaps only transiently. Moreover, the presence of Whi3 in Cln3 immunoprecipitates required the cyclin box of Cln3 that is needed for binding to Cdc28, suggesting that Cdc28 acts as a linking bridge between Whi3 and Cln3. Supporting the notion that Whi3 might localize Cln3–Cdc28 complex formation, we have identified in Whi3-TAP complexes a putative candidate for the Ssa1,2 chaperones. Although the presence of these proteins may reflect unspecific interactions created during the affinity-purification procedures, Ssa1,2 have been involved in the formation of active cyclin–Cdk complexes ( Yaglom et al , 1996 ; Honey et al , 2001 ). In addition, the model requires that Whi3 should recruit Cdc28 prior to the synthesis of the Cln3 cyclin and the concomitant activation of Cdc28. We have found that Whi3 binds Cdc28 independently of the presence of cyclins (our unpublished data). Finally, two different fusions of the Cln3 NLS to GFP expressed at different levels from the tet promoter produced proteins that accumulated in the nucleus independently of Whi3 (our unpublished data), suggesting that retention is not due to a direct masking effect of Whi3 on the Cln3 NLS. In summary, these data suggest that recruitment of Cdc28 may be important for Whi3 to retain newly formed Cln3–Cdc28 complexes in the cytoplasm.

Figure 7B outlines our current model for Whi3 function, where both the RNA-binding domain (RRM) and the CRR are required. The Whi3 RRM would bind the CLN3 mRNA and restrict Cln3 synthesis to a local molecular environment, while the Whi3 CRR would be responsible for retaining some Cdc28 molecules in the same molecular environment, so newly synthesized Cln3 polypeptides would bind preferentially the retained Cdc28 molecules. By using a double 3HA-tagged strain for Whi3 and Cdc28 we have estimated that Cdc28 molecules are five times more abundant than Whi3 molecules in G1 cells (our unpublished results). In other words, only a fraction of Cdc28 may be found in complexes with Whi3. Thus, when Whi3 lacks the RRM domain, CLN3 mRNA translation would take place away from Cdc28–Whi3 complexes, so newly synthesized Cln3 polypeptides would readily bind to free excess Cdc28 molecules, thus escaping the retention mechanism. Accordingly, a 3- to 4-fold overproduction of Whi3ΔRRM does not cause any cell-cycle defect ( Garí et al , 2001 ). On the other hand, if Whi3 lacks the CRR domain, no Cdc28 molecules would be subject to retention, so newly synthesized Cln3 polypeptides would also bind free Cdc28 molecules and escape the retention mechanism. This model fits with the fact that both domains are equally important for Whi3 function.

We do not know whether the interaction between Cdc28 and Whi3 is direct or indirect. Our attempts to detect this interaction in vitro with purified proteins have so far been unsuccessful. However, similarly to the interaction between Cdc28 and G1 cyclins ( Deshaies and Kirschner, 1995 ; Gerber et al , 1995 ), the possibility that specific chaperones and/or other proteins are required to induce a direct interaction should still be considered. Cdc28 had been found in the cytoplasm partially associated with a large structural matrix ( Wittenberg et al , 1987 ). Although Whi3 shows a behavior very similar when using the same differential centrifugation conditions used by these authors, we do not know whether the fraction of Cdc28 bound to Whi3 is the same as they defined as being associated to a cytoplasmic matrix.

Here we show that Whi3 is important for yeast cells to arrest efficiently in G1 under nutritionally compromised conditions, suggesting that Whi3 may play a role in coordinating cell growth in G1 and cell-cycle progression. When Cln3 is at low levels due to limited trophic signals, newly synthesized Cln3 polypeptides could be efficiently retained on Cdc28 molecules bound to Whi3, and prevent these complexes from reaching their nuclear targets, namely SBF and MBF, thus holding the cell in G1. As Cln3 synthesis rates are extremely dependent on nutrient availability ( Barbet et al , 1996 ; Gallego et al , 1997 ; Polymenis and Schmidt, 1997 ; Newcomb et al , 2002 ), such a mechanism would narrow the trophic signal interval at which the cell would commit to a new cycle. In agreement with this hypothesis, a moderate Cln3 overexpression is able to override the negative regulation exerted by Whi3 in G1 ( Garí et al , 2001 ; Nash et al , 2001 ).

How the retention potential of Whi3 is modulated to allow the nuclear accumulation of Cln3–Cdc28 in late G1 is still an open question. Although we have not observed changes in the affinity of Whi3 for Cdc28 during entry into the cell cycle, we cannot discard the possibility that the sustained presence of Cln3–Cdc28 complexes bound to Whi3 during G1 might affect their respective functions, favor a transient release of the G1 cyclin–Cdk complex, and allow the nuclear accumulation of Cln3–Cdc28 in late G1 ( Figure 6B ). However, Whi3 did not inhibit Cdc28 in in vitro kinase assays, and neither Cln3–Cdc28 nor Cln2–Cdc28 was able to phosphorylate Whi3 in vitro (unpublished data). Alternatively, Whi3 could also locally recruit some other factors that might modulate Cln3–Cdc28 complex formation and/or retention in late G1. Here we have shown that the RNA-binding domain of Whi3 is essential for cytoplasmic retention of Cdc28, but not for the interaction. On the other hand, we have found in Whi3-TAP complexes a putative candidate for Ded1, an essential translation initiation factor ( Chuang et al , 1997 ). These data suggest that Whi3 could recruit some mRNAs to localize their translation. In this regard, a three-hybrid screen using Whi3 as RNA-binding bait yielded a large number of RNA sequences with one or more copies of the GCAU tetranucleotide (DJ SenGupta, personal communication). Remarkably, the CLN3 mRNA contains two regions with five tetranucleotides each, the first within a fragment of 150 nt at the 5′UTR, and the second within 200 nt at the 3′ region of the ORF, which we had found to be important for efficient binding to the Whi3 RRM in vitro ( Garí et al , 2001 ). However, as the presence of such a tetranucleotide is obviously not restricted to the CLN3 mRNA, the RRM of Whi3 could also cause local synthesis of other proteins in addition to Cln3 to modulate the retention of Cln3–Cdc28 complexes in the cytoplasm during G1.

The Whi3-mediated step may help define the nuclear accumulation of Cln3–Cdc28 as a key G1 event. In this respect, we can now subdivide the G1 phase into three different molecular events, which find a clear parallelism when comparing higher eukaryotes and budding yeast. The early G1 period could be defined by the sustained expression of G1 cyclins, Cln3 in yeast ( Tyers et al , 1993 ) and D-type cyclins in higher eukaryotes (reviewed by Sherr, 1995 ), which would take place at transcriptional or translational levels ( Aktas et al , 1997 ; Gallego et al , 1997 ; Polymenis and Schmidt, 1997 ; Weber et al , 1997 ; Muise-Helmericks et al , 1998 ; Newcomb et al , 2002 ) depending on the nature of the proliferation signal, and would be especially noticeable when cells initiate the cell cycle from a G0 or resting state. The mid-G1 period would be defined by the nuclear accumulation of the corresponding G1 cyclin–Cdk. Here we have shown that Cln3–Cdc28 accumulates in the nucleus during G1 in a similar manner to what is described for cyclin D–Cdk4 in higher eukaryotes ( Baldin et al , 1993 ). However, there is still no evidence for a homolog of Whi3 or an analogous cytoplasmic retention mechanism that could regulate the localization of cyclin D–Cdk4 complexes during G1 in higher eukaryotes. Export of cyclin D1 to the cytoplasm during the S phase involves phosphorylation by GSK-3β and depends on Crm1 in higher eukaryotes ( Diehl et al , 1998 ; Alt et al , 2000 ). We have found that Cln3 also becomes cytoplasmic during the S phase, suggesting that an export mechanism may also operate in yeast cells. Finally, transcriptional activation of G1/S genes would take place in the late G1 period, mainly mediated by Cdk-dependent phosphorylation of pRB in higher eukaryotic cells ( Weinberg, 1995 ), and by the Cdc28-dependent recruitment of the basal complex onto SBF- and MBF-containing promoters in yeast cells ( Cosma et al , 2001 ). In this regard, although Whi3-deficient cells show a clear accumulation of Cln3 and Cdc28 in the nucleus early in G1, they still display a measurable G1 phase, indicating the existence of additional fences in the nucleus to prevent premature activation of G1/S gene expression. Unraveling the complexity of molecular mechanisms operating at different moments during the G1 phase will allow us to understand how eukaryotic cells integrate a plethora of quantitative signals to take a single and binary decision: to enter or not the cell cycle.
