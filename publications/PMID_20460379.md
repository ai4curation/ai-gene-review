Gadd45alpha is a nuclear protein encoded by a DNA damage-inducible gene. Through 
its interactions with other proteins, Gadd45alpha participates in the regulation 
of DNA repair, cell cycle, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The NMR structure 
of human Gadd45alpha has been determined and shows an alpha/beta fold with two 
long disordered and flexible regions at the N terminus and one of the loops. 
Human Gadd45alpha is predominantly monomeric in solution but exists in 
equilibrium with dimers and other oligomers whose population increases with 
protein concentration. NMR analysis shows that Aurora A interacts through its 
N-terminal domain with a region of human Gadd45alpha encompassing the site of 
dimerization, suggesting that the oligomerization of Gadd45alpha could be a 
regulatory mechanism to modulate its interactions with Aurora A, and possibly 
with other proteins too. However, Gadd45alpha appears to interact only weakly 
with PCNA through its flexible loop, in contrast with previous and contradictory 
reports.

Abstract

Gadd45α is a nuclear protein encoded by a DNA damage-inducible gene. Through its interactions with other proteins, Gadd45α participates in the regulation of DNA repair, cell cycle, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The NMR structure of human Gadd45α has been determined and shows an α/β fold with two long disordered and flexible regions at the N terminus and one of the loops. Human Gadd45α is predominantly monomeric in solution but exists in equilibrium with dimers and other oligomers whose population increases with protein concentration. NMR analysis shows that Aurora A interacts through its N-terminal domain with a region of human Gadd45α encompassing the site of dimerization, suggesting that the oligomerization of Gadd45α could be a regulatory mechanism to modulate its interactions with Aurora A, and possibly with other proteins too. However, Gadd45α appears to interact only weakly with PCNA through its flexible loop, in contrast with previous and contradictory reports.

Introduction

The Gadd45 4 family of proteins consists of isoforms α, β, and γ, with sequence identities of ∼56% ( 1 ). Transcription of the Gadd45 genes is induced by DNA-damaging agents and other cellular stresses and is associated with growth arrest.

Human Gadd45α (hGadd45α) is an acidic protein of low abundance in the cell, localized mainly in the nucleus ( 2 ). It participates in cell growth and cell cycle control, DNA repair, apoptosis, maintenance of genomic stability, and the regulation of signaling pathways ( 3 , 4 ). Gadd45 proteins exert these functions by their interactions with other proteins. hGadd45α interacts with PCNA ( 5 ), an essential factor for DNA replication and repair, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 WAF1 ( 6 ), and with the protein kinases cyclin-dependent kinase 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAPKKK4), and Aurora A ( 7 , 8 ). hGadd45α maintains centrosome stability by down-regulation of Aurora A kinase activity ( 7 ). The pleiotropic effects of hGadd45α have partly been explained by its interaction with the xeroderma pigmentosum complementing group G endonuclease and the promotion of DNA repair, which erases methylation marks relieving epigenetic gene silencing ( 9 ). However, the role of Gadd45α in active DNA demethylation is still controversial ( 10 , 11 ). Gadd45α interacts with the four core histones of the nucleosome and modifies the access to DNA on damaged chromatin ( 12 ). Gadd45 proteins can form oligomers, which could have a role in regulating their function ( 13 ).

We describe the NMR structure of the full-length monomeric hGadd45α protein, which adopts a globular α/β fold with two long disordered and flexible regions at the N terminus and one of the loops. The folded region is similar to the recent crystal structure of a construct of the murine Gadd45γ isoform truncated at the N terminus, which forms dimers ( 14 ). We show that hGadd45α interacts with Aurora A through a region opposite to the location of the flexible protein chain termini and encompassing a putative dimerization site, whereas it interacts with PCNA through the flexible loop albeit very weakly.

CONCLUSIONS

Self-association of hGadd45α has been detected in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation of the protein expressed with different tags, as has formation of hetero-oligomers of Gadd45 isoforms ( 13 ). However, it is unclear whether this association is direct or mediated by other cellular components. The relevance of hetero-oligomerization is also unclear, as the expression of each gene is induced by different signals, human Gadd45 α being the only one up-regulated by p53 ( 28 ). Oligomeric hGadd45α does not protect UV-irradiated nucleosomes from nuclease digestion, indicating that it loses the ability to modify DNA accessibility on damaged chromatin ( 13 ); thus, the oligomeric state of hGadd45α may affect its function. Our results show that hGadd45α is primarily monomeric, in dynamic equilibrium with minor populations of oligomeric forms. Competition and shifting of this equilibrium could be the basis for a temporal/spatial regulatory mechanism of the interactions with different effectors in the nucleus. The direct interaction with Aurora A through an overlapping site is consistent with a regulatory role of hGadd45α self-association, which could release active Aurora A.
