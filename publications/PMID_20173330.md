Increasing evidence supports a putative link between LRRK2 function and the MAP 
kinase cascades. We recently demonstrated that LRRK2 binds to MKK6, -3, and -7. 
Previous studies demonstrated that scaffold proteins are essential in the 
regulation of subcellular localization of stress kinase complexes. The c-jun 
NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting proteins (JIPs) are a group of scaffold 
proteins that play an important role in the regulation of MAP kinase signaling 
cascades. JIP1-3 are known to regulate the specificity and localization of the 
JNK pathway, while JIP4 is a specific scaffolding protein for the p38 pathway. 
We demonstrate that LRRK2 binds to JIP1-4, and is associated with increased 
levels of total JIP1, -3, -4, oligomeric JIP and ubiquitinated JIP. These 
results are consistent with a putative role of LRRK2 in regulating the stress 
kinase cascade.
