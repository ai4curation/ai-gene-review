Conditional deletion of Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome ten) 
in differentiated cortical and hippocampal neurons in the mouse results in 
seizures, macrocephaly, social interaction deficits and anxiety, reminiscent of 
human autism spectrum disorder. Here we extended our previous examination of 
these mice using electroencephalogram/electromyogram (EEG/EMG) monitoring and 
found age-related increases in spontaneous seizures, which were correlated with 
cellular dispersion in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Increased spontaneous 
locomotor activity in the open field on the first and the second day of a 3-day 
continuous study suggested heightened anxiety in Pten mutant mice. In contrast, 
the mutants exhibited decreased wheel running activity, which may reflect 
reduced adaptability to a novel environment. Synchronization to the light-dark 
cycle was normal, but for up to 28 days under constant darkness, the Pten 
mutants maintained a significantly lengthened and remarkably constant 
free-running period of almost exactly 24 h. This result implies the involvement 
of Pten in the maintenance of circadian rhythms, which we interpret as being due 
to an effect on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade.
