Little is understood about the molecular mechanisms underlying the morphogenesis 
of the posterior pole of the heart. Here we show that Wnt2 is expressed 
specifically in the developing inflow tract mesoderm, which generates portions 
of the atria and atrio-ventricular canal. Loss of Wnt2 results in defective 
development of the posterior pole of the heart, resulting in a phenotype 
resembling the human congenital heart syndrome complete common atrio-ventricular 
canal. The number and proliferation of posterior second heart field progenitors 
is reduced in Wnt2(-/-) mutants. Moreover, these defects can be rescued in a 
temporally restricted manner through pharmacological inhibition of Gsk-3beta. We 
also show that Wnt2 works in a feedforward transcriptional loop with Gata6 to 
regulate posterior cardiac development. These data reveal a molecular pathway 
regulating the posterior cardiac mesoderm and demonstrate that cardiovascular 
defects caused by loss of Wnt signaling can be rescued pharmacologically in 
vivo.

Abstract

Although the molecular pathways governing the development of the anterior pole of the heart have been the subject of intense investigation, little is understood about the molecular mechanisms underlying the morphogenesis of the posterior pole of the heart which generates the atria, pulmonary veins and portions of the atrio-ventricular canal. Here we show that Wnt2 is expressed specifically in the developing inflow tract mesoderm in a domain encompassing the dorsal mesocardium and dorsal mesenchymal protrusion which generates portions of the atria and atrio-ventricular cushions. Loss of Wnt2 results in defective development of the atrial myocardium, atrio-ventricular canal, and pulmonary veins resulting in a phenotype resembling the human congenital heart syndrome complete common atrio-ventricular canal . The dorsal mesocardium and dorsal mesenchymal protrusion overlaps spatially with posterior second heart field progenitors and we show that the number and proliferation of these progenitors is reduced in Wnt2-/- mutants. Remarkably, these defects can be rescued in vivo in a temporally restricted manner through pharmacological inhibition of Gsk-3β, indicating that Wnt2 regulates canonical Wnt signaling in the posterior cardiac mesoderm. Molecular and genetic analysis shows that Wnt2 works in a feed-forward transcriptional loop with Gata6 to regulate posterior cardiac development. These data reveal an important new molecular pathway regulating cardiac inflow tract development and demonstrates that such defects in the second heart field can be rescued pharmacologically in vivo.

Introduction

Cardiac morphogenesis occurs in a regionally distinctive manner with specific molecular programs directing the development of spatially distinct regions of the heart. The mammalian heart develops from a crescent shaped mesodermal population of cells that are readily apparent by E7.5 of mouse development. The heart displays distinctive anterior-posterior patterning which is most obvious in the divergent morphological origins and functions of the atria and ventricles. Gene expression analysis has demonstrated that atrial versus ventricular programs are active as early as the cardiac crescent stage of development (E7.5) suggesting that molecular pathways that define these different cardiac lineages are active before morphological distinction of these chambers. In addition to the anterior-posterior patterning events, the mesoderm that contributes to the heart can also be divided into two separate origins, the first heart field (FHF) and the second heart field (SHF). Important progress has been made in understanding the contribution of the SHF to development of the anterior portion of the heart including the outlflow tract and right ventricle ( Cai et al., 2003 ).

In contrast to the advances made in understanding the mechanisms underlying development of the anterior pole and outflow tract of the heart, less is understood about the development of the posterior pole or inflow tract of the heart. Although there are important similarities in the derivation of anterior and posterior cardiac progenitors including Islet1 (Isl1) expression ( Snarr et al., 2007a ), several studies have described posterior cardiac progenitors differing from their more anterior neighbors at the morphological and molecular level ( Anderson et al., 2006 ; Christoffels et al., 2006 ). Posterior cardiac progenitors are thought to generate portions of the inflow tract including the atria and atrio-ventricular (AV) canal ( Anderson et al., 2006 ). In particular, the dorsal mesenchymal protrusion, a region that is encompassed within the posterior Isl1+ cardiac mesoderm population, generates portions of the atrial septum, AV canal, and inflow tract myocardium ( Snarr et al., 2007b ). The importance of the cardiac inflow tract and its derivatives is underscored by multiple congenital cardiovascular anomalies including complete common atrio-ventricular canal (CCAVC), atrial septal defects, and abnormal pulmonary venous return (reviewed in ( Allwork, 1982 ; Strauss, 1998 )). Thus, further investigation into both the morphological development as well as molecular pathways required for inflow tract development will have an important impact on our understanding of congenital disease associated with this region of the cardiovascular system.

Wnt signaling has been shown to regulate the development of the anterior portion of the heart including the outflow tract and right ventricle ( Ai et al., 2007 ; Cohen et al., 2007 ; Kwon et al., 2007 ; Lin et al., 2007 ; Qyang et al., 2007 ). Loss of β-catenin leads to decreased numbers of anterior Isl1 positive (Isl1+) SHF progenitors whereas stabilization of β-catenin expands the number of these progenitors. Isl1+ SHF progenitors are also found in the posterior region of the developing cardiac mesoderm ( Lin et al., 2007 ; Qyang et al., 2007 ). Although previous reports suggest that the posterior SHF progenitors contribute to the cardiac inflow tract mesoderm including the atria ( Galli et al., 2008 ), the function of this subpopulation of SHF progenitors as well as the molecular pathways that regulate their expansion and differentiation remains unclear. Here we show that Wnt2, a ligand expressed specifically in the posterior pole of the developing heart, is essential for development and differentiation of posterior structures within the developing heart including the atria, pulmonary veins, and AV canal. The defects in Wnt2-/- mutants resemble the human congenital heart syndrome CCAVC and they can be rescued through pharmacological inhibition of Gsk-3β, indicating that Wnt2 signals through the β-catenin dependent Wnt pathway to regulate cardiac inflow tract development. Moreover, we show that Wnt2 signaling is necessary for Gata6 expression and acts epistatically with Gata6 to regulate cardiac inflow tract development. These data highlight a novel molecular pathway regulating development of the posterior pole of the heart including the cardiac inflow tract that can be pharmacologically rescued with Gsk-3β inhibitors.

Discussion

Development of the posterior pole of the heart including the cardiac inflow tract is poorly understood in comparison to the anterior or outflow region of the heart. In this report, we show that Wnt2, a ligand whose expression is restricted to the posterior pole of the developing heart including the cardiac inflow tract, is essential for expansion of cardiac mesoderm progenitors in this region and subsequent myocardial proliferation and differentiation. These defects in Wnt2-/- mutants results in a phenotype similar to that found in CCAVC, a congenital cardiac syndrome in humans. Importantly, these defects can be rescued in vivo through pharmacological activation of Wnt signaling. We also show that Wnt2 regulates cardiac inflow tract development, in part, through a feed-forward activation of Gata6. Together, these data identify a novel mechanism involving Wnt and Gata factors in regulating the development of posterior cardiac mesoderm and the cardiac inflow tract.

Little is understood about the development of cardiac mesoderm at the posterior pole of the developing vertebrate heart. Isl1-cre and cardiac explant studies using DiI labeling have shown that posterior Isl1+ mesoderm can contribute to the developing atria of the heart ( Cai et al., 2003 ; Galli et al., 2008 ). This region encompasses the DMP which is thought to be an important contributor to the development of multiple structures within the cardiac inflow tract including atria myocardium, primary atrial septum, and AV canal cushions and myocardium ( Snarr et al., 2007a ; Snarr et al., 2007b ). However, little is known about the molecular pathways that regulate the formation and development of the cardiac inflow tract. In contrast, multiple studies have defined specific spatially restricted roles for important transcription factors and signaling pathways in anterior pole development ( Ai et al., 2006 ; Chen et al., 2007 ; Hamblet et al., 2002 ; High et al., 2007 ; Wang et al., 2004 ). Our data show that posterior cardiac mesoderm progenitors are regulated by Wnt2 and play an important role in development of the inflow tract including the atria, AV canal, and pulmonary veins. The clinical importance of the structures defined by the posterior cardiac mesoderm is well known and Wnt2-/- mutants phenotypically resemble humans with CCAVC, an important congenital heart anomaly. The finding that Wnt signaling plays a key role in expansion and differentiation of SHF progenitors both in the posterior pole (reported here) and in the anterior pole ( Ai et al., 2007 ; Cohen et al., 2007 ; Kwon et al., 2007 ; Lin et al., 2007 ; Qyang et al., 2007 ) should spur interest in assessing whether congenital cardiac syndromes that share defects in both posterior and anterior related tissues are due to a common deficiency in this pathway.

We show that loss of Wnt2 can be rescued using LiCl, a known inhibitor of Gsk-3β ( Klein and Melton, 1996 ). Although LiCl has been well studied as an inhibitor of Gsk-3β, it has also been shown to affect other signaling pathways including Akt and IP3 kinase signaling ( Nemoto et al., 2008 ; Raffa and Martinez, 1992 ). The majority of known inhibitors of Wnt signaling impinge upon Gsk-3β activity and their specificity is largely unknown. Our data is the first to our knowledge of an example of LiCl being used to rescue a specific loss of Wnt signaling in mammalian development. These data strongly support the contention that, despite the ability of LiCl to affect multiple pathways, it can be used to inhibit Gsk-3β during development and activate Wnt signaling. Moreover, our data suggest that defects in tissue homoeostasis and development related to deficiencies in Wnt signaling could be positively impacted by treatment with small molecule modulators of Wnt.

The role for Wnt signaling in cardiac development has been studied primarily using loss and gain of function mutants in the critical Wnt pathway component β-catenin. However, β-catenin plays an important role in cell-cell adhesion as well as Wnt signaling thus it has been unclear whether the defects in cardiac loss of gain of function can be wholly attributed to Wnt signaling. Previous reports have described antagonistic affects of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cardiogenesis. Most of these studies have utilized gain of function analysis in Xenopus and in pluripotent cell lines such as embryonic stem cells ( Foley and Mercola, 2005 ; Liu et al., 2007 ; Marvin et al., 2001 ; Pandur et al., 2002 ; Schneider and Mercola, 2001 ; Terami et al., 2004 ; Ueno et al., 2007 ). Our data show that Wnt signaling plays a positive role in cooperation with Gata factors in promoting spatially and temporally specific cardiogenesis. The difference between our data and previous reports can most easily be attributed to a potent role for Wnt signaling in the SHF in a temporally restricted manner. Gain of function studies result in blocking cardiac mesoderm in a proliferative and undifferentiated state resulting in a loss of cardiac marker gene expression. A recent report suggested that Wnt signaling inhibited cardiogenesis by inhibiting Gata factor expression ( Afouda et al., 2008 ). Our data show that Gata6 is a direct target of Wnt signaling, and along with previous data showing that Wnt2 is, in turn, a target of Gata6 in cardiac differentiation of P19 cells ( Alexandrovich et al., 2006 ), suggests that Wnt and Gata factors act in a feed-forward mechanism to drive posterior cardiac progenitor expansion and differentiation and subsequent cardiac inflow tract development.

Although our data focus primarily on the SHF, Wnt2 is expressed at an earlier stage in the cardiac crescent mesoderm ( Monkley et al., 1996 ). Expression of several Wnt ligands has been reported at this earlier stage including Wnt3a, Wnt8a, and Wnt11 ( Eisenberg and Eisenberg, 1999 ; Jaspard et al., 2000 ; Nakamura et al., 2003 ). Conditional inactivation of β-catenin throughout the early cardiac mesoderm using the Mesp1-cre line results in loss of SHF markers Isl1 and Bmp4 ( Klaus et al., 2007 ). In these studies, expression of the FHF markers Tbx5 and Hand1 were not affected by early loss of β-catenin in the precardiac mesoderm. These reports are consistent with our findings that the majority of defects observed in Wnt2 deficient embryos can be attributed to the affect of Wnt2 on SHF progenitors. Moreover, we also show that activation of Wnt signaling from E8-E10, when SHF progenitors are contributing to a large portion of the developing myocardium, is sufficient to rescue the majority of defects in these mutants and the lethal consequences.

We have shown that Wnt2 is required for proper development of the cardiac inflow tract mesoderm and in particular the myocardial component of the atria, AV canal and pulmonary veins resulting in a CCAVC phenotype. Moreover, we have shown that defects in Wnt signaling can be rescued using temporal specific application of pharmacological activators of this pathway in vivo during development. Given the emerging importance of Wnt signaling in cardiac progenitor development, our data indicate that this pathway may be a key integrator of multiple transcriptional and signaling networks required for proper development of the posterior pole of the heart including the cardiac inflow tract.
