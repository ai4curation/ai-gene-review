DAF-16, a forkhead transcription factor, is a key regulator of longevity, 
metabolism and dauer diapause in Caenorhabditis elegans. The precise mechanism 
by which DAF-16 regulates multiple functions, however, is poorly understood. 
Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to identify direct targets of 
DAF-16. We cloned 103 target sequences containing consensus DAF-16 binding sites 
and selected 33 targets for further analysis. Expression of most of these genes 
is regulated in a DAF-16-dependent manner, and inactivation of more than half of 
these genes significantly altered DAF-16-dependent functions, including life 
span, fat storage and dauer formation. Our results show that the ChIP-based 
cloning strategy leads to greater enrichment for DAF-16 target genes than 
previous screening strategies. We also demonstrate that DAF-16 is recruited to 
multiple promoters to coordinate regulation of its downstream targets. The large 
number of target genes discovered provides insight into how DAF-16 controls 
diverse biological functions.
