SNX32 is a member of the evolutionarily conserved Phox (PX) homology domain- and 
Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain- containing sorting nexin (SNX-BAR) family of 
proteins, which play important roles in sorting and membrane trafficking of 
endosomal cargoes. Although SNX32 shares the highest amino acid sequence 
homology with SNX6, and has been believed to function redundantly with SNX5 and 
SNX6 in retrieval of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor 
(CI-MPR) from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), its role(s) in 
intracellular protein trafficking remains largely unexplored. Here, we report 
that it functions in parallel with SNX1 in mediating epidermal growth factor 
(EGF)-stimulated postendocytic trafficking of the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR). Moreover, SNX32 interacts directly with EGFR, and recruits SNX5 
to promote sorting of EGF-EGFR into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) for lysosomal 
degradation. Thus, SNX32 functions distinctively from other SNX-BAR proteins to 
mediate signaling-coupled endolysosomal trafficking of EGFR.
