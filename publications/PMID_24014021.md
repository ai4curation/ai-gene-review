microRNAs are a large and essential class of gene regulators that play key roles 
in development, homeostasis, and disease. They are necessary for normal skeletal 
development, and their expression is altered in arthritis. However, the specific 
role of individual microRNAs is only beginning to be unraveled. Using microRNA 
expression profiling in healthy human articular cartilage cells (chondrocytes), 
we identified miR-1247 expression as highly correlated with that of the 
differentiated cell phenotype. Transcribed from the DLK1-DIO3 locus, the 
function of miR-1247 is completely unknown. In mice its expression level was 
relatively high in cartilage tissue, and correlated with cartilage-associated 
microRNA miR-675 across a range of 15 different mouse tissues. To further probe 
miR-1247 function, overexpression and inhibition studies were performed in 
isolated human chondrocytes. Modulation of miR-1247 was found to exert profound 
phenotypic effects altering expression levels of cartilage master regulator 
transcription factor SOX9. SOX9 is essential for cartilage development and 
subsequent function throughout life, and mutations in this gene result in severe 
dwarfism. Putative miR-1247 binding sites were further investigated using 
luciferase reporter assays, which indicated binding of miR-1247 to a highly 
conserved region in the coding sequence of SOX9 but not in its 3'-UTR. 
Interestingly, depletion of SOX9 in human chondrocytes resulted in increased 
levels of the mature, processed microRNA, suggesting a negative feedback loop 
between miR-1247 and its target SOX9.
