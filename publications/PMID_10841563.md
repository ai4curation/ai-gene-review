The yeast Sir2 protein, required for transcriptional silencing, has an 
NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase (HDA) activity. Yeast extracts contain a 
NAD(+)-dependent HDA activity that is eliminated in a yeast strain from which 
SIR2 and its four homologs have been deleted. This HDA activity is also 
displayed by purified yeast Sir2p and homologous Archaeal, eubacterial, and 
human proteins, and depends completely on NAD(+) in all species tested. The 
yeast NPT1 gene, encoding an important NAD(+) synthesis enzyme, is required for 
rDNA and telomeric silencing and contributes to silencing of the HM loci. Null 
mutants in this gene have significantly reduced intracellular NAD(+) 
concentrations and have phenotypes similar to sir2 null mutants. Surprisingly, 
yeast from which all five SIR2 homologs have been deleted have relatively normal 
bulk histone acetylation levels. The evolutionary conservation of this regulated 
activity suggests that the Sir2 protein family represents a set of effector 
proteins in an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathway that 
monitors cellular energy and redox states.
