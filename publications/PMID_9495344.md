To generate the full diversity of antibody heavy-chain genes, hundreds of 
dispersed germline V segments must undergo recombination following D-J segment 
joining. Here we report that this process is regulated by the alpha-chain of the 
receptor for interleukin-7, a cytokine that stimulates B-cell lymphopoiesis. D-J 
joining occurs normally in immature B lymphocytes from mice lacking the 
alpha-chain of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7Ralpha). But recombination of V 
segments is progressively impaired as their distance increases upstream of D/J, 
causing infrequent rearrangement of most V segments, which markedly reduces 
diversity. This is not simply due to defective cell proliferation or impaired 
recombinase expression. Rather, germline transcripts from distal, unrearranged V 
segments, a marker of chromatin changes that precede recombination, are 
specifically silenced. So too is expression of Pax-5, which binds to heavy-chain 
locus control elements and normally stimulates recombination, suggesting a 
mechanism for these effects. Thus ligands of the interleukin-7 receptor deliver 
an extrinsic signal that targets V segment recombination in the heavy-chain 
locus by altering the accessibility of DNA substrates to the recombinase. This 
mechanism augments the recombinational diversity of the primary antibody 
repertoire.
