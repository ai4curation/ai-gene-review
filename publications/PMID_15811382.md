SecB, a small tetrameric chaperone in Escherichia coli, facilitates export of 
precursor polypeptides from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic space. During this 
process, SecB displays two modes of binding. As a chaperone, it binds 
promiscuously to precursors to maintain them in a non-native conformation. SecB 
also demonstrates specific recognition of, and binding to, SecA. SecB with the 
precursor tightly bound enters an export-active complex with SecA and must pass 
the ligand to SecA at the translocon in the membrane. Here we use variants of 
SecA and SecB to further probe these interactions. We show that, unexpectedly, 
the binding between the two symmetric molecules is asymmetric and that the 
C-terminal alpha-helices of SecB bind in the interfacial region of the SecA 
dimer. We suggest that disruption of this interface by SecB facilitates 
conformational changes of SecA that are crucial to the transfer of the precursor 
from SecB to SecA.
