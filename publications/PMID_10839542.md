Arabidopsis seedlings display contrasting developmental patterns depending on 
the ambient light. Seedlings grown in the light develop photomorphogenically, 
characterized by short hypocotyls and expanded green cotyledons. In contrast, 
seedlings grown in darkness become etiolated, with elongated hypocotyls and 
dosed cotyledons on an apical hook. Light signals, perceived by multiple 
photoreceptors and transduced to downstream regulators, dictate the extent of 
photomorphogenic development in a quantitative manner. Two key downstream 
components, COP1 and HY5, act antagonistically in regulating seedling 
development. HY5 is a bZIP transcription factor that binds directly to the 
promoters of light-inducible genes, promoting their expression and 
photomorphogenic development. COP1 is a RING-finger protein with WD-40 repeats 
whose nuclear abundance is negatively regulated by light. COP1 interacts 
directly with HY5 in the nucleus to regulate its activity negatively. Here we 
show that the abundance of HY5 is directly correlated with the extent of 
photomorphogenic development, and that the COP1-HY5 interaction may specifically 
target HY5 for proteasome-mediated degradation in the nucleus.
