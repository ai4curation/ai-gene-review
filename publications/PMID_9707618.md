A novel member of the human frizzled (Fz) gene family was cloned and found to be 
specifically expressed in 3 of 13 well differentiated (23%), 13 of 20 moderately 
differentiated (62%), and 12 of 14 poorly differentiated (86%) squamous cell 
esophageal carcinomas compared with the adjacent uninvolved normal mucosa. The 
FzE3 cDNA encodes a protein of 574 amino acids and shares high sequence homology 
with the human FzD2 gene particularly in the putative ligand binding region of 
the cysteine-rich extracellular domain. Functional analysis revealed that 
transfection and expression of the FzE3 cDNA in esophageal carcinoma cells 
stimulates complex formation between adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and 
beta-catenin followed by nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. Furthermore, 
cotransfection of a mutant construct encoding a FzE3 protein with a C-terminal 
truncation completely inhibited the interaction of APC with beta-catenin in 
cells. Finally, coexpression of FzE3 with Lef-1 transcription factor enhanced 
beta-catenin translocation to the nucleus. These observations suggest that FzE3 
gene expression may down-regulate APC function and enhance beta-catenin mediated 
signals in poorly differentiated human esophageal carcinomas.
