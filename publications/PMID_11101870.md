Cell death is achieved by two fundamentally different mechanisms: apoptosis and 
necrosis. Apoptosis is dependent on caspase activation, whereas the 
caspase-independent necrotic signaling pathway remains largely uncharacterized. 
We show here that Fas kills activated primary T cells efficiently in the absence 
of active caspases, which results in necrotic morphological changes and late 
mitochondrial damage but no cytochrome c release. This Fas ligand-induced 
caspase-independent death is absent in T cells that are deficient in either 
Fas-associated death domain (FADD) or receptor-interacting protein (RIP). RIP is 
also required for necrotic death induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and 
TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). In contrast to its role in 
nuclear factor kappa B activation, RIP requires its own kinase activity for 
death signaling. Thus, Fas, TRAIL and TNF receptors can initiate cell death by 
two alternative pathways, one relying on caspase-8 and the other dependent on 
the kinase RIP.
