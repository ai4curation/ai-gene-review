Individuals affected with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) harbor increased numbers of 
GFAP-immunoreactive cerebral astrocytes and develop astrocytomas that can lead 
to blindness and death. Mice heterozygous for a targeted Nf1 mutation (Nf1+/-) 
were employed as a model for the human disease to evaluate the hypothesis that 
reduced NF1 protein (neurofibromin) expression may confer a growth advantage for 
astrocytes, such that inactivation of only one NF1 allele is sufficient for 
abnormal astrocyte proliferation. Here, we report that Nf17+/- mice have 
increased numbers of cerebral astrocytes and increased astrocyte proliferation 
compared to wild-type littermates. Intriguingly, primary Nf1+/- astrocyte 
cultures failed to demonstrate a cell-autonomous growth advantage unless they 
were cocultured with C17 neuronal cells. This C17 neuronal cell-induced Nf1+/- 
increase in proliferation was blocked by MEK inhibition (PD98059), suggesting a 
p21-ras-dependent effect. Furthermore, mice heterozygous for a targeted mutation 
in another GAP molecule, p120-GAP, demonstrated no increases in cerebral 
astrocyte number. These findings suggest that reduced NF1 expression results in 
a cell context-dependent increase in astrocyte proliferation that may be 
sufficient for the development of astrocytic growth abnormalities in patients 
with NF1.
