Exposure of cells to reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes a rapid and 
significant drop in intracellular ATP levels. This energy depletion negatively 
affects ATP-dependent chaperone systems, making ROS-mediated protein unfolding 
and aggregation a potentially very challenging problem. Here we show that Get3, 
a protein involved in ATP-dependent targeting of tail-anchored (TA) proteins 
under nonstress conditions, turns into an effective ATP-independent chaperone 
when oxidized. Activation of Get3's chaperone function, which is a fully 
reversible process, involves disulfide bond formation, metal release, and its 
conversion into distinct, higher oligomeric structures. Mutational studies 
demonstrate that the chaperone activity of Get3 is functionally distinct from 
and likely mutually exclusive with its targeting function, and responsible for 
the oxidative stress-sensitive phenotype that has long been noted for yeast 
cells lacking functional Get3. These results provide convincing evidence that 
Get3 functions as a redox-regulated chaperone, effectively protecting eukaryotic 
cells against oxidative protein damage.
