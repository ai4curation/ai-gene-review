The Fas death receptor can activate the Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway 
through the receptor-associated protein Daxx. Daxx was found to activate the JNK 
kinase kinase ASK1, and overexpression of a kinase-deficient ASK1 mutant 
inhibited Fas- and Daxx-induced apoptosis and JNK activation. Fas activation 
induced Daxx to interact with ASK1, which consequently relieved an inhibitory 
intramolecular interaction between the amino- and carboxyl-termini of ASK1, 
activating its kinase activity. The Daxx-ASK1 connection completes a signaling 
pathway from a cell surface death receptor to kinase cascades that modulate 
nuclear transcription factors.
