ABSTRACT

Brain insulin resistance is a key pathological feature contributing to obesity, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Besides the classic transcriptional mechanism mediated by hormones, posttranscriptional regulation has recently been shown to regulate a number of signaling pathways that could lead to metabolic diseases. Here, we show that microRNA 7 (miR-7), an abundant microRNA in the brain, targets insulin receptor (INSR), insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2), and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), key regulators of insulin homeostatic functions in the central nervous system (CNS) and the pathology of AD. In this study, we found that insulin and liver X receptor (LXR) activators promote the expression of the intronic miR-7-1 in vitro and in vivo , along with its host heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK) gene, encoding an RNA binding protein (RBP) that is involved in insulin action at the posttranscriptional level. Our data show that miR-7 expression is altered in the brains of diet-induced obese mice. Moreover, we found that the levels of miR-7 are also elevated in brains of AD patients; this inversely correlates with the expression of its target genes IRS-2 and IDE. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-7 increased the levels of extracellular Aβ in neuronal cells and impaired the clearance of extracellular Aβ by microglial cells. Taken together, these results represent a novel branch of insulin action through the HNRNPK–miR-7 axis and highlight the possible implication of these posttranscriptional regulators in a range of diseases underlying metabolic dysregulation in the brain, from diabetes to Alzheimer’s disease.

INTRODUCTION

Although the brain was once considered an insulin-insensitive organ, it is now established that insulin actions regulate important functions in the central nervous system (CNS), including synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and neuroprotection. Insulin receptor (INSR), insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR), and their signaling partners, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2, are distributed throughout the brain and regulate processes such as neurogenesis, cell growth, and synaptic maintenance, as well as amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) degradation. Importantly, impairment of insulin signaling in the brain is associated with the development of a number of pathologies, including diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The development of diabetes and AD has been found to share many pathophysiological features, including insulin resistance (IR), impaired glucose metabolism, and cognitive decline. Individuals with diabetes have a 1.5- to 2.0-fold-higher risk of developing AD than individuals without diabetes ( 1 ). Insulin can exert neuroprotective effects by preventing Tau hyperphosphorylation and promoting the extracellular degradation of Aβ through the regulation of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which represents a key molecular link between AD and diabetes ( 2 ). Furthermore, intranasal administration of insulin has been shown to improve cognitive decline in AD patients ( 3 ). As such, understanding the biological mechanisms that link the development of diabetes with AD is essential for the development of future intervention and/or prevention strategies.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (18 to 25 nucleotides [nt]), evolutionarily conserved, noncoding RNAs that have an important function in gene regulation, acting predominantly at the posttranscriptional level. By binding to the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, miRNAs repress translation or induce mRNA degradation ( 4 , 5 ). A growing number of studies from our group and others have demonstrated a critical role for miRNAs in regulating lipid and glucose homeostasis, including miRNA 33 (miR-33), miR-758, miR-144, and let-7, etc., and their impact on metabolic diseases ( 6 – 9 ). Of note, the expression of many of these miRNAs is altered in aberrant metabolic states such as diabetes as well as in AD, important pathologies where dysregulation of lipid and glucose metabolism represents a common feature ( 10 , 11 ). However, the role of miRNAs in regulating insulin sensitivity in the brain in the context of AD remains unexplored. Therefore, miRNAs may represent novel candidates to link AD and insulin resistance in the CNS at the molecular level.

miR-7 is an evolutionarily highly conserved miRNA that is considered a prototypical neuroendocrine miRNA, being highly expressed in neuroendocrine organs such as the pancreas and brain ( 12 ). In humans, the miR-7 family consists of three members (miR-7-1, miR-7-2, and miR-7-3) localized on human chromosomes 9, 15, and 19, respectively. miR-7 has been shown to regulate important aspects of pancreatic biology and functions, including cell differentiation and insulin production ( 12 , 13 ), whereas its role in the brain remains incomplete. Nevertheless, miR-7 expression seems to be highly regulated in the brain by several other posttranscriptional regulators, such as RNA binding proteins (RBPs) ( 14 ) and miRNA sponges ( 15 ), suggesting its important role in the CNS. We have identified miR-7 as a potential candidate involved in the regulation of brain insulin resistance and AD pathology. Using bioinformatic prediction algorithms and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, we found that potential miR-7 targets are enriched in gene clusters involved in insulin signaling and related pathways (INSR, IRS-1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI3K], and IGF1R) and AD (most notably IDE). miR-7-1 is an intronic miRNA located in HNRNPK, an RBP that was recently shown to be involved in insulin actions at the posttranscriptional level ( 16 ). Furthermore, our results show that miR-7 represses the expression of INSR, IRS-2, and IDE, among other important members of the insulin signaling pathway, in mouse and human neuronal cells. Moreover, we have also found that miR-7 is regulated by insulin and liver X receptor (LXR) both in vitro and in vivo , effects that are likely mediated through SREBP1c. Also, we found that miR-7 levels are aberrant in the brains of obese mice and in susceptible brain areas of AD patients, which inversely correlate with the expression of insulin-signaling genes and genes involved in Aβ metabolism. Finally, our data show that miR-7 can regulate Aβ levels in vitro in neuronal cells. Overall, these data suggest that miR-7 may regulate insulin signaling and Aβ levels in the brain during the progression of AD.

DISCUSSION

Extensive preclinical and clinical evidence supports a pathophysiological connection between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and diabetes ( 1 , 19 , 20 ). Due to the strong correlation between brain insulin resistance (IR) and the pathogenesis of AD, AD has been proposed as “type 3” diabetes ( 21 , 22 ). Yet the molecular mechanism underlying this relation is still elusive. MicroRNAs have been shown to play a major role in the regulation of metabolism, primarily in peripheral tissues ( 23 ). The brain expresses more distinct and the largest number of miRNAs than any other tissue in vertebrates ( 24 ), and they are involved in a plethora of physiological functions, in neuronal differentiation, and in pathological states, such as the development of brain tumors and neurodegeneration. Here, we describe a novel role of miR-7, a microRNA enriched in the brain, in regulating important insulin and LXR signaling components, two main neuroprotective pathways that can influence IR as well as Aβ metabolism, thus representing a novel common regulator linking brain insulin resistance and AD at the posttranscriptional level. Among the possible mechanisms underlying the connection between both diseases, IR and amyloidosis are prominent and closely related ( 25 ). Our data show that miR-7 regulates the expression of not only INSR and IRS-2, inhibiting the downstream insulin signaling cascade in neuronal cells, but also IDE, LXRβ, and ABCA1, involved in Aβ metabolism. The LXR signaling pathway plays an important role in Aβ plaque biogenesis. Loss of LXRs increases Aβ plaque burden in the APP/PS1 mouse ( 26 – 29 ). ABCA1, one of the most studied transcriptional targets of LXR, affects the lipidation status of ApoE in the brain, which in turn may facilitate the proteolytic degradation of Aβ ( 30 ). Indeed, we and others have shown that microRNAs that affect ABCA1, such as miR-33 and miR-106, play a key role in AD pathology ( 11 , 31 ). Therefore, it is possible that increased Aβ levels in neuronal cells and impairment of uptake by microglial cells after miR-7 overexpression could be mediated through the posttranscriptional regulation of this pathway. Nevertheless, several remarkable characteristics distinguish miR-7 as a unique miRNA in the context of the possible underlying molecular coregulation of brain IR and AD. miR-7 is a highly abundant microRNA in the brain, and intriguingly, it targets key genes involved in IR and AD. In this regard, it is generally accepted that miRNAs with biological significance usually target entire pathways rather than a single mRNA involved in a biological function. Another important miR-7 target is IDE, a strong candidate for involvement in late-onset AD ( 32 ) which represents a common molecular link between IR and AD. Indeed, IDE expression, which has been shown to influence Aβ levels in vitro and in vivo ( 33 ), is also impaired in brains from AD patients and in Tg2576 transgenic mice and correlates with the accumulation of Aβ during the progression of the disease. In this line, it is possible that our findings of elevated miR-7 levels in the brains of AD patients compared with those in healthy subjects could account for this effect as well as for the reduced levels of its target IRS-2 mRNA during the progression of AD ( 22 ). Moreover, we also found that levels of miR-7 are altered in brains of obese mice fed a high-cholesterol diet and of DIO mice; this correlates with increased brain insulin signaling previously described in this animal model as well as in ob/ob mice and in monkeys with long-standing diet-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) ( 34 ). Several studies suggest that the brain is initially hyperinsulinized in insulin-resistant states of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and T2DM and that with the development and progression of AD pathology, the brain may secondarily become insulin resistant. In this context, we found that miR-7 is induced by insulin and LXR, both in vitro and in vivo , and this effect is abolished when systemic insulin levels are compromised in an STZ-induced model of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).

Our data indicate that miR-7-1a, encoded in intron 17 of the mouse HNRNPK gene, is cotranscribed with the host gene, which is a common mechanism for intronic miRNAs ( 9 , 35 , 36 ). Although we cannot exclude additional regulation, the HNRNPK promoter contains several conserved E-box sequence motifs and consensus sequences for the well-known SREBP1 coregulator NFY and the insulin transducer transcription factor SP1. These results, together with the data showing an increase in miR-7 with the host gene upon overexpression of an active SREBP1c form in neuronal cells, suggest a possible SREBP1c-mediated transcriptional mechanism of HNRNPK/miR-7 through insulin/LXR pathways. Further analyses are necessary to explore the potential direct transcriptional activation of HNRNPK/miR-7 by LXR. In this regard, activation of LXR drives cholesterol efflux through ABCA1/ABCG1 transcriptional regulation. This effect could lead to cellular cholesterol depletion and indirect activation of SREBP2. Indeed, data compiled using the UCSC Genome Browser shows ChIP-assayed binding for this transcription factor, which suggests a possibly more complex scenario for the regulation of HNRNPK/miR-7. After LXR agonist or insulin stimulation, the levels of miR-7-1 are increased, and it inhibits a number of insulin and LXR pathway components, including INSR, IRS-2, AKT, LXRβ, RXRβ, and possibly other potential downstream targets, such as the SREBP1 coregulators NFY and SP1 ( Fig. 11 ). This negative autoregulatory feedback loop was later corroborated when LXR-dependent stimulation of HNRNPK, which lacks miR-7’s binding sites in its 3′ UTR, was inhibited by miR-7 overexpression in N2a cells. Multiple examples in the literature have shown that intronic miRNAs involved in autoregulatory mechanisms fine-tune metabolic pathways by directly or indirectly regulating their host gene. Negative-feedback regulation by direct targeting of host genes has been described for miR-126 ( 37 ) and miR-128b ( 38 ), among others. On the other hand, studies indicate that miR-33a and -b, encoded by Srebp2 and Srebp1 , respectively, are cotranscribed with their host genes and regulate cellular cholesterol levels and insulin signaling, which in turn dictate Srebp2 and Srebp1 expression and activity, thus controlling their own expression ( 23 ). In the context of our study, it is conceivable that overproduction of miR-7 during states of metabolic dysregulation, as in hyperinsulinized brains during obesity, metabolic syndrome, and T2DM ( 34 ), could ameliorate the neuroprotective actions of insulin and LXR in the brain, promoting later IR and amyloidosis, thus representing a molecular link between insulin resistance and AD at the posttranscriptional level. Therefore, our work depicts miR-7 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of insulin resistance and associated neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.
