Antibody and cell-based therapeutics targeting cell surface receptors have 
emerged as a major class of immune therapeutics for treating cancer. However, 
the number of cell surface targets for cancer immunotherapy remains limited. 
Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a cell surface proteoglycan and an oncofetal antigen. In 
this study, we report a large-scale tumor-associated GPC3 co-immunoprecipitation 
(CoIP)-proteomic study using liver cancer xenograft tumors in mice. We 
identified 153 GPC3-associated proteins through mass spectrometry. To identify 
potential drug targets, we categorized GPC3-associated proteins based on their 
subcellular locations using UniProt annotations, with a focus on extracellular 
proteins. Additionally, we annotated differentially expressed proteins in 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) versus non-tumor liver samples based on the 
literature, analyzed expression levels in tumor versus normal tissues using TCGA 
and GTEx databases via GEPIA, and identified prognostic liver cancer markers 
according to GEPIA. Among GPC3-associated proteins, Immunoglobulin Superfamily 
Member 1 (IGSF1), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), FAT Atypical Cadherin 1 (FAT1), 
Formin 1 (FMN1), and Guanylate Cyclase 2C (GUCY2C), were identified as potential 
therapeutic targets. Furthermore, we validated the direct protein interaction 
between GPC3 and AFP through immunoprecipitation with purified proteins and 
through co-localization imaging using immunofluorescence microscopy. This study 
provides large proteomic datasets related to GPC3-associated proteins, enhancing 
our understanding of glypican biology in cancer cells and offering a new 
approach to identifying immunotherapy targets.
