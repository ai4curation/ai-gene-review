Glyphosate is the active ingredient of several widely used herbicide 
formulations. Glyphosate targets the shikimate metabolic pathway, which is found 
in plants but not in animals. Despite the relative safety of glyphosate, various 
adverse developmental and reproductive problems have been alleged as a result of 
exposure in humans and animals. To assess the developmental and reproductive 
safety of glyphosate, an analysis of the available literature was conducted. 
Epidemiological and animal reports, as well as studies on mechanisms of action 
related to possible developmental and reproductive effects of glyphosate, were 
reviewed. An evaluation of this database found no consistent effects of 
glyphosate exposure on reproductive health or the developing offspring. 
Furthermore, no plausible mechanisms of action for such effects were elucidated. 
Although toxicity was observed in studies that used glyphosate-based 
formulations, the data strongly suggest that such effects were due to 
surfactants present in the formulations and not the direct result of glyphosate 
exposure. To estimate potential human exposure concentrations to glyphosate as a 
result of working directly with the herbicide, available biomonitoring data were 
examined. These data demonstrated extremely low human exposures as a result of 
normal application practices. Furthermore, the estimated exposure concentrations 
in humans are >500-fold less than the oral reference dose for glyphosate of 2 
mg/kg/d set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA 1993). In 
conclusion, the available literature shows no solid evidence linking glyphosate 
exposure to adverse developmental or reproductive effects at environmentally 
realistic exposure concentrations.
