BACKGROUND: Financial incentives, donor authorization, and presumed consent are 
strategies designed to increase organ donation rates. Surveys designed to assess 
attitudes toward these initiatives have been conducted with the general public, 
transplant patients, and transplant professionals.
METHODS: To assess attitudes toward financial incentives, donor authorization, 
and presumed consent and to identify multivariate predictors of such attitudes, 
we conducted telephone interviews with 561 family members who had recently been 
asked for consent to donate the organs of a deceased family member (348 donors, 
213 nondonors).
RESULTS: Financial incentives would have made a difference in the donation 
decision for 54% of nondonors (vs. 46% of donors, P=0.02), and a higher 
percentage of nondonors would themselves become donors if financial incentives 
were available (P=0.03). Donors had significantly more favorable attitudes 
toward donor authorization (P<0.0001) and presumed consent (P<0.0001) policies. 
Overall, 54% of participants thought that family permission for donation was 
unnecessary when the deceased documented their donation intention, and 24% 
favored a presumed consent law with an opting out provision.
CONCLUSIONS: Of the three initiatives, donor authorization is likely supported 
by more donor and nondonor families than either financial incentives or presumed 
consent. Public education efforts should aim to better inform the public 
regarding existing and proposed donor authorization legislation and its benefits 
for registered organ donors and their families.
