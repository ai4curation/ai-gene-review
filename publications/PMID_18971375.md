The yeast cell wall is an extracellular structure that is dependent on secretory 
and membrane proteins for its construction. We investigated the role of protein 
quality control mechanisms in cell wall integrity and found that the unfolded 
protein response (UPR) and, to a lesser extent, endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways are required for proper cell wall 
construction. Null mutation of IRE1, double mutation of ERAD components 
(hrd1Delta and ubc7Delta) and ire1Delta, or expression of misfolded proteins 
show phenotypes similar to mutation of cell wall proteins, including 
hypersensitivity to cell wall-targeted molecules, alterations to cell wall 
protein layer, decreased cell wall thickness by electron microscopy, and 
increased cellular aggregation. Consistent with its important role in cell wall 
integrity, UPR is activated by signaling through the cell wall integrity 
mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway during cell wall stress and 
unstressed vegetative growth. Both cell wall stress and basal UPR activity is 
mediated by Swi6p, a regulator of cell cycle and cell wall stress gene 
transcription, in a manner that is independent of its known coregulatory 
molecules. We propose that the cellular responses to ER and cell wall stress are 
coordinated to buffer the cell against these two related cellular stresses.
