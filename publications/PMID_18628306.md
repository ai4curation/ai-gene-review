LETM1 is located in the chromosomal region that is deleted in patients suffering 
Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome; it encodes a homolog of the yeast protein Mdm38 that 
is involved in mitochondrial morphology. Here, we describe the LETM1-mediated 
regulation of the mitochondrial volume and its interaction with the 
mitochondrial AAA-ATPase BCS1L that is responsible for three different human 
disorders. LETM1 is a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein with a large domain 
extruding to the matrix. The LETM1 homolog LETM2 is a mitochondrial protein that 
is expressed preferentially in testis and sperm. LETM1 downregulation caused 
mitochondrial swelling and cristae disorganization, but seemed to have little 
effect on membrane fusion and fission. Formation of the respiratory-chain 
complex was impaired by LETM1 knockdown. Cells lacking mitochondrial DNA lost 
active respiratory chains but maintained mitochondrial tubular networks, 
indicating that mitochondrial swelling caused by LETM1 knockdown is not caused 
by the disassembly of the respiratory chains. LETM1 was co-precipitated with 
BCS1L and formation of the LETM1 complex depended on BCS1L levels, suggesting 
that BCS1L stimulates the assembly of the LETM1 complex. BCS1L knockdown caused 
disassembly of the respiratory chains as well as LETM1 downregulation and 
induced distinct changes in mitochondrial morphology.
