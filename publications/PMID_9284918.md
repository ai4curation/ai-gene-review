Studies of transcriptional activation by interferons and a variety of cytokines 
have led to the identification of a family of proteins that serve as signal 
transducers and activators of transcription (STAT). STAT4 is phosphorylated 
following interleukin (IL)-12 stimulation and is essential for IL-12 signal 
transduction. The human STAT4 cDNA was cloned, and both STAT4 and STAT1 genes 
were mapped to human chromosome bands 2q32.2-->q32.3 by fluorescence in situ 
hybridization. These results suggest that STAT4 and STAT1 may have arisen via a 
tandem gene duplication. However, human STAT1 is expressed ubiquitously, whereas 
human STAT4 is expressed in several tissues including spleen, heart, brain, 
peripheral blood cells, and testis.
