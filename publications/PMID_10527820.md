There is accumulating evidence that deficient trophoblast invasion of the 
placental bed spiral arteries is crucial to the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia 
and intrauterine growth restriction. However, the factors which regulate the 
process of trophoblast invasion remain unclear. We have investigated whether 
extravillous trophoblast invasion and motility are mediated by the angiogenic 
growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth 
factor (PlGF). The SGHPL-4 extravillous trophoblast cell line was utilized. 
Expression of mRNA for the receptors of VEGF and PlGF (KDR and flt-1) was 
determined using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. An in 
vitro model of invasion assessed the number and length of trophoblast processes 
invading into an extracellular matrix. The motility of cells under standard 
culture conditions was also quantified. The effect of the addition of VEGF and 
PlGF (+/-heparin) on trophoblast invasion and motility was determined. The 
effect of VEGF and PlGF (+/-heparin) on SGHPL-4 cell proliferation was assessed 
by cell counts at 24, 48 and 72 h post-addition of growth factor. The SGHPL-4 
cells expressed mRNA for the flt-1 but not the KDR receptor. The addition of 
VEGF resulted in a significant decrease in the number of trophoblast processes 
formed (P< 0.02); this effect was not influenced by the addition of heparin. 
However, there was no effect on the length of processes formed in response to 
VEGF (+/-heparin). The addition of PlGF had no effect on either the number or 
the length of processes formed. The addition of VEGF increased the motility of 
the SGHPL-4 cells (P< 0.002); the addition of heparin prevented this 
VEGF-induced increase in motility. The addition of PlGF had no effect on SGHPL-4 
motility (+/-heparin). Neither growth factor had any effect on the proliferative 
ability of SGHPL-4 cells. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find that the 
angiogenic growth factors, VEGF and PlGF, mediated the in vitro invasion of 
trophoblast cells into an extracellular matrix. However, VEGF did increase 
trophoblast motility. Our findings of an effect of VEGF on trophoblast motility 
(and possibly invasion) suggests the presence of functional receptors, which can 
mediate the actions of VEGF. Caution must be exercised before any extrapolation 
to the in vivo situation, however, it could be speculated that the increased 
motility in response to VEGF may be an initial response to attract trophoblast 
cells to the decidua, and that VEGF might then limit the degree to which 
trophoblast cells invade.
