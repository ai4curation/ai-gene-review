We aimed to examine the physical interaction between CtBPs and KLF4 and the 
potential importance of this interaction. Co-immunoprecipitation indicated that 
CtBP1 indeed interacted with KLF4. This was supported by the co-localization of 
both KLF4 and CtBP1 in the promoter regions of KLF4 downstream target genes. In 
addition, overexpression of CtBP1 significantly decreased KLF4-mediated 
transcriptional activation in both an artificial (pGL5) and genuine (IAP and 
Keratin-4) reporter system. Mutations in the potential CtBP binding motif in 
KLF4 were accompanied by loss of the inhibitory effect of CtBP1 in the reporter 
assay and of the physical interaction with CtBP1. Overall, our results suggest 
that CtBPs attenuate KLF4-mediated transcriptional activation through the 
physical interaction with KLF4.
