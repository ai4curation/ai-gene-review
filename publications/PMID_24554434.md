Centrosome cohesion, mostly regarded as a proteinaceous linker between parental 
centrioles, ensures that the interphase centrosome(s) function as a single 
microtubule-organizing center. Impairment of centrosome cohesion leads to the 
splitting of centrosomes. Although the list of cohesion proteins is growing, the 
precise composition and regulation of centrosome cohesion are still largely 
unknown. In this study, we show that the centriolar protein centlein (also known 
as CNTLN) localizes to the proximal ends of the centrioles and directly 
interacts with both C-Nap1 (also known as Cep250) and Cep68. Moreover, centlein 
complexes with C-Nap1 and Cep68 at the proximal ends of centrioles during 
interphase and functions as a molecular link between C-Nap1 and Cep68. Depletion 
of centlein impairs recruitment of Cep68 to the centrosomes and, in turn, 
results in centrosome splitting. Both centlein and Cep68 are novel Nek2A 
substrates. Collectively, our data demonstrate that centrosome cohesion is 
maintained by the newly identified complex of C-Nap1-centlein-Cep68.
