A 73-kilodalton (kD) intracellular protein was found to bind to peptide regions 
that target intracellular proteins for lysosomal degradation in response to 
serum withdrawal. This protein cross-reacted with a monoclonal antibody raised 
to a member of the 70-kD heat shock protein (hsp70) family, and sequences of two 
internal peptides of the 73-kD protein confirm that it is a member of this 
family. In response to serum withdrawal, the intracellular concentration of the 
73-kD protein increased severalfold. In the presence of adenosine 
5'-triphosphate (ATP) and MgCl2, the 73-kD protein enhanced protein degradation 
in two different cell-free assays for lysosomal proteolysis.
