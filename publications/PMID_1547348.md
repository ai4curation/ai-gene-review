Human red blood cells (RBCs) that are deficient in an integral 
membrane-associated protein ("stomatin") of apparent molecular mass 31 Kd show a 
catastrophic increase in passive membrane permeability to the univalent cations 
Na+ and K+ and are stomatocytic in shape. We have purified this protein from 
normal RBC membranes and isolated a cDNA clone coding for it. The deduced 
protein sequence is unrelated to that of any known ion-transport-related 
protein. Selective solubilization studies using detergents show that while the 
protein is strongly associated with the phospholipid bilayer, it also binds to 
the cytoskeleton. The predicted polypeptide has a single trans-membranous 
hydrophobic segment near the N-terminus, which would locate it in the membrane; 
the large C-terminal domain is hydrophilic and cytoplasmic in orientation and is 
presumed to be responsible for the attachment to the cytoskeleton. By inference, 
the protein has the function of closing a latent ion channel. The messenger RNA 
encoding this protein is ubiquitously distributed in different human cell types 
and tissues and is thus presumably a widely distributed regulator of 
transmembrane cation fluxes. As a membrane-bound inhibitor protein of Na+ and K+ 
transport, it is unique among the known components of membrane-transport 
proteins.
