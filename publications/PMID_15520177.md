The ErbB-2/HER-2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in a wide range of 
solid human tumors. The ErbB-2 gene product is a transmembrane glycoprotein 
belonging to the epidermal growth factor receptor family, and its cytoplasmic 
domain is responsible for sending the mitogenic signals into cells. We 
discovered that this domain of ErbB-2 interacts with Tid1 protein, the human 
counterpart of the Drosophila tumor suppressor Tid56, whose null mutation causes 
lethal tumorigenesis during the larval stage. Tid1 also is known as a 
cochaperone of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and binds to HSP70 through its 
conserved DnaJ domain. We found that increased expression of Tid1 in human 
mammary carcinomas overexpressing ErbB-2 suppresses the expression level of 
ErbB-2 and attenuates the resultant ErbB-2-dependent oncogenic extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and big mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 signaling 
pathways leading to programmed cell death (PCD). A functional DnaJ domain of 
Tid1 also is required for its inhibition of ErbB-2 expression and the consequent 
PCD of carcinoma cells resulting from increased Tid1 expression. Importantly, 
ErbB-2-dependent tumor progression in animals is inhibited by increased 
expression of Tid1 in tumor cells. Collectively, these results suggest that Tid1 
modulates the uncontrolled proliferation of ErbB-2-overexpressing carcinoma 
cells by reducing ErbB-2 expression and as a result suppresses the 
ErbB-2-dependent cancerous signaling and tumor progression. Moreover, the 
cochaperonic and regulatory functions of Tid1 on HSP70 most likely play an 
essential role in this antitumor function of Tid1 in carcinoma cells.
