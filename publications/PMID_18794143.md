Previously, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) had been reported to induce genomic 
instability and aneuploidy by interaction with Cdc20. Here, we have further 
examined the functions of HSF1 in the regulation of mitosis. A null mutant or 
knockdown of HSF1 caused defective mitotic progression. By monitoring 
chromosomes in living cells, we determined that HSF1 was localized to the 
centrosome in mitosis and especially to the spindle poles in metaphase. HSF1 was 
phosphorylated by Plk1 at Ser(216) of the DSGXXS motif during the timing of 
mitosis and a phospho-defective mutant form of HSF1 inhibited mitotic 
progression. Phosphorylated HSF1 during spindle pole localization underwent 
ubiquitin degradation through the SCF(beta-TrCP) pathway. However, binding of 
HSF1 with Cdc20 stabilized the phosphorylation of HSF1. Moreover, 
SCF(beta-TrCP)-mediated degradation only occurred when phosphorylated HSF1 was 
released from Cdc20. HSF1 phosphorylation at Ser(216) occurred in the early 
mitotic period with simultaneous binding of Cdc20. The interaction of HSF1 with 
SCF(beta-TrCP) was followed and then the interaction of APC/Cdc20 was 
subsequently observed. From these findings, it was shown that Plk1 
phosphorylates HSF1 in early mitosis and that the binding of phosphorylated HSF1 
with Cdc20 and ubiquitin degradation by SCF(beta-TrCP) regulates mitotic 
progression.
