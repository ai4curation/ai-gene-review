Sepiapterin reductase (SPR) catalyzes the final step of the biosynthetic pathway 
of tetrahydrobiopterin, which is an essential cofactor for aromatic amino acid 
hydroxylases and nitric oxide synthases. To aid the analysis of any possible 
human diseases caused by mutations in SPR, we have cloned and characterized the 
human SPR gene. The gene is composed of three exons spanning approximately 4 
kilobases. The transcriptional starting point was determined around the cytosine 
nucleotide at position -81 by primer extension and RT-PCR analyses. There was no 
typical TATA-box within 300 bp from the transcriptional starting point. We found 
the Sp1-binding consensus sequence in the 5'-flanking region. The human SPR gene 
was mapped to chromosome band 2p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
