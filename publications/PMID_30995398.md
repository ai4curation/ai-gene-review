Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are the targets of the β-lactams, the most 
successful class of antibiotics ever developed against bacterial infections. 
Unfortunately, the worldwide and rapid spread of large spectrum β-lactam 
resistance genes such as carbapenemases is detrimental to the use of antibiotics 
in this class. New potent PBP inhibitors are needed, especially compounds that 
resist β-lactamase hydrolysis. Here we describe the structure of the E. coli 
PBP2 in its Apo form and upon its reaction with 2 diazabicyclo derivatives, 
avibactam and CPD4, a new potent PBP2 inhibitor. Examination of these structures 
shows that unlike avibactam, CPD4 can perform a hydrophobic stacking on Trp370 
in the active site of E. coli PBP2. This result, together with sequence 
analysis, homology modeling, and SAR, allows us to propose CPD4 as potential 
starting scaffold to develop molecules active against a broad range of bacterial 
species at the top of the WHO priority list.
