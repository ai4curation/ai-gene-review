The G2019S leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutation is the most common 
cause of genetic Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the molecular mechanism 
underlying LRRK2 G2019S-induced cellular pathology is poorly understood. Here, 
we demonstrated that LRRK2 G2019S bound to and phosphorylated Bcl-2, a 
mitochondrial anti-apoptotic protein, at Threonine 56. Either stable expression 
of Bcl-2 or transient expression of a Bcl-2 phosphor mutant (Bcl-2(T56A)) 
abolished LRRK2 G2019S-induced mitochondrial depolarization and autophagy. 
Together, our findings reveal a previously unidentified target of LRRK2 G2019S, 
showing that Bcl-2 serves as a point of crosstalk between LRRK2 G2019S-mediated 
mitochondrial disorder and dysregulation of autophagy.
