Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are required for the functions of mitochondrial 
aconitase, mammalian iron regulatory protein 1, and many other proteins in 
multiple subcellular compartments. Recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
indicated that Fe-S cluster biogenesis also has an important role in 
mitochondrial iron homeostasis. Here we report the functional analysis of the 
mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of the human Fe-S cluster scaffold protein, 
ISCU. Suppression of human ISCU by RNAi not only inactivated mitochondrial and 
cytosolic aconitases in a compartment-specific manner but also inappropriately 
activated the iron regulatory proteins and disrupted intracellular iron 
homeostasis. Furthermore, endogenous ISCU levels were suppressed by iron 
deprivation. These results provide evidence for a coordinated response to iron 
deficiency that includes activation of iron uptake, redistribution of 
intracellular iron, and decreased utilization of iron in Fe-S proteins.
