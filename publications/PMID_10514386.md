Uroplakins are the characteristic integral membrane proteins in terminally 
differentiated, superficial urothelial asymmetric unit membrane. Brenner tumors 
of the ovary and Walthard cell nests of Fallopian tubes have been considered to 
represent urothelial differentiation in the female genital tract, but no 
definitive differentiation marker has been demonstrated supporting such a 
conclusion. An immunohistochemical analysis was performed to assess the 
expression of uroplakins in these lesions as well as in various benign and 
neoplastic lesions and normal tissues of the female genital tract. Focal 
expression of uroplakins was observed on the luminal surface of ovarian Brenner 
tumor cells forming microcysts in all 5 cases examined. In contrast, uroplakins 
were slightly expressed in only 1 of 12 cases of Walthard cell nests, even in 
the presence of microcyst formation. Uroplakins were not expressed in other 
benign or malignant lesions or normal tissues of the female genital tract. These 
results support the hypothesis that the Brenner tumor and possibly Walthard cell 
nests represent urothelial (transitional cell) differentiation.
