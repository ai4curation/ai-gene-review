Ligand-induced down-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
comprises activation of two sequential transport steps. The first involves 
endocytic uptake by clathrin-coated vesicles, the second transfer of endocytosed 
EGFR from endosomes to lysosomes. Here we demonstrate that the second transport 
step requires a domain of the EGFR that encompasses residues 985-996 and was 
previously found to interact with actin. Deletion of domain 989-994 
(Delta989-994 EGFR) did not interfere with EGFR uptake but completely abrogated 
its degradation. In contrast, both uptake and degradation were affected for 
K721A EGFR, a kinase-deficient EGFR mutant. To measure intracellular EGFR 
sorting, we developed a novel cell fractionation assay toward which cells were 
co-transfected for chicken hepatic lectin, a receptor for agialoglycoproteins. 
These cells were incubated with agialofetuin-coupled colloidal gold, which was 
targeted to lysosomes after receptor-mediated endocytosis. Compartments within 
the lysosomal pathway gained buoyant density because of the presence of 
colloidal gold and could be isolated from cell homogenates by 
ultracentrifugation through a high-density sucrose cushion. In contrast to 
endocytosed wild type EGFR, both Delta989-994 EGFR and K721A EGFR were largely 
not retrieved in gold-containing endocytic compartments. These results are 
supported with morphological data. We conclude that sorting of endocytosed EGFR 
into the degradation pathway requires both its kinase activity and actin-binding 
domain.
