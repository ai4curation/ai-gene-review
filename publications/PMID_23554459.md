AIMS: Aberrant vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration 
contribute significantly to the development of vascular pathologies, such as 
atherosclerosis and restenosis. MicroRNAs have recently emerged as critical 
modulators in cellular processes and the purpose of this study is to identify 
novel miRNA regulators implicated in human aortic VSMC proliferation and 
migration.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed in 
human VSMCs, we performed miRNA microarray analysis in human aortic smooth 
muscle cells (SMCs) at different time points after platelet-derived growth 
factor (PDGF) stimulation. Here, we identified microRNA-638 (miR-638) as a 
transcript that was one of the most significantly down-regulated in human VSMCs 
after PDGF stimulation. Furthermore, we confirmed, by Quantitative RT-PCR, that 
miR-638 is highly expressed in human VSMCs, and its expression is markedly 
down-regulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner upon PDGF treatment. 
Consistent with a critical role in SMC proliferation, we found that miR-638 
expression was significantly up-regulated in human VSMCs cultured in 
differentiation medium, a condition that inhibits SMC proliferation. 
Furthermore, we identified the orphan nuclear receptor NOR1 as a downstream 
target gene product of miR-638 and down-regulation of NOR1 is critical for 
miR-638-mediated inhibitory effects on PDGF-induced cyclin D1 expression, cell 
proliferation, and migration in human aortic SMCs.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that miR-638 is a key molecule in regulating 
human VSMC proliferation and migration by targeting the NOR1/cyclin D pathway 
and suggest that specific modulation of miR-638 in human VSMCs may represent an 
attractive approach for the treatment of proliferative vascular diseases.
