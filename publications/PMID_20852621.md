During fasting, mammals maintain normal glucose homeostasis by stimulating 
hepatic gluconeogenesis. Elevations in circulating glucagon and epinephrine, two 
hormones that activate hepatic gluconeogenesis, trigger the cAMP-mediated 
phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (Creb) and 
dephosphorylation of the Creb-regulated transcription coactivator-2 (Crtc2)--two 
key transcriptional regulators of this process. Although the underlying 
mechanism is unclear, hepatic gluconeogenesis is also regulated by the circadian 
clock, which coordinates glucose metabolism with changes in the external 
environment. Circadian control of gene expression is achieved by two 
transcriptional activators, Clock and Bmal1, which stimulate cryptochrome (Cry1 
and Cry2) and Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3) repressors that feed back on 
Clock-Bmal1 activity. Here we show that Creb activity during fasting is 
modulated by Cry1 and Cry2, which are rhythmically expressed in the liver. Cry1 
expression was elevated during the night-day transition, when it reduced fasting 
gluconeogenic gene expression by blocking glucagon-mediated increases in 
intracellular cAMP concentrations and in the protein kinase A-mediated 
phosphorylation of Creb. In biochemical reconstitution studies, we found that 
Cry1 inhibited accumulation of cAMP in response to G protein-coupled receptor 
(GPCR) activation but not to forskolin, a direct activator of adenyl cyclase. 
Cry proteins seemed to modulate GPCR activity directly through interaction with 
G(s)α. As hepatic overexpression of Cry1 lowered blood glucose concentrations 
and improved insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant db/db mice, our results 
suggest that compounds that enhance cryptochrome activity may provide 
therapeutic benefit to individuals with type 2 diabetes.

## Full Text

We used an adenovirally encoded CRE:Luciferase reporter to evaluate the rhythmicity of hepatic Creb activity under fasting conditions7. Intraperitoneal GLU administration (GLU-IP) increased Ad-CRE:Luc activity 40-fold better in mice fasted at Zeitgeber time 10–13 (ZT10–13, the day-to-night transition) than at ZT22–1, corresponding to the night-to-day transition (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). Consistent with a rhythmic oscillation in Creb activity, GLU re-injection to the same mice fasted at ZT6–9, near the day-to-night transition, caused a robust increase in hepatic CRE:Luciferase reporter activity. These results suggest that the amplitude of hepatic Creb activation by fasting is gated rhythmically.

Based on the changes in fasting CRE:Luc reporter activity, we hypothesized that the circadian clock modulates Creb and Crtc2 effects on the gluconeogenic program. Supporting this idea, GLU administration increased gluconeogenic gene expression (G6Pase, Pck1) to a greater extent in mice fasted at ZT10–13 (Fig. 1b). Consistently, GLU-IP administration increased hepatic Creb phosphorylation and Crtc2 de-phosphorylation robustly in ZT10–13 fasted mice, but less in ZT22–1 fasted mice (Fig. 1c). Together, these results indicate that the clock modulates fasting gluconeogenesis in part by regulating Creb-Crtc2 activities. These observations are consistent with recent reports showing that the phosphorylation of Creb is rhythmic in vivo8.

Owing to the rhythmic Creb phosphorylation, we considered that the liver clock may exert global effects on the expression of cAMP inducible genes. In line with this idea, we identified 194 Creb targets among a set of 652 clock-controlled genes (CCGs) in published microarray databases of mouse liver9–11. We plotted the sum of the Creb targeted CCGs, along with their ratio compared to the total CCGs at each time-point, versus circadian time (CT) based on their peak expression. Both the number and ratio curves show a clear rhythmic pattern with depletion of Creb targets at CT22 (Supplementary Fig. 2), suggesting that Creb targets are generally rhythmic in the liver with the trough phase coinciding with that of Per2.

We evaluated the extent to which rhythmic gating of Creb activity is cell autonomous. Exposure to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) increased CRE:Luc activity in mouse adult fibroblasts harboring the receptor Vipr212 (Fig. 2). After synchronizing the cells by serum shock, exposure to VIP at specific times resulted in CRE:Luc reporter activation that showed a rhythmic pattern, with peak (24, 48 h) and trough (36–39 h) activities coinciding with those for a Per2:Luciferase reporter (Fig. 2a). These results show the regulation of Creb pathway induction by cell autonomous circadian clock, and are reminiscent of the circadian gating seen in the light signaling induction of a PER2::LUC reporter in melanopsin-containing fibroblasts13.

Because CRE:Luc activity in liver and in synchronized fibroblasts is lowest when Per-Cry activity is highest (ZT22), we tested the potential role of Cry in regulating Creb signaling. Over-expression of Cry1 or Cry2 in Vipr2/CRE:Luc fibroblasts or HEK293T cells attenuated CRE:Luc activity in cells exposed to VIP (Fig. 2b–d), while Per1 did not show significant effect (Fig. 2c). The repression was dosage-dependent (Fig. 2d). Consistent with the absence of E-boxes within the CRE:Luc reporter, Clock-Bmal1 did not activate CRE:Luc expression (Supplementary Fig. 3)10. Furthermore, Cry1/2 overexpression reduced effects of urocortin-3 on CRE:Luc activity in cells expressing Corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2β 14 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, these data indicate that Cry may exert more general effects on GPCR-mediated increases in Creb-Crtc2 dependent transcription.

Based on its inhibitory effects on GPCR signaling in fibroblasts, Cry may correspondingly modulate GLU effects on liver gene expression. Supporting this idea, hepatic expression of adenovirally encoded Cry1 (Ad-Cry1) reduced GLU-induced CRE:Luc activity in liver of fasted mice at ZT10–13, when endogenous Cry1 expression is low (Fig. 3a). Moreover, Ad-Cry1 also down-regulated gluconeogenic gene expression (G6Pase, Pck1) in fasted, GLU-IP administered mice (Fig. 3b). Consequently, Ad-Cry1 expressing mice exhibited lower circulating blood glucose concentrations compared to Ad-GFP controls (Fig. 3c).

We tested whether depletion of Cry, either by targeted disruption of Cry1 and Cry2 genes15, or by RNAi-mediated knockdown in the liver, was sufficient to increase Creb activity. By contrast with the circadian oscillation of hepatic CRE:Luc induction in wild-type mice, GLU-stimulated CRE:Luc activity was constitutively elevated in Cry1−/−Cry2−/− animals (Supplementary Fig. 5). Similarly, RNAi-mediated depletion of hepatic Cry1/2 increased GLU-stimulated CRE:Luc activity at ZT1 relative to control animals expressing unspecific RNAi (USi, Fig. 3d). As a result, hepatic mRNA amounts for gluconeogenic genes (G6Pase, Pck1) were increased in Cry1/2-knockdown mice compared to controls (Fig. 3e). Circulating glucose concentrations were elevated following Cry depletion (Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting that circadian changes in hepatic Cry expression are sufficient to modulate the gluconeogenic program in part through their inhibitory effects on the Creb-Crtc2 pathway. Indeed, knockdown of Cry1/2 also increased glucose production in primary hepatocytes following exposure to GLU, indicating that Cry effects on hepatic glucose metabolism are likely cell autonomous (Fig. 3f).

We wondered whether Cry would similarly modulate circulating glucose concentrations in the setting of insulin resistance. Supporting this idea, adenoviral expression of Cry1 reduced fasting blood glucose concentrations and improved whole body insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant db/db mice, as measured by glucose tolerance testing (Fig. 3g). Pointing to an effect on hepatic gluconeogenesis, Cry1 over-expression also lowered glucose excursions in pyruvate tolerance testing studies (Fig. 3h).

Based on the rhythmic changes in hepatic Creb phosphorylation, we suspected that Cry1 may disrupt effects of GLU on adenyl cyclase (AC) activation during fasting (Fig. 1c). Supporting this idea, GLU-IP administration increased hepatic cAMP concentrations at ZT10–13, when Cry1 expression is low, and to a lesser extent at ZT22–1, when Cry1 levels are elevated (Fig. 4a). Consistently, Ad-Cry1 expression reduced hepatic cAMP concentrations in ZT10–13 fasted mice exposed to GLU (Fig. 4b). Indeed, amounts of phosphorylated Creb were down-regulated in livers of fasted Ad-Cry1 mice compared to GFP control animals (Fig. 4c).

We evaluated effects of Cry on Creb-Crtc2 signaling in cultures of primary hepatocytes. Similar to its effects in liver, Ad-Cry1 also down-regulated CRE:Luc reporter activity, as well as gluconeogenic gene expression in cells exposed to GLU (Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). By contrast with its effect in cells exposed to GLU, Ad-Cry1 did not reduce gluconeogenic gene expression or CRE:Luc reporter activity in cells treated with forskolin (FSK), a direct activator of AC. Consistent with these results, Ad-Cry1 expression reduced cAMP accumulation in cells exposed to GLU but not to FSK (Fig. 4d). In addition, RNAi-mediated knockdown of Cry1 and 2 increased cAMP content in primary hepatocytes exposed to GLU but not to FSK (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Pointing to a more general effect of this repressor, Cry1/2 over-expression also reduced cAMP accumulation in response to VIP treatment in fibroblasts expressed Vipr2 (Supplementary Fig. 8). Together, these results indicate that Cry1 acts upstream of AC to regulate hepatic Creb activity during fasting.

To evaluate further the mechanism, we performed in vitro reconstitution assays. Addition of isoproterenol (ISO) to plasma membranes from HEK293T cells, which express β-adrenergic receptors, increased cAMP accumulation in vitro (Fig. 4e,f). Co-incubation of plasma membrane fractions with cytoplasmic extracts from transfected HEK293T cells expressing Cry1 potently inhibited cAMP increases in response to ISO relative to control (GFP) extracts. We considered that Cry1 could disrupt cAMP accumulation either directly by binding to relevant signaling components, or indirectly by stimulating the expression of an intra-cellular inhibitor. Supporting the former hypothesis, immuno-depletion of HA-tagged Cry1 with HA-specific antiserum restored cAMP accumulation in response to ISO, whereas control IgG had no effect (Fig. 4f). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Cry1 inhibits activation of the Creb-Crtc2 pathway in liver by disrupting cAMP production in response to ligand-dependent activation of Gs coupled receptors.

Based on its ability to disrupt GPCR but not FSK-mediated increases in cAMP production, Cry would be predicted to associate with either GPCRs or with the Gsα subunit of heterotrimeric G protein. Although it did not interact detectably with the GPCR family member Vipr2, Cry associated with Gsα in pull-down assays of membrane fractions from transfected HEK293T cells incubated with recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-Cry protein (Fig. 4g). We also observed the Cry-Gsα interaction in reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assays of HEK293T cells and primary hepatocytes (Fig. 4h). Together, these data demonstrate a role for extra-nuclear Cry in regulating cAMP production.

The circadian clock has been known to modulate hepatic gluconeogenesis for over 20 years, although the underlying mechanism has remained unclear. We found that the liver clock regulates the gluconeogenic program through Cry-mediated inhibition of Creb activity during fasting. Historically regarded as a transcriptional repressor, Cry appeared to inhibit gluconeogenic gene expression primarily by blocking GPCR mediated increases in cAMP and in the subsequent phosphorylation of Creb (Fig. 4i). These results are consistent with recent findings that hepatic Creb phosphorylation oscillates in a circadian fashion8. Similar to our observations in liver, cAMP concentrations have also been found to oscillate in the clock master organ, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, reaching a nadir when Cry expression is highest16. Future studies should provide further insight in to the detailed mechanism by which Cry modulates Gs effects on cAMP in liver and other tissues.
