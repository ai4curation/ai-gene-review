SPARC, a matricellular protein that affects cellular adhesion and proliferation, 
is produced in remodeling tissue and in pathologies involving fibrosis and 
angiogenesis. In this study we have asked whether peptides generated from 
cleavage of SPARC in the extracellular milieu can regulate angiogenesis. Matrix 
metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, but not MMP-1 or 9, showed significant activity 
toward SPARC. Limited digestion of recombinant human (rhu)SPARC with purified 
catalytic domain of rhuMMP-3 produced three major fragments, which were 
sequenced after purification by HPLC. Three synthetic peptides (Z-1, Z-2, and 
Z-3) representing motifs from each fragment were tested in distinct assays of 
angiogenesis. Peptide Z-1 (3.9 kDa, containing a Cu2+-binding sequence KHGK) 
exhibited a biphasic effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation by cultured 
endothelial cells and stimulated vascular growth in the chick chorioallantoic 
membrane (CAM). In contrast, peptides Z-2 (6.1 kDa, containing Ca2+-binding EF 
hand-1) and Z-3 (2.2 kDa, containing neither Cu2+-binding motifs nor EF hands), 
inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner and exhibited 
no effects on vessel growth in the CAM. Reciprocal results were obtained in a 
migration assay in native collagen gels: peptide Z-1 was ineffective over a 
range of concentrations, whereas Z-2 or Z-3 stimulated cell migration. 
Therefore, proteolysis of SPARC by MMP-3 produced peptides that regulate 
endothelial cell proliferation and/or migration in vitro in a mutually exclusive 
manner. One of these peptides containing KHGK also demonstrated a 
concentration-dependent effect on angiogenesis.
