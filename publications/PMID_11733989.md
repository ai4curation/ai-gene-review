The CCR4-NOT complex is an evolutionarily conserved, transcriptional regulatory 
complex that is involved in controlling mRNA initiation, elongation and 
degradation. The CCR4-NOT proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae exist in two 
complexes, 1.9x10(6) Da and 1.0x10(6) Da (1.0 MDa) in size, and individual 
components of these complexes display such disparate functions as binding to and 
restricting TFIID functions, contacting SAGA and contributing to mRNA 
deadenylation. As a first step in characterizing the functional roles of the 1.0 
MDa complex, we have purified it to near homogeneity. Mass spectrometric 
analysis was subsequently used to identify all the components of the complex. 
The 1.0 MDa complex was found to contain CCR4, CAF1, NOT1-5 and two new 
proteins, CAF40 and CAF130. CAF130 and CAF40 are two unique yeast proteins, with 
CAF40 displaying extensive homology to proteins from other eukaryotes. 
Immunoprecipitation and gel filtration experiments confirmed that CAF130 and 
CAF40 are components of both of the 1.9 MDa and 1.0 MDa CCR4-NOT complexes. 
Biochemical analysis indicated that the CAF40 and CAF130 proteins bind to the 
NOT1 protein and exist in a location separate from the two other subsets of 
proteins in the complex: the CCR4 and CAF1 proteins, and the NOT2, NOT4 and NOT5 
proteins. Moreover, CAF40 was able to interact with human NOT1, suggesting that 
human CAF40 would also be a component of the recently identified human CCR4-NOT 
complex. Analysis of caf40 and caf130 deletions indicated that they elicited 
phenotypes shared by defects in other CCR4-NOT genes. The distinct location of 
CAF40 and CAF130 and the evolutionary conservation of CAF40 implicate them in 
novel roles in the function of the CCR4-NOT complex.
