The retinitis pigmentosa 2 (RP2) gene is responsible for a particular variant of 
X chromosome-linked eye disease. Previously, RP2 was shown to bind the GTP form 
of the small G protein Arf-like 3 (Arl3), thus qualifying as an effector. Here 
we present the Arl3-GppNHp-RP2 complex structure, which shows features 
resembling complexes with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Biochemical 
analysis showing a 90,000-fold stimulation of the GTPase reaction together with 
the structure of an Arl3-GDP-AlF4--RP2 transition state complex showed that RP2 
is an efficient GAP for Arl3, with structural features similar to other GAPs. 
Furthermore, the effect of mutations in patients with retinitis pigmentosa 
correlated with their effect on catalysis, in particular the mutation of the 
arginine finger of RP2. The cognate G protein-GAP pair is conserved in yeast as 
Cin4-Cin2, and the ability of RP2 to act as a GAP can be correlated with its 
ability to complement a CIN2-deletion phenotype.
