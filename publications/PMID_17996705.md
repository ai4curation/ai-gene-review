Posttranslational modifications mediate important regulatory functions in 
biology. The acetylation of the p53 transcription factor, for example, promotes 
transcriptional activation of target genes including p21. Here we show that the 
acetylation of two lysine residues in p53 promotes recruitment of the TFIID 
subunit TAF1 to the p21 promoter through its bromodomains. UV irradiation of 
cells diacetylates p53 at lysines 373 and 382, which in turn recruits TAF1 to a 
distal p53-binding site on the p21 promoter prior to looping to the core 
promoter. Disruption of acetyl-p53/bromodomain interaction inhibits TAF1 
recruitment to both the distal p53-binding site and the core promoter. Further, 
the TFIID subunits TAF4, TAF5, and TBP are detected on the core promoter prior 
to TAF1, suggesting that, upon DNA damage, distinct subunits of TFIID may be 
recruited separately to the p21 promoter and that the transcriptional activation 
depends on posttranslational modification of the p53 transcription factor.
