Posttranslational modifications mediate important regulatory functions in 
biology. The acetylation of the p53 transcription factor, for example, promotes 
transcriptional activation of target genes including p21. Here we show that the 
acetylation of two lysine residues in p53 promotes recruitment of the TFIID 
subunit TAF1 to the p21 promoter through its bromodomains. UV irradiation of 
cells diacetylates p53 at lysines 373 and 382, which in turn recruits TAF1 to a 
distal p53-binding site on the p21 promoter prior to looping to the core 
promoter. Disruption of acetyl-p53/bromodomain interaction inhibits TAF1 
recruitment to both the distal p53-binding site and the core promoter. Further, 
the TFIID subunits TAF4, TAF5, and TBP are detected on the core promoter prior 
to TAF1, suggesting that, upon DNA damage, distinct subunits of TFIID may be 
recruited separately to the p21 promoter and that the transcriptional activation 
depends on posttranslational modification of the p53 transcription factor.

Conflict of Interest

The Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute has filed patent application on TAF1 degraders described in this study in which Z. P Shultz, E. Schönbrunn, J. M Lopchuk, J. Chen are co-inventors. The remaining authors declare no competing interests.

The bromodomain-containing protein TAF1 (TFII-250) is the largest component of the multiprotein assembly TFIID, a dynamic complex that serves as a general factor for transcription initiation. CRISPR and RNAi screens of pan cancer cell lines revealed TAF1 is broadly required for optimal cell growth and survival, but a subset of cell lines showed enhanced TAF1 dependence. These observations suggest that TAF1 has the potential to serve as a therapeutic target in sensitive tumors. Current approaches employed to target TAF1 are limited to monovalent small molecule inhibitors of the bromodomain. However, recent studies showed that such inhibitors lack cancer cell kill potential. We applied a structure-guided approach to generate cereblon (CRBN) recruiting PROTAC degraders of TAF1 using the chemical scaffolds of ceralasertib and GNE371. We present evidence that GNE371-based PROTACs are effective in degradation of TAF1 at concentrations as low as 1 nM. TAF1 depletion activated p53 and induced apoptosis in AML cell lines and certain solid tumor cells. An in vivo active TAF1 PROTAC inhibited the growth of AML tumor xenograft. The results showed that inhibition of bromodomain is not sufficient to inactivate TAF1 functions, while a PROTAC approach induces strong biological effects. Furthermore, TAF1 PROTACs have therapeutic potential against AML and other sensitive tumors.
