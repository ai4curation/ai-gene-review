## Abstract

1. FEBS Lett. 1996 Nov 18;397(2-3):347-51. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(96)01209-4.

The alpha1 and alpha2 isoforms of the AMP-activated protein kinase have similar 
activities in rat liver but exhibit differences in substrate specificity in 
vitro.

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric complex composed of 
a catalytic subunit (alpha) and two regulatory subunits (beta and gamma). Two 
isoforms of the catalytic subunit (alpha1 and alpha2) have been identified. We 
show here that the alpha1- and alpha2-containing complexes contribute 
approximately equally to total AMPK activity in rat liver. Furthermore, 
expression of alpha1 or alpha2 with beta and gamma in mammalian cells 
demonstrates that both complexes have equal specific activity measured with the 
SAMS peptide. Using variant peptides, however, we show that alpha1 and alpha2 
exhibit slightly different substrate preferences, which suggest that the two 
isoforms could play different physiological roles within the cell.
