## Abstract

1. FEBS Lett. 1996 Nov 18;397(2-3):347-51. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(96)01209-4.

The alpha1 and alpha2 isoforms of the AMP-activated protein kinase have similar 
activities in rat liver but exhibit differences in substrate specificity in 
vitro.

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric complex composed of 
a catalytic subunit (alpha) and two regulatory subunits (beta and gamma). Two 
isoforms of the catalytic subunit (alpha1 and alpha2) have been identified. We 
show here that the alpha1- and alpha2-containing complexes contribute 
approximately equally to total AMPK activity in rat liver. Furthermore, 
expression of alpha1 or alpha2 with beta and gamma in mammalian cells 
demonstrates that both complexes have equal specific activity measured with the 
SAMS peptide. Using variant peptides, however, we show that alpha1 and alpha2 
exhibit slightly different substrate preferences, which suggest that the two 
isoforms could play different physiological roles within the cell.

Ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN) growth hormone-releasing hormone (Ghrh) neurotransmission governs counterregulatory hormone release. Recent studies document Ghrh control of hypoglycemia-sensitive counterregulatory neurotransmitter expression in dorsomedial VMN (VMNdm) Ghrh/steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) neurons. In this study, Ghrh receptor (Ghrh-R) gene silencing was implemented in vivo to determine if VMN Ghrh-R shapes counterregulation. Intra-VMN Ghrh-R siRNA augmented corticosterone secretion in vehicle or insulin-injected male rats, but this hormone was correspondingly refractory or inhibited in eu- versus hypoglycemic females. In each sex, gene knockdown up- or down-regulated baseline glucagon and growth hormone (GH) release, but hypoglycemia reversed the direction of Ghrh-R control of each hormone. Single-cell laser catapult-microdissected VMNdm Ghrh/SF-1 neuron multiplex qPCR analysis revealed contrary VMN Ghrh-R gene-silencing effects on eu- versus hypoglycemic SF-1 mRNA levels. In both sexes, Ghrh-R siRNA up-regulated mRNAs encoding counterregulation-repressive (γ-aminobutyric acid) or -enhancing (nitric oxide) transmitter protein markers, unrelated to plasma glycemic profiles. Ghrh-R regulation of Ghrh gene transcription was absent (euglycemic) or stimulatory (hypoglycemic) in females, and receptor control of glutaminase mRNA, a marker for the counterregulatory-augmenting neurochemical glutamate, was lost in hypoglycemic males. Ghrh-R gene silencing caused uniform up-regulation of 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha-2 (AMPKα2) mRNA in each sex, independent of glucose status, but caused dissimilar changes in AMPKα1 transcription in eu- versus hypoglycemic females. The outcomes provide novel evidence that VMN Ghrh-R signaling imposes glucose-dependent control of counterregulatory hormone secretion and distinctive VMNdm neuron counterregulatory transmitter marker gene profiles. Data infer that this metabolic control may involve SF-1 (both sexes)- and AMPKα1 (female)-dependent mechanisms.
