Irreversible GTP hydrolysis by eIF2 is a critical step in translation initiation 
in eukaryotes because it is thought to commit the translational machinery to 
assembling the ribosomal complex at the selected point in the mRNA. Our 
quantitative analysis of the steps and interactions involved in activating GTP 
hydrolysis by eIF2 during translation initiation in vitro indicates that a 
structural rearrangement in the 43S preinitiation complex activates it to become 
fully competent to hydrolyze GTP. Contrary to the prevailing model, release of 
inorganic phosphate after GTP hydrolysis by eIF2, not hydrolysis itself, is 
controlled by recognition of the AUG codon. Release of P(i), which makes GTP 
hydrolysis irreversible, appears to be controlled by the AUG-dependent 
dissociation of eIF1 from the preinitiation complex.
