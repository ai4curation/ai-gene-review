Germline mutations in BRCA2 predispose to hereditary breast cancers. BRCA2 
protein regulates recombinational repair by interaction with RAD51 via a series 
of degenerate BRC repeat motifs encoded by exon 11 (BRCA2(996-2113)), and an 
unrelated C-terminal domain (BRCA2(3265-3330)). BRCA2 is also required for 
meiotic recombination. Here, we show that human BRCA2 binds the meiosis-specific 
recombinase DMC1 and define the primary DMC1 interaction site to a 26 amino-acid 
region (BRCA2(2386-2411)). This region is highly conserved in BRCA2 proteins 
from a variety of mammalian species, but is absent in BRCA2 from Arabidopsis 
thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, and other eukaryotes. We demonstrate the 
critical importance of Phe2406, Pro2408, and Pro2409 at the conserved motif 
(2404)KVFVPPFK(2411). This interaction domain, defined as the PhePP motif, 
promotes specific interactions between BRCA2 and DMC1, but not with RAD51. Thus, 
the RAD51 and DMC1 interaction domains on BRCA2 are distinct from each other, 
allowing coordinated interactions of the two recombinases with BRCA2 at meiosis. 
These results lead us to suggest that BRCA2 is a universal regulator of 
RAD51/DMC1 recombinase actions.
