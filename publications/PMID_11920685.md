Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a MAPKKK family member which 
activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. In non-stressed cells, ASK1 
exists as an inactive complex with the reduced form of thioredoxin. Oxidative 
stress such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) disrupts the ASK1-thioredoxin complex by 
oxidization of thioredoxin and thereby activates ASK1. The precise mechanism by 
which ASK1 is activated after its release from thioredoxin is unknown. Here we 
show that phosphorylation of Thr845 at the activation loop is essential for ASK1 
to be activated by H2O2. ASK1 appears to form a silent homo-oligomer through its 
C-terminal coiled-coil region in non-stressed cells. Following H2O2 treatment, 
pre-existing ASK1 oligomer undergoes conformational change and creates a new 
interface within an oligomer, which ultimately leads to 
trans-autophosphorylation of Thr845. Thus, direct interaction via the 
coiled-coil region is required for self-scaffolding but not sufficient for 
activation of ASK1. Importantly, Thr845 of ASK1 can also be trans-phosphorylated 
by an unidentified Thr845 kinase in response to H2O2 treatment. We propose that 
this potential Thr845 kinase may be an ignition kinase that triggers Thr845 
phosphorylation in oligomerized and activation-competent forms of ASK1.
