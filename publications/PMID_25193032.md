Genetic discoveries in ALS have a significant impact on deciphering molecular 
mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration. The identification of SOD1 as the first 
genetic cause of ALS led to the engineering of the SOD1 mouse, the backbone of 
ALS research, and set the stage for future genetic breakthroughs. In addition, 
careful analysis of ALS pathology added valuable pieces to the ALS puzzle. From 
this joint effort, major pathogenic pathways emerged. Whereas the study of 
TDP43, FUS and C9ORF72 pointed to the possible involvement of RNA biology in 
motor neuron survival, recent work on P62 and UBQLN2 refocused research on 
protein degradation pathways. Despite all these efforts, the etiology of most 
cases of sporadic ALS remains elusive. Newly acquired genomic tools now allow 
the identification of genetic and epigenetic factors that can either increase 
ALS risk or modulate disease phenotype. These developments will certainly allow 
for better disease modeling to identify novel therapeutic targets for ALS. This 
article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Neuromuscular Diseases: Pathology 
and Molecular Pathogenesis.
