Thioredoxin (TRX) is a pleiotropic cellular factor that has thiol-mediated redox 
activity and is important in regulation of cellular processes, including 
proliferation, apoptosis, and gene expression. The activity of several 
transcription factors is posttranslationally altered by redox modification(s) of 
specific cysteine residue(s). One such factor is nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B, 
whose DNA-binding activity is markedly augmented by TRX treatment in vitro. 
Similarly, the DNA-binding activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1) is modified by 
a DNA repair enzyme, redox factor 1 (Ref-1), which is identical to a DNA repair 
enzyme, AP endonuclease. Ref-1 activity is in turn modulated by various 
redox-active compounds, including TRX. We here report the molecular cascade of 
redox regulation of AP-1 mediated by TRX and Ref-1. Phorbol 12-myristate 13 
acetate efficiently translocated TRX into the HeLa cell nucleus where Ref-1 
preexists. This process seems to be essential for AP-1 activation by redox 
modification because co-overexpression of TRX and Ref-1 in COS-7 cells 
potentiated AP-1 activity only after TRX was transported into the nucleus by 
phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate treatment. To prove the direct active 
site-mediated association between TRX and Ref-1, we generated a series of 
substitution-mutant cysteine residues of TRX. In both an in vitro 
diamide-induced cross-linking study and an in vivo mammalian two-hybrid assay we 
proved that TRX can associate directly with Ref-1 in the nucleus; also, we 
demonstrated the requirement of cysteine residues in the TRX catalytic center 
for the potentiation of AP-1 activity. This report presents an example of a 
cascade in cellular redox regulation.
