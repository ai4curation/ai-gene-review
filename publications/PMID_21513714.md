Understanding how p53 is able to specifically respond to particular stress 
signals and regulate many different signalling pathways remains a challenge. 
Several studies have demonstrated that p53's interactions with different protein 
partners are essential for it to be able to coordinate specific responses. In 
particular, the apoptotic pathway is regulated by p53 in cooperation with the 
Apoptosis Stimulating Proteins of p53 (ASPP) proteins. In this study, we showed 
that the ASPP proteins are able to bind and cooperate with p300, a well defined 
co-factor of p53, to selectively regulate p53's transcriptional activity on 
promoters such as p53-inducible gene 3 but not on p21waf1. This is the first 
demonstration that the ASPPs can function together with p300 in regulating the 
transcriptional activity of p53.
