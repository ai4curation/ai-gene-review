Mutations in the gene encoding CLN5 are the cause of Finnish variant late 
infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL), and the gene encoding CLN5 is 1 
of 10 genes (encoding CLN1 to CLN9 and cathepsin D) whose germ line mutations 
result in a group of recessive disorders of childhood. Although CLN5 localizes 
to the lysosomal compartment, its function remains unknown. We have uncovered an 
interaction between CLN5 and sortilin, the lysosomal sorting receptor. However, 
CLN5, unlike prosaposin, does not require sortilin to localize to the lysosomal 
compartment. We demonstrate that in CLN5-depleted HeLa cells, the lysosomal 
sorting receptors sortilin and cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor 
(CI-MPR) are degraded in lysosomes due to a defect in recruitment of the 
retromer (an endosome-to-Golgi compartment trafficking component). In addition, 
we show that the retromer recruitment machinery is also affected by CLN5 
depletion, as we found less loaded Rab7, which is required to recruit retromer. 
Taken together, our results support a role for CLN5 in controlling the itinerary 
of the lysosomal sorting receptors by regulating retromer recruitment at the 
endosome.
