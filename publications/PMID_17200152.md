Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) cause late-onset 
Parkinson's disease indistinguishable from idiopathic disease. The mechanisms 
whereby missense alterations in the LRRK2 gene initiate neurodegeneration remain 
unknown. Here, we demonstrate that seven of 10 suspected familial-linked 
mutations result in increased kinase activity. Functional and disease-associated 
mutations in conserved residues reveal the critical link between intrinsic 
guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity and downstream kinase activity. LRRK2 
kinase activity requires GTPase activity, whereas GTPase activity functions 
independently of kinase activity. Both LRRK2 kinase and GTPase activity are 
required for neurotoxicity and potentiate peroxide-induced cell death, although 
LRRK2 does not function as a canonical MAP-kinase-kinase-kinase. These results 
suggest a link between LRRK2 kinase activity and pathogenic mechanisms relating 
to neurodegeneration, further supporting a gain-of-function role for LRRK2 
mutations.
