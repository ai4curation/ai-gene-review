Anti-apoptotic activity of BCL-2 is mediated by phosphorylation at the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but how this phosphorylation is regulated and the 
mechanism(s) by which it regulates apoptosis are unknown. We purified 
macromolecular complexes containing BCL-2 from ER membranes and found that BCL-2 
co-purified with the main two subunits of the serine/threonine phosphatase, 
PP2A. The association of endogenous PP2A and BCL-2 at the ER was verified by 
co-immunoprecipitation and microcystin affinity purification. Knock down or 
pharmacological inhibition of PP2A caused degradation of phosphorylated BCL-2 
and led to an overall reduction in BCL-2 levels. We found that this degradation 
was due to the action of the proteasome acting selectively at the ER. 
Conversely, overexpression of PP2A caused elevation in endogenous BCL-2. Most 
importantly, we found that PP2A knock down sensitized cells to several classes 
of death stimuli (including ER stress), but this effect was abolished in a 
genetic background featuring knock in of a non-phosphorylatable BCL-2 allele. 
These studies support the hypothesis that PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of 
BCL-2 is required to protect BCL-2 from proteasome-dependent degradation, 
affecting resistance to ER stress.
