Using a combination of tandem affinity purification tagging and mass 
spectrometry, we characterized a novel, evolutionarily conserved protein 
phosphatase 4 (PP4)-containing complex (PP4cs, protein phosphatase 4, 
cisplatin-sensitive complex) that plays a critical role in the eukaryotic DNA 
damage response. PP4cs is comprised of the catalytic subunit PP4C; a known 
regulatory subunit, PP4R2; and a novel protein that we termed PP4R3. The 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae PP4R3 ortholog Psy2 was identified previously in a 
screen for sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent and anticancer drug cisplatin. 
We demonstrated that deletion of any of the PP4cs complex orthologs in S. 
cerevisiae elicited cisplatin hypersensitivity. Furthermore human PP4R3 
complemented the yeast psy2 deletion, and Drosophila melanogaster lacking 
functional PP4R3 (flfl) exhibited cisplatin hypersensitivity, suggesting a 
highly conserved role for PP4cs in DNA damage repair. Finally we found that 
PP4R3 may target PP4cs to the DNA damage repair machinery at least in part via 
an interaction with Rad53 (CHK2).
