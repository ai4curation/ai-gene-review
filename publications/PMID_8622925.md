In addition to the five 70-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70) common to germ cells 
and somatic tissues of mammals, spermatogenic cells synthesize HSP70-2 during 
meiosis. To determine if this unique stress protein has a critical role in 
meiosis, we used gene-targeting techniques to disrupt Hsp70-2 in mice. Male mice 
homozygous for the mutant allele (Hsp70-2 -/-) did not synthesize HSP70-2, 
lacked postmeiotic spermatids and mature sperm, and were infertile. However, 
neither meiosis nor fertility was affected in female Hsp70-2 -/- mice. We 
previously found that HSP70-2 is associated with synaptonemal complexes in the 
nucleus of meiotic spermatocytes from mice and hamsters. While synaptonemal 
complexes assembled in Hsp70-2 -/- spermatocytes, structural abnormalities 
became apparent in these cells by late prophase, and development rarely 
progressed to the meiotic divisions. Furthermore, analysis of nuclei and genomic 
DNA indicated that the failure of meiosis in Hsp70-2 -/- mice was coincident 
with a dramatic increase in spermatocyte apoptosis. These results suggest that 
HSP70-2 participates in synaptonemal complex function during meiosis in male 
germ cells and is linked to mechanisms that inhibit apoptosis.
