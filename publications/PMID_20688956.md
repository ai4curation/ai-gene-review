Among mutations in human Runx1/AML1 transcription factors, the t(8;21)(q22;q22) 
genomic translocation that creates an AML1-ETO fusion protein is implicated in 
etiology of the acute myeloid leukemia. To identify genes and components 
associated with this oncogene we used Drosophila as a genetic model. Expression 
of AML1-ETO caused an expansion of hematopoietic precursors in Drosophila, which 
expressed high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mutations in functional 
domains of the fusion protein suppress the proliferative phenotype. In a genetic 
screen, we found that inactivation of EcRB1 or activation of Foxo and superoxide 
dismutase-2 (SOD2) suppress the AML1-ETO-induced phenotype by reducing ROS 
expression in the precursor cells. Our studies indicate that ROS is a signaling 
factor promoting maintenance of normal as well as the aberrant myeloid 
precursors and suggests the importance of antioxidant enzymes and their 
regulators as targets for further study in the context of leukemia.
