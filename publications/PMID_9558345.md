The c-Abl tyrosine kinase protein is implicated in the signaling pathway as well 
as in transcription, DNA repair, apoptosis, and several other vital biological 
processes essential for cell proliferation or differentiation. The interaction 
of c-Abl with DNA is important for some of these functions, but the exact nature 
of this interaction is still a matter of controversy. The present study 
addresses the DNA-binding properties of the human c-Abl protein. Using CASTing 
experiments, the consensus binding site 5'-AA/CAACAAA/C was determined. The 
central highly conserved AAC triplet appears to constitute the crucial core 
element in the binding sequences of the c-Abl protein. The c-Abl DNA-binding 
domain recognizes specific sequences and interacts with deformed DNA structures 
such as four-way junctions and bubble DNA containing a large single-stranded 
loop, as determined by electromobility shift assay, melting temperature studies, 
and binding to specific oligonucleotides covalently linked to beads. Additional 
competition experiments suggest that the interaction mainly involves contacts 
within the minor groove of the double helix. The DNA-binding properties of c-Abl 
are reminiscent of those of high-mobility group (HMG)-like proteins such as 
LEF-1 and SRY. However, the circular permutation and ring closure assays and DNA 
unwinding experiments reveal that, unlike HMGs, c-Abl does not bend its target 
sequence. In addition, it is shown that the protein potentiates the DNA 
relaxation activity of topoisomerase I. These findings indicate that the 
interaction of c-Abl with DNA is both sequence-selective and 
structure-dependent.
