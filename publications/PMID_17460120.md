The yeast DASH complex is a heterodecameric component of the kinetochore 
necessary for accurate chromosome segregation. DASH forms closed rings around 
microtubules with a large gap between the DASH ring and the microtubule 
cylinder. We characterized the microtubule-binding properties of limited 
proteolysis products and subcomplexes of DASH, thus identifying candidate 
polypeptide extensions involved in establishing the DASH-microtubule interface. 
The acidic C-terminal extensions of tubulin subunits are not essential for DASH 
binding. We also measured the molecular mass of DASH rings on microtubules with 
scanning transmission electron microscopy and found that approximately 25 DASH 
heterodecamers assemble to form each ring. Dynamic association and relocation of 
multiple flexible appendages of DASH may allow the kinetochore to translate 
along the microtubule surface.
