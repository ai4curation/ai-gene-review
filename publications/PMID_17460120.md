Abstract

The yeast DASH complex is a heterodecameric component of the kinetochore necessary for accurate chromosome segregation. DASH forms closed rings around microtubules with a large gap between the DASH ring and the microtubule cylinder. We characterized the microtubule-binding properties of limited proteolysis products and subcomplexes of DASH, thus identifying candidate polypeptide extensions involved in establishing the DASH-microtubule interface. The acidic C-terminal extensions of tubulin subunits are not essential for DASH binding. We also measured the molecular mass of DASH rings on microtubules with scanning transmission electron microscopy and found that approximately 25 DASH heterodecamers assemble to form each ring. Dynamic association and relocation of multiple flexible appendages of DASH may allow the kinetochore to translate along the microtubule surface.

INTRODUCTION

Division of one parental cell into two genetically identical progeny requires accurate partitioning of newly replicated chromosomes. Of the many protein assemblies that monitor, regulate, and drive this process, only the kinetochore directly contacts centromeric DNA. In yeast kinetochores, over 60 proteins assemble into distinct subcomplexes on a ∼125-base pair centromere to bind a single microtubule (MT) of the mitotic spindle ( McAinsh et al. , 2003 ). Structural studies of these subcomplexes coupled with functional experiments have begun to add molecular detail to our picture of kinetochores. For example, the yeast Ndc80 complex forms a 570-Å coiled coil rod with two globular domains at each end ( Wei et al. , 2005 ), suggesting a role as a molecular adaptor. The globular domain of the human Ndc80 subunit, Hec1, folds into a MT-binding calponin homology domain ( Wei et al. , 2007 ), and the worm Ndc80 homolog directly binds MTs and facilitates association of additional kinetochore complexes ( Cheeseman et al. , 2006 ). The yeast DASH complex (also called the Dam1 complex) forms closed rings around MTs ( Miranda et al. , 2005 ). DASH can be induced to move along a MT and to translate with the depolymerizing end ( Westermann et al. , 2005 , 2006 ). The interaction resists several picoNewtons of force ( Asbury et al. , 2006 ). DASH may therefore serve to help tether kinetochores to MTs during chromosome segregation.

The DASH complex is necessary for faithful segregation of chromosomes in mitosis. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae complex consists of 10 essential subunits: Dam1p, Duo1p, Dad1p, Dad2p, Spc19, Spc34p, Ask1p, Dad3p, Dad4p, and Hsk3p ( Figure 1 A) ( Cheeseman et al. , 2001 , 2002 ; Janke et al. , 2002 ; Li et al. , 2002 , 2005 ). Loss of functional DASH results in sister chromatids attached to the same spindle pole body, an arrangement that leads to unequal segregation. The homologous complex in Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains similar subunits and localizes to kinetochores as well as to MT plus ends ( Liu et al. , 2005 ; Sanchez-Perez et al. , 2005 ). Although not essential in fission yeast, loss of functional DASH also results in segregation defects. The ring structure observed in vitro may contribute to proper segregation by acting as a processivity factor for kinetochores, allowing chromosomes to remain attached to depolymerizing MT plus ends during anaphase. Rings are commonly found in assemblies that must remain attached to a linear substrate, for example, in the assemblies that carry out DNA replication ( Hingorani and O'Donnell, 2000 ). The mechanism by which the DASH ring binds to and translates along MTs is therefore not only an integral part of how kinetochores work, but also an instance of a molecular solution to a ubiquitous structural challenge.

Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) of MTs decorated with DASH reveals a gap between the inner diameter of DASH and the outer diameter of the MT ( Miranda et al. , 2005 ; Westermann et al. , 2005 , 2006 ). No discrete mass of DASH can be seen abutting the MT, but polypeptide extensions not visibly contrasted by negative stain may position DASH rings around microtubules. On the MT side, the acidic C-termini of tubulin may project from the surface, but the 10–20 amino acids of these unstructured extensions ( Lowe et al. , 2001 ) are unlikely to bridge the 50–100-Å gap of the DASH-MT interface. Because rotary shadowed EM preparations show that DASH is relatively compact, but hydrodynamic measurements yield a Stokes' radius much larger than expected for a globular particle ( Miranda et al. , 2005 ), we believe that extended projections are probably present. No obvious candidates for those bridging elements can be deduced from examination of amino acid sequences of DASH components. We have therefore carried out a series of experiments to determine the location and MT-binding properties of flexible, protease-sensitive polypeptides on DASH. This mapping adds detail to models of how DASH binds to and translates along MTs.

DISCUSSION

Chromosomes move along MTs during various stages of mitosis. In anaphase, progressive MT depolymerization at the plus end drives this translation so that net movement is toward the spindle pole body. We have proposed that the DASH rings are processivity factors that allow kinetochores to translate along a MT without dissociating ( Miranda et al. , 2005 ), and the rings can indeed translate quite freely ( Asbury et al. , 2006 ). The processivity factors that keep a DNA replication complex from dissociating slide loosely along the double helix ( Hingorani and O'Donnell, 2000 ). A similar electrostatic sliding has been suggested for DASH ( Westermann et al. , 2006 ), but the observations reported here lead us to seek an alternative mechanism. In particular, two results favor direct contacts. First, we find that the negatively charged tubulin C-termini on the MT surface do not appear to be essential for ring formation. Second, the DASHΔHsk3p 6mer subcomplex, which contains Dam1p and Duo1p, binds without forming rings. Were encirclement the only property holding DASH components onto a MT, we would expect ring formation to be essential for binding. We also note that sliding clamps in DNA replication need an energy-dependent clamp loader, whereas DASH rings assemble spontaneously around MTs.

Systematic analysis of the MT-binding properties of limited proteolysis products and various subcomplexes defines the nature of the DASH-MT interface. Polypeptide arms from both DASH and MTs could contribute to a molecular bridge across the gap observed between a DASH ring and the MT in EM images, but we determined that DASH alone makes functionally significant contacts across this space. Specifically, Dam1p, Duo1p, or both are probably responsible for MT binding ( Figure 7 A). Cleavage of these proteins with elastase in limited proteolysis experiments abrogates the DASH-MT interaction; presence of these proteins in a subcomplex allows MT-binding. No other subunits meet both criteria. Our conclusion is consistent with previously reported observations from cosedimentation assays. In vitro–translated Dam1p binds MTs ( Hofmann et al. , 1998 ), and a 138-amino acid truncation of the Dam1p C-terminus slightly lowers the affinity of recombinant DASH for MTs ( Westermann et al. , 2005 ). Our experiments also show that upon removal of the acidic C-termini of both α and β tubulin, DASH still binds to and forms rings around MTs. A contrary conclusion was reached with different MT proteolysis protocols, cleavage verification methods, and binding assays ( Westermann et al. , 2005 ); we cannot rationalize the difference in results. Our data suggest a DASH-MT interface in which extensions from DASH rings reach across a gap between the ring and MT and dock on the MT wall ( Figure 7 , B and C).

Our mass measurements indicate that each DASH ring contains ∼20–30 heterodecamers, thereby defining the multiplicity of potential MT-binding contacts. This number is somewhat larger than other estimates. An apparent 16-fold symmetry of rare EM images of DASH bound to MTs led to the conclusion that rings contain 16 heterodecamers ( Westermann et al. , 2006 ); the possibility of 32 copies was not considered. Fluorescence measurements of Ask1p copy number in vivo suggest 16–20 heterodecamers ( Joglekar et al. , 2006 ). STEM is a direct measurement of the molecular mass of an isolated particle and depends on no assumptions other than appropriate calibration of the instrument. In any case, all the various measurements lead to the conclusion that the polyvalent DASH ring contains more sets of MT-binding extensions than the number of MT protofilaments.

We note that polyvalent attachment through extended arms or loops is fully compatible with diffusive motion, provided that the individual interactions are weak and that an individual arm may reach multiple tubulin docking sites. A range of potential attachment directions is consistent with the variable geometry with which DASH can decorate MTs in vitro, as rings and helices of various pitch. The lack of protection from proteolysis of Dam1p and Duo1p suggests that the cleavable extensions on these subunits are in dynamic equilibrium between the on and off positions. Indeed, all of the arms are unlikely to be engaged at once as the resulting avidity would probably yield too strong an attachment for translation along a MT. Thus, we imagine that at any moment only a fraction of the arms contact the MT. As the population of attached arms shifts, the ring will undergo diffusional translation along the MT, moving in one direction or the other at each step depending on whether a preponderance of the newly attaching arms lie toward one end or the other.

Molecular motors have been thought to move the kinetochore actively toward the poles during anaphase ( Hyman et al. , 1992 ), but various lines of evidence suggest that motors are not essential in mitosis. Chromosome movement in S. cerevisiae , as measured by transient sister separation during metaphase, is unaffected by individual deletion of any of the nuclear kinesin-like motors ( Tytell and Sorger, 2006 ). Poleward kinetochore movement in S. pombe during anaphase is unaffected by deletion all three known minus end–directed motors ( Grishchuk and McIntosh, 2006 ). Experiments with chromosomes and MTs in vitro demonstrate that MT depolymerization alone is sufficient to drive chromosome segregation toward the MT minus end ( Koshland et al. , 1988 ).

At least two models have been proposed to explain how MT depolymerization drives chromosome motion in anaphase. The conformational wave model ( Koshland et al. , 1988 ) suggests that the curling of protofilaments at the depolymerizing end of a MT exerts force directly on the kinetochore, a process that propagates poleward. The diameter of the DASH ring would prevent it from falling off during depolymerization, making DASH a suitable force transducer ( Miranda et al. , 2005 ; Westermann et al. , 2005 ). The biased-diffusion model ( Hill, 1985 ) presumes that multiple attachment sites are present and that the energy required to move from one site on the MT lattice to another is sufficiently small to allow rapid diffusion of the kinetochore. At the depolymerizing plus end, new attachment sites are selectively available on one side of the ring and not the other, biasing diffusion toward the minus end. Curling could also contribute, especially if the docking sites were at the protofilament interface. Our picture of associating and dissociating bridges between the body of the DASH ring and the MT surface is compatible with either model.
