BACKGROUND: Hox proteins are transcription factors involved in crucial processes 
during animal development. Their mode of action remains scantily documented. 
While other families of transcription factors, like Smad or Stat, are known cell 
signaling transducers, such a function has never been squarely addressed for Hox 
proteins.
RESULTS: To investigate the mode of action of mammalian Hoxa1, we characterized 
its interactome by a systematic yeast two-hybrid screening against ~12,200 
ORF-derived polypeptides. Fifty nine interactors were identified of which 45 
could be confirmed by affinity co-purification in animal cell lines. Many Hoxa1 
interactors are proteins involved in cell-signaling transduction, cell adhesion 
and vesicular trafficking. Forty-one interactions were detectable in live cells 
by Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation which revealed distinctive 
intracellular patterns for these interactions consistent with the selective 
recruitment of Hoxa1 by subgroups of partner proteins at vesicular, cytoplasmic 
or nuclear compartments.
CONCLUSIONS: The characterization of the Hoxa1 interactome presented here 
suggests unexplored roles for Hox proteins in cell-to-cell communication and 
cell physiology.
