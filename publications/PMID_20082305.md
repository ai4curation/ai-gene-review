This study was performed to define the roles of actin-binding proteins in the 
regulation of actin filament assembly associated with cellular signal 
transduction pathways in stromal cell proliferation. Genistein, a tyrosine 
protein kinase inhibitor, decreased the intracellular Ca(2+) and attenuated cell 
proliferation and DNA synthesis through the beta-catenin and cyclin D1 pathway 
in human umbilical CD105-positive cells. Immunoprecipitation studies using 
anti-beta-actin antibody revealed that several actin-binding proteins implicated 
in cells include formin-2 (FMN-2), caldesmon (CaD), tropomyosin (Tm), and 
profilin. Protein levels of these proteins in whole cell lysates were not 
significantly changed by genistein. Three Tm isoforms, Tm-1, Tm-2, and Tm-4, 
were found to be present in cells. Genistein caused a reduction in levels of 
mRNAs coding for Tm-1 and Tm-4, but had no significant effect on Tm-2 mRNA 
levels. Immunofluorescence confocal scanning microscopy indicated that changes 
in the subcellular distribution of Tm and CaD, in which the diffuse cytosolic 
staining was shifted to show colocalization with actin stress fibers. In 
contrast, genistein-induced accumulation of FMN-2 and profilin in the 
peri-nuclear area. Silencing of FMN-2 by small interfering RNA resulted in 
increases of intracellular Ca(2+) and rendered genistein resistance in 
decreasing intracellular Ca(2+) in cells. These results provide the novel 
findings that genistein acts by modulating the cellular distribution of 
actin-binding proteins in association with alterations of cellular signal 
transduction pathways in human stromal cell proliferation.
