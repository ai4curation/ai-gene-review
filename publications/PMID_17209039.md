Biogenesis of human mitochondrial complex I (CI) requires the coordinated 
assembly of 45 subunits derived from both the mitochondrial and nuclear genome. 
The presence of CI subcomplexes in CI-deficient cells suggests that assembly 
occurs in distinct steps. However, discriminating between products of assembly 
or instability is problematic. Using an inducible NDUFS3-green fluorescent 
protein (GFP) expression system in HEK293 cells, we here provide direct evidence 
for the stepwise assembly of CI. Upon induction, six distinct 
NDUFS3-GFP-containing subcomplexes gradually appeared on a blue native Western 
blot also observed in wild type HEK293 mitochondria. Their stability was 
demonstrated by differential solubilization and heat incubation, which 
additionally allowed their distinction from specific products of CI instability 
and breakdown. Inhibition of mitochondrial translation under conditions of 
steady state labeling resulted in an accumulation of two of the 
NDUFS3-GFP-containing subcomplexes (100 and 150 kDa) and concomitant 
disappearance of the fully assembled complex. Lifting inhibition reversed this 
effect, demonstrating that these two subcomplexes are true assembly 
intermediates. Composition analysis showed that this event was accompanied by 
the incorporation of at least one mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunit, thereby 
revealing the first entry point of these subunits.
