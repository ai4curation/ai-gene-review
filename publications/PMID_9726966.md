The yeast SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is comprised of 11 tightly 
associated polypeptides (SWI1, SWI2, SWI3, SNF5, SNF6, SNF11, SWP82, SWP73, 
SWP59, SWP61, and SWP29). We have used matrix-assisted laser desorption 
ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify the genes that encode 
the SWP59 and SWP61 subunits. Surprisingly, we find that SWP59 and SWP61 are 
encoded by the ARP9 and ARP7 genes, respectively, which encode members of the 
actin-related protein (ARP) family. Sequence analyses have shown that ARP9 and 
ARP7 are 24-26% identical (48-51% similar) to yeast actin and that they are 
likely to maintain the overall actin fold. Deletion of either the ARP9 or ARP7 
gene causes typical swi/snf phenotypes, including growth defects on media 
containing galactose, glycerol, or sucrose as sole carbon sources. ARP9 and ARP7 
are also required for expression of an HO-lacZ fusion gene and for full 
transcriptional enhancement by the GAL4 activator. The identification of two ARP 
family members as crucial subunits of the SWI/SNF complex suggests that the 
complex may contain a total of three different ATPase subunits; furthermore, the 
similarity of ARP7 and ARP9 to the HSP and HSC family of ATPases suggests the 
possibility that chromatin remodeling by SWI/SNF may involve chaperone-like 
activities.
