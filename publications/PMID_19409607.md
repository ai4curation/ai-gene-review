MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are posttranscriptional modulators of gene expression and 
play an important role in many developmental processes. We report here that 
expression of microRNA-145 (miR-145) is low in self-renewing human embryonic 
stem cells (hESCs) but highly upregulated during differentiation. We identify 
the pluripotency factors OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 as direct targets of miR-145 and 
show that endogenous miR-145 represses the 3' untranslated regions of OCT4, 
SOX2, and KLF4. Increased miR-145 expression inhibits hESC self-renewal, 
represses expression of pluripotency genes, and induces lineage-restricted 
differentiation. Loss of miR-145 impairs differentiation and elevates OCT4, 
SOX2, and KLF4. Furthermore, we find that the miR-145 promoter is bound and 
repressed by OCT4 in hESCs. This work reveals a direct link between the core 
reprogramming factors and miR-145 and uncovers a double-negative feedback loop 
involving OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and miR-145.
