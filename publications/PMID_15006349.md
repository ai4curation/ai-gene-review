Anopheles mosquitoes are major vectors of human malaria in Africa. Large 
variation exists in the ability of mosquitoes to serve as vectors and to 
transmit malaria parasites, but the molecular mechanisms that determine 
vectorial capacity remain poorly understood. We report that the 
hemocyte-specific complement-like protein TEP1 from the mosquito Anopheles 
gambiae binds to and mediates killing of midgut stages of the rodent malaria 
parasite Plasmodium berghei. The dsRNA knockdown of TEP1 in adults completely 
abolishes melanotic refractoriness in a genetically selected refractory strain. 
Moreover, in susceptible mosquitoes this knockdown increases the number of 
developing parasites. Our results suggest that the TEP1-dependent parasite 
killing is followed by a TEP1-independent clearance of dead parasites by lysis 
and/or melanization. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of 
TEP1-mediated parasite killing will be of great importance for our understanding 
of the principles of vectorial capacity in insects.
