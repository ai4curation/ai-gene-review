Human Bre1, an E3 ligase for H2B monoubiquitination, binds p53 and enhances 
activator-dependent transcription. Ebp1, an ErbB3 receptor-binding protein, 
inhibits cell proliferation and acts as a tumor suppressor. Here, we show that 
hBre1 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Ebp1 tumor suppressor and promotes its 
polyubiquitination and degradation. Ebp1 is polyubiquitinated in cancer cells, 
which is regulated by its phosphorylation. We identified hBre1 acting as an E3 
ligase for Ebp1 and increasing its polyubiquitination. Depletion of hBre1 blocks 
Ebp1's polyubiquitination and elevates its protein level, preventing cancer 
proliferation. hBre1 binds Ebp1 and suppresses its repressive effect on E2F-1. 
Moreover, Ebp1 protein level is substantially diminished in human cancers. It is 
robustly phosphorylated and localized in the nucleus of primary gliomas, 
correlating with hBre1 subcellular residency. Thus, hBre1 inhibits Ebp1's tumor 
suppressive activity through mediating its polyubiquitination and degradation.
