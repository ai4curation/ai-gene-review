Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is essential for natural killer (NK) cell 
differentiation. In this study, we assessed whether the receptor tyrosine kinase 
Axl and its ligand, Gas6, are involved in IL-15-mediated human NK 
differentiation from CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Blocking the 
Axl-Gas6 interaction with a soluble Axl fusion protein (Axl-Fc) or the vitamin K 
inhibitor warfarin significantly diminished the absolute number and percentage 
of CD3(-)CD56(+) NK cells derived from human CD34(+) HPCs cultured in the 
presence of IL-15, probably resulting in part from reduced phosphorylation of 
STAT5. In addition, CD3(-)CD56(+) NK cells derived from culture of CD34(+) HPCs 
with IL-15 and Axl-Fc had a significantly diminished capacity to express 
interferon-gamma or its master regulator, T-BET. Culture of CD34(+) HPCs in the 
presence of c-Kit ligand and Axl-Fc resulted in a significant decrease in the 
frequency of NK precursor cells responding to IL-15, probably the result of 
reduced c-Kit phosphorylation. Collectively, our data suggest that the Axl/Gas6 
pathway contributes to normal human NK-cell development, at least in part via 
its regulatory effects on both the IL-15 and c-Kit signaling pathways in CD34(+) 
HPCs, and to functional NK-cell maturation via an effect on the master 
regulatory transcription factor T-BET.
