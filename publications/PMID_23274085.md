Sestrins (Sesns) protect cells from oxidative stress. The mechanism underlying 
the antioxidant effect of Sesns has remained unknown, however. The Nrf2-Keap1 
pathway provides cellular defense against oxidative stress by controlling the 
expression of antioxidant enzymes. We now show that Sesn1 and Sesn2 interact 
with the Nrf2 suppressor Keap1, the autophagy substrate p62, and the ubiquitin 
ligase Rbx1 and that the antioxidant function of Sesns is mediated through 
activation of Nrf2 in a manner reliant on p62-dependent autophagic degradation 
of Keap1. Sesn2 was upregulated in the liver of mice subjected to fasting or 
subsequent refeeding with a high-carbohydrate, fat-free diet, whereas only 
refeeding promoted Keap1 degradation and Nrf2 activation, because only refeeding 
induced p62 expression. Ablation of Sesn2 blocked Keap1 degradation and Nrf2 
activation induced by refeeding and thereby increased the susceptibility of the 
liver to oxidative damage resulting from the acute stimulation of lipogenesis 
associated with refeeding.
