The Ssn6-Tup1 corepressor complex regulates many genes in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. Three mechanisms have been proposed to explain its repression 
functions: 1) nucleosome positioning by binding histone tails; 2) recruitment of 
histone deacetylases; and 3) direct interference with the general transcription 
machinery or activators. It is unclear if Ssn6-Tup1 utilizes each of these 
mechanisms at a single gene in a redundant manner or each individually at 
different loci. A systematic analysis of the contribution of each mechanism at a 
native promoter has not been reported. Here we employed a genetic strategy to 
analyze the contributions of nucleosome positioning, histone deacetylation, and 
Mediator interference in the repression of chromosomal Tup1 target genes in 
vivo. We exploited the fact that Ssn6-Tup1 requires the ISW2 chromatin 
remodeling complex to establish nucleosome positioning in vivo to disrupt 
chromatin structure without affecting other Tup1 repression functions. Deleting 
ISW2, the histone deacetylase gene HDA1, or genes encoding Mediator subunits 
individually caused slight or no derepression of RNR3 and HUG1. However, when 
Mediator mutations were combined with Deltaisw2 or Deltahda1 mutations, enhanced 
transcription was observed, and the strongest level of derepression was observed 
in triple Deltaisw2/Deltahda1/Mediator mutants. The increased transcription in 
the mutants was not due to the loss of Tup1 at the promoter and correlated with 
increased TBP cross-linking to promoters. Thus, Tup1 utilizes multiple redundant 
mechanisms to repress transcription of native genes, which may be important for 
it to act as a global corepressor at a wide variety of promoters.
