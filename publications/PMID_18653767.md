Anoikis, apoptotic cell death due to loss of cell adhesion, is critical for 
regulation of tissue homeostasis in tissue remodeling. Fibrogenesis is 
associated with reduced fibroblast apoptosis. The matricellular protein 
thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) regulates cell adhesion and motility during tissue 
remodeling and in fibrogenesis. The N-terminal domain of TSP1 binds to the 
calreticulin-LRP1 receptor co-complex to signal down-regulation of cell adhesion 
and increased cell motility through focal adhesion disassembly. TSP1 signaling 
through calreticulin-LRP1 activates cell survival signals such as PI3-kinase. 
Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that TSP1 supports cell survival under 
adhesion-independent conditions to facilitate tissue remodeling. Here, we show 
that platelet TSP1, its N-terminal domain (NoC1) as a recombinant protein, or a 
peptide comprising the calreticulin-LRP1 binding site [amino acids 17-35 (hep 
I)] in the N-terminal domain promotes fibroblast survival under 
anchorage-independent conditions. TSP1 activates Akt and decreases apoptotic 
signaling through caspase 3 and PARP1 in suspended fibroblasts. Inhibition of 
PI3K/Akt activity blocks TSP1-mediated anchorage-independent survival. 
Fibroblasts lacking LRP1 or expressing calreticulin lacking the TSP1 binding 
site do not respond to TSP1 with anchorage-independent survival. These data 
define a novel role for TSP1 signaling through the calreticulin/LRP1 co-complex 
in tissue remodeling and fibrotic responses through stimulation of anoikis

Abstract

Anoikis, apoptotic cell death due to loss of cell adhesion, is critical for regulation of tissue homeostasis in tissue remodeling. Fibrogenesis is associated with reduced fibroblast apoptosis. The matricellular protein thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) regulates cell adhesion and motility during tissue remodeling and in fibrogenesis. The N-terminal domain of TSP1 binds to the calreticulin-LRP1 receptor co-complex to signal down-regulation of cell adhesion and increased cell motility through focal adhesion disassembly. TSP1 signaling through calreticulin-LRP1 activates cell survival signals such as PI3-kinase. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that TSP1 supports cell survival under adhesion-independent conditions to facilitate tissue remodeling. Here, we show that platelet TSP1, its N-terminal domain (NoC1) as a recombinant protein, or a peptide comprising the calreticulin-LRP1 binding site [amino acids 17–35 (hep I)] in the N-terminal domain promotes fibroblast survival under anchorage-independent conditions. TSP1 activates Akt and decreases apoptotic signaling through caspase 3 and PARP1 in suspended fibroblasts. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt activity blocks TSP1-mediated anchorage-independent survival. Fibroblasts lacking LRP1 or expressing calreticulin lacking the TSP1 binding site do not respond to TSP1 with anchorage-independent survival. These data define a novel role for TSP1 signaling through the calreticulin/LRP1 co-complex in tissue remodeling and fibrotic responses through stimulation of anoikis resistance.—Pallero, M.

DISCUSSION

Regulation of anoikis is critical for tissue homeostasis, development, fibrosis, and tumor metastasis (9) . These current studies show that TSP1 binding to the CRT-LRP1 co-complex confers anoikis resistance in fibroblasts. The N-terminal domain of TSP1 or a peptide mimetic of the CRT binding sequence of TSP1 was sufficient to prevent fibroblast anoikis, suggesting that other domains of TSP1 are not necessary for anoikis resistance. Furthermore, a recombinant TSP1 protein lacking the N-terminal domain did not support anchorage-independent survival or Akt signaling. Studies of deficient fibroblasts indicated that TSP1 induces anoikis resistance through binding to the CRT-LRP1 co-complex, which stimulates PI3-kinase-dependent Akt activation and down-regulation of apoptotic signaling, as measured by caspase 3 and PARP1 cleavage. Both CRT and LRP1 were required to mediate TSP1-induced anoikis resistance. These findings identify a novel function for the TSP1 N-terminal domain and suggest that TSP1 is a potentially important survival factor for cells with altered cell adhesion during development, tissue remodeling, and fibrogenesis.

The transition to an intermediate state of adhesion through focal adhesion disassembly induced by TSP1/hep I requires both ERK and PI3K activity (40 , 44) . In current studies, we show that TSP1-induced anchorage-independent survival also requires PI3K, but not ERK, since MEK inhibitors had no significant effect on cell viability stimulated by TSP1 (Fig. 4) . This suggests that MEK signaling is required for the downstream cytoskeletal changes involved in focal adhesion disassembly, but not in the downstream antiapoptotic signaling induced by TSP1. PI3K activity typically activates Akt (54) . We previously found that the CRT-binding hep I sequence rapidly activates PI3 kinase (44) . There is also recent evidence showing that the N-terminal domain of TSP1 or the hep I peptide stimulates Akt phosphorylation in a PKC-dependent manner by adherent human umbilical vein endothelial cells, although these studies suggested that signaling occurs through binding to syndecan-4 (25) . These studies suggest that TSP1 activates cell survival signals under conditions in which cell adhesion is altered. Furthermore, under completely nonadherent conditions, our present studies now provide evidence that TSP1 or its N-terminal domain can bind to cells in suspension and activate survival signaling through Akt. There is emerging evidence that integrin ligation is insufficient to prevent anoikis and that cells suppress cell death signals through mechanosensing of the ECM (56 , 57) . RhoA-generated cytoskeletal tension is required for anoikis to occur (56) , and inhibition of Rho/ROCK decreases anoikis of embryonic stem cell neural progenitors (58) . These observations are consistent with our previous studies showing that TSP1 through its hep I sequence decreases Rho kinase activity in cells in the intermediate adhesion state (41) ; this raises the possibility that TSP1 induces anoikis resistance not only through stimulation of Akt signaling, but also by down-regulation of Rho-generated mechanotension.

TSP1 is known to induce apoptosis of both endothelial cells and fibroblasts through binding to either CD36 or CD47. Although one might expect that ligation of CRT-LRP1 by the N-terminal domain can have prosurvival effects in the absence of the type I repeats and the C-terminal domains that bind CD36 or CD47, respectively, it is interesting that the intact TSP1 molecule can stimulate anoikis resistance in fibroblasts known to express CD47 and CD36 (22 , 59) . The failure of delN-1 to stimulate Akt activation or cell survival under anchorage-independent conditions in our current studies suggests that these receptors are not involved in mediating resistance to anoikis. In contrast, the anchorage-independent NB4 myeloid leukemia cell lines undergo increased apoptosis in the presence of TSP1, hep I, or the GGWSHW peptide from the TSP type 1 repeats over a 5-day period (60) . Nonetheless, these studies suggest that both the intact molecule, as well as the isolated N-terminal domain, can stimulate survival of adhesion-dependent cells under adhesion-independent conditions.

CRT is a calcium-binding endoplasmic reticulum chaperone that is also present on the cell surface and has multiple roles in regulating cell adhesion, calcium signaling, clearance of apoptotic cells, and immunogenicity of tumor cells (61 , 62 , 63 , 64 , 65 , 66) . Recent evidence shows that soluble forms of CRT enhance cell migration and wound healing (61) . Like TSP1, CRT has complex roles in apoptosis. CRT has the potential to influence apoptosis both positively and negatively via modulation of intracellular calcium stores (67 , 68 , 69) . Overexpression of CRT promotes apoptosis during cardiac differentiation by negatively regulating Akt activation through up-regulation of the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A (70) . In contrast, our results show that TSP1 binding to CRT on the cell surface is critical for activation of Akt and anchorage-independent survival. This is likely independent of CRT’s role in calcium homeostasis, since K42 MEFs expressing CRT lacking the TSP1 binding site (K42 CRTΔ19.36 ) are nonresponsive to TSP1-induced anoikis resistance. Although the mechanism of CRT translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface has not been defined, it is well established that CRT expression on the cell surface is up-regulated by conditions of cellular stress, as well as by apoptotic inducers such as anthracyclines and by alterations in endoplasmic reticulum calcium levels (62 , 71 , 72) . We also showed that CRT expression induced by stable transfection of fibroblasts is sufficient to induce CRT surface expression (Supplemental Fig. 1). Purified CRT binds to cell death receptors CD40 Ligand, TRAIL, and Fas ligand (73) . Furthermore, cell surface CRT is a receptor for an apoptogenic bacterial wall peptidoglycan peptide and cell surface CRT complexes with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1-TRADD to mediate apoptosis on peptide binding (67) . CRT expression on apoptotic cells mediates the clearance of these cells by LRP1 (63 , 74) . An anti-inflammatory protein, adiponectin binds CRT, which acts in concert with LRP1 to mediate clearance of apoptotic cells (75) . Interestingly, TSP1 was recently identified as a binding protein for adiponectin (76) . It will be interesting to determine how TSP1 binding to CRT affects CRT interactions with these inflammatory and cell death mediators. These data show that cell surface CRT is important for regulation of apoptotic signaling and cell clearance; furthermore, cell surface CRT appears capable of interacting with multiple factors that can stimulate differing outcomes, suggesting that CRT can act as a cell survival switch, depending on the stimulating ligand and its binding partners at the membrane.

TSP1 is highly expressed during embryogenesis, but its expression in the adult is limited to areas of active tissue remodeling, such as during wound healing and in fibrotic tissues (17 , 77 , 78) . TSP1 stimulates cell migration into wounds, and it can affect deposition of the extracellular matrix through modulation of collagens, matrix metalloproteases, and TGF-β activation (79 , 80 , 81) . A study by Lee et al. (31) also demonstrates the presence of the N-terminal TSP1 fragment in wounds. During early wound repair, fibroblasts become migratory and might require survival signals generated by TSP1-binding to the CRT-LRP1 co-complex as a substitute for integrin-dependent signals during extensive extracellular matrix remodeling: this scenario would be consistent with the delayed induction of granulation tissue in dermal wounds of TSP1 null mice (79 , 81) . Conversely, fibroblast apoptosis is critical for resolution of granulation tissue, and persistent fibroblast survival is associated with fibrosis (11 , 82 , 83) . This would be consistent with down-regulation of TSP1 expression during the resolving stages of wound healing (79) . TSP1 is frequently elevated in many fibrotic conditions, and it is possible that anoikis resistance signaling through TSP1 contributes to fibrotic progression.

TSP1 belongs to a family of matricellular proteins, including TSP2, SPARC, hevin, tenascin-C and osteopontin, which are expressed at high levels during development and in response to tissue injury or remodeling. Matricellular proteins are generally deadhesive, inducing an intermediate state of adhesion (34) . Thus, it is interesting to speculate that induction of cell survival signals and anoikis resistance could be a common phenotype induced by other matricellular proteins to promote cell survival in the context of decreased cell adhesion during tissue remodeling. Consistent with this idea, SPARC and tenascin-C mediate survival of gliomas and human chondrosarcoma cells, respectively, through activation of Akt (84 , 85) . Tenascin-C treated neuronal cell suspensions had increased numbers of surviving neurons after transplantation (86) . Results from our lab also show that tenascin FNIII A-D increases anchorage-independent MEF survival (data not shown). Osteopontin activates Akt in a PI3-kinase dependent manner through CD44 (87) : anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells was specifically inhibited with an antibody against osteopontin and a splice variant of osteopontin enhanced anoikis resistance (88) . The urokinase/uPAR complex, which also mediates intermediate adhesion, similarly induces anoikis resistance (89 , 90 , 91) . In turn, activation of Akt appears to regulate the expression of various matricellular proteins, including tenascin-C, osteopontin, and TSP1, creating a possible positive feedback loop (92 , 93 , 94) .

In summary, these studies have identified a novel function for the N-terminal CRT-binding sequence of TSP1 in mediating anoikis resistance in fibroblasts. The studies suggest additional mechanisms by which TSP1 regulates wound healing and fibrotic responses.
