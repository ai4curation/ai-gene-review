In cells lacking centrosomes, such as those found in female meiosis, chromosomes 
must nucleate and stabilize microtubules in order to form a bipolar spindle. 
Here we report the identification of Dasra A and Dasra B, two new components of 
the vertebrate chromosomal passenger complex containing Incenp, Survivin, and 
the kinase Aurora B, and demonstrate that this complex is required for 
chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle formation. The failure 
of microtubule stabilization caused by depletion of the chromosomal passenger 
complex was rescued by codepletion of the microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin 
MCAK, whose activity is negatively regulated by Aurora B. By contrast, we 
present evidence that the Ran-GTP pathway of chromatin-induced microtubule 
nucleation does not require the chromosomal passenger complex, indicating that 
the mechanisms of microtubule assembly by these two pathways are distinct. We 
propose that the chromosomal passenger complex regulates local MCAK activity to 
permit spindle formation via stabilization of chromatin-associated microtubules.
