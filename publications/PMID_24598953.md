OBJECTIVE: Increased glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity has been 
demonstrated in heart failure. This study sought to assess myocardial glucose 
6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in retraining of the subpulmonary ventricle 
of adult goats.
METHODS: Eighteen adult goats were divided into three groups: traditional (fixed 
banding), sham, and intermittent (adjustable banding, daily 12-hour systolic 
overload). Systolic overload (70% of systemic pressure) was maintained during a 
4-week period. Right ventricle, pulmonary artery and aortic pressures were 
measured throughout the study. All animals were submitted to echocardiographic 
and hemodynamic evaluations throughout the protocol. After the study period, the 
animals were killed for morphological and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
activity assessment.
RESULTS: A 55.7% and 36.7% increase occurred in the intermittent and traditional 
right ventricle masses, respectively, when compared with the sham group 
(P<0.05), despite less exposure of intermittent group to systolic overload. No 
significant changes were observed in myocardial water content in the 3 groups 
(P=0.27). A 37.2% increase was found in right ventricle wall thickness of 
intermittent group, compared to sham and traditional groups (P<0.05). Right 
ventricle glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was elevated in the 
traditional group, when compared to sham and intermittent groups (P=0.05).
CONCLUSION: Both study groups have developed similar right ventricle 
hypertrophy, regardless less systolic overload exposure of intermittent group. 
Traditional systolic overload for adult subpulmonary ventricle retraining causes 
upregulation of myocardial glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. It may 
suggest that the undesirable "pathologic systolic overload" is influenced by 
activation of penthose pathway and cytosolic Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate availability. This altered energy substrate metabolism can elevate 
levels of free radicals by Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, 
an important mechanism in the pathophysiology of heart failure.

OBJETIVO: O aumento da atividade miocárdica da Glicose 6-Fosfato Desidrogenase 
tem sido demonstrado na insuficiência cardíaca. Este estudo avalia a atividade 
miocárdica da Glicose 6-Fosfato Desidrogenase no treinamento do ventrículo 
subpulmonar de cabras adultas.
MÉTODOS: Foram utilizadas 18 cabras adultas, divididas em três grupos: 
convencional (bandagem fixa), sham e intermitente (bandagem ajustável; 12 horas 
diárias de sobrecarga). A sobrecarga sistólica (70% da pressão sistêmica) foi 
mantida durante quatro semanas. As avaliações hemodinâmica e ecocardiográfica 
foram realizadas durante todo o estudo. Depois de cumprido o protocolo, os 
animais foram mortos para avaliação morfológica e da atividade da Glicose 
6-Fosfato Desidrogenase dos ventrículos.
RESULTADOS: Apesar de haver sobrecarga sistólica proporcionalmente menor no 
ventrículo subpulmonar do grupo intermitente (P=0,001), ambos os grupos de 
estudo apresentaram aumento da massa muscular de magnitude similar. Os grupos 
intermitente e convencional apresentaram aumento da massa de 55,7% e 36,7% 
(P<0,05), respectivamente, em comparação ao grupo sham. O conteúdo de água do 
miocárdio não variou entre os grupos estudados (P=0,27). O ecocardiograma 
demonstrou maior aumento (37,2%) na espessura do ventrículo subpulmonar do grupo 
intermitente, em relação aos grupos sham e convencional (P<0,05). Foi observada 
maior atividade da Glicose 6-Fosfato Desidrogenase na hipertrofia miocárdica do 
ventrículo subpulmonar do grupo convencional, comparada aos grupos sham e 
intermitente (P=0,05).
CONCLUSÃO: Ambos os grupos de treinamento ventricular desenvolveram hipertrofia 
ventricular, a despeito do menor tempo de sobrecarga sistólica no grupo 
intermitente. A maior atividade de Glicose 6-Fosfato Desidrogenase observada no 
grupo convencional pode refletir um desequilíbrio redox, com maior produção de 
fosfato de dinucleotídeo de nicotinamida e adenina e glutationa reduzida, um 
mecanismo importante da fisiopatologia da insuficiência cardíaca.

INTRODUCTIONBoth adult and adolescent patients diagnosed with congenially corrected transposition of
the great arteries (CCTGA) as well as those with transposition of the great arteries
(TGA) who underwent either Senning or Mustard surgery can develop right ventricle
dysfunction (systemic) [1,2]. Subpulmonary ventricular
retraining for anatomical correction, in those patients, still presents disappointing
results. Hypertrophy induced by acute pressure overload can lead to foci of cellular
necrosis in the hypertrophied myocardium and, consequently, to late ventricular
dysfunction [3,4]. At present, it is imperative to understand the
molecular mechanisms involved in hypertrophy of the mature myocardium induced by
pulmonary trunk banding (PTB) in order to establish retraining protocols for a more
"desirable" physiological hypertrophy.In physiological conditions, fatty acids, especially the long chain ones, act as the
main myocardial energy substrate [5]. Fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria represents
approximately 70% of all ATP production in a normal heart [6,7]. On the other hand, several studies have shown that there is
greater preference for glucose oxidation by cardiac substrates in heart failure and in a
hypertrophic heart [8,9]. However, the change in energy
substrate varies according to the etiology and severity of the ventricular dysfunction,
where the degree of metabolic modulation plays an important role in determining adaptive
or maladaptive function in terms of states leading to pathological hypertrophy.G6PD is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is an
alternate and independent pathway from glycolysis, generating nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and pentose (ribose-5-phosphate). It catalyzes the
conversion of Glucose 6-Phosphate into 6-Phosphogluconolactone. The process is divided
into two phases: generation of NADPH and non-oxidative synthesis of pentose. It
maintains the level of the NADPH coenzyme, which in turn maintains the level of reduced
glutathione, protecting the cells, in normal conditions, from oxidative lesions.
Therefore, the more NADPH is needed, the greater the activity level of the G6PD
enzyme.There is evidence that greater G6PD activity leads to increased production of superoxide
radicals as well as oxidative stress in diabetes, heart failure, and hypertension.
Previous studies of the energy metabolism of acute myocardial hypertrophy in young
animals have shown an increase in G6PD activity associated with ventricular dysfunction
in continuous systolic overload, compared to intermittent overload [10].In the subset of the subpulmonary ventricle retraining of adult patients for the double
switch operation , it would be also interesting to analyze changes in energy metabolism.
This study sets out to evaluate qualitative differences in the process of myocardial
hypertrophy induced by continuous and intermittent pressure overload, through biological
markers such as G6PD, which show occasional phenotypic changes to the energy
metabolism.

INTRODUCTION

Both adult and adolescent patients diagnosed with congenially corrected transposition of
the great arteries (CCTGA) as well as those with transposition of the great arteries
(TGA) who underwent either Senning or Mustard surgery can develop right ventricle
dysfunction (systemic) [1,2]. Subpulmonary ventricular
retraining for anatomical correction, in those patients, still presents disappointing

"desirable" physiological hypertrophy.

In physiological conditions, fatty acids, especially the long chain ones, act as the
main myocardial energy substrate [5]. Fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria represents
approximately 70% of all ATP production in a normal heart [6,7]. On the other hand, several studies have shown that there is

hypertrophic heart [8,9]. However, the change in energy
substrate varies according to the etiology and severity of the ventricular dysfunction,
where the degree of metabolic modulation plays an important role in determining adaptive
or maladaptive function in terms of states leading to pathological hypertrophy.

G6PD is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is an
alternate and independent pathway from glycolysis, generating nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and pentose (ribose-5-phosphate). It catalyzes the
conversion of Glucose 6-Phosphate into 6-Phosphogluconolactone. The process is divided
into two phases: generation of NADPH and non-oxidative synthesis of pentose. It

Therefore, the more NADPH is needed, the greater the activity level of the G6PD
enzyme.

There is evidence that greater G6PD activity leads to increased production of superoxide
radicals as well as oxidative stress in diabetes, heart failure, and hypertension.
Previous studies of the energy metabolism of acute myocardial hypertrophy in young
animals have shown an increase in G6PD activity associated with ventricular dysfunction
in continuous systolic overload, compared to intermittent overload [10].

In the subset of the subpulmonary ventricle retraining of adult patients for the double
switch operation , it would be also interesting to analyze changes in energy metabolism.
This study sets out to evaluate qualitative differences in the process of myocardial
hypertrophy induced by continuous and intermittent pressure overload, through biological
markers such as G6PD, which show occasional phenotypic changes to the energy
metabolism.

METHODSThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee for the Analysis of Research Projects at
- InCor University of Sao Paulo Medical School (process: SDC 2660/05/080) and carried
out in accordance with the regulations on the use of animals in teaching and research of
the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation (COBEA). Eighteen adult goats with
comparable weight (P=0.63) were used, divided into three groups: (1)
Traditional group (n=6, weight=26.33 kg ± 2.32 kg, PTB with continuous systolic
overload of the RV); (2) Sham or Positive Control group (n=6, weight=26.42
kg±2.63 kg, loose banding, no overload of the RV); and Intermittent group (n=6,
weight=25.17 kg ± 2.48 kg, PTB with adjustable device and 12 hours/day of
intermittent systolic overload of the RV).AnesthesiaThe animals were fasted for 24 hours before the surgery and received Xylazine 2%, 0.1
mg/kg IM, as preanesthetic medication. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 1% (7
mg/kg), intravenously (IV) for orotracheal intubation. The animals were maintained
under mechanical ventilation (Takaoka Fuji Maximus, São Paulo, SP), with
inspired oxygen fraction between 60 and 100% and Isoflurane inhalation (1 to 2%). The
goats were placed in the right lateral decubitus and monitored with continuous
electrocardiogram (ECG) and invasive arterial pressure (auricular artery).
Postoperative pain relief was obtained in the first three days by administering
Tramadol chlorhydrate (2 mg/kg, intramuscular).Surgical ProcedureThe goats were prepared for the sterile procedure, as described in previous studies
[11,12]. For animals in the Traditional group,
pulmonary trunk (PT) banding was performed with cardiac tape (Polysuture, São
Sebastião do Paraíso, MG), positioned about 10 mm above the valve.
Animals in the Sham and Intermittent groups had an adjustable banding device
implanted immediately above the pulmonary valve and fixed to the PT adventitia. The
insufflation button was implanted and fixed subcutaneously in the thorax. Hemodynamic
monitoring catheters were exteriorized and maintained filled with heparin. The
following antibiotics were administered prophylactically to all animals: cefazolin
(30 mg/Kg), gentamicin (4 mg/Kg), and Benzathine Penicillin (500,000 IU),
intramuscular. The Benzathine Penicillin dose was repeated after two weeks. In
addition, Heparin Sodium 5,000 IU was administered daily by subcutaneous injection
until the end of the protocol.Description of the adjustable banding deviceThe adult model device was developed in collaboration with SILIMED
(Indústria de silicone e instrumental
médico-cirúrgico e hospitalar Ltda., Rio de Janeiro, RJ),
as previously published [11,12]. It has an outer diameter of
24 mm and is 6 mm wide. The inner surface has a distensible silicon layer, 0.6 to 0.8
mm thick, whose expansion compresses the lumen of the PT according to the amount of
liquid injected in the insufflation button. This button is implanted subcutaneously
so that fine adjustments to the diameter of the banding ring can be made
percutaneously.RV systolic overload protocol and pressure readingsTraditional GroupRV training started during the banding implant surgery. The animals remained under
continuous systolic overload of the RV for a period of four weeks, with
conventional fixed banding adjusted on the day of the surgery in order to reach an
RV systolic pressure of about 70% of systemic systolic pressure, provided that
there was no more than a 10% drop in systemic systolic pressure. Pressures of RV,
PT, and aorta (Ao) were recorded twice a week with the animal conscious and
immobilized on a special stretcher.Sham GroupAs in the Traditional group, hemodynamic measurements were taken twice a week
during the four weeks of the study and the banding device was kept deflated
throughout the protocol.Intermittent GroupThe RV training started after approximately 60 hours of convalescence. As in the
Traditional group, baseline pressures of RV, PT, and Ao were recorded with the
animal conscious and the device completely deflated. Subsequently, the adjustable
banding device was insufflated with 0.9% saline in order to reach the same RV
systolic overload as the Traditional group. The pressures were then measured once
again. The RV systolic overload was maintained for a period of 12 hours, after
which arterial pressures were read one more time. After that, the device was
deflated and pressures were measured again. The process of insufflating and
deflating the device was performed daily for four weeks, with pressures being
measured three times a week. On alternate days, the injected volume was the same
as the volume calculated on the last day of hemodynamic measurements.Echocardiographic studyAll animals underwent echocardiographic evaluation by the same observer prior to the
protocol and weekly after surgery. During the exams, the goats were sedated with
Ketamine (10 mg/kg, intramuscular) and kept in the left lateral decubitus. The ACUSON
Cypress (Siemens Healthcare, Mountain View, USA) echocardiography machine was used as
well as the multi-frequency sector transducer (1.8-3.6 MHz) to capture images and
analyze flow. The thicknesses of the interventricular septum (IVS) and left ventricle
(LV) posterior wall were measured by two-dimensional echocardiogram at the end of
diastole through longitudinal parasternal section at the mitral valve cusps
[13]. The
thickness of the RV free wall was obtained through transverse parasternal section (at
the great vessels and at the papillary muscles level) and longitudinal four-chamber
section in the region where its boundaries were more easily seen. Finally, the
arithmetic mean of those values was obtained.Weighing cardiac massesAt the end of the protocol, the animals were euthanized for resection of the heart.
Anesthesia was deepened and heparin (5 mg/kg) was administered endovenously. Then,
potassium chloride was administered until cardiac arrest. At that time, samples of
the RV, LV, and interventricular septum were collected, weighed, and immediately
placed in tagged plastic containers. The samples were stored in liquid nitrogen
(-80ºC) until they could be transferred to the Genetics and Molecular
Cardiology Laboratory, where they were kept in a special freezer (Forma Scientific
-80º C). The heart was then removed from the thorax. The great vessels, atria,
as well as the cardiac valves and epicardial fat were carefully resected. Ventricular
and septal walls were separated so that cardiac masses could be weighed individually
in a METTLER AE-200 (Mettler-Toledo AG, Greifensee, Switzerland) digital scale.Tissue water contentAfter weighing the cardiac masses, samples were collected from each one for water
content assessment. Every sample was initially weighed (IW), then wrapped in aluminum
foil and properly identified before being placed in an incubator (temperature:
55-60º C). After about 70 hours of dehydration, every sample was weighed once
again to determine dry weight (DW). The percentage of water content was then
determined by the following formula, assuming the water distribution was homogenous
in the septum and ventricles:WC (%) = 100 - (DW x IW-1 x 100)Analysis of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) maximum activityG6PD maximum activity was determined in the septum and ventricle samples obtained.
Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in extraction buffer
(proportion 1:5 weight/volume). The material kept in ice was homogenized using
Polytron (PT 3100, Kinematica AG, Littau-Lucerne, Switzerland), at maximum speed for
30 seconds. Cell remnants were separated by centrifugation (15,000 g, 15 minutes,
4ºC) using a Centrifuge 5417 C/R- Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany). Enzymatic
activity was analyzed using the supernatant of the last centrifugation.Proteins were quantified using the BCATM protein assay kit (PIERCE Biotechnology,
Rockford, IL, USA). Results were expressed as nmol.min-1.mg-1
of protein present in the extract. The extraction buffer for G6PD contained Tris-HCl
(50 mM) and EDTA (1 mM), with a pH of 8.0. The assay buffer (270 mL/sample) was
comprised of Tris-HCl (8.6 mM), MgCl2 (6.9 mM), NADP+ (0.4 mM),
and Triton X-100 0.05% (volume/volume), with a pH of 7.6. The reaction was initiated
by adding 15 mL of Glucose-6-phosphate (1.2 mM) to the enzymatic extract (15 mL
sample) and it was monitored for 10 minutes at 25º C. Absorbance was monitored
at 340 nm, the extinction coefficient being 6.22 for that particular wavelength.The biochemical reaction is based on glucose phosphorylation and subsequent oxidation
of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate catalyzed by G6PD. G6PD activity levels
were determined indirectly as the total NADPH produced in the pentose phosphate
pathway.Statistical AnalysisMeans of the hemodynamic and echocardiographic variables were compared between groups
and throughout the protocol by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated
measures. Values for mass, water content, and G6PD maximum activity in the RV, LV,
and IVS were compared by one-way ANOVA. Both analyses were followed by the Bonferroni
post hoc test. Systolic overload imposed on the RV, in the Traditional and
Intermittent groups, was assessed by calculating the areas under the curve
(trapezoidal method). The comparison between those areas was made through unpaired
Student's t-test. Values were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD),
unless otherwise indicated. The significance level was 5% for all cases. Statistical
analyses were done using GraphPad Prism v.4 (San Diego, CA, USA) and SigmaStat
v.3.11.0 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).

the great vessels and at the papillary muscles level) and longitudinal four-chamber
section in the region where its boundaries were more easily seen. Finally, the
arithmetic mean of those values was obtained.

Weighing cardiac massesAt the end of the protocol, the animals were euthanized for resection of the heart.
Anesthesia was deepened and heparin (5 mg/kg) was administered endovenously. Then,
potassium chloride was administered until cardiac arrest. At that time, samples of
the RV, LV, and interventricular septum were collected, weighed, and immediately
placed in tagged plastic containers. The samples were stored in liquid nitrogen
(-80ºC) until they could be transferred to the Genetics and Molecular
Cardiology Laboratory, where they were kept in a special freezer (Forma Scientific
-80º C). The heart was then removed from the thorax. The great vessels, atria,
as well as the cardiac valves and epicardial fat were carefully resected. Ventricular
and septal walls were separated so that cardiac masses could be weighed individually
in a METTLER AE-200 (Mettler-Toledo AG, Greifensee, Switzerland) digital scale.

Tissue water contentAfter weighing the cardiac masses, samples were collected from each one for water
content assessment. Every sample was initially weighed (IW), then wrapped in aluminum
foil and properly identified before being placed in an incubator (temperature:
55-60º C). After about 70 hours of dehydration, every sample was weighed once
again to determine dry weight (DW). The percentage of water content was then
determined by the following formula, assuming the water distribution was homogenous
in the septum and ventricles:WC (%) = 100 - (DW x IW-1 x 100)

Analysis of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) maximum activityG6PD maximum activity was determined in the septum and ventricle samples obtained.
Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in extraction buffer
(proportion 1:5 weight/volume). The material kept in ice was homogenized using
Polytron (PT 3100, Kinematica AG, Littau-Lucerne, Switzerland), at maximum speed for
30 seconds. Cell remnants were separated by centrifugation (15,000 g, 15 minutes,
4ºC) using a Centrifuge 5417 C/R- Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany). Enzymatic
activity was analyzed using the supernatant of the last centrifugation.Proteins were quantified using the BCATM protein assay kit (PIERCE Biotechnology,
Rockford, IL, USA). Results were expressed as nmol.min-1.mg-1
of protein present in the extract. The extraction buffer for G6PD contained Tris-HCl
(50 mM) and EDTA (1 mM), with a pH of 8.0. The assay buffer (270 mL/sample) was
comprised of Tris-HCl (8.6 mM), MgCl2 (6.9 mM), NADP+ (0.4 mM),
and Triton X-100 0.05% (volume/volume), with a pH of 7.6. The reaction was initiated
by adding 15 mL of Glucose-6-phosphate (1.2 mM) to the enzymatic extract (15 mL
sample) and it was monitored for 10 minutes at 25º C. Absorbance was monitored
at 340 nm, the extinction coefficient being 6.22 for that particular wavelength.The biochemical reaction is based on glucose phosphorylation and subsequent oxidation
of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate catalyzed by G6PD. G6PD activity levels
were determined indirectly as the total NADPH produced in the pentose phosphate
pathway.

Statistical AnalysisMeans of the hemodynamic and echocardiographic variables were compared between groups
and throughout the protocol by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated
measures. Values for mass, water content, and G6PD maximum activity in the RV, LV,
and IVS were compared by one-way ANOVA. Both analyses were followed by the Bonferroni
post hoc test. Systolic overload imposed on the RV, in the Traditional and
Intermittent groups, was assessed by calculating the areas under the curve
(trapezoidal method). The comparison between those areas was made through unpaired
Student's t-test. Values were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD),
unless otherwise indicated. The significance level was 5% for all cases. Statistical
analyses were done using GraphPad Prism v.4 (San Diego, CA, USA) and SigmaStat
v.3.11.0 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).

RESULTSHemodynamicsRV/PT pressure gradientThe Traditional group showed a decrease in gradient after the second postoperative
day (from 45.00 mmHg ± 4.90 mmHg to 39.25 mmHg ± 13.05 mmHg), but
remained stable until the end of the protocol (limits: 36.33 mmHg ± 4.04
mmHg to 40.00 mmHg ± 7.72 mmHg). During euthanasia, there was a significant
decrease in the RV/PT gradient in the Traditional group
(P<0.05), compared to the values of the fourth week. In the
Sham group, as opposed to the others, pressure gradient (limits: 4.67 mmHg
± 2.08 mmHg to 9.40 mmHg ± 4.51 mmHg) was maintained throughout the
protocol (P<0.05).Peak pressure gradients were significantly higher in the Intermittent group
(limits: 46.67 mmHg ± 6.80 mmHg to 59.00 mmHg ± 8.29 mmHg)
(P<0.05), alternating with periods of "rest" of the RV. The
RV/PT gradient remained elevated in both study groups compared to the Sham group
(P<0.001). The Traditional group was subjected to a
significantly larger area of systolic overload (23,764 mmHg.h ± 2,192
mmHg.h) than the Intermittent group (17,414 mmHg.h ± 1,144 mmHg.h;
P<0.0001). Both Traditional and Intermittent groups had
larger areas of systolic overload than the Sham group (3,841 mmHg.h ± 1,298
mmHg.h; P<0.05).RV/Ao pressure ratioBaseline RV/Ao pressure ratio of approximately 0.25 was similar in all groups.
During surgery, RV/Ao ratio of 0.70 was reached in the stimulated groups. However,
after the first week, the ratio decreased significantly in the Traditional group
(P<0.05) and remained stable for the remainder of the
study. In the Sham group, the baseline RV/Ao ratio remained stable throughout the

RV/Ao ratio was kept at around 0.7 throughout the study, as opposed to the
Traditional group (Figure 1;

subjected to intermittent versus traditional systolic overload, highlighting the energy
metabolism in the ventricular retraining of mature myocardium. From a morphological
standpoint, differences in hypertrophy in favor of the Traditional group were expected
due to the higher exposure of the myocardium to hypertrophic stimuli, quantified by the
larger area of systolic overload of the right ventricle.Even though both ventricular retraining groups were able to promote ventricular
hypertrophy of similar magnitude compared to the Sham group, the echocardiographic
findings of the Intermittent group showed increased RV free wall thickness. However, the
length of time of the hypertrophic process was greater than that found in in young
animals submitted to just 96-hour intermittent systolic overload protocol.Likewise, morphological and/or echocardiographic analyses revealed no changes in septal
thickness, which also diverges from previous studies in young animals that showed
significant increase in the septal mass [10]. Perhaps this deviation can be explained by a more
efficient protein production in young as opposed to mature myocardium. All three groups
showed no variation in myocardium water content, a sign of cellular edema, suggesting
the gain in mass was mainly due to enhanced protein synthesis.Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated impaired functional and
morphological RV performance of adult goats submitted to Traditional systolic overload
under the same protocol. [11,12]. Likewise, there was a
concordance of impaired RV function and increased RV G6PD activity of Traditional group
after 4-week study period, corroborating the findings of the 96-hour systolic overload
in young animals [10].
Increased G6PD activity indicates an exacerbation of the pentose phosphate pathway and
it can mean loss of redox balance, with higher production of NADPH and reduced
glutathione, as well as development of oxidative stress derived from superoxide anions
associated with NADPH oxidase.Under pathological conditions, NADPH is produced by activation of G6PD after stimuli
from a range of factors, such as angiotensin II, thrombin, and alpha tumor necrosis
factor [14,15]. Cardiomyopathy related to protein aggregation
and myocardial lesion would be the final consequence. There is growing evidence that
increased G6PD activity is associated with oxidative and reductive stress, with new
drugs being developed in order to inhibit its activity [16]. For instance, patients with
diabetes mellitus show increased G6PD activity and NADPH levels. This metabolic disorder
is associated with endothelial dysfunction due to the inhibition of nitric oxide
synthesis [17].Although the mechanisms through which most of the free radicals are produced in the
heart are not completely known, it has been suggested that higher glucose oxidation
increases the potential of the mitochondrial membrane thereby augmenting NADPH oxidase
activity in the vascular system and, consequently, increasing the production of
superoxide anions [18,19]. The latter would act as
mediators of diabetic vasculopathy and precursors of myocardial dysfunction related to
the disease [20,21]. There is a 10-fold increase in G6PD activity in
pacing-induced heart failure compared to normal hearts [22].This study did not directly assess the production of free radicals associated with NADPH
oxidase; however, it can be speculated that the overexpression of G6PD observed in the
RV of the Traditional group indicates that the Pentose pathway increases the
availability of NADPH, providing the release of free radicals via NADPH oxidase and
nitric oxide synthase. Thus, this could lead to myocardial lesion caused by accumulation
of superoxide anions and protein aggregation and, subsequently, to ventricular
dysfunction should the overload continue. This is corroborated by the fact that
functional recovery of hearts with compensated hypertrophy is significantly higher than
that of non-hypertrophic hearts when myocardial perfusion is intermittently
reestablished, a maneuver which prevents or minimizes the accumulation of glycolytic
products and H+ ions. Indeed, reestablishment of this subendocardial coronary
flow during the resting periods of the Intermittent group would avoid the accumulation
of the products of glycolysis and H+ ions.Besides, fatty acid oxidation is directly stimulated during the reestablishment of
subendocardial reperfusion in the resting periods from systolic overload as a result of
changes in the enzymes and metabolites responsible for the regulation of fatty acid
oxidation. Predominance of fatty acid oxidation during periods of rest of the RV could
lead to decreased myocardial glucose uptake. On the other hand, increased efficiency of
intermittent systolic overload could be related to the release of hypertrophic stimuli
and the cascade of protein synthesis, just as in the Traditional group, yet with
decreased myocardial energy expenditure. The mechanisms of the hypertrophic process
triggered by molecular cascade are likely to happen under good conditions during the
12-hour resting period and ideal oxygen delivery. Therefore, the type of retraining, in
terms of level and duration of the systolic overload as well as its impact on the
myocardium, must be considered. Even though the increase in G6PD is an unspecified
pathway for production of free radicals, this study has found an agreement between
previously shown right ventricular dysfunction in the Traditional group and the increase
in G6PD activity, a situation where there is inadequate oxygen delivery due to
continuous systolic overload, likely high consumption of ATP, and, hence, larger
production of free radicals.Limitations of the studyThere are limitations to implementing the results of this study in human beings.
Firstly, metabolism and morphological aspects can differ among species. Secondly, the
great arteries were normally related in the animals; hence, the ventricle studied
(anatomically right) is not the same as the target population in humans (anatomically
left).Finally, it is difficult to make meaningful inferences about a hypertrophic process
involving several factors based solely on the activity of a particular enzyme. To
this end, it would be ideal to also analyze the production of free radicals and/or
markers of myocardial lesion since there are several influences at play from other
metabolic pathways. This rational suggests that future studies of the production of
oxidized glutathione, free radicals, and apoptosis may provide important information
to this research line.

CONCLUSIONThis study has shown that ventricular retraining in both groups of adult goats led to
right ventricular hypertrophy without myocardial edema. Continuous systolic overload
promoted increased G6PD activity in the RV myocardium. This enzymatic hyperactivity may
be related to increased production of free radicals caused by greater demand for
constant myocardial overload stimulus. Conversely, intermittent systolic overload
enabled a more efficient RV hypertrophy, considering the smaller area of systolic
overload of the RV and decreased G6PD activity.
