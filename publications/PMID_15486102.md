Abstract

The first decision made by an angiosperm seed, whether to germinate or not, is based on integration of various environmental signals such as water and light. The phytochromes (Phys) act as red and far-red light (Pfr) photoreceptors to mediate light signaling through yet uncharacterized pathways. We report here that the PIF3-like 5 (PIL5) protein, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is a key negative regulator of phytochrome-mediated seed germination. PIL5 preferentially interacts with the Pfr forms of Phytochrome A (PhyA) and Phytochrome B (PhyB). Analyses of a pil5 mutant in conjunction with phyA and phyB mutants, a pif3 pil5 double mutant, and PIL5 overexpression lines indicate that PIL5 is a negative factor in Phy-mediated promotion of seed germination, inhibition of hypocotyl negative gravitropism, and inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. Our data identify PIL5 as the first Phy-interacting protein that regulates seed germination.

INTRODUCTION

As sessile organisms, plants must carefully integrate various environmental signals for optimization of growth and development. Among these signals, light plays a prominent role not only as an energy source, but also as a key environmental signal regulating various aspects of the plant life cycle. At least three photoreceptor systems, consisting of cryptochromes (Crys), phytochromes (Phys), and phototropins (Phots), are responsible for sensing light conditions and initiating various plant light responses ( Fankhauser and Staiger, 2002 ). These photoreceptor systems differ in their abilities to perceive specific wavelengths and initiate specific light responses ( Sullivan and Deng, 2003 ). Phytochromes perceive the red and far-red regions of the spectrum ( Quail et al., 1995 ; Neff et al., 2000 ), cryptochromes perceive the UV-A/blue regions ( Ahmad and Cashmore, 1993 ; Lin et al., 1995 ), and phototropins perceive the blue region of the spectrum ( Huala et al., 1997 ).

In Arabidopsis thaliana , five phytochromes (PhyA, PhyB, PhyC, PhyD, and PhyE), two cryptochromes (cry1 and cry2), and two phototropins (phot1 and phot2) constitute the three photoreceptor systems ( Quail, 1998 ; Cashmore et al., 1999 ; Briggs and Christie, 2002 ). The five Arabidopsis phytochromes can be classified into the light-labile PhyA (type I) protein and the light-stable PhyB to PhyE (type II) proteins. Regardless of their light stability, all phytochromes exist as two interconvertible spectral forms: a red light–absorbing (Pr) form and a far-red–light-absorbing (Pfr) form. Phytochromes are translocated to the nucleus in response to light. The translocation to the nucleus, however, differs among the phytochromes. In the case of PhyA, translocation to the nucleus is irreversibly induced by both red and far-red light; by contrast, translocation of type II phytochromes is induced by red light and reversed by far-red light ( Nagy et al., 2000 ; Kircher et al., 2002 ). The irreversible translocation of PhyA to the nucleus by both red and far-red light and the subsequent degradation of PhyA in red light is thought to make PhyA a far-red light receptor, whereas the translocation of type II phytochromes only by red light suggests that PhyB to phyE act as the red light receptors ( Sakamoto and Nagatani, 1996 ; Kircher et al., 1999 ; Sharrock and Clack, 2002 ).

Once translocated to the nucleus, phytochromes trigger various transcription cascades that ultimately lead to regulation of various physiological processes such as seed germination, hypocotyl elongation, cotyledon opening and expansion, anthocyanin accumulation, and chloroplast development ( Chory et al., 1996 ; Neff et al., 2000 ; Sullivan and Deng, 2003 ). Previous studies have shown that transcription factors constitute a large portion of the light-signaling components. Among the identified transcription factors, COG1 encodes a DOF family member, HY5 and HYH encode basic domain/leucine zipper family members, LAF1 encodes a MYB family member, and HFR1 , PIF3 , PIF4 , and PIL1 encode basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family members ( Chattopadhyay et al., 1998 ; Ni et al., 1998 ; Fairchild et al., 2000 ; Ballesteros et al., 2001 ; Holm et al., 2002 ; Huq and Quail, 2002 ; Kim et al., 2003 ; Park et al., 2003 ; Salter et al., 2003 ). The roles of these factors in light signaling are diverse, ranging from modulation of cell elongation to regulation of secondary metabolism. The phytochromes appear to regulate transcription cascades at least partly by directly interacting with some transcription factors, including PIF3 and PIF4 ( Ni et al., 1999 ; Huq and Quail, 2002 ). Alternatively, PHY-mediated signaling regulates levels of these transcription factors either at the transcriptional level ( COG1 , HFR1 , HY5 , PIL1 , and PIF4 ) or at the protein level (HY5, HYH, LAF1, and PIF3) ( Oyama et al., 1997 ; Fairchild et al., 2000 ; Holm et al., 2002 ; Huq and Quail, 2002 ; Park et al., 2003 , 2004 ; Salter et al., 2003 ; Seo et al., 2003 ; Yamashino et al., 2003 ; Bauer et al., 2004 ).

Molecular and genetic investigations have indicated that a set of bHLH transcription factors (PIL1, PIF3, PIF4, and HFR1) play important roles in PHY-mediated light signaling. Of these bHLH transcription factors, PIF3 was the first characterized bHLH transcription factor that preferentially binds to the Pfr forms of both PhyA and PhyB ( Ni et al., 1999 ). Functionally, PIF3 negatively regulates PhyB-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, PhyB-mediated cotyledon expansion, and Phy-mediated cotyledon opening, whereas it positively regulates anthocyanin accumulation ( Kim et al., 2003 ). Analyses of other bHLH transcription factors revealed that HFR1 is a positive regulator of PhyA-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, induction of CAB genes. and inhibition of hypocotyl negative gravitropism ( Fairchild et al., 2000 ; Fankhauser and Chory, 2000 ; Soh et al., 2000 ), whereas PIF4 is a negative regulator of PhyB-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and inhibition of cotyledon expansion ( Huq and Quail, 2002 ). Recent analysis of PIL1 also indicated that shade avoidance is also regulated by a bHLH transcription factor ( Salter et al., 2003 ).

Database analysis indicated that six out of 147 bHLH proteins have PIL (PIF3-like) domains at their N termini ( Yamashino et al., 2003 ); these PIL family members were designated PIL1, PIL2, PIF3, PIF4, PIL5, and PIL6. Expression analyses indicated that some of the PIL family members were regulated by light. For example, expression levels of PIL1 were dramatically reduced in response to white light, whereas expression levels of PIF4 and PIL6 were increased under the same conditions ( Yamashino et al., 2003 ). Because homologous proteins tend to have similar roles, it is tempting to speculate that the uncharacterized PIL family members might also play roles in Phy-mediated light signaling.

In this report, we functionally characterized the roles of PIL5 in Phy-mediated light signaling. We showed that PIL5 localizes in the nucleus and preferentially interacts with the Pfr forms of both PhyA and PhyB. By analyzing PIL5 overexpression lines and a pil5 mutant in conjunction with phyA or phyB mutants, we showed that PIL5 is a key negative component in Phy-mediated promotion of seed germination, PhyA-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl negative gravitropism, and Phy-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. Our analyses identify PIL5 as the first phytochrome-interacting protein shown to negatively regulate seed germination and inhibition of hypocotyl negative gravitropism.

DISCUSSION

We report here that PIL5 is the first phytochrome-interacting protein that regulates seed germination and hypocotyl negative gravitropism. By analyzing pil5 mutants in conjunction with either phyA or phyB mutants and the PIL5 overexpression lines, we demonstrated that PIL5 is a negative component in various Phy-mediated light-signaling processes, including inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, promotion of seed germination, and inhibition of hypocotyl negative gravitropism.
