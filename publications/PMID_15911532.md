Here we describe a proteomic analysis of Escherichia coli in which 3,199 protein 
forms were detected, and of those 2,160 were annotated and assigned to the 
cytosol, periplasm, inner membrane, and outer membrane by biochemical 
fractionation followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass 
spectrometry. Represented within this inventory were unique and modified forms 
corresponding to 575 different ORFs that included 151 proteins whose existence 
had been predicted from hypothetical ORFs, 76 proteins of completely unknown 
function, and 222 proteins currently without location assignments in the 
Swiss-Prot Database. Of the 575 unique proteins identified, 42% were found to 
exist in multiple forms. Using DIGE, we also examined the relative changes in 
protein expression when cells were grown in the presence and absence of amino 
acids. A total of 23 different proteins were identified whose abundance changed 
significantly between the two conditions. Most of these changes were found to be 
associated with proteins involved in carbon and amino acid metabolism, 
transport, and chemotaxis. Detailed information related to all 2,160 protein 
forms (protein and gene names, accession numbers, subcellular locations, 
relative abundances, sequence coverage, molecular masses, and isoelectric 
points) can be obtained upon request in either tabular form or as interactive 
gel images.
