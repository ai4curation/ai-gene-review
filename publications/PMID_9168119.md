CD4 is a co-receptor in the cellular immune response. It increases the avidity 
of association between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell by interacting 
with non-polymorphic portions of the complex between class II major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) and T-cell receptor (TCR) molecules, and it 
contributes directly to signal transduction through its cytoplasmic association 
with the lymphocyte kinase Lck. CD4 also serves as the high-affinity receptor 
for cellular attachment and entry of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The 
extracellular portion of CD4 comprises four immunoglobulin-like domains (D1-D4). 
This part of human CD4 (residues 1-369) has been characterized as a recombinant 
soluble protein (sCD4), and crystal structures have been described for the human 
D1D2 fragment and for the rat D3D4 fragment. We have now determined the 
structures of intact sCD4 in three crystal lattices. These structures have a 
hinge-like variability at the D1D2 to D3D4 junction that might be important in 
immune recognition and HIV fusion, and a common dimeric association through D4 
domains. Dynamic light scattering measurements and chemical crosslinking of sCD4 
corroborate dimerization at high protein concentration. We suggest that such 
dimers mayhave relevance as mediators of signal transduction in T cells.
