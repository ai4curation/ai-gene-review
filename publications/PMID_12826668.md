Disabled (Dab) 1 and 2 are mammalian homologues of Drosophila DAB. Dab1 is a key 
cytoplasmic mediator in Reelin signaling that controls cell positioning in the 
developing central nervous system, whereas Dab2 is an adapter protein that plays 
a role in endocytosis. DAB family proteins possess an amino-terminal DAB 
homology (DH) domain that is similar to the phosphotyrosine 
binding/phosphotyrosine interaction (PTB/PI) domain. We have solved the 
structures of the DH domains of Dab2 (Dab2-DH) and Dab1 (Dab1-DH) in three 
different ligand forms, ligand-free Dab2-DH, the binary complex of Dab2-DH with 
the Asn-Pro-X-Tyr (NPXY) peptide of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and the 
ternary complex of Dab1-DH with the APP peptide and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 
(Ins-1,4,5-P3, the head group of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate 
(PtdIns-4,5-P2)). The similarity of these structures suggests that the rigid Dab 
DH domain maintains two independent pockets for binding of the APP/lipoprotein 
receptors and phosphoinositides. Mutagenesis confirmed the structural 
determinants specific for the NPXY sequence and PtdIns-4,5-P2 binding. NMR 
spectroscopy confirmed that the DH domain binds to Ins-1,4,5-P3 independent of 
the NPXY peptides. These findings suggest that simultaneous interaction of the 
rigid DH domain with the NPXY sequence and PtdIns-4,5-P2 plays a role in the 
attachment of Dab proteins to the APP/lipoprotein receptors and 
phosphoinositide-rich membranes.
