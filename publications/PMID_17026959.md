Polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF) is in human adipocytes mainly 
localized at the plasma membrane. This localization was under control of 
insulin, which translocated PTRF to the cytosol and nucleus, indicating a novel 
role for PTRF in insulin transcriptional control. In the plasma membrane PTRF 
was specifically bound to a triacylglycerol-metabolizing subclass of caveolae 
containing hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). In response to insulin PTRF was 
translocated to the cytosol in parallel with HSL. PTRF and HSL were 
quantitatively immunoprecipitated from the cytosol by antibodies against either 
PTRF or HSL. The findings indicate also a novel extranuclear function for PTRF 
in the control of lipolysis.
