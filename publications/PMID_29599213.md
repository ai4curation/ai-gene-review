Regulation by the integrated stress response (ISR) converges on the 
phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2 in response to a variety 
of stresses. Phosphorylation converts eIF2 from a substrate to a competitive 
inhibitor of its dedicated guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, thereby 
inhibiting translation. ISRIB, a drug-like eIF2B activator, reverses the effects 
of eIF2 phosphorylation, and in rodents it enhances cognition and corrects 
cognitive deficits after brain injury. To determine its mechanism of action, we 
solved an atomic-resolution structure of ISRIB bound in a deep cleft within 
decameric human eIF2B by cryo-electron microscopy. Formation of fully active, 
decameric eIF2B holoenzyme depended on the assembly of two identical tetrameric 
subcomplexes, and ISRIB promoted this step by cross-bridging a central symmetry 
interface. Thus, regulation of eIF2B assembly emerges as a rheostat for eIF2B 
activity that tunes translation during the ISR and that can be further modulated 
by ISRIB.

Abstract

Regulation by the integrated stress response (ISR) converges on the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2 in response to a variety of stresses. Phosphorylation converts eIF2 from substrate to competitive inhibitor of its dedicated guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, inhibiting translation. ISRIB, a drug-like eIF2B activator, reverses the effects of eIF2 phosphorylation, and enhances cognition and corrects cognitive deficits after brain injury in rodents. To determine its mechanism of action, we solved an atomic-resolution structure of ISRIB bound in a deep cleft within decameric human eIF2B by electron cryo-microscopy. Formation of fully active, decameric eIF2B holoenzyme depended on the assembly of two identical tetrameric subcomplexes, and ISRIB promoted this step by cross-bridging a central symmetry interface. Thus, regulation of eIF2B assembly emerges as a rheostat for eIF2B activity that tunes translation during the ISR and that can be further modulated by ISRIB.

Discussion

We determined the structure of human eIF2B at sufficiently high resolution to characterize the binding-site and coordination of a small molecule with therapeutic potential. The atomic model of ISRIB-bound eIF2B reconciles structure-activity-relationships described previously ( 28 , 34 ), predicted both loss- and gain-of-function mutations, and facilitates the rational design of small molecule modulators of eIF2B activity. The structure provides an intuitive view of how ISRIB activates nucleotide exchange: ISRIB stabilizes the active decameric form of the eIF2B holoenzyme by stapling the constituents together across a 2-fold symmetry axis.

Given that a catalytic residue essential for nucleotide exchange resides in the still unresolved HEAT repeat of the ε subunit, how does assembly of the decameric holoenzyme enhance activity? Crosslinking studies suggest that eIF2 binds across the decameric interface, engaging the eIF2B α subunit, and β and δ subunits from opposing tetramers ( 8 ). We surmise that decamer assembly creates a composite surface for eIF2 binding that allows the flexibly attached HEAT domain to reach and engage its target. While we consider it likely that the effects of ISRIB binding can be explained by the degree of holoenzyme assembly, additional ligand-induced allosteric changes may also contribute to its activity.

These observations provide a plausible model for ISRIB’s ability to ameliorate the inhibitory effects of eIF2α phosphorylation on ternary complex formation. ISRIB staples tetrameric building blocks together into an octamer, which enhances activity three-fold, and forms a platform for association of the dimeric α subunits. The integrated effect of these sequential steps is an order of magnitude enhancement of activity. The inhibition resulting from a limiting amount of phosphorylated eIF2 would be reduced by the surplus of GEF activity provided by ISRIB. By contrast, an excess of ISRIB poisoned the assembly reaction by saturating half-binding sites on unassembled tetramers. Thus, within its effective concentration range, ISRIB will enhance ternary complex formation even in unstressed conditions, opening an untapped reservoir of additional enzymatic capacity. We surmise that in vivo these activities are likely to be realized near the equilibrium points of the assembly reactions for the holoenzyme, allowing for ISRIB’s observed phenotypic effects. Thus, eIF2B is poised to integrate diverse signals that impact translation initiation. Phosphorylation of eIF2 may be just one of many mechanisms for modulating its activity. Post-translational modifications, expression of other modulatory components, or binding of yet-to-be-identified endogenous ligands to the ISRIB binding pocket or elsewhere are likely to modulate eIF2B activity under varying physiological conditions. Understanding the different modes of regulation of this vital translational control point will be of particular importance in the nervous system where ISRIB has been shown to have a range of effects.
