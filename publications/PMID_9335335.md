In S. cerevisiae, the chromatin structure of DNA replication origins changes as 
cells become competent for DNA replication, suggesting that G1 phase-specific 
association of replication factors with origin DNA regulates entry into S phase. 
We demonstrate that ORC, Cdc45p, and MCM proteins are components of 
prereplication complexes (pre-RC). The MCM-origin association is dependent upon 
ORC and Cdc6p. During S phase, MCM proteins and Cdc45p dissociate from origin 
DNA and associate with nonorigin DNA with similar kinetics as DNA Polymerase 
epsilon, which is present at DNA replication forks. Our results identify protein 
components of the pre-RC and a novel replication complex appearing at the G1/S 
transition (the RC), and suggest that after initiation MCM proteins and Cdc45p 
move with eukaryotic replication forks.
