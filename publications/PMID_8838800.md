Acidic epididymal glycoprotein (AEG), thus far identified only in rodents, is 
one of the sperm surface proteins involved in the fusion of the sperm and egg 
plasma membranes. In the present study, we describe the isolation and 
characterization of cDNA encoding a human glycoprotein related to AEG. Although 
this protein, designated ARP (AEG-related protein), is not the ortholog of 
rodent AEG, it resembles AEG in that it is an epididymal secretory glycoprotein 
that binds to the postacrosomal region of the sperm head. The fact that no AEG 
mRNA can be detected in the human epididymis suggests that ARP might be the 
functional counterpart of rodent AEG. The gene encoding ARP (AEGL1) was mapped 
by fluorescence in situ hybridization to 6p21.1-p21.2. This result indicates 
that AEGL1 and the mouse gene for AEG are located in the chromosomal segments 
with conserved syntenies.
