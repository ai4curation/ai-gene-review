Tuberin, the product of the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 tumor suppressor gene, 
is a phosphoprotein that negatively regulates phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase 
signaling downstream of Akt. Several high stringency 14-3-3 binding sites that 
overlapped with Akt phosphorylation sites were identified in tuberin in silico. 
Recognition of tuberin by an alpha-14-3-3 binding site-specific antibody 
correlated with mitogen-induced phosphorylation of tuberin and recognition of 
tuberin by an alpha-Akt phosphorylation substrate antibody. Recognition of 
tuberin by both antibodies was blocked by inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 
3'-kinase activity. Using a protein domain microarray, a tuberin peptide 
containing Ser(939) demonstrated phospho-specific binding to 14-3-3. Glutathione 
S-transferase pull-down assays with 14-3-3 fusion proteins revealed that all 
seven 14-3-3 isoforms (beta, gamma, zeta, epsilon, tau, eta, and sigma) could 
bind tuberin, and this interaction was abrogated by competition with 
phosphorylated but not unphosphorylated Ser(939) tuberin peptide. Tuberin also 
coimmunoprecipitated with 14-3-3, confirming the interaction between endogenous 
14-3-3 and tuberin. These data establish the presence of functional and 
overlapping 14-3-3 and Akt recognition site(s) in tuberin.
