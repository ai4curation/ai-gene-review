In Escherichia coli, the CpxR/A two-component system senses various types of 
extracytoplasmic stresses and responds by activating the expression of genes 
encoding periplasmic protein folding and trafficking factors that clear such 
stresses to ensure the organism's survival. The cpxP gene encodes a small, 
stress-combative periplasmic protein and is the most strongly induced member of 
the Cpx regulon. We demonstrate that the Cpx stress response suppresses the 
toxicity associated with two misfolded proteins derived from the P pilus of 
uropathogenic E. coli and that mutations in either cpxP or the gene for the 
periplasmic protease DegP prevent suppression by preventing the degradation of 
these proteins. Strikingly, the presence of a periplasmic misfolded protein 
substrate significantly enhances the proteolysis of CpxP by DegP. Our data 
suggest that CpxP functions as a periplasmic adaptor protein that is required 
for the effective proteolysis of a subset of misfolded substrates by the DegP 
protease.
