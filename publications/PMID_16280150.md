The conserved SIR2 protein regulates life span in both yeast and worms: in both 
organisms overexpression of SIR2 can extend life span and in Caenorhabditis 
elegans this life span extension is dependent on the forkhead transcription 
factor, DAF-16. Here, we have done extensive genetic analysis with 
sir-2.1(ok434), a null mutant of C. elegans sir-2.1, the closest homolog to 
yeast Sir2p and human SIRT1 to further elucidate its function in life span 
regulation. sir-2.1(ok434) mutants show a slight decrease in life span as well 
as sensitivity to various stresses. Our genetic analysis suggests that sir-2.1 
is required for life span extension by caloric restriction, independent of the 
insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. Importantly, analysis with unc-13 mutants 
indicates that sir-2.1 and daf-16 have overlapping and distinct roles in life 
span regulation. Our expression analysis shows that sir-2.1 has overlapping and 
distinct expression pattern compared with daf-16, consistent with the results 
from our genetic data. Our data defines a central role for C. elegans SIR2 in 
regulation of life span by caloric restriction and demonstrates that sir-2.1 and 
daf-16 have both overlapping and distinct functions in regulation of C. elegans 
life span.
