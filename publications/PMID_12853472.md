Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulators of apoptosis. Both pro-apoptotic and 
anti-apoptotic members of this family are found in mammalian cells, but only the 
pro-apoptotic protein Debcl has been characterized in Drosophila: Here we report 
that Buffy, the second Drosophila Bcl-2-like protein, is a pro-survival protein. 
Ablation of Buffy by RNA interference leads to ectopic apoptosis, whereas 
overexpression of buffy results in the inhibition of developmental programmed 
cell death and gamma irradiation-induced apoptosis. Buffy interacts genetically 
and physically with Debcl to suppress Debcl-induced cell death. Genetic 
interactions suggest that Buffy acts downstream of Rpr, Grim and Hid, and 
upstream of the apical caspase Dronc. Furthermore, overexpression of buffy 
inhibits ectopic cell death in diap1 (th(5)) mutants. Taken together these data 
suggest that Buffy can act downstream of Rpr, Grim and Hid to block 
caspase-dependent cell death. Overexpression of Buffy in the embryo results in 
inhibition of the cell cycle, consistent with a G(1)/early-S phase arrest. Our 
data suggest that Buffy is functionally similar to the mammalian pro-survival 
Bcl-2 family of proteins.
