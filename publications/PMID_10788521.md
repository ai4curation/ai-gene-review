Human DNA topoisomerase IIalpha (topo II), a ubiquitous nuclear enzyme, is 
essential for normal and neoplastic cellular proliferation and survival. Several 
common anticancer drugs exert their cytotoxic effects through interaction with 
topo II. In experimental systems, altered topo II expression has been associated 
with the appearance of drug resistance. This mechanism, however, does not 
adequately account for clinical cases of resistance to topo II-directed drugs. 
Modulation by protein-protein interactions represents one mechanism of topo II 
regulation that has not been extensively defined. Our laboratory has identified 
14-3-3epsilon as a topo II-interacting protein. In this study, glutathione 
S-transferase co-precipitation, affinity column chromatography, and 
immunoprecipitations confirm the authenticity of these interactions. Three 
assays evaluate the impact of 14-3-3epsilon on distinct topo II functional 
properties. Using both a modified alkaline comet assay and a DNA cleavage assay, 
we demonstrate that 14-3-3epsilon negatively affects the ability of the 
chemotherapeutic, etoposide, to trap topo II in cleavable complexes with DNA, 
thereby preventing DNA strand breaks. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay, 
this appears to be due to reduced DNA binding activity. The association of topo 
II with 14-3-3 proteins does not extend to all 14-3-3 isoforms. No protein 
interaction or disruption of topo II function was observed with 14-3-3final 
sigma.
