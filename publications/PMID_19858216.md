The accessory protein polymerase (pol) gammaB of the human mitochondrial DNA 
polymerase stimulates the synthetic activity of the catalytic subunit. pol 
gammaB functions by both accelerating the polymerization rate and enhancing 
polymerase-DNA interaction, thereby distinguishing itself from the accessory 
subunits of other DNA polymerases. The molecular basis for the unique functions 
of human pol gammaB lies in its dimeric structure, where the pol gammaB monomer 
proximal to pol gammaA in the holoenzyme strengthens the interaction with DNA, 
and the distal pol gammaB monomer accelerates the reaction rate. We further show 
that human pol gammaB exhibits a catalytic subunit- and substrate DNA-dependent 
dimerization. By duplicating the monomeric pol gammaB of lower eukaryotes, the 
dimeric mammalian proteins confer additional processivity to the holoenzyme 
polymerase.
