Recently, a novel M(r) 100,000 prostate-specific membrane glycoprotein (PSM) has 
been detected by the prostate-specific monoclonal antibody 7E11-C5, raised 
against the human prostatic carcinoma cell line LNCaP. The PSM antigen is 
expressed exclusively by normal and neoplastic prostate cells and metastases. We 
now report the molecular cloning of a full-length 2.65-kilobase complementary 
DNA encoding the PSM antigen from a human LNCaP complementary DNA library by 
polymerase chain reaction using degenerate oligonucleotide primers. Analysis of 
the complementary DNA sequence has revealed that a portion of the coding region, 
from nucleotide 1250 to 1700, has 54% homology to the human transferrin receptor 
mRNA. The deduced polypeptide has a putative transmembrane domain enabling the 
delineation of intra- and extracellular portions of this antigen. In contrast to 
prostate-specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase which are secreted 
proteins, PSM as an integral membrane protein may prove to be effective as a 
target for imaging and cytotoxic targeting modalities.
