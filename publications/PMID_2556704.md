Two types (I and II) of cDNAs encoding the large (A) subunit of calcineurin, a 
calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase, were isolated from human basal ganglia 
and brainstem mRNA. The complete sequences of the two calcineurin clones are 
identical except for a 54-base-pair insert in the type I clone and different 3' 
ends including part of the coding sequence for the C termini of the two 
proteins. These findings suggest that calcineurin A consists of at least two 
isozymes that may result from alternative splicing events. The two forms of the 
enzyme differ in the C terminus, which contains an inhibitory domain rapidly 
severed by limited proteolysis. With the exception of an 18-amino acid insert, 
the central parts of the molecules, which harbor the catalytic domains, are 
identical and show extended similarities with the entire catalytic subunits of 
protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, defining a distinct family of protein 
phosphatases. The 40-residue N-terminal fragment, specific for calcineurin, 
contains a sequence of 11 successive prolines that is also found in bovine brain 
calcineurin by peptide sequencing. A role in the calmodulin activation of 
calcineurin is proposed for this novel structural element.
