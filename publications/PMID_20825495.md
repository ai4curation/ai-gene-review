Cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) are required for various cell cycle 
events both in mitosis and in meiosis. During the meiotic prophase of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, only one CDK, Cdc28, which forms a complex with B-type 
cyclins, Clb5 or Clb6, promotes not only the onset of premeiotic DNA replication 
but also the formation of meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs). In this study, we 
showed that Cdc28 exhibits punctate staining on chromosomes during meiotic 
prophase I. Chromosomal localization of Cdc28, dependent on Clb5 and/or Clb6, is 
frequently observed in zygotene and pachytene, when formation of the 
synaptonemal complex (SC) occurs. Interestingly, the CDK localization is 
independent of DSB formation, but rather dependent on meiosis-specific 
chromosome components such as Red1, Hop1 and a cohesin subunit Rec8. Compromised 
CDK activity in meiotic prophase leads to defective SC formation without 
affecting DSB formation. These results suggest that CDK-dependent 
phosphorylation regulates meiotic chromosome morphogenesis.
