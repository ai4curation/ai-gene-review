CTLA-4 is a costimulation receptor that binds to the same ligands, CD80 and 
CD86, as CD28 with high affinity and is transiently expressed on the cell 
surface of activated T cells. CTLA-4 delivers an inhibitory signal through 
association of a phosphotyrosine-containing motif in the cytoplasmic domain with 
Syp tyrosine phosphatase. We now demonstrate that CTLA-4 interacts with the mu2 
subunit of the plasma membrane-associated adaptor complex, AP-2, through the 
same motif involved in the interaction with Syp, except that the interaction 
with mu2 requires unphosphorylated tyrosine. The interaction with mu2 likely 
induces rapid internalization of CTLA-4 from the cell surface. Our results 
suggest that the phosphorylation state of a single tyrosine residue determines 
whether CTLA-4 delivers a negative signal or is internalized.
