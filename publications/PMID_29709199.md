Abstract

Genomic instability in disease and its fidelity in health depend on the DNA damage response (DDR), regulated in part from the complex of meiotic recombination 11 homolog 1 (MRE11), ATP-binding cassette–ATPase (RAD50), and phosphopeptide-binding Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein 1 (NBS1). The MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 (MRN) complex forms a multifunctional DDR machine. Within its network assemblies, MRN is the core conductor for the initial and sustained responses to DNA double-strand breaks, stalled replication forks, dysfunctional telomeres, and viral DNA infection. MRN can interfere with cancer therapy and is an attractive target for precision medicine. Its conformations change the paradigm whereby kinases initiate damage sensing. Delineated results reveal kinase activation, posttranslational targeting, functional scaffolding, conformations storing binding energy and en-abling access, interactions with hub proteins such as replication protein A (RPA), and distinct networks at DNA breaks and forks. MRN biochemistry provides prototypic insights into how it initiates, implements, and regulates multifunctional responses to genomic stress.

INTRODUCTION

At the cellular level, life is constantly challenged by genotoxic stress originating from endogenous and exogenous sources, with stalled replication forks (RFs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs) being among the most deleterious and extreme forms of DNA damage. Failure to properly respond to genomic distress can be mutagenic and toxic to cells as well as fatal to the organism. Cells have therefore evolved to counteract genotoxic stress by integrating DNA repair mechanisms and cell cycle regulation through checkpoint signaling ( 1 ). In this network of DNA damage responses (DDR), the meiotic recombination 11 homolog 1 (MRE11)–DNA repair protein RAD50–Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein 1 (NBS1) (MRN) complex ( Figure 1 a , b ) holds a key position. It is among the first responders and regulates both signaling and damage responses to at least four types of extreme cellular stress: DNA damage at DSBs, stalled RFs, dysfunctional telomeres, and viral invasion. MRN also has a prime role in kinase [ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia-telangiectasia and RAD3-related (ATR)] signaling that helps orchestrate cell cycle progression and damage responses ( 2 ).

MRN functional significance in both signaling and repair is underscored by the observation that the core Mre11–Rad50 (MR) catalytic subcomplex is conserved across all domains of life, encompassing archaea (e.g., Pyrococcus furiosus ), eubacteria ( Escherichia coli SbcC/D), some phage (T4 phage gp46/47), and eukaryotes including homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosac-charomyces pombe ( 3 ). The NBS1 (Xrs2 in S. cerevisiae ) component is conserved only in eukaryotes. However, mutations in any of the genes encoding MRN components cause severe consequences in humans. Germline mutations ( Figure 1 a ) in MRE11 , NBS1 , or RAD50 cause ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T)–like disorder (ATLD), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), or NBS-like disorder ( 4 – 10 ). A-T is caused by inherited mutations in ATM kinase. Aside from germline mutations, all 3 MRN complex components are mutated in > 50 cancers, as assessed from the International Cancer Genome Consortium projects ( Figure 1 c and Supplemental Table 1 ). Furthermore, the MRN complex is frequently found absent in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer ( 11 ). MRN functional disruption may be a synthetic lethal combination with poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) inhibition ( 12 ) providing a possible strategy to target MRN-defective cancers by inhibition of PARG, whose structure is defined ( 13 ). However, upregulation of RAD50 increases cellular radioresistance, and knockdown sensitizes some cancer cells to radiation, suggesting MRN may be a target for precision medicine ( 14 ). Overall, its conservation across all domains of life coupled to the catastrophic consequences of its mutations affirms the role of the MRN complex in maintaining essential aspects of genomic stability for all cells.

In this review, we consider exemplary recent developments and paradigm-shifting results linking MRN structural biochemistry to its biology to complement and build upon prior excellent reviews ( 2 , 4 , 15 , 16 ). We integrate recent advances to delineate how MRN’s multidomain three protein composition enables its central enzymatic, sensing, signaling, architectural, and scaffolding functions in damage responses. MRN conformations are key to damage signaling through the ATM and ATR kinases, regulating the MRE11 nuclease and opening DNA for nuclease incision. By activating ATM, the MRN complex regulates phosphorylation of > 900 sites on > 700 proteins, including MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 ( 17 , 18 ). NBS1 interacts with ATM kinase plus its N-terminal phosphopeptide-interacting domains that link MRN to other partners including the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP)-interacting protein (CtIP) ( 19 , 20 ). As it directly binds NBS1, DNA, and RAD50, the MRE11 nuclease dimer is the core of the MRN complex ( 21 – 23 ). We therefore update the two-step MRE11 nuclease incision model to explain its endo- and exonuclease properties in light of recent structures, including the eukaryotic RAD50 Zn-hook and CtIP N-terminal domain. We describe factors affecting MRN functions at DSBs, stalled RFs, dysfunctional telomeres, and complexes combating exogenous viral DNA infection. We discuss how MRN acts more as a dynamic molecular machine for the expeditious formation of protein–nucleic acid functional scaffolds at DSBs, RFs, dysfunctional telomeres, and viral DNA than as part of linear pathways, as also proposed for nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) complexes ( 24 ). As a multifunctional macromolecular machine, the structural biochemistry of the MRN complex initiates sensing of stalled forks and DSBs, cell cycle checkpoint signaling cascades, incision for and commitment to break repair pathways, reestablishment of posttranslational phosphorylations via ATM kinase, and functional regulation of chromatin remodeling. The collective results outlined here suggest how MRN conformations and interactions enable both its specificity and multiple functions in cells with implications for science and biomedicine.
