Profound cellular immunodeficiency occurs as the result of mutations in proteins 
involved in both the differentiation and function of mature lymphoid cells. We 
describe here a novel human immune aberration arising from a truncation mutation 
of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25), a subunit of the tripartite 
high-affinity receptor for interleukin 2. This immunodeficiency is characterized 
by decreased numbers of peripheral T cells displaying abnormal proliferation but 
normal B cell development. Extensive lymphocytic infiltration of tissues, 
including lung, liver, gut, and bone, is observed, accompanied by tissue atrophy 
and inflammation. Although mature T cells are present, the absence of CD25 does 
affect the differentiation of thymocytes. While displaying normal development of 
CD2, CD3, CD4, and CD8 expression, CD25-deficient cortical thymocytes do not 
express CD1, and furthermore they fail to normally down-regulate levels of the 
anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2.
