MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that participate in the 
spatiotemporal regulation of messenger RNA and protein synthesis. Aberrant miRNA 
expression leads to developmental abnormalities and diseases, such as 
cardiovascular disorders and cancer; however, the stimuli and processes 
regulating miRNA biogenesis are largely unknown. The transforming growth factor 
beta (TGF-beta) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family of growth factors 
orchestrates fundamental biological processes in development and in the 
homeostasis of adult tissues, including the vasculature. Here we show that 
induction of a contractile phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by 
TGF-beta and BMPs is mediated by miR-21. miR-21 downregulates PDCD4 (programmed 
cell death 4), which in turn acts as a negative regulator of smooth muscle 
contractile genes. Surprisingly, TGF-beta and BMP signalling promotes a rapid 
increase in expression of mature miR-21 through a post-transcriptional step, 
promoting the processing of primary transcripts of miR-21 (pri-miR-21) into 
precursor miR-21 (pre-miR-21) by the DROSHA (also known as RNASEN) complex. 
TGF-beta- and BMP-specific SMAD signal transducers are recruited to pri-miR-21 
in a complex with the RNA helicase p68 (also known as DDX5), a component of the 
DROSHA microprocessor complex. The shared cofactor SMAD4 is not required for 
this process. Thus, regulation of miRNA biogenesis by ligand-specific SMAD 
proteins is critical for control of the vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype 
and potentially for SMAD4-independent responses mediated by the TGF-beta and BMP 
signalling pathways.
