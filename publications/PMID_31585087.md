Tyrosine phosphorylation regulates multi-layered signaling networks with broad 
implications in (patho)physiology, but high-throughput methods for functional 
annotation of phosphotyrosine sites are lacking. To decipher phosphotyrosine 
signaling directly in tissue samples, we developed a mass-spectrometry-based 
interaction proteomics approach. We measured the in vivo EGF-dependent signaling 
network in lung tissue quantifying >1,000 phosphotyrosine sites. To assign 
function to all EGF-regulated sites, we determined their recruited protein 
signaling complexes in lung tissue by interaction proteomics. We demonstrated 
how mutations near tyrosine residues introduce molecular switches that rewire 
cancer signaling networks, and we revealed oncogenic properties of such a lung 
cancer EGFR mutant. To demonstrate the scalability of the approach, we performed 
>1,000 phosphopeptide pulldowns and analyzed them by rapid mass spectrometric 
analysis, revealing tissue-specific differences in interactors. Our approach is 
a general strategy for functional annotation of phosphorylation sites in 
tissues, enabling in-depth mechanistic insights into oncogenic rewiring of 
signaling networks.
