INTRODUCTION

The p53 protein was first identified in simian virus 40-transformed cells as a T antigen-associated cellular protein and characterized as the first vertebrate oncogene on the basis of its sequence similarity to the cancer-causing gene of a chicken retrovirus ( 1 – 3 ). Although from the initial days of discovery p53 was related to cancer and coined a tumor suppressor gene, recent studies have delineated its role in other aspects of life, such as the development, life expectancy, and overall fitness of an organism ( 4 ). p53 is a stress-responsive transcription factor that controls genes involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair, and angiogenesis ( 5 ). Since p53 is an important regulator of cellular processes, the level of p53 is controlled by several complex mechanisms and feedback loops. Under unstressed condition, p53 remains in the hypophosphorylated form, which gets degraded by the MDM2 protein; however, in response to stress, phosphorylation of p53 occurs, resulting in inactivation of ubiquitin (Ub)-mediated degradation, which leads to rapid p53 accumulation in the nucleus, where it functions as a transcription factor.

For evading host antiviral machinery and creating a beneficial environment for viral replication and dissemination, viruses have evolved measures to target key cellular genes, such as interferon-regulatory factor3 (IRF3) ( 6 ), p53 ( 7 ), the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) ( 8 ), and NF-κB ( 9 ). By targeting p53, viruses can control an important innate immune response, namely, apoptosis, for their own advantage. There are reports of virus-induced downregulation of p53 by degradation ( 10 – 12 ), inactivation of p53 transactivation ( 13 , 14 ), as well as stabilization of p53 ( 15 – 17 ), depending on the virus type or stage of viral replication.

Rotavirus, a Reoviridae family member, is the most important etiologic agent of severe infantile (age, <5 years) nonbacterial diarrhea in humans worldwide ( 18 ). It is a nonenveloped icosahedral structured virus having 11 segments of double-stranded RNA which remain concealed by 6 structural proteins (VP1 to VP4, VP6, VP7). In addition, the virus produces 6 nonstructural proteins (NSP1 to NSP6) after infection. These mainly control the host machinery and play a vital role in establishing infection by carrying out diverse functions. Among them, NSP1, an RNA binding protein ( 18 ), has been shown to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT-mediated antiapoptotic pathway ( 19 ) as well as to inhibit innate immune responses by degradation of IRFs and RIG-I ( 20 , 21 ), resulting in efficient virus infection and replication. In addition to its ability to bind the p85 subunit of PI3K for activation of AKT, much circumstantial evidence putatively suggests that NSP1 also has ubiquitin ligase properties ( 22 , 23 ).

Ubiquitination is the main process for intracellular protein degradation in eukaryotes ( 24 ). Ubiquitin ligases recognize and bind to target proteins and label them with ubiquitin, which is recognized by the proteasomal machinery. In spite of reports on the significance of p53 during virus infection, especially in oncogenic viruses, not much is known about its role in the self-limitation of enteric viruses, such as rotavirus. In our study, we show that during initial stages of rotavirus infection, the NSP1 protein targets p53 for ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in an antiapoptotic atmosphere in the infected cell, but during late infection, the interaction between p53 and NSP1 is diminished, resulting in activation of the p53-regulated protein Bax and PUMA, leading to induction of apoptosis.

DISCUSSION

The innate immune response against virus infection is the first line of defense in vertebrates, and viruses have also developed strategies to evade the early immune response for efficient infection ( 35 , 36 ). p53 has a potential role in antiviral innate immunity, as it induces the apoptotic machinery as well as transactivates several genes which are directly involved in viral sensing, cytokine production, and inflammation ( 7 ). Similarly viruses have been shown to counteract p53, as reported in hepatitis B virus ( 37 ), Epstein-Barr virus ( 38 ), human papillomavirus ( 39 ), etc. In this study, we have shown the mechanism by which rotavirus modulates the p53 level during different stages of infection for its own advantage.

During the early stages of rotavirus infection, when replication is the principal focus of the virus, p53 downregulation was observed irrespective of the strain type ( Fig. 1A ; see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Recent studies have shown that transcription of the p53 gene depends on the interferon response ( 26 ) and during infection interferon induction is downregulated by rotaviruses ( 20 ). However, during rotavirus infection, p53 regulation seems to be an interferon-independent phenomenon, since p53 was also downregulated in rotavirus-infected Vero cells, which lack a functional interferon pathway ( Fig. 1C ).

NSP1's role in p53 downregulation was predicted when no p53 degradation was observed in A5-16 (NSP1 mutant)-infected cells ( Fig. 2A ). Moreover, in the absence of viral infection, p53 was also degraded in NSP1-overexpressing cells ( Fig. 2B ). No significant change in p53 transcript levels ( Fig. 1D ) and restoration of the p53 levels in the presence of MG132 suggested posttranslational proteasomal degradation of p53 during rotavirus infection ( Fig. 2C ). In addition to modulation of the interferon response ( 20 ), NSP1 has also been shown to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway ( 19 ). AKT has been shown to regulate the phosphorylation of MDM2, which, when activated, induces p53 degradation ( 29 ). Results revealed that the p53-modulating activity of NSP1 was independent of its PI3K/AKT activation ability, since in the presence of both PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) and MDM2 inhibitor (Nutlin-3), SA11-induced p53 degradation was observed ( Fig. 3A to D ). No effect of LY294002 on viral gene (NSP1) expression was observed ( Fig. 3A ), suggesting that it does not directly affect viral replication. In our previous study ( 19 ), the lower viral titers observed in the presence of LY294002 could be due to premature apoptosis initiation, resulting in reduced numbers of infectious viral particles.

The versatility of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in controlling cellular homeostasis through posttranslational protein modification makes it an attractive target for viruses. Viruses manipulate this system by diverse mechanisms. Baculoviruses encode their own ubiquitin ( 40 ), and modified cellular ubiquitin has also been found in poxviruses and herpes simplex viruses ( 41 ). Some viruses encode their own E3 ligase ( 42 ), and others recruit cellular E3 ligase for directing the ubiquitin system to their choice of substrate ( 43 ). E3 ligase carries out the final step of substrate binding and ubiquitinylation of it ( 44 ). Like most of the virus-encoded E3 ligases, NSP1 has a RING domain in the N terminus (amino acids 1 to 82) ( 21 ). Among the three types of ubiquitin ligases, the RING family is the largest one ( 45 ). Members of this family of ubiquitin ligases facilitate ubiquitinylation by binding charged ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) and substrate proteins simultaneously without being covalently attached to ubiquitin. NSP1 was found to coimmunoprecipitate with p53 in both cell lysates ( Fig. 4A ) and under in vitro conditions ( Fig. 4B ), and the amount of ubiquitinylation of p53 is increased in the presence of NSP1 ( Fig. 4C ), confirming the specific interaction of NSP1 with p53. Interaction of NSP1-p53 during early stages of infection ( Fig. 4D and E ) correlated with p53 degradation during early infection ( Fig. 1A ). A coimmunoprecipitation experiment with different p53 and NSP1 mutants identified interaction between the DNA binding core domain (amino acids 100 to 300) of p53 and the C-terminal domain of NSP1 (ΔRING NSP1, amino acids 83 to 482) ( Fig. 5B to E and 6C and D ). The RING domain of E3 ligases interacts not only with E2 but also sometimes with the substrate; however, in the case of NSP1, the RING domain was found to be essential for p53 degradation and ubiquitinylation ( Fig. 6E and F ) but did not interact with p53 ( Fig. 6C and D ), suggesting that full-length NSP1 is required for modulating p53 function.

p53 integrates multiple stress signals into a series of diverse antiproliferative responses; among them, the ability to activate apoptosis by transcription-dependent and -independent pathways is the most important ( 46 ). p53 transactivates several apoptotic genes ( bax , puma , bid ) ( 47 ) and activates the translocation of Bax to mitochondria ( 48 ). PUMA plays a vital role in Bax activation and initiation of apoptosis ( 49 ). Consistent with previous results, bax and puma transcripts were downregulated at the initial time points of SA11 infection, but expression was restored during the late infection ( Fig. 1D ). Similarly, increased levels of PUMA protein or translocation of Bax to mitochondria occurred during late hours (10 hpi) of SA11 or A5-13 infection ( Fig. 7A ; see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material), unlike in NSP1 mutant strain (A5-16)-infected cells, where Bax activation and PUMA upregulation occurred during early infection (2 to 4 hpi) ( Fig. 7B ). A5-16 was previously reported to poorly activate the PI3K pathway, contributing to induction of early apoptosis ( 19 ). Failure to modulate PUMA and Bax could also contribute further in early apoptosis and to the lower growth rate of A5-16 ( 28 ). However, in the presence of PI3K inhibitor, no significant effect on PUMA expression or Bax translocation was observed in either SA11- or A5-16-infected cells, suggesting no role of NSP1-mediated PI3K activation in p53-induced apoptosis during rotavirus infection ( Fig. 7C and D ). Inactivation of p53 by dominant negative p53 resulted in inhibition of rotavirus-induced PUMA upregulation or Bax translocation to mitochondria ( Fig. 8A ). This, in turn, also resulted in reduced apoptosis induction in DNp53-expressing cells either transfected with pCMV-p53 or infected with SA11 compared to that in pCMV-p53-transfected or SA11-infected cells ( Fig. 7E and 8C and D ). In the presence of NSP1 with or without PI3K/AKT inhibitor, the level of p53-stimulated apoptosis was significantly reduced compared to that in cells only overexpressing p53 (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material), suggesting the significance of NSP1 in modulation of p53-induced apoptosis during rotavirus infection. Since inhibition of apoptosis during early stages of infection is beneficial for the virus to complete its life cycle, activation of the PI3K pathway and degradation of p53 by NSP1 can be a viral strategy for inhibiting apoptosis. In our previous study, we demonstrated that NSP4 plays a crucial role in SA11-induced apoptosis, as it targets mitochondria and destabilizes it, but in the presence of NSP4 small interfering RNA, apoptosis was still observed during late infection ( 34 ), which might have been due to increased p53 levels, which in turn activate Bax, during late infection ( 50 ). Thus, control of apoptosis through a biphasic pattern of the p53 level is a highly efficient strategy for successful infection by rotavirus. Overall, the results show that NSP1 targets diverse cellular proteins to modulate host innate immune responses according to the requirement of rotavirus during different steps of infection.
