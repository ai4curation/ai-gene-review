Although activation of the AP-1-like transcription factor Pap1 in 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe is important for oxidative stress-induced gene 
expression, this activation is delayed at higher concentrations of peroxide. 
Here, we reveal that the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (2-Cys Prx) Tpx1 is required for 
the peroxide-induced activation of Pap1. Tpx1, like other eukaryotic 2-Cys Prxs, 
is highly sensitive to oxidation, which inactivates its thioredoxin peroxidase 
activity. Our data suggest that the reduced thioredoxin peroxidase-active form 
of Tpx1 is required for the peroxide-induced oxidation and nuclear accumulation 
of Pap1. Indeed, in contrast to the previously described role for Tpx1 in the 
activation of the Sty1 stress-activated protein kinase by peroxide, we find that 
both catalytic cysteines of Tpx1 are required for Pap1 activation. Moreover, 
overexpression of the conserved sulfiredoxin Srx1, which interacts with and 
reduces Tpx1, allows rapid activation of Pap1 at higher concentrations of 
H(2)O(2). Conversely, loss of Srx1 prevents the reduction of oxidized Tpx1 and 
prolongs the inhibition of Pap1 activation. Collectively, these data suggest 
that redox regulation of the thioredoxin peroxidase activity of Tpx1 acts as a 
molecular switch controlling the transcriptional response to H(2)O(2). 
Furthermore, they reveal that a single eukaryotic 2-Cys Prx regulates peroxide 
signaling by multiple independent mechanisms.
