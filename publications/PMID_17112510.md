The adaptor protein Shb has previously been shown to regulate apoptosis in 
response to cytokines and inhibitors of angiogenesis although the mechanisms 
governing these effects have remained obscure. We currently demonstrate 
interactions between Shb and c-Abl and that Shb regulates c-Abl kinase activity. 
The data suggest that c-Abl binds to tyrosine phosphorylated Shb via a concerted 
effort involving both the c-Abl SH3 and SH2 domains. The biological significance 
of the Shb/c-Abl interaction was presently tested in overexpression experiments 
and was found to promote hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death. We also show by 
Shb knockdown experiments that Shb regulates c-Abl activity and modulates cell 
death in response to the genotoxic agent cisplatin and the endoplasmic reticulum 
stress-inducer tunicamycin. The findings are in agreement with the notion of Shb 
playing a pivotal role in modulating c-Abl pro-apoptotic signaling in response 
to various stress stimuli.
