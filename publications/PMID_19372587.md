Overexpression of the ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is prevalent in 
approximately 30% of human breast cancers and confers Taxol resistance. Our 
previous work has shown that ErbB2 inhibits Taxol-induced apoptosis in breast 
cancer cells by transcriptionally up-regulating p21(Cip1). However, the 
mechanism of ErbB2-mediated p21(Cip1) up-regulation is unclear. Here, we show 
that ErbB2 up-regulates p21(Cip1) transcription through increased Src activity 
in ErbB2-overexpressing cells. Src activation further activated signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) that recognizes a SIE 
binding site on the p21(Cip1) promoter required for ErbB2-mediated p21(Cip1) 
transcriptional up-regulation. Both Src and STAT3 inhibitors restored Taxol 
sensitivity in resistant ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Our data 
suggest that ErbB2 overexpression can activate STAT3 through Src leading to 
transcriptional up-regulation of p21(Cip1) that confers Taxol resistance of 
breast cancer cells. Our study suggests a potential clinical application of Src 
and STAT3 inhibitors in Taxol sensitization of ErbB2-overexpressing breast 
cancers.
