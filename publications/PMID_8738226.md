It is well established that the intensity of the morphine-induced locomotor 
stimulatory response in rodents is genetically determined. We have evaluated the 
ability of mu (DAMGO). delta 1 (DPDPE) and delta 2 ([D-Ala2]deltorphin II; 
DT-II) selective opioid receptor agonists to inhibit receptor-activated adenylyl 
cyclase activity. Previous studies have shown that dopamine D1 receptors are 
preferentially expressed in striatonigral neurons, while adenosine A2a receptors 
are preferentially expressed in striatopallidal neurons. Our results indicate 
that in striatum of wild-type CD1 mice as in rat. mu-agonists inhibit 
D1-activated adenylyl cyclase, but were without inhibitory activity against 
A2a-activated adenylyl cyclase. In all tested mouse strains, the delta 1 
selective agonist, DPDPE, inhibited the A2a-activated adenylyl cyclase but not 
the D1-activated enzyme. In contrast, the delta 2 agonist, DT-II, inhibited both 
D1 and A2a activated enzyme in all strains except DBA/2J, where DT-II did not 
inhibit D1-activated adenylyl cyclase. In C57BL/6J mice, which are highly 
sensitive to morphine-induced motor stimulation, mu agonists were potent 
inhibitors of A2a-activated adenylyl cyclase but did not inhibit the 
D1-activated enzyme, while mu opioids did not inhibit A2a-activated enzyme in 
DBA/2J mice which show little locomotor response to morphine. In CXBK mice, a 
strain with known deficiencies in mu-receptor expression, both forms of 
receptor-activated adenylyl cyclase were less sensitive than in CD1 mice to 
inhibition by DAMGO. The results suggest probable differences in the specific 
neural locations of opioid receptor subtypes in certain inbred strains of mice 
with varying sensitivities to the behavioral effects of morphine.
