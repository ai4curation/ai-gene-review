2',3'-Dideoxyuridine (ddU) is ineffective at controlling human immunodeficiency 
virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in human T cells, because it is not 
biotransformed to the active 5'-triphosphate. The metabolic block resides in the 
poor substrate affinity of ddU for cellular nucleoside kinases. This problem 
cannot be overcome by supplying the preformed nucleotides, because such 
compounds are unable to penetrate cells. To circumvent the requirement of ddU 
for enzymic phosphorylation, we have prepared bis(pivaloyloxymethyl) 
2',3'-dideoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate (piv2 ddUMP), as a potential 
membrane-permeable prodrug of ddUMP, and investigated its metabolism and 
anti-HIV activity in two human T cell lines, one with wild-type thymidine kinase 
activity (MT-4) and the other deficient in thymidine kinase activity (CEM-tk-). 
The 5'-mono-, di-, and triphosphates of ddU were formed in both cell lines after 
exposure to piv2-ddUMP. In contrast, phosphorylated metabolites were not 
observed in cells treated with ddU or ddUMP alone. piv2-ddUMP also reduced the 
cytopathic effects of HIV-1 in MT-4 cells (ED50, 4.75 microM) and inhibited 
virus production in culture fluid (ED50, 20 microM). In addition, piv2-ddUMP 
protected CEM-tk- cells from HIV-1 infection, as demonstrated by inhibition of 
intracellular p24 antigen levels (ED50, 3 microM) and reverse transcriptase 
activity in culture medium (Ed50, 2.5 microM). Based on these findings, we 
propose that the "masked nucleotide" strategy may make available for development 
nucleoside analogues hitherto considered inactive because of failure to undergo 
biotransformation to the corresponding 5'-monophosphates. Moreover, by 
circumventing metabolic dependency on nucleoside kinases, the strategy may 
overcome acquired resistance to nucleoside analogues caused by the loss or 
depletion of nucleoside kinases.
