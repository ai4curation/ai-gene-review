Here, we describe a new mechanism of host defense that involves the nuclear 
factors associated with dsRNA (NFAR1 [90 kDa] and NFAR2 [110 kDa]), which 
constitute part of the shuttling ribonuclear protein (RNP) complex. Activation 
of the dsRNA-activated protein kinase PKR by viral RNA enabled phosphorylation 
of NFAR1 and NFAR2 on Thr 188 and Thr 315, an event found to be evolutionarily 
conserved in Xenopus. Phosphorylated NFAR1 and NFAR2 became dissociated from 
nuclear factor 45 (NF45), which was requisite for NFAR reshuttling, causing the 
NFARs to be retained on ribosomes, associate with viral transcripts, and impede 
viral replication. Cre-loxP animals with depletion of the NFARs in the thymus 
were exquisitely sensitive to the cytoplasmic replicating virus VSV (vesicular 
stomatitis virus). Thus, the NFARs constitute a novel, conserved mechanism of 
host defense used by the cell to detect and impede aberrant translation events.
