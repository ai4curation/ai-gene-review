The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) family is crucial for immune homeostasis, cell 
death and inflammation. These cytokines are recognized by members of the TNF 
receptor (TNFR) family of death receptors, including TNFR1 and TNFR2, and FAS 
and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors. Death receptor 
signalling requires death-domain-mediated homotypic/heterotypic interactions 
between the receptor and its downstream adaptors, including TNFR1-associated 
death domain protein (TRADD) and FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD). 
Here we discover that death domains in several proteins, including TRADD, FADD, 
RIPK1 and TNFR1, were directly inactivated by NleB, an enteropathogenic 
Escherichia coli (EPEC) type III secretion system effector known to inhibit host 
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling. NleB contained an unprecedented 
N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) transferase activity that specifically modified a 
conserved arginine in these death domains (Arg 235 in the TRADD death domain). 
NleB GlcNAcylation (the addition of GlcNAc onto a protein side chain) of death 
domains blocked homotypic/heterotypic death domain interactions and assembly of 
the oligomeric TNFR1 complex, thereby disrupting TNF signalling in EPEC-infected 
cells, including NF-κB signalling, apoptosis and necroptosis. Type-III-delivered 
NleB also blocked FAS ligand and TRAIL-induced cell death by preventing 
formation of a FADD-mediated death-inducing signalling complex (DISC). The 
arginine GlcNAc transferase activity of NleB was required for bacterial 
colonization in the mouse model of EPEC infection. The mechanism of action of 
NleB represents a new model by which bacteria counteract host defences, and also 
a previously unappreciated post-translational modification.
