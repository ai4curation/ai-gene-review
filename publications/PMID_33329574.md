Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is a catalytic subunit of telomerase. 
Telomerase complex plays a key role in cancer formation by telomere dependent or 
independent mechanisms. Telomere maintenance mechanisms include complex TERT 
changes such as gene amplifications, TERT structural variants, TERT promoter 
germline and somatic mutations, TERT epigenetic changes, and alternative 
lengthening of telomere. All of them are cancer specific at tissue histotype and 
at single cell level. TERT expression is regulated in tumors via multiple 
genetic and epigenetic alterations which affect telomerase activity. Telomerase 
activity via TERT expression has an impact on telomere length and can be a 
useful marker in diagnosis and prognosis of various cancers and a new therapy 
approach. In this review we want to highlight the main roles of TERT in 
different mechanisms of cancer development and regulation.
