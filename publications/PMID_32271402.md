OBJECTIVE: Osteogenic differentiation plays a crucial role in maintaining 
general bone homeostasis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) 
act as important regulators during the osteogenesis process. This study aimed to 
elucidate the mechanism of Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1 
overlapping transcript 1 (KCNQ1OT1) in osteogenic differentiation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) was conducted to detect the expression of KCNQ1OT1, osteonectin (OCN), 
osteopontin (OPN), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), miR-320a, 
mothers against DPP homolog 5 (Smad5). Protein levels of OCN, OPN, RUNX2 and 
Smad5 were measured by Western blot assay. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity 
detection assay was performed to examine the ALP activity. The interactions 
among KCNQ1OT1, miR-320a and Smad5 were determined by dual-luciferase reporter 
assay.
RESULTS: KCNQ1OT1, OCN, OPN and RUNX2 expression were enhanced in human bone 
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) treated with osteogenic medium 
(OM). KCNQ1OT1 positively regulated OCN, OPN and RUNX2 expression and ALP 
activity of hBMSCs. Furthermore, KCNQ1OT1 directly bound to miR-320a, and 
KCNQ1OT1 knockdown reduced OCN, OPN and RUNX2 expression and ALP activity by 
suppressing miR-320a expression. Moreover, Smad5 was a target of miR-320a, and 
miR-320a inhibition abated the effects of Smad5 silencing in OCN, OPN and RUNX2 
expression and ALP activity of hBMSCs. Also, KCNQ1OT1 knockdown reduced OCN, OPN 
and RUNX2 expression by targeting miR-320a/Smad5 axis.
CONCLUSIONS: KCNQ1OT1 promoted osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs by 
regulating Smad5 expression via sponging miR-320a.
