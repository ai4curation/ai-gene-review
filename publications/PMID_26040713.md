During telophase, the nuclear envelope (NE) reforms around daughter nuclei to 
ensure proper segregation of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents. NE reformation 
requires the coating of chromatin by membrane derived from the endoplasmic 
reticulum, and a subsequent annular fusion step to ensure that the formed 
envelope is sealed. How annular fusion is accomplished is unknown, but it is 
thought to involve the p97 AAA-ATPase complex and bears a topological 
equivalence to the membrane fusion event that occurs during the abscission phase 
of cytokinesis. Here we show that the endosomal sorting complex required for 
transport-III (ESCRT-III) machinery localizes to sites of annular fusion in the 
forming NE in human cells, and is necessary for proper post-mitotic 
nucleo-cytoplasmic compartmentalization. The ESCRT-III component charged 
multivesicular body protein 2A (CHMP2A) is directed to the forming NE through 
binding to CHMP4B, and provides an activity essential for NE reformation. 
Localization also requires the p97 complex member ubiquitin fusion and 
degradation 1 (UFD1). Our results describe a novel role for the ESCRT machinery 
in cell division and demonstrate a conservation of the machineries involved in 
topologically equivalent mitotic membrane remodelling events.

## Full Text

The ESCRT-III complex performs a topologically unique membrane fusion, allowing release of enveloped retroviruses during viral budding, intraluminal vesicles during multivesicular body biogenesis, and daughter cells during the abscission phase of cytokinesis7-11. We found that as well as localising to the midbody during late cytokinesis, endogenous ESCRT-III components CHMP2A and CHMP2B encircled the forming daughter nuclei during telophase (Figure 1A, 1B and Extended Data Figure 1A). CHMP2A localisation was sensitive to CHMP2A-targeting siRNA (Extended Data Figure 1B) and was not continuous; rather we found that CHMP2A adopted a transient punctate localisation around the decondensing nuclei during telophase (Extended Data Figure 1C, Supplementary Video 1). By scoring localisation in HeLa cells stably expressing mCh-tubulin, (cell cycle of 21.5 ± 1.7 hours, n = 93), we estimate the duration of CHMP2A localisation to be 96 ± 8.9 seconds. We found cells expressing GFP-CHMP4B12 also displayed a transient, punctate, juxta-nuclear localisation during telophase with recruitment of GFP-CHMP4B lasting 225 ± 66 seconds (n = 8, ± S.D.) and individual puncta lasting 75 ± 46 seconds (n = 92, ± S.D., Extended Data Figure 1D, Supplementary Video 2). Telophase ESCRT-III localisation was observed in other cell lines, including human-diploid fibroblasts (Extended Data Figure 1E). Using HeLa cells stably expressing a Yellow Fluorescence Protein (YFP)-tagged nuclear envelope marker (Lamin Associated Protein 2β, YFP-LAP2β)13, we determined that the juxtanuclear localisation corresponded to the forming nuclear envelope. Here, we observed colocalisation with the Lamin B Receptor (LBR)14 (Figure 1C) and demonstrated that CHMP2A localisation occurred prior to appreciable formation of a nuclear lamina or nuclear pore complexes (Extended Data Figure 1F and 1G). Whilst mitotic chromatin association of ESCRT-III has been previously reported15, its function remains unknown. To investigate the role of ESCRT-components at the NE, we employed siRNA to deplete these proteins16. As described previously17, depletion of ESCRT-components produced aberrant nuclei and these defects phenocopied those produced by depletion of proteins required for NE reformation (Extended Data Figure 1H)18. NE-reformation is thought to be a two-phase process, separable into membrane fusion events that create an expanding reticular network with subsequent annular fusion of holes within this network to create a sealed barrier1. We next employed correlative light-electron microscopy (Extended Data Figure 2A-D) to examine telophase ESCRT-III NE-localisation. We found that at the stage of ESCRT-III recruitment, the NE had incompletely formed (Figure 1D). Two populations of CHMP2A-positive membranes were found. Firstly, isolated CHMP2A-decorated vesicles were observed in the cytoplasm, proximal to the forming NE (5.7 ± 4.2 % of total cellular gold, Extended Data Figure 2Ei). Secondly, CHMP2A-decorated double-membrane sheets were observed to coat the chromatin (51 ± 1.7 % of total cellular gold was within 100 nm of the NE). On these sheets, CHMP2A localised to discrete regions, with intact NE being devoid of label, but with CHMP2A preferentially (Extended Data Figure 2H) decorating nucleo-cytoplasmic channels (mean diameter 38.4 ± 12.5 nm (n = 2 ± S.E.M., from 17 determinations)) between the forming double membranes of the NE (Figure 1D, Extended Data Figure 2D-2G, Extended Data Figure 3A-D, Supplementary Videos 3 and 4). These channels must be resolved through annular fusion and given the observed localisation and topological equivalence with cytokinetic abscission (Figure 1E), we speculated that ESCRT-III might be involved in this process.

Requirements for CHMP2A localisation to the telophase NE were revealed through depletion of partner ESCRT-proteins, with CHMP4B and CHMP3, as for other ESCRT-dependent membrane remodeling events, playing a major role in this recruitment (Figure 2A). We employed siRNA-resistant FLAG-tagged CHMP2A expressed at near-endogenous levels to report localisation in the presence of CHMP2A siRNA (Figure 2B and 2C). Through introduction of mutations targeting known binding-partners, we found, as for midbody recruitment and cytokinetic abscission (Extended Data Figure 4A and 4B), and consistent with the previously determined telophase localisation of GFP-CHMP4B (Extended Data Figure 1D), that whilst CHMP2AR-FLAG localised to the forming NE, disrupting interaction with CHMP4 proteins by mutation of Arg24, Arg27 and Arg31 to Ala (CHMP2AR-FLAG RRR-AAA)16 abolished this localisation. Mutation of the N-terminal CHMP2A α0 helix19, or residues involved in the interaction with VPS416 had no effect on NE localisation (Figure 2C, Extended Data Figure 4A). These data indicate that CHMP2A is recruited to the forming NE through classical assembly of the ESCRT-III complex.

The p97 AAA-ATPase controls both phases of NE reformation; in concert with its adaptor protein p47, it regulates membrane delivery and NE expansion whilst through its adaptors Nuclear Protein Like 4 (NPL4) and UFD1 it regulates annular fusion6. Through NPL4 and UFD1, the p97 complex extracts ubiquitinated Aurora-B, a Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) component, from chromatin to allow chromatin decondensation and membranation20,21. Given our observed ESCRT-III localisation (Figure 1) and known interactions of ESCRT-III components with the CPC13, we screened the ESCRT-machinery for interaction with the p97 complex by yeast 2-hybrid assay (Extended Data Figure 5A-D). We found that CHMP2A bound specifically to UFD1 and confirmed this interaction by direct-binding and co-precipitation assays (Figure 3A, 3B and Extended Data Figure 5E-H). We mapped the interaction with CHMP2A to the C-terminus of UFD1 (Extended Data Figure 5F and 5G) and found that truncation of the C-terminus of CHMP2A, or removal of the autoinhibitory helix (α5), prevented interaction with UFD1 (Figure 3A). We employed siRNA targeting UFD1 (Extended Data Figure 6A); although its partner protein, p97, was required for EGFR degradation22, we found cells depleted for UFD1 degraded EGFR normally (Extended Data Figure 6B), allowed release of HIV-1 based lentivirus (Extended Data Figure 6C), and as previously reported21, completed cytokinesis normally (Extended Data Figure 6D). However, whilst cells depleted for UFD1 recruited CHMP2A to the midbody (Figure 3D), recruitment of CHMP2A to the forming NE was impaired (Figure 3C and 3D).

To examine mitotic roles for ESCRT-III in NE reformation, we imaged synchronised cultures of cells stably expressing Histone 2B-mCherry (H2B-mCh) and YFP-LAP2β and quantified the time taken to enclose the chromatin with YFP-LAP2β positive nuclear envelope. We were surprised to find that cells lacking ESCRT-III, but not UFD1, enclosed their chromatin faster than control cells (Extended Data Figure 7A-C). To explore the integrity of the nascent NE in CHMP2A depleted cells, we followed a protocol similar to that recently described23 and imaged synchronised cultures of HeLa cells stably expressing both H2B-mCh and GFP-tagged β-Galactosidase (β-Gal) fused to the nuclear localisation signal (NLS) from Simian Virus 40 (GFP-NLS-βGal)24. GFP-NLS-βGal is released from the nucleus upon NE breakdown at mitotic onset and returned upon formation of transport-competent nuclear pores during NE reformation (Extended Data Figure 8A and 8B). We found that the rate of GFP-NLS-βGal return to the nucleus was slower in ESCRT-III-depleted cells (Figure 4A-C), despite the cells having enclosed their chromatin with NE membranes faster (Extended Data Figure 7A). Whilst nuclei were frequently malformed in ESCRT-III-depleted cells (Extended Data Figure 1H17), incorporation of nuclear pore complexes and import machineries were normal (Extended Data Figure 8C-8E). However, in CHMP2A-, CHMP3- or UFD1-depleted cells, the post-mitotic nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning of GFP-NLS-βGal was reduced (Figure 4B and 4C, Extended Data Figure 9A and 9B), indicating that NE integrity was compromised by treatments that prevent ESCRT-III assembly at the NE. Results were confirmed with a second reporter (GFP-NLS) (Extended Data Figure 9C) and we demonstrated that nuclear retention of this probe was defective in post-mitotic ESCRT-III depleted cells (Extended Data Figure 9D and 9E). Using correlative live-cell electron tomography, we found that CHMP2A depletion resulted in the persistence of unsealed holes in the post-mitotic NE (Figure 4D and 4E and Extended Data Figure 10A and 10B). Paralleling CHMP2 requirements in lentiviral release and cytokinetic abscission (Extended Data Figure 6C, and Extended Data Figure 9F), depletion of CHMP2B had minimal effect upon NE integrity (Extended Data Figure 9A and 9B), whilst co-depletion of CHMP2A and CHMP2B disrupted NE integrity to a greater extent than CHMP2A depletion alone (Figure 4B). NE integrity could be rescued by stable expression of siRNA-resistant CHMP2A-FLAG (CHMP2AR-FLAG), but, as with CHMP2A requirements in cytokinesis (Extended Data Figure 4B) and HIV-1 release16, not by expression of CHMP2AR-FLAG RRR-AAA (Figure 4F and 4G). We describe a novel localisation and function of ESCRT-III in NE remodeling at sites of annular fusion, a process strikingly similar to classical ESCRT-III mediated membrane remodeling (Extended Data Figure 10C). Localisation is governed by classical ESCRT-III assembly mechanisms and also requires UFD1. An equivalent ESCRT-III-dependent membrane remodeling at the NE may allow viruses or megaRNPs to traverse this membrane25-27 and in yeast, ESCRT-III has recently been shown to participate in surveillance and extraction of defective nucleoporins at the IMN28 indicating additional ESCRT-III activities on this membrane may exist throughout the cell cycle. ESCRT-III is thus involved in regulating the quality of the NE and gene expansion within the ESCRT-machinery may have resulted from an evolutionary drive to accommodate open mitoses.
