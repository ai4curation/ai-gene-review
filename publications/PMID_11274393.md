The yeast cytosol contains multiple homologs of the DnaK and DnaJ chaperone 
family. Our current understanding of which homologs functionally interact is 
incomplete. Zuotin is a DnaJ homolog bound to the yeast ribosome. We have now 
identified the DnaK homolog Ssz1p/Pdr13p as zuotin's partner chaperone. Zuotin 
and Ssz1p form a ribosome-associated complex (RAC) that is bound to the ribosome 
via the zuotin subunit. RAC is unique among the eukaryotic DnaK-DnaJ systems, as 
the 1:1 complex is stable, even in the presence of ATP or ADP. In vitro, RAC 
stimulates the translocation of a ribosome-bound mitochondrial precursor protein 
into mitochondria, providing evidence for its chaperone-like effect on nascent 
chains. In agreement with the existence of a functional complex, deletion of 
each RAC subunit resulted in a similar phenotype in vivo. However, 
overexpression of zuotin partly rescued the growth defect of the Delta ssz1 
strain, whereas overexpression of Ssz1p did not affect the Delta zuo1 strain, 
suggesting a pivotal function for the DnaJ homolog.
