Stress induced by accumulation of unfolded proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) is a classic feature of secretory cells and is observed in many tissues in 
human diseases including cancer, diabetes, obesity, and neurodegeneration. 
Cellular adaptation to ER stress is achieved by the activation of the unfolded 
protein response (UPR), an integrated signal transduction pathway that transmits 
information about the protein folding status at the ER to the nucleus and 
cytosol to restore ER homeostasis. Inositol-requiring transmembrane 
kinase/endonuclease-1 (IRE1α), the most conserved UPR stress sensor, functions 
as an endoribonuclease that processes the mRNA of the transcription factor X-box 
binding protein-1 (XBP1). IRE1α signaling is a highly regulated process, 
controlled by the formation of a dynamic scaffold onto which many regulatory 
components assemble, here referred to as the UPRosome. Here we provide an 
overview of the signaling and regulatory mechanisms underlying IRE1α function 
and discuss the emerging role of the UPR in adaptation to protein folding stress 
in specialized secretory cells and in pathological conditions associated with 
alterations in ER homeostasis.
