Fused Toes (FTS) is a member of a small group of inactive variant E2 
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme domain-containing proteins of unknown function. 
Through proteomic analysis of FTS complexes purified from human embryonic kidney 
293T cells, we identified a new multiprotein complex, the FHF complex, 
containing FTS, members of the microtubule-binding Hook family of coiled-coil 
proteins (Hook1, Hook2, and Hook3), and a previously uncharacterized 107-kDa 
protein, FTS and Hook Interacting Protein (FHIP). FTS associated with a 
conserved C-terminal motif in Hook proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system and 
in tissue culture cells, and Hook proteins were found to form homo- and 
heterodimers. The approximately 500-kDa FHF complex contained all three Hook 
proteins, and small interfering RNA depletion experiments suggest that Hook 
proteins can interact interchangeably within this complex. Hook proteins as well 
as FTS interact with members of both the class B and class C components of the 
homotypic vesicular protein sorting (HOPS) complex. Depletion of FTS by RNA 
interference affects both the trafficking of epidermal growth factor from 
early-to-late endosome/lysosomes and the efficiency by which overexpression of 
the HOPS component Vps18 promotes clustering of lysosomal-associated membrane 
protein 1-positive endosome/lysosomes. These data suggest that the FTS/Hook/FHIP 
complex functions to promote vesicle trafficking and/or fusion via the HOPS 
complex.
