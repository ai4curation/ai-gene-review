The Sir2 protein is an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase that is required for 
silencing at the silent mating-type loci, telomeres, and the ribosomal DNA 
(rDNA). Mutations in the NAD(+) salvage gene NPT1 weaken all three forms of 
silencing and also cause a reduction in the intracellular NAD(+) level. We now 
show that mutation of a highly conserved histidine residue in Npt1p results in a 
silencing defect, indicating that Npt1p enzymatic activity is required for 
silencing. Deletion of another NAD(+) salvage pathway gene called PNC1 caused a 
less severe silencing defect and did not significantly reduce the intracellular 
NAD(+) concentration. However, silencing in the absence of PNC1 was completely 
dependent on the import of nicotinic acid from the growth medium. Deletion of a 
gene in the de novo NAD(+) synthesis pathway BNA1 resulted in a significant rDNA 
silencing defect only on medium deficient in nicotinic acid, an NAD(+) 
precursor. By immunofluorescence microscopy, Myc-tagged Bna1p was localized 
throughout the whole cell in an asynchronously growing population. In contrast, 
Myc-tagged Npt1p was highly concentrated in the nucleus in approximately 40% of 
the cells, indicating that NAD(+) salvage occurs in the nucleus in a significant 
fraction of cells. We propose a model in which two components of the NAD(+) 
salvage pathway, Pnc1p and Npt1p, function together in recycling the nuclear 
nicotinamide generated by Sir2p deacetylase activity back into NAD(+).
