Bleeding complications are a significant clinical problem in patients with 
myelodysplastic syndromes even at sufficient platelet counts (>50,000/μl). 
However, the underlying pathology of this hemorrhagic diathesis is still 
unknown. Here, we analyzed the platelet proteome of patients with 
myelodysplastic syndromes by quantitative two-dimensional difference gel 
electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometric protein identification. Proteins 
identified with lower concentrations, such as Talin-1, Vinculin, Myosin-9, 
Filmain-A, and Actin play critical roles in integrin αIIbβ3 signaling and thus 
platelet aggregation. Despite normal agonist receptor expression, calcium flux, 
and granule release upon activation, the activation capacity of integrin αIIbβ3 
was diminished in myelodysplastic syndrome platelets. Förster resonance energy 
transfer analysis showed a reduced co-localization of Talin-1 to the integrin's 
β3-subunit, which is required for receptor activation and fibrinogen binding. In 
addition, platelet spreading on immobilized fibrinogen was incomplete, and 
platelet aggregation assays confirmed a general defect in integrin-dependent 
platelet aggregation in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Our data 
provide novel aspects on the molecular pathology of impaired platelet function 
in myelodysplastic syndromes and suggest a mechanism of defective integrin 
αIIbβ3 signaling that may contribute to the hemorrhagic diathesis observed in 
these patients.

Abstract

Bleeding complications are a significant clinical problem in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes even at sufficient platelet counts (>50,000/μl). However, the underlying pathology of this hemorrhagic diathesis is still unknown. Here, we analyzed the platelet proteome of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes by quantitative two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometric protein identification. Proteins identified with lower concentrations, such as Talin-1, Vinculin, Myosin-9, Filmain-A, and Actin play critical roles in integrin α IIb β 3 signaling and thus platelet aggregation. Despite normal agonist receptor expression, calcium flux, and granule release upon activation, the activation capacity of integrin α IIb β 3 was diminished in myelodysplastic syndrome platelets. Förster resonance energy transfer analysis showed a reduced co-localization of Talin-1 to the integrin's β 3 -subunit, which is required for receptor activation and fibrinogen binding. In addition, platelet spreading on immobilized fibrinogen was incomplete, and platelet aggregation assays confirmed a general defect in integrin-dependent platelet aggregation in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Our data provide novel aspects on the molecular pathology of impaired platelet function in myelodysplastic syndromes and suggest a mechanism of defective integrin α IIb β 3 signaling that may contribute to the hemorrhagic diathesis observed in these patients.

DISCUSSION

Platelet count-independent hemorrhages are a significant clinical problem in patients with MDS ( 3 , 4 ). The presence of a functional platelet defect may aggravate bleeding complications in patients with low platelet counts and in general increase the complication rate during invasive procedures in MDS patients. So far, it has not been elucidated if abnormal hemostasis in MDS is systematic and if it follows a common platelet-intrinsic pathology.

Once platelets have been shed from megakaryocytes, they already contain most of the proteins required for their function. Therefore, quantitative platelet proteome analysis is an ideal tool to uncover platelet-intrinsic defects that may contribute to functional platelet defects. Our analysis of the MDS and healthy platelet proteomes revealed that the majority of proteins with different concentrations showed lower levels in MDS. This suggested that functional platelet defects in MDS may result from inadequate levels of proteins critical for platelet function. This hypothesis was further supported by our pathway/network analysis that showed that the majority of these lower concentrated proteins are essential for integrin signaling. Proper function of integrin α IIb β 3 is critical for platelet aggregation and hemostasis ( 13 , 23 ). Among the proteins with lower levels in MDS were TAlin-1 and Kindlin-3, both binding to the β 3 -subunit of integrin α IIb β 3 , which is referred to as the common final step necessary for integrin activation ( 14 – 16 , 24 – 31 ). The proteins of the kindlin family and Talin-1 also establish major links between the β 3 -subunit and the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton, which is necessary for initiation of subsequent platelet spreading ( 26 , 27 ). Both of these signaling pathways are absolutely required for platelet function, and consistently, lack of Talin-1 or Kindlin-3 in platelets has been shown to abrogate integrin α IIb β 3 activation with loss of platelet spreading and aggregation in vivo ( 12 , 13 , 24 ). The reduced expression of these two proteins and their central role in integrin activation pointed toward abnormal integrin α IIb β 3 function in MDS. While surface receptor expression and early activation (calcium flux and granule release) did not differ between MDS and normal platelets, the integrin inside-out signaling upon activation was markedly reduced in MDS. Consequently, platelet spreading on immobilized fibrinogen was almost abolished in patients with MDS. Besides activation of integrin α IIb β 3 , the ability to spread on immobilized fibrinogen requires the presence of Vinculin and cytoskeletal proteins such as Filamin-A, Actin, and Myosin-9, which were also expressed lower in MDS platelets. It has been shown that loss of Vinculin decreases cytoskeletal mechanics and spreading capacities ( 31 , 32 ), and Filamin-A is responsible for the organization of F-actin into bundles and networks and the linkage of transmembrane receptors to the cytoskeleton ( 33 , 34 ). The reduced expression of the major cytoskeletal proteins Actin and Myosin-9 also aggravates the poor spreading performance ( 35 ). This may explain why the spreading defect observed in MDS platelets was more severe than suggested solely by the incomplete integrin α IIb β 3 activation. Inside-out and thus Talin-1- or Kindlin-3-independent integrin α IIb β 3 functions such as adhesion to fibrinogen ( 36 ) or receptor activation following Mn 2+ stimulation ( 37 ) remain intact in MDS platelets, pointing toward a specific integrin α IIb β 3 activation deficit in MDS originating from the reduced expression of essential signaling proteins such as Talin-1, Kindlin-3, Vinculin, Filamin-A, and Actin. With respect to their functional phenotype, MDS platelets mimic the platelet phenotype of conditional Talin-1 or Kindlin-3 knockout mice ( 12 , 13 , 24 ).

From a functional perspective, the impaired bidirectional integrin α IIb β 3 signaling in MDS suggests a general defect in integrin-dependent platelet aggregation. In line with this assumption, we found considerably decreased aggregation in response to the integrin-dependent agonists arachidonic acid and collagen when compared with normal donor platelets. We also found a diminished aggregation in response to ADP, although not as severe as against the other two. This could be due to ADP's two P2Y receptors, of which only one is dependent on Chloride intracellular channel protein 1 (Clic1) that we found 3-fold down-regulated in MDS platelets. The absence of Clic1 was recently found to induce a lower ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation in mice that is dependent on the P2Y 12 but not the P2Y 1 receptor ( 38 ). We also detected a reduced response to ristocetin, which is independent of integrin α IIb β 3 function as it initiates platelet agglutination rather than aggregation ( 39 ). The reduced response to ristocetin observed in MDS patients might be explained by the lower levels of the cytoskeletal protein Myosin-9 as patients with inherited disorders involving the corresponding MYH9 gene locus also present with a similarly reduced platelet aggregation capacity in response to ristocetin ( 40 ), as well as giant platelets ( 18 , 41 ). The Myosin-9 deficiency in MDS platelets may have conceivably contributed to the increased mean platelet volume (>11 fl), a common phenomenon in MDS referred to as “giant” or “balloon-like” platelets ( 17 ), observed in the majority of MDS patients examined here. We observed the described effects consistently in patients with platelet counts ranging between 19,000 and 734,000/μl, whereas the aggregation defect positively correlated with platelet count, World Health Organization subtype, IPSS, and signs of bleeding. Although in our statistical analysis a lower platelet count (<157,000/μl) had the highest influence on the aggregation capacity, the average platelet count (89,000/μl) did not suggest aggregation defects in these patients thus indicating the existence of a functional defect.
