Modulation of ribosomal assembly is a fine tuning mechanism for cell number and 
organ size control. Many ribosomal proteins undergo post-translational 
modification, but their exact roles remain elusive. Here, we report that 
ribosomal protein s10 (RPS10) is a novel substrate of an oncoprotein, 
protein-arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). We show that PRMT5 interacts with 
RPS10 and catalyzes its methylation at the Arg(158) and Arg(160) residues. The 
methylation of RPS10 at Arg(158) and Arg(160) plays a role in the proper 
assembly of ribosomes, protein synthesis, and optimal cell proliferation. The 
RPS10-R158K/R160K mutant is not efficiently assembled into ribosomes and is 
unstable and prone to degradation by the proteasomal pathway. In nucleoli, RPS10 
interacts with nucleophosmin/B23 and is predominantly concentrated in the 
granular component region, which is required for ribosome assembly. The RPS10 
methylation mutant interacts weakly with nucleophosmin/B23 and fails to 
concentrate in the granular component region. Our results suggest that PRMT5 is 
likely to regulate cell proliferation through the methylation of ribosome 
proteins, and thus reveal a novel mechanism for PRMT5 in tumorigenesis.
