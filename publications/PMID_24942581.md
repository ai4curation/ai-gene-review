A unique aspect of human monocytes, compared to monocytes from many other 
species, is that they express the CD4 molecule. However, the role of the CD4 
molecule in human monocyte development and function is not known. We determined 
that the activation of CD4 via interaction with major histocompatibility complex 
class II (MHC-II) triggers cytokine expression and the differentiation of human 
monocytes into functional mature macrophages. Importantly, we determined that 
CD4 activation induces intracellular signaling in monocytes and that inhibition 
of the MAPK and Src family kinase pathways blocked the ability of CD4 ligation 
to trigger macrophage differentiation. We observed that ligation of CD4 by 
MHC-II on activated endothelial cells induced CD4-mediated macrophage 
differentiation of blood monocytes. Finally, CD4 ligation by MHC-II increases 
the susceptibility of blood-derived monocytes to HIV binding and subsequent 
infection. Altogether, our studies have identified a novel function for the CD4 
molecule on peripheral monocytes and suggest that a unique set of events that 
lead to innate immune activation differ between humans and mice. Further, these 
events can have effects on HIV infection and persistence in the macrophage 
compartment.
IMPORTANCE: The CD4 molecule, as the primary receptor for HIV, plays an 
important role in HIV pathogenesis. There are many cell types that express CD4 
other than the primary HIV target, the CD4(+) T cell. Other than allowing HIV 
infection, the role of the CD4 molecule on human monocytes or macrophages is not 
known. We were interested in determining the role of CD4 in human 
monocyte/macrophage development and function and the potential effects of this 
on HIV infection. We identified a role for the CD4 molecule in triggering the 
activation and development of a monocyte into a macrophage following its 
ligation. Activation of the monocyte through the CD4 molecule in this manner 
increases the ability of monocytes to bind to and become infected with HIV. Our 
studies have identified a novel function for the CD4 molecule on peripheral 
monocytes in triggering macrophage development that has direct consequences for 
HIV infection.
