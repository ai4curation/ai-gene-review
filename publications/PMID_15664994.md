The Janus kinase (Jak)-Stat pathway plays an essential role in cytokine 
signaling. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) promotes granulopoiesis 
and granulocytic differentiation, and Stat3 is the principle Stat protein 
activated by G-CSF. Upon treatment with G-CSF, the interleukin-3-dependent cell 
line 32D clone 3(32Dcl3) differentiates into neutrophils, and 32Dcl3 cells 
expressing dominant-negative Stat3 (32Dcl3/DNStat3) proliferate in G-CSF without 
differentiation. Gene expression profile and quantitative PCR analysis of 
G-CSF-stimulated cell lines revealed that the expression of C/EBPalpha was 
up-regulated by the activation of Stat3. In addition, activated Stat3 bound to 
CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)alpha, leading to the enhancement of the 
transcription activity of C/EBPalpha. Conditional expression of C/EBPalpha in 
32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells after G-CSF stimulation abolishes the G-CSF-dependent cell 
proliferation and induces granulocytic differentiation. Although 
granulocyte-specific genes, such as the G-CSF receptor, lysozyme M, and 
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin precursor (NGAL) are regulated by 
Stat3, only NGAL was induced by the restoration of C/EBPalpha after stimulation 
with G-CSF in 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells. These results show that one of the major 
roles of Stat3 in the G-CSF signaling pathway is to augment the function of 
C/EBPalpha, which is essential for myeloid differentiation. Additionally, 
cooperation of C/EBPalpha with other Stat3-activated proteins are required for 
the induction of some G-CSF responsive genes including lysozyme M and the G-CSF 
receptor.
