Ap3A is a platelet-dense granule component released into the extracellular space 
during the second wave of platelet aggregation on activation. Here, we identify 
an uncharacterized enzyme, nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-4 
(NPP4), as a potent hydrolase of Ap3A capable of stimulating platelet 
aggregation and secretion. We demonstrate that NPP4 is present on the surface of 
vascular endothelium, where it hydrolyzes Ap3A into AMP and ADP, and Ap4A into 
AMP and ATP. Platelet aggregation assays with citrated platelet-rich plasma 
reveal that the primary and secondary waves of aggregation and dense granule 
release are strongly induced by nanomolar NPP4 in a concentration-dependent 
manner in the presence of Ap3A, while Ap3A alone initiates a primary wave of 
aggregation followed by rapid disaggregation. NPP2 and an active site NPP4 
mutant, neither of which appreciably hydrolyzes Ap3A, have no effect on platelet 
aggregation and secretion. Finally, by using ADP receptor blockade we confirm 
that NPP4 mediates platelet aggregation via release of ADP from Ap3A and 
activation of ADP receptors. Collectively, these studies define the biologic and 
enzymatic basis for NPP4 and Ap3A activity in platelet aggregation in vitro and 
suggest that NPP4 promotes hemostasis in vivo by augmenting ADP-mediated 
platelet aggregation at the site of vascular injury.

Abstract

Ap3A is a platelet-dense granule component released into the extracellular space during the second wave of platelet aggregation on activation. Here, we identify an uncharacterized enzyme, nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-4 (NPP4), as a potent hydrolase of Ap3A capable of stimulating platelet aggregation and secretion. We demonstrate that NPP4 is present on the surface of vascular endothelium, where it hydrolyzes Ap3A into AMP and ADP, and Ap4A into AMP and ATP. Platelet aggregation assays with citrated platelet-rich plasma reveal that the primary and secondary waves of aggregation and dense granule release are strongly induced by nanomolar NPP4 in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of Ap3A, while Ap3A alone initiates a primary wave of aggregation followed by rapid disaggregation. NPP2 and an active site NPP4 mutant, neither of which appreciably hydrolyzes Ap3A, have no effect on platelet aggregation and secretion. Finally, by using ADP receptor blockade we confirm that NPP4 mediates platelet aggregation via release of ADP from Ap3A and activation of ADP receptors. Collectively, these studies define the biologic and enzymatic basis for NPP4 and Ap3A activity in platelet aggregation in vitro and suggest that NPP4 promotes hemostasis in vivo by augmenting ADP-mediated platelet aggregation at the site of vascular injury.

Introduction

The formation of a platelet-rich thrombus stabilized by fibrin crosslinking is the final common pathway for arterial thrombosis, the most common disease process affecting adults in the United States. The first step in thrombus formation consists of platelet adhesion to the exposed subendothelial extracellular matrix at the site of vascular injury. Here, circulating blood platelets bind collagen via their GPVI receptors, and bind von Willebrand factor via GPIb, triggering inside-out activation of other surface integrins and the release of platelet granule contents into the extracellular space. 1 The release of preformed molecules stored in platelet-dense granules such as ADP, serotonin, and ionized calcium, then amplifies the clotting reaction beyond the platelet monolayer bound on the collagen surface to circulating platelets in the immediate vicinity of the damaged endothelium. This amplification is further augmented by the secretion of thromboxane A2. ADP binding to purinergic receptors on the platelet surface (P2Y1 and P2Y12) induces rapid calcium influx and mobilization resulting in platelet shape change, activation, and partial degranulation thus promoting platelet aggregation. On granule release, local ADP concentrations are estimated to exceed 500μM, but ADP is quickly metabolized by ectoenzymes on the surface of endothelial cells (such as CD39 2 , 3 ) and soluble phosphohydrolyases in blood plasma which attenuate the prothrombotic response. 4 – 7 To sustain the clotting reaction, a slow and steady source of ADP at the site of the growing thrombus is required. Another preformed chemical released by platelet-dense granules at high concentrations, diadenosine triphosphate (Ap3A), has an ill-defined role in thrombus formation but has been suggested to provide a source of long-lasting ADP at the site of vascular injury.

Ap3A is stored within platelet granules at high concentrations (∼20-30mM) and is released with ADP and ATP into the blood during thrombin-induced platelet aggregation at concentrations thought to range between 40 and 100μM 8 (see supplemental Table 1 and additional references summarizing platelet-dense granule components and their concentrations before and after degranulation; available on the Blood Web site, see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article). Turbidometric studies in citrated platelet-rich plasma (PRP) demonstrate that 10-20μM Ap3A induces weak platelet aggregation in a slow but persistent manner. 9 The mechanism by which Ap3A promotes aggregation suggests that Ap3A is stored as a metabolically inactive or chemically masked molecule, which on release into the extracellular space is converted into a hemodynamically active form by an enzyme that liberates ADP from the dinucleotide. An enzyme capable of hydrolyzing Ap3A into AMP and ADP was partially characterized on the surface of intact porcine 10 and bovine 11 vascular endothelial cells more than 20 years ago. Before this, Luthje and Olgilvie linked weak Ap3A hydrolase activity in PRP to an extracellular glycoprotein, neither stored within nor released by platelets, with optimal enzymatic activity around pH 8.5 to 9.0, and a divalent cation dependence. 12 The inability to further characterize and purify the enzyme impeded direct experimentation of the enzyme's effect on platelet activation and aggregation.

The human ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (ENPP or NPP) family consists of 7 extracellular, glycosylated proteins (NPP1-7) that hydrolyze phosphodiester bonds. NPPs are cell-surface enzymes, with the exception of NPP2, which is exported to the plasma membrane but cleaved by furin and released into the extracellular fluid. 13 A subset of the family (NPP1-3) can recognize 5′ nucleotide-containing substrates and, approximately 10 years ago, was also reported to hydrolyze diadenosine polyphosphates, including Ap3A and Ap4A, into AMP and related products. 14 In that study, the activity of NPP1 and NPP3 was measured by purifying membrane fractions of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with the enzymes, while the soluble form of NPP2 was prepared from vaccinia virus lysate of BS-C-1 cells. The investigators reported that all NPPs tested hydrolyzed Ap3A with comparable rates and Michaelis constants (Km) in the low μM range. 14

The effects of NPP enzymes on hemostasis and coagulation have never been directly demonstrated. In addition, the uncertainty regarding the precise role of NPPs in thrombosis has led to their inclusion alongside ADP-metabolizing enzymes (such as CD39) in some studies, 15 , 16 giving the impression that their enzymatic activities are associated with antithrombotic effects resulting from ADP metabolism. While previous reports of enzymatic activity of NPP1-3 suggest that these enzyme isoforms are candidates for the intravascular hydrolysis of diadenosine polyphosphates, a review of the literature suggests that NPP2, NPP4, and NPP5 have the strongest evidence for an intravascular location. 17 Homology modeling reveals the active sites of NPP4 and NPP1 to be quite similar, making NPP4 a prime candidate for Ap3A hydrolysis within blood vessels. Accordingly, NPP4 and NPP2 are reasonable starting points to investigate the role of the NPP family in hemostasis resulting from diadenosine polyphosphate metabolism. To define this role, we expressed and purified soluble, recombinant extracellular domains of human NPP2 and NPP4, characterized their enzymatic activities with substrates Ap3A and Ap4A (also released by dense granules), confirmed the intravascular location of NPP4 by immunofluorescence, and performed turbidometric analysis to directly determine the effects of NPPs on the aggregation of PRP. Our findings demonstrate that NPP4 is a prothrombotic intravascular enzyme stimulating platelet aggregation through the sustained hydrolysis of Ap3A into ADP at the site of the nascent thrombus.

Discussion

Here, we demonstrate that NPP4, a previously uncharacterized member of the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family, is localized on the vascular walls of blood vessels within the brain and activates platelet degranulation and aggregation at nM concentrations through the liberation of ADP from Ap3A. Ap3A is a chemical stored in abundance in platelet-dense granules that achieves ≈ 100μM extracellular concentrations in the vicinity of platelet activation on platelet degranulation. Our identification of NPP4 as a slow hydrolyzing Ap3A enzyme comes many years after the presence of such an entity in the circulatory system was first hypothesized by Luthje and Olgilvie. 9 The researchers subsequently detected an enzyme with Ap3A and Ap4A hydrolytic activity on the surface of bovine vascular endothelium 11 contemporaneously with a second group who discovered an Ap3A hydrolase on porcine vascular endothelium. 10 Our search of the NCBI-GEO database also revealed NPP4 gene expression in a variety of human vascular endothelial cells.

Diadenosine polyphosphates have been identified as potential substrates for the NPP family of enzymes. 14 A collaborative group of researchers partially purified membrane fractions of CHO cells stably transfected with NPP1, NPP2, or NPP3 to probe their activity with Ap3A, and all were observed to hydrolyze Ap3A with K m s in the low μM range. Our studies investigated NPP family members suggested by the literature to be present in vascular cells 17 , 29 —NPP2 and NPP4—and used a baculovirus expression system to produce soluble, easily purified proteins. In contrast to previous reports, we have seen no evidence that NPP2 is capable of hydrolyzing Ap3A either by steady state enzymatic studies (data not shown) or biologic assays with PRP ( Figure 5 C). In addition, our Michaelis constant of NPP4 binding to Ap3A is much weaker than previously reported for NPP1 and NPP3, 800μM compared with 5-50μM. Some of the discrepancies may be attributable to differences in protein purity between recombinant soluble enzymes and CHO cell membrane preparations, different solution conditions, or the rapid enzymatic removal of NPP4 reaction products on cellular surfaces reducing the effects of product inhibition. However, the differences in the K m 's between NPP4 and NPP1/NPP3 may reflect true intrinsic differences in the affinity of NPP family members for dinucleotide polyphosphate substrates. Our results indicate that NPP4 is an intravascular enzyme with a physiologic role in hemostasis while NPP2 has no discernable role in platelet aggregation or Ap3A metabolism. In light of our findings, we believe that despite high-sequence homologies with NPP4, additional experiments are necessary before implicating NPP1 and NPP3 in hemostasis and Ap3A metabolism.

The hydrolysis of Ap3A in the blood has been noted to occur slowly relative to that of ADP. 10 , 11 , 30 , 31 ADP released during platelet degranulation stimulates further platelet aggregation and release, and thus the process is autocatalytic. To prevent unregulated thrombus formation, ADP is rapidly degraded—1μM ADP is degraded in whole blood within 3.2 minutes, and may be even faster in vivo because of ectoenzymes present on cell surfaces. 6 , 31 The degradation of diadenosine polyphosphates by bovine endothelium is noted to be at least an order of magnitude slower than the degradation of ADP, and because of product inhibition of the Ap3A hydrolase, the effect is expected to be even more pronounced at high nucleotide concentrations. 11 In light of the kinetics of NPP4 hydrolysis, Ap3A would provide a sustained source of low-level ADP in the microenvironment of platelet degranulation, which would extend the half-life of platelet activation and thereby promote thrombus formation. It is noteworthy that just ≈ 2μM ADP will trigger platelet aggregation and granule release.

Our observation that NPP4 augments the platelet aggregation response to Ap3A suggests that generation of ADP via hydrolysis of Ap3A is the mechanism by which this occurs. In addition, we demonstrate that NPP4/Ap3A-induced platelet aggregation is markedly inhibited by inclusion of an ADP receptor blockade ( Figure 5 A-B), providing further evidence for an ADP-dependent mechanism. Importantly, we show that these ADP-receptor inhibitors do not significantly impact NPP4 activity ( Figure 5 C).

ADP stimulates platelet shape change, aggregation, and secretion via activation of platelet surface receptors P2Y1 and P2Y12 that are coupled to intracellular G proteins through which their signals are mediated. P2Y1 couples to Gq and mediates influx of Ca 2+ , platelet shape change and transient aggregation, while P2Y12 receptors couple to Gi family members and mediate inhibition of adenyl cyclase activity and augmentation of platelet aggregation. Optimal platelet aggregation requires activation of both ADP receptors (reviewed in Offermanns, 32 Gachet, 33 and Kahner et al 34 ). One consequence of exposure to ADP is the release of arachidonic acid (AA) from platelet membrane phospholipids. AA is subsequently converted to TXA2 via a pathway involving cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and requiring the activation of both ADP receptors. 35 This pathway is inhibited by aspirin, an effective antiplatelet agent, especially in the setting of cardiovascular disease. Our studies herein demonstrate that NPP4 augments ADP-mediated pathways of platelet aggregation, raising the possibility that NPP4 may be able to overcome some of the effects of COX-1 inhibition of platelet aggregation. We are pursing aggregometry studies on platelets from patients treated with aspirin in the presence and absence of NPP4 to test this hypothesis.

Our findings may have relevant clinical implications for both improving hemostasis and inhibiting thrombosis. First, NPP4 may represent a novel target for antithrombotic therapy as an adjunct to antiplatelet agents. Second, NPP4 enzyme replacement therapy to augment prolonged low-level ADP production and platelet aggregation at the site of vascular injury might provide an alternative to platelet transfusions in bleeding patients with qualitative platelet dysfunction (eg, because of NSAIDs or congenital storage pool disorders) by improving platelet function. Finally, the demonstration that NPP4 is a vascular endothelial cell ectoenzyme with proaggregatory effects invites the hypothesis that mutant forms or deficiencies of the enzyme may exist that could be responsible for a mild bleeding diathesis in individuals with mucosal platelet-type bleeding manifestations for which no platelet or von Willebrand factor abnormalities can be identified. Although speculative, it will be of interest to determine whether individuals with such disorders carry mutations in the gene encoding NPP4 or produce NPP4 that becomes detached from the membrane. If so, techniques to assay for these possibilities could potentially be exploited for clinical laboratory test development.
