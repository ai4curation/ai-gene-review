Coats define the composition of carriers budding from organelles. In addition, 
coats interact with membrane tethers required for vesicular fusion. The yeast 
AP-3 (Adaptor Protein Complex 3) coat and the class C Vps/HOPS (HOmotypic fusion 
and Protein Sorting) tether follow this model as their interaction occurs at the 
carrier fusion step. Here we show that mammalian Vps class C/HOPS subunits and 
clathrin interact and that acute perturbation of clathrin function disrupts the 
endosomal distribution of Vps class C/HOPS tethers in HEK293T and polarized 
neuronal cells. Vps class C/HOPS subunits and clathrin exist in complex with 
either AP-3 or hepatocyte growth factor receptor substrate (Hrs). Moreover, Vps 
class C/HOPS proteins cofractionate with clathrin-coated vesicles, which are 
devoid of Hrs. Expression of FK506 binding protein (FKBP)-clathrin light chain 
chimeras, to inhibit clathrin membrane association dynamics, increased Vps class 
C/HOPS subunit content in rab5 endosomal compartments. Additionally, Vps class 
C/HOPS subunits were concentrated at tips of neuronal processes, and their 
delivery was impaired by expression of FKBP-clathrin chimeras and AP20187 
incubation. These data support a model in which Vps class C/HOPS subunits 
incorporate into clathrin-coated endosomal domains and carriers in mammalian 
cells. We propose that vesicular (AP-3) and nonvesicular (Hrs) clathrin 
mechanisms segregate class C Vps/HOPS tethers to organelles and domains of 
mammalian cells bearing complex architectures.
