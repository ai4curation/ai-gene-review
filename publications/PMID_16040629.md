An activated form of beta-catenin [Catnb(Delta(ex3))] was expressed in 
respiratory epithelial cells of the developing lung. Although morphogenesis was 
not altered at birth, air space enlargement and epithelial cell dysplasia were 
observed in the early postnatal period and persisted into adulthood. The 
Catnb(Delta(ex3)) protein caused squamous, cuboidal, and goblet cell dysplasia 
in intrapulmonary conducting airways. Atypical epithelial cells that stained for 
surfactant pro protein C (pro-SP-C) and had morphological characteristics of 
alveolar type II cells were observed in bronchioles of the transgenic mice. 
Catnb(Delta(ex3)) inhibited expression of Foxa2 and caused goblet cell 
hyperplasia associated with increased staining for mucins and the MUC5A/C 
protein. In vitro, both wild type and activated beta-catenin negatively 
regulated the expression of the Foxa2 promoter. Catnb(Delta(ex3)) also caused 
pulmonary tumors in adult mice. Activation of beta-catenin caused ectopic 
differentiation of alveolar type II-like cells in conducting airways, goblet 
cell hyperplasia, and air space enlargement, demonstrating a critical role for 
the Wnt/beta-catenin signal transduction pathway in the differentiation of the 
respiratory epithelium in the postnatal lung.
