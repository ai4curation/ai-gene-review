Interaction of thrombospondin with resting and stimulated human platelets.

Wolff R, Plow EF, Ginsberg MH.

The interaction of isolated and radioiodinated thrombospondin with washed human 
platelets has been characterized. The ligand bound to nonstimulated and 
thrombin-stimulated platelets in a time-dependent manner, and apparent steady 
state was reached within 25 min. Binding was not due to iodination of the ligand 
and was inhibited by nonlabeled thrombospondin but not by unrelated proteins, 
and bound ligand was identical with thrombospondin in terms of subunit 
structure. Nonlinear curve-fitting analyses of binding to resting platelets 
suggested the presence of a single class of sites which bound 3,100 +/- 1,000 
molecules/platelet with an apparent Kd of 50 +/- 20 nM. This interaction was not 
attributable to contaminating cells or inadvertant platelet activation. Binding 
to thrombin-stimulated platelets had a lower apparent affinity (Kd = 250 +/- 100 
nM) and higher apparent capacity (35,600 +/- 9,600 molecules/platelet). 
Thrombin-enhanced binding was dependent upon agonist dose and platelet 
stimulation. Fibrinogen, a monoclonal antibody to GPIIb-IIIa, temperature, and 
divalent ions had differential effects upon thrombospondin binding to resting 
and stimulated platelets, suggesting the presence of two distinct mechanisms of 
thrombospondin binding to platelets. While thrombospondin binding to 
thrombin-stimulated platelets occurs with characteristics similar to those 
observed for fibrinogen, fibronectin, and von Willebrand Factor, its high 
affinity interaction with resting platelets is unique to this adhesive 
glycoprotein.
