The actin-binding proteins, nebulette, and nebulin, are comprised of a 
four-domain layout containing an acidic N-terminal region, a repeat domain, a 
serine-rich-linker region, and a Src homology-3 domain. Both proteins contain 
homologous N-terminal regions that are predicted to be in different environments 
within the sarcomere. The nebulin acidic N-terminal region is found at the 
distal ends of the thin filaments. Nebulette, however, is predicted to extend 
150 nm from the center of the Z-line. To dissect out the functions of the 
N-terminal domain of nebulette, we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screen 
using nebulette residues 1-86 as bait. We have identified filamin-C, ZASP-1, and 
tropomyosin-1 as binding partners. Characterization of the nebulette-filamin 
interaction indicates that filamin-C predominantly interacts with the modules. 
These data suggest that filamin-C, a known component of striated muscle Z-lines, 
interacts with nebulette modules.
