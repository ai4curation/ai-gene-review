The proteome profile of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) generated in response to heat 
shock stress was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), wherein we 
identified a FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerse (PPIases), SlyD, as a 
stress-responsive (i.e. aggregation-resistant) protein. Even under an imposed 
severe stress condition where 29 out of 858 soluble proteins were totally 
eliminated and the synthesis levels of 171 proteins decreased over 5-fold, a 
3.37-fold increase induced by heat shock treatment was observed in the synthesis 
level of SlyD compared with a non-stress condition. As a fusion partner, as well 
as solubility enhancer, SlyD facilitated folding and significantly increased the 
solubility of many aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in E. coli cytoplasm. 
SlyD was very effective in sequestering interactive surfaces of heterologous 
proteins associated with non-specific protein-protein interactions and the 
formation of inclusion bodies, most likely as a result of intrinsic folding 
efficiencies and/or chaperone-like activities. SlyD was also shown to be 
suitable for the production of a biologically active fusion mutant of 
Pseudomonas putida cutinase that is of considerable biotechnological and 
commercial interest.
