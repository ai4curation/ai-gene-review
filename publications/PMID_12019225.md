Body length in C. elegans is regulated by a member of the TGFbeta family, DBL-1. 
Loss-of-function mutations in dbl-1, or in genes encoding components of the 
signaling pathway it activates, cause worms to be shorter than wild type and 
slightly thinner (Sma). Overexpression of dbl-1 confers the Lon phenotype 
characterized by an increase in body length. We show here that loss-of-function 
mutations in dbl-1 and lon-1, respectively, cause a decrease or increase in the 
ploidy of nuclei in the hypodermal syncytial cell, hyp7. To learn more about the 
regulation of body length in C. elegans we carried out a genetic screen for new 
mutations causing a Lon phenotype. We report here the cloning and 
characterization of lon-3. lon-3 is shown to encode a putative cuticle collagen 
that is expressed in hypodermal cells. We show that, whereas putative null 
mutations in lon-3 (or reduction of lon-3 activity by RNAi) causes a Lon 
phenotype, increasing lon-3 gene copy number causes a marked reduction in body 
length. Morphometric analyses indicate that the lon-3 loss-of-function phenotype 
resembles that caused by overexpression of dbl-1. Furthermore, phenotypes caused 
by defects in dbl-1 or lon-3 expression are in both cases suppressed by a null 
mutation in sqt-1, a second cuticle collagen gene. However, whereas loss of 
dbl-1 activity causes a reduction in hypodermal endoreduplication, the reduction 
in body length associated with overexpression of lon-3 occurs in the absence of 
defects in hypodermal ploidy.
