Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that regulate the functions of histones 
as well as nonhistones by catalyzing the removal of acetyl groups from lysine 
residues. HDACs regulate many biological processes, including the cell division 
cycle and tumorigenesis. Although recent studies have implicated HDAC8 in tumor 
cell proliferation, the molecular mechanisms linking HDAC8 to cell growth remain 
unknown. Here, we report that the human ortholog of the yeast ever-shorter 
telomeres 1B (EST1B) binds HDAC8. This interaction is regulated by protein 
kinase A-mediated HDAC8 phosphorylation and protects human EST1B (hEST1B) from 
ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Phosphorylated HDAC8 preferentially recruits 
Hsp70 to a complex that inhibits the CHIP (C-terminal heat shock protein 
interacting protein) E3 ligase-mediated degradation of hEST1B. Importantly, 
HDAC8 regulation of hEST1B protein stability modulates total telomerase 
enzymatic activity. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which HDAC8 
contributes to tumorigenesis by regulating telomerase activity.
