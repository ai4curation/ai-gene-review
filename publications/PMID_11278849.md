Degeneration of neurons in Alzheimer's disease is mediated by beta-amyloid 
peptide by diverse mechanisms, which include a putative apoptotic component 
stimulated by unidentified signaling events. This report describes a novel 
beta-amyloid peptide-binding protein (denoted BBP) containing a G 
protein-coupling module. BBP is one member of a family of three proteins 
containing this conserved structure. The BBP subtype bound human beta-amyloid 
peptide in vitro with high affinity and specificity. Expression of BBP in cell 
culture induced caspase-dependent vulnerability to beta-amyloid peptide 
toxicity. Expression of a signaling-deficient dominant negative BBP mutant 
suppressed sensitivity of human Ntera-2 neurons to beta-amyloid peptide mediated 
toxicity. These findings suggest that BBP is a target of neurotoxic beta-amyloid 
peptide and provide new insight into the molecular pathophysiology of 
Alzheimer's disease.
