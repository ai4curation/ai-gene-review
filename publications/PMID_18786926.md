The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein is a 
multifunctional protein with a well characterized role in the Wnt signal 
transduction pathway and in cytoskeletal regulation. The SAMP repeats region of 
APC, an Axin-binding site, is known to be important for tumor suppression and 
for the developmental function of APC. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screening 
using the first SAMP motif-containing region of Xenopus APC as bait and obtained 
several SAMP binding candidates including DDEF2 (development and differentiation 
enhancing factor 2), which is an ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) GTPase-activating 
protein (GAP (ArfGAP)) involved in the regulation of focal adhesions. In vitro 
and in cells the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of DDEF2 and its close homolog, 
DDEF1, are associated with the SAMP motif of APC competitively with Axin1. 
Moreover, NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments revealed that the SAMP 
motif interacts at the same surface of the SH3 domain of DDEF as the known SH3 
binding motif, PXXP. When fluorescent protein-tagged APC and DDEF are expressed 
in Xenopus A6 cells, co-localization at microtubule ends is observed. 
Overexpression and RNA interference experiments indicate that APC and DDEFs 
cooperatively regulate the distributions of microtubules and focal adhesions. 
Our findings reveal that the SAMP motif of APC specifically binds to the SH3 
domains of DDEFs, providing new insights into the functions of APC in cell 
migration.
