The replicative DNA helicases can unwind DNA in the absence of polymerase 
activity in vitro. In contrast, replicative unwinding is coupled with DNA 
synthesis in vivo. The temperature-sensitive yeast polymerase alpha/primase 
mutants cdc17-1, pri2-1 and pri1-m4, which fail to execute the early step of DNA 
replication, have been used to investigate the interaction between replicative 
unwinding and DNA synthesis in vivo. We report that some of the plasmid 
molecules in these mutant strains became extensively negatively supercoiled when 
DNA synthesis is prevented. In contrast, additional negative supercoiling was 
not detected during formation of DNA initiation complex or hydroxyurea 
replication fork arrest. Together, these results indicate that the extensive 
negative supercoiling of DNA is a result of replicative unwinding, which is not 
followed by DNA synthesis. The limited number of unwound plasmid molecules and 
synthetic lethality of polymerase alpha or primase with checkpoint mutants 
suggest a checkpoint regulation of the replicative unwinding. In concordance 
with this suggestion, we found that the Tof1/Csm3/Mrc1 checkpoint complex 
interacts directly with the MCM helicase during both replication fork 
progression and when the replication fork is stalled.
