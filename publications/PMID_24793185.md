OBJECTIVE: Because the extracellular matrix protein agrin is essential for 
neuromuscular junction formation and maintenance, we tested the hypothesis that 
autoantibodies against agrin are present in sera from patients with myasthenia 
gravis (MG).
METHODS: We determined the presence of anti-agrin antibodies in 54 sera from 
patients with generalized MG using a solid-phase ELISA with purified mini-agrin 
protein. Thirty of the 54 sera were seronegative for antibodies against the 
acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK), 15 had 
elevated levels of anti-MuSK, and 9 had elevated levels of anti-AChR 
autoantibodies. Sixteen sera from healthy volunteers served as control.
RESULTS: Five sera with elevated levels of anti-agrin antibodies were 
identified. The concentration of the antibodies ranged between 0.04 and 0.12 nM. 
Four of the 5 agrin-positive sera were also positive for anti-MuSK, one was 
positive for anti-AChR, and 2 had elevated levels of anti-low-density 
lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) autoantibodies. Some of the sera 
stained adult mouse neuromuscular junctions and reacted with native mini-agrin 
expressed in 293HEK cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence for agrin as a novel target protein 
for autoantibodies in patients with MG. Anti-agrin antibodies were always 
detected in combination with autoantibodies against MuSK, LRP4, or AChRs, 
indicating a high incidence of autoantibodies against several neuromuscular 
proteins in the agrin-positive MG cases.
