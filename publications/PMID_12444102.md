Mutations in the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene with the resultant loss of 
expression of the NF2 tumor suppressor schwannomin are one of the most common 
causes of benign human brain tumors, including schwannomas and meningiomas. 
Previously we demonstrated that the hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine 
kinase substrate (HRS) strongly interacts with schwannomin. HRS is a powerful 
regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase trafficking to the degradation pathway and 
HRS also binds STAM. Both of these actions for HRS potentially inhibit STAT 
activation. Therefore, we hypothesized that schwannomin inhibits STAT activation 
through interaction with HRS. We now show that both schwannomin and HRS inhibit 
Stat3 activation and that schwannomin suppresses Stat3 activation mediated by 
IGF-I treatment in the human schwannoma cell line STS26T. We also find that 
schwannomin inhibits Stat3 and Stat5 phosphorylation in the rat schwannoma cell 
line RT4. Schwannomin with the pathogenic missense mutation Q538P fails to bind 
HRS and does not inhibit Stat5 phosphorylation. These data are consistent with 
the hypothesis that schwannomin requires HRS interaction to be fully 
functionally active and to inhibit STAT activation.
