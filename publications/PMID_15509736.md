The Notch and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathways both regulate cell fate 
specification during mammalian neural development. We have shown previously that 
Notch1 activation in the murine forebrain promotes radial glial identity. This 
result, together with recent evidence that radial glia can be progenitors, 
suggested that Notch1 signaling might promote progenitor and radial glial 
character simultaneously. Consistent with this idea, we found that in addition 
to promoting radial glial character in vivo, activated Notch1 (ActN1) increased 
the frequency of embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) ganglionic eminence (GE) progenitors 
that grew into neurospheres in FGF2. Constitutive activation of C-promoter 
binding factor (CBF1), a Notch pathway effector, also increased neurosphere 
frequency in FGF2, suggesting that the effect of Notch1 on FGF responsiveness is 
mediated by CBF1. The observation that ActN1 promoted FGF responsiveness in 
telencephalic progenitors prompted us to examine the effect of FGF pathway 
activation in vivo. We focused on FGFR2 because it is expressed in radial glia 
in the GEs where ActN1 increases FGF2 neurosphere frequency, but not in the 
septum where it does not. Like ActN1, activated FGFR2 (ActFGFR2) promoted radial 
glial character in vivo. However, unlike ActN1, ActFGFR2 did not enhance 
neurosphere frequency at E14.5. Additional analysis demonstrated that, 
unexpectedly, neither ActFGFR2 nor ActFGFR1 could replace the need for ligand in 
promoting neurosphere proliferation. This study suggests that telencephalic 
progenitors with radial glial morphology are maintained by interactions between 
the Notch and FGF pathways, and that the mechanisms by which FGF signaling 
promotes radial glial character in vivo and progenitor proliferation in vitro 
can be uncoupled.
