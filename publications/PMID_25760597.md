Hikeshi is a nuclear transport receptor required for cell survival after stress. 
It mediates heat-shock-induced nuclear import of 70 kDa heat-shock proteins 
(Hsp70s) through interactions with FG-nucleoporins (FG-Nups), which are proteins 
in nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Here, the crystal structure of human Hikeshi 
is presented at 1.8 Å resolution. Hikeshi forms an asymmetric homodimer that is 
responsible for the interaction with Hsp70s. The asymmetry of Hikeshi arises 
from the distinct conformation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) and the 
flexibility of the linker regions of each monomer. Structure-guided mutational 
analyses showed that both the flexible linker region and the CTD are important 
for nuclear import of Hsp70. Pull-down assays revealed that only full-length 
Hsp70s can interact with Hikeshi. The N-terminal domain (NTD) consists of a 
jelly-roll/β-sandwich fold structure which contains hydrophobic pockets involved 
in FG-Nup recognition. A unique extended loop (E-loop) in the NTD is likely to 
regulate the interactions of Hikeshi with FG-Nups. The crystal structure of 
Hikeshi explains how Hikeshi participates in the regulation of nuclear import 
through the recognition of FG-Nups and which part of Hikeshi affects its binding 
to Hsp70. This study is the first to yield structural insight into this highly 
unique import receptor.
