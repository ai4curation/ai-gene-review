The 31-kDa integral membrane protein stomatin (protein 7.2b) is not only an 
important component of the red cell membrane but can also be found in abundance 
in different tissues and cell lines. The protein is thought to be anchored to 
the membrane by a hydrophobic domain while both N and C termini are exposed to 
the cytoplasm. We have previously shown in the human cell line UAC that stomatin 
concentrates preferentially in plasma membrane folds and protrusions. There is 
also evidence that stomatin is linked to the cortical actin cytoskeleton, 
suggesting a role in cortical morphogenesis of the cell. In this study, we 
demonstrate that the fundamental structure of stomatin is oligomeric. Whereas 
interaction of stomatin with itself was suggested by cross-linking experiments, 
we show by density gradient centrifugation analysis that soluble homo-oligomeric 
complexes of this protein are present in Triton X-100 extracts of UAC cells. We 
also show the existence of these oligomers by co-immunoprecipitation of the 
endogenous stomatin and a recombinantly expressed myc-tagged stomatin, using an 
anti-myc antibody. The data indicate that these complexes comprise between 9 and 
12 monomers of stomatin. Two C-terminally truncated forms of stomatin do not 
incorporate into these oligomers, suggesting an involvement of the C terminus in 
the homo-oligomeric interaction.
