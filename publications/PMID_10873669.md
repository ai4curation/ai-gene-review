Cadherin is a well-known cell-cell adhesion molecule, and it binds to 
beta-catenin, which in turn binds to alpha-catenin. However, little is known 
about the regulatory mechanism underlying the cadherin-mediated cell-cell 
adhesion. Here we purified two novel beta-catenin-interacting proteins with 
molecular masses of 180 kDa (p180) and 150 kDa (p150) from bovine brain cytosol 
by using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-beta-catenin affinity column 
chromatography. Mass spectral analysis revealed p180 to be identical to KIAA0313 
which has a putative Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain and 
p150 to be the same as KIAA0705 which has a high degree of sequence similarity 
to the synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM), which binds beta-catenin and 
KIAA0313 in the yeast two-hybrid system and overlay assay, respectively (Ide et 
al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 256, 456-461, 1999; Ohtsuka et al., Biochem. 
Biophys. Res. Commun. 265, 38-44, 1999). beta-Catenin was coimmunoprecipitated 
with KIAA0313 in Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCKII) cells, bovine brain 
cytosol, and EL cells. KIAA0313 and beta-catenin were partly colocalized at 
sites of cell-cell contact in MDCKII cells. Taken together, our data suggest 
that KIAA0313 associates with beta-catenin through KIAA0705 in vivo at sites of 
cell-cell contact.
