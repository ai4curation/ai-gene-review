PURPOSE: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a genetically heterogeneous group of 
retinal degenerative disorders characterized by the loss of rod and cone 
photoreceptors, leading to visual impairment and blindness. To date, to our 
knowledge, X-linked RP has been associated with variants in 3 genes (RPGR, RP2, 
and OFD1), whereas genetic defects at 3 loci (RP6, RP24, and RP34) are yet 
unidentified. The aim of this study was to identify a novel candidate gene 
underlying X-linked RP.
METHODS: Participants were identified from cohorts of genetically unsolved male 
individuals affected by RP, who underwent genome sequencing, exome sequencing, 
or candidate gene screening via direct Sanger sequencing at 3 referral centers. 
Specifically, 2 probands were identified at the National Reference Centre for 
Rare Retinal Diseases (Paris, France), 2 at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear 
Hospital (Boston, MA), and 1 at the National Reference Centre for Inherited 
Sensory Diseases (Montpellier, France). The pathogenicity of the identified 
variants was assessed using bioinformatic predictions, protein expression 
analyses, and mitochondrial function assays.
RESULTS: We identified 4 rare single-nucleotide variants in IDH3G (HGNC:5386), 
located at the RP34 locus on the X chromosome, and a complete gene deletion, in 
5 unrelated male individuals affected with nonsyndromic RP. The variants 
segregated with the phenotype in all available family members. In all cases, the 
disease severity was intermediate. None had high myopia. IDH3G encodes the γ 
subunit of mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH3), an enzyme involved in 
the citric acid cycle, which is expressed in the inner segments of 
photoreceptors. Variants in IDH3A and IDH3B, encoding the other subunits of 
IDH3, have already been associated with nonsyndromic autosomal recessive RP. 
Bioinformatic predictions and functional assays support a pathogenic role for 
the variants identified in this study, possibly through partial loss of 
enzymatic activity and mitochondrial function.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that variants in IDH3G are a novel cause of 
X-linked RP.
