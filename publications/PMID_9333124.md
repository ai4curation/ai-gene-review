We investigated the cellular and humoral interactions between peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and human osteoblasts, leading to apoptosis of 
osteoblasts. Human osteoblastic cell line MG63 and human primary osteoblast-like 
cells obtained from biopsy specimens were used in this study. PBMCs were 
isolated from healthy donors and cultured with or without stimulation by 
recombinant interleukin-2 followed by 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate with 
ionomycin. Fas was functionally expressed on MG63 and primary osteoblast-like 
cells. Activated PBMCs expressed Fas ligand (FasL) strongly on their surface and 
killed MG63 and primary osteoblast-like cells. Cultured supernatants of 
activated PBMCs also induced apoptotic cell death of MG63 and primary 
osteoblast-like cells. In contrast, both unstimulated PBMCs and cultured 
supernatants of unstimulated PBMCs did not induce apoptosis of these cells. 
Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect and induction of apoptosis against MG63 and 
primary osteoblast-like cells by activated PBMCs and cultured supernatants were 
inhibited significantly by human Fas chimeric protein. Our data showed that 
human osteoblasts expressed Fas fuctionally and both membrane-type and soluble 
form FasL from activated PBMCs induced apoptosis of these cells, providing the 
one possible mechanism of bone loss in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis.
