Abstract

In Wnt-stimulated cells, β-catenin becomes stabilized in the cytoplasm, enters the nucleus and interacts with HMG box transcription factors of the lymphoid-enhancing factor-1 (LEF-1)/T-cell factor (TCF) family, thereby stimulating the transcription of specific target genes. We recently identified Pontin52 as a nuclear protein interacting with β-catenin and the TATA-box binding protein (TBP), suggesting its involvement in regulating β-catenin-mediated transactivation. Here, we report the identification of Reptin52 as an interacting partner of Pontin52. Highly homologous to Pontin52, Reptin52 likewise binds β-catenin and TBP. Using reporter gene assays, we show that the two proteins antagonistically influence the transactivation potential of the β-catenin–TCF complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate the evolutionary conservation of this mechanism in Drosophila . dpontin and dreptin are essential genes that act antagonistically in the control of Wingless signalling in vivo. These results indicate that the opposite action of Pontin52 and Reptin52 on β-catenin-mediated transactivation constitutes an additional mechanism for the control of the canonical Wingless/Wnt pathway.

Introduction

Wnt genes encode evolutionarily conserved secreted proteins which initiate intracellular transduction cascades critical in numerous developmental processes. The canonical Wingless (Wg)/Wnt pathway originally characterized in Drosophila has also been identified in vertebrates as well as in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (for reviews see Cadigan and Nusse, 1997 ; Miller et al., 1999 ). Activation of Frizzled cell surface receptors by Wg/Wnt ligands induces the downstream signalling cascade. Once the cascade is started, β-catenin, a central player of Wnt signalling, enters the nucleus, forms a bipartite transcription complex with a member of the lymphoid-enhancing factor-1 (LEF-1)/T-cell factor (TCF) family and controls Wnt target gene transcription. β-catenin, and its Drosophila homologue Armadillo (Arm), are multifunctional proteins involved in cadherin-mediated cell adhesion, apart from their role as Wnt transcriptional effectors. Proper cell responses to the Wg/Wnt signal require a tight control of the induced signal transduction cascade. A variety of regulatory mechanisms balancing the effects of Wnt proteins are operating at many steps in the pathway. At the cell surface, distinct classes of secreted molecules counteract signalling, presumably by interfering with reception by Frizzled-like proteins ( Bouwmeester et al., 1996 ; Leyns et al., 1997 ; Rattner et al., 1997 ; Glinka et al., 1998 ; Hsieh et al., 1999 ; Piccolo et al., 1999 ). Inside the cell, the level of β-catenin accumulation is tightly regulated in a Wnt-dependent manner by a multiprotein complex composed of the adenomatous polyposis tumour protein APC, axin and the kinase GSK-3β ( Klingensmith et al., 1994 ; Papkoff et al., 1996 ; Jiang et al., 1998 ; Yost et al., 1998 ; Hamada et al., 1999b ; Salic et al., 2000 ). Wnt-induced inactivation of GSK-3 prevents β-catenin phosphorylation and subsequent proteosomal degradation, stabilizes β-catenin in the cytoplasm in a cadherin-free form and promotes its nuclear translocation.

The association of nuclear β-catenin with TCF constitutes a further control step of the pathway, since TCF acetylation by CREB-binding protein (CBP) in Drosophila ( Waltzer and Bienz, 1998 ) or interaction of β-catenin with inhibitor of β-catenin and TCF (ICAT) in vertebrates ( Tago et al., 2000 ) prevents complex formation and thereby Wg/Wnt signalling. The molecular mechanism by which the β-catenin–TCF complex promotes target gene transcription is poorly understood. TCF binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner and directs the complex to target gene promoters where β-catenin N- and C-terminal regions act as transactivation domains ( van de Wetering et al., 1997 ; Hecht et al., 1999 ). In the absence of Wg/Wnt signalling, TCF is associated with Groucho/TLE and maintains an inactive state of target genes ( Cavallo et al., 1998 ; Levanon et al., 1998 ; Roose et al., 1998 ). In this process, the Groucho/TLE protein was shown to interact with histones ( Palaparti et al., 1997 ) and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) Rpd3 ( Chen et al., 1999 ). More recently, p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase (HAT) has been shown to function as a coactivator of β-catenin in vertebrates, presumably by alleviating the Groucho- mediated repression ( Hecht et al., 2000 ). Thus, Wnt signalling control involves HATs and HDACs, enzymes that play important roles in chromatin remodelling and regulation of gene transcription (for reviews see Grunstein, 1997 ; Struhl, 1998 ; Strahl and Allis, 2000 ). This strongly suggests that the mechanism modulating the activity of TCF and β-catenin nuclear effectors involves changes in the chromatin structure at target gene promoters.

We recently identified an interacting partner of β-catenin, Pontin52, that also binds the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) in vitro. Evidence was also provided for an in vivo multiprotein complex composed of Pontin52, β-catenin and TCF, suggesting a role for Pontin52 in Wnt target gene regulation ( Bauer et al., 1998 ). Pontin52 (synonyms: TIP49a, Kanemaki et al., 1997 ; NMP238, Holzmann et al., 1998 ; RUVBL1, Qiu et al., 1998 ; Rvb1, Shen et al., 2000 ; TAP54α, Ikura et al., 2000 ) is a member of a highly conserved protein family with homology to bacterial RuvB, an ATP-dependent DNA helicase that catalyses branch migration in Holliday junctions. In eukaryotes, the family has evolved in two distinct branches: TIP49a (or Pontin52) and TIP49b ( Kurokawa et al., 1999 ). Mammalian TIP49a and TIP49b possess intrinsic ATPase activities that are stimulated by single-stranded DNA and helicase activities of opposite polarity ( Kanemaki et al., 1999 ; Makino et al., 1999 ). Interestingly, recently reported functional data have shown that both proteins are complexed with a domain in c-Myc that is essential for oncogenic activity, suggesting that the Tip49a/b ATPase/helicase proteins represent a novel class of transcriptional cofactors that function in diverse pathways ( Wood et al., 2000 ).

Here we report that TIP49b, which we isolated independently as an interacting partner of Pontin52 and named Reptin52 ( rep ressing Pon tin52 ), is able, like Pontin52, to bind β-catenin and TBP directly. Moreover, we demonstrated by reporter gene assays that Reptin52 represses gene activation mediated by TCF–β-catenin, while Pontin52 can stimulate gene activation. To address their function in Wg/Wnt signalling in vivo , we isolated and mutagenized the orthologous genes in Drosophila : dpontin ( dpon ) and dreptin ( drep ). Consistent with the reporter gene assays, removal of one copy of either dpon or drep modifies, in an opposite manner, the phenotypes generated by arm loss or gain of function. Our results provide evidence for a new regulatory mechanism of Wg/Wnt signalling where Pontin52 and Reptin52 act antagonistically on target gene activation.

Discussion

β-catenin, originally isolated as a component of the cadherin-based cell–cell adhesion complex, has a second essential function as transcriptional effector of the Wg/Wnt signalling pathway. To achieve such functional duality, β-catenin interacts with partners specifically involved in these processes. We recently reported that Pontin52 binds β-catenin, forms a tripartite complex with β-catenin and TCF, and also binds TBP, suggesting that it acts to bridge the β-catenin–TCF transactivator complex to the transcriptional machinery ( Bauer et al., 1998 ). In this study, we show that Reptin52 also directly interacts with β-catenin and TBP, suggesting that it also plays a role in this process. As no physical association of Pontin52 or Reptin52 with hTCF4 or LEF-1 could be detected by immunoprecipitation or affinity precipitation (not shown), we conclude that Pontin52 and Reptin52 most probably act on β-catenin in the β-catenin–TCF transcription complex. The functional and genetic analysis presented here demonstrates that these molecular interactions control Arm/β-catenin signalling. In reporter gene assays, Reptin52 strongly inhibits the activation of the Wnt-responsive siamois promoter in a dose-dependent manner. This repressive effect clearly depends on the presence of β-catenin in the transactivation complex since Reptin52 has no influence on the activity of LEFΔN–VP16. Pontin52 has an opposite effect, and potentiates siamois promoter activity. Genetic analysis in Drosophila reinforces the conclusion that both proteins are required for controlling Arm/β-catenin signalling activity and provides evidence that this mechanism is relevant in vivo. Loss of function for either gene dominantly modifies phenotypes caused by changes in nuclear Arm levels, in a pattern consistent with dPon and dRep acting as positive and negative regulators of Wg/Wnt signalling, respectively. Together, these data suggest that the connection between the Wnt nuclear effector complex and the transcription machinery requires direct interactions between Arm/β-catenin, dPon/Pontin52 and dRep/Reptin52, and, furthermore, that the two cofactors act antagonistically on target gene transcription.

The transcription patterns of dpon and drep are highly similar during embryogenesis and imaginal development. While the differential zygotic expression of the messages probably results in increased levels of the proteins in specific territories, dPon and dRep proteins are provided everywhere from early embryogenesis onwards, which is consistent with their common recruitment in multiprotein complexes. Pontin52 and Reptin52 have been found in several multimeric protein complexes ( Kanemaki et al., 1999 ; Ikura et al., 2000 ; Shen et al., 2000 ; Wood et al., 2000 ). Our data suggest that in complexes formed with β-catenin, TCF and TBP, the balance in the levels of antagonistically acting Pontin52 and Reptin52 constitutes an additional regulatory mechanism for Wg/Wnt signalling. Considering the dose-dependent effects observed in both cell transfection and fly experiments, higher levels of either Pontin52 or Reptin52 would give rise to complexes that either promote or repress target gene transcription. Since the two proteins can interact both homotypically and heterotypically ( Kanemaki et al., 1999 ; Wood et al., 2000 ; Figure 1 ), it is interesting to speculate that complexes with a different Pontin52/Reptin52 stoichiometric ratio might regulate β-catenin–TCF transcriptional activity differentially. Alternatively, since Pontin52 and Reptin52 interact in vitro with the same domain of β-catenin, the antagonistic action of both proteins might be based on a competitive binding to the Wnt nuclear effector.

Most interestingly, in the complex formed in vivo by TIP49 (Pontin52), TIP48 (Reptin52) and c-Myc, TIP49 functions as a positive cofactor of oncogenic transformation ( Wood et al., 2000 ). While no functional role has been established for TIP48 in this system, the c-Myc N-terminus is able to bind both proteins and is proposed to recruit the two cofactors for transcriptional control of target genes critical for cell transformation. There is an obvious parallel between the recruitment of Pontin52 and Reptin52 by c-Myc and by β-catenin oncogenic proteins. Moreover, Pontin52 acts as a positive effector in both cases. The present finding that Reptin52 acts as a corepressor that balances the coactivator function of Pontin52 in the β-catenin pathway suggests that this functional relationship may have been conserved to provide a close control of transcriptional targets of several different pathways.

Elucidating how Pontin52 and Reptin52 modulate transcription will require further studies. Both factors possess intrinsic ATPase and DNA helicase activities ( Kanemaki et al., 1999 ; Makino et al., 1999 ), suggesting a function in DNA unwinding and promoter opening. Such a role has been proposed for XPB and XPD, two helicases with opposite polarities contained in the TFIIH multimeric transcription factor ( Coin et al., 1999 ). Moreover, the RuvB-like Pontin52 and Reptin52 proteins have been found recently in chromatin modifying and remodelling complexes: the yeast INO80 remodelling complex, which is involved in transcription and DNA processing ( Shen et al., 2000 ); and the human multisubunit TIP60 HAT complex, which modifies nucleosomal histones and plays a role in DNA repair and apoptosis ( Ikura et al., 2000 ). There is also evidence that regulators of β-catenin–TCF activity act in complexes that locally modify chromatin structure. The corepressor Groucho interacts with TCF ( Cavallo et al., 1998 ; Levanon et al., 1998 ; Roose et al., 1998 ) and participates in the formation of a silencing complex containing the linker histone H1 and Rpd3 HDAC ( Chen et al., 1999 ). Drosophila CBP, which acetylates TCF and antagonizes signalling by Wg ( Waltzer and Bienz, 1998 ), is part of many transcriptional complexes ( Akimaru et al., 1997 ). In vertebrates, p300/CBP HAT is thought to alleviate repression of Wnt target genes by changing the chromatin structure ( Hecht et al., 2000 ). An attractive possibility, therefore, is that the complex containing TCF, β-catenin, Pontin52 and Reptin52 represents only a facet of multisubunit complex(es) that would integrate the functions of Pontin52 and Reptin52 in many aspects of chromatin dynamics related to transcription regulation, including histone modification, local relaxation, DNA unwinding, connection to the transcription machinery and transcription initiation.
