We have merged four different views of the human plasma proteome, based on 
different methodologies, into a single nonredundant list of 1175 distinct gene 
products. The methodologies used were 1) literature search for proteins reported 
to occur in plasma or serum; 2) multidimensional chromatography of proteins 
followed by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy (MS) 
identification of resolved proteins; 3) tryptic digestion and multidimensional 
chromatography of peptides followed by MS identification; and 4) tryptic 
digestion and multidimensional chromatography of peptides from 
low-molecular-mass plasma components followed by MS identification. Of 1,175 
nonredundant gene products, 195 were included in more than one of the four input 
datasets. Only 46 appeared in all four. Predictions of signal sequence and 
transmembrane domain occurrence, as well as Genome Ontology annotation 
assignments, allowed characterization of the nonredundant list and comparison of 
the data sources. The "nonproteomic" literature (468 input proteins) is strongly 
biased toward signal sequence-containing extracellular proteins, while the three 
proteomics methods showed a much higher representation of cellular proteins, 
including nuclear, cytoplasmic, and kinesin complex proteins. Cytokines and 
protein hormones were almost completely absent from the proteomics data 
(presumably due to low abundance), while categories like DNA-binding proteins 
were almost entirely absent from the literature data (perhaps unexpected and 
therefore not sought). Most major categories of proteins in the human proteome 
are represented in plasma, with the distribution at successively deeper layers 
shifting from mostly extracellular to a distribution more like the whole 
(primarily cellular) proteome. The resulting nonredundant list confirms the 
presence of a number of interesting candidate marker proteins in plasma and 
serum.
