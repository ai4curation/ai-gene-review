In the preimplantation mouse embryo, TEAD4 is critical to establishing the 
trophectoderm (TE)-specific transcriptional program and segregating TE from the 
inner cell mass (ICM). However, TEAD4 is expressed in the TE and the ICM. Thus, 
differential function of TEAD4 rather than expression itself regulates 
specification of the first two cell lineages. We used ChIP sequencing to define 
genomewide TEAD4 target genes and asked how transcription of TEAD4 target genes 
is specifically maintained in the TE. Our analyses revealed an evolutionarily 
conserved mechanism, in which lack of nuclear localization of TEAD4 impairs the 
TE-specific transcriptional program in inner blastomeres, thereby allowing their 
maturation toward the ICM lineage. Restoration of TEAD4 nuclear localization 
maintains the TE-specific transcriptional program in the inner blastomeres and 
prevents segregation of the TE and ICM lineages and blastocyst formation. We 
propose that altered subcellular localization of TEAD4 in blastomeres dictates 
first mammalian cell fate specification.

Abstract

In the preimplantation mouse embryo, TEAD4 is critical to establishing the trophectoderm (TE)-specific transcriptional program and segregating TE from the inner cell mass (ICM). However, TEAD4 is expressed in the TE and the ICM. Thus, differential function of TEAD4 rather than expression itself regulates specification of the first two cell lineages. We used ChIP sequencing to define genomewide TEAD4 target genes and asked how transcription of TEAD4 target genes is specifically maintained in the TE. Our analyses revealed an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, in which lack of nuclear localization of TEAD4 impairs the TE-specific transcriptional program in inner blastomeres, thereby allowing their maturation toward the ICM lineage. Restoration of TEAD4 nuclear localization maintains the TE-specific transcriptional program in the inner blastomeres and prevents segregation of the TE and ICM lineages and blastocyst formation. We propose that altered subcellular localization of TEAD4 in blastomeres dictates first mammalian cell fate specification.

Discussion

The inside-outside model ( 22 ) and the polarity model ( 23 ) propose that, in preimplantation embryos, inner blastomeres are functionally different from outer blastomeres. However, molecular mechanisms that specify and maintain differential transcriptional programs in outer vs. inner cells remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that transcription of several key TE-specific genes, as well as Tead4 itself, is directly regulated by TEAD4. However, transcription of those genes is impaired in the nascent ICM lineage because of the absence of nuclear TEAD4. We showed that differential subcellular localization of TEAD4 between TE and ICM lineages is a conserved event in several mammalian species, including human. We also showed that ectopic expression of TEAD4 induces its nuclear localization in the inner blastomeres, induces TE-specific genes, and prevents proper preimplantation development. Taken together, our results suggest a model ( Fig. 6 ) in which reduced TEAD4 expression caused by disruption of a positive autoregulatory loop contributes to impaired TEAD4 nuclear localization in the inner blastomeres, thereby suppressing a TE-specific transcriptional program. We also propose that altered nuclear localization of TEAD4 is a conserved mechanism responsible for regulating distinct transcriptional programs in the nascent TE vs. ICM lineages, thereby allowing their specification and maturation of a preimplantation mammalian embryo to the blastocyst stage.

A recent study in the context of endothelial cells showed that altered nuclear localization regulates TEAD4 function ( 24 ). However, our findings regarding the exclusion of TEAD4 from the nuclei of the ICM lineage cells is different from an earlier report by Nishioka et al. ( 5 ). That report indicated that, at the blastocyst stage of a mouse embryo, TEAD4 protein is detectable in all nuclei of TE and ICM. We propose that different reagents and experimental procedures are probable reasons for the discrepancies in our findings and those of Nishioka et al. ( 5 ). As we were unable to analyze TEAD4-null mice or TEAD4-null mESCs, we validated the specificity of the TEAD4 antibody that is used in our study by three different tests: ( i ) by showing that TEAD motif is the most predominant motif in genomewide TEAD4-binding regions identified by ChIP-seq analysis; ( ii ) by specifically knocking down TEAD4 in mTSCs; and ( iii ) by overexpressing the mouse Tead4 gene in iTEAD4 cells and in preimplantation mouse embryos.

Our mechanistic analyses showed evidence that a positive autoregulatory mechanism of TEAD4 expression could be important for altered protein levels in TE vs. ICM lineage cells ( Fig. 6 ), which in turn could contribute to altered subcellular localization of TEAD4 in these two cell lineages. However, the molecular mechanism that initiates impairment of TEAD4 nuclear localization in inner blastomeres remains to be identified. Although we have shown that exposure of developing embryos to BMP4 can induce TEAD4 localization in inner cells, the lack of preimplantation developmental defect in BMP4-null mice ( 25 ) indicates that BMP4-dependent mechanisms are not the sole regulator in altering subcellular localization of TEAD4 in developing embryos. We predict that lack of cell polarization and absence of signaling from apical surfaces in the inner cells also contributes toward loss of TEAD4 nuclear localization. Thus, defining signaling mechanisms that prevent nuclear localization of TEAD4 in inner cells is an important subject of further study. Interestingly, as the appropriate TEAD4 nuclear localization patterns are maintained in mESCs and mTSCs, these stem cell populations can be exploited for further mechanistic studies.

Finally, the present model predicts that, in the ICM lineage cells or in ICM-derived ESCs, TEAD4 function is impaired, as the coactivator YAP is excluded from the nuclei of those cells ( 6 ). It has been indicated that phosphorylation of YAP by hippo signaling component, LATS2 kinase, restricts its nuclear localization in the ICM lineage cells as well as in the nuclei of ICM-derived mESCs ( 6 ). However, we found that YAP is mainly present in the nuclei of undifferentiated mESCs ( Fig. 2 D ). Our observation in mESCs supports two recent studies ( 26 , 27 ). These studies indicated that YAP is predominantly found in the nuclei of undifferentiated mESCs and is important for inducing expression of pluripotency regulators OCT3/4 and NANOG to maintain mESC self-renewal. We also analyzed numerous mouse blastocysts and detected YAP in the ICM nuclei in all of them ( SI Appendix , Fig. S6 ). As mentioned earlier, we confirmed specificity of YAP antibodies by using Yap −/− mouse embryos ( SI Appendix , Fig. S6 ). These observations and our findings of impaired TEAD4 nuclear localization in the ICM/mESCs indicate that further study is important to definitively conclude involvement of a Hippo–LATS2–YAP axis in limiting TEAD4 function in those contexts.
