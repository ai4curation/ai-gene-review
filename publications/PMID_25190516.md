The small GTPase Arf1 plays critical roles in membrane traffic by initiating the 
recruitment of coat proteins and by modulating the activity of lipid-modifying 
enzymes. Here, we report an unexpected but evolutionarily conserved role for 
Arf1 and the ArfGEF GBF1 at mitochondria. Loss of function of ARF-1 or GBF-1 
impaired mitochondrial morphology and activity in Caenorhabditis elegans. 
Similarly, mitochondrial defects were observed in mammalian and yeast cells. In 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, aberrant clusters of the mitofusin Fzo1 accumulated in 
arf1-11 mutants and were resolved by overexpression of Cdc48, an AAA-ATPase 
involved in ER and mitochondria-associated degradation processes. Yeast Arf1 
co-fractionated with ER and mitochondrial membranes and interacted genetically 
with the contact site component Gem1. Furthermore, similar mitochondrial 
abnormalities resulted from knockdown of either GBF-1 or contact site components 
in worms, suggesting that the role of Arf1 in mitochondrial functioning is 
linked to ER-mitochondrial contacts. Thus, Arf1 is involved in mitochondrial 
homeostasis and dynamics, independent of its role in vesicular traffic.
