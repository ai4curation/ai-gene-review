NKG2D is known to trigger the natural killer (NK) cell lysis of various tumor 
and virally infected cells. In the NKG2D/ULBP3 complex, the structure of ULBP3 
resembles the alpha1 and alpha2 domains of classical MHC molecules without a 
bound peptide. The lack of alpha3 and beta2m domains is compensated by replacing 
two hydrophobic patches at the underside of the class I MHC-like beta sheet 
floor with a group of hydrophilic and charged residues in ULBP3. NKG2D binds 
diagonally across the ULBP3 alpha helices, creating a complementary interface, 
an asymmetrical subunit orientation, and local conformational adjustments in the 
receptor. The interface is stabilized primarily by hydrogen bonds and 
hydrophobic interactions. Unlike the KIR receptors that recognize a conserved 
HLA region by a lock-and-key mechanism, NKG2D recognizes diverse ligands by an 
induced-fit mechanism.
