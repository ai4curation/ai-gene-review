Interferons are cytokines that have antiviral, antiproliferative and 
immunomodulatory effects. Because of these important properties, in the past two 
decades, major research efforts have been undertaken to understand the 
signalling mechanisms through which these cytokines induce their effects. Since 
the original discovery of the classical JAK (Janus activated kinase)-STAT 
(signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway of signalling, it has 
become clear that the coordination and cooperation of multiple distinct 
signalling cascades - including the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 cascade 
and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase cascade - are required for the generation 
of responses to interferons. It is anticipated that an increased understanding 
of the contributions of these recently identified pathways will advance our 
current thinking about how interferons work.
