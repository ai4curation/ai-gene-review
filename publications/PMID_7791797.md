Hsp90 is a protein chaperone whose functions are focused on a specific set of 
target proteins. The nature of Hsp90's interactions with these proteins is 
poorly understood. To provide tools for examining these interactions, we have 
isolated eight broadly distributed temperature-sensitive (ts) point mutations in 
the Hsp90 gene (HSP82) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mutants fall into two 
distinct classes. One has a classic ts phenotype, with nearly wild-type activity 
at 25 degrees C and a precipitous loss of function at 34 degrees C. The 
remaining seven mutants, in contrast, cause a general reduction in Hsp90 
function and are ts because they do not provide the high level of function 
required for growth at high temperatures. The effects of these mutants on two 
target proteins, a transcription factor (glucocorticoid receptor) and a tyrosine 
kinase (pp60v-src), provided several insights on Hsp90 function. First, Hsp90 is 
not only required to help the glucocorticoid receptor achieve a 
hormone-activable state, it is continuously required to maintain that state. 
Second, Hsp90's function in the maturation of pp60v-src involves separable roles 
in protein accumulation and kinase activation. Thus, Hsp90 is an integral 
component of both the steroid receptor and kinase signaling pathways. Finally, 
all eight point mutants affect the activation of both the glucocorticoid 
receptor and pp60v-src, indicating that Hsp90 promotes the activity of these 
very different target proteins through common mechanisms.
