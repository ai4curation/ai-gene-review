14-3-3 proteins are a family of homologous eukaryotic molecules with seven 
distinct isoforms in mammalian cells. Isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins interact with 
diverse ligands and are involved in the regulation of mitogenesis, cell cycle 
progression, and apoptosis. However, whether different 14-3-3 isoforms are 
responsible for distinct functions remains elusive. Here we report that multiple 
isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins were capable of binding to several ligands, Bad, 
Raf-1, and Cbl. In a functional assay of 14-3-3 isoforms, all mammalian 14-3-3 
isoforms could inhibit Bad-induced apoptosis. Thus, 14-3-3 function in 
regulating one of its ligands, Bad, is conserved among mammalian isoforms. We 
addressed whether 14-3-3 isoforms are differentially expressed in tissues, which 
may in part determine isoform-specific interactions. In situ hybridization 
revealed that 14-3-3zeta was present in most tissues tested, but sigma was 
preferentially expressed in epithelial cells. Thus, isoforms of 14-3-3 can 
interact and control the function of selected protein ligands, and differential 
tissue distribution of 14-3-3 isoforms may contribute to their specific 
interactions and subsequent downstream signaling events.
