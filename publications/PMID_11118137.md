The completion of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence allows a comparative 
analysis of transcriptional regulators across the three eukaryotic kingdoms. 
Arabidopsis dedicates over 5% of its genome to code for more than 1500 
transcription factors, about 45% of which are from families specific to plants. 
Arabidopsis transcription factors that belong to families common to all 
eukaryotes do not share significant similarity with those of the other kingdoms 
beyond the conserved DNA binding domains, many of which have been arranged in 
combinations specific to each lineage. The genome-wide comparison reveals the 
evolutionary generation of diversity in the regulation of transcription.
