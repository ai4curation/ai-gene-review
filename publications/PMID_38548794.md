The study of phosphorylase kinase (PhK)-regulated glycogen metabolism has 
contributed to the fundamental understanding of protein phosphorylation; 
however, the molecular mechanism of PhK remains poorly understood. Here we 
present the high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of human muscle 
PhK. The 1.3-megadalton PhK α4β4γ4δ4 hexadecamer consists of a tetramer of 
tetramer, wherein four αβγδ modules are connected by the central β4 scaffold. 
The α- and β-subunits possess glucoamylase-like domains, but exhibit no 
detectable enzyme activities. The α-subunit serves as a bridge between the 
β-subunit and the γδ subcomplex, and facilitates the γ-subunit to adopt an 
autoinhibited state. Ca2+-free calmodulin (δ-subunit) binds to the γ-subunit in 
a compact conformation. Upon binding of Ca2+, a conformational change occurs, 
allowing for the de-inhibition of the γ-subunit through a spring-loaded 
mechanism. We also reveal an ADP-binding pocket in the β-subunit, which plays a 
role in allosterically enhancing PhK activity. These results provide molecular 
insights of this important kinase complex.
