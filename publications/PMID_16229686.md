Neutral CDases (ceramidases) are newly identified enzymes with important roles 
in cell regulation, but little is known about their catalytic mechanisms. In the 
present study the full-length human neutral CDase was cloned and expressed in 
the yeast double-knockout strain Dypc1Dydc1, which lacks the yeast CDases YPC1p 
and YDC1p. Biochemical characterization of the human neutral CDase showed that 
the enzyme exhibited classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with an optimum 
activity at pH 7.5. Activity was enhanced by Na+ and Ca2+. Mg2+ and Mn2+ were 
somewhat stimulatory, but Zn2+, Cu2+ and Fe2+ inhibited the enzyme. 
Dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol dose-dependently inhibited neutral CDase. 
In order to identify which amino acids were involved in the catalytic action of 
neutral CDase, the purified enzyme was subjected to chemical modifications. It 
was observed that the serine residue modifier di-isopropyl fluorophosphate 
dose-dependently inhibited activity, implicating a serine residue in the 
catalytic action. From an alignment of the sequences of the neutral CDases from 
different species, all conserved serine residues were selected for site-directed 
mutagenesis. Of the six aligned serine residues that were mutated to alanine, 
only the S354A mutant lost its activity totally. Ser354 falls within a very 
highly conserved hexapeptide sequence GDVSPN, which itself was in the middle of 
a larger conserved sequence, namely NXGDVSPNXXGP/XXC. Moreover, mutations of 
Asp352 and Cys362 in the consensus sequence to alanine resulted in loss of 
activity of neutral CDase. Hence the present study identified a novel amidase 
sequence containing a critical serine residue that may function as a nucleophile 
in the hydrolytic attack on the amide bond present in ceramide.
