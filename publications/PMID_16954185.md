Abstract

Advanced glycation end product receptors (AGERs) play distinct functional roles in both the toxicity and disposal of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), substances that are linked to diabetes and aging. Overexpression of AGER1 in murine mesangial cells (MCs) (MC-R1) inhibited AGE-induced MAPK1,2 phosphorylation and NF-κB activity and also increased AGE degradation. The mechanism of the inhibitory effects of AGER1, upstream of MAPK, was explored in MCs and HEK293 AGER1-expressing cells. AGE-induced Ras activation was found to be linked to Shc/Grb2 complex formation and Shc phosphorylation in MCs, responses that were markedly reduced in MC-R1 cells. AGE responses also included EGF receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation in MCs or HEK293 cells, but this link was blocked in both MC-R1 and HEK293-R1 cells. Coexpression of AGER1 and EGFR in HEK293 cells decreased AGE-mediated EGFR and p44/p42 phosphorylation but not EGF-induced p44/p42 activation. AGE, S100/calgranulin, or H 2 O 2 promoted MAPK phosphorylation in EGFR + cells in a manner that was inhibitable by an EGFR inhibitor, AG1478. Also, in AGER1 cells, AGE-induced H 2 O 2 formation and AGE- or S100-induced p44/p42 phosphorylation were suppressed, and these effects were restored by R1 siRNA. These data confirm that R1 negatively regulates AGE-mediated oxidant stress-dependent signaling via the EGFR and Shc/Grb2/Ras pathway. AGER1 could serve as a model for developing therapeutic targets against vascular and kidney disorders related to diabetes and aging.

Discussion

AGER1 may play a protective role in the AGE-induced cellular toxicity that is seen in diabetes and aging by enhancing AGE disposal and by countering RAGE-promoted OS and subsequent MAPK/NF-κB-dependent cell activation ( 9 , 12 , 13 ). In the present report, we found that EGFR and the Shc/Grb2 complex have a previously unidentified role in the AGE signaling activation pathway. The negative regulatory effects of AGER1 on AGE signaling are mediated by means of the inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation and Shc/Grb2 complex formation. These effects may be related to a direct molecular interaction between AGER1 and EGFR. AGER1 also exhibits significant suppressive effects on intracellular ROS generation, which may in part be due to increased AGE degradation by AGER1.

We found that AGE causes Ras/MAPK1,2 activation by means of tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in two different types of kidney cells, MCs and epithelial (HEK293) cells. This interaction, as with the S100/RAGE interaction, depends on the generation of ROS. The mechanism by which AGE induces ROS generation, resulting in Ras/MAPK1,2 phosphorylation, remains unclear, because no AGERs, including RAGE, have known autophosphorylation sites or specific kinase activity ( 15 , 25 ).

ROS and H 2 O 2 are known triggers of Tyr phosphorylation of EGFR, which leads to downstream MAPK or Akt activation ( 26 , 27 ). Importantly, this can happen in the absence of EGF stimulation. As with H 2 O 2 , here, AGE and S100 also induced Tyr phosphorylation of EGFR. Because the EGFR activation inhibitor AG1478 inhibited the p44/42 Tyr phosphorylation induced by all three ROS-triggering ligands, these inhibitions appeared to act via an EGFR-specific signal pathway. However, when the cells overexpressing EGFR were also transfected with AGER1, only AGE- and S100-induced p44/42 Tyr phosphorylation was inhibited, and not that due to H 2 O 2 . Thus, AGER1 can counteract some of the downstream effects of AGE and S100 stimulation, both of which are ROS generators. Although the data do not suggest a direct interaction of either R1 or EGFR with RAGE, such a possibility requires further study. However, the findings remain consistent with a dependence of RAGE signaling on ROS and with a lack of specificity for AGE. In addition, AGER1 did not counteract exogenous H 2 O 2 -induced MAPK phosphorylation, indicating that this phosphorylation involves a different mechanism.

Activation of Ras occurs through GDP/GTP exchange, catalyzed by the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor Sos proteins, which are translocated to the plasma membrane as a result of Shc/Grb2 complex formation ( 28 ). Shc, an important group of adaptor proteins, plays a critical role in the Ras/ERK signaling cascade ( 29 ). After undergoing phosphorylation, Shc provides higher affinity docking sites for Grb2 complex formation ( 24 ). Shc phosphorylation usually occurs after Grb2 complex recruitment to phosphotyrosine residues of growth factors such as EGFR ( 24 ). We found that AGE-mediated Ras and MAPK1,2 activation ( 30 ) progressed in a stepwise fashion through the EGFR-triggered sequence of events described above. Although we have not explored all of the relationships in this proximal phase of AGE signal induction, we noted that brief exposure to AGE preferentially stimulates Tyr phosphorylation of the 52-kDa Shc and, to a lesser extent, the 46-kDa Shc, but not the 66-kDa Shc, in kidney epithelial and MC lines. These studies made use of an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody that is specific for Tyr-317. In several cell types, EGFR activation involves all three Shc isoforms ( 31 ), including tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation. Thus, further studies are needed to determine whether these discrepancies are due to differences in the cell types or in the immunoreagents used. Based on previous reports that have linked phosphorylation of Shc 66 to EGFR inactivation ( 31 ), its possible role in AGER1–AGE signaling inactivation is worthy of further investigation ( 31 ).

Our findings suggest that EGFR is an important contributor to the AGE cell activation pathway and also reveal a potential mechanism by which AGE signal suppression can limit AGE toxicity after AGER1 overexpression.

Interestingly, AGER1 overexpression did not affect EGF-induced signaling. Instead, EGF stimulation led to enhanced EGFR protein expression and signaling, remaining independent of the inhibitory action of AGER1. This observation suggests that AGER1 does not interfere with EGFR gene regulation and events induced by EGF [i.e., dimerization, adaptor recruitment, or signaling ( 16 )]. Rather, the AGER1 effects on EGFR activity appear to be AGE/ROS-specific. In fact, AGER1-mediated inhibition of AGE-induced EGFR activation ( 32 , 33 ) was restored by R1 siRNA. Furthermore, AGE-induced intracellular ROS generation was inhibited in AGER1-overexpressing cells, supporting the pivotal role of AGER1 in this interaction.

Although AGE has been shown to stimulate heparin-binding EGF production ( 34 ), the relationship that we found between AGERs and EGFR has not been suggested previously. The present studies clearly demonstrate a direct interaction between AGER1 and EGFR, although the molecular domains and the possibility that additional cellular components are involved in this interaction remain to be further explored. A possible dependence of EGFR responsiveness on the level of EGFR vs. R1 cell surface availability was suggested during EGFR and AGER1 single expression and coexpression studies. These data may point to a potential explanation for the low efficacy of AGER1 ( 12 ) under conditions of sustained ROS generation [e.g., in diabetes, when EGFR expression and activity might be expected to be elevated ( 32 , 33 )].

Our previous report showed that AGER1 played a role in AGE clearance by mediating enhanced AGE uptake and degradation ( 9 ). In the current study, we found that AGE-induced ROS levels in 293-R1 cells were no different from mock cells after partial blockade of endocytosis with the endocytosis inhibitor PAO. This observation indicated that, when AGER1 is overexpressed, it may more effectively clear AGE, causing attenuation of AGE/ROS-mediated signaling, and that this finding could serve in part as an additional mechanism for reduced EGFR phosphorylation in R1 cells ( 35 , 36 ). However, a nonspecific PAO action could not be ruled out. Also, these data do not account for AGE ROS that are generated in cell types lacking AGE-specific endocytosis, and further studies are needed to address this issue in greater detail, including mapping of the AGER1-binding site and/or of sites of interaction with EGFR.

Based on these findings, we speculate that, in a normal environment, AGER1 may sequester EGFR, the end result being to minimize undue EGFR activation by uncoupling EGFR from Shc/Grb2/Sos and Ras, thereby preventing inappropriate cell activation. Under conditions of sustained excess of AGE and ROS, however, the AGE-saturated AGER1 may be rendered inactive and no longer accessible to EGFR. Thus, excess ROS could lead to sustained EGFR and MAPK/NF-κB stimulation, which may account in part for an ineffective AGER1 function in chronic unregulated oxidant or carbonyl stress (e.g., in diabetes and age-related vascular/renal diseases, also known as inflammatory states).

In conclusion, our findings help elucidate aspects of both the positive and negative regulatory steps of AGE- and AGER-mediated activation pathways involved in the inflammatory response. Although we studied murine or human kidney cells, the data may apply to other cells and tissues that are shown to express AGER1. These data may improve the understanding by which AGE-caused cell toxicity can be regulated and could serve as a guide for developing therapeutic targets for vascular and kidney disorders related to diabetes and aging.
