Transcription has been linked to DNA damage. How the most highly transcribed 
mammalian ribosomal (rDNA) genes maintain genome integrity in the absence of 
transcription-coupled DNA damage repair is poorly understood. Here, we report 
that ABH2/ALKBH2, a DNA alkylation repair enzyme, is highly enriched in the 
nucleolus. ABH2 interacts with DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80 as well as 
nucleolar proteins nucleolin, nucleophosmin 1, and upstream binding factor 
(UBF). ABH2 associates with and promotes rDNA transcription through its DNA 
repair activity. ABH2 knockdown impairs rDNA transcription and leads to 
increased single-stranded and double-stranded DNA breaks that are more 
pronounced in the rDNA genes, whereas ABH2 overexpression protects cells from 
methyl-methanesulfonate-induced DNA damage and inhibition of rDNA transcription. 
In response to massive alkylation damage, ABH2 rapidly redistributes from the 
nucleolus to nucleoplasm. Our study thus reveals a critical role of ABH2 in 
maintaining rDNA gene integrity and transcription and provides insight into the 
ABH2 DNA repair function.
