The molecules essential to the continual morphogenesis and shedding of the 
opsin-containing disks of vertebrate photoreceptors are largely unknown. We 
describe a 37 kd protein, rom-1, which is 35% identical and structurally similar 
to peripherin/retinal degeneration slow (rds). Like peripherin, rom-1 is a 
retina-specific integral membrane protein localized to the photoreceptor disk 
rim. The two proteins are similarly oriented in the membrane, and each has a 
highly conserved (15/16 residues) cysteine- and proline-rich domain in the disk 
lumen. Although both rom-1 and peripherin form disulfide-linked dimers, they do 
not form heterodimers with each other, but appear to associate noncovalently. 
These results suggest both that rom-1 and peripherin are functionally related 
members of a new photoreceptor-specific protein family and that rom-1, like 
peripherin, is likely to be important to outer segment morphogenesis. The 
association of mutations in RDS with retinitis pigmentosa indicates that ROM1 is 
a strong candidate gene for human retinopathies.
