The E5 oncoprotein of bovine papillomavirus type 1 is a 44 amino acid, highly 
hydrophobic protein that induces the stable transformation of immortalized 
murine fibroblasts, presumably through its activation of growth factor 
receptors. Previous studies have shown that the E5 protein complexes with the 16 
kDa (16k) pore-forming protein of vacuolar H(+)-ATPases. This integral membrane 
protein is essential for the acidification and function of subcellular 
compartments that process growth factor receptors. Using an SV40 expression 
system in COS cells, we analyzed whether the E5-16k complexes bind additional 
cellular proteins, including growth factor receptors. These studies demonstrate 
that E5 binds to both the 16k protein and the PDGF receptor and that this 
tri-component complex can be isolated with antibodies specific for each protein. 
Importantly, the 16k protein bound to the PDGF receptor in the absence of E5, 
suggesting that E5 binds to the PDGF receptor via its interaction with the 16k 
protein. An E5 mutant lacking the hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids 
retained binding to both 16k and the PDGF receptor, indicating that E5 binds to 
these proteins through its hydrophobic, membrane-associating domain. These 
studies reveal that hydrophobic, intramembrane interactions govern the 
association of E5, 16k and the PDGF receptor, suggesting a ligand-independent 
mechanism for receptor activation and a potential link between receptor signal 
transduction pathways and membrane pore activity.
