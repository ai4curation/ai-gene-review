Notch receptors guide mammalian cell fate decisions by engaging the proteins 
Jagged and Delta-like (DLL). The 2.3 angstrom resolution crystal structure of 
the interacting regions of the Notch1-DLL4 complex reveals a two-site, 
antiparallel binding orientation assisted by Notch1 O-linked glycosylation. 
Notch1 epidermal growth factor-like repeats 11 and 12 interact with the DLL4 
Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 (DSL) domain and module at the N-terminus of Notch ligands 
(MNNL) domains, respectively. Threonine and serine residues on Notch1 are 
functionalized with O-fucose and O-glucose, which act as surrogate amino acids 
by making specific, and essential, contacts to residues on DLL4. The elucidation 
of a direct chemical role for O-glycans in Notch1 ligand engagement demonstrates 
how, by relying on posttranslational modifications of their ligand binding 
sites, Notch proteins have linked their functional capacity to developmentally 
regulated biosynthetic pathways.
