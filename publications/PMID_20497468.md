Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its paralogs, amyloid precursor-like 
protein-1 and amyloid precursor-like protein-2, appear to have redundant but 
essential role(s) during development. To gain insights into the physiological 
and possibly pathophysiological functions of APP, we used a functional proteomic 
approach to identify proteins that interact with the highly conserved C-terminal 
region of APP family proteins. Previously, we characterized an interaction 
between APP and ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase. Here, we describe an 
interaction between APP and a novel protein, 4-nitrophenylphosphatase domain and 
non-neuronal SNAP25-like protein homolog 1 (NIPSNAP1). The interaction between 
APP and NIPSNAP1 was confirmed both in transiently transfected COS7 cells and in 
the mouse brain, where NIPSNAP1 is expressed at a high level. We demonstrate 
that NIPSNAP1 is targeted to the mitochondria via its N-terminal targeting 
sequence, and interacts with mitochondrial chaperone translocase of the outer 
membrane 22. Mitochondrial localization of NIPSNAP1 appears to be critical for 
its interaction with APP, and overexpression of APP appeared to disrupt NIPSNAP1 
mitochondrial localization. Moreover, APP overexpression resulted in 
downregulation of NIPSNAP1 levels in cultured cells. Our data suggest that APP 
may affect mitochondrial function through a direct interaction with NIPSNAP1 as 
well as with other mitochondrial proteins.
