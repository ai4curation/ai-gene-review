BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia impairs functional properties of cytosolic and nuclear 
proteins via O-linked glycosylation modification (O-GlcNAcylation). We studied 
the effects of O-GlcNAcylation on insulin signaling in human coronary artery 
endothelial cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: O-GlcNAcylation impaired the metabolic branch of insulin 
signaling, ie, insulin receptor (IR) activation of the IR substrate 
(IRS)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt, whereas it enhanced the 
mitogenic branch, ie, ERK-1/2 and p38 (mitogen-activated protein kinase). Both 
in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) 
by Akt were reduced by hyperglycemia and hexosamine activation. Insulin-induced 
eNOS activity in vivo was reduced by hyperglycemia and hexosamine activation, 
which was coupled to increased activation and expression of matrix 
metalloproteinase-2 and -9; these phenomena were reversed by inhibition of the 
hexosamine pathway. Finally, carotid plaques from type 2 diabetic patients 
showed increased endothelial O-GlcNAcylation with respect to nondiabetics.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that hyperglycemia, through the hexosamine pathway, 
impairs activation of the IR/IRS/PI3-K/Akt pathway, resulting in deregulation of 
eNOS activity.
