The cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21 is induced by the tumor 
suppressor p53 and is required for the G1-S block in cells with DNA damage. We 
report that there are two copies of a cyclin-binding motif in p21, Cy1 and Cy2, 
which interact with the cyclins independently of Cdk2. The cyclin-binding motifs 
of p21 are required for optimum inhibition of cyclin-Cdk kinases in vitro and 
for growth suppression in vivo. Peptides containing only the Cy1 or Cy2 motif 
partially inhibit cyclin-Cdk kinase activity in vitro and DNA replication in 
Xenopus egg extracts. A monoclonal antibody which recognizes the Cy1 site of p21 
specifically disrupts the association of p21 with cyclin E-Cdk2 and with cyclin 
D1-Cdk4 in cell extracts. Taken together, these observations suggest that the 
cyclin-binding motif of p21 is important for kinase inhibition and for formation 
of p21-cyclin-Cdk complexes in the cell. Finally, we show that the cyclin-Cdk 
complex is partially active if associated with only the cyclin-binding motif of 
p21, providing an explanation for how p21 is found associated with active 
cyclin-Cdk complexes in vivo. The Cy sequences may be general motifs used by Cdk 
inhibitors or substrates to interact with the cyclin in a cyclin-Cdk complex.
