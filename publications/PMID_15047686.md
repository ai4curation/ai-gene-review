Tom1 (target of Myb1) is a protein of unknown function. Tom1 and its relative 
Tom1L1 have an N-terminal VHS (Vps27p/Hrs/Stam) domain followed by a GAT (GGA 
and Tom1) domain, both of which are also found in the GGA (Golgi-localizing, 
gamma-adaptin ear domain homology, ADP-ribosylation factor-binding protein) 
family of proteins. Although the VHS and GAT domains of GGA proteins bind to 
transmembrane cargo proteins and the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor, 
respectively, the VHS and GAT domains of Tom1 are unable to interact with these 
proteins. In this study, we show that the GAT domains of Tom1 and Tom1L1 
interact with ubiquitin and Tollip (Toll-interacting protein). Ubiquitin bound 
the GAT domains of Tom1, Tom1L1, and GGA proteins, whereas Tollip interacted 
specifically with Tom1 and Tom1L1. Ubiquitin and Tollip bound to an overlapping 
region of the Tom1-GAT domain in a mutually exclusive manner. Tom1 was 
predominantly cytosolic when expressed in cells. On the other hand, Tollip was 
localized on early endosomes and recruited Tom1 and ubiquitinated proteins. 
These observations suggest that Tollip and Tom1 form a complex and regulate 
endosomal trafficking of ubiquitinated proteins.
