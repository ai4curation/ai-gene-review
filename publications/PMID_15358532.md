## Abstract

The death domain protein p84N5, but not the short isoform p84N5s, is cell 
cycle-regulated and shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.

P84N5 is a death domain containing protein that interacts with the tumor 
suppressor retinoblastoma protein and induces apoptosis. We cloned and 
characterized two novel alternatively spliced versions of p84N5. The p84N5 short 
isoform (p84N5s) lacks the death domain and does not induce apoptosis. We showed 
that p84N5, but not p84N5s, is cell cycle regulated. We found that p84N5-GFP 
chimera can rapidly shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Taken 
together, these observations suggest that p84N5 may transmit signals from the 
nucleus to cytoplasmic effectors.
