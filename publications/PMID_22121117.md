MKS3, encoding the transmembrane receptor meckelin, is mutated in Meckel-Gruber 
syndrome (MKS), an autosomal-recessive ciliopathy. Meckelin localizes to the 
primary cilium, basal body and elsewhere within the cell. Here, we found that 
the cytoplasmic domain of meckelin directly interacts with the actin-binding 
protein filamin A, potentially at the apical cell surface associated with the 
basal body. Mutations in FLNA, the gene for filamin A, cause periventricular 
heterotopias. We identified a single consanguineous patient with an MKS-like 
ciliopathy that presented with both MKS and cerebellar heterotopia, caused by an 
unusual in-frame deletion mutation in the meckelin C-terminus at the region of 
interaction with filamin A. We modelled this mutation and found it to abrogate 
the meckelin-filamin A interaction. Furthermore, we found that loss of filamin A 
by siRNA knockdown, in patient cells, and in tissues from Flna(Dilp2) null mouse 
embryos results in cellular phenotypes identical to those caused by meckelin 
loss, namely basal body positioning and ciliogenesis defects. In addition, 
morpholino knockdown of flna in zebrafish embryos significantly increases the 
frequency of dysmorphology and severity of ciliopathy developmental defects 
caused by mks3 knockdown. Our results suggest that meckelin forms a functional 
complex with filamin A that is disrupted in MKS and causes defects in neuronal 
migration and Wnt signalling. Furthermore, filamin A has a crucial role in the 
normal processes of ciliogenesis and basal body positioning. Concurrent with 
these processes, the meckelin-filamin A signalling axis may be a key regulator 
in maintaining correct, normal levels of Wnt signalling.
