Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) chaperones are highly conserved and essential 
proteins with diverse cellular functions, including plant abiotic stress 
tolerance. Hsp70 proteins have been linked with basal heat tolerance in plants. 
Hsp101 likewise is an important chaperone protein that plays a critical role in 
heat tolerance in plants. We observed that Arabidopsis hsc70-1 mutant seedlings 
show elevated basal heat tolerance compared with wild-type. Over-expression of 
Hsc70-1 resulted in increased heat sensitivity. Hsp101 transcript and protein 
levels were increased during non-heat stress (HS) and post-HS conditions in 
hsc70-1 mutant seedlings. In contrast, Hsp101 was repressed in Hsc70-1 
over-expressing plants after post-HS conditions. Hsc70-1 showed physical 
interaction with HsfA1d and HsfA1e protein in the cytosol under non-HS 
conditions. In transient reporter gene analysis, HsfA1d, HsfA1e and HsfA2 showed 
transcriptional response on the Hsp101 promoter. HsfA1d and HsfA2 transcripts 
were at higher levels in hsc70-1 mutant compared with wild-type. We provide 
genetic evidence that Hsc70-1 is a negative regulator affecting HsfA1d/A1e/A2 
activators, which in turn regulate Hsp101 expression and basal thermotolerance.
