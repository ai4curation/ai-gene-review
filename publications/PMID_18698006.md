Previous research has shown that glycolytic enzymes (GEs) exist as multienzyme 
complexes on the inner surface of human erythrocyte membranes. Because GE 
binding sites have been mapped to sequences on the membrane protein, band 3, 
that are not conserved in other mammalian homologs, the question arose whether 
GEs can organize into complexes on other mammalian erythrocyte membranes. To 
address this, murine erythrocytes were stained with antibodies to 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase, phosphofructokinase, lactate 
dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase and analyzed by confocal microscopy. GEs were 
found to localize to the membrane in oxygenated erythrocytes but redistributed 
to the cytoplasm upon deoxygenation, as seen in human erythrocytes. To identify 
membrane proteins involved in GE assembly, erythrocytes from mice lacking each 
of the major erythrocyte membrane proteins were examined for GE localization. 
GEs from band 3 knockout mice were not membrane associated but distributed 
throughout the cytoplasm, regardless of erythrocyte oxygenation state. In 
contrast, erythrocytes from mice lacking alpha-spectrin, ankyrin, protein 4.2, 
protein 4.1, beta-adducin, or dematin headpiece exhibited GEs bound to the 
membrane. These data suggest that oxygenation-dependent assembly of GEs on the 
membrane could be a general phenomenon of mammalian erythrocytes and that 
stability of these interactions depends primarily on band 3.
