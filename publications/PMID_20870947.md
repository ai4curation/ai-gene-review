The mitotic checkpoint is essential for maintaining genomic stability in 
differentiating B cells undergoing genetic alterations of the Ig gene. In this 
study, using real-time RT-PCR and in situ RNA hybridization, we demonstrated 
that MAD2 mRNA export is selectively regulated by Pcid2/Thp1. Pcid2 small 
interfering RNA induced a cell-cycle abnormality with increased apoptosis and 
polyploidy, as previously observed in MAD2-knockdown cells. Pcid2 small 
interfering RNA reduced MAD2 expression, but not the expression of other 
cell-cycle checkpoint proteins, such as MAD1 and BUBR1, or the 
cell-cycle-associated proteins, cyclin A, cyclin B1, and cyclin-dependent kinase 
1. In mouse B lineage cells, Pcid2 transcripts appeared in a stage-dependent 
manner at high levels in bone marrow pre-B and immature B cells, and in spleen 
transitional 1 and follicular B cells, but at lower levels in pro-B, 
transitional 2, and marginal zone B cells, suggesting a stage-dependent 
requirement for MAD2 regulation. Cd19-cre-derived targeting of the Pcid2 gene 
induced a mature B cell deficiency in mice. These findings indicate that Pcid2 
is essential for B cell survival through the regulation of MAD2 expression 
during B cell differentiation.
