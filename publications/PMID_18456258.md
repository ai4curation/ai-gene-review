Podocalyxin (PODXL) is an anti-adhesive glycoprotein expressed abundantly in the 
epithelial cells of kidney glomeruli. In contrast, we report herein that 
expression of podocalyxin(GFP) (PODXL(GFP)) in CHO cells increased the adherence 
to immobilized fibronectin, spreading, and migration. The transient knockdown of 
PODXL or the expression of PODXL lacking the cytosolic carboxyterminal domain 
(PODXL-Delta(451)) inhibited cell adherence. Moreover, the effect of PODXL was 
prevented by the ectodomain of podocalyxin (PODXL-Delta(429)), by RGD peptides, 
or by inhibitors of the vitronectin receptor (alphavbeta3). CHO-PODXL(GFP) also 
showed adherence to human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC), exhibiting 
polarization of granular PODXL and emission of long and thin, spike-like, 
protrusions with PODXL granules progressing along. We found PODXL colocalized 
with beta1 integrins at membrane ruffle regions on the leading edge of the cell 
and a blocking beta1 mAb prevented the spreading of cells. PODXL was also 
associated with submembrane actin in lamellipodia ruffles, or with vinculin at 
cell protrusions. The proadhesive effects of PODXL were absent in sialic acid 
deficient O-glycomutant CHO cells. To conclude, we present evidence indicating 
that human PODXL enhances the adherence of cells to immobilized ligands and to 
vascular endothelial cells through a mechanism(s) dependent on the activity of 
integrins.
