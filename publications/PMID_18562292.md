PTEN is a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in cancer. Recent reports 
implicated Nedd4-1 as the E3 ubiquitin ligase for PTEN that regulates its 
stability and nuclear localization. We tested the physiological role of Nedd4-1 
as a PTEN regulator by using cells and tissues derived from two independently 
generated strains of mice with their Nedd4-1 gene disrupted. PTEN stability and 
ubiquitination were indistinguishable between the wild-type and 
Nedd4-1-deficient cells, and an interaction between the two proteins could not 
be detected. Moreover, PTEN subcellular distribution, showing prominent 
cytoplasmic and nuclear staining, was independent of Nedd4-1 presence. Finally, 
activation of PKB/Akt, a major downstream target of cytoplasmic PTEN activity, 
and the ability of PTEN to transactivate the Rad51 promoter, a measure of its 
nuclear function, were unaffected by the loss of Nedd4-1. Taken together, our 
results fail to support a role for Nedd4-1 as the E3 ligase regulating PTEN 
stability and subcellular localization.
