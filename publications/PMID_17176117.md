The silent information regulator protein 3 (Sir3p) functions in the initiation, 
propagation, and maintenance of transcriptionally silenced chromatin in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To better understand the physicochemical basis for its 
effects on chromatin architecture, recombinant full-length S. cerevisiae Sir3p 
has been purified to near homogeneity on the large-scale and characterized by 
circular dichroism, limited protease digestion, and analytical 
ultracentrifugation. Results indicate that the Sir3p monomer has a unique 
tripartite domain organization, including a nearly 300-amino-acid residue 
stretch of intrinsically disordered residues that lies internal to its 
structured N- and C-terminal regions. Sir3p self-associates extensively in 
moderate salt and at micromolar protein concentrations producing a broad range 
of oligomers that sediment from 8 to in excess of 85 S. These results provide 
new insight into Sir3p domain organization and quaternary structure and support 
a nucleosome bridging model for Sir3p-dependent regulation of chromatin 
architecture.
