One role of the actin cytoskeleton is to maintain the structural morphology and 
activity of the pre-synaptic terminal. We sought to determine if the actin 
cytoskeleton plays a role in regulating interactions between the norepinephrine 
transporter (NET) and alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn), two proteins expressed in the 
pre-synaptic terminal. In cells transfected with either 0.5 microg/mL or 3 
microg/mL of alpha-Syn and 1 microg/mL of NET DNA, treatment with cytochalasin 
D, an actin depolymerizing agent, caused a dose-dependent decrease and increase, 
respectively, in [3H]-NE uptake. Protein interactions between NET, beta-actin, 
and alpha-Syn were modified, along with levels of surface transporters. 
Treatment of primary brainstem neurons and frontal cortex synaptosomes with 
cytochalasin D caused a 115% and 28% increase, respectively, in NET activity. 
Depolymerization of both actin and microtubules did not alter NET activity in 
cells with 0.5 microg/mL alpha-Syn, but caused an increase in [3H]-NE uptake in 
cells transfected with 3 microg/mL of alpha-Syn and primary neurons. This is the 
first direct demonstration of NET activity being regulated via actin and 
modulated by interactions with alpha-Syn.
