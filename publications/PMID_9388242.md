Reduction-oxidation (redox) plays a critical role in NF-kappaB activation. 
Diverse stimuli appear to utilize reactive oxygen species (e.g. hydrogen 
peroxide) as common effectors for activating NF-kappaB. Antioxidants govern 
intracellular redox status, and many such molecules can reduce H2O2. However, 
functionally, it does appear that different antioxidants are variously selective 
for redox regulation of certain transcription factors such as NF-kappaB. For 
NF-kappaB, thioredoxin has been described to be a more potent antioxidant than 
either glutathione or N-acetylcysteine. Thioredoxin peroxidase is the immediate 
enzyme that links reduction of H2O2 to thioredoxin. Several putative human 
thioredoxin peroxidases have been identified using recursive sequence 
searches/alignments with yeast or prokaryotic enzymes. None has been 
characterized in detail for intracellular function(s). Here, we describe a new 
human thioredoxin peroxidase, antioxidant enzyme AOE372, identified by virtue of 
its protein-protein interaction with the product of a proliferation association 
gene, pag, which is also a thiol-specific antioxidant. In human cells, AOE372 
defines a redox pathway that specifically regulates NF-kappaB activity via a 
modulation of IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation in the cytoplasm. We show that 
AOE372 activity is regulated through either homo- or heterodimerization with 
other thiol peroxidases, implicating subunit assortment as a mechanism for 
regulating antioxidant specificities. AOE372 function suggests thioredoxin 
peroxidase as an immediate regulator of H2O2-mediated activation of NF-kappaB.
