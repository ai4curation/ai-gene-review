BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Coiled-coil domain-containing protein-124 (Ccdc124) is a 
conserved eukaryotic ribosome-associated RNA-binding protein which is involved 
in resuming ribosome activity after stress-related translational shutdown. 
Ccdc124 protein is also detected at cellular localizations devoid of ribosomes, 
such as the centrosome, or the cytokinetic midbody, but its 
translation-independent cellular function is currently unknown.
RESULTS: By using an unbiased LC-MS/MS-based proteomics approach in human 
embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, we identified novel Ccdc124 partners and mapped 
the cellular organization of interacting proteins, a subset of which are known 
to be involved in nucleoli biogenesis and function. We then identified a novel 
interaction between the cancer-associated multifunctional nucleolar marker 
nucleophosmin (Npm1) and Ccdc124, and we characterized this interaction both in 
HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) and U2OS (osteosarcoma) cells. As expected, in 
both types of cells, Npm1 and Ccdc124 proteins colocalized within the nucleolus 
when assayed by immunocytochemical methods, or by monitoring the localization of 
green fluorescent protein-tagged Ccdc124.
CONCLUSIONS: The nucleolar localization of Ccdc124 was impaired when Npm1 
translocates from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm in response to treatment with 
the DNA-intercalator and Topo2 inhibitor chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Npm1 
is critically involved in maintaining genomic stability by mediating various 
DNA-repair pathways, and over-expression of Npm1 or specific NPM1 mutations have 
been previously associated with proliferative diseases, such as acute 
myelogenous leukemia, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, and solid cancers 
originating from different tissues.
SIGNIFICANCE: Identification of Ccdc124 as a novel interaction partner of Nmp1 
within the frame of molecular mechanisms involving nucleolar stress-sensing and 
DNA-damage response is expected to provide novel insights into the biology of 
cancers associated with aberrations in NPM1.
