CT angiography has become an effective noninvasive imaging modality for 
evaluating the renal vasculature. The current clinical applications for CT 
angiography and three-dimensional (3D) imaging related to the kidneys and renal 
vasculature include evaluation of renal artery stenosis, renal diseases related 
to aortic diseases, living-related renal donor candidates, and preoperative 
evaluation of renal masses for possible nephron sparing surgeries. Imaging 
parameters need to be individually prescribed for renal CT angiography depending 
on the diagnostic goal of the examination. Methods for optimizing spiral CT 
protocols including patient preparation, contrast administration, image 
acquisition parameters, and image reconstruction will be covered.
