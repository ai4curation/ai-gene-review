Abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), in particular the 
generation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, has been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. This study examined the consequences of 
deleting the APP gene on hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and upon the 
biophysical properties of morphologically identified neurones in APP-null mice. 
The hippocampus of APP-null mice had a characteristic increase in gliosis 
throughout the CA1 region and a disruption of staining for the dendritic marker 
MAP2 and the presynaptic marker synaptophysin. The disruption of MAP2 staining 
was associated with a significant reduction in overall dendritic length and 
projection depth of biocytin labeled CA1 neurones. In two groups of APP-null 
mice that were examined at 8-12 months, and 20-24 months of age, there was an 
impairment in the formation of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region 
compared to isogenic age matched controls. This LTP deficit was not associated 
with an alteration in the amplitude of EPSPs at low stimulus frequencies (0.033 
Hz) or facilitation during a 100 Hz stimulus train, but was associated with a 
reduction in post-tetanic potentiation. Paired-pulse depression of GABA-mediated 
inhibitory post-synaptic currents was also attenuated in APP-null mice. These 
data demonstrate that the impaired synaptic plasticity in APP deficient mice is 
associated with abnormal neuronal morphology and synaptic function within the 
hippocampus.
