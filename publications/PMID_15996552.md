Entrainment of the Drosophila circadian clock to light involves the 
light-induced degradation of the clock protein timeless (TIM). We show here that 
this entrainment mechanism is inhibited by serotonin, acting through the 
Drosophila serotonin receptor 1B (d5-HT1B). d5-HT1B is expressed in clock 
neurons, and alterations of its levels affect molecular and behavioral responses 
of the clock to light. Effects of d5-HT1B are synergistic with a mutation in the 
circadian photoreceptor cryptochrome (CRY) and are mediated by SHAGGY (SGG), 
Drosophila glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), which phosphorylates TIM. 
Levels of serotonin are decreased in flies maintained in extended constant 
darkness, suggesting that modulation of the clock by serotonin may vary under 
different environmental conditions. These data identify a molecular connection 
between serotonin signaling and the central clock component TIM and suggest a 
homeostatic mechanism for the regulation of circadian photosensitivity in 
Drosophila.
