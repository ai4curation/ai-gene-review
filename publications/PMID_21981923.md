miRNAs are posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression that associate with 
Argonaute and GW182 proteins to repress translation and/or promote mRNA 
degradation. miRNA-mediated mRNA degradation is initiated by deadenylation, 
although it is not known whether deadenylases are recruited to the mRNA target 
directly or by default, as a consequence of a translational block. To answer 
this question, we performed a screen for potential interactions between the 
Argonaute and GW182 proteins and subunits of the two cytoplasmic deadenylase 
complexes. We found that human GW182 proteins recruit the PAN2-PAN3 and 
CCR4-CAF1-NOT deadenylase complexes through direct interactions with PAN3 and 
NOT1, respectively. These interactions are critical for silencing and are 
conserved in D. melanogaster. Our findings reveal that GW182 proteins provide a 
docking platform through which deadenylase complexes gain access to the poly(A) 
tail of miRNA targets to promote their deadenylation, and they further indicate 
that deadenylation is a direct effect of miRNA regulation.
