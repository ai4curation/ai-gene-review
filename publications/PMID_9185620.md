One of the key steps involved in T-cell activation is binding of the tyrosine 
kinase ZAP-70 via its two SH2 domains to peptide segments termed tyrosine-based 
activation motifs (ITAM) which are present in three of the T-cell receptor (TCR) 
subunits. The crystal structure of the ZAP-70 SH2 domains complexed to 
phosphopeptide revealed that the amino-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding pocket 
is formed at the interface between the two SH2 domains. This study was designed 
to further characterize the binding between TCR zeta ITAM1 and the ZAP-70 SH2 
domains as well as to assess the change in conformation of SH2 domain structure 
upon zeta ITAM1 binding. BIAcore analysis of wild type and nonfunctional 
single-point mutants of ZAP-70 SH2 domains demonstrated that the amino-terminal 
SH2 domain can bind phosphopeptide in the absence of a functional 
carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain. In addition, the amino-terminal SH2 domain prefers 
the RREEpYDVLDK sequence of zeta chain ITAM1 over the GQNQLpYNELNL sequence. To 
assess changes in protein conformation upon ITAM binding to ZAP-70 SH2 domains, 
fluorescence spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were 
performed. A significant blue shift in the tryptophan emission spectrum of the 
SH2 domains was observed in the presence of saturating amounts of 
phosphopeptide, indicating a loss in solvent exposure for the tryptophan 
residues in the protein-phosphopeptide complex. This was accompanied by changes 
in the frictional coefficient consistent with a compacting of the protein 
structure. Finally, thermal denaturation experiments showed an increase in 
stability and cooperativity in unfolding for the protein-phosphopeptide complex 
relative to the protein alone.
