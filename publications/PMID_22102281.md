There is increasing evidence that in several fungi, rhamnose-containing glycans 
are involved in processes that affect host-pathogen interactions, including 
adhesion, recognition, virulence, and biofilm formation. Nevertheless, little is 
known about the pathways for the synthesis of these glycans. We show that 
rhamnose is present in glycans isolated from the rice pathogen Magnaporthe 
grisea and from the plant pathogen Botryotinia fuckeliana. We also provide 
evidence that these fungi produce UDP-rhamnose. This is in contrast to bacteria 
where dTDP-rhamnose is the activated form of this sugar. In bacteria, formation 
of dTDP-rhamnose requires three enzymes. Here, we demonstrate that in fungi only 
two genes are required for UDP-Rha synthesis. The first gene encodes a 
UDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase that converts UDP-glucose to 
UDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose. The product was shown by time-resolved (1)H NMR 
spectroscopy to exist in solution predominantly as a hydrated form along with 
minor amounts of a keto form. The second gene encodes a bifunctional 
UDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose-3,5-epimerase/-4-reductase that converts 
UDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose to UDP-rhamnose. Sugar composition analysis and gene 
expression studies at different stages of growth indicate that the synthesis of 
rhamnose-containing glycans is under tissue-specific regulation. Together, our 
results provide new insight into the formation of rhamnose-containing glycans 
during the fungal life cycle. The role of these glycans in the interactions 
between fungal pathogens and their hosts is discussed. Knowledge of the 
metabolic pathways involved in the formation of rhamnose-containing glycans may 
facilitate the development of drugs to combat fungal diseases in humans, as to 
the best of our knowledge mammals do not make these types of glycans.

Introduction

Necrotrophic and biotrophic fungal pathogens are a major cause of global crop damage. Necrotrophic fungi, including Botryotinia fuckeliana ( Botrytis cinerea ), attach to the host and then secrete enzymes and toxins that kill host cells prior to pathogen invasion ( 1 ). In contrast, biotrophic pathogens, including Magnaporthe grisea ( Magnaporthe oryzae ), proliferate within living plant tissues and cause tissue damage and yield reduction. M. grisea , which causes rice blast disease ( 2 ), is a major threat to the food supply. It is estimated that M. grisea destroys enough rice to feed 60 million people in a given year ( 3 ). Likewise B. fuckeliana has an agricultural and economic impact on over 200 plant species ( 4 ).

There is increasing evidence that changes in the glycans present on the fungal cell surface play a role during the infection process ( 5 , 6 ). For example, the ability of a fungus to infect its host is reduced by biochemical treatments that impair glycan recognition or remove the glycan moiety ( 7 ). Here, we discuss the potential role of the surface residue rhamnose in fungi.

Rhamnose (Rha, 6-deoxy- l- mannose) has been reported to be present in a variety of glycoproteins, exopolysaccharides (EPS), 2 and some minor components of the fungal cell wall. For example, hyphae from the barley pathogen Rhynchosporium secalis contain rhamnomannans ( 8 ) that are tightly associated with the cell walls. Other types of rhamnomannans are solubilized by alkali. Rhamnose accounts for at least 30% of the sugars in the rhamnomannan of Cephalotheca purpurea and Cephalotheca reniformis ( 9 ) and less than 2% in Penicillium chrysogenum and Ophiostoma ulmi ( 10 , 11 ).

In addition, Cryphonectria parasitica , the causal agent of chestnut blight disease, secretes an EPS composed of a mannan backbone that is decorated with oligosaccharide side chains that are terminated with rhamnose ( 12 ). Interestingly, nonvirulent strains of this fungus do not secrete this EPS. The mucilage secreted by fungal spores of the corn pathogen, Colletotrichum graminicola consists of various glycoproteins containing Rha as well as galactose and mannose residues ( 13 ). These glycoproteins have been proposed to function as an antidesiccant thereby allowing Colletotrichum conidia to survive periods of drought and changes in temperature ( 6 ).

Although the biosynthesis of fungal core wall polysaccharides ( e.g. glucan, chitin, and mannan) is relatively well understood, virtually nothing is known about the biosynthesis of Rha-containing glycans in fungi, nor is the identity of the activated form of rhamnose used in the synthesis of these glycans known.

Numerous studies have established that dTDP-rhamnose (dTDP-Rha) is used by bacteria for the synthesis of Rha-containing glycolipids and polysaccharides ( 14 ). This nucleotide sugar is formed from dTDP-glucose (dTDP-Glc) ( Fig. 1 A ) by three different enzymes. A 4,6-dehydratase (rmlB) converts dTDP-Glc to dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose. This product is then converted to dTDP-4-keto-rhamnose by a 3,5-epimerase (rmlC). An enzyme with 4-reductase activity (rmlD) converts the keto-rhamnose to dTDP-Rha ( 15 – 17 ). Plants have a single protein (Rhm (UDP- l -rhamnose synthase) also annotated as URS) that converts UDP-Glc to UDP-Rha ( 18 , 19 ). In addition, plants have a bi-functional protein (nucleotide-rhamnose synthase/epimerase-reductase (NRS/ER)) that has 3,5-epimerization and 4-reduction activities ( 19 ).

Here, we describe the identification and functional characterization of two genes from M. grisea and B. fuckeliana involved in UDP-Rha formation. One gene encodes a 4,6-dehydratase, and the second encodes a bifunctional enzyme with 3,5-epimerase and 4-reductase activities ( Fig. 1 B ). Such enzyme activities have not previously been described in fungi, and thus our data provide a basis for understanding the formation of fungal Rha-containing glycans and their roles during the various life cycles of these pathogens.

DISCUSSION

Our study is the first to provide evidence for the existence of UDP-Rha in fungi and the identification of two enzymes required to form this activated sugar from UDP-Glc in M. grisea and B. fuckeliana .

We have shown that both M. grisea and B. fuckeliana synthesize rhamnose-containing glycans. Preliminary data 3 suggest that rhamnose-containing glycans are secreted 2 h after M. grisea spores germinate on artificial substrates. This glycan may protect the spore from desiccation and facilitate adherence to host, as has been suggested for the germination of Colletotrichum graminicola conidia ( 6 , 13 ). Interestingly, the rhamnose-containing glycans accumulate differentially in M. grisea . Similarly, the genes encoding enzymes involved in UDP-Rha are also expressed in a tissue-specific manner.

Unlike M. grisea , the UDP-Rha biosynthetic genes of B. fuckeliana are expressed in both spores and mycelium. Likewise, Rha-containing glycans were also detected in these tissues as well as in an extracellular fraction. The ratio of Rha-containing glycans varies among the fungal tissues, and further detailed structural analyses will be required. Nonetheless, the display of Rha-containing glycans correlates with the expression of the genes for the synthesis of UDP-Rha. This suggests that the formation of UDP-Rha and the synthesis of Rha-containing glycans in fungi could be regulated in a tissue-specific manner. What molecular mechanism is involved in such expression is currently under investigation.

Analysis of the literature describing rhamnose-containing glycans in other fungal species indicates that these glycans are also accumulated in a tissue-specific manner or in response to growth conditions. For example, the extracellular aspartic proteinase from the zygomycete fungus Phycomyces blakesleeanus is a glycoprotein that contains mannose and rhamnose ( 30 ). Secretion of this glycoprotein occurs only at later stages of growth and can be modified by the nutrient composition of the culture media. In contrast, a Rha-containing glycoprotein was reported to be secreted only when C. graminicola spores attach to the host surface ( 13 ). There is also evidence that different types of rhamnose-containing polysaccharides accumulate during development of Hericium erinaceus fruiting bodies ( 31 ). One of the Hericium polysaccharides contains Rha linked to a fucogalactan ( 31 ), in a second the Rha is 3- O -methylated, and in a third, Rha exists in a rhamnoglucogalactan ( 32 ). Rhamnose has also been detected in the mature fruiting body of the black Perigord truffle ( Tuber melanosporum ) but not in other stages of fungal growth ( 33 ). Taken together, synthesis of rhamnose-containing glycans (glycoproteins or polysaccharides) in fungi appears to be regulated.

Some fungi that infect humans also have rhamnose-containing glycans. For example, Sporothrix schenckii , the etiological agent of subcutaneous mycosis disease, secretes a glycoprotein that is heavily glycosylated. The N -linked glycan portion of this glycoprotein is composed of mannose and rhamnose and is believed to be involved in the adherence of the fungus to dermal tissue ( 34 ). The opportunistic human pathogen Candida albicans , the causal agent of candidiasis, when grown under conditions that favor biofilm production secretes a large exopolysaccharide composed of rhamnose, mannose, glucose, and glucosamine ( 35 ). However, under normal growth conditions, the yeast and hyphal forms lack rhamnose. In the human pathogen Fonsecaea pedrosoi ( 36 ), the appearance of rhamnose-containing glycans is also under tissue-specific regulation as rhamnose is predominant in conidia, whereas galactose is predominant in mycelia.

Based on genomic DNA sequence data, fungal species that have Rha-containing glycans also carry genes involved in UDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose and UDP-rhamnose synthesis. For example, S. schenckii , Candida , C. graminicola , and T. melanosporum have genes with homology to the M. grisea and B. fuckeliana genes identified in this report (as shown in supplemental Figs. S3 B and S6 B ). Interestingly, the UDP-rhamnose biosynthetic genes of plant fungi are closer by phylogeny analysis to the plant species, when compared with the animal fungal biosynthetic genes. Of note is the clustering of the two viral UGlc4,6-Dh proteins ( 29 ). The chlorella virus co-living with plant appears to cluster with UGlc4,6-Dh in plants, although the same protein from the giant DNA virus that infects members of the genus Acanthamoeba is clustered with Trypanosoma ( supplemental Fig. S3 B ). It would be of interest in the future to look at many viral genomes and determine the role of UDP-Rha in these virus-host interactions.

As many as 200 fungi are known to impact human health ( 37 ). As far as we are aware, humans do not make Rha-containing glycans; thus, the metabolic pathways involved in the formation of rhamnose-containing glycans provide a potential target for drugs to control some fungal diseases in humans as well as other animals.

Additional research is required to structurally characterize the Rha-containing glycans synthesized by M. grisea and B. fuckeliana . Such information together with data obtained after reduction or elimination of these two UDP-Rha biosynthetic genes, will further illuminate the roles of rhamnose-containing glycans in fungi.
