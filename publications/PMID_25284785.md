Unlike nuclear multisubunit RNA polymerases I, II, and III, whose subunit 
compositions are conserved throughout eukaryotes, plant RNA polymerases IV and V 
are nonessential, Pol II-related enzymes whose subunit compositions are still 
evolving. Whereas Arabidopsis Pols IV and V differ from Pol II in four or five 
of their 12 subunits, respectively, and differ from one another in three 
subunits, proteomic analyses show that maize Pols IV and V differ from Pol II in 
six subunits but differ from each other only in their largest subunits. Use of 
alternative catalytic second subunits, which are nonredundant for development 
and paramutation, yields at least two subtypes of Pol IV and three subtypes of 
Pol V in maize. Pol IV/Pol V associations with MOP1, RMR1, AGO121, 
Zm_DRD1/CHR127, SHH2a, and SHH2b extend parallels between paramutation in maize 
and the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway in Arabidopsis.
