The crystal structure of human retinitis pigmentosa 2 protein (RP2) was solved 
to 2.1 angstroms resolution. It consists of an N-terminal beta helix and a 
C-terminal ferredoxin-like alpha/beta domain. RP2 is functionally and 
structurally related to the tubulin-specific chaperone cofactor C. Seven of nine 
known RP2 missense mutations identified in patients are located in the beta 
helix domain, and most of them cluster to the hydrophobic core and are likely to 
destabilize the protein. Two residues, Glu138 and the catalytically important 
Arg118, are solvent-exposed and form a salt bridge, indicating that Glu138 might 
be critical for positioning Arg118 for catalysis. RP2 is a specific effector 
protein of Arl3. The N-terminal 34 residues and beta helix domain of RP2 are 
required for this interaction. The abilitities of RP2 to bind Arl3 and cause 
retinitis pigmentosa seem to be correlated, since both the R118H and E138G 
mutants show a drastically reduced affinity to Arl3.
