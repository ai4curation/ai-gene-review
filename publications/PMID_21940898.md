The positioning of nucleosomes within the coding regions of eukaryotic genes is 
aligned with respect to transcriptional start sites. This organization is likely 
to influence many genetic processes, requiring access to the underlying DNA. 
Here, we show that the combined action of Isw1 and Chd1 nucleosome-spacing 
enzymes is required to maintain this organization. In the absence of these 
enzymes, regular positioning of the majority of nucleosomes is lost. Exceptions 
include the region upstream of the promoter, the +1 nucleosome, and a subset of 
locations distributed throughout coding regions where other factors are likely 
to be involved. These observations indicate that adenosine 
triphosphate-dependent remodeling enzymes are responsible for directing the 
positioning of the majority of nucleosomes within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
genome.
