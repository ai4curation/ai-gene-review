The tissue-specific developmental regulation of the alpha, beta, gamma and delta 
T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) genes is controlled by the corresponding distinct 
enhancers and their enhancer-binding proteins. To find a common TCR regulatory 
element, we have studied the ability of the newly described enhancer-binding 
protein Gata3 to bind to the sequence motif (A/T)GATA(G/A) shared between 
enhancer elements of all four TCR genes. Gata3 was shown in the chicken to be an 
enhancer-binding protein containing a zinc-finger domain. We have isolated a 
full-length human Gata3 cDNA and characterized its role in TCR gene regulation. 
Northern blot analysis showed that the Gata3 mRNA is present in T-cell, but not 
B-cell, macrophage or HeLa cell lines. The in vitro transcribed and translated 
Gata3 cDNA product bound specifically to the enhancer elements of at least three 
TCR genes containing the above consensus sequence. This binding specificity was 
consistent with the in vivo activity of the TCR enhancer-binding element in 
transient transfection assays. Hence, the Gata3 protein, together with other 
T-cell-specific enhancer-binding proteins, may form the basis of tissue-specific 
expression of the TCR genes.

Abstract

The tissue-specific developmental regulation of the alpha, beta, gamma and delta T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) genes is controlled by the corresponding distinct enhancers and their enhancer-binding proteins. To find a common TCR regulatory element, we have studied the ability of the newly described enhancer-binding protein Gata3 to bind to the sequence motif (A/T)GATA(G/A) shared between enhancer elements of all four TCR genes. Gata3 was shown in the chicken to be an enhancer-binding protein containing a zinc-finger domain. We have isolated a full-length human Gata3 cDNA and characterized its role in TCR gene regulation. Northern blot analysis showed that the Gata3 mRNA is present in T-cell, but not B-cell, macrophage or HeLa cell lines. The in vitro transcribed and translated Gata3 cDNA product bound specifically to the enhancer elements of at least three TCR genes containing the above consensus sequence. This binding specificity was consistent with the in vivo activity of the TCR enhancer-binding element in transient transfection assays. Hence, the Gata3 protein, together with other T-cell-specific enhancer-binding proteins, may form the basis of tissue-specific expression of the TCR genes.
