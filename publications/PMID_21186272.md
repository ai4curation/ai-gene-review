The neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/ErbB system has emerged as a paracrine 
endothelium-controlled system in the heart, which preserves left ventricular 
(LV) performance in pathophysiological conditions. Here, we analyze the activity 
and function of this system in pregnancy, which imparts a physiological 
condition of LV hemodynamic overload. NRG1 expression and ErbB receptor 
activation were studied by Western blot analyses in rats and mice at different 
stages of pregnancy. LV performance was evaluated by transthoracic 
echocardiography, and myocardial performance was assessed from twitches of 
isolated papillary muscles. NRG1/ErbB signaling was inhibited by oral treatment 
of animals with the dual ErbB1/ErbB2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib. 
Analyses of LV tissue revealed that protein expression of different NRG1 
isoforms and levels of phosphorylated ErbB2 and ErbB4 significantly increased 
after 1-2 wk of pregnancy. Lapatinib prevented phosphorylation of ErbB2 and 
ERK1/2, but not of ErbB4 and protein kinase B (Akt), revealing that lapatinib 
only partially inhibited NRG1/ErbB signaling in the LV. Lapatinib did not 
prevent pregnancy-induced changes in LV mass and did not cause apoptotic cell 
death or fibrosis in the LV. Nevertheless, lapatinib led to premature maternal 
death of ∼25% during pregnancy and it accentuated pregnancy-induced LV 
dilatation, significantly reduced LV fractional shortening, and induced 
abnormalities of twitch relaxation (but not twitch amplitude) of isolated 
papillary muscles. This is the first study showing that the NRG1/ErbB system is 
activated, and plays a modulatory role, during physiological hemodynamic 
overload associated with pregnancy. Inhibiting this system during physiological 
overload may cause LV dysfunction in the absence of myocardial cell death.
