Chromatin remodellers are helicase-like, ATP-dependent enzymes that alter 
chromatin structure and nucleosome positions to allow regulatory proteins access 
to DNA. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of chromatin 
remodeller Switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI2/SNF2) from Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae bound to the nucleosome. The structure shows that the two core 
domains of Snf2 are realigned upon nucleosome binding, suggesting activation of 
the enzyme. The core domains contact each other through two induced Brace 
helices, which are crucial for coupling ATP hydrolysis to chromatin remodelling. 
Snf2 binds to the phosphate backbones of one DNA gyre of the nucleosome mainly 
through its helicase motifs within the major domain cleft, suggesting a 
conserved mechanism of substrate engagement across different remodellers. Snf2 
contacts the second DNA gyre via a positively charged surface, providing a 
mechanism to anchor the remodeller at a fixed position of the nucleosome. Snf2 
locally deforms nucleosomal DNA at the site of binding, priming the substrate 
for the remodelling reaction. Together, these findings provide mechanistic 
insights into chromatin remodelling.
