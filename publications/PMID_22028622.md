Searching for new strategies to bypass apoptosis resistance, we investigated the 
potential of the Smac mimetic BV6 in Jurkat leukemia cells deficient in key 
molecules of the death receptor pathway. Here, we demonstrate for the first time 
that Smac mimetic primes apoptosis-resistant, FADD- or caspase-8-deficient 
leukemia cells for TNFα-induced necroptosis in a synergistic manner. In contrast 
to TNFα, Smac mimetic significantly enhances CD95-induced apoptosis in wild-type 
but not in FADD-deficient cells. Interestingly, Smac mimetic- and TNFα-mediated 
cell death occurs without characteristic features of apoptosis (i.e., caspase 
activation, DNA fragmentation) in FADD-deficient cells. By comparison, Smac 
mimetic and TNFα trigger activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3 and DNA 
fragmentation in wild-type cells. Consistently, the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk 
fails to block Smac mimetic- and TNFα-triggered cell death in FADD- or 
caspase-8-deficient cells, while it confers protection in wild-type cells. By 
comparison, necrostatin-1, an RIP1 kinase inhibitor, abolishes Smac mimetic- and 
TNFα-induced cell death in FADD- or caspase-8-deficient. Thus, Smac mimetic 
enhances TNFα-induced cell death in leukemia cells via two distinct pathways in 
a context-dependent manner: it primes apoptosis-resistant cells lacking FADD or 
caspase-8 to TNFα-induced, RIP1-dependent and caspase-independent necroptosis, 
whereas it sensitizes apoptosis-proficient cells to TNFα-mediated, 
caspase-dependent apoptosis. These findings have important implications for the 
therapeutic exploitation of necroptosis as an alternative cell death program to 
overcome apoptosis resistance.
