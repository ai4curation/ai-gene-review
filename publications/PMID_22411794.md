Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is an essential structural constituent of caveolae, 
specialized lipid raft microdomains on the cell membrane involved in endocytosis 
and signal transduction, which are inexplicably deregulated and are associated 
with aggressiveness in numerous cancers. Here we identify CAV1 as a direct 
transcriptional target of oxygen-labile hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and 2 that 
accentuates the formation of caveolae, leading to increased dimerization of EGF 
receptor within the confined surface area of caveolae and its subsequent 
phosphorylation in the absence of ligand. Hypoxia-inducible factor-dependent 
up-regulation of CAV1 enhanced the oncogenic potential of tumor cells by 
increasing the cell proliferative, migratory, and invasive capacities. These 
results support a concept in which a crisis in oxygen availability or a tumor 
exhibiting hypoxic signature triggers caveolae formation that bypasses the 
requirement for ligand engagement to initiate receptor activation and the 
critical downstream adaptive signaling during a period when ligands required to 
activate these receptors are limited or are not yet available.

Abstract

Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is an essential structural constituent of caveolae, specialized lipid raft microdomains on the cell membrane involved in endocytosis and signal transduction, which are inexplicably deregulated and are associated with aggressiveness in numerous cancers. Here we identify CAV1 as a direct transcriptional target of oxygen-labile hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and 2 that accentuates the formation of caveolae, leading to increased dimerization of EGF receptor within the confined surface area of caveolae and its subsequent phosphorylation in the absence of ligand. Hypoxia-inducible factor–dependent up-regulation of CAV1 enhanced the oncogenic potential of tumor cells by increasing the cell proliferative, migratory, and invasive capacities. These results support a concept in which a crisis in oxygen availability or a tumor exhibiting hypoxic signature triggers caveolae formation that bypasses the requirement for ligand engagement to initiate receptor activation and the critical downstream adaptive signaling during a period when ligands required to activate these receptors are limited or are not yet available.

Discussion

Hypoxia triggers essential physiologic adaptive responses ranging from increased production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells to the formation of new blood vessels and switching cellular energy production from aerobic respiration to anaerobic glycolytic metabolism ( 32 ). These and other hypoxia-inducible biological processes are governed principally by HIF transcriptional factor that becomes active upon stabilization of the otherwise oxygen-labile HIFα subunit under hypoxia. Recently, we showed that HIF decelerates clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the early endosome sorting stage and thereby prolongs RTK-mediated signaling to promote cell survival under hypoxia ( 30 , 32 ). Here we show that CAV1, an integral structural component of caveolae, is a direct target of HIF1 and HIF2 and under hypoxia binds to and promotes ligand-independent activation of EGFR within the substantially smaller surface area of caveolae relative to the plasma membrane.

The observation that CAV1–EGFR interaction is diminished in the presence of ligand is intriguing ( Fig. 4 C ) and suggests that CAV1 may not have a significant role in RTK-mediated signaling when the availability of ligand is no longer limited. Consistent with this notion, we found robust and comparable EGFR phosphorylation irrespective of CAV1 expression level in the presence of exogenous EGF ( Fig. 4 B ). These observations suggest either that ligand-mediated clustering of EGFR on plasma membrane may hinder trafficking to caveolae or that ligand engagement triggers internalization of EGFR via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and thereby limits the accessibility of EGFR to caveolae. However, in the absence of ligand, some fraction of EGFR in the fluid cell membrane milieu localizes to the caveolae, the formation of which increases markedly under hypoxia. Thus, CAV1-mediated RTK signaling may represent a unique adaptive response triggered under a deleterious situation where the availability of oxygen is compromised and ligands required to activate certain critical adaptive responses are not yet available.

Cancer cells invariably hijack the otherwise normal physiologic responses to hypoxia to potentiate their own survival and growth. HIFα overexpression commonly associated with tumors (by virtue of the general oxygen-sensing pathway in regions of hypoxia or cancer-causing mutations in a growing list of tumor-suppressor genes such as TSC2 , PTEN , p53 , and VHL that bypass the necessity of low oxygen tension to initiate a pseudo hypoxic response) would be predicted to increase CAV1 expression to promote autoactivation of EGFR and other RTKs bound in caveolae. Intriguingly, Martinez-Outschoorn et al. ( 39 ) reported that in cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts hypoxia leads to a loss of CAV1 via autophagy, suggesting an indirect negative regulation of CAV1 that may be cell-context dependent. Furthermore, CAV1 was identified originally as an inhibitor of EGFR signaling through receptor sequestration ( 40 , 41 ). Recently, however, CAV1 has been shown to promote EGFR signaling. For example, under conditions of oxidative stress, CAV1 was shown to transport EGFR to a perinuclear location where EGFR no longer is degraded and remains active ( 42 ). CAV1-overexpressing MCF-7 breast cancer cells (MCF-7/CAV1) stimulated with EGF displayed higher EGFR signaling, with enhanced proliferative and motility rates, than seen in MCF-7 parental cells ( 43 ). These examples of differential roles of CAV1 in the regulation of EGFR also may suggest the cell context-dependent nature of CAV1 function.

The direct link between CAV1 and HIF presented herein likely explains why, in various tumors including CCRCC, CAV1 overexpression, similar to HIFα, is associated with larger tumor size, higher tumor grade and stage, resistance to conventional therapies, and poor prognosis ( 10 – 15 , 44 ). Consistent with this notion, primary CCRCC cells with a strong hypoxic signature exhibited elevated expression of CAV1 and phosphorylated ERK levels, and molecular suppression of CAV1 attenuated Ras–(C)Raf–MEK–ERK signaling, cell proliferation, and migratory capacity in the absence of ligand. Thus, the present study unveils CAV1 as an integral direct component of HIF-mediated signaling in response to tumor hypoxia or pseudohypoxia that transforms cellular architecture to drive receptor-mediated proliferative signaling in the absence of appropriate extracellular cues/ligand ( Fig. S9 C ).

Up-regulation of the EGFR signaling pathway has been observed and reported to promote tumorigenesis in CCRCC ( 45 ). We show here that HIF-dependent overexpression of CAV1 promotes EGFR signaling in CCRCC. Interestingly, gefitinib, an EGFR-specific inhibitor, inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7/CAV1 breast cancer cells more efficiently than it prohibited the proliferation of MCF-7 parental cells ( 46 ). This finding suggests that gefitinib may have beneficial effect on CCRCC displaying a CAV1 overexpression signature. Moreover, combined treatment of metastatic RCC with gefitinib and sunitinib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGF receptor (VEGFR) and PDGFR, demonstrated efficacy comparable to sunitinib monotherapy with an acceptable safety profile in a Phase I/II clinical trial ( 47 ). Notably, sunitinib, a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic RCC, has shown significant advantage over IFN-α therapy, the previous first-line therapy for metastatic RCC ( 48 ). We show here that CAV1 promotes the activation of other RTKs, such as PDGFR and IGF-1R. Thus, the efficacy of sunitinib for the treatment of metastatic RCC may be caused in part by CAV1 activation of several RTKs involved in the oncogenic processes of CCRCC.
