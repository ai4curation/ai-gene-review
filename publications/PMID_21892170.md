In eukaryotes, the essential dimeric molecular chaperone Hsp90 is required for 
the activation and maturation of specific substrates such as steroid hormone 
receptors, tyrosine kinases and transcription factors. Hsp90 is involved in the 
establishment of cancer and has become an attractive target for drug design. 
Here we present a structural characterization of the complex between Hsp90 and 
the tumor suppressor p53, a key mediator of apoptosis whose structural integrity 
is crucial for cell-cycle control. Using biophysical methods, we show that the 
human p53 DNA-binding domain interacts with multiple domains of yeast Hsp90. p53 
binds to the Hsp90 C-terminal domain in its native-like state in a 
charge-dependent manner, but it also associates weakly with binding sites in the 
middle and the N-terminal domains. The fine-tuned interplay between several 
Hsp90 domains provides the interactions required for efficient chaperoning of 
p53.
