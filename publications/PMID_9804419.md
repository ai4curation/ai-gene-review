The giant muscle protein titin (connectin) is essential in the temporal and 
spatial control of the assembly of the highly ordered sarcomeres (contractile 
units) of striated muscle. Here we present the crystal structure of titin's only 
catalytic domain, an autoregulated serine kinase (titin kinase). The structure 
shows how the active site is inhibited by a tyrosine of the kinase domain. We 
describe a dual mechanism of activation of titin kinase that consists of 
phosphorylation of this tyrosine and binding of calcium/calmodulin to the 
regulatory tail. The serine kinase domain of titin is the first known 
non-arginine-aspartate kinase to be activated by phosphorylation. The 
phosphorylated tyrosine is not located in the activation segment, as in other 
kinases, but in the P + 1 loop, indicating that this tyrosine is a binding 
partner of the titin kinase substrate. Titin kinase phosphorylates the muscle 
protein telethonin in early differentiating myocytes, indicating that this 
kinase may act in myofibrillogenesis.
