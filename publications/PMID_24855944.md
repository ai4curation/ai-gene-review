TRPM7 is a ubiquitous ion channel and kinase, a unique "chanzyme," required for 
proper early embryonic development. It conducts Zn(2+), Mg(2+), and Ca(2+) as 
well as monovalent cations and contains a functional serine/threonine kinase at 
its carboxyl terminus. Here, we show that in normal tissues and cell lines, the 
kinase is proteolytically cleaved from the channel domain in a 
cell-type-specific manner. These TRPM7 cleaved kinase fragments (M7CKs) 
translocate to the nucleus and bind multiple components of chromatin-remodeling 
complexes, including Polycomb group proteins. In the nucleus, the kinase 
phosphorylates specific serines/threonines of histones. M7CK-dependent 
phosphorylation of H3Ser10 at promoters of TRPM7-dependent genes correlates with 
their activity. We also demonstrate that cytosolic free [Zn(2+)] is TRPM7 
dependent and regulates M7CK binding to transcription factors containing 
zinc-finger domains. These findings suggest that TRPM7-mediated modulation of 
intracellular Zn(2+) concentration couples ion-channel signaling to epigenetic 
chromatin covalent modifications that affect gene expression patterns.
