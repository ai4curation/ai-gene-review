Extracellular signals regulate protein translation in many cell functions. A key 
advantage of control at the translational level is the opportunity to regulate 
protein synthesis within specific cellular subregions. However, little is known 
about mechanisms that may link extracellular cues to translation with spatial 
precision. Here, we show that a transmembrane receptor, DCC, forms a binding 
complex containing multiple translation components, including eukaryotic 
initiation factors, ribosomal large and small subunits, and monosomes. In 
neuronal axons and dendrites DCC colocalizes in particles with translation 
machinery, and newly synthesized protein. The extracellular ligand netrin 
promoted DCC-mediated translation and disassociation of translation components. 
The functional and physical association of a cell surface receptor with the 
translation machinery leads to a generalizable model for localization and 
extracellular regulation of protein synthesis, based on a transmembrane 
translation regulation complex.
