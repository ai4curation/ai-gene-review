The basal level of the tumor suppressor p53 is regulated by MDM2-mediated 
ubiquitination at specific lysines, which leads to p53 nuclear export and 
degradation. Upon p53 activation, however, these lysines become acetylated by 
p300/CREB-binding protein. Here we have reported an unexpected finding that 
p300-mediated acetylation also regulates p53 subcellular localization and can 
promote cytoplasmic localization of p53. This activity is independent of MDM2 
but requires a p53 nuclear export signal and acetylation of multiple lysines by 
p300. Mechanistically, we showed that conversion of a minimal four of these 
lysines to alanines but not arginines mimics p300-mediated p53 nuclear export, 
and these lysine-neutralizing mutations effectively prevent p53 tetramerization, 
thus exposing the oligomerization-regulated nuclear export signal. Our study 
suggested a threshold mechanism whereby the degree of acetylation regulates p53 
nucleus-cytoplasm trafficking by neutralizing a lysine-dependent charge patch, 
which in turn, controls oligomerization-dependent p53 nuclear export.
