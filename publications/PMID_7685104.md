The substrate specificity of a recombinant protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) 
was probed using synthetic phosphotyrosine-containing peptides corresponding to 
several of the autophosphorylation sites in epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR). The peptide corresponding to the autophosphorylation site, EGFR988-998, 
was chosen for further study due to its favorable kinetic constants. The 
contribution of individual amino acid side chains to the binding and catalysis 
was ascertained utilizing a strategy in which each amino acid within the 
undecapeptide EGFR988-998 (DADEpYLIPQQG) was sequentially substituted by an Ala 
residue (Ala-scan). The resulting effects due to singular Ala substitution were 
assessed by kinetic analysis with two widely divergent homogeneous PTPases. A 
"consensus sequence" for PTPase recognition may be suggested from the Ala-scan 
data as DADEpYAAPA, and the presence of acidic residues proximate to the 
NH2-terminal side of phosphorylation is critical for high-affinity binding and 
catalysis. The Km value for EGFR988-998 decreased as the pH increased, 
suggesting that phosphate dianion is favored for substrate binding. The results 
demonstrate that chemical features in the primary structure surrounding the 
dephosphorylation site contribute to PTPase substrate specificity.

Abstract

The substrate specificity of a recombinant protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) was probed using synthetic phosphotyrosine-containing peptides corresponding to several of the autophosphorylation sites in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The peptide corresponding to the autophosphorylation site, EGFR988-998, was chosen for further study due to its favorable kinetic constants. The contribution of individual amino acid side chains to the binding and catalysis was ascertained utilizing a strategy in which each amino acid within the undecapeptide EGFR988-998 (DADEpYLIPQQG) was sequentially substituted by an Ala residue (Ala-scan). The resulting effects due to singular Ala substitution were assessed by kinetic analysis with two widely divergent homogeneous PTPases. A "consensus sequence" for PTPase recognition may be suggested from the Ala-scan data as DADEpYAAPA, and the presence of acidic residues proximate to the NH2-terminal side of phosphorylation is critical for high-affinity binding and catalysis. The Km value for EGFR988-998 decreased as the pH increased, suggesting that phosphate dianion is favored for substrate binding. The results demonstrate that chemical features in the primary structure surrounding the dephosphorylation site contribute to PTPase substrate specificity.
