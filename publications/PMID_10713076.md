DAX-1 is an unusual member of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) superfamily. 
Lack of DAX-1-mediated silencing leads to adrenal hypoplasia congenita and 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Gene silencing through NHRs such as the thyroid 
hormone receptor (TR) is mediated by corepressors. We have previously 
characterized a novel corepressor, termed Alien, which interacts with TR and the 
ecdysone receptor but not with the retinoic acid receptors RAR or RXR. Here, we 
show that DAX-1 interacts with the corepressor Alien but not with the 
corepressor SMRT. This interaction is mediated by the DAX-1-silencing domain. 
Naturally occurring mutants of the DAX-1 gene fail to interact with Alien and 
have lost silencing function. Because the silencing domain of DAX-1 is unusual 
for NHRs, we mapped the interaction of Alien with DAX-1 and with TR. We show 
that Alien exhibits different binding characteristics to DAX-1 and TR. 
Furthermore, Northern experiments demonstrate that Alien is expressed in the 
adrenal gland and testis in tissues where DAX-1 is specifically expressed. 
Interestingly, a novel adrenal gland-specific mRNA of Alien was discovered. 
Thus, the impairment of Alien binding seems to play an important role in the 
pathogenesis mediated by DAX-1 mutants.
