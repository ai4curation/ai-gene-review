The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is a regulatory component of some key signalling 
proteins in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. For some of these functions, its 
interaction with co-chaperones is required. Limited proteolysis defined stable 
folded units of Hsp90. Both an N-terminal (N210) and a C-terminal (262C) 
fragment interact with non-native substrate proteins in vitro, but with 
different specificity and ATP dependence. Here, we analysed the functional 
properties of these Hsp90 fragments in vivo and in vitro. We determined their 
influence on the general viability and cell growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 
Expression of N210 or 262C resulted in a dominant-negative phenotype in several 
yeast strains tested. Their expression was not toxic, but inhibited cell growth. 
Further, both were unable to restore viability to Hsp90-depleted cells. In 
addition, N210 and 262C influence the maturation of Hsp90 substrates, such as 
the glucocorticoid receptor and pp60v-Src kinase. Specifically, 262C forms 
partially active chaperone complexes, leading to an arrest of the chaperoned 
substrate at a certain stage of its maturation cycle. This demonstrates the 
requirement of a sophisticated and cofactor-regulated interplay between N- and 
C-terminal activities for Hsp90 function in vivo.
