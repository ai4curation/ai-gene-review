Macrophages are fundamental for initiation, maintenance, and resolution of 
inflammation. They can be activated by 'Toll-like receptor' (TLR) engagement, 
which initiates critical pathways to fight infections. 'Interleukin 
receptor-associated kinase 2' (IRAK2) is part of the membrane-proximal Myddosome 
formed at IL-1R/TLRs, but utility and regulation of IRAK2 within is not 
completely understood. In this study, we addressed the importance of the 
evolutionary conserved extreme C-terminus of IRAK2 in TLR signaling. The last 55 
amino acids lack any known functional domain. The C-terminus deletion mutant 
IRAK2Δ55 was hypofunctional and disabled to conduct TLR4-inducible NF-κB and 
ERK2 activation. Accordingly, it could neither fully support subsequent CD40 
cell surface expression nor IL-6 and nitric oxide release. Interestingly, 
IRAK2Δ55 was still capable to bind to 'tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated 
factor 6' (TRAF6), which is requisite to activate TRAF6 as an E3-ubiquitin 
ligase for further downstream signaling. However, IRAK-dependent 
auto-ubiquitination of TRAF6 was impaired, when IRAK2Δ55 was bound. Thus, the 
conserved last 55 amino acids enable IRAK2 to sustain an optimal TLR response. 
This knowledge might spark ideas how overshooting inflammatory responses could 
be modified without blocking the entire immune response.
