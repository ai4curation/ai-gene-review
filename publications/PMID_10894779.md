p53 plays an essential pro-apoptotic role, a function thought to be shared with 
its family members p73 and p63. Here, we show that p73 is primarily present in 
developing neurons as a truncated isoform whose levels are dramatically 
decreased when sympathetic neurons apoptose after nerve growth factor (NGF) 
withdrawal. Increased expression of truncated p73 rescues these neurons from 
apoptosis induced by NGF withdrawal or p53 overexpression. In p73-/- mice, all 
isoforms of p73 are deleted and the apoptosis of developing sympathetic neurons 
is greatly enhanced. Thus, truncated p73 is an essential anti-apoptotic protein 
in neurons, serving to counteract the pro-apoptotic function of p53.
