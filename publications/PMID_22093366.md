Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase specialized in the addition of telomeric 
DNA repeats onto the ends of chromosomes. Telomere extension offsets the loss of 
telomeric repeats from the failure of DNA polymerases to fully replicate linear 
chromosome ends. Telomerase functions as a ribonucleoprotein, requiring an 
integral telomerase RNA (TR) component, in addition to the catalytic telomerase 
reverse transcriptase (TERT). Extensive studies have identified numerous 
structural and functional features within the TR and TERT essential for 
activity. A number of accessory proteins have also been identified with various 
functions in enzyme biogenesis, localization, and regulation. Understanding the 
molecular mechanism of telomerase function has significance for the development 
of therapies for telomere-mediated disorders and cancer. Here we review 
telomerase structural and functional features, and the techniques for assessing 
telomerase dysfunction.
