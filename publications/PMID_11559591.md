Human Mediator complexes have been described as important bridging factors that 
enhance the effect of activators in purified systems and in chromatin. Here we 
report a novel basal function of a human Mediator complex. A monoclonal antibody 
was generated that depleted the majority of Mediator components from crude cell 
extracts. The removal of human Mediator abolished transcription by RNA 
polymerase II. This was observed on all genes tested, on TATA-containing and 
TATA-less promoters, both in the presence and absence of activators. To identify 
the relevant complex a combined biochemical and immunopurification protocol was 
applied. Two variants termed Mediator and basal Mediator were functionally and 
structurally distinguished. Basal Mediator function relies on additional 
constraints, which is reflected in the observation that it is essential in crude 
but not in purified systems. We conclude that basal Mediator is a novel general 
transcription factor of RNA polymerase II.
