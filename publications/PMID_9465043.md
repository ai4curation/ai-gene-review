The abundant molecular chaperone Hsp90 is a key regulator of protein structure 
in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. Although under physiological conditions a 
specific subset of proteins is substrate for Hsp90, under stress conditions 
Hsp90 seems to perform more general functions. However, the underlying mechanism 
of Hsp90 remained enigmatic. Here, we analyzed the function of conserved Hsp90 
domains. We show that Hsp90 possesses two chaperone sites located in the N- and 
C-terminal fragments, respectively. The C-terminal fragment binds to partially 
folded proteins in an ATP-independent way potentially regulated by cochaperones. 
The N-terminal domain contains a peptide binding site that seems to bind 
preferentially peptides longer than 10 amino acids. Peptide dissociation is 
induced by ATP binding. Furthermore, the antitumor drug geldanamycin both 
inhibits the weak ATPase of Hsp90 and stimulates peptide release. We propose 
that the existence of two functionally different chaperone sites together with a 
substrate-selecting set of cochaperones allows Hsp90 to guide the folding of a 
subset of target proteins and, at the same time, to exhibit general chaperone 
functions.
