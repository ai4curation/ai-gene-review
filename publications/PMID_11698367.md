The periplasm of Escherichia coli contains many proteins proposed to have 
redundant functions in protein folding. Using depletion analysis, we directly 
demonstrated that null mutations in skp and surA, as well as in degP and surA, 
result in synthetic phenotypes, suggesting that Skp, SurA, and DegP are 
functionally redundant. The Deltaskp surA::kan combination has a bacteriostatic 
effect and leads to filamentation, while the degP::Tn10 surA::kan combination is 
bactericidal. The steady-state levels of several envelope proteins are greatly 
reduced upon depletion of a wild-type copy of surA in both instances. We suggest 
that the functional redundancy of Skp, SurA, and DegP lies in the periplasmic 
chaperone activity. Taken together, our data support a model in which the 
periplasm of E. coli contains parallel pathways for chaperone activity. In 
particular, we propose that Skp and DegP are components of the same pathway and 
that SurA is a component of a separate pathway. The loss of either pathway has 
minimal effects on the cell, while the loss of both pathways results in the 
synthetic phenotypes observed.
