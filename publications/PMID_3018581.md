Tissue-specific expression of the human tropomyosin gene involved in the 
generation of the trk oncogene.

Reinach FC, MacLeod AR.

The trk oncogene is a human transforming gene generated by the fusion of 
tropomyosin gene sequence to a truncated tyrosine kinase receptor gene. We have 
now characterized the normal tropomyosin gene from which the trk oncogene is 
derived. At least two different transcripts are expressed by this gene using a 
tissue-specific alternative messenger RNA splicing mechanism: a 2.5-kilobase 
(kb) mRNA encoding a 248-amino-acid tropomyosin in human fibroblasts and a 
1.3-kb mRNA encoding a 285-amino-acid tropomyosin in human skeletal muscle. The 
rearrangement which generates the trk oncogene preserves most of the 
tropomyosin-coding sequences of the normal gene, including exons alternatively 
spliced in muscle and non-muscle tissue. We therefore expect the trk oncogene to 
show a tissue-specific pattern of transforming activity. Correct expression of 
the trk oncogene can occur only in non-muscle tissues. In muscle tissue the 
oncogene would almost certainly be inactive, as splicing according to the 
alternative muscle pattern aborts synthesis of the tyrosine kinase domain.
