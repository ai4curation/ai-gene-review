## Abstract

Ca2+-mediated association of glycoprotein G (thrombinsensitive protein, 
thrombospondin) with human platelets.

Phillips DR, Jennings LK, Prasanna HR.

Washed human platelets suspended in buffers containing either 1.8 mM Ca2+ and 
0.49 mM Mg2+ or 1 mM EDTA were treated with human alpha-thrombin to induce 
secretion. Glycoprotein G, a major glycoprotein in alpha-granules, was 
quantitatively secreted from platelets activated in the EDTA-containing buffer 
but remained with the platelet in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+. Addition of 
Ca2+ to the platelets that were activated in the presence of EDTA caused 
glycoprotein G to bind to platelets. To determine if glycoprotein G is expressed 
on the membrane surface of the activated platelet, platelets were rapidly 
labeled by a method employing lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination. Although 
glycoprotein G was barely detected on the surface of unstimulated platelets, 
labveling 1 min after thrombin treatment showed that glycoprotein G rapidly 
became one of the prominent surface proteins. These findings show that an 
alpha-granule protein, glycoprotein G, is one of the major glycoproteins on the 
membrane surface of thrombin-activated platelets and that its binding is 
dependent on divalent cations.
