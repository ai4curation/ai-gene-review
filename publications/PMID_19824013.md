The opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans causes a wide variety 
of infections including deep systemic syndromes. The C. albicans plasma membrane 
is an important interface in the host-pathogen relationship. The plasma membrane 
proteins mediate a variety of functions, including sensing and signalling to the 
external environment, in which the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored 
membrane proteins play a crucial role. A subproteomic approach to obtain a 
global picture of the protein composition of the C. albicans plasma membrane was 
developed, and different strategies were tested in order to extract the largest 
number of yeast plasma membrane proteins and GPI-anchored membrane proteins. 
These methods involved: (i) protoplast generation, (ii) mechanical disruption, 
(iii) ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients, and (iv) Na(2)CO(3) treatments. 
To isolate GPI-anchored proteins two additional steps were performed: two-phase 
separation and phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C treatment. After LC-MS/MS 
analysis using both a MALDI-TOF/TOF and a linear ion trap quadrupole, a total of 
214 membrane proteins were identified, including 41 already described as plasma 
membrane proteins, 20 plasma membrane associated proteins, and 22 proteins with 
unknown membrane localisation. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that this set of 
C. albicans membrane proteins is highly enriched in proteins involved in 
biopolymer biosynthesis or transport processes. Furthermore, after 
phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C treatment, 12 GPI-anchored membrane 
proteins were released and identified; most of them are associated with cell 
wall beta-glucan synthesis and maintenance or are virulence factors, such as 
phospholipases or aspartyl proteinases.
