Bloom's syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by increased incidence of 
cancer and an immunodeficiency of unknown origin. The BLM gene mutated in 
Bloom's syndrome encodes a DNA helicase involved in the maintenance of genomic 
integrity. To explore the role of BLM in the immune system, we ablated murine 
Blm in the T-cell lineage. In the absence of Blm, thymocytes were severely 
reduced in numbers and displayed a developmental block at the beta-selection 
checkpoint that was partially p53 dependent. Blm-deficient thymocytes rearranged 
their T-cell receptor (TCR) beta genes normally yet failed to survive and 
proliferate in response to pre-TCR signaling. Furthermore, peripheral T cells 
were reduced in numbers, manifested defective homeostatic and TCR-induced 
proliferation, and produced extensive chromosomal damage. Finally, CD4(+) and 
CD8(+) T-cell responses were impaired upon antigen challenge. Thus, by ensuring 
genomic stability, Blm serves a vital role for development, maintenance, and 
function of T lymphocytes, suggesting a basis for the immune deficiency in 
Bloom's syndrome.
