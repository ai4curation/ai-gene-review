VPS33B and VIPAR comprise the two known components of the recently christened 
class C Homologues in Endosome-Vesicle Interaction (CHEVI) complex, thought to 
act as a tethering complex in endosomal trafficking distinct from the HOPS and 
CORVET complexes in mammalian cells. A recent paper in The Journal of Pathology 
further explores the role of the CHEVI complex in the biogenesis of α-granules 
in megakaryocytes, identifying two novel interactors of this complex: α-tubulin 
and SEC22B, and demonstrating that VPS33B expression is required for the 
localization of SEC22B and the α-granule cargo VWF to proplatelets in 
megakaryocytes. These findings advance the current knowledge of the function of 
the CHEVI complex in α-granule biogenesis and together with studies in other 
systems, corroborate its role in the specialized delivery of cargo in different 
cell types. Copyright © 2016 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.
