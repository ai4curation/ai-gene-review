The interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) is required for the 
IL-1-induced activation of nuclear factor kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. 
The goal of this study was to understand how IRAK activates the intermediate 
proteins TRAF6, TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2. When IRAK is phosphorylated in response to 
IL-1, it binds to the membrane where it forms a complex with TRAF6; TRAF6 then 
dissociates and translocates to the cytosol. The membrane-bound IRAK similarly 
mediates the IL-1-induced translocation of TAB2 from the membrane to the 
cytosol. Different regions of IRAK are required for the translocation of TAB2 
and TRAF6, suggesting that IRAK mediates the translocation of each protein 
separately. The translocation of TAB2 and TRAF6 is needed to form a 
TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex in the cytosol and thus activate TAK1. Our results 
show that IRAK is required for the IL-1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, 
and TAB2. The phosphorylation of these three proteins correlates strongly with 
the activation of nuclear factor kappaB but is not necessary to activate c-Jun 
N-terminal kinase.
