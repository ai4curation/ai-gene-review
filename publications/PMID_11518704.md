The interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) is required for the 
IL-1-induced activation of nuclear factor kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. 
The goal of this study was to understand how IRAK activates the intermediate 
proteins TRAF6, TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2. When IRAK is phosphorylated in response to 
IL-1, it binds to the membrane where it forms a complex with TRAF6; TRAF6 then 
dissociates and translocates to the cytosol. The membrane-bound IRAK similarly 
mediates the IL-1-induced translocation of TAB2 from the membrane to the 
cytosol. Different regions of IRAK are required for the translocation of TAB2 
and TRAF6, suggesting that IRAK mediates the translocation of each protein 
separately. The translocation of TAB2 and TRAF6 is needed to form a 
TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex in the cytosol and thus activate TAK1. Our results 
show that IRAK is required for the IL-1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, 
and TAB2. The phosphorylation of these three proteins correlates strongly with 
the activation of nuclear factor kappaB but is not necessary to activate c-Jun 
N-terminal kinase.

1.IntroductionTDP-43 pathology occurs in multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Chen-Plotkin et al., 2010; Mackenzie et al., 2010; Ling et al., 2013; Weskamp et al., 2020), and has been characterized extensively in neurons as a key pathogenic hallmark and driver of disease-associated cascades and functional impairments. In animal and cell culture models, neuronal TDP-43 mislocalization, deficiency, or mutations can lead to multiple pathological changes and deficits (Wegorzewska et al., 2009; Shan et al., 2010; Stallings et al., 2010; Wils et al., 2010; Igaz et al., 2011). Among its various effects, neuronal TDP-43 pathology alters the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and causes nucleocytoplasmic disruptions, including mislocalization of nucleoporins (NUPs), aberrations in nuclear envelope structure, and dysregulation of nucleocytoplasmic protein transport (Chou et al., 2018; Aizawa et al., 2022). TDP-43 pathology in neurons has also been associated with stress granules (Colombrita et al., 2009; Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2010), which can disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport (Zhang et al., 2018). Together, these processes contribute to neuronal dysfunction associated with neurodegenerative disease (Chou et al., 2018; Frost et al., 2016; Coyne et al., 2021).Although previous research on TDP-43 has focused mainly on neurons, TDP-43 is expressed ubiquitously, and TDP-43 dysfunction can affect glial cells, including astrocytes, which play central roles in brain function, neuroinflammation, and dementia-associated pathogenesis (Brandebura et al., 2023; Khakh and Goldman, 2023; Patani et al., 2023; Zimmer et al., 2024). Astrocytic TDP-43 pathology is detected in FTD, ALS, AD, and a subset of aging individuals (Weskamp et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2017; Carlos et al., 2023; Licht-Murava et al., 2023), and can promote motor defects and cognitive decline in animal models (Licht-Murava et al., 2023; Tong et al., 2013; Peng et al., 2020), at least in part through cell-autonomous effects on astrocyte function (Licht-Murava et al., 2023; Serio et al., 2013). In particular, astrocytes can exhibit diffuse cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 in dementia (Licht-Murava et al., 2023), and alterations in TDP-43 can affect neuroimmune signaling (Licht-Murava et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2015; LaRocca et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020), which is implicated in aging and disease.

Introduction

TDP-43 pathology occurs in multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Chen-Plotkin et al., 2010; Mackenzie et al., 2010; Ling et al., 2013; Weskamp et al., 2020), and has been characterized extensively in neurons as a key pathogenic hallmark and driver of disease-associated cascades and functional impairments. In animal and cell culture models, neuronal TDP-43 mislocalization, deficiency, or mutations can lead to multiple pathological changes and deficits (Wegorzewska et al., 2009; Shan et al., 2010; Stallings et al., 2010; Wils et al., 2010; Igaz et al., 2011). Among its various effects, neuronal TDP-43 pathology alters the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and causes nucleocytoplasmic disruptions, including mislocalization of nucleoporins (NUPs), aberrations in nuclear envelope structure, and dysregulation of nucleocytoplasmic protein transport (Chou et al., 2018; Aizawa et al., 2022). TDP-43 pathology in neurons has also been associated with stress granules (Colombrita et al., 2009; Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2010), which can disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport (Zhang et al., 2018). Together, these processes contribute to neuronal dysfunction associated with neurodegenerative disease (Chou et al., 2018; Frost et al., 2016; Coyne et al., 2021).

Although previous research on TDP-43 has focused mainly on neurons, TDP-43 is expressed ubiquitously, and TDP-43 dysfunction can affect glial cells, including astrocytes, which play central roles in brain function, neuroinflammation, and dementia-associated pathogenesis (Brandebura et al., 2023; Khakh and Goldman, 2023; Patani et al., 2023; Zimmer et al., 2024). Astrocytic TDP-43 pathology is detected in FTD, ALS, AD, and a subset of aging individuals (Weskamp et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2017; Carlos et al., 2023; Licht-Murava et al., 2023), and can promote motor defects and cognitive decline in animal models (Licht-Murava et al., 2023; Tong et al., 2013; Peng et al., 2020), at least in part through cell-autonomous effects on astrocyte function (Licht-Murava et al., 2023; Serio et al., 2013). In particular, astrocytes can exhibit diffuse cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 in dementia (Licht-Murava et al., 2023), and alterations in TDP-43 can affect neuroimmune signaling (Licht-Murava et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2015; LaRocca et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020), which is implicated in aging and disease. However, the exact effects of TDP-43 pathology on glial cells are not clear. Notably, nucleocytoplasmic changes and stress granule formation have been largely unexplored in glia, and putative links between these changes and neuroimmune signaling require investigation.

Here, we examined how astrocytes are affected by TDP-43 pathology using isolated mouse astrocytes, human iPSC-derived astrocytes, and transgenic mouse models in combination with molecular manipulations and high-resolution single-cell confocal imaging to define specific signaling pathways. We report that mouse cortical astrocytes with TDP-43 dysregulation have multiple nucleocytoplasmic alterations, including mislocalization of nucleoporin NUP-98, changes in nuclear membrane structure, and defects in nucleocytoplasmic protein transport. These effects are similarly evident in mouse models with chronic TDP-43 proteinopathy or acute inflammation and are recapitulated in human iPSC-derived cortical astrocytes heterozygous for a disease-associated mutation in TDP-43. These changes are rapid and reversible, and mediated by interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors and NF-ÎºB signaling. Furthermore, the induction of nucleocytoplasmic changes by TDP-43 pathology and IL-1 receptors are associated with the formation of stress granules and these multiple changes can be suppressed by inhibitors of integrated stress responses.

Together, our findings establish that neuroimmune pathways mediate astrocytic responses to TDP-43 dysregulation by promoting stress granule formation and downstream nucleocytoplasmic alterations, suggesting that proteostasis and innate immune pathways regulate nucleocytoplasmic processes through convergent effects on stress signaling mechanisms.

2.Materials and methods2.1.AnimalsAll experiments using mice were conducted in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Weill Cornell Medicine guidelines. Mice were housed in groups of 2â5 mice per cage and were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Astrocyte-specific expression of mutant human TDP-43 was achieved using transgenic hGFAP-tTA mice with a tet-off tetracycline transactivator (tTA) element downstream of the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter (kindly provided by Dr. Lennart Mucke, Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA) (Orr et al., 2015).hGFAP-tTA mice (B6.Cg-Tg(GFAP-tTA)110Pop/J; Jackson Laboratory strain #005964) were crossed with tetO-hTDP43-ÎNLS mice (B6; C3-Tg(tetO-TARDBP*)4Vle/J; Jackson Laboratory strain #014650), which express a tet operator (tetO) sequence upstream of the human TARDBP gene with a mutated nuclear localization sequence (tetO-hTDP43-ÎNLS), leading to expression of human TDP-43 in the cytoplasm (Igaz et al., 2011). In doubly transgenic mice (referred to as ÎNLS mice), doxycycline (DOX) can bind to tTA to prevent tetO-mediated expression of hTDP43-ÎNLS. Breeding pairs and offspring until weaning age (P21) were provided with doxycycline-supplemented chow (200 mg/kg, VWR, 89067â462) to prevent expression of transgene during embryonic and postnatal development. Because the parent tetO-hTDP43-ÎNLS strain was on a B6/C3 hybrid background, we backcrossed this line onto the C57Bl/6 J background (Jackson Laboratory strain #000664) for over five generations.Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member L1 (Aldh1l1)-Cre transgenic mice (B6;FVB-Tg(Aldh1l1-cre)JD1884Htz/J) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (strain #023748) and backcrossed onto the C57Bl/6 J background. Aldh1l1-Cre mice express Cre recombinase downstream of the astrocytic Aldh1l1 promoter, allowing for astrocyte-specific expression of Cre-dependent constructs using transduction.2.2.Primary astrocyte culturesAll cultured cells were maintained at 37 Â°C in a humidified 5 % CO2-containing atmosphere. Prior to culture, cell culture dishes were coated with poly-d-lysine (75â150 kDa, 0.01 % in water, filtered; Sigma #P6407 or MP Biomedical #0215017580) for at least 2 h, and coated culture dishes were washed twice with PBS and once with water before drying completely. Mouse primary cortical astrocytes were obtained by dissecting cortices from wild-type (WT) (C57BI/6 J, Jackson Laboratory strain #000664) or hemizygous doubly transgenic ÎNLS pups at postnatal day 1â5 in cold PBS. Meninges were removed and cells were dissociated manually by trituration with a P1000 pipette in 1 ml fresh culture media consisting of high-glucose DMEM (Corning), 20 % tetracycline-depleted and heat-inactivated FBS (VWR #97065â310), 1Ã GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher #35050061), and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Thermo Scientific). Cell suspensions were diluted with media and filtered through a 70 Î¼m cell strainer (VWR). The resulting suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 300g, and the cell pellet was resuspended with fresh culture media and plated into cell culture dishes. At DIV 4â5, the cells were washed to remove debris and fresh culture media was added.WT and ÎNLS astrocyte cultures contain 98.8 % Â± 0.4 % (SE) astrocytes and 1.2 % Â± 0.4 % (SE) microglia (Licht-Murava et al., 2023), based on immunolabeling for GFAP, Iba1, NeuN, and DAPI and imaging using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S microscope with a Nikon PlanFluor 10Ã objective and NIS-Elements BR v5.02.01 acquisition software. ÎNLS cultures were determined to express hTDP-43 in 47.8 Â± 4.7 % (SE) of astrocytes when cultured with primary astrocyte media supplemented with tetracycline-negative FBS, based on immunolabeling for hTDP-43 and GFAP (Licht-Murava et al., 2023).2.3.Human iPSC maintenance and differentiationAll human iPSC cultures and differentiations were maintained at 37 Â°C in a humidified 5 % CO2 atmosphere. Isogenic control and TDP-43-Q331K heterozygous mutant lines were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (JAX #JIPSC1000, #JIPSC1066) and were maintained in Essential 8 media (ThermoFisher #A1517001) on cell culture dishes coated with vitronectin (5 Î¼g/ml in PBS, ThermoFisher #A31804). iPSCs were passaged using EDTA solution (0.5 mM in PBS, VWR #MT-46034CI). Y-27632 dihydrochloride (10 Î¼M, MedChemExpress #HY-10583) was added to media during passaging and thawing to prevent cell death. Cells were frozen in Stem-Cell Banker (AMSBIO #11890) using Mr. Frosty Freezing Containers (ThermoFisher #5100â0001) before long-term storage in liquid nitrogen.Human iPSCs were differentiated into mature cortical astrocytes as previously described (Tchieu et al., 2019). Specifically, iPSCs were dissociated with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies #AT104â500) into a single-cell suspension before plating at a density of 300,000 cells/cm2 in Essential 8 media (ThermoFisher # A1517001) supplemented with Y-27632 dihydochloride (MedChemExpress #HY-10583) onto Matrigel (VWR #BD354277) coated culture dishes. For days 0â2 of differentiation, cells were maintained in Essential 6 media (ThermoFisher #A1516401) supplemented with SB-431542 (10 Î¼M, R&D #1614/10), LDN-193189 (100 nM, StemGent #04â0074), and XAV-939 (2 Î¼M, StemGent #3748/10).For days 3â9 of differentiation, cells were maintained in Essential 6 medium supplemented with SB-431542 (10 Î¼M) and LDN-193189 (100 nM). For days 9â19 of differentiation, cells were maintained in a 1:1 ratio of Neurobasal media (Fisher Scientific #21103049) and DMEM/F-12 media (ThermoFisher #11320033) supplemented with 1Ã B27 supplement without vitamin A (ThermoFisher #12587010), 1Ã N2 supplement (ThermoFisher #17502048), and Penicillin-Streptomycin (ThermoFisher #15140122).On day 20 of differentiation, cells were passaged using Accutase and plated at a density of 100 K/cm2 in Neurobasal media supplemented with 1Ã GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher), Penicillin-Streptomycin, B27 supplement without vitamin A, recombinant human BDNF protein (R&D #248-BDB), recombinant human GDNF protein (PeproTech #450â10), dbcAMP (Sigma #D0627), and l-Ascorbic Acid (Sigma #A4403) on cell culture plates coated with poly-L-ornithine hydrobromide (Sigma #P3655) overnight, then coated overnight in mouse laminin protein (R&D #3400â010-02) and human fibronectin protein (R&D #1918-FN-02 M).On day 21 of differentiation, cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding NFIA and m2rtTA to induce astrocytic differentiation (Tchieu et al., 2019). On days 22â28 of differentiation, doxycycline (1 mg/ml, Millipore Sigma #D9891) was added to culture media every other day. On day 29, cells were passaged at a density of 75,000/cm2 onto poly-ornithine, laminin, and fibronectin-coated cell culture dishes in ScienCell Astrocyte Medium (ScienCell #1801).Cells were passaged as needed and maintained until day 34 of differentiation, when they were fed with DMEM/F-12 media (ThermoFisher) supplemented with 1Ã N2 supplement (ThermoFisher), sodium pyruvate (1 mM, Thermo Scientific), GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (5 Î¼g/ml, Millipore Sigma #A9165), and HB-EGF (10 ng/ml, R&D #259-HE). Cells were cultured until day 60 when astrocytes were used for experiments.2.4.ImmunocytochemistryAll steps were performed at ambient temperature unless specified otherwise. Briefly, cells were fixed on glass coverslips (Warner Instruments #64â0712) with 4 % paraformaldehyde and PBS for 10 min on ice, rinsed three times with PBS (Corning), and blocked and permeabilized in 5 % normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 0.3 % Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with the following primary antibodies diluted in 5 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) or 5 % normal donkey serum, in 0.3 % Triton X-100 in PBS: pan-specific mouse anti-TDP-43 (1:500; R&D Systems #MAB7778; RRID #AB_2920573), pan-specific rabbit anti-TDP-43 (1:1000; ProteinTech #10782â2-AP; RRID #AB_615042), human-specific mouse anti-TDP-43 (1:500; clone 6H6E12; ProteinTech #60019â2-Ig; RRID #AB_2200520), mouse biotin-anti-GFAP (1:1000; Millipore-Sigma #MAB3402B; RRID #AB_10917109), rabbit anti-NUP-98 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technologies #2598S; RRID #AB_2267700), rabbit anti-lamin B1 (1:500; Abcam #ab16048; RRID #AB_443298), rabbit anti-dsRed and mCherry (1:500; Takara Bio #632496; RRID #AB_10013483), mouse anti-RFP (1:500; ThermoFisher #MA5â15257; RRID #AB_10999796), chicken anti-GFAP (1:500; Abcam #ab4674; RRID #AB_304558), and goat anti-lipocalin-2 (1:500; R&D Systems #AF1857; RRID #AB_355022).Cells were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich #D9542) and the following AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000; ThermoFisher #A78948, #A31570, #A21202, #A32794, #A78949, #A31572, #A21447, #A31571, #A31573; RRID #AB_2534117, AB_2536180, AB_141607, AB_2762834, AB_2921071, AB_162543, AB_2535864, AB_162542, AB_2536183) diluted in 5 % BSA or 5 % normal donkey serum and 0.3 % Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were protected from light in all subsequent steps. Coverslips were rinsed twice with PBS, then mounted on Superfrost glass slides (VWR #75799â266) with Vectashield antifade media (VWR #103881â218). Slides were allowed to set overnight before image acquisition.2.5.ImmunohistochemistryMice were anesthetized with Avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol, 400â600 mg/kg body weight, Acros Organics) and transcardially perfused for 2.5 min with 0.9 % saline. Hemibrains were isolated, drop-fixed (4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS) overnight at 4 Â°C on a rocking platform, and infused with cryoprotectant (30 % sucrose in PBS) for at least 48 h prior to sectioning (30 Î¼m-thick sagittal sections) using a SM2010R sliding microtome (Leica) equipped with a BFS-3MP freezing stage and cooling unit (Physitemp, Clifton, NJ). Free-floating sections were stored in cryopreservative (30 % ethylene glycol, 30 % glycerol in PBS) at â20 Â°C until immunohistochemistry was performed.All subsequent steps were performed at ambient temperature unless specified. Free-floating sections were rinsed in PBS overnight at 4 Â°C, then permeabilized for 30 min in PBS containing 0.5 % Triton X-100 (PBS-T) and rinsed three times for 8 min with PBS. Antigen retrieval was performed for 15 min in 0.1 M citrate buffer at pH 6.0 at 115 Â°C. Sections were subsequently rinsed three times for 8 min with PBS, then blocked for 1 h with 10 % normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS-T before incubation in primary antibodies diluted in 3 % serum in PBS-T overnight at 4 Â°C. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse biotin-anti-GFAP (1:1000; Millipore-Sigma #MAB3402B; RRID #AB_10917109), chicken anti-GFAP (1:500; Abcam #ab4674; RRID #AB_304558), rabbit anti-RFP (1:500; Abcam #ab34771; RRID #AB_777699), rabbit anti-dsRed and mCherry (1:500; Takara Bio #632496; RRID #AB_10013483) and goat anti-S100Î² (1:100; ThermoFisher #PA5â143122; RRID AB_2933761). Incubated sections were rinsed with PBS-T and were protected from light in all subsequent steps. Sections were incubated for 1 h with DAPI and fluorescent secondary antibodies (as listed in Immunocytochemistry) diluted in 3 % serum in PBS-T, rinsed with PBS-T, mounted on Superfrost glass slides (VWR #75799â266), and completely dried before sealing under #1.5 cover-glass (VWR #89239â734) using Prolong Diamond Antifade Mounting Media (ThermoFisher #P36970) or Vectashield antifade media (VWR #103881â218). Slides were allowed to set overnight before acquiring images.2.6.Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunocytochemistryA combined approach involving FISH and immunocytochemistry was used to label stress granules in astrocytes, based on a previously published protocol (Khalfallah et al., 2018). All steps were performed at ambient temperature unless otherwise specified. Briefly, astrocytes cultured on coverslips were fixed for 10 min on ice in 1 % PFA in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton X-100 in 2Ã saline sodium citrate (SSC) solution (20Ã SSC: 3 M sodium chloride and 0.3 M sodium citrate in water, pH 7) for 15 min. Cells were then washed with 1 M Tris (pH 8), blocked for 30 min with 0.0005 % BSA and 10 mg/ml yeast RNA (Sigma-Aldrich #R8759-100UN) in 2Ã SSC solution, and washed again with 1 M Tris solution. Cells were incubated for 1 h in a humidified chamber at 37 Â°C with hybridization buffer containing 2.6 ng/ml Cy3-labeled Oligo (dT) probe (GeneLink #26â4330-02), 0.005 % BSA, 1 mg/ml yeast RNA, 10 % dextran sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich #67578), and 25 % formamide (ThermoFisher #17899) in 2Ã SSC. Labeled cells were washed twice with 4Ã SSC and once with 2Ã SSC for 5 min, and then incubated for 1 h in primary antibodies: mouse anti-HuR (1:500; Invitrogen #MA1â167; RRID # AB_2533394) and rabbit anti-NUP-98 (1:100; Cell Signaling Technologies #2598S; RRID # AB_2267700). Cells were then washed twice with 4Ã SSC and once with 2Ã SSC for 5 min and incubated in fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000, ThermoFisher #A21202, #A31573; RRID # AB_141607, AB_2536183) and DAPI. Coverslips were washed twice with 4Ã SSC and once with 2Ã SSC for 5 min and mounted with Vectashield anti-fade media without DAPI.2.7.Western blottingCells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS before aspirating buffer and lysing directly with ice-cold 1Ã radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #89900) containing 1Ã Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (MilliporeSigma, #11836153001) and 1 % each of Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails 2 and 3 (MilliporeSigma, #P5726 and #P0044) for 5 min on ice. Cells were scraped, collected in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, sonicated on ice for 5 s at 10 % power with a probe sonifier (Branson), centrifuged at 10,000g for 5 min at 4 Â°C. Lysate was assayed for protein concentration using a detergent-compatible Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #23246).20â50 Î¼g of RIPA-soluble cell lysates were resolved on bis-tris SDSâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Mini Blot Module (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Membranes were blocked with 5 % BSA (VWR, #97062â904) in tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h before probing overnight at 4 Â°C with primary antibodies diluted in TBS containing 0.2 % Tween 20 (TBS-Tw). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-NUP98 (1:50; Cell Signaling Technologies #2598S; RRID #AB_2267700), rabbit anti-Lamin B1 (1:500; Abcam #ab16048; RRID #AB_443298), rabbit anti-dsRed and mCherry (1:500; Takara Bio #632496; RRID #AB_10013483), and mouse anti-Î³-Tubulin (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich #T5326; RRID #AB_532292).After overnight primary antibody incubation, blots were rinsed three times with TBS-Tw and probed for 1 h with IR Dye 680RD donkey anti-mouse (1:15,000; LI-COR, #926â68,072; RRID #AB_2814912) and IR Dye 800CW donkey anti-rabbit (1:15,000; LI-COR, #926â32,213; RRID #AB_621848) in TBS-Tw with 3 % BSA. Blots were rinsed twice with TBS-Tw and once with TBS and dried for at least 20 min before scanning on the Odyssey CLx imaging system (LI-COR). Expression levels were quantified using FIJI (v2.1.0/1.54 g).2.8.Microfluidic qPCRRNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit with on-column deoxyribonuclease treatment following manufacturer's instructions (QIAGEN, #74106 and #79256). Cultured iPSCs or iPSC-astrocytes on day 60 of differentiation were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS, scraped in extraction buffer, and frozen at â80 Â°C until extracted.Gene expression changes were determined by RT-qPCR using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A25741), according to manufacturer's instructions. RT-qPCR was performed in a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad).Microfluidic RT-qPCR was performed similarly to previously described protocols (Licht-Murava et al., 2023; Liddelow et al., 2017). cDNA was synthesized using the Protoscript First Strand Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, #E6300L) and preamplified for 14 cycles against a pool of primers using PreAmp Grandmaster mix (TATAA Biocenter, Sweden, #TA05) before exonuclease I treatment (New England Biolabs, #M0293L). Preamplified cDNA was diluted at least fivefold with nuclease-free water and mixed with SsoFast EvaGreen with Low ROX (Bio-Rad, #1725211) and chip-specific DNA Sample Reagents before loading into primed Flex Six Dynamic Array chips (Fluidigm, #100â6308, BMK-M-96.96). Individual primers were mixed with DNA assay reagent (Fluidigm) and loaded into chip inlets. Chips were primed and loaded using an IFC Controller HX (Fluidigm) before measuring and analyzing amplification and melting curves on a BioMark HD System (Fluidigm). Cycle of quantification (Cq) values were thresholded equally for all inlets across each chip run and normalized to the average of reference genes before determining ÎÎCq and fold change relative to experimental control groups.2.9.Cell culture transfectionsCell cultures were transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #L300008) according to manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA, P3000, and Lipo3000 reagents were diluted in OptiMEM media (Fisher Scientific, #31985070) and directly applied to cell cultures for 24 h before transfection media was aspirated and replaced with fresh culture media.2.10.AAV vector transductionTo assess astrocytic nucleocytoplasmic transport patterns in vivo, adult male and female Aldh1l1-Cre mice (9 months of age) were injected retro-orbitally with a PHP.eB AAV vector (Chan et al., 2017) encoding Cre-dependent tdT-NES-NLS under the astrocytic GfaABC1D promoter to enable astrocyte-specific targeting (Licht-Murava et al., 2023) (PHP.eB-GfaABC1D-DIO-tdT-NES-NLS) (1e12 Vg/mouse). Aldh1l1-Cre mice were chosen for the LPS-related experiments due to the well-established selectively of the Aldh1l1 promoter for astrocytes (Srinivasan et al., 2016; Endo et al., 2022). In separate experiments, male and female ÎNLS and control tetO and NTG littermate mice (8â10 months of age) received PHP.eB AAV vector encoding tdT-NES-NLS under the GfaABC1D promoter without the Cre-dependent DIO sequence. Mice were assessed three weeks after AAV delivery and tdT-NES-NLS expression was confirmed to localize predominantly to astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 3).2.11.Microscopy and image analysesTo measure mislocalization of NUP-98 in primary mouse and human iPSC-derived astrocytes, cells were immunolabeled with anti-GFAP and anti-NUP98 antibodies, imaged on a Zeiss LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40Ã objective (Nikon), and quantified using FIJI (v2.1.0/1.54 g). For each astrocyte, ROIs were manually drawn encompassing primary processes and cell soma with strong GFAP fluorescence and encompassing its DAPI-positive nucleus. Mean extranuclear signal intensity was quantified using a GFAP-thresholded mask after eliminating the nuclear area defined by the DAPI mask.To measure nuclear circularity of primary mouse and human iPSC-derived astrocytes, cells were immunolabeled with anti-GFAP and anti-lamin B1 antibodies, imaged on a Zeiss LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 25Ã objective (Nikon), and quantified using FIJI. For each image, a lamin B1-thresholded mask was created and quantified using the Analyze Particles function in FIJI, with the minimum sized set to 15 pixels to exclude non-specific antibody labeling. Circularity calculations were performed using an ImageJ plug-in, in which 1.0 represents a perfect circle and values below 1.0 represent less circular structures that are more similar to polygons.To measure cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS signal in primary mouse and human iPSC-derived astrocytes, cells were transfected with tdT-NES-NLS, immunolabeled with anti-GFAP and anti-dsRed antibodies, and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40Ã objective (Nikon) and quantified using FIJI. For each astrocyte, ROIs were drawn encompassing primary processes and cell soma with strong GFAP fluorescence and encompassing its DAPI-positive nucleus. Mean cytoplasmic signal intensity was quantified using a GFAP-thresholded mask after eliminating the nuclear area defined by the DAPI mask. Mean nuclear signal intensity was quantified using a DAPI-thresholded mask of the nucleus. Intensities were corrected for background fluorescence in each image by subtracting the mean intensity of five circular ROIs drawn in areas that did not have GFAP, NUP-98, or DAPI labeling above background levels. The cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio of tdT-NES-NLS signal was obtained by dividing the mean cytoplasmic tdT-NES-NLS signal by the mean nuclear tdT-NES-NLS signal.To measure cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS signal in mouse brain sections, slides were imaged on a BX-X710 microscope (Keyence) with a 40Ã objective (Nikon). Astrocytes were selected for analysis if expression of tdT-NLS-NES exceeded background signal. Nuclear ROIs were defined by drawing circular ROIs of radius 7 pixels centered on DAPI-positive nuclei, and cytoplasmic ROIs were defined by drawing concentric circular ROIs of radius 49 pixels atop the nuclear ROIs. Mean intensity was quantified using a tdT-NES-NLS-thresholded mask in the outer circular ROI and the inner circular ROI. The cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio of tdT-NES-NLS signal was obtained by dividing the mean cytoplasmic tdT-NES-NLS signal by the mean nuclear tdT-NES-NLS signal.Lipocalin-2 and NUP-98 immunoreactivity were measured in individual cells using ImageJ. Confocal images were background subtracted (50-pixel radius rolling ball) and cytoplasmic ROIs traced to include GFAP immunolabeling and exclude nuclear DAPI labeling. Lipocalin-2 and NUP-98 mean intensities were measured within each ROI and cells were binned according to NUP-98 levels (Low: <20, Med: 20â45, High: 46â75, Max: >75).Some images were captured on the DragonFly 200 spinning disk confocal microscope (Andor) with a 63Ã objective (Leica).2.12.Statistical analysesStatistical specifications are reported in the figures and corresponding figure legends. Statistical testing was performed using GraphPad Prism 10. All data are presented as mean Â± S.E.M or median and quartiles, as indicated in the legends. Two-sided Student's t-test was used to determine statistical significance between two groups. Differences among multiple groups were assessed by one-way or two-way ANOVA, followed by post-hoc tests, as specified in the legends. Null hypotheses were rejected at p < 0.05.

Materials and methods

2.1.AnimalsAll experiments using mice were conducted in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Weill Cornell Medicine guidelines. Mice were housed in groups of 2â5 mice per cage and were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Astrocyte-specific expression of mutant human TDP-43 was achieved using transgenic hGFAP-tTA mice with a tet-off tetracycline transactivator (tTA) element downstream of the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter (kindly provided by Dr. Lennart Mucke, Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA) (Orr et al., 2015).hGFAP-tTA mice (B6.Cg-Tg(GFAP-tTA)110Pop/J; Jackson Laboratory strain #005964) were crossed with tetO-hTDP43-ÎNLS mice (B6; C3-Tg(tetO-TARDBP*)4Vle/J; Jackson Laboratory strain #014650), which express a tet operator (tetO) sequence upstream of the human TARDBP gene with a mutated nuclear localization sequence (tetO-hTDP43-ÎNLS), leading to expression of human TDP-43 in the cytoplasm (Igaz et al., 2011). In doubly transgenic mice (referred to as ÎNLS mice), doxycycline (DOX) can bind to tTA to prevent tetO-mediated expression of hTDP43-ÎNLS. Breeding pairs and offspring until weaning age (P21) were provided with doxycycline-supplemented chow (200 mg/kg, VWR, 89067â462) to prevent expression of transgene during embryonic and postnatal development. Because the parent tetO-hTDP43-ÎNLS strain was on a B6/C3 hybrid background, we backcrossed this line onto the C57Bl/6 J background (Jackson Laboratory strain #000664) for over five generations.Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member L1 (Aldh1l1)-Cre transgenic mice (B6;FVB-Tg(Aldh1l1-cre)JD1884Htz/J) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (strain #023748) and backcrossed onto the C57Bl/6 J background. Aldh1l1-Cre mice express Cre recombinase downstream of the astrocytic Aldh1l1 promoter, allowing for astrocyte-specific expression of Cre-dependent constructs using transduction.

2.2.Primary astrocyte culturesAll cultured cells were maintained at 37 Â°C in a humidified 5 % CO2-containing atmosphere. Prior to culture, cell culture dishes were coated with poly-d-lysine (75â150 kDa, 0.01 % in water, filtered; Sigma #P6407 or MP Biomedical #0215017580) for at least 2 h, and coated culture dishes were washed twice with PBS and once with water before drying completely. Mouse primary cortical astrocytes were obtained by dissecting cortices from wild-type (WT) (C57BI/6 J, Jackson Laboratory strain #000664) or hemizygous doubly transgenic ÎNLS pups at postnatal day 1â5 in cold PBS. Meninges were removed and cells were dissociated manually by trituration with a P1000 pipette in 1 ml fresh culture media consisting of high-glucose DMEM (Corning), 20 % tetracycline-depleted and heat-inactivated FBS (VWR #97065â310), 1Ã GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher #35050061), and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Thermo Scientific). Cell suspensions were diluted with media and filtered through a 70 Î¼m cell strainer (VWR). The resulting suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 300g, and the cell pellet was resuspended with fresh culture media and plated into cell culture dishes. At DIV 4â5, the cells were washed to remove debris and fresh culture media was added.WT and ÎNLS astrocyte cultures contain 98.8 % Â± 0.4 % (SE) astrocytes and 1.2 % Â± 0.4 % (SE) microglia (Licht-Murava et al., 2023), based on immunolabeling for GFAP, Iba1, NeuN, and DAPI and imaging using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S microscope with a Nikon PlanFluor 10Ã objective and NIS-Elements BR v5.02.01 acquisition software. ÎNLS cultures were determined to express hTDP-43 in 47.8 Â± 4.7 % (SE) of astrocytes when cultured with primary astrocyte media supplemented with tetracycline-negative FBS, based on immunolabeling for hTDP-43 and GFAP (Licht-Murava et al., 2023).

2.3.Human iPSC maintenance and differentiationAll human iPSC cultures and differentiations were maintained at 37 Â°C in a humidified 5 % CO2 atmosphere. Isogenic control and TDP-43-Q331K heterozygous mutant lines were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (JAX #JIPSC1000, #JIPSC1066) and were maintained in Essential 8 media (ThermoFisher #A1517001) on cell culture dishes coated with vitronectin (5 Î¼g/ml in PBS, ThermoFisher #A31804). iPSCs were passaged using EDTA solution (0.5 mM in PBS, VWR #MT-46034CI). Y-27632 dihydrochloride (10 Î¼M, MedChemExpress #HY-10583) was added to media during passaging and thawing to prevent cell death. Cells were frozen in Stem-Cell Banker (AMSBIO #11890) using Mr. Frosty Freezing Containers (ThermoFisher #5100â0001) before long-term storage in liquid nitrogen.Human iPSCs were differentiated into mature cortical astrocytes as previously described (Tchieu et al., 2019). Specifically, iPSCs were dissociated with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies #AT104â500) into a single-cell suspension before plating at a density of 300,000 cells/cm2 in Essential 8 media (ThermoFisher # A1517001) supplemented with Y-27632 dihydochloride (MedChemExpress #HY-10583) onto Matrigel (VWR #BD354277) coated culture dishes.

On days 22â28 of differentiation, doxycycline (1 mg/ml, Millipore Sigma #D9891) was added to culture media every other day. On day 29, cells were passaged at a density of 75,000/cm2 onto poly-ornithine, laminin, and fibronectin-coated cell culture dishes in ScienCell Astrocyte Medium (ScienCell #1801).Cells were passaged as needed and maintained until day 34 of differentiation, when they were fed with DMEM/F-12 media (ThermoFisher) supplemented with 1Ã N2 supplement (ThermoFisher), sodium pyruvate (1 mM, Thermo Scientific), GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (5 Î¼g/ml, Millipore Sigma #A9165), and HB-EGF (10 ng/ml, R&D #259-HE).

2.10.AAV vector transductionTo assess astrocytic nucleocytoplasmic transport patterns in vivo, adult male and female Aldh1l1-Cre mice (9 months of age) were injected retro-orbitally with a PHP.eB AAV vector (Chan et al., 2017) encoding Cre-dependent tdT-NES-NLS under the astrocytic GfaABC1D promoter to enable astrocyte-specific targeting (Licht-Murava et al., 2023) (PHP.eB-GfaABC1D-DIO-tdT-NES-NLS) (1e12 Vg/mouse). Aldh1l1-Cre mice were chosen for the LPS-related experiments due to the well-established selectively of the Aldh1l1 promoter for astrocytes (Srinivasan et al., 2016; Endo et al., 2022). In separate experiments, male and female ÎNLS and control tetO and NTG littermate mice (8â10 months of age) received PHP.eB AAV vector encoding tdT-NES-NLS under the GfaABC1D promoter without the Cre-dependent DIO sequence. Mice were assessed three weeks after AAV delivery and tdT-NES-NLS expression was confirmed to localize predominantly to astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 3).

2.11.Microscopy and image analysesTo measure mislocalization of NUP-98 in primary mouse and human iPSC-derived astrocytes, cells were immunolabeled with anti-GFAP and anti-NUP98 antibodies, imaged on a Zeiss LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40Ã objective (Nikon), and quantified using FIJI (v2.1.0/1.54 g). For each astrocyte, ROIs were manually drawn encompassing primary processes and cell soma with strong GFAP fluorescence and encompassing its DAPI-positive nucleus. Mean extranuclear signal intensity was quantified using a GFAP-thresholded mask after eliminating the nuclear area defined by the DAPI mask.To measure nuclear circularity of primary mouse and human iPSC-derived astrocytes, cells were immunolabeled with anti-GFAP and anti-lamin B1 antibodies, imaged on a Zeiss LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 25Ã objective (Nikon), and quantified using FIJI. For each image, a lamin B1-thresholded mask was created and quantified using the Analyze Particles function in FIJI, with the minimum sized set to 15 pixels to exclude non-specific antibody labeling. Circularity calculations were performed using an ImageJ plug-in, in which 1.0 represents a perfect circle and values below 1.0 represent less circular structures that are more similar to polygons.To measure cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS signal in primary mouse and human iPSC-derived astrocytes, cells were transfected with tdT-NES-NLS, immunolabeled with anti-GFAP and anti-dsRed antibodies, and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40Ã objective (Nikon) and quantified using FIJI. For each astrocyte, ROIs were drawn encompassing primary processes and cell soma with strong GFAP fluorescence and encompassing its DAPI-positive nucleus. Mean cytoplasmic signal intensity was quantified using a GFAP-thresholded mask after eliminating the nuclear area defined by the DAPI mask. Mean nuclear signal intensity was quantified using a DAPI-thresholded mask of the nucleus. Intensities were corrected for background fluorescence in each image by subtracting the mean intensity of five circular ROIs drawn in areas that did not have GFAP, NUP-98, or DAPI labeling above background levels. The cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio of tdT-NES-NLS signal was obtained by dividing the mean cytoplasmic tdT-NES-NLS signal by the mean nuclear tdT-NES-NLS signal.To measure cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS signal in mouse brain sections, slides were imaged on a BX-X710 microscope (Keyence) with a 40Ã objective (Nikon). Astrocytes were selected for analysis if expression of tdT-NLS-NES exceeded background signal. Nuclear ROIs were defined by drawing circular ROIs of radius 7 pixels centered on DAPI-positive nuclei, and cytoplasmic ROIs were defined by drawing concentric circular ROIs of radius 49 pixels atop the nuclear ROIs. Mean intensity was quantified using a tdT-NES-NLS-thresholded mask in the outer circular ROI and the inner circular ROI. The cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio of tdT-NES-NLS signal was obtained by dividing the mean cytoplasmic tdT-NES-NLS signal by the mean nuclear tdT-NES-NLS signal.Lipocalin-2 and NUP-98 immunoreactivity were measured in individual cells using ImageJ. Confocal images were background subtracted (50-pixel radius rolling ball) and cytoplasmic ROIs traced to include GFAP immunolabeling and exclude nuclear DAPI labeling. Lipocalin-2 and NUP-98 mean intensities were measured within each ROI and cells were binned according to NUP-98 levels (Low: <20, Med: 20â45, High: 46â75, Max: >75).Some images were captured on the DragonFly 200 spinning disk confocal microscope (Andor) with a 63Ã objective (Leica).

To measure cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS signal in mouse brain sections, slides were imaged on a BX-X710 microscope (Keyence) with a 40Ã objective (Nikon). Astrocytes were selected for analysis if expression of tdT-NLS-NES exceeded background signal. Nuclear ROIs were defined by drawing circular ROIs of radius 7 pixels centered on DAPI-positive nuclei, and cytoplasmic ROIs were defined by drawing concentric circular ROIs of radius 49 pixels atop the nuclear ROIs. Mean intensity was quantified using a tdT-NES-NLS-thresholded mask in the outer circular ROI and the inner circular ROI. The cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio of tdT-NES-NLS signal was obtained by dividing the mean cytoplasmic tdT-NES-NLS signal by the mean nuclear tdT-NES-NLS signal.

Lipocalin-2 and NUP-98 immunoreactivity were measured in individual cells using ImageJ. Confocal images were background subtracted (50-pixel radius rolling ball) and cytoplasmic ROIs traced to include GFAP immunolabeling and exclude nuclear DAPI labeling. Lipocalin-2 and NUP-98 mean intensities were measured within each ROI and cells were binned according to NUP-98 levels (Low: <20, Med: 20â45, High: 46â75, Max: >75).

Some images were captured on the DragonFly 200 spinning disk confocal microscope (Andor) with a 63Ã objective (Leica).

3.Results3.1.TDP-43 dysregulation causes nucleocytoplasmic changes in astrocytesWe first investigated the effects of TDP-43 dysregulation on astrocyte nucleocytoplasmic changes by assessing the localization of nucleoporin-98 (NUP-98), which can mislocalize to the cytoplasmic compartment of neurons with TDP-43 pathology (Chou et al., 2018) but these effects have not been explored in glial cells. To test whether NUP-98 localization is affected, we examined primary astrocytes derived from double transgenic mice expressing astrocyte-targeted human TDP-43 with a mutated nuclear localization sequence (ÎNLS) (Igaz et al., 2011; Licht-Murava et al., 2023). As we characterized previously (Licht-Murava et al., 2023), ÎNLS astrocytes have increased cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43, which was absent in WT astrocytes (Fig. 1A). NUP-98 was detected throughout the nucleoplasm in WT astrocytes, consistent with studies in other cell types showing that NUP-98 associates with the nuclear membrane as well as intranuclear elements (Griffis et al., 2003; Capitanio et al., 2018). Importantly, ÎNLS astrocytes had increased extranuclear levels of NUP-98 as compared to WT controls (Fig. 1A and B), but no detectable changes in total NUP-98 protein levels (Supplementary Figs. S1A and S1B), suggesting that TDP-43 dysregulation causes mislocalization of NUP-98 and may alter the properties of astrocytic nuclear membranes.Nuclear envelope morphology is an indicator of cell health and important for homeostatic functions, including regulation of nuclear pore permeability and distribution (FiÅ¡erovÃ¡ et al., 2019), cytoskeleton interactions (Gerace and Huber, 2012; Aureille et al., 2019), chromatin organization (Shevelyov, 2023), and transcription (Kind and van Steensel, 2010). Altered nuclear morphology has been reported in neurons with proteinopathy (Chou et al., 2018; Frost et al., 2016) and is associated with senescence in astrocytes (Matias et al., 2022). To assess the effects of TDP-43 pathology on astrocytic nuclear morphology, we immunolabeled WT and ÎNLS astrocytes with an antibody targeting the nuclear marker lamin B and quantified nuclear circularity within individual astrocytes. Although typically enriched at the nuclear membrane, lamin B can also exhibit a diffuse intranuclear pattern depending on cell type and other factors (Matias et al., 2022; Shimi et al., 2011). We found that ÎNLS astrocytes had decreased nuclear circularity and increased aberrations in nuclear morphology, such as invaginations (Fig. 1C and D), without changes in the total levels of lamin B (Supplementary Figs. S1A and S1B), suggesting that astrocytic TDP-43 accumulation affects nuclear envelope architecture in addition to altering NUP-98 localization.Next, we examined the impact of TDP-43 accumulation on nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, as defects in nucleocytoplasmic protein flux and nuclear protein import can occur in neurons with TDP-43 pathology (Chou et al., 2018; Khalil et al., 2022). Astrocytes were transfected with a construct encoding CMV promoter-regulated tdTomato-NES-NLS (tdT-NES-NLS), a fluorescent protein containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES) that together allow bidirectional transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm and enables assessment of nucleocytoplasmic flux (Zhang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2015). We quantified cytoplasmic and intranuclear levels of tdT-NES-NLS within individual astrocytes and compared cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios across genotypes. These analyses revealed that ÎNLS astrocytes had increased cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS as compared to WT astrocytes (Fig. 1E and F), suggesting that nucleocytoplasmic transport dynamics were biased against nuclear protein import. Of note, total transduced levels of tdT-NES-NLS protein were lower in ÎNLS astrocytes as compared to WT controls (Supplementary Figs. S1C and S1D), possibly due to TDP-43 pathology partly interfering with transfection or transgene expression in ÎNLS astrocytes, suggesting that the observed increases in cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS were unlikely to be due to overall increases in tdT-NES-NLS expression.Human astrocytes differ from mouse astrocytes in certain features and functions (Oberheim et al., 2009; Li et al., 2021). To determine if TDP-43 pathology-linked nucleocytoplasmic changes in mouse astrocytes are conserved in human astrocytes and are associated with disease-related mutations in TDP-43, we next evaluated nucleocytoplasmic changes in differentiated, mature cortical astrocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Fig. 1G) (Tchieu et al., 2019). In particular, we compared astrocytes heterozygous for the ALS/FTD-associated Q331K mutation in the gene encoding TDP-43 to isogenic TDP-43-WT astrocytes as controls. The Q331K mutation reduces solubility and increases aggregation of TDP-43 (Johnson et al., 2009; Lim et al., 2016), promotes cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates in mouse cortical and spinal cord motor neurons (Mitchell et al., 2015), and causes disruptions in TDP-43 function that are linked to neuronal death (Arnold et al., 2013). Notably, Q331K mutation also induces nucleocytoplasmic disruptions in neurons (Chou et al., 2018). However, its effects on human astrocytes have not been investigated.We confirmed that isogenic controls and Q331K iPSC-astrocytes robustly expressed the astrocyte marker GFAP by day 60 of differentiation (Fig. 1H and I). iPSC-astrocytes were also immunopositive for the astrocyte marker SOX9, whereas the neuronal marker NeuN and the microglial marker Iba1 were not detectable (Supplementary Fig. S1E). Additionally, iPSC-astrocytes expressed astrocyte markers EGFR, SLC1A2, SLC1A3, FABP7, FAM107A, S100B, NFIA, and AQP4, as detected by RT-qPCR (Supplementary Fig. S1F). Immunolabeling for NUP-98 revealed that Q331K iPSC-astrocytes had increased extranuclear levels of NUP-98 as compared to isogenic control astrocytes, in which NUP-98 was localized primarily in the nucleus (Fig. 1J). In addition, Q331K iPSC-astrocytes had irregular nuclear envelope morphology and decreased nuclear circularity as compared to isogenic controls (Fig. 1K). Transfection with tdT-NES-NLS revealed increases in the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS levels in Q331K iPSC-astrocytes (Fig. 1L). Therefore, alterations in NUP-98 localization, nuclear envelope morphology, and nucleocytoplasmic protein transport were also detected in human astrocytes carrying a disease-associated mutation in TDP-43, independently of gene overexpression, providing further evidence that TDP-43 pathology causes nucleocytoplasmic disruptions in astrocytes.3.2.Astrocyte nucleocytoplasmic disruptions are mediated by IL-1 receptors and NF-ÎºBAlthough the exact molecular mechanisms by which TDP-43 causes nucleocytoplasmic changes are not clear, TDP-43 pathology is increasingly linked to neuroimmune pathways, including activation of NF-ÎºB and alterations in interferon-linked factors and immune response genes (Licht-Murava et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). Notably, antiviral immune mechanisms might affect nucleocytoplasmic transport (Shen et al., 2021). Astrocytes are intimately involved in neuroimmune responses (Patani et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023) and can produce and respond to immune factors associated with inflammation, such as interleukin-1Î± (IL-1Î±), which activates NF-ÎºB (Dunn et al., 2002), induces astrocytic functional changes (Liddelow et al., 2017; Bretheau et al., 2022), and contributes to neurodegenerative conditions (Griffin and Mrak, 2002; Stojakovic et al., 2017). Recent findings also suggest that ÎNLS astrocytes have cell-autonomous increases in NF-ÎºB and STAT3 phosphorylation (Licht-Murava et al., 2023). Additionally, our analyses show that ÎNLS astrocytes and Q331K iPSC-astrocytes have increased levels of IL-1Î± protein (Supplementary Figs. S2A and S2B), further implicating neuroimmune mechanisms in TDP-43 pathology. However, it is not known if cytokines and related immune signaling pathways can induce nucleocytoplasmic changes and mediate the effects of TDP-43 dysregulation.To test whether TDP-43-related nucleocytoplasmic changes involve IL-1 receptor activity and/or NF-ÎºB signaling, we treated ÎNLS astrocytes with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1ra (1 Î¼g/ml) (Putnam et al., 2019), NF-ÎºB pathway inhibitor (NFÎºB-i) TPCA-1 (500 nM) (Robb et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2021), or vehicle control for 24 h. Compared to vehicle-treated astrocytes, ÎNLS astrocytes treated with IL-1ra or NFÎºB-i had reduced extranuclear NUP-98 levels (Fig. 2A and B) and improved nuclear circularity (Fig. 2C and D). IL-1ra and NFÎºB-i also prevented changes in protein trafficking as reflected by normalized cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS in ÎNLS astrocytes (Fig. 2E and F). Additionally, expression of a constitutively active form of IÎºB kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates and inactivates the inhibitory factor IÎºBÎ± and thus promotes NF-ÎºB activity, was sufficient to cause NUP-98 mislocalization in WT primary astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. S2C). To determine if STAT3, which has key roles in astrocytic responses to brain injury and disease (Ben Haim et al., 2015; Reichenbach et al., 2019), also promotes TDP-43-related changes, we treated ÎNLS astrocytes with the STAT3 inhibitor Stattic, but observed no effects on NUP-98 mislocalization (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Thus, astrocytic IL-1R/NF-ÎºB but not STAT3 signaling is required for TDP-43-related nucleocytoplasmic changes.We next assessed whether stimulation of astrocytic IL-1 receptors, which activate NF-ÎºB (Qian et al., 2001), is sufficient to induce nucleocytoplasmic disruptions. Indeed, WT primary mouse astrocytes treated with IL-1Î± (3 ng/ml) for 24 h had increased extranuclear levels of NUP-98 as compared to vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 3A and B). IL-1Î± also induced aberrant nuclear morphology (Fig. 3C and D) and increased cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio of tdT-NES-NLS as compared to controls (Fig. 3E and F). Total protein levels of NUP-98, lamin B, and tdT-NES-NLS were unchanged (Supplementary Figs. S2E-S2H). Similar to the effects of IL-1Î± in mouse astrocytes, IL-1Î±-treated human iPSC-derived astrocytes also had increased extranuclear levels of NUP-98 (Fig. 3G). In addition, IL-1Î±-treated human astrocytes had aberrant nuclear envelope morphology, decreased nuclear circularity (Fig. 3H), and altered levels of cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS as compared to vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 3I and J). Together, these data indicate that IL-1Î± stimulation is sufficient to induce astrocytic nucleocytoplasmic alterations in mouse and human cells, with changes closely mirroring the effects of TDP-43 dysregulation. We postulate that other neuroimmune stimuli that activate or suppress astrocytic NF-ÎºB signaling may also influence nucleocytoplasmic dynamics as well as modulate the effects of TDP-43 pathology.3.3.TDP-43 pathology and neuroinflammation induce astrocyte nucleocytoplasmic protein transport alterations in vivoWe next examined whether changes in nucleocytoplasmic function occur in vivo using a mouse model with astrocyte-targeted TDP-43 pathology. To induce TDP-43 pathology in adulthood, we used double transgenic tet-off ÎNLS mice (Igaz et al., 2011) with astrocytic expression of mutant TDP-43 in astrocytes (Licht-Murava et al., 2023), as well as single transgenic and non-transgenic control littermates. All mice received doxycycline until weaning age to prevent transgene effects on early development.In brain tissue, astrocytic NUP-98 and lamin B-positive nuclei could not be clearly visualized in astrocytes for reliable quantification. For assessing astrocytic nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, mice were injected retro-orbitally at 8â10 months of age with a PHP.eB adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector (Chan et al., 2017) (1e12 Vg/mouse) encoding tdT-NES-NLS under the control of GfaABC1D promoter to enable astrocyte-specific targeting (Licht-Murava et al., 2023). After three weeks, expression of tdT-NES-NLS protein was detected in S100Î²-positive astrocytes throughout the neocortex of injected mice (Fig. 4A and B). Transgene expression was confirmed to primarily target astrocytes (Supplementary Figs. S3A and S3B), which showed their characteristic tiling across cortical areas and bushy morphology (Fig. 4B). Immunolabeling was used to quantify the levels of tdT-NES-NLS in the nucleus and extranuclear compartment of individual astrocytes, as defined by DAPI and GFAP immunolabeling, respectively.Consistent with the results in cultured cells, astrocytes in ÎNLS mice but not single transgenic controls had increased cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS as compared to nontransgenic (NTG) mice (Fig. 4B and C). Although total cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of tdT-NES-NLS were both increased in ÎNLS and single transgenic controls (Supplementary Figs. S3C and S3D), only ÎNLS mice had altered cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios (Fig. 4C), suggesting that increases in total protein were not sufficient to cause nucleocytoplasmic alterations. Together with the results in mouse and human cell cultures, these findings suggest that astrocytic TDP-43 pathology is associated with nucleocytoplasmic alterations and that these effects are detectable across species and different model systems and types of TDP-43 perturbations.Based on our findings that cytokine exposure can induce nucleocytoplasmic changes in isolated astrocytes (Figs. 2 and 3), we next asked whether neuroinflammation is sufficient to promote nucleocytoplasmic changes in astrocytes in vivo in the absence of TDP-43 pathology. To address this question, we used systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in adult WT mice to model acute neuroinflammation, which involves increased IL-1 expression and NF-ÎºB activation in the brain (Lieberman et al., 1989; Baldwin Jr., 1996; Hasel et al., 2021; Diaz-Castro et al., 2021), along with various other immune responses. Unlike the culture models, systemic LPS exposure induces complex physiological immune cascades in the brain and periphery and enables testing of how neuroinflammation affects astrocytes in vivo (Hasel et al., 2021; Diaz-Castro et al., 2021).To assess changes in nucleocytoplasmic transport in astrocytes, we injected 9-month-old Aldh1l1-Cre mice (Tien et al., 2012) retro-orbitally with a Cre-dependent AAV vector PHP.eB-GfaABC1D-DIO-tdT-NES-NLS (1e12 Vg/mouse). After three weeks, expression of tdT-NES-NLS was astrocyte-specific and pronounced in the neocortex (Fig. 4D and E, and Supplementary Fig. S3E). Mice were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of LPS (5 mg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) before analyses of astrocytic tdT-NES-NLS localization at 6 or 24 h post-injection. GFAP and DAPI labeling within individual neocortical astrocytes were used to define the localization of tdT-NES-NLS in extranuclear and nuclear regions, respectively. Consistent with the results in cultured cells and ÎNLS mice, astrocytes in LPS-injected mice had increased cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS as compared to vehicle controls at 6 and 24 h (Fig. 4E and F, and Supplementary Figs. S3G and S3H). Thus, neuroinflammation is sufficient to alter nucleocytoplasmic protein distribution in astrocytes in vivo, similar to the effects of TDP-43 dysregulation, further linking neuroimmune pathways to nucleocytoplasmic alterations.3.4.Astrocyte nucleocytoplasmic changes are induced rapidly but resolve slowlyTo further characterize the cytokine-induced effects and temporal dynamics of nucleocytoplasmic changes, we treated WT primary mouse astrocytes with IL-1Î± or vehicle for different durations prior to analysis of NUP-98 localization, nuclear envelope morphological changes, and nucleocytoplasmic protein trafficking. We found that extranuclear NUP-98 mislocalization was detectable as early as 15 min following IL-1Î± treatment, increased further within 1 h, and then remained stable for at least 6 h (Figs. 5A-5C). The rapid onset suggests that extranuclear NUP-98 accumulation is an early feature of astrocytic responses to IL-1 receptor activation and that existing, rather than newly synthesized, NUP-98 becomes mislocalized. Additionally, prominent changes in nuclear envelope circularity occurred as soon as 2 h after receptor stimulation (Figs. 5D-5F). To assess the timing of nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, astrocytes were transfected with tdT-NES-NLS and then treated with IL-1Î± for different durations. Cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS were increased by 2 h after treatment and remained elevated for at least 6 h (Fig. 5G and H). Together, these analyses suggest that changes in NUP-98 localization occur within minutes of stimulation and precede changes in nuclear envelope morphology and nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, which occur in parallel within hours of stimulation.We next asked whether these rapid changes were reversible or remained stable following stimulation. After 24 h of IL-1Î± treatment, WT astrocytes were washed and maintained in IL-1Î±-free media for varying timepoints prior to analyses. We found that changes in NUP-98 localization persisted for at least 24 h post-washout, but these effects were reversible, as NUP-98 returned to a predominantly nuclear localization after 72 h of washout (Fig. 5I and J). Therefore, NUP-98 remains mislocalized beyond the initial response period but resolves within days. Similarly, abnormal nuclear circularity persisted 24 h after stimulation but was resolved by 72 h of washout (Fig. 5K and L). Cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS also returned to baseline by 72 h post-washout but not earlier (Fig. 5M and N), further revealing that IL-1 induces rapid and prolonged changes in nucleocytoplasmic dynamics that likely affect astrocytic homeostasis and might influence disease responses.We next examined the spatiotemporal relationship between IL-1Î±-induced extranuclear NUP-98 accumulation and increases in lipocalin-2, an astrocytic factor linked to reactivity states and disease pathogenesis. Of note, astrocytic lipocalin-2 is known to be increased in neuroinflammation and may promote neural impairments and cognitive decline in brain injury and disease (Kim et al., 2024). We found that lipocalin-2 protein levels were rapidly increased in WT mouse astrocytes within 6 h of IL-1Î± treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4A). However, at this timepoint, there were no detectable differences in lipocalin-2 induction among individual astrocytes with varying levels of extranuclear NUP-98 accumulation (Supplementary Fig. S4B), suggesting that nucleocytoplasmic alterations are occurring in concert with astrocytic reactivity mechanisms and might modulate certain types of astrocytic responses and signaling pathways in disease.3.5.Nucleocytoplasmic changes in astrocytes are associated with stress granules and mediated by integrated stress response pathwaysThe molecular mechanisms promoting nucleocytoplasmic changes downstream of IL-1 receptors are not known. Notably, stress granule formation is a rapidly induced response to cellular stress (Youn et al., 2019) and can influence nucleocytoplasmic processes by sequestering nucleoporins and nuclear transport factors (Zhang et al., 2018). Formation and misprocessing of persistent stress granules occur in neurons in diverse neurodegenerative contexts (Wolozin and Ivanov, 2019). Although typically linked to disease pathogenesis, stress granules also have beneficial effects and can promote cell recovery from stress (Paget et al., 2023; Bussi et al., 2023). However, stress granules have not been extensively studied in glial cells, and it is not known if cytokines or immune-related signaling pathways can induce stress granules in astrocytes and possibly promote nucleocytoplasmic alterations. Thus, we investigated whether IL-1Î± can induce astrocytic stress granule formation and whether stress-related pathways contribute to nucleocytoplasmic changes.Primary astrocytes were treated with either sodium arsenite (SA), a known inducer of stress granules (Zhang et al., 2018), IL-1Î±, or vehicle for 30 min, and then monitored for stress granule formation. Stress granules were visualized by labeling for cytoplasmic mRNAs with oligo (dT) fluorescent probes, along with co-labeling for human antigen R (HuR), which is encoded by ELAV-like 1 (Elavl1) gene and known as an RNA-binding protein that localizes to stress granules. This dual-marker approach ensures reliable, high-confidence detection of stress granules, as reported previously in various cell types (Aulas et al., 2015) and confirmed in astrocytes treated with SA (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Importantly, IL-1Î± treatment induced a robust increase in the number (Fig. 6A and B) and size (Supplementary Fig. S4D) of oligo(dT) and HuR double-positive stress granules in astrocytes, and the stress granules were immunopositive for NUP-98 (Fig. 6A). These results suggest that IL-1 stimulation is sufficient to induce astrocytic stress granule formation and promote extranuclear sequestration of NUP-98.Stress granule formation is regulated in part by integrated stress responses (ISR), which lead to upregulation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (Sidrauski et al., 2015; Anand and Walter, 2020; Zyryanova et al., 2021). Indeed, treatment of control iPSC-astrocytes with IL-1Î± caused marked increases in ATF4 RNA levels at acute timepoints, providing further support that IL-1Î± rapidly induces ISR (Supplementary Fig. S4E). The ISR inhibitor ISRIB prevents stress granule formation by binding to eIF2Î² (Anand and Walter, 2020; Zyryanova et al., 2021). We found that astrocytes pre-treated with ISRIB (2 Î¼M) prior to stimulation with IL-1Î± had fewer (Fig. 6A and B) and smaller (Supplementary Fig. S4D) stress granules. Moreover, ISRIB treatment fully prevented IL-1Î±-induced extranuclear NUP-98 accumulation (Fig. 6A and C), suggesting that cytokine stimulation promotes stress granule formation and changes in nucleoporin localization through ISR pathways. We also assessed whether ISR activation is required for IL-1Î±-induced changes in nuclear morphology and nucleocytoplasmic protein transport. ISRIB treatment prevented IL-1Î±-induced changes in astrocytic nuclear circularity (Fig. 6D and E) and cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS (Fig. 6F and G), suggesting that ISR mediates astrocytic stress granule accumulation and nucleocytoplasmic alterations in response to cytokine stimulation. Notably, stress granules induced by IL-1Î± treatment returned to baseline levels by 24 h of washout and continued to be minimal at 72 h after washout (Supplementary Fig. 4F), consistent with the observed reversibility and recovery of nucleocytoplasmic alterations and suggesting that stress granules can resolve at a faster rate than the nucleocytoplasmic changes.Given that TDP-43 pathology is linked to aberrant stress granule formation in multiple cell types (Ratti et al., 2020), including astrocytes (Khalfallah et al., 2018), we next hypothesized that TDP-43 pathology-related nucleocytoplasmic changes are also mediated by ISR pathways. Consistent with this notion, ÎNLS astrocytes had more cytoplasmic stress granules at baseline (Fig. 6H and I), which were also larger than the sparse stress granules detected in WT astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. S4G), and these stress granules were immunopositive for NUP-98 (Fig. 6H). Treatment of ÎNLS astrocytes with ISRIB was effective in suppressing stress granules (Fig. 6H and I), reducing stress granule size (Supplementary Fig. S4G), and reducing extranuclear NUP-98 levels (Fig. 6H and J). Moreover, ÎNLS astrocytes treated with ISRIB had nuclei that appeared more circular as compared to vehicle-treated ÎNLS astrocytes, and nuclear circularity was similar to WT controls (Fig. 6K and L). ÎNLS astrocytes treated with ISRIB also had cytoplasmic-to-nuclear tdT-NES-NLS ratios comparable to WT controls (Fig. 6M and N), linking astrocytic ISR pathways to changes in nucleocytoplasmic protein transport. Moreover, inhibition of NF-ÎºB reduced stress granules in ÎNLS astrocytes (Fig. 6O), further linking this signaling pathway to intrinsic stress responses in TDP-43 pathology.Together, our findings reveal that dementia-related TDP-43 dysregulation induces astrocytic stress granule formation and nucleocytoplasmic changes through neuroimmune signaling and activation of ISR pathways. These results establish that astrocytic responses to proteinopathy and neuroinflammatory stimuli converge onto stress-related pathways that broadly modulate nucleocytoplasmic processes.

3.1.TDP-43 dysregulation causes nucleocytoplasmic changes in astrocytesWe first investigated the effects of TDP-43 dysregulation on astrocyte nucleocytoplasmic changes by assessing the localization of nucleoporin-98 (NUP-98), which can mislocalize to the cytoplasmic compartment of neurons with TDP-43 pathology (Chou et al., 2018) but these effects have not been explored in glial cells. To test whether NUP-98 localization is affected, we examined primary astrocytes derived from double transgenic mice expressing astrocyte-targeted human TDP-43 with a mutated nuclear localization sequence (ÎNLS) (Igaz et al., 2011; Licht-Murava et al., 2023). As we characterized previously (Licht-Murava et al., 2023), ÎNLS astrocytes have increased cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43, which was absent in WT astrocytes (Fig. 1A). NUP-98 was detected throughout the nucleoplasm in WT astrocytes, consistent with studies in other cell types showing that NUP-98 associates with the nuclear membrane as well as intranuclear elements (Griffis et al., 2003; Capitanio et al., 2018). Importantly, ÎNLS astrocytes had increased extranuclear levels of NUP-98 as compared to WT controls (Fig. 1A and B), but no detectable changes in total NUP-98 protein levels (Supplementary Figs. S1A and S1B), suggesting that TDP-43 dysregulation causes mislocalization of NUP-98 and may alter the properties of astrocytic nuclear membranes.Nuclear envelope morphology is an indicator of cell health and important for homeostatic functions, including regulation of nuclear pore permeability and distribution (FiÅ¡erovÃ¡ et al., 2019), cytoskeleton interactions (Gerace and Huber, 2012; Aureille et al., 2019), chromatin organization (Shevelyov, 2023), and transcription (Kind and van Steensel, 2010). Altered nuclear morphology has been reported in neurons with proteinopathy (Chou et al., 2018; Frost et al., 2016) and is associated with senescence in astrocytes (Matias et al., 2022). To assess the effects of TDP-43 pathology on astrocytic nuclear morphology, we immunolabeled WT and ÎNLS astrocytes with an antibody targeting the nuclear marker lamin B and quantified nuclear circularity within individual astrocytes. Although typically enriched at the nuclear membrane, lamin B can also exhibit a diffuse intranuclear pattern depending on cell type and other factors (Matias et al., 2022; Shimi et al., 2011). We found that ÎNLS astrocytes had decreased nuclear circularity and increased aberrations in nuclear morphology, such as invaginations (Fig. 1C and D), without changes in the total levels of lamin B (Supplementary Figs. S1A and S1B), suggesting that astrocytic TDP-43 accumulation affects nuclear envelope architecture in addition to altering NUP-98 localization.Next, we examined the impact of TDP-43 accumulation on nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, as defects in nucleocytoplasmic protein flux and nuclear protein import can occur in neurons with TDP-43 pathology (Chou et al., 2018; Khalil et al., 2022). Astrocytes were transfected with a construct encoding CMV promoter-regulated tdTomato-NES-NLS (tdT-NES-NLS), a fluorescent protein containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES) that together allow bidirectional transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm and enables assessment of nucleocytoplasmic flux (Zhang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2015). We quantified cytoplasmic and intranuclear levels of tdT-NES-NLS within individual astrocytes and compared cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios across genotypes. These analyses revealed that ÎNLS astrocytes had increased cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS as compared to WT astrocytes (Fig. 1E and F), suggesting that nucleocytoplasmic transport dynamics were biased against nuclear protein import. Of note, total transduced levels of tdT-NES-NLS protein were lower in ÎNLS astrocytes as compared to WT controls (Supplementary Figs. S1C and S1D), possibly due to TDP-43 pathology partly interfering with transfection or transgene expression in ÎNLS astrocytes, suggesting that the observed increases in cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS were unlikely to be due to overall increases in tdT-NES-NLS expression.Human astrocytes differ from mouse astrocytes in certain features and functions (Oberheim et al., 2009; Li et al., 2021). To determine if TDP-43 pathology-linked nucleocytoplasmic changes in mouse astrocytes are conserved in human astrocytes and are associated with disease-related mutations in TDP-43, we next evaluated nucleocytoplasmic changes in differentiated, mature cortical astrocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Fig. 1G) (Tchieu et al., 2019). In particular, we compared astrocytes heterozygous for the ALS/FTD-associated Q331K mutation in the gene encoding TDP-43 to isogenic TDP-43-WT astrocytes as controls. The Q331K mutation reduces solubility and increases aggregation of TDP-43 (Johnson et al., 2009; Lim et al., 2016), promotes cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates in mouse cortical and spinal cord motor neurons (Mitchell et al., 2015), and causes disruptions in TDP-43 function that are linked to neuronal death (Arnold et al., 2013). Notably, Q331K mutation also induces nucleocytoplasmic disruptions in neurons (Chou et al., 2018). However, its effects on human astrocytes have not been investigated.We confirmed that isogenic controls and Q331K iPSC-astrocytes robustly expressed the astrocyte marker GFAP by day 60 of differentiation (Fig. 1H and I). iPSC-astrocytes were also immunopositive for the astrocyte marker SOX9, whereas the neuronal marker NeuN and the microglial marker Iba1 were not detectable (Supplementary Fig. S1E). Additionally, iPSC-astrocytes expressed astrocyte markers EGFR, SLC1A2, SLC1A3, FABP7, FAM107A, S100B, NFIA, and AQP4, as detected by RT-qPCR (Supplementary Fig. S1F). Immunolabeling for NUP-98 revealed that Q331K iPSC-astrocytes had increased extranuclear levels of NUP-98 as compared to isogenic control astrocytes, in which NUP-98 was localized primarily in the nucleus (Fig. 1J). In addition, Q331K iPSC-astrocytes had irregular nuclear envelope morphology and decreased nuclear circularity as compared to isogenic controls (Fig. 1K). Transfection with tdT-NES-NLS revealed increases in the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS levels in Q331K iPSC-astrocytes (Fig. 1L). Therefore, alterations in NUP-98 localization, nuclear envelope morphology, and nucleocytoplasmic protein transport were also detected in human astrocytes carrying a disease-associated mutation in TDP-43, independently of gene overexpression, providing further evidence that TDP-43 pathology causes nucleocytoplasmic disruptions in astrocytes.

TDP-43 dysregulation causes nucleocytoplasmic changes in astrocytes

We first investigated the effects of TDP-43 dysregulation on astrocyte nucleocytoplasmic changes by assessing the localization of nucleoporin-98 (NUP-98), which can mislocalize to the cytoplasmic compartment of neurons with TDP-43 pathology (Chou et al., 2018) but these effects have not been explored in glial cells. To test whether NUP-98 localization is affected, we examined primary astrocytes derived from double transgenic mice expressing astrocyte-targeted human TDP-43 with a mutated nuclear localization sequence (ÎNLS) (Igaz et al., 2011; Licht-Murava et al., 2023). As we characterized previously (Licht-Murava et al., 2023), ÎNLS astrocytes have increased cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43, which was absent in WT astrocytes (Fig. 1A). NUP-98 was detected throughout the nucleoplasm in WT astrocytes, consistent with studies in other cell types showing that NUP-98 associates with the nuclear membrane as well as intranuclear elements (Griffis et al., 2003; Capitanio et al., 2018). Importantly, ÎNLS astrocytes had increased extranuclear levels of NUP-98 as compared to WT controls (Fig. 1A and B), but no detectable changes in total NUP-98 protein levels (Supplementary Figs. S1A and S1B), suggesting that TDP-43 dysregulation causes mislocalization of NUP-98 and may alter the properties of astrocytic nuclear membranes.

Nuclear envelope morphology is an indicator of cell health and important for homeostatic functions, including regulation of nuclear pore permeability and distribution (FiÅ¡erovÃ¡ et al., 2019), cytoskeleton interactions (Gerace and Huber, 2012; Aureille et al., 2019), chromatin organization (Shevelyov, 2023), and transcription (Kind and van Steensel, 2010). Altered nuclear morphology has been reported in neurons with proteinopathy (Chou et al., 2018; Frost et al., 2016) and is associated with senescence in astrocytes (Matias et al., 2022). To assess the effects of TDP-43 pathology on astrocytic nuclear morphology, we immunolabeled WT and ÎNLS astrocytes with an antibody targeting the nuclear marker lamin B and quantified nuclear circularity within individual astrocytes. Although typically enriched at the nuclear membrane, lamin B can also exhibit a diffuse intranuclear pattern depending on cell type and other factors (Matias et al., 2022; Shimi et al., 2011). We found that ÎNLS astrocytes had decreased nuclear circularity and increased aberrations in nuclear morphology, such as invaginations (Fig. 1C and D), without changes in the total levels of lamin B (Supplementary Figs. S1A and S1B), suggesting that astrocytic TDP-43 accumulation affects nuclear envelope architecture in addition to altering NUP-98 localization.

Next, we examined the impact of TDP-43 accumulation on nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, as defects in nucleocytoplasmic protein flux and nuclear protein import can occur in neurons with TDP-43 pathology (Chou et al., 2018; Khalil et al., 2022). Astrocytes were transfected with a construct encoding CMV promoter-regulated tdTomato-NES-NLS (tdT-NES-NLS), a fluorescent protein containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES) that together allow bidirectional transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm and enables assessment of nucleocytoplasmic flux (Zhang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2015). We quantified cytoplasmic and intranuclear levels of tdT-NES-NLS within individual astrocytes and compared cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios across genotypes. These analyses revealed that ÎNLS astrocytes had increased cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS as compared to WT astrocytes (Fig. 1E and F), suggesting that nucleocytoplasmic transport dynamics were biased against nuclear protein import. Of note, total transduced levels of tdT-NES-NLS protein were lower in ÎNLS astrocytes as compared to WT controls (Supplementary Figs. S1C and S1D), possibly due to TDP-43 pathology partly interfering with transfection or transgene expression in ÎNLS astrocytes, suggesting that the observed increases in cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS were unlikely to be due to overall increases in tdT-NES-NLS expression.

Human astrocytes differ from mouse astrocytes in certain features and functions (Oberheim et al., 2009; Li et al., 2021). To determine if TDP-43 pathology-linked nucleocytoplasmic changes in mouse astrocytes are conserved in human astrocytes and are associated with disease-related mutations in TDP-43, we next evaluated nucleocytoplasmic changes in differentiated, mature cortical astrocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Fig. 1G) (Tchieu et al., 2019). In particular, we compared astrocytes heterozygous for the ALS/FTD-associated Q331K mutation in the gene encoding TDP-43 to isogenic TDP-43-WT astrocytes as controls. The Q331K mutation reduces solubility and increases aggregation of TDP-43 (Johnson et al., 2009; Lim et al., 2016), promotes cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates in mouse cortical and spinal cord motor neurons (Mitchell et al., 2015), and causes disruptions in TDP-43 function that are linked to neuronal death (Arnold et al., 2013). Notably, Q331K mutation also induces nucleocytoplasmic disruptions in neurons (Chou et al., 2018). However, its effects on human astrocytes have not been investigated.

We confirmed that isogenic controls and Q331K iPSC-astrocytes robustly expressed the astrocyte marker GFAP by day 60 of differentiation (Fig. 1H and I). iPSC-astrocytes were also immunopositive for the astrocyte marker SOX9, whereas the neuronal marker NeuN and the microglial marker Iba1 were not detectable (Supplementary Fig. S1E). Additionally, iPSC-astrocytes expressed astrocyte markers EGFR, SLC1A2, SLC1A3, FABP7, FAM107A, S100B, NFIA, and AQP4, as detected by RT-qPCR (Supplementary Fig. S1F). Immunolabeling for NUP-98 revealed that Q331K iPSC-astrocytes had increased extranuclear levels of NUP-98 as compared to isogenic control astrocytes, in which NUP-98 was localized primarily in the nucleus (Fig. 1J). In addition, Q331K iPSC-astrocytes had irregular nuclear envelope morphology and decreased nuclear circularity as compared to isogenic controls (Fig. 1K). Transfection with tdT-NES-NLS revealed increases in the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS levels in Q331K iPSC-astrocytes (Fig. 1L). Therefore, alterations in NUP-98 localization, nuclear envelope morphology, and nucleocytoplasmic protein transport were also detected in human astrocytes carrying a disease-associated mutation in TDP-43, independently of gene overexpression, providing further evidence that TDP-43 pathology causes nucleocytoplasmic disruptions in astrocytes.

3.2.Astrocyte nucleocytoplasmic disruptions are mediated by IL-1 receptors and NF-ÎºBAlthough the exact molecular mechanisms by which TDP-43 causes nucleocytoplasmic changes are not clear, TDP-43 pathology is increasingly linked to neuroimmune pathways, including activation of NF-ÎºB and alterations in interferon-linked factors and immune response genes (Licht-Murava et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). Notably, antiviral immune mechanisms might affect nucleocytoplasmic transport (Shen et al., 2021). Astrocytes are intimately involved in neuroimmune responses (Patani et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023) and can produce and respond to immune factors associated with inflammation, such as interleukin-1Î± (IL-1Î±), which activates NF-ÎºB (Dunn et al., 2002), induces astrocytic functional changes (Liddelow et al., 2017; Bretheau et al., 2022), and contributes to neurodegenerative conditions (Griffin and Mrak, 2002; Stojakovic et al., 2017). Recent findings also suggest that ÎNLS astrocytes have cell-autonomous increases in NF-ÎºB and STAT3 phosphorylation (Licht-Murava et al., 2023). Additionally, our analyses show that ÎNLS astrocytes and Q331K iPSC-astrocytes have increased levels of IL-1Î± protein (Supplementary Figs. S2A and S2B), further implicating neuroimmune mechanisms in TDP-43 pathology. However, it is not known if cytokines and related immune signaling pathways can induce nucleocytoplasmic changes and mediate the effects of TDP-43 dysregulation.To test whether TDP-43-related nucleocytoplasmic changes involve IL-1 receptor activity and/or NF-ÎºB signaling, we treated ÎNLS astrocytes with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1ra (1 Î¼g/ml) (Putnam et al., 2019), NF-ÎºB pathway inhibitor (NFÎºB-i) TPCA-1 (500 nM) (Robb et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2021), or vehicle control for 24 h. Compared to vehicle-treated astrocytes, ÎNLS astrocytes treated with IL-1ra or NFÎºB-i had reduced extranuclear NUP-98 levels (Fig. 2A and B) and improved nuclear circularity (Fig. 2C and D). IL-1ra and NFÎºB-i also prevented changes in protein trafficking as reflected by normalized cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS in ÎNLS astrocytes (Fig. 2E and F). Additionally, expression of a constitutively active form of IÎºB kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates and inactivates the inhibitory factor IÎºBÎ± and thus promotes NF-ÎºB activity, was sufficient to cause NUP-98 mislocalization in WT primary astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. S2C). To determine if STAT3, which has key roles in astrocytic responses to brain injury and disease (Ben Haim et al., 2015; Reichenbach et al., 2019), also promotes TDP-43-related changes, we treated ÎNLS astrocytes with the STAT3 inhibitor Stattic, but observed no effects on NUP-98 mislocalization (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Thus, astrocytic IL-1R/NF-ÎºB but not STAT3 signaling is required for TDP-43-related nucleocytoplasmic changes.We next assessed whether stimulation of astrocytic IL-1 receptors, which activate NF-ÎºB (Qian et al., 2001), is sufficient to induce nucleocytoplasmic disruptions. Indeed, WT primary mouse astrocytes treated with IL-1Î± (3 ng/ml) for 24 h had increased extranuclear levels of NUP-98 as compared to vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 3A and B). IL-1Î± also induced aberrant nuclear morphology (Fig. 3C and D) and increased cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio of tdT-NES-NLS as compared to controls (Fig. 3E and F). Total protein levels of NUP-98, lamin B, and tdT-NES-NLS were unchanged (Supplementary Figs. S2E-S2H). Similar to the effects of IL-1Î± in mouse astrocytes, IL-1Î±-treated human iPSC-derived astrocytes also had increased extranuclear levels of NUP-98 (Fig. 3G). In addition, IL-1Î±-treated human astrocytes had aberrant nuclear envelope morphology, decreased nuclear circularity (Fig. 3H), and altered levels of cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS as compared to vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 3I and J). Together, these data indicate that IL-1Î± stimulation is sufficient to induce astrocytic nucleocytoplasmic alterations in mouse and human cells, with changes closely mirroring the effects of TDP-43 dysregulation. We postulate that other neuroimmune stimuli that activate or suppress astrocytic NF-ÎºB signaling may also influence nucleocytoplasmic dynamics as well as modulate the effects of TDP-43 pathology.

Astrocyte nucleocytoplasmic disruptions are mediated by IL-1 receptors and NF-ÎºB

Although the exact molecular mechanisms by which TDP-43 causes nucleocytoplasmic changes are not clear, TDP-43 pathology is increasingly linked to neuroimmune pathways, including activation of NF-ÎºB and alterations in interferon-linked factors and immune response genes (Licht-Murava et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). Notably, antiviral immune mechanisms might affect nucleocytoplasmic transport (Shen et al., 2021). Astrocytes are intimately involved in neuroimmune responses (Patani et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023) and can produce and respond to immune factors associated with inflammation, such as interleukin-1Î± (IL-1Î±), which activates NF-ÎºB (Dunn et al., 2002), induces astrocytic functional changes (Liddelow et al., 2017; Bretheau et al., 2022), and contributes to neurodegenerative conditions (Griffin and Mrak, 2002; Stojakovic et al., 2017). Recent findings also suggest that ÎNLS astrocytes have cell-autonomous increases in NF-ÎºB and STAT3 phosphorylation (Licht-Murava et al., 2023). Additionally, our analyses show that ÎNLS astrocytes and Q331K iPSC-astrocytes have increased levels of IL-1Î± protein (Supplementary Figs. S2A and S2B), further implicating neuroimmune mechanisms in TDP-43 pathology. However, it is not known if cytokines and related immune signaling pathways can induce nucleocytoplasmic changes and mediate the effects of TDP-43 dysregulation.

To test whether TDP-43-related nucleocytoplasmic changes involve IL-1 receptor activity and/or NF-ÎºB signaling, we treated ÎNLS astrocytes with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1ra (1 Î¼g/ml) (Putnam et al., 2019), NF-ÎºB pathway inhibitor (NFÎºB-i) TPCA-1 (500 nM) (Robb et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2021), or vehicle control for 24 h. Compared to vehicle-treated astrocytes, ÎNLS astrocytes treated with IL-1ra or NFÎºB-i had reduced extranuclear NUP-98 levels (Fig. 2A and B) and improved nuclear circularity (Fig. 2C and D). IL-1ra and NFÎºB-i also prevented changes in protein trafficking as reflected by normalized cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS in ÎNLS astrocytes (Fig. 2E and F). Additionally, expression of a constitutively active form of IÎºB kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates and inactivates the inhibitory factor IÎºBÎ± and thus promotes NF-ÎºB activity, was sufficient to cause NUP-98 mislocalization in WT primary astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. S2C). To determine if STAT3, which has key roles in astrocytic responses to brain injury and disease (Ben Haim et al., 2015; Reichenbach et al., 2019), also promotes TDP-43-related changes, we treated ÎNLS astrocytes with the STAT3 inhibitor Stattic, but observed no effects on NUP-98 mislocalization (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Thus, astrocytic IL-1R/NF-ÎºB but not STAT3 signaling is required for TDP-43-related nucleocytoplasmic changes.

We next assessed whether stimulation of astrocytic IL-1 receptors, which activate NF-ÎºB (Qian et al., 2001), is sufficient to induce nucleocytoplasmic disruptions. Indeed, WT primary mouse astrocytes treated with IL-1Î± (3 ng/ml) for 24 h had increased extranuclear levels of NUP-98 as compared to vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 3A and B). IL-1Î± also induced aberrant nuclear morphology (Fig. 3C and D) and increased cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio of tdT-NES-NLS as compared to controls (Fig. 3E and F). Total protein levels of NUP-98, lamin B, and tdT-NES-NLS were unchanged (Supplementary Figs. S2E-S2H). Similar to the effects of IL-1Î± in mouse astrocytes, IL-1Î±-treated human iPSC-derived astrocytes also had increased extranuclear levels of NUP-98 (Fig. 3G). In addition, IL-1Î±-treated human astrocytes had aberrant nuclear envelope morphology, decreased nuclear circularity (Fig. 3H), and altered levels of cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS as compared to vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 3I and J). Together, these data indicate that IL-1Î± stimulation is sufficient to induce astrocytic nucleocytoplasmic alterations in mouse and human cells, with changes closely mirroring the effects of TDP-43 dysregulation. We postulate that other neuroimmune stimuli that activate or suppress astrocytic NF-ÎºB signaling may also influence nucleocytoplasmic dynamics as well as modulate the effects of TDP-43 pathology.

3.3.TDP-43 pathology and neuroinflammation induce astrocyte nucleocytoplasmic protein transport alterations in vivoWe next examined whether changes in nucleocytoplasmic function occur in vivo using a mouse model with astrocyte-targeted TDP-43 pathology. To induce TDP-43 pathology in adulthood, we used double transgenic tet-off ÎNLS mice (Igaz et al., 2011) with astrocytic expression of mutant TDP-43 in astrocytes (Licht-Murava et al., 2023), as well as single transgenic and non-transgenic control littermates. All mice received doxycycline until weaning age to prevent transgene effects on early development.In brain tissue, astrocytic NUP-98 and lamin B-positive nuclei could not be clearly visualized in astrocytes for reliable quantification. For assessing astrocytic nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, mice were injected retro-orbitally at 8â10 months of age with a PHP.eB adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector (Chan et al., 2017) (1e12 Vg/mouse) encoding tdT-NES-NLS under the control of GfaABC1D promoter to enable astrocyte-specific targeting (Licht-Murava et al., 2023). After three weeks, expression of tdT-NES-NLS protein was detected in S100Î²-positive astrocytes throughout the neocortex of injected mice (Fig. 4A and B). Transgene expression was confirmed to primarily target astrocytes (Supplementary Figs. S3A and S3B), which showed their characteristic tiling across cortical areas and bushy morphology (Fig. 4B). Immunolabeling was used to quantify the levels of tdT-NES-NLS in the nucleus and extranuclear compartment of individual astrocytes, as defined by DAPI and GFAP immunolabeling, respectively.Consistent with the results in cultured cells, astrocytes in ÎNLS mice but not single transgenic controls had increased cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS as compared to nontransgenic (NTG) mice (Fig. 4B and C). Although total cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of tdT-NES-NLS were both increased in ÎNLS and single transgenic controls (Supplementary Figs. S3C and S3D), only ÎNLS mice had altered cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios (Fig. 4C), suggesting that increases in total protein were not sufficient to cause nucleocytoplasmic alterations. Together with the results in mouse and human cell cultures, these findings suggest that astrocytic TDP-43 pathology is associated with nucleocytoplasmic alterations and that these effects are detectable across species and different model systems and types of TDP-43 perturbations.Based on our findings that cytokine exposure can induce nucleocytoplasmic changes in isolated astrocytes (Figs. 2 and 3), we next asked whether neuroinflammation is sufficient to promote nucleocytoplasmic changes in astrocytes in vivo in the absence of TDP-43 pathology. To address this question, we used systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in adult WT mice to model acute neuroinflammation, which involves increased IL-1 expression and NF-ÎºB activation in the brain (Lieberman et al., 1989; Baldwin Jr., 1996; Hasel et al., 2021; Diaz-Castro et al., 2021), along with various other immune responses. Unlike the culture models, systemic LPS exposure induces complex physiological immune cascades in the brain and periphery and enables testing of how neuroinflammation affects astrocytes in vivo (Hasel et al., 2021; Diaz-Castro et al., 2021).To assess changes in nucleocytoplasmic transport in astrocytes, we injected 9-month-old Aldh1l1-Cre mice (Tien et al., 2012) retro-orbitally with a Cre-dependent AAV vector PHP.eB-GfaABC1D-DIO-tdT-NES-NLS (1e12 Vg/mouse). After three weeks, expression of tdT-NES-NLS was astrocyte-specific and pronounced in the neocortex (Fig. 4D and E, and Supplementary Fig. S3E). Mice were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of LPS (5 mg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) before analyses of astrocytic tdT-NES-NLS localization at 6 or 24 h post-injection. GFAP and DAPI labeling within individual neocortical astrocytes were used to define the localization of tdT-NES-NLS in extranuclear and nuclear regions, respectively. Consistent with the results in cultured cells and ÎNLS mice, astrocytes in LPS-injected mice had increased cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS as compared to vehicle controls at 6 and 24 h (Fig. 4E and F, and Supplementary Figs. S3G and S3H). Thus, neuroinflammation is sufficient to alter nucleocytoplasmic protein distribution in astrocytes in vivo, similar to the effects of TDP-43 dysregulation, further linking neuroimmune pathways to nucleocytoplasmic alterations.

TDP-43 pathology and neuroinflammation induce astrocyte nucleocytoplasmic protein transport alterations in vivo

We next examined whether changes in nucleocytoplasmic function occur in vivo using a mouse model with astrocyte-targeted TDP-43 pathology. To induce TDP-43 pathology in adulthood, we used double transgenic tet-off ÎNLS mice (Igaz et al., 2011) with astrocytic expression of mutant TDP-43 in astrocytes (Licht-Murava et al., 2023), as well as single transgenic and non-transgenic control littermates. All mice received doxycycline until weaning age to prevent transgene effects on early development.

In brain tissue, astrocytic NUP-98 and lamin B-positive nuclei could not be clearly visualized in astrocytes for reliable quantification. For assessing astrocytic nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, mice were injected retro-orbitally at 8â10 months of age with a PHP.eB adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector (Chan et al., 2017) (1e12 Vg/mouse) encoding tdT-NES-NLS under the control of GfaABC1D promoter to enable astrocyte-specific targeting (Licht-Murava et al., 2023). After three weeks, expression of tdT-NES-NLS protein was detected in S100Î²-positive astrocytes throughout the neocortex of injected mice (Fig. 4A and B). Transgene expression was confirmed to primarily target astrocytes (Supplementary Figs. S3A and S3B), which showed their characteristic tiling across cortical areas and bushy morphology (Fig. 4B). Immunolabeling was used to quantify the levels of tdT-NES-NLS in the nucleus and extranuclear compartment of individual astrocytes, as defined by DAPI and GFAP immunolabeling, respectively.

Consistent with the results in cultured cells, astrocytes in ÎNLS mice but not single transgenic controls had increased cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS as compared to nontransgenic (NTG) mice (Fig. 4B and C). Although total cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of tdT-NES-NLS were both increased in ÎNLS and single transgenic controls (Supplementary Figs. S3C and S3D), only ÎNLS mice had altered cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios (Fig. 4C), suggesting that increases in total protein were not sufficient to cause nucleocytoplasmic alterations. Together with the results in mouse and human cell cultures, these findings suggest that astrocytic TDP-43 pathology is associated with nucleocytoplasmic alterations and that these effects are detectable across species and different model systems and types of TDP-43 perturbations.

Based on our findings that cytokine exposure can induce nucleocytoplasmic changes in isolated astrocytes (Figs. 2 and 3), we next asked whether neuroinflammation is sufficient to promote nucleocytoplasmic changes in astrocytes in vivo in the absence of TDP-43 pathology. To address this question, we used systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in adult WT mice to model acute neuroinflammation, which involves increased IL-1 expression and NF-ÎºB activation in the brain (Lieberman et al., 1989; Baldwin Jr., 1996; Hasel et al., 2021; Diaz-Castro et al., 2021), along with various other immune responses. Unlike the culture models, systemic LPS exposure induces complex physiological immune cascades in the brain and periphery and enables testing of how neuroinflammation affects astrocytes in vivo (Hasel et al., 2021; Diaz-Castro et al., 2021).

To assess changes in nucleocytoplasmic transport in astrocytes, we injected 9-month-old Aldh1l1-Cre mice (Tien et al., 2012) retro-orbitally with a Cre-dependent AAV vector PHP.eB-GfaABC1D-DIO-tdT-NES-NLS (1e12 Vg/mouse). After three weeks, expression of tdT-NES-NLS was astrocyte-specific and pronounced in the neocortex (Fig. 4D and E, and Supplementary Fig. S3E). Mice were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of LPS (5 mg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) before analyses of astrocytic tdT-NES-NLS localization at 6 or 24 h post-injection. GFAP and DAPI labeling within individual neocortical astrocytes were used to define the localization of tdT-NES-NLS in extranuclear and nuclear regions, respectively. Consistent with the results in cultured cells and ÎNLS mice, astrocytes in LPS-injected mice had increased cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS as compared to vehicle controls at 6 and 24 h (Fig. 4E and F, and Supplementary Figs. S3G and S3H). Thus, neuroinflammation is sufficient to alter nucleocytoplasmic protein distribution in astrocytes in vivo, similar to the effects of TDP-43 dysregulation, further linking neuroimmune pathways to nucleocytoplasmic alterations.

3.4.Astrocyte nucleocytoplasmic changes are induced rapidly but resolve slowlyTo further characterize the cytokine-induced effects and temporal dynamics of nucleocytoplasmic changes, we treated WT primary mouse astrocytes with IL-1Î± or vehicle for different durations prior to analysis of NUP-98 localization, nuclear envelope morphological changes, and nucleocytoplasmic protein trafficking. We found that extranuclear NUP-98 mislocalization was detectable as early as 15 min following IL-1Î± treatment, increased further within 1 h, and then remained stable for at least 6 h (Figs. 5A-5C). The rapid onset suggests that extranuclear NUP-98 accumulation is an early feature of astrocytic responses to IL-1 receptor activation and that existing, rather than newly synthesized, NUP-98 becomes mislocalized. Additionally, prominent changes in nuclear envelope circularity occurred as soon as 2 h after receptor stimulation (Figs. 5D-5F). To assess the timing of nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, astrocytes were transfected with tdT-NES-NLS and then treated with IL-1Î± for different durations. Cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS were increased by 2 h after treatment and remained elevated for at least 6 h (Fig. 5G and H). Together, these analyses suggest that changes in NUP-98 localization occur within minutes of stimulation and precede changes in nuclear envelope morphology and nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, which occur in parallel within hours of stimulation.We next asked whether these rapid changes were reversible or remained stable following stimulation. After 24 h of IL-1Î± treatment, WT astrocytes were washed and maintained in IL-1Î±-free media for varying timepoints prior to analyses. We found that changes in NUP-98 localization persisted for at least 24 h post-washout, but these effects were reversible, as NUP-98 returned to a predominantly nuclear localization after 72 h of washout (Fig. 5I and J). Therefore, NUP-98 remains mislocalized beyond the initial response period but resolves within days. Similarly, abnormal nuclear circularity persisted 24 h after stimulation but was resolved by 72 h of washout (Fig. 5K and L). Cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS also returned to baseline by 72 h post-washout but not earlier (Fig. 5M and N), further revealing that IL-1 induces rapid and prolonged changes in nucleocytoplasmic dynamics that likely affect astrocytic homeostasis and might influence disease responses.We next examined the spatiotemporal relationship between IL-1Î±-induced extranuclear NUP-98 accumulation and increases in lipocalin-2, an astrocytic factor linked to reactivity states and disease pathogenesis. Of note, astrocytic lipocalin-2 is known to be increased in neuroinflammation and may promote neural impairments and cognitive decline in brain injury and disease (Kim et al., 2024). We found that lipocalin-2 protein levels were rapidly increased in WT mouse astrocytes within 6 h of IL-1Î± treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4A). However, at this timepoint, there were no detectable differences in lipocalin-2 induction among individual astrocytes with varying levels of extranuclear NUP-98 accumulation (Supplementary Fig. S4B), suggesting that nucleocytoplasmic alterations are occurring in concert with astrocytic reactivity mechanisms and might modulate certain types of astrocytic responses and signaling pathways in disease.

Astrocyte nucleocytoplasmic changes are induced rapidly but resolve slowly

To further characterize the cytokine-induced effects and temporal dynamics of nucleocytoplasmic changes, we treated WT primary mouse astrocytes with IL-1Î± or vehicle for different durations prior to analysis of NUP-98 localization, nuclear envelope morphological changes, and nucleocytoplasmic protein trafficking. We found that extranuclear NUP-98 mislocalization was detectable as early as 15 min following IL-1Î± treatment, increased further within 1 h, and then remained stable for at least 6 h (Figs. 5A-5C). The rapid onset suggests that extranuclear NUP-98 accumulation is an early feature of astrocytic responses to IL-1 receptor activation and that existing, rather than newly synthesized, NUP-98 becomes mislocalized. Additionally, prominent changes in nuclear envelope circularity occurred as soon as 2 h after receptor stimulation (Figs. 5D-5F). To assess the timing of nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, astrocytes were transfected with tdT-NES-NLS and then treated with IL-1Î± for different durations. Cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS were increased by 2 h after treatment and remained elevated for at least 6 h (Fig. 5G and H). Together, these analyses suggest that changes in NUP-98 localization occur within minutes of stimulation and precede changes in nuclear envelope morphology and nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, which occur in parallel within hours of stimulation.

We next asked whether these rapid changes were reversible or remained stable following stimulation. After 24 h of IL-1Î± treatment, WT astrocytes were washed and maintained in IL-1Î±-free media for varying timepoints prior to analyses. We found that changes in NUP-98 localization persisted for at least 24 h post-washout, but these effects were reversible, as NUP-98 returned to a predominantly nuclear localization after 72 h of washout (Fig. 5I and J). Therefore, NUP-98 remains mislocalized beyond the initial response period but resolves within days. Similarly, abnormal nuclear circularity persisted 24 h after stimulation but was resolved by 72 h of washout (Fig. 5K and L). Cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS also returned to baseline by 72 h post-washout but not earlier (Fig. 5M and N), further revealing that IL-1 induces rapid and prolonged changes in nucleocytoplasmic dynamics that likely affect astrocytic homeostasis and might influence disease responses.

We next examined the spatiotemporal relationship between IL-1Î±-induced extranuclear NUP-98 accumulation and increases in lipocalin-2, an astrocytic factor linked to reactivity states and disease pathogenesis. Of note, astrocytic lipocalin-2 is known to be increased in neuroinflammation and may promote neural impairments and cognitive decline in brain injury and disease (Kim et al., 2024). We found that lipocalin-2 protein levels were rapidly increased in WT mouse astrocytes within 6 h of IL-1Î± treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4A). However, at this timepoint, there were no detectable differences in lipocalin-2 induction among individual astrocytes with varying levels of extranuclear NUP-98 accumulation (Supplementary Fig. S4B), suggesting that nucleocytoplasmic alterations are occurring in concert with astrocytic reactivity mechanisms and might modulate certain types of astrocytic responses and signaling pathways in disease.

3.5.Nucleocytoplasmic changes in astrocytes are associated with stress granules and mediated by integrated stress response pathwaysThe molecular mechanisms promoting nucleocytoplasmic changes downstream of IL-1 receptors are not known. Notably, stress granule formation is a rapidly induced response to cellular stress (Youn et al., 2019) and can influence nucleocytoplasmic processes by sequestering nucleoporins and nuclear transport factors (Zhang et al., 2018). Formation and misprocessing of persistent stress granules occur in neurons in diverse neurodegenerative contexts (Wolozin and Ivanov, 2019). Although typically linked to disease pathogenesis, stress granules also have beneficial effects and can promote cell recovery from stress (Paget et al., 2023; Bussi et al., 2023). However, stress granules have not been extensively studied in glial cells, and it is not known if cytokines or immune-related signaling pathways can induce stress granules in astrocytes and possibly promote nucleocytoplasmic alterations. Thus, we investigated whether IL-1Î± can induce astrocytic stress granule formation and whether stress-related pathways contribute to nucleocytoplasmic changes.Primary astrocytes were treated with either sodium arsenite (SA), a known inducer of stress granules (Zhang et al., 2018), IL-1Î±, or vehicle for 30 min, and then monitored for stress granule formation. Stress granules were visualized by labeling for cytoplasmic mRNAs with oligo (dT) fluorescent probes, along with co-labeling for human antigen R (HuR), which is encoded by ELAV-like 1 (Elavl1) gene and known as an RNA-binding protein that localizes to stress granules. This dual-marker approach ensures reliable, high-confidence detection of stress granules, as reported previously in various cell types (Aulas et al., 2015) and confirmed in astrocytes treated with SA (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Importantly, IL-1Î± treatment induced a robust increase in the number (Fig. 6A and B) and size (Supplementary Fig. S4D) of oligo(dT) and HuR double-positive stress granules in astrocytes, and the stress granules were immunopositive for NUP-98 (Fig. 6A). These results suggest that IL-1 stimulation is sufficient to induce astrocytic stress granule formation and promote extranuclear sequestration of NUP-98.Stress granule formation is regulated in part by integrated stress responses (ISR), which lead to upregulation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (Sidrauski et al., 2015; Anand and Walter, 2020; Zyryanova et al., 2021). Indeed, treatment of control iPSC-astrocytes with IL-1Î± caused marked increases in ATF4 RNA levels at acute timepoints, providing further support that IL-1Î± rapidly induces ISR (Supplementary Fig. S4E). The ISR inhibitor ISRIB prevents stress granule formation by binding to eIF2Î² (Anand and Walter, 2020; Zyryanova et al., 2021). We found that astrocytes pre-treated with ISRIB (2 Î¼M) prior to stimulation with IL-1Î± had fewer (Fig. 6A and B) and smaller (Supplementary Fig. S4D) stress granules. Moreover, ISRIB treatment fully prevented IL-1Î±-induced extranuclear NUP-98 accumulation (Fig. 6A and C), suggesting that cytokine stimulation promotes stress granule formation and changes in nucleoporin localization through ISR pathways. We also assessed whether ISR activation is required for IL-1Î±-induced changes in nuclear morphology and nucleocytoplasmic protein transport. ISRIB treatment prevented IL-1Î±-induced changes in astrocytic nuclear circularity (Fig. 6D and E) and cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios of tdT-NES-NLS (Fig. 6F and G), suggesting that ISR mediates astrocytic stress granule accumulation and nucleocytoplasmic alterations in response to cytokine stimulation. Notably, stress granules induced by IL-1Î± treatment returned to baseline levels by 24 h of washout and continued to be minimal at 72 h after washout (Supplementary Fig. 4F), consistent with the observed reversibility and recovery of nucleocytoplasmic alterations and suggesting that stress granules can resolve at a faster rate than the nucleocytoplasmic changes.Given that TDP-43 pathology is linked to aberrant stress granule formation in multiple cell types (Ratti et al., 2020), including astrocytes (Khalfallah et al., 2018), we next hypothesized that TDP-43 pathology-related nucleocytoplasmic changes are also mediated by ISR pathways. Consistent with this notion, ÎNLS astrocytes had more cytoplasmic stress granules at baseline (Fig. 6H and I), which were also larger than the sparse stress granules detected in WT astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. S4G), and these stress granules were immunopositive for NUP-98 (Fig. 6H). Treatment of ÎNLS astrocytes with ISRIB was effective in suppressing stress granules (Fig. 6H and I), reducing stress granule size (Supplementary Fig. S4G), and reducing extranuclear NUP-98 levels (Fig. 6H and J). Moreover, ÎNLS astrocytes treated with ISRIB had nuclei that appeared more circular as compared to vehicle-treated ÎNLS astrocytes, and nuclear circularity was similar to WT controls (Fig. 6K and L). ÎNLS astrocytes treated with ISRIB also had cytoplasmic-to-nuclear tdT-NES-NLS ratios comparable to WT controls (Fig. 6M and N), linking astrocytic ISR pathways to changes in nucleocytoplasmic protein transport. Moreover, inhibition of NF-ÎºB reduced stress granules in ÎNLS astrocytes (Fig. 6O), further linking this signaling pathway to intrinsic stress responses in TDP-43 pathology.Together, our findings reveal that dementia-related TDP-43 dysregulation induces astrocytic stress granule formation and nucleocytoplasmic changes through neuroimmune signaling and activation of ISR pathways. These results establish that astrocytic responses to proteinopathy and neuroinflammatory stimuli converge onto stress-related pathways that broadly modulate nucleocytoplasmic processes.

Together, our findings reveal that dementia-related TDP-43 dysregulation induces astrocytic stress granule formation and nucleocytoplasmic changes through neuroimmune signaling and activation of ISR pathways. These results establish that astrocytic responses to proteinopathy and neuroinflammatory stimuli converge onto stress-related pathways that broadly modulate nucleocytoplasmic processes.

4.DiscussionTDP-43 pathology and other types of proteinopathies are associated with nuclear pore complex dysfunction and nucleocytoplasmic alterations in neurons (Coyne and Rothstein, 2022), but whether these changes also occur in astrocytes has not been explored. In neurons, nucleocytoplasmic changes, such as nucleoporin mislocalization, altered nuclear morphology, and altered nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, can promote cell toxicity and impair neural function (Coyne et al., 2020; Fare and Rothstein, 2024). Here, we used complementary in vitro and in vivo model systems, cell type-targeted molecular manipulations, and multiple subcellular analyses to define cell-autonomous nucleocytoplasmic responses in astrocytes and identify their upstream mechanisms. We found that chronic TDP-43 pathology or acute neuroimmune stimulation can induce robust nucleocytoplasmic alterations in mouse and human astrocytes. Although TDP-43 proteinopathy is a known hallmark of ALS and FTD, the mechanisms by which TDP-43 contributes to neurodegeneration are complex and may involve gain and loss of function effects in various cell types (Tziortzouda et al., 2021). Using overexpression systems in mice as well as human iPSC-derived cells with a disease-causing mutant form of TDP-43, we found that different types of TDP-43 alterations in astrocytes cause nucleocytoplasmic changes, likely due to shared effects on immune signaling. Indeed, immune signaling involving NF-ÎºB was necessary and sufficient to rapidly induce nucleocytoplasmic changes in the absence of proteinopathy.We found that astrocytic NUP-98 mislocalization is an early response, preceding morphological changes in the nuclear envelope and disruptions in nucleocytoplasmic transport. NUP-98 is known to be a dynamic nucleoporin that can localize to the nuclear and cytoplasmic domains of the nuclear pore complex (Griffis et al., 2003). When bound to the nuclear pore, NUP-98 regulates permeability of the central channel (Schmidt and GÃ¶rlich, 2015), whereas in the nucleus, NUP-98 is involved in transcription and export of RNA (Capitanio et al., 2018; Griffis et al., 2002; Franks et al., 2016), and its mobility is decreased upon inhibition of transcription (Griffis et al., 2002). Intranuclear NUP-98 may regulate expression of antiviral and interferon-inducible genes by interacting with transcription factors (Light et al., 2013; Panda et al.,2015), suggesting that NUP-98 mislocalization may contribute to or modulate neuroimmune responses in disease. Nuclear localization of NUP-98 is also required for protein import into the nucleus (Fontoura et al., 2000), further implicating NUP-98 mislocalization in potentially altering protein trafficking and other fundamental processes. In support, human gene variations in different nucleoporins can disrupt CNS function and affect other organs (Fare and Rothstein, 2024; JÃ¼hlen and Fahrenkrog, 2023). In addition to NUP-98 being linked to TDP-43-related pathogenesis in ALS and FTD, neuronal NUP-98 is also mislocalized extranuclearly in AD and primary tauopathies (Eftekharzadeh et al., 2018; Dickson et al., 2023), and can localize to stress granules (Hochberg-Laufer et al., 2019), indicating that mislocalization of nucleoporins, especially NUP-98, is a common feature in neurodegenerative conditions. Despite the mounting evidence linking NUP-98 to disease and stress responses, how NUP-98 localization is regulated and what functions NUP-98 might have in the cytoplasm remain unknown. Our findings reveal that astrocytic nucleoporins are regulated by neuroimmune signaling and likely play key roles in various conditions associated with neuroinflammation.We reveal that IL-1 and NF-ÎºB signaling, which are induced by TDP-43 pathology (Licht-Murava et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2015), mediate nucleocytoplasmic changes in astrocytes with TDP-43 pathology. In agreement, maladaptive neuroimmune responses, including altered cytokine and chemokine secretion and activation of antiviral and other innate immune mechanisms, are increasingly associated with TDP-43 dysregulation and dementia pathogenesis (Licht-Murava et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). Astrocytic IL-1 receptor signaling is implicated in various pathogenic conditions (Voet et al., 2019; Rauf et al., 2022), and promotes astrocytic secretion of various factors (Rauf et al., 2022), leading to multiple functional consequences (Liddelow et al., 2017; Garber et al., 2018). IL-1ra has been tested in acute CNS injury and neurodegenerative pathology and might have therapeutic value by modulating neuroinflammation (Simi et al., 2007; Spulber et al., 2009). Similarly, astrocytic NF-ÎºB signaling, which is induced by IL-1 receptors, is implicated in neurodegeneration (Lattke et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2022), with its activity dependent on translocation into the nucleus to regulate transcription of diverse target genes (Lian et al., 2015). Despite these advances, the effects of IL-1 receptor activation and NF-ÎºB signaling on nucleocytoplasmic changes were not known. Our results suggest that these immune mechanisms induce rapid nucleocytoplasmic changes in astrocytes that in turn might impact various aspects of cell function and disease pathogenesis.We further demonstrate that astrocytic nucleocytoplasmic changes are associated with the formation of stress granules. Stress granules are heterogenous and dynamic, and although stress granules are cytoprotective when transient and resolving, they can be deleterious in the context of disease if persistent or insoluble (Protter and Parker, 2016; Advani and Ivanov, 2020). TDP-43 plays a key role in stress granule formation upon cell stress (Colombrita et al., 2009; McDonald et al., 2011), and ALS, FTD, and other neurodegenerative diseases are associated with decreased clearance of stress granules (Lee et al., 2016; Coyne et al., 2017). We found that mislocalized astrocytic NUP-98 was at least partly colocalized with cytoplasmic stress granules. In support, multiple nucleoporins including NUP-98, NUP-62, POM121, and NUP-205, and nucleocytoplasmic transport factors, including Gle1, importin-Î±, importin-Î², and exportin-1, can mislocalize to stress granules in other cell types (Hochberg-Laufer et al., 2019), leading to nucleocytoplasmic alterations (Zhang et al., 2018; Glass and Wente, 2019). The observed persistence of astrocytic NUP-98 mislocalization and other nucleocytoplasmic changes for up to three days after IL-1 receptor stimulation suggests that these alterations might cause lingering pathological changes. Whether stress granule sequestration of nucleoporins impacts stress granule assembly, solubility, and persistence remains to be explored.Although TDP-43 pathology is canonically associated with stress granule formation in neurons, we show that neuroimmune signaling is sufficient to induce stress granules in astrocytes. These findings suggest that neuroinflammatory cascades can engage astrocytic stress response mechanisms and nucleocytoplasmic alterations in the absence of apparent proteinopathy. In support, stress granule formation in other model systems can be induced by inflammatory cytokines TNF-Î± and IFN-Î³ (Hu et al., 2010). Stress granules can in turn regulate innate immune pathways (Paget et al., 2023; Onomoto et al., 2014), and may be resolved by anti-inflammatory factors (Herman et al., 2019). Stress granules can suppress antiviral responses and serve protective roles in viral infections and in response to aberrant changes in host-derived nucleic acids (Paget et al., 2023; Onomoto et al., 2014). Notably, aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation of host nucleic acids is implicated in TDP-43-linked pathogenesis and other processes (Yu et al., 2020; Milstead et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024), suggesting that stress granules might alleviate the toxic effects of RNA and DNA dyshomeostasis in disease, especially if the stress granules are able to resolve. Thus, stress granules may be an integral component of innate immune signaling and regulate inflammation. The balance between beneficial and detrimental effects of stress granules is not well-understood, but the intimate relationship between stress granules and immune signaling suggests that their exact roles are dependent on the specific upstream triggers, disease context, recruited components, and their resolution. In support, there may be functional differences between acute and chronic neuroinflammation-associated stress granules (Cui et al., 2024). Further investigation of astrocytic stress granules in neuroinflammation and proteinopathy may provide crucial mechanistic insights into glial pathobiology and neurodegenerative processes.Our study also reveals that astrocytic nucleocytoplasmic changes and stress granules induced by either TDP-43 pathology or neuroimmune signaling are dependent on ISR activation. Increased activities of ISR pathway kinases have been reported in ALS (Ilieva et al., 2007), and TDP-43 pathology in motor neurons increases ISR effectors prior to disease onset (Luan et al., 2023). Although the exact effects of ISR mechanisms on astrocytic functions require additional studies, human mutations in the ISR mediator eIF2Î² cause vanishing white matter disease through a mechanism involving ISR dysfunction in astrocytes (Dooves et al., 2016), highlighting the importance of astrocytic ISR pathways in the CNS. Of note, astrocytic ISR can also be induced non-cell-autonomously by neuronal tauopathy (Batenburg et al., 2023). Our results reveal that astrocytic ISR is engaged by TDP-43 dysregulation and neuroimmune signaling and promotes nucleocytoplasmic disruptions. One of the main inducers of ISR is protein kinase R (PKR), a double-stranded RNA sensor that regulates antiviral immune responses (GarcÃ­a et al., 2006). Notably, PKR is increased in ÎNLS astrocytes (Licht-Murava et al., 2023), mediates the effects of TDP-43 reductions in astrocytes (LaRocca et al., 2019), and may serve as a sensor of proteostasis (Davidson et al., 2022), further implicating astrocytic ISR in TDP-43 pathology. Thus, astrocytic stress response pathways are likely interlinked with neuroimmune signaling and represent potential therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative disease and other neurological conditions involving aberrant neuroimmune pathways.Our study establishes nucleocytoplasmic changes in astrocytes with different TDP-43 alterations and in the context of neuroimmune stimulation and elucidates specific molecular mechanisms underlying these changes. Given the technical challenges of selectively manipulating nucleocytoplasmic changes without affecting various other intracellular functions, it remains unknown whether these changes are necessary for neuroimmune responses and could be selectively targeted to prevent astrocytic dysfunction in disease. Additional studies are needed to fully define the intricate and likely bidirectional interplay between nucleo-cytoplasmic changes, neuroimmune signaling, and integrated stress response pathways. Further research examining the effects of specific ISR mediators on various astrocytic functions, including astrocytic reactivity states and interactions with other neural cell types, will enhance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and functional roles of these pathways in normal and pathogenic conditions.

TDP-43 pathology and other types of proteinopathies are associated with nuclear pore complex dysfunction and nucleocytoplasmic alterations in neurons (Coyne and Rothstein, 2022), but whether these changes also occur in astrocytes has not been explored.

Our results reveal that astrocytic ISR is engaged by TDP-43 dysregulation and neuroimmune signaling and promotes nucleocytoplasmic disruptions. One of the main inducers of ISR is protein kinase R (PKR), a double-stranded RNA sensor that regulates antiviral immune responses (GarcÃ­a et al., 2006). Notably, PKR is increased in ÎNLS astrocytes (Licht-Murava et al., 2023), mediates the effects of TDP-43 reductions in astrocytes (LaRocca et al., 2019), and may serve as a sensor of proteostasis (Davidson et al., 2022), further implicating astrocytic ISR in TDP-43 pathology. Thus, astrocytic stress response pathways are likely interlinked with neuroimmune signaling and represent potential therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative disease and other neurological conditions involving aberrant neuroimmune pathways.

Our study establishes nucleocytoplasmic changes in astrocytes with different TDP-43 alterations and in the context of neuroimmune stimulation and elucidates specific molecular mechanisms underlying these changes. Given the technical challenges of selectively manipulating nucleocytoplasmic changes without affecting various other intracellular functions, it remains unknown whether these changes are necessary for neuroimmune responses and could be selectively targeted to prevent astrocytic dysfunction in disease. Additional studies are needed to fully define the intricate and likely bidirectional interplay between nucleo-cytoplasmic changes, neuroimmune signaling, and integrated stress response pathways. Further research examining the effects of specific ISR mediators on various astrocytic functions, including astrocytic reactivity states and interactions with other neural cell types, will enhance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and functional roles of these pathways in normal and pathogenic conditions.

5.ConclusionsWe used complementary model systems of TDP-43 pathology to define nucleocytoplasmic responses in astrocytes and identify their upstream mechanisms. We found that chronic TDP-43 pathology or acute neuroimmune stimulation can induce robust nucleocytoplasmic alterations in mouse and human astrocytes, including nucleoporin mislocalization, nuclear morphology alterations, and changes in nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, which were mediated by IL-1 and NF-ÎºB signaling. We show that these nucleocytoplasmic changes involve integrated stress response signaling mechanisms and are associated with formation of stress granules, which have previously been characterized in neuronal models of proteinopathy but were not known to occur in astrocytes. Collectively, our results establish that stress granule formation and the associated nucleocytoplasmic changes are key features of astrocytic responses to TDP-43 dysregulation and neuroimmune stimulation, which are hallmarks of various neurodegenerative conditions, including FTD, ALS, and AD. These findings suggest that maladaptive immune signaling and abnormal proteostasis converge in astrocytes onto stress-related pathways, which may represent promising mechanisms for therapeutic intervention.
