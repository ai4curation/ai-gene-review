Neurofibromas are common tumors found in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) 
patients. These complex tumors are composed of Schwann cells, mast cells, 
fibroblasts and perineurial cells embedded in collagen that provide a lattice 
for tumor invasion. Genetic studies demonstrate that in neurofibromas, 
nullizygous loss of Nf1 in Schwann cells and haploinsufficiency of Nf1 in 
non-neuronal cells are required for tumorigenesis. Fibroblasts are a major 
cellular constituent in neurofibromas and are a source of collagen that 
constitutes approximately 50% of the dry weight of the tumor. Here, we show that 
two of the prevalent heterozygous cells found in neurofibromas, mast cells and 
fibroblasts interact directly to contribute to tumor phenotype. Nf1+/- mast 
cells secrete elevated concentrations of the profibrotic transforming growth 
factor-beta (TGF-beta). In response to TGF-beta, both murine Nf1+/- fibroblasts 
and fibroblasts from human neurofibromas proliferate and synthesize excessive 
collagen, a hallmark of neurofibromas. We also establish that the TGF-beta 
response occurs via hyperactivation of a novel Ras-c-abl signaling pathway. 
Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of c-abl reverses fibroblast proliferation 
and collagen synthesis to wild-type levels. These studies identify a novel 
molecular target to inhibit neurofibroma formation.
