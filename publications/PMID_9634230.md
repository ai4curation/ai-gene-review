Countless millions of people have died from tuberculosis, a chronic infectious 
disease caused by the tubercle bacillus. The complete genome sequence of the 
best-characterized strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, H37Rv, has been 
determined and analysed in order to improve our understanding of the biology of 
this slow-growing pathogen and to help the conception of new prophylactic and 
therapeutic interventions. The genome comprises 4,411,529 base pairs, contains 
around 4,000 genes, and has a very high guanine + cytosine content that is 
reflected in the biased amino-acid content of the proteins. M. tuberculosis 
differs radically from other bacteria in that a very large portion of its coding 
capacity is devoted to the production of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and 
lipolysis, and to two new families of glycine-rich proteins with a repetitive 
structure that may represent a source of antigenic variation.
