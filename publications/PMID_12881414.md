Pma1-D378N is a misfolded plasma membrane protein in yeast that is prevented 
from delivery to the cell surface and targeted instead for ER-associated 
degradation (ERAD). Degradation of Pma1-D378N is dependent on the ubiquitin 
ligase Doa10 and the ubiquitin chaperone Cdc48. Recognition of Pma1-D378N by the 
ERAD pathway is dependent on Eps1, a transmembrane member of the protein 
disulfide isomerase (PDI) oxidoreductase family. Eps1 has two thioredoxin-like 
domains containing a CPHC and a CDKC active site. Although Eps1 interaction with 
wild-type Pma1 was not detected, Eps1 co-immunoprecipitates with Pma1-D378N. 
Eps1 interaction with Pma1-D378N requires the CPHC motif, although both 
thioredoxin-like domains appear to cooperate in substrate recognition. In the 
absence of the native transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of Eps1, 
degradation of Pma1-D378N is slowed, suggesting that Eps1 facilitates 
presentation of substrate to membrane-bound components of the degradation 
machinery. Genetic interactions with other mutants of the ERAD machinery and 
induction of the unfolded protein response in eps1Delta cells support a general 
role for Eps1 as a recognition component of the ERAD pathway.
