Primary cilia function as a sensory signaling compartment in processes ranging 
from mammalian Hedgehog signaling to neuronal control of obesity. Intraflagellar 
transport (IFT) is an ancient, conserved mechanism required to assemble cilia 
and for trafficking within cilia. The link between IFT, sensory signaling, and 
obesity is not clearly defined, but some novel monogenic obesity disorders may 
be linked to ciliary defects. The tubby mouse, which presents with adult-onset 
obesity, arises from mutation in the Tub gene. The tubby-like proteins comprise 
a related family of poorly understood proteins with roles in neural development 
and function. We find that specific Tubby family proteins, notably Tubby-like 
protein 3 (TULP3), bind to the IFT-A complex. IFT-A is linked to retrograde 
ciliary transport, but, surprisingly, we find that the IFT-A complex has a 
second role directing ciliary entry of TULP3. TULP3 and IFT-A, in turn, promote 
trafficking of a subset of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), but not 
Smoothened, to cilia. Both IFT-A and membrane phosphoinositide-binding 
properties of TULP3 are required for ciliary GPCR localization. TULP3 and IFT-A 
proteins both negatively regulate Hedgehog signaling in the mouse embryo, and 
the TULP3-IFT-A interaction suggests how these proteins cooperate during neural 
tube patterning.
