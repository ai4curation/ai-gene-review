The Chaperonin Containing Tcp1 (CCT) maintains cellular protein folding 
homeostasis in the eukaryotic cytosol by assisting the biogenesis of many 
proteins, including actins, tubulins, and regulators of the cell cycle. Here, we 
demonstrate that the essential and conserved eukaryotic phosducin-like protein 2 
(PhLP2/PLP2) physically interacts with CCT and modulates its folding activity. 
Consistent with this functional interaction, temperature-sensitive alleles of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae PLP2 exhibit cytoskeletal and cell cycle defects. We 
uncovered several high-copy suppressors of the plp2 alleles, all of which are 
associated with G1/S cell cycle progression but which do not appreciably affect 
cytoskeletal protein function or fully rescue the growth defects. Our data 
support a model in which Plp2p modulates the biogenesis of several CCT 
substrates relating to cell cycle and cytoskeletal function, which together 
contribute to the essential function of PLP2.
