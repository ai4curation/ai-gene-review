The cellular localization of human cytokeratin 1 (CK1), urokinase plasminogen 
activator receptor (uPAR), and gC1qR, high-molecular-weight kininogen 
(HK)-binding proteins on endothelial cells, was determined. CK1 was found on the 
external membrane of nonpermeabilized endothelial cells by immunoperoxidase 
staining, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy using 
immunogold. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) had 7.2 +/- 0.2 x 
10(4) specific CK1 membrane sites/cell by (125)I-F(ab')(2) anti-CK1 antibody 
binding. Flow cytometry studies confirmed the presence of CK1, uPAR, and gC1qR 
on HUVECs. On laser scanning confocal microscopy and transmission electron 
microscopy, CK1 and uPAR, but not gC1qR, colocalized on the cell surface of 
HUVECs. The HUVEC surface distribution of these proteins was distinctly 
different from that for von Willebrand factor. In competitive inhibition 
experiments, anti-CK1, anti-uPAR, or anti-gC1qR blocked both biotin-HK binding 
and prekallikrein (PK) activation on HUVECs with an inhibitory concentration of 
50% (IC(50)) of 300 to 350 nM, 50 to 60 nM, or 35 to 100 nM, respectively. Also, 
antibodies to uPAR and gC1qR each inhibited 86% of kallikrein-mediated, 2-chain 
urokinase plasminogen activation, whereas antibodies to CK1 only inhibited 24% 
of plasminogen activation. On HUVECs, CK1 and uPAR, but not gC1qR, colocalized 
to be a multiprotein receptor complex for HK binding, PK activation, and 2-chain 
urokinase plasminogen activation.
