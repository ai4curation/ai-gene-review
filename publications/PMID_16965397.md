The human chromosome region 11p15.5 contains a number of maternally and 
paternally imprinted genes, and the LIT1/KCNQ1OT1 locus acts as an imprinting 
center in the proximal domain of 11p15.5. Loss of imprinting (LOI) of LIT1 and 
its correlation with methylation status at a differentially methylated region, 
the KvDMR1, were investigated in 69 colorectal cancer tissue specimens. LIT1 
expression profiles were also examined by RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization 
in 13 colorectal cancer cell lines. In 69 colorectal cancer tissue specimens, 
LOI of LIT1 was observed in nine of the 17 (53%) informative cases. Moreover, 
LOI of LIT1 was only observed in tumor samples. In the cell lines, methylation 
status at the KvDMR1 correlated well with LIT1 expression profiles. Loss of 
expression of LIT1 also correlated with enrichment of H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9) 
dimethylation and reduction of H3 lysine 4 (H3-K4) dimethylation. Thus, LIT1 
expression appears to be controlled by epigenetic modifications at the KvDMR1, 
although CDKN1C expression, which is considered to be controlled by LIT1, was 
not associated with epigenetic status at the KvDMR1 in some colorectal cancer 
cell lines. Therefore, these findings suggest that LOI of LIT1 via epigenetic 
disruption plays an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis, but it is not 
necessarily associated with CDKN1C expression.

Abstract

The human chromosome region 11p15.5 contains a number of maternally and paternally imprinted genes, and the LIT1/KCNQ1OT1 locus acts as an imprinting center in the proximal domain of 11p15.5. Loss of imprinting (LOI) of LIT1 and its correlation with methylation status at a differentially methylated region, the KvDMR1, were investigated in 69 colorectal cancer tissue specimens. LIT1 expression profiles were also examined by RNA‐fluorescence in situ hybridization in 13 colorectal cancer cell lines. In 69 colorectal cancer tissue specimens, LOI of LIT1 was observed in nine of the 17 (53%) informative cases. Moreover, LOI of LIT1 was only observed in tumor samples. In the cell lines, methylation status at the KvDMR1 correlated well with LIT1 expression profiles. Loss of expression of LIT1 also correlated with enrichment of H3 lysine 9 (H3‐K9) dimethylation and reduction of H3 lysine 4 (H3‐K4) dimethylation. Thus, LIT1 expression appears to be controlled by epigenetic modifications at the KvDMR1, although CDKN1C expression, which is considered to be controlled by LIT1 , was not associated with epigenetic status at the KvDMR1 in some colorectal cancer cell lines. Therefore, these findings suggest that LOI of LIT1 via epigenetic disruption plays an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis, but it is not necessarily associated with CDKN1C expression.

Materials and Methods

Tissue samples and cell lines. Tumor samples and corresponding adjacent normal tissue specimens were surgically resected from 69 colorectal cancer patients with approval (#329) of the Institution Review Board at the Faculty of Medicine of Tottori University (Tottori, Japan). Tumor lesions and their adjacent non‐tumoral tissue regions were removed and stored at −80°C until analysis. A part of each removed specimen was fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. The sections were stained with hematoxylin–eosin and were examined histopathologically by light microscopy. Thirteen colorectal cancer cell lines were used for the present study. Of these, 10 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; DLD‐1, HCT‐15, CoLo320, SW480, CoLo205, Widr‐TC, Caco‐2, T84, LoVo, WiDr), two were grown in RPMI‐1640 with 10% FBS (CoLo201, TCO), and one was grown in Leibovitz L‐15 medium with 10% FBS (SW837). Genomic DNA and total RNA from these samples and cell lines were extracted using the Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturers’ instructions.

Results

Loss of imprinting at LIT1 , IGF2 and H19 in colorectal cancer tissues. The cluster of imprinted genes on human chromosome 11p15.5 consists of two domains: IGF2‐H19 and LIT1‐CDKN1C ( Fig. 1 ). ( 27 ) We examined the status of genomic imprinting of the LIT1 , IGF2 and H19 genes in 69 independent colorectal cancers by PCR‐restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis ( Fig. 2a–c ). The allelic expression of the genes in informative, heterozygous cases is shown in Table 1 (17, 20 and 21 cases for LIT1 , IGF2 and H19 , respectively). LIT1 LOI was observed in nine of the 17 (53%) informative cases, and its LOI was observed in tumor tissues but not in adjacent histologically normal tissues. IGF2 LOI was observed in 11 of the 20 (55%) informative cases, and all the cases showed LOI in the adjacent normal tissues. In one case, LOI was observed in the normal tissue, but not in the cancer tissue. These data were similar to those in our previous study . ( 20 ) There were only two informative cases for both LIT1 and IGF2 (cases 41 and 49). One (case 41) showed LOI for both genes and the other (case 49) showed LOI only for LIT1 ( Table 2 ). We divided colorectal cancer tissues into three differentiation types: poorly differentiated, moderately differentiated and well differentiated ( Table 2 ). Of the nine cases with LIT1 LOI, moderately differentiated and well differentiated were three (cases 14, 45 and 64) and six (cases 8, 34, 38, 40, 41 and 49) of these cases, respectively. Of the 11 IGF2 LOI cases, moderately differentiated and well differentiated were six (cases 19, 28, 44, 46, 61 and 67) and four (cases 2, 6, 26 and 41) of these cases. One (case 65) was not tested. Neither LIT1 LOI nor IGF2 LOI were observed in the few cases that fell into the poor differentiation category. There was no significant difference between the frequencies of IGF2 LOI and LIT1 LOI in tumor differentiation types. No other clinicopathological differences were observed; the estimated percentage of tumor cells (∼25–50%) in tumor samples, the numbers of stroma or fibroblasts and infiltrating lymphocytes. Thus, clinicopathological significance and the correlation of IGF2 and LIT1 LOI in colorectal carcinogenesis were still unknown. In contrast to IGF2 and LIT1 , we observed LOI at H19 in only two of the 21 (9.5%) cases, and two cases (cases 8 and 60) showed LOI in cancer tissues. In one case (case 9), LOI was observed in the normal tissue, but not in the cancerous tissue.

Discussion

The cluster of imprinted genes on human chromosome 11p15.5 consists of two domains: IGF2‐H19 and LIT1‐CDKN1C . ( 27 ) LOI of IGF2 has been observed in 10% of the lymphocytes from normal individuals. ( 28 ) In addition, IGF2 LOI is a significant risk factor for human colorectal carcinogenesis and is thought to promote tumorigenesis by inhibiting apoptosis. ( 29 ) Igf2 LOI with Apc +/Min mice showed a shift toward less differentiation and an increase in tumor initiation. ( 30 ) The present findings showed that IGF2 and LIT1 LOI were observed at a high frequency in colorectal cancer. A concurrent and high frequency of IGF2 LOI was observed in tumor and adjacent normal tissues, indicating that IGF2 LOI occur at an early stage in cancer development. This idea is consist with a previous report. ( 30 ) However, LIT1 LOI was observed only in tumor tissues, suggesting that LIT1 LOI takes advantage of cancer progression to activate or inactivate a target sequence. This idea supports a recent study showing global LOI in Dnmt1 conditional knockout cells. ( 31 ) The study concluded that imprinted loci other than H19 ICR and Igf2r are primarily responsible for the altered growth characteristics and transformed phenotype of cells with LOI, although H19 ICR has been shown to be highly susceptible to de novo methylation during cancer progression. ( 31 ) Thus, the KvDMR1 may be primarily responsible for the altered growth characteristics and transformed phenotype of cells with LOI, and our data suggest that LIT1 LOI and LOM at the KvDMR1 may therefore be associated with colorectal cancer tumorigenesis in a manner that differs from what has been proposed for IGF2 LOI.

KvDMR1 is thought to be an imprinting center at the LIT1‐CDKN1C domain and has been shown to have a bidirectional ‘silencer’ or ‘insulator’ activity. ( 14 , 15 , 16 ) A number of studies have shown that LOM of the KvDMR1 is associated with LIT1 LOI in BWS patients. ( 17 , 18 ) Another report showed that LOM at KvDMR1 was observed in adult tumors. ( 21 ) Our results in colorectal cancer cell lines suggest that LIT1 expression is controlled by epigenetic status at the KvDMR1. A ChIP assay showed that H3‐Ac and H3‐K4 dimethylation increased and H3‐K9 dimethylation decreased, consistent with the LIT1 expression profile in three cell lines. In particular, H3‐K9 dimethylation was heavily decreased in CoLo205, suggesting that H3‐K9 dimethylation was correlated strongly with LIT1 expression. However, H4‐Ac of Widr‐TC with LIT1 LOI was increased a little more than in the other two cell lines, suggesting that H4‐Ac is less responsible for LIT1 expression status than other histone modifications. Thus, histone modifications, as well as DNA methylation, are important for the regulation of LIT1 expression to form active or repressive chromatin structure, similar to esophageal cancer cell lines. ( 24 ) The KvDMR1 is also thought to be a LIT1 promoter. LIT1 is a non‐coding RNA, like Xist , Tsix and Air . The Xist gene has been well characterized. Xist RNA transcribed from X inactivation center coats the X‐chromosome to inactivate gene expression, which is followed by sequential epigenetic modification. ( 32 , 33 ) Study of the truncated Air gene showed deregulation of gene expression in the proximal region. ( 34 ) Previous study of an episome‐based vector system has pointed to the possibility that the production of LIT1 RNA plays a critical role in the bidirectional spreading of inactive chromatin structures. ( 35 ) A recent study in vivo showed that premature termination of the LIT1 transcript leads to LOI in the proximal region. This indicates that elongation of the LIT1 transcript is needed for genomic imprinting in neighboring genes. ( 36 ) Moreover, an in vitro study showed that repressive chromatin‐specific histone modifications depend on the length of LIT1 transcript. ( 37 )

There are at least three silencing mechanisms for CDKN1C : (1) DNA hypermethylation at its own promoter region; ( 38 ) (2) repressive chromatin structure (histone modifications) at its own promoter; ( 23 ) and (3) changes in epigenetic status at the KvDMR1. ( 24 ) Soejima et al . reported that CDKN1C expression was associated with methylation status at the KvDMR1 in 14 of 17 esophageal cancer cell lines but, surprisingly, there was no association in the other three cell lines. ( 24 ) In contrast, we found that LOM at the KvDMR1 is not necessarily associated with CDKN1C expression in the present study. Other than epigenetic status at the KvDMR1, the repressive chromatin structure mechanism provides a way to explain our observation that CDKN1C expression was low. However, the results observed for some cells lines (such as Caco‐2 and SW837 of the colorectal cancer lines and the #14 esophageal cancer line) in which hypomethylation at the KvDMR1 and high levels of expression of CDKN1C were observed may not be explained with the three proposed regulation mechanisms. Taken together, the results from colorectal and esophageal cancer cell lines suggest that there may be another regulation mechanism of CDKN1C expression yet to be defined. Disruption of this hypothetical regulation mechanism caused by chromosome rearrangement, which disrupts regulatory domains including KvDMR1, could explain the aberrant expression of CDKN1C .
