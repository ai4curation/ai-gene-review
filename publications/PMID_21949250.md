Depending on the cellular context, BCL2-like proteins promote mitochondrial 
fusion or fission. What determines which of these two opposing processes they 
promote has so far been unknown. Furthermore, the mechanisms through which 
BCL2-like proteins affect mitochondrial dynamics remain to be fully understood. 
The BCL2-like protein CED-9 of Caenorhabditis elegans has previously been shown 
to promote mitochondrial fusion by physically interacting with the mitochondrial 
fusion protein FZO-1. Here, we report that CED-9 also physically interacts with 
the mitochondrial fission protein DRP-1 and that this interaction can be 
enhanced when CED-9 is associated with the BH3-only protein EGL-1. In addition, 
we show that the EGL-1-CED-9 complex promotes mitochondrial fission by 
recruiting DRP-1 to mitochondria and that the egl-1 gene is required for 
CED-9-dependent mitochondrial fission in vivo. Based on these results, we 
propose that EGL-1 converts CED-9 into a mitochondrial receptor for DRP-1, 
thereby shifting its activity from profusion to profission. We hypothesize that 
BCL2-like proteins act as mitochondrial receptors for DRP-1-like proteins in 
higher organisms as well and that BH3-only proteins play a general role as 
modifiers of the function in mitochondrial dynamics of BCL2-like proteins. We 
speculate that this function of BCL2-like proteins may be as couplers of 
mitochondrial fusion and fission.
