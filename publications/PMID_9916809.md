Keutel syndrome (KS, MIM 245150) is an autosomal recessive disorder 
characterized by abnormal cartilage calcification, peripheral pulmonary stenosis 
and midfacial hypoplasia. A genome search using homozygosity mapping provided 
evidence of linkage to chromosome 12p12.3-13.1 (maximum multipoint lod score, 
4.06). MGP was a candidate on the basis of its localization to this chromosomal 
region and the known function of its protein. MGP maps to chromosome 12p near 
D12S363. Human MGP is a 10-kD skeletal extracellular matrix (ECM) protein that 
consists of an 84-aa mature protein and a 19-aa transmembrane signal peptide. It 
is a member of the Gla protein family, which includes osteocalcin, another 
skeletal ECM protein, and a number of coagulation factors (factors II, VII, IX, 
X and proteins S and C). All members of this family have glutamic acid residues 
modified to gamma-carboxyglutamic acids (Gla) by a specific gamma-carboxylase 
using vitamin K as a cofactor. The modified glutamic acid residues of Gla 
proteins confer a high affinity for mineral ions such as calcium, phosphate and 
hydroxyapatite crystals, the mineral components of the skeletal ECM. The pattern 
and tissue distribution of Mgp expression in mice suggest a role for Mgp in 
regulating ECM calcification. Mglap-deficient mice (Mglap-/-) have been reported 
to have inappropriate calcification of cartilage. Mutational analysis of MGP in 
three unrelated probands identified three different mutations: c.69delG, 
IVS1-2A-->G and c.113T-->A. All three mutations predict a non-functional MGP. 
Our data indicate that mutations in MGP are responsible for KS and confirm its 
role in the regulation of extracellular matrix calcification.
