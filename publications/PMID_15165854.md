Collagen XVI is a minor component of at least two different extracellular 
fibrillar networks of specialized regions of skin and cartilage. In skin, 
collagen XVI is integrated into particular fibrillin-rich microfibrils lacking 
an amorphous elastin core. In cartilage, collagen XVI is a component of small 
heterotypic D-banded fibrils, mainly occurring in the territorial matrix of 
chondrocytes. Here, we present the first direct evidence for the molecular 
structure and functional properties of these fibril-associated collagens with 
interrupted triple helices (FACIT). We have expressed recombinantly the 
full-length alpha1 chain of human collagen XVI in HEK 293 EBNA cells in large 
quantities using an episomal expression system. Secreted full-length recombinant 
collagen XVI forms stable disulfide-bonded homotrimers and is rapidly 
proteolytically processed to distinct fragments at specific protease sequence 
motifs, one resembling an aggrecanase recognition site. Limited trypsin 
digestion assays and thermal transition curves imply sequential thermal 
denaturation of individual triple helical domains of this recombinant collagen, 
similar to authentic collagen XVI. Molecular images of collagen XVI reveal 
rod-like molecules which harbor multiple sharp kinks attributing a highly 
flexible structure presumably introduced by non-collagenous (NC) regions. 
Terminally located cloverleaf-shaped nodules correspond to the large NC NC11 
domain of trimeric collagen XVI. The total length of individual trimeric 
recombinant collagen XVI molecules constitutes about 240 nm as calculated by 
atomic force and negative staining electron microscopy. Recombinant collagen XVI 
interacts with fibrillin-1 and with fibronectin indicating multiple molecular 
interactions in which this ubiquitously expressed and versatile FACIT-collagen 
can participate. In vitro generated collagen XVI provides an indispensable tool 
for future determination of its function during supramolecular assembly of 
matrix aggregates and its role in maintenance, organization and interaction of 
fibrillar structures.
