Nucleophosmin (NPM) is a ubiquitously expressed nucleolar phosphoprotein that 
continuously shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. It has been proposed to 
function in ribosomal protein assembly and transport, and also as a molecular 
chaperone that prevents proteins from aggregating in the crowded environment of 
the nucleolus. The NPM gene is involved in several tumour-associated chromosome 
translocations, which have resulted in the formation of fusion proteins that 
retain the amino terminus of NPM, including NPM ALK, NPM RAR and NPM MLF1 (ref. 
6). It is generally thought that the NPM component is not involved in the 
transforming potential of these fusion proteins, but instead provides a 
dimerization interface for the oligomerization and the oncogenic conversion of 
the various NPM partners (ALK, RAR, MLF1). Here we show that NPM interacts 
directly with the tumour suppressor p53, regulates the increase in stability and 
transcriptional activation of p53 after different types of stress, and induces 
p53-dependent premature senescence on overexpression in diploid fibroblasts. 
These findings indicate that NPM is a crucial regulator of p53 and suggest that 
alterations of the NPM function by NPM fusion proteins might lead to 
deregulation of p53 in tumours.
