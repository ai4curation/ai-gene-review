The non-protein amino acid beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA) primes Arabidopsis to 
respond more quickly and strongly to pathogen and osmotic stress. Here, we 
report that BABA also significantly enhances acquired thermotolerance in 
Arabidopsis. This thermotolerance was dependent on heat shock protein 101, a 
critical component of the normal heat-shock response. BABA did not enhance basal 
thermotolerance under a severe heat-shock treatment. No roles for the hormones 
ethylene and salicylic acid in BABA-induced acquired thermotolerance were 
identified by mutant analysis. Using global gene expression analysis, transcript 
levels for several transcription factors and DNA binding proteins regulating 
responses to the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA) were found to be elevated in 
BABA-treated plants compared with water-treated plants. The role of ABA in 
BABA-induced thermotolerance was complex. BABA-enhanced thermotolerance was 
partially compromised in the ABA-insensitive mutant, abi1-1, but was augmented 
in abi2-1. In an unrelated process, BABA, like ABA, inhibited root growth, and 
the level of inhibition was roughly additive in roots treated with both 
compounds. Root growth of both abi1-1 and abi2-1 was also inhibited by BABA. 
Unexpectedly, abi1-1 and abi2-1 root growth was inhibited more strongly by 
combined ABA and BABA treatments than by BABA alone. Our results, together with 
previously published data, suggest that BABA is a general enhancer of plant 
stress resistance, and that cross-talk occurs between BABA and ABA signalling 
cascades. Specifically, the BABA-mediated accumulation of ABA transcription 
factors without concomitant activation of a downstream ABA response could 
represent one component of the BABA-primed state in Arabidopsis.
