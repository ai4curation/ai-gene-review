Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain and PDGF receptor beta (PDGFR 
beta) are essential for glomerulogenesis. Mice deficient in PDGF B-chain or 
PDGFR beta exhibit an abnormal glomerular phenotype characterized by total lack 
of mesangial cells. In this study, we localized PDGFR beta in the developing rat 
kidney and explored the biological effects of PDGF in metanephric mesenchymal 
cells in an attempt to determine the mechanism by which PDGF regulates mesangial 
cell development. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies of rat 
embryonic kidneys reveal that PDGFR beta localizes to undifferentiated 
metanephric mesenchyme and is later expressed in the cleft of the comma-shaped 
and S-shaped bodies and in more mature glomeruli in a mesangial distribution. We 
also isolated and characterized cells from rat metanephric mesenchyme. 
Metanephric mesenchymal cells express vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin but 
not cytokeratin. These cells also express functional PDGFR beta, as demonstrated 
by autophosphorylation of the receptor as well as activation of 
phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase in response to PDGF B-chain homodimer. PDGF 
B-chain also induces migration and proliferation of metanephric mesenchymal 
cells. Taken together with the fact that PDGF B-chain is expressed in the 
glomerular epithelium and mesangial area, as demonstrated in the human embryonic 
kidney, we suggest that PDGF B-chain acts in a paracrine fashion to stimulate 
the migration and proliferation of mesangial cell precursors from 
undifferentiated metanephric mesenchyme to the mesangial area. PDGF B-chain also 
likely stimulates proliferation of mesangial cell precursors in an autocrine 
fashion once these cells migrate to the glomerular tuft.
