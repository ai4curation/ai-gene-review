Homozygosity mapping was performed in five patients from a consanguineous family 
who presented with infantile mitochondrial encephalomyopathy attributed to 
isolated NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) deficiency. This resulted in 
the identification of a missense mutation in a conserved residue of the C6ORF66 
gene, which encodes a 20.2 kDa mitochondrial protein. The mutation was also 
detected in a patient who presented with antenatal cardiomyopathy. In muscle of 
two patients, the levels of the C6ORF66 protein and of the fully assembled 
complex I were markedly reduced. Transfection of the patients' fibroblasts with 
wild-type C6ORF66 cDNA restored complex I activity. These data suggest that 
C6ORF66 is an assembly factor of complex I. Interestingly, the C6ORF66 gene 
product was previously shown to promote breast cancer cell invasiveness.
