Plants constantly monitor their light environment in order to grow and develop 
optimally, in part through use of the phytochromes, which sense red/far-red 
light. A phytochrome binding protein, PKS1 (phytochrome kinase substrate 1), was 
identified that is a substrate for light-regulated phytochrome kinase activity 
in vitro. In vivo experiments suggest that PKS1 is phosphorylated in a 
phytochrome-dependent manner and negatively regulates phytochrome signaling. The 
data suggest that phytochromes signal by serine-threonine phosphorylation.
