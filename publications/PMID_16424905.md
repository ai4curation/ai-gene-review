The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is critical for specific degradation of 
cellular proteins and plays a pivotal role on protein breakdown in muscle 
atrophy. Here, we show that ZNF216 directly binds polyubiquitin chains through 
its N-terminal A20-type zinc-finger domain and associates with the 26S 
proteasome. ZNF216 was colocalized with the aggresome, which contains 
ubiquitinylated proteins and other UPS components. Expression of Znf216 was 
increased in both denervation- and fasting-induced muscle atrophy and 
upregulated by expression of constitutively active FOXO, a master regulator of 
muscle atrophy. Mice deficient in Znf216 exhibited resistance to 
denervation-induced atrophy, and ubiquitinylated proteins markedly accumulated 
in neurectomized muscle compared to wild-type mice. These data suggest that 
ZNF216 functions in protein degradation via the UPS and plays a crucial role in 
muscle atrophy.
