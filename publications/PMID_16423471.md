Cellular migration and invasion are critical for important biological processes 
including cancer metastasis. We previously reported that uteroglobin (UG), a 
multifunctional secreted protein, binds to several cell types inhibiting 
migration and invasion [G.C. Kundu, A.K. Z. Zhang Mandal, G. Mantile-Selvaggi, 
A.B. Mukherjee (1998) Uteroglobin (UG) suppresses extracellular matrix invasion 
by normal and cancer cells that express the high affinity UG-binding proteins. J 
Biol Chem. 273: 22819-22824]. More recently, we reported that HTB-81 
adenocarcinoma cells, which do not bind UG, are refractory to UG-mediated 
inhibition of migration and invasion [Z. Zhang, G.C. Kundu, D. Panda, A.K. 
Mandal et al. (1999) Loss of transformed phenotype in cancer cells by 
overexpression of the uteroglobin gene. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 96, 
3963-3968]. Since UG shares several biological properties with lipocalin-1 that 
mediates some of its biological effects via its receptor (Lip-1R), we sought to 
determine whether UG might interact with Lip-1R and inhibit migration and 
invasion of HTB-81 cells. To address this question, we first transfected COS-1 
cells, which do not bind UG, with a Lip-1R-cDNA construct and performed binding 
assays using 125I-human UG (hUG). The results show that hUG binds Lip-1R on 
these cells with high specificity. Further, transfection of HTB-81 cells with 
the same construct yielded 125I-hUG binding with high affinity (Kd=18 nM) and 
specificity. The hUG-Lip-1R interaction was further confirmed by transfecting 
HTB-81, HTB-30 and HTB-174 cells, which are refractory to UG-binding, with a 
green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Lip-1R-cDNA construct and testing for Lip-1R-hUG 
colocalization by fluorescence microscopy. Finally, we demonstrate that 
Lip-1R-hUG interaction on Lip-1R transfected HTB-81 cells renders them fully 
responsive to hUG-mediated inhibition of migration and invasion. Taken together, 
these results suggest that Lip-1R is at least one of the UG-binding proteins 
through which UG exerts anti-motility and anti-invasive effects.
