p105CasL (CasL) is a recently identified signaling molecule closely related to 
the p130Cas (Crk-associated substrate) docking protein. CasL has a single Src 
homology (SH) 3 domain in its N-terminal portion followed by multiple consensus 
motifs for binding to SH2 domains. Like original p130Cas, CasL undergoes 
tyrosine phosphorylation upon integrin-mediated cell adhesion. In the present 
report, we provide direct evidence that CasL is also involved in T cell antigen 
receptor (TcR)-mediated signal transduction. In binding studies in vitro using 
glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins, we have identified 105- and 120-kDa 
phosphotyrosyl proteins (pp105 and pp120, respectively) tightly bound to the SH2 
domain of the Crk adapter protein in the H9 human T cell line after stimulation 
through the CD3/TcR complex. pp120, but not pp105, also bound to the SH3 of 
another adapter protein, Ash/Grb2. Immunoblotting with specific antibodies 
revealed that pp120 and pp105 were identical to the c-cbl proto-oncogene product 
(p120cbl) and CasL, respectively. Association between Crk and 
tyrosine-phosphorylated CasL after TcR stimulation was also confirmed in vivo. 
CasL phosphorylation induced by TcR ligation reached maximal levels within 2 min 
and rapidly declined thereafter, whereas the integrin-dependent response 
occurred slowly and was more prolonged. Finally, we demonstrated that Crk/CasL 
association occurred in peripheral blood T lymphocytes in response to TcR 
engagement. Our findings suggest that CasL is involved in T cell activation 
signals and resides at a point where two distinct receptor-mediated signaling 
pathways converge. This provides one mechanism by which integrins may mediate T 
cell co-stimulation.
