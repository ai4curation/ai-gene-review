P22(phox) is a ubiquitous protein encoded by the CYBA gene located on the long 
arm of chromosome 16 at position 24, containing six exons and spanning 8.5 kb. 
P22(phox) is a critical component of the superoxide-generating nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (NOXs). It is associated with 
NOX2 to form cytochrome b558 expressed mainly in phagocytes and responsible for 
the killing of microorganisms when bacterial and fungal infections occur. CYBA 
mutations lead to one of the autosomal recessive forms of chronic granulomatous 
disease (AR22(0)CGD) clinically characterized by recurrent and severe infections 
in early childhood. However, p22(phox) is also the partner of NOX1, NOX3 and 
NOX4, but not NOX5, which are analogs of NOX2, the first identified member of 
the NOX family. P22(phox)-NOX complexes have emerged as one of the most relevant 
sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tissues and cells, and are 
associated with several diseases such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
diseases. The p22(phox)-deficient mouse strain nmf333 has made it possible to 
highlight the role of p22(phox) in the control of inner ear balance in 
association with NOX3. However, the relevance of p22(phox) for NOX3 function 
remains uncertain because AR22(0)CGD patients do not suffer from vestibular 
dysfunction. Finally, a large number of genetic variations of CYBA have been 
reported, among them the C242T polymorphism, which has been extensively studied 
in association with coronary artery and heart diseases, but conflicting results 
continue to be reported.
