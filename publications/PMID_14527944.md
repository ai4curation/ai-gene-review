Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive neuro-degenerative disorder 
associated with juvenile onset non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus and progressive 
optic atrophy. The disease has been attributed to mutations in the WFS1 gene, 
which codes for a protein predicted to possess 9-10 transmembrane segments. 
Little is known concerning the function of the WFS1 protein (wolframin). 
Endoglycosidase H digestion, immunocytochemistry, and subcellular fractionation 
studies all indicated that wolframin is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum 
in rat brain hippocampus and rat pancreatic islet beta-cells, and after ectopic 
expression in Xenopus oocytes. Reconstitution of wolframin from oocyte membranes 
into planar lipid bilayers demonstrated that the protein induced a large 
cation-selective ion channel that was blocked by Mg2+ or Ca2+. Inositol 
triphosphate was capable of activating channels in the fused bilayers that were 
similar to channel components induced by wolframin expression. Expression of 
wolframin also increased cytosolic calcium levels in oocytes. Wolframin thus 
appears to be important in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. 
Disruption of this function may place cells at risk to suffer inappropriate 
death decisions, thus accounting for the progressive beta-cell loss and neuronal 
degeneration associated with the disease.
