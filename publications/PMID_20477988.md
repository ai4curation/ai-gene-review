The leguminous-type (L-type) lectin VIP36 localizes to the Golgi apparatus and 
cycles early in the secretory pathway. In vitro, VIP36 binds high-mannose 
glycans with a pH optimum of 6.5, a value similar to the luminal pH of the Golgi 
apparatus. Although the sugar-binding properties of VIP36 in vitro have been 
characterized in detail, the function of VIP36 in the intact cell remains 
unclear as no convincing glycoprotein cargo has been identified. Here, we used 
yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fragment complementation to identify luminal 
interaction partners of VIP36. By screening a human liver cDNA library, we 
identified the glycoprotein alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1-AT) as a cargo of VIP36. 
The VIP36/alpha1-AT complex localized to Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 
In the living cell, VIP36 bound exclusively to the high-mannose form of 
alpha1-AT. The binding was increased when complex glycosylation was prevented by 
kifunensine and abolished when the glycosylation sites of alpha1-AT were 
inactivated by mutagenesis. Silencing VIP36 accelerated alpha1-AT transport, 
arguing against a role of VIP36 in anterograde traffic. The complex formed by 
VIP36 and alpha1-AT in the Golgi recycled back to the ER. The combined data are 
most consistent with a function of VIP36 in post-ER quality control of 
alpha1-AT.
