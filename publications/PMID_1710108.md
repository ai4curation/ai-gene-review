Vitronectin (complement S-protein), a plasma and tissue glycoprotein of 75 kDa, 
shares the amino-terminal somatomedin B domain with the membrane glycoprotein 
PC1 of plasma cells and several hemopexin-type repeats with hemopexin and the 
non-catalytic carboxy-terminal domain of collagenases. It serves as a ligand for 
certain integrin receptors, binds to distinct members of the serpin family and 
inhibits the pore-forming cytolytic reaction of the terminal complement pathway. 
Computer-assisted data base searches revealed the presence of a single 
somatomedin B domain in the recently cloned placental protein 11, and four 
hemopexin-type repeats in the cytosolic plant protein PA2, the major albumin of 
pea seeds, whose function is unknown. Our finding shows that hemopexin-type 
repeats are present in extracellular as well as in cytosolic proteins and most 
likely originated before the divergence of the animal and plant kindoms.
