Loss of actin stress fibers has been associated with cell transformation and 
metastasis. TGF-beta induction of stress fibers in epithelial cells requires 
high molecular weight tropomyosins encoded by TPM1 and TPM2 genes. Here, we 
investigated the mechanism underlying the failure of TGF-beta to induce stress 
fibers and inhibit cell migration in metastatic cells. RT-PCR analysis in 
carcinoma cell lines revealed a significant reduction in TPM1 transcripts in 
metastatic MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and SW620 cell lines. Treatment of these cells 
with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) increased mRNA levels 
of TPM1 with no effect on TPM2. Importantly, 5-aza-dC treatment of MDA-MB-231 
cells restored TGF-beta induction of TPM1 and formation of stress fibers. Forced 
expression of TPM1 by using Tet-Off system increased stress fibers in MDA-MB-231 
cells and reduced cell migration. A potential CpG island spanning the TPM1 
proximal promoter, exon 1, and the beginning of intron 1 was identified. 
Bisulfite sequencing showed significant cytosine methylation in metastatic cell 
lines that correlated with a reduced expression of TPM1. Together these results 
suggest that epigenetic suppression of TPM1 may alter TGF-beta tumor suppressor 
function and contribute to metastatic properties of tumor cells.
