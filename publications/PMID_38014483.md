BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are neurologic disorders 
characterized by progressive lower-extremity spasticity. Despite the 
identification of several HSP-related genes, many patients lack a genetic 
diagnosis.
OBJECTIVES: The aims were to confirm the pathogenic role of biallelic COQ4 
mutations in HSP and elucidate the clinical, genetic, and functional molecular 
features of COQ4-associated HSP.
METHODS: Whole exome sequences of 310 index patients with HSP of unknown cause 
from three distinct populations were analyzed to identify potential HSP causal 
genes. Clinical data obtained from patients harboring candidate causal mutations 
were examined. Functional characterization of COQ4 variants was performed using 
bioinformatic tools, single-cell RNA sequencing, biochemical assays in cell 
lines, primary fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived pyramidal 
neurons, and zebrafish.
RESULTS: Compound heterozygous variants in COQ4, which cosegregated with HSP in 
pedigrees, were identified in 7 patients from six unrelated families. Patients 
from four of the six families presented with pure HSP, whereas probands of the 
other two families exhibited complicated HSP with epilepsy or with cerebellar 
ataxia. In patient-derived fibroblasts and COQ4 knockout complementation lines, 
stable expression of these missense variants exerted loss-of-function effects, 
including mitochondrial reactive oxygen species accumulation, decreased 
mitochondrial membrane potential, and lower ubiquinone biosynthesis. Whereas 
differentiated pyramidal neurons expressed high COQ4 levels, coq4 knockdown 
zebrafish displayed severe motor dysfunction, reflecting motor neuron 
dysregulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that loss-of-function, compound heterozygous, 
pathogenic COQ4 variants are causal for autosomal recessive pure and complicated 
HSP. Moreover, reduced COQ4 levels attributable to variants correspond with 
decreased ubiquinone biosynthesis, impaired mitochondrial function, and higher 
phenotypic disease severity. © 2023 International Parkinson and Movement
