Continued cell proliferation requires telomerase to maintain functional 
telomeres that are essential for chromosome integrity. Although the core enzyme 
includes a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and a telomerase RNA 
component (TERC), a number of auxiliary proteins have been identified to 
regulate telomerase assembly, localization, and enzymatic activity. Here we 
describe the characterization of the AAA-ATPase NVL2 as a novel 
hTERT-interacting protein. NVL2 interacts and co-localizes with hTERT in the 
nucleolus. NLV2 is also found in association with catalytically competent 
telomerase in cell lysates through an interaction with hTERT. Depletion of 
endogenous NVL2 by small interfering RNA led to a decrease in hTERT without 
affecting the steady-state levels of hTERT mRNA, thereby reducing telomerase 
activity, suggesting that NVL2 is an essential component of the telomerase 
holoenzyme. We also found that ATP-binding activity of NVL2 is required for 
hTERT binding as well as telomerase assembly. Our findings suggest that NVL2, in 
addition to its role in ribosome biosynthesis, is essential for telomerase 
biogenesis and provides an alternative approach for inhibiting telomerase 
activity in cancer.
