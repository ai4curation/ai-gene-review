SIV and HIV Nef proteins disrupt T-cell receptor machinery by down-modulating 
cell surface expression of CD4 and expression or signaling of CD3-TCR. Nef also 
down-modulates class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) surface 
expression. We show that SIV and HIV-1 Nefs down-modulate CD28, a major 
co-stimulatory receptor that mediates effective T-cell activation, by 
accelerating CD28 endocytosis. The effects of Nef on CD28, CD4, CD3 and class I 
MHC expression are all genetically separable, indicating that all are selected 
independently. In cells expressing a Nef-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion, 
CD28 co-localizes with the AP-2 clathrin adaptor and Nef-GFP. Mutations that 
disrupt Nef interaction with AP-2 disrupt CD28 down-regulation. Furthermore, HIV 
and SIV Nefs use overlapping but distinct target sites in the membrane-proximal 
region of the CD28 cytoplasmic domain. Thus, Nef probably induces CD28 
endocytosis via the AP-2 pathway, and this involves a ternary complex containing 
Nef, AP-2 and CD28. The likely consequence of the concerted down-regulation of 
CD28, CD4 and/or CD3 by Nef is disruption of antigen-specific signaling 
machineries in infected T cells following a productive antigen recognition 
event.
