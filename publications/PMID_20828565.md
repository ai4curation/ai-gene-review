The accumulation of beta amyloid (Aβ) has been a primary target for Alzheimer 
disease therapeutic strategies. Previously, we discovered an activity from 
Streptomyces sp. KK565 growth media that inhibits Aβ aggregation. The active 
component was an aminopeptidase and named Streptomyces sp. KK565 aminopeptidase 
(SKAP). SKAP cleaved N-terminal amino-acids of Aβ(1-42) monomer, inhibited 
formation of fibrils and protected Aβ(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity. 
Over-expression of a human homolog of SKAP, glutamate carboxypeptidase II 
(hGCPII) in Aβ-oversynthesizing cells dramatically reduced the Aβ levels. These 
findings suggest a possible role of M28 family peptidases in preventing Aβ 
deposits in mammalian brain.
