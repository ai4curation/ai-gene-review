Characterisation of an mRNA encoding a human ribosomal protein homologous to the 
yeast L44 ribosomal protein.

Davies MS, Henney A, Ward WH, Craig RK.

We describe the isolation and characterisation of a full-length cDNA sequence 
(pZH-21) of a human ribosomal protein (rp) mRNA isolated from a cDNA library 
constructed from the human ZR-75-1 mammary tumour cell-line. The predicted 
protein is highly basic and shows 72% homology at the amino acid (aa) level with 
yeast rp L44. Comparative RNA blotting of ZR-75-1 poly(A)+ RNA isolated from 
cells cultured in the presence of the anti-oestrogen tamoxifen demonstrates the 
presence of a number of mRNA species whose concentration is elevated 
co-ordinately 5-6-fold in the presence of 17beta-oestradiol. Insulin in the 
presence of tamoxifen, also enhanced rp mRNA levels suggesting increased levels 
are a reflection of cell proliferation as opposed to specific hormonal 
regulation. Genomic analysis demonstrates the presence of a family of related 
human sequences, and homology with rat and guinea pig rp genes, but not yeast 
DNA. The conservation of rp aa sequence, in the absence of detectable homology 
at the nucleotide (nt) level, points to an important common functional role of 
the L44 protein in ribosome structure and function in man and yeast.
