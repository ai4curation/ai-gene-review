We demonstrate that missense mutations (Asp175Asn; Glu180Gly) in the 
alpha-tropomyosin gene cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) linked 
to chromosome 15q2. These findings implicated components of the troponin complex 
as candidate genes at other FHC loci, particularly cardiac troponin T, which was 
mapped in this study to chromosome 1q. Missense mutations (Ile79Asn; Arg92Gln) 
and a mutation in the splice donor sequence of intron 15 of the cardiac troponin 
T gene are also shown to cause FHC. Because alpha-tropomyosin and cardiac 
troponin T as well as beta myosin heavy chain mutations cause the same 
phenotype, we conclude that FHC is a disease of the sarcomere. Further, because 
the splice site mutation is predicted to function as a null allele, we suggest 
that abnormal stoichiometry of sarcomeric proteins can cause cardiac 
hypertrophy.
