In recent genome-wide association studies, the extracellular chaperone protein, 
clusterin, has been identified as a newly-discovered risk factor in Alzheimer's 
disease. We have examined the interactions between human clusterin and the 
Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-β(1-40) peptide (Aβ(1-40)), which is 
prone to aggregate into an ensemble of oligomeric intermediates implicated in 
both the proliferation of amyloid fibrils and in neuronal toxicity. Using highly 
sensitive single-molecule fluorescence methods, we have found that Aβ(1-40) 
forms a heterogeneous distribution of small oligomers (from dimers to 50-mers), 
all of which interact with clusterin to form long-lived, stable complexes. 
Consequently, clusterin is able to influence both the aggregation and 
disaggregation of Aβ(1-40) by sequestration of the Aβ oligomers. These results 
not only elucidate the protective role of clusterin but also provide a molecular 
basis for the genetic link between clusterin and Alzheimer's disease.
