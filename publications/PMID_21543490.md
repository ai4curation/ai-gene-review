Budding of retroviruses from cell membranes requires ubiquitination of Gag and 
recruitment of cellular proteins involved in endosome sorting, including 
endosome sorting complex required for transport III (ESCRT-III) protein complex 
and vacuolar protein sorting 4 (VPS4) and its ATPase. In response to infection, 
a cellular mechanism has evolved that blocks virus replication early and late in 
the budding process through expression of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), 
a dimer homologue of ubiquitin. Interferon treatment of DF-1 cells blocks avian 
sarcoma/leukosis virus release, demonstrating that this mechanism is functional 
under physiological conditions. The late block to release is caused in part by a 
loss in interaction between VPS4 and its coactivator protein LIP5, which is 
required to promote the formation of the ESCRT III-VPS4 double-hexamer complex 
to activate its ATPase. ISG15 is conjugated to two different 
LIP5-ESCRT-III-binding charged multivesicular body proteins, CHMP2A and CHMP5. 
Upon ISGylation of each, interaction with LIP5 is no longer detected. Two other 
ESCRT-III proteins, CHMP4B and CHMP6, are also conjugated to ISG15. ISGylation 
of CHMP2A, CHMP4B, and CHMP6 weakens their binding directly to VPS4, thereby 
facilitating the release of this protein from the membrane into the cytosol. The 
remaining budding complex fails to release particles from the cell membrane. 
Introducing a mutant of ISG15 into cells that cannot be conjugated to proteins 
prevents the ISG15-dependent mechanism from blocking virus release. CHMP5 is the 
primary switch to initiate the antiviral mechanism, because removal of CHMP5 
from cells prevents ISGylation of CHMP2A and CHMP6.

INTRODUCTION

Retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and avian sarcoma/leukosis virus (ASLV) release from cells using similar but different pathways that are mediated by small protein-binding domains (L domains) found in the structural proteins of the viruses ( 8 , 41 , 42 ). L domains recruit host cell proteins Nedd4 ( 11 ) and Tsg101 ( 38 ); the latter protein is involved in membrane vesicle biogenesis and forms part of the e ndosomal s orting c omplex r equired for t ransport (ESCRT). The ESCRT proteins are subdivided into several complexes, referred to as ESCRT-0, -I, -II, and -III ( 2 ). HIV-1 and ASLV utilize ESCRT-I and -II proteins, respectively, to assemble the same late budding complex ( 6 , 23 , 24 ) that contains 10 different ch arged m ultivesicular body proteins (CHMPs) that comprise the ESCRT-III complex. In addition, the viruses appear to passage through different membranes in the process ( 17 ). The ESCRT-III proteins in turn contain microtubule-interacting and transport (MIT) interaction motif (MIM) domains which recruit the vacuolar protein sorting protein 4 (VPS4) AAA ATPase to the site of budding through interaction with the VPS4 MIT domain. There are two types of MIM domains known, MIM1 (found in CHMP1A, -1B, -2A, and -2B) and MIM2 (found in CHMP4A to -C and CHMP6) ( 10 , 34 ). Membrane scission, which releases particles from the cell membrane, is catalyzed by the ESCRT-III proteins ( 12 ). When VPS4 hydrolyzes ATP, the ESCRT-III complex is disassembled into the cytosol. VPS4 is normally found in the cytosol as an inactive dimer. It is activated on membranes when it forms a double hexamer ring structure in the presence of a coactivator protein, LIP5 ( 30 ). Point mutations that inactivate the ATPase block the release of virus from the cell membrane ( 6 , 9 , 16 ). The coactivator, LIP5, is delivered to membranes by binding to several ESCRT-III proteins, including CHMP1B, -2A, -3, and -5 ( 32 ). CHMP5 differs from the other ESCRT-III proteins in that its LIP5-binding site is unique and it does not directly interact with VPS4 ( 1 ).

A cellular innate immunity mechanism which targets retrovirus budding both early and late in the release process induces the expression of i nterferon- s timulated g ene 15 (ISG15) and its specific ISG15 E1, E2, and E3 ligase complex ( 3 , 4 , 25 , 27 , 33 , 43 , 45 ). ISG15 is a dimer homologue of ubiquitin. Ubiquitination of viral Gag is required for normal release of retroviruses from cells, and the addition of ubiquitin is catalyzed by its E1, E2, and E3 ubiquitin ligase complex ( 5 , 15 , 21 , 37 ). Neither HIV-1 Gag nor Tsg101 is ISGylated. Several reports show that ISG15 expression inhibits the E3 subunit of the ligase involved in Gag or Tsg101 ubiquitination, suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed inhibition ( 14 , 19 , 20 , 44 ). Disruption of the late release process is a more general antiviral mechanism in which the VPS4 ATPase is removed from the budding complex ( 25 ). When ISG15 and its ligase are expressed in cells, CHMP5 becomes ISGylated and accumulates in the membrane fraction ( 25 ). This blocks the interaction of LIP5 with VPS4, thereby preventing the activation of the ATPase, and promotes the release of the protein from the membrane. If CHMP5 expression is suppressed in cells by specific targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), ISG15 no longer inhibits virus budding, and the complex between VPS4 and LIP5 is restored ( 25 , 40 ). The latter observation suggests that CHMP5 is not the sole delivery system of LIP5 to VPS4 on the membrane. The finding that expression of ISG15 in cells blocks virus release provides a mechanistic explanation for an old observation in the literature that murine leukemia virus is inhibited by interferon expression and results in virus trapped on the cell surface ( 26 ).

In the present paper, we further characterize the mechanism of inhibition late in the budding process. We present evidence that when CHMP5 is ISGylated, it loses the ability to interact with LIP5, thus failing to deliver LIP5 to the budding complex. Several other ESCRT-III proteins, including CHMP2A, CHMP3, CHMP4B, and CHMP6, are also ISGylated. Modification of CHMP2A, similar to that of CHMP5, causes the loss of this protein's ability to interact with LIP5. In addition, ISGylation of CHMP2A, CHMP4B, and CHMP6 weakens their binding directly to VPS4. The combination of both causes the release of VPS4 from the budding complex, resulting in the budding defect. If CHMP5 is removed from cells, CHMP2A and CHMP6 are not ISGylated. This indicates that CHMP5 is the key regulatory protein to initiate the antiviral mechanism. This mechanism functions under physiological conditions, because interferon treatment of DF-1 cells blocks the release of ASLV. Also, the introduction of a mutant of ISG15 that cannot be conjugated to protein prevents the inhibition, indicating that covalent linkage of ISG15 to protein is required.

ISG15 expression results in LIP5 released from the budding complex into the cytosol.

The finding that LIP5 still binds to CHMP3 in the presence of ISG15 expression might suggest that not all of the LIP5 would be released into the cytosol. We therefore examined the distribution of FLAG-LIP5 between the cytosol and membrane pellet fraction in the presence and absence of ISG15, E1, and E2 coexpression as described in Materials and Methods. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and endogenous CHMP5 or CHMP2A and exogenous FLAG-LIP5 were detected by Western blotting using antiserum directed at CHMP5, CHMP2A, and the FLAG tag, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3 (FLAG-LIP5 panel, lanes 1 and 2), FLAG-LIP5 was detected in both the soluble and membranes fractions in the absence of ISG15 expression. In contrast, most but not all LIP5 was found in the cytosol when ISG15, E1 and E2 were coexpressed (FLAG-LIP5 panel, lanes 3 and 4). As previously reported ( 25 ), endogenous CHMP5 accumulated in the membrane pellet fraction when ISG15, E1 and E2 were coexpressed (Endogenous CHMP5 panel, lanes 3 and 4). The distribution between the soluble and membrane fractions of endogenous CHMP2A was mostly unaffected (Endogenous CHMP2A panel, lanes 1 to 4). Again, β-actin was probed as a sample loading control (β-Actin panel, lanes 1 to 4).

DISCUSSION

The interferon-induced gene ISG15 inhibited budding late in the release process by preventing the formation of the VPS4-LIP5 complex required to activate its ATPase ( 25 ). At the same time, there was a significant decrease in VPS4 cosedimentation with insoluble CHMP5 polymers on cell membranes. Because CHMP5 was known to bind to LIP5, we asked if the interaction between these two proteins was altered. This appears to be the case ( Fig. 2 ), highlighting an important role for CHMP5 in delivering LIP5 to the membrane. However, when CHMP5 expression in cells was suppressed, the ability of ISG15 to inhibit virus release was blocked but the VPS4/LIP5 interaction was restored ( 25 ). This indicated that there must be an alternative pathway to deliver LIP5 to the budding complex in membranes. Three other ESCRT-III proteins, CHMP1B, -2A, and -3, are known to bind to LIP5 ( 32 ). CHMP2A and -3 are required for virus infection, while CHMP1B is not ( 39 ). We therefore asked if the LIP5 binding to any of these proteins was changed by ISG15 coexpression in cells. We found that the binding of endogenous or exogenous CHMP2A to LIP5 was not detected when ISG15 was coexpressed, similar to results for CHMP5 ( Fig. 2 ). In contrast, the binding of LIP5 to CHMP3 was not affected under the same conditions ( Fig. 2 ). Because coimmunoprecipitation of CHMP2A with LIP5 was adversely affected by ISG15 coexpression, we examined whether this ESCRT-III protein was conjugated to ISG15. Using a His-tagged ISG15, we purified and then detected CHMP2A covalently linked to ISG15 ( Fig. 4 ), similar to the case with CHMP5. If we substituted an ISG15 GG-to-AA mutant that cannot be conjugated to protein, we did not detect ISGylation of CHMP2A. Thus, CHMP2A is a second ESCRT-III protein targeted for ISGylation that when modified results in the loss of its binding to LIP5. These observations strongly suggest that there are two parallel LIP5 membrane delivery pathways; one via CHMP5, which does not bind to VPS4 ( 25 ), and one via CHMP2A, which does bind to VPS4 ( Fig. 5 ). We did not detect ISGylation of CHMP3-FLAG. However, when we substituted an HA-CHMP3 for the CHMP3-FLAG, we did detect ISG15 conjugation to this protein even though we did not detect a concomitant change in its binding to LIP5. In this regard, it is different from CHMP5 and CHMP2A. Because modification of this protein influences the degree of its ISGylation, it is difficult to estimate the amount of total protein that is ISGylated in cells. Using the same selection protocol, we detected ISGylation of the non-LIP5-binding proteins, CHMP4B and CHMP6. Thus, many of the ESCRT-III proteins found in the budding complex are conjugated to ISG15 under these conditions.

When CHMP5 is ISGylated, VPS4 and LIP5 are released from and/or not recruited to the budding complex in the membrane (see reference 24 ) ( Fig. 3 and 7 ). Because CHMP5 does not directly interact with VPS4, we examined whether the interaction between VPS4 and other ESCRT-III proteins with MIM1 domains was changed when ISG15 was coexpressed in cells. CHMP2A interaction with VPS4 detectably decreased in the presence of overexpression of ISG15 ( Fig. 5 A). In contrast, CHMP1B-VPS4 and CHMP3-VPS4 interactions were barely or not affected. CHMP4B and CHMP6 are also known to bind to VPS4 via the MIM2 domain ( 10 ). We detected decreases in the binding of both proteins to VPS4 when ISG15 was coexpressed in cells. Thus, the release of VPS4 into the cytosol is caused by the sum of ISGylations of several ESCRT-III proteins.

The fact that removal of CHMP5 from cells blocks the action of ISG15 suggests that ISGylation of CHMP5 is the key to initiate the antirelease mechanism. This hypothesis is supported by the findings that removal of CHMP5 from cells blocks the effects of ISG15 expression. Moreover, ISGylation of CHMP2A and CHMP6 were dependent upon CHMP5 ( Fig. 6 ). This probably reflects a requirement for CHMP5-ISG15, because it is this form of the protein that appears to accumulate in the budding complex on the membrane ( 25 ). As yet, we do not know the reason ISGylated CHMP5 accumulates on the membrane. It is likely that ISGylation of CHMP4B was also dependent upon CHMP5, but we did not get sufficient expression of this protein in the lysate fraction to determine if this was the case. Independently, we examined whether there was a change in distribution of CHMP2A when ISG15 was coexpressed in cells. In contrast to that of CHMP5 ( 25 ), we detected little change in distribution of CHMP2A between the membrane and cytosol fractions ( Fig. 3 ). A similar result was obtained for endogenous CHMP4B and CHMP6 (data not shown). This was not unexpected, because in the absence of the VPS4/LIP5 ATPase, ESCRT-III proteins would not be released from the membrane. Taken together, these results indicate that CHMP5 is the key regulatory molecule for initiation of disruption of the late budding complex, and this is summarized in the model presented in Fig. 7 .

While many of these experiments employed expression vectors for viral Gag, ISG15, and its ligase complex, and ESCRT proteins to follow the release of virus-like particles (VLPs), we have now shown that ISG15 inhibition occurred under more physiological conditions, under which release of ASLV from DF-1 cells was blocked by chicken interferon treatment. The degree of inhibition was the same as that achieved by introducing expression vectors for ISG15 and its ligase complex ( Fig. 1 ). The inhibition to virus release was also blocked by substituting the GG-to-AA mutant of ISG15 for the wild-type protein, indicating that conjugation of ISG15 to protein was required. Moreover, if CHMP5 expression was significantly lowered in cells, the inhibition of virus release caused by either interferon treatment or expression of ISG15 and its ligase complex was partially restored. As described above, CHMP5 is the key to initiation of the inhibition of the late budding step by controlling the delivery of the LIP5 coactivator to VPS4 on the membrane and promoting ISGylation of many of the other ESRT-III proteins which, in turn, weakens the binding of VPS4 for these ESCRT-III proteins, resulting in its release into the cytosol. Because ISG15 expression in cells also inhibits early steps in the budding process not dependent upon CHMP5, such as inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase, we would not expect full restoration of the budding of ASLV by removal of CHMP5 from the cytosol. We estimate from the experiments shown in Fig. 1 that about half of the inhibition to release of ASLV was caused by blocking early steps in the process and half by blocking the CHMP-dependent steps late in the budding process.

Finally, the mechanism for blocking release of retroviruses from cell membranes described in this study has broader implications for many enveloped viruses, including filo-, paramyxo-, and rhabdoviruses ( 22 , 28 , 29 , 35 , 36 ). This is because these viruses depend on the ESCRT-III/VPS4 ATPase complex to release particles from cell membranes. Also, the findings that many different ESCRT-III proteins are ISGylated and that this results in changes in the binding properties of each protein to LIP5 or VPS4 strongly suggest that interferon-induced expression of ISG15 will shut down normal cellular endocytosis and multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis.
