Adapter proteins made up of Src homology (SH) domains mediate multiple cellular 
signaling events initiated by receptor protein tyrosine kinases. Here we report 
that Grb4 is an adapter protein closely related to but distinct from Nck that is 
made up of three SH3 domains and one SH2 domain. Northern analysis indicated 
that both genes are expressed in multiple tissues. Both Nck and Grb4 proteins 
could associate with receptor tyrosine kinases and the SH3-binding proteins PAK, 
Sos1, and PRK2, and they synergized with v-Abl and Sos to induce gene expression 
via the transcription factor Elk-1. Although neither protein was transforming on 
its own, both Nck and Grb4 cooperated with v-Abl to transform NIH 3T3 cells and 
influenced the morphology and anchorage-dependent growth of wild type 
Ras-transformed cells. Nck and Grb4 therefore appear to be functionally 
redundant.
