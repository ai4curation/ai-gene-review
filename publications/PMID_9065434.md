A positive regulatory element in the interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter, designated 
the antigen receptor response element-2, is essential for the induction of IL-2 
gene expression upon the binding of an inducible multiprotein complex of 
proteins known as nuclear factor of activated T cells. In the current study, we 
demonstrated that the winged-helix transcription factor IL-2 enhancer binding 
factor (ILF) is constitutively expressed in both resting and activated Jurkat 
cells and binds to two adjacent sequence motifs immediately downstream of the 
binding site for NFAT. One of these elements has a high degree of homology with 
consensus binding sites for a variety of winged-helix DNA binding proteins, and 
the second site functions to modulate ILF binding. Mutagenesis of each of the 
two sequence elements required for ILF binding decreased IL-2 promoter activity 
when assayed in transfection assays. Although ILF bound constitutively to the 
IL-2 promoter, it was not detected as a component of the NFAT complex. These 
results suggest that important regulatory sequences in the IL-2 promoter are 
bound by ILF and that this binding may be involved in the control of IL-2 gene 
expression.
