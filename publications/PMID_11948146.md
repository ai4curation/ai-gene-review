The Bacillus subtilis competence transcription factor ComK is required for 
establishment of competence for genetic transformation. In an attempt to study 
the ComK factor further, we explored the genes regulated by ComK using the DNA 
microarray technique. In addition to the genes known to be dependent on ComK for 
expression, we found many genes or operons whose ComK dependence was not known 
previously. Among these genes, we confirmed the ComK dependence of 16 genes by 
using lacZ fusions, and three genes were partially dependent on ComK. 
Transformation efficiency was significantly reduced in an smf disruption mutant, 
although disruption of the other ComK-dependent genes did not result in 
significant decreases in transformation efficiency. Nucleotide sequences similar 
to that of the ComK box were found for most of the newly discovered genes 
regulated by ComK.
