Autophagy is the catabolic degradation of cellular cytoplasmic constituents via 
the lysosomal pathway that physiologically elicits a primarily cytoprotective 
function, but can rapidly be upregulated in response to stressors thereby 
inducing cell death. We have reported that the balance between the BCL2 family 
proteins BOK and MCL1 regulates human trophoblast cell fate and its alteration 
toward cell death typifies preeclampsia. Here we demonstrate that BOK is a 
potent inducer of autophagy as shown by increased LC3B-II production, 
autophagosomal formation and lysosomal activation in HEK 293. In contrast, using 
JEG3 cells we showed that prosurvival MCL1 acts as a repressor of autophagy via 
an interaction with BECN1, which is abrogated by BOK. We found that MCL1-cleaved 
products, specifically MCL1c157, trigger autophagy while the splicing variant 
MCL1S has no effect. Treatment of JEG3 cells with nitric oxide donor SNP 
resulted in BOK-MCL1 rheostat dysregulation, favoring BOK accumulation, thereby 
inducing autophagy. Overexpression of MCL1 rescued oxidative stress-induced 
autophagy. Of clinical relevance, we report aberrant autophagy levels in the 
preeclamptic placenta due to impaired recruitment of BECN1 to MCL1. Our data 
provided the first evidence for a key role of the BOK-MCL1 system in regulating 
autophagy in the human placenta, whereby an adverse environment as seen in 
preeclampsia tilts the BOK-MCL1 balance toward the build-up of isoforms that 
triggers placental autophagy.
