Mice overexpressing the mitotic checkpoint kinase gene BubR1 live longer, 
whereas mice hypomorphic for BubR1 (BubR1(H/H)) live shorter and show signs of 
accelerated aging. As wild-type mice age, BubR1 levels decline in many tissues, 
a process that is proposed to underlie normal aging and age-related diseases. 
Understanding why BubR1 declines with age and how to slow this process is 
therefore of considerable interest. The sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are a family of 
NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases that can delay age-related diseases. Here, we show 
that the loss of BubR1 levels with age is due to a decline in NAD(+) and the 
ability of SIRT2 to maintain lysine-668 of BubR1 in a deacetylated state, which 
is counteracted by the acetyltransferase CBP. Overexpression of SIRT2 or 
treatment of mice with the NAD(+) precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) 
increases BubR1 abundance in vivo. Overexpression of SIRT2 in BubR1(H/H) animals 
increases median lifespan, with a greater effect in male mice. Together, these 
data indicate that further exploration of the potential of SIRT2 and NAD(+) to 
delay diseases of aging in mammals is warranted.
