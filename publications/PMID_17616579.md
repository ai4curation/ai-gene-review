Recently identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) isolates that are infectious in cell 
culture provide a genetic system to evaluate the significance of virus-host 
interactions for HCV replication. We have completed a systematic RNAi screen 
wherein siRNAs were designed that target 62 host genes encoding proteins that 
physically interact with HCV RNA or proteins or belong to cellular pathways 
thought to modulate HCV infection. This includes 10 host proteins that we 
identify in this study to bind HCV NS5A. siRNAs that target 26 of these host 
genes alter infectious HCV production >3-fold. Included in this set of 26 were 
siRNAs that target Dicer, a principal component of the RNAi silencing pathway. 
Contrary to the hypothesis that RNAi is an antiviral pathway in mammals, as has 
been reported for subgenomic HCV replicons, siRNAs that target Dicer inhibited 
HCV replication. Furthermore, siRNAs that target several other components of the 
RNAi pathway also inhibit HCV replication. MicroRNA profiling of human liver, 
human hepatoma Huh-7.5 cells, and Huh-7.5 cells that harbor replicating HCV 
demonstrated that miR-122 is the predominant microRNA in each environment. 
miR-122 has been previously implicated in positively regulating the replication 
of HCV genotype 1 replicons. We find that 2'-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotide 
depletion of miR-122 also inhibits HCV genotype 2a replication and infectious 
virus production. Our data define 26 host genes that modulate HCV infection and 
indicate that the requirement for functional RNAi for HCV replication is 
dominant over any antiviral activity this pathway may exert against HCV.
