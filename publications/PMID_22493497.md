The epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) is critical for Na(+) homeostasis and blood 
pressure control. Defects in its regulation cause inherited forms of 
hypertension and hypotension. Previous work found that ENaC gating is regulated 
by proteases through cleavage of the extracellular domains of the α and γ 
subunits. Here we tested the hypothesis that ENaC is regulated by proprotein 
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a protease that modulates the risk 
of cardiovascular disease. PCSK9 reduced ENaC current in Xenopus oocytes and in 
epithelia. This occurred through a decrease in ENaC protein at the cell surface 
and in the total cellular pool, an effect that did not require the catalytic 
activity of PCSK9. PCSK9 interacted with all three ENaC subunits and decreased 
their trafficking to the cell surface by increasing proteasomal degradation. In 
contrast to its previously reported effects on the LDL receptor, PCSK9 did not 
alter ENaC endocytosis or degradation of the pool of ENaC at the cell surface. 
These results support a role for PCSK9 in the regulation of ENaC trafficking in 
the biosynthetic pathway, likely by increasing endoplasmic reticulum-associated 
degradation. By reducing ENaC channel number, PCSK9 could modulate epithelial 
Na(+) absorption, a major contributor to blood pressure control.

Abstract

The epithelial Na + channel (ENaC) is critical for Na + homeostasis and blood pressure control. Defects in its regulation cause inherited forms of hypertension and hypotension. Previous work found that ENaC gating is regulated by proteases through cleavage of the extracellular domains of the α and γ subunits. Here we tested the hypothesis that ENaC is regulated by proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a protease that modulates the risk of cardiovascular disease. PCSK9 reduced ENaC current in Xenopus oocytes and in epithelia. This occurred through a decrease in ENaC protein at the cell surface and in the total cellular pool, an effect that did not require the catalytic activity of PCSK9. PCSK9 interacted with all three ENaC subunits and decreased their trafficking to the cell surface by increasing proteasomal degradation. In contrast to its previously reported effects on the LDL receptor, PCSK9 did not alter ENaC endocytosis or degradation of the pool of ENaC at the cell surface. These results support a role for PCSK9 in the regulation of ENaC trafficking in the biosynthetic pathway, likely by increasing endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. By reducing ENaC channel number, PCSK9 could modulate epithelial Na + absorption, a major contributor to blood pressure control.

Introduction

The epithelial Na + channel (ENaC) 2 plays an important role in absorption of Na + across epithelia, including the kidney, collecting duct and connecting tubule, lung, distal colon, and sweat duct (reviewed in Refs. 1 , 2 ). A heterotrimer composed of three homologous subunits (α, β, and γ), ENaC is expressed at the apical membrane where it forms a pathway for Na + to enter the cell. Na + leaves the cell at the basolateral membrane via the Na + -K + -ATPase, which completes the pathway for Na + absorption. This process is critical to control extracellular volume and to maintain the composition and quantity of epithelial surface liquid. This is illustrated by several diseases. For example, ENaC mutations that slow its retrieval from the cell surface cause an inherited form of hypertension (Liddle's syndrome), resulting from excessive renal Na + absorption ( 3 – 5 ). Defects in ENaC regulation are responsible for most of the known genetic forms of hypertension ( 6 ). Conversely, loss of function mutations cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, a disorder of renal Na + wasting ( 7 ). In the lung, defects in ENaC activity cause pulmonary edema and may contribute to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis ( 8 ).

Previous work indicates that ENaC is regulated by serine proteases (reviewed in Ref. 9 ). Furin, a member of the proprotein convertase family, cleaves the extracellular domain of αENaC at basic motifs, removing a 26-amino acid fragment ( 10 ). In γENaC, furin cleaves the extracellular domain at a single site and a second, more distal site is cleaved by additional proteases ( e.g. CAP1/prostasin, plasmin, elastase), releasing a fragment of ∼43 amino acids ( 11 – 15 ). Proteolytic cleavage of α- and γENaC converts quiescent channels into active Na + -conducting channels. This activation occurs by relieving the channel from inhibition by extracellular Na + (“Na + self-inhibition”) ( 16 ). Proteolytic cleavage of ENaC is a regulated process. For example, cleavage is inhibited by increased intracellular Na + , providing a negative feedback mechanism to regulate Na + absorption ( 17 ). Conversely, cleavage is enhanced by Na + depletion and aldosterone infusion ( 18 , 19 ). Cleavage is also disrupted in pathological states. In Liddle's syndrome, cleavage is increased, likely through prolonged exposure of ENaC to proteases present at the cell surface ( 5 ). There is also evidence to suggest that ENaC cleavage is increased in nephrotic syndrome ( 15 , 20 ) and cystic fibrosis ( 21 , 22 ).

Because proteolytic cleavage modulates ENaC gating, there has been considerable interest in identifying additional proteases that regulate ENaC. The proprotein convertase family has nine members, including furin ( 23 ). In this work, we investigated a potential role for another member of this family, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) ( 24 ). Consistent with a potential role in ENaC regulation, PCSK9 is expressed in the kidney and lung ( 24 ). It is synthesized as a 72-kDa immature precursor that undergoes autocatalytic cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum to generate a 63-kDa mature protein ( 25 ). The cleaved N-terminal fragment remains associated with the mature protein and is necessary for its secretion, allowing it to circulate in the blood ( 26 ).

Previous work has focused on the role of PCSK9 in the regulation of the LDL receptor (LDLR). By reducing expression of the LDLR at the cell surface, PCSK9 increases serum levels of LDL cholesterol ( 25 , 27 , 28 ). Rare gain-of-function PCSK9 mutations cause hypercholesterolemia and increase the risk of coronary heart disease, whereas loss-of-function mutations cause hypocholesterolemia and protect against heart disease ( 29 – 33 ). The mechanisms by which PCSK9 alters LDLR surface expression are not completely understood. Secreted PCSK9 (or recombinant PCSK9 added to the extracellular medium) binds to the LDLR and undergoes endocytosis ( 26 , 27 , 34 – 36 ). In the endocytic pathway, PCSK9 increases lysosomal degradation of the LDLR. Although secreted PCSK9 regulates LDLR trafficking, additional evidence suggests that PCSK9 may also induce LDLR degradation through an intracellular route ( 37 ). Interestingly, although PCSK9 induces degradation of the LDLR, its protease activity is not required ( 33 , 38 ). Thus, it has been proposed that PCSK9 regulates the LDLR through a chaperone mechanism, rather than through its function as a protease. Although it seems clear that the PCSK9 regulates the LDLR and two closely related receptors (very low density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 ( 38 )), additional substrates for PCSK9 have not been identified. Here we show that PCSK9 regulates ENaC and we explore the mechanisms that underlie this regulation.

DISCUSSION

Recent work has focused on the regulation of epithelial Na + transport by proteases, including furin, a member of the proprotein convertase family ( 9 ). Here we found that ENaC is regulated by PCSK9, another member of this protease family. However, furin and PCSK9 have opposite effects on ENaC current and they regulate ENaC through different mechanisms. In contrast to furin, which activates ENaC by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domains of the α and γ subunits, PCSK9 inhibits ENaC by reducing its cell surface expression. Moreover, unlike furin, PCSK9 regulates ENaC independent of its protease activity.

The data indicate that PCSK9 reduces ENaC surface expression primarily by increasing its degradation in the biosynthetic pathway, which reduces the pool of ENaC available for exocytosis. Consistent with this concept, we found that PCSK9 decreased ENaC exocytosis and increased the rate of ENaC degradation in the proteasome. Moreover, PCSK9 had no effect on the rate of ENaC endocytosis or its degradation in the endocytic pathway. Coimmunoprecipitation studies suggest that ENaC and PCSK9 interact with one another in their immature (uncleaved) states, likely prior to ENaC cleavage in the Golgi apparatus (although we cannot exclude the possibility that proteolytic cleavage induces conformation changes that prohibit binding). Together, these findings are most consistent with a model in which PCSK9 enhances endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation of ENaC.

The mechanism by which PCSK9 regulates ENaC shares some similarities to its regulation of the LDLR. In both cases, PCSK9 reduces surface expression through a change in trafficking, culminating in increased degradation. Likewise, both occur independent of PCSK9 protease activity. However, there are also important differences. Contrary to regulation of ENaC in the biosynthetic pathway, PCSK9 predominately regulates the LDLR in the endocytic pathway ( 34 , 35 ). This suggests that PCSK9 can function in multiple cellular compartments. There are also differences in the mechanisms of binding. PCSK9 interacts with the LDLR through two interfaces. Crystallization revealed that the catalytic domain of PCSK9 binds to the epidermal growth factor-like A domain in the LDLR ( 36 ). A recent report found a second interaction between the PCSK9 C-terminal domain and the LDLR ligand binding domain, which was required for regulation ( 52 ). Importantly, ENaC lacks homologous motifs, indicating that it interacts with PCSK9 through a novel binding mechanism. This interaction could be direct or could occur indirectly through an adaptor protein.

The proprotein convertase furin regulates ENaC by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domains of α- and γENaC, which releases inhibitory peptides ( 9 ). In this manner, furin regulates ENaC gating, converting near-silent channels into active channels. However, there may be an additional level of complexity. Furin also proteolytically cleaves PCSK9, which inactivates it ( 53 ). Thus, through a decrease in PCSK9 activity, furin could increase ENaC cell surface expression. This raises the interesting possibility that furin regulates ENaC through dual effects on channel trafficking and gating.

Defects in ENaC regulation are responsible for the majority of the known genetic forms of hypertension, which is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases. Thus, PCSK9 could modulate cardiovascular risk in part through its regulation of ENaC. We speculate that a decrease in PCSK9 activity would increase renal Na + absorption and, therefore, raise the risk of hypertension and associated cardiovascular disease. However, such a mechanism would counter the previously reported effect of PCSK9 mutations on cardiovascular risk. Activating mutations were found to increase the risk, whereas loss-of-function mutations reduced the risk ( 29 – 33 ). These effects are thought to occur through changes in expression of the LDLR, which produce changes in serum levels of cholesterol. Thus, it is possible that PCSK9 regulation of ENaC and the LDLR have opposing effects on cardiovascular risk. On the other hand, our data suggest that PCSK9 regulates ENaC and the LDLR through different binding sites and different mechanisms. Thus, the PCSK9 mutations that disrupt LDLR regulation may have dissimilar effects on ENaC. Additional work will be required to test whether naturally occurring mutations in PCSK9 alter ENaC trafficking, renal Na + homeostasis, and blood pressure.
