Loop-tail (Lp) mice show a very severe neural tube defect, craniorachischisis, 
which is caused by mis-sense mutations in the Vangl2 gene. The membrane protein 
Vangl2 belongs to a highly conserved group of proteins that regulate planar 
polarity in certain epithelia, and that are also important for convergent 
extension movements during gastrulation and neurulation. A specific anti-Vangl2 
antiserum was produced and used to examine the tissue, cell type, and 
sub-cellular localization of Vangl2 during embryogenesis. Vangl2 protein is 
expressed at high levels in the neural tube and shows a dynamic expression 
profile during neurulation. After neural tube closure, robust Vangl2 staining is 
detected in several neural and neurosensory tissues, including cerebral cortex, 
dorsal root ganglia, olfactory epithelium, retina, mechanosensory hair cells of 
the cochlea, and optic nerve. Vangl2 is also expressed during organogenesis in a 
number of tubular epithelia, including the bronchial tree, intestinal 
crypt/villus axis, and renal tubular segments derived from ureteric bud and from 
metanephric mesenchyme. Examination of Vangl2 localization in the neural tubes 
and cochleas of the normal and Lp/Lp embryos shows disruption of normal membrane 
localization of Vangl2 in independent alleles at Lp (Lp, Lp(m1Jus)) as well as 
overall decrease in the expression level.
