Activins and other members of the transforming growth factor-beta-like 
superfamily of growth factors transduce their signals by interacting with two 
types of receptor serine/threonine kinases. The Smad proteins, a new family of 
intracellular mediators are involved in the signaling pathways of these 
receptors, but the initial stages of their activation as well as their specific 
functions remain to be defined. We report here that the pathway-specific Smad2 
and 3 can form a complex with the activin receptor in a ligand-dependent manner. 
This complex formation is rapid but also transient. Indeed, soon after their 
association with the activin receptor, Smad2 and Smad3 are released into the 
cytoplasm where they interact with the common partner Smad4. These Smad 
complexes then mediate activin-induced transcription. Finally, we show that the 
inhibitory Smad7 can prevent the association of the two pathway-specific Smads 
with the activin receptor complex, thereby blocking the activin signal.
