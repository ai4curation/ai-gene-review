The cellular response to toxic stimuli is elicited through the expression of 
heat shock proteins, a transcriptional process that relies upon conserved DNA 
elements in the promoters: the Heat Shock Elements, activated by the heat shock 
factors, and the CCAAT boxes. The identity of the CCAAT activator(s) is unclear 
because two distinct entities, NF-Y and HSP-CBF, have been implicated in the 
HSP70 system. The former is a conserved ubiquitous trimer containing 
histone-like subunits, the latter a 110-kDa protein with an acidic N-terminal. 
We analyzed two CCAAT-containing promoters, HSP70 and HSP40, with recombinant 
NF-Y and HSP-CBF using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, protein-protein 
interactions, transfections and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) 
assays. Both recognize a common DNA-binding protein in nuclear extracts, 
identified in vitro and in vivo as NF-Y. Both CCAAT boxes show high affinity for 
recombinant NF-Y but not for HSP-CBF. However, HSP-CBF does activate HSP70 and 
HSP40 transcription under basal and heat shocked conditions; for doing so, it 
requires an intact NF-Y trimer as judged by cotransfections with a diagnostic 
NF-YA dominant negative vector. HSP-CBF interacts in solution and on DNA with 
the NF-Y trimer through an evolutionary conserved region. In yeast two-hybrid 
assays HSP-CBF interacts with NF-YB. These data implicate HSP-CBF as a non-DNA 
binding coactivator of heat shock genes that act on a DNA-bound NF-Y.
