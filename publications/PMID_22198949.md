Microglia activated by extracellularly deposited amyloid β peptide (Aβ) act as a 
two-edged sword in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis: on the one hand, they 
damage neurons by releasing neurotoxic proinflammatory mediators (M1 
activation); on the other hand, they protect neurons by triggering 
anti-inflammatory/neurotrophic M2 activation and by clearing Aβ via 
phagocytosis. TLRs are associated with Aβ-induced microglial inflammatory 
activation and Aβ internalization, but the mechanisms remain unclear. In this 
study, we used real-time surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and conventional 
biochemical pull-down assays to demonstrate a direct interaction between TLR2 
and the aggregated 42-aa form of human Aβ (Aβ42). TLR2 deficiency reduced 
Aβ42-triggered inflammatory activation but enhanced Aβ phagocytosis in cultured 
microglia and macrophages. By expressing TLR2 in HEK293 cells that do not 
endogenously express TLR2, we observed that TLR2 expression enabled HEK293 cells 
to respond to Aβ42. Through site-directed mutagenesis of tlr2 gene, we 
identified the amino acids EKKA (741-744) as a critical cytoplasmic domain for 
transduction of inflammatory signals. By coexpressing TLR1 or TLR6 in 
TLR2-transgenic HEK293 cells or silencing tlrs genes in RAW264.7 macrophages, we 
observed that TLR2-mediated Aβ42-triggered inflammatory activation was enhanced 
by TLR1 and suppressed by TLR6. Using bone marrow chimeric Alzheimer's amyloid 
precursor transgenic mice, we observed that TLR2 deficiency in microglia shifts 
M1- to M2-inflammatory activation in vivo, which was associated with improved 
neuronal function. Our study demonstrated that TLR2 is a primary receptor for Aβ 
to trigger neuroinflammatory activation and suggested that inhibition of TLR2 in 
microglia could be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
