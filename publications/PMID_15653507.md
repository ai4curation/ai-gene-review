Upon cytokine treatment, members of the signal transducers and activators of 
transcription (STAT) family of proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine and 
serine sites within the carboxyl-terminal region in cells. We show that in 
response to cytokine treatment, Stat3 is also acetylated on a single lysine 
residue, Lys685. Histone acetyltransferase p300-mediated Stat3 acetylation on 
Lys685 was reversible by type I histone deacetylase (HDAC). Use of a prostate 
cancer cell line (PC3) that lacks Stat3 and PC3 cells expressing wild-type Stat3 
or a Stat3 mutant containing a Lys685-to-Arg substitution revealed that Lys685 
acetylation was critical for Stat3 to form stable dimers required for 
cytokine-stimulated DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, to enhance 
transcription of cell growth-related genes, and to promote cell cycle 
progression in response to treatment with oncostatin M.
