Rab7 is a small GTP-ase localized on late endosomes, which regulates late 
endocytic membrane traffic in mammalian cells. Moreover it has been shown that 
this protein has a fundamental role in the cellular vacuolation induced by the 
cytotoxin VacA of Helicobacter pylori. We report here for the first time the 
isolation of a cDNA encoding human Rab7 from a placenta cDNA library. The open 
reading frame for human Rab7 encodes a protein of 207 amino acids which exhibits 
high homology with the mouse, rat, and dog counterparts. Northern blot analysis 
of total RNAs isolated from different cell lines with a cDNA probe containing 
the entire open reading frame revealed two mRNA transcripts of 2.5 and 1.8 
kilobases. The isolation of human Rab7 cDNA will allow further characterization 
of its function in normal and pathological states.
