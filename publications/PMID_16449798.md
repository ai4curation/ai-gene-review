We have proposed that the age-associated increase of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) by electron transport chain (ETC) dysfunction may cause the elevated basal 
level of p38 MAPK stress response pathway activity. However, the mechanism by 
which ROS activates this pathway is not clear. Here we propose that activation 
of the p38 MAPK pathway by complex I (CI) generated ROS, in response to rotenone 
(ROT) treatment, is based on the ability of reduced Trx to bind to and inhibit 
ASK 1 and its release from the complex upon oxidation. This balance of free vs. 
bound ASK1 regulates the level of p38 MAPK pathway activity. To support this 
mechanism we demonstrate that the production of ROS by ROT treated AML12 
hepatocyte cells dissociates the Trx-ASK1 complex, thereby increasing p38 MAPK 
pathway activity. This mechanism is supported by the ability of N-acetyl 
cysteine (NAC) to prevent dissociation of Trx-ASK1 and activation of the p38 
MAPK pathway. We also demonstrated that the ratio of ASK1/Trx-ASK1 increases in 
aged mouse livers and that this correlates with the increased basal activity of 
the p38 MAPK pathway. The longevity of Snell dwarf mice has been attributed to 
their resistance to oxidative stress. A comparison of the levels of Trx-ASK1 in 
young and aged dwarfs showed a higher abundance of the complex than in their 
age-matched controls. These results, which are indicative of a decreased level 
of oxidative stress, suggest that increased ROS production in aged liver may 
alter the ratio of ASK1 and Trx-ASK1, thereby increasing the age-associated 
basal level of p38 MAPK pathway activity.
