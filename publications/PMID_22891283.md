Activated T cells secrete Fas ligand (FasL)-containing vesicles (secreted 
vesicles) that induce death of target cells. We provide evidence that secreted 
vesicles from culture supernatants (Csup) of various origins are able to 
generate both Fas-dependent apoptotic and Fas-independent, nonapoptotic cell 
death. In the absence of Fas, the nonapoptotic, Fas-independent pathway could 
still induce cell death. In contrast to RIP-independent classical Fas-induced 
cell death triggered by cross-linked or membrane-bound FasL, CSup-derived 
stimuli-induced apoptosis exhibited unique molecular and enzymatic 
characteristics. It could be partially inhibited by blocking cathepsin D enzyme 
activity and required the presence of RIP. Whereas stimulation with CSup, 
derived from both FasL-overexpressing Jurkat cells and PBMC, could induce cell 
death, the requirements for Fas-associated death domain protein and caspase-9 
were different between the two systems. Our study highlights an important 
distinction between cell contact-mediated and secreted vesicle-generated 
activation-induced cell death and also demonstrates that the type of the 
secreted vesicles can also modify the cell death route. We propose that besides 
cell-to-cell interaction-mediated Fas triggering, stimuli induced by secreted 
vesicles can mediate important additional cell death signals regulating 
activation-induced cell death under physiological conditions.
