Nox2/gp91(phox) (where phox is phagocyte oxidase) is the catalytic membrane 
subunit of the granulocyte NADPH oxidase complex involved in host defence. The 
current model of membrane topology of Nox2 is based upon the identification of 
glycosylation sites, of regions that interact with the regulatory cytosolic 
factors and of the epitopes recognized by antibodies. So far, the localization 
of the N-terminus of Nox2 was only speculative. In order to clarify this 
localization, we raised a polyclonal antiserum against the N-terminal sequence 
M(1)GNWVAVNEGL(11). Purified antibodies recognize the mature protein as a broad 
band at 91 kDa (glycosylated form) or a band at 55 kDa after deglycosylation. 
Immunocytochemistry and flow-cytometry analysis show a strong binding of the 
anti-N-terminal antibodies to differentiated HL60 cells and neutrophils 
respectively, after permeabilization only. The N-terminus of Nox2 is therefore 
present in the mature protein and is located to the cytoplasmic side of the 
plasma membrane.
