The SWI/SNF complex contributes to the regulation of gene expression by altering 
the chromatin structure. Depending on the context, it can be involved in either 
transcriptional activation or repression. Growing genetic and molecular evidence 
indicate that subunits of the SWI/SNF complex act as tumor suppressors in human 
and mice. Results from biochemical and transfection studies suggest also that 
SWI/SNF participates either in the inhibition or activation of several oncogenes 
and tumor suppressor genes and/or control their transcriptional activity. These 
activities provide molecular insight into the mechanism underlying SWI/SNF 
function in tumor suppression.
