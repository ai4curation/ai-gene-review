2-DE related techniques have been broadly used for protein separation and 
identification in recent years. However, many important cellular components 
often escape detection by 2-DE due to its inherent low resolution. Here we use a 
polyU-affinity column to enrich proteins with nucleotide-binding motifs. As a 
result, 26 enriched protein spots, including three new Arabidopsis RNA-binding 
proteins cp31A, cp31B, and CSP41, are identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. In the sum, 15 
protein spots encoded by 12 individual genes are observed on the 2-DE only after 
binding to the polyU-affinity column. Two of these genes are expressed at lower 
than 0.1% the level of TUB4 that were considered mainly as non-expressed genes 
in several ATH1 microarray analysis of Arabidopsis leaf samples. Our results 
suggest that polyU or similar media may be combined with 2-DE techniques to 
identify cellular proteins with extremely low transcription levels to fulfill 
specific research needs.
