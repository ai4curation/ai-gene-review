The PFTK1 gene encodes a cdc2-related serine/threonine protein kinase that has 
been shown to confer cell migratory properties in hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC). However, the prognostic value and biological mechanism by which PFTK1 
promotes HCC motility remain largely unknown. Here, we showed from tissue 
microarray that common upregulations of PFTK1 in primary HCC tumors (n=133/180) 
correlated significantly with early age onset (40 years), advance tumor grading 
and presence of microvascular invasion (P0.05). To understand downstream 
phosphorylated substrate(s) of PFTK1, phospho-proteins in PFTK1 expressing and 
knockdown Hep3B cells were profiled by two-dimensional-polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis mass spectrometric analysis. Protein identification of 
differential spots revealed β-actin (ACTB) and transgelin2 (TAGLN2) as the two 
most profound phosphorylated changes affected by PFTK1. We verified the presence 
of TAGLN2 serine phosphorylation and ACTB tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, 
reduced TAGLN2 and ACTB phosphorylations in PFTK1-suppressed Hep3B corresponded 
to distinct actin depolymerizations and marked inhibition on cell invasion and 
motility. Given that TAGLN2 is a tumor suppressor whose function has been 
ascribed in cancer metastasis, we examined if TAGLN2 is an intermediate 
substrate in the biological path of PFTK1. We showed in PFTK1-suppressed cells 
that knockdown of TAGLN2 over-rode the inhibitory effect on cell invasion and 
motility, and a recovery on actin polymerization was evident. Interestingly, we 
also found that unphosphorylated TAGLN2 in PFTK1-suppressed cells elicited 
strong actin-binding ability, a mechanism that possibly halts the actin 
cytoskeleton dynamics. Site-directed mutagenesis of TAGLN2 suggested that PFTK1 
regulates the actin-binding affinity of TAGLN2 through the S83 and S163 
residues, which if mutated can significantly affect HCC cell motility. Taken 
together, our data propose a novel, oncogene-tumor suppressor interplay, where 
oncogenic PFTK1 confers HCC cell motility through inactivating the actin-binding 
motile suppressing function of TAGLN2 via phosphorylation.
