Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) was used to investigate interactions 
between heparin and programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5), and between heparin and 
PDCD5-related peptides. Samples containing PDCD5, PDCD5-related peptides, and 
heparin at various ratios were incubated at room temperature and then separated 
by CZE with tris-acetate buffer at pH 7.2. Both qualitative and quantitative 
characterizations of the binding of PDCD5 and PDCD5-related peptides to heparin 
were determined. The changes in the signals of PDCD5 and PDCD5-related peptides 
were monitored by comparing the electropherograms of the mixtures containing 
PDCD5 and heparin and PDCD5-related peptides and heparin with that of PDCD5 or 
PDCD5-related peptides only. The binding constant of the interaction between 
PDCD5 and heparin was calculated as 4.17 x 10(4) M(-1) by Scatchard analysis. 
Our investigations show that it is possible to characterize the interaction 
between PDCD5 and heparin quantitatively and the interaction between 
PDCD5-related peptides and heparin qualitatively using CZE.
