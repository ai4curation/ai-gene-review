Bim is a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member of the BH3-only protein subgroup. 
Expression levels of Bim determine apoptosis susceptibility in non-malignant and 
in tumour cells. Bim protein expression is downregulated by proteasomal 
degradation following ERK-dependent phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Here, we 
report the identification of a deubiquitinase, Usp27x, that binds Bim upon its 
ERK-dependent phosphorylation and can upregulate its expression levels. 
Overexpression of Usp27x reduces ERK-dependent Bim ubiquitination, stabilizes 
phosphorylated Bim, and induces apoptosis in PMA-stimulated cells, as well as in 
tumour cells with a constitutively active Raf/ERK pathway. Loss of endogenous 
Usp27x enhances the Bim-degrading activity of oncogenic Raf. Overexpression of 
Usp27x induces low levels of apoptosis in melanoma and non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) cells and substantially enhances apoptosis induced in these cells 
by the inhibition of ERK signalling. Finally, deletion of Usp27x reduces 
apoptosis in NSCLC cells treated with an EGFR inhibitor. Thus, Usp27x can 
trigger via its proteolytic activity the deubiquitination of Bim and enhance its 
levels, counteracting the anti-apoptotic effects of ERK activity, and therefore 
acts as a tumour suppressor.
