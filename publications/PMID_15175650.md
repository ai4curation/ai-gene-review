The remodeling of the promoter chromatin structure is a key event for the 
induction of the PHO5 gene. Two DNA-binding proteins Pho2 and Pho4 are critical 
for this step. We found that the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex is 
essential for PHO5 transcriptional induction without affecting Pho4 
translocation upon phosphate starvation. Our data also indicate that NuA4 is 
critical for the chromatin remodeling event that occurs over the PHO5 promoter 
prior to activation. Using Chromatin IP analysis, we found that Esa1-dependent 
histone H4 acetylation at the PHO5 promoter correlates with specific recruitment 
of the NuA4 complex to this locus under repressing conditions. We demonstrate 
that the homeodomain transcriptional activator Pho2 is responsible for this 
recruitment in vivo and interacts directly with the NuA4 complex. Finally, we 
show that Pho4 is unable to bind the PHO5 promoter without prior action of NuA4. 
These results indicate that, before induction, NuA4 complex recruitment by Pho2 
is an essential event that presets the PHO5 promoter for subsequent binding by 
Pho4, chromatin remodeling and transcription.
