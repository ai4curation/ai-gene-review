The human DNA polymerase gamma (Pol γ) is responsible for DNA replication in 
mitochondria. Pol γ is particularly susceptible to inhibition by 
dideoxynucleoside-based inhibitors designed to fight viral infection. Here, we 
report crystal structures of the replicating Pol γ-DNA complex bound to either 
substrate or zalcitabine, an inhibitor used for HIV reverse transcriptase. The 
structures reveal that zalcitabine binds to the Pol γ active site almost 
identically to the substrate dCTP, providing a structural basis for Pol 
γ-mediated drug toxicity. When compared to the apo form, Pol γ undergoes intra- 
and inter-subunit conformational changes upon formation of the ternary complex 
with primer/template DNA and substrate. We also find that the accessory subunit 
Pol γB, which lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity and does not contact the 
primer/template DNA directly, serves as an allosteric regulator of holoenzyme 
activities. The structures presented here suggest a mechanism for processivity 
of the holoenzyme and provide a model for understanding the deleterious effects 
of Pol γ mutations in human disease. Crystal structures of the mitochondrial DNA 
polymerase, Pol γ, in complex with substrate or antiviral inhibitor zalcitabine 
provide a basis for understanding Pol γ-mediated drug toxicity.
