The interactions between pathogenic bacteria and extracellular matrix (ECM) 
components markedly influence the initiation and establishment of infection. We 
have identified two surface proteins of virulent Mycoplasma pneumoniae with 
molecular masses of 45 and 30 kDa that bind to the ECM constituent, fibronectin 
(Fn). These Fn-binding proteins (FnBPs) were purified to near homogeneity using 
Fn-coupled Sepharose 4B-affinity column chromatography, and amino acid sequence 
analysis of the 45 and the 30 kDa proteins identified them as elongation factor 
Tu (EF-Tu) and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 beta subunit (PDH-B) respectively. The 
genes for EF-Tu and PDH-B were cloned, and the entire EF-Tu gene and 
NH2-terminus of PDH-B (NPDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 beta subunit from amino 
acid 1-244)-B) gene were overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant 
proteins, rEF-Tu and rNPDH-B, were purified to homogeneity by His-tag affinity 
column chromatography and used to immunize rabbits. Purified rEF-Tu and rNPDH-B 
bound to Fn using a ligand immunoblot assay and ELISA. Immunogold electron 
microscopy with polyclonal antibodies reactive against rEF-Tu (antirEF-Tu) and 
rNPDH-B (antirNPDH-B) and whole cell radioimmunoprecipitation (WCRIP) revealed 
the surface location of these proteins. Adherence of viable M. pneumoniae to 
immobilized Fn was inhibited by antirEF-Tu and antirNPDH-B antisera in a 
dose-dependent and cumulative manner. These results demonstrate that M. 
pneumoniae EF-Tu and PDH-B, in addition to their major cytoplasmic biosynthetic 
and metabolic roles, can be surface translocated, which confers additional 
important biological functions.
