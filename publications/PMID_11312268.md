The RdgC/PPEF family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases is distinguished 
by the presence of C-terminal EF-hands and neuron-specific expression, including 
frequent expression in primary sensory neurons. Here we report that the sole 
Caenorhabditis elegans PPEF (CePPEF) homolog is also highly expressed in primary 
sensory neurons and is not found outside the nervous system. Neurons expressing 
CePPEF include the ciliary chemosensory neurons AWB and AWC; and within these 
neurons, CePPEF is highly enriched in the sensory cilia. In transgenic C. 
elegans and in transfected 293 cells, CePPEF is membrane-associated, and the N 
terminus of CePPEF is necessary and sufficient for this membrane association. 
[(3)H]Myristate and [(3)H]palmitate labeling studies in 293 cells demonstrated 
that this association was mediated by myristoylation at Gly(2) and 
palmitoylation at Cys(3). Introducing the G2A or C3S mutation into CePPEF 
greatly reduced membrane association in 293 cells and in transgenic nematodes. A 
recombinant C-terminal fragment of CePPEF containing two putative EF-hands bound 
between one and two Ca(2+) ions/protein, and mutation of residues presumed to 
ligand calcium in the two putative EF-hands led to diminished calcium binding. 
These results establish the first direct evidence for fatty acylation and 
calcium binding of a PPEF family member and demonstrate a remarkable 
conservation of sensory neuron expression among the members of this distinctive 
family of protein phosphatases.
