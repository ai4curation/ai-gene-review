In the developing brain, the organization of the neuroepithelium is maintained 
by a critical balance between proliferation and cell-cell adhesion of neural 
progenitor cells. The molecular mechanisms that underlie this are still largely 
unknown. Here, through analysis of a conditional knockout mouse for the Kap3 
gene, we show that post-Golgi transport of N-cadherin by the KIF3 molecular 
motor complex is crucial for maintaining this balance. N-cadherin and 
beta-catenin associate with the KIF3 complex by co-immunoprecipitation, and 
colocalize with KIF3 in cells. Furthermore, in KAP3-deficient cells, the 
subcellular localization of N-cadherin was disrupted. Taken together, these 
results suggest a potential tumour-suppressing activity for this molecular 
motor.
