Misfolded proteins are eliminated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by 
retrotranslocation into the cytosol, a pathway hijacked by certain viruses to 
destroy MHC class I heavy chains. The translocation of polypeptides across the 
ER membrane requires their polyubiquitination and subsequent extraction from the 
membrane by the p97 ATPase [also called valosin-containing protein (VCP) or, in 
yeast, Cdc48]. In higher eukaryotes, p97 is bound to the ER membrane by a 
membrane protein complex containing Derlin-1 and VCP-interacting membrane 
protein (VIMP). How the ubiquitination machinery is recruited to the 
p97/Derlin/VIMP complex is unclear. Here, we report that p97 interacts directly 
with several ubiquitin ligases and facilitates their recruitment to Derlin-1. 
During retrotranslocation, a substrate first interacts with Derlin-1 before p97 
and other factors join the complex. These data, together with the fact that 
Derlin-1 is a multispanning membrane protein forming homo-oligomers, support the 
idea that Derlin-1 is part of a retrotranslocation channel that is associated 
with both the polyubiquitination and p97-ATPase machineries.
