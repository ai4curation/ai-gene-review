Members of the P(4) subfamily of P-type ATPases catalyze phospholipid transport 
and create membrane lipid asymmetry in late secretory and endocytic 
compartments. P-type ATPases usually pump small cations and the transport 
mechanism involved appears conserved throughout the family. How this mechanism 
is adapted to flip phospholipids remains to be established. P(4)-ATPases form 
heteromeric complexes with CDC50 proteins. Dissociation of the yeast P(4)-ATPase 
Drs2p from its binding partner Cdc50p disrupts catalytic activity (Lenoir, G., 
Williamson, P., Puts, C. F., and Holthuis, J. C. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 
17956-17967), suggesting that CDC50 subunits play an intimate role in the 
mechanism of transport by P(4)-ATPases. The human genome encodes 14 P(4)-ATPases 
while only three human CDC50 homologues have been identified. This implies that 
each human CDC50 protein interacts with multiple P(4)-ATPases or, alternatively, 
that some human P(4)-ATPases function without a CDC50 binding partner. Here we 
show that human CDC50 proteins each bind multiple class-1 P(4)-ATPases, and that 
in all cases examined, association with a CDC50 subunit is required for 
P(4)-ATPase export from the ER. Moreover, we find that phosphorylation of the 
catalytically important Asp residue in human P(4)-ATPases ATP8B1 and ATP8B2 is 
critically dependent on their CDC50 subunit. These results indicate that CDC50 
proteins are integral part of the P(4)-ATPase flippase machinery.
