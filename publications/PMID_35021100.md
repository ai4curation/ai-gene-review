Understanding the homeostatic mechanism of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) 
cells is a critical issue in iNKT cell biology. Because interleukin (IL)-15 is 
required for the thymic generation of iNKT cells, IL-15 has also been considered 
necessary for the homeostasis of peripheral iNKT cells. Here, we delineated the 
in vivo cytokine requirement for iNKT cells, and we came to the surprising 
conclusion that IL-7, not IL-15, is the homeostatic cytokine for iNKT cells. 
Employing a series of experimental mouse models where the availability of IL-7 
or IL-15 was manipulated in peripheral tissues, either by genetic tools or by 
adult thymectomy and cytokine pump installation, we demonstrate that the 
abundance of IL-7, and not IL-15, limits the size of the peripheral iNKT cell 
pool. These results redefine the cytokine requirement for iNKT cells and 
indicate competition for IL-7 between iNKT and conventional αβ T cells.
