The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is over-expressed in a variety of 
human cancers. Downstream signalling of this receptor is tightly regulated both 
spatially and temporally by controlling its internalization and subsequent 
degradation. Internalization of the EGFR requires dynamin 2 (Dyn2), a large 
GTPase that deforms lipid bilayers, leading to vesicle scission. The adaptor 
protein CIN85 (cbl-interacting protein of 85 kDa), which has been proposed to 
indirectly link the EGFR to the endocytic machinery at the plasma membrane, is 
also thought to be involved in receptor internalization. Here, we report a novel 
and direct interaction between Dyn2 and CIN85 that is induced by EGFR 
stimulation and, most surprisingly, occurs late in the endocytic process. 
Importantly, disruption of the CIN85-Dyn2 interaction results in accumulation of 
internalized EGFR in late endosomes that become aberrantly elongated into 
distended tubules. Consistent with the accumulation of this receptor is a 
sustention of downstream signalling cascades. These findings provide novel 
insights into a previously unknown protein complex that can regulate EGFR 
traffic at very late stages of the endocytic pathway.
