The caspase-recruitment domain-containing adaptor protein CARD9 regulates the 
innate signaling responses to fungal infection. Here we show that CARD9 is 
required for innate immune responses against intracellular pathogens. We 
generated Card9(-/-) mice and found that CARD9-deficient macrophages had defects 
in activation of the kinases p38 and Jnk but not of transcription factor 
NF-kappaB after bacterial and viral infection. CARD9-deficient mice failed to 
clear infection and showed altered cytokine production after challenge with 
Listeria monocytogenes. In wild-type cells, we found CARD9 inducibly associated 
with both the intracellular 'biosensor' Nod2 and the serine-threonine kinase 
RICK. Our data demonstrate that CARD9 has a critical function in Nod2-mediated 
activation of p38 and Jnk in innate immune responses to intracellular pathogens.
