Mutations in LRRK2 are one of the primary genetic causes of Parkinson's disease 
(PD). LRRK2 contains a kinase and a GTPase domain, and familial PD mutations 
affect both enzymatic activities. However, the signaling mechanisms regulating 
LRRK2 and the pathogenic effects of familial mutations remain unknown. 
Identifying the signaling proteins that regulate LRRK2 function and toxicity 
remains a critical goal for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. 
In this study, we apply systems biology tools to human PD brain and blood 
transcriptomes to reverse-engineer a LRRK2-centered gene regulatory network. 
This network identifies several putative master regulators of LRRK2 function. In 
particular, the signaling gene RGS2, which encodes for a GTPase-activating 
protein (GAP), is a key regulatory hub connecting the familial PD-associated 
genes DJ-1 and PINK1 with LRRK2 in the network. RGS2 expression levels are 
reduced in the striata of LRRK2 and sporadic PD patients. We identify RGS2 as a 
novel interacting partner of LRRK2 in vivo. RGS2 regulates both the GTPase and 
kinase activities of LRRK2. We show in mammalian neurons that RGS2 regulates 
LRRK2 function in the control of neuronal process length. RGS2 is also 
protective against neuronal toxicity of the most prevalent mutation in LRRK2, 
G2019S. We find that RGS2 regulates LRRK2 function and neuronal toxicity through 
its effects on kinase activity and independently of GTPase activity, which 
reveals a novel mode of action for GAP proteins. This work identifies RGS2 as a 
promising target for interfering with neurodegeneration due to LRRK2 mutations 
in PD patients.
