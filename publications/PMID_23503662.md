The cryptochrome (CRY) flavoproteins act as blue-light receptors in plants and 
insects, but perform light-independent functions at the core of the mammalian 
circadian clock. To drive clock oscillations, mammalian CRYs associate with the 
Period proteins (PERs) and together inhibit the transcription of their own 
genes. The SCF(FBXL3) ubiquitin ligase complex controls this negative feedback 
loop by promoting CRY ubiquitination and degradation. However, the molecular 
mechanisms of their interactions and the functional role of flavin adenine 
dinucleotide (FAD) binding in CRYs remain poorly understood. Here we report 
crystal structures of mammalian CRY2 in its apo, FAD-bound and 
FBXL3-SKP1-complexed forms. Distinct from other cryptochromes of known 
structures, mammalian CRY2 binds FAD dynamically with an open cofactor pocket. 
Notably, the F-box protein FBXL3 captures CRY2 by simultaneously occupying its 
FAD-binding pocket with a conserved carboxy-terminal tail and burying its 
PER-binding interface. This novel F-box-protein-substrate bipartite interaction 
is susceptible to disruption by both FAD and PERs, suggesting a new avenue for 
pharmacological targeting of the complex and a multifaceted regulatory mechanism 
of CRY ubiquitination.
