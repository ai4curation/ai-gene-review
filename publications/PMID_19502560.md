Omi/HtrA2 is a mitochondrial serine protease that has a dual function: while 
confined in the mitochondria, it promotes cell survival, but when released into 
the cytoplasm, it participates in caspase-dependent as well as 
caspase-independent cell death. To investigate the mechanism of Omi/HtrA2's 
function, we set out to isolate and characterize novel substrates for this 
protease. We have identified Thanatos-associated protein 5 (THAP5) as a specific 
interactor and substrate of Omi/HtrA2 in cells undergoing apoptosis. This 
protein is an uncharacterized member of the THAP family of proteins. THAP5 has a 
unique pattern of expression and is found predominantly in the human heart, 
although a very low expression is also seen in the human brain and muscle. THAP5 
protein is localized in the nucleus and, when ectopically expressed, induces 
cell cycle arrest. During apoptosis, THAP5 protein is degraded, and this process 
can be blocked using a specific Omi/HtrA2 inhibitor, leading to reduced cell 
death. In patients with coronary artery disease, THAP5 protein levels 
substantially decrease in the myocardial infarction area, suggesting a potential 
role of this protein in human heart disease. This work identifies human THAP5 as 
a cardiac-specific nuclear protein that controls cell cycle progression. 
Furthermore, during apoptosis, THAP5 is cleaved and removed by the proapoptotic 
Omi/HtrA2 protease. Taken together, we provide evidence to support that THAP5 
and its regulation by Omi/HtrA2 provide a new link between cell cycle control 
and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.

DISCUSSION

Omi/HtrA2 is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protease that has homology to bacterial HtrA chaperones ( 17 , 27 , 43 ). Recent evidence suggests that Omi/HtrA2 has two distinct functions, both requiring its protease activity. Omi/HtrA2 can be a proapoptotic protein, as well as a prosurvival factor, depending on its subcellular location. The prosurvival function of Omi/HtrA2 was based on studies on motor neuron degeneration 2 ( mnd2 ) mice that carry a single mutation affecting the proteolytic activity of Omi/HtrA2 ( 25 ). Mnd2 homozygous animals suffer muscle wasting, neurodegeneration, and die by 6 wk of age. Based on these studies, it is assumed that the primary function (physiological function) of Omi/HtrA2 in mammalian cells is to somehow maintain mitochondrial homeostasis necessary for cell survival ( 25 , 35 ). The other function of Omi/HtrA2 (pathological function) becomes operational only under conditions leading to cell death, where Omi/HtrA2 is released to the cytoplasm as a proapoptotic protein and participates in caspase-dependent as well as caspase-independent apoptosis ( 21 , 45 , 50 ). Most of the studies reported so far have provided significant new information on the mechanism of Omi/HtrA2's proapoptotic function, but little if anything on its prosurvival function is known. Omi/HtrA2, when released to the cytoplasm, binds and degrades several substrates, including inhibitors of apoptosis protein, PEA/PED, and Apollon/Bruce ( 41 , 44 , 47 , 51 ). Some of these proteins are clearly antiapoptotic factors, and their removal by Omi/HtrA2 can undoubtedly accelerate cell death. Others have a more obscure function, and their association and cleavage by Omi/HtrA2, in the context of inducing cell death, is more difficult to justify. In the present study, we report the characterization of THAP5, the fifth member of the THAP family of proteins, as a specific interactor and substrate of Omi/HtrA2 protease. THAP proteins comprise a recently described family of cellular factors with unique structural and functional characteristics. They are defined by the presence of the THAP domain, an atypical zinc-dependent DNA-binding domain of ∼90 amino acids. There are 113 THAP proteins listed in the databases, and in humans there are 12 distinct proteins (THAP0-THAP11) ( 40 ). All 12 human THAP proteins have a single THAP domain at their amino terminus. In Drosophila, there are 7 THAP proteins, 2 of which contain more than 1 THAP domain, CG14860 has 2 THAP domains, and the CG10631 is predicted to have as many as 27 THAP domains ( 40 ). THAP domains are unique as DNA binding motifs due to a significant similarity with the DNA binding domain of Drosophila P element transposase. This similarity includes the size of the THAP domain, its location in the protein, and the conservation in the number and residues that define the domain ( 40 ). THAP0, also known as the death-associated protein DAP4/p52rIPK, was identified as one of the genes induced by IFN-γ-mediated apoptosis and in an independent study, as an interactor of protein kinase R ( 14 , 18 ). THAP1 was originally defined as a proapoptotic nuclear factor localized at the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies and interacting with prostate apoptosis response-4 protein ( 39 ). Since very little is known about THAP5, we embarked on a detailed study, beginning with its expression. In human tissues, THAP5 mRNA is predominantly expressed in the human heart, although low expression is also detected in skeletal muscle and brain. More significantly, we found no orthologs for THAP5 in mouse ( Mus musculus ) or rat ( Rattus norvegicus ). The closest orthologs were detected in Macaca fascicularis, Bos taurus , and Gallus gallus . The absence of orthologs in mouse and rat has also been reported for four other members of the THAP family, the THAP6, THAP8, THAP9, and THAP10 proteins ( 37 ). It was suggested that some THAP genes might have originated from a domestication event of a single copy of P element transposase that took place in the human lineage after it had diverged from the rodent lineage ( 38 ). Alternatively, THAP gene domestication might have occurred earlier in the evolution, but was later lost in the lineage leading to rodents ( 38 ).

To verify that THAP5 is a bona fide human protein, we raised a polyclonal antibody against the unique part of the protein (aa163-395) that does not include the THAP domain. This polyclonal antibody clearly recognized a specific band of 50 kDa, corresponding to THAP5 in human heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. The THAP5 antibody did not detect any specific protein bands when tested against various mouse or rat tissue extracts (results not shown).

To investigate the subcellular localization of THAP5, we expressed the full-length protein fused to GFP in HeLa cells. The fusion protein, GFP-THAP5, shows exclusive nuclear localization but is excluded from the nucleoli. The amino terminus of the protein that includes the THAP5 domain is responsible for its nuclear localization. This is the part of the protein implicated in DNA binding, as well as protein-protein interactions ( 32 ). We also stained HeLa cells for endogenous THAP5 protein using our THAP5 antibody. In this experiment, the THAP5 protein was found to be exclusively located in the nucleus (results not shown). The interaction with Omi/HtrA2 is mediated by the carboxy terminus of THAP5 that binds the PDZ domain of Omi/HtrA2. The carboxy terminus of THAP5 has the amino acid sequence EVTMI* that conforms to the consensus sequence for PDZ (Omi) binding proteins ( 26 , 36 ).

Previous studies have shown two members of the same family, THAP1 and THAP11, can regulate cell proliferation ( 6 , 52 ). Furthermore, genetic studies using C. elegans support a role of THAP proteins in cell cycle regulation. These studies demonstrated a genetic interaction between LIN-35/Rb, which is the C. elegans retinoblastoma homolog, and four C. elegans THAP proteins, LIN-36, LIN-15B, LIN-15A, and HIM-17. LIN-36 and LIN-15B are known inhibitors of G1/S cell cycle transition ( 4 , 5 , 11 , 12 , 23 , 46 ). Also, in zebrafish the ortholog of the cell cycle transcription factor E2F6 has a THAP domain and functions as a repressor of E2-F-dependent transcription during S phase ( 20 ). Based on these reports, we decided to investigate if THAP5 plays any role in the regulation of cell cycle.

For these studies, we ectopically expressed GFP-THAP5 in HEK-293. This cell line expresses endogenous THAP5 protein and can be transfected with high efficiency. The results from these experiments clearly show that GFP-THAP5 had a dramatic effect, blocking the progression of transfected cells through the cell cycle and causing high accumulation of cells at the G2/M phase. The effect of THAP5 overexpression is not unique to HEK-293 cells, and similar experiments performed in HeLa cells also caused arrest at G2/M phase. The mechanism by which THAP5 inhibits cell cycle is not known, and it most likely will involve the direct regulation of cell cycle genes. THAP5 has an atypical zinc finger domain at its amino terminus that could bind to specific DNA sequences on different promoters. A recent study showed that another member of the same family, THAP11, could inhibit cell cycle by binding to the promoter of c-Myc and downregulating its expression ( 52 ).

To investigate the role of the THAP5-Omi/HtrA2 interaction during apoptosis, HeLa cells that normally express THAP5 were treated with various chemicals to induce cell death. Under these conditions, Omi/HtrA2 is released from mitochondria and becomes a proapoptotic protein. In these experiments, the THAP5 protein was cleaved in cells treated with cisplatin or H 2 O 2 , and the degree of THAP5 degradation increased proportionally with the rate of apoptosis in the cell population. No significant cleavage of THAP5 was seen in cells treated with etoposide and camptothecin, but these chemicals also caused minimal cell death in this protocol and cell line used for these experiments.

We used a specific inhibitor to show that Omi/HtrA2 is responsible for THAP5 degradation. This inhibitor, ucf-101, was developed in our laboratory and has been extensively studied in various systems of cell death ( 8 , 9 , 30 ). When the ucf-101 inhibitor was used, it clearly blocked THAP5 cleavage and protected cells from apoptosis.

THAP5 is hyperexpressed in the human heart, but there are no rodent orthologs, therefore limiting the type of studies that can be done to investigate its potential involvement in the development or progression of heart disease. We obtained small tissue samples from patients with several human heart diseases, including CAD and DCM. In CAD patients, we were able to detect a decrease in the THAP5 protein level in the MI area compared with RZ or BZ areas of the same heart. These results, although preliminary, suggest that, during pathological conditions resulting in myocardial cell death, such as MI, the THAP5 protein decreases significantly in areas of the heart that sustain maximum cell damage. There was no difference in THAP5 protein levels in DCM patients compared with normal (donor) heart. Previous studies have shown that Omi/HtrA2 is a key player in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury ( 2 ). Furthermore, inhibition of the proteolytic activity of Omi/HtrA2 using the ucf-101 inhibitor improved postischemic myocardial function and reduction of the myocardial infarct size ( 2 , 3 , 30 ). THAP5 is the first human, heart-specific substrate of Omi/HtrA2 identified thus far. Under normal, physiological conditions, THAP5 functions as an inhibitor of cell cycle. This dual function of THAP5 supports previous studies that have shown the existence of a cross talk between cell cycle control and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. For example, overexpression of the cell cycle inhibitor p57 kip2 in cardiomyocytes was shown to attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury in the mouse heart ( 19 ). In another study, cyclin A/cdk2 activation was involved in hypoxia-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes ( 1 ). The hyperexpression of THAP5 in human heart and its regulation during cell death by Omi/HtrA2 suggest that this pathway plays a significant role in the normal function of the heart. Furthermore, THAP5 might be involved in the development and progression of heart disease, especially in CAD.
