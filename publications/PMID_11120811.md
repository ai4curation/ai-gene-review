c-Abl is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that we have recently linked to growth 
factor receptor signaling. The c-Abl kinase is ubiquitously expressed and 
localizes to the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, cytoskeleton, and nucleus. Thus, 
c-Abl may regulate signaling processes in multiple subcellular compartments. 
Targeted deletion or mutation of c-Abl in mice results in a variety of 
phenotypes, including splenic and thymic atrophy and lymphopenia. Additionally, 
lymphocytes isolated from specific compartments of c-Abl mutant mice have 
reduced responses to a variety of stimuli and an increased susceptibility to 
apoptosis following growth factor deprivation. Despite these observations, 
little is known regarding the signaling mechanisms responsible for these 
phenotypes. We report here that splenic B cells from c-Abl-deficient mice are 
hyporesponsive to the proliferative effects of B cell Ag receptor (BCR) 
stimulation. The c-Abl kinase activity and protein levels are elevated in the 
cytosol following activation of the BCR in B cell lines. We show that c-Abl 
associates with and phosphorylates the BCR coreceptor CD19, and that c-Abl and 
CD19 colocalize in lipid membrane rafts. These data suggest a role for c-Abl in 
the regulation of B cell proliferation downstream of the BCR, possibly through 
interactions with CD19.
