The adaptor protein Shc contains a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain and a 
Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, both of which are known to interact with 
phosphorylated tyrosines. We have shown previously that tyrosine 1148 of the 
activated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is a major binding site for Shc 
while tyrosine 1173 is a secondary binding site in intact cells. In the present 
study, we investigated the interaction between the PTB and SH2 domains of Shc 
and the activated human EGF receptor. Mutant 52-kDa Shc with an 
arginine-to-lysine substitution at residue 175 in the PTB domain (Shc R175K) or 
397 in the SH2 domain (Shc R397K) was coexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells 
overexpressing the wild-type or mutant EGF receptors that retained only one of 
the autophosphorylation sites at tyrosine 1148 (QM1148) or 1173 (QM1173). Shc 
R397K was coprecipitated with the QM1148 and QM1173 receptors, was 
tyrosine-phosphorylated, and associated with Grb2 and Sos. In contrast, 
coprecipitation of Shc R175K with the mutant receptors was barely detectable. In 
cells expressing the QM1173 receptor, Shc R175K was tyrosine-phosphorylated and 
associated with Grb2, while association of Sos was barely detectable. In cells 
expressing the QM1148 receptor, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc R175K was 
markedly reduced. When both Shc R175K and 46-kDa Shc R397K were coexpressed with 
the mutant receptors, p46 Shc R397K was dominantly tyrosine-phosphorylated. In 
cells expressing the wild-type receptor, Shc R397K, but not Shc R175K, 
translocated to the membrane in an EGF-dependent manner. In addition, Ras 
activity stimulated by the immunoprecipitates of Shc R397K was significantly 
higher than that by the immunoprecipitates of Shc R175K. The present results 
indicate that tyrosine 1148 of the activated EGF receptor mainly interacts with 
the Shc PTB domain in intact cells. Tyrosine 1173 interacts with both the PTB 
and SH2 domains, although the interaction with the PTB domain is dominant. In 
addition, Shc bound to the activated EGF receptor via the PTB domain dominantly 
interacts with Grb2-Sos complex and plays a major role in the Ras-signaling 
pathway.
