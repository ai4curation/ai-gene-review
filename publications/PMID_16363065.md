Melanocytes and keratinocytes were analyzed for potential roles of p53, p73, and 
p63 tumor suppressor family proteins and of malignancy-specific gene expression 
changes in the etiology of multi-step cancer. Melanocytes expressed 
deltaNp73alpha, two p63 isoforms and p53. Although p21 and Noxa mRNA levels 
increased following DNA damage, p53 family member binding to p21 and Noxa DNA 
probes was undetectable, suggesting p53 family-independent responses. In 
contrast, keratinocytes expressed multiple isoforms each of p73 and p63 that 
were induced to bind p21 and Noxa DNA probes after ionizing (IR) or after 
ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation, correlating with p21 and Noxa mRNA induction 
and with apoptosis. Interestingly, IR-resistant malignant melanocytes and 
keratinocytes both exhibited Noxa mRNA induction after UVB treatment, 
correlating with DNA binding of p53 family proteins to the Noxa probe only in 
keratinocytes. To uncover other malignancy-specific events, we queried mouse 
initiated keratinocyte clones for early changes that were exacerbated in 
malignant derivatives and also differentially expressed in human advanced 
melanoma versus normal melanocytes. Using a new method for ranking and 
normalization of microarray data for 5000 probe sets, 27 upregulated and 13 
downregulated genes satisfied our query. Of these, the majority was associated 
with late-stage human cancers and six were novel genes. Thus, clonal lineage 
mouse models representing early through late cancer progression stages may 
inform the focus on early, potentially causal events from microarray studies of 
human cancers, facilitating prognosis and molecular therapy.
