Unlike the catalytic alpha-subunit, the beta-subunit of heterodimeric 
(alphabeta)2 phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) has no invariant functional 
amino acids directly involved in the aminoacylation process as it is evident 
from the crystal structure of the T. thermophilus enzyme complexed with tRNAPhe. 
Having no catalytic function, the prokaryotic beta-subunit comprises OB-, RNP-, 
SH3-, and DNA-binding-like domains involved in a variety of biological functions 
in other proteins. It was shown that the mRNA of the human alpha-subunit 
overexpressed in the tumorigenic versus the nontumorigenic variant of the same 
acute-phase chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (CML). We cloned, sequenced, and 
expressed human PheRS. The layout of the human sequence indicates that the 
general tRNA binding mode and anticodon recognition differ between prokaryotes 
and eukaryotes for the phenylalanine system. Northern blot hybridization 
analysis from malignant and normal human tissues enabled us to assess the 
relative expression levels of the alpha- and beta-subunits independently, in 
view of the additional cellular role proposed for the beta-subunit in 
tumorigenic events. The levels of mRNA corresponding to the alpha- and 
beta-subunits were remarkably similar in all cell types and tissues examined, 
thus indicating the implication of the entire (alphabeta)2 heterodimer in 
tumorigenic events.
