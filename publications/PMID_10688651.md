Etk (also called Bmx) is a member of the Btk tyrosine kinase family and is 
expressed in a variety of hematopoietic, epithelial, and endothelial cells. We 
have explored biological functions, regulators, and effectors of Etk. 
Coexpression of v-Src and Etk led to a transphosphorylation on tyrosine 566 of 
Etk and subsequent autophosphorylation. These events correlated with a 
substantial increase in the kinase activity of Etk. STAT3, which was previously 
shown to be activated by Etk, associated with Etk in vivo. To investigate 
whether Etk could mediate v-Src-induced activation of STAT3 and cell 
transformation, we overexpressed a dominant-negative mutant of Etk in an 
immortalized, untransformed rat liver epithelial cell line, WB, which contains 
endogenous Etk. Dominant-negative inactivation of Etk not only blocked 
v-Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 but also caused a 
great reduction in the transforming activity of v-Src. In NIH3T3 cells, although 
Etk did not itself induce transformation, it effectively enhanced the 
transforming ability of a partially active c-Src mutant (c-Src378G). 
Furthermore, Etk activated STAT3-mediated gene expression in synergy with this 
Src mutant. Our findings thus indicate that Etk is a critical mediator of 
Src-induced cell transformation and STAT3 activation. The role of STAT3 in 
Etk-mediated transformation was also examined. Expression of Etk in a human 
hepatoma cell line Hep3B resulted in a significant increase in its transforming 
ability, and this effect was abrogated by dominant-negative inhibition of STAT3. 
These data strongly suggest that Etk links Src to STAT3 activation. Furthermore, 
Src-Etk-STAT3 is an important pathway in cellular transformation.
