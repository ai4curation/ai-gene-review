Retinoic acid influences epidermal morphology and function through its ability 
to control transcription. Because the circulation presents the epidermis with 
micromolar amounts of retinol that can be converted to retinoic acid, regulating 
retinol access is imperative. In keratinocytes the majority of retinol is 
sequestered as long chain fatty acid esters. Although much has been learned 
about the major esterifying enzyme, little is known about the hydrolase that 
accesses retinol from its storage depot. Murine carboxylesterases and hormone 
sensitive lipase have been shown to have this activity. We found that their in 
vitro sensitivity to bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (BNPP), however, was not shared 
by the epidermal hydrolase activity. We therefore produced and screened two 
keratinocyte cDNA expression libraries and identified a previously sequenced 
gene (GS2) as a keratinocyte retinyl ester (RE) hydrolase insensitive to BNPP. 
The enzyme also catalyzes fattyacyl CoA-dependent and -independent retinol 
esterification. The hydrolysis reaction is greater at neutral pH, whereas the 
esterification reaction is greater at acidic pH. These activities are consistent 
with the increased RE content that accompanies epidermal maturation. In 
addition, this enzyme utilizes triolein as substrate and generates 
diacylglyceride and free fatty acid.
