Although 5-methylcytosine (m5C) is a widespread modification in RNAs, its 
regulation and biological role in pathological conditions (such as cancer) 
remain unknown. Here, we provide the single-nucleotide resolution landscape of 
messenger RNA m5C modifications in human urothelial carcinoma of the bladder 
(UCB). We identify numerous oncogene RNAs with hypermethylated m5C sites 
causally linked to their upregulation in UCBs and further demonstrate YBX1 as an 
m5C 'reader' recognizing m5C-modified mRNAs through the indole ring of W65 in 
its cold-shock domain. YBX1 maintains the stability of its target mRNA by 
recruiting ELAVL1. Moreover, NSUN2 and YBX1 are demonstrated to drive UCB 
pathogenesis by targeting the m5C methylation site in the HDGF 3' untranslated 
region. Clinically, a high coexpression of NUSN2, YBX1 and HDGF predicts the 
poorest survival. Our findings reveal an unprecedented mechanism of RNA 
m5C-regulated oncogene activation, providing a potential therapeutic strategy 
for UCB.
