PURPOSE: SOX9 is an important transcription factor required for development and 
has been implicated in several types of cancer. However, SOX9 has never been 
linked to lung cancer to date. Here, we show that SOX9 expression is upregulated 
in lung adenocarcinoma and show how it is associated with cancer cell growth.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Data mining with five microarray data sets containing 490 
clinical samples, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR validation assay in 57 
independent samples, and immunohistochemistry assay with tissue microarrays 
containing 170 lung tissue cores were used to profile SOX9 mRNA and protein 
expression. Short interference RNA suppression of SOX9 in cell lines was used to 
scrutinize functional role(s) of SOX9 and associated molecular mechanisms.
RESULTS: SOX9 mRNA and protein were consistently overexpressed in the majority 
of lung adenocarcinoma. Knockdown of SOX9 in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines 
resulted in marked decrease of adhesive and anchorage-independent growth in 
concordance with the upregulation of p21 (CDKN1A) and downregulation of CDK4. In 
agreement with higher SOX9 expression level in lung adenocarcinoma, the p21 mRNA 
level was significantly lower in tumors than that in normal tissues, whereas the 
opposite was true for CDK4, supporting the notion that SOX9 negatively and 
positively regulated p21 and CDK4, respectively. Finally, whereas SOX9-knockdown 
cells showed significantly attenuated tumorigenicity in mice, SOX9 transfectants 
consistently showed markedly stronger tumorigenicity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that SOX9 is a new hallmark of lung 
adenocarcinoma, in which SOX9 might contribute to gain of tumor growth 
potential, possibly acting through affecting the expression of cell cycle 
regulators p21 and CDK4.
