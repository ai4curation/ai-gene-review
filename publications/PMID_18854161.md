Coordinated interactions between microtubule (MT) and actin cytoskeletons are 
involved in many polarized cellular processes. Spectraplakins are enormous (>500 
kDa) proteins able to bind both MTs and actin filaments (F-actin) directly. To 
elucidate the physiological significance and functions of mammalian 
spectraplakin ACF7, we've conditionally targeted it in skin epidermis. 
Intriguingly, ACF7 deficiency compromises the targeting of microtubules along 
F-actin to focal adhesions (FAs), stabilizes FA-actin networks, and impairs 
epidermal migration. Exploring underlying mechanisms, we show that ACF7's 
binding domains for F-actin, MTs, and MT plus-end proteins are not sufficient to 
rescue the defects in FA-cytoskeletal dynamics and migration functions of ACF7 
null keratinocytes. We've uncovered an intrinsic actin-regulated ATPase domain 
in ACF7 and demonstrate that it is both functional and essential for these 
roles. Our findings provide insight into the functions of this important 
cytoskeletal crosslinking protein in regulating dynamic interactions between MTs 
and F-actin to sustain directional cell movement.
