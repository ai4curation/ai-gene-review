Ligand-induced down-regulation controls the signaling potency of the epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1). Overexpression studies have identified 
Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation of EGFR as a mechanism of ligand-induced EGFR 
down-regulation. However, the role of endogenous Cbl in EGFR down-regulation and 
the precise step in the endocytic pathway regulated by Cbl remain unclear. Using 
Cbl-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines, we demonstrate that endogenous Cbl 
is essential for ligand-induced ubiquitinylation and efficient degradation of 
EGFR. Further analyses using Chinese hamster ovary cells with a 
temperature-sensitive defect in ubiquitinylation confirm a crucial role of the 
ubiquitin machinery in Cbl-mediated EGFR degradation. However, internalization 
into early endosomes did not require Cbl function or an intact ubiquitin 
pathway. Confocal immunolocalization studies indicated that Cbl-dependent 
ubiquitinylation plays a critical role at the early endosome to late 
endosome/lysosome sorting step of EGFR down-regulation. These findings establish 
Cbl as the major endogenous ubiquitin ligase responsible for EGFR degradation, 
and show that the critical role of Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation is at the level 
of endosomal sorting, rather than at the level of internalization.
