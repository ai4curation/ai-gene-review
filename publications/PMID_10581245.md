Calreticulin (CRT) is thought to be a molecular chaperone that interacts with 
glycoproteins exclusively through a lectin site specific for monoglucosylated 
oligosaccharides. However, this chaperone function has never been directly 
demonstrated nor is it clear how lectin-oligosaccharide interactions facilitate 
glycoprotein folding. Using purified components, we show that CRT suppresses the 
aggregation not only of a glycoprotein bearing monoglucosylated oligosaccharides 
but also that of non-glycosylated proteins. Furthermore, CRT forms stable 
complexes with unfolded, non-glycosylated substrates but does not associate with 
native proteins. ATP and Zn(2+) enhance CRT's ability to suppress aggregation of 
non- glycoproteins, whereas engagement of its lectin site with purified 
oligosaccharide attenuates this function. CRT also confers protection against 
thermal inactivation and maintains substrates in a folding-competent state. We 
conclude that in addition to being a lectin CRT possesses a polypeptide binding 
capacity capable of discriminating between protein conformational states and 
that it functions in vitro as a classical molecular chaperone.
