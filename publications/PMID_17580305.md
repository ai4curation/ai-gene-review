The RNA-binding protein TIA-1 (T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1) 
functions in regulating post-transcriptional mechanisms, including precursor 
mRNA (pre-mRNA) alternative splicing and mRNA translation. Utilizing a mini-gene 
consisting of part of the type II procollagen gene (COL2A1), we show that TIA-1 
interacts with a conserved AU-rich cis element in COL2A1 intron 2 and modulates 
alternative splicing of exon 2. This unique, highly conserved cis element 
containing stem-loop secondary structure was previously identified in our 
laboratory as an essential motif that controls the developmentally regulated 
exon 2 splicing switch during chondrogenesis (McAlinden, A., Havlioglu, N., 
Liang, L., Davies, S. R., and Sandell, L. J. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 
32700-32711). In vivo binding of endogenous TIA-1 to the AU-rich cis element in 
COL2A1 pre-mRNA was confirmed by the ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation 
assay. Importantly, we also show that TIA-1 interacts with the equivalent DNA 
sequence with a preference for single-stranded rather than double-stranded DNA. 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (including an additional RNase step) 
confirmed this interaction in vivo. Competition assays showed that TIA-1 
apparently binds with higher affinity to DNA than to RNA. Finally, we show that 
this strong DNA-TIA-1 interaction can be disrupted by an RNA polymerase during 
active transcription. This suggests a potentially novel, dual role for TIA-1 in 
shuttling between DNA and RNA ligands to co-regulate COL2A1 expression at the 
level of transcription and pre-mRNA alternative splicing.
