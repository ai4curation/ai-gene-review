Microtubule-associated proteins of the mitotic spindle are thought to be 
important for the initial assembly and the maintenance of spindle structure and 
function. However, distinguishing assembly and maintenance roles for a given 
protein is difficult. Most experimental methods for protein inactivation are 
slow and therefore affect both assembly and maintenance. Here, we have used 
'knocksideways' to rapidly (∼5 minutes) and specifically remove 
TACC3-ch-TOG-clathrin non-motor complexes from kinetochore fibers (K-fibers). 
This method allows the complex to be inactivated at defined stages of mitosis. 
Removal of TACC3-ch-TOG-clathrin after nuclear envelope breakdown caused severe 
delays in chromosome alignment. Inactivation at metaphase, following a normal 
prometaphase, significantly delayed progression to anaphase. In these cells, 
K-fiber tension was reduced and the spindle checkpoint was not satisfied. 
Surprisingly, there was no significant loss of K-fiber microtubules, even after 
prolonged removal. TACC3-ch-TOG-clathrin removal during metaphase also resulted 
in a decrease in spindle length and significant alteration in kinetochore 
dynamics. Our results indicate that TACC3-ch-TOG-clathrin complexes are 
important for the maintenance of spindle structure and function as well as for 
initial spindle assembly.
