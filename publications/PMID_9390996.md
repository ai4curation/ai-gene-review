beta-Amyloid precursor protein (betaPP) can reside at neuron and glial cell 
surfaces or undergo proteolytic processing into secreted fragments. Although 
betaPP has been studied extensively, its precise physiological role is unknown. 
A line of transgenic knock-out mice selectively deficient in betaPP survive and 
breed but exhibit motor dysfunction and brain gliosis, consistent with a 
physiological role for betaPP in neuron development. To elucidate these 
functions, we cultured hippocampal neurons from wild-type and betaPP-deficient 
mice and compared their ability to attach, survive, and develop neurites. We 
found that hippocampal neurons from betaPP-deficient mice had diminished 
viability and retarded neurite development. We also compared the effects of 
betaPP secretory products, released from wild-type astrocytes, on process 
outgrowth from wild-type and betaPP-deficient hippocampal neurons. Outgrowth was 
enhanced at 1 d in the presence of wild-type astrocytes, as compared with 
betaPP-deficient astrocytes. However, by 3 d, neurons had shorter axons but more 
minor processes with more branching when cocultured with wild-type astrocytes, 
as compared with betaPP-deficient astrocytes. Our data demonstrate that 
cell-associated neuronal betaPP contributes to neuron viability, axonogenesis, 
and arborization and that betaPP secretory products modulate axon growth, 
dendrite branching, and dendrite numbers.
