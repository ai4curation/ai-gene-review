Cilia serve as sensory devices in a diversity of organisms and their defects 
contribute to many human diseases. In primary cilia of kidney cells, the 
transient receptor potential polycystin (TRPP) channels polycystin-1 (PC-1) and 
polycystin-2 (PC-2) act as a mechanosensitive channel, with defects resulting in 
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. In sensory cilia of Caenorhabditis 
elegans male-specific neurons, the TRPPs LOV-1 and PKD-2 are required for mating 
behavior. The mechanisms regulating TRPP ciliary localization and function are 
largely unknown. We identified the regulatory subunit of the serine-threonine 
casein kinase II (CK2) as a binding partner of LOV-1 and human PC-1. CK2 and the 
calcineurin phosphatase TAX-6 modulate male mating behavior and PKD-2 ciliary 
localization. The phospho-defective mutant PKD-2(S534A) localizes to cilia, 
whereas a phospho-mimetic PKD-2(S534D) mutant is largely absent from cilia. 
Calcineurin is required for PKD-2 ciliary localization, but is not essential for 
ciliary gene expression, ciliogenesis, or localization of cilium structural 
components. This unanticipated function of calcineurin may be important for 
regulating ciliary protein localization. A dynamic 
phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle may represent a mechanism for modulating 
TRPP activity, cellular sensation, and ciliary protein localization.
