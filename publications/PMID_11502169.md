Separation of yeast mitochondrial complexes by colorless native polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis led to the identification of a supramolecular structure 
exhibiting NADH-dehydrogenase activity. Components of this complex were 
identified by N-terminal Edman degradation and matrix-assisted laser desorption 
ionization mass spectrometry. The complex was found to contain the five known 
intermembrane space-facing dehydrogenases, namely two external 
NADH-dehydrogenases Nde1p and Nde2p, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Gut2p, 
D- and L-lactate-dehydrogenases Dld1p and Cyb2p, the matrix-facing 
NADH-dehydrogenase Ndi1p, two probable flavoproteins YOR356Wp and YPR004Cp, four 
tricarboxylic acids cycle enzymes (malate dehydrogenase Mdh1p, citrate synthase 
Cit1p, succinate dehydrogenase Sdh1p, and fumarate hydratase Fum1p), and the 
acetaldehyde dehydrogenase Ald4p. The association of these proteins is discussed 
in terms of NADH-channeling.
