Fas is an apoptosis-signaling receptor molecule on the surface of a number of 
cell types. Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a human 
Fas messenger RNA variant capable of encoding a soluble Fas molecule lacking the 
transmembrane domain because of the deletion of an exon encoding this region. 
The expression of soluble Fas was confirmed by flow cytometry and 
immunocytochemical analysis. Supernatants from cells transfected with the 
variant messenger RNA blocked apoptosis induced by the antibody to Fas. Levels 
of soluble Fas were elevated in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and 
mice injected with soluble Fas displayed autoimmune features.
