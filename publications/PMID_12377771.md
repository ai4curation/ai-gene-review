Recent studies have suggested a possible role for presenilin proteins in 
apoptotic cell death observed in Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism by which 
presenilin proteins regulate apoptotic cell death is not well understood. Using 
the yeast two-hybrid system, we previously isolated a novel protein, 
presenilin-associated protein (PSAP) that specifically interacts with the C 
terminus of presenilin 1 (PS1), but not presenilin 2 (PS2). Here we report that 
PSAP is a mitochondrial resident protein sharing homology with mitochondrial 
carrier protein. PSAP was detected in a mitochondria-enriched fraction, and PSAP 
immunofluorescence was present in a punctate pattern that colocalized with a 
mitochondrial marker. More interestingly, overexpression of PSAP caused 
apoptotic death. PSAP-induced apoptosis was documented using multiple 
independent approaches, including membrane blebbing, chromosome condensation and 
fragmentation, DNA laddering, cleavage of the death substrate poly(ADP-ribose) 
polymerase, and flow cytometry. PSAP-induced cell death was accompanied by 
cytochrome c release from mitochondria and caspase-3 activation. Moreover, the 
general caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, 
which blocked cell death, did not block the release of cytochrome c from 
mitochondria caused by overexpression of PSAP, indicating that PSAP-induced 
cytochrome c release was independent of caspase activity. The mitochondrial 
localization and proapoptotic activity of PSAP suggest that it is an important 
regulator of apoptosis.
