Etoposide is a potent inducer of mitotic catastrophe; a type of cell death 
resulting from aberrant mitosis. It is important in p53 negative cells where p53 
dependent apoptosis and events at the G1 and G2 cell cycle checkpoints are 
compromised. Passenger proteins regulate many aspects of mitosis and siRNA 
interference or direct inhibition of Aurora B kinase results in mitotic 
catastrophe. However, there is little available data of clinical relevance in 
leukaemia models. Here, in p53 negative K562 myeloid leukemia cells, 
etoposide-induced mitotic catastrophe is shown to be time and/or concentration 
dependent. Survivin and Aurora remained bound to chromosomes. Survivin and 
Aurora were also associated with Cdk1 and were shown to form complexes, which in 
pull down experiments, included INCENP. There was no evidence of Aurora B kinase 
suppression. These data suggests etoposide will complement Aurora B kinase 
inhibitors currently in clinical trials for cancer.
