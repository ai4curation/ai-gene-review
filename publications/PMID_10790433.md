According to a recently proposed hypothesis, initiation of signal transduction 
via immunoreceptors depends on interactions of the engaged immunoreceptor with 
glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains (GEMs). In this study, we 
describe a novel GEM-associated transmembrane adaptor protein, termed 
phosphoprotein associated with GEMs (PAG). PAG comprises a short extracellular 
domain of 16 amino acids and a 397-amino acid cytoplasmic tail containing ten 
tyrosine residues that are likely phosphorylated by Src family kinases. In 
lymphoid cell lines and in resting peripheral blood alpha/beta T cells, PAG is 
expressed as a constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated protein and binds the 
major negative regulator of Src kinases, the tyrosine kinase Csk. After 
activation of peripheral blood alpha/beta T cells, PAG becomes rapidly 
dephosphorylated and dissociates from Csk. Expression of PAG in COS cells 
results in recruitment of endogenous Csk, altered Src kinase activity, and 
impaired phosphorylation of Src-specific substrates. Moreover, overexpression of 
PAG in Jurkat cells downregulates T cell receptor-mediated activation of the 
transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells. These findings 
collectively suggest that in the absence of external stimuli, the PAG-Csk 
complex transmits negative regulatory signals and thus may help to keep resting 
T cells in a quiescent state.
