Mutations in the APC tumor suppressor gene are present in approximately 85% of 
colorectal tumors and are thought to contribute early in the process of 
tumorigenesis. The truncated protein resulting from most APC mutations can lead 
to elevated beta-catenin levels in colon tumor cells. APC and associated 
proteins thus form a beta-catenin regulatory complex, with axin playing a key 
role. Although cell culture studies have revealed intriguing aspects of this 
complex, little characterization has been done in human colonocytes, the target 
tissue of colon carcinogenesis. The present study of intact human colon crypts, 
adenomatous polyps, and adenocarcinomas focuses on subcellular localization of 
some key elements of the complex: beta-catenin, APC, axin, and axin2. We 
examined endogenous protein localization within the framework of 
three-dimensional tissue architecture by using laser scanning confocal 
microscopy, and immunofluorescence staining of whole-mount fixed tissue from 
more than 50 patients. Expression patterns suggest that APC and axin colocalize 
in the nucleus and at lateral cell borders, and show that axin2 is limited to 
the nucleus. Altered nuclear expression of axin seen in colon polyps and 
carcinomas may be a consequence of the loss of full-length APC and the advent of 
nuclear beta-catenin. The observation of nuclear beta-catenin in fewer than half 
of carcinoma images and only rarely in polyps indicates that nuclear 
translocation of beta-catenin may not be an immediate consequence of the loss of 
APC.
