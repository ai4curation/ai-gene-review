In most eukaryotes, constitutive heterochromatin, defined by histone H3 lysine 9 
methylation (H3K9me), is enriched on repetitive DNA, such as pericentromeric 
repeats and transposons. Furthermore, repetitive transgenes also induce 
heterochromatin formation in diverse model organisms. However, the mechanisms 
that promote heterochromatin formation at repetitive DNA elements are still not 
clear. Here, using fission yeast, we show that tandemly repeated mRNA genes 
promote RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated heterochromatin formation in 
cooperation with an antisilencing factor, Epe1. Although the presence of 
tandemly repeated genes itself does not cause heterochromatin formation, once 
complementary small RNAs are artificially supplied in trans, the RNAi machinery 
assembled on the repeated genes starts producing cognate small RNAs in cis to 
autonomously maintain heterochromatin at these sites. This "repeat-induced RNAi" 
depends on the copy number of repeated genes and Epe1, which is known to remove 
H3K9me and derepress the transcription of genes underlying heterochromatin. 
Analogous to repeated genes, the DNA sequence underlying constitutive 
heterochromatin encodes widespread transcription start sites (TSSs), from which 
Epe1 activates ncRNA transcription to promote RNAi-mediated heterochromatin 
formation. Our results suggest that when repetitive transcription units underlie 
heterochromatin, Epe1 generates sufficient transcripts for the activation of 
RNAi without disruption of heterochromatin.
