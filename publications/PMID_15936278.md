Protein degradation in eukaryotic cells usually involves the attachment of a 
ubiquitin chain to a substrate protein and its subsequent sorting to the 
proteasome. Molecular mechanisms underlying the sorting process only recently 
began to emerge and rely on a cooperation of chaperone machineries and 
ubiquitin-chain recognition factors [1-3]. Here, we identify isoforms of the 
cochaperone HSJ1 as neuronal shuttling factors for ubiquitylated proteins. HSJ1 
combines a J-domain that stimulates substrate loading onto the Hsc70 chaperone 
with ubiquitin interaction motifs (UIMs) involved in binding ubiquitylated 
chaperone clients. HSJ1 prevents client aggregation, shields clients against 
chain trimming by ubiquitin hydrolases, and stimulates their sorting to the 
proteasome. In this way, HSJ1 isoforms participate in ER-associated degradation 
(ERAD) and protect neurons against cytotoxic protein aggregation.
