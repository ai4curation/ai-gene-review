We endeavored to identify proteins interacting with KLGFFKR, a highly conserved 
motif in the cytoplasmic domain adjacent to the transmembrane domain of the 
alpha subunit of integrins. We found that affinity chromatography of cell 
extracts with this peptide followed by elution with EDTA resulted in the 
isolation of a 60-kDa protein (p60). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this 
60-kDa polypeptide was found to be highly homologous to the Ro/SS-A antigen, a 
60-kDa protein homologous to calreticulin and Aplysia "memory molecule". The 
binding of p60 was found to be specific for the KLGFFKR sequence since this 
polypeptide did not bind to a peptide with a scrambled amino acid sequence 
(KLRFGFK), and it was also specifically eluted from the KLGFFKR affinity matrix 
ith soluble KLGFFKR peptide but not with the scrambled peptide. Solid phase in 
vitro binding assays demonstrated specific interaction of p60 with integrin 
alpha 3 and alpha 5 subunits but not with the beta 1 subunit. Furthermore, p60 
could be copurified with alpha 3 beta 1 following coincubation in vitro. These 
interactions could be inhibited by KLGFFKR peptide and also by EDTA, indicating 
sequence-specific and divalent cation dependent binding. Despite the fact that 
calreticulin is thought to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, a pool of 
Ro/SS A antigen homologous 60-kDa polypeptide was found to be present in the 
soluble cytoplasm, indicating the feasibility of an interaction of p60 with the 
integrin alpha subunits. Our data suggest that p60 (Ro/SS-A Ag) can specifically 
bind to integrin alpha subunits via the highly conserved KLGFFKR amino acid 
sequence.
