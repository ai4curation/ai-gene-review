Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) plays a pivotal role in brain development and 
neuronal migration. Cdk5 is abundant in postmitotic, terminally differentiated 
neurons. The ability of Cdk5 to phosphorylate substrates is dependent on 
activation by its neuronal-specific activators p35 and p39. There exist striking 
differences in the phenotypic severity of Cdk5-deficient mice and p35-deficient 
mice. Cdk5-null mutants show a more severe disruption of lamination in the 
cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. In addition, Cdk5-null mice 
display perinatal lethality, whereas p35-null mice are viable. These 
discrepancies have been attributed to the function of other Cdk5 activators, 
such as p39. To understand the roles of p39 and p35, we created p39-null mice 
and p35/p39 compound-mutant mice. Interestingly, p39-null mice show no obvious 
detectable abnormalities, whereas p35(-/-)p39(-/-) double-null mutants are 
perinatal lethal. We show here that the p35(-/-)p39(-/-) mutants exhibit 
phenotypes identical to those of the Cdk5-null mutant mice. Other 
compound-mutant mice with intermediate phenotypes allow us to determine the 
distinct and redundant functions between p35 and p39. Our data strongly suggest 
that p35 and p39 are essential for Cdk5 activity during the development of the 
nervous system. Thus, p35 and p39 are likely to be the principal, if not the 
only, activators of Cdk5.
