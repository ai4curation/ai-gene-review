Rho GTPases regulate multiple signal transduction pathways that influence many 
aspects of cell behaviour, including migration, morphology, polarity and cell 
cycle. Through their ability to control the assembly and organization of the 
actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, Rho and Cdc42 make several key 
contributions during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle, including spindle 
assembly, spindle positioning, cleavage furrow contraction and abscission. We 
now report that PRK2/PKN2, a Ser/Thr kinase and Rho/Rac effector protein, is an 
essential regulator of both entry into mitosis and exit from cytokinesis in HeLa 
S3 cells. PRK2 is required for abscission of the midbody at the end of the cell 
division cycle and for phosphorylation and activation of Cdc25B, the phosphatase 
required for activation of mitotic cyclin/Cdk1 complexes at the G2/M transition. 
This reveals an additional step in the mammalian cell cycle controlled by Rho 
GTPases.
