The pattern of peptidoglycan (murein) segregation in cells of Escherichia coli 
with impaired activity of the morphogenetic proteins penicillin-binding protein 
2 and RodA has been investigated by the D-cysteine-biotin immunolabeling 
technique (M. A. de Pedro, J. C. Quintela, J.-V. Höltje, and H. Schwarz, J. 
Bacteriol. 179:2823-2834, 1997). Inactivation of these proteins either by 
amdinocillin treatment or by mutations in the corresponding genes, pbpA and 
rodA, respectively, leads to the generation of round, osmotically stable cells. 
In normal rod-shaped cells, new murein precursors are incorporated all over the 
lateral wall in a diffuse manner, being mixed up homogeneously with preexisting 
material, except during septation, when strictly localized murein synthesis 
occurs. In contrast, in rounded cells, incorporation of new precursors is 
apparently a zonal process, localized at positions at which division had 
previously taken place. Consequently, there is no mixing of new and old murein. 
Old murein is preserved for long periods of time in large, well-defined areas. 
We propose that the observed patterns are the result of a failure to switch off 
septal murein synthesis at the end of septation events. Furthermore, the 
segregation results confirm that round cells of rodA mutants do divide in 
alternate, perpendicular planes as previously proposed (K. J. Begg and W. D. 
Donachie, J. Bacteriol. 180:2564-2567, 1998).
