Oocyte meiosis and early mitotic divisions in developing embryos rely on the 
timely production of cell cycle regulators and their clearance via proteasomal 
degradation. Ret Finger Protein-Like 4 (Rfpl4), encoding a RING finger-like 
protein with a B30.2 domain, was discovered during an in silico search for germ 
cell-specific genes. To study the expression and functions of RFPL4 protein, we 
performed immunolocalizations and used yeast two-hybrid and other 
protein-protein interaction assays. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence 
showed that RFPL4 accumulates in all growing oocytes and quickly disappears 
during early embryonic cleavage. We used a yeast two-hybrid model to demonstrate 
that RFPL4 interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme HR6A, proteasome 
subunit beta type 1, ubiquitin B, as well as a degradation target protein, 
cyclin B1. Coimmunoprecipitation analyses of in vitro translated proteins and 
extracts of transiently cotransfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells 
confirmed these findings. We conclude that, like many RING-finger containing 
proteins, RFPL4 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The specificity of its expression and 
these interactions suggest that RFPL4 targets cyclin B1 for proteasomal 
degradation, a key aspect of oocyte cell cycle control during meiosis and the 
crucial oocyte-to-embryo transition to mitosis.
