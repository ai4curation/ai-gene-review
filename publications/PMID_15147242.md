Dec2, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix superfamily, is a recently 
confirmed regulatory protein for the clockwork system. Transcripts of Dec2, as 
well as those of its related gene Dec1, exhibit a striking circadian oscillation 
in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and Dec2 inhibits transcription from the Per1 
promoter induced by Clock/Bmal1 [Honma, Kawamoto, Takagi, Fujimoto, Sato, 
Noshiro, Kato and Honma (2002) Nature (London) 419, 841-844]. It is known that 
mammalian circadian rhythms are controlled by molecular clockwork systems based 
on negative-feedback loop(s), but the molecular mechanisms for the circadian 
regulation of Dec2 gene expression have not been clarified. We show here that 
transcription of the Dec2 gene is regulated by several clock molecules and a 
negative-feedback loop. Luciferase and gel retardation assays showed that 
expression of Dec2 was negatively regulated by binding of Dec2 or Dec1 to two 
CACGTG E-boxes in the Dec2 promoter. Forced expression of Clock/Bmal1 and 
Clock/Bmal2 markedly increased Dec2 mRNA levels, and up-regulated the 
transcription of the Dec2 gene through the CACGTG E-boxes. Like Dec, Cry and Per 
also suppressed Clock/Bmal-induced transcription from the Dec2 promoter. 
Moreover, the circadian expression of Dec2 transcripts was abolished in the 
kidney of Clock/Clock mutant mice. These findings suggest that the Clock/Bmal 
heterodimer enhances Dec2 transcription via the CACGTG E-boxes, whereas the 
induced transcription is suppressed by Dec2, which therefore must contribute to 
its own rhythmic expression. In addition, Cry and Per may also modulate Dec2 
transcription.
