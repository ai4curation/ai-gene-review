BACKGROUND: Previous studies have provided evidence for the importance of 
platelet-derived nitric oxide (NO) for the regulation of hemostasis. 
Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor and regulator of NO synthase 
activity in the vasculature; however, it is as yet unknown whether platelets 
dispose over a functional BH4 synthesis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We quantified mRNA expression of genes involved in BH4 
synthesis, measured enzymatic activities, and determined intraplatelet levels of 
pteridines in platelets from healthy volunteers and from patients treated for 
prolonged periods of time with glucocorticoids. Freshly isolated platelets from 
healthy volunteers show functional BH4 synthesis, as evidenced by the presence 
of mRNA species and enzymatic activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), 
6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase, and sepiapterin reductase. Biopterin was 
the major intraplatelet pteridine, whereas no neopterin was found. mRNA 
expression and enzymatic activity of GTPCH were undetectably low in platelets 
that had been stored for 5 days, and no pteridines were found in these 
platelets. Freshly isolated platelets from patients treated with glucocorticoids 
had decreased mRNA expression and activity of GTPCH compared with platelets from 
healthy volunteers.
CONCLUSIONS: Human platelets dispose over a functional de novo BH4 synthesis. 
Furthermore, our results indicate the potential of external factors, eg, 
prolonged storage or glucocorticoid therapy, to significantly affect BH4 
synthesis within platelets. Together, these findings offer new insights into the 
biology and pathobiology of platelet function in humans.
