The DNA damage response (DDR) is brought about by a protein kinase cascade that 
orchestrates DNA repair through transcriptional and posttranslational 
mechanisms. Cell cycle arrest is a hallmark of the DDR. We screened for cells 
that lacked damage-induced cell cycle arrest and uncovered a critical role for 
Fanconi anemia and homologous recombination proteins in ATR (ataxia 
telangiectasia and Rad3-related) signaling. Three DDR candidates, the RNA 
processing protein INTS7, the circadian transcription factor CLOCK, and a 
previously uncharacterized protein RHINO, were recruited to sites of DNA damage. 
RHINO independently bound the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complex (9-1-1) and the ATR 
activator TopBP1. RHINO was recruited to sites of DNA damage by the 9-1-1 
complex to promote Chk1 activation. We suggest that RHINO functions together 
with the 9-1-1 complex and TopBP1 to fully activate ATR.
