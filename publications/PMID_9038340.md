The Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) is a six-protein assembly that specifies 
the sites of DNA replication initiation in S. cerevisiae. Origin recognition by 
ORC requires ATP. Here, we demonstrate that two subunits, Orc1p and Orc5p, bind 
ATP and that Orc1p also hydrolyzes ATP. ATP binding and hydrolysis by Orc1p are 
both regulated by origin DNA in a sequence-specific manner. ATP binding to 
Orc1p, but not ATP hydrolysis, is responsible for the ATP dependence of the 
ORC-origin interaction, indicating that ATP is a cofactor that locks ORC on 
origin DNA. These data demonstrate that occupancy of the Orc1p ATP-binding site 
has a profound effect on ORC function and that ATP hydrolysis by Orc1p has the 
potential to drive transitions between different functional states of ORC.
