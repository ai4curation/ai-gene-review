Sir2 is a NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase that controls gene silencing, 
cell cycle, DNA damage repair, and life span. Prompted by the observation that 
the [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio is subjected to dynamic fluctuations in skeletal 
muscle, we have tested whether Sir2 regulates muscle gene expression and 
differentiation. Sir2 forms a complex with the acetyltransferase PCAF and MyoD 
and, when overexpressed, retards muscle differentiation. Conversely, cells with 
decreased Sir2 differentiate prematurely. To inhibit myogenesis, Sir2 requires 
its NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase activity. The [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio decreases 
as muscle cells differentiate, while an increased [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio inhibits 
muscle gene expression. Cells with reduced Sir2 levels are less sensitive to the 
inhibition imposed by an elevated [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio. These results indicate 
that Sir2 regulates muscle gene expression and differentiation by possibly 
functioning as a redox sensor. In response to exercise, food intake, and 
starvation, Sir2 may sense modifications of the redox state and promptly 
modulate gene expression.
