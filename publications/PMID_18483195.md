Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the 
cerebral deposition of amyloid fibrils formed by Abeta peptide. Despite their 
prevalence in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, important 
details of the structure of amyloid fibrils remain unknown. Here, we present a 
three-dimensional structure of a mature amyloid fibril formed by Abeta(1-40) 
peptide, determined by electron cryomicroscopy at approximately 8-A resolution. 
The fibril consists of two protofilaments, each containing approximately 
5-nm-long regions of beta-sheet structure. A local twofold symmetry within each 
region suggests that pairs of beta-sheets are formed from equivalent parts of 
two Abeta(1-40) peptides contained in each protofilament. The pairing occurs via 
tightly packed interfaces, reminiscent of recently reported steric zipper 
structures. However, unlike these previous structures, the beta-sheet pairing is 
observed within an amyloid fibril and includes significantly longer amino acid 
sequences.
