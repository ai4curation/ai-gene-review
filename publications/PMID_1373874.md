Bcl-2 confers growth and survival advantage to interleukin 7-dependent early 
pre-B cells which become factor independent by a multistep process in culture.

Early pre-B cells derived from mouse lymphoid bone marrow cultures were expanded 
on a surrogate stromal cell line composed of NIH3T3 fibroblasts engineered to 
secrete interleukin 7 (IL-7). Three immortal, IL-7-dependent cell lines were 
generated and infected with recombinant retroviruses to determine the effects of 
the human follicular B-cell lymphoma gene, bcl-2, on immature stages of B-cell 
development. Cells expressing bcl-2 grew at rates similar to those of control 
(vector only) cells when plated on bone marrow stromal lines, but exhibited a c. 
two-fold net proliferative advantage when grown in liquid medium supplemented 
with IL-7 alone. Bcl-2 prevented apoptosis when the infected early pre-B-cell 
lines were deprived of IL-7 and other growth factors provided by stromal cells. 
Following factor deprivation, a subset of cells expressing bcl-2 survived 
indefinitely. Two such cultures spontaneously gave rise to factor-independent 
variants which grew slowly in unsupplemented liquid culture and formed agar 
colonies, yet still responded positively to IL-7 and kit ligand, and negatively 
to gamma-interferon. Bcl-2 thus provides a survival capacity and modest growth 
advantage to early pre-B cells, which may recapitulate its effects in human B 
cells bearing t(14;18) translocations and ultimately contribute to 
transformation.
