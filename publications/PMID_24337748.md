GTPases act as important switches in many signaling events in cells. Although 
small and heterotrimeric G proteins are subjects of intensive studies, little is 
known about the large IFN-inducible GTPases. In this article, we show that the 
IFN-γ-inducible guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP-1) is a regulator of T cell 
activation. Silencing of GBP-1 leads to enhanced activation of early T cell Ag 
receptor/CD3 signaling molecules, including Lck, that is translated to higher 
IL-2 production. Mass spectrometry analyses showed that regulatory cytoskeletal 
proteins, like plastin-2 that bundles actin fibers and spectrin β-chain, brain 1 
that links the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, are binding partners 
of GBP-1. The spectrin cytoskeleton influences cell spreading and surface 
expression of TCR/CD3 and the leukocyte phosphatase CD45. We found higher cell 
spreading and enhanced surface expression of TCR/CD3 and CD45 in GBP-1 silenced 
T cells that explain their enhanced TCR/CD3 signaling. We conclude that GBP-1 is 
a downstream processor of IFN-γ via which T cells regulate 
cytoskeleton-dependent cell functions.
