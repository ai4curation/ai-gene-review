Plasmodium vivax shows a strict host tropism for reticulocytes. We identified 
transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) as the receptor for P. vivax reticulocyte-binding 
protein 2b (PvRBP2b). We determined the structure of the N-terminal domain of 
PvRBP2b involved in red blood cell binding, elucidating the molecular basis for 
TfR1 recognition. We validated TfR1 as the biological target of PvRBP2b 
engagement by means of TfR1 expression knockdown analysis. TfR1 mutant cells 
deficient in PvRBP2b binding were refractory to invasion of P. vivax but not to 
invasion of P. falciparum Using Brazilian and Thai clinical isolates, we show 
that PvRBP2b monoclonal antibodies that inhibit reticulocyte binding also block 
P. vivax entry into reticulocytes. These data show that TfR1-PvRBP2b invasion 
pathway is critical for the recognition of reticulocytes during P. vivax 
invasion.

Abstract

Plasmodium vivax shows a strict host tropism for reticulocytes. We identify transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) as the receptor for P. vivax reticulocyte-binding protein 2b (PvRBP2b). The structure of the N-terminal domain of PvRBP2b involved in red blood cell binding was determined, elucidating the molecular basis for TfR1 recognition. TfR1 was validated as the biological target of PvRBP2b engagement by TfR1 expression knockdown analysis. TfR1 mutant cells deficient in PvRBP2b binding were refractory to invasion of P. vivax , but not to invasion of P. falciparum . Using Brazilian and Thai clinical isolates, we show that PvRBP2b monoclonal antibodies that inhibit reticulocyte binding also block P. vivax entry into reticulocytes. These data show that TfR1-PvRBP2b invasion pathway is critical for the recognition of reticulocytes during P. vivax invasion.
