We report a fast method for the isolation of homogeneous C-protein from bovine 
skeletal muscle. In electron micrographs C-protein appears as short rods with a 
relatively uniform length of about 50 nm. Protein sequencing shows a single 
N-terminal sequence. Radio-labelled C-protein strongly decorates titin II and 
myosin rods but not myosin heads. Binding to titin II is retained in 
preparations lacking titin-associated proteins. Antibodies to bovine C-protein 
were used to screen a lambda gt11 cDNA library constructed from fetal human 
skeletal muscle. Clone HC38 is 3833 bp long and encodes a protein of 1138 amino 
acid residues. The start of the predicted sequence fits the N-terminal sequence 
of the bovine protein. All partial sequences obtained from the bovine protein 
(348 residues) and the sequence deduced from a partial chicken cDNA (Einheber 
and Fischman, 1990) can be aligned along the human sequence. The sequences of 
human and chicken C-proteins share 50% identity and 70% similarity. Along the 
repeat patterns of the human protein the fibronectin (Fn)-like domains are 
better conserved than the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. Regions of strong 
divergence between chicken fast C-protein and human slow C-protein may represent 
differences in C-protein isoforms.
