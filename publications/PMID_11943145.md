The acidic (A) region of WASp family proteins is thought to represent a 
high-affinity binding site for Arp2/3 complex without activating properties. 
Here we show that GST-fused WASp-A and N-WASP-A, but not a WASP-A/W500S mutant, 
several truncated WASp-A constructs or WAVE1-A can pull down Arp2/3 complex from 
cell lysates. Significantly, WASp-A and N-WASP-A synergistically trigger 
formation of filopodia or lamellipodia when coinjected with sub-effective 
concentrations of V12CDC42Hs or V12Rac1, respectively, into macrophages. The 
ability of WASp family A region constructs to induce this effect is closely 
correlated with their ability to bind Arp2/3 complex in vitro. These results 
imply that (i) Arp2/3 complex is critically involved in filopodia and 
lamellipodia formation in macrophages and (ii) acidic regions of WASp and N-WASP 
are not simply binding sites for Arp2/3 complex but can prime it for 
RhoGTPase-triggered signals leading to actin nucleation.
