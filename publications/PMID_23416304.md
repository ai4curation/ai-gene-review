Formation of chiral amyloid superstructures is a newly recognised phenomenon 
observed upon agitation-assisted fibrillation of bovine insulin. Here, by 
surveying several amyloidogenic precursors we examine whether formation of such 
entities is unique to bovine insulin. Our results indicate that only bovine, 
human, and porcine insulins are capable of chiral superstructural self-assembly. 
A tiny covalent perturbation consisting in reversal of Pro(B28)-Lys(B29) 
residues in a human insulin analog is sufficient to prevent this process. Our 
study suggests that insulin's dimer-forming interface--specifically the 
B-chain's C-terminal fragment--may acquire the new role of a molecular velcro 
upon lateral alignment of individual fibrils into superstructures.
