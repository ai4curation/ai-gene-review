The extensive somatic diversification of immune receptors is a hallmark of 
higher vertebrates. However, whether molecular diversity contributes to immune 
protection in invertebrates is unknown. We present evidence that Drosophila 
immune-competent cells have the potential to express more than 18,000 isoforms 
of the immunoglobulin (Ig)-superfamily receptor Down syndrome cell adhesion 
molecule (Dscam). Secreted protein isoforms of Dscam were detected in the 
hemolymph, and hemocyte-specific loss of Dscam impaired the efficiency of 
phagocytic uptake of bacteria, possibly due to reduced bacterial binding. 
Importantly, the molecular diversity of Dscam transcripts generated through a 
mechanism of alternative splicing is highly conserved across major insect 
orders, suggesting an unsuspected molecular complexity of the innate immune 
system of insects.
