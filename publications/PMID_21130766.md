Tob belongs to the anti-proliferative Tob/BTG family. The level of Tob 
throughout the cell cycle is regulated by the SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box 
protein)(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase (E3) complex. Here, we show that Coronin7 (CRN7) 
is also involved in Tob degradation. We identified CRN7 as a Tob-interacting 
molecule. A sequence containing two of the six WD motifs in the middle of CRN7 
was responsible for the interaction. CRN7 enhanced the polyubiquitination of Tob 
in vitro, and overexpression of CRN7 promoted proteasome-dependent degradation 
of Tob. Furthermore, CRN7 interacted with Cullin1 and Roc1 to form a novel 
SCF-like E3 complex, suggesting that Tob protein is regulated by multiple 
ubiquitination machineries.
