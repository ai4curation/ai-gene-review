Both sporadic and autosomal dominant forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been 
causally linked to mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a large 
protein with multiple domains. The kinase domain plays an important role in 
LRRK2-mediated toxicity. Although a number of investigations have focused on 
LRRK2 kinase activity, less is known about the GTPase function of LRRK2. The 
activity of GTPases is regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and GTP 
exchange factors. Here, we identify ArfGAP1 as the first GAP for LRRK2. ArfGAP1 
binds LRRK2 predominantly via the WD40 and kinase domain of LRRK2, and it 
increases LRRK2 GTPase activity and regulates LRRK2 toxicity both in vitro and 
in vivo in Drosophila melanogaster. Unexpectedly, ArfGAP1 is an LRRK2 kinase 
substrate whose GAP activity is inhibited by LRRK2, whereas wild-type and G2019S 
LRRK2 autophosphorylation and kinase activity are significantly reduced in the 
presence of ArfGAP1. Overexpressed ArfGAP1 exhibits toxicity that is reduced by 
LRRK2 both in vitro and in vivo. Δ64-ArfGAP1, a dominant-negative ArfGAP1, and 
shRNA knockdown of ArfGAP1 reduce LRRK2 toxicity. Thus, LRRK2 and ArfGAP1 
reciprocally regulate the activity of each other. Our results provide insight 
into the basic pathobiology of LRRK2 and indicate an important role for the 
GTPase domain and ArfGAP1 in LRRK2-mediated toxicity. These data suggest that 
agents targeted toward regulation of LRRK2 GTP hydrolysis might be therapeutic 
agents for the treatment of PD.
