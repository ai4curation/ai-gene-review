The development of genetic competence in the Gram-positive eubacterium Bacillus 
subtilis is a complex postexponential process. Here we describe a new 
bicistronic operon, bdbDC, required for competence development, which was 
identified by the B. subtilis Systematic Gene Function Analysis program. 
Inactivation of either the bdbC or bdbD genes of this operon results in the loss 
of transformability without affecting recombination or the synthesis of ComK, 
the competence transcription factor. BdbC and BdbD are orthologs of enzymes 
known to be involved in extracytoplasmic disulfide bond formation. Consistent 
with this, BdbC and BdbD are needed for the secretion of the Escherichia coli 
disulfide bond-containing alkaline phosphatase, PhoA, by B. subtilis. Similarly, 
the amount of the disulfide bond-containing competence protein ComGC is severely 
reduced in bdbC or bdbD mutants. In contrast, the amounts of the competence 
proteins ComGA and ComEA remain unaffected by bdbDC mutations. Taken together, 
these observations imply that in the absence of either BdbC or BdbD, ComGC is 
unstable and that BdbC and BdbD catalyze the formation of disulfide bonds that 
are essential for the DNA binding and uptake machinery.
