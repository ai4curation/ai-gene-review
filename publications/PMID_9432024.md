Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is a rare inherited bleeding disorder which is 
caused by a qualitative or quantitative abnormality of the platelet glycoprotein 
(GP) Ib/IX/V complex. We examined a patient with BSS to find a molecular basis 
for the defect underlying this disease. The propositus was a 39-year-old 
Japanese female with life-long bleeding diathesis. Sequence analysis of the GPIX 
gene revealed a T-->C point mutation at nucleotide 1856 (EMBL, M80478), 
resulting in Phe55(TTT)-->Ser(TCT) replacement. This substitution created a new 
MnlI restriction site in the mutant allele. Restriction analysis revealed that 
the propositus was homozygous for this sequence, and the same mutation was not 
detected in 57 unrelated Japanese subjects. Since this mutation is located in 
the leucine-rich motif (LRM) of the GPIX polypeptide, the Phe55-->Ser 
substitution may result in an alteration of the LRM which leads to the impaired 
surface expression of GPIb/IX/V complex, a characteristic of BSS.
