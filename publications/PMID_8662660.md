A set of deletion mutants of human RNA polymerase II-associated protein (RAP) 
30, the small subunit of transcription factor IIF (TFIIF; RAP30/74), was 
constructed to map functional domains. Mutants were tested for accurate 
transcriptional activity, RAP74 binding, and TFIIB binding. Transcription assays 
indicate the importance of both N- and C-terminal sequences for RAP30 function. 
RAP74 binds to the N-terminal region of RAP30 between amino acids 1 and 98. 
TFIIB binds to an overlapping region of RAP30, localized to amino acids 1-176 
(amino acids 27-152 comprise a minimal binding region). The C-terminal region of 
RAP74 (amino acids 358-517) binds directly and independently to TFIIB. 
Interestingly, RAP74 blocks TFIIB-RAP30 binding, both by binding TFIIB and by 
binding RAP30. When the TFIIF complex is intact, therefore, TFIIB-TFIIF contact 
is maintained through RAP74. If the TFIIB-RAP30 interaction is physiologically 
important, the TFIIF complex must dissociate within some transcription 
complexes.
