The ESCRT machinery functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission 
events, namely multivesicular body formation, the terminal stages of cytokinesis 
and HIV-1 release. Here, we show that the ESCRT-III-binding protein Alix is 
recruited to the midbody of dividing cells through binding Cep55 via an 
evolutionarily conserved peptide. Disruption of Cep55/Alix/ESCRT-III 
interactions causes formation of aberrant midbodies and cytokinetic failure, 
demonstrating an essential role for these proteins in midbody morphology and 
cell division. We also show that the C terminus of Alix encodes a 
multimerization activity that is essential for its function in Alix-dependent 
HIV-1 release and for interaction with Tsg101. Last, we demonstrate that 
overexpression of Chmp4b and Chmp4c differentially inhibits HIV-1 release and 
cytokinesis, suggesting possible reasons for gene expansion within the mammalian 
Class E VPS pathway.
