Large-scale genetic analyses of human tumor samples have been used to identify 
novel oncogenes, tumor suppressors and prognostic factors, but the functions and 
molecular interactions of many individual genes have not been determined. In 
this study we examined the cellular effects and molecular mechanism of the 
arrestin family member, ARRDC3, a gene preferentially lost in a subset of breast 
cancers. Oncomine data revealed that the expression of ARRDC3 decreases with 
tumor grade, metastases and recurrences. ARRDC3 overexpression represses cancer 
cell proliferation, migration, invasion, growth in soft agar and in vivo 
tumorigenicity, whereas downregulation of ARRCD3 has the opposite effects. 
Mechanistic studies showed that ARRDC3 functions in a novel regulatory pathway 
that controls the cell surface adhesion molecule, beta-4 integrin (ITGbeta4), a 
protein associated with aggressive tumor behavior. Our data indicates ARRDC3 
directly binds to a phosphorylated form of ITGbeta4 leading to its 
internalization, ubiquitination and ultimate degradation. The results identify 
the ARRCD3-ITGbeta4 pathway as a new therapeutic target in breast cancer and 
show the importance of connecting genetic arrays with mechanistic studies in the 
search for new treatments.
