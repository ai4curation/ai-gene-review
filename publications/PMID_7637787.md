Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) is produced rapidly from 
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) in stimulated cells. Despite 
extensive experimentation, no clearly defined cellular function has yet been 
described for this inositol phosphate. Binding sites specific for Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 
have been identified in several tissues, and we have purified one such protein 
to homogeneity. Its high affinity for Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, and its exquisite 
specificity for this isomeric configuration, suggest it may be an Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 
receptor. Here we report the cloning and characterization of this protein as a 
GTPase-activating protein, specifically a member of the GAP1 family. In vitro it 
shows GAP activity against both Rap and Ras, but only the Ras GAP activity is 
inhibited by phospholipids and is specifically stimulated by Ins(1,3,4,5)P4.
