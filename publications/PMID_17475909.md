Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal recessive disorder 
characterized by bone marrow failure, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and 
leukemia predisposition. Mutations in the SBDS gene are identified in most 
patients with SDS. SBDS encodes a highly conserved protein of unknown function. 
Data from SBDS orthologs suggest that SBDS may play a role in ribosome 
biogenesis or RNA processing. Human SBDS is enriched in the nucleolus, the major 
cellular site of ribosome biogenesis. Here we report that SBDS nucleolar 
localization is dependent on active rRNA transcription. Cells from patients with 
SDS or Diamond-Blackfan anemia are hypersensitive to low doses of actinomycin D, 
an inhibitor of rRNA transcription. The addition of wild-type SBDS complements 
the actinomycin D hypersensitivity of SDS patient cells. SBDS migrates together 
with the 60S large ribosomal subunit in sucrose gradients and coprecipitates 
with 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Loss of SBDS is not associated with a discrete 
block in rRNA maturation or with decreased levels of the 60S ribosomal subunit. 
SBDS forms a protein complex with nucleophosmin, a multifunctional protein 
implicated in ribosome biogenesis and leukemogenesis. Our studies support the 
addition of SDS to the growing list of human bone marrow failure syndromes 
involving the ribosome.
