Previous work in Drosophila has defined two populations of circadian brain 
neurons, morning cells (M-cells) and evening cells (E-cells), both of which keep 
circadian time and regulate morning and evening activity, respectively. It has 
long been speculated that a multiple oscillator circadian network in animals 
underlies the behavioral and physiological pattern variability caused by 
seasonal fluctuations of photoperiod. We have manipulated separately the 
circadian photoentrainment pathway within E- and M-cells and show that E-cells 
process light information and function as master clocks in the presence of 
light. M-cells in contrast need darkness to cycle autonomously and dominate the 
network. The results indicate that the network switches control between these 
two centers as a function of photoperiod. Together with the different entraining 
properties of the two clock centers, the results suggest that the functional 
organization of the network underlies the behavioral adjustment to variations in 
daylength and season.
