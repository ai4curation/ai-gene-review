In budding yeast, the silent information regulator Sir2p is a nuclear 
NAD-dependent deacetylase that is essential for both telomeric and rDNA 
silencing. All eukaryotic species examined to date have multiple homologues of 
Sir two (HSTs), which share a highly conserved globular core domain. Here we 
report that yeast Hst2p and a mammalian Hst2p homologue, hSirT2p, are 
cytoplasmic in yeast and human cells, in contrast to yHst1p and ySir2p which are 
exclusively nuclear. Although yHst2p cannot restore silencing in a sir2 
deletion, overexpression of yHst2p influences nuclear silencing events in a SIR2 
strain, derepressing subtelomeric silencing while increasing repression in the 
rDNA. In contrast, a form of ySir2p carrying a point mutation in the conserved 
core domain disrupts both telomeric position effect (TPE) and rDNA repression at 
low expression levels. This argues that non-nuclear yHst2p can compete for a 
substrate or ligand specifically required for telomeric, and not rDNA 
repression.
