Wilms' tumor (WT) is a childhood renal neoplasm with histological features 
resembling fetal kidney development. Two members of the paired box family of 
genes, PAX2 and PAX8, are expressed in WT and are potentially involved in its 
induction. A zinc finger gene, WT1, which is involved in WT induction, encodes a 
DNA binding protein, and like PAX2 and PAX8 proteins is a transcription factor 
with an important role in kidney development. We have compared the expression 
patterns of PAX2, PAX8, and WT1 in fetal kidney and WTs by in situ 
hybridization. The PAX2, PAX8, and WT1 genes were transcribed in the condensed 
mesenchyme and early stages of epithelial differentiation in fetal kidney. WT1 
gene transcription was observed in the glomeruli of fetal kidney until a later 
stage in development than PAX genes. In WTs all three genes were expressed in 
the condensed blastema, but WT1 expression was not detectable in the epithelial 
structures in two WTs. No evidence of attenuation of PAX gene expression was 
found in WT. These results suggest that in some WTs the expression of WT1 is 
attenuated in structures that continued to express PAX genes. It is unlikely 
that both PAX2 and PAX8 genes would be mutated in WT. However, failure of PAX 
gene expression to attenuate in WTs may result from mutations involved in the 
onset of the tumor.
