The tumor suppressor p53 exerts its anti-neoplastic activity primarily through 
the induction of apoptosis. We found that cytosolic localization of endogenous 
wild-type or trans-activation-deficient p53 was necessary and sufficient for 
apoptosis. p53 directly activated the proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bax in the 
absence of other proteins to permeabilize mitochondria and engage the apoptotic 
program. p53 also released both proapoptotic multidomain proteins and BH3-only 
proteins [Proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins that share only the third Bcl-2 
homology domain (BH3)] that were sequestered by Bcl-xL. The 
transcription-independent activation of Bax by p53 occurred with similar 
kinetics and concentrations to those produced by activated Bid. We propose that 
when p53 accumulates in the cytosol, it can function analogously to the BH3-only 
subset of proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins to activate Bax and trigger apoptosis.
