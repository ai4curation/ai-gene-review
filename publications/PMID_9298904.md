Brassinosteroids are a class of growth-promoting regulators that play a key role 
throughout plant development. Despite their importance, nothing is known of the 
mechanism of action of these steroid hormones. We describe the identification of 
18 Arabidopsis dwarf mutants that are unable to respond to exogenously added 
brassinosteroid, a phenotype that might be expected for brassinosteroid 
signaling mutants. All 18 mutations define alleles of a single previously 
described gene, BRI1. We cloned BRI1 and examined its expression pattern. It 
encodes a ubiquitously expressed putative receptor kinase. The extracellular 
domain contains 25 tandem leucine-rich repeats that resemble repeats found in 
animal hormone receptors, plant disease resistance genes, and genes involved in 
unknown signaling pathways controlling plant development.
