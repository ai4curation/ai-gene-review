Cellular senescence is thought to be an important tumor suppression process in 
vivo. We have previously shown that p53 activation is necessary for CKII 
inhibition-mediated cellular senescence. Here, CKII inhibition induced 
acetylation of p53 at K382 in HCT116 and HEK293 cells. This acetylation event 
was suppressed by SIRT1 activation. CKIIα and CKIIβ were co-immunoprecipitated 
with SIRT1 in a p53-independent manner. Maltose binding protein pull-down and 
yeast two-hybrid indicated that SIRT1 bound to CKIIβ, but not to CKIIα. CKII 
inhibition reduced SIRT1 activity in cells. CKII phosphorylated and activated 
human SIRT1 in vitro. Finally, SIRT1 overexpression antagonized CKII 
inhibition-mediated cellular senescence. These results reveal that CKII 
downregulation induces p53 stabilization by negatively regulating SIRT1 
deacetylase activity during senescence.
