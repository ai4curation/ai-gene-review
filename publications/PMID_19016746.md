To evaluate the effect of galectin-3 in cell cycle regulation of colon cancer 
cells, we looked for binding molecules interacting with galectin-3 and examined 
the changes in cell cycle by suppressing galectin-3 and the binding molecule. To 
identify target molecules interacting with galectin-3, we analyzed 
immunoprecipitate of the anti-galectin-3 antibody obtained from human colon 
cancer cell line, using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass 
spectrometry. We validated subcellular localization of galectin-3 and ATP 
synthase identified, and ATP synthase activity was determined in the presence of 
galectin-3. Cell cycle regulation was monitored after galectin-3 siRNA 
transfection. ATP synthase b-subunit was identified in immunoprecipitate of the 
anti-galectin-3 antibody. Galectin-3 and ATP synthase were co-isolated in the 
inner membrane vesicles of mitochondria. Galectin-3 has an inhibitory activity 
against ATP synthase, and intracellular ATP content showed increasing tendency 
after galectin-3 suppression. Suppression of galectin-3 resulted in G0/G1 
progression of human colon cancer cells arrested at S, S/G2 and G2/M phase in 
the presence of doxorubicin, and etoposide or nocodazole, respectively. Compared 
to cells in which ATP synthase d-subunit was suppressed alone, sub-G1 fraction 
caused by etoposide or nocodazole was decreased in cells with galectin-3 
suppression alone. In conclusion, galectin-3 co-localized with ATP synthase in 
the inner membrane of mitochondria and has an inhibitory effect on ATP synthase 
in human colon cancer cells. In the presence of cell cycle synchronizing drugs, 
doxorubicin, etoposide, or nocodazole, suppression of galectin-3 induced cell 
cycle progression to G0/G1 phase.
