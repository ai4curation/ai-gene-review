Although much has been learned recently of the mechanisms that regulate 
osteoclastic differentiation, much less is known of the means through which 
their resorptive activity is controlled. This is especially so for human 
osteoclasts. We have recently developed an assay that allows us to measure 
resorptive activity while minimizing confounding effects on differentiation by 
optimizing osteoclastogenesis, so that measurable resorption occurs over a short 
period, and by relating resorption in each culture during the test period to the 
resorption that had occurred in the same culture in a prior control period. In 
the present study, we found that RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor 
kappaB ligand) strongly stimulated the release of CTX-I (C-terminal telopeptide 
degradation product of type I collagen) by osteoclasts over a similar range to 
that over which it induces osteoclastic differentiation, consistent with a 
distinct action on osteoclastic function. CT (calcitonin) dose-dependently 
inhibited bone resorption, whereas PTH (parathyroid hormone), IL 
(interleukin)-1, TNF-alpha (tumour necrosis factor-alpha), IL-6, IL-8, VEGF 
(vascular endothelial growth factor), MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant 
protein-1), MIP-1gamma (macrophage inflammatory protein-1gamma), IFN 
(interferon)-gamma and dibutyryl cGMP had no significant effect. Ca(2+), 
cyclosporin A, IFN-beta and dibutyryl cAMP all strongly suppressed resorption. 
Bone resorption was also strongly suppressed by alendronate, the cysteine 
protease inhibitor E64 and the cathepsin K inhibitor MV061194. Inhibitors of 
MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) had no effect on CTX-I release. Moreover, the 
release of the MMP-derived collagen fragment ICTP (C-terminal cross-linked 
telopeptide of type I collagen) represented less that 0.01% of the quantity of 
CTX-I released in our cultures. This suggests that MMPs make, at most, a very 
small contribution to the bone-resorptive activity of osteoclasts.
