The proapoptotic BCL-2 family member BAD resides in a glucokinase-containing 
complex that regulates glucose-driven mitochondrial respiration. Here, we 
present genetic evidence of a physiologic role for BAD in glucose-stimulated 
insulin secretion by beta cells. This novel function of BAD is specifically 
dependent upon the phosphorylation of its BH3 sequence, previously defined as an 
essential death domain. We highlight the pharmacologic relevance of 
phosphorylated BAD BH3 by using cell-permeable, hydrocarbon-stapled BAD BH3 
helices that target glucokinase, restore glucose-driven mitochondrial 
respiration and correct the insulin secretory response in Bad-deficient islets. 
Our studies uncover an alternative target and function for the BAD BH3 domain 
and emphasize the therapeutic potential of phosphorylated BAD BH3 mimetics in 
selectively restoring beta cell function. Furthermore, we show that BAD 
regulates the physiologic adaptation of beta cell mass during high-fat feeding. 
Our findings provide genetic proof of the bifunctional activities of BAD in both 
beta cell survival and insulin secretion.
