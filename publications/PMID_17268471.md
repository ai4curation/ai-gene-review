DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that is essential for gene 
silencing and genome stability in many organisms. Although methyltransferases 
that promote DNA methylation are well characterized, the molecular mechanism 
underlying active DNA demethylation is poorly understood and controversial. Here 
we show that Gadd45a (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45 alpha), 
a nuclear protein involved in maintenance of genomic stability, DNA repair and 
suppression of cell growth, has a key role in active DNA demethylation. Gadd45a 
overexpression activates methylation-silenced reporter plasmids and promotes 
global DNA demethylation. Gadd45a knockdown silences gene expression and leads 
to DNA hypermethylation. During active demethylation of oct4 in Xenopus laevis 
oocytes, Gadd45a is specifically recruited to the site of demethylation. Active 
demethylation occurs by DNA repair and Gadd45a interacts with and requires the 
DNA repair endonuclease XPG. We conclude that Gadd45a relieves epigenetic gene 
silencing by promoting DNA repair, which erases methylation marks.
