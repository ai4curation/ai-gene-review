The origin recognition complex (ORC) marks chromosomal positions as replication 
origins and is essential for replication initiation. At a few loci, the ORC 
functions in heterochromatin formation. We show that the ORC's two roles at the 
heterochromatic HMRa locus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were regulated by 
differences in the ORC's interaction with its target site. At HMRa, a strong 
ORC-DNA interaction inhibited and delayed replication initiation but promoted 
heterochromatin formation, whereas a weak ORC-DNA interaction allowed for 
increased and earlier replication initiation but reduced heterochromatin 
formation. Therefore, the ORC's interaction with its target site could modulate 
ORC activity within a heterochromatin domain in vivo.
