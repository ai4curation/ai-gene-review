Survivin is a protein with proposed roles in cell division and apoptosis. 
Transcripts encoding splice variants of human survivin have been described and 
their expression correlated with cancer progression. As survivin forms 
homodimers in vitro, it has been suggested that these isoforms could interfere 
with wild type function by forming heterodimers. Here we show that 
survivin-2beta and survivin-deltaEx3 can interact with wild type survivin but 
have reduced affinity for the partner protein of survivin, borealin, and thus do 
not localize with the chromosomal passenger complex in vivo. Furthermore, we 
demonstrate that overexpression of survivin-2beta-green fluorescent protein 
(GFP) or survivin-deltaEx3-GFP does not impede cell cycle progression. We also 
report that wild type survivin, but not survivin-2beta-GFP or 
survivin-deltaEx3-GFP, can rescue cell proliferation inhibited by small 
interfering RNA-mediated survivin depletion. These data suggest that, despite 
their ability to interact with wild type survivin, neither of these isoforms 
acts as its competitor during mitosis nor has an essential function.
