The cellular levels of the Myc oncoprotein are critical determinants of cell 
proliferation, cell growth and apoptosis and are tightly regulated by external 
growth factors. Levels of Myc oncoprotein also decline in response to 
intracellular stress signals such as DNA damage. We show here that this decline 
is in part due to proteasomal degradation and that it is mediated by the Fbw7 
ubiquitin ligase. We have shown previously that the ubiquitin-specific protease 
Usp28, binds to the nucleoplasmic isoform of Fbw7, Fbw7alpha, and counteracts 
its function in mammalian cells. Usp28 dissociates from Fbw7alpha in response to 
UV irradiation, providing a mechanism how Fbw7-mediated degradation of Myc is 
enhanced upon DNA damage. Our data extend previous observations that link Myc 
function to the cellular response to DNA damage.
