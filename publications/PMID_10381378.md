The yeast Sir2 protein regulates epigenetic gene silencing and as a possible 
antiaging effect it suppresses recombination of rDNA. Studies involving cobB, a 
bacterial SIR2-like gene, have suggested it could encode a pyridine nucleotide 
transferase. Here five human sirtuin cDNAs are characterized. The SIRT1 sequence 
has the closest homology to the S. cerevisiae Sir2p. The SIRT4 and SIRT5 
sirtuins more closely resemble prokaryotic sirtuin sequences. The five human 
sirtuins are widely expressed in fetal and adult tissues. Recombinant E. coli 
cobT and cobB proteins each showed a weak NAD-dependent 
mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity using 5, 6-dimethylbenzimidazole as a 
substrate. Recombinant E. coli cobB and human SIRT2 sirtuin proteins were able 
to cause radioactivity to be transferred from [32P]NAD to bovine serum albumin 
(BSA). When a conserved histidine within the human SIRT2 sirtuin was converted 
to a tyrosine, the mutant recombinant protein was unable to transfer 
radioactivity from [32P]NAD to BSA. These results suggest that the sirtuins may 
function via mono-ADP-ribosylation of proteins.
