Ataxin-2 is a novel protein, where the unstable expansion of an internal 
polyglutamine domain can cause the neurodegenerative disease Spinocerebellar 
Ataxia type 2 (SCA2). To elucidate its cellular function, we have used 
full-length ataxin-2 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of human adult brain 
cDNA. As binding partners we found endophilin A1 and A3, two brain-expressed 
members of the endophilin A family involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. 
Co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed the binding of these proteins as an 
endogenous complex in mouse brain. In vitro binding experiments narrowed the 
binding interfaces down to two proline-rich domains on ataxin-2, which 
interacted with the SH3 domain of endophilin A1/A3. Ataxin-2 and endophilin 
associated at the endoplasmic reticulum as well as at the plasma membrane as 
determined by immunofluorescence microscopy of transfected cell lines, and by 
centrifugation fractionation studies of mouse brain. Importantly, the pattern 
observed in transfected cells was conserved in rat hippocampal neurons. In the 
mouse brain, an association of ataxin-2 with endocytic proteins such as the 
adaptor CIN85 and the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl was also demonstrated. GST 
pull-down assays showed ataxin-2 to directly interact with the SH3 domains A and 
C of CIN85 and with the SH3 domain of Src, a kinase activated after receptor 
stimulation. Functional studies demonstrated that ataxin-2 affects endocytic 
trafficking of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Taken together, 
these data implicate ataxin-2 to play a role in endocytic receptor cycling.
