Self-templating amyloid forms of Sup35 constitute the yeast prion [PSI(+)]. How 
the protein-remodelling factor, Hsp104, collaborates with other chaperones to 
regulate [PSI(+)] inheritance remains poorly delineated. Here, we report how the 
Ssa and Ssb components of the Hsp70 chaperone system directly affect Sup35 
prionogenesis and cooperate with Hsp104. We identify the ribosome-associated 
Ssb1:Zuo1:Ssz1 complex as a potent antagonist of Sup35 prionogenesis. The Hsp40 
chaperones, Sis1 and Ydj1, preferentially interact with Sup35 oligomers and 
fibres compared with monomers, and facilitate Ssa1 and Ssb1 binding. Various 
Hsp70:Hsp40 pairs block prion nucleation by disassembling molten oligomers and 
binding mature oligomers. By binding fibres, Hsp70:Hsp40 pairs occlude prion 
recognition elements and inhibit seeded assembly. These inhibitory activities 
are partially relieved by the nucleotide exchange factor, Fes1. Low levels of 
Hsp104 stimulate prionogenesis and alleviate inhibition by some Hsp70:Hsp40 
pairs. At high concentrations, Hsp104 eliminates Sup35 prions. This activity is 
reduced when Ssa1, or enhanced when Ssb1, is incorporated into nascent prions. 
These findings illuminate several facets of the chaperone interplay that 
underpins [PSI(+)] inheritance.
