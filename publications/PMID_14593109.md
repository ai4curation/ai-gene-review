Modification by ubiquitin plays a major role in a broad array of cellular 
functions. Although reversal of this process, deubiquitination, likely 
represents an important regulatory step contributing to cellular homeostasis, 
functions of deubiquitination enzymes still remain poorly characterized. We have 
previously shown that the ubiquitin protease Ubp3p requires a co-factor, Bre5p, 
to specifically deubiquitinate the coat protein complex II (COPII) subunit 
Sec23p, which is involved in anterograde transport between endoplasmic reticulum 
and Golgi compartments. In the present report, we show that disruption of BRE5 
gene also led to a defect in the retrograde transport from the Golgi to the 
endoplasmic reticulum. Further analysis indicate that the COPI subunit beta'-COP 
represents another substrate of the Ubp3p.Bre5p complex. All together, our 
results indicate that the Ubp3p.Bre5p deubiquitination complex co-regulates 
anterograde and retrograde transports between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi 
compartments.
