The J-domain co-chaperones work together with the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) 
chaperone to regulate many cellular events, but the mechanism underlying the 
J-domain-mediated HSP70 function remains elusive. We studied the interaction 
between human-inducible HSP70 and Homo sapiens J-domain protein (HSJ1a), a J 
domain and UIM motif-containing co-chaperone. The J domain of HSJ1a shares a 
conserved structure with other J domains from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic 
species, and it mediates the interaction with and the ATPase cycle of HSP70. Our 
in vitro study corroborates that the N terminus of HSP70 including the ATPase 
domain and the substrate-binding β-subdomain is not sufficient to bind with the 
J domain of HSJ1a. The C-terminal helical α-subdomain of HSP70, which was 
considered to function as a lid of the substrate-binding domain, is crucial for 
binding with the J domain of HSJ1a and stimulating the ATPase activity of HSP70. 
These fluctuating helices are likely to contribute to a proper conformation of 
HSP70 for J-domain binding other than directly bind with the J domain. Our 
findings provide an alternative mechanism of allosteric activation for 
functional regulation of HSP70 by its J-domain co-chaperones.
