Repression of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana requires activity of 
the COP9 signalosome (CSN), CDD, and COP1 complexes, but how these three 
complexes work in concert to accomplish this important developmental switch has 
remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis CULLIN4 (CUL4) 
associates with the CDD complex and a common catalytic subunit to form an active 
E3 ubiquitin ligase both in vivo and in vitro. The partial loss of function of 
CUL4 resulted in a constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype with respect to 
morphogenesis and light-regulated gene expression. Furthermore, CUL4 exhibits a 
synergistic genetic interaction with COP10 and DET1. Therefore, this CUL4-based 
E3 ligase is essential for the repression of photomorphogenesis. This CUL4-based 
E3 ligase appears to associate physically with COP1 E3 ligase and positively 
regulates the COP1-dependent degradation of photomorphogenesis-promoting 
transcription factors, whereas the CSN controls the biochemical modification of 
CUL4 essential for E3 activity. Thus, this study suggests a biochemical activity 
connection between CSN and CDD complexes in their cooperation with COP1 in 
orchestrating the repression of photomorphogenesis.

Abstract

Repression of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana requires activity of the COP9 signalosome (CSN), CDD, and COP1 complexes, but how these three complexes work in concert to accomplish this important developmental switch has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis CULLIN4 (CUL4) associates with the CDD complex and a common catalytic subunit to form an active E3 ubiquitin ligase both in vivo and in vitro. The partial loss of function of CUL4 resulted in a constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype with respect to morphogenesis and light-regulated gene expression. Furthermore, CUL4 exhibits a synergistic genetic interaction with COP10 and DET1. Therefore, this CUL4-based E3 ligase is essential for the repression of photomorphogenesis. This CUL4-based E3 ligase appears to associate physically with COP1 E3 ligase and positively regulates the COP1-dependent degradation of photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription factors, whereas the CSN controls the biochemical modification of CUL4 essential for E3 activity. Thus, this study suggests a biochemical activity connection between CSN and CDD complexes in their cooperation with COP1 in orchestrating the repression of photomorphogenesis.

INTRODUCTION

Light provides critical cues for plant development. In Arabidopsis thaliana , seedlings follow drastically different developmental patterns in the presence or absence of light. Light-grown seedlings exhibit photomorphogenic development with short hypocotyls and open and expanded cotyledons. By contrast, dark-grown seedlings show skotomorphogenic development characterized by long hypocotyls, closed and unexpanded cotyledons, and apical hooks ( von Arnim and Deng, 1996 ).

The ubiquitin–proteasome system, a common proteolysis mechanism for regulating protein degradation in all eukaryotes, has been shown to play a major role in the light control of development ( Sullivan et al., 2003 ). The ubiquitin–proteasome system consists of two major components: the 26S proteasome responsible for the degradation of protein substrates tagged by a specific kind of polyubiquitin chain, and the ubiquitination machinery that specifically attaches a single ubiquitin or a polyubiquitin chain to a substrate. This ubiquitination system consists of a cascade mediated by three enzymes, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin conjugase (E2), and a ubiquitin–protein ligase (E3). The specificity of the ubiquitin–proteasome system usually relies on the E3 ligase, and all eukaryotes possess a large number of E3 ubiquitin ligases that target distinct sets of substrate proteins. There are several known E3 ligase families, the largest of which comprises multiple groups of E3 ligases defined by distinct yet related forms of scaffolding proteins known as cullins. All cullin-based E3 ligases contain a common catalytic subunit, RBX1.

Genetic analysis of light-regulated Arabidopsis seedling development has revealed a group of pleiotropic Constitutive Photomorphogenic/De-etoliated/Fusca (COP/DET/FUS) proteins as central regulators of photomorphogenic development ( Sullivan et al., 2003 ; Yi and Deng, 2005 ). Initially isolated by screening for repressors of photomorphogenesis in darkness ( Wei and Deng, 1996 ), these regulatory proteins were later shown to play a crucial role in the ubiquitin–proteasome-mediated degradation of photomorphogenesis-promoting factors ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ; Yi and Deng, 2005 ). This group of proteins carries out their functions as part of three biochemical entities: the COP1 complex, the COP9 signalosome (CSN), and the CDD (for COP10, DDB1a, and DET1) complex.

The first of these proteins to be defined molecularly, COP1 has been shown to localize in the nucleus in darkness, whereas light reduces its nuclear abundance ( Deng et al., 1992 ; von Arnim and Deng, 1994 ). COP1 forms an ∼700-kD complex in vivo ( Saijo et al., 2003 ), which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to catalyze the ubiquitination of several photomorphogenesis-promoting factors, designating them as targets for proteasome-mediated degradation ( Yi and Deng, 2005 ). These factors include at least four known transcription factors (HY5 [ Osterlund et al., 2000 ; Saijo et al., 2003 ], HYH [ Holm et al., 2002 ], LAF1 [ Seo et al., 2003 ], and HFR1 [ Duek et al., 2004 ; Jang et al., 2005 ; Yang et al., 2005 ]). COP1 functions as a key rate-limiting enzyme in the repression pathway ( McNellis et al., 1996 ) and provides a point of convergence for cryptochrome and phytochrome-mediated specific light responses ( Wang et al., 2001 ; Yang et al., 2005 ; Yi and Deng, 2005 ).

The CSN is a nucleus-enriched complex consisting of eight distinct subunits. Six of those subunits are genetically defined COP/DET/FUS proteins, and the other two are encoded by families of two genes each ( Serino and Deng, 2003 ). The CSN is known to interact with CULLIN1 (CUL1)-based E3 ligases to deconjugate Nedd8/Rub from cullins ( Lyapina et al., 2001 ; Schwechheimer et al., 2001 ). In csn mutants as well as in other cop/det/fus mutants, COP1 is depleted in the nucleus compared with the wild type in darkness, which suggests that the CSN and other COP/DET/FUS proteins play important roles in COP1 nuclear import and/or retention in the dark ( Chamovitz et al., 1996 ; von Arnim et al., 1997 ).

The CDD complex comprises COP10, DET1, and DDB1a ( Yanagawa et al., 2004 ). DET1 is a 62-kD nuclear protein lacking any known functional domain and has been shown to associate with DDB1a ( Schroeder et al., 2002 ). COP10 encodes a small ubiquitin E2 variant protein, and both COP10 itself and the CDD complex are known to enhance the activity of several E2s ( Yanagawa et al., 2004 ). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments have indicated that the CDD complex is able to associate with COP1 and the CSN in vivo, suggesting that the three complexes may act together to regulate the ubiquitin–proteasome-mediated degradation of photomorphogenesis-promoting factors ( Yanagawa et al., 2004 ). However, how the individual biochemical activities of those three complexes work in concert has remained unknown.

CUL4 is a distinct member of the cullin family of proteins that is highly conserved across eukaryotic organisms. Orthologs of CUL4 exist in fission yeast, worms, flies, plants, and mammals. CUL4 loss-of-function mutants are characterized by cell elongation and decondensation of chromosomes in fission yeast ( Osaka et al., 2000 ) and massive DNA replication in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos ( Zhong et al., 2003 ). Deletion of CUL4A leads to lethality in mice at the early embryo stage ( Li et al., 2002 ). CUL4 has been shown to bind RBX1, the common catalytic subunit associated with all cullin-based E3 ligases, to form the core for a family of CUL4-based ligases ( Higa et al., 2003 ; Jia et al., 2005 ). In the case of several known CUL4-based E3 ligases, distinct DDB1-containing complexes associate with the CUL4-RBX1 core to form functional E3 ligases ( Groisman et al., 2003 ; Hu et al., 2004 ; Wertz et al., 2004 ) and are thought to be responsible for recruiting their substrates ( Hu et al., 2004 ). For example, two distinct DDB1-containing protein complexes have been associated with CUL4-based E3 ligases in mammalian DNA repair pathways ( Groisman et al., 2003 ). Similarly, recent evidence has shown that DDB1, DET1, and COP1 can work together as part of a CUL4-based E3 ligase to regulate the ubiquitination and degradation of the transcription factor c-Jun in mammalian cells ( Wertz et al., 2004 ). CUL4 is present in Arabidopsis , but it has remained functionally undefined until now. Because both DDB1 and DET1, together with COP10, are present in the same CDD complex ( Yanagawa et al., 2004 ), it is of interest to know whether a CUL4-RBX1-CDD E3 ligase is present in Arabidopsis and whether it plays a role in photomorphogenesis.

Here, we report the presence of CUL4-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes in Arabidopsis and reveal that at least one such complex contains RBX1 and the CDD complex. In vitro reconstitution experiments demonstrate that CUL4-RBX1 can bind the CDD complex, and together they possess ubiquitin ligase activity. Functional analysis suggests that this CUL4-based E3 is essential for repressing photomorphogenesis, possibly by positively regulating COP1-dependent events. Therefore, this CUL4-based E3 ligase plays a central role in repressing photomorphogenesis and links together the biochemical activities of the CSN and CDD complexes.

Reduction of CUL4 Abundance Results in Constitutive Photomorphogenesis inArabidopsisSeedlings

If the CDD complex acts through the CUL4-RBX1-CDD E3 ligase to achieve its repression of photomorphogenesis, it is plausible that CUL4 reduction or loss of function would result in a constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype similar to that of mutations in the CDD complex components COP10 and DET1. As a first step to test this notion, we introduced the flag-fused CUL4 ectopic expression transgene and CUL4 RNA interference (RNAi) constructs under the control of 35S promoters into wild-type Arabidopsis to generate stable transgenic plants with altered CUL4 protein levels. Interestingly, 10 of the 18 flag-CUL4 transgenic lines we obtained exhibited varying degrees of the constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype in their T2 and subsequent progeny, with opening and expansion of cotyledons as well as a variation in the length of the hypocotyls when grown in the dark ( Figures 2C and 5A ). When grown in the light, these same lines yielded hyperphotomorphogenic seedlings with high levels of anthocyanin, similar to the pleiotropic cop / det / fus mutants ( Figure 5B ). We also obtained a large number of constitutive photomorphogenic seedlings in the primary screen of constitutive CUL4 RNAi transgenic plants in the T1 generation ( Figures 5A and 5B ). However, these RNAi seedlings were lethal after the seedling stage and all failed to produce seeds.

Immunoblot analysis was used to examine CUL4 protein levels in the 35S:flag-CUL4 transgenic lines with or without a cop -like phenotype. As shown in Figure 2C , all 10 lines expressing a cop -like phenotype (such as lines 1, 2, 7, and 8) have reduced levels of CUL4 (the endogenous CUL4 together with the flag-CUL4 fusion protein). All of the lines lacking a cop -like phenotype expressed the endogenous CUL4 together with a flag-CUL4 fusion protein at approximately the endogenous CUL4 levels in wild-type Arabidopsis (such as lines 10 and 13). This correlation of the cop -like phenotype and reduced CUL4 protein level was maintained in the subsequent generation, with some progeny exhibiting higher CUL4 abundance and loss of the cop -like phenotype. Thus, the cop -like phenotype seems to be a consequence of transgene-mediated cosuppression of CUL4, and lines with this phenotype were designated CUL4 cosuppression ( cul4cs ) lines. Changes in protein abundance in these transgenic lines appear to be limited to CUL4, because the levels of CUL1 and other tested proteins were unchanged and independent of the cop- like phenotype ( Figure 2C ).

Cosuppression of CUL4 Results in Increased Gene Expression of Light-Inducible Genes in Darkness

We further examined the effect of CUL4 cosuppression on light-inducible gene expression in dark-grown cul4cs seedlings. The mRNA levels of four representative light-regulated nucleus- and plastid-encoded genes were examined by RNA gel blot analysis. As shown in Figure 5C , these four representative genes are all expressed at higher levels in dark-grown cul4cs seedlings compared with their wild-type counterparts, similar to the cop1-4 mutants. This result indicates that, as in the cop / det / fus mutations, inhibition of CUL4 function also leads to constitutive expression of light-inducible genes in darkness.

Reduction of CUL4 Function Results in Synergistic Enhancement of thecop10anddet1Weak Mutant Phenotypes

To further substantiate the functional role of CUL4 in repressing photomorphogenic development, we tested anticipated genetic interactions between CUL4 and COP10 and DET1. Therefore, we introduced the cosuppressing trait cul4cs ( Figure 2C , line 2) into cop10-4 and det1-1 mutants, both of which are nonlethal and weak alleles. Remarkably, the dark-grown double mutants cul4cs cop10-4 and cul4cs det1-1 have a much more exaggerated photomorphogenic phenotype than either of their parental single mutants ( Figure 5D ). In the case of cul4cs det1-1 , the double mutant phenotypes essentially mimic those of the det1 null mutants. These data strongly suggest that CUL4 works together with COP10 and DET1 in mediating the repression of photomorphogenesis in darkness.

DISCUSSION

This work provides the biochemical and functional analysis of Arabidopsis CUL4 and describes a biochemical mechanism for the coordinated regulation of photomorphogenesis. Since the first COP/DET/FUS protein was identified in 1989 ( Chory et al., 1989 ), many proteins and their associated complexes have been identified and characterized, but how all are choreographed to accomplish the light-regulated developmental switch has remained a matter of speculation. Our data show that an E3 ligase, which comprises Arabidopsis CUL4, RBX1, and the CDD complex, plays an essential and central role in repressing photomorphogenesis through biochemical interactions with CSN and COP1. We further show that Arabidopsis CUL4 may be involved in many other developmental processes in addition to the repression of photomorphogenesis.
