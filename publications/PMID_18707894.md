Histone acetylation plays important roles for the regulation of many fundamental 
cellular processes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rtt109 is an important class of 
histone acetyltransferases (HATs), which promote genome stability by directly 
acetylating newly synthesized histone H3 lysine 56 (H3-K56) through an unknown 
mechanism. Here, we report the crystal structures of Rtt109 at 2.2 A and 
Rtt109/Acetyl-CoA binary complex at 1.9 A. The structure displays a vise-like 
topology with mixed three-layered alpha/beta module forming the central module, 
whose core region resembles the structure of GCN5 HAT domain and P300/CBP HAT 
domain. Using structural and biochemical analyses, we have discovered the 
catalytic active site and have identified Asp288 as the deprotonation residue 
and Lys290 as the autoacetylation residue. We have further proposed the unique 
H3-K56 anchoring pocket and the potential H3alphaN binding groove. Our work has 
provided structural insights to understand the acetylation mechanism of H3-K56 
by Rtt109.
