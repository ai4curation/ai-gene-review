Seed germination is regulated by endogenous hormonal cues and external 
environmental stimuli such as water, low temperature, and light. After 
germination, the young seedling must rapidly establish its root system and the 
photoautotrophic capability appropriate to its surrounding environment. Light 
and the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) both regulate seed germination and 
seedling development, although how light and ABA signals are integrated at the 
molecular level is not understood. Here, we found that the previously described 
light-signaling component HY5 also mediates ABA response in seed germination, 
early seedling growth, and root development in Arabidopsis. HY5 binds to the 
promoter of the transcription factor ABI5 gene with high affinity and is 
required for the expression of ABI5 and ABI5-targeted late 
embryogenesis-abundant genes in seeds. Chromatin immunoprecipitation also 
indicated that the binding of HY5 to the ABI5 promoter is significantly enhanced 
by ABA. Overexpression of ABI5 restores ABA sensitivity in hy5 and results in 
enhanced light responses and shorter hypocotyls in the wild type. Our studies 
identified an unexpected mode of light and ABA signal integration that may help 
young seedlings better adapt to environmental stresses.

Abstract

Seed germination is regulated by endogenous hormonal cues and external environmental stimuli such as water, low temperature, and light. After germination, the young seedling must rapidly establish its root system and the photoautotrophic capability appropriate to its surrounding environment. Light and the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) both regulate seed germination and seedling development, although how light and ABA signals are integrated at the molecular level is not understood. Here, we found that the previously described light-signaling component HY5 also mediates ABA response in seed germination, early seedling growth, and root development in Arabidopsis . HY5 binds to the promoter of the transcription factor ABI5 gene with high affinity and is required for the expression of ABI5 and ABI5-targeted late embryogenesis-abundant genes in seeds. Chromatin immunoprecipitation also indicated that the binding of HY5 to the ABI5 promoter is significantly enhanced by ABA. Overexpression of ABI5 restores ABA sensitivity in hy5 and results in enhanced light responses and shorter hypocotyls in the wild type. Our studies identified an unexpected mode of light and ABA signal integration that may help young seedlings better adapt to environmental stresses.

Discussion

Based on the insensitivity of hy5 mutants to light inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, HY5 was defined as a positive regulator downstream of diverse photoreceptors in the light signal transduction pathway ( 16 , 27 , 28 ). Interestingly, hy5 mutants also have more lateral roots and these lateral roots grow more horizontally ( 17 ). Because drought stress and ABA inhibit lateral root elongation ( 13 – 15 ), we examined whether HY5 is involved in ABA-mediated inhibition of lateral root growth. Whereas ABA clearly represses lateral root growth in the wild type, it is much less effective in hy5 . Thus, wild-type HY5 is required for this ABA response ( Fig. 1 A and C ). Furthermore, the hy5 mutant seeds are less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of ABA, high salt, or glucose on seed germination ( Fig. 2 ), indicating that HY5 partly mediates these ABA responses as well. Perhaps as a result of the impaired ABA response, hy5 seedlings were more sensitive in growth to salt and osmotic stress ( Fig. 1 D and E ). Nonetheless, hy5 leaves did not exhibit any transpiration defects and the guard cell ABA responsiveness is unaltered (data not shown), which implies that either HY5 does not modulate ABA-induced stomata movement or that HY5 is not involved in the ABA response of mature plants.

Besides its role in photomorphogenesis, recent research also suggests that HY5 is involved in the activation of a subset of UV-B responsive genes. One of the down-regulated genes in hy5 under UV-B stress is DREB2A ( 29 ), a well characterized ABA- and drought-inducible gene. Our results also demonstrate that hy5 mutants are defective in the accumulation of LEAs and ABI5 mRNAs in mature seeds and ABA induction of RD29B in young seedlings ( Fig. 3 A and B ). Given that HY5 and its homolog HYH redundantly regulate target genes' transcription ( 30 , 31 ), it is not unexpected that only a limited number of ABA-responsive genes were altered in their expression in hy5 young seedlings ( Fig. 3 A and data not shown). Indeed, transcript levels of several ABA-inducible genes including a dehydrin, a MYB-related gene, RD20 , COR47 , and LTI29 are greatly reduced in hy5-hyh double mutant compared with single mutants where little reduction in the transcript levels of these genes was detected ( 30 ). The alteration of ABA responsive genes' transcription in hy5 or hy5-hyh mutant strongly suggests that HY5 may play critical roles in ABA signaling.

Intriguingly, genes with diminished accumulation in hy5 seeds and young seedlings appear to be either direct or indirect targets of ABI5. In previous studies, ABI5 protein was shown to be able to activate the promoters of AtEM1 , AtEM6 , and RD29B in transient transcription assays ( 6 , 32 ). These genes may be the direct targets of ABI5. On the other hand, although there was no direct evidence for the activation of RAB18 transcription by ABI5, RAB18 mRNA level is down-regulated in abi5 mutant ( 19 ). Coincident with reduced transcript levels of these ABI5 target genes, the steady-state mRNA level of ABI5 was significantly reduced in hy5 seeds ( Fig. 3 B ). Moreover, ABI5 :: GUS activities were much lower in hy5 than in wild type under both normal or stress conditions ( Fig. 4 ). Therefore, the decreased transcript levels of these ABA-responsive genes in hy5 are most likely caused by the down-regulated ABI5 expression in the mutant. The fact that ABA insensitivity of hy5 mutants could be restored by ectopically expressing ABI5 ( Fig. 5 B–E ) supports this notion. Importantly, HY5 can bind the ABI5 promoter in vitro and in vivo with high specificity ( Fig. 3 D–G ). This result is consistent with a recent ChIP–Chip study that showed that the ABI5 promoter was among the putative binding sites of HY5 ( 21 ). ABA enhancement of HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter ( Fig. 3 G ) further suggests that HY5 is very likely a transcriptional activator of ABI5 expression in response to developmental and environmental cues.

Recently, it was reported that seeds in shallow soil could sense light through phytochrome B to down-regulate ABI3 and promote hypocotyl growth ( 33 ). Our results demonstrate that overexpression of ABI5 inhibits hypocotyl elongation under blue, red, or far-red light ( Fig. 5 F–H ). Interestingly, the rpn10 and keg mutants, which stabilize the ABI5 protein, exhibit a decreased hypocotyl growth as well ( 34 , 35 ). Thus, ABA may enhance seedling light response and inhibit hypocotyl elongation, which may confer increased resistance to drought and other stresses. In fact, drought and ABA inhibition of hypocotyl elongation has been documented, although the mechanism was previously unknown ( 36 ). Recent studies showed that light could affect ABA metabolism in germinating seeds ( 37 , 38 ). Our study demonstrates that light also positively regulates ABA signaling through the HY5-ABI5 regulon that may facilitate seedling establishment under abiotic stress.
