The extent of proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into 
neurotoxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is central to the pathology of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Accordingly, modifiers that increase Aβ production rates are risk 
factors in the sporadic form of AD. In a novel systems biology approach, we 
combined quantitative biochemical studies with mathematical modelling to 
establish a kinetic model of amyloidogenic processing, and to evaluate the 
influence by SORLA/SORL1, an inhibitor of APP processing and important genetic 
risk factor. Contrary to previous hypotheses, our studies demonstrate that 
secretases represent allosteric enzymes that require cooperativity by APP 
oligomerization for efficient processing. Cooperativity enables swift adaptive 
changes in secretase activity with even small alterations in APP concentration. 
We also show that SORLA prevents APP oligomerization both in cultured cells and 
in the brain in vivo, eliminating the preferred form of the substrate and 
causing secretases to switch to a less efficient non-allosteric mode of action. 
These data represent the first mathematical description of the contribution of 
genetic risk factors to AD substantiating the relevance of subtle changes in 
SORLA levels for amyloidogenic processing as proposed for patients carrying 
SORL1 risk alleles.
