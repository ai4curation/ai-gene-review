Sigma receptor is a protein that interacts with a variety of psychotomimetic 
drugs including cocaine and amphetamines and is believed to play an important 
role in the cellular functions of various tissues associated with the endocrine, 
immune, and nervous systems. Here we report on the structure and organization of 
the human gene coding for this receptor. The gene is approximately 7 kbp long 
and contains four exons, interrupted by three introns. Exon 3 is the shortest 
(93 bp), and exon 4 is the longest (1,132 bp). Among the introns, intron 3 is 
the longest (approximately 1,250 bp). Exon 2 codes for the single transmembrane 
domain present in the receptor. 5' rapid amplification of cDNA end reactions 
with mRNA from the JAR human trophoblast cell line have identified 56 bp 
upstream of the translation start codon as the initiation site for 
transcription. This transcription start site has been confirmed by RNase 
protection analysis. Structural analysis of the 5' flanking region has revealed 
that the gene is TATA-less. This region, however, contains a CCAATC box in the 
reverse complement and several GC boxes that are recognition sites for SP1. 
There are also consensus sequences for the liver-specific transcription factor 
nuclear factor-1/L, for a variety of cytokine responsive factors, and for the 
xenobiotic responsive factor called the arylhydrocarbon receptor. Southern blot 
analysis of the genomic DNA from Chinese hamster-human and mouse-human hybrid 
cell lines and fluorescent in situ hybridization with human metaphase chromosome 
spreads have shown that the gene is located on human chromosome 9, band p13, a 
region known to be associated with different psychiatric disorders.
