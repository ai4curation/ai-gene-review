The intracellular localization of the S. cerevisiae transcription factor SWI5 is 
cell cycle dependent. The protein is nuclear in G1 cells but cytoplasmic in S, 
G2, and M phase cells. We have identified SWI5's nuclear localization signal 
(NLS) and show that it can confer cell cycle-dependent nuclear entry to a 
heterologous protein. Located within or close to the NLS are three serine 
residues, mutation of which results in constitutive nuclear entry. These 
residues are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner in vivo, being 
phosphorylated when SWI5 is in the cytoplasm and dephosphorylated when it is in 
the nucleus. As all three serines are phosphorylated by purified CDC28-dependent 
H1 kinase activity in vitro, we propose a model in which the CDC28 kinase acts 
directly to control nuclear entry of SWI5.
