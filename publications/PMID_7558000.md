The promoter/5' flank sequence, cDNA sequence, and exon/intron structures of the 
human thrombospondin 3 (THBS3) gene have been determined. THBS3 cDNA clones were 
obtained by PCR amplification of human fetal lung cDNA using THBS3-specific 
primers. Analysis of cDNA and genomic sequences showed the THBS3 gene to be 
composed of 23 exons, 1 more than the number of exons in the previously 
characterized mouse TSP3 gene. The additional exon results from the division of 
mouse exon F into exons F1 and F2. The cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 956 amino 
acids that is highly acidic, with a clustering of acidic side chains in the 
third quarter of the polypeptide. This region corresponds to seven type III 
(Ca(2+)-binding) repeats, a feature shared with other thrombospondins. In 
addition to these type III repeats, four type II (EGF-like) repeats and NH2- and 
COOH-terminal domains are present in thrombospondin 3. The THBS3 and mouse TSP3 
genes differ in intron sizes, but exon sequences and sizes and positions of 
insertion of introns are conserved to a high degree. The structural organization 
of the THBS3 gene is of interest because of its close proximity to that of 
metaxin, with which it shares a common promoter sequence, and to the gene 
encoding glucocerebrosidase, a deficiency in which causes Gaucher disease.
