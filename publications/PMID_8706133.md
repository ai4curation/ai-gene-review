We describe the complete beta-tubulin folding pathway. Folding intermediates 
produced via ATP-dependent interaction with cytosolic chaperonin undergo a 
sequence of interactions with four proteins (cofactors A, D, E, and C). The 
postchaperonin steps in the reaction cascade do not depend on ATP or GTP 
hydrolysis, although GTP plays a structural role in tubulin folding. Cofactors A 
and D function by capturing and stabilizing beta-tubulin in a quasi-native 
conformation. Cofactor E binds to the cofactor D-beta-tubulin complex; 
interaction with cofactor C then causes the release of beta-tubulin polypeptides 
that are committed to the native state. Sequence analysis identifies yeast 
homologs of cofactors D (cin1) and E (pac2), characterized by mutations that 
affect microtubule function.
