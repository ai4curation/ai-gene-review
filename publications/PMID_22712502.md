Erythroid differentiation-associated gene (EDAG) is a haematopoietic 
tissue-specific transcription regulator that plays a key role in maintaining the 
homeostasis of haematopoietic lineage commitment. In acute myeloid leukaemia 
(AML) patients, the high expression level of EDAG is associated with poor 
prognosis. NPM1 (nucleophosmin/B23), a ubiquitous nucleolar phosphoprotein, 
comprises a multifunctional protein that is involved in several cellular 
processes, including ribosome biogenesis, centrosome duplication, cell cycle 
progression, cell growth and transformation. Various studies have implicated 
NPM1 overexpression in promoting tumour cell proliferation, blocking the 
differentiation of leukaemia cells and resisting apoptosis. In the present 
study, using co-immunoprecipitation, we characterized EDAG as a physiological 
binding partner of NPM1; The N-terminal (amino acids 1-124) region of EDAG 
interacts with the N-terminal (amino acids 118-187) of NPM1. Under cycloheximide 
treatment, the stability of NPM1 protein was enhanced by EDAG overexpression, 
whereas knockdown of EDAG by lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNA resulted 
in an increased degradation rate of NPM1 in K562 cells. During 4β-phorbol 
l2-myristate 13-acetate-induced K562 megakaryocytic differentiation, 
overexpression of EDAG prevented the down-regulation of NPM1 proteins, whereas 
knockdown of EDAG accelerated the down-regulation of NPM1. EDAG deletion mutant 
lacking the binding domain with NPM1 lost the ability to stabilize NPM1 protein. 
Furthermore, knockdown of EDAG in K562 cells led to increased cell apoptosis 
induced by imatinib, and re-expression of NPM1 attenuated the increased 
apoptosis. These results suggest that EDAG enhances the protein stability of 
NPM1 via binding to NPM1, which plays a critical role in the anti-apoptosis of 
leukaemia cells.
