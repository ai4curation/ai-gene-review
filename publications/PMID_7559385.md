Molecular chaperones, protein-disulfide isomerases, and peptidyl prolyl 
cis-trans isomerases assist protein folding in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. 
The DnaJ protein of Escherichia coli and the DnaJ-like proteins of eukaryotes 
are known as molecular chaperones and specific regulators of DnaK-like proteins 
and are involved in protein folding and renaturation after stress. In this study 
we show that DnaJ, like thioredoxin, protein-disulfide isomerase, and DsbA, 
possesses an active dithiol/disulfide group and catalyzes protein disulfide 
formation (oxidative renaturation of reduced RNase), reduction (reduction of 
insulin disulfides), and isomerization (refolding of randomly oxidized RNase). 
These results suggest that, in addition to its known function as a chaperone, 
DnaJ might be involved in controlling the redox state of cytoplasmic, membrane, 
or exported proteins.
