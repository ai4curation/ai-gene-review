The CD47 glycoprotein was isolated from human erythrocytes by 
immunoprecipitation using monoclonal antibody (mAb) BRIC-125. Enzymic 
deglycosylation of the protein showed it contained N-linked oligosaccharides, 
and trypsin proteolysis of the protein in situ in the erythrocyte membrane 
cleaved it into two portions, one of which was glycosylated. Both the intact 
protein and the glycosylated fragment had blocked N-termini. Amino acid sequence 
was obtained from several proteolytic fragments of CD47. Comparison with the 
sequence database showed the protein to be very similar to or identical with 
OA3, a multispanning membrane protein. The protein also appears to be the same 
as the integrin-associated protein, which has a role in cell adhesion in 
non-erythroid cells. CD47 has six potential N-glycosylation sites, five of which 
are in an Ig superfamily domain. We show that three of these sites carry 
N-glycans in erythrocytes. Immunocytochemical staining of human tissues showed 
that CD47 was broadly distributed on mesenchyme and epithelia at multiple sites. 
Reactivity was particularly prominent in surface and ductular epithelia, and in 
the brain. The possible roles of the CD47 glycoprotein are discussed.
