Src homology 3 (SH3) domains are globular protein interaction modules that 
regulate cell behavior. The classic SH3 ligand-binding site accommodates a 
hydrophobic PxxP motif and a positively charged specificity-determining residue. 
We have determined the NMR structure of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase 
substrate (IRTKS) SH3 domain in complex with a repeat from Escherichia 
coli-secreted protein F-like protein encoded on prophage U (EspF(U)), a 
translocated effector of enterohemorrhagic E. coli that commandeers the 
mammalian actin assembly machinery. EspF(U)-IRTKS interaction is among the 
highest affinity natural SH3 ligands. Our complex structure reveals a unique 
type of SH3 interaction based on recognition of tandem PxxP motifs in the 
ligand. Strikingly, the specificity pocket of IRTKS SH3 has evolved to 
accommodate a polyproline type II helical peptide analogously to docking of the 
canonical PxxP by the conserved IRTKS SH3 proline-binding pockets. This 
cooperative binding explains the high-affinity SH3 interaction and is required 
for EspF(U)-IRTKS interaction in mammalian cells as well as the formation of 
localized actin "pedestals" beneath bound bacteria. Importantly, tandem PxxP 
motifs are also found in mammalian ligands and have been shown to contribute to 
IRTKS SH3 recognition similarly.
