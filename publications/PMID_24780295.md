PURPOSE: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in 
cellular response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy through modulation of DNA 
repair. EGFR activates DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) stimulating repair 
of DNA strand breaks (SB) and interstrand crosslinks (ICL). We investigated the 
role of EGFR in repair of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced SB independently of 
DNA-PK.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The EGFR interactome was investigated via mass 
spectrometry. IR-induced EGFR-ERCC1 binding was validated biochemically and via 
proximity ligation assay in different cell lines including the M059K and M059J 
glioma cell lines, proficient and deficient for the expression of DNAPKcs, 
respectively. EGFR-ERCC1 functional significance following IR-induced SB was 
investigated in knockdown experiments with the Comet and γH2AX foci assays. The 
effect of this interaction was tested with EGFR-ERCC1 knockdown in combination 
with gefitinib and NU7026 using the MTT and apoptosis assays.
RESULTS: This study demonstrates that EGFR inhibition further impairs IR-induced 
DNA repair in cells lacking expression of DNAPKcs or in combination with the 
DNAPK inhibitor NU7026. Our data suggest a role for EGFR in DNA repair 
independent of DNAPKcs but dependent on ERCC1. Alkaline comet and γH2AX foci 
assays in cells depleted of EGFR, ERCC1, or EGFR-ERCC1 expression demonstrated 
involvement of this interaction in DNA repair. Cellular survival and apoptosis 
data correlate with levels of residual DNA damage underlying the importance of 
this complex following SB.
CONCLUSION: These data emphasize the importance of understanding the various 
mechanisms by which EGFR modulates DNA repair to optimize targeted therapy for 
patients with cancer.
