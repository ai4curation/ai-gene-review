Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) has many physiological functions 
and inhibits the differentiation of osteoblasts. Previously, we reported that 
TGF-beta1 stimulation induces the degradation of p57(KIP2) in osteoblasts. 
p57(KIP2) proteolysis depends on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and 
SMAD-mediated transcription; however, the molecular mechanism underlying 
p57(KIP2) degradation has been largely unknown. Here, we show that FBL12, a new 
F-box protein expressed in the limb bud of developing embryos, is involved in 
TGF-beta1-induced degradation of p57(KIP2). FBL12 formed an SCF(FBL12) complex 
and directly ubiquitinated p57(KIP2) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. 
Inhibition of FBL12 by RNA interference suppressed the degradation of p57(KIP2) 
and a dominant-negative mutant of FBL12 (FBL12DeltaF) increased the steady-state 
level of p57(KIP2). Furthermore, wild-type FBL12 inhibited and FBL12DeltaF 
promoted the differentiation of primary osteoblasts. As overexpression of 
p57(KIP2) promoted osteoblast differentiation, these results indicate the 
importance of FBL12 and the degradation of p57(KIP2) in the regulation of 
osteoblast cell differentiation.

Abstract

Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) has many physiological functions and inhibits the differentiation of osteoblasts. Previously, we reported that TGF-β1 stimulation induces the degradation of p57 KIP2 in osteoblasts. p57 KIP2 proteolysis depends on the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway and SMAD-mediated transcription; however, the molecular mechanism underlying p57 KIP2 degradation has been largely unknown. Here, we show that FBL12, a new F-box protein expressed in the limb bud of developing embryos, is involved in TGF-β1-induced degradation of p57 KIP2 . FBL12 formed an SCF FBL12 complex and directly ubiquitinated p57 KIP2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Inhibition of FBL12 by RNA interference suppressed the degradation of p57 KIP2 and a dominant-negative mutant of FBL12 (FBL12ΔF) increased the steady-state level of p57 KIP2 . Furthermore, wild-type FBL12 inhibited and FBL12ΔF promoted the differentiation of primary osteoblasts. As overexpression of p57 KIP2 promoted osteoblast differentiation, these results indicate the importance of FBL12 and the degradation of p57 KIP2 in the regulation of osteoblast cell differentiation.

Introduction

Members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, including TGF-β1 and bone morphogenic proteins, are recognized as multifunctional proteins that are important in embryonic development and adult homeostasis. Members of the TGF-β superfamily transduce their signals into the intracellular proteins of the SMAD family through heteromeric complexes of Ser/Thr kinase receptors ( Massague & Chen, 2000 ). Similar to other signalling pathways, the TGF-β and bone morphogenic protein pathways are tightly regulated by the ubiquitin–proteasome degradation pathway ( Izzi & Attisano, 2004 ).

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and CDK inhibitors (CKIs) are crucial positive and negative regulators of cell-cycle progression, respectively. Cell-cycle progression is tightly controlled by fluctuations of CDK activities and degradation of CKIs ( Vidal & Koff, 2000 ). In mice deficient in CKIs, only p57 KIP2 -null mice showed severe developmental abnormalities: they manifested high neonatal lethality associated with cleft palate, short limbs with abnormal endochondral ossification and developmental defects in several tissues ( Yan et al , 1997 ; Zhang et al , 1997 ). These abnormalities suggest that p57 KIP2 has specific roles in cell proliferation and differentiation that cannot be compensated for by other CKIs.

Previously, we reported that p57 KIP2 accumulates in calvarial osteoblastic cells as a result of serum starvation, and that TGF-β1 stimulates the degradation of p57 KIP2 without influencing the protein levels of p21 CIP1 and p27 KIP1 ( Urano et al , 1999 ; Nishimori et al , 2001 ). The degradation of p57 KIP2 leads to the activation of CDK activity, but its role in TGF-β1 signalling is not well understood. The degradation of p57 KIP2 was suppressed by proteasome inhibitors such as MG132 and lactacystin, indicating that p57 KIP2 is degraded by the proteasome pathway. Furthermore, gene expression through the SMAD pathway was required for the degradation of p57 KIP2 , indicating that a newly synthesized protein is involved in TGF-β1-induced p57 KIP2 degradation. Here, we identified FBL12, a new F-box protein induced by TGF-β1, which could directly ubiquitinate p57 KIP2 and lead to its degradation. Impairment of FBL12 and overexpression of p57 KIP2 enhanced osteoblast cell differentiation, suggesting the importance of p57 KIP2 degradation in the TGF-β1-mediated inhibition of osteoblast cell differentiation.

Discussion

Previously, we reported that TGF-β1 stimulation induces the degradation of p57 KIP2 but not p27 KIP1 . The degradation was dependent on transcriptional activation, indicating the involvement of newly transcribed proteins in the degradation process. We also reported that p57 KIP2 accumulates in Uba3 -deficient mice ( Tateishi et al , 2001 ). UBA3 encodes an essential catalytic subunit of E1-like enzyme of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8. NEDD8, which covalently attaches to Cullin family proteins, is crucial for the function of all Cullin-based E3 complexes ( Osaka et al , 2000 ; Kawakami et al , 2001 ). These results indicate that certain Cullin-based E3 complexes are essential for ubiquitination and degradation of p57 KIP2 .

Here, we identified a new F-box protein that ubiquitinates p57 KIP2 . Previously, Kamura et al (2003) had reported that SKP2 is a ubiquitin ligase of p57 KIP2 ; however, SKP2 was not expressed in our experimental condition. Expression of FBL12 and SKP2 genes was controlled differently during cell-cycle progression and by extracellular stimulation. FBL12 mRNA was upregulated by TGF-β1 stimulation, whereas SKP2 mRNA was upregulated by serum stimulation. On the basis of these different transcriptional controls, it seems that TGF-β1-induced p57 KIP2 proteolysis is mediated by FBL12, whereas serum-stimulated degradation is mediated by SKP2. Inhibition of FBL12 by RNA-mediated interference abrogated the degradation of p57 KIP2 by TGF-β1 stimulation under serum-starved conditions, indicating that FBL12 is the main E3 ligase involved in p57 KIP2 degradation under these conditions.

SKP2 ubiquitinates human p57 KIP2 when phosphorylated at Thr 310 (equivalent to mouse p57 KIP2 Thr 329) by CDK2–cyclin E. The phosphatase treatment experiment and mutation of Thr 329 of p57 KIP2 severely affected the binding of FBL12. The half-life of p57 KIP2 , but not that of the T329A mutant, was reduced by FBL12, suggesting the importance of phosphorylation on Thr 329. These results also indicate that SKP2 and FBL12 recognize the same phosphorylation site of p57 KIP2 . Despite the fact that SKP2 can bind to both p57 KIP2 and p27 KIP1 , FBL12 bound strongly to p57 KIP2 but not to p27 KIP1 in 293T cells. This specificity might be attributable to differences in amino-acid sequences between the leucine-rich repeat domain of FBL12 and SKP2 (29% identity), and might explain why only p57 KIP2 is degraded by TGF-β1 stimulation. It is also possible that p57 KIP2 and p27 KIP1 are differently modified by TGF-β1 stimulation. For example, the LKB1–AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway phosphorylates p27 KIP1 at Thr198 and stabilizes p27 KIP1 ( Liang et al , 2007 ). Our experiments were conducted under serum-starved conditions, which potentially activate the LKB1–AMPK pathway, suggesting that p27 KIP1 might be protected from degradation.

There is an apparent antagonism between proliferation and differentiation in general. Proliferation pathways must be suppressed to allow induction of differentiation ( Janssens et al , 2005 ). It has been reported that CIP/KIP (CDK interacting protein/kinase inhibitory protein) family proteins not only control cell-cycle progression but also contribute to cell differentiation ( Zavitz & Zipursky, 1997 ). CIP/KIP family-mediated growth arrest has been implicated in the terminal differentiation of various cell types, such as skeletal myoblasts, lens fibre cells, retinal cells, keratinocytes and intestinal epithelial cells. Previous studies have shown that p57 KIP2 in myoblasts stabilizes MyoD, a transcription factor crucial for muscle differentiation ( Reynaud et al , 1999 ). In osteoblastic cells, p57 KIP2 might have a similar role in bone differentiation by influencing the activities of differentiation-specific factors such as RUNX2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2). Here, we have shown that FBL12 is important for p57 KIP2 degradation and inhibition of osteoblast cell differentiation. Thus, analyses on the degradation mechanism might reveal new regulatory mechanisms that contribute to the versatile roles of CKIs in vivo .

Of note, FBL12 was important not only for cellular differentiation but also cellular viability. More comprehensive analyses on FBL12 and its substrates will clarify these unanswered questions in the future.
