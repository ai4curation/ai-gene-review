IFN-lambda1 (IL-29) plays a novel, emerging role in the inhibition of human Th2 
responses. Here, we demonstrate that both naive and memory human CD4(+) T cells 
express mRNA for the IFN-lambda1-specific receptor, IL-28Ralpha, and are 
responsive to IFN-lambda1. Expression of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) was 
suppressed in naive and memory CD4(+) T cells by IFN-lambda1, without affecting 
their proliferation. Further, acquisition of IL-4Ralpha expression after 
stimulation was inhibited by IFN-lambda1, as was GATA3 expression. Finally, 
IFN-lambda1 diminished the change in cell-surface phenotype that accompanies 
differentiation of "central memory" T cells into "effector memory" T cells. 
Taken together, our data describe unique immunomodulatory effects of IFN-lambda1 
and identify novel mechanisms for the reduction of existing Th2 responses and 
the regulation of new ones, in circulating naive and memory CD4(+) T cells.
