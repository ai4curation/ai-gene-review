Human ferrochelatase, a mitochondrial membrane-associated protein, catalyzes the 
terminal step of heme biosynthesis by insertion of ferrous iron into 
protoporphyrin IX. The recently solved x-ray structure of human ferrochelatase 
identifies a potential binding site for an iron donor protein on the matrix side 
of the homodimer. Herein we demonstrate Hs holofrataxin to be a high affinity 
iron binding partner for Hs ferrochelatase that is capable of both delivering 
iron to ferrochelatase and mediating the terminal step in mitochondrial heme 
biosynthesis. A general regulatory mechanism for mitochondrial iron metabolism 
is described that defines frataxin involvement in both heme and iron-sulfur 
cluster biosyntheses. In essence, the distinct binding affinities of 
holofrataxin to the target proteins, ferrochelatase (heme synthesis) and ISU 
(iron-sulfur cluster synthesis), allows discrimination between the two major 
iron-dependent pathways and facilitates targeted heme biosynthesis following 
down-regulation of frataxin.
