Human p53 is a transcription factor regulating the transcription of a variety of 
target genes. Under various stresses, its tumor suppressor function was 
activated by the phosphorylation of p53. In this study, we found that 
full-length wild-type p53 could form phase-separated condensates with the 
aggregation tendency in vitro and in vivo. The LLPS of p53 was regulated by 
multiple functional domains. Specific DNA could promote the formation of p53 
condensates. Fluorescence recovery data after photobleaching revealed that the 
Ser392 phosphorylation enhanced the fluidity of p53 condensates. Fluorescence 
analysis suggested that Ser392 phosphorylation increased the p53 concentration 
in condensates involved in transcription initiation and the stability of 
p53-mediated transcriptional condensates. The experiments in cells showed that 
p53 was evenly dispersed in the nucleus, it formed the dynamic condensates under 
the UV radiation-induced DNA damage, and the Ser392 nonphosphorylatable mutant 
S392A p53 formed condensates with significantly reduced number and size. These 
findings revealed that p53 phosphorylation modified its LLPS behavior, and 
suggested a mechanism that phosphorylation regulated condensate preference.
