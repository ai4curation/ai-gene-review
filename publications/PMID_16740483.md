The vacuolar protein sorting machinery regulates multivesicular body biogenesis 
and is selectively recruited by enveloped viruses to support budding. Here we 
report the crystal structure of the human ESCRT-III protein CHMP3 at 2.8 A 
resolution. The core structure of CHMP3 folds into a flat helical arrangement 
that assembles into a lattice, mainly via two different dimerization modes, and 
unilaterally exposes a highly basic surface. The C terminus, the target for 
Vps4-induced ESCRT disassembly, extends from the opposite side of the membrane 
targeting region. Mutations within the basic and dimerization regions hinder 
bilayer interaction in vivo and reverse the dominant-negative effect of a 
truncated CHMP3 fusion protein on HIV-1 budding. Thus, the final steps in the 
budding process may include CHMP protein polymerization and lattice formation on 
membranes by employing different bilayer-recognizing surfaces, a function shared 
by all CHMP family members.
