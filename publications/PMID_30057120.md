The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) can be triggered in a 
cell-non-autonomous fashion across multiple tissues in response to mitochondrial 
dysfunction. The ability to communicate information about the presence of 
mitochondrial stress enables a global response that can ultimately better 
protect an organism from local mitochondrial challenges. We find that animals 
use retromer-dependent Wnt signaling to propagate mitochondrial stress signals 
from the nervous system to peripheral tissues. Specifically, the 
polyQ40-triggered activation of mitochondrial stress or reduction of cco-1 
(complex IV subunit) in neurons of C. elegans results in the Wnt-dependent 
induction of cell-non-autonomous UPRmt in peripheral cells. Loss-of-function 
mutations of retromer complex components that are responsible for recycling the 
Wnt secretion-factor/MIG-14 prevent Wnt secretion and thereby suppress 
cell-non-autonomous UPRmt. Neuronal expression of the Wnt ligand/EGL-20 is 
sufficient to induce cell-non-autonomous UPRmt in a retromer complex-, Wnt 
signaling-, and serotonin-dependent manner, clearly implicating Wnt signaling as 
a strong candidate for the "mitokine" signal.
