Nowadays, small non-coding Ribo Nucleic Acids (sncRNAs) such as siRNA, miRNA and 
shRNA are extremely serving to gene regulation. They are involved in many 
biological processes and in an increasing number of studies regarding a variety 
of application of sncRNAs toward human health and relieving diseases ranging 
from metabolic disorders to those involving various organ systems as well as 
different types of cancer. One of the most severe limitations for applying RNA 
interference technology is the absence of safe and effective carriers for in 
vivo delivery, including localizing the molecules to a specific site of interest 
and sustaining the presentation of the payloads for a controlled period of time. 
In this review, we focus on the sncRNA functions and recent advances on the 
delivery of these molecules by biodegradable, biocompatible and nontoxic 
biopolymers including chitosan, cyclodextrins, poly-l-lysine, dextran, poly 
(lactic co-glycolic acid), polyglutamic acid, hyaluronic acid and gelatin.
