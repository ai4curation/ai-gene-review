Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded polyglutamine tract in huntingtin 
protein, leading to accumulation of huntingtin in the nuclei of striatal 
neurons. The 18 amino-acid amino-terminus of huntingtin is an amphipathic alpha 
helical membrane-binding domain that can reversibly target to vesicles and the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The association of huntingtin to the ER is affected 
by ER stress. A single point mutation in huntingtin 1-18 predicted to disrupt 
this helical structure displayed striking phenotypes of complete inhibition of 
polyglutamine-mediated aggregation, increased huntingtin nuclear accumulation 
and greatly increased mutant huntingtin toxicity in a striatal-derived mouse 
cell line. Huntingtin vesicular interaction mediated by 1-18 is specific to late 
endosomes and autophagic vesicles. We propose that huntingtin has a normal 
biological function as an ER-associated protein that can translocate to the 
nucleus and back out in response to ER stress or other events. The increased 
nuclear entry of mutant huntingtin due to loss of ER-targeting results in 
increased toxicity.
