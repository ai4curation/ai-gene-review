The histidine nucleotide-binding protein, Hint2, is a mitochondrial 
phosphoramidase expressed in liver, brown fat, pancreas, and muscle. The livers 
of Hint2 knockout (Hint2(-/-)) mice accumulate triglycerides and show a pattern 
of mitochondrial protein lysine hyperacetylation. The extent and nature of the 
lysine acetylation changes and the response of Hint2(-/-) mice to nutritional 
challenges that elicit a modification of protein acetylation have not been 
investigated. To compare the adaptation of Hint2(-/-) and control (Hint2(+/+)) 
mice with episodes of fasting and high-fat diet (HFD), we subjected animals to 
either feeding ad libitum or fasting for 24 h, and to either a HFD or control 
diet for 8 wk. Triglyceride content was higher in Hint2(-/-) than in Hint2(+/+) 
livers, whereas plasma triglycerides were fourfold lower. Malonyl-CoA levels 
were increased twofold in Hint2(-/-) livers. After 24 h fasting, Hint2(-/-) 
displayed a decrease in body temperature, commensurate with a decrease in mass 
of brown fat and downregulation of uncoupling protein 1. HFD-treated Hint2(-/-) 
livers showed more steatosis, and plasma insulin and cholesterol were higher 
than in Hint(+/+) mice. Several proteins identified as substrates of sirtuin 3 
and 5 and active in intermediary and ketone metabolism were hyperacetylated in 
liver and brown fat mitochondria after both HFD and fasting regimens. Glutamate 
dehydrogenase activity was downregulated in fed and fasted livers, and this was 
attributed to an increase in acetylation and ADP-ribosylation. The absence of 
Hint2 deregulates the posttranslational modification of several mitochondrial 
proteins, which impedes the adaptation to episodes of nutritional stress.
