The TOE1 gene was discovered as a target of the Egr1 transcription factor that 
participates in cell growth regulation through the upregulation of p21 and a 
cell cycle delay at the G2/M phase. We report here that TOE1 is able to bind to 
the p53 tumor suppressor protein, specifically interacting with the C terminal 
tetramerization domain of p53. We have further characterized this interaction 
through determination of binding kinetics using nanoporous optical 
interferometry and demonstrated that this interaction is capable of enhancing 
the transcriptional activity of p53-dependent gene targets. These results 
suggest a mechanistic role for TOE1 as a co-regulator of p53.
