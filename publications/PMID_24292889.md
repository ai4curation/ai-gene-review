Ubiquitination, the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a target protein, 
regulates most cellular processes and is involved in several neurological 
disorders. In particular, Angelman syndrome and one of the most common genomic 
forms of autism, dup15q, are caused respectively by lack of or excess of UBE3A, 
a ubiquitin E3 ligase. Its Drosophila orthologue, Ube3a, is also active during 
brain development. We have now devised a protocol to screen for substrates of 
this particular ubiquitin ligase. In a neuronal cell system, we find direct 
ubiquitination by Ube3a of three proteasome-related proteins Rpn10, Uch-L5, and 
CG8209, as well as of the ribosomal protein Rps10b. Only one of these, Rpn10, is 
targeted for degradation upon ubiquitination by Ube3a, indicating that 
degradation might not be the only effect of Ube3a on its substrates. 
Furthermore, we report the genetic interaction in vivo between Ube3a and the 
C-terminal part of Rpn10. Overexpression of these proteins leads to an enhanced 
accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, further supporting the biochemical 
evidence of interaction obtained in neuronal cells.
