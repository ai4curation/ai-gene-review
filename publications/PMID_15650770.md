Mechanisms regulating thrombus stabilization remain largely unknown. Here, we 
report that loss of any 1 of the Gas6 receptors (Gas6-Rs), i.e., Tyro3, Axl, or 
Mer, or delivery of a soluble extracellular domain of Axl that traps Gas6 
protects mice against life-threatening thrombosis. Loss of a Gas6-R does not 
prevent initial platelet aggregation but impairs subsequent stabilization of 
platelet aggregates, at least in part by reducing "outside-in" signaling and 
platelet granule secretion. Gas6, through its receptors, activates PI3K and Akt 
and stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta3 integrin, thereby 
amplifying outside-in signaling via alphaIIbbeta3. Blocking the 
Gas6-R-alphaIIbbeta3 integrin cross-talk might be a novel approach to the 
reduction of thrombosis.
