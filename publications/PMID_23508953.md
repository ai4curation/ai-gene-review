The scaffold protein ISCU facilitates the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters 
(ISCs), which are essential cofactors for many vital metabolic processes. The 
mTOR pathways are central to nutrient and energy-sensing networks. Here, we 
demonstrate that mTORC1 associates with ISCU and phosphorylates ISCU at serine 
14. This phosphorylation stabilized ISCU protein. Insufficiency of ISCU 
triggered by mTORC1 inhibition prevented ISC assembly. Sustained ISCU protein 
levels enhanced by mTORC1 sensitized TSC2-null cells to iron deprivation due to 
constitutive ISC biogenesis-triggered iron demand, which outstrips supply. We 
conclude that the mTORC1 pathway serves to modulate iron metabolism and 
homeostasis, and we speculate that iron deprivation may be an adjunct in the 
treatment of cancers characterized by constitutive mTORC1 activation.
