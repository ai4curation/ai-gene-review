A recent study showed that F-spondin, a protein associated with the 
extracellular matrix, interacted with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and 
inhibited beta-secretase cleavage. F-spondin contains a thrombospondin domain 
that we hypothesized could interact with the family of receptors for 
apolipoprotein E (apoE). Through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we 
demonstrated that F-spondin interacts with an apoE receptor (apoE receptor 2 
[ApoEr2]) through the thrombospondin domain of F-spondin and the ligand binding 
domain of ApoEr2. Full-length F-spondin increased coimmunoprecipitation of 
ApoEr2 and APP in transfected cells and primary neurons and increased surface 
expression of APP and ApoEr2. Full-length F-spondin, but none of the individual 
F-spondin domains, increased cleavage of APP and ApoEr2, resulting in more 
secreted forms of APP and ApoEr2 and more C-terminal fragments (CTF) of these 
proteins. In addition, full-length F-spondin, but not the individual domains, 
decreased production of the beta-CTF of APP and Abeta in transfected cells and 
primary neurons. The reduction in APP beta-CTF was blocked by 
receptor-associated protein (RAP), an inhibitor of lipoprotein receptors, 
implicating ApoEr2 in the altered proteolysis of APP. ApoEr2 coprecipitated with 
APP alpha- and beta-CTF, and F-spondin reduced the levels of APP intracellular 
domain signaling, suggesting that there are also intracellular interactions 
between APP and ApoEr2, perhaps involving adaptor proteins. These studies 
suggest that the extracellular matrix molecule F-spondin can cluster APP and 
ApoEr2 together on the cell surface and affect the processing of each, resulting 
in decreased production of Abeta.
