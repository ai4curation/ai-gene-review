The onset of X inactivation is preceded by a marked increase in the level of 
Xist RNA. Here we demonstrate that increased stability of Xist RNA is the 
primary determinant of developmental up-regulation. Unstable transcript is 
produced by both alleles in XX ES cells and in XX embryos prior to the onset of 
random X inactivation. Following differentiation, transcription of unstable RNA 
from the active X chromosome allele continues for a period following 
stabilization and accumulation of transcript on the inactive X allele. We 
discuss the implications of these findings in terms of models for the initiation 
of random and imprinted X inactivation.
