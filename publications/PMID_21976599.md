Sperm capacitation is required for fertilization and involves several ion 
permeability changes. Although Cl(-) and HCO(3)(-) are essential for 
capacitation, the molecular entities responsible for their transport are not 
fully known. During mouse sperm capacitation, the intracellular concentration of 
Cl(-) ([Cl(-)](i)) increases and membrane potential (Em) hyperpolarizes. As in 
noncapacitated sperm, the Cl(-) equilibrium potential appears to be close to the 
cell resting Em, opening of Cl(-) channels could not support the [Cl(-)](i) 
increase observed during capacitation. Alternatively, the [Cl(-)](i) increase 
might be mediated by anion exchangers. Among them, SLC26A3 and SLC26A6 are good 
candidates, since, in several cell types, they increase [Cl(-)](i) and interact 
with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a Cl(-) channel 
present in mouse and human sperm. This interaction is known to be mediated and 
probably regulated by the Na(+)/H(+) regulatory factor-1 (official symbol, 
SLC9A3R1). Our RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, Western blot, and 
immunoprecipitation data indicate that SLC26A3, SLC26A6, and SLC9A3R1 are 
expressed in mouse sperm, localize to the midpiece, and interact between each 
other and with CFTR. Moreover, we present evidence indicating that CFTR and 
SLC26A3 are involved in the [Cl(-)](i) increase induced by db-cAMP in 
noncapacitated sperm. Furthermore, we found that inhibitors of SLC26A3 (Tenidap 
and 5099) interfere with the Em changes that accompany capacitation. Together, 
these findings indicate that a CFTR/SLC26A3 functional interaction is important 
for mouse sperm capacitation.
