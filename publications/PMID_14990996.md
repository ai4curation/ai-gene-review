SCF(Fbs1) is a ubiquitin ligase that functions in the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER)-associated degradation pathway. Fbs1/Fbx2, a member of the F-box proteins, 
recognizes high-mannose oligosaccharides. Efficient binding to an N-glycan 
requires di-N-acetylchitobiose (chitobiose). Here we report the crystal 
structures of the sugar-binding domain (SBD) of Fbs1 alone and in complex with 
chitobiose. The SBD is composed of a ten-stranded antiparallel beta-sandwich. 
The structure of the SBD-chitobiose complex includes hydrogen bonds between Fbs1 
and chitobiose and insertion of the methyl group of chitobiose into a small 
hydrophobic pocket of Fbs1. Moreover, NMR spectroscopy has demonstrated that the 
amino acid residues adjoining the chitobiose-binding site interact with the 
outer branches of the carbohydrate moiety. Considering that the innermost 
chitobiose moieties in N-glycans are usually involved in intramolecular 
interactions with the polypeptide moieties, we propose that Fbs1 interacts with 
the chitobiose in unfolded N-glycoprotein, pointing the protein moiety toward E2 
for ubiquitination.
