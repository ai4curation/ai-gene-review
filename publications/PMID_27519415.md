Abstract

Cells contain hundreds of proteins that require iron cofactors for activity. Iron cofactors are synthesized in the cell, but the pathways involved in distributing heme, iron-sulfur clusters, and ferrous/ferric ions to apoproteins remain incompletely defined. In particular, cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxins and BolA-like proteins have been identified as [2Fe-2S]-coordinating complexes in vitro and iron-regulatory proteins in fungi, but it is not clear how these proteins function in mammalian systems or how this complex might affect Fe-S proteins or the cytosolic Fe-S assembly machinery. To explore these questions, we use quantitative immunoprecipitation and live cell proximity-dependent biotinylation to monitor interactions between Glrx3, BolA2, and components of the cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly system. We characterize cytosolic Glrx3·BolA2 as a [2Fe-2S] chaperone complex in human cells. Unlike complexes formed by fungal orthologs, human Glrx3-BolA2 interaction required the coordination of Fe-S clusters, whereas Glrx3 homodimer formation did not. Cellular Glrx3·BolA2 complexes increased 6–8-fold in response to increasing iron, forming a rapidly expandable pool of Fe-S clusters. Fe-S coordination by Glrx3·BolA2 did not depend on Ciapin1 or Ciao1, proteins that bind Glrx3 and are involved in cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly and distribution. Instead, Glrx3 and BolA2 bound and facilitated Fe-S incorporation into Ciapin1, a [2Fe-2S] protein functioning early in the cytosolic Fe-S assembly pathway. Thus, Glrx3·BolA is a [2Fe-2S] chaperone complex capable of transferring [2Fe-2S] clusters to apoproteins in human cells.

Introduction

Although hundreds of cellular proteins require iron-containing cofactors for activity ( 1 ), the machinery responsible for distributing these cofactors remains relatively obscure. Separate systems must exist for both the mitochondrial and the cytosolic/nuclear compartments and systems must selectively distribute ferrous iron ions, iron-sulfur (Fe-S) centers, and heme. Recent studies indicate that the poly(rC)-binding proteins are involved in the distribution of ferrous iron to ferritin, the principal iron storage protein, and to mono- and dinuclear iron enzymes in the cytosol of mammalian cells ( 2 – 4 ). Studies in both bakers' yeast and vertebrates indicate that many proteins are involved in the assembly and distribution of Fe-S clusters in the cytosol ( 5 – 7 ). These proteins are structurally and functionally conserved across many species. One protein class, the monothiol glutaredoxins, has been functionally implicated in the trafficking of both ionic iron and Fe-S clusters ( 8 – 12 ).

Monothiol glutaredoxins are members of the thioredoxin (Trx) 3 -fold family of proteins. Most members of the Trx family utilize a dithiol active site to catalyze the oxido-reduction of thiol-disulfide residues. In contrast, monothiol glutaredoxins contain a Cys-Gly-Phe-Ser active site that lacks catalytic activity and instead coordinates a [2Fe-2S] cluster via the active site cysteine and the sulfhydryl residue of a molecule of glutathione, which is non-covalently bound adjacent to the glutaredoxin active site ( 10 , 13 – 15 ). In vitro analysis of this Fe-S-containing species indicates that two glutathione-bound glutaredoxin proteins can coordinate a single [2Fe-2S] cluster as a bridging complex. In eukaryotes, distinct monothiol glutaredoxins are expressed in the mitochondria and cytosol. Genetic evidence suggests that mitochondrial glutaredoxins are involved in the transfer of newly assembled Fe-S clusters to recipient apoproteins ( 8 , 9 , 16 , 17 ). Cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxins differ from their mitochondrial paralogs in that they contain an amino-terminal Trx-like domain followed by one or more glutaredoxin domains. Studies in fungi suggest these proteins are involved in iron homeostasis.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxins, Grx3 and Grx4, which are functionally redundant. Genetic ablation of these or mutation of their active site cysteine results in a failure to activate enzymes requiring iron in the form of heme, Fe-S clusters, and di-iron centers, suggesting a critical role in the distribution of iron in both cytosol and mitochondria ( 11 ). Zebrafish embryos injected with morpholinos against the cytosolic zfGrx3 displayed profound hemoglobinization defects, but only small changes in the activity of heme and Fe-S enzymes, suggesting that the roles of Grx3 in yeast and fish differ ( 18 ). In mammalian cells, a single monothiol glutaredoxin, Glrx3 (also called PICOT, TXNL-2, HUSSY22, and Grx3) localizes to the cytosol. Glrx3 in vertebrates differs structurally from the yeast proteins in that it contains, in addition to the amino-terminal Trx domain, two tandem carboxyl-terminal Grx domains, both of which can coordinate a [2Fe-2S] cluster in vitro ( 14 ). Depletion of Glrx3 in mammalian cells was associated with moderate deficiencies of cytosolic Fe-S cluster enzymes and evidence of altered iron homeostasis, whereas mitochondrial heme and Fe-S enzymes remained largely unaffected ( 18 ). Other studies from human cells suggest that Glrx3 may have a role in regulating growth, activation, or signaling, although mechanisms to account for these effects have not been characterized ( 19 – 21 ).

In yeast, the role of Glrx3 in the sensing or distribution of iron appears linked to its bound Fe-S cluster, but whether Glrx3 directly or indirectly mediates iron enzyme activation has not been determined in yeast or mammals. In many species, monothiol glutaredoxins are found in oligomeric complexes. Both yeast and mammalian Glrx3 can form Fe-S cluster-bridged homodimers in vitro ( 10 , 14 ), and cluster coordination is required for yeast Glrx3 homodimerization in vivo ( 11 , 22 ).

Monothiol glutaredoxins from many species form complexes with BolA-like proteins. BolA was initially described as a bacterial morphogen and was subsequently found to be highly conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes ( 23 ). Grx3 and BolA proteins are closely linked in prokaryotic genomes ( 24 ), and high throughput studies found physical interactions in bakers' yeast ( 25 ). The BolA proteins remained functionally uncharacterized, however, until genetic studies in bakers' yeast indicated that Fra2, the cytosolic BolA ortholog, functioned as a regulator of the iron-sensing transcription factor, Aft1, and formed a complex with Grx3/4 ( 26 ).

Fungi and mammals express three non-redundant BolA paralogs, with BolA2-like proteins localized to the cytosol/nucleus and BolA3-like proteins localized to the mitochondria. BolA1 proteins are largely uncharacterized. In vitro , both yeast and human BolA2 form complexes with Glrx3 that contain one or two bridging [2Fe-2S] clusters that are coordinated by a conserved histidine residue in BolA2 ( 10 , 13 , 14 , 26 ). Moreover, in vitro studies indicate that the Glrx3 homodimers with [2Fe-2S] clusters can spontaneously undergo rearrangement in the presence of BolA2 to form Glrx3·BolA2 heterocomplexes with bridging [2Fe-2S] clusters. Although yeast Glrx3 and BolA2 form complexes with a 1:1 stoichiometry, human Glrx3 (which contains two tandem Grx domains) forms a heterotrimer containing two BolA2 proteins with two bridging [2Fe-2S] clusters. Recently, separate in vitro studies have shown that [2Fe-2S] clusters coordinated by Glrx3 homodimers or Glrx3·BolA2 hetero-oligomers can all be transferred to Ciapin1, an Fe-S protein involved in early steps of cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly ( 27 , 28 ). However, it is not clear which, if any, of these transfer reactions can occur in a cellular context.

The roles of Glrx3·BolA2 complexes have been extensively studied in yeast species, where BolA2 is called Fra2. In bakers' yeast, Glrx3·[2Fe-2S]·BolA2 complexes have a critical regulatory role in the iron-dependent inactivation of the transcription factor Aft1 ( 13 , 26 , 29 ). In vitro , Glrx3·[2Fe-2S]·BolA can bind and transfer a [2Fe-2S] cluster to Aft2, a paralog of Aft1 ( 30 ). In vivo , this transfer of the [2Fe-2S] cluster to Aft1 facilitates its dissociation from promoter DNA and subsequent export from the nucleus ( 22 , 26 , 31 , 32 ). Strains deleted for either Glrx3 or BolA2 fail to inactivate Aft1 under conditions of iron excess and fail to repress transcription of genes controlled by Aft1. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , Glrx3 and BolA2 are also required for the regulation of the iron-dependent transcriptional repressors Fep1 and Php4. Glrx3·BolA2 complexes bind to both repressors independently and affect their DNA binding activity under different iron conditions; however, transfer of [2Fe-2S] clusters to either repressor is not proposed to account for the regulation ( 33 – 36 ). Rather, in the case of Fep1, the transfer of iron ions alone is implicated. Aft1 does not have a mammalian ortholog, and the iron-dependent transcriptional repression systems of Fep1 and Php4 do not operate in mammalian cells. Therefore, these regulatory events offer no clues as to the functions of Glrx3 and/or BolA2 in animal cells, and no studies examining the function of BolA2 in mammalian cells have been reported. Nevertheless, BolA2 and Glrx3 appear primed to respond to changes in cellular iron availability.

Here, we use a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to characterize Glrx3·BolA2 complexes isolated from cultured human cells. We show that BolA2 formed dynamic complexes with Glrx3 that required bridging Fe-S clusters; complex formation was dependent on the availability of iron, inorganic sulfur, and amino acid residues required for glutathione and [2Fe-2S] coordination in Glrx3. Both Glrx3 and BolA2 interacted with Ciapin1. This interaction resulted in the acquisition of an iron-containing cofactor by Ciapin1, which was required for its stability in living cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the Glrx3·BolA2 complex represents a highly elastic reservoir of cytosolic [2Fe-2S] clusters that can be transferred to enzymes via direct protein-protein interactions, consistent with the role of [2Fe-2S] cluster chaperone.

Discussion

The function of cytosolic BolA proteins in animal cells is largely unknown. Here, we present cell-based studies that reveal functions of BolA2 in complex with the cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxin Glrx3. These studies indicate a role for BolA2·Glrx3 complexes in [2Fe-2S] cluster coordination and distribution. They also reveal that the characteristics of these proteins in animal cells differ significantly from those observed in yeast and in vitro , highlighting the importance of cell-based studies and revealing the functional adaptations manifest by orthologous proteins in different niches.

Several studies in yeast have underscored the critical role of cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxins and their BolA-binding partners in iron homeostasis ( 26 , 33 , 48 ), and a recent in vitro study of human Glrx3 and BolA2 characterized their capacity to bind and transfer [2Fe-2S] clusters ( 14 , 27 ). Here, we show that Glrx3 and BolA2 form a complex in human cells and that complex formation is highly dependent on coordination of bridging Fe-S clusters. Although cytosolic Glrx·BolA complexes from fungi do not require the Fe-S ligand for formation or stability, multiple observations from this work suggest [2Fe-2S] cluster coordination is essential for this complex to form in cells. 1) Depleting cellular iron disrupts Glrx3·BolA2 formation, whereas iron supplementation augments its formation. 2) Limiting production of inorganic sulfur for Fe-S biogenesis reduces Glrx3·BolA2 complex levels. 3) Mutating the Glrx3 residues required in vitro for Fe-S cluster binding prevents binding of BolA2.

Surprisingly, our studies indicated that Glrx3·[2Fe-2S]·BolA2 complexes can serve as a rapidly expandable pool of Fe-S clusters. Glrx3·BolA2 complexes exhibited a 6-fold increase in response to increased iron availability. Moreover, a majority of the cellular Glrx3 pool was bound to BolA2 in iron-replete cells, indicating that the Glrx3·[2Fe-2S]·BolA2 complex represents a major functional form of Glrx3 in the cell. The physiological roles of the [2Fe-2S] clusters elastically and transiently stored in Glrx3·[2Fe-2S]·BolA2 are not completely known, but we show at they can be transferred to Ciapin1 in cells. Glrx3·[2Fe-2S]·BolA2 complexes may be analogous to the labile iron pool and serve to make [2Fe-2S] clusters available to apoproteins or the cytosolic [4Fe-4S] distribution machinery, essentially functioning as [2Fe-2S] cluster chaperones. The wide dynamic range and kinetic lability of the Glrx3·[2Fe-2S]·BolA2 complexes are reminiscent of the iron-sensing, iron-regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), which responds to increases in cellular iron availability by rapidly coordinating a [4Fe-4S] cluster ( 49 , 50 ). Cluster coordination allows IRP1 to shift from an RNA-binding protein to an enzyme; thus, IRP1 acts as an iron sensor and post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression. We show that Glrx3 and BolA2 are clearly primed to respond to changes in cellular iron status. Glrx3 or BolA2 may have functions independent of their binding partner, and complex formation may competitively inhibit those activities. Alternatively, Glrx3 or BolA may directly impact the systems that control iron uptake. Future studies will determine whether the iron responsiveness of human Glrx3 and BolA2 can serve a storage and/or regulatory function, as occurs in their fungal counterparts.

Data from our studies indicate that Glrx3-Glrx3 homodimers represent a rare species of Glrx3 in cells that is labile and transient but does not appear to require a stabilizing Fe-S cluster for dimerization. In contrast to Glrx3·[2Fe-2S]·BolA2, which was readily detectable using co-immunoprecipitation, we repeatedly failed to detect endogenous Glrx3 in Glrx3·FLAG immune complexes, even under conditions that are permissive for complex formation in vitro . We were, however, able to detect Glrx3 homodimer formation using cell-based and proximity-dependent biotinylation with BirA*-FLAG-Glrx3, which suggests that the interaction is transient and labile. This experimental approach indicated that Glrx3 homodimerization did not require the coordination of an Fe-S cluster. Quantitative measurements of homodimerization indicated that the species was predominantly detected in iron-deprived cells, rather than iron-replete cells, and that Fe-S cluster-binding mutants of Br-F-Glrx3 dimerized with endogenous Glrx3 as well as wild type Br-F-Glrx3. Although Fe-S cluster-bridged Glrx3 homodimers are oxygen-sensitive in vitro ( 10 ), we found no evidence that hypoxia could stabilize Glrx3 dimers in cells. Although we cannot completely rule out the transient formation of cluster-bridged Glrx3 homodimers, they do not represent a Glrx3 species that accumulates in cultured cells.

The discrepancies between these studies characterizing the interactions between Glrx3 and BolA2 and previous studies in yeast and in vitro likely have multiple origins. Chief among these is the effect of protein concentration in driving protein-protein interactions. The high concentrations used in in vitro work and occasionally in cell-based overexpression studies can potentially result in non-native interactions that do not readily occur in cells expressing proteins at endogenous levels. Similarly, cellular levels of Glrx3 and BolA2 in bakers' and fission yeasts may be high enough to permit interactions that are not seen in mammalian cells. These differences could account for the previously reported formation of Glrx3 homodimers containing Fe-S clusters and Glrx3·BolA2 species without Fe-S clusters in these systems. Perhaps a more important consideration is that clearly Glrx3 and possibly BolA2 are involved in multiple competing protein-protein interactions that occur simultaneously in cells, and the relative affinities of these competing partners determine the associations and functions of Glrx3 and BolA2.

Our work confirms that Glrx3-[2Fe-2S]-BolA2 can directly bind Ciapin1 and facilitate Ciapin1 iron acquisition in cells, consistent with the transfer of a [2Fe-2S] cluster, but that Ciapin1 is not required for cluster acquisition by Glrx3·BolA2. Similar to other cytosolic Fe-S cluster proteins, Ciapin1 that did not acquire its cluster was more rapidly degraded than holo-Ciapin1. Surprisingly, apo-Ciapin1 degradation appeared to occur via an autophagosomal/lysosomal pathway. This observation suggests that Ciapin1 may be part of a large cytosolic complex that undergoes turnover via autophagy rather than through the proteasome. Previous in vitro studies of Ciapin1 and Glrx3 demonstrated the Trx domain of Glrx3 mediated a direct interaction with an amino-terminal region of Ciapin1 ( 28 ). Our findings support the requirement for the Trx domain but also indicate that a bound Fe-S cluster (and presumably BolA2) is required for the initial interaction of Glrx3 and Ciapin1. BolA2 appears not to remain stably associated with the Ciapin·Glrx3 complex. Although Glrx3 remained stably bound to Ciapin1, dissociation of Glrx3 with high ionic strength buffers did not affect the iron bound to Ciapin1, which demonstrated that the iron cofactors were transferred to Ciapin1. The importance of apo-Glrx3 remaining bound to Ciapin1 after cluster transfer is not clear, but it may promote the association of Ciapin1 with other components of the CIA machinery, such as Ciao1 or Iop1 ( 51 ).

Despite a clear loss of 55 Fe incorporation into Ciapin1-FLAG when cells were depleted of Glrx3 or BolA2, significant amounts of residual 55 Fe were retained in Ciapin1 immune complexes. Ciapin1 may be capable of acquiring Fe-S clusters from an alternative source, e.g. the mitoNEET/miner1 family of [2Fe-2S] proteins ( 52 ). This alternative source of Fe-S clusters could account for the relatively milder phenotypes associated with depletion of Glrx3 in mammalian cells versus yeast. Alternatively, iron that remained in Ciapin1 immune complexes could be coordinated by other iron-binding proteins associated with Ciapin1. As Ciapin1-Ndor1 is involved in the transfer of electrons to the CIA machinery, other Fe-S cluster components of the CIA may be present in Ciapin1 immune complexes. Our evidence that Glrx3·BolA2 transfers Fe-S clusters to Ciapin1 also suggests that some of the phenotypes associated with Glrx3 depletion in yeast or mammalian cells may be due to the failure of Ciapin1-Ndor to transfer electrons or possibly Fe-S clusters to downstream components of the CIA or to other enzymes requiring reducing equivalents for activation, such as the tyrosyl radical in the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase ( 11 , 18 , 43 , 53 , 54 ). Finally, Glrx3·[2Fe-2S]·BolA2 may function as an Fe-S chaperone, distributing its bound cofactors to other enzymes requiring [2Fe-2S] clusters, such as xanthine dehydrogenase or aldehyde oxidase. The precise mechanism by which Glrx3·[2Fe-2S] 2 ·BolA2 2 acquires its cluster in cells, as well as the physiological importance of dynamic transient 2Fe-2S cluster pool, are also important questions that await further investigation.
