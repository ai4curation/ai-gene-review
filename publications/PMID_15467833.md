Phosphorylation of the cell adhesion protein CEACAM1 increases insulin 
sensitivity and decreases insulin-dependent mitogenesis in vivo. Here we show 
that CEACAM1 is a substrate of the EGFR and that upon being phosphorylated, 
CEACAM1 reduces EGFR-mediated growth of transfected Cos-7 and MCF-7 cells in 
response to EGF. Using transgenic mice overexpressing a 
phosphorylation-defective CEACAM1 mutant in liver (L-SACC1), we show that the 
effect of CEACAM1 on EGF-dependent cell proliferation is mediated by its ability 
to bind to and sequester Shc, thus uncoupling EGFR signaling from the ras/MAPK 
pathway. In L-SACC1 mice, we also show that impaired CEACAM1 phosphorylation 
leads to ligand-independent increase of EGFR-mediated cell proliferation. This 
appears to be secondary to visceral obesity and the metabolic syndrome, with 
increased levels of output of free fatty acids and heparin-binding EGF-like 
growth factor from the adipose tissue of the mice. Thus, L-SACC1 mice provide a 
model for the mechanistic link between increased cell proliferation in states of 
impaired metabolism and visceral obesity.

Abstract

Phosphorylation of the cell adhesion protein CEACAM1 increases insulin sensitivity and decreases insulin-dependent mitogenesis in vivo. Here we show that CEACAM1 is a substrate of the EGFR and that upon being phosphorylated, CEACAM1 reduces EGFR-mediated growth of transfected Cos-7 and MCF-7 cells in response to EGF. Using transgenic mice overexpressing a phosphorylation-defective CEACAM1 mutant in liver (L-SACC1), we show that the effect of CEACAM1 on EGF-dependent cell proliferation is mediated by its ability to bind to and sequester Shc, thus uncoupling EGFR signaling from the ras/MAPK pathway. In L-SACC1 mice, we also show that impaired CEACAM1 phosphorylation leads to ligand-independent increase of EGFR-mediated cell proliferation. This appears to be secondary to visceral obesity and the metabolic syndrome, with increased levels of output of free fatty acids and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor from the adipose tissue of the mice. Thus, L-SACC1 mice provide a model for the mechanistic link between increased cell proliferation in states of impaired metabolism and visceral obesity.

Introduction

Activation of the tyrosine kinase of EGFR by EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and other ligands causes EGFR to phosphorylate itself and other substrates. This activates signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis, including the ras/MAPK mitogenic pathway, which is coupled to EGFR by Grb2 directly or indirectly through Shc ( 1 , 2 ), the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway, and others ( 3 ).

Carcinoembryonic antigen–related (CEA-related) cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein in endothelial cells, B cells, interleukin-activated T cells, and epithelial cells ( 4 , 5 ). CEACAM1 is a substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in liver, but not in muscle and fat tissue. It is expressed as two spliced variants differing by the inclusion (CEACAM1-4L) or exclusion (CEACAM1-4S) of most of its cytoplasmic tail, including all phosphorylation sites ( 6 ). Rat CEACAM1-4L is phosphorylated on Tyr 488 by the insulin receptor ( 7 ). This phosphorylation requires an intact Ser 503 residue in its cytoplasmic tail. The primary structure of CEACAM1-4L is markedly conserved among species, with the DDVxY488 tyrosine phosphorylation motif and the RPTS503A cAMP-dependent serine kinase target site being conserved. As predicted, we have thus observed similar phosphorylation properties of this protein in human, mouse, and rat ( 7 – 9 ).

CEACAM1-4L levels are downregulated in prostate, breast, colon, and hepatocellular carcinomas ( 10 – 14 ), resulting from aberrant chromatin acetylation in some tumors ( 15 ). Moreover, re-introducing CEACAM1-4L in these epithelial cells reduces their tumorigenicity ( 16 – 19 ). Additionally, CEACAM1-4L expression decreases cell growth in response to insulin ( 20 , 21 ). This implicates CEACAM1-4L in tumor suppression and the regulation of a normal epithelial cell phenotype and proliferation ( 22 ). The mechanism underlying the tumor suppression function of CEACAM1-4L remains largely unknown, but it appears to depend on the phosphorylation state of CEACAM1-4L ( 4 , 23 ).

CEACAM1-4L also downregulates cell growth in response to insulin in a phosphorylation-dependent manner ( 20 , 21 ). Upon phosphorylation by the insulin receptor, CEACAM1-4L binds to and sequesters Shc. This downregulates the ras/MAPK mitogenic pathway and, by enhancement the ability of Shc to compete with insulin receptor substrate–1 for phosphorylation, downregulates the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway that mediates cell proliferation and survival ( 21 ). Because EGFR signaling increases more commonly than that of the insulin receptor in advanced cancers of epithelial tissues ( 24 ), we investigated whether CEACAM1-4L is also a substrate of EGFR and whether it decreases cell growth in response to EGF.

Recent data from our laboratory indicate that CEACAM1-4L regulates insulin sensitivity by promoting insulin clearance in liver ( 9 ). It exerts this effect by undergoing internalization as part of the receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis complex and increasing its cellular uptake via clathrin-coated vesicles ( 25 – 28 ). Transgenic mice with liver-specific overexpression of the phosphorylation-defective S 503 A C EA C AM 1 -4L mutant (L-SACC1) develop impaired insulin clearance, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and increased visceral obesity ( 9 ). Manifestations of insulin resistance include elevated levels of plasma FFAs and triglycerides.

Fasting plasma FFAs are commonly elevated in individuals with obesity ( 29 ). Whether visceral obesity develops as a result of increased insulin release to compensate for insulin resistance, as in the L-SACC1 mouse, or as a result of increased intake of high-fat diet, FFAs play a significant role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance ( 30 – 32 ). Thus, visceral obesity is a major determinant of insulin action.

Mounting evidence indicates that visceral obesity increases the death rate from common cancers, including those of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, breast, and ovary ( 33 , 34 ). The high content of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the Western diet has been implicated in this process ( 35 , 36 ). However, the mechanism linking altered metabolic to mitogenic pathways is not completely understood ( 37 ). It may involve activation of EGFR by fatty acids, independently of EGF ( 38 – 42 ).

There is emerging evidence that the adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ, releasing many modulators of metabolism and cell growth into the circulation. In addition to FFAs ( 43 , 44 ), the adipose tissue in obese individuals releases HB-EGF into the portal circulation ( 45 ). Both FFAs and HB-EGF activate the tyrosine kinase of EGFR in epithelial cells. Thus, these adipokines may act as the unifying mechanisms of increased visceral obesity and altered mitogenesis. Given the important role of CEACAM1-4L in the regulation of visceral obesity and tumorigenesis, we used the L-SACC1 mouse to investigate whether CEACAM1-4L constitutes a molecular link between metabolism and growth.

Discussion

In this report, we have shown that CEACAM1-4L is a shared substrate of insulin and EGFRs and that it is phosphorylated by both receptors at the same site. Phosphorylation of CEACAM1-4L by EGFR occurs on Tyr 488 , not Tyr 513 , and it requires prior phosphorylation of Ser 503 . These observations in cellular systems are buttressed by data in L-SACC1–transgenic animals expressing the phosphorylation-defective S503A CEACAM1-4L mutant in liver. Using two different cell types, MCF-7 and Cos-7 cells, we have also shown that transfection of CEACAM1-4L decreases cell growth in response to EGF. As with insulin ( 20 , 25 ), this function of CEACAM1-4L requires its phosphorylation by EGFR, as the long but not the short isoform of CEACAM1 downregulates EGFR-mediated cell growth. In contrast to EGFR and insulin, CEACAM1-4L does not affect cell growth via IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1Rs), which fail to phosphorylate it ( 20 , 25 ). Because EGFR signaling plays a major role in advanced cancers in tissues of epithelial origin ( 24 ), regulation of its mitogenic action by CEACAM1-4L may constitute a potential mechanism of the tumor suppression function of CEACAM1-4L.

The insulin receptor mainly regulates metabolism ( 48 ). Among insulin target tissues, CEACAM1-4L is expressed only in the liver, the major site of insulin clearance, but not in muscle and adipose tissue, where insulin clearance is negligible. Its inactivation in liver impairs insulin clearance, leading to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in L-SACC1 mice. It also causes visceral obesity with high circulating levels of FFAs that are commonly released from the adipose tissue into the portal circulation in insulin resistance and obesity ( 43 , 44 ). The production of HB-EGF in the adipose tissue of L-SACC1 mice is also increased. Consistent with the notion that these adipokines, FFAs and HB-EGF, activate EGFR independently of EGF, EGFR is constitutively activated in L-SACC1 hepatocytes but is inactive in WT hepatocytes. This occurs in the absence of an increase in EGFR levels in L-SACC1 hepatocytes. With its defective phosphorylation in L-SACC1 hepatocytes, the ability of CEACAM1-4L to bind Shc and sequester it is blunted. This in turn increases the amount of Shc available to bind to EGFR and undergo phosphorylation by the receptor, leading to increased coupling of EGFR to the ras/MAPK mitogenesis pathway. Activation of this pathway leads to increased cell proliferation compared with that of WT mice. Because the level of IGF-1R in the hepatocyte is negligible and insulin signaling is downregulated in these insulin-resistant mice, increased cell proliferation and PCNA labeling must be mediated mainly by EGFR activation. The reversal of EGFR activation and cell proliferation in L-SACC1 hepatocytes by a reduction in visceral obesity and plasma adipokines with KT6-207 supports this hypothesis. The promotion of proliferation of hepatocytes in L-SACC1 mice by HB-EGF is in agreement with its reported mitogenic action in liver regeneration ( 49 ) and with its role in normal development, as has been highlighted by the observation that deletion of the gene encoding HB-EGF in mice is lethal ( 50 ). Thus, the L-SACC1 mouse also demonstrates that hepatic CEACAM1-4L inactivation raises the level of insulin, which in turn causes visceral obesity with increased FFAs and HB-EGF output. This in turn activates EGFR in the hepatocyte, independently of EGF, and increases cell proliferation. Our observation is consistent with the notion that by activating the EGFR-dependent mitogenesis pathway, FFAs link altered metabolism with aberrant cell growth ( 38 , 42 ). The association between altered visceral obesity and uncontrolled cell growth is emphasized by the effectiveness of the antidiabetic PPARγ agonists in reducing and preventing tumorigenesis in rodents and cell growth in cell systems ( 51 ).

Because liver inactivation of CEACAM1-4L causes metabolic derangement and increases hepatocyte proliferation in L-SACC1 mice, our data here provide evidence that CEACAM1-4L plays a central role in associating central obesity and insulin resistance with activation of EGFR and aberrant epithelial cell growth. Further studies are needed to examine whether this constitutes a molecular basis of increased neoplastic transformation in states of altered lipid metabolism.
