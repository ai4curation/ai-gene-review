Melanin, which is responsible for virtually all visible skin, hair, and eye 
pigmentation in humans, is synthesized, deposited, and distributed in 
subcellular organelles termed melanosomes. A comprehensive determination of the 
protein composition of this organelle has been obstructed by the melanin 
present. Here, we report a novel method of removing melanin that includes 
in-solution digestion and immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). 
Together with in-gel digestion, this method has allowed us to characterize 
melanosome proteomes at various developmental stages by tandem mass 
spectrometry. Comparative profiling and functional characterization of the 
melanosome proteomes identified approximately 1500 proteins in melanosomes of 
all stages, with approximately 600 in any given stage. These proteins include 16 
homologous to mouse coat color genes and many associated with human pigmentary 
diseases. Approximately 100 proteins shared by melanosomes from pigmented and 
nonpigmented melanocytes define the essential melanosome proteome. Proteins 
validated by confirming their intracellular localization include PEDF 
(pigment-epithelium derived factor) and SLC24A5 (sodium/potassium/calcium 
exchanger 5, NCKX5). The sharing of proteins between melanosomes and other 
lysosome-related organelles suggests a common evolutionary origin. This work 
represents a model for the study of the biogenesis of lysosome-related 
organelles.
