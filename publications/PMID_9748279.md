Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) are a family of proteins that attenuate 
the activity of the trimeric G proteins. RGS proteins act as GTPase-activating 
proteins (GAPs) for the alpha subunits of several trimeric G proteins, much like 
the GAPs that regulate the activity of monomeric G proteins such as Ras. RGS 
proteins have been cloned from many eukaryotes, and those whose biochemical 
activity has been characterized regulate the members of the Gi family of G 
proteins; some forms can also act on Gq proteins. In an ongoing effort to 
elucidate the role of Gzalpha in cell signaling, the yeast two-hybrid system was 
employed to identify proteins that could interact with a mutationally activated 
form of Gzalpha. A novel RGS, termed RGSZ1, was identified that is most closely 
related to two existing RGS proteins termed RetRGS1 and GAIP. Northern blot 
analysis revealed that expression of RGSZ1 was limited to brain, and expression 
was particularly high in the caudate nucleus. Biochemical characterization of 
recombinant RGSZ1 protein revealed that RGSZ1 was indeed a GAP and, most 
significantly, showed a marked preference for Gzalpha over other members of the 
Gialpha family. Phosphorylation of Gzalpha by protein kinase C, an event known 
to occur in cells and that was previously shown to influence alpha-betagamma 
interactions of Gz, rendered the G protein much less susceptible to RGSZ1 
action.
