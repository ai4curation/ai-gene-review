Following ligand binding, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) 
autophosphorylates itself on tyrosine residues located in its carboxyl terminus; 
in vitro, three sites are highly phosphorylated, while two other sites are 
phosphorylated to lesser extents. In the presence of the Src protein-tyrosine 
kinase, in vitro phosphorylation of the minor autophosphorylation sites was 
increased, and four additional residues were phosphorylated. Following EGF 
stimulation, two (Tyr-891 and Tyr-920) were found to be phosphorylated in a 
colorectal cell line (DLD-1) and in a breast tumor cell line (MCF7). The 
remaining in vitro sites were not found to be highly phosphorylated in vivo. The 
sequences surrounding Tyr-891 and Tyr-920 match the reported consensus binding 
sequences for the SH2 domains of Src and the regulatory domain of 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85 alpha), respectively. In vitro, both of these 
proteins were found to bind to Src-phosphorylated EGF-R with approximately 
100-fold greater affinity than to autophosphorylated EGF-R, demonstrating that 
Src creates new sites for SH2 binding. Furthermore, Csk-inactivated Src was 
activated by interaction with Src-phosphorylated EGF-R but not by 
autophosphorylated EGF-R. Upon EGF treatment of MCF7 or three colorectal 
carcinoma cell lines (WiDr, DLD-1, and LS174T), the EGF-R coimmunoprecipitated 
with both p85 alpha and Src. Evidence is also presented that suggests that an 
EGF-R-related protein, ErbB2, may be involved in similar Src-mediated 
interactions. These data demonstrate that EGF-R is phosphorylated in vivo at 
non-autophosphorylation sites and that these novel sites can act as docking 
sites for Src, P85 alpha, and potentially other SH2-containing proteins. In 
addition, the data suggest a tyrosine phosphatase-independent mechanism for the 
elevation of Src activity in cells exposed to growth factors. Overexpression of 
Src, EGF-R, and/or ErbB2 in breast and colorectal tumor cells suggests the 
potential that such interactions may contribute to the transformed phenotype of 
these carcinomas.
