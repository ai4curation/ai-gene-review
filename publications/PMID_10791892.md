site that reduces its activity to promote tubulin polymerization.

p34cdc2 kinase-phosphorylation sites in the microtubule (MT)-binding region of 
MAP4 were determined by peptide sequence of phosphorylated MTB3, a fragment 
containing the carboxy-terminal half of human MAP4. In addition to two 
phosphopeptides containing Ser696 and Ser787 which were previously indicated to 
be in vivo phosphorylation sites, two novel phosphopeptides, containing Thr892 
or Thr901 and Thr917 as possible phosphorylation sites, were isolated, though 
only in in vitro phosphorylation. The role of phosphorylation at Ser696 and 
Ser787, which were differently phosphorylated during the cell cycle (Ookata et 
al., (1997). Biochemistry, 36: 15873-15883), was investigated in 
MT-polymerization, using MAP4 Ser to Glu mutants, which mimic phosphorylation at 
each site. Mutation of Ser787 to Glu strikingly reduced the MAP4's 
MT-polymerization activity, while Glu-mutation at Ser696 did not. These results 
suggest that Ser787 could be the critical phosphorylation site causing MTs to be 
dynamic at mitosis.
