Cyclins are regulatory subunits of cyclin-dependent kinases. Cyclin A, the first 
cyclin ever cloned, is thought to be an essential component of the cell-cycle 
engine. Mammalian cells encode two A-type cyclins, testis-specific cyclin A1 and 
ubiquitously expressed cyclin A2. Here, we tested the requirement for cyclin A 
function using conditional knockout mice lacking both A-type cyclins. We found 
that acute ablation of cyclin A in fibroblasts did not affect cell 
proliferation, but led to prolonged expression of another cyclin, cyclin E, 
across the cell cycle. However, combined ablation of all A- and E-type cyclins 
extinguished cell division. In contrast, cyclin A function was essential for 
cell-cycle progression of hematopoietic and embryonic stem cells. Expression of 
cyclin A is particularly high in these compartments, which might render stem 
cells dependent on cyclin A, whereas in fibroblasts cyclins A and E play 
redundant roles in cell proliferation.
