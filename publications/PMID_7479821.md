The adenovirus type 2/5 E1A proteins transform primary baby rat kidney (BRK) 
cells in cooperation with the activated Ras (T24 ras) oncoprotein. The 
N-terminal half of E1A (exon 1) is essential for this transformation activity. 
While the C-terminal half of E1A (exon 2) is dispensable, a region located 
between residues 225 and 238 of the 243R E1A protein negatively modulates in 
vitro T24 ras cooperative transformation as well as the tumorigenic potential of 
E1A/T24 ras-transformed cells. The same C-terminal domain is also required for 
binding of a cellular 48-kDa phosphoprotein, C-terminal binding protein (CtBP). 
We have cloned the cDNA for CtBP via yeast two-hybrid interaction cloning. The 
cDNA encodes a 439-amino acid (48 kDa) protein that specifically interacts with 
exon 2 in yeast two-hybrid, in vitro protein binding, and in vivo 
coimmunoprecipitation analyses. This protein requires residues 225-238 of the 
243R E1A protein for interaction. The predicted protein sequence of the isolated 
cDNA is identical to amino acid sequences obtained from peptides prepared from 
biochemically purified CtBP. Fine mapping of the CtBP-binding domain revealed 
that a 6-amino acid motif highly conserved among the E1A proteins of various 
human and animal adenoviruses is required for this interaction. These results 
suggest that interaction of CtBP with the E1A proteins may play a critical role 
in adenovirus replication and oncogenic transformation.
