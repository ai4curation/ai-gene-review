Notch1 has been shown to induce glia in the peripheral nervous system. However, 
it has not been known whether Notch can direct commitment to glia from 
multipotent progenitors of the central nervous system. Here we present evidence 
that activated Notch1 and Notch3 promotes the differentiation of astroglia from 
the rat adult hippocampus-derived multipotent progenitors (AHPs). Quantitative 
clonal analysis indicates that the action of Notch is likely to be instructive. 
Transient activation of Notch can direct commitment of AHPs irreversibly to 
astroglia. Astroglial induction by Notch signaling was shown to be independent 
of STAT3, which is a key regulatory transcriptional factor when ciliary 
neurotrophic factor (CNTF) induces astroglia. These data suggest that Notch 
provides a CNTF-independent instructive signal of astroglia differentiation in 
CNS multipotent progenitor cells.
