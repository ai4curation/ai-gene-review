The recognition of terminally misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) and the extraction of these proteins to the cytoplasm for proteasomal 
degradation are determined by a quality control mechanism in the ER. In yeast, 
Yos9p, an ER lectin containing a mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH) 
domain, enhances ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of glycoproteins. We show here 
that human XTP3-B (hXTP3-B), an ER lectin containing two MRH domains, has two 
transcriptional variants, and both isoforms retard ERAD of the human 
alpha(1)-antitrypsin variant null Hong Kong (NHK), a terminally misfolded 
glycoprotein. The hXTP3-B long isoform strongly inhibited ERAD of NHK-QQQ, which 
lacks all of the N-glycosylation sites of NHK, but the short transcriptional 
variant of hXTP3-B had almost no effect. Examination of complex formation by 
immunoprecipitation and by fractionation using sucrose density gradient 
centrifugation revealed that the hXTP3-B long isoform associates with the 
HRD1-SEL1L membrane-anchored ubiquitin ligase complex and BiP, forming a 27 S ER 
quality control scaffold complex. The hXTP3-B short isoform, however, is 
excluded from scaffold formation. Another MRH domain-containing ER lectin, 
hOS-9, is incorporated into this large complex, but gp78, another mammalian 
homolog of the yeast ubiquitin ligase Hrd1p, is not. Based on these results, we 
propose that this large ER quality control scaffold complex, containing ER 
lectins, a chaperone, and a ubiquitin ligase, provides a platform for the 
recognition and sorting of misfolded glycoproteins as well as nonglycosylated 
proteins prior to retrotranslocation into the cytoplasm for degradation.
