Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation leads to autophosphorylation of the 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. The 
Grb2 SH2 domain binds to Tyr1068 of EGFR and Tyr317 of Shc while its SH3 domains 
bind to mSos1. Therefore, EGF treatment potentially results in the formation of 
several multimeric signaling complexes, including EGFR-Grb2-mSos1, 
EGFR-Shc-Grb2-mSos1, and Shc-Grb2-mSos1, linking the receptor to activation of 
the Ras GTPase. We have purified Grb2, mSos1, and the Grb2-mSos1 complex to high 
homogeneity, and used these isolated proteins to obtain binding affinities of 
mSos1 for Grb2 and of either Grb2 or Grb2-mSos1 for phosphotyrosine-containing 
peptides. mSos1 bound Grb2 with a KD of 0.4 microM; the stoichiometry of the 
Grb2-mSos1 complex was 1:1. An EGFR-derived phosphopeptide bound Grb2 with a KD 
of 0.7 microM, whereas the Shc-derived phosphopeptide bound Grb2 with a KD of 
0.2 microM. Since Grb2 exists in a stable complex with mSos1, and both proteins 
can exist in a constitutive complex in unstimulated cells, we performed 
phosphopeptide binding studies on the Grb2-mSos1 complex to gain a better 
understanding of binding events in the intact cell. Grb2-mSos1 bound to both 
EGFR- and Shc-derived phosphopeptides with higher affinities (KD of 0.3 microM 
and 31 nM, respectively) than Grb2 alone. These findings suggest that the 
proximity of mSos1 to Grb2 in the complex can influence the interactions of the 
Grb2 SH2 domain with phosphopeptides and raise the possibility that in the 
Grb2-mSos1 complex the SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2 are not independent of each 
other but may be indirectly linked by mSos1.
