We developed an integrated proteomic approach to decipher in vivo 
protein-protein interactions and applied this strategy to globally map the 26 S 
proteasome interaction network in yeast. We termed this approach QTAX for 
quantitative analysis of tandem affinity purified in vivo cross-linked (X) 
protein complexes. For this work, in vivo formaldehyde cross-linking was used to 
freeze both stable and transient interactions occurring in intact cells prior to 
lysis. To isolate cross-linked protein complexes with high purification 
efficiency under fully denaturing conditions, a new tandem affinity tag 
consisting of a hexahistidine sequence and an in vivo biotinylation signal was 
adopted for affinity-based purification. Tandem affinity purification after in 
vivo cross-linking was combined with tandem mass spectrometry coupled with a 
quantitative SILAC (stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture) 
strategy to carry out unambiguous protein identification and quantification of 
specific protein interactions. Using this method, we captured and identified the 
full composition of yeast 26 S proteasome complex as well as the two known 
ubiquitin receptors, Rad23 and Dsk2. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis 
allowed us to distinguish specific proteasome-interacting proteins (PIPs) from 
background proteins and led to the identification of a total of 64 potential 
PIPs of which 42 are novel interactions. Among the 64 putative specific PIPs, 
there are ubiquitin pathway components, ubiquitinated substrates, chaperones, 
and transcription and translation regulators, demonstrating the efficacy of the 
developed approach in capturing in vivo protein interactions. The method offers 
an advanced technical approach to elucidate the dynamic protein interaction 
networks of the proteasome and can find a wide range of applications in the 
studies of other macromolecular protein complex interaction networks.
