Rodents are the unique species carrying duplicated angiotensin (Ang) type 1 
(AT1) receptor genes, Agtr1a and Agtr1b. After separately generating Agtr1a and 
Agtr1b null mutant mice by gene targeting, we produced double mutant mice 
homozygous for both Agtr1a and Agtr1b null mutation (Agtr1a-/-; Agtr1b-/-) by 
mating the single gene mutants. Agtr1a-/-, Agtr1b-/- mice are characterized by 
normal in utero survival but decreased ex utero survival rate. After birth they 
are characterized by low body weight gain, marked hypotension, and abnormal 
kidney morphology including delayed maturity in glomerular growth, hypoplastic 
papilla, and renal arterial hypertrophy. These abnormal phenotypes are 
quantitatively similar to those found in mutant mice homozygous for the 
angiotensinogen gene (Agt-/-), indicating that major biological functions of 
endogenous Ang elucidated by the abnormal phenotypes of Agt-/- are mediated by 
the AT1 receptors. Infusion of Ang II, AT1 blockers, or an AT2 blocker was 
without effect on blood pressure in Agtr1a-/-; Agtr1b-/- mice, indicating that 
AT2 receptor does not exert acute depressor effects in these mice lacking AT1 
receptors. Also, unlike Agt-/- mice, some Agtr1a-/-; Agtr1b-/- mice have a large 
ventricular septum defect, suggesting that another receptor such as AT2 is 
functionally activated in Agtr1a-/-, Agtr1b-/- mice.
