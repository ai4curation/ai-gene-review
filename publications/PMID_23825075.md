The inhibitor of apoptosis protein survivin is a bifunctional molecule that 
regulates cellular division and survival. We have previously shown that survivin 
protein can be found at high concentrations in the adult kidney, particularly in 
the proximal tubules. Here, survivin is localized primarily at the apical 
membrane, a pattern that may indicate absorption of the protein. Several 
proteins in primary urine are internalized by megalin, an endocytosis receptor, 
which is in principle found in the same localization as survivin. Immunolabeling 
for survivin in different species confirmed survivin signal localizing to the 
apical membrane of the proximal tubule. Immunoelectron microscopy also showed 
apical localization of survivin in human kidneys. Furthermore, in polarized 
human primary tubular cells endogenous as well as external recombinant survivin 
is stored in the apical region of the cells. Costaining of survivin and megalin 
by immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy confirmed colocalization. 
Finally, by surface plasmon resonance we were able to demonstrate that survivin 
binds megalin and cubilin and that megalin knockout mice lose survivin through 
the urine. Survivin accumulates at the apical membrane of the renal tubule by 
reuptake, which is achieved by the endocytic receptor megalin, collaborating 
with cubilin. For this to occur, survivin will have to circulate in the blood 
and be filtered into the primary urine. It is not known at this stage what the 
functional role of tubular survivin is. However, a small number of experimental 
and clinical reports implicate that renal survivin is important for functional 
integrity of the kidney.
