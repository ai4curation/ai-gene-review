Superoxide dismutases (SODs) represent the first line of defense against 
oxidative stress, which is considered an essential factor in several 
neurodegenerative diseases and aging. We investigated the role of the 
copper,zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) in the maintenance of intracellular 
redox homeostasis by analyzing the early effects of SOD1 down-regulation in 
SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Through the use of small interference RNA, SOD1 was 
efficiently down-regulated at 48 h after transfection without any significant 
effect on cell viability. The steady-state concentration of superoxide was 
significantly increased after 12 h, when SOD1 was only slightly decreased, and 
progressively returned to values close to those observed in control cells. The 
superoxide increase was buffered by the enhanced levels of antioxidant 
glutathione (GSH); however, GSH increase was not sufficient to avoid damage to 
proteins in terms of carbonyls. GSH-depleting agents, such as BSO or diamide, 
further increased protein damage and committed SOD1 deficient cells to death, 
confirming the pivotal role played by this antioxidant. Although SOD1 declined 
mostly in the cytosolic compartment, mitochondria were significantly affected 
with impairment of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and a decrease in 
ATP production. Together with these effects carbonylation of mitochondrial 
proteins was detected and in particular a consistent carbonylation and decrease 
of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. These conditions induced a high 
susceptibility of SOD1-depleted cells to treatment with the mitochondrial 
reactive oxygen species producing agent rotenone. Overall, the results 
demonstrate that loss of SOD1 leads to severe damage of mitochondria, suggesting 
an important biological role for this enzyme in the preservation of 
mitochondrial homeostasis.
