Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by the accumulation of a pathogenic 
protein, Huntingtin (Htt), that contains an abnormal polyglutamine expansion. 
Here, we report that a pathogenic fragment of Htt (Httex1p) can be modified 
either by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1 or by ubiquitin on identical 
lysine residues. In cultured cells, SUMOylation stabilizes Httex1p, reduces its 
ability to form aggregates, and promotes its capacity to repress transcription. 
In a Drosophila model of HD, SUMOylation of Httex1p exacerbates 
neurodegeneration, whereas ubiquitination of Httex1p abrogates 
neurodegeneration. Lysine mutations that prevent both SUMOylation and 
ubiquitination of Httex1p reduce HD pathology, indicating that the contribution 
of SUMOylation to HD pathology extends beyond preventing Htt ubiquitination and 
degradation.
