An X-ray structure of the F1 portion of the mitochondrial ATP synthase shows 
asymmetry and differences in nucleotide binding of the catalytic beta subunits 
that support the binding change mechanism with an internal rotation of the gamma 
subunit. Other structural and mutational probes of the F1 and F0 portions of the 
ATP synthase are reviewed, together with kinetic and other evaluations of 
catalytic site occupancy and behavior during hydrolysis or synthesis of ATP. 
Subunit function as related to proton translocation and rotational catalysis is 
considered. Physical demonstrations of the gamma subunit rotation have been 
achieved. The findings have implications for other enzymatic catalyses.
