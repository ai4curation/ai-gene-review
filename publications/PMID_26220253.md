Retrograde transport from the endosome to the Golgi is mediated by a 5 protein 
complex known as the retromer. These five proteins (Vps5, Vps17, Vps26, Vps29, 
and Vps35 in yeast and SNX1/2, SNX5/6, Vps26, Vps29, and Vps35 in mammalian 
cells) act as a coat for vesicles budding off of the endosome, as well as 
perform cargo sorting at the endosome. The retromer is well conserved between 
yeast and mammalian systems, though variations exist within the mammalian 
retromer. Functionally, the retromer has been linked to prominent 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's in human models 
as well as diabetes mellitus. However, the retromer also plays a role in the 
virulence of several microbial pathogens. Despite the current understanding of 
the retromer complex, there are still many questions to be answered in regards 
to its overall role in cell homeostasis.
