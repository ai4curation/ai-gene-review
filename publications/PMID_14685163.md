Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of synthesis and folding of secretory 
proteins. Perturbations of ER homeostasis affect protein folding and cause ER 
stress. ER can sense the stress and respond to it through translational 
attenuation, upregulation of the genes for ER chaperones and related proteins, 
and degradation of unfolded proteins by a quality-control system. However, when 
the ER function is severely impaired, the organelle elicits apoptotic signals. 
ER stress has been implicated in a variety of common diseases such as diabetes, 
ischemia and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the components of the ER 
stress-mediated apoptosis pathway is C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), also known 
as growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153). Here, we 
summarize the current understanding of the roles of CHOP/GADD153 in ER 
stress-mediated apoptosis and in diseases including diabetes, brain ischemia and 
neurodegenerative disease.
