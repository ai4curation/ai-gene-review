Focal adhesions are specialized attachment and signaling centers that form at 
sites of cell-matrix contacts. We employed a quantitative mass 
spectrometry-based method called SILAC to identify and quantify proteins 
interacting in an attachment-dependent manner with focal adhesion proteins. 
Subsequent confocal microscopy revealed a previously undescribed structure, 
which we have termed a spreading initiation center (SIC), existing only in early 
stages of cell spreading. SICs contain focal adhesion markers, appear to be 
surrounded by an actin sheath, and, surprisingly, contain numerous RNA binding 
proteins, ribosomal RNA, and perhaps other RNAs. Interfering with the function 
of FUS/TLS, hnRNP K, and hnRNP E1 results in increased spreading. Spreading 
initiation centers are ribonucleoprotein complexes distinct from focal adhesions 
and demonstrate a role for RNA and RNA binding proteins in the initiation of 
cell spreading.
