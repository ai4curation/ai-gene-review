PURPOSE: To determine whether trabecular meshwork-inducible glucocorticoid 
response/myocilin (TIGR/MYOC) protein associates with the extracellular matrix 
(ECM) of human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells.
METHODS: The extracellular localization of TIGR/MYOC was examined by 
immunofluorescence microscopy in HTM cultures treated with and without 
dexamethasone and ascorbate and in a transformed HTM cell line, TM-1, 
transiently transfected with TIGR/MYOC cDNA. Antibodies to TIGR/MYOC, 
fibronectin, laminin, type IV collagen, or thrombospondin were used to determine 
the extracellular localization of TIGR/MYOC. Solid phase binding assays using 
125I-recombinant TIGR/MYOC and types I and IV collagens, fibronectin, and 
laminin were done to examine the association of TIGR/MYOC with these proteins 
and to identify a specific TIGR/MYOC binding site within fibronectin. The 
domains of fibronectin tested were the fibrin/collagen binding domain, the RGD 
domain, and the Heparin II (Hep II) domain.
RESULTS: TIGR/MYOC colocalized with fibronectin, laminin, and type IV collagen, 
but not thrombospondin in both dexamethasone and dexamethasone/ascorbate-treated 
HTM cultures and in TM-1 cultures transfected with TIGR/MYOC cDNA. In solid 
phase binding assays, 125I-TIGR/MYOC bound fibronectin but not laminin or type 
IV collagen. Binding to fibronectin could be competed with excess TIGR/MYOC or 
fibronectin. Specific binding was found for the Hep II domain of fibronectin.
CONCLUSIONS: TIGR/MYOC can associate with components of the ECM via interactions 
with the Hep II domain of fibronectin. The interactions with the Hep II domain 
of fibronectin could alter cell-matrix interactions in the TM and provides an 
interesting lead to explore the role(s) of TIGR/MYOC in both steroid-induced and 
primary open angle glaucoma.
