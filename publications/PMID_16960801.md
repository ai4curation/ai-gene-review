Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (PAM) is a rare disease characterized by the 
deposition of calcium phosphate microliths throughout the lungs. We first 
identified a PAM locus by homozygosity mapping to 4p15, then identified, by a 
candidate-gene approach, the gene responsible for the disease as SLC34A2 (the 
type IIb sodium-phosphate cotransporter gene), which is involved in phosphate 
homeostasis in several organs. We identified six homozygous exonic mutations in 
the seven unrelated patients with PAM we studied. Three of the mutations were 
frameshifts, one was a chain termination, one was an amino acid substitution, 
and one was a deletion spanning the minimal promoter and the first exon. Absence 
of functional protein product of the gene is compatible with calcium phosphate 
deposition in alveolar airspaces. We show that impaired activity of the 
phosphate transporter is presumably responsible for the microliths and that PAM 
is a recessive monogenic disease with full penetrance. Testicular microlithiasis 
(TM) is a disease that is more common than PAM. It is often associated with 
cancer and infertility. Since the gene we identified is also expressed in 
testis, we searched for mutations in subjects with TM. In 2 of the 15 subjects 
with TM we studied, we identified two rare variants, one synonymous and the 
other noncoding, that are possibly associated with the condition.
