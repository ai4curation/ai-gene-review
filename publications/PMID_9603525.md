Initiation of transcription of a gene from a core promoter region by RNA 
polymerase II requires the assembly of several initiation factors to form a 
preinitiation complex. Assembly of this complex is thought to be nucleated 
exclusively by the sequence-specific binding of the TFIID transcription factor 
complex, which is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated 
factors (TAF(II)s), to the different promoters. Here we isolate and characterize 
a new multiprotein complex that does not contain either TBP or a TBP-like factor 
but is composed of several TAF(II)s and other proteins. This complex can replace 
TFIID on both TATA-containing and TATA-lacking promoters in in vitro 
transcription assays. Moreover, an anti-TBP antibody that inhibits TBP- and 
TFIID-dependent transcription does not inhibit activity of this new complex. 
These results indicate that TBP-free RNA polymerase II mediated transcription 
may be able to occur in mammalian cells and that multiple preinitiation 
complexes may play an important role in regulating gene expression.
