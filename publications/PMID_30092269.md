Loss of MICOS complex integrity and mitochondrial damage, but not TDP-43 
mitochondrial localisation, are likely associated with severity of 
CHCHD10-related diseases.

Following the involvement of CHCHD10 in FrontoTemporal-Dementia-Amyotrophic 
Lateral Sclerosis (FTD-ALS) clinical spectrum, a founder mutation (p.Gly66Val) 
in the same gene was identified in Finnish families with late-onset spinal motor 
neuronopathy (SMAJ). SMAJ is a slowly progressive form of spinal muscular 
atrophy with a life expectancy within normal range. In order to understand why 
the p.Ser59Leu mutation, responsible for severe FTD-ALS, and the p.Gly66Val 
mutation could lead to different levels of severity, we compared their effects 
in patient cells. Unlike affected individuals bearing the p.Ser59Leu mutation, 
patients presenting with SMAJ phenotype have neither mitochondrial myopathy nor 
mtDNA instability. The expression of CHCHD10S59L mutant allele leads to 
disassembly of mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) 
with mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of cristae in patient fibroblasts. We 
also show that G66V fibroblasts do not display the loss of MICOS complex 
integrity and mitochondrial damage found in S59L cells. However, S59L and G66V 
fibroblasts show comparable accumulation of phosphorylated mitochondrial TDP-43 
suggesting that the severity of phenotype and mitochondrial damage do not depend 
on mitochondrial TDP-43 localization. The expression of the CHCHD10G66V allele 
is responsible for mitochondrial network fragmentation and decreased sensitivity 
towards apoptotic stimuli, but with a less severe effect than that found in 
cells expressing the CHCHD10S59L allele. Taken together, our data show that 
cellular phenotypes associated with p.Ser59Leu and p.Gly66Val mutations in 
CHCHD10 are different; loss of MICOS complex integrity and mitochondrial 
dysfunction, but not TDP-43 mitochondrial localization, being likely essential 
to develop a severe motor neuron disease.
