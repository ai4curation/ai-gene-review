Juvenile CLN3 disease (formerly known as juvenile neuronal ceroid 
lipofuscinosis) is a fatal childhood neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
mutations in the CLN3 gene. CLN3 encodes a putative lysosomal transmembrane 
protein with unknown function. Previous cell culture studies using 
CLN3-overexpressing vectors and/or anti-CLN3 antibodies with questionable 
specificity have also localized CLN3 in cellular structures other than 
lysosomes. Osmoregulation of the mouse Cln3 mRNA level in kidney cells was 
recently reported. To clarify the subcellular localization of the CLN3 protein 
and to investigate if human CLN3 expression and localization is affected by 
osmotic changes we generated a stably transfected BHK (baby hamster kidney) cell 
line that expresses a moderate level of myc-tagged human CLN3 under the control 
of the human ubiquitin C promoter. Hyperosmolarity (800 mOsm), achieved by 
either NaCl/urea or sucrose, dramatically increased the mRNA and protein levels 
of CLN3 as determined by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. Under 
isotonic conditions (300 mOsm), human CLN3 was found in a punctate vesicular 
pattern surrounding the nucleus with prominent Golgi and lysosomal 
localizations. CLN3-positive early endosomes, late endosomes and 
cholesterol/sphingolipid-enriched plasma membrane microdomain caveolae were also 
observed. Increasing the osmolarity of the culture medium to 800 mOsm extended 
CLN3 distribution away from the perinuclear region and enhanced the lysosomal 
localization of CLN3. Our results reveal that CLN3 has multiple subcellular 
localizations within the cell, which, together with its expression, prominently 
change following osmotic stress. These data suggest that CLN3 is involved in the 
response and adaptation to cellular stress.
