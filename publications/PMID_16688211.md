The Hsp110 proteins, exclusively found in the eukaryotic cytosol, have 
significant sequence homology to the Hsp70 molecular chaperone superfamily. 
Despite this homology and the cellular abundance of these proteins, the precise 
functional role has remained undefined. Here, we present the intriguing finding 
that the yeast homologue, Sse1p, acts as an efficient nucleotide exchange factor 
(NEF) for both yeast cytosolic Hsp70s, Ssa1p and Ssb1p. The mechanism involves 
formation of a stable nucleotide-sensitive complex, but does not require ATP 
hydrolysis by Sse1p. The NEF activity of Sse1p stimulates in vitro 
Ssa1p-mediated refolding of thermally denatured luciferase, and appears to have 
an essential role in vivo. Overexpression of the only other described cytosolic 
NEF, Fes1p, can partially compensate for a lethal sse1,2Delta phenotype, 
however, the cells are sensitive to stress conditions. Furthermore, in the 
absence of Sse, the in vivo refolding of thermally denatured model proteins is 
affected. This is the first report of a nucleotide exchange activity for the 
Hsp110 class of proteins, and provides a key piece in the puzzle of the cellular 
chaperone network.
