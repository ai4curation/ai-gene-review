In mitogenically stimulated and tyrosine kinase-transformed cells, a substantial 
fraction of the ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) forms a complex with a 
protein termed p190. We have cloned several cDNAs encoding the p190 protein. 
Analysis of the predicted protein sequence reveals three distinct domains with 
homology to previously described sequences. An N-terminal domain of p190 
contains sequence motifs that are found in all of the known GTPases. At the 
C-terminus of the protein is a domain that contains sequences very similar to 
those found in the breakpoint cluster region gene product, n-chimerin, and rho 
GAP, all of which have been shown to possess intrinsic GAP activity on small 
GTPases. Finally, a 778 aa segment in the middle of p190 is nearly identical in 
sequence to a recently described transcriptional repressor. This raises the 
possibility that p190, acting via GAP, can transduce signals from p21ras to the 
nucleus, perhaps affecting expression of specific cellular genes.
