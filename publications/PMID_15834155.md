Dynamin function is mediated in part through association of its proline-rich 
domain (PRD) with the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of several putative binding 
proteins. To assess the specificity and kinetics of this process, we undertook 
surface plasmon resonance studies of the interaction between isolated PRDs of 
dynamin-1 and -2 and several purified SH3 domains. Glutathione 
S-transferase-linked SH3 domains bound with high affinity (K(D) approximately 10 
nm to 1 microm) to both dynamin-1 and -2. The simplest interaction appeared to 
take place with the amphiphysin-SH3 domain; this bound to a single high affinity 
site (K(D) approximately 10 nm) in the C terminus of dynamin-1 PRD, as predicted 
by previous studies. Binding to the dynamin-2 PRD was also monophasic but with a 
slightly lower affinity (K(D) approximately 25 nm). Endophilin-SH3 binding to 
both dynamin-1 and -2 PRDs was biphasic, with one high affinity site (K(D) 
approximately 14 nm) in the N terminus of the PRD and another lower affinity 
site (K(D) approximately 60 nm) in the C terminus of dynamin-1. The N-terminal 
site in dynamin-2 PRD had a 10-fold lower affinity for endophilin-SH3. 
Preloading of dynamin-1 PRD with the amphiphysin-SH3 domain partially occluded 
binding of the endophilin-SH3 domain, indicating overlap between the binding 
sites in the C terminus, but endophilin was still able to interact with the high 
affinity N-terminal site. This shows that more than one SH3 domain can 
simultaneously bind to the PRD and suggests that competition probably occurs in 
vivo between different SH3-containing proteins for the limited number of PXXP 
motifs. Endophilin-SH3 binding to the high affinity site was disrupted when 
dynamin-1 PRD was phosphorylated with Cdk5, indicating that this site overlaps 
the phosphorylation sites, but amphiphysin-SH3 binding was unaffected. Other SH3 
domains showed similarly complex binding characteristics, and substantial 
differences were noted between the PRDs from dynamin-1 and -2. For example, SH3 
domains from c-Src, Grb2, and intersectin bound only to the C-terminal half of 
dynamin-2 PRD but to both the N- and C-terminal portions of dynamin-1 PRD. Thus, 
differential binding of SH3 domain-containing proteins to dynamin-1 and -2 may 
contribute to the distinct functions performed by these isoforms.
