Cardiolipin and phosphatidic acid-binding protein (CLPABP) controls the 
stability of the mRNA harboring an AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3' UTR with the 
help of the RNA stabilizer, human antigen R (HuR). Although CLPABP is localized 
on the mitochondrial surface as a large protein-RNA complex, its precise role is 
not yet known. Recently, CLPABP was identified as an N-myristoylated protein. 
Here, we demonstrate the effects of N-myristoylation on the functions of CLPABP. 
In the present study, compared to the wild-type protein that possessed the "MG" 
motif at the N-terminus for N-myristoylation, the mutant CLPABP protein that 
lacked N-myristoylation modification site was unstable. Furthermore, the 
expression of the G/A mutant of CLPABP, which lacked N-myristoylation site, 
induced morphological alterations in mitochondria. Because pleckstrin homology 
domain-deleted mutant, which was fused with the N-myristoylation site derived 
from intact CLPABP, could not colocalize with mitochondria, N-myristoylation of 
CLPABP was predicted to affect its stability onto the mitochondrial membrane 
rather than its subcellular localization.
