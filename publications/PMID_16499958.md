The interaction between ubiquitinated proteins and intracellular proteins 
harboring ubiquitin binding domains (UBDs) is critical to a multitude of 
cellular processes. Here, we report that Rabex-5, a guanine nucleotide exchange 
factor for Rab5, binds to Ub through two independent UBDs. These UBDs determine 
a number of properties of Rabex-5, including its coupled monoubiquitination and 
interaction in vivo with ubiquitinated EGFRs. Structural and biochemical 
characterization of the UBDs of Rabex-5 revealed that one of them (MIU, motif 
interacting with ubiquitin) binds to Ub with modes superimposable to those of 
the UIM (ubiquitin-interacting motif):Ub interaction, although in the opposite 
orientation. The other UBD, RUZ (Rabex-5 ubiquitin binding zinc finger) binds to 
a surface of Ub centered on Asp58(Ub) and distinct from the "canonical" 
Ile44(Ub)-based surface. The two binding surfaces allow Ub to interact 
simultaneously with different UBDs, thus opening new perspectives in Ub-mediated 
signaling.
