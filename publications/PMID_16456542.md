PTEN, a tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in many human cancers, directly 
antagonizes the activity of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) by 
dephosphorylating phosphoinositides. We show here that PTEN interacts directly 
with the NHERF1 and NHERF2 (Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor) homologous 
adaptor proteins through the PDZ motif of PTEN and the PDZ1 domain of NHERF1 or 
both PDZ domains of NHERF2. NHERFs were shown to interact directly with 
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and we demonstrate the assembly 
of a ternary complex between PTEN, NHERFs and PDGFR. The activation of the PI3K 
pathway after PDGFR stimulation was prolonged in NHERF1(-/-) mouse embryonic 
fibroblasts as compared to wild-type cells, consistent with defective PTEN 
recruitment to PDGFR in the absence of NHERF1. Depletion of NHERF2 by small 
interfering RNA similarly increased PI3K signaling. Phenotypically, the loss of 
NHERF1 enhanced the PDGF-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements and chemotactic 
migration of the cells. These data indicate that, in normal cells, NHERF 
proteins recruit PTEN to PDGFR to restrict the activation of the PI3K.

Abstract

PTEN, a tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in many human cancers, directly antagonizes the activity of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides. We show here that PTEN interacts directly with the NHERF1 and NHERF2 (Na + /H + exchanger regulatory factor) homologous adaptor proteins through the PDZ motif of PTEN and the PDZ1 domain of NHERF1 or both PDZ domains of NHERF2. NHERFs were shown to interact directly with platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and we demonstrate the assembly of a ternary complex between PTEN, NHERFs and PDGFR. The activation of the PI3K pathway after PDGFR stimulation was prolonged in NHERF1(−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts as compared to wild-type cells, consistent with defective PTEN recruitment to PDGFR in the absence of NHERF1. Depletion of NHERF2 by small interfering RNA similarly increased PI3K signaling. Phenotypically, the loss of NHERF1 enhanced the PDGF-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements and chemotactic migration of the cells. These data indicate that, in normal cells, NHERF proteins recruit PTEN to PDGFR to restrict the activation of the PI3K.

Introduction

PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene frequently inactivated in human cancers ( Li et al , 1997 ; Steck et al , 1997 ). In addition, germline mutations in the PTEN gene are the cause of Cowden and Bannayan–Riley–Ruvalcaba syndromes ( Waite and Eng, 2002 ). PTEN is formed of an amino-terminal (NT) phosphatase domain, a phospholipid-binding C2 domain and a carboxy-terminal (CT) tail region that contains Ser-Thr phosphorylation sites and a PDZ (PSD-95/Disc-large/ZO-1)-binding motif ( Lee et al , 1999 ; Vazquez et al , 2000 ). PTEN antagonizes the activity of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP 3 ) to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ( Maehama and Dixon, 1998 ). PIP 3 recruits and activates pleckstrin-homology-containing molecules such as the Ser-Thr kinase Akt/PKB, triggering the activation of multiple downstream effectors. These control cell survival, growth, proliferation and other cellular processes. The PI3K pathway is activated by a plethora of extracellular stimuli. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent activator of the PI3K in many cell types. PDGF family comprises four members, A, B, C and D, that are secreted as dimers, with roles in both normal growth and pathologies associated with tissue overgrowth such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer ( Heldin and Westermark, 1999 ). PDGFs bind and signal through two cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinases, PDGFRα and PDGFRβ. PDGF-dependent receptor dimerization is prerequisite for receptor autophosphorylation and subsequent signal propagation. Through tyrosine residues located in the intracellular domain, the receptor dimers recruit and activate several Src homology 2-domain-containing proteins, such as the p85 subunit of PI3K, phospholipase C-γ, SHP2 phosphatase and Src family kinases. PDGFRs also contain a CT PDZ-binding motif that was described to bind the adaptor molecule NHERF1/EBP50 (Na + /H + exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) regulatory factor 1/ezrin–radixin–moesin (ERM)-binding phosphoprotein 50) ( Maudsley et al , 2000 ). NHERF1 was independently identified as a partner for ERM proteins ( Reczek et al , 1997 ) and for NHE3 ( Weinman et al , 1998 ). NHERF2, also identified as an NHE3-interacting protein ( Yun et al , 1997 ), shares 52% identity and conserved domain architecture with NHERF1. Both NHERFs contain two NT PDZ domains and a CT ERM-binding region and were shown to interact with PDGFR via their PDZ1 domain ( Maudsley et al , 2000 ; Jung Kang et al , 2004 ). However, the significance of this association in the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and PI3K by PDGF is controversial ( Maudsley et al , 2000 ; Demoulin et al , 2003 ; Jung Kang et al , 2004 ).

If the function of PTEN as phosphoinositide phosphatase is well documented, the regulation of its activity is still poorly understood. Our previous work indicated that the recruitment of PTEN to the plasma membrane is crucial for its tumor suppressor function ( Georgescu et al , 2000 ; Sumitomo et al , 2004 ). Several PTEN-interacting proteins were proposed to recruit PTEN at the membrane ( Wu et al , 2000a , 2000b ; Sumitomo et al , 2004 ; Kotelevets et al , 2005 ). Of these, the scaffolding membrane-associated guanylate kinase with inverted orientation (MAGI) proteins 1b, 2 and 3 ( Wu et al , 2000a , 2000b ; Kotelevets et al , 2005 ) were reported to interact with PTEN via PTEN's PDZ motif. However, their role in regulating PTEN tumor suppressor function is not yet clearly defined. In this study, we found that PTEN interacts with the NHERF adaptor proteins. We show the formation of a ternary complex between PTEN, NHERF proteins and PDGFR. By using NHERF1(+/+) and (−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in combination with small interfering RNA (siRNA) depletion of NHERF2, we showed specific enhancement of the PI3K pathway activation after PDGFR stimulation in cells lacking NHERF proteins. These data are consistent with our model in which PTEN is recruited by NHERF proteins to restrict the PI3K signaling downstream of PDGFR.

Discussion

In this study, we addressed the question of how PTEN, a cytoplasmic protein, contacts its enzymatic substrate in the membrane. Candidate proteins that can recruit PTEN to the membrane have been identified previously, and these include the MAGI proteins and NEP ( Wu et al , 2000a , 2000b ; Sumitomo et al , 2004 ; Kotelevets et al , 2005 ). We described here the interaction of PTEN with the two homologous NHERF proteins, which are localized at the plasma membrane in physiological conditions ( Ingraffea et al , 2002 ). Similarly to MAGI proteins, NHERF proteins interacted via their PDZ domains with the PDZ motif of PTEN. This interaction was increased by dephosphorylation of S380/T382/T383 in the tail of PTEN that most likely exposes PTEN's PDZ motif. Whereas the MAGI proteins that contain six PDZ domains have not been shown to interact with PDGFR, both NHERF proteins were shown to associate with PDGFR through a PDZ-domain-mediated interaction with the CT PDZ motif of PGDFR ( Maudsley et al , 2000 ; Jung Kang et al , 2004 ). We showed by in vitro overlay assays that both NHERF proteins assembled a complex between PTEN and the intracellular domain of PDGFR. Unlike a recent report that indicated direct association between PTEN and PDGFR ( Mahimainathan and Ghosh Choudhury, 2004 ), we found that PTEN and PDGFR did not interact directly and required the presence of NHERF proteins for complex formation ( Figure 8 ). We also showed the assembly of a ternary complex between PTEN, NHERF2 and PDGFR in mouse brain lysate that appeared to fractionate in a high MW (>669 kDa) elution peak by gel filtration.

The data describing the effects of the association between NHERF proteins and PDGFR on PDGFR signaling are controversial in the literature ( Maudsley et al , 2000 ; Demoulin et al , 2003 ; Jung Kang et al , 2004 ). These differences could be due to the fact that most of these studies were performed with overexpressed proteins that can induce experimental artifacts. To avoid these drawbacks, we used normal MEFs in which the endogenous NHERF1 was depleted by gene inactivation ( Morales et al , 2004 ) and NHERF2 by direct siRNA treatment. In contrast to overexpressed NHERF1 that is detected in both membrane and cytoplasmic compartments, we detected NHERF1 only in the membrane fractions from MEFs, suggesting a physiological subcellular localization for NHERF1 in these cells. We found that in NHERF1(−/−) as compared to (+/+) MEFs, the activation of the PI3K pathway and not of Erk was increased after stimulation with PDGF. These results indicated that NHERF1 is necessary for the attenuation of the PI3K pathway, most likely in complex with PDGFR and PTEN ( Figure 8 ). In support of this model, it was reported that stimulation of a PDZ motif mutant PDGFR that was unable to bind NHERF1 induced higher Akt but not Erk activation in comparison to the wild-type PDGFR ( Demoulin et al , 2003 ).

The depletion of NHERF2 by siRNA treatment in NHERF1(−/−) MEFs raised also the level of PI3K activation after PDGF stimulation, suggesting functional redundancy between NHERFs. Although NHERF1 and NHERF2 are coexpressed in MEFs, their expression is generally not overlapping in the same cells from adult tissues ( Ingraffea et al , 2002 ), arguing against redundancy in the living organism. NHERF1 and NHERF2 exhibited also molecular differences in complex formation with PTEN and PDGFR. The PDZ1 domain of NHERF1 was the exclusive interactor of both PTEN and PDGFR. For NHERF2, the PDZ2 domain interacted with both PDGFR and PTEN, and PDZ1 interacted weakly with PTEN. Nevertheless, both PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of NHERF proteins were necessary for bridging PTEN to PDGFR. NHERF proteins were shown to self-associate through PDZ–PDZ interactions ( Fouassier et al , 2000 ; Lau and Hall, 2001 ; Shenolikar et al , 2001 ) and the requirement for both PDZ domains most likely reflects the necessity for oligomerized NHERF proteins in the ternary complex formation ( Figure 8 ). The ability to engage in protein complexes in vivo appeared different for NHERF2 and NHERF1. The analysis of complexes from brain extracts separated by gel filtration showed participation of NHERF2 in a high MW complex where PTEN and PDGFR also co-eluted. NHERF1 was not detected in this complex. We are currently investigating whether NHERF1 may be artificially dissociated from complexes by detergent solubilization of membranes or whether it participates to a very limited extent in protein complexes, as reported in the case of its association with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( Li et al , 2004 ).

We found that only a small fraction of PTEN from brain extracts eluted in the high MW complex. Vazquez et al (2000) reported that this fraction is not phosphorylated on Ser-380 and presumably can engage in interactions with PDZ-domain-containing proteins. By depleting PTEN from brain lysate with antibodies directed to PTEN's CT or NT, we found that only the NT antibody partially depleted PTEN from this high MW complex. This clearly indicates that PTEN associates through its CT to proteins from the high MW complexes. Although PTEN's PDZ motif is not required for PTEN-mediated growth suppression of PTEN-deficient cancer cell lines ( Georgescu et al , 1999 ), it was elegantly shown to be necessary for the inhibition by PTEN of PDGF-induced membrane ruffling ( Leslie et al , 2000 ). We have found that NHERF1 is also required for inhibiting PDGF-induced membrane ruffling and chemotactic migration. As PTEN interacts through its PDZ motif with NHERF proteins, the absence of either the PDZ motif of PTEN or of NHERF proteins would prevent the formation of the PTEN–NHERF–PDGFR complex with inhibitory effect on the activation of the PI3K. Several studies indicated that pharmacological inhibition of PI3K blocked the cytoskeletal rearrangements and chemotaxis induced by PDGF ( Wymann and Arcaro, 1994 ; Hooshmand-Rad et al , 1997 ). From our study, these processes appear to be physiologically regulated in normal fibroblasts by PTEN in complex with NHERF proteins and PDGFR.

This study clarifies that NHERF proteins suppress PI3K signaling and PDGF-induced cell motility and points to a helper role for NHERF proteins in PTEN tumor suppressor activity. Unlike PTEN-deficient mice, NHERF1-deficient animals do not present a significantly higher rate of tumor development compared to controls (data not shown), but crosses between PTEN and NHERF1-deficient mice will indicate whether NHERF1 has a helper role for oncogenesis in vivo . In humans, point mutations and loss of heterozygosity of NHERF1 were recently described in advanced breast cancers ( Dai et al , 2004 ). A careful examination of the NHERFs' status in tumors harboring wild-type PTEN but increased PI3K activation will further elucidate the importance of the PTEN–NHERF connection for cancer progression.
