Organisms use the daily cycles of light and darkness to synchronize their 
internal circadian clocks with the environment. Because they optimize 
physiological processes and behavior, properly synchronized circadian clocks are 
thought to be important for the overall fitness. In Drosophila melanogaster, the 
circadian clock is synchronized with the natural environment by light-dependent 
degradation of the clock protein Timeless, mediated by the blue-light 
photoreceptor Cryptochrome (Cry). Here we report identification of a genetic 
variant, Veela, which severely disrupts this process, because these genetically 
altered flies maintain behavioral and molecular rhythmicity under constant-light 
conditions that usually stop the clock. We show that the Veela strain carries a 
natural timeless allele (ls-tim), which encodes a less-light-sensitive form of 
Timeless in combination with a mutant variant of the F-box protein Jetlag. 
However, neither the ls-tim nor the jetlag genetic variant alone is sufficient 
to disrupt light input into the central pacemaker. We show a strong interaction 
between Veela and cryptochrome genetic variants, demonstrating that the Jetlag, 
Timeless, and Cry proteins function in the same pathway. Veela also reveals a 
function for the two natural variants of timeless, which differ in their 
sensitivity to light. In combination with the complex array of retinal and 
extraretinal photoreceptors known to signal light to the pacemaker, this 
previously undescribed molecular component of photic sensitivity mediated by the 
two Timeless proteins reveals that an unexpectedly rich complexity underlies 
modulation of this process.
