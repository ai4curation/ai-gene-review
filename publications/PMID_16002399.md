We previously reported that the reductive activities of yeast protein-disulfide 
isomerase (PDI) family proteins did not completely explain their contribution to 
the viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Kimura, T., Hosoda, Y., Kitamura, Y., 
Nakamura, H., Horibe, T., and Kikuchi, M. (2004) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 
320, 359-365). In this study, we examined oxidative refolding activities and 
found that Mpd1p, Mpd2, and Eug1p exhibit activities of 13.8, 16.0, and 2.16%, 
respectively, compared with Pdi1p and that activity for Eps1p is undetectable. 
In analyses of interactions between yeast PDI proteins and endoplasmic reticulum 
molecular chaperones, we found that Mpd1p alone does not have chaperone activity 
but that it interacts with and inhibits the chaperone activity of Cne1p, a 
homologue of mammalian calnexin, and that Cne1p increases the reductive activity 
of Mpd1p. These results suggest that the interface between Mpd1p and Cne1p is 
near the peptide-binding site of Cne1p. In addition, Eps1p interacts with Pdi1p, 
Eug1p, Mpd1p, and Kar2p with dissociation constants (KD) in the range of 10(-7) 
to 10(-6). Interestingly, co-chaperone activities were completely suppressed in 
Eps1p-Pdi1p and Eps1p-Mpd1p complexes, although only Eps1p and Pdi1p have 
chaperone activity. The in vivo consequences of these results are discussed.
