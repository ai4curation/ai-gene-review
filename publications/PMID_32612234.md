Plant hormones coordinate responses to environmental cues with developmental 
programs1, and are fundamental for stress resilience and agronomic yield2. The 
core signalling pathways underlying the effects of phytohormones have been 
elucidated by genetic screens and hypothesis-driven approaches, and extended by 
interactome studies of select pathways3. However, fundamental questions remain 
about how information from different pathways is integrated. Genetically, most 
phenotypes seem to be regulated by several hormones, but transcriptional 
profiling suggests that hormones trigger largely exclusive transcriptional 
programs4. We hypothesized that protein-protein interactions have an important 
role in phytohormone signal integration. Here, we experimentally generated a 
systems-level map of the Arabidopsis phytohormone signalling network, consisting 
of more than 2,000 binary protein-protein interactions. In the highly 
interconnected network, we identify pathway communities and hundreds of 
previously unknown pathway contacts that represent potential points of 
crosstalk. Functional validation of candidates in seven hormone pathways reveals 
new functions for 74% of tested proteins in 84% of candidate interactions, and 
indicates that a large majority of signalling proteins function pleiotropically 
in several pathways. Moreover, we identify several hundred largely 
small-molecule-dependent interactions of hormone receptors. Comparison with 
previous reports suggests that noncanonical and nontranscription-mediated 
receptor signalling is more common than hitherto appreciated.
