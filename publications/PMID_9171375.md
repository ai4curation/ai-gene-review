Transcription by RNA polymerase III involves recruitment of the polymerase by 
template-bound accessory factors, followed by initiation, elongation, and 
termination steps. An immunopurification approach has been used to demonstrate 
that human RNA Pol III is composed of 16 subunits, some of which are apparently 
modified in HeLa cells. Partial denaturing conditions and sucrose gradient 
sedimentation at high salt result in the dissociation of a subcomplex that 
includes hRPC32, hRPC39, and hRPC62. Cognate cDNAs were isolated and shown to 
encode three subunits that are specific to RNA Pol III and homologous to three 
yeast subunits. The human RNA Pol III core lacking the subcomplex functions in 
transcription elongation and termination following nonspecific initiation on a 
tailed template, but fails to show promoter-dependent transcription initiation 
in conjunction with accessory factors. The capability for specific transcription 
initiation can be restored either by the natural subcomplex or by a stable 
subcomplex composed of recombinant hRPC32, hRPC39, and hRPC62 polypeptides. One 
component (hRPC39) of this subcomplex interacts physically with both hTBP and 
hTFIIIB90, two subunits of human RNA Pol III transcription initiation factor 
IIIB. These data strongly suggest that the hRPC32-hRPC39-hRPC62 subcomplex 
directs RNA Pol III binding to the TFIIIB-DNA complex via the interactions 
between TFIIIB and hRPC39.
