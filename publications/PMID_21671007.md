The BH3-only Bcl-2 subfamily member Bim is a well known apoptosis promoting 
protein. However, the mechanisms upstream of mitochondrion membrane permeability 
by which Bim is involved in apoptosis have been poorly investigated, 
particularly in response to agents capable of interfering with the cytoskeleton 
architecture and arresting cells in mitosis. Based on the observation that Bim 
is sequestered on the microtubule-array by interaction with the light chain of 
dynein, we have investigated upon depolymerisation, whether Bim could be 
involved in the commitment of apoptosis. With this purpose H460 Non Small Lung 
Cancer Cells (NSLC) were treated with the microtubule damaging agent 
combretastatin-A4 (CA-4) (7.5 nM; 8-48 h), and various parameters were 
investigated. Upon treatment, cells arrested in mitosis and died through a 
caspase-3-dependent mitotic catastrophe. Transient knock down of Bim drastically 
reduced apoptosis, indicating that this protein was involved in cell death as 
induced by microtubules disorganisation. In response to increasing conditions of 
microtubules depolymerisation, we found that the protein level of Bim was 
strongly upregulated in a time-dependent manner at transcriptional level. 
Furthermore, Bim was released from microtubule-associated components. Bim was 
translocated to mitochondria, even in a condition of protein synthesis 
inhibition, where it showed a markedly increased interaction with Bcl-2. In 
turn, the fraction of Bax bound to Bcl-2 decreases in response to treatment, 
thereby indicating that Bim possibly promotes Bax release from the pro-survival 
protein Bcl-2. Overall, we demonstrated that Bim is required for the 
CA-4-induced cell death in the H460 lung cancer cell line via activation of the 
mitochondrial signalling pathway. Defining the contribution of Bim to the 
mechanism of apoptosis may offer some different clues in view of developing new 
strategies for chemotherapy with CA-4, underlining the relevance of the 
cytoskeleton integrity in the apoptotic response.
