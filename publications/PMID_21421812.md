Arabidopsis thaliana APO1 is required for the accumulation of the chloroplast 
photosystem I and NADH dehydrogenase complexes and had been proposed to 
facilitate the incorporation of [4Fe-4S] clusters into these complexes. The 
identification of maize (Zea mays) APO1 in coimmunoprecipitates with a protein 
involved in chloroplast RNA splicing prompted us to investigate a role for APO1 
in splicing. We show here that APO1 promotes the splicing of several chloroplast 
group II introns: in Arabidopsis apo1 mutants, ycf3-intron 2 remains completely 
unspliced, petD intron splicing is strongly reduced, and the splicing of several 
other introns is compromised. These splicing defects can account for the loss of 
photosynthetic complexes in apo1 mutants. Recombinant APO1 from both maize and 
Arabidopsis binds RNA with high affinity in vitro, demonstrating that DUF794, 
the domain of unknown function that makes up almost the entirety of APO1, is an 
RNA binding domain. We provide evidence that DUF794 harbors two motifs that 
resemble zinc fingers, that these bind zinc, and that they are essential for 
APO1 function. DUF794 is found in a plant-specific protein family whose members 
are all predicted to localize to mitochondria or chloroplasts. Thus, DUF794 adds 
a new example to the repertoire of plant-specific RNA binding domains that 
emerged as a product of nuclear-organellar coevolution.

This study demonstrates that APO1, originally proposed to be involved in the maturation of proteins with [4Fe-4S] ligands, is instead required for the splicing of several chloroplast introns. It shows further that DUF794, the plant-specific domain of unknown function that makes up the bulk of APO1, is an RNA binding domain harboring zinc binding motifs.
