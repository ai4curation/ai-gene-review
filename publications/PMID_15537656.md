In pancreatic beta cells, insulin granule exocytosis is regulated by SNARE 
(soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor protein 
(SNAP) receptor) proteins, and this is coupled to cortical F-actin 
reorganization via the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 by an unknown mechanism. We 
investigated interactions among the target SNARE protein Syntaxin 1A and the 
vesicle-associated membrane SNARE protein (VAMP2) with Cdc42 and compared these 
structural interactions with their functional importance to glucose-stimulated 
insulin secretion in MIN6 beta cells. Subcellular fractionation analyses 
revealed a parallel redistribution of Cdc42 and VAMP2 from the granule fraction 
to the plasma membrane in response to glucose that temporally corresponded with 
the glucose-induced activation of Cdc42. Moreover, within these fractions Cdc42 
and VAMP2 were found to co-immunoprecipitate under basal and glucose-stimulated 
conditions, suggesting that they moved as a complex. Furthermore, VAMP2 bound 
both GST-Cdc42-GTPgammaS and GST-Cdc42-GDP, indicating that the Cdc42-VAMP2 
complex could form under both cytosolic GDP-bound Cdc42 and plasma membrane 
GTP-bound Cdc42 conformational conditions. In vitro binding analyses showed that 
VAMP2 bound directly to Cdc42 and that a heterotrimeric complex with Syntaxin 1A 
could also be formed. Deletion analyses of VAMP2 revealed that only the 
N-terminal 28 residues were required for Cdc42 binding. Expression of this 
28-residue VAMP2 peptide in MIN6 beta cells resulted in the specific impairment 
of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, indicating a functional importance for 
the Cdc42-VAMP2 interaction. Taken together, these data suggest a mechanism 
whereby glucose activates Cdc42 to induce the targeting of intracellular 
Cdc42-VAMP2-insulin granule complexes to Syntaxin 1A at the plasma membrane.
