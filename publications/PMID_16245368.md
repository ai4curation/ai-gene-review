The docking protein p130Cas (Cas) becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in its central 
substrate domain in response to extracellular stimuli such as integrin-mediated 
cell adhesion, and transmits signals through interactions with various 
intracellular signaling molecules such as the adaptor protein Crk. Src-family 
kinases (SFKs) bind a specific site in the carboxyl-terminal region of Cas and 
subsequently SFKs phosphorylate progressively the substrate domain in Cas. In 
this study crystallography, mutagenesis and binding assays were used to 
understand the molecular basis for Cas interactions with SFKs. Tyrosine 
phosphorylation regulates binding of Cas to SFKs, and the primary site for this 
phosphorylation, Y762, has been proposed. A phosphorylated peptide corresponding 
to Cas residues 759MEDpYDYVHL767 containing the key phosphotyrosine was 
crystallized in complex with the SH3-SH2 domain of the SFK Lck. The results 
provide the first structural data for this protein-protein interaction. The 
motif in Cas 762pYDYV binds to the SH2 domain in a mode that mimics 
high-affinity ligands, involving dual contacts of Y762 and V765 with conserved 
residues in SFK SH2 domains. In addition, Y764 is in position to make an 
electrostatic contact after phosphorylation with a conserved SFK arginine that 
mediates interactions with other high-affinity SH2 binders. These new molecular 
data suggest that Cas may regulate activity of Src as a competing ligand to 
displace intramolecular interactions that occur in SFKs (between the C-terminal 
tail and the SH2 domain) and restrain and down-regulate the kinase in an 
inactive form.
