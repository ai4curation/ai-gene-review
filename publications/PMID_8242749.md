The ubiquitously expressed c-Abl tyrosine kinase is localized to the nucleus and 
binds to DNA. The DNA binding activity is regulated by cdc2-mediated 
phosphorylation, suggesting a cell cycle function for c-Abl. Here we show that 
the tyrosine kinase activity of nuclear c-Abl is regulated in the cell cycle 
through a specific interaction with the retinoblastoma protein (RB). A domain in 
the C-terminus of RB, outside of the A/B pocket, binds to the ATP-binding lobe 
of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase, resulting in kinase inhibition. The RB-c-Abl 
interaction is not affected by the viral oncoproteins that bind to RB. 
Hyperphosphorylation of RB correlates with release of c-Abl and activation of 
the tyrosine kinase in S phase cells. The nuclear c-Abl tyrosine kinase can 
enhance transcription, and this activity is inhibited by RB. Nuclear c-Abl is an 
S phase-activated tyrosine kinase that may participate directly in the 
regulation of transcription.
