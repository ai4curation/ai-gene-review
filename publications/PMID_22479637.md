Interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins restrict the entry processes 
of several pathogenic viruses, including the flaviviruses West Nile virus and 
dengue virus (DENV). DENV infects cells directly or via antibody-dependent 
enhancement (ADE) in Fc-receptor-bearing cells, a process thought to contribute 
to severe disease in a secondary infection. Here we investigated whether 
ADE-mediated DENV infection bypasses IFITM-mediated restriction or whether IFITM 
proteins can be protective in a secondary infection. We observed that IFITM 
proteins restricted ADE-mediated and direct infection with comparable 
efficiencies in a myelogenous leukemia cell line. Our data suggest that IFITM 
proteins can contribute to control of secondary DENV infections.
