Natural killer (NK) cells express killer inhibitory receptors that mediate 
negative regulation of NK cell cytotoxicity upon binding to MHC class I 
molecules on target cells. Unrelated inhibitory receptors on B cells have 
recently been shown to function through recruitment of phosphotyrosine 
phosphatase 1C (PTP-1C). Here, we show that a human killer inhibitory receptor 
specific for HLA-C also recruits PTP-1C after phosphorylation induced either by 
the pharmacological agent phenylarsine oxide or by conjugation with target 
cells. This recruitment is mediated by the binding of specific cytoplasmic 
phosphotyrosine-containing sequences to PTP-1C. These results implicate PTP-1C 
as a cytosolic component of the negative signaling pathway through NK cell 
inhibitory receptors.
