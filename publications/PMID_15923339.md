Plant responses to enemies are coordinated by several interacting signaling 
systems. Molecular and genetic studies with mutants and exogenous signal 
application suggest that jasmonate (JA)-, salicylate (SA)-, and ethylene 
(ET)-mediated pathways modulate expression of portions of the defense phenotype 
in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), but have not yet linked these 
observations directly with plant responses to insect attack. We compared the 
glucosinolate (GS) profiles of rosette leaves of 4-week-old mutant and 
transgenic Arabidopsis (Columbia) plants compromised in these three major 
signaling pathways, and characterized responses by those plants to feeding by 
two phloem-feeding aphids (generalist Myzus persicae and specialist Brevicoryne 
brassicae) and one generalist caterpillar species (Spodoptera exigua Hubner). 
Blocked JA signaling in coronatine-insensitive (coi1) and enhanced expression of 
SA-signaled disease resistance in hypersensitive response-like (hrl1) mutants 
reduced constitutive GS concentrations, while blocking SA signaling at the 
mediator protein npr1 mutant (NPR) increased them. There was no significant 
impact on constitutive GS contents of blocking ET signaling (at ET resistant 
[etr1]) or reducing SA concentrations (nahG transgene). We found increased GS 
accumulation in response to insect feeding, which required functional NPR1 and 
ETR1 but not COI1 or SA. Insect feeding caused increases primarily in 
short-chain aliphatic methylsulfinyl GS. By contrast, responses to exogenous JA, 
a frequent experimental surrogate for insect attack, were characterized by an 
increase in indolyl GS. Insect performance, measured as population increase or 
weight increase, was negatively related to GS levels, but we found evidence that 
other, ET-regulated factors may also be influential. Plant resistance to 
(consumption by) S. exigua was not related to insect growth because some plant 
chemistries inhibited growth while others inhibited feeding. These major 
signaling pathways modulate Arabidopsis GS accumulation and response to both 
phloem-feeding and chewing insects, often antagonistically; NPR appears to be 
central to these interactions. Our results indicate that exogenous signal 
application and plant consumption measures may not provide useful measures of 
plant responses to actual insect feeding.

Abstract

Plant responses to enemies are coordinated by several interacting signaling systems. Molecular and genetic studies with mutants and exogenous signal application suggest that jasmonate (JA)-, salicylate (SA)-, and ethylene (ET)-mediated pathways modulate expression of portions of the defense phenotype in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ), but have not yet linked these observations directly with plant responses to insect attack. We compared the glucosinolate (GS) profiles of rosette leaves of 4-week-old mutant and transgenic Arabidopsis (Columbia) plants compromised in these three major signaling pathways, and characterized responses by those plants to feeding by two phloem-feeding aphids (generalist Myzus persicae and specialist Brevicoryne brassicae ) and one generalist caterpillar species ( Spodoptera exigua Hubner). Blocked JA signaling in coronatine-insensitive ( coi1 ) and enhanced expression of SA-signaled disease resistance in hypersensitive response-like ( hrl1 ) mutants reduced constitutive GS concentrations, while blocking SA signaling at the mediator protein npr1 mutant (NPR) increased them. There was no significant impact on constitutive GS contents of blocking ET signaling (at ET resistant [ etr1 ]) or reducing SA concentrations ( nahG transgene). We found increased GS accumulation in response to insect feeding, which required functional NPR1 and ETR1 but not COI1 or SA. Insect feeding caused increases primarily in short-chain aliphatic methylsulfinyl GS. By contrast, responses to exogenous JA, a frequent experimental surrogate for insect attack, were characterized by an increase in indolyl GS. Insect performance, measured as population increase or weight increase, was negatively related to GS levels, but we found evidence that other, ET-regulated factors may also be influential. Plant resistance to (consumption by) S. exigua was not related to insect growth because some plant chemistries inhibited growth while others inhibited feeding. These major signaling pathways modulate Arabidopsis GS accumulation and response to both phloem-feeding and chewing insects, often antagonistically; NPR appears to be central to these interactions. Our results indicate that exogenous signal application and plant consumption measures may not provide useful measures of plant responses to actual insect feeding.

DISCUSSION

In Arabidopsis, the signaling molecules SA, JA, and ET interact in complex ways to influence plant resistance to herbivores and pathogens ( Pieterse et al., 2001 ; Glazebrook et al., 2003 ). Plant genotypes affected in their response by any of these signal molecules may become more suitable or resistant to insect herbivory, depending on the herbivore and experimental details ( Cui et al., 2002 ; Stotz et al., 2002 ). Here, we have shown that modifications of signaling pathways in Arabidopsis ecotype Col lead to changes in constitutive GS levels, GS induction by insect feeding, and suitability for representatives of two major classes of insect herbivores.
