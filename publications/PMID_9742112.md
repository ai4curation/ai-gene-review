Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by genomic 
instability, cancer susceptibility, and cellular hypersensitivity to 
DNA-cross-linking agents. Eight complementation groups of FA (FA-A through FA-H) 
have been identified. Two FA genes, corresponding to complementation groups FA-A 
and FA-C, have been cloned, but the functions of the encoded FAA and FAC 
proteins remain unknown. We have recently demonstrated that FAA and FAC interact 
to form a nuclear complex. In this study, we have analyzed a series of mutant 
forms of the FAA protein with respect to functional activity, FAC binding, and 
nuclear localization. Mutation or deletion of the amino-terminal nuclear 
localization signal (NLS) of FAA results in loss of functional activity, loss of 
FAC binding, and cytoplasmic retention of FAA. Replacement of the NLS sequence 
with a heterologous NLS sequence, derived from the simian virus 40 T antigen, 
results in nuclear localization but does not rescue functional activity or FAC 
binding. Nuclear localization of the FAA protein is therefore necessary but not 
sufficient for FAA function. Mutant forms of FAA which fail to bind to FAC also 
fail to promote the nuclear accumulation of FAC. In addition, wild-type FAC 
promotes the accumulation of wild-type FAA in the nucleus. Our results suggest 
that FAA and FAC perform a concerted function in the cell nucleus, required for 
the maintenance of chromosomal stability.
