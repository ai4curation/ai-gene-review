A family of genes including ETR1, ETR2, EIN4, ERS1, and ERS2 is implicated in 
ethylene perception in Arabidopsis thaliana. As only dominant mutations were 
previously available for these genes, it was unclear whether all of them are 
components in the ethylene signaling pathway and whether they code for positive 
or negative regulators of ethylene responses. In this study, we have isolated 
loss-of-function mutations of four of these genes (ETR1, ETR2, EIN4, and ERS2) 
and identified an ethylene-independent role of ETR1 in promoting cell 
elongation. Quadruple mutants had constitutive ethylene responses, revealing 
that these proteins negatively regulate ethylene responses and that the 
induction of ethylene response in Arabidopsis is through inactivation rather 
than activation of these proteins.
