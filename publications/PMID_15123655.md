GADD45a is a transcription target of the breast tumor suppressor gene BRCA. It 
was recently shown that mouse embryonic fibroblast cells carrying a targeted 
deletion of exon 11 of Brca1 (Brca1(Delta11/Delta11)) or a Gadd45A-null mutation 
(Gadd45a(-/-)) suffer centrosome amplification. To study genetic interactions 
between these genes during centrosome duplication, we generated 
Brca1(Delta11/Delta)(11)Gadd45a(-/-) mice by crossing each mutant. We found that 
all Brca1(Delta11/Delta11)Gadd45a(-/-) embryos at embryonic days 9.5-10.5 were 
exencephalic and exhibited a high incidence of apoptosis accompanied by altered 
levels of BAX, BCL-2, and p53. The trigger for these events is likely the 
genetic instability arising from centrosome amplification that is associated, at 
least in part, with decreased expression of the NIMA-related kinase NEK2. We 
demonstrate that small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of Brca1 decreased 
Nek2 more dramatically in Gadd45a(-/-) cells than in wild-type cells and, 
conversely, that overexpression of Brca1 and/or Gadd45a up-regulated 
transcription of Nek2. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of Nek2 in 
Brca1-specific small interfering RNA-treated wild-type and Gadd45a(-/-) cells 
repressed abnormal centrosome amplification. These observations suggest that 
NEK2 plays a role in mediating the actions of BRCA1 and GADD45a in regulating 
centrosome duplication and in maintaining genetic stability.
