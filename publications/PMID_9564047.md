The DBP5 gene encodes a putative RNA helicase of unknown function in the yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is shown here that Dbp5p is an ATP-dependent RNA 
helicase required for polyadenylated [poly(A)+] RNA export. Surprisingly, Dbp5p 
is present predominantly, if not exclusively, in the cytoplasm, and is highly 
enriched around the nuclear envelope. This observation raises the possibility 
that Dbp5p may play a role in unloading or remodeling messenger RNA particles 
(mRNPs) upon arrival in the cytoplasm and in coupling mRNP export and 
translation. The functions of Dbp5p are likely to be conserved, since its 
potential homologues can be found in a variety of eukaryotic cells.
