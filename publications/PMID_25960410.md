Chromatin-binding proteins play vital roles in the assembly and recruitment of 
multi-subunit complexes harboring effector proteins to specific genomic loci. 
MRG15, a chromodomain-containing chromatin-binding protein, recruits diverse 
chromatin-associated complexes that regulate gene transcription, DNA repair, and 
RNA splicing. Previous studies with Pf1, another chromatin-binding subunit of 
the Sin3S/Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex, defined the sequence and structural 
requirements for interactions with the MRG15 MRG domain, a common target of 
diverse subunits in the aforementioned complexes. We now show that MRGBP, a 
member of the Tip60/NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, engages the same two 
surfaces of the MRG domain as Pf1. High-affinity interactions occur via a 
bipartite structural motif including an FxLP sequence motif. MRGBP shares little 
sequence and structural similarity with Pf1, yet targets similar pockets on the 
surface of the MRG domain, mimicking Pf1 in its interactions. Our studies shed 
light onto how MRG domains have evolved to bind diverse targets.
