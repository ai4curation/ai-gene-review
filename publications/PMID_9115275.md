The death domain of the type 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) mediates 
interactions with several proteins involved in signaling the downstream effects 
of TNF. We have used the yeast interaction trap to isolate a protein, MADD, that 
associates with the death domain of TNFR1 through its own C-terminal death 
domain. MADD interacts with TNFR1 residues that are critical for signal 
generation and coimmunoprecipitates with TNFR1, implicating MADD as a component 
of the TNFR1 signaling complex. Importantly, we have found that overexpression 
of MADD activates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and expression of the MADD death domain 
stimulates both the ERK and c-JUN N-terminal kinase MAP kinases and induces the 
phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2. These data indicate that MADD 
links TNFR1 with MAP kinase activation and arachidonic acid release and provide 
further insight into the mechanisms by which TNF exerts its pleiotropic effects.
