The polyubiquitin receptor Rpn10 targets ubiquitylated Sic1 to the 26S 
proteasome for degradation. In contrast, turnover of at least one 
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) substrate, CPY*, is impervious to deletion of 
RPN10. To distinguish whether RPN10 is involved in the turnover of only a small 
set of cell cycle regulators that includes Sic1 or plays a more general role in 
the UPS, we sought to develop a general method that would allow us to survey the 
spectrum of ubiquitylated proteins that selectively accumulate in rpn10Delta 
cells. Polyubiquitin conjugates from yeast cells that express 
hexahistidine-tagged ubiquitin (H6-ubiquitin) were first enriched on a 
polyubiquitin binding protein affinity resin. This material was then denatured 
and subjected to IMAC to retrieve H6-ubiquitin and proteins to which it may be 
covalently linked. Using this approach, we identified 127 proteins that are 
candidate substrates for the 26S proteasome. We then sequenced ubiquitin 
conjugates from cells lacking Rpn10 (rpn10Delta) and identified 54 proteins that 
were uniquely recovered from rpn10Delta cells. These include two known targets 
of the UPS, the cell cycle regulator Sic1 and the transcriptional activator 
Gcn4. Our approach of comparing the ubiquitin conjugate proteome in wild-type 
and mutant cells has the resolving power to identify even an extremely in 
abundant transcriptional regulatory protein and should be generally applicable 
to mapping enzyme substrate networks in the UPS.
