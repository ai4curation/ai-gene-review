The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a key regulator of cellular functions 
including responses to numerous stress signals, and triggers apoptosis in many 
cell types, including neurons. The major mechanisms known to regulate p53 
stabilization and activation include phosphorylation and ubiquitin 
ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a 
proline-directed serine/threonine kinase, is most active in the central nervous 
system and plays a variety of roles in neuronal degeneration. Here, we 
demonstrate for the first time that Cdk5 interacts with p53 and increases its 
stability through posttranslational regulation, leading to accumulation of p53, 
particularly in the nucleus. We show that Cdk5 phosphorylates p53 on Ser15, 
Ser33 and Ser46 in vitro, and that increased Cdk5 activity in the nucleus 
mediates these phosphorylation events in response to genotoxic and oxidative 
stresses. Cdk5 mediates disruption of the interaction between p53 and Hdm2 (also 
known as Mdm2), and prevents Hdm2-induced p53 ubiquitylation and downregulation. 
Cdk5 additionally enhances phosphorylation-dependent binding of the p300 
coactivator, inducing acetylation of p53. Cdk5-stabilized p53 protein is 
transcriptionally active, resulting in the induction of pro-apoptotic genes and 
subsequent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in response to genotoxic or oxidative 
stress. Collectively, these novel findings help define the mechanisms underlying 
neuronal apoptosis occurring as a result of Cdk5-mediated p53 stabilization and 
transcriptional activation.

Abstract

CDK5 kinase plays a central role in the regulation of
neuronal
functions, and its hyperactivation has been associated with neurodegenerative
pathologies and more recently with several human cancers, in particular
lung cancer. However, ATP-competitive inhibitors targeting CDK5 are
poorly selective and suffer limitations, calling for new classes of
inhibitors. In a screen for allosteric modulators of CDK5, we identified
ethaverine and closely related derivative papaverine and showed that
they inhibit cell proliferation and migration of non small cell lung
cancer cell lines. Moreover the efficacy of these compounds is significantly
enhanced when combined with the ATP-competitive inhibitor roscovitine,
suggesting an additive dual mechanism of inhibition targeting CDK5.
These compounds do not affect CDK5 stability, but thermodenaturation
studies performed with A549 cell extracts infer that they interact
with CDK5 in cellulo . Furthermore, the inhibitory
potentials of ethaverine and papaverine are reduced in A549 cells
treated with siRNA directed against CDK5. Taken together, our results
provide unexpected and novel evidence that ethaverine and papaverine
constitute promising leads that can be repurposed for targeting CDK5
in lung cancer.

Discussion

Lung cancers and, in particular, NSCLC currently
suffer from a
lack of efficient targeted therapies. CDK5 hyperactivity has been
reported in human lung cancers and constitutes an attractive therapeutic
target. 11 , 12 Although a wide variety of CDK5 inhibitors
are available, including compounds targeting the ATP pocket such as
roscovitine, purvalanol, dinaciclib, and AT7519 and peptides targeting
the CDK5/p25 interface, 9 the former lack
selectivity, resulting in a variety of undesirable secondary effects,
and the latter are characterized by penetration and bioavailability
issues that limit their development for clinical use.

In this
study, we report on the identification of ethaverine and
its closely related derivative papaverine, which we have identified
as allosteric modulators of CDK5 using a conformational CDK5 biosensor. 14 Since ethaverine and papaverine are well-established
PDE inhibitors, 15 , 16 it was quite surprising to identify
these compounds repositioned as CDK5 binders and modulators of its
conformation. Our in vitro assays with CDKCONF5/CDKCONF2 indicate
that these compounds indeed bind selectively to CDK5, and our CETSA
studies suggest that ethaverine and papaverine interact physically
with CDK5 in A549 cells since its thermodenaturation profile was affected
following treatment with these inhibitors.

We demonstrate that
ethaverine and papaverine target CDK5 function
in cell proliferation and migration, thereby offering alternatives
to conventional ATP-competitive inhibitors. We have shown that these
compounds inhibit proliferation of the A549 lung cancer cell line
with moderate efficiency, comparable to that of roscovitine. However,
we have also found that their combination with the ATP-competitive
inhibitor roscovitine leads to essentially complete inhibition of
proliferation, suggesting that ethaverine/papaverine and roscovitine
may simultaneously target CDK5 through different binding pockets or
alternatively target different populations of CDK5. In fact, the differences
observed between roscovitine, ethaverine, and papaverine throughout
this study, whether in proliferation assays, following sequential
treatments, in different cell lines, or in time-lapse imaging studies
of cell division and migration, point to different mechanisms of action
between these newly identified allosteric modulators of CDK5 and roscovitine.
Last but not least, our finding that ethaverine and papaverine are
more robust inhibitors than roscovitine in cells that do not express
wild-type p53 underscores their therapeutic attractivity in cancers
that lack p53 or express mutant forms such as R248Q.

We have
previously shown that combination strategies using kinase
inhibitors that target CDKs through different mechanisms of action
constitute promising therapeutic strategies enabling to achieve complete
inhibition. 32 In this study, we demonstrate
that the combination of ethaverine or papaverine with the ATP-competitive
inhibitor roscovitine induces an additive and efficient inhibition
of NSCLC cell proliferation. Hence, the combination of these different
compounds is an attractive strategy for anticancer therapeutics that
offers several advantages a single drug cannot achieve. ATP-competitive
kinase inhibitors are notorious for their promiscuity as well as their
ability to induce resistance, essentially associated with mutations
in the ATP-binding pocket or compensation mechanisms. 33 , 34 In contrast, allosteric modulators are believed to achieve greater
selectivity by targeting pockets and interfaces which are not conserved
in different kinases and little if any resistance. 35 − 38

Conclusions

This study provides insight into drug repositioning
and repurposing
of ethaverine and papaverine and highlights a promising and attractive
targeting strategy through a combination of these newly identified
allosteric modulators of CDK5 and ATP-competitive inhibitors of CDK5.
Our strategy emphasizes the originality and relevance of a conformational
biosensor to identify allosteric modulators of kinase function, providing
a means to screen for “old drugs” which may be repurposed
for cancer therapeutics. It also reveals that combinatorial treatment
with allosteric drugs and ATP-competitive inhibitors can enhance inhibition
of the same target, thereby reducing the overall concentration of
drugs required for treatment and potentially preventing emergence
of resistance. The efficient inhibition of lung cancer cell proliferation
and migration by ethaverine/papaverine and roscovitine suggests that
CDK5 targeting could involve either two distinct binding sites or
two conformationally distinct populations of CDK5. The combination
of compounds targeting the same kinase with different mechanisms of
action can be expected to tamper with distinct functions or signaling
processes simultaneously and therefore constitutes an efficient therapeutic
strategy. Moreover a combination of FDA-approved inhibitors targeting
other kinases currently used in NSCLC such as erlotinib, gefinitib,
or crizotinib or CDK4/6 inhibitors abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib
might potentially also be combined with ethaverine or papaverine.
