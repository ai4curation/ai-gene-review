The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a key regulator of cellular functions 
including responses to numerous stress signals, and triggers apoptosis in many 
cell types, including neurons. The major mechanisms known to regulate p53 
stabilization and activation include phosphorylation and ubiquitin 
ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a 
proline-directed serine/threonine kinase, is most active in the central nervous 
system and plays a variety of roles in neuronal degeneration. Here, we 
demonstrate for the first time that Cdk5 interacts with p53 and increases its 
stability through posttranslational regulation, leading to accumulation of p53, 
particularly in the nucleus. We show that Cdk5 phosphorylates p53 on Ser15, 
Ser33 and Ser46 in vitro, and that increased Cdk5 activity in the nucleus 
mediates these phosphorylation events in response to genotoxic and oxidative 
stresses. Cdk5 mediates disruption of the interaction between p53 and Hdm2 (also 
known as Mdm2), and prevents Hdm2-induced p53 ubiquitylation and downregulation. 
Cdk5 additionally enhances phosphorylation-dependent binding of the p300 
coactivator, inducing acetylation of p53. Cdk5-stabilized p53 protein is 
transcriptionally active, resulting in the induction of pro-apoptotic genes and 
subsequent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in response to genotoxic or oxidative 
stress. Collectively, these novel findings help define the mechanisms underlying 
neuronal apoptosis occurring as a result of Cdk5-mediated p53 stabilization and 
transcriptional activation.

## Full Text

CDK5 kinase plays a central role in the regulation of
neuronal
functions, and its hyperactivation has been associated with neurodegenerative
pathologies and more recently with several human cancers, in particular
lung cancer. However, ATP-competitive inhibitors targeting CDK5 are
poorly selective and suffer limitations, calling for new classes of
inhibitors. In a screen for allosteric modulators of CDK5, we identified
ethaverine and closely related derivative papaverine and showed that
they inhibit cell proliferation and migration of non small cell lung
cancer cell lines. Moreover the efficacy of these compounds is significantly
enhanced when combined with the ATP-competitive inhibitor roscovitine,
suggesting an additive dual mechanism of inhibition targeting CDK5.
These compounds do not affect CDK5 stability, but thermodenaturation
studies performed with A549 cell extracts infer that they interact
with CDK5 in cellulo. Furthermore, the inhibitory
potentials of ethaverine and papaverine are reduced in A549 cells
treated with siRNA directed against CDK5. Taken together, our results
provide unexpected and novel evidence that ethaverine and papaverine
constitute promising leads that can be repurposed for targeting CDK5
in lung cancer.
