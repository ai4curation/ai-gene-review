Inner ear hair cells detect sound vibration through the deflection of 
mechanosensory stereocilia. Cytoplasmic protein TPRN has been shown to localize 
at the taper region of the stereocilia, and mutations in TPRN cause hereditary 
hearing loss through an unknown mechanism. Here, using biochemistry and dual 
stimulated emission depletion microscopy imaging, we show that the TPRN, 
together with its binding proteins CLIC5 and PTPRQ, forms concentric rings in 
the taper region of stereocilia. The disruption of TPRN rings, triggered by the 
competitive inhibition of the interaction of TPRN and CLIC5 or exogenous TPRN 
overexpression, leads to stereocilia degeneration and severe hearing loss. Most 
importantly, restoration of the TPRN rings can rescue the damaged auditory 
function of Tprn knockout mice by exogenously expressing TPRN at an appropriate 
level in HCs via promoter recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV). In summary, 
our results reveal highly structured TPRN rings near the taper region of 
stereocilia that are crucial for stereocilia function and hearing. Also, TPRN 
ring restoration in stereocilia by AAV-Tprn effectively repairs damaged hearing, 
which lays the foundation for the clinical application of AAV-mediated gene 
therapy in patients with TPRN mutation.
