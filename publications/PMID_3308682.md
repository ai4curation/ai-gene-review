We have identified deficient biopterin synthesis in four probands and one sib 
with persistent postnatal hyperphenylalaninemia. The metabolic findings were 
associated with a benign clinical presentation and normal biopterin level in 
cerebrospinal fluid in the newborn period, indicating the peripheral (hepatic) 
form of this autosomal recessive phenotype. Impaired development was apparent at 
3 months in one proband not treated early. Treatment with oral tetrahydropterin 
restored adequate phenylalanine hydroxylase activity; it also maintained or 
improved CNS function. The deficient enzyme in these subjects is 6-pyruvoyl 
tetrahydropterin synthase (PTS). Erythrocyte activity of PTS in homozygotes (or 
compound heterozygotes) is less than 10% of normal. Heterozygotes have 20%-50% 
of normal PTS activity (enzyme phenotype), a finding compatible with a range of 
gene dosage effects, some abnormal. The metabolic phenotype in heterozygotes 
(urine biopterin excretion) did not correlate with erythrocyte PTS activity. The 
complex relationship between erythrocyte PTS activity, and biopterin synthesis 
in these families indicates genetic heterogeneity at the PTS locus.
