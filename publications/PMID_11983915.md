To determine the influence of Bcl-2 on the developmental biology of myocytes, we 
analyzed the population dynamics of this cell type in the heart of transgenic 
(TG) mice overexpressing Bcl-2 under the control of the alpha-myosin heavy chain 
promoter. TG mice and non-TG (wild type, WT) mice were studied at 24 days, 2 
months, and 4 months after birth. Bcl-2 overexpression produced a significant 
increase in the percentage of cycling myocytes and their mitotic index. These 
effects were strictly connected to the expression of the transgene, as 
demonstrated in isolated myocytes. The formation of mitotic spindle and 
contractile ring was identified in replicating cells. These typical aspects of 
mitosis were complemented with the demonstration of karyokinesis and cytokinesis 
to provide structural evidence of cell division. Apoptosis was low at all ages 
and was not affected by Bcl-2. The higher cell replication rate in TG was 
conditioned by a decrease in the expression of the cell-cycle inhibitors, 
p21(WAF1) and p16(INK4a), and by an increase in Mdm2-p53 complexes. In 
comparison with WT, TG had 0.4 x 10(6), 0.74 x 10(6), and 1.2 x 10(6) more 
myocytes in the left ventricle at 24 days, 2 months, and 4 months, respectively. 
Binucleated myocytes were 12% and 25% larger in WT than in TG mice at 2 and 4 
months of age. Taken together, these observations reveal a previously 
uncharacterized replication-enhancing function of Bcl-2 in myocytes in vivo in 
the absence of stressful conditions.
