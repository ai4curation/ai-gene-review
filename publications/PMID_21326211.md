Ribosome biogenesis is a tightly controlled pathway that requires an intricate 
spatial and temporal interplay of protein networks. Most structural rRNA 
components are generated in the nucleolus and assembled into pre-ribosomal 
particles, which are transferred for further maturation to the nucleoplasm and 
cytoplasm. In metazoa, few regulatory components for these processes have been 
characterized. Previous work revealed a critical role for the SUMO-specific 
protease SENP3 in the nucleolar steps of ribosome biogenesis. We biochemically 
purified a SENP3-associated complex comprising PELP1, TEX10 and WDR18, and 
demonstrate that this complex is involved in maturation and nucleolar release of 
the large ribosomal subunit. We identified PELP1 and the PELP1-associated factor 
LAS1L as SENP3-sensitive targets of SUMO, and provide evidence that balanced 
SUMO conjugation/deconjugation determines the nucleolar partitioning of this 
complex. This defines the PELP1-TEX10-WDR18 complex as a regulator of ribosome 
biogenesis and suggests that its SUMO-controlled distribution coordinates the 
rate of ribosome formation. These findings contribute to the basic understanding 
of mammalian ribosome biogenesis and shed new light on the role of SUMO in this 
process.
