We report that four putative germline RNA helicases, GLHs, are components of the 
germline-specific P granules in Caenorhabditis elegans. GLH-3 and GLH-4, newly 
discovered, belong to a multi-gene glh family. Although GLHs are homologous to 
Drosophila VASA, a polar granule component necessary for oogenesis and embryonic 
pattern formation, the GLHs are distinguished by containing multiple CCHC zinc 
fingers. RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) reveals the GLHs are critical for 
oogenesis. By RNAi at 20 degrees C, when either loss of GLH-1 or GLH-4 alone has 
no effect, loss of both GLH-1 and GLH-4 results in 97% sterility in the 
glh-1/4(RNAi) offspring of injected hermaphrodites. glh-1/4(RNAi) germlines are 
under-proliferated and are without oocytes. glh-1/4(RNAi) animals produce sperm; 
however, spermatogenesis is delayed and the sperm are defective. P granules are 
still present in glh-1/4(RNAi) sterile worms as revealed with antibodies against 
the remaining GLH-2 and GLH-3 proteins, indicating the GLHs function 
independently in P granule assembly. These studies reveal that C.elegans can use 
GLH-1 or GLH-4 to promote germline development.
