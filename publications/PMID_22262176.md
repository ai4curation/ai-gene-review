Ribosome biogenesis is the most demanding energetic process in proliferating 
cells and it is emerging as a critical sensor of cellular homeostasis. Upon 
disturbance of ribosome biogenesis, specific free ribosomal proteins, most 
notably L11, bind and inhibit Mdm2, resulting in activation of the tumor 
suppressor p53. This pathway has been characterized in somatic and cancer cells, 
but its function in embryonic pluripotent cells has remained unexplored. Here, 
we show that treatment with low doses of Actinomycin D or depletion of ribosomal 
protein L37, two well-established inducers of ribosomal stress, activate p53 in 
an L11-dependent manner in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and in induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Activation of p53 results in transcriptional 
induction of p53 targets, including p21, Mdm2, Pidd, Puma, Noxa and Bax. 
Finally, ribosomal stress elicits L11- and p53-dependent apoptosis in 
ESCs/iPSCs. These results extend to pluripotent cells the functionality of the 
ribosomal stress pathway and we speculate that this could be a relevant cellular 
checkpoint during early embryogenesis.
