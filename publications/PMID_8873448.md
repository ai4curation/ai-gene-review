We report the analysis of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae cyclophilins, Cpr6 and 
Cpr7, identified by their ability to interact in vivo with the transcriptional 
regulator Rpd3. Both cyclophilins have an extended carboxy-terminal region 
containing a three-unit tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif and share 
significant amino acid identity with the mammalian cyclophilin CyP-40. Neither 
CPR6 nor CPR7 is essential but deletion of CPR7 results in a significant 
impairment of the rate of cell division. This is the first demonstration that a 
member of the cyclophilin family is required for normal cell growth.
