Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are known as the most 
frequent cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD), but are also present in 
sporadic cases. The G2019S-LRRK2 mutation is located in the kinase domain of the 
protein, and has consistently been reported to promote a gain of kinase 
function. Several proteins have been reported as LRRK2 substrates and/or 
interactors, suggesting possible pathways involved in neurodegeneration in PD. 
Hyperphosphorylated Tau protein accumulates in neurofibrillary tangles, a 
typical pathological hallmark in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal 
dementia. In addition, it is also frequently found in the brains of PD patients. 
Although LRRK2 is a kinase, it appears that a putative interaction with Tau is 
phosphorylation-independent. However, the underlying mechanisms and the cellular 
consequences of this interaction are still unclear. In this study, we 
demonstrate an interaction between LRRK2 and Tau and that LRRK2 promotes the 
accumulation of non-monomeric and high-molecular weight (HMW) Tau species 
independent of its kinase activity. Interestingly, we found that LRRK2 increases 
Tau secretion, possibly as a consequence of an impairment of Tau proteasomal 
degradation. Our data highlight a mechanism through which LRRK2 regulates 
intracellular Tau levels, contributing to the progression of the pathology 
caused by the LRRK2-mediated proteasome impairment. In total, our findings 
suggest that the interplay between LRRK2 and proteasome activity might 
constitute a valid target for therapeutic intervention in PD.
