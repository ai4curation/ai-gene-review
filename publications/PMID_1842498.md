A novel cDNA clone termed R2 was isolated by subtractive hybridization of a cDNA 
library of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)/phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated Jurkat 
cells and by rescreening a cDNA library of PHA-stimulated peripheral blood 
lymphocytes. It hybridizes to a single mRNA species of about 2.2 kb, which is 
inducible in lymphoid cells and codes for a protein of 267 amino acids which 
contains four potential transmembrane domains. A computer-aided comparison 
showed strong homology to four other membrane proteins, the pan B cell marker 
CD37, the pan leukocyte marker CD53, the melanoma antigen ME491 and, 
surprisingly, the Schistosoma mansoni antigen Sm23. The four human proteins 
share a number of additional similarities in their overall structure. These 
include identical spacing of the transmembrane domains, similar hydrophobicity 
plots, possible N-linked glycosylation sites of similar number and position as 
well as similar distribution of the cysteine residues. The majority of these 
characteristics are still conserved in the evolutionary most distant member of 
this family, the Schistosoma mansoni antigen Sm23. Here we introduce this new 
protein superfamily and characterize the inducible, lymphoid-specific member R2.
