The conserved TOR (target of rapamycin) kinase is part of a TORC1 complex that 
regulates cellular responses to environmental stress, such as amino acid 
starvation and hypoxia. Dysregulation of Akt-TOR signaling has also been linked 
to the genesis of cancer, and thus, this pathway presents potential targets for 
cancer chemotherapeutics. Here we report that rapamycin-sensitive TORC1 
signaling is required for the S-phase progression and viability of yeast cells 
in response to genotoxic stress. In the presence of the DNA-damaging agent 
methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), TOR-dependent cell survival required a functional 
S-phase checkpoint. Rapamycin inhibition of TORC1 signaling suppressed the Rad53 
checkpoint-mediated induction of ribonucleotide reductase subunits Rnr1 and 
Rnr3, thereby abrogating MMS-induced mutagenesis and enhancing cell lethality. 
Moreover, cells deleted for RNR3 were hypersensitive to rapamycin plus MMS, 
providing the first demonstration that Rnr3 contributes to the survival of cells 
exposed to DNA damage. Our findings support a model whereby TORC1 acts as a 
survival pathway in response to genotoxic stress by maintaining the 
deoxynucleoside triphosphate pools necessary for error-prone translesion DNA 
polymerases. Thus, TOR-dependent cell survival in response to DNA-damaging 
agents coincides with increased mutation rates, which may contribute to the 
acquisition of chemotherapeutic drug resistance.
