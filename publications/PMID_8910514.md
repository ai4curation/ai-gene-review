CD40 signalings play crucial roles in B-cell function. To identify molecules 
which transduce CD40 signalings, we have utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to 
clone cDNAs encoding proteins that bind the cytoplasmic tail of CD40. A cDNA 
encoding a putative signal transducer, designated TRAF6, has been molecularly 
cloned. TRAF6 has a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 
(TRAF) domain in its carboxyl terminus and has a RING finger domain, a cluster 
of zinc fingers and a coiled-coil domain, which are also present in other TRAF 
family proteins. TRAF6 does not associate with the cytoplasmic tails of TNFR2, 
CD30, lymphotoxin-beta receptor, and LMP1 of Epstein-Barr virus. Deletion 
analysis showed that residues 246-269 of CD40 which are required for its 
association with TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5 are dispensable for its interaction 
with TRAF6, whereas residues 230-245 were required. Overexpression of TRAF6 
activates transcription factor NFkappaB, and its TRAF-C domain suppresses 
NFkappaB activation triggered by CD40 lacking residues 246-277. These results 
suggest that TRAF6 could mediate the CD40 signal that is transduced by the 
amino-terminal domain (230-245) of the CD40 cytoplasmic region and appears to be 
independent of other known TRAF family proteins.
