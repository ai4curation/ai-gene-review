The cDNAs of two new human membrane-associated aspartic proteases, memapsin 1 
and memapsin 2, have been cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences 
show that each contains the typical pre, pro, and aspartic protease regions, but 
each also has a C-terminal extension of over 80 residues, which includes a 
single transmembrane domain and a C-terminal cytosolic domain. Memapsin 2 mRNA 
is abundant in human brain. The protease domain of memapsin 2 cDNA was expressed 
in Escherichia coli and was purified. Recombinant memapsin 2 specifically 
hydrolyzed peptides derived from the beta-secretase site of both the wild-type 
and Swedish mutant beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) with over 60-fold 
increase of catalytic efficiency for the latter. Expression of APP and memapsin 
2 in HeLa cells showed that memapsin 2 cleaved the beta-secretase site of APP 
intracellularly. These and other results suggest that memapsin 2 fits all of the 
criteria of beta-secretase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the in 
vivo production of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide leading to the progression 
of Alzheimer's disease. Recombinant memapsin 2 also cleaved a peptide derived 
from the processing site of presenilin 1, albeit with poor kinetic efficiency. 
Alignment of cleavage site sequences of peptides indicates that the specificity 
of memapsin 2 resides mainly at the S(1)' subsite, which prefers small side 
chains such as Ala, Ser, and Asp.
