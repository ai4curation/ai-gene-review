Actomyosin contractility regulates various cell biological processes including 
cytokinesis, adhesion and migration. While in lower eukaryotes, alpha-kinases 
control actomyosin relaxation, a similar role for mammalian alpha-kinases has 
yet to be established. Here, we examined whether TRPM7, a cation channel fused 
to an alpha-kinase, can affect actomyosin function. We demonstrate that 
activation of TRPM7 by bradykinin leads to a Ca(2+)- and kinase-dependent 
interaction with the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Moreover, TRPM7 phosphorylates the 
myosin IIA heavy chain. Accordingly, low overexpression of TRPM7 increases 
intracellular Ca2+ levels accompanied by cell spreading, adhesion and the 
formation of focal adhesions. Activation of TRPM7 induces the transformation of 
these focal adhesions into podosomes by a kinase-dependent mechanism, an effect 
that can be mimicked by pharmacological inhibition of myosin II. Collectively, 
our results demonstrate that regulation of cell adhesion by TRPM7 is the 
combined effect of kinase-dependent and -independent pathways on actomyosin 
contractility.
