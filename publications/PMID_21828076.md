The PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) phosphatase is unique in mammals in 
terms of its tumor suppressor activity, exerted by dephosphorylation of the 
lipid second messenger PIP(3) (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate), which 
activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) 
oncogenic pathway. Loss-of-function mutations in the PTEN gene are frequent in 
human cancer and in the germline of patients with PTEN hamartoma tumor-related 
syndromes (PHTSs). In addition, PTEN is mutated in patients with autism spectrum 
disorders (ASDs), although no functional information on these mutations is 
available. Here, we report a comprehensive in vivo functional analysis of human 
PTEN using a heterologous yeast reconstitution system. Ala-scanning mutagenesis 
at the catalytic loops of PTEN outlined the critical role of residues within the 
P-catalytic loop for PIP(3) phosphatase activity in vivo. PTEN mutations that 
mimic the P-catalytic loop of mammalian PTEN-like proteins (TPTE, TPIP, tensins 
and auxilins) affected PTEN function variably, whereas tumor- or PHTS-associated 
mutations targeting the PTEN P-loop produced complete loss of function. 
Conversely, Ala-substitutions, as well as tumor-related mutations at the WPD- 
and TI-catalytic loops, displayed partial activity in many cases. Interestingly, 
a tumor-related D92N mutation was partially active, supporting the notion that 
the PTEN Asp92 residue might not function as the catalytic general acid. The 
analysis of a panel of ASD-associated hereditary PTEN mutations revealed that 
most of them did not substantially abrogate PTEN activity in vivo, whereas most 
of PHTS-associated mutations did. Our findings reveal distinctive functional 
patterns among PTEN mutations found in tumors and in the germline of PHTS and 
ASD patients, which could be relevant for therapy.
