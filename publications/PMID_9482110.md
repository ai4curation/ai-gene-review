Infection by HTLV-1 has been correlated with the appearance of various 
proliferative or degenerative diseases. Some of these disorders have been 
observed in transgenic mice expressing the Tax protein, which is known to 
transactivate various viral and cellular promoters through interactions with 
several transcription factors. In this study we show that the C-terminus of this 
viral oncoprotein represents a motif permitting binding of Tax to the PDZ 
domains of several cellular proteins. A two-hybrid screen with Tax as bait 
indeed yielded complementary DNAs coding for six proteins including PDZ domains. 
Two of them correspond to truncated forms of the PSD-95 and beta1-syntrophin 
proteins, another clone codes for a protein homologous to the product of the C. 
elegans gene lin-7. The other three clones code for new human members of the PDZ 
family of cellular proteins. The interaction of Tax with the products of these 
clones was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays in mammalian cells, and 
analysis of various mutants of Tax established the importance of the C-terminal 
amino acids for several of these interactions. These data suggest that Tax could 
perturb the normal function of targeted cellular proteins by strongly 
interacting with their PDZ domains.
