Huntington's disease is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin 
protein. Wild-type huntingtin, by contrast, appears to protect cells from 
pro-apoptotic insults. Here we describe a novel anti-apoptotic function for 
huntingtin. When cells are exposed to Fas-related signals, the ubiquitously 
expressed p21-activated kinase 2 (Pak2) can be activated via cleavage by 
caspases to release a constitutively active C-terminal fragment, which mediates 
cell death. Our data show that huntingtin interacts with Pak2. Overexpression of 
huntingtin significantly inhibits caspase-3-mediated and caspase-8-mediated 
cleavage of Pak2 in cells. Moreover, huntingtin prevents Pak2 cleavage by 
caspase-3 and caspase-8 in vitro. Although huntingtin is cytoprotective in 
wild-type cells that are exposed to TNFalpha, it has no significant benefit in 
TNFalpha-treated cells with Pak2 knockdown. Thus, huntingtin exerts 
anti-apoptotic effects by binding to Pak2, which reduces the abilities of 
caspase-3 and caspase-8 to cleave Pak2 and convert it into a mediator of cell 
death.

Introduction

Huntingtin (Htt) is a large (348 kDa), ubiquitously expressed protein. An
 expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch close to its N-terminus causes
 Huntington's disease (HD), an autosomal-dominant, progressive,
 neurodegenerative disorder ( Trottier et
 al., 1995 ). Normal alleles have 37 or fewer glutamines in this
 polymorphic tract, and 38 or more of these residues cause disease
 ( Rubinsztein et al., 1996 ). In
 the disease range, longer polyQ stretches cause earlier symptom onset.

The exact mechanism(s) of cellular toxicity caused by mutant Htt are not
 completely understood, although many proteins have been identified as
 Htt-interacting partners and numerous different processes have been suggested.
 Although genetic and transgenic data argue that the primary toxicity caused by
 the mutation causing HD is via a gain-of-function mechanism, there have been
 suggestions that loss-of-function(s) resulting from the polyQ expansion might
 also contribute to toxicity ( Cattaneo et
 al., 2005 ). A number of studies have shown that wild-type Htt can
 protect against a range of proapoptotic insults
 ( Ho et al., 2001 ; Leavitt et al., 2001 ; Rigamonti et al., 2000 ; Rigamonti et al., 2001 ; Zhang et al., 2006 ). Htt is
 essential for embryonic development: its complete inactivation in mice causes
 embryonic death before day 8.5 (prior to gastrulation and the formation of the
 nervous system) ( Duyao et al.,
 1995 ; Nasir et al.,
 1995 ; Zeitlin et al.,
 1995 ).

The p21-activated kinases (Paks) are serine-threonine kinases that are
 activated by small GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rac. Six mammalian Paks
 (Pak1-Pak6) have been identified to date. Paks contain catalytic C-termini
 that are highly conserved. Mammalian Paks have been divided into two
 subfamilies according to their sequence similarity: Pak1-Pak3 and Pak4-Pak6
 ( Abo et al., 1998 ; Bagrodia et al., 1995 ; Cau et al., 2001 ; Dan et al., 2002 ; Jaffer and Chernoff, 2002 ; Manser et al., 1995 ; Manser et al., 1994 ; Pandey et al., 2002 ; Teo et al., 1995 ; Yang et al., 2001 ). In
 response to extracellular signalling, Paks are activated and regulate cell
 morphology and motility ( Bokoch,
 2003 ; Hofmann et al.,
 2004 ; Manser et al.,
 1997 ).

Paks also regulate cell survival and death in response to cellular stimuli.
 Full-length Pak1, Pak2, Pak4 and Pak5 have been reported to have
 anti-apoptotic roles ( Cotteret et al.,
 2003 ; Jakobi et al.,
 2001 ; Qu et al.,
 2003 ; Schurmann et al.,
 2000 ). In the first Pak subfamily, Pak1 and Pak3 are
 tissue-specific and highly expressed in the brain, but Pak2 is ubiquitously
 expressed ( Manser et al.,
 1995 ; Manser et al.,
 1994 ; Teo et al.,
 1995 ). Also, in contrast to Pak1 and Pak3, Pak2 can be activated
 via cleavage by caspase proteases to release a constitutively active
 C-terminal fragment (Pak2p34). Caspase-activated Pak2p34 has been observed
 after cells are exposed to death stimuli such as Fas ligand, TNFα, heat
 shock or UV radiation ( Chan et al.,
 1998 ; Rudel and Bokoch,
 1997 ; Tang et al.,
 1998 ). Studies have suggested that the formation of Pak2p34
 mediates cell death in response to these stimuli and that it is an essential
 mediator of cell death in response to Fas-related signals
 ( Rudel and Bokoch, 1997 ; Rudel et al., 1998 ).

Recently, we identified Pak1 as an Htt-binding protein
 ( Luo et al., 2008 ). Here, we
 investigated the ability of Htt to physically interact with Pak2 and thus
 prevent Pak2 cleavage. Our data show that overexpression of Htt significantly
 inhibits caspase-mediated cleavage of Pak2 in cells. Also, we show that Htt
 reduces caspase-3- and caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Pak2 in vitro. Although
 Htt is cytoprotective in wild-type cells exposed to TNFα (or insults
 causing caspase activation, such as leukaemia-inhibitory factor or serum
 withdrawal from embryonic stem cells), it has no significant benefit in cells
 with Pak2 knockdown that have been treated with TNFα. Interestingly, we
 found that mutant Htt partially inhibits cleavage of Pak2, although its effect
 was weaker than that of its wild-type counterpart. Thus, we conclude that Htt
 exerts cytoprotective effects by interfering with Pak2 cleavage.

Discussion

Htt, like Pak2, is a ubiquitously expressed protein
 ( Teo et al., 1995 ; Trottier et al., 1995 ).
 However, much of the research on the normal functions of Htt has been
 restricted to neuronal systems, even though many of its normal functions might
 be generic. We previously reported that Pak1 binding to Htt promotes Htt-Htt
 interaction, and thus enhances muHtt oligomerisation and toxicity
 ( Luo et al., 2008 ). Pak1, Pak2
 and Pak3 have highly conserved protein sequences and similar functions
 ( Bokoch, 2003 ). However, Pak2
 is cleaved and releases a toxic p34 species in response to cell-death signals
 ( Rudel and Bokoch, 1997 ). The
 widespread expression pattern of Pak2 prompted us to consider the possibility
 that Htt might modulate Pak2 cleavage.

After caspase-mediated cleavage, Pak2 releases a functionally unknown
 N-terminal fragment and a toxic C-terminal fragment. Thus, one can assay Pak2
 cleavage by analysing the levels of either the C-terminal or N-terminal
 fragments (or both, as we have done). Our data provide a novel mechanism for
 the general cytoprotective role of Htt in the context of Fas-mediated
 apoptosis. By binding to Pak2 and thus preventing its activation via cleavage,
 both wild-type Htt and muHtt abolish a pathway that is crucial for
 caspase-associated cell death. These data have been confirmed both in cell
 lines and in vitro, suggesting that this is a specific and direct property of
 the Htt-Pak2 interaction. Our data on Pak2 cleavage mediated by both caspase-3
 and caspase-8 in MCF-7 cells and in vitro show that these effects are
 independent of any effects of Htt on caspase-3 activity (although one could
 easily envisage additive effects of the capase-3 inhibition by Htt and our
 observed effects on Pak2 cleavage). Indeed, our data suggest that inhibition
 of Pak2 cleavage is a major component of the protective effect of Htt, at
 least in the context of Fas-related cell-death pathways, as Htt is
 cytoprotective in wild-type cells exposed to TNFα, but has no
 significant benefit in cells with Pak2 knockdown that are treated with
 TNFα.

The ability of both muHtt and wild-type Htt to inhibit Pak2 cleavage is
 compatible with data in the literature that suggest that muHtt retains many of
 the functions of its wild-type counterpart, although there might be some
 partial loss of certain activities. Indeed, our data suggest that muHtt binds
 more weakly to Pak2 than does wild-type Htt. This might account for the weaker
 protection against Pak2 cleavage afforded by muHtt than by wild-type Htt.
 However, it is interesting to note that the embryonic lethality associated
 with complete loss of Htt is rescued by YAC (yeast artificial chromosome)
 overexpression of either muHtt or wild-type Htt
 ( Hodgson et al., 1999 ). Thus,
 the anti-apoptotic effects of muHtt might be sufficient if they are relevant
 in this context. As muHtt is itself toxic owing to its gain-of-function
 properties ( Rubinsztein,
 2003 ), one cannot always make simple inferences regarding its
 potential anti-apoptotic properties in cell culture or in vivo, especially if
 one uses conditions that might activate pathways that potentiate muHtt
 toxicity. For example, although both muHtt and wild-type Htt are reported to
 inhibit caspase-3 activation ( Zhang et
 al., 2006 ), elevated caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities
 were observed in lymphoblasts from patients with heterozygous or homozygous
 mutant Htt alleles ( Maglione et
 al., 2006 ). In other words, if muHtt expression enhances the
 toxicity of a specific toxin, then this might be due to the gain-of-function
 toxicity of the mutant protein, which could be unrelated to, or might indeed
 dominate, its anti-apoptotic properties (in other contexts). Interestingly,
 Maglione et al. suggested that the increased caspase activities in
 lymphoblasts with muHtt might enhance Htt cleavage
 ( Maglione et al., 2006 ).
 Smaller Htt fragments lose the ability to protect against Pak2 cleavage.

In contrast to the effects of Pak1 on muHtt oligomerisation and toxicity,
 these new data provide a novel mechanism for the protective role of Htt by
 showing that it affects Pak2 cleavage. The current data, along with our
 previous data showing that Pak1 enhances muHtt toxicity, suggest that the
 effects of Pak-family members on muHtt toxicity might be either deleterious or
 protective, depending on the family member involved. It would also be
 interesting to investigate whether Htt is involved in other normal functions
 of Pak-family proteins.

The functional links between Htt and Pak2 might provide leads for further
 understanding of cell death and cell survival. Prevention of fragmentation of
 muHtt or wild-type Htt allows Htt to maintain its ability to inhibit Pak2
 cleavage, thus decreasing the toxicity resulting from Pak2p34 (the cleaved
 C-terminal fragment). By mimicking the relevant Pak2-binding domain structures
 of Htt, one might also be able to design (or screen for) small molecules that
 inhibit caspase-mediated cleavage of Pak2 artificially in order to control
 cell survival.
