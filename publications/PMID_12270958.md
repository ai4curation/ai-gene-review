The heparan sulfate proteoglycan agrin is responsible for the formation, 
maintenance, and regeneration of the neuromuscular junction. In the central 
nervous system, agrin is widely expressed and concentrated at interneuronal 
synapses, but its function during synaptogenesis remains controversial. Instead, 
evidence for additional functions of agrin during axonal growth, establishment 
of the blood-brain barrier, and Alzheimer's disease is accumulating.
