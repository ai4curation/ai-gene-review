To assess the potential involvement of the caspase family in the IL-3-dependent 
murine myeloid leukemic cell line 32D, we studied the effect of bcl-2, crmA and 
three synthetic caspase inhibitors on apoptosis induced by chemotherapy or IL-3 
withdrawal. Apoptosis induced by IL-3 deprivation or by ActD appears to be 
mediated by a crmA-insensitive pathway. Cell death by IL-3 withdrawal is 
inhibited by the caspase-inhibitor ZVAD-fmk, but not DEVD-fmk or YVAD-cmk. In 
contrast, DEVD-fmk as well as ZVAD-fmk protect 32D cells from ActD-induced 
apoptosis. These results indicate that different caspases are involved in 
apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal and by chemotherapy.
