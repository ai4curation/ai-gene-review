Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) associates with the 
cytoplasmic domain of receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANK) and is an essential 
component of the signaling complex mediating osteoclastogenesis. However, the 
osteoclastic activity of TRAF6 is blunted by its association with four and half 
LIM domain 2 (FHL2), which functions as an adaptor protein in the cytoplasm and 
transcriptional regulator in the nucleus. We find that TRAF6 also localizes in 
the nuclei of osteoclasts but not their bone marrow macrophage precursors and 
that osteoclast intranuclear abundance is specifically increased by RANK ligand 
(RANKL). TRAF6 nuclear localization requires FHL2 and is diminished in fhl2(-/-) 
osteoclasts. Suggesting transcriptional activity, TRAF6 interacts with the 
transcription factor RUNX1 in the osteoclast nucleus. FHL2 also associates with 
RUNX1 but does so only in the presence of TRAF6. Importantly, TRAF6 recognizes 
FHL2 and RUNX1 in osteoclast nuclei, and the three molecules form a DNA-binding 
complex that recognizes and transactivates the RUNX1 response element in the 
fhl2 promoter. Finally, TRAF6 and its proximal activator, RANKL, 
polyubiquitinate FHL2, prompting its proteasomal degradation. These observations 
suggest a feedback mechanism whereby TRAF6 negatively regulates osteoclast 
formation by intracytoplasmic sequestration of FHL2 to blunt RANK activation and 
as a component of a transcription complex promoting FHL2 expression.

Abstract

Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) associates with
 the cytoplasmic domain of receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) and is an
 essential component of the signaling complex mediating osteoclastogenesis.
 However, the osteoclastic activity of TRAF6 is blunted by its association with
 four and half LIM domain 2 (FHL2), which functions as an adaptor protein in
 the cytoplasm and transcriptional regulator in the nucleus. We find that TRAF6
 also localizes in the nuclei of osteoclasts but not their bone marrow
 macrophage precursors and that osteoclast intranuclear abundance is
 specifically increased by RANK ligand (RANKL). TRAF6 nuclear localization
 requires FHL2 and is diminished in fhl2 -/- osteoclasts.
 Suggesting transcriptional activity, TRAF6 interacts with the transcription
 factor RUNX1 in the osteoclast nucleus. FHL2 also associates with RUNX1 but
 does so only in the presence of TRAF6. Importantly, TRAF6 recognizes FHL2 and
 RUNX1 in osteoclast nuclei, and the three molecules form a DNA-binding complex
 that recognizes and transactivates the RUNX1 response element in the fhl2 promoter. Finally, TRAF6 and its proximal activator, RANKL,
 polyubiquitinate FHL2, prompting its proteasomal degradation. These
 observations suggest a feedback mechanism whereby TRAF6 negatively regulates
 osteoclast formation by intracytoplasmic sequestration of FHL2 to blunt RANK
 activation and as a component of a transcription complex promoting FHL2
 expression.

RESULTS

TRAF6 Localizes in the Osteoclast Nucleus —TRAF6 resides in
 the cytoplasm where it associates with a number of transmembrane receptors.
 However, it also binds FHL2, which locates in both the cytoplasm and nucleus,
 suggesting that TRAF6 may also enjoy a nuclear distribution
 ( 6 ). To determine whether TRAF6
 localizes in nuclei of osteoclasts and/or their precursors, we
 cytokine-starved naïve BMMs and those induced to undergo
 osteoclastogenesis by exposure to M-CSF and RANKL for 5 days. 3 h later, the
 cells were maintained in absence of cytokine or exposed to optimal
 concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1 (10 ng/ml) or RANKL (100 ng/ml) for 30
 min ( 8 , 11 ). Nuclear proteins were
 extracted and immunoblotted for TRAF6 ( Fig.
 1 A ). Although TRAF6 is undetectable in the nuclei of
 BMMs, regardless of cytokine treatment, it is constitutively present in those
 of osteoclasts. Furthermore, short exposure to RANKL, but not IL-1, enhances
 intranuclear TRAF6 in the mature bone-resorptive cells.

FHL2 Enhances TRAF6 Nuclear Translocation — despite its
 RANKL-stimulated intranuclear translocation, TRAF6 does not contain an
 apparent nuclear localization sequence. Furthermore, although TRAF6 is
 expressed in BMMs and osteoclasts, it is resident in the nucleus only in the
 mature resorptive polykaryon ( Fig.
 1 A ). These findings suggest that TRAF6 utilizes an
 adaptor protein expressed in osteoclasts, but not BMMs, to transit into the
 nucleus. Given that FHL2, which interacts with TRAF6, is present in osteoclast
 cytosol and nucleus and is not expressed by BMMs, we reasoned FHL2 might
 mediate TRAF6 nuclear translocation. To address this hypothesis, we
 transiently transfected COS-7 cells with traf6 -FLAG, with or without fhl2 -HA. 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed, nuclear and
 cytoplasm-enriched fractions were prepared, and TRAF6 and FHL2 cellular
 localization was assessed using anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies. TRAF6 is
 confined to the cytosol in the absence of FHL2
 ( Fig. 1 B , first and second lanes ), but a substantial amount
 translocates to the nucleus in its presence
 ( Fig. 1 B , third and fourth lanes ). As expected, FHL2 is located in
 both compartments. To determine whether FHL2 shuttles TRAF6 into the
 osteoclast nucleus, we treated wild-type (WT) or FHL2 -/- BMMs with
 M-CSF and RANKL for 5 days. Immunoblot analysis revealed that nuclear TRAF6 is
 decreased in osteoclasts lacking FHL2 ( Fig.
 1 C ). Once again, nuclear FHL2 is present in WT cells.
 Finally, we immunostained osteoclasts in culture with anti-TRAF6 and anti-FHL2
 antibodies and observed both moieties colocalizing in the nucleus
 ( Fig. 1 D ).

TRAF6 Interacts with RUNX1 —FHL2 binds TRAF6 and inhibits its
 association with RANK ( 6 ). FHL2
 is also induced as BMMs assume the osteoclast phenotype, suggesting its
 regulated expression may represent a negative feedback of RANKL-mediated
 osteoclast differentiation and function
 ( 6 ).

RUNX1 is a transcription factor implicated in the osteolysis attending
 multiple myeloma ( 12 ).
 Importantly, the fhl2 promoter contains three RUNX1 recognition sites
 ( Fig. 2 A ). Because
 TRAF6 translocates to the nucleus but contains no DNA binding domain, we
 posited that it interacts with transcription factors, such as RUNX1, to
 regulate fhl2 expression. Hence, 293T cells were transiently
 transfected with combinations of traf6 -FLAG and RUNX1 to
 determine whether they associate intracellularly. The transfectant lysates
 were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted for RUNX1.
 As shown in Fig. 2 B ,
 RUNX1 and traf6 coimmunoprecipitate.

To determine whether the RUNX1·TRAF6 complex recognizes the FHL2
 promoter, we performed EMSA. COS-7 cells were transfected with traf6 -FLAG and RUNX1 -HA. Nuclear protein was extracted and
 incubated with biotin-labeled RUNX1 response element of the fhl2 promoter. A protein-DNA complex forms which is reduced by anti-HA or anti-FLAG
 mAbs ( Fig. 2 C ). Thus,
 intranuclear RUNX1 and TRAF6 are components of a protein composite that binds
 the fhl2 promoter in COS-7 cells. To determine whether intranuclear
 TRAF6 and RUNX1 associate in osteoclasts, we treated BMMs with M-CSF and RANKL
 for 5 days. TRAF6 immunoprecipitates of osteoclast nuclei were immunoblotted
 for RUNX1, which was present in this protein complex
 ( Fig. 2 D ). Thus, TRAF6
 interacts with RUNX1 in osteoclast nuclei.

TRAF6 Enhances RUNX1-mediated fhl2 Promoter Activity — Having
 established TRAF6 is a nuclear protein and interacts with RUNX1 and FHL2, we
 asked whether the three form an intracellular complex. Combinations of traf6 -FLAG, fhl2 -FLAG, and RUNX1 -HA were
 transfected into 293T cells. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA
 mAb, and the product was immunoblotted with anti-FLAG mAb
 ( Fig. 3 A ). FHL2-FLAG
 and TRAF6-FLAG were distinguished by molecular weight. RUNX1 and FHL2, alone,
 do not interact but do so in the presence of TRAF6. Thus, the three proteins
 form an intracellular entity when overexpressed in 293T cells. To determine
 whether the same obtains in native osteoclast nuclei, a nucleophosmin-rich
 fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-TRAF6 antibody and immunoblotted for
 RUNX1 and FHL2 ( Fig.
 3 B ). In keeping with immunofluorescent localization
 ( Fig. 1 D ), TRAF6
 coimmunoprecipitates with FHL2 and once again, with RUNX1.

The fact that each protein resides in the osteoclast nucleus suggests the
 TRAF6-FHL2-RUNX1 composite may have transcriptional properties. Hence, we
 performed EMSA on osteoclast nuclear proteins, probing with biotin-labeled fhl2 promoter RUNX1 response element
 ( Fig. 3 C ). Again,
 osteoclast nuclear proteins are present which bind the probe ( lane
 1 ), and the protein-DNA complex is unaltered by anti-IgG antibody
 ( lane 2 ). In contrast, anti-RUNX1 ( lane 3 ), anti-TRAF6
 ( lane 4 ), and anti-FHL2 ( lane 5 ) mAbs each reduce signal
 intensity, indicating this DNA-binding entity contains all three proteins. To
 assess the functional implications of this complex, we transiently transfected
 293T cells with combinations of RUNX1, fhl2 , and traf6 , as
 well as a luciferase reporter, driven by the FHL2 promoter. RUNX1 alone or
 with either FHL2 or TRAF6 moderately increases reporter activity. However, all
 three proteins, in toto , enhance transcription 7-fold
 ( Fig. 3 D ).

FHL2 Is Ubiquitinated by TRAF6 —TRAF6 is an E3 ubiquitin
 ligase ( 5 ), raising the
 possibility that it alters FHL2 function by polyubiquitination. To address
 this issue, we transfected 293T cells with fhl2 -HA, with or without traf6 -FLAG. FHL2 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA mAb, and the
 immunoprecipitate was stained for ubiquitin content. Consistent with the E3
 ligase activity of TRAF6, FHL2 polyubiquitination is increased as the two
 proteins associate ( Fig.
 4 A ).

TRAF6 typically functions as an E3 ligase by facilitating assembly of
 Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitin chains
 ( 13 ). To determine whether
 this is so in the context of TRAF6-mediated FHL2 polyubiquitination, we
 transfected 293T cells with traf6 -FLAG and fhl2 -HA as well
 as WT or inactive K63R ubiquitin. Because of evidence that TRAF6 may also
 promote Lys 48 -linked polyubiquitination, we also examined the
 effects of the K48R mutant
 ( 14 ). K29R ubiquitin served as
 control. The cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, and FHL2
 was immunoprecipitated from the lysate. The immunoprecipitates were blotted
 with anti-FHL2, anti-TRAF6, and anti-ubiquitin mAbs. FHL2 and TRAF6
 coprecipitate regardless of the cotransfected ubiquitin construct
 ( Fig. 4 B ). In keeping
 with its E3 ligase activity in other cells, the capacity of TRAF6 to
 polyubiquitinate FHL2 is reduced in the presence of ubiquitin K63R. Ubiquitin
 K48R moderately dampens FHL2 polyubiquitination whereas ubiquitin K29R is as
 effective as the WT construct. Thus, TRAF6 principally ubiquitinates FHL2 in a
 Lys 63 -dependent manner, but also promotes Lys 48 ubiquitin chain linkage.

Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitination typically activates events such
 as protein-protein recognition and cytoplasm to nuclear translocation
 ( 15 ). Because these phenomena
 are both components of the TRAF6-FHL2-RUNX1 signaling pathway we asked if they
 are mediated by FHL2 polyubiquitination. First, we transfected 293T cells with
 combinations of fhl2 -FLAG, RUNX1 -HA, traf6 -FLAG,
 and increasing concentrations of ubiquitin-His. As seen in Fig. 4 C , the
 FHL2-RUNX1 association is not altered by the presence or absence of
 ubiquitin.

To determine whether the TRAF6 ubiquitination of FHL2 mediates nuclear
 localization, COS-7 cells were transfected with traf6 -FLAG, fhl2 -FLAG, and ubiquitin-HA. TRAF6-FLAG and FHL2-FLAG were
 immunoblotted in cytosol- and nuclear-enriched fractions, the latter
 characterized by an abundance of nucleophosmin. Again, FHL2 is necessary for
 TRAF6 nuclear localization, but the process is unaffected by the presence of
 ubiquitin ( Fig. 4 D ).
 Hence, the E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 regulates neither its inclusion in a
 transcription complex nor its nuclear translocation.

Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitination does not promote proteasomal
 degradation of target proteins. However, we and others find that TRAF6 also
 induces Lys 48 -linked ubiquitination
 ( 14 ). Moreover, RANKL, which
 activates TRAF6, induces proteasome-mediated degradation of proteins such as
 IκB. We therefore asked whether RANKL prompts FHL2 ubiquitination and
 degradation. To this end, we transduced BMMs with fhl2 -HA,
 cytokine-starved the cells, and exposed them to RANKL, with time, in the
 presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132
 ( Fig. 4 E ). HA
 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for ubiquitin. Although
 monoubiquitinated FHL2 is unaltered by MG132, osteoclast precursors express
 increasing amounts of the polyubiquitinated species with RANKL exposure, only
 when proteasome activity is arrested. Thus, RANKL-stimulated TRAF6 activity is
 associated with ubiquitination of FHL2 and its proteasomal degradation.

DISCUSSION

The magnitude of osteoclast activity profoundly affects skeletal balance
 because virtually all osteoporotic diseases reflect its enhancement relative
 to bone formation. Thus, precise regulation of osteoclast formation and
 function is required to maintain normal bone mass. The discovery of RANKL
 provides the most important clues as to how osteoclasts are generated and
 activated. Less is known, however, as to how RANKL-stimulated
 osteoclastogenesis is negatively controlled.

The RANK intracellular domain recognizes a variety of TRAFs, but only TRAF6
 is central to the osteoclastogenic process
 ( 16 ). Other receptors, such as
 CD40, TLR4, and those recognizing IL-1 and IL-17, also bind TRAF6, but unlike
 RANK, they are not uniquely capable of promoting osteoclast differentiation
 ( 14 , 17 ). Although controversial,
 the most compelling evidence suggests that this distinction reflects the
 abundance of TRAF6 recognition sites in the RANK cytoplasmic domain relative
 to that of other receptors
 ( 18 ). Upon binding to RANK,
 TRAF6 trimerizes and activates a series of intracellular signaling molecules
 central to the osteoclastogenic process, principally NF-κB and
 mitogen-activated protein kinases, thereby indirectly modulating gene
 transcription via NF-κB nuclear translocation and AP-1 transcription
 factor activation ( 17 ).

FHL2 is a promiscuous protein that interacts with at least 50 cytosolic and
 intranuclear binding partners
 ( 7 ). It consequently regulates
 an array of biological events, including signal transduction and
 transcriptional activation and repression. Although FHL2 contains some
 structural features consistent with those of a transcription factor, its
 ability to bind DNA directly is not established. Thus, its intranuclear
 function probably mirrors its cytoplasmic role, namely as a recruiter of
 proteins that, in this circumstance, directly or indirectly modulate
 transcription. For example, FHL2 interacts with transcription factors, such as
 β-catenin ( 19 ) and the
 androgen and estrogen receptors
 ( 20 , 21 ). FHL2 also recruits
 CBP/p300 to target gene
 ( 22 ).

We established that FHL2 sequesters TRAF6 in osteoclasts and in so doing
 inhibits its association with RANK, thereby diminishing osteoclast formation
 and function ( 6 ). We also noted
 that FHL2 is not expressed in osteoclast precursors but appears with their
 exposure to RANKL and M-CSF. Taken together, these data raised the possibility
 that FHL2 synthesis may represent a negative feedback mechanism for
 accelerated bone resorption. Buttressing this posture is the fact that FHL2 is
 expressed by osteoclasts, in vivo , only in states of pathological
 bone resorption such as inflammatory osteolysis, where presence of the adaptor
 protein has a protective effect on periarticular osteolysis
 ( 6 ).

Because it is bound by FHL2, which is abundant in the nucleus, we asked
 whether the same is true regarding TRAF6. We noted that although TRAF6 is
 constitutively present in osteoclast nuclei and further accumulates under the
 influence of RANKL, none is detectable in the nuclei of BMMs despite its
 abundant expression in these cells. FHL2 being absent in BMMs, but induced
 with exposure to RANKL, suggested that FHL2, may, at least in part, mediate
 TRAF6 nuclear localization. In fact, meaningful TRAF6 nuclear translocation
 requires coexpression of FHL2 in 293T cells and is substantially reduced in
 FHL2-deficient osteoclast nuclei.

FHL2 and TRAF6 each lack an apparent nuclear localization motif. However,
 the relatively modest molecular mass (32 kDa) of FHL2 would theoretically
 permit it to transit nuclear pores, although such would not be the case for
 TRAF6 (57 kDa). Thus, its association with FHL2 may optimize the nuclear
 localization of TRAF6. However, the presence of residual TRAF6 in fhl2 -/- osteoclast nuclei suggests that the event may also
 be mediated by a shuttle protein in addition to FHL2.

TRAF6 contains a RING domain structurally homologous to E3 ubiquitin
 ligases, and it polyubiquitinates itself and a number of target proteins via
 Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitin chains that promote molecular signaling
 rather than protein degradation
 ( 5 , 13 , 23 ). We find that TRAF6 also
 stimulates FHL2 ubiquitination, predominantly in a Lys 63 -dependent
 manner. However, TRAF6 mirrors its effect on the IL-17 receptor
 ( 14 ) by promoting a modest
 amount FHL2 polyubiquitination via Lys 48 , a ubiquitin residue
 prompting proteasomal degradation
 ( 24 , 25 ).

Having established that TRAF6 ubiquitinates FHL2, we asked whether this
 event regulates nuclear translocation. Our first exercise was to determine
 whether FHL2 residence in the nucleus depends upon TRAF6 as an E3 ligase. Our
 rationale for these experiments was the fact that TRAF6-mediated
 ubiquitination regulates nuclear translocation of the p75 neutrophil receptor
 interactor, NIRF ( 15 ), and the
 nerve growth factor receptor, TrkA
 ( 26 ). However, FHL2 transports
 TRAF6 into the nucleus regardless of ubiquitination.

The nuclear localization and association of TRAF6 and FHL2 in osteoclasts
 raise the possibility that they may participate in gene transcription. Neither
 protein, however, contains a DNA binding consensus, indicating that if they
 impact gene expression it would be as coregulators associated with a primary
 transcription factor. Thus, our challenge was to discover a candidate gene
 regulated by TRAF6/FHL2 and identify relevant response elements in its
 promoter. Our rationale for selecting the fhl2 gene, itself, was the
 fact that it is induced with TRAF6 activation, by RANKL, and its product
 impacts osteoclast formation and function
 ( 6 ). Thus, we examined the fhl2 promoter and discovered two RUNX1 recognition sequences.

RUNX1 is a Runt-related protein essential for hematopoietic development
 ( 27 ). It is also among the
 most targeted transcription factors associated with various forms of leukemia.
 RUNX1 interacts with many coregulators and transcription factors, including
 PU.1, thereby inducing expression of the M-CSF receptor, c-Fms
 ( 28 , 29 ). Both PU.1 and c-Fms are
 essential for osteoclastogenesis. RUNX1 also associates with molecules
 recognized by FHL2, such as CBP/p300
 ( 22 ). We find that FHL2
 interacts with RUNX1 but only in the context of TRAF6 wherein the three
 proteins form a DNA-binding complex that transactivates the fhl2 promoter. The fact that RUNX1 fails to associate with FHL2 in the absence of
 TRAF6 suggested that polyubiquitinated FHL2 may recruit additional proteins,
 such as RUNX1 ( 5 ). We find,
 however, that like TRAF6 nuclear localization, RUNX1-FHL2 association is
 independent of ubiquitin.

These and our previous data
 ( 6 ) suggest a model whereby
 TRAF-6 and FHL2 autoregulate osteoclastogenesis. Upon RANKL stimulation, TRAF6
 activates an array of osteoclastogenic molecules, including NF-κB and
 NFAT-c1 ( 30 ). At the same
 time, TRAF6 is sequestered by FHL2, which inhibits its binding to RANK, thus
 attenuating osteoclast formation. FHL2 and TRAF6 translocate to the nucleus
 where they both associate with RUNX1 to form a transcription complex that
 transactivates the fhl2 gene. Increased FHL2 expression serves to
 further dampen RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and function. Alternatively,
 the antiosteoclastogenic properties of FHL2 are blunted by RANKL-induced
 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Thus, development of FHL2 mimetics
 may represent a strategy for preventing pathological bone resorption such as
 that attending inflammatory arthritis.
