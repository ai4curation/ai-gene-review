RATIONALE: Histone deacetylase (HDAC)7 is expressed in the early stages of 
embryonic development and may play a role in endothelial function.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the role of HDAC7 in endothelial cell 
(EC) proliferation and growth and the underlying mechanism.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Overexpression of HDAC7 by adenoviral gene transfer 
suppressed human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation by 
preventing nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and downregulation of T-cell 
factor-1/Id2 (inhibitor of DNA binding 2) and cyclin D1, leading to G(1) phase 
elongation. Further assays with the TOPFLASH reporter and quantitative RT-PCR 
for other beta-catenin target genes such as Axin2 confirmed that overexpression 
of HDAC7 decreased beta-catenin activity. Knockdown of HDAC7 by lentiviral short 
hairpin RNA transfer induced beta-catenin nuclear translocation but 
downregulated cyclin D1, cyclin E1 and E2F2, causing HUVEC hypertrophy. 
Immunoprecipitation assay and mass spectrometry analysis revealed that HDAC7 
directly binds to beta-catenin and forms a complex with 14-3-3 epsilon, zeta, 
and eta proteins. Vascular endothelial growth factor treatment induced HDAC7 
degradation via PLCgamma-IP3K (phospholipase Cgamma-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 
kinase) signal pathway and partially rescued HDAC7-mediated suppression of 
proliferation. Moreover, vascular endothelial growth factor stimulation 
suppressed the binding of HDAC7 with beta-catenin, disrupting the complex and 
releasing beta-catenin to translocate into the nucleus.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that HDAC7 interacts with beta-catenin 
keeping ECs in a low proliferation stage and provides a novel insight into the 
mechanism of HDAC7-mediated signal pathways leading to endothelial growth.
