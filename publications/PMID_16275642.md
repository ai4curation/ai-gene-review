The Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex contains several previously characterized 
proteins, including Rpd3, Sin3, Sds3, Sap30, and Pho23. We purified the Rdp3 
complex to near homogeneity using the tandem affinity purification method. Mass 
spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of a novel component, which we 
named Raf60. We showed that Myc-Raf60 co-fractionated with Rpd3-TAP by gel 
filtration chromatography, and both Myc-Rpd3 and Sin3 co-immunoprecipitated with 
HA-Raf60. In addition, HA-Raf60 immunoprecipitates displayed Rpd3-dependent 
histone deacetylase activity, and raf60 deletion resulted in loss of Rpd3 
complex activity, as measured by in vitro assays. Furthermore, we found that 
raf60Delta cells exhibited phenotypes similar to those of rpd3Delta cells, 
including derepression of secreted acid phosphatase (Pho5), hypersensitivity to 
cycloheximide, and hypersensitivity to heat shock. Also, we found by reverse 
transcription-PCR that raf60Delta cells, similar to rpd3Delta cells, displayed 
elevated levels of PHO5 and INO1 mRNA. Our results demonstrate that Raf60 is a 
component of the Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex and that it is required for 
normal Rpd3 complex activity and repression of gene expression.
