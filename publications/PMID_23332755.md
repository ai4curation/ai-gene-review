In eukaryotic cells a molecular chaperone network associates with translating 
ribosomes, assisting the maturation of emerging nascent polypeptides. Hsp70 is 
perhaps the major eukaryotic ribosome-associated chaperone and the first 
reported to bind cotranslationally to nascent chains. However, little is known 
about the underlying principles and function of this interaction. Here, we use a 
sensitive and global approach to define the cotranslational substrate 
specificity of the yeast Hsp70 SSB. We find that SSB binds to a subset of 
nascent polypeptides whose intrinsic properties and slow translation rates 
hinder efficient cotranslational folding. The SSB-ribosome cycle and substrate 
recognition is modulated by its ribosome-bound cochaperone, RAC. Deletion of SSB 
leads to widespread aggregation of newly synthesized polypeptides. Thus, 
cotranslationally acting Hsp70 meets the challenge of folding the eukaryotic 
proteome by stabilizing its longer, more slowly translated, and 
aggregation-prone nascent polypeptides.
