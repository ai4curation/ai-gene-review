Activation of immune cells has to be tightly controlled to prevent detrimental 
hyperactivation. In this regulatory process molecules of the C-type lectin-like 
family play a central role. Here we describe a new member of this family, 
CLEC12B. The extracellular domain of CLEC12B shows considerable homology to the 
activating natural killer cell receptor NKG2D, but unlike NKG2D, CLEC12B 
contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif in its intracellular 
domain. Despite the homology, CLEC12B does not appear to bind NKG2D ligands and 
therefore does not represent the inhibitory counterpart of NKG2D. However, 
CLEC12B has the ability to counteract NKG2D-mediated signaling, and we show that 
this function is dependent on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif 
and the recruitment of the phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. Using monoclonal 
anti-CLEC12B antibodies we found de novo expression of this receptor on in vitro 
generated human macrophages and on the human myelo-monocytic cell line U937 upon 
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment, suggesting that this receptor plays a 
role in myeloid cell function.
