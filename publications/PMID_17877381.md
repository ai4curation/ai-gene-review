FKBP-12, a 12 kDa FK506-binding protein (neuroimmunophilin), acts as a receptor 
for the immunosuppressant drug FK506. Neuroimmunophilins, including FKBP-12, are 
abundant in the brain and have been shown to be involved in reversing neuronal 
degeneration and preventing cell death. In this report, we have utilized several 
analytical techniques, such as in situ hybridization, Western blotting, 
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and liquid chromatography electrospray 
tandem mass spectrometry to study the transcriptional expression as well as 
protein levels of FKBP-12 in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model 
of Parkinson's disease. The FKBP-12 protein was also detected directly on brain 
tissue sections using mass spectrometry profiling. We found increased levels of 
FKBP-12 mRNA and protein in the dorsal and middle part of the 6-OHDA lesioned 
striatum. Thus, these studies clearly demonstrate that FKBP-12 is increased in 
the brain of a common animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Additionally, we 
have identified potential binding partners to FKBP-12 that may be implicated in 
the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, such as alpha-enolase, 14-3-3 
zeta/delta, pyruvate kinase isozymes, and heat shock protein 70, using surface 
plasmon resonance sensor technology in combination with mass spectrometry. In 
conclusion, these data strongly suggests that FKBP-12 is altered in an 
experimental model of PD.
