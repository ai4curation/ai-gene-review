The histone fold is a structural motif with which two related proteins interact 
and is found in complexes involved in wrapping DNA, the nucleosome, and 
transcriptional regulation, as in NC2. We reveal a novel function for 
histone-fold proteins: facilitation of nucleosome remodeling. ACF1-ISWI complex 
(ATP-dependent chromatin assembly and remodeling factor [ACF]) associates with 
histone-fold proteins (CHRAC-15 and CHRAC-17 in the human chromatin 
accessibility complex [CHRAC]) whose functional relevance has been unclear. We 
show that these histone-fold proteins facilitate ATP-dependent nucleosome 
sliding by ACF. Direct interaction of the CHRAC-15/17 complex with the ACF1 
subunit is essential for this process. CHRAC-17 interacts with another 
histone-fold protein, p12, in DNA polymerase epsilon, but CHRAC-15 is essential 
for interaction with ACF and enhancement of nucleosome sliding. Surprisingly, 
CHRAC-15/17, p12/CHRAC-17, and NC2 complexes facilitate ACF-mediated chromatin 
assembly by a mechanism different from nucleosome sliding enhancement, 
suggesting a general activity of H2A/H2B type histone-fold complexes in 
chromatin assembly.
