Ebp1, an ErbB3 receptor-binding protein, inhibits the proliferation and induces 
the differentiation of human cancer cells. Ebp1 binds nuclear Akt and prevents 
DNA fragmentation by inhibiting caspase-activated DNase. Here, we show that Ebp1 
possesses two different isoforms, p48 and p42, which differentially mediate PC12 
cell survival and differentiation. The longer-form p48 localizes in both the 
cytoplasm and the nucleus and suppresses apoptosis, whereas the shorter-form p42 
predominantly resides in the cytoplasm and promotes cell differentiation. EGF 
strongly stimulates p42 to bind ErbB3, and the association depends on 
PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Ebp1. By contrast, p48 does not bind to ErbB3 
regardless of EGF treatment. Overexpression of p48 provokes cell proliferation, 
which is inhibited by p42. Moreover, nerve growth factor elicits extensive 
sprouting in p42 stably transfected PC12 cells, whereas p48 cells reveal modest 
neurite outgrowth. Although mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade remains 
similar in both cells, Akt is more active in p48 cells than in p42 cells. Thus, 
Ebp1 might regulate cell survival and differentiation through two distinctive 
p48 and p42 isoforms.
