Predicting reward is essential in learning approach behaviors. Dopaminergic 
activity has been implicated in reward, movement, and cognitive processes, all 
essential elements in learning. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) receives converging 
inputs from corticolimbic information-processing areas and from mesolimbic 
dopamine neurons originating in the ventral tegmental area. Previously, we 
reported that in mice, a dopamine D2 receptor knockout (D2R-KO) eliminated the 
prereward inhibitory response, increased place-field size of NAc neurons, and 
reduced locomotor activity without marked change in intracranial 
self-stimulation (ICSS) behavior. The present study investigated the specific 
contribution of dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) in mediating reward, locomotor 
activity, and spatial associative processes and in regulating NAc neural 
responses. In contrast to D2R-KO animals, here we find D1R-KO in mice 
selectively eliminated the prereward excitatory response and decreased 
place-field size of NAc neurons. Furthermore, D1R-KO impaired ICSS behavior, 
seriously reduced locomotor activity, and retarded acquisition of a place 
learning task. Thus, the present results suggest that D1R may be an important 
determinant in brain stimulation reward (ICSS) and participates in coding for a 
type of reward prediction of NAc neurons and in spatial learning.
