We report the isolation of bcl-x, a bcl-2-related gene that can function as a 
bcl-2-independent regulator of programmed cell death (apoptosis). Alternative 
splicing results in two distinct bcl-x mRNAs. The protein product of the larger 
mRNA, bcl-xL, is similar in size and predicted structure to Bcl-2. When stably 
transfected into an IL-3-dependent cell line, bcl-xL inhibits cell death upon 
growth factor withdrawal at least as well as bcl-2. Surprisingly, the second 
mRNA species, bcl-xS, encodes a protein that inhibits the ability of bcl-2 to 
enhance the survival of growth factor-deprived cells. In vivo, bcl-xS mRNA is 
expressed at high levels in cells that undergo a high rate of turnover, such as 
developing lymphocytes. In contrast, bcl-xL is found in tissues containing 
long-lived postmitotic cells, such as adult brain. Together these data suggest 
that bcl-x plays an important role in both positive and negative regulation of 
programmed cell death.
