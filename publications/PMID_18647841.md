The origin recognition complex (ORC) is conserved in all eukaryotes. The six 
proteins of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORC that form a stable complex bind to 
origins of DNA replication and recruit prereplicative complex (pre-RC) proteins, 
one of which is Cdc6. To further understand the function of ORC we recently 
determined by single-particle reconstruction of electron micrographs a 
low-resolution, 3D structure of S. cerevisiae ORC and the ORC-Cdc6 complex. In 
this article, the spatial arrangement of the ORC subunits within the ORC 
structure is described. In one approach, a maltose binding protein (MBP) was 
systematically fused to the N or the C termini of the five largest ORC subunits, 
one subunit at a time, generating 10 MBP-fused ORCs, and the MBP density was 
localized in the averaged, 2D EM images of the MBP-fused ORC particles. 
Determining the Orc1-5 structure and comparing it with the native ORC structure 
localized the Orc6 subunit near Orc2 and Orc3. Finally, subunit-subunit 
interactions were determined by immunoprecipitation of ORC subunits synthesized 
in vitro. Based on the derived ORC architecture and existing structures of 
archaeal Orc1-DNA structures, we propose a model for ORC and suggest how ORC 
interacts with origin DNA and Cdc6. The studies provide a basis for 
understanding the overall structure of the pre-RC.
