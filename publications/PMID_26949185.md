The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is initiated by mitochondrial outer 
membrane permeabilization (MOMP). The BCL-2 family effectors BAX and BAK are 
thought to be absolutely required for this process. Here, we report that BCL-2 
ovarian killer (BOK) is a bona fide yet unconventional effector of MOMP that can 
trigger apoptosis in the absence of both BAX and BAK. However, unlike the 
canonical effectors, BOK appears to be constitutively active and unresponsive to 
antagonistic effects of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins. Rather, BOK is 
controlled at the level of protein stability by components of the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER)-associated degradation pathway. BOK is ubiquitylated by the 
AMFR/gp78 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and targeted for proteasomal degradation 
in a VCP/p97-dependent manner, which allows survival of the cell. When 
proteasome function, VCP, or gp78 activity is compromised, BOK is stabilized to 
induce MOMP and apoptosis independently of other BCL-2 proteins.
