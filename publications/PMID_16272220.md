All organisms contain thioredoxin (TRX), a regulatory thiol:disulfide protein 
that reduces disulfide bonds in target proteins. Unlike animals and yeast, 
plants contain numerous TRXs for which no function has been assigned in vivo. 
Recent in vitro proteomic approaches have opened the way to the identification 
of >100 TRX putative targets, but of which none of the numerous plant TRXs can 
be specifically associated. In contrast, in vivo methodologies, including 
classical yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) systems, failed to reveal the expected high 
number of TRX targets. Here, we developed a yeast strain named CY306 designed to 
identify TRX targets in vivo by a Y2H approach. CY306 contains a GAL4 reporter 
system but also carries deletions of endogenous genes encoding cytosolic TRXs 
(TRX1 and TRX2) that presumably compete with TRXs introduced as bait. We 
demonstrate here that, in the CY306 strain, yeast TRX1 and TRX2, as well as 
Arabidopsis TRX introduced as bait, interact with known TRX targets or putative 
partners such as yeast peroxiredoxins AHP1 and TSA1, whereas the same 
interactions cannot be detected in classical Y2H strains. Thanks to CY306, we 
also show that TRXs interact with the phosphoadenosine-5-phosphosulfate (PAPS) 
reductase MET16 through a conserved cysteine. Moreover, interactions visualized 
in CY306 are highly specific depending on the TRX and targets tested. CY306 
constitutes a relevant genetic system to explore the TRX interactome in vivo and 
with high specificity, and opens new perspectives in the search for new 
TRX-interacting proteins by Y2H library screening in organisms with multiple 
TRXs.
