Abnormality in the machinery of apoptosis is associated with a resistant 
phenotype of the tumor cell to chemotherapy. To determine the molecular basis of 
resistance to antitumor agent-induced apoptosis, we performed a complementary 
DNA (cDNA) subtractive hybridization with messenger RNA (mRNA) from human 
monocytic leukemia U937 and its variant UK711, which is resistant to apoptosis 
induced by antitumor agents. We found that glyoxalase I (GLO1), an enzyme that 
detoxifies methylglyoxal, is selectively overexpressed in the 
apoptosis-resistant UK711 cells. The GLO1 enzyme activity was significantly 
elevated in UK711 and UK110 cells, another drug-resistant mutant, as well as in 
K562/ADM, adriamycin-resistant leukemia cells, compared with their parental 
cells. When overexpressed in human Jurkat cells, GLO1 inhibited etoposide- and 
adriamycin-induced caspase activation and apoptosis, indicating the involvement 
of GLO1 in apoptosis suppression caused by these drugs. Moreover, cotreatment 
with S-p-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (BBGC), a cell-permeable 
inhibitor of GLO1, enhanced etoposide-induced apoptosis in resistant UK711 cells 
but not in parental U937 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that GLO1 
is a resistant factor to antitumor agent-induced apoptosis in human leukemia 
cells and that the GLO1 inhibitor could be a drug resistance-reversing agent.
