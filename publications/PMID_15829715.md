Cadmium (Cd2+) poisoning causes severe renal disorders manifested by defects in 
reabsorptive transport of various compounds. It is reported here that the renal 
brush-border membrane Na+/glucose co-transporter-1 (SGLT1) is a molecular target 
for Cd2+ toxicity. In micromolar concentrations, Cd2+ acted as a noncompetitive, 
partial inhibitor of methyl-D-glucopyranoside uptake in vesicles from COS-7 
cells transiently expressing SGLT1. In contrast, only a modest effect in the 
closely related Na+/myo-inositol co-transporter-1 (SMIT1) was observed. The 
factor responsible for this difference was the CXXC motif (X can be any residue) 
at the cytoplasmic end of the eighth transmembrane segment (TM8) of SGLT1. Thus, 
a mutational transfer of this motif conveyed Cd2+ sensitivity to SMIT1. 
Moreover, mimicking the inhibitory effect of Cd2+, the biarsenical molecule 
FlAsH-EDT2 strongly inhibited the SGLT1 that had an engineered tetracysteine 
motif at the cytoplasmic end of TM8. The experiments also showed that covalent 
binding of the sulfhydryl reactive biotin-PEO-maleimide to the SGLT1 wild type 
but not to the mutant lacking the CXXC motif was suppressed by Cd2+. Taken 
together, these results suggest that in SGLT1, Cd2+ binding to the CXXC motif 
induces conformational changes that cause a partial inhibition of d-glucose 
transport.
