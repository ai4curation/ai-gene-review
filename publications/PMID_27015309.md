In C. elegans, small RNAs enable transmission of epigenetic responses across 
multiple generations. While RNAi inheritance mechanisms that enable 
"memorization" of ancestral responses are being elucidated, the mechanisms that 
determine the duration of inherited silencing and the ability to forget the 
inherited epigenetic effects are not known. We now show that exposure to dsRNA 
activates a feedback loop whereby gene-specific RNAi responses dictate the 
transgenerational duration of RNAi responses mounted against unrelated genes, 
elicited separately in previous generations. RNA-sequencing analysis reveals 
that, aside from silencing of genes with complementary sequences, dsRNA-induced 
RNAi affects the production of heritable endogenous small RNAs, which regulate 
the expression of RNAi factors. Manipulating genes in this feedback pathway 
changes the duration of heritable silencing. Such active control of 
transgenerational effects could be adaptive, since ancestral responses would be 
detrimental if the environments of the progeny and the ancestors were different.
