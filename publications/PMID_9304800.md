Thrombospondin-1 is a glycoprotein that is released from platelet alpha-granules 
in response to thrombin stimulation and that is also a transient component of 
extracellular matrix in developing and repairing tissues. It is a 420 kDa 
homotrimer, each subunit of which consists of multiple structural domains. A 
variety of factors regulate thrombospondin-1 expression and the protein is 
degraded by both extracellular and intracellular routes. Thrombospondin-1 
functions as a cell adhesion molecule and also modulates cell movement, cell 
proliferation, neurite outgrowth and angiogenesis. The molecular mechanisms 
underlying these activities are beginning to be examined. Medical interest in 
thrombospondin-1 centres on its roles in haemostasis and its effects on 
angiogenesis.
