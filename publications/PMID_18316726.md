Human helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF) is frequently inactivated in 
colorectal and gastric cancers. Here, we show that HLTF is a functional 
homologue of yeast Rad5 that promotes error-free replication through DNA 
lesions. HLTF and Rad5 share the same unique structural features, including a 
RING domain embedded within a SWI/SNF helicase domain and an HIRAN domain. We 
find that inactivation of HLTF renders human cells sensitive to UV and other 
DNA-damaging agents and that HLTF complements the UV sensitivity of a rad5Delta 
yeast strain. Also, similar to Rad5, HLTF physically interacts with the 
Rad6-Rad18 and Mms2-Ubc13 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complexes and promotes 
the Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen at 
its Lys-164 residue. A requirement of HLTF for error-free postreplication repair 
of damaged DNA is in keeping with its cancer-suppression role.
