A series of 3-benzylidene-4-chromanone derivatives (3-20) were synthesized and 
the structure-activity relationships for antioxidant and α-glucosidase 
inhibitory activities were evaluated. Among synthesized compounds, compounds 5, 
13, 18, which contain catechol moiety, showed the potent 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity (5: EC50 
13 µM; 13: EC50 14 µM; 18: EC50 13 µM). The compounds 12, 14, 18 showed higher 
α-glucosidase inhibitory activity (12: IC50 15 µM; 14: IC50 25 µM; 18: IC50 
28 µM). The compound 18 showed both of potent DPPH radical scavenging and 
α-glucosidase inhibitory activities. These data suggest that 
3-benzylidene-4-chromanone derivatives, such as compound 18, may serve as the 
lead compound for the development of novel α-glucosidase inhibitors with 
antioxidant activity.
