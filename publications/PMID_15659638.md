We have defined amino acids important for function of the Arabidopsis thaliana 
Hsp100/ClpB chaperone (AtHsp101) in acquired thermotolerance by isolating 
recessive, loss-of-function mutations and a novel semidominant, gain-of-function 
allele [hot1-4 (A499T)]. The hot1-4 allele is unusual in that it not only fails 
to develop thermotolerance to 45 degrees C after acclimation at 38 degrees C, 
but also is sensitive to 38 degrees C, which is a permissive temperature for 
wild-type and loss-of-function mutants. hot1-4 lies between nucleotide binding 
domain 1 (NBD1) and NBD2 in a coiled-coil domain that is characteristic of the 
Hsp100/ClpB proteins. We then isolated two classes of intragenic suppressor 
mutations of hot1-4: loss-of-function mutations (Class 1) that eliminated the 38 
degrees C sensitivity, but did not restore thermotolerance function to hot1-4, 
and Class 2 suppressors that restored acquired thermotolerance function to 
hot1-4. Location of the hot1-4 Class 2 suppressors supports a functional link 
between the coiled-coil domain and both NBD1 and the axial channel of the 
Hsp100/ClpB hexamer. In addition, the strongest Class 2 suppressors restored 
solubility of aggregated small heat shock proteins (sHsps) after heat stress, 
revealing genetic interaction of the Hsp100/ClpB and sHsp chaperone systems. 
These results also demonstrate that quantitative phenotypes can be used for in 
vivo genetic dissection of protein mechanism in Arabidopsis.

Abstract

We have defined amino acids important for function of the Arabidopsis thaliana Hsp100/ClpB chaperone ( At Hsp101) in acquired thermotolerance by isolating recessive, loss-of-function mutations and a novel semidominant, gain-of-function allele [ hot1-4 (A499T)]. The hot1-4 allele is unusual in that it not only fails to develop thermotolerance to 45°C after acclimation at 38°C, but also is sensitive to 38°C, which is a permissive temperature for wild-type and loss-of-function mutants. hot1-4 lies between nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) and NBD2 in a coiled-coil domain that is characteristic of the Hsp100/ClpB proteins. We then isolated two classes of intragenic suppressor mutations of hot1-4 : loss-of-function mutations (Class 1) that eliminated the 38°C sensitivity, but did not restore thermotolerance function to hot1-4 , and Class 2 suppressors that restored acquired thermotolerance function to hot1-4. Location of the hot1-4 Class 2 suppressors supports a functional link between the coiled-coil domain and both NBD1 and the axial channel of the Hsp100/ClpB hexamer. In addition, the strongest Class 2 suppressors restored solubility of aggregated small heat shock proteins (sHsps) after heat stress, revealing genetic interaction of the Hsp100/ClpB and sHsp chaperone systems. These results also demonstrate that quantitative phenotypes can be used for in vivo genetic dissection of protein mechanism in Arabidopsis.

INTRODUCTION

Hsp100/ClpB chaperones are hexameric members of the AAA+ family of proteins, which are ATPases that couple ATP binding and hydrolysis to a variety of protein-remodeling activities ( Neuwald et al., 1999 ; Vale, 2000 ; Ogura and Wilkinson, 2001 ; Lupas and Martin, 2002 ). Hsp100/ClpB proteins have been shown to be essential for the development of thermotolerance to high temperature in bacteria ( Goloubinoff et al., 1999 ), yeast ( Glover and Lindquist, 1998 ), some parasitic protozoa, and higher plants ( Hong and Vierling, 2000 , 2001 ), which are the only higher eukaryotes known to express the Hsp100/ClpB subgroup of chaperones. The demonstration that the highly heat-induced Hsp100/ClpB protein in Arabidopsis thaliana , At Hsp101, was essential for acquisition of tolerance to high temperature also represented a direct link of a heat shock protein to heat tolerance in plants. Both in vivo and in vitro evidence indicates that the protective function of these chaperones is a result of their ability to resolubilize protein aggregates in cooperation with the Hsp70/DnaK chaperone system ( Goloubinoff et al., 1999 ; Zolkiewiski, 1999 ). It remains unknown, however, whether general removal of aggregated proteins or rescue of certain critical substrates defines the essential activity of Hsp100/ClpB in thermotolerance.

This unique subgroup of ATPases contains two AAA modules, each comprised of a nucleotide binding domain (NBD1 or 2) with conserved Walker A, Walker B, and sensor motifs and a smaller C-terminal domain. The AAA modules are flanked by additional N- and C-terminal domains and are separated by a large coiled-coil domain, which is actually an insertion into the C-terminal small domain of AAA module 1 (see Figure 1A ). The length of the coiled-coil domain is a major feature that distinguishes Hsp100/ClpB proteins from other Clp proteins with two AAA modules (e.g., ClpA) ( Schirmer et al., 1996 ; Celerin et al., 1998 ; Nieto-Sotelo et al., 1999 ). The recent 3.0-Å structure of a complete Thermus thermophilus ClpB subunit, and a cryoelectron microscopy reconstruction of the hexamer (21-Å resolution), has defined the structure of the different ClpB domains and how they are oriented relative to each other ( Lee et al., 2003 ). In each AAA module, NBD1 and 2 have a RecA-like mononucleotide binding fold, and the C-terminal smaller domain has a mixed α/β structure. The two AAA modules are stacked on each other within a subunit such that the hexamer appears as two rings of six ATPase sites, surrounding a pore or axial channel on the order of ∼16 Å in diameter. The coiled-coil domain, which is inserted into the smaller domain of NBD1, is 85-Å long and resembles a two-bladed propeller ringing the outside of the hexamer. Based on the observation of three different conformations in the crystal structure, the N-terminal domain and coiled-coil domain are proposed to be mobile. This is consistent with the fact that deletion of either domain does not disrupt the hexamer ( Mogk et al., 2003b ).

Biochemical studies using both in vitro assays for ATP hydrolysis and protein disaggregation (chaperone activity), along with in vivo assays for thermotolerance, have also begun to dissect functional domains of Hsp100/ClpB ( Smith et al., 1999 ; Barnett et al., 2000 ; Clarke and Eriksson, 2000 ; Schirmer et al., 2001 ; Beinker et al., 2002 ; Cashikar et al., 2002 ; Mogk et al., 2003b ; Strub et al., 2003 ). However, details of the Hsp100/ClpB reaction cycle are unknown. The ATPase activity of both NBDs, as well as an intact coiled-coil domain, are essential for chaperone activity and in vivo thermotolerance ( Kim et al., 2000a ; Schirmer et al., 2001 ; Hattendorf and Lindquist, 2002b ; Mogk et al., 2003b ). A majority of data indicate that deletion of the N-terminal domain does not impair measured activities, and its function remains unknown ( Clarke and Eriksson, 2000 ; Beinker et al., 2002 ). The C-terminal domain is required for activity, but because deletion of this domain prevents hexamerization, which is required for ATPase activity, its direct role is not revealed by such experiments. Studies with model substrates and effectors of the ATPase activity have suggested that the C-terminal domain is a substrate binding site ( Smith et al., 1999 ), but others conclude this domain modulates ATPase activity only ( Strub et al., 2003 ). The N-terminal domain, NBD1, and the coiled-coil domain have all also been proposed to be involved in substrate interactions ( Dougan et al., 2002 ; Liu et al., 2002 ; Weibezahn et al., 2003 ). However, the only data on binding of a natural substrate (TrfA to Escherichia coli ClpB) reveals an interaction only with the surface of NBD1 near the axial pore ( Schlieker et al., 2004 ). Lindquist and coworkers ( Cashikar et al., 2002 ; Hattendorf and Lindquist, 2002a ) proposed that in yeast Hsp104, stimulation of NBD2 activity drives a conformational change in the coiled-coil domain, which in turn stimulates ATPase activity in NBD1. Cross-linking studies with ClpB further suggest that movement of the coiled-coil domain is necessary for chaperone activity in vitro ( Lee et al., 2003 ). How these motions are connected to protein disaggregation remains to be defined. It has been suggested that ClpB has a crowbar action in protein disaggregation, perhaps mediated by the coiled-coil domain ( Vale, 2000 ; Maurizi and Xia, 2004 ; Weibezahn et al., 2004 ). Alternatively, or in addition, substrate unfolding may be coupled to threading through the axial channel of the ClpB hexamer in a mechanism related to that used by ClpA ( Ishikawa et al., 2001 ) and ClpX ( Kim et al., 2000b ) for protein unfolding and transfer to the ClpP protease. Recent experiments indicate mutations that affect protein loops in the axial channel eliminate yeast Hsp104 function in protein disaggregation, perhaps because of disruption of protein threading through the channel ( Lum et al., 2004 ).

We have taken a genetic approach to investigating the function and mechanism of Hsp100/ClpB in Arabidopsis. In previous work we showed that At Hsp101, encoded by the HOT1 gene, is a major component controlling acquired thermotolerance, based on the phenotypes of missense and protein null alleles, hot1-1 (E637K; in NBD2) and hot1-3 (a T-DNA insertion in exon 1), respectively ( Hong and Vierling, 2000 , 2001 ). Loss of At Hsp101 function, however, does not appear to have major effects on plant growth and development under optimal temperature conditions. To dissect further the mechanism of Hsp101 action in thermotolerance, we sought additional mutant alleles either by direct screening for mutants in a seedling thermotolerance assay ( Hong and Vierling, 2000 ) or by analysis of point mutations in At Hsp101 obtained through the Arabidopsis Tilling Resource ( http://tilling.fhcrc.org:9366 ). We describe four new mutant alleles of Hsp101 that provide insight into structure and function of this class of chaperone ATPase. One mutant allele, hot1-4 , which is a missense mutation in the coiled-coil domain (A499T) provides direct in vivo evidence for an essential function of this unique domain. Using this allele, we then screened for suppressor mutations and defined 13 intragenic suppressors. The location of these suppressor mutations defines features essential for in vivo activity of Hsp101 and provides in vivo evidence for a novel mechanistic link between the coiled-coil domain and the axial channel of Hsp100/ClpB proteins. Furthermore, certain suppressors restore the solubility of small heat shock proteins (sHsps) after heat stress in the hot1-4 mutant, providing genetic evidence for interaction of the Hsp100/ClpB and sHsp chaperone systems in higher plants.

DISCUSSION

We have been able to identify features critical to Hsp100/ClpB function in vivo using a sensitive, quantitative bioassay for thermotolerance. We identified four missense mutations in the Hsp100/ClpB protein, Arabidopsis At Hsp101, that compromise the function of At Hsp101 in thermotolerance, including an unusual allele, hot1-4 (A499T), which shows a semidominant, gain-of-function sensitivity to a mild, usually nonlethal heat stress. This mutation, which lies in the coiled-coil domain of At Hsp101, supports an essential role for this structural domain in Hsp100/ClpB action in vivo. We also suggest that the gain-of-function phenotype of hot1-4 is consistent with the interpretation that the mutation disrupts At Hsp101 activity such that a critical substrate or cofactor becomes limiting for the cell. Locations of the primary missense mutations hot1-5 , -6 , and -7 and of suppressors of hot1-4 define other features essential for in vivo function of At Hsp101 and point to protein domain interactions required for Hsp100/ClpB action. Finally, appearance of sHsps in the soluble cell fraction during recovery from heat stress does not occur in hot1-4 but is restored by strong suppressor mutants, in line with the model that disruption of protein aggregates is an essential At Hsp101 function in thermotolerance and supporting the model that sHsps and Hsp100/ClpB proteins interact in a chaperone network in the cell.

The coiled-coil domain of Hsp100/ClpB is unique to this class of AAA+ proteins ( Schirmer et al., 1996 ; Celerin et al., 1998 ). Although referred to alternatively as the linker, middle region, or spacer between AAA modules 1 and 2, it is actually an insertion into the C-terminal small domain of AAA module 1 ( Figures 1 and 8 ; see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Deletion of the coiled-coil domain from E. coli ClpB has shown that it is not essential for hexamerization or ATPase activity but is required for thermotolerance in vivo and for disaggregation of firefly luciferase in vitro ( Mogk et al., 2003b ). The structure of T. thermophilus ClpB reveals that this domain is formed by four helices (L1 to L4) that interact in two coiled-coil motifs comprised of α-helices L1 and L2, and L2 with L3/4 ( Figures 8 and 9 ). Both coiled-coils have features typical of Leu zippers. The hot1-4 mutation (A499T) lies in helix L3, within the conserved sequence segment 494YDLAR A ADL502 (484YDLNRAAEL492, in T. thermophilus ) ( Figures 8A and 8B ). This sequence motif was previously identified by Schirmer et al. (1996) as characteristic of Hsp100/ClpB chaperones. The weak mutation hot1-6 (E509K) lies in the coiled-coil domain directly outside this conserved motif ( Figure 8B ). Neither the hot1-4 nor hot1-6 residues are predicted to contact residues in neighboring subunits, which along with the normal accumulation of the proteins and the similar solubility of hot1-4 to the wild type, suggest that these mutations do not significantly disrupt the hexamer structure. In vitro cross-linking experiments also produce the same large, presumably oligomer forms of At Hsp101 in the wild type and the hot1-4 mutants (U. Lee, unpublished data). Eight other mutations in this domain have no effect on At Hsp101 function ( Figure 1 ). Altogether, the hot1-4 and hot1-6 mutations provide direct genetic evidence for the importance of helix L3 and the coiled-coil domain in At Hsp101 function.

Interestingly, in a screen for mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp104, Schirmer et al. (2004) recently reported isolation of a mutation in the same motif, at the adjacent Ala residue (A503V; 497YDTATA A DL505 in S. cerevisiae ). The Hsp104 A503V mutant was an active ATPase in vitro ( Cashikar et al., 2002 ), exhibiting actually an approximately twofold increase in basal ATPase activity (i.e., activity in the absence of substrate). Therefore, the A503V mutation cannot disrupt the hexameric structure, which is required for ATPase activity. This observation further supports our interpretation that the hot1-4 mutant protein retains its hexameric structure. Furthermore, like hot1-4 , the Hsp104 A503V mutation also exhibits a gain-of-function phenotype, leading to cell lethality when induced at the normally permissive temperature of 37°C ( Schirmer et al., 2004 ). The similarity of phenotype of these At Hsp101 and yeast Hsp104 mutations, along with the ability of At Hsp101 to support thermotolerance in yeast ( Schirmer et al., 1994 ), argue that these proteins are true functional homologs.

The other mutations studied also provide new information about interactions within the Hsp100/ClpB proteins. The strong hot1-5 allele alters a residue (R706K) that is conserved in E. coli (R705) and T. thermophilus (R695), and which is in a loop between β-strands 4 and 5 in NBD2, positioned away from the active site ( Figures 8A and 8C ; see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Normal accumulation and solubility of the hot1-5 protein argues that the protein is not significantly compromised structurally. Based on the T. thermophilus structure, this Arg residue makes intramolecular contact with three other residues conserved in Arabidopsis and E. coli , including a Leu residue directly adjacent to sensor 1 in NBD1, and has side chain interactions with conserved Glu and Arg residues in NBD2 helix D7 ( Figure 8C ). Notably, a Lys residue is present at the hot1-5 position in yeast Hsp104, and correspondingly the predicted interacting residues are different. The unique importance of hot1-5 interactions, as opposed to variation in the loop itself, is also indirectly supported by the absence of a phenotype for another mutation in the loop connecting β-strands 4 and 5, G703E ( Figures 1 and 8C ). Hattendorf and Lindquist (2002a) have proposed that ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 depends on the nucleotide bound at NBD2 in yeast Hsp104. We speculate that hot1-5 is in a position involved in communicating nucleotide status between NBD2 and NBD1 and note that the distance between the hot1-5 Arg residue and the conserved Leu in NBD1 varies in the three ClpB molecules in the crystal structure, consistent with a dynamic interaction.

It is difficult to define the possible effects of some of the other At Hsp101 mutations. The hot1-7 mutation represents a dramatic change (G815D) in a conserved motif (GAR) that includes the sensor 2 Arg residue already recognized as important for function ( Figure 8D ). The residues in the sensor 2 motif are in contact with nucleotides, and the Arg residue in yeast Hsp104 is proposed to contribute binding energy, but not discrimination between ATP and ADP ( Hattendorf and Lindquist, 2002a ). Mutations in sensor 2, or of all three residues of the GAR motif, do not severely disrupt hexamerization or ATPase activity, but prevent ability to dissociate protein aggregates ( Hattendorf and Lindquist, 2002b ; Mogk et al., 2003b ). In vivo, the moderate phenotype of hot1-7 is consistent with a moderate defect in thermotolerance observed for an R to M mutation of sensor 2 in yeast ( Hattendorf and Lindquist, 2002b ). The absence of phenotype for 35 other missense mutations analyzed is not surprising, given that many lie in nonconserved residues or represent conservative changes ( Figure 1 ; see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Perhaps the most surprising of the aphenotypic mutations is P671L, which represents a Pro residue conserved not only in NBD2 of all ClpB proteins, but also found in ClpA.

The unusual sensitivity of the hot1-4 allele to 38°C, which is otherwise permissive for wild-type and At Hsp101 null plants, led us to focus further on analysis of this mutation. We performed a screen that identified both loss-of-function (Class 1) and restoration-of-function (Class 2) intragenic suppressor mutations in At Hsp101. Genetic dissection of Hsp100/ClpB function by intragenic suppressor analysis has not been performed in any organism, and we are also unaware of any previous studies using intragenic suppressors for dissection of protein mechanism in higher plants. We argue that the seven Class 1 mutations that eliminated the 38°C heat sensitivity of hot1-4 , but did not restore the acquired thermotolerance function, represent loss-of-function At Hsp101 mutants. Consistent with this interpretation, one of these suppressors is in the Walker A motif of NBD 2 (G611D), and three others are predicted to affect the nucleotide binding pocket (E319K, P388S, and A723V) ( Figure 9 ), which should result in defective hexamerization or ATP hydrolysis as demonstrated in vitro for other Hsp100/ClpB proteins ( Kim et al., 2000a ; Watanabe et al., 2002 ; Mogk et al., 2003b ). These findings suggest that in hot1-4 , At Hsp101 retains normal ATP hydrolysis activity and hexamerization and indicates that these properties are essential for the dominant-negative effect of this allele. Two other Class 1 suppressors, G384S and V813M, are both located between the second and third helices in the C-terminal subdomain of NBD1 and NBD2, respectively ( Figure 9 ; see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Both of these mutations lead to accumulation of a truncated At Hsp101 protein with sizes that predict that in vivo cleavage occurs in close proximity to the mutation. Proteolytic removal of the C terminus in V813M supports the requirement of this domain for function, which as stated before, may involve not only hexamerization, but also effector binding ( Smith et al., 1999 ; Strub et al., 2003 ). Although our screen was not performed to saturation, it is notable that no loss-of-function suppressors were obtained in the N-terminal domain, which has also not been associated with an essential function in other organisms ( Clarke and Eriksson, 2000 ; Beinker et al., 2002 ; Mogk et al., 2003b ).

Whereas the coiled-coil domain is clearly essential for Hsp100/ClpB function, its role in the catalytic cycle is not known. The position of hot1-4 (A499T) (and A503V in S. cerevisiae Hsp104) suggests that this mutation could disrupt interactions of L3 with L2 within a subunit. Lee et al. (2003) have proposed that motion of the coiled-coil domain is required for Hsp100/ClpB chaperone activity. They introduced Cys residues into T. thermophilus ClpB to effect cross-linking of the L2/L3-4 coiled-coil (in which hot1-4 is located) to NBD1 and observed in vitro that ATP hydrolysis continued, but the protein disaggregation activity of ClpB was lost. The three hot1-4 suppressors that restore >43% of acquired thermotolerance of hypocotyl growth and also restore acquired thermotolerance of 10-d-old seedlings are all located in NBD1 (R223K, A297T, and A329V). The strongest of these, A329V, has >70% wild-type activity in the hypocotyl assay and restores solubility of sHsps during recovery from heat stress. Interestingly, A329V lies in close proximity to the NBD1 Arg finger, which is believed to interact with the nucleotide in an adjacent subunit ( Figure 9 ). Another weak suppressor, G313D, is also in NBD1 ( Figure 9 ). Taken together, the location of the Class 2 restoration-of-function suppressors of hot1-4 is consistent with the interpretation that dynamic interaction of the coiled-coil domain with NBD1 is indeed essential in vivo.

How Hsp100/ClpB proteins act to disaggregate proteins has been proposed to involve a crowbar action of the coiled-coil domain and/or threading of substrate through the axial channel of the hexamer, analogous to the mechanism of other hexameric ATPases ( Lee et al., 2003 ; Lum et al., 2004 ; Schlieker et al., 2004 ). Location of the Class 2 suppressors provides potential support for the latter mechanism. The strong suppressor A297V is located in a presumably flexible, disordered segment that was not resolved in the Tt ClpB structure, but which is in the axial channel region. A329V, another strong suppressor, is positioned to potentially alter interactions with another unresolved axial channel loop ( Tt ClpB residues 234 to 246; corresponding to 243 to 255 in At Hsp101), which has recently been proposed to contain residues that bind the E. coli ClpB substrate TrfA ( Schlieker et al., 2004 ). The only restoration-of-function suppressors outside NBD1 are the two weak suppressors, G649E and G653E in NBD 2, which also lie in an unresolved axial channel loop ( Tt ClpB residues 638 to 650; corresponding to At Hsp101 648 to 660) ( Figure 9 ; see Supplemental Figure 1 online). This loop contains the conserved motif GYVG found in other AAA+ proteins (with the first G corresponding to G653 in At Hsp101). Mutation of the Tyr residue in this loop impairs function of E. coli ClpX ( Siddiqui et al., 2004 ) and HslU ( Wang et al., 2001b ). Structural studies also indicate that this loop gates the axial channel of HslU during the ATPase cycle ( Wang et al., 2001a ). Recent experiments with yeast Hsp104 also support an essential role for this loop in the protein disaggregation reaction ( Lum et al., 2004 ). In total, we suggest that these intragenic suppressors point to a model in which motions of the coiled-coil domain modulate the ATPase activity of NBD1 and the position of axial channel loops in At Hsp101, which may be involved in threading of substrate through the axial channel.

Analysis of the solubility of plant cytosolic sHsps in the hot1-4 mutant and the strong suppressors also provides data to link these two chaperone systems in a eukaryote. Genetic interactions of sHsps and ClpB have been reported in both E. coli and Synechocystis ( Giese and Vierling, 2002 ; Mogk et al., 2003a ) and are supported by in vitro analysis of E. coli ClpB activity in combination with E. coli , Synechocystis, and plant cytosolic class I sHsps ( Mogk et al., 2003c ). The current model for sHsp function proposes that sHsps bind and maintain denaturing proteins in a form that is accessible to ATP-dependent refolding chaperones. Furthermore, their presence in large protein aggregates makes these aggregates better substrates for the action of Hsp100/ClpB ( Mogk et al., 2003c ). However, although Hsp100/ClpB disaggregates sHsp containing complexes, there is no evidence for direct physical interaction of Hsp100/ClpB with sHsps ( Mogk et al., 2003a , 2003c ), and we did not observe association of At Hsp101 with sHsps in the insoluble protein fraction of the cell. In total, the data here indicate that the plant cytosolic Class II, as well as cytosolic Class I sHsps, which diverged on the order of 400 million years ago ( Waters and Vierling, 1999 ), may both facilitate protein disaggregation by Hsp100/ClpB in plants.

At which step the hot1-4 mutation affects catalysis will require additional biochemical studies. It does not appear that the dominant-negative phenotype of hot1-4 is attributable to unregulated ATPase activity of the mutant At Hsp101 protein, leading to depletion of cellular ATP. Measurement of ATP levels in the wild type, hot1-3 , and hot1-4 showed no significant differences in ATP levels between the genotypes during heat stress or recovery (U. Lee and E. Vierling, unpublished data). One possibility is that the mutation traps At Hsp101 in a nonfunctional protein complex such that another critical cofactor or substrate becomes limiting for the cell. Such a complex must still be soluble, as our analysis does not indicate that a significant fraction of At Hsp101 becomes insoluble at 38°C where the hot1-4 phenotype is still severe. The Class 1 suppressors that eliminate the dominant-negative phenotype are predicted to disrupt the basic hexameric structure and ATPase activity, consistent with the requirement of these activities to form a trapped complex. By altering structural interactions of the coiled-coil domain with NBD1, the strong Class 2 suppressors may eliminate this trapped intermediate. Weaker Class 2 suppressors may affect the protein's conformation, but not enough to fully disrupt the formation of the nonfunctional complex between hot1-4 and its bound protein(s). Another possibility is that the suppressors directly or indirectly alter a binding site for substrate or functional partner protein, such that a nonfunctional complex no longer forms, but sufficient substrate or cofactor interactions are retained for partial function in vivo. Attempts to coimmunoprecipitate hot1-4 in complex with other proteins has not been successful. Biochemical characterization of hot1-4 along with identity of extragenic suppressors should provide further insight into the nature of the hot1-4 defect and the mechanism of Hsp100/ClpB action.
