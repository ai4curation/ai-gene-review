The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) family of transcription factors plays a 
seminal role in inflammation, apoptosis, development, and cancer. Modulation of 
NF-kappaB-mediated gene expression in response to diverse signals is coordinated 
by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex. We identified ELKS, an essential regulatory 
subunit of the IKK complex. Silencing ELKS expression by RNA interference 
blocked induced expression of NF-kappaB target genes, including the NF-kappaB 
inhibitor IkappaBalpha and proinflammatory genes such as cyclo-oxygenase 2 and 
interleukin 8. These cells were also not protected from apoptosis in response to 
cytokines. ELKS likely functions by recruiting IkappaBalpha to the IKK complex 
and thus serves a regulatory function for IKK activation.
