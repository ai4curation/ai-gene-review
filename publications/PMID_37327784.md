The intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) constitute the primary barrier between 
host cells and numerous foreign antigens; it is unclear how IECs induce the 
protective immunity against pathogens while maintaining the immune tolerance to 
food. Here, we found IECs accumulate a less recognized 13-kD N-terminal fragment 
of GSDMD that is cleaved by caspase-3/7 in response to dietary antigens. Unlike 
the 30-kD GSDMD cleavage fragment that executes pyroptosis, the IEC-accumulated 
GSDMD cleavage fragment translocates to the nucleus and induces the 
transcription of CIITA and MHCII molecules, which in turn induces the Tr1 cells 
in upper small intestine. Mice treated with a caspase-3/7 inhibitor, mice with 
GSDMD mutation resistant to caspase-3/7 cleavage, mice with MHCII deficiency in 
IECs, and mice with Tr1 deficiency all displayed a disrupted food tolerance 
phenotype. Our study supports that differential cleavage of GSDMD can be 
understood as a regulatory hub controlling immunity versus tolerance in the 
small intestine.

Conflict of interest statement: Declaration of interests S.Z. is a cofounder of 
Ibiome which studies microbial regulation of immune responses. R.A.F. is a 
cofounder of Ventus, which studies inflammatory pathways. Both in topics 
unrelated to the subject of this work.
