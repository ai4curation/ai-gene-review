Casein kinase II (CK2) is a protein kinase with an evolutionarily conserved 
function as a circadian clock component in several organisms, including the 
long-day plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The circadian clock component 
CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) is a CK2 target in Arabidopsis, where it 
influences photoperiodic flowering. In rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant, 
Heading date6 (Hd6) encodes a CK2alpha subunit that delays flowering time under 
long-day conditions. Here, we demonstrate that control of flowering time in rice 
by the Hd6 CK2alpha subunit requires a functional Hd1 gene (an Arabidopsis 
CONSTANS ortholog) and is independent of the circadian clock mechanism. Our 
findings from overexpressing the dominant-negative CK2 allele in rice support 
the independence of CK2 function from the circadian clock. This lack of control 
of the circadian clock by Hd6 CK2alpha might be due to the presence of glutamate 
in OsLHY (a CCA1 ortholog in rice) instead of the serine at the corresponding 
CK2 target site in CCA1. However, this glutamate is critical for the control of 
the OsPRR1 gene (a rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis TOC1/PRR1 gene) by OsLHY for 
regulation of the circadian clock. We also demonstrated that the other conserved 
CK2 target sites in OsLHY conferred robust rhythmic expression of OsLHY-LUC 
under diurnal conditions. These findings imply that the role of CK2 in 
flowering-time regulation in higher plants has diversified during evolution.

Abstract

Casein kinase II (CK2) is a protein kinase with an evolutionarily conserved function as a circadian clock component in several organisms, including the long-day plant Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ). The circadian clock component CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 ( CCA1 ) is a CK2 target in Arabidopsis, where it influences photoperiodic flowering. In rice ( Oryza sativa ), a short-day plant, Heading date6 ( Hd6 ) encodes a CK2 α subunit that delays flowering time under long-day conditions. Here, we demonstrate that control of flowering time in rice by the Hd6 CK2 α subunit requires a functional Hd1 gene (an Arabidopsis CONSTANS ortholog) and is independent of the circadian clock mechanism. Our findings from overexpressing the dominant-negative CK2 allele in rice support the independence of CK2 function from the circadian clock. This lack of control of the circadian clock by Hd6 CK2 α might be due to the presence of glutamate in OsLHY (a CCA1 ortholog in rice) instead of the serine at the corresponding CK2 target site in CCA1. However, this glutamate is critical for the control of the OsPRR1 gene (a rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis TOC1/PRR1 gene) by OsLHY for regulation of the circadian clock. We also demonstrated that the other conserved CK2 target sites in OsLHY conferred robust rhythmic expression of OsLHY-LUC under diurnal conditions. These findings imply that the role of CK2 in flowering-time regulation in higher plants has diversified during evolution.

DISCUSSION

Using rice NILs and lines overexpressing Hd6 , we demonstrated here that flowering-time control by the previously identified quantitative trait locus, Hd6 , in rice requires a functional Hd1 gene (an Arabidopsis CONSTANS ortholog) but does not occur through circadian clock action ( Figs. 1 and 2 ; Supplemental Figs. S2 and S4). Because the Hd6 gene is a member of the CK2 α subfamily and is one of two major expressed CK2 α subunits (Supplemental Fig. S7), transgenic lines overexpressing a dominant-negative CK2 α were further examined to evaluate the role of CK2 in the circadian clock in the photoperiodic control of flowering in rice. Because CK2 activity was not completely absent in these dominant-negative lines ( Fig. 3 ), we were able to conclude that circadian clock activity was disconnected from the control of flowering time by Hd6 but not from all CK2 activity. However, we confirmed that the circadian clock in rice was less affected by a reduction in CK2 activity than was flowering-time control ( Figs. 3 and 4 ). We did not identify the target protein that could be phosphorylated by Hd6 CK2 α to control flowering time. Our genetic analysis, however, strongly suggested that any protein that could work together with Hd1 might be a target. Recently, the Ghd7 gene was reported to be a strong repressor of rice flowering ( Xue et al., 2008 ). We found that Hd6 did not phosphorylate either Hd1 or Ghd7 protein in vitro (Supplemental Fig. S6; data not shown). In addition, our preliminary data revealed that some protein associated with Hd1 in vitro could be an Hd6 target for the control of Hd1 repressor activity (data not shown). We are now attempting to identify this Hd6 target.

Although there is no genetic evidence of a role for OsLHY in the circadian clock in rice, we demonstrated here that overexpression of tagged OsLHY repressed the rhythmic expression of OsPRR1 : LUC in rice cells ( Fig. 8C ). This result strongly suggested that OsLHY is a core component of the circadian clock in rice and was consistent with the concept of OsLHY as a sole ortholog of Arabidopsis CCA1/LHY in the rice genome. Notably, we tried a simple way of making transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsLHY cDNA (without the tag) driven by both CaMV 35S and a maize ubiquitin promoter, but we were not able to obtain any rice plants overexpressing OsLHY mRNA (data not shown). In addition, we succeeded in overexpressing the OsLHY-LUC gene in rice cells ( Fig. 9 ), but no associated phenotypes were observed. We obtained circadian clock-related phenotypes associated with the repression of OsPRR1 : LUC rhythmic expression, but only when we overexpressed the tagged OsLHY . Unlike with LHY/CCA1 , the simple overexpression of which disturbs the circadian clock in Arabidopsis ( Schaffer et al., 1998 ; Wang and Tobin, 1998 ), in the case of OsLHY its function may be too critical in rice to obtain a simple overexpresser.

We next revealed that OsLHY could not form a homodimer in yeast, whereas CCA1 could do so through the C4 domain (Ser-484 site), one of the previously identified CK2 phosphorylation sites ( Daniel et al., 2004 ; Fig. 8A ; data not shown). This finding is consistent with that of a previous report in Arabidopsis ( Daniel et al., 2004 ). By comparison, the corresponding site (Glu-600) in OsLHY in rice was critical for repression of the rhythmic expression of OsPRR1 . In Arabidopsis, the findings that lines overexpressing CKB3 and CKB4 have circadian clocks with short free-running periods and show early flowering under SD conditions indicate that CK2 can control the circadian clock and flowering time in this species and that this control is mediated by CCA1 phosphorylation ( Sugano et al., 1999 ; Daniel et al., 2004 ). CCA1 and LHY function as TOC1/PRR1 repressors ( Mizuno and Nakamichi, 2005 ). These actions form a negative feedback loop in the circadian clock of Arabidopsis ( Alabadi et al., 2001 ; Mizuno and Nakamichi, 2005 ). As expected, OsLHY expression is likely to be regulated by the circadian clock ( Izawa et al., 2002 ). Because CCA1 phosphorylation is necessary for CCA1 homodimerization and normal clock function, OsLHY phosphorylation is likely to be important for rice circadian clock function. In fact, OsLHY was phosphorylated by Hd6, and the phosphorylation sites were conserved, with one exception ( Figs. 6 and 7 ; Supplemental Table S3). However, NIL( Hd6 ) lines, Hd6- overexpressing lines, and dominant-negative lines had little effect on the rice circadian clock ( Figs. 2 and 4 ). Only one unconserved site, OsLHY Glu-600, corresponding to CCA1 Ser-484, was present in a highly conserved motif, termed the C4 domain in land plants ( Fig. 7 ). CCA1 Ser-484 is necessary for homodimerization ( Fig. 8A ). In addition, mOsLHY E600A overexpression did not repress OsPRR1 : LUC in rice calli, whereas OsLHY overexpression did ( Fig. 8, B and C ; data not shown). These results indicate that this Glu site in the C4 domain was critical for OsLHY function related to the circadian clock. They also strongly suggest that the change from Ser to Glu at the Glu-600 site in OsLHY is a critical cause of the disconnection of Hd6 from rice circadian clock regulation. During plant evolution, CCA1 may have acquired the capacity for Ser-484 phosphorylation, which may then have led to dimer formation for fine regulation of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis. The inability of OsLHY to form homodimers ( Fig. 8A ) suggests that OsLHY has a role in regulation of the circadian clock system in rice and that this role is distinct from that of CCA1 found in Arabidopsis.

Interestingly, of the other five Ser sites phosphorylated in vitro by rHd6, those corresponding to CCA1 sites might be involved in the light-dependent protein stability of an OsLHY-LUC fusion protein ( Fig. 9 ), although the molecular nature of the rhythms of OsLHY-LUC has not been confirmed. This result for OsLHY-LUC suggests that OsLHY activity under daily light/dark cycles is controlled by phosphorylation by CK2 (or other kinases) and that control of this nature, through the sites of phosphorylation of OsLHY, is clearly distinct from the control provided by the Glu-600 site of OsLHY for circadian clock oscillation in rice, which confers rhythmic gene expression under constant light or dark conditions. The molecular nature of light-regulated translation of LHY protein has also been reported in Arabidopsis ( Kim et al., 2003 ). Therefore, the regulation of protein stability by light in LHY and OsLHY is likely to be conserved among plant species through phosphorylation of the five conserved amino acids by CK2. The control of light-dependent protein stability ( Kim et al., 2003 ) by the phosphorylation Ser sites in OsLHY implies that the robustness of diurnal rhythmic expression of OsLHY is an evolutionarily conserved function. The contribution of CK2 to circadian clock regulation under constant light or dark conditions might be a recently developed function of CK2 observed in Arabidopsis. The finding that Glu was a major amino acid at Glu-600 in OsLHY (corresponding to Ser-484 in CCA1) strongly supports this idea. These findings might shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of circadian clock systems and photoperiodic flowering during plant evolution, since Arabidopsis and rice are believed to have diverged about 200 million years ago ( Fig. 10 ).
