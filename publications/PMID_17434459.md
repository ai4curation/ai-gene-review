The causes of spinal cord cell loss in motor neuron disorders such as 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are currently unknown. A role can be 
postulated for the transcription factor p53, which can induce apoptosis via 
upregulation of proapoptotic genes (e.g., Bax) and inhibition of antiapoptotic 
genes (e.g., Bcl-2). A model of motor neuron loss is the wobbler mouse that 
exhibits rapid motor neuron cell death as well as motor deficit from 21 days 
after birth. Affymetrix microarray data from wobbler mice demonstrate a 2.2-fold 
increase in p53 signal compared with their normal littermates, whereas qRT-PCR 
of RNA from laser capture microdissected ventral horns of normal and wobbler 
mice reveals a larger 6.6-fold increase in gene expression and this was 
supported by western blotting. Human ventral horns obtained from ALS and 
age-matched normal spinal cords also demonstrated an increase (2.7-fold) in p53 
expression as determined by qRT-PCR. Evidence of a causative role for p53 in 
spinal cord cell death was provided by use of a p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-alpha, 
in organotypic slice cultures of mouse spinal cord. A 24-h pretreatment with 
pifithrin-alpha (and continuing in the presence of insult), significantly 
reduced the toxicity of a 48-h treatment with FeSO(4), tested with the MTT 
viability assay. These results indicate that p53 plays a functional role in 
oxidative stress-induced cell death and supports the possibility that elevated 
p53 could be involved in motor neuron death in ALS and the wobbler mouse.
