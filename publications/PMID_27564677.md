The Kv7 (KCNQ) channel family, comprising voltage-gated potassium channels, 
plays major roles in fine-tuning cellular excitability by reducing firing 
frequency and controlling repolarization. Kv7 channels have a unique 
intracellular C-terminal (CT) domain bound constitutively by calmodulin (CaM). 
This domain plays key functions in channel tetramerization, trafficking, and 
gating. CaM binds to the proximal CT, comprising helices A and B. Kv7.2 and 
Kv7.3 are expressed in neural tissues. Together, they form the heterotetrameric 
M channel. We characterized Kv7.2, Kv7.3, and chimeric Kv7.3 helix A-Kv7.2 helix 
B (Q3A-Q2B) proximal CT/CaM complexes by solution methods at various 
Ca(2+)concentrations and determined them all to have a 1:1 stoichiometry. We 
then determined the crystal structure of the Q3A-Q2B/CaM complex at high Ca(2+) 
concentration to 2.0 Å resolution. CaM hugs the antiparallel coiled coil of 
helices A and B, braced together by an additional helix. The structure displays 
a hybrid apo-Ca(2+) CaM conformation even though four Ca(2+) ions are bound. Our 
results pinpoint unique interactions enabling the possible intersubunit pairing 
of Kv7.3 helix A and Kv7.2 helix B while underlining the potential importance of 
Kv7.3 helix A's role in stabilizing channel oligomerization. Also, the structure 
can be used to rationalize various channelopathic mutants. Functional testing of 
the chimeric channel found it to have a voltage-dependence similar to the M 
channel, thereby demonstrating helix A's importance in imparting gating 
properties.
