Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) involves cleavage of a transmembrane 
segment of a protein. RIP governs diverse processes in a wide variety of 
organisms and is carried out by different types of intramembrane proteases 
(IPs), including a large family of metalloproteases. The Bacillus subtilis 
SpoIVFB protein is a putative metalloprotease that cleaves membrane-tethered 
Pro-sigma(K), releasing sigma(K) to direct transcription of genes necessary for 
spore formation. By attaching an extra transmembrane segment to the N terminus 
of SpoIVFB, expression in E. coli was improved more than 100-fold, facilitating 
purification and demonstration of metalloprotease activity, which accurately 
cleaved purified Pro-sigma(K). Uniquely for IPs examined so far, SpoIVFB 
activity requires ATP, which binds to the C-terminal cystathionine-beta-synthase 
(CBS) domain of SpoIVFB. Deleting just 10 residues from the C-terminal end of 
SpoIVFB nearly eliminated cleavage of coexpressed Pro-sigma(K) in E. coli. The 
CBS domain of SpoIVFB was shown to interact with Pro-sigma(K) and ATP changed 
the interaction, suggesting that ATP regulates substrate access to the active 
site and renders cleavage sensitive to the cellular energy level, which may be a 
general feature of CBS-domain-containing IPs. Incorporation of SpoIVFB into 
preformed liposomes stimulated its ability to cleave Pro-sigma(K). Cleavage 
depended on ATP and the correct peptide bond was shown to be cleaved using a 
rapid and sensitive mass spectrometry assay. A system for biochemical studies of 
RIP by a metalloprotease in a membrane environment has been established using 
methods that might be applicable to other IPs.
