The maintenance of chromosome termini, or telomeres, requires the action of the 
enzyme telomerase, as conventional DNA polymerases cannot fully replicate the 
ends of linear molecules. Telomerase is expressed and telomere length is 
maintained in human germ cells and the great majority of primary human tumours. 
However, telomerase is not detectable in most normal somatic cells; this 
corresponds to the gradual telomere loss observed with each cell division. It 
has been proposed that telomere erosion eventually signals entry into senescence 
or cell crisis and that activation of telomerase is usually required for 
immortal cell proliferation. In addition to the human telomerase RNA component 
(hTR; ref. 11), TR1/TLP1 (refs 12, 13), a protein that is homologous to the p80 
protein associated with the Tetrahymena enzyme, has been identified in humans. 
More recently, the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTRT; refs 15, 16), 
which is homologous to the reverse transcriptase (RT)-like proteins associated 
with the Euplotes aediculatus (Ea_p123), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Est2p) and 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe (5pTrt1) telomerases, has been reported to be a 
telomerase protein subunit. A catalytic function has been demonstrated for Est2p 
in the RT-like class but not for p80 or its homologues. We now report that in 
vitro transcription and translation of hTRT when co-synthesized or mixed with 
hTR reconstitutes telomerase activity that exhibits enzymatic properties like 
those of the native enzyme. Single amino-acid changes in conserved 
telomerase-specific and RT motifs reduce or abolish activity, providing direct 
evidence that hTRT is the catalytic protein component of telomerase. Normal 
human diploid cells transiently expressing hTRT possessed telomerase activity, 
demonstrating that hTRT is the limiting component necessary for restoration of 
telomerase activity in these cells. The ability to reconstitute telomerase 
permits further analysis of its biochemical and biological roles in cell aging 
and carcinogenesis.
