Cullin proteins assemble a large number of RING E3 ubiquitin ligases and 
regulate various physiological processes. Covalent modification of cullins by 
the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 activates cullin ligases through an as yet 
undefined mechanism. We show here that p120(CAND1) selectively binds to 
unneddylated CUL1 and is dissociated by CUL1 neddylation. CAND1 formed a ternary 
complex with CUL1 and ROC1. CAND1 dissociated SKP1 from CUL1 and inhibited SCF 
ligase activity in vitro. Suppression of CAND1 in vivo increased the level of 
the CUL1-SKP1 complex. We suggest that by restricting SKP1-CUL1 interaction, 
CAND1 regulated the assembly of productive SCF ubiquitin ligases, allowing a 
common CUL1-ROC core to be utilized by a large number of SKP1-F box-substrate 
subcomplexes.
