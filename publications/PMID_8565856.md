Self perpetuation of the shoot meristem is essential for the repetitive 
initiation of shoot structures during plant development. In Arabidopsis shoot 
meristem maintenance is disrupted by recessive mutations in the WUSCHEL (WUS) 
gene. The defect is evident at all developmental stages and is restricted to 
shoot and floral meristems, whereas the root meristem is not affected. wus 
mutants fail to properly organize a shoot meristem in the embryo. 
Postembryonically, defective shoot meristems are initiated repetitively but 
terminate prematurely in aberrant flat structures. In contrast to wild-type 
shoot meristems, primordia initiation occurs ectopically across mutant apices, 
including the center, and often new shoot meristems instead of organs are 
initiated. The cells of wus shoot apices are larger and more vacuolated than 
wild-type shoot meristem cells. wus floral meristems terminate prematurely in a 
central stamen. Double mutant studies indicate that the number of organ 
primordia in the center of wus flowers is limited, irrespective of organ 
identity and we propose that meristem cells are allocated into floral whorl 
domains in a sequential manner. WUS activity also appears to be required for the 
formation of supernumerary organs in the center of agamous, superman or clavata1 
flowers, suggesting that the WUS gene acts upstream of the corresponding genes. 
Our results suggest that the WUS gene is specifically required for central 
meristem identity of shoot and floral meristems to maintain their structural and 
functional integrity.
