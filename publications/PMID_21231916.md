Humans contain many HSP (heat-shock protein) 70/HSPA- and HSP40/DNAJ-encoding 
genes and most of the corresponding proteins are localized in the cytosol. To 
test for possible functional differences and/or substrate specificity, we 
assessed the effect of overexpression of each of these HSPs on refolding of 
heat-denatured luciferase and on the suppression of aggregation of a 
non-foldable polyQ (polyglutamine)-expanded Huntingtin fragment. Overexpressed 
chaperones that suppressed polyQ aggregation were found not to be able to 
stimulate luciferase refolding. Inversely, chaperones that supported luciferase 
refolding were poor suppressors of polyQ aggregation. This was not related to 
client specificity itself, as the polyQ aggregation inhibitors often also 
suppressed heat-induced aggregation of luciferase. Surprisingly, the exclusively 
heat-inducible HSPA6 lacks both luciferase refolding and polyQ 
aggregation-suppressing activities. Furthermore, whereas overexpression of 
HSPA1A protected cells from heat-induced cell death, overexpression of HSPA6 did 
not. Inversely, siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated blocking of HSPA6 did not 
impair the development of heat-induced thermotolerance. Yet, HSPA6 has a 
functional substrate-binding domain and possesses intrinsic ATPase activity that 
is as high as that of the canonical HSPA1A when stimulated by J-proteins. In 
vitro data suggest that this may be relevant to substrate specificity, as 
purified HSPA6 could not chaperone heat-unfolded luciferase but was able to 
assist in reactivation of heat-unfolded p53. So, even within the highly 
sequence-conserved HSPA family, functional differentiation is larger than 
expected, with HSPA6 being an extreme example that may have evolved to maintain 
specific critical functions under conditions of severe stress.
