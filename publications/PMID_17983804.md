BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Wnt signaling pathway is activated constitutively in the 
majority of colorectal cancers as a result of mutation in either the adenomatous 
polyposis coli or the CTNNB1 gene, and blockage of the pathway has been 
considered feasible as molecular therapy against colorectal cancer. DNA 
topoisomerase IIalpha (Topo IIalpha) is a component of the beta-catenin/T-cell 
factor-4 (TCF-4) nuclear complex. We examined the functional significance of 
Topo IIalpha in Wnt signaling.
METHODS: The physical and functional interaction between Topo IIalpha and the 
beta-catenin/TCF-4 nuclear complex was evaluated by immunoprecipitation, 
immunofluorescence microscopy, 2-hybrid assay, and luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: Amino acids 951-1301 of Topo IIalpha were necessary for binding to 
beta-catenin. Over expression of Topo IIalpha enhanced the TCF/lymphoid enhancer 
factor transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner, and knockdown of 
Topo IIalpha by RNA interference conversely attenuated the transcriptional 
activity. The Topo II inhibitors, merbarone and etoposide, suppressed the 
beta-catenin-mediated TCF/lymphoid enhancer factor transcriptional activity. The 
catalytic activity of Topo II was augmented by overexpression of beta-catenin as 
measured by the decatenation of kinetoplast DNA. Topo IIalpha was highly 
expressed and colocalized with beta-catenin in tumor cells of patients with 
familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome and patients with sporadic colorectal 
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Topo IIalpha interacts with beta-catenin as a novel transcriptional 
co-activator. A new drug targeting the interaction of Topo IIalpha with 
beta-catenin as well as its catalytic activity might be more effective for 
suppressing aberrant Wnt signaling and proliferation of colorectal cancer cells 
than the current Topo II inhibitors.
