The glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX complex on the surface of human platelets functions 
as the von Willebrand factor receptor and mediates von Willebrand 
factor-dependent platelet adhesion to blood vessels. GPIX is a relatively small 
(Mr, 17,000) protein that may provide for membrane insertion and orientation of 
the larger component of the complex, GPIb (Mr, 165,000). Using antibody 
screening, we cloned a cDNA encoding GPIX from a human erythroleukemia cell cDNA 
library constructed in phage lambda gt11. Lacking a 5' untranslated region and 
start codon, the cDNA sequence includes 604 nucleotides, beginning with 495 
bases at the 5' end coding for 165 amino acids, followed by a stop codon and 106 
noncoding bases at the 3' end. By Northern blot analysis, the GPIX cDNA 
hybridizes with a single 1.0-kilobase species of platelet poly(A)+ RNA. 
Translation of the cDNA sequence gives a predicted protein sequence beginning 
with a truncated putative signal sequence of 5 amino acid followed by a sequence 
of 17 amino acids matching that determined directly by Edman degradation of 
intact GPIX. The predicted amino acid sequence of mature GPIX includes an 
NH2-terminal extracytoplasmic domain of 134 residues, a transmembrane domain of 
20 residues, 6 intracytoplasmic residues, and 1 N-linked glycosylation site. 
GPIX contains a leucine-rich glycoprotein (LRG) sequence of 24 amino acids 
similar to conserved LRG sequences in GPIb and other proteins from humans, 
Drosophila, and yeast. "Flanking" sequences of approximately 22 amino acids are 
present at the NH2 and/or COOH sides of the "central" LRG sequence(s) in GPIX, 
GPIb, and the other human and Drosophila members of the LRG family. The role of 
the flank-LRG center-flank structure in the evolution and function of the LRG 
proteins remains to be defined.
