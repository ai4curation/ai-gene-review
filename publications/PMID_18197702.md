Abstract

Genetic studies have demonstrated an important role for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) as a determinant of plasma cholesterol levels. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not completely understood. To this end, we have generated a mammalian cell expression system for human PCSK9 and its mutants and produced transgenic mice expressing human PCSK9. HEK293T cells transfected with the human PCSK9 DNA construct expressed and secreted PCSK9 and displayed decreased LDLR levels; functional PCSK9 protein was purified from the conditioned medium. In vitro studies showed that PCSK9 self-associated in a concentration-, temperature-, and pH-dependent manner. A mixture of PCSK9 monomers, dimers, and trimers displayed an enhanced LDLR degrading activity compared to monomeric PCSK9. A gain-of-function mutant, D374Y, displayed greatly increased self-association compared to wild-type PCSK9. Moreover, we demonstrated that the catalytic domain of PCSK9 is responsible for the self-association. Self-association of PCSK9 was enhanced by incubation with mouse apoE −/− VLDL and inhibited by incubation with both human and mouse HDL. When PCSK9 protein was incubated with total serum, it partially associated with LDL and HDL but not with VLDL. In transgenic mice, PCSK9 also associated with LDL and HDL but not with VLDL. We conclude that self-association is an intrinsic property of PCSK9, correlated to its LDLR-degrading activity and affected by plasma lipoproteins. These results provide a basis for developing strategies to manipulate PCSK9 activity in the circulation for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.

DISCUSSION

In this study we report a high-level mammalian cell expression system and a high-yield purification procedure for human PCSK9. The C-terminally tagged PCSK9 protein expressed by the transfected cells was functional in degrading cell surface LDLR. Mature PCSK9 protein purified from the conditioned medium was also functional, when added to cultured cells, in reducing cell LDLR levels. Upon incubation in vitro , purified PCSK9 self-associated to form dimers and trimers in a concentration, pH, and temperature-dependent manner. The catalytic domain of PCSK9 was found to be responsible for its self-association. The self-association of PCSK9 seemed to enhance its activity in degrading the LDLR through a selective faster uptake of multimers by the cells. ApoE −/− mouse VLDL increased, whereas human and wild-type mouse HDL decreased, the self-association of PCSK9. When incubated with mouse total serum, and in the serum of PCSK9 transgenic mice, PCSK9 partially associated with LDL and HDL but not VLDL.

PCSK9 has been suggested by genetic studies to be the third locus implicated in autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH) ( 8 ). Its protein sequence variations play a significant role in determining plasma lipoprotein levels. Very recent structural and functional studies of PCSK9 have provided significant new insights into the mechanisms of PCSK9 function and dysfunction. The X-ray structure of human PCSK9 revealed a unique prodomain-catalytic site interaction which manipulates PCSK9 function ( 32 , 33 ). The binding site of PCSK9 in the LDLR was located to the EGF-A repeat ( 34 ). Two elegant studies demonstrated that catalytic activity is not required for secreted PCSK9 to reduce LDLR levels ( 37 , 43 ). However, the molecular basis of PCSK9’s function and the regulation mechanism still remain largely unknown.

By degrading hepatocyte LDLR, PCSK9 causes decreased hepatic uptake of LDL and an accumulation of LDL in the circulation. Paradoxically PCSK9 and LDLR are regulated in hepatocytes through SREBPs in the same direction ( 26 , 27 ), as inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in hepatocytes increases SREBP-dependent transcription of both LDLR and PCSK9 ( 28 , 29 ). It is therefore likely that inhibition of PCSK9 activity would complement the LDL lowering effect of statin therapy. Although it was suggested that PCSK9 may degrade the LDLR before the receptor is transported to the cell surface ( 23 ), this pathway may not be a major mechanism. Legace et al. demonstrated that PCSK9 is endocytosed via the LDLR with the assistance of the adaptor protein ARH, and that it gains LDLR degradation activity in the LDLR recycling pathway ( 31 ). This has been confirmed recently ( 35 – 37 , 44 ). Consistent with that, our data indicated that PCSK9 did not degrade LDLR from isolated cell membranes ( Figure 1C ) but effectively reduced LDLR levels from the cells when added to the cell culture medium ( Figure 1D ).

The mature form of PCSK9 can be secreted into the circulation, and the circulating PCSK9 may have the potential to distribute to peripheral cells and thus regulate LDL entry in extrahepatic tissues. Therefore, plasma PCSK9 levels may be an indicator of metabolic status with regard to peripheral uptake of cholesterol and may also serve as a regulator of cholesterol flux between liver and peripheral tissues. A previous report by Benjannet et al. indicated that PCSK9 can be processed and inactivated by furin and/or PC5/6A extracellularly, and that sequence variations in PCSK9 affect furin and/or PC5/6A-mediated processes and inactivation ( 30 ). We show here another potential mechanism for PCSK9 activity to be modulated in the circulation. Our data show that PCSK9 could self-associate to form dimers and higher multimers which may have increased LDLR degrading activity ( Figure 2 ). The self-association of PCSK9 was concentration, temperature, and pH dependent ( Figures 2 and 3 ). A gain-of-function mutant, D374Y, which has much higher affinity to LDLR and higher LDLR-degrading activity, displayed more self-association ( Figure 3 ). PCSK9 was reported to bind more tightly to the LDLR at acidic pH ( 32 , 45 ); interestingly, at acidic pH, PCSK9 displayed significantly more self-association than at neutral pH ( Figure 3 ). These results indicated that the self-association of PCSK9 is correlated to its LDLR binding and degrading activity. The self-association of PCSK9 did not result from artificially high protein concentrations, since multimerization was observed at 0.5–1 μ g/mL ( Figure 3D and Figure 4B ), which is close to the PCSK9 concentration in human plasma ( 31 ). These results indicated that self-association is an intrinsic property of PCSK9.

While our experimental results point to the possibility that self-association may occur in vivo and is related to the LDLR-degrading activity, it was harder than expected to directly detect SDS-stable dimer and higher multimer formation in transfected cell culture medium and inside the cells. However, we did observe a quick uptake of multimers by the cells ( Figure 5A ) and managed to detect PCSK9 multimers formation in cell-free medium ( Figure 5B ) and in cells under conditions of blocked endosome–lysosome fusion ( Figure 5C ). These results suggest that PCSK9 may form multimers in the proximity of the cell surface which are selectively and efficiently taken up by the cells. PCSK9 may further self-associate while moving along the endocytic pathway and cross link multiple PCSK9-LDLR-LDL complexes, facilitating the rapid degradation of the complexes in lysosome. Grozdanov et al. previously reported that PCSK9 is not detected in the late endosome and lysosome ( 25 ), also indicating the fast degradation of PCSK9 in these components.

Our lentiviral transduction and confocal microscopy studies show that secreted PCSK9 can mediate LDLR degradation in cells not producing PCSK9 in co-culture systems. However, the LDLR degrading activity is stronger in cells expressing PCSK9 than in cells acted on by extracellular PCSK9 ( Figure 6 ). On one hand, this data confirmed that PCSK9 in the extracellular environment can mediate LDLR degradation in cells through a paracrine function; on the other hand, this data clearly demonstrated that the autocrine function of PCSK9 is more effective than the paracrine function. A reasonable explanation is that PCSK9 may be enriched on the cell surface of the PCSK9-producing cells, where it self-associates and therefore more effectively mediates LDLR degradation. However, we do not exclude the possibility that PCSK9 may functionally mediate LDLR degradation intracellularly, before its secretion.

We further showed that different lipoproteins affect the self-association of PCSK9 differently ( Figure 7 ). While apoE −/− VLDL enhance PCSK9 self-association, human and wild-type mouse HDLs inhibit it. As a proof of the physiologic relevance of the lipoprotein connection, we show that PCSK9 directly associates with LDL and HDL ( Figure 8 s 8 and 9 ). These findings not only provide a novel insight into how intracellular and extracellular cholesterol homeo-stasis mechanisms control PCSK9 expression and function but also point to a direction for therapeutic manipulation of PCSK9 activity through a circulation-based approach. The inhibitory effect of HDL on PCSK9 self-association may add another potential mechanism to the list of HDL’s anti-atherogenic functions. Although purely speculative at this stage, the possibility that HDL may regulate plasma LDL levels through functional sequestration of circulating PCSK9 is hard to ignore, given its therapeutic promise. In addition, we found that the absence of apoE demolished the anti-self-association effect of mouse HDL and conferred mouse VLDL the ability to enhance PCSK9 self-association. This may represent yet another mechanism by which apoE modulates plasma lipoprotein levels. Further studies are needed to unravel the mechanism through which lipoproteins affect PCSK9 self-association.

In summary, we report here an intrinsic self-association property of PCSK9, which is mediated by the catalytic domain, correlated to its LDLR binding and degrading activity, and may be modulated by plasma lipoproteins. The data from this study provide a rationale for inhibition of the activity of the circulating PCSK9 as a strategy for plasma cholesterol control. Inhibition of plasma PCSK9 may be achieved through reduction of its self-association, preventing it from binding to and degrading LDLR.
