Eosinophils are important effector cells in defense against helminth infection 
and in allergic diseases. To identify novel eosinophil proteins, large scale 
sequencing of a cDNA library prepared from interleukin-5-stimulated umbilical 
cord precursor cells was performed, and the major genes expressed by maturing 
eosinophils were determined. This resulted in the identification of a cDNA with 
64% identity to human prepro-major basic protein (hprepro-MBP). This cDNA was 
designated hprepro-MBP homolog (hprepro-MBPH). Interestingly, the calculated pI 
values for hMBPH and hMBP differed by >100-fold, with pI values of 8.7 and 11.4, 
respectively. Given this pronounced basicity difference, the homolog 
transcript's abundance (1.1%), and MBP's critical role in eosinophil biological 
activity, we further characterized the homolog. Reverse transcription-polymerase 
chain reaction detected transcription of hprepro-MBPH in bone marrow only, and 
this result was confirmed by analysis of a large cDNA data base (electronic 
Northern). hMBPH was isolated from human eosinophil granule lysates, and its 
identity was verified by amino acid sequencing and by mass spectrometry. 
Analyses of the biological activities showed that hMBPH had effects similar to 
hMBP in cell killing and neutrophil (superoxide anion production and 
interleukin-8 release) and basophil (histamine and leukotriene C4 release) 
stimulation assays, but usually with reduced potency. Overall, this novel 
homolog's unique physical properties indicated that the high net positive charge 
of hMBP is important but not essential for biological activity.
