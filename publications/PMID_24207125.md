Reactivation of p53 by release of the functional protein from its inhibition by 
MDM2 provides an efficient, nongenotoxic approach to a wide variety of cancers. 
We present the cocrystal structures of two complexes of MDM2 with inhibitors 
based on 6-chloroindole scaffolds. Both molecules bound to a distinct 
conformational state of MDM2 with nM-μM affinities. In contrast to other 
structurally characterized antagonists, which mimic three amino acids of p53 
(Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26), the compounds induced an additional hydrophobic 
pocket on the MDM2 surface and unveiled a four-point binding mode. The enlarged 
interaction interface of the inhibitors resulted in extension of small molecules 
binding toward the "lid" segment of MDM2 (residues 19-23)--a nascent element 
that interferes with p53 binding. As supported by protein engineering and 
molecular dynamics studies, employing these unstable elements of MDM2 provides 
an efficient and yet unexplored alternative in development of MDM2-p53 
association inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

Tumor development requires breaching the line of defense formed by the “guardian of the genome,” the tumor suppressor p53 protein ( Brown et al., 2009 ; Cheok, et al., 2011 ). About 50% of all human cancers inactivate p53 by mutations, and in the remaining the wild-type (WT)-p53 activity is most commonly repressed by the MDM2-mediated ubiquitination ( Brown et al., 2009 ). The release of the functional p53 from its MDM2-mediated regulation provides an efficient, nongenotoxic approach to cancer therapy. Substantial progress has been made in discovering p53-activating molecules in recent years ( Cheok et al., 2011 ; Ding et al., 2013 ; Vogel et al., 2012 ; Wade et al., 2013 ; Zhao et al., 2013 ). Three different classes of small-molecule MDM2 antagonists are currently under clinical investigation ( Wade et al., 2013 ) and, in addition, p53-stapled peptides have emerged as a promising modality for the p53-Mdm2 and p53-Mdmx interactions ( Baek et al., 2012 ; Chang et al., 2013 ).

Interaction between p53 and MDM2 involves their N-terminal segments and relies on steric complementarity between the hydrophobic cleft in the p53-binding domain of MDM2 (residues 25–110) and the hydrophobic face of an α helix in the p53 transactivation domain (residues 18–26) ( Joerger and Fersht, 2008 ; Kussie et al., 1996 ; Popowicz et al., 2011 ; Stoll et al., 2001 ). Key to this interaction is a triad of p53 amino acids that insert deeply into the MDM2 cleft: Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26 (designated as three subpockets on MDM2; Figure 1 ; Figure S1 available online). The MDM2-p53 recognition is a dynamic and multistage process that employs the binding-induced folding of p53 ( Kussie et al., 1996 ; Popowicz et al., 2011 ; Uesugi and Verdine, 1999 ; Lee et al., 2000 ), the rearrangement of the Leu26 subpocket of MDM2 by a twist of the Tyr100 ring from the “closed” to the “open” (anti)conformations (as defined by Popowicz et al., 2007 , 2008 ; Kussie et al., 1996 ; Dastidar et al., 2009 ; Uhrinova et al., 2005 ), and the dissociation of a transient α-helical N-terminal “lid” segment of MDM2 (residues 19–23) from the proximity of the p53-complementary interface ( McCoy et al., 2003 ; Showalter et al., 2008 ; Zhan et al., 2012 ).

Until now, all structurally characterized low-molecular-weight inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction targeted the same “closed” Tyr100 state and were incapable of reaching the N-terminal “lid” segment, an intrinsically disordered region of MDM2 ( Popowicz et al., 2011 ; Shangary and Wang, 2009 ; Dömling, 2008 ; Graves et al., 2012 ). Here, we present X-ray structures as evidence of two MDM2 complexes that reveal inhibitor molecules bound to the “open” Tyr100 conformation, leading to a four-point pharmacophore model for this pharmacologically important protein-protein interaction.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the X-ray structures of the two small-molecule/MDM2 complexes show the inhibitor molecules to be bound to the “open” Tyr100 conformation in a highly extended manner. By developing a line of inhibitors that disrupt the MDM2-p53 interaction, we demonstrated that rearrangements of aromatic side chains around the p53-interaction interface are associated with only modest energetic penalties ( Chen and Luo, 2007 ; Espinoza-Fonseca and Trujillo-Ferrara, 2006 ; Espinoza-Fonseca and García-Machorro, 2008 ) and local instabilities in the protein’s binding pocket might be successfully used for extending ligand-protein interaction by formation of a deep hydrophobic pocket formed by back folding of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal lid region, normally seen unfolded in all other MDM2 structures ( Movie S1 ). Therefore, we propose a four-point pharmacophore model that should lead to the design of novel classes of antagonists of the MDM2-p53 interaction and suggest a new possibility of affinity optimization by preventing “lid” dissociation.

NMR Methods

Uniform 15 N isotope labeling was achieved by expression of the protein in M9 minimal media containing 15 NH 4 Cl as nitrogen source. All the spectra were recorded at 293 K using Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a TXI cryoprobe. 1 H- 15 N heteronuclear correlations were obtained using fast HSQC pulse sequence ( Mori et al., 1995 ). Final step of purification of NMR samples was gel filtration into NMR buffer containing 50 mM phosphate (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT. Ten percent (v/v) of D 2 O was added to samples to provide lock signal.

Assignment of the amide groups of MDM2 (1–125) was obtained following Stoll et al. (2001) and Showalter et al. (2008) . Thanks to relatively good dispersion of MDM2 (1–125), assignment of most of the amide resonances of the mutant MDM2 (1–125 S22P, E23G) was possible by comparison and manual inspection of the spectra. Normalized values of chemical shift perturbations were calculated according to the Pythagoras formula with 15N weighting factor 0.2.

Antagonist-induced dissociation assays (AIDA) ( Bista et al., 2009 ; D’Silva et al., 2005 ) for investigation of potency of small-molecular weight antagonists to dissociate the MDM2-p53 complex were performed on MDM2(1–125)-p53(1–312) complex using the SEI-AIDA pulse sequence ( Bista et al., 2009 ). For calculation of K i values of the inhibitors (according to Wang, 1995 ), K D of MDM2-p53 interaction was set to the value obtained in ITC measurements with p53 (residues 19–37).
