The myeloid restricted membrane glycoprotein, CD33, is a member of the recently 
characterized "sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-related lectin" family. 
Although CD33 can mediate sialic acid-dependent cell interactions as a 
recombinant protein, its function in myeloid cells has yet to be determined. 
Since CD33 contains two potential immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition 
motifs in its cytoplasmic tail, we investigated whether it might act as a 
signaling receptor in myeloid cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CD33 in myeloid 
cell lines was stimulated by cell surface cross-linking or by pervanadate, and 
inhibited by PP2, a specific inhibitor of Src family tyrosine kinases. 
Phosphorylated CD33 recruited both the protein-tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and 
SHP-2. CD33 was dephosphorylated in vitro by the co-immunoprecipitated tyrosine 
phosphatases, suggesting that it might also be an in vivo substrate. The first 
CD33 phosphotyrosine motif is dominant in CD33-SHP-1/SHP-2 interactions, since 
mutating tyrosine 340 in a CD33-cytoplasmic tail fusion protein significantly 
reduced binding to SHP-1 and SHP-2 in THP-1 lysates, while mutation of tyrosine 
358 had no effect. Furthermore, the NH2-terminal Src homology 2 domain of SHP-1 
and SHP-2, believed to be essential for phosphatase activation, selectively 
bound a CD33 phosphopeptide containing tyrosine 340 but not one containing 
tyrosine 358. Finally, mutation of tyrosine 340 increased red blood cell binding 
by CD33 expressed in COS cells. Hence, CD33 signaling through selective 
recruitment of SHP-1/SHP-2 may modulate its ligand(s) binding activity.
