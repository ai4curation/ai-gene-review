Histone deacetylases are required for transcriptional repression in eukaryotes. 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae has several histone deacetylases, of which ySir2p is 
the most conserved throughout evolution. Currently, there is no report on the 
interacting protein partner of a human Sir2 homolog, SIRT2. Here we show for the 
first time that SIRT2 interacts with the homeobox transcription factor, HOXA10, 
which was identified in a two-hybrid screen. Interactions were confirmed by 
co-immunoprecipitation from in vitro translations as well as in human cell-free 
extracts. Taken together with mouse knockout studies, our results raise the 
intriguing possibility that SIRT2 plays a role in mammalian development.
