Although heat shock proteins (HSPs) were discovered as inducible proteins by the 
physical stress to protect cells, recent evidence has suggested that HSPs are 
likely involved in cell cycle control under normal conditions without stress. In 
the present study, we demonstrated that 73hsc (heat shock cognate protein), 
which belongs to the HSP70 family of molecular chaperones, interacts with 
P27Kip1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, during G1/S transition. 73hsc 
was detected in the immunoprecipitates with anti-P27Kip1 antibody and, vice 
versa, P27Kip1 was present in the immunoprecipitates with anti-73hsc antibody by 
Western blotting using growth-stimulated rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells. This complex 
formation of 73hsc and P27Kip1 was cell cycle dependent and its maximum 
formation was observed at G1/S transition where the level of P27Kip1 
dramatically decreased. ATP dissociated this complex formation in a 
dose-dependent manner. These data indicated that 73hsc might be involved in the 
cell cycle progression through the regulation of cell cycle regulators such as 
P27Kip1.
