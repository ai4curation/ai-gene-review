Dendrites can be maintained for extended periods of time after they initially 
establish coverage of their receptive field. The long-term maintenance of 
dendrites underlies synaptic connectivity, but how neurons establish and then 
maintain their dendritic arborization patterns throughout development is not 
well understood. Here, we show that the NAD synthase Nicotinamide mononucleotide 
adenylyltransferase (Nmnat) is cell-autonomously required for maintaining 
type-specific dendritic coverage of Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) 
sensory neurons. In nmnat heterozygous mutants, dendritic arborization patterns 
of class IV da neurons are properly established before increased retraction and 
decreased growth of terminal branches lead to progressive defects in dendritic 
coverage during later stages of development. Although sensory axons are largely 
intact in nmnat heterozygotes, complete loss of nmnat function causes severe 
axonal degeneration, demonstrating differential requirements for nmnat dosage in 
the maintenance of dendritic arborization patterns and axonal integrity. 
Overexpression of Nmnat suppresses dendrite maintenance defects associated with 
loss of the tumor suppressor kinase Warts (Wts), providing evidence that Nmnat, 
in addition to its neuroprotective role in axons, can function as a protective 
factor against progressive dendritic loss. Moreover, motor neurons deficient for 
nmnat show progressive defects in both dendrites and axons. Our studies reveal 
an essential role for endogenous Nmnat function in the maintenance of both 
axonal and dendritic integrity and present evidence of a broad neuroprotective 
role for Nmnat in the central nervous system.
