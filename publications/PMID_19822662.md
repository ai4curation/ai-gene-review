NuA4, the major H4 lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) complex in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, is recruited to promoters and stimulates transcription initiation. 
NuA4 subunits contain domains that bind methylated histones, suggesting that 
histone methylation should target NuA4 to coding sequences during transcription 
elongation. We show that NuA4 is cotranscriptionally recruited, dependent on its 
physical association with elongating polymerase II (Pol II) phosphorylated on 
the C-terminal domain by cyclin-dependent kinase 7/Kin28, but independently of 
subunits (Eaf1 and Tra1) required for NuA4 recruitment to promoters. Whereas 
histone methylation by Set1 and Set2 is dispensable for NuA4's interaction with 
Pol II and targeting to some coding regions, it stimulates NuA4-histone 
interaction and H4 acetylation in vivo. The NuA4 KAT, Esa1, mediates increased 
H4 acetylation and enhanced RSC occupancy and histone eviction in coding 
sequences and stimulates the rate of transcription elongation. Esa1 cooperates 
with the H3 KAT in SAGA, Gcn5, to enhance these functions. Our findings 
delineate a pathway for acetylation-mediated nucleosome remodeling and eviction 
in coding sequences that stimulates transcription elongation by Pol II in vivo.
