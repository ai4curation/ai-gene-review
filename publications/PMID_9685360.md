The anti-atherogenic effects of apolipoprotein (apo) E have been attributed to 
its ability to reduce plasma cholesterol level and to limit foam cell formation. 
The purpose of this study was to ascertain if apoE also may have cytostatic 
functions that could attenuate vascular occlusive diseases. Purified apoE 
inhibited smooth muscle cell migration directed to platelet-derived growth 
factor (PDGF) or oxidized LDL (oxLDL) (p < 0.0001). The purified apoE also 
suppressed PDGF- and oxLDL-induced smooth muscle cell proliferation (p < 0.001). 
These apoE inhibitory effects were not because of suppression of PDGF binding to 
its receptors on the smooth muscle cells, but was correlated with a significant 
reduction in agonist-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity (p < 
0.01). ApoE also inhibited PDGF-induced cyclin D1 mRNA expression, suggesting 
that the apoE effect was mediated by growth arrest at the G0 to G1 phase. Taken 
together, these results suggest that apoE has cytostatic functions in the vessel 
wall and may protect against vascular diseases through inhibition of cell 
signaling events associated with growth factor-induced smooth muscle cell 
migration and proliferation.
