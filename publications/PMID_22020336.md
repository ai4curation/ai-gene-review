The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) regulate cell growth, proliferation 
and survival, and are frequently affected in human cancer. PI3K is composed of a 
catalytic subunit, p110, and a regulatory subunit, p85. The PI3K catalytic 
subunit p110δ is encoded by PIK3CD and contains p85- and RAS-binding domains, 
and a kinase domain. Here we present an alternatively spliced PIK3CD transcript 
encoding a previously unknown protein, p37δ, and demonstrate that this protein 
is expressed in human ovarian and colorectal tumors. p37δ retains the 
p85-binding domain and a fraction of the RAS-binding domain, lacks the catalytic 
domain, and has a unique carboxyl-terminal region. In contrast to p110δ, which 
stabilizes p85, p37δ promoted p85 sequestering. Despite the truncated 
RAS-binding domain, p37δ bound to RAS and we found a strong positive correlation 
between the protein levels of p37δ and RAS. Overexpressing p37δ, but not p110δ, 
increased the proliferation and invasive properties of HEK-293 cells and mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts. Cells overexpressing p37δ showed a quicker 
phosphorylation response of AKT and ERK1/2 following serum stimulation. 
Ubiquitous expression of human p37δ in the fruit fly increased body size, DNA 
content and phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels. Thus, p37δ appears to be a new 
tumor-specific isoform of p110δ with growth-promoting properties.
