The molecular underpinnings of the oocyte-to-embryo transition are poorly 
understood. Here we show that two protein tyrosine phosphatase-like (PTPL) 
family proteins, EGG-4 and EGG-5, are required for key events of the 
oocyte-to-embryo transition in Caenorhabditis elegans. The predicted EGG-4 and 
EGG-5 amino acid sequences are 99% identical and their functions are redundant. 
In embryos lacking EGG-4 and EGG-5, we observe defects in meiosis, polar body 
formation, the block to polyspermy, F-actin dynamics, and eggshell deposition. 
During oogenesis, EGG-4 and EGG-5 assemble at the oocyte cortex with the 
previously identified regulators or effectors of the oocyte-to-embryo transition 
EGG-3, CHS-1, and MBK-2 [1, 2]. All of these molecules share a complex 
interdependence with regards to their dynamics and subcellular localization. 
Shortly after fertilization, EGG-4 and EGG-5 are required to properly coordinate 
a redistribution of CHS-1 and EGG-3 away from the cortex during meiotic anaphase 
I. Therefore, EGG-4 and EGG-5 are not only required for critical events of the 
oocyte-to-embryo transition but also link the dynamics of the regulatory 
machinery with the advancing cell cycle.
