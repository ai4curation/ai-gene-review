A novel superfamily of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho GTPases 
includes DOCK180 and zizimin1. The zizimin subfamily includes three genes of 
which only zizimin1 has been cloned. We report here the cloning of zizimin2, 
identified in a screen for genes enriched in germinal center B cells. Zizimin2 
and zizimin1 have similar primary structures and both proteins bound and 
activated Cdc42 but not the Cdc42-related proteins TC10 or TCL. Their tissue 
distributions are distinct, however, with zizimin2 expressed predominantly in 
lymphocytes and an opposite pattern for zizimin1. Zizimin3 was also analyzed and 
showed distinct GTPase specificity and tissue distribution.
