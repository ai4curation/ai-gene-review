ECSIT (evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathways) is

receptors (TLRs), TGF-β, and BMP. Here, we report a new regulatory role of ECSIT

ECSIT-knockdown THP-1 (ECSIT(KD) THP-1) cells exhibited severe impairments in

ECSIT gene. Interestingly, ECSIT mutants, which lack a specific interacting

no significant changes in both NF-κB activity and cytokine production induced by 
TLR4 could be seen in TAK1(KD) or TRAF6(KD) THP-1 cells transduced by WT ECSIT, 
strongly suggesting the essential requirement of TAK1-ECSIT-TRAF6 complex in 
TLR4 signaling. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the ECSIT complex,

Abstract

ECSIT (evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathways) is known as a multifunctional regulator in different signals, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), TGF-β, and BMP. Here, we report a new regulatory role of ECSIT in TLR4-mediated signal. By LPS stimulation, ECSIT formed a high molecular endogenous complex including TAK1 and TRAF6, in which ECSIT interacted with each protein and regulated TAK1 activity, leading to the activation of NF-κB. ECSIT-knockdown THP-1 (ECSIT KD THP-1) cells exhibited severe impairments in NF-κB activity, cytokine production, and NF-κB-dependent gene expression, whereas those were dramatically restored by reintroduction of wild type (WT) ECSIT gene. Interestingly, ECSIT mutants, which lack a specific interacting domain for either TAK1 or TRAF6, could not restore these activities. Moreover, no significant changes in both NF-κB activity and cytokine production induced by TLR4 could be seen in TAK1 KD or TRAF6 KD THP-1 cells transduced by WT ECSIT, strongly suggesting the essential requirement of TAK1-ECSIT-TRAF6 complex in TLR4 signaling. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the ECSIT complex, including TAK1 and TRAF6, plays a pivotal role in TLR4-mediated signals to activate NF-κB.

Introduction

Innate immune responses are triggered by the engagement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 4 or other pattern recognition receptors by various pathogen components, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( 1 – 3 ). TLRs recognize a broad range of microbial pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, triggering inflammatory and antiviral responses and dendritic cell maturation, which result in the eradication of invading pathogens ( 4 ). Individual TLRs interact with different combinations of adaptor proteins and activate various transcription factors, such as nuclear factor (NF)-κB, activating protein-1, and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) ( 3 , 4 ).

ECSIT (evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathways) had been identified as a cytoplasmic protein interacting specifically with the multiadaptor protein and E3 ubiquitin ligase TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which participates in both Drosophila and mammalian TLRs signaling pathways that regulate innate immunity ( 5 ). In addition, previous reports have shown that ECSIT plays an essential role for the bactericidal activity through mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation in response to TLR stimulation ( 6 ) and functions in Bmp signaling in the nucleus ( 7 ). These results indicate that the intracellular localization of ECSIT might be linked with its specific roles ( i.e. as a signaling adaptor protein in the cytoplasm ( 5 ), as a reactive oxygen species regulator protein in the mitochondria ( 6 , 8 ), and as a cofactor for Bmp signaling in the nucleus ( 7 )).

In this study, we tried to identify the new regulatory function of ECSIT in TLR4 signaling. In order to do that, we utilized a gel filtration column chromatography assay and found that ECSIT forms a high mass signaling complex including TRAF6 and TAK1. To understand the molecular mechanism to be implicated by the complex, we performed biochemical and functional studies by using ECSIT-knockdown (KD), TAK1 KD , or TRAF6 KD THP-1 cells. Our data showed that ECSIT forms a signaling complex with TAK1 and TRAF6 through specific molecular interactions, where TAK1 activity was regulated, and thereby affects downstream cascade signaling for the activation of NF-κB. Moreover, we found that the regulatory role of TAK1-ECSIT-TRAF6 complex is critically linked to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-1β, and NF-κB-dependent gene expressions induced by TLR4 stimulation, strongly suggesting a pivotal role of TAK1-ECSIT-TRAF6 complex in TLR4-mediated signals.

DISCUSSION

Pattern recognition receptors, including TLRs, on innate immune cells trigger the activation of signaling cascades that activate multiple transcriptional factors, including NF-κB ( 1 – 4 ). The NF-κB activation eventually leads to regulation of NF-κB-dependent gene expressions, which play essential roles in mounting immune responses against various pathogens ( 3 , 4 ). In TLR-mediated signals, many proteins are either directly or indirectly involved in the activation of NF-κB. Among them, TRAF6 and TAK1 proteins, which are essential molecules upstream of IKKs, play a key role in the NF-κB activation. Although a plausible model for how to activate TAK1 in TLRs signaling was recently proposed ( 16 ), it is still poorly characterized. Previous studies have shown that TRAF6 as E3 ubiquitin ligase interacts with TAK1 through the TAK1-associating protein TAB2 in response to various stimuli, including TLR ligands, IL-1, and RANK ligand ( 17 – 19 ). A recent study has shown that TRAF6 also interacts with ECSIT, ubiquitinating ECSIT, and that it is thereby implicated in TLR signaling through the regulation of reactive oxygen species production. Because ECSIT has been identified as a novel intermediate capable of bridging TRAF6 to MEKK-1 in Toll/IL-1 signaling ( 5 ), we initially assumed in this study that ECSIT, along with TRAF6, might be implicated in the regulation of TAK1 activity in TLR-mediated signaling. Our data provide biochemical and molecular evidence that the TAK1-ECSIT-TRAF6 complex is a key component in the TLR4 signaling pathway and that it mediates NF-κB activation and thereby regulates NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Our data also provide genetic evidence that ECSIT KD , TAK1 KD , or TRAF6 KD THP-1 cells reveal impairment in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, p65 DNA binding activity, and NF-κB-dependent gene expression.

It has been found that the conserved TRAF domain of TRAF6 interacts with ECSIT ( 5 ). Additionally, we identified in this study that the TRAF domain of TRAF6 interacted with the 200–257 region of ECSIT. Importantly, we found that ECSIT also specifically interacted with TAK1 through the 257–431 region of ECSIT, demonstrating that TAK1 and TRAF6 interact with different regions of ECSIT. In terms of functional aspect, the association of ECSIT-TAK1-TRAF6 may be essential in TLR4 signaling. ECSIT KD , TAK1 KD , or TRAF6 KD THP-1 cells revealed severe impairment in NF-κB reporter activity, cytokine production, and p65 DNA binding activity induced by TLR4 stimulation. Moreover, two truncated mutants, lacking either the TAK1 binding domain or TRAF6 binding domain of ECSIT, respectively, could not modulate these activities in ECSIT KD THP-1 cells. Additionally, we found that ECSIT KD THP-1 cells exhibited a marked decrease in TAK1 kinase activity induced by TLR4 stimulation, which correlated with impairments in the activation of IKKs and expression of NF-κB-dependent genes.

In summary, as depicted in Fig. 7 F , upon TLR4 stimulation, ECSIT forms the high mass signaling complex, including TRAF6 and TAK1. In the complex, TAK1 is activated. The activated TAK1 induces the activation of IKK complexes through phosphorylation, leading to the degradation of IκB-α through phosphorylation and polyubiquitination. The dissociated p65/p50 NF-κBs from IκB-α translocate into the nucleus, leading to the induction of p65/p50-dependent gene expression. Because several reports have also shown that ECSIT plays a key role in the signaling networks gone awry in Alzheimer disease ( 20 – 22 ) and cellular oncogenesis ( 7 ), we therefore believe that our results will contribute to the understanding of ECSIT-related signals, including TLRs, Bmp, and TGF-β signaling, and the pathogenesis of ECSIT-related diseases, such as Alzheimer disease.
