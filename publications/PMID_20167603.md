DYRK1A (the dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A) plays 
an important role in body growth and brain physiology. Overexpression of this 
kinase has been associated with the development of Down syndrome in both human 
and animal models, whereas single copy loss-of-function of DYRK1A leads to 
increased apoptosis and decreased brain size. Although more than a dozen of 
DYRK1A targets have been identified, the molecular basis of its involvement in 
neuronal development remains unclear. Here we show that DYRK1A and another 
pro-survival member of the DYRK family, DYRK3, promote cell survival through 
phosphorylation and activation of SIRT1, an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase 
that is essential in a variety of physiological processes including stress 
response and energy metabolism. DYRK1A and DYRK3 directly phosphorylate SIRT1 at 
Thr(522), promoting deacetylation of p53. A SIRT1 phosphorylation mimetic (SIRT1 
T522D) displays elevated deacetylase activity, thus inhibiting cell apoptosis. 
Conversely, a SIRT1 dephosphorylation mimetic (SIRT1 T522V) fails to mediate 
DYRK-induced deacetylation of p53 and cell survival. We show that knockdown of 
endogenous DYRK1A and DYRK3 leads to hypophosphorylation of SIRT1, sensitizing 
cells to DNA damage-induced cell death. We also provide evidence that 
phosphorylation of Thr(522) activates SIRT1 by promoting product release, 
thereby increasing its enzymatic turnover. Taken together, our findings provide 
a novel mechanism by which two anti-apoptotic DYRK members promote cell survival 
through direct modification of SIRT1. These findings may have important 
implications in understanding the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis, Down 
syndrome, and aging.

DYRK1A (the dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A) plays an important role in body growth and brain physiology. Overexpression of this kinase has been associated with the development of Down syndrome in both human and animal models, whereas single copy loss-of-function of DYRK1A leads to increased apoptosis and decreased brain size.

Here we show that DYRK1A and another pro-survival member of the DYRK family, DYRK3, promote cell survival through phosphorylation and activation of SIRT1, an NAD + -dependent protein deacetylase that is essential in a variety of physiological processes including stress response and energy metabolism. DYRK1A and DYRK3 directly phosphorylate SIRT1 at Thr 522 , promoting deacetylation of p53. A SIRT1 phosphorylation mimetic (SIRT1 T522D) displays elevated deacetylase activity, thus inhibiting cell apoptosis.

Introduction

The DYRK (dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and regulated kinase) proteins are a highly conserved subfamily of protein kinases that catalyze the autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues and the phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues on exogenous substrates ( 1 ). The mammalian DYRK family consists of at least seven members, DYRK1A, DYRK1B (also known as MIRK), DYRK1C, DYRK2, DYRK3, DYRK4A, and DYRK4B ( 2 ). Among them, DYRK1A is the best characterized member. DYRK1A is a nuclear protein ubiquitously expressed in all tissues. Previous studies have shown that DYRK1A regulates body growth and normal brain development in a dose-sensitive manner. Single copy loss-of-function of DYRK1A leads to decreased body and brain size ( 3 , 4 ). On the other hand, modest overexpression of DYRK1A in both humans and mice is associated with the development of Down syndrome ( 5 , 6 ). Therefore, DYRK1A is also known as Down syndrome-associated kinase.

Accumulating studies have revealed that the DYRK protein kinases play an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. DYRK1A has been shown to function as a caspase-9 Thr 125 kinase that inhibits the intrinsic apoptotic pathways in the developing retina ( 7 ) as well as several human cancer cell lines ( 8 ). DYRK3 has also been shown to attenuate apoptosis in response to cytokine withdrawal in hematopoietic cells of erythroid lineage ( 9 , 10 ). Conversely, DYRK2, a family member closely related to DYRK3, is activated by ATM upon genotoxic stress and induces apoptosis by direct phosphorylation of p53 at Ser 46 ( 11 ).

The Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) family of proteins, also known as sirtuins, are highly conserved NAD + -dependent protein deacetylases and/or ADP ribosyltransferases ( 12 ). First identified in yeast as key components in gene silencing complexes (reviewed in Ref. 13 ), sirtuins have been increasingly recognized as crucial regulators for a variety of cellular processes, ranging from energy metabolism and stress response to tumorigenesis and aging ( 14 ). The mammalian genome encodes seven sirtuins, collectively known as SIRT1 to SIRT7 ( 15 ). A wealth of data has demonstrated that SIRT1, the mammalian ortholog of yeast Sir2 protein, directly couples NAD + hydrolysis to the deacetylation of histones and numerous transcription factors and co-factors, such as p53, E2F1, NFκB, FOXO, c-Myc, HIF-2α, and HSF1 ( 16 – 24 ). Therefore, SIRT1 directly links cellular metabolic status to gene regulation, playing an important role in a number of pro-survival activities ( 14 ).

We have identified DYRK3 as a SIRT1 interacting partner in a yeast-two hybrid screen ( supplemental Fig. S1 A ). In this report, we show that two anti-apoptotic members of the DYRK family, DYRK1A and DYRK3, directly interact with and phosphorylate SIRT1 on threonine 522. Phosphorylation at this residue activates SIRT1, promoting cell survival upon genotoxic stress in a p53-dependent manner. More importantly, our findings indicate that phosphorylation of Thr 522 of SIRT1 is required for DYRK1A- and DYRK3-mediated cell survival. These findings imply that abnormalities in the DYRK/SIRT1 signaling axis may underlie the DYRK gene-dosage imbalance effects observed in conditions such as Down syndrome and cancer.

DISCUSSION

Members of the DYRK family of protein kinases have been increasingly recognized as key regulators of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Although closely related, DYRK1A and DYRK3 have been shown to promote cell survival in various cell types ( 7 – 9 ), whereas DYRK2 induces apoptosis by direct phosphorylation of p53 at Ser 46 ( 11 ). Our study shows that SIRT1 is selectively activated by the pro-survival DYRK family members through phosphorylation at Thr 522 ( Fig. 2 ). Importantly, phosphorylation of SIRT1 is essential for DYRK-mediated cell survival ( Figs. 5 and 6 E ). Although the basis of this selectivity remains unclear, our observations are consistent with the notion that activation of SIRT1 promotes cell survival under nutrient depletion and other stress-associated conditions.

As the best understood member of the sirtuins family, SIRT1 is rising as an important therapeutic target for metabolic diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and possibly aging. Although much attention has been focused on the identification of cellular targets of this sirtuin, the regulatory network governing SIRT1 has just begun to emerge ( 33 , 34 ). Our present study identifies DYRK1A and DYRK3 as key regulators of SIRT1. DYRK1A and DYRK3 phosphorylate and thus activate SIRT1, which in turn deacetylates p53 and promotes cell survival. On the other hand, knockdown of these kinases activates p53, resulting in increased cell death in response to genotoxic stress. Our findings add a new layer to the regulatory network that controls SIRT1 activity and underscore the importance of SIRT1 in the coordination of environmental stimuli and cellular signals that control cell fate.

The observation that SIRT1 is activated by phosphorylation at a single amino acid located at its noncatalytic C-terminal domain is intriguing, but not altogether surprising. Previous structural studies have suggested that the N- and C-terminal extensions of sirtuins may function as inhibitory domains to regulate NAD + binding and protein substrate recognition ( 28 , 29 ). Therefore, any protein-protein interactions or modifications that perturb the resting intramolecular orientation of SIRT1 N- and C-terminal domains would increase its activity. In support of this notion, two previously identified protein activators of SIRT1, AROS, and SENP1 both interact with and/or modify the noncatalytic domains ( 35 , 36 ). In fact, all of the reported phosphorylation sites of SIRT1 that activate its activity are located within the N- or C-terminal domains ( 37 – 39 ). Our study suggests that introduction of a negatively charged phosphate group at Thr 522 , a site that localizes within a conserved hinge region linking the core and C-terminal domains, likely induces an open conformation. This conformational change does not affect the intrinsic catalytic ability of SIRT1 ( supplemental Fig. S3 B ). Instead, it repositions the inhibitory C-terminal domain, increasing the release of deacetylated products after the reaction is complete, thereby enhancing catalytic turnover and subsequent rounds of activity ( Fig. 7 ). The open conformation of SIRT1 is also likely to increase the accessibility of substrates to the catalytic core domain. Further characterization of conformations of SIRT1 and its phosphorylation mimetics will be helpful to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the phosphorylation regulation of SIRT1.

The phosphorylation of Thr 530 of human SIRT1 (equivalent to Thr 522 of mouse SIRT1) has been recently reported as a cyclinB/cdk1 target and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) kinase ( 37 , 39 ). Despite claiming that mutation of this site together with Ser540 together affects cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, the study of Sasaki et al. ( 37 ) did not find effects of the T530A/S540A double mutant on deacetylase activity of SIRT1 using Fluor-de lys as a substrate. In fact, we also failed to detect any defect of deacetylase activities of the T522V mutant using Fluor-de lys as substrate ( supplemental Fig. S3 B ). The defective SIRT1 activity was only detectable using the native p53 protein. Therefore, the apparent discrepancy between our study and the work from Sasaki et al. lies in the difference of substrates. Although small acetyl-peptide substrates have proven important for analyzing the enzymatic mechanism of sirtuins, a previous study by Blander et al. ( 40 ) demonstrated that SIRT1 displays no substrate specificity on these small peptides. This observation suggests that small peptide substrates can freely access the core domain of SIRT1 and subsequently release from the enzyme without steric constrains from the N- and C-terminal domains. Therefore, the activity measured with these small peptides most likely reflects the intrinsic catalytic ability of the core domain, which is distant from the Thr 522 site. Nevertheless, it is possible that the phosphorylation at Thr 522 will only affect SIRT1 activity on a subset of substrates, not all substrates. Further analyses of substrate specificity of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated SIRT1 proteins will provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of SIRT1 by phosphorylation.

Several members of the DYRK family, including DYRK1A, Mirk/DYRK1B, and DYRK3, function as survival kinases in cancer cell lines, including cervical cancer ( 41 ), certain types of pancreatic cancers and ovarian cancers ( 42 ), and possibly anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( 43 ). The activation of SIRT1 by these kinases suggests that hyperactive SIRT1 may be part of a tumorigenic program in these cells. However, whether SIRT1 is a tumor promoter or tumor suppressor is currently under intense debate ( 44 , 45 ). Therefore, it remains difficult to predict whether therapeutic modulation of SIRT1 activity will prove useful for cancer therapy. It has been proposed that the oncogenic and tumor-suppressive effects of SIRT1 are dependent on the status of p53 ( 45 ). In cancer cells expressing wild-type p53, SIRT1 promotes cellular senescence and limits cell proliferation. However, in cells containing mutant p53, overexpression of SIRT1 promotes cell survival through p53-independent mechanisms. Therefore, it will be of great interest to determine whether the pro-survival effect of DYRKs requires p53 in cancers.

Although all of our current data point toward the regulation of SIRT1 by the DYRK family of kinases, it is also possible that DYRK kinases are acetylated proteins, and SIRT1 functions to regulate their activities in response to different cellular signals. Further studies are needed to dissect the interplay between these two families of vital protein modification enzymes.
