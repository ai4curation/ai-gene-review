Recent evidence indicates that membrane microdomains, termed lipid rafts, have a 
role in B-cell activation as platforms for B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signal 
initiation. To gain an insight into the possible functioning of lipid rafts in B 
cells, we applied liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) methodologies to the identification of proteins that 
co-purified with lipid rafts of Raji cells. Among these raft proteins, we 
characterized a novel protein termed Raftlin (raft-linking protein). Like the 
Src family kinase, Raftlin is localized exclusively in lipid rafts by fatty 
acylation of N-terminal Gly2 and Cys3, and is co-localized with BCR before and 
after BCR stimulation. Disruption of the Raftlin gene in the DT40 B-cell line 
resulted in a marked reduction in the quantity of lipid raft components, 
including Lyn and ganglioside GM1, while overexpression of Raftlin increased the 
content of raft protein. Moreover, BCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and 
calcium mobilization were impaired by the lack of Raftlin and actually 
potentiated by overexpression of Raftlin. These data suggest that Raftlin plays 
a pivotal role in the formation and/or maintenance of lipid rafts, therefore 
regulating BCR-mediated signaling.
