Sesbania mosaic virus (SeMV) is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA plant virus 
belonging to the genus Sobemovirus. The movement protein (MP) encoded by SeMV 
ORF1 showed no significant sequence similarity with MPs of other genera, but 
showed 32% identity with the MP of Southern bean mosaic virus within the 
Sobemovirus genus. With a view to understanding the mechanism of cell-to-cell 
movement in sobemoviruses, the SeMV MP gene was cloned, over-expressed in 
Escherichia coli and purified. Interaction of the recombinant MP with the native 
virus (NV) was investigated by ELISA and pull-down assays. It was observed that 
SeMV MP interacted with NV in a concentration- and pH-dependent manner. Analysis 
of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of the MP showed that SeMV MP interacts 
with the NV through the N-terminal 49 amino acid segment. Yeast two-hybrid 
assays confirmed the in vitro observations, and suggested that SeMV might belong 
to the class of viruses that require MP and NV/coat protein for cell-to-cell 
movement.
