Protein ubiquitination plays an important role in the regulation of 
TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-mediated NF-κB activation. It is well 
established that TAK1 activation is tightly regulated with its binding partners, 
TAK1-binding proteins (TAB1-3). However, the tight regulation of TAK1 activation 
remains elusive. Here, using Trim26-knockout mice and Trim26-transgenic mice, we 
found that TRIM26 acts as a positive regulator of TAK1 activation by 
ubiquitinating its binding partner TAB1. Knockout of Trim26 inhibited TAK1 
activation and downstream kinases activation, thus decreasing the induction of 
proinflammatory cytokines following LPS, TNF-α, and IL-1β stimulation. 
Mechanistically, TRIM26 catalyzes the K11-linked polyubiquitination of TAB1 at 
Lys294, Lys319, and Lys335 to enhance the activation of TAK1 and subsequent 
NF-κB and MAPK signaling. Consequently, Trim26 deficiency protects mice from 
LPS-induced septic shock in vivo. Moreover, Trim26 deficiency attenuates the 
severity of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Thus, these finding 
provides a novel insight into how TAK1 activation is regulated through 
TRIM26-mediated ubiquitination of TAB1 and reveals the new function of TRIM26 in 
the regulation of the inflammatory innate immune response.
