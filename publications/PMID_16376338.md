Recognition of phosphorylated serine/threonine-containing motifs by 14-3-3 
depends on the dimerization of 14-3-3. However, the molecular cues that control 
14-3-3 dimerization are not well understood. In order to identify proteins that 
control 14-3-3 dimerization, we analyzed proteins that have effects on 14-3-3 
dimerization and report that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates 14-3-3zeta at 
a specific residue (Ser58). Phosphorylation by PKA leads to modulation of 
14-3-3zeta dimerization and affect its interaction with partner proteins. 
Substitution of Ser58 to Ala completely abolished phosphorylation of 14-3-3zeta 
by PKA. A phospho-mimic mutant of 14-3-3zeta, Ser58 to Glu substitution, failed 
to form homodimers, showed reduced interaction with 14-3-3epsilon and p53, and 
could not enhance transcriptional activity of p53. Moreover, activation of PKA 
decreases and inhibition of PKA increases the dimerization of 14-3-3zeta and the 
functional interaction of 14-3-3zeta with p53. Therefore, our results suggest 
that PKA is a new member of protein kinases that can phosphorylate and impair 
the function of 14-3-3.
