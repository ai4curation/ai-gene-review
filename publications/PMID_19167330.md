In dividing cells, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) disassemble during mitosis and 
reassemble into the newly forming nuclei. However, the fate of nuclear pores in 
postmitotic cells is unknown. Here, we show that NPCs, unlike other nuclear 
structures, do not turn over in differentiated cells. While a subset of NPC 
components, like Nup153 and Nup50, are continuously exchanged, scaffold 
nucleoporins, like the Nup107/160 complex, are extremely long-lived and remain 
incorporated in the nuclear membrane during the entire cellular life span. 
Besides the lack of nucleoporin expression and NPC turnover, we discovered an 
age-related deterioration of NPCs, leading to an increase in nuclear 
permeability and the leaking of cytoplasmic proteins into the nucleus. Our 
finding that nuclear "leakiness" is dramatically accelerated during aging and 
that a subset of nucleoporins is oxidatively damaged in old cells suggests that 
the accumulation of damage at the NPC might be a crucial aging event.
