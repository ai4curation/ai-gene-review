Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is a luminal sarcoplasmic reticulum 
(SR) protein of 165 kDa identified by virtue of its ability to bind 125I-labeled 
low-density lipoprotein with high affinity after sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Hofmann et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264: 
8260-8270, 1989). Its role in SR function is unknown. In this report, the gene 
encoding human HRC was localized to human chromosome 19 and mouse chromosome 7 
by hybridization of a human HRC cDNA fragment to a panel of somatic cell 
hybrids. Known synteny between a portion of human chromosome 19 and a portion of 
mouse chromosome 7 and in situ hybridization of a biotin-labeled HRC probe to 
human chromosomes suggest a localization to a region corresponding to 19q13.3. 
The locus for myotonic dystrophy resides in the region 19q13.2-13.3. Therefore, 
we considered HRC, a muscle-specific gene, to possibly represent a "candidate 
gene" for myotonic muscular dystrophy. As a first step toward localizing HRC in 
relation to the myotonic dystrophy locus, we report the cloning of the human HRC 
gene, its intron-exon organization, and characterization of several informative 
polymorphisms to be used in future linkage studies in families with myotonic 
dystrophy. Of particular interest is an Alu-associated poly-d(GA) sequence 
located in an intron in the middle of the gene, and two stretches of acidic 
amino acids in the coding region of exon 1 that vary in length among different 
individuals.
