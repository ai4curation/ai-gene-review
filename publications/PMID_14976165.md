The N-terminus of the BRCA1 protein bears a RING finger domain that functions as 
an E3 ubiquitin ligase in vitro where it is able to catalyse the synthesis of 
monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin targeted proteins. This activity is greatly 
increased when BRCA1 is in a complex with its N-terminal binding partner BARD1. 
In this report we use an immunohistochemical approach to demonstrate the 
association of cellular BRCA1 with the end product of the ubiquitin conjugation 
and ligation pathway, conjugated ubiquitin. Association is apparent at DNA 
replication structures in S-phase and following treatment with hydroxyurea and 
also at sites of double strand break repair after exposure to ionizing 
radiation. Down-regulation of endogenous, cellular BRCA1 : BARD1 using siRNA 
results in abrogation of ubiquitin conjugation in these structures, suggesting 
that heterodimer activity is required for their formation. Conversely, 
ectopically expressed full-length BRCA1, but not BRCA1 bearing specific 
N-terminal amino acid substitutions, is able to cooperate with BARD1 to increase 
ubiquitin conjugation in cells. Conjugation of ubiquitin in foci is inhibited by 
the expression of ubiquitin bearing a lysine 6 mutation suggesting that the 
ubiquitin polymers formed at these sites are dependent on lysine-6 for linkage. 
Together these data demonstrate that BRCA1 directed ligation of ubiquitin occurs 
during S-phase and in response to replication stress and DNA damage and is 
therefore likely to be a significant aspect of BRCA1 cellular activity.
