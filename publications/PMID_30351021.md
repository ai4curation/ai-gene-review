Lanthanides (Lns) have been shown recently to be essential cofactors in certain 
enzymes in methylotrophic bacteria. Here we identify in the model methylotroph, 
Methylobacterium extorquens, a highly selective LnIII-binding protein, which we 
name lanmodulin (LanM). LanM possesses four metal-binding EF hand motifs, 
commonly associated with CaII-binding proteins. In contrast to other EF 
hand-containing proteins, however, LanM undergoes a large conformational change 
from a largely disordered state to a compact, ordered state in response to 
picomolar concentrations of all LnIII (Ln = La-Lu, Y), whereas it only responds 
to CaII at near-millimolar concentrations. Mutagenesis of conserved proline 
residues present in LanM's EF hands, not encountered in CaII-binding EF hands, 
to alanine pushes CaII responsiveness into the micromolar concentration range 
while retaining picomolar LnIII affinity, suggesting that these unique proline 
residues play a key role in ensuring metal selectivity in vivo. Identification 
and characterization of LanM provides insights into how biology selectively 
recognizes low-abundance LnIII over higher-abundance CaII, pointing toward 
biotechnologies for detecting, sequestering, and separating these 
technologically important elements.
