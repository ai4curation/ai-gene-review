Two proteins which specifically bind tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have recently 
been isolated from human urine in our laboratory. The two proteins cross-react 
immunologically with two species of cell surface TNF receptors (TNF-R). 
Antibodies against one of the two TNF binding proteins (TBPI) were found to have 
effects characteristic of TNF, including stimulating phosphorylation of specific 
cellular proteins. Oligonucleotide probes designed on the basis of the 
NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of TBPI were used to clone the cDNA for the 
structurally related cell surface type 1 TNF-R. It is notable that although this 
receptor can signal the phosphorylation of cellular proteins, it appears from 
its amino acid sequence to be devoid of intrinsic protein kinase activity. The 
extracellular domain of the receptor is composed of four internal cysteine-rich 
repeats, homologous to structures repeated four times in the extracellular 
domains of the nerve growth factor receptor and the B lymphocytes surface 
antigen CDw40. The amino acid composition and size of the extracellular domain 
of the type I TNF-R closely resemble those of TBPI. The COOH-terminal amino acid 
sequence of the four cysteine rich repeats within the extracellular domain of 
the type I TNF-R matches the COOH-terminal sequence of TBPI. Amino acid 
sequences in the extracellular domain also fully match other sequences found in 
TBPI. On the other hand, amino acid sequences in the soluble form of the type II 
TNF-R (TBPII), while indicating a marked homology of structure, did not suggest 
any identity between this protein and the extracellular domain of the type I 
TNF-R. CHO cells transfected with type I TNF-R cDNA produced both cell surface 
and soluble forms of the receptor. The receptor produced by CHO cells was 
recognized by several monoclonal antibodies against TBPI, reacting with several 
distinct epitopes in this molecule. These data suggest that the soluble forms of 
the TNF-Rs are structurally identical to the extracellular cytokine binding 
domains of these receptors and are consistent with the notion that the soluble 
forms are, at least partly, derived from the same transcripts that encode the 
cell surface receptors.
