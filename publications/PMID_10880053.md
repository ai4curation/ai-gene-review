The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in cardiovascular and 
fluid homeostasis. The major biologically active peptide of the RAS is 
angiotensin II, which acts through G protein-coupled receptors of two 
pharmacological classes, AT(1) and AT(2). AT(1) receptors, expressed in brain 
and peripheral tissues, mediate most classically recognized actions of the RAS, 
including blood pressure homeostasis and regulation of drinking and water 
balance. In rodents, two highly homologous AT(1) receptor isoforms, termed 
AT(1A) and AT(1B) receptors, are expressed at different levels in major 
forebrain cardiovascular and fluid regulatory centers, with AT(1A) expression 
generally exceeding AT(1B) expression, but the relative contributions of these 
receptor subtypes to central angiotensin II responses are not known. We used 
gene targeting in combination with a unique system for maintaining catheters in 
the cerebral ventricles of conscious mice to test whether there are differential 
roles for AT(1A) and AT(1B) receptors in responses elicited by angiotensin II in 
the brain. Here we show that the blood pressure increase elicited by centrally 
administered angiotensin II can be selectively ascribed to the AT(1A) receptor. 
However, the drinking response requires the presence of AT(1B) receptors. To our 
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a primary and nonredundant 
physiological function for AT(1B) receptors.
