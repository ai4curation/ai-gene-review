Human S3 protein (hS3) is a structural component of the ribosome, which, in 
addition to its role in translation, possesses activities typical of some DNA 
repair enzymes. Recombinant hS3 purified from inclusion bodies and refolded 
under different conditions was investigated for its ability to bind and cleave 
oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates containing different lesions abundant in 
cellular DNA (apurine/apyrimidine sites, uracil, 8-oxoguanine, 8-oxoadenine, 
5,6-dihydrouracil, hypoxanthine). hS3 catalyzed cleavage of apurine/apyrimidine 
sites through beta-elimination mechanism forming a transient Schiff base 
covalent intermediate, but did not cleave substrates containing other lesions. 
Refolding of hS3 in the presence of Fe2+ and S2- ions did not increase its 
activity, despite the earlier suggestions that this protein could contain an 
iron-sulfur cluster. Binding of hS3 to DNA ligands containing oxidized and 
deaminated bases was less efficient than its binding to undamaged DNA. 
Therefore, the activity of hS3 on apurine/apyrimidine sites is not likely to be 
involved in the global in vivo DNA repair but could have a role in the repair in 
some specific locations in the genome.
