For over a decade, p130Cas/BCAR1, HEF1/NEDD9/Cas-L, and Efs/Sin have defined the 
Cas (Crk-associated substrate) scaffolding protein family. Cas proteins mediate 
integrin-dependent signals at focal adhesions, regulating cell invasion and 
survival; at least one family member, HEF1, regulates mitosis. We here report a 
previously undescribed novel branch of the Cas protein family, designated HEPL 
(for HEF1-Efs-p130Cas-like). The HEPL branch is evolutionarily conserved through 
jawed vertebrates, and HEPL is found in some species lacking other members of 
the Cas family. The human HEPL mRNA and protein are selectively expressed in 
specific primary tissues and cancer cell lines, and HEPL maintains Cas family 
function in localization to focal adhesions, as well as regulation of FAK 
activity, focal adhesion integrity, and cell spreading. It has recently been 
demonstrated that upregulation of HEF1 expression marks and induces metastasis, 
whereas high endogenous levels of p130Cas are associated with poor prognosis in 
breast cancer, emphasizing the clinical relevance of Cas proteins. Better 
understanding of the complete protein family should help inform prediction of 
cancer incidence and prognosis.
