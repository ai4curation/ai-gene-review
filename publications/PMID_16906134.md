Misfolded proteins are associated with several pathological conditions including 
neurodegeneration. Although some of these abnormally folded proteins result from 
mutations in genes encoding disease-associated proteins (for example, 
repeat-expansion diseases), more general mechanisms that lead to misfolded 
proteins in neurons remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that low levels 
of mischarged transfer RNAs (tRNAs) can lead to an intracellular accumulation of 
misfolded proteins in neurons. These accumulations are accompanied by 
upregulation of cytoplasmic protein chaperones and by induction of the unfolded 
protein response. We report that the mouse sticky mutation, which causes 
cerebellar Purkinje cell loss and ataxia, is a missense mutation in the editing 
domain of the alanyl-tRNA synthetase gene that compromises the proofreading 
activity of this enzyme during aminoacylation of tRNAs. These findings 
demonstrate that disruption of translational fidelity in terminally 
differentiated neurons leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and cell 
death, and provide a novel mechanism underlying neurodegeneration.
