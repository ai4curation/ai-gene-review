The Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CN), a 
heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit A and an essential regulatory 
subunit B, plays critical functions in various cellular processes such as 
cardiac hypertrophy and T cell activation. It is the target of the most widely 
used immunosuppressants for transplantation, tacrolimus (FK506) and cyclosporin 
A. However, the structure of a large part of the CNA regulatory region remains 
to be determined, and there has been considerable debate concerning the 
regulation of CN activity. Here, we report the crystal structure of full-length 
CN (β isoform), which revealed a novel autoinhibitory segment (AIS) in addition 
to the well-known autoinhibitory domain (AID). The AIS nestles in a hydrophobic 
intersubunit groove, which overlaps the recognition site for substrates and 
immunosuppressant-immunophilin complexes. Indeed, disruption of this AIS 
interaction results in partial stimulation of CN activity. More importantly, our 
biochemical studies demonstrate that calmodulin does not remove AID from the 
active site, but only regulates the orientation of AID with respect to the 
catalytic core, causing incomplete activation of CN. Our findings challenge the 
current model for CN activation, and provide a better understanding of molecular 
mechanisms of CN activity regulation.
