Escherichia coli typically secretes many proteins into the periplasmic space, 
and the periplasmic proteins have been used for the secretory production of 
various proteins by the biotechnology industry. However, the identity of all of 
the E. coli periplasmic proteins remains unknown. Here, high-resolution 
periplasmic proteome reference maps of the E. coli K-12 and B strains were 
constructed and compared. Of the 145 proteins identified by tandem mass 
spectrometry, 61 proteins were conserved in the two strains, whereas 11 and 12 
strain-specific proteins were identified for the E. coli K-12 and B strains, 
respectively. In addition, 27 proteins exhibited differences in intensities 
greater than 2-fold between the K-12 and B strains. The periplasmic proteins 
MalE and OppA were the most abundant proteins in the two E. coli strains. 
Distinctive differences between the two strains included several proteins that 
were caused by genetic variations, such as CybC, FliC, FliY, KpsD, MglB, ModA, 
and Ybl119, hydrolytic enzymes, particularly phosphatases, glycosylases, and 
proteases, and many uncharacterized proteins. Compared to previous studies, the 
localization of many proteins, including 30 proteins for the K-12 strain and 53 
proteins for the B strain, was newly identified as periplasmic. This study 
identifies the largest number of proteins in the E. coli periplasm as well as 
the dynamics of these proteins. Additionally, these findings are summarized as 
reference proteome maps that will be useful for studying protein secretion and 
may provide new strategies for the enhanced secretory production of recombinant 
proteins.
