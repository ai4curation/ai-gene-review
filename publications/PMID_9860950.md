Chaperones of the Hsp70 family bind to unfolded or partially folded polypeptides 
to facilitate many cellular processes. ATP hydrolysis and substrate binding, the 
two key molecular activities of this chaperone, are modulated by the cochaperone 
DnaJ. By using both genetic and biochemical approaches, we provide evidence that 
DnaJ binds to at least two sites on the Escherichia coli Hsp70 family member 
DnaK: under the ATPase domain in a cleft between its two subdomains and at or 
near the pocket of substrate binding. The lower cleft of the ATPase domain is 
defined as a binding pocket for the J-domain because (i) a DnaK mutation located 
in this cleft (R167H) is an allele-specific suppressor of the binding defect of 
the DnaJ mutation, D35N and (ii) alanine substitution of two residues close to 
R167 in the crystal structure, N170A and T173A, significantly decrease DnaJ 
binding. A second binding determinant is likely to be in the substrate-binding 
domain because some DnaK mutations in the vicinity of the substrate-binding 
pocket are defective in either the affinity (G400D, G539D) or rate (D526N) of 
both peptide and DnaJ binding to DnaK. Binding of DnaJ may propagate 
conformational changes to the nearby ATPase catalytic center and 
substrate-binding sites as well as facilitate communication between these two 
domains to alter the molecular properties of Hsp70.
