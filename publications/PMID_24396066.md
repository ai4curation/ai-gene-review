The simultaneous interaction of poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) with eukaryotic 
translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and the mRNA 3' poly(A) tail promotes 
translation initiation. We previously showed that the interaction of 
PABP-interacting protein 1 (Paip1) with PABP and eukaryotic translation 
initiation factor 3 (eIF3; via the eIF3g subunit) further stimulates 
translation. Here, we demonstrate that the interaction of eIF3 with Paip1 is 
regulated by amino acids through the mTORC1 signaling pathway. The Paip1-eIF3 
interaction is impaired by the mTORC1 inhibitors, rapamycin and PP242. We show 
that ribosomal protein S6 kinases 1 and 2 (S6K1/2) promote the interaction of 
eIF3 with Paip1. The enhancement of Paip1-eIF3 interaction by amino acids is 
abrogated by an S6K inhibitor or shRNA against S6K1/2. S6K1 interacts with eIF3f 
and, in vitro, phosphorylates eIF3. Finally, we show that S6K inhibition leads 
to a reduction in translation by Paip1. We propose that S6K1/2 phosphorylate 
eIF3 to stimulate Paip1-eIF3 interaction and consequent translation initiation. 
Taken together, these data demonstrate that eIF3 is a new translation target of 
the mTOR/S6K pathway.
