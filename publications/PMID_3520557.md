## Abstract

1. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Jun;83(11):3820-4. doi:

A yeast mutant lacking mitochondrial manganese-superoxide dismutase is 
hypersensitive to oxygen.

van Loon AP, Pesold-Hurt B, Schatz G.

The nuclear gene for manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD; 
superoxide:superoxide oxidoreductase, EC 1.15.1.1) of yeast mitochondria was 
mapped on chromosome VIII and inactivated by gene disruption. The resulting 
mutant lacked any protein cross-reacting with anti-MnSOD antibodies, and its 
mitochondria exhibited less than 1% of the cyanide-insensitive superoxide 
dismutase activity found in mitochondria of the wild-type parent strain. In the 
absence of oxygen, the mutant grew as rapidly as the wild-type parent. However, 
increasing concentrations of oxygen led to a progressive inhibition of growth. 
The properties of this mutant provide direct evidence that MnSOD contributes to 
the natural protection of cells against oxygen toxicity.
