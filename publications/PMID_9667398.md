Familial hyperproinsulinaemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by point 
mutations in the insulin gene which impair the conversion of proinsulin to 
insulin. We report here three members of a two-generation Caucasian family in 
whom this syndrome was identified by unexplained hyperinsulinism associated with 
normal glucose tolerance and normal insulin sensitivity. Plasma insulin 
immunoreactivity showed a reduced affinity for the insulin receptor and eluted 
mainly, on Biogel chromatography, at the position of proinsulin. Analysis of the 
PCR-amplified insulin gene by restriction enzyme mapping revealed a new 
recognition site for the enzyme Nla III, indicating a Arg65 to His mutation. 
Sequence analysis of exon 3 confirmed this mutation in one allele of the gene.
CONCLUSION: This study reports a two-generation European-Caucasian family with 
hyperproinsulinaemia due to a substitution of His for Arg at position 65 in 
proinsulin, the seventh now identified worldwide and the second from Europe. The 
mutation generated a new restriction site on the insulin gene suggesting the 
usefulness of restriction enzyme mapping as a screening procedure.
