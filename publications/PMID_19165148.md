Abstract

The ultraviolet-B (UV-B) portion of the solar radiation functions as an environmental signal for which plants have evolved specific and sensitive UV-B perception systems. The UV-B-specific UV RESPONSE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) and the multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) are key regulators of the UV-B response. We show here that uvr8 -null mutants are deficient in UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis and hypersensitive to UV-B stress, whereas overexpression of UVR8 results in enhanced UV-B photomorphogenesis, acclimation and tolerance to UV-B stress. By using sun simulators, we provide evidence at the physiological level that UV-B acclimation mediated by the UV-B-specific photoregulatory pathway is indeed required for survival in sunlight. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that the wild type but not the mutant UVR8 and COP1 proteins directly interact in a UV-B-dependent, rapid manner in planta. These data collectively suggest that UV-B-specific interaction of COP1 and UVR8 in the nucleus is a very early step in signalling and responsible for the plant's coordinated response to UV-B ensuring UV-B acclimation and protection in the natural environment.

Introduction

Sunlight is of utmost importance to plants, both as the ultimate energy source and as an environmental signal regulating growth and development. For the latter, higher plants possess several classes of photoreceptors, including the molecularly known phytochromes for the red/far-red, and cryptochromes, phototropins and members of the Zeitlupe family for the UV-A/blue part of the spectrum (e.g. Chen et al , 2004 ). Ultraviolet-B (UV-B; 280–315 nm) radiation is an integral part of the sunlight reaching the surface of the Earth and induces a broad range of physiological responses. The UV-B-induced photomorphogenic responses, in contrast to damage responses, are thought to be mediated by a molecularly unidentified UV-B-specific photoreceptor different from the known receptors acting in the visible part of the light spectrum ( Brosche and Strid, 2003 ; Frohnmeyer and Staiger, 2003 ; Ulm and Nagy, 2005 ; Jenkins and Brown, 2007 ). Key regulatory factors involved in the UV-B-induced photomorphogenic pathway, such as the bZIP transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) and the seven-bladed propeller protein UV RESPONSE LOCUS 8 (UVR8), have been identified and plants harbouring hy5 , cop1 and uvr8 loss of function mutations display reduced tolerance to UV-B stress ( Kliebenstein et al , 2002 ; Ulm et al , 2004 ; Brown et al , 2005 ; Oravecz et al , 2006 ).

UVR8 was found to exclusively act in UV-B signalling, thus showing high functional specificity ( Brown et al , 2005 ). In planta, UV-B stimulates rapid nuclear accumulation of the UVR8 protein, which seems to be required but is not sufficient for UV-B-responsive gene expression changes ( Kaiserli and Jenkins, 2007 ). UVR8 associates constitutively with chromatin regions of several UV-B-activated genes, including the HY5 genomic locus ( Brown et al , 2005 ; Cloix and Jenkins, 2008 ). Recently, it was suggested that HY5 and its homologue HYH are key effectors of the UVR8 pathway and act redundantly to control expression of most, if not all, UVR8 target genes ( Brown and Jenkins, 2008 ).

COP1 is a known repressor of photomorphogenesis in darkness as well as in light, but is a promoter of UV-B-specific responses: cop1 mutants have a light-grown phenotype in darkness, show features of enhanced photomorphogenesis in light but are deficient in UV-B photomorphogenic responses ( Yi and Deng, 2005 ; Oravecz et al , 2006 ). At the molecular level, COP1 targets different photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription factors for degradation in the dark, among them HY5 ( Osterlund et al , 2000 ; Saijo et al , 2003 ). Upon activation of photoreceptors by visible light, COP1 is inactivated and physically separated from HY5 by nuclear exclusion, allowing HY5 stabilization and activation of light-responsive genes ( von Arnim and Deng, 1994 ; Yi and Deng, 2005 ). Light-induced, early inactivation of this E3 ligase is most likely mediated by direct interaction with active phytochromes and cryptochromes, but the precise molecular mechanism underlying this process is still unknown ( Yi and Deng, 2005 ). However, a number of characteristics clearly distinguish COP1 function under UV-B from that in visible light signalling, including (i) promotive versus repressive function, (ii) primarily nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization, (iii) structure–function differences displayed by different cop1 alleles and (iv) independence versus dependence on accessory SPA proteins ( Oravecz et al , 2006 ). Altogether, this set of data indicated a distinct UV-B signalling function of the multifunctional COP1 protein.

Despite the ecological and economic impact of the UV-B response (e.g. Caldwell et al , 2007 ), very little is known about the underlying signalling mechanisms linking UV-B perception to specific photomorphogenic responses. Both UVR8 and COP1 impinge on the UV-B-mediated activation of HY5 gene expression; however, the relationship of COP1 and UVR8 UV-B-specific functions has remained unknown. Here, we show that COP1 and UVR8 proteins interact specifically in a UV-B-dependent manner in planta, suggesting that physical association between these two proteins contributes to their specific activities in UV-B signalling. This conclusion is supported by the findings that mutant alleles of COP1 or UVR8 displaying UV-B signalling deficiencies do not interact with their respective wild-type partner. Furthermore, we demonstrate the absence of UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis in uvr8 mutants at the phenotypic level and show that UVR8 overexpression, on the other hand, leads to UV-B hyperresponsiveness. As a result, uvr8 mutants are more, whereas UVR8 overexpressors are less affected than their corresponding wild type under UV-B regimens simulating natural conditions.

Overexpression of UVR8 results in an enhanced UV-B photomorphogenic response

To determine whether UVR8 protein is a rate-limiting factor in the Arabidopsis UV-B response, we generated transgenic lines overexpressing UVR8 under the control of the constitutive strong CaMV35S promoter. Using western blot analysis, levels of UVR8 overexpression were estimated and two transgenic lines in which quantitative RT–PCR also detected an approximately 30-fold overexpression of UVR8 mRNA compared with wild type were used for detailed analysis ( Figure 2A ). In these lines, a marked UV-B photomorphogenic hypersensitivity was observed in all assays employed, including hypocotyl growth inhibition, HY5 and CHS gene activation, and anthocyanin accumulation ( Figure 2B–G ). Thus, we conclude that UVR8 has a rate-limiting function in the UV-B photomorphogenic pathway.

Discussion

Plants are inevitably exposed to UV-B radiation in sunlight due to their sessile lifestyle and their need to capture light to fuel photosynthesis. Nonetheless, plants are well protected in nature and ‘sunburns' are seldom observed. This study demonstrates that (i) COP1 and UVR8 proteins are absolutely required for the UV-B photoregulatory pathway, (ii) UV-B induces direct interaction of UVR8 with COP1 in planta, (iii) UVR8 levels are rate limiting in this process, and that (iv) UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis is essential in establishing UV-B acclimation and tolerance under realistic climatic conditions. Our observations thus place COP1–UVR8 interaction as a very early event in the UV-B regulatory network responsible for conferring UV-B protection.

COP1 is a multifunctional protein that was initially identified as a repressor of photomorphogenesis ( Yi and Deng, 2005 ). Recent work has indicated a promotive role in a response mediated by phytochrome B ( Boccalandro et al , 2004 ) and has extended the functions of COP1 beyond seedling photomorphogenesis, including the regulation of flowering and regulation of stomatal opening ( Mao et al , 2005 ; Jang et al , 2008 ; Liu et al , 2008 ). Our previous work also demonstrated a novel function of COP1 in UV-B photomorphogenesis that is mechanistically different from its repressor function in visible light ( Oravecz et al , 2006 ). Moreover, recent data have provided more information about the function and regulation of COP1 in mammalian systems ( Yi and Deng, 2005 ). Accordingly, it was shown in human cell lines that huCOP1 is a negative regulator of p53 and that DNA damage evoked by ionizing radiation induces an ATM-dependent phosphorylation of huCOP1 at Ser 387 , followed by its nuclear exclusion, rapid autoubiquitination and degradation ( Dornan et al , 2006 ). In contrast, we showed that the Arabidopsis COP1 is stabilized and enriched in the nucleus under narrowband UV-B irradiation ( Figure 5A and B ; Oravecz et al , 2006 ) and existence of an Arabidopsis COP1 residue corresponding to Ser 387 is not apparent by sequence analysis. Nonetheless, a cross-talk of the UV-B photomorphogenic pathway with DNA damage responses mediated by COP1 and ATM/ATR proteins might still exist in Arabidopsis . Interestingly, however, in human cell lines UV-B also induces dissociation of COP1 and thus stabilization of the bZIP transcription factor c-Jun ( Yi et al , 2005 ; Savio et al , 2008 ). The inhibition of COP1-mediated degradation and thus stabilization of HY5 under UV-B in Arabidopsis seems related.

In contrast to the COP1 protein, the UVR8 protein is specifically involved in UV-B photomorphogenic responses, even though non-UV-B-related functions may still be discovered under conditions not tested so far. The UVR8 protein shows sequence similarity to the human regulator of chromatin condensation 1 (RCC1) ( Kliebenstein et al , 2002 ), a GEF for the small GTP-binding protein Ran with important roles in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, mitosis and nuclear envelope assembly ( Hetzer et al , 2002 ). The three-dimensional structure of RCC1 revealed a seven-bladed β-propeller, of which the blades consist of seven homologous repeats of 51–68 amino-acid residues that are different from the WD40 β-propeller motif ( Renault et al , 1998 ). This structure is very likely to be conserved in Arabidopsis UVR8 proteins, where a majority of the relevant residues are conserved ( Kliebenstein et al , 2002 ). Similar to RCC1, nuclear localized UVR8 is associated with chromatin through histones ( Cloix and Jenkins, 2008 ). Notwithstanding these features, several evidences indicate that UVR8 is not an RCC1 orthologue. For example, UVR8 is predominantly localized to cytoplasm ( Kaiserli and Jenkins, 2007 ), and seems not to interact with Arabidopsis Ran proteins in directed yeast two-hybrid assays nor does it have substantial GEF activity ( Brown et al , 2005 ). Moreover, in contrast to lethality or highly pleiotropic effects of RCC1 mutations in fungi and other species, the uvr8 mutants display no visible effect on standard growth and development, except in the presence of UV-B.

COP1 interaction with UVR8 seems crucial for the UV-B photomorphogenic pathway. We emphasize that this light response of COP1 occurs in the range of minutes, much faster than any of the presently known reactions of COP1, including nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking in the range of 12–24 h (e.g. von Arnim and Deng, 1994 ; Oravecz et al , 2006 ). This is more in agreement with rapid effects of UV-B and other light qualities on gene expression and stabilization of COP1 target proteins ( Duek et al , 2004 ; Yang et al , 2005 ). Our data suggest that UVR8 provides UV-B-specific signalling function to the multifunctional COP1 protein, which is necessary to relay the UV-B signal. In agreement, we provide evidence that mutations of UVR8 and COP1 residues hampered both protein–protein interaction with their wild-type partner and UV-B response, indicating that these processes are intimately connected.

Low levels of UV-B stimulate transcription of genes, among which many are involved in UV-B protection. A previous report using microarray analysis identified 639 genes induced by broadband UV-B in mature wild-type plants, with a majority of those normally induced in the uvr8-1 mutant (namely 567 genes; Brown et al , 2005 ). This initial analysis indicated that 72 (i.e. 11%) of the UV-B-induced genes depend on UVR8 protein. A subsequent report using several selected marker genes in RT–PCR experiments suggested that a large portion of these UVR8-independent genes are actually output of non-UV-B-specific signalling pathways, including those involved in UV-B stress ( Brown and Jenkins, 2008 ). Similarly, our previous microarray analysis under broadband UV-B indicated that approximately 31 and 75% of the UV-B-induced genes depend on HY5 and COP1, respectively ( Oravecz et al , 2006 ). Taken together, it is likely that in these assays, broadband UV-B may have activated to some extent both UV-B photomorphogenic and stress pathways. The gene profiling data presented here, using supplementary narrowband UV-B irradiation, clarify this issue. Under these conditions, specific for activation of UV-B photomorphogenesis, expression of the vast majority of the early UV-B-regulated genes depends on COP1 (namely 99.5% of the upregulated and 100% of the downregulated genes at 1 h; 99.8 and 99.4% at 6 h) and UVR8 (98.6 and 100% at 1 h; 99.6 and 99.4% at 6 h). These data strongly indicate that (i) both COP1 and UVR8 are of utmost importance to the UV-B photoregulatory response, and that (ii) we have established UV-B irradiation conditions that specifically activate the UV-B photoreceptor pathway. The uvr8 mutant is instrumental in differentiating the UV-B stress and non-stress pathways, best illustrated by the fact that uvr8 mutants are UV-B stress hypersensitive (most obvious under conditions involving UV-B acclimation) and, reciprocally, are hyposensitive to UV-B as an informational signal. Thus, uvr8 mutants can be used as a genetic tool for detailed analysis of the postulated UV-B photoreceptor pathway. We have already taken advantage of this feature and provide unequivocal evidence for a UV-B photomorphogenic transcriptome and the necessity of a functional UV-B photomorphogenic response for UV-B acclimation and survival in sunlight. It is of note here that UV-B acclimation has interesting parallels with other acclimation processes in plants, such as cold acclimation and freezing tolerance (e.g. Penfield, 2008 ). Notwithstanding this, we could also show that the UV-B-induced hypocotyl growth inhibition is a bona fide UV-B photomorphogenic response. It is absent in uvr8 mutants but not affected by phytochrome, cryptochrome, phototropin photoreceptor, and uvr2 and uvr3 photolyase mutants ( Oravecz et al , 2006 and data not shown). Thus, we conclude that in uvr8 , as well as cop1 mutants, the UV-B photoreceptor pathway is non-functional.

Downstream of COP1 and UVR8, the bZIP transcription factors HYH and particularly HY5 have a prominent role in UV-B signalling. Accordingly, it was shown that HY5-dependent genes are also dependent on UVR8 and COP1 under broadband UV-B ( Brown et al , 2005 ; Oravecz et al , 2006 ; Brown and Jenkins, 2008 ). Moreover, the association of UVR8 with chromatin in the HY5 promoter region indicates a function of UVR8 and COP1 close to HY5 gene transcription, but the exact mechanism of action remains to be determined. However, we could not detect chromatin association of GFP–COP1 with the HY5 promoter region, nor was the interaction of UVR8 with chromatin disrupted in cop1-4 mutants ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). These data indicate that, even though functional COP1 is required for UVR8 function in response to UV-B, it is not at the level of chromatin association and may not involve chromatin association of COP1 protein itself. Moreover, UVR8 protein levels in cop1 mutants are similar to wild-type levels, indicating that COP1 is not targeting UVR8 for proteasomal degradation. In agreement, UVR8 protein levels were found to be unaffected by different light qualities tested, including UV-B ( Kaiserli and Jenkins, 2007 ).

Regarding our understanding of UV-B perception and signalling, the rather rapid UV-B-dependent COP1–UVR8 interaction provides an important mechanistic link between the two major players. We propose that the interaction with UVR8 specifies COP1 function under UV-B through adjusting its substrate specificity ( Figure 8 ). Part of the interaction of UVR8 with COP1 under extended UV-B might include taking out COP1 from phytochrome/cryptochrome signalling, as indicated by the cop1 -like phenotype of UVR8 overexpressor lines under UV-B. Notwithstanding this, absence of the UV-B photoregulatory response suggests a very early and crucial function of UVR8 and COP1 proteins closely linked to UV-B photoreceptor activity or signal transmission. The interaction of UVR8 with COP1, its rapid UV-B-dependent nuclear accumulation and requirement on UV-B radiation for function is reminiscent of properties of known photoreceptors. Thus, a function of UVR8 as UV-B photoreceptor cannot be excluded at present, a notion that deserves further investigation.
