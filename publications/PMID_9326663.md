The Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) gene encodes an unusual protein 
serine/threonine phosphatase in that it contains at least two EF-hand motifs at 
its carboxy terminus. By a combination of large-scale sequencing of human retina 
cDNA clones and searches of expressed sequence tag and genomic DNA databases, we 
have identified two sequences in mammals [Protein Phosphatase with EF-hands-1 
and 2 (PPEF-1 and PPEF-2)] and one in Caenorhabditis elegans (PPEF) that closely 
resemble rdgC. In the adult, PPEF-2 is expressed specifically in retinal rod 
photoreceptors and the pineal. In the retina, several isoforms of PPEF-2 are 
predicted to arise from differential splicing. The isoform that most closely 
resembles rdgC is localized to rod inner segments. Together with the recently 
described localization of PPEF-1 transcripts to primary somatosensory neurons 
and inner ear cells in the developing mouse, these data suggest that the PPEF 
family of protein serine/threonine phosphatases plays a specific and conserved 
role in diverse sensory neurons.
