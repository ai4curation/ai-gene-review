Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an infectious microorganism that causes human 
tuberculosis. The cell membranes of pathogens are known to be rich in possible 
diagnostic and therapeutic protein targets. To compliment the M. tuberculosis 
genome, we have profiled the membrane protein fraction of the M. tuberculosis 
H37Rv strain using an analytical platform that couples one-dimensional SDS gels 
to a microcapillary liquid chromatography-nanospray-tandem mass spectrometer. As 
a result, 739 proteins have been identified by two or more distinct peptide 
sequences and have been characterized. Interestingly, approximately 450 proteins 
represent novel identifications, 79 of which are membrane proteins and more than 
100 of which are membrane-associated proteins. The physicochemical properties of 
the identified proteins were studied in detail, and then biological functions 
were obtained by sorting them according to Sanger Institute gene function 
category. Many membrane proteins were found to be involved in the cell envelope, 
and those proteins with energy metabolic functions were also identified in this 
study.
