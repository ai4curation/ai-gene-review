Previous studies demonstrate that response gene to complement 32 (RGC-32) 
mediates transforming growth factor-β(1)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) of human renal proximal tubular cells. However, the mechanisms 
underlying RGC-32 function remain largely unknown. In the present study, we 
found that RGC-32 function in EMT is associated with Smad3. Coexpression of 
RGC-32 and Smad3, but not Smad2, induces a higher mesenchymal marker α-smooth 
muscle actin (α-SMA) protein expression as compared with RGC-32 or Smad3 alone, 
while knockdown of Smad3 using short hairpin interfering RNA blocks 
RGC-32-induced α-SMA expression. These data suggest that RGC-32 interacts with 
Smad3, but not Smad2, in the regulation of EMT. In addition to α-SMA, RGC-32 and 
Smad3 also synergistically activate the expression of extracellular matrix 
protein fibronectin and downregulate the epithelial marker E-cadherin. RGC-32 
colocalizes with Smad3 in the nuclei of renal proximal tubular cells. 
Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that Smad3, but not Smad2, physically 
interacts with RGC-32 in renal proximal tubular cells. Mechanistically, RGC-32 
and Smad3 coordinate the induction of EMT by regulating the EMT regulators Slug 
and Snail. Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that RGC-32 
interacts with Smad3 to mediate the EMT of human renal proximal tubular cells.
