We describe a novel stress-induced gene, noxin, and a knockout mouse line with 
an inactivated noxin gene. The noxin gene does not have sequelogs in the genome 
and encodes a highly serine-rich protein with predicted phosphorylation sites 
for ATM, Akt, and DNA-dependent protein kinase kinases; nuclear localization 
signals; and a Zn finger domain. noxin mRNA and protein levels are under tight 
control by the cell cycle. noxin, identified as a nitric oxide-inducible gene, 
is strongly induced by a wide range of stress signals: gamma- and UV 
irradiation, hydrogen peroxide, adriamycin, and cytokines. This induction is 
dependent on p53. Noxin accumulates in the nucleus in response to stress and, 
when ectopically expressed, Noxin arrests the cell cycle at G1; although it also 
induces p53, the cell cycle arrest function of Noxin is independent of p53 
activity. noxin knockout mice are viable and fertile; however, they have an 
enlarged heart, several altered hematopoietic parameters, and a decreased number 
of spermatids. Importantly, loss or downregulation of Noxin leads to increased 
cell death. Our results suggest that Noxin may be a component of the cell 
defense system: it is activated by various stress stimuli, helps cells to 
withdraw from cycling, and opposes apoptosis.
