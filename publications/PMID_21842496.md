OBJECTIVE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to 
muscle weakness and eventually death from respiratory failure. ALS is familial 
in about 10% of cases, with SOD1 mutations accounting for 20% of familial cases. 
Here we describe a consanguineous family segregating juvenile ALS in an 
autosomal recessive pattern and describe the genetic variant responsible for the 
disorder.
METHODS: We performed homozygosity mapping and direct sequencing to detect the 
genetic variant and tested the effect of this variant on a motor neuron-like 
cell line model (NSC34) expressing the wild-type or mutant gene.
RESULTS: We identified a shared homozygosity region in affected individuals that 
spans ~120 kbp on chromosome 9p13.3 containing 9 RefSeq genes. Sequencing the 
SIGMAR1 gene revealed a mutation affecting a highly conserved amino acid located 
in the transmembrane domain of the encoded protein, sigma-1 receptor. The 
mutated protein showed an aberrant subcellular distribution in NSC34 cells. 
Furthermore, cells expressing the mutant protein were less resistant to 
apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress.
INTERPRETATION: Sigma-1 receptors are known to have neuroprotective properties, 
and recently Sigmar1 knockout mice have been described to have motor deficiency. 
Our findings emphasize the role of sigma-1 receptors in motor neuron function 
and disease.
