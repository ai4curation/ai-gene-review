Stressed cells undergoing necrosis release molecules that acts as endogenous 
danger signals to alert and activate innate immune cells. Both HMGB1 and HSP70 
are induced in activated monocytes/macrophages and also are released from 
stressed or injured cells. We investigated whether HMGB1 and HSP70 released from 
necrotic monocytes/macrophages, can act as danger signals to mediate 
proinflammatory cytokine responses to bacterial endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS). We show that cell lysate, obtained from necrotic cells directly 
stimulates the proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses in human 
monocyte/macrophage cell line, THP-1, as revealed by the induction of TNF-alpha, 
IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression and protein production. In the presence of LPS, 
necrotic cell lysate induced a more robust increase in all three proteins. We 
found that HMGB1 and HSP70 were indeed present in the necrotic cell lysate and 
were responsible for the significant induction of the proinflammatory cytokine 
expression, as neutralization with antibodies against both proteins blocked the 
increase in the cytokine production seen after incubating LPS-stimulated cells 
with the necrotic cell lysate. We also found that the newly identified 
triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) was involved in 
mediating the HMGB1- and HSP70-induced cytokine production. Blocking TREM-1 on 
THP-1 cells with a recombinant chimera prevented the increase in cytokine 
production, while simultaneous blocking of TLR4 and TREM-1 completely abolished 
the proinflammatory response, suggesting that TREM-1 synergizes with TLR4 to 
mediate the effects of such signals from necrotic cells. In addition, blocking 
HMGB1 or HSP70 simultaneously with TREM-1 did not decrease the cytokine level 
further, confirming the involvement of TREM-1 in mediating the effect of HMGB1 
and HSP70. Although the interaction of HMGB1 and HSP70 with TREM-1 induced I 
kappa B alpha and p38 expression, both of which are required for the 
inflammatory cytokine expression, blockade of TREM-1 did not affect I kappa B 
alpha expression but markedly reduced p38 activation, as revealed by Western 
blot analysis. Together, these results demonstrate that HMGB1 and HSP70 released 
from necrotic cells function as endogenous danger signals to augment the 
proinflammatory responses in monocytes/macrophage and that TREM-1 relays such 
signals to the cytokine expression cascade. This mechanism may contribute to the 
amplification and persistence of the inflammatory response to bacterial 
infection.
