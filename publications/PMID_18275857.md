N-terminal truncation of chemokines by proteases including dipeptidyl peptidase 
(DP) IV significantly alters their biological activity; generally ablating 
cognate G-protein coupled receptor engagement and often generating potent 
receptor antagonists. DP8 is a recently recognised member of the prolyl 
oligopeptidase gene family that includes DPIV. Since DPIV is known to process 
chemokines we surveyed 27 chemokines for cleavage by DP8. We report DP8 cleavage 
of the N-terminal two residues of IP10 (CXCL10), ITAC (CXCL11) and SDF-1 
(CXCL12). This has implications for DP8 substrate specificity. Chemokine 
cleavage and inactivation may occur in vivo upon cell lysis and release of DP8 
or in the inactivation of internalized chemokine/receptor complexes.
