Nervous system development and function are tightly regulated by metabolic 
processes, including the metabolism of lipids such as fatty acids. Mutations in 
long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4) are associated with non-syndromic 
intellectual disabilities. We previously reported that Acsl, the Drosophila 
ortholog of mammalian ACSL3 and ACSL4, inhibits neuromuscular synapse growth by 
suppressing bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Here, we report that 
Acsl regulates the composition of fatty acids and membrane lipids, which in turn 
affects neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapse development. Acsl mutant brains had 
a decreased abundance of C16:1 fatty acyls; restoration of Acsl expression 
abrogated NMJ overgrowth and the increase in BMP signaling. A lipidomic analysis 
revealed that Acsl suppressed the levels of three lipid raft components in the 
brain, including mannosyl glucosylceramide (MacCer), phosphoethanolamine 
ceramide and ergosterol. The MacCer level was elevated in Acsl mutant NMJs and, 
along with sterol, promoted NMJ overgrowth, but was not associated with the 
increase in BMP signaling in the mutants. These findings suggest that Acsl 
inhibits NMJ growth by stimulating C16:1 fatty acyl production and concomitantly 
suppressing raft-associated lipid levels.
