Biochemical and genetic studies place the amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the 
center stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Although mutations in the 
APP gene lead to dominant inheritance of familial AD, the normal function of APP 
remains elusive. Here, we report that the APP family of proteins plays an 
essential role in the development of neuromuscular synapses. Mice deficient in 
APP and its homolog APP-like protein 2 (APLP2) exhibit aberrant apposition of 
presynaptic marker proteins with postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors and 
excessive nerve terminal sprouting. The number of synaptic vesicles at 
presynaptic terminals is dramatically reduced. These structural abnormalities 
are accompanied by defective neurotransmitter release and a high incidence of 
synaptic failure. Our results identify APP/APLP2 as key regulators of structure 
and function of developing neuromuscular synapses.
