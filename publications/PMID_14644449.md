Hsp105alpha and Hsp105beta are mammalian members of the Hsp105/110 family, a 
diverged subgroup of the Hsp70 family. Here, we show that Hsp105alpha and 
Hsp105beta bind non-native protein through the beta-sheet domain and suppress 
the aggregation of heat-denatured protein in the presence of ADP rather than 
ATP. In contrast, Hsc70/Hsp40 suppressed the aggregation of heat-denatured 
protein in the presence of ATP rather than ADP. Furthermore, the overexpression 
of Hsp105alpha but not Hsp70 in COS-7 cells rescued the inactivation of 
luciferase caused by ATP depletion. Thus, Hsp105/110 family proteins are 
suggested to function as a substitute for Hsp70 family proteins to suppress the 
aggregation of denatured proteins in cells under severe stress, in which the 
cellular ATP level decreases markedly.
