Gamma-herpesviruses (gammaHVs), including important human pathogens such as 
Epstein Barr virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated HV, and the murine gammaHV68, 
encode homologs of the antiapoptotic, cellular Bcl-2 (cBcl-2) to promote viral 
replication and pathogenesis. The precise molecular details by which these 
proteins function in viral infection are poorly understood. Autophagy, a 
lysosomal degradation pathway, is inhibited by the interaction of cBcl-2s with a 
key autophagy effector, Beclin 1, and can also be inhibited by gammaHV Bcl-2s. 
Here we investigate the gammaHV68 M11-Beclin 1 interaction in atomic detail, 
using biochemical and structural approaches. We show that the Beclin 1 BH3 
domain is the primary determinant of binding to M11 and other Bcl-2s, and this 
domain binds in a hydrophobic groove on M11, reminiscent of the binding of 
different BH3 domains to other Bcl-2s. Unexpectedly, regions outside of, but 
contiguous with, the Beclin 1 BH3 domain also contribute to this interaction. We 
find that M11 binds to Beclin 1 more strongly than do KSHV Bcl-2 or cBcl-2. 
Further, the differential affinity of M11 for different BH3 domains is caused by 
subtle, yet significant, variations in the atomic details of each interaction. 
Consistent with our structural analysis, we find that Beclin 1 residues L116 and 
F123, and M11 residue pairs G86 + R87 and Y60 + L74, are required for M11 to 
bind to Beclin 1 and downregulate autophagy. Thus, our results suggest that M11 
inhibits autophagy through a mechanism that involves the binding of the Beclin 1 
BH3 domain in the M11 hydrophobic surface groove.
