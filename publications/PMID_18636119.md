The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a transmembrane protein that 
belongs to the family of adhesion molecules. In the postnatal heart, it is 
localized predominantly at the intercalated disc, where its function is not 
known. Here, we demonstrate that a first degree or complete block of 
atrioventricular (AV) conduction developed in the absence of CAR in the adult 
mouse heart and that prolongation of AV conduction occurred in the embryonic 
heart of the global CAR-KO mouse. In the cardiac-specific CAR-KO (CAR-cKO) 
mouse, we observed the loss of connexin 45 localization to the cell-cell 
junctions of the AV node but preservation of connexin 40 and 43 in contracting 
myocardial cells and connexin 30.2 in the AV node. There was also a marked 
decrease in beta-catenin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) localization to the 
intercalated discs of CAR-cKO mouse hearts at 8 weeks before the mice developed 
cardiomyopathy at 21 weeks of age. We also found that CAR formed a complex with 
connexin 45 via its PSD-95/DigA/ZO-1-binding (PDZ-binding) motifs. We conclude 
that CAR expression is required for normal AV-node conduction and cardiac 
function. Furthermore, localization of connexin 45 at the AV-node cell-cell 
junction and of beta-catenin and ZO-1 at the ventricular intercalated disc are 
dependent on CAR.

Abstract

The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the family of adhesion molecules. In the postnatal heart, it is localized predominantly at the intercalated disc, where its function is not known. Here, we demonstrate that a first degree or complete block of atrioventricular (AV) conduction developed in the absence of CAR in the adult mouse heart and that prolongation of AV conduction occurred in the embryonic heart of the global CAR-KO mouse. In the cardiac-specific CAR-KO (CAR-cKO) mouse, we observed the loss of connexin 45 localization to the cell-cell junctions of the AV node but preservation of connexin 40 and 43 in contracting myocardial cells and connexin 30.2 in the AV node. There was also a marked decrease in β-catenin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) localization to the intercalated discs of CAR-cKO mouse hearts at 8 weeks before the mice developed cardiomyopathy at 21 weeks of age. We also found that CAR formed a complex with connexin 45 via its PSD-95/DigA/ZO-1–binding (PDZ-binding) motifs. We conclude that CAR expression is required for normal AV-node conduction and cardiac function. Furthermore, localization of connexin 45 at the AV-node cell-cell junction and of β-catenin and ZO-1 at the ventricular intercalated disc are dependent on CAR.

Introduction

The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) was initially identified as a common receptor of the viruses for which it was named ( 1 , 2 ). It is expressed in various organs including the heart and is indispensable for normal embryonic development ( 3 – 5 ). In the adult heart, there is considerable data on the role of CAR as a viral receptor in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis; however, the physiological role of CAR in the adult heart is less clear.

CAR is a transmembrane protein with 2 extracellular immunoglobulin domains that belongs to the family of intercellular adhesion molecules. The extracellular region of CAR is thought to bind to another CAR molecule on an adjacent cell as an antiparallel homodimer ( 6 ). The intracellular domain of CAR contains a carboxyterminal hydrophobic peptide that interacts with PSD-95/DigA/ZO-1 (PDZ; ZO-1, zonula occludens-1) domain–containing proteins such as ZO-1 ( 7 , 8 ). During embryonic development, CAR is expressed by E7, and in neonatal mice, CAR is expressed at relatively high levels in the heart ( 3 ). After 1 week of age, the majority of CAR is localized at the myocyte-myocyte junctional complex known as the intercalated disc ( 9 ).

Of the conduction system components, the atrioventricular (AV) node has a unique role in delaying conduction of the electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricle. When AV-node function is impaired, there is an abnormal delay in or absence of conduction from the atria to the ventricles. The gap junctions that are found in the cell-to-cell contacts between AV-nodal cells and in the intercalated discs of cardiac myocytes are important for impulse propagation ( 10 , 11 ). There are 4 principal connexins that are found in the gap junctions of the adult heart (connexins 40, 43, 45, and 30.2) ( 12 ). Connexins 45 and 30.2 are the predominant connexins that are known to be expressed in regions of the AV-nodal tissue ( 13 , 14 ).

In this manuscript, we hypothesize that disruption of CAR affects the function of intercalated discs in the adult heart and that it may affect gap junctions in the AV node and the intercalated discs of cardiac myocytes. We found that cardiac-specific KO of CAR led to abnormal propagation of electrical conduction in the AV node, which was associated with decrease in connexin 45 expression on the cell membrane. At later time points, the mice developed cardiomyopathy associated with focal disorganization of the intercalated disc ultrastructure and loss of localization of β-catenin and ZO-1 in the cardiac myocytes. Colocalization of CAR, ZO-1, and connexin 45 in a protein complex requires the PDZ-binding motif on CAR and connexin 45. These data demonstrate the importance of CAR in the normal adult heart.

Discussion

Our findings demonstrate that CAR is required for normal function of the AV node in both the adult and embryonic hearts and for normal ventricular function with aging. Since connexin 45 is a prominent connexin expressed in the compact AV node ( 21 ), the loss of connexin 45 in the cell-cell contacts of the AV node provides a sound explanation for why there is abnormal AV conduction in hearts that lack CAR. While the conduction system also expresses connexin 30.2, it appears that it is not sufficient to maintain normal AV conduction. This may be related to its very slow conduction properties ( 11 ).

Persistent expression and localization of connexins 40 and 43 in other conduction and myocardial cells likely accounts for the normal conduction in the atria and the ventricles as determined by optical mapping. The AV-node dysfunction identified occurs in the absence of detectable myocardial disease, but it is also important to note that the deficiency of CAR in the heart causes a relatively late onset cardiomyopathy identified at 21 weeks of age. The cardiomyopathy is associated with loss of β-catenin and ZO-1 in the cardiomyocyte intercalated disc. Immunoprecipitation experiments combined with the in vivo pathophysiologic effects of CAR disruption indicate that CAR and connexin 45 are part of a previously unrecognized protein complex and that CAR also interacts with β-catenin and the PDZ domain–containing protein ZO-1.

Other adhesion molecules have been shown to have a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the intercalated disc. For example, the global KO of N-cadherin, the stereotypical fascia adherens intercalated disc adhesion molecule, results in midgestational embryonic lethality associated with a severe cardiovascular defect ( 22 ). Loss of N-cadherin in the adult cardiac myocyte was reported to result in loss of the intercalated disc structure ( 23 – 25 ). This was accompanied by a loss of connexins 43 and 40, β- and α-catenin, and p120. The effects on connexin 45 were not reported. N-cadherin deficiency resulted in inducible atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and a decrease in the conduction velocity in the ventricle. Altogether, these data have been interpreted to indicate that N-cadherin is required for formation of the intercalated disc and that in its absence there is a generalized loss of intercalated disc structure and localization of intercalated disc proteins. This includes normal formation of the gap junction ( 26 ). The loss of CAR has an important effect on the intercalated disc, but it is clearly distinct from that observed with N-cadherin deficiency.

While it is clear that N-cadherin interacts with intracellular proteins, it is not clear whether it is part of a connexin-containing protein complex or whether the loss of N-cadherin disrupts the structure of the intercalated disc to the point that connexins can no longer associate with the intercalated disc. Using pull-down experiments and mutational analysis, the current data indicate that CAR is a part of a protein complex that includes connexin 45. The integrity of this interaction requires the PDZ-binding motif at the carboxy terminus of CAR. With loss of CAR, there is loss of connexin 45, ZO-1, and β-catenin localization to the cell-cell contacts of the AV node and loss of β-catenin and ZO-1 to the intercalated disc. Loss of CAR does not result in loss of the intercalated disc structure as has been reported with deficiency of N-cadherin.

Given the localization of CAR to the tight junction of epithelial cells, it might be expected that CAR would be localized to the fascia adherens in the intercalated disc. However, the existence of a protein complex that includes CAR and connexin 45 indicates that CAR may be juxtaposed to or within the gap junction of the AV node. There are data showing that protein localization to the distinct compartments of the intercalated disc are not as clear as in other cell types ( 27 ). Another point for consideration is that the AV-nodal cells have a different morphology than myocardial cells and the cell-cell junctions are structurally distinct from those of the contractile myocardial cells ( 21 ). Nevertheless, the data indicate that CAR and connexin 45 are part of a protein complex and that CAR expression is required for localization of connexin 45, ZO-1, and β-catenin.

Previous reports have demonstrated that global KO of connexin 45 leads to embryonic lethality at E9.5–E10.5, a time point that is similar to that of global CAR KO. Prior to death, there is evidence of an AV-conduction abnormality ( 28 ). Similarly, a striated muscle-specific connexin 45 KO mouse has abnormal AV conduction. The AV conduction abnormality in the global CAR-KO embryo has similarities to the connexin 45 KO hearts and suggests the possibility that AV-conduction abnormalities could contribute significantly to the embryonic lethality in the absence of CAR as was demonstrated in the cardiac-specific connexin 45 KO mice ( 29 ). Differences in the timing of expression during development for the different promoters that have been used to disrupt CAR or connexin 45 in the heart may explain why the CAR-cKO mice described herein did not die during embryonic development, while mice in which disruption of CAR was accomplished using the cardiac troponin T-CRE transgene died during development in a manner similar to that of global CAR-KO mice ( 5 ).

It was initially unexpected that CAR-cKO mice had AV block without evidence of conduction abnormalities in the atria or ventricle. The data indicate that an impulse arises normally in or near the SA node of the CAR-cKO atria and that it propagates normally to the AV node where the impulse is blocked or delayed. An escape impulse originating in the AV node or His bundle (below the area of block in the AV node) stimulates a normal pattern of depolarization in the ventricle through both the right and left bundle branches. These findings indicate that the cardiac-specific deletion of CAR in the cardiac myocyte does not significantly affect propagation of the electrical impulse in the cell-cell contacts of the His-Purkinje system or the intercalated discs of the cardiac myocytes and that the most significant effect on the electrical conduction through the intercalated discs occurs at the level of the AV node in the CAR-cKO mice. While we did not detect an abnormality in SA-nodal function, this was not evaluated extensively.

The cytoskeletal adaptor protein ZO-1 has been previously shown to bind to the carboxyterminal PDZ-binding motif of CAR ( 7 , 30 ) as well as to the carboxyl terminus of connexin 43. It has also been shown that ZO-1 colocalizes with N-cadherin. The last 5 amino acids (aa 378–382) of connexin 43 are required for ZO-1 binding in vitro when introduced into a connexin 43–deficient MDCK cell line. However, those amino acids are not essential for colocalization of connexin 43 and ZO-1 in a cell membrane ( 31 ). That may explain why in the CAR-cKO mice, ZO-1 was disrupted in the intercalated disc but connexin 43 had a similar pattern of localization in the intercalated disc as in the presence of CAR. In addition, it has been previously shown that KO of connexin 43 did not affect localization of ZO-1 in Rat-1 cells ( 32 ). Our findings indicate that the CAR and ZO-1 protein complex is required to localize connexin 45 to the cell-cell junction of AV-nodal tissue but that they are not required for localization of connexins 40 and 43 in the intercalated disc.

It is notable that there is loss of β-catenin localization in the intercalated disc of the CAR-deficient hearts. Disruption of β-catenin has been demonstrated to cause ventricular dysfunction and attenuated hypertrophic response ( 17 ). It is not known whether this phenotype is due to the structural effects of the absence of β-catenin or alterations in β-catenin signaling. In our results, CAR deficiency in the heart also leads to a decrease in amount and mislocalization of β-catenin and a cardiomyopathy. These data demonstrate that CAR is required for localization of β-catenin to the adult heart intercalated disc and its mislocalization may be related to the development of cardiomyopathy. It is not clear why β-catenin expression and localization were maintained in the global CAR-deficient embryo in a previous report ( 4 ).

Altogether these data define a novel protein complex in which an adhesion protein localized to the cell-cell junctions of the AV node and intercalated discs of working myocardium is required for proper localization of connexin 45, β-catenin, and ZO-1. CAR is also required for normal AV-node function at early time points and for normal cardiac function as the heart ages. While there are changes noted in the intercalated discs, the effect on the intercalated disc is clearly less than that observed with loss of N-cadherin. These findings demonstrate a clear role for CAR in the heart and have implications for the identification of novel therapeutic and diagnostic strategies for AV block and ventricular dysfunction in genetic and acquired diseases.
