Terminal deletions of chromosome 10p result in a DiGeorge-like phenotype that 
includes hypoparathyroidism, heart defects, immune deficiency, deafness and 
renal malformations. Studies in patients with 10p deletions have defined two 
non-overlapping regions that contribute to this complex phenotype. These are the 
DiGeorge critical region II (refs 1, 2), which is located on 10p13-14, and the 
region for the hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, renal anomaly (HDR) 
syndrome (Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 146255), which is located more 
telomeric (10p14-10pter). We have performed deletion-mapping studies in two HDR 
patients, and here we define a critical 200-kilobase region which contains the 
GATA3 gene. This gene belongs to a family of zinc-finger transcription factors 
that are involved in vertebrate embryonic development. Investigation for GATA3 
mutations in three other HDR probands identified one nonsense mutation and two 
intragenic deletions that predicted a loss of function, as confirmed by absence 
of DNA binding by the mutant GATA3 protein. These results show that GATA3 is 
essential in the embryonic development of the parathyroids, auditory system and 
kidneys, and indicate that other GATA family members may be involved in the 
aetiology of human malformations.
