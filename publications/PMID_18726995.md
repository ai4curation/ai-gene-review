Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) treatment of dermal microvascular endothelial cells (MvEC) has been shown to upregulate Fas ligand (FasL) and to induce apoptosis by a mechanism that requires caspase-8 activity. We have examined the potential anti-angiogenic effects of TSP-1 on primary human brain MvEC.

TSP-1 treatment for 17 h induced caspase-3 cleavage that required caspase-8 activity and the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1). We did not find a requirement for Fas, or the tumor necrosis-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors (TRAIL-R) 1 and 2. We confirmed the findings using caspase inhibitors, blocking antibodies and small interfering RNA (siRNA). Further analysis indicated that the TSP-1 induction of caspase-3 cleavage of primary human brain MvEC adherent to collagen required the synthesis of new message and protein, and that TSP-1 induced the expression of TNFα mRNA and protein. Consistent with these findings, when the primary human brain MvEC were propagated on collagen gels mAb anti-TNF-R1 reversed the inhibitory effect, in part, of TSP-1 on tube formation and branching. These data identify a novel mechanism whereby TSP-1 can inhibit angiogenesis-through induction of apoptosis in a process mediated by TNF-R1.

Introduction

It is well established that angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and that inhibition of angiogenesis can be an effective strategy for the treatment of solid tumors when combined with other therapy ( Folkman, 2007 ). Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) can act as an anti-angiogenic agent as demonstrated using isolated non-brain microvascular endothelial cells (MvEC) and in animals bearing tumors ( Dawson et al., 1997 ; Reiher et al., 2002 ). TSP-1-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis involving dermal MvEC requires the transmembrane receptor, CD36 ( Dawson et al., 1997 ; Pearce et al., 1995 ; Jimenez et al., 2000 ; Simantov and Silverstein, 2003 ), and this has been confirmed in a CD36-null mouse model ( Febbraio et al., 2002 ). CD36, which is expressed on endothelial and other cells, interacts with the CSVTCG and GVITRIR peptides found in the type 1 repeat domain of TSP-1 ( Dawson et al., 1997 ; Pearce et al., 1995 ). Type 1 TSP-1 peptides that correspond to the CD36 binding site can inhibit angiogenesis ( Dawson et al., 1999 ; Iruela-Arispe et al., 1999 ; Tolsma et al., 1993 ) and the circulating histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRGP), which contains a CD36-like TSP binding domain, has been shown to promote angiogenesis by blocking the TSP-1-CD36 interaction ( Simantov et al., 2001 ; Silverstein and Febbraio, 2007 ).

It is thought that several different anti-angiogenic agents, including TSP-1, act by inducing apoptosis of MvECs ( Jimenez et al., 2000 ; LaVallee et al., 2003 ; Panka and Mier, 2003 ; Volpert et al., 2002 ). Notably, TSP-1-induced apoptosis of MvECs associated with malignant melanoma cells has been shown in vivo in a subcutaneous xenograft model ( Jimenez et al., 2000 ). Several studies have demonstrated that anti-angiogenic agents induce apoptosis of MvECs by upregulating the levels of a death receptor or its ligand and that the Fas death receptor system is a common target ( LaVallee et al., 2003 ; Panka and Mier, 2003 ; Volpert et al., 2002 ). TSP-1-induced apoptosis of dermal MvECs propagated as monolayers on gelatin, which requires caspase-8 activity, is associated with upregulation of Fas ligand (FasL) ( Volpert et al., 2002 ) and the inhibitory effect of TSP-1 in a corneal neovascularization assay requires FasL and Fas ( Volpert et al., 2002 ). In addition, it has been shown that pigment epithelial-derived factor induces the expression of FasL on the cell surface of dermal MvEC ( Volpert et al., 2002 ) and canstatin induces FasL expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( Panka and Mier, 2003 ). The involvement of death receptors other than Fas in apoptosis induced by anti-angiogenic agents has been reported, however. For example, 2-methoxyestradiol upregulates TRAIL-R2 (also known as DR5) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( LaVallee et al., 2003 ), interleukin-18 stimulation of liver endothelial cells upregulates TNF-R1 expression, thereby promoting TNFα-induced apoptosis ( Marino and Cardier, 2003 ), and the inhibition of angiogenesis observed on endostatin treatment in the corneal neovascularization assay occurs independently of Fas or FasL ( Volpert et al., 2002 ).

Although the anti-angiogenic effects of TSP-1 currently are thought to be mediated by apoptosis, other mechanisms have been implicated. For example, it has been reported that the anti-angiogenic effect of TSP-1 on dermal MvECs propagated as a monolayer on gelatin is mediated by caspase-independent inhibition of cell cycle progression ( Armstrong et al., 2002 ); however, neither the requirement for CD36 nor the identity of the receptor mediating this effect has been described. TSP-1 also may promote an anti-angiogenic effect by affecting the levels of its binding partner, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 ( Armstrong and Bornstein, 2003 ; Yang Z et al., 2001 ; Bein and Simons, 2000 ; Rodriguez-Manzaneque et al., 2001 ). In the case of TSP-2, we have shown that its anti-invasive effect on mouse brain MvEC is due to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1)-mediated internalization of a complex of MMP-2 and TSP-2 ( Fears et al., 2005 ).

To date, the mechanisms by which TSP-1 exerts its anti-angiogenesis effects have been studied using MvECs derived from sources other than the brain. We therefore examined the effects of TSP-1 on primary human brain MvEC grown as monolayer cultures on type 1 collagen. These studies confirmed that TSP-1 induces apoptosis of these cells in a CD36-dependent manner; however, in contrast to the reports of studies using dermal MvECs ( Jimenez et al., 2000 ; Volpert et al., 2002 ; Nor et al., 2000 ), we found that the TSP-1-induced apoptosis required expression of TNF-R1 and that TSP-1 induced the expression of TNFα. Analysis of tube formation and branching of bFGF-stimulated human brain MvEC propagated on collagen gels confirmed that TSP-1 has an anti-angiogenic effect against these cells which could be reversed, in part, by pretreatment with an inhibitory mAb directed toward TNF-R1. These analyses of human brain MvEC reveal a novel mechanism in which the pro-apoptotic/anti-angiogenic effect of TSP-1 are mediated by TNF-R1.

Discussion

Our findings indicate that TSP-1 can induce apoptosis and inhibit tubular morphogenesis of human brain MvEC adherent as a monolayer to type 1 collagen in a dose- and time-dependent manner. As has been described in other systems ( Dawson et al., 1997 ; Jimenez et al., 2000 ), the TSP-1-mediated apoptosis is dependent on CD36. Studies of TSP-1-induced apoptosis using other types of human MvEC have implicated Fas rather than TNF-R1. We found, however, that the apoptosis of the primary human brain MvEC in monolayer culture appears to be mediated through the TNF-R1 death receptor as it requires expression of this receptor. Moreover, the mechanism appears to involve induction of the expression of TNFα by TSP-1. Although TNF-R1 has been implicated previously in interleukin-18-enhanced stimulation of liver endothelial cell apoptosis ( Marino and Cardier, 2003 ), it has not been implicated previously in TSP-1-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis.

Our data indicate the involvement of a caspase-8-mediated extrinsic pathway of apoptosis in TSP-1-mediated apoptosis of primary human brain MvEC, which implicates an initiating signal involving death receptors containing death domains that can recruit caspase-8 into the death inducing signaling complex. Such complexes include Fas, DR4 and DR5, as well as TNF-R1 (reviewed in ( Thornburn, 2004 ; Mocellin et al., 2005 )), all of which are expressed on human brain MvEC ( Marino and Cardier, 2003 ; Janin et al., 2002 ; Secchiero et al., 2003 ; Choi and Benveniste, 2004 ). Although Fas has been implicated in TSP-1-induced apoptosis of MvEC obtained from skin and in the corneal neovascularization assay ( Jimenez et al., 2000 ), we were unable to inhibit TSP-1-induced caspase-3 cleavage through the addition of a Fas blocking antibody, a recombinant Fas decoy receptor, or the use of Fas siRNA in our system. These findings underscore the complexity of anti-angiogenic mechanisms and the factors that determine which mechanism is utilized. The possibility that the Fas receptor expressed on the human brain MvECs is not functional was ruled out as we were able to induce apoptosis by addition of exogenous FasL and the work of others indicates that mouse brain MvEC are sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis in vivo ( Janin et al., 2002 ).

The TSP-1 induction of caspase-3 cleavage in the brain MvEC exhibited latency as has been described for TSP-1-induced death-receptor-mediated apoptosis in dermal MvEC ( Jimenez et al., 2000 ; Volpert et al., 2002 ). The time lapse that occurred prior to the observation of maximal apoptosis (17 h) post-TSP-1 treatment of the human brain MvEC in type 1 collagen-adherent monolayers was somewhat longer than that reported for TSP-1 treated dermal MvEC (4 h) ( Volpert et al., 2002 ). It is therefore possible that the pretreatment of the dermal MvEC cells with either a cytokine or a growth factor that was used to upregulate Fas expression may have potentiated the Fas-mediated apoptotic response. We found that the latency is associated with a requirement for new mRNA transcription, which has not been reported previously, as well as confirming a requirement for new protein translation ( Jimenez et al., 2000 ). Moreover, analysis of the expression of the death receptor ligands revealed enhanced expression of TNFα mRNA as well as soluble and cellular TNFα protein. Although TSP-1 treatment resulted in elevated expression of FasL and TRAIL mRNAs in the brain MvEC, soluble FasL and TRAIL were not detectable in the conditioned media. The levels of TNF-R1 and Fas protein in cell lysates, as determined by immunoblotting, were unaffected by TSP-1 treatment (T.A. Rege and C.L. Gladson, unpublished data). This ability of TSP-1 to upregulate TNFα suggests a mechanism by which TSP-1 can promote its apoptotic effect in the human brain MvEC. Interestingly, it has been reported that TNFα can induce hemorrhagic necrosis of vascular tumors in some tumor models. This appears to occur through a direct, dose-dependent effect of TNFα on the tumor endothelial cells as there is a requirement for expression of TNF-R1 on the endothelial cells (( Stoelcker et al., 2000 ); reviewed in ( Mocellin et al., 2005 )). The apparent selectivity of the TNFα-induced cytotoxicity for the tumor vasculature as compared to its effects on the normal tissue vasculature in the above studies is of interest in terms of the development of therapeutic strategies, but the mechanisms that contribute to this selectivity remain unclear. As we found that TSP-1 induced apoptosis requires CD36, the future elucidation of the mechanism that links CD36 engagement to the upregulation of TNFα is therefore of great interest.

Other investigators recently reported that a set of anti-angiogenic genes is induced on treatment of dermal MvEC with a single anti-angiogenesis agent, endostatin ( Abdollahi et al., 2004 ). It is therefore possible that TSP-1 induces a set of pro-death genes, including TNFα, FasL and TRAIL as we observed, but that the environmental and cellular context dictates the translation of protein. Thus, the association of Fas with the TSP-1-induced apoptosis of the dermal MvEC ( Volpert et al., 2002 ) may have been due to the promotion of FasL and Fas expression by cytokine pre-stimulation of the dermal MvEC prior to TSP-1 stimulation, which would have resulted in preferential priming of the cells such that the Fas death receptor pathway is activated. As organ-specific endothelial cell heterogeneity has been reported, it also is possible that the origin of the endothelial cells and their microenvironment may affect the generation of competent signals ( St.Croix et al., 2000 ). The body of evidence that indicates that the Fas receptor is not silenced on the primary human brain MvEC suggests that any differences in the responses of the brain MvEC and dermal MvEC to TSP-1 would have to lie in the signaling pathway(s) from CD36 to the death receptor. TSP-1 is a homotrimeric protein with a multi-domain structure (reviewed in ( Carlson et al., 2008 )) that can interact with several proteins that are known to play critical roles in the interactions of the cell with the extracellular matrix and the regulation of cell growth and migration, as well as proteins that can regulate the interactions of TSP-1 with these proteins. Thus, the function of TSP-1 and its mechanisms of action are most likely highly susceptible to the extracellular environment of the cell and the specific type of cell. Indeed, we have shown recently that low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1) mediates the anti-invasive effect of TSP-2 in mouse brain MvEC adherent to Matrigel-coated filters through internalization of a TSP-2-MMP-2 complex ( Fears et al., 2005 ).

Our studies do not rule out the possibility that the anti-angiogenic effects of TSP-1 may be mediated, at least in part, by pathways other than death receptor-mediated apoptosis. For example, TSP-1 may induce cross-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Although mechanisms other than apoptosis have been proposed ( Armstrong et al., 2002 ), we found that TSP-1 treatment did not significantly alter DNA synthesis, as estimated by tritiated-thymidine incorporation, or cell cycle progression, as assessed by FACS analysis of propidium iodine staining of primary human brain MvEC grown as monolayers, although a cocktail of growth factors clearly induced cell cycle progression (T.A. Rege and C.L. Gladson, unpublished data).

The involvement of TNF-R1 in the anti-angiogenic effects of TSP-1 on brain MvEC was confirmed on treatment of bFGF-stimulated MvEC in collagen gels in which an anti-TNF-R1 monoclonal antibody was capable of reversing significantly TSP-1 inhibition of tube formation and branching. We also confirmed that the engagement of CD36 was necessary for TSP-1 inhibition of tubular morphogenesis in this model. Thus, our results suggest a novel mechanism whereby TNF-R1 mediates the pro-apoptotic/anti-angiogenic effect of TSP-1 in primary human brain MvEC.
