The release of amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) may 
be triggered by extracellular cues through gamma-secretase-dependent cleavage. 
AICD binds to Fe65, which may have a role in AICD-dependent signalling; however, 
the functional ligand has not been characterized. In this study, we have 
identified TAG1 as a functional ligand of APP. We found that, through an 
extracellular interaction with APP, TAG1 increased AICD release and triggered 
Fe65-dependent activity in a gamma-secretase-dependent manner. TAG1, APP and 
Fe65 colocalized in the neural stem cell niche of the fetal ventricular zone. 
Neural precursor cells from TAG1-/-, APP-/- and TAG1-/-;APP-/- mice had 
aberrantly enhanced neurogenesis, which was significantly reversed in TAG1-/- 
mice by TAG1 or AICD but not by AICD mutated at the Fe65 binding site. Notably, 
TAG1 reduced normal neurogenesis in Fe65+/+ mice. Abnormally enhanced 
neurogenesis also occurred in Fe65-/- mice but could not be reversed by TAG1. 
These results describe a TAG1-APP signalling pathway that negatively modulates 
neurogenesis through Fe65.
