The Bacillus subtilis Zur protein regulates zinc homeostasis by repressing at 
least 10 genes in response to zinc sufficiency. One of these genes, yciC, 
encodes an abundant protein postulated to function as a metallochaperone. Here, 
we used a genetic approach to identify the cis-acting elements and trans-acting 
factors contributing to the tight repression of yciC. Initial studies led to the 
identification of only trans-acting mutations, and, when the selection was 
repeated using a transposon library, all recovered mutants contained 
insertionally inactivated zur. Using a zur merodiploid strain, we obtained two 
cis-acting mutations that contained large deletions in the yciC regulatory 
region. We demonstrate that the yciC regulatory region contains two functional 
Zur boxes: a primary site (C2) overlapping a sigma(A) promoter approximately 200 
bp upstream of yciC and a second site near the translational start point (C1). 
Zur binds to both of these sites to mediate strong, zinc-dependent repression of 
yciC. Deletion studies indicate that either Zur box is sufficient for 
repression, although repression by Zur bound to C2 is more efficient. Binding 
studies demonstrate that both sites bind Zur with high affinity. Sequence 
alignment of these and previously described Zur boxes suggest that Zur 
recognizes a more extended operator than other Fur family members. We used 
synthetic oligonucleotides to identify bases critical for DNA binding by Zur. 
Unlike Fur and PerR, which bind efficiently to sequences containing a core 7-1-7 
repeat element, Zur requires a 9-1-9 inverted repeat for high-affinity binding.

Abstract

The Bacillus subtilis Zur protein regulates zinc homeostasis by repressing at least 10 genes in response to zinc sufficiency. One of these genes, yciC , encodes an abundant protein postulated to function as a metallochaperone. Here, we used a genetic approach to identify the cis -acting elements and trans -acting factors contributing to the tight repression of yciC . Initial studies led to the identification of only trans -acting mutations, and, when the selection was repeated using a transposon library, all recovered mutants contained insertionally inactivated zur . Using a zur merodiploid strain, we obtained two cis -acting mutations that contained large deletions in the yciC regulatory region. We demonstrate that the yciC regulatory region contains two functional Zur boxes: a primary site (C2) overlapping a σ A promoter ∼200 bp upstream of yciC and a second site near the translational start point (C1). Zur binds to both of these sites to mediate strong, zinc-dependent repression of yciC . Deletion studies indicate that either Zur box is sufficient for repression, although repression by Zur bound to C2 is more efficient. Binding studies demonstrate that both sites bind Zur with high affinity. Sequence alignment of these and previously described Zur boxes suggest that Zur recognizes a more extended operator than other Fur family members. We used synthetic oligonucleotides to identify bases critical for DNA binding by Zur. Unlike Fur and PerR, which bind efficiently to sequences containing a core 7-1-7 repeat element, Zur requires a 9-1-9 inverted repeat for high-affinity binding.
