Regulation of nuclear mRNA export is critical for proper eukaryotic gene 
expression. A key step in this process is the directional translocation of 
mRNA-ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) 
that are embedded in the nuclear envelope. Our previous studies in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae defined an in vivo role for inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) and 
NPC-associated Gle1 in mRNA export. Here, we show that Gle1 and InsP6 act 
together to stimulate the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of the essential 
DEAD-box protein Dbp5. Overexpression of DBP5 specifically suppressed mRNA 
export and growth defects of an ipk1 nup42 mutant defective in InsP6 production 
and Gle1 localization. In vitro kinetic analysis showed that InsP6 significantly 
increased Dbp5 ATPase activity in a Gle1-dependent manner and lowered the 
effective RNA concentration for half-maximal ATPase activity. Gle1 alone had 
minimal effects. Maximal InsP6 binding required both Dbp5 and Gle1. It has been 
suggested that Dbp5 requires unidentified cofactors. We now propose that Dbp5 
activation at NPCs requires Gle1 and InsP6. This would facilitate spatial 
control of the remodelling of mRNP protein composition during directional 
transport and provide energy to power transport cycles.
