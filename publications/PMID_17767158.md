Transcriptional readout downstream of canonical Wnt signaling is known to be 
mediated by beta-catenin activation of well-described targets, but potential 
transcriptional readout in response to noncanonical Wnt signaling remains poorly 
understood. Here, we define a transcriptional pathway important in noncanonical 
Wnt signaling. We have found that Wnt11 is a direct target of a canonical 
beta-catenin pathway in developing heart and that Wnt11 mutants show cardiac 
outflow tract defects. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence thatWnt11 
signaling affects extracellular matrix composition, cytoskeletal rearrangements 
and polarized cell movement required for morphogenesis of the cardiac outflow 
tract. Notably, transforming growth factor beta2 (TGFbeta2), a key effector of 
organ morphogenesis, is regulated by Wnt11-mediated noncanonical signaling in 
developing heart and somites via one or more activating transcription factor 
(ATF)/cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) family members. Thus, 
we propose that transcriptional readout mediated at least in part by a Wnt11 --> 
ATF/CREB --> TGFbeta2 pathway is critical in regulating morphogenesis in 
response to noncanonical Wnt signaling.

Abstract

Transcriptional readout downstream of canonical Wnt signaling is known to be mediated by β-catenin activation of well-described targets, but potential transcriptional readout in response to noncanonical Wnt signaling remains poorly understood. Here, we define a transcriptional pathway important in noncanonical Wnt signaling. We have found that Wnt11 is a direct target of a canonical β-catenin pathway in developing heart and that Wnt11 mutants show cardiac outflow tract defects. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence that Wnt11 signaling affects extracellular matrix composition, cytoskeletal rearrangements and polarized cell movement required for morphogenesis of the cardiac outflow tract. Notably, transforming growth factor β2 (TGFβ2), a key effector of organ morphogenesis, is regulated by Wnt11-mediated noncanonical signaling in developing heart and somites via one or more activating transcription factor (ATF)/cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) family members. Thus, we propose that transcriptional readout mediated at least in part by a Wnt11→ATF/CREB→TGFβ2 pathway is critical in regulating morphogenesis in response to noncanonical Wnt signaling.

DISCUSSION

We have identified Wnt11 as the noncanonical Wnt implicated in outflow tract morphogenesis and have found that activation of Tgfb2 transcription mediated by ATF/CREB is regulated by noncanonical Wnt signaling. This pathway operates in both heart and somite development in mammals, suggesting the general significance of the pathway we have defined. We have also provided evidence that disruption of outflow tract morphology observed in Wnt11-deficient embryos is associated with a number of specific changes in cytoarchitecture of the myocardial wall, the endocardium of the outflow tract and the cardiac outflow tract cushions, as well as with lack of myocardialization of the outflow tract septum. Observed changes in cytoarchitecture are likely to have adverse effects on normal cell migration and other behaviors associated with morphogenesis, resulting in abnormal outflow tract remodeling. These findings are consistent with functional studies of the role of Wnt11-R in Xenopus laevis heart morphogenesis 43 . Although Wnt11, TGFβ2 and the ATF2 family are required in vivo for cardiac morphogenesis, family redundancy in mouse embryos may obscure a requirement for this pathway in normal somite morphogenesis, as Wnt5A and Wnt11 are coexpressed in the dermomyotome (data not shown), like TGFβ2 and TGFβ3 (ref. 44 ). Wnt11 is required for normal somite morphogenesis in the chick, where Wnt5A is not coexpressed 16 . Our results also highlight a requirement for Wnt11 in the integration and crosstalk between three major signaling pathways—the canonical Wnt pathway, the noncanonical Wnt pathway and TGFβ signaling—in achieving correct cardiac outflow tract morphogenesis.
