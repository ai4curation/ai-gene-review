Enzymatic transformations of macromolecular substrates such as DNA repair 
enzyme/DNA transformations are commonly interpreted primarily by active-site 
functional-group chemistry that ignores their extensive interfaces. Yet human 
uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), an archetypical enzyme that initiates DNA 
base-excision repair, efficiently excises the damaged base uracil resulting from 
cytosine deamination even when active-site functional groups are deleted by 
mutagenesis. The 1.8-A resolution substrate analogue and 2.0-A resolution 
cleaved product cocrystal structures of UDG bound to double-stranded DNA suggest 
enzyme-DNA substrate-binding energy from the macromolecular interface is 
funneled into catalytic power at the active site. The architecturally stabilized 
closing of UDG enforces distortions of the uracil and deoxyribose in the 
flipped-out nucleotide substrate that are relieved by glycosylic bond cleavage 
in the product complex. This experimentally defined substrate stereochemistry 
implies the enzyme alters the orientation of three orthogonal electron orbitals 
to favor electron transpositions for glycosylic bond cleavage. By revealing the 
coupling of this anomeric effect to a delocalization of the glycosylic bond 
electrons into the uracil aromatic system, this structurally implicated 
mechanism resolves apparent paradoxes concerning the transpositions of electrons 
among orthogonal orbitals and the retention of catalytic efficiency despite 
mutational removal of active-site functional groups. These UDG/DNA structures 
and their implied dissociative excision chemistry suggest biology favors a 
chemistry for base-excision repair initiation that optimizes pathway 
coordination by product binding to avoid the release of cytotoxic and mutagenic 
intermediates. Similar excision chemistry may apply to other biological reaction 
pathways requiring the coordination of complex multistep chemical 
transformations.
