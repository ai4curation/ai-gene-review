Oxidative stress-induced autophagy helps to prevent cellular damage and to 
maintain homeostasis. However, the regulatory pathway that initiates autophagy 
remains unclear. We previously showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
function as signaling molecules to activate the ATM-CHK2 pathway and promote 
autophagy. Here, we find that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM32 functions 
downstream of ATM-CHK2 to regulate ATG7 ubiquitination. Under metabolic stress, 
ROS induce ATM phosphorylation at S1981, which in turn phosphorylates CHK2 at 
T68. We show that CHK2 binds and phosphorylates TRIM32 at the S55 site, which 
then mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of ATG7 at the K45 site to initiate 
autophagy. In addition, Chk2-/- mice show an aggravated infarction phenotype and 
reduced phosphorylation of TRIM32 and ubiquitination of ATG7 in a stroke model. 
We propose a molecular mechanism for autophagy initiation by ROS via the 
ATM-CHK2-TRIM32-ATG7 axis to maintain intracellular homeostasis and to protect 
cells exposed to pathological conditions from stress-induced tissue damage.
