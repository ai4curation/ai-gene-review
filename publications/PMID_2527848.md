## Abstract

1. J Biol Chem. 1989 Sep 15;264(26):15210-5.

Beta-internexin is a microtubule-associated protein identical to the 70-kDa 
heat-shock cognate protein and the clathrin uncoating ATPase.

We have examined the relationship of the ubiquitous 68-70-kDa 
cytoskeletal-associated protein beta-internexin (Napolitano, E. W., Pachter, J. 
S., Chin, S. S. M., and Liem, R. K. H. (1985) J. Cell Biol. 101, 1323-1331) to 
heat-shock cognate 70 (hsc70), the major constitutive member of the mammalian 
heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70) family of stress proteins. We purify 
beta-internexin from rat brain microtubules and confirm its identity with hsc70 
and the clathrin-uncoating ATPase by the following criteria: 1) The partial 
sequence of a cyanogen bromide-derived peptide from beta-internexin matches the 
inferred amino acid sequence of the cDNA clone pRC62 encoding hsc70 from rat 
brain (O'Malley, K., Mauron, A., Barchas, J. D., and Kedes, L. (1985) Mol. Cell. 
Biol. 5, 3476-3483). 2) Mixing experiments followed by two-dimensional gel 
analyses reveal the precise co-migration of beta-internexin, the 
clathrin-uncoating ATPase, and the in vitro translation product of cDNA clone 
pHSP-4 encoding rat brain hsc70. 3) beta-Internexin is recognized by a 
monoclonal antibody reactive against the class of hsp70 proteins. 4) 
beta-Internexin purified from a microtubule-associated protein-enriched fraction 
of rat brain by virtue of high affinity binding to ATP-agarose possesses 
clathrin cage-specific ATPase activity.
