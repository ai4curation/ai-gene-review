PTH comprises 84 amino acids of which the first 34 are sufficient for full 
activation of the classical PTH/PTHrP receptor, the type 1 PTH receptor. It is 
known that multiple carboxyl (C)-terminal fragments of PTH are present in the 
blood and that they comprise the majority of circulating PTH. C-PTH fragments, 
previously regarded as by-products of PTH metabolism, are directly secreted by 
the parathyroid glands or arise from the peripheral cleavage of the intact 
hormone. Compelling evidence now strongly suggests that these C-PTH fragments 
mediate biological effects via activation of a receptor that specifically 
recognizes the C-terminal portion of intact PTH, and this receptor is therefore 
named the carboxyl-terminal PTH receptor (CPTHR). We have previously reported 
that osteocytes abundantly express this novel receptor and that its activation 
is involved in cell survival and communication. Here we report the 
characterization of determinants of PTH that are required for high-affinity 
binding to the CPTHR. Using synthetic PTH peptides harboring alanine 
substitution or truncations, we showed the existence of discrete binding domains 
and critical residues within the intact hormone. We have furthermore identified 
eight amino acids within the PTH sequence that play key roles in optimizing the 
binding affinity of C-PTH fragments to CPTHRs. These include the tripeptide 
sequence Arg(25)-Lys(26)-Lys(27), the dibasic sequence Lys(53)-Lys(54), and 
three additional residues within the PTH (55-84) sequence, Asn(57), Lys(65), and 
Lys(72). Functional analysis of these residues demonstrated a strong correlation 
between binding affinity and biological effect and points to a potential role of 
CPTHR activation in regulating bone cell survival.
