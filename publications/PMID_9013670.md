Rho, Rac and Cdc42 are three Ras-related GTP-binding proteins that control the 
assembly and disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton in response to extracellular 
signals. During the past year, numerous candidate downstream targets for these 
GTPases have been identified using affinity chromatography and yeast two-hybrid 
techniques. These techniques have revealed that Rho regulates the myosin light 
chain phosphatase and that Rho and Rac control the synthesis of 
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, two activities that might help to explain 
the effects of these GTPases on the actin cytoskeleton.
