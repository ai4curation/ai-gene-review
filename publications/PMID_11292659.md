Tumor growth and metastasis are critically dependent on the formation of new 
blood vessels. The present study found that extracellular matrix protein 1 
(ECM1), a newly described secretory glycoprotein, promotes angiogenesis. This 
was initially suggested by in situ hybridization studies of mouse embryos 
indicating that the ECM1 message was associated with blood vessels and its 
expression pattern was similar to that of flk-1, a recognized marker for 
endothelium. More direct evidence for the role of ECM1 in angiogenesis was 
provided by the fact that highly purified recombinant ECM1 stimulated the 
proliferation of cultured endothelial cells and promoted blood vessel formation 
in the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos. Immunohistochemical staining 
with specific antibodies indicated that ECM1 was expressed by the human breast 
cancer cell lines MDA-435 and LCC15, both of which are highly tumorigenic. In 
addition, staining of tissue sections from patients with breast cancer revealed 
that ECM1 was present in a significant proportion of primary and secondary 
tumors. Collectively, the results of this study suggest that ECM1 possesses 
angiogenic properties that may promote tumor progression.
