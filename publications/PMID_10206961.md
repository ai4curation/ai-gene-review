## Abstract

An APAF-1.cytochrome c multimeric complex is a functional apoptosome that 
activates procaspase-9.

We report here the reconstitution of the de novo procaspase-9 activation pathway 
using highly purified cytochrome c, recombinant APAF-1, and recombinant 
procaspase-9. APAF-1 binds and hydrolyzes ATP or dATP to ADP or dADP, 
respectively. The hydrolysis of ATP/dATP and the binding of cytochrome c promote 
APAF-1 oligomerization, forming a large multimeric APAF-1.cytochrome c complex. 
Such a complex can be isolated using gel filtration chromatography and is by 
itself sufficient to recruit and activate procaspase-9. The stoichiometric ratio 
of procaspase-9 to APAF-1 is approximately 1 to 1 in the complex. Once 
activated, caspase-9 disassociates from the complex and becomes available to 
cleave and activate downstream caspases such as caspase-3.
