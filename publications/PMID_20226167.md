Calmodulin (CaM), one of the accessory proteins of the cardiac ryanodine 
receptor (RyR2), is known to play a significant role in the channel regulation 
of the RyR2. However, the possible involvement of calmodulin in the pathogenic 
process of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) has not 
been investigated. In this study, we investigated the state of RyR2-bound CaM 
and channel dysfunctions using a knock-in (KI) mouse model with CPVT-linked RyR2 
mutation (R2474S). Without added effectors, the affinity of CaM binding to the 
RyR2 was indistinguishable between KI and WT hearts. In response to cAMP (1 
micromol/L), the RyR2 phosphorylation at Ser2808 increased in both WT and KI 
hearts to the same extent. However, cAMP caused a significant decrease of the 
CaM-binding affinity in KI hearts, but the affinity was unchanged in WT. 
Dantrolene restored a normal level of CaM-binding affinity in the cAMP-treated 
KI hearts, suggesting that defective inter-domain interaction between the 
N-terminal domain and the central domain of the RyR2 (the target of therapeutic 
effect of dantrolene) is involved in the cAMP-induced reduction of the 
CaM-binding affinity. In saponin-permeabilized cardiomyocytes, the addition of 
cAMP increased the frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) sparks to a significantly 
larger extent in KI cardiomyocytes than in WT cardiomyocytes, whereas the 
addition of a high concentration of CaM attenuated the aberrant increase of 
Ca(2+) sparks. In conclusion, CPVT mutation causes defective inter-domain 
interaction, significant reduction in the ability of CaM binding to the RyR2, 
spontaneous Ca(2+) leak, and then lethal arrhythmia.
