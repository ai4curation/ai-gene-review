Dietary restriction extends life span in diverse species including 
Caenorhabditis elegans. However, the downstream cellular targets regulated by 
dietary restriction are largely unknown. Autophagy, an evolutionary conserved 
lysosomal degradation pathway, is induced under starvation conditions and 
regulates life span in insulin signaling C. elegans mutants. We now report that 
two essential autophagy genes (bec-1 and Ce-atg7) are required for the longevity 
phenotype of the C. elegans dietary restriction mutant (eat-2(ad1113) animals. 
Thus, we propose that autophagy mediates the effect, not only of insulin 
signaling, but also of dietary restriction on the regulation of C. elegans life 
span. Since autophagy and longevity control are highly conserved from C. elegans 
to mammals, a similar role for autophagy in dietary restriction-mediated life 
span extension may also exist in mammals.
