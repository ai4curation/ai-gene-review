WASp-interacting protein (WIP) is a 503-residue proline-rich polypeptide 
expressed in human T cells. The WIP C-terminal domain binds to Wiskott-Aldrich 
syndrome protein (WASp) and regulates its activation and degradation, and the 
WIP-WASp interaction has been shown to be critical for actin polymerization and 
implicated in the onset of WAS and X-linked thrombocytopenia. WIP is predicted 
to be an intrinsically disordered protein, a class of polypeptides that are of 
great interest because they violate the traditional structure-function paradigm. 
In this first (to our knowledge) study of WIP in its unbound state, we used NMR 
to investigate the biophysical behavior of WIP(C), a C-terminal domain fragment 
of WIP that includes residues 407-503 and contains the WASp-binding site. In 
light of the poor spectral dispersion exhibited by WIP(C) and the high 
occurrence (25%) of proline residues, we employed 5D-NMR(13)C-detected NMR 
experiments with nonuniform sampling to accomplish full resonance assignment. 
Secondary chemical-shift analysis, (15)N relaxation rates, and protection from 
solvent exchange all concurred in detecting transient structure located in 
motifs that span the WASp-binding site. Residues 446-456 exhibited a propensity 
for helical conformation, and an extended conformation followed by a short, 
capped helix was observed for residues 468-478. The (13)C-detected approach 
allows chemical-shift assignment in the WIP(C) polyproline stretches and thus 
sheds light on their conformation and dynamics. The effects of temperature on 
chemical shifts referenced to a denatured sample of the polypeptide demonstrate 
that heating reduces the structural character of WIP(C). Thus, we conclude that 
the disordered WIP(C) fragment is comprised of regions with latent structure 
connected by flexible loops, an architecture with implications for binding 
affinity and function.
