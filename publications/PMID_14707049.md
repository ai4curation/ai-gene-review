CD24, also referred to as the heat-stable Ag, is a T cell differentiation Ag 
that is highly expressed on both CD4-CD8- double negative and CD4+CD8+ double 
positive thymocytes. Here, we report that CD24 ligation by a new anti-CD24 Ab, 
mT-20, induced the apoptosis of both double negative and double positive 
thymocytes, as well as the Scid.adh thymic lymphoma cell line, in the absence of 
TCR/CD3 engagement. CD24-mediated apoptosis of mouse thymocytes and its 
signaling pathway appeared not to be associated with p53, CD95, TNFR, or 
caspases. Furthermore, we found that cell death was blocked by the addition of 
scavengers of reactive oxygen species or by Bcl-2 overexpression, implying the 
role of CD24 signaling in the mitochondrial regulation. In this study, we 
suggest that CD24 ligation induced the apoptosis of immature thymocytes 
independently of both caspase and TCR.
