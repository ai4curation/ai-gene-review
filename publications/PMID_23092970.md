periods after UV exposure, however, SENP2 removed SUMO from hnRNP-K for its 
destabilization and in turn for release from cell-cycle arrest. Consistent with 
the rise-and-fall of both SUMOylation and stability of hnRNP-K, its ability to 
interact with PIAS3 was inversely correlated to that with SENP2 during the time

Introduction

The p53 tumour suppressor plays a pivotal role in maintenance of genome integrity under cellular stresses, such as DNA damage ( Lane, 1992 ; Lakin and Jackson, 1999 ; Kruse and Gu, 2009 ; Levine and Oren, 2009 ). Upon DNA damage, ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK are activated for phosphorylation of downstream targets, such as the p53 transcription factor and the checkpoint CHK1 and CHK2 kinases ( Abraham, 2001 , 2004 ; Ciccia and Elledge, 2010 ). This process in turn regulates the functions of downstream effector proteins involved in cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair, and/or apoptosis. A key example is ATM- and ATR-mediated phosphorylation of both p53 and HDM2, which impairs their interaction and thereby prevents HDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 for degradation by proteasome, leading to stabilization and activation of p53 ( Perry, 2004 ).

A major consequence of p53 activation in response to DNA damage is the induction of cell-cycle arrest ( Vogelstein et al, 2000 ; Bartek and Lukas, 2001 ; Vousden and Lu, 2002 ; Horn and Vousden, 2007 ) at the G1/S or G2/M phase. Cell-cycle arrest at the G1/M phase is primarily achieved by expression of p53-downstream genes, such as p21 , an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Notably, p21 also acts as an anti-apoptotic protein. This function of p21 is mediated by its ability to inhibit caspase-3 ( Suzuki et al, 1998 ), stabilize the anti-apoptotic cIAP1 ( Steinman and Johnson, 2000 ), or downregulate caspase-2 ( Baptiste-Okoh et al, 2008 ). Thus, p21 plays an important role in inhibiting apoptosis as well as in cell-cycle arrest, allowing cells to repair damaged DNA and prevent tumorigenesis.

Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) is an ubiquitin-like protein that is conjugated to a variety of cellular proteins. Like ubiquitin, SUMO is conjugated to target proteins by a cascade enzyme system consisting of E1 activating enzyme (SAE1/SAE2), E2 conjugating enzyme (Ubc9), and E3 ligases (PIASs) ( Kerscher et al, 2006 ; Capili and Lima, 2007 ; Rytinki et al, 2009 ). Conjugated SUMO can be removed by a family of SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) ( Mukhopadhyay and Dasso, 2007 ; Yeh, 2009 ). This reversible SUMOylation process participates in the control of diverse cellular processes, including transcription, nuclear transport, and signal transduction ( Kim et al, 2002 ; Johnson, 2004 ; Hay, 2005 ; Geiss-Friedlander and Melchior, 2007 ; Gareau and Lima, 2010 ). Significantly, many proteins involved in DNA-damage response are modified by ubiquitin and/or SUMO, implicating the role of ubiquitination, SUMOylation, or both in the control of checkpoint responses and DNA-repair pathways ( Hoege et al, 2002 ; Lee et al, 2006 ; Bergink and Jentsch, 2009 ; Altmannova et al, 2010 ; Dou et al, 2010 ; Polo and Jackson, 2011 ; Cremona et al, 2012 ). For example, Rad52, a mediator of homologous recombination in yeast, is SUMOylated in response to DNA damage, and this modification stabilizes Rad52 for its sustained function ( Sacher et al, 2006 ).

Heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein-K (hnRNP-K) is an RNA-binding protein that is associated with various cellular processes, including chromatin remodelling, transcription, mRNA splicing, and translation ( Matunis et al, 1992 ; Bomsztyk et al, 1997 , 2004 ). Intriguingly, hnRNP-K was shown to be transiently stabilized and function as a transcriptional co-activator of p53 in response to DNA damage ( Moumen et al, 2005 ). However, how the stability and function of hnRNP-K is regulated remained unknown. Here, we showed that UV induces PIAS3-mediated hnRNP-K SUMOylation, which increases hnRNP-K stability, interaction between hnRNP-K and p53, and p21 expression in an ATR-dependent manner, leading to cell-cycle arrest. At later periods after UV treatment, however, SENP2 reversed the SUMOylation-mediated processes by removing SUMO from hnRNP-K, implicating the role of SENP2 in the release of cells from cell-cycle arrest to resume normal growth after DNA repair. These findings indicate that reversible SUMO modification of hnRNP-K by PIAS3 and SENP2 plays a crucial role in the control of hnRNP-K stability and thereby its function as a p53 co-activator in response to DNA damage by UV.

Discussion

Based on the findings in this study, we propose a model for the role of hnRNP-K SUMOylation in UV-induced cell-cycle arrest ( Figure 9C ). Under unstressed conditions, SENP2 removes SUMO from SUMO-conjugated hnRNP-K, if there is any, allowing hnRNP-K to bind HDM2 with high affinity for its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by proteasome. Although not shown, HDM2 also promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of p53. Upon exposure to UV, PIAS3 binds and ligates SUMO to hnRNP-K, allowing p53 to bind SUMOylated hnRNP-K with high affinity and recruitment of their complex to the p21 promoter. Thus, hnRNP-K SUMOylation by PIAS3 serves as a critical switch for shifting the interaction of hnRNP-K with HDM2 to that with p53 for its function as a transcriptional co-activator of p53 and in turn for p21 expression and cell-cycle arrest in response to DNA damage by UV.

Of interest was the finding that the level of SUMOylated hnRNP-K increases and then declines during the time course after exposure of cells to UV. This phenomenon is apparently mediated by a rise-and-fall of hnRNP-K’s ability to interact with PIAS3 and its inversed ability to bind SENP2 during the same time course. This reversible SUMOylation process that should occur in conjunction with the p53-HDM2 feedback loop is of importance for cells to escape from cell-cycle arrest and to resume normal growth after the repair of damaged DNA. However, it remains unknown how the binding ability of hnRNP-K is shifted to PIAS3 and then to SENP2 after UV treatment. Since ATR knockdown prevents the interaction of hnRNP-K with PIAS3 but promotes that with SENP2 and since UV does not affect the expression of either PIAS3 or SENP2, it seems possible that ATR-mediated phosphorylation of hnRNP-K followed by dephosphorylation by an unknown protein phosphatase(s) might change the affinity of hnRNP-K to PIAS3 and SENP2. Notably, hnRNP-K has the SQ and TQ motifs that can be phosphorylated by ATR ( Kim et al, 1999 ). However, replacement of the Ser and Thr residues by Ala or Glu showed little or no effect on UV-induced SUMOylation of hnRNP-K. Nonetheless, we could not exclude a possibility that kinases downstream of ATR, such as CHK1, or other kinase(s) and unknown phosphatases may be involved in reversible phosphorylation of hnRNP-K and in turn in the control of the affinity of hnRNP-K to PIAS3 and SENP2.

PIAS3 serves as an endogenous protein inhibitor of activated signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), in addition to its role as a SUMO E3 ligase ( Chung et al, 1997 ; Jackson, 2001 ; Jang et al, 2004 ). The STAT3 protein, which promotes cell-cycle progression and inhibits apoptosis, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various human cancers ( Niu et al, 2002 ; Wei et al, 2003 ; Levy and Inghirami, 2006 ). Interestingly, PIAS3 expression is downregulated in several cancers, such as human gastric carcinoma, glioblastoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung ( Brantley et al, 2008 ; Kluge et al, 2011 ; Liu et al, 2011 ). Therefore, it has been suggested that loss or reduction of PIAS3 expression contributes to enhanced STAT3 transcriptional activity, leading to aberrant cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Here, we showed that PIAS3 promotes hnRNP-K SUMOylation and thereby p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest. Thus, PIAS3 might exert its anti-tumorigenic function in both E3 ligase activity-dependent and -independent manners by promoting cell-cycle arrest.

Targeted disruption of SENP2 in mice was shown to impair cell-cycle progression at the G1/S phase, leading to abnormalities in trophoblast proliferation and differentiation ( Chiu et al, 2008 ). During trophoblast development, SENP2 removes SUMO from Mdm2 and thereby promotes Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 and its subsequent degradation by proteasome, allowing cell-cycle progression. Disruption of the SENP2 gene, however, results in cytoplasmic localization of Mdm2 and in turn in p53 stabilization in the nucleus, leading to p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest. On the other hand, overexpression of SENP2 makes cells resistant to apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress, such as doxorubicin treatment, indicating that SENP2 plays a critical role in the control of cell-cycle progression ( Jiang et al, 2011 ). Here, we showed that SENP2 knockdown increases hnRNP-K SUMOylation, its interaction with p53, and consequently its co-activator function in expression of p53-downstream genes, such as p21 , for cell-cycle arrest. In addition, it has been shown that under unstressed conditions hnRNP-K is ubiquitinated by HDM2 for degradation by proteasome ( Moumen et al, 2005 ). Thus, it appears that SENP2 could regulate cell-cycle progression by targeting two different substrates: one by deSUMOylating HDM2 for HDM2-mediated degradation of p53 and the other by deSUMOylating hnRNP-K for HDM2-mediated degradation of hnRNP-K, which ablates its function as a p53 co-activator.

The p21 protein can function as an anti-apoptotic protein as well as an inhibitor of CDKs for cell-cycle arrest. Recently, it was shown that an anti-cancer drug, RITA (reactivation of p53 and induction of tumour cell apoptosis) releases HDM2 from p53 and the freed HDM2 molecules promote proteasome-mediated degradation of hnRNP-K, which impairs its co-activator function in p53-mediated p21 expression ( Enge et al, 2009 ). HDM2 also directly promotes p21 degradation by proteasome, eliminating anti-apoptotic function of p21 and thus switching towards induction of apoptosis. Deregulated cell-cycle progression such as by preventing p21-mediated cell-cycle arrest could also evoke tumorigenesis. Therefore, small molecules that specifically inhibit SENP2 could be used as therapeutic drugs against cancers, as they should prevent hnRNP-K deSUMOylation and in turn induce p53 activation for p21 expression, leading to cell-cycle arrest.

While our work was under revision, another study reported that DNA damage induces hnRNP-K SUMOylation, which in turn enhances the transcriptional activity of p53 ( Pelisch et al, 2012 ). However, the major differences between their and our works are the effect of SUMOylation on the stability of hnRNP-K and the identity of hnRNP-K-specific SUMO E3 ligase. While they concluded that SUMOylation does not alter hnRNP-K stability and that Pc2 acts as an E3 ligase, we found that the same modification leads to hnRNP-K stabilization and that PIAS3 serves as an hnRNP-K-specific ligase. These differences might be due to the use of a single time point in analysing the effect of DNA damage on alterations in the level of hnRNP-K and to the use of overexpression system in analysing the role of Pc2 in hnRNP-K SUMOylation rather than that of RNA interference system. However, we could not exclude a possibility that different SUMO E3 ligases may act on hnRNP-K under different DNA damage conditions, since their work mainly used doxorubicin as a DNA damaging agent whereas ours utilized UV.
