The adenovirus E1B 55-kDa protein impairs the p53 pathway and enhances 
transformation, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be defined. We 
found that Daxx binds to the E1B 55-kDa protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. 
The two proteins interact through their C termini. Mutation of three potential 
phosphorylation sites (S489/490 and T494 to alanine) within the E1B 55-kDa 
protein did not affect its interaction with Daxx, although such mutations were 
previously shown to inhibit E1B's ability to repress p53-dependent transcription 
and to enhance transformation. In addition to their coimmunoprecipitation in 293 
extracts, purified Daxx interacted with the E1B 55-kDa protein in vitro, 
indicating their direct interaction. In 293 cells, Daxx colocalized with the E1B 
55-kDa protein within discrete nuclear dots, where p53 was also found. Such 
structures were distinct from PML (promyelocytic leukemia protein) bodies, and 
it appeared that Daxx was displaced from PML bodies. Thus, the Daxx 
concentration was diminished in dots with a prominent presence of PML and vice 
versa. Indeed, PML overexpression led to dramatic redistribution of Daxx from 
p53-E1B 55-kDa protein complexes to PML bodies. Additionally, expression of the 
E1B 55-kDa protein in Saos2 osteosarcoma cells reduced the number of PML bodies. 
Our data suggest that E1B and PML compete for available Daxx in the cell. 
Surprisingly, Daxx significantly augmented p53-mediated transcription and the 
E1B 55-kDa protein eliminated this effect. Thus, it is likely that the E1B 
55-kDa protein sequesters Daxx and p53 in specific nuclear locations, where p53 
cannot activate transcription. One consequence of the Daxx-E1B interaction might 
be an alteration of normal interactions of Daxx, PML, and p53, which may 
contribute to cell transformation.

Abstract

The
 adenovirus E1B 55-kDa protein impairs the p53 pathway and enhances
 transformation, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be
 defined. We found that Daxx binds to the E1B 55-kDa protein in a yeast
 two-hybrid screen. The two proteins interact through their C termini.
 Mutation of three potential phosphorylation sites (S489/490 and T494 to
 alanine) within the E1B 55-kDa protein did not affect its interaction
 with Daxx, although such mutations were previously shown to inhibit
 E1B's ability to repress p53-dependent transcription and to
 enhance transformation. In addition to their coimmunoprecipitation in
 293 extracts, purified Daxx interacted with the E1B 55-kDa protein in
 vitro, indicating their direct interaction. In 293 cells, Daxx
 colocalized with the E1B 55-kDa protein within discrete nuclear dots,
 where p53 was also found. Such structures were distinct from PML
 (promyelocytic leukemia protein) bodies, and it appeared that Daxx was
 displaced from PML bodies. Thus, the Daxx concentration was diminished
 in dots with a prominent presence of PML and vice versa. Indeed, PML
 overexpression led to dramatic redistribution of Daxx from
 p53-E1B 55-kDa protein complexes to PML bodies. Additionally,
 expression of the E1B 55-kDa protein in Saos2 osteosarcoma cells
 reduced the number of PML bodies. Our data suggest that E1B and PML
 compete for available Daxx in the cell. Surprisingly, Daxx
 significantly augmented p53-mediated transcription and the E1B 55-kDa

 protein sequesters Daxx and p53 in specific nuclear locations, where
 p53 cannot activate transcription. One consequence of the Daxx-E1B

 and p53, which may contribute to cell
 transformation.

DISCUSSION

In
 this study, we have identified Daxx as a binding protein of the E1B
 55-kDa protein through yeast two-hybrid screens. The interaction
 between these two proteins was confirmed in vivo and in vitro by
 biochemical and immunological methods. The in vitro binding result
 indicates that the two proteins directly bind to each other (Fig. 2 ). Strikingly, Daxx, p53,
 and the E1B 55-kDa protein colocalize in a few punctate nuclear dots in
 293 cells (Fig. 3 and 5 ). Overexpression of PML
 drastically reduced the colocalization of Daxx with p53 and E1B, and at
 the same time, Daxx-PML colocalization markedly increased (Fig. 5 ). Furthermore,
 expression of the E1B 55-kDa protein in Saos2 cells significantly
 reduced the number of PML bodies (Fig. 6 and 7 ). Thus, there appears to
 be an active competition between PML and the E1B 55-kDa protein in the
 recruitment of Daxx between PML bodies and p53-E1B 55-kDa
 protein complexes.

What could be the biological consequence of
 dynamic redistribution of Daxx? It is possible that Daxx is required
 for PML-mediated, as well as E1B 55-kDa protein-mediated,
 processes. Daxx could tether enzymatic activities to the E1B 55-kDa
 protein and PML bodies. This possibility is consistent with the fact
 that Daxx interacts with diverse cellular, as well as viral, proteins
 that have very different functions and subcellular distributions. What
 kind of enzymatic activities that Daxx can deliver remains to be
 determined. One obvious possibility is that Daxx can bring various
 modifying enzymes. For example, Daxx is found to associate with histone
 deacetylases ( 15 ). Our
 unpublished data indicated that Daxx associates with several kinases,
 including casein kinase II (CK2; data not shown). This finding may be
 significant with respect to the function of the E1B 55-kDa protein.
 Branton and colleagues found that CK2 can phosphorylate several serine
 residues in the C-terminal domain of the 55-kDa protein and
 phosphorylation of these sites is critical for its repression of
 p53-dependent transcription, inhibition of apoptosis, and cooperation
 with E1As and the E1B 19-kDa protein in cell transformation
 ( 39 ). With our findings
 regarding Daxx-E1B interaction, we propose that Daxx may facilitate
 phosphorylation of the E1B 55-kDa protein by CK2 or other kinases. This
 facilitation does not necessarily require the phosphorylation sites in
 the 55-kDa protein for Daxx-E1B interaction. Indeed, mutation of the
 C-terminal phosphorylation sites of the Ad2 E1B 55-kDa protein
 (S489/490 and T494) to alanine did not affect the Daxx-E1B interaction
 (Fig. 7 ).

On the
 other hand, control of access to Daxx might have important regulatory
 roles in the cell. Thus, sequestration of Daxx by PML and the E1B
 55-kDa oncoprotein may regulate various cellular processes. We report
 here that Daxx can enhance p53-mediated transcription (Fig. 8 ). This enhancement might
 be explained in the light of our proposal. Daxx may tether kinases to
 p53 and facilitate its phosphorylation. This might lead to the observed
 enhancement of p53's transactivation function by Daxx.
 Importantly, expression of the E1B 55-kDa protein eliminated
 Daxx's effect on p53 (Fig. 8 ). As both the p53 and
 E1B 55-kDa proteins colocalize with Daxx in large nuclear bodies (Fig. 3 to 5 ), it is plausible that
 Daxx is removed from sites of p53 action (e.g., p53-responsive
 promoters) and sequestered in E1B 55-kDa protein
 complexes.

Recruitment of Daxx from PML bodies and reduction of
 their number by the E1B 55-kDa protein could compromise PML's role
 in the regulation of cell growth. It was shown previously that
 oncogenic Ras upregulates both p53 and PML and induces premature
 senescence ( 6 , 28 ). In the same time,
 Ras stimulates the localization of CBP, a transcriptional coactivator
 and acetylase, to PML bodies and stabilizes a trimeric complex
 containing p53, PML, and CBP. Significantly, p53 acetylation appears to
 be increased in response to Ras expression, but this enhancement of p53
 acetylation is lost in PML-null cells
 ( 28 ). Thus, acetylation
 of p53 by CBP may be facilitated in PML bodies in the context of cell
 nuclei. We note that Daxx may be recruited away from PML bodies (Fig. 5 and 6 ) to a structure
 containing E1B, p53, and Daxx (Fig. 4 to 6 ). Therefore, one can
 envision that expression of the E1B 55-kDa protein alters the
 intracellular interactions of PML, p53, Daxx, and CBP, among others,
 which could affect p53 acetylation and its transactivation activity.
 Consistently, our previous results showed that the E1B 55-kDa protein
 specifically inhibits p53 acetylation
 ( 20 ). Precisely how the
 E1B 55-kDa protein modulates PML and p53 function through competitive
 recruitment of Daxx and its ensuing implication in Ad-induced cell
 transformation remain to be investigated.
