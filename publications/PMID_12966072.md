A novel oligodendrocyte (OL)-specific cDNA was isolated from brain capillary 
endothelial cells and characterized. The cDNA encodes a protein of 1099 amino 
acids that contains a signal peptide and a transmembrane domain. The protein was 
expressed in mature OLs in vivo and in vitro cell cultures and was thus 
designated as mature OL transmembrane protein (MOLT). RT-PCR analysis showed 
that MOLT mRNA was expressed in brain, lung, pancreas, and testis. A polyclonal 
antibody raised against a part of the mouse MOLT reacted specifically with 
multipolar OLs possessing radially oriented processes that penetrated into the 
gray matter. More cells were detected in the white matter, and these had 
longitudinally oriented processes. In a rat OL lineage culture system, 
oligodendrocyte precursor cells did not initially produce MOLT mRNA and protein, 
but when they begun to differentiate into mature OLs, they started expressing 
MOLT. Consequently, MOLT may function as OLs become mature and may serve as a 
cell-surface marker for OL differentiation.
