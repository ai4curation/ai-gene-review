The Slc26 gene family encodes several conserved anion transporters implicated in 
human genetic disorders, including Pendred syndrome, diastrophic dysplasia and 
congenital chloride diarrhea. We previously characterized the TAT1 (testis anion 
transporter 1; SLC26A8) protein specifically expressed in male germ cells and 
mature sperm and showed that in the mouse, deletion of Tat1 caused male 
sterility due to a lack of sperm motility, impaired sperm capacitation and 
structural defects of the flagella. Ca(2+), Cl(-) and HCO(3)(-) influxes trigger 
sperm capacitation events required for oocyte fertilization; these events 
include the intracellular rise of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and 
protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent protein phosphorylation. The cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is expressed in mature sperm and has 
been shown to contribute to Cl(-) and HCO(3)(-) movements during capacitation. 
Furthermore, several members of the SLC26 family have been described to form 
complexes with CFTR, resulting in the reciprocal regulation of their activities. 
We show here that TAT1 and CFTR physically interact and that in Xenopus laevis 
oocytes and in CHO-K1 cells, TAT1 expression strongly stimulates CFTR activity. 
Consistent with this, we show that Tat1 inactivation in mouse sperm results in 
deregulation of the intracellular cAMP content, preventing the activation of 
PKA-dependent downstream phosphorylation cascades essential for sperm 
activation. These various results suggest that TAT1 and CFTR may form a 
molecular complex involved in the regulation of Cl(-) and HCO(3)(-) fluxes 
during sperm capacitation. In humans, mutations in CFTR and/or TAT1 may 
therefore be causes of asthenozoospermia and low fertilizing capacity of sperm.
