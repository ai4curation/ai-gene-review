Drosophila Suppressor of fused (Su(fu)) encodes a novel 468-amino-acid 
cytoplasmic protein which, by genetic analysis, functions as a negative 
regulator of the Hedgehog segment polarity pathway. Here we describe the primary 
structure, tissue distribution, biochemical and functional analyses of a human 
Su(fu) (hSu(fu)). Two alternatively spliced isoforms of hSu(fu) were identified, 
predicting proteins of 433 and 484 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass 
of 48 and 54 kDa, respectively. The two proteins differ only by the inclusion or 
exclusion of a 52-amino-acid extension at the carboxy terminus. Both isoforms 
were expressed in multiple embryonic and adult tissues, and exhibited a 
developmental profile consistent with a role in Hedgehog signaling. The hSu(fu) 
contains a high-scoring PEST-domain, and exhibits an overall 37% sequence 
identity (63% similarity) with the Drosophila protein and 97% sequence identity 
with the mouse Su(fu). The hSu(fu) locus mapped to chromosome 10q24-q25, a 
region which is deleted in glioblastomas, prostate cancer, malignant melanoma 
and endometrial cancer. HSu(fu) was found to repress activity of the zinc-finger 
transcription factor Gli, which mediates Hedgehog signaling in vertebrates, and 
to physically interact with Gli, Gli2 and Gli3 as well as with Slimb, an F-box 
containing protein which, in the fly, suppresses the Hedgehog response, in part 
by stimulating the degradation of the fly Gli homologue. Coexpression of Slimb 
with Su(fu) potentiated the Su(fu)-mediated repression of Gli. Taken together, 
our data provide biochemical and functional evidence for the hypothesis that 
Su(fu) is a key negative regulator in the vertebrate Hedgehog signaling pathway. 
The data further suggest that Su(fu) can act by binding to Gli and inhibiting 
Gli-mediated transactivation as well as by serving as an adaptor protein, which 
links Gli to the Slimb-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway.
