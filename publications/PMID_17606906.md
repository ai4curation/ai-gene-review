Src kinase mediates growth factor signaling and causes oncogenic transformation, 
which includes dramatic changes in the actin cytoskeleton, cell shape, and 
motility. Cortactin was discovered as a substrate for Src. How phosphorylation 
of cortactin can enhance actin assembly is unknown. Here, using an actin 
assembly system reconstituted from purified components, we demonstrate for the 
first time a biochemical mechanism by which Src phosphorylation of cortactin 
affects actin assembly. The adaptor Nck is an important component of the system, 
linking phosphorylated cortactin with neuronal WASp (N-WASp) and 
WASp-interacting protein (WIP) to activate Arp2/3 complex.
