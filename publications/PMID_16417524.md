The transactivation of nuclear receptors is regulated by both ligand binding and 
phosphorylation. We previously showed that RARalpha (retinoic acid receptor 
alpha) phosphorylation by c-Jun N-terminal kinase contributes to retinoid 
resistance in a subset of NSCLC cells (non-small cell lung cancer cells), but 
the aetiology of this resistance in the remainder has not been fully elucidated 
[Srinivas, Juroske, Kalyankrishna, Cody, Price, Xu, Narayanan, Weigel and Kurie 
(2005) Mol. Cell. Biol. 25, 1054-1069]. In the present study, we report that 
Akt, which is constitutively activated in NSCLC cells, phosphorylates RARalpha 
and inhibits its transactivation. Biochemical and functional analyses showed 
that Akt interacts with RARalpha and phosphorylates the Ser96 residue of its 
DNA-binding domain. Mutation of Ser96 to alanine abrogated the suppressive 
effect of Akt. Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Akt in an NSCLC 
cell line decreased RAR phosphorylation, increased RAR transactivation and 
enhanced the growth-inhibitory effects of an RAR ligand. The findings presented 
here show that Akt inhibits RAR transactivation and contributes to retinoid 
resistance in a subset of NSCLC cells.
