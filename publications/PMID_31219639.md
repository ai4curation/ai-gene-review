BACKGROUND: Congenital cardiovascular malformations are the most common birth 
defects affecting children. Several of these defects occur in structures 
developing from neural crest cells. One of the key signaling pathways regulating 
cardiac neural crest cell (CNCC) development involves the endothelin-A receptor 
(Ednra). However, the exact function of Ednra signaling in CNCC is unknown.
RESULTS: The fate mapping of CNCC in Ednra embryos indicated that the migration 
of these cells is aberrant in the cardiac outflow tract (OFT), but not in the 
pharyngeal arches. This premature arrest of CNCC migration occurs independently 
of CNCC proliferation and apoptosis changes and major gene expression changes. 
Analysis of the Rho family of small GTPases in the mutant embryos revealed that 
Cdc42 failed to localize normally in the CNCC migrating in the OFT. The 
inhibition of Cdc42 activity in cultured embryos recapitulated the migratory 
phenotype observed in Ednra mice. Further analyses revealed that Cdc42 is part 
of the signaling pathway activated by endothelin specifically in OFT CNCC to 
control their migration.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that the activation of Cdc42 by endothelin 
signaling is important for CNCC migration in the OFT but this pathway is not 
involved in mandibular or pharyngeal arch artery patterning.
