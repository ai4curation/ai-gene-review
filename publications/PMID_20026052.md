The secreted small proteoglycan, decorin, modulates collagen fibril formation as 
well as the bioactivity of various members of the transforming growth 
factor-beta (TGFbeta) superfamily. Indeed, recombinant prodecorin has been used 
in several gene therapy experiments to inhibit unwanted fibrosis in model 
diseases of the kidney, heart, and other tissues although the status of the 
propeptide within the target tissues is unknown. Currently the protease that 
removes the highly conserved propeptide from decorin is unproven. Using a 
variety of approaches, we show that three isoforms of the Tolloid-related bone 
morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP1) can effectively remove the propeptide from human 
prodecorin resulting in the well-established mature proteoglycan. Classic BMP1, 
the full-length gene transcript mTLD (BMP1-3), and BMP1-5 (isoform lacking the 
CUB3 domain thought to be important for efficient type I collagen C-propeptidase 
activity) all removed the analogous propeptides from both recombinant human 
prodecorin and murine probiglycan. Furthermore, the timed removal of the 
propeptide was found to not be necessary for the addition of decorin's single 
glycosaminoglycan chain. Decorin therefore joins the growing list of matrix and 
bioactive molecules processed/activated by the BMP1/Tolloid family. Since the 
third member of the Class I small leucine-rich proteooglycan (SLRP) superfamily, 
asporin, also contains a similar cleavage motif at the appropriate location, we 
propose that the removal of these propeptides by members of the BMP1 family is 
an additional characteristic of Class I SLRP.

Abstract

The secreted small proteoglycan, decorin, modulates collagen fibril formation as well as the bioactivity of various members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) superfamily. Indeed, recombinant prodecorin has been used in several gene therapy experiments to inhibit unwanted fibrosis in model diseases of the kidney, heart, and other tissues although the status of the propeptide within the target tissues is unknown. Currently the protease that removes the highly conserved propeptide from decorin is unproven. Using a variety of approaches, we show that three isoforms of the Tolloid-related bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP1) can effectively remove the propeptide from human prodecorin resulting in the well-established mature proteoglycan. Classic BMP1, the full-length gene transcript mTLD (BMP1–3), and BMP1–5 (isoform lacking the CUB3 domain thought to be important for efficient type I collagen C-propeptidase activity) all removed the analogous propeptides from both recombinant human prodecorin and murine probiglycan. Furthermore, the timed removal of the propeptide was found to not be necessary for the addition of decorin’s single glycosaminoglycan chain. Decorin therefore joins the growing list of matrix and bioactive molecules processed/activated by the BMP1/Tolloid family. Since the third member of the Class I small leucine-rich proteooglycan (SLRP) superfamily, asporin, also contains a similar cleavage motif at the appropriate location, we propose that the removal of these propeptides by members of the BMP1 family is an additional characteristic of Class I SLRP.

Introduction

1 PG40 from a human embryonic fibroblast cell line was the first small proteoglycan (PG) to be cloned [ 1 ], although the name was later changed to decorin (DCN) to reflect that the protein appeared to “decorate” collagen fibrils in electron micrographs [ 2 ]. Decorin cDNA encodes a classic leader sequence immediately followed by a highly conserved 14-amino acid prodomain that must be removed to produce the “mature” form of proteoglycan characteristic of those isolated from a variety of tissues (e.g., placental membranes, skin, bone, and cartilage). To illustrate the conservation of the DCN propeptide, 12 of the 14 amino acids remain identical [(G/K)PF(Q/H)QRGLFDFMLE] between humans and reptiles (Anoli). Later, bone matrix was shown to contain both DCN (with a modified serine at the predicted GAG attachment site) and a second small PG that was distinguished from DCN by both its amino-terminal sequence and immunoreactivity [ 3 ]. The second small PG showed significant homology to DCN in the leucine-rich repeat domain first proposed by L. Patthy [ 4 ] as well as in the conserved locations of both amino- and carboxy-terminal cysteine clusters [ 5 ]. In addition, it contained a prodomain similar to that found in DCN and two GAG chains near the mature protein’s aminoterminus, hence it was named biglycan (BGN). In 2000, the Tolloid-related protease, bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP1), was shown to efficiently remove the prodomain of human proBGN [ 6 ], but the protease for proDCN has not been directly proven.

The expression patterns of these two Class I small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRP) are divergent and often mutually exclusive. DCN was found within all major type I and II collagen matrices while BGN was found in a range of specialized tissues (e.g., myofibers and endothelial cells) and epithelial cells (e.g., immature keratinocytes, and renal tubular epithelia) [ 7 ]. DCN binds to the “holes” or gaps in the surface of fibrils resulting from the staggered assembly of mature collagen trimers. Mice lacking DCN have irregular collagen fibrils and fragile skin suggesting that this PG may be involved in collagen fibril assembly [ 8 ]. DCN has also been shown to bind to transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), neutralizing its bioactivity [ 9 ]. Other members of the TGFβ superfamily also appear to bind to DCN and BGN [ 10 ]. It has been proposed that TGFβ members may also be stored in various matrices by binding to SLRP/collagen complexes. Due to its ability to bind TGFβ, recombinant DCN has been used in several gene therapy applications. For example, de novo expression of proDCN in muscle prevented fibrotic disease in experimental rat glomerulonephritis [ 11 ], and more recently proDCN expression mitigated cardiac fibrosis in both spontaneously hypertensive rats [ 12 ] and ligation-induced myocardial infarction [ 13 ]. Although most data support DCN’s role in the negative modulation of TGFβ-related activities, one paper showed that DCN-null myoblasts had aspects of their TGFβ signaling response restored upon reintroduction of proDCN expression [ 14 ]. Others have shown that DCN enhanced the binding of TGFβ to its receptors thereby enhancing bioactivity [ 15 ]. Importantly, it is not known if the highly conserved propeptide is removed during the biogenesis of DCN in the transduced tissues of these gene therapy protocols or which form (proDCN or mature) may be more effective in modulating such TGFβ activities. Thus, knowledge of the proteases involved in the removal of the proDCN propeptide is important for our basic understanding of this conserved PG and may enable more targeted results in future gene therapy studies.

Results and discussion

The presence of a decorin propeptide was evident from the initial cloning of this widely expressed small proteoglycan, but it is so efficiently removed in vivo that it is rarely detected even in extracts of DCN-rich whole tissues [ 18 ]. This lack of a full-length proDCN substrate has hindered the search for definitive proof of the protease responsible for the removal of this highly conserved domain. From the work of Scott et al. [ 6 ], we know that another Class I SLRP, human proBGN, is cleaved at various efficiencies by BMP1/Tolloid family members. Because 1) BMP1-null mice die before birth, 2) cell lines from these mice are not publically available, and 3) even if such cells were used to make proDCN, the two other BMP1-like genes (mTLL1 and mTLL2) may be sufficient to process significant amounts of proDCN and proBGN. Therefore, the processing of proDCN is best studied with PG isolated from cells lacking activity for all BMP1/mTLL gene products. Knockdown of all three gene products by siRNA (or similar technologies) are usually not 100% efficient and protease activity remaining from such approaches could be sufficient to process the proteins. Therefore, we chose to make the proPGs in cells that lack the ability to activate the BMP1/mTLL proteases. Furin is known to activate the BMP1/mTLL proteases at a well-defined site [ 19 ]. In the past we have used the furin-deficient human colon carcinoma cell line, LoVo, to make other glycoproteins that are also cleaved by BMP1 family members, but our preliminary work suggested that LoVo cells were inefficient at biosynthesizing the GAG chains on DCN (data not shown). Fortunately, we were able to purify proDCN and proBGN proteoglycans by transducing primary human bone marrow stromal cells capable of placing GAG chains on proDCN and proBGN in the presence of a synthetic furin inhibitor that effectively enters cells. This furin-inhibitor causes BMP1/Tolloid proteases to remain inactive and therefore unable to process their normal substrates. For example, type I collagen in the furin-inhibited conditioned media were observed as procollagen bands on PAGE (data not shown). Figure 1A shows that the proDCN proteoglycan did not co-purify with any DCN protein lacking its single highly charged GAG chain (lane 1). Upon digestion with chondroitinase ABC, the well-known DCN doublet core protein appeared at the expected M r (lane 2) and that this doublet core protein was then converted to a single, lower M r protein band after removal of its N-linked oligosaccharides by N-glycanase (lane 3). Because both proDCN and proBGN purified by anion exchange chromatography had their GAG chains attached, it is clear that the initiation and elongation of these chains is not dependent on the removal of the propeptide as once proposed [ 20 ]. Our results also complement the work of Oldberg et al. [ 21 ] in which they showed that deletion of most of the rat DCN’s propeptide also did not result in the loss of GAG chain addition in cell culture experiments. Therefore, neither the presence nor appropriately timed removal of their respective propeptides is necessary for GAG chain addition to DCN or BGN.

The human proDCN (and mouse proBGN used as a positive control) PG purified from the furin-inhibited cell culture media were then digested with recombinant classic BMP1 (BMP1-1) to test for the removal of propeptides. For the clearest western blot analyses, both GAG and N-linked oligosaccharide chains were also removed from the BMP1-treated samples by chondroitinase ABC and N-glycanase respectively prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophhoresis and immunodetection. For clarity, the leader and propeptide sequences as well as the peptides synthesized to make the four antibodies used for analyses are noted in Figure 1B . Figure 2A (left panel) shows that treatment of purified proDCN PG with recombinant BMP1 effectively removed its propeptide as seen by the loss of the propeptide-positive immunodetected band. The remaining core protein is observed in the right panel (using the more C-terminal antibody) as a consistently faster electrophoresed core protein, due to the loss of its 14 amino acid propeptide (~1.7 kDa). In a control experiment paralleling the results of Scott et al. [ 6 ] for human proBGN, treatment of the purified mouse proBGN PG with classic BMP1 also resulted in the loss of its propeptide band (using BGN propeptide antibody, Figure 2B , left panel). A M r shift caused by the loss of BGN’s ~2.6 kDa propeptide when detected by BGN’s more C-terminal antibody is seen in Figure 2B , right panel.

While loss of DCN’s propeptide epitope and retention of its “mature” epitope was indicative of BMP1’s cleavage at the expected MφX-D motif, N-terminal protein sequencing remains the gold standard. The amino terminus of the proDCN was GPFQQ proving for the first time that the most commonly predicted cleavage site for removal of the leader sequence is what is actually produced in cells (hBMSC). The microsequence of the DCN core protein after digestion with recombinant BMP1 was DEAXGIGPEV verifying that this Tolloid-related protease did cleave at the expected motif and resulted in the sequence identical to that reported for naturally occurring, mature human DCN [ 22 ]. The inability to detect the serine encoded at amino acid position number 4 (X) of the BMP1-treated protein also verified that the PG made for these experiments was chemically modified (logically by the addition of the GAG chain) at this protein’s predicted GAG-attachment motif.

BMP1 is the most commonly studied isoform but others such as the full-length gene transcript, mTLD (BMP1–3), and the shortest isoform to retain an intact catalytic domain, BMP1–5, are also commonly expressed in a variety of tissues [ 23 ]. Indeed, it has been proposed that a combination of the BMP1 isoforms and enhancer proteins (e.g., PCPE-1 and PCPE-2) expressed by a cell/tissue that directs the processing of the many matrix and other bioactive proteins that are known to be activated/processed by BMP1 [ 24 ]. Scott et al. [ 6 ] showed that BMP1 effectively removed the propeptide from human proBGN while the longest isoform, mTLD, showed barely detectable activity under their conditions. Under our experimental conditions recombinant BMP1, mTLD, and BMP1–5 all effectively processed both human proDCN ( Figure 3A ) and murine proBGN ( Figure 3B ) as measured by both the loss of their respective propeptide epitopes (left panels) and the slightly decreased apparent molecular weight of their respective mature core proteins (right panels) on western blots. While our more complete processing of the murine proBGN by mTLD compared to the previous authors’ human proBGN substrate [ 6 ] could be due to the species difference, it is more likely that our more enabling digestion condition is the explanation. The processing of proDCN and proBGN by BMP1–5 isoform reported here for the first time is interesting because this shortest of proteolytically active isoforms lacks the CUB3 domain thought to be important for the successful binding and cleavage of the prototypical BMP1 substrate, type I procollagen [ 25 ]. In our hands, BMP1–5 remains a much less efficient processor of type I procollagen than BMP1 (data not shown), but it does remove the propeptides of proDCN and proBGN thereby indirectly supporting the previous hypothesis that the CUB3 domain may be directed towards the processing of collagen substrates and not the Class I SLRPs. Similarly, we agree that mTLD, which was recently reported to dimerize in the presence of ionic calcium and become inefficient at processing type I procollagens [ 26 ], was inefficient at processing human procollagen in vitro (data not shown) but it was relatively efficient at removing the propeptides of DCN and BGN. This supports the hypothesis that mTLD and BMP1–5 may have been selected for processing noncollagenous substrates in vivo.

In this report we have shown that a second member of the Class I SLRPs, decorin, to have its propeptide removed by isoforms of BMP1. The predicted coding sequence of the third member of this class, asporin, also contains a similar propeptide [ 27 ] that can reasonably be proposed to be removed by BMP1/Tolloid-related proteases at its own MφX-D motif. Furthermore, if the observation that asporin is not a proteoglycan and yet is biosynthesized with a propeptide that is removed by the Tolloid-related proteases hold true, it offers another proof that the propeptide itself is not directly involved in the addition of the glycosaminoglycan chains. A corollary note is that over the long period of evolution since these three genes began diverging, all three proteins continue to maintain their small propeptide suggesting that they continue to play an as yet unknown but important role in the biology of these secreted proteins.

Conclusions

Decorin’s ability to bind to TGFβ superfamily members has led to proDCN’s use in blocking unwanted fibrosis in a number of model systems even though the enzyme that removes its highly conserved propeptide was unproven. Inhibition of the furin-activation of the BMP1/Tolloid members permitted the efficient production of the PG forms of human proDCN and mouse proBGN in virally transduced cells. The presence of GAG chains on the proPGs showed that the removal of the propeptide is not necessary for the addition of these chains. Three isoforms of BMP1 ranging from the shortest (BMP1–5, lacking the CUB3 domain important to processing procollagen) to the longest (mTLD, inefficient at processing procollagen in vitro) were all shown to be capable of removing the highly conserved propeptides from both proDCN and proBGN PG. Future studies are necessary to determine importance of the timing and location of the removal of these highly conserved propeptides in vivo and the roles that they may play in the bioactivity of the TGFβ superfamily.
