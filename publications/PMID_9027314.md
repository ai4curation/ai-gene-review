Bcl-2 is an integral membrane protein located mainly on the outer membrane of 
mitochondria. Overexpression of Bcl-2 prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis 
in response to a variety of stimuli. Cytosolic cytochrome c is necessary for the 
initiation of the apoptotic program, suggesting a possible connection between 
Bcl-2 and cytochrome c, which is normally located in the mitochondrial 
intermembrane space. Cells undergoing apoptosis were found to have an elevation 
of cytochrome c in the cytosol and a corresponding decrease in the mitochondria. 
Overexpression of Bcl-2 prevented the efflux of cytochrome c from the 
mitochondria and the initiation of apoptosis. Thus, one possible role of Bcl-2 
in prevention of apoptosis is to block cytochrome c release from mitochondria.
