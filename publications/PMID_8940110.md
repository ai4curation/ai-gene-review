The cDNA that encodes the rabbit calcitonin receptor was cloned by screening a 
rabbit osteoclast library. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
amplification of calcitonin receptor sequences from rabbit osteoclast RNA 
yielded cDNAs that encode two isoforms of the calcitonin receptor. One isoform 
is homologous to the C1a isoform previously identified in multiple cell types 
and species, while the second, designated CTRDeltae13, is a previously 
unidentified isoform that is apparently generated by alternative splicing during 
mRNA processing that deletes exon 13, resulting in the absence of 14 amino acids 
in the predicted seventh transmembrane domain. Expression of mRNA transcripts 
encoding the two isoforms varies in a tissue-specific manner, with CTRDeltae13 
accounting for less than 15% of the total calcitonin receptor mRNA in 
osteoclasts, kidney, and brain, but comprising at least 50% of the transcripts 
in skeletal muscle and lung. The two isoforms were expressed, and the ligand 
binding and signal transduction properties were characterized. Deletion of the 
residues in the seventh transmembrane domain in CTRDeltae13 reduced the binding 
affinity for salmon and human calcitonin by more than 10-fold and approximately 
2-fold, respectively, resulting in a receptor that failed to discriminate 
between the two forms of calcitonin. Both isoforms activated adenylyl cyclase, 
with EC50 values consistent with the difference in ligand affinities. In 
contrast, only the C1a isoform, but not the CTRDeltae13 isoform, activated 
phospholipase C. Thus, while the CTRDeltae13 remains active despite the deletion 
of a significant portion of its seventh transmembrane domain, it has 
significantly altered ligand recognition and signal transduction properties.
