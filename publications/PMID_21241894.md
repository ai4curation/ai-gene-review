The study of macroautophagy in mammalian cells has described induction, vesicle 
nucleation, and membrane elongation complexes as key signaling intermediates 
driving autophagosome biogenesis. How these components are recruited to nascent 
autophagosomes is poorly understood, and although much is known about signaling 
mechanisms that restrain autophagy, the nature of positive inductive signals 
that can promote autophagy remain cryptic. We find that the Ras-like small G 
protein, RalB, is localized to nascent autophagosomes and is activated on 
nutrient deprivation. RalB and its effector Exo84 are required for nutrient 
starvation-induced autophagocytosis, and RalB activation is sufficient to 
promote autophagosome formation. Through direct binding to Exo84, RalB induces 
the assembly of catalytically active ULK1 and Beclin1-VPS34 complexes on the 
exocyst, which are required for isolation membrane formation and maturation. 
Thus, RalB signaling is a primary adaptive response to nutrient limitation that 
directly engages autophagocytosis through mobilization of the core vesicle 
nucleation machinery.
