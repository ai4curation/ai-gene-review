Promoter clearance and transcriptional processivity in eukaryotic cells are 
fundamentally regulated by the phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain of 
RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). One of the kinases that essentially performs this 
function is P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b), which is 
composed of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) associated with members of the 
cyclin T family. Here we show that cellular GCN5 and P/CAF, members of the 
GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase family of histone acetyltransferases, regulate 
CDK9 function by specifically acetylating the catalytic core of the enzyme and, 
in particular, a lysine that is essential for ATP coordination and the 
phosphotransfer reaction. Acetylation markedly reduces both the kinase function 
and transcriptional activity of P-TEFb. In contrast to unmodified CDK9, the 
acetylated fraction of the enzyme is specifically found in the insoluble nuclear 
matrix compartment. Acetylated CDK9 associates with the transcriptionally silent 
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 provirus; upon transcriptional activation, 
it is replaced by the unmodified form, which is involved in the elongating phase 
of transcription marked by Ser2-phosphorylated RNAPII. Given the conservation of 
the CDK9 acetylated residues in the catalytic task of virtually all CDK 
proteins, we anticipate that this mechanism of regulation might play a broader 
role in controlling the function of other members of this kinase family.
