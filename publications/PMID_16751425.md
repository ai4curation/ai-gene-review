IL-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine comprising a p19 subunit associated with the 
IL-12/23p40 subunit. Like IL-12, IL-23 is expressed predominantly by activated 
dendritic cells (DCs) and phagocytic cells, and both cytokines induce IFN-gamma 
secretion by T cells. The induction of experimental autoimmune encephalitis, the 
animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), occurs in mice lacking IL-12, but not 
in mice with targeted disruption of IL-23 or both IL-12 and IL-23. Thus, IL-23 
expression in DCs may play an important role in the pathogenesis of human 
autoimmune diseases such as MS. We quantified the expression of IL-23 in 
monocyte-derived DCs in MS patients and healthy donors and found that DCs from 
MS patients secrete elevated amounts of IL-23 and express increased levels of 
IL-23p19 mRNA. Consistent with this abnormality, we found increased IL-17 
production by T cells from MS patients. We then transfected monocyte-derived DCs 
from healthy donors with antisense oligonucleotides specific for the IL-23p19 
and IL-12p35 genes and found potent suppression of gene expression and blockade 
of bioactive IL-23 and IL-12 production without affecting cellular viability or 
DCs maturation. Inhibition of IL-23 and IL-12 was associated with increased 
IL-10 and decreased TNF-alpha production. Furthermore, transfected DCs were poor 
allostimulators in the MLR. Our results demonstrate that an abnormal Th1 bias in 
DCs from MS patients related to IL-23 exists, and that antisense 
oligonucleotides specific to IL-23 can be used for immune modulation by 
targeting DC gene expression.
