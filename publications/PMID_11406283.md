We report the cloning and expression pattern of a novel N-myc 
downstream-regulated gene 3 (NDRG3), located on human chromosome 20q11.21-11.23. 
The NDRG3 cDNA is 2588 base pair in length, encoding a 363 amino acid 
polypeptide highly related to mouse Ndr3 protein. Northern blot reveals that 
NDRG3 is highly expressed in testis, prostate and ovary. By in situ 
hybridization, the NDRG3 mRNA was localized to the outer layers of seminiferous 
epithelium, indicating that it may play a role in spermatogenesis.
