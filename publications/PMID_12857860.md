Immunolocalization studies in epithelial cells revealed myo6 was associated with 
peripherally located vesicles that contained the transferrin receptor. 
Pulse-chase experiments after transferrin uptake showed that these vesicles were 
newly uncoated endocytic vesicles and that myo6 was recruited to these vesicles 
immediately after uncoating. GIPC, a putative myo6 tail binding protein, was 
also present. Myo6 was not present on early endosomes, suggesting that myo6 has 
a transient association with endocytic vesicles and is released upon early 
endosome fusion. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to myo6 as well as the 
cargo-binding tail (M6tail) alone targeted to the nascent endocytic vesicles. 
Overexpression of GFP-M6tail had no effect on a variety of organelle markers; 
however, GFP-M6tail displaced the endogenous myo6 from nascent vesicles and 
resulted in a significant delay in transferrin uptake. Pulse-chase experiments 
revealed that transferrin accumulated in uncoated vesicles within the 
peripheries of transfected cells and that Rab5 was recruited to the surface of 
these vesicles. Given sufficient time, the transferrin did traffic to the 
perinuclear sorting endosome. These data suggest that myo6 is an accessory 
protein required for the efficient transportation of nascent endocytic vesicles 
from the actin-rich peripheries of epithelial cells, allowing for timely fusion 
of endocytic vesicles with the early endosome.

Abstract

Immunolocalization studies in epithelial cells revealed myo6 was associated
 with peripherally located vesicles that contained the transferrin receptor.
 Pulse-chase experiments after transferrin uptake showed that these vesicles
 were newly uncoated endocytic vesicles and that myo6 was recruited to these
 vesicles immediately after uncoating. GIPC, a putative myo6 tail binding
 protein, was also present. Myo6 was not present on early endosomes, suggesting
 that myo6 has a transient association with endocytic vesicles and is released
 upon early endosome fusion. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to myo6 as
 well as the cargo-binding tail (M6tail) alone targeted to the nascent
 endocytic vesicles. Overexpression of GFP-M6tail had no effect on a variety of

 Pulse-chase experiments revealed that transferrin accumulated in uncoated

 suggest that myo6 is an accessory protein required for the efficient

INTRODUCTION

Myosins are a large family of structurally diverse molecular motors.
 Myosins bind to F-actin and hydrolyze ATP to produce unidirectional movement
 along the filament. Actin filaments are polarized, and myosins traditionally
 travel toward the barbed or plus end of the actin filament. An exception to
 this rule is the unconventional myosin, myosin-VI (myo6), which travels
 backwards toward the pointed or minus end of actin filaments
 ( Wells et al. ,
 1999 ).

Myo6 has four structural domains. The N terminus encodes a conserved motor
 domain similar to that seen for other myosins, as well as a single IQ motif
 that serves as a light chain binding site for the calcium-binding protein
 calmodulin ( Hasson and Mooseker,
 1994 ). The myo6 motor domain is regulated by calcium
 ( Yoshimura et al. ,
 2001 ) and is sufficient for the pointed-end directed movement
 ( Wells et al. , 1999 ; Homma et al. , 2001 ).
 After the motor is the tail domain, which is made up a 200 amino acid
 coiled-coil region and a C-terminal globular domain
 ( Hasson and Mooseker, 1994 ).
 The coiled-coil region mediates dimerization of myo6
 ( De La Cruz et al. ,
 2001 ). The globular tail contains no recognizable motifs but is
 highly conserved across all class VI myosins and probably associates with
 cargo.

Based on its direction of movement, myo6 has been implicated in multiple
 processes that involved the transport of components inwards into the cell
 (reviewed in Cramer, 2000 ).
 These functions stem from the observation that actin filaments within the cell
 tend to be oriented with their barbed ends at the peripheries of the cell and
 their pointed ends toward the center of the cell. Consistent with a role in
 endocytosis, in many epithelial cell types, myo6 is associated with endocytic
 domains. In sensory hair cells of the inner ear, myo6 is enriched in the
 pericuticular necklace, a region of the hair cell rich in membrane vesicles
 and clathrin, and the sole site of endocytosis for the hair cell
 ( Hasson et al. , 1997 ; Kachar et al. , 1997 ).
 Myo6 is also enriched in endocytic regions in kidney. In the kidney proximal
 tubule, myo6 is present at the base of the brush-border microvilli where it
 overlaps with the clathrin adapter protein AP-2
 ( Buss et al. , 2001 ; Biemesderfer et al. ,
 2002 ).

The first direct evidence for an involvement of myo6 in endocytosis was
 presented in studies in normal rat kidney fibroblasts by using constructs that
 expressed differently spliced versions of chicken myo6
 ( Buss et al. , 2001 ). A
 longer splice form of myo6 that contained an insert between the coiled-coil
 region and the globular tail was identified. This long myo6 splice form
 targeted to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), whereas any form lacking this insert
 did not ( Buss et al. ,
 2001 ). This longer splice form of myo6 was implicated in
 endocytosis of transferrin; overexpression of a construct that contained the
 tail and the splice insert, but lacking the motor domain, caused a 50%
 reduction in transferrin uptake by normal rat kidney fibroblasts
 ( Buss et al. , 2001 ).
 In contrast, overexpression of tail constructs lacking the splice insert had
 no effect on transferrin endocytosis. This study suggested that myo6 might
 have a role in endocytosis but only in tissues such as intestinal brush border
 that express a myo6 isoform containing a tail splice insert
 ( Buss et al. ,
 2001 ).

Myo6 has been reported to be enriched in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs)
 isolated from brain; however this tissue does not express the myo6 isoform
 with the splice insert ( Buss et
 al. , 2001 ). Therefore, we hypothesized that all splice forms
 of myo6, including forms that lack the splice insert, may be involved in the
 process of endocytosis.

In this study, we evaluated myo6's role in endocytosis by using a retinal
 epithelial cell model system. We found that in this system myo6 is not present
 on CCPs, and instead, is recruited to newly uncoated endocytic vesicles that
 contain the transferrin receptor. GIPC, an adapter protein, is also present
 and may be involved in the recruitment myo6 to these transport intermediates.
 Overexpression of the cargo-binding tail domain of myo6 led to an accumulation
 of transferrin-containing uncoated vesicles within cell peripheries. These
 vesicles contained Rab5, suggesting that they were transport vesicles delayed
 in trafficking to the early endosome. These data suggest that myo6 is an
 accessory protein required for the efficient and timely traffic of nascent
 endocytic vesicles.

DISCUSSION

We find that myo6 is recruited to newly uncoated endocytic vesicles.
 Association of myo6 with the vesicles is transient, because myo6 departs upon
 fusion with the EEA1-positive early endosome. GIPC, an adapter protein, is
 also present on these endocytic vesicles. We found that disruption of myo6
 function led to an accumulation of transferrin-containing and Rab5-containing
 uncoated vesicles within cell peripheries due to delayed trafficking to the
 early endosomes. These data suggest that myo6 is an accessory protein required
 for the efficient and timely traffic of nascent endocytic vesicles, even in
 the absence of any of the unique splice inserts previously implicated as
 essential for endocytic function. We interpret our findings to reflect an
 epithelial cell-specific need for translocation of endocytic vesicles through
 dense actin networks found at cell peripheries.
