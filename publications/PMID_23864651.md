Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) controls diverse physiological 
functions in tissues including the pancreatic islets, brain, and heart. To 
understand the mechanisms that control glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) signaling 
better, we sought to identify proteins that interact with the GLP-1R using a 
membrane-based split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) assay. A screen of a 
human fetal brain cDNA prey library with an unliganded human GLP-1R as bait in 
yeast revealed 38 novel interactor protein candidates. These interactions were 
confirmed in mammalian Chinese hamster ovarian cells by coimmunoprecipitation. 
Immunofluorescence was used to show subcellular colocalization of the 
interactors with GLP-1R. Cluster analysis revealed that the interactors were 
primarily associated with signal transduction, metabolism, and cell development. 
When coexpressed with the GLP-1R in Chinese hamster ovarian cells, 15 
interactors significantly altered GLP-1-induced cAMP accumulation. Surprisingly, 
all 15 proteins inhibited GLP-1-activated cAMP. Given GLP-1's prominent role as 
an incretin, we then focused on 3 novel interactors, SLC15A4, APLP1, and AP2M1, 
because they are highly expressed and localized to the membrane in mouse 
insulinoma β-cells. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of each candidate 
gene significantly enhanced GLP-1-induced insulin secretion. In conclusion, we 
have generated a novel GLP-1R-protein interactome, identifying several 
interactors that suppress GLP-1R signaling. We suggest that the inhibition of 
these interactors may serve as a novel strategy to enhance GLP-1R activity.

Given GLP-1's prominent role as an incretin, we then focused on 3 novel interactors, SLC15A4, APLP1, and AP2M1, because they are highly expressed and localized to the membrane in mouse insulinoma β-cells. Small interfering RNA–mediated knockdown of each candidate gene significantly enhanced GLP-1-induced insulin secretion. In conclusion, we have generated a novel GLP-1R-protein interactome, identifying several interactors that suppress GLP-1R signaling. We suggest that the inhibition of these interactors may serve as a novel strategy to enhance GLP-1R activity.

Discussion

Recent studies have revealed a large range of accessory proteins that interact directly with the intracellular domains of GPCRs, forming functional protein units or interactomes ( 9 ). In this study, we screened a human fetal brain cDNA library to produce the first GLP-1R interactome using the MYTH system ( Figure 3 ). Bait dependency tests in yeast and CO-IP and immunofluorescence analyses in mammalian CHO cells were used to validate the protein-receptor interactions. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the interactors to be associated with signal transduction, metabolism, cell growth, and trafficking. By cAMP and insulin secretion assays, we further showed a subset of the interacting proteins attenuated the receptor function. Inhibiting these interactors may then serve as a novel strategy to enhance GLP-1R activity.

GLP-1R is a GPCR best known to maintain global glucose homeostasis and promote pancreatic β cell proliferation ( 2 ). Thus, it is interesting to find most GLP-1R interacting candidates to be involved in cell signal transduction, metabolism, proliferation, and development. None of these proteins had been previously recognized as an interactor of the GLP-1R. A series of validation assays were performed to ensure the accuracy of the screen. The bait dependency test was first used to validate the interactors in yeast. This test is very useful at eliminating false positives generated by MYTH; however, it should be noted that it is not 100% accurate and is performed in yeast but not mammalian cells. Thus, we decided to pursue REEP2 despite the fact that it failed the bait dependency test because it has been shown by the others to enhance sweet receptor function through recruitment to lipid rafts ( 24 ). To validate the interactor proteins in a mammalian setting CO-IPs were performed using RC2-CHO cells, which stably express the human GLP-1R. Thirty-six of the 39 interactor candidates coprecipitated with the GLP-1R, highlighting the dependability of MYTH to study mammalian protein-protein interactions for membrane-spanning receptors. However, we acknowledge that the CO-IPs were carried out in a model system, and overexpressing some proteins may promote artificial interactions. Since the MYTH-identified proteins interacted with the receptor with differing strengths ( Figure 4 B), and some completely failed to bind the bait (NRGN, STMN1, and ARFRP1), we are confident that these CO-IP interactions were not simply artifacts of overexpression. Our complementary anti-Flag CO-IP (Supplemental Figure 1) and colocalization ( Figure 5 ) results further confirmed the interactions. It would be of great interest to see endogenous interaction between the GLP-1R and interactor candidates in MIN6 cells or mouse/human islets. However, it has been reported that commercially available GLP-1R antibodies are not specific ( 27 ), which is consistent with our data (Supplemental Figure 2A). In addition, we were unable to find antibodies that could reliably identify endogenous interactor proteins of interest by Western blotting (Supplemental Figure 2B) or immunofluorescence (Supplemental Figure 2C).

Interestingly, 15 of the 36 GLP-1R interactors attenuated GLP-1-induced cAMP accumulation in RC2-CHO cells, but none enhanced it ( Figure 6 ). Because our initial MYTH screening was performed using an unliganded GLP-1R, it is possible that the identified interactors suppress receptor activation, stabilizing the GLP1-R in a low-activity state in the absence of ligand binding. Although there is no direct evidence supporting this idea, knocking down SLC15A4, APLP1, and AP2M1 significantly enhanced GLP-1-stimulated insulin secretion from the MIN6 cells at high glucose ( Figure 8 D). On the other hand, insulin secretion was not affected by the knockdowns at both low and high glucose in the absence of GLP-1 ( Table 2 ). This further suggests a functional redundancy among the protein interactors, which act as a whole to keep the GLP-1R quiescent in its unliganded state. The inability to detect interactors capable of enhancing cAMP accumulation may also be explained by effects on the cAMP-independent signaling cascades of the GLP-1R. For example, stimulation of the GLP-1R in pancreatic β-cells has been reported to activate pathways that involve a transactivated epidermal growth factor receptor and subsequent PI3 kinases ( 28 ). The identification of interactors that work through such pathways will require employing different screening assays.

The interactors that we identified may modulate GLP-1R function through distinct mechanisms. SLC15A4 is a proton oligopeptide cotransporter that transports free histidine, protons, and certain dipeptides and tripeptides across membranes ( 29 ). Protonation has been long known to affect multiple GPCR properties, including the rate of ligand-induced conformational change and the receptor-mediated G-protein activation ( 30 ). By cotransporting protons and peptides, SLC15A4 may couple the GLP-1R activity to the extracellular nutrient state through modulating the local pH. Interestingly, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the SLC15A4 gene has been reported to associate with the development of type 2 diabetes ( 31 ), supporting the regulatory role of this transporter on GLP-1R. The exact in vivo function of SLC15A4 is however largely unknown and its investigation is beyond the scope of this article. APLP1 is a glycoprotein previously shown to interact with the α 2A -adrenergic receptor, a G i -coupled GPCR, and the voltage-gated calcium channel Ca v 2.3 ( 32 , 33 ). In both cases, a considerable shift of the receptor/channel localization from the plasma membrane to the intracellular compartments is observed. Clathrin is suggested to play a role in this APLP1-mediated relocalization because APLP1 contains a highly conserved NPxY motif that is known to mediate endocytosis via the clathrin-coated pits. APLP1 may similarly induce GLP-1R endocytosis via the same mechanism, which would explain the decrease in GLP-1R activity observed in our study. The fact that we show AP2M1, a subunit of the Adaptor Protein 2 (AP2) complex known to regulate GPCR recycling via clathrin ( 34 ), also attenuated GLP-1R signaling further supports this idea ( Figures 6 and 8 D). Interestingly, localization of the GLP-1R shifted from the plasma membrane to the intracellular space in CHO cells when AP2M1 was overexpressed ( Figure 5 D). Aside from these proteins, our study also indicates that the GLP-1R is capable of interacting with various transport proteins, metabolic factors, and GTPases.

This present study is the first example of an interaction screen using the full-length GLP-1R. We show that the unliganded GLP-1R interacts with a large and diverse group of proteins. Our functional assays suggest that these interactors act collectively to attenuate GLP-1R activity. Taken together, our data shed light on the allosteric regulation of GLP-1R, which may also apply to other GSRs or GPCRS in general. Furthermore, some of our newly identified GLP-1R accessory proteins may allow for selective manipulation of the GLP-1R activity.
