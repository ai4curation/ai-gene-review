S100 proteins are a subfamily of the EF-hand type calcium sensing proteins, the 
exact biological functions of which have not been clarified yet. In this work, 
we have identified Cyclophilin 40 (CyP40) and FKBP52 (called immunophilins) as 
novel targets of S100 proteins. These immunophilins contain a tetratricopeptide 
repeat (TPR) domain for Hsp90 binding. Using glutathione-S transferase pull-down 
assays and immunoprecipitation, we have demonstrated that S100A1 and S100A2 
specifically interact with the TPR domains of FKBP52 and CyP40 in a 
Ca(2+)-dependent manner, and lead to inhibition of the CyP40-Hsp90 and 
FKBP52-Hsp90 interactions. These findings have suggested that the Ca(2+)/S100 
proteins are TPR-targeting regulators of the immunophilins-Hsp90 complex 
formations.
