HEF1, p130(Cas), and Efs/Sin constitute a family of multidomain docking proteins 
that have been implicated in coordinating the regulation of cell adhesion. Each 
of these proteins contains an SH3 domain, conferring association with focal 
adhesion kinase; a domain rich in SH2-binding sites, phosphorylated by or 
associating with a number of oncoproteins, including Abl, Crk, Fyn, and others; 
and a highly conserved carboxy-terminal domain. In this report, we show that the 
HEF1 protein is processed in a complex manner, with transfection of a single 
cDNA resulting in the generation of at least four protein species, p115(HEF1), 
p105(HEF1), p65(HEF1), and p55(HEF1). We show that p115(HEF1) and p105(HEF1) are 
different phosphorylation states of the full-length HEF1. p55(HEF1), however, 
encompasses only the amino-terminal end of the HEF1 coding sequence and arises 
via cleavage of full-length HEF1 at a caspase consensus site. We find that HEF1 
proteins are abundantly expressed in epithelial cells derived from breast and 
lung tissue in addition to the lymphoid cells in which they have been 
predominantly studied to date. In MCF-7 cells, we find that expression of the 
endogenous HEF1 proteins is cell cycle regulated, with p105(HEF1) and p115(HEF1) 
being rapidly upregulated upon induction of cell growth, whereas p55(HEF1) is 
produced specifically at mitosis. While p105(HEF1) and p115(HEF1) are 
predominantly cytoplasmic and localize to focal adhesions, p55(HEF1) 
unexpectedly is shown to associate with the mitotic spindle. In support of a 
role at the spindle, two-hybrid library screening with HEF1 identifies the human 
homolog of the G2/M spindle-regulatory protein Dim1p as a specific interactor 
with a region of HEF1 encompassed in p55(HEF1). In sum, these data suggest that 
HEF1 may directly connect morphological control-related signals with cell cycle 
regulation and thus play a role in pathways leading to the progression of 
cancer.
