Hepatitis C virus uses an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the viral RNA 
to directly recruit human 40S ribosome subunits during cap-independent 
translation initiation. Although IRES-mediated translation initiation is not 
subject to many of the regulatory mechanisms that control cap-dependent 
translation initiation, it is unknown whether other noncanonical protein factors 
are involved in this process. Thus, a global protein composition analysis of 
native and IRES-bound 40S ribosomal complexes has been conducted to facilitate 
an understanding of the IRES ribosome recruitment mechanism. A combined top-down 
and bottom-up mass spectrometry approach was used to identify both the proteins 
and their posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in the native 40S subunit and 
the IRES recruited translation initiation complex. Thirty-one out of a possible 
32 ribosomal proteins were identified by combining top-down and bottom-up mass 
spectrometry techniques. Proteins were found to contain PTMs, including loss of 
methionine, acetylation, methylation, and disulfide bond formation. In addition 
to the 40S ribosomal proteins, RACK1 was consistently identified in the 40S 
fraction, indicating that this protein is associated with the 40S subunit. 
Similar methodology was then applied to the hepatitis C virus IRES-bound 40S 
complex. Two 40S ribosomal proteins, RS25 and RS29, were found to contain 
different PTMs than those in the native 40S subunit. In addition, RACK1, 
eukaryotic initiation factor 3 proteins and nucleolin were identified in the 
IRES-mediated translation initiation complex.
