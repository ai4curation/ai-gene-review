Cellular damage caused by reactive oxygen species is believed to be a major 
contributor to age-associated diseases. Previously, we characterized the 
Caenorhabditis elegans Brap2 ortholog (BRAP-2) and found that it is required to 
prevent larval arrest in response to elevated levels of oxidative stress. Here, 
we report that C. elegans brap-2 mutants display increased expression of 
SKN-1-dependent, phase II detoxification enzymes that is dependent on PMK-1 (a 
p38 MAPK C. elegans ortholog). An RNA-interference screen was conducted using a 
transcription factor library to identify genes required for increased expression 
of the SKN-1 target gst-4 in brap-2 mutants. We identified ELT-3, a member of 
the GATA transcription factor family, as a positive regulator of gst-4p::gfp 
expression. We found that ELT-3 interacts with SKN-1 to activate gst-4 
transcription in vitro and that elt-3 is required for enhanced gst-4 expression 
in the brap-2(ok1492) mutant in vivo Furthermore, nematodes overexpressing SKN-1 
required ELT-3 for life-span extension. Taken together, these results suggest a 
model where BRAP-2 acts as negative regulator of SKN-1 through inhibition of p38 
MAPK activity, and that the GATA transcription factor ELT-3 is required along 
with SKN-1 for the phase II detoxification response in C. elegans.
