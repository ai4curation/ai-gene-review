The TGFβ pathway is critical for embryonic development and adult tissue 
homeostasis. On ligand stimulation, TGFβ and BMP receptors phosphorylate 
receptor-activated SMADs (R-SMADs), which then associate with SMAD4 to form a 
transcriptional complex that regulates gene expression through specific DNA 
recognition. Several ubiquitin ligases serve as inhibitors of R-SMADs, yet no 
deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB) for these molecules has so far been identified. 
This has left unexplored the possibility that ubiquitylation of R-SMADs is 
reversible and engaged in regulating SMAD function, in addition to degradation. 
Here we identify USP15 as a DUB for R-SMADs. USP15 is required for TGFβ and BMP 
responses in mammalian cells and Xenopus embryos. At the biochemical level, 
USP15 primarily opposes R-SMAD monoubiquitylation, which targets the DNA-binding 
domains of R-SMADs and prevents promoter recognition. As such, USP15 is critical 
for the occupancy of endogenous target promoters by the SMAD complex. These data 
identify an additional layer of control by which the ubiquitin system regulates 
TGFβ biology.
