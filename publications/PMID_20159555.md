Misfolding and aggregation are associated with cytotoxicity in several protein 
folding diseases. A large network of molecular chaperones ensures protein 
quality control. Here, we show that within the Hsp70, Hsp110, and Hsp40 (DNAJ) 
chaperone families, members of a subclass of the DNAJB family (particularly 
DNAJB6b and DNAJB8) are superior suppressors of aggregation and toxicity of 
disease-associated polyglutamine proteins. The antiaggregation activity is 
largely independent of the N-terminal Hsp70-interacting J-domain. Rather, a 
C-terminal serine-rich (SSF-SST) region and the C-terminal tail are essential. 
The SSF-SST region is involved in substrate binding, formation of polydisperse 
oligomeric complexes, and interaction with histone deacetylases (HDAC4, HDAC6, 
SIRT2). Inhibiting HDAC4 reduced DNAJB8 function. DNAJB8 is (de)acetylated at 
two conserved C-terminal lysines that are not involved in substrate binding, but 
do play a role in suppressing protein aggregation. Combined, our data provide a 
functional link between HDACs and DNAJs in suppressing cytotoxic protein 
aggregation.
