Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDKs), an evolutionarily conserved family of 
proteins, synthesize nucleoside triphosphates from nucleoside diphosphates and 
ATP. Here, we have characterized the kinase activity and DNA processing 
functions of eight human proteins that contain at least one domain homologous to 
Escherichia coli NDK. Not all human proteins with NDK-like domains exhibited NDK 
activity when expressed as recombinant proteins in E. coli. Human NDK1 (NM23-H1) 
has been reported to have 3' --> 5' exonuclease activity. In addition to human 
NDK1, we also find that human NDK5, NDK7, and NDK8 contain 3' --> 5' exonuclease 
activity. Site-directed mutagenesis, competition assays between wild-type and 
mutant NDK proteins, and NMR studies confirmed that the DNA-binding and 3' --> 
5' exonuclease activity of human NDK1 is an intrinsic activity of the protein. 
Using double-stranded DNA substrates containing modified bases, human NDK1 
efficiently excised nucleotides from the single-strand break produced by APE1 or 
Nth1. When human cells were treated with various DNA-damaging agents, human NDK1 
translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. These results suggest that, in 
addition to maintenance of nucleotide pool balance, the human NDK-like proteins 
may have previously unrecognized roles in DNA nucleolytic processing.
