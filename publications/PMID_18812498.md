COP1 (for CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1) and the four partially redundant SPA 
(for SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA) proteins work in concert to repress photomorphogenesis 
in Arabidopsis thaliana by targeting key transcription factors and phytochrome A 
for degradation via the 26S proteasome. Here, we report a detailed biochemical 
characterization of the SPA-COP1 complexes. The four endogenous SPA proteins can 
form stable complexes with COP1 in vivo regardless of light conditions but 
exhibit distinct expression profiles in different tissues and light conditions. 
The SPA proteins can self-associate or interact with each other, forming a 
heterogeneous group of SPA-COP1 complexes in which the exact SPA protein 
compositions vary depending on the abundance of individual SPA proteins. The 
four SPA proteins could be divided into two functional groups depending on their 
interaction affinities, their regulation of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 degradation, 
and their opposite effects on COP1 protein accumulation. Loss-of-function 
mutations in a predominant SPA protein may cause a significant reduction in the 
overall SPA-COP1 E3 ligase activity, resulting in a partial constitutive 
photomorphogenic phenotype. This study thus provides an in-depth biochemical 
view of the SPA-COP1 E3 ligase complexes and offers new insights into the 
molecular basis for their distinct roles in the light control of plant 
development.

Abstract

COP1 (for CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1) and the four partially redundant SPA (for SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA) proteins work in concert to repress photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana by targeting key transcription factors and phytochrome A for degradation via the 26S proteasome. Here, we report a detailed biochemical characterization of the SPA-COP1 complexes. The four endogenous SPA proteins can form stable complexes with COP1 in vivo regardless of light conditions but exhibit distinct expression profiles in different tissues and light conditions. The SPA proteins can self-associate or interact with each other, forming a heterogeneous group of SPA-COP1 complexes in which the exact SPA protein compositions vary depending on the abundance of individual SPA proteins. The four SPA proteins could be divided into two functional groups depending on their interaction affinities, their regulation of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 degradation, and their opposite effects on COP1 protein accumulation. Loss-of-function mutations in a predominant SPA protein may cause a significant reduction in the overall SPA-COP1 E3 ligase activity, resulting in a partial constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype. This study thus provides an in-depth biochemical view of the SPA-COP1 E3 ligase complexes and offers new insights into the molecular basis for their distinct roles in the light control of plant development.

INTRODUCTION

Being sessile organisms, plants have evolved the capacity to optimize their growth in response to their light environment. Arabidopsis thaliana possesses several photoreceptors to mediate the perception of light signals ( Neff et al., 2000 ), including the far-red and red light (600 to 750 nm)–sensing phytochromes (PHYA to PHYE), the UV-A/blue light (320 to 500 nm)–perceiving cryptochromes and phototropins, and the not-yet identified UV-B light receptors ( Ulm and Nagy, 2005 ; Rockwell et al., 2006 ; Li and Yang, 2007 ). Activation of these photoreceptors, through distinct signal transduction pathways, leads to altered gene expression and photomorphogenic development.

A group of 11 CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC/DE-ETIOLATED/FUSCA ( COP/DET/FUS ) genes has been identified by screening for mutants that display a pleiotropic constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype in darkness ( Schwechheimer and Deng, 2000 ; Yi and Deng, 2005 ). These genes act as negative regulators of the light control of plant development ( Hoecker, 2005 ). Biochemically, these COP/DET/FUS proteins belong to three groups of protein complexes: the COP1 complex(es), the COP9 signalosome (CSN), and the CDD complex (COP10, DDB1, and DET1). It has been hypothesized that all three complexes function collectively in the ubiquitination/proteasome-mediated degradation of key photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription factors, thus achieving their repression of photomorphogenesis ( Yanagawa et al., 2004 ; Chen et al., 2006 ).

Among these COP/DET/FUS proteins, COP1 is a point of convergence downstream of multiple light signals ( von Arnim and Deng, 1994 ; Osterlund and Deng, 1998 ), acting as a central repressor of photomorphogenesis that can be inactivated by visible light and UV-A light. However, COP1 also acts as a positive regulator for several specific responses in tolerance toward low levels of UV-B light and possibly in a response mediated by PHYB ( Boccalandro et al., 2004 ; Oravecz et al., 2006 ). Molecularly, COP1 acts as an E3 ligase to target several photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription factors, such as ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) ( Osterlund et al., 2000b ), LONG AFTER FAR-RED LIGHT1 ( Seo et al., 2003 ), and LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED1 (HFR1) ( Duek et al., 2004 ; Jang et al., 2005 ; Yang et al., 2005 ; Lin and Wang, 2007 ), for degradation via the 26S proteasome. In addition, the far-red light photoreceptor phyA ( Seo et al., 2004 ) and the blue light photoreceptor cry2 ( Wang et al., 2001 ; Shalitin et al., 2002 ) are also likely targets of COP1. COP1 contains three structural domains: an N-terminal RING finger domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal WD-repeat domain.

SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA (SPA1) was first identified as a repressor of a weak phyA mutation ( Hoecker et al., 1998 , 1999 ), and it encodes a 115-kD protein that contains an N-terminal kinase-like domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal WD-repeat domain ( Hoecker et al., 1999 ). In Arabidopsis , there are three SPA1-like proteins: SPA2, SPA3, and SPA4. Mutation in each individual SPA protein causes a weak or no phenotype defect, while the quadruple spa mutant displays a constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype similar to that of a strong cop1 mutant allele ( cop1-5 ). Systematic phenotypic analysis of various combinations of spa mutants indicated that the four SPA genes confer partially redundant but not completely overlapping functions in mediating light responses at both seedling and adult stages ( Laubinger and Hoecker, 2003 ; Hoecker et al., 2004 ; Laubinger et al., 2004 , 2006 ; Ishikawa et al., 2006 ).

Genetic interaction between cop1 and spa mutations and the detected physical interaction between the proteins led to the proposition that COP1 works in concert with the SPA protein family to repress photomorphogenesis ( Hoecker and Quail, 2001 ; Baumgardt et al., 2002 ; Laubinger and Hoecker, 2003 ; Lin and Wang, 2007 ). However, the exact nature of their interaction and relationship in response to distinct light signals remains largely unknown. Among these SPA proteins, SPA1 is the most extensively characterized, and its biochemical interaction with COP1 has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. It has been shown that SPA1 cofractionates with COP1 in high-molecular-weight complex(es) and that SPA1 can modulate the COP1 E3 ligase activity in vitro ( Saijo et al., 2003 ; Seo et al., 2003 ). However, it is not clear exactly how SPA1 and other SPA proteins contribute to the architecture of COP1 complex(es). In addition, the molecular basis for the partially overlapping as well as distinct functions of SPA1 to SPA4 remains to be elucidated. Due to the central role of the COP1 E3 ligase activity in regulating light signaling, a detailed biochemical characterization of SPA proteins and their functional relationship with COP1 is highly desirable.

Here, by generating SPA member–specific antibodies and transgenic plants expressing epitope-tagged SPA fusion proteins, we have characterized each member of the SPA family at the protein level and have elucidated their interactions in a systematic manner. We have documented the distinct expression profiles of each endogenous SPA protein under various light conditions and at different developmental stages. Our biochemical analysis has demonstrated that COP1 and all four SPA proteins are interdependent in forming a heterogeneous group of functional SPA-COP1 complexes in Arabidopsis . Our data suggest that each complex may contribute unequally to the regulated proteolysis of substrates such as HY5, thus contributing to the fine-tuning of the light control of plant development.

Loss of the Pleiotropic COP/DET/FUS Proteins Results in a Significant Increase in SPA Protein Accumulation

The COP/DET/FUS proteins are known to be important negative regulators of photomorphogenesis ( Kim et al., 2002 ; Serino and Deng, 2003 ). To test the possible involvement of other COP/DET/FUS proteins in regulating SPA proteins, we examined the expression of SPA proteins in dark-grown cop1-6 , cop9-1 , cop10-1 , and det1-1 mutants. We observed that both COP1 and SPA proteins accumulated at high levels in both cop9-1 and det1-1 backgrounds ( Figure 11 ). In the absence of COP10, accumulation of SPA2 and COP1 was slightly decreased compared with the wild-type. However, the abundance of SPA1, SPA3, and SPA4 was upregulated in the cop10-1 lethal allele. Our data suggest that these COP/DET/FUS proteins also play a role in regulating the steady state levels of SPA proteins.

DISCUSSION

Prior to this investigation, our knowledge about the SPA gene family was based on genetic and molecular characterization of these genes ( Hoecker, 2005 ; Yi and Deng, 2005 ). Although there were data from several groups demonstrating the functional interdependence of COP1 and SPA1 ( Saijo et al., 2003 ; Laubinger et al., 2004 ; Yang and Wang, 2006 ), the biochemical relationship between COP1 and the whole SPA protein family remained unclear. Therefore, we generated member-specific antibodies against SPA proteins as well as epitope-tagged SPA transgenic plants for biochemical characterization of the interdependence of those five proteins. Our analyses using these resources provide evidence to support the conclusion that COP1 and SPA proteins form a heterogeneous group of complexes in vivo and also provide critical insight into the compositional configuration of these complexes. Thus, our work adds an important dimension to prior genetic analyses of the SPA protein family and builds a platform for further understanding the molecular action mechanisms of SPA-COP1 protein complexes.
