The human heat-shock protein multigene family comprises several highly conserved 
proteins with structural and functional properties in common, but which vary in 
the extent of their inducibility in response to metabolic stress. We have 
isolated and characterized a novel human HSP70 cDNA, HSP70B' cDNA, and its 
corresponding gene sequence. HSP70B' cDNA hybrid-selected an mRNA encoding a 
more basic 70 kDa heat-shock protein that both the major stress-inducible HSP70 
and constitutively expressed HSC70 heat-shock proteins, which in common with 
other heat-shock 70 kDa proteins bound ATP. The complete HSP70B' gene was 
sequenced and, like the major inducible HSP70 gene, is devoid of introns. The 
HSP70B' gene has 77% sequence similarity to the HSP70 gene and 70% similarity to 
HSC70 cDNA, with greatest sequence divergence towards the 3'-terminus. The 
HSP70B' gene represents a functional gene, as indicated by Northern-blot 
analysis with specific oligonucleotides, hybrid-selected translation with a 
specific 3' cDNA sequence and S1 nuclease protection experiments. In contrast 
with HSP70 mRNA, which is present at low concentrations in HeLa cells and 
readily induced by heat or CdCl2 treatment in both fibroblasts and HeLa cells, 
HSP70B' mRNA was induced only at higher temperature and showed no basal 
expression. The differences in patterns of induction may be due to the special 
features of the promoter region of the HSP70B' gene.
