The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor that is 
inactivated in many human cancers. PTEN loss has been associated with resistance 
to inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but the molecular 
basis of this resistance is unclear. It is believed that unopposed 
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) activation through multiple receptor 
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can relieve PTEN-deficient cancers from their 
"dependence" on EGFR or any other single RTK for survival. Here we report a 
distinct resistance mechanism whereby PTEN inactivation specifically raises EGFR 
activity by impairing the ligand-induced ubiquitylation and degradation of the 
activated receptor through destabilization of newly formed ubiquitin ligase Cbl 
complexes. PTEN-associated resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors is phenocopied 
by expression of dominant negative Cbl and can be overcome by more complete EGFR 
kinase inhibition. PTEN inactivation does not confer resistance to inhibitors of 
the MET or PDGFRA kinase. Our study identifies a critical role for PTEN in EGFR 
signal termination and suggests that more potent EGFR inhibition should overcome 
resistance caused by PI3K pathway activation.

Abstract

The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor that is inactivated in many human cancers. PTEN loss has been associated with resistance to inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but the molecular basis of this resistance is unclear. It is believed that unopposed phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) activation through multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can relieve PTEN-deficient cancers from their “dependence” on EGFR or any other single RTK for survival. Here we report a distinct resistance mechanism whereby PTEN inactivation specifically raises EGFR activity by impairing the ligand-induced ubiquitylation and degradation of the activated receptor through destabilization of newly formed ubiquitin ligase Cbl complexes. PTEN-associated resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors is phenocopied by expression of dominant negative Cbl and can be overcome by more complete EGFR kinase inhibition. PTEN inactivation does not confer resistance to inhibitors of the MET or PDGFRA kinase. Our study identifies a critical role for PTEN in EGFR signal termination and suggests that more potent EGFR inhibition should overcome resistance caused by PI3K pathway activation.

Discussion

Our study describes a previously unrecognized role of the PTEN tumor suppressor in EGFR signal termination. Several mutant growth factor receptors found in human cancer have been shown to derive their oncogenic properties by escaping Cbl-mediated receptor down-regulation ( 13 ). It is intriguing to speculate that the strong genetic association between EGFR amplification and PTEN inactivation in glioblastoma ( Fig. S8 ) and perhaps other human cancers ( 14 ) is, at least in part, due to the effects of PTEN on EGFR signal output.

Several EGFR kinase domain mutants found in lung cancer and the EGFRvIII mutant ( Fig. S9 ) are substrates of the Cbl E3 ligase, albeit with reduced affinity relative to wild-type EGFR. In contrast to mutations in EGFR which impair Cbl recruitment to the mutant receptor ( 15 ), PTEN inactivation impairs EGFR signal termination at a later step during receptor down-regulation, namely the continued association between EGFR and Cbl family members ( Fig. 4 D ). Maintenance of the EGFR–Cbl complex is critical to counteract the activity of deubiquitylating enzymes in the early endosomal compartments and allow efficient interaction between fully ubiquitylated EGF receptors with members of the ESCRT complex ( 16 ). Whereas our results with mutant alleles of PTEN and Akt1 suggest that PTEN regulates EGFR signal termination, through its lipid phosphatase activity, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 -dependent and Akt-independent effects further contribute to the effects of PTEN inactivation on EGFR. Further work is required to dissect whether changes in the phosphoinositide pool caused by other oncogenic perturbations of the PI3K pathway may also affect the stability of the EGFR–CBL interaction.

Our results have several important implications for therapeutic targeting of growth factor receptors in cancer. Our finding that PTEN inactivation does not impair the cell death response of MET - or PDGFRA -amplified cancer cells to MET and PDGFR kinase inhibitors, respectively, is encouraging for future therapeutic attempts to target these growth factor receptors in cancer types with coexistent mutations in PTEN or PI3K. In terms of EGFR, we show that activation of the PI3K pathway does not relieve EGFR-driven cancer cells from their dependence on EGFR for survival but, instead, shifts the EGFR kinase inhibitor response curve toward drug concentrations, which may be difficult to reach in tumor tissue, in particular in the central nervous system ( 17 ). Our finding that the modest boost in EGFR activity conferred by PTEN inactivation is sufficient to confer resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors is reminiscent of the observation that the T790M-L858R EGFR mutant, responsible for about 50% of cases with acquired EGFR kinase inhibitor resistance in lung cancer ( 18 ), confers resistance even when present at an allelic frequency of only ∼3% ( 19 ). Collectively, these results indicate that maximal EGFR kinase inhibition, perhaps only achievable by pulsatile kinase inhibitor therapy ( 20 ) or multipronged attacks on the EGFR life cycle, remains a therapeutic goal for the treatment of EGFR mutant cancer harboring activating lesions in the PI3K pathway.
