Chitin is a highly acetylated compound and the second most abundant biopolymer 
in the world next to cellulose. Vertebrates are exposed to chitin both through 
food ingestion and when infected with parasites, and fungi and chitin modulate 
the immune response in different directions. We have identified a novel 
homotetrameric 55-kDa type II transmembrane protein encoded by the FIBCD1 gene 
and highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. The ectodomain of FIBCD1 is 
characterized by a coiled-coil region, a polycationic region and C-terminal 
fibrinogen-related domain that by disulfide linkage assembles the protein into 
tetramers. Functional analysis showed a high-affinity and calcium-dependent 
binding of acetylated components to the fibrinogen domain, and a function in 
endocytosis was demonstrated. Screening for ligands revealed that the FIBCD1 is 
a high-affinity receptor for chitin and chitin fragments. FIBCD1 may play an 
important role in controlling the exposure of intestine to chitin and chitin 
fragments, which is of great relevance for the immune defense against parasites 
and fungi and for immune response modulation.
