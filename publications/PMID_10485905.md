Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is an oligomeric C type lectin that promotes 
phagocytosis by binding to microbial surface carbohydrates. A 340-kDa 
glycoprotein (gp-340) has been shown to bind SP-D in the presence of calcium but 
does so independently of carbohydrate recognition. This protein exists both in a 
soluble form and in association with the membranes of alveolar macrophages. The 
primary structure of gp-340 has been established by molecular cloning, which 
yielded a 7,686-bp cDNA sequence encoding a polypeptide chain of 2, 413 amino 
acids. The domain organization features 13 scavenger receptor cysteine-rich 
(SRCR) domains, each separated by an SRCR-interspersed domain, except for SRCRs 
4 and 5, which are contiguous. The 13 SRCR domains are followed by two C1r/C1s 
Uegf Bmp1 domains separated by a 14th SRCR domain and a zona pellucida domain. 
gp-340 seems to be an alternative spliced form of DMBT1. Reverse 
transcription-PCR analysis showed that the main sites of synthesis of gp-340 are 
lung, trachea, salivary gland, small intestine, and stomach. 
Immunohistochemistry revealed strong staining for gp-340 in alveolar and other 
tissue macrophages. Immunostaining of the macrophage membrane was either uniform 
or focal in a way that suggested capping, whereas other macrophages showed 
strong intracellular staining within the phagosome/phagolysosome compartments. 
In some macrophages, SP-D and gp-340 were located in the same cellular 
compartment. Immunoreactive gp-340 was also found in epithelial cells of the 
small intestine and in the ducts of salivary glands. The distribution of gp-340 
in macrophages is compatible with a role as an opsonin receptor for SP-D.
