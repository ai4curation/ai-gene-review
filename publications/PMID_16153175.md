Cells reprogram gene expression in response to environmental changes by 
mobilizing transcriptional activators. The activator protein Gcn4 of the yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated by an intricate translational control 
mechanism, which is the primary focus of this review, and also by the modulation 
of its stability in response to nutrient availability. Translation of GCN4 mRNA 
is derepressed in amino acid-deprived cells, leading to transcriptional 
induction of nearly all genes encoding amino acid biosynthetic enzymes. The 
trans-acting proteins that control GCN4 translation have general functions in 
the initiation of protein synthesis, or regulate the activities of initiation 
factors, so that the molecular events that induce GCN4 translation also reduce 
the rate of general protein synthesis. This dual regulatory response enables 
cells to limit their consumption of amino acids while diverting resources into 
amino acid biosynthesis in nutrient-poor environments. Remarkably, mammalian 
cells use the same strategy to downregulate protein synthesis while inducing 
transcriptional activators of stress-response genes under various stressful 
conditions, including amino acid starvation.
