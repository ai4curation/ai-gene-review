Prefoldins (PFDNs) are evolutionary conserved co-chaperones, initially 
discovered in archaea but universally present in eukaryotes. PFDNs are 
prevalently organized into hetero-hexameric complexes. Although they have been 
overlooked since their discovery and their functions remain elusive, several 
reports indicate they act as co-chaperones escorting misfolded or non-native 
proteins to group II chaperonins. Unlike the eukaryotic PFDNs which interact 
with cytoskeletal components, the archaeal PFDNs can bind and stabilize a wide 
range of substrates, possibly due to their great structural diversity. The 
discovery of the unconventional RPB5 interactor (URI) PFDN-like complex (UPC) 
suggests that PFDNs have versatile functions and are required for different 
cellular processes, including an important role in cancer. Here, we summarize 
their functions across different species. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of 
PFDNs genomic alterations across cancer types by using large-scale cancer 
genomic data indicates that PFDNs are a new class of non-mutated proteins 
significantly overexpressed in some cancer types.
