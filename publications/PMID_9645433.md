Organisms synthesize heat shock proteins (HSPs) in response to sublethal heat 
stress and concomitantly acquire increased tolerance against a subsequent, 
otherwise lethal, heat shock. Heat shock factor (HSF) is essential for the 
transcription of many HSP genes. We report the isolation of two HSF genes, HSF3 
and HSF4, from an Arabidopsis cDNA library. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants were 
generated containing constructs that allow expression of HSF3 and HSF4 or the 
respective translational beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusions. Overexpression of 
HSF3 or HSF3-GUS, but not of HSF4 or HSF4-GUS, causes HSP synthesis at the 
non-heat-shock temperature of 25 degrees C in transgenic Arabidopsis. In 
transgenic plants bearing HSF3/HSF3-GUS, transcription of several heat shock 
genes is derepressed. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that 
derepression of the heat shock response is mediated by HSF3/HSF3-GUS functioning 
as transcription factor. HSF3/HSF3-GUS-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants show an 
increase in basal thermotolerance, indicating the importance of HSFs and 
HSF-regulated genes as determinants of thermoprotective processes. Plants 
transgenic for HSF3/HSF3-GUS exhibit no other obvious phenotypic alterations. 
Derepression of HSF activity upon overexpression suggests the titration of a 
negative regulator of HSF3 or an intrinsic constitutive activity of HSF3. We 
assume that stable overexpression of HSFs may be applied to other organisms as a 
means of derepressing the heat shock response.
