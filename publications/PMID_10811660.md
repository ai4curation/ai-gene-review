p23 is a co-chaperone for the heat shock protein, hsp90. This protein binds 
hsp90 and participates in the folding of a number of cell regulatory proteins, 
but its activities are still unclear. We have solved a crystal structure of 
human p23 lacking 35 residues at the COOH terminus. The structure reveals a 
disulfide-linked dimer with each subunit containing eight beta-strands in a 
compact antiparallel beta-sandwich fold. In solution, however, p23 is primarily 
monomeric and the dimer appears to be a minor component. Conserved residues are 
clustered on one face of the monomer and define a putative surface region and 
binding pocket for interaction(s) with hsp90 or protein substrates. p23 contains 
a COOH-terminal tail that is apparently less structured and is unresolved in the 
crystal structure. This tail is not needed for the binding of p23 to hsp90 or to 
complexes with the progesterone receptor. However, the tail is necessary for 
optimum active chaperoning of the progesterone receptor, as well as the passive 
chaperoning activity of p23 in assays measuring inhibition of heat-induced 
protein aggregation.
