The seven members of the 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) family encode highly 
conserved molecular chaperones essential for cell survival in Arabidopsis 
thaliana. Hsp90 are abundant proteins, localized in different compartments with 
AtHsp90.1-4 in the cytosol and AtHsp90.5-7 in different organelles. Among the 
AtHsp90, AtHsp90.1, is stress-inducible and shares comparatively low sequence 
identity with the constitutively expressed AtHsp90.2-4. Even though abundant 
information is available on mammalian cytosolic Hsp90 proteins, it is unknown 
whether cytosolic Hsp90 proteins display different structural and functional 
properties. We have now analyzed two A. thalianas cytosolic Hsp90s, AtHsp90.1 
and AtHsp90.3, for functional divergence. AtHsp90.3 showed higher holdase 
chaperone activity than AtHsp90.1, although both AtHsp90s exhibited effective 
chaperone activity. Size-exclusion chromatography revealed different oligomeric 
states distinguishing the two Hsp90 proteins. While AtHsp90.1 exists in several 
oligomeric states, including monomers, dimers and higher oligomers, AtHsp90.3 
exists predominantly in a high oligomeric state. High oligomeric state of 
AtHsp90.1 showed higher holdase chaperone activity than the respective monomer 
or dimer states. When high oligomeric forms of AtHsp90.1 and AtHsp90.3 are 
reduced by DTT, activity was reduced compared to that found in the native high 
oligomeric state. In addition, ATP-dependent foldase chaperone activity of 
AtHsp90.3 was higher with strong intrinsic ATPase activity than that of 
AtHsp90.1. As a conclusion, the two A. thaliana cytosolic Hsp90 proteins display 
different functional activities depending on structural differences, implying 
functional divergence although the proteins are localized to the same 
sub-cellular organelle.
