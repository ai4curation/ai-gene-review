BACKGROUND: Multiple intracellular transport pathways drive the formation, 
maintenance, and function of cilia, a compartmentalized organelle associated 
with motility, chemo-/mechano-/photosensation, and developmental signaling. 
These pathways include cilium-based intraflagellar transport (IFT) and poorly 
understood membrane trafficking events. Defects in ciliary transport contribute 
to the etiology of human ciliary disease such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). In 
this study, we employ the genetically tractable nematode Caenorhabditis elegans 
to investigate whether endocytosis genes function in cilium formation and/or the 
transport of ciliary membrane or ciliary proteins.
RESULTS: Here we show that localization of the clathrin light chain, AP-2 
clathrin adaptor, dynamin, and RAB-5 endocytic proteins overlaps with a 
morphologically discrete periciliary membrane compartment associated with 
sensory cilia. In addition, ciliary transmembrane proteins such as G 
protein-coupled receptors concentrate at periciliary membranes. Disruption of 
endocytic gene function causes expansion of ciliary and/or periciliary membranes 
as well as defects in the ciliary targeting and/or transport dynamics of ciliary 
transmembrane and IFT proteins. Finally, genetic analyses reveal that the 
ciliary membrane expansions in dynamin and AP-2 mutants require bbs-8 and rab-8 
function and that sensory signaling and endocytic genes may function in a common 
pathway to regulate ciliary membrane volume.
CONCLUSIONS: These data implicate C. elegans endocytosis proteins localized at 
the ciliary base in regulating ciliary and periciliary membrane volume and 
suggest that membrane retrieval from these compartments is counterbalanced by 
BBS-8 and RAB-8-mediated membrane delivery.
