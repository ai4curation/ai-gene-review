The Drosophila melanogaster circadian clock is generated by interlocked feedback 
loops, and null mutations in core genes such as period and timeless generate 
behavioral arrhythmicity in constant darkness. In light-dark cycles, the 
elevation in locomotor activity that usually anticipates the light on or off 
signals is severely compromised in these mutants. Light transduction pathways 
mediated by the rhodopsins and the dedicated circadian blue light photoreceptor 
cryptochrome are also critical in providing the circadian clock with entraining 
light signals from the environment. The cry(b) mutation reduces the light 
sensitivity of the fly's clock, yet locomotor activity rhythms in constant 
darkness or light-dark cycles are relatively normal, because the rhodopsins 
compensate for the lack of cryptochrome function. Remarkably, when we combined a 
period-null mutation with cry(b), circadian rhythmicity in locomotor behavior in 
light-dark cycles, as measured by a number of different criteria, was restored. 
This effect was significantly reduced in timeless-null mutant backgrounds. 
Circadian rhythmicity in constant darkness was not restored, and TIM protein did 
not exhibit oscillations in level or localize to the nuclei of brain neurons 
known to be essential for circadian locomotor activity. Therefore, we have 
uncovered residual rhythmicity in the absence of period gene function that may 
be mediated by a previously undescribed period-independent role for timeless in 
the Drosophila circadian pacemaker. Although we do not yet have a molecular 
correlate for these apparently iconoclastic observations, we provide a systems 
explanation for these results based on differential sensitivities of subsets of 
circadian pacemaker neurons to light.
