Thyroid development and formation vary among species, but in most species the 
thyroid morphogenesis consists of five stages: specification, budding, descent, 
bilobation and folliculogenesis. The detailed mechanisms of these stages have 
not been fully clarified. During early development, the cranial neural crest 
(CNC) contributes to the thyroid gland. The removal of the postotic CNC 
(corresponding to rhombomeres 6, 7 and 8, also known as the cardiac neural 
crest) results in abnormalities of the cardiovascular system, thymus, 
parathyroid glands, and thyroid gland. To investigate the influence of the CNC 
on thyroid bilobation process, we divided the CNC into two regions, the postotic 
CNC and the preotic CNC (from the mesencephalon to rhombomere 5) regions and 
examined. We found that preotic CNC-ablated embryos had a unilateral thyroid 
lobe, and confirmed the presence of a single lobe or the absence of lobes in 
postotic CNC-ablated chick embryos. The thyroid anlage in each region-ablated 
embryos was of a normal size at the descent stage, but at a later stage, the 
thyroid in preotic CNC-ablated embryos was of a normal size, conflicting with a 
previous report in which the thyroid was reduced in size in the postotic 
CNC-ablated embryos. The postotic CNC cells differentiated into connective 
tissues of the thyroid in quail-to-chick chimeras. In contrast, the preotic CNC 
cells did not differentiate into connective tissues of the thyroid. We found 
that preotic CNC cells encompassed the thyroid anlage from the specification 
stage to the descent stage. Finally, we found that endothelin-1 and endothelin 
type A receptor-knockout mice and bosentan (endothelin receptor 
antagonist)-treated chick embryos showed bilobation anomalies that included 
single-lobe formation. Therefore, not only the postotic CNC, but also the 
preotic CNC plays an important role in thyroid morphogenesis.
