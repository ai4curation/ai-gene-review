Type IV P-type ATPases (P4-ATPases) are putative phospholipid flippases that 
translocate phospholipids from the exoplasmic (lumenal) to the cytoplasmic 
leaflet of lipid bilayers and are believed to function in complex with CDC50 
proteins. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, five P4-ATPases are localized to specific 
cellular compartments and are required for vesicle-mediated protein transport 
from these compartments, suggesting a role for phospholipid translocation in 
vesicular transport. The human genome encodes 14 P4-ATPases and three CDC50 
proteins. However, the subcellular localization of human P4-ATPases and their 
interactions with CDC50 proteins are poorly understood. Here, we show that class 
5 (ATP10A, ATP10B, and ATP10D) and class 6 (ATP11A, ATP11B, and ATP11C) 
P4-ATPases require CDC50 proteins, primarily CDC50A, for their exit from the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and final subcellular localization. In contrast, 
class 2 P4-ATPases (ATP9A and ATP9B) are able to exit the ER in the absence of 
exogenous CDC50 expression: ATP9B, but not ATP11B, was able to exit the ER 
despite depletion of CDC50 proteins by RNAi. Although ATP9A and ATP9B show a 
high overall sequence similarity, ATP9A localizes to endosomes and the 
trans-Golgi network (TGN), whereas ATP9B localizes exclusively to the TGN. A 
chimeric ATP9 protein in which the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of ATP9A was 
replaced with the corresponding region of ATP9B was localized exclusively to the 
Golgi. These results indicate that ATP9B is able to exit the ER and localize to 
the TGN independently of CDC50 proteins and that this protein contains a Golgi 
localization signal in its N-terminal cytoplasmic region.
