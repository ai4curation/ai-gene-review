Group 1 of plant pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-1) and a variety of related 
mammalian proteins constitute a superfamily of proteins that share structural 
similarities. Little is known about their function, but all the family members 
identified to date are co-translationally translocated to the lumen of the 
endoplasmic reticulum and are secreted as soluble proteins or are targeted to 
vacuoles. Here we report the identification of a novel family member that 
localizes to the cytosolic site of the endomembrane system in mammalian cells. 
After detergent solubilization of isolated Golgi membranes, a 17 kDa protein was 
found associated with a low-density detergent-insoluble fraction. The amino-acid 
sequence, determined by microsequencing and molecular cloning, revealed a 
significant homology with the superfamily of PR-1 proteins. Golgi-associated 
PR-1 protein (GAPR-1) showed a brefeldin-A-sensitive Golgi localization in 
immunofluorescence. Interestingly, the protein remained associated with the 
microdomain fraction in the presence of Brefeldin A. By mass spectrometry, 
GAPR-1 was shown to be myristoylated. Immunoprecipitation of GAPR- 1 from Golgi 
membranes resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of caveolin-1, indicating a 
direct interaction between these two proteins. Myristoylation, together with 
protein-protein or electrostatic interactions at physiological pH owing to the 
highly basic pI of GAPR-1 (pI 9.4) could explain the strong membrane association 
of GAPR-1. Tissue screening revealed that GAPR-1 is not detectably expressed in 
liver, heart or adrenal glands. High expression was found in monocytes, 
leukocytes, lung, spleen and embryonic tissue. Consistent with the involvement 
of PR-1 proteins in the plant immune system, these data could indicate that 
GAPR-1 is involved in the immune system.
