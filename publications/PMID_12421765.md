Large proteins have multiple domains that are potentially capable of binding 
many kinds of partners. It is conceivable, therefore, that such proteins could 
function as an intricate framework of assembly protein complexes. To 
comprehensively study protein-protein interactions between large KIAA proteins, 
we have constructed a library composed of 1087 KIAA cDNA clones based on prior 
functional classifications done in silico. We were guided by two principles that 
raise the success rate for detecting interactions per tested combination: we 
avoided testing low-probability combinations, and reduced the number of 
potential false negatives that arise from the fact that large proteins cannot 
reliably be expressed in yeast. The latter was addressed by constructing a cDNA 
library comprised of random fragments encoding large proteins. Cytoplasmic 
domains of KIAA transmembrane proteins (>1000 amino acids) were used as bait for 
yeast two-hybrid screening. Our analyses reveal that several KIAA proteins 
bearing a transmembrane region have the capability of binding to other KIAA 
proteins containing domains (e.g., PDZ, SH3, rhoGEF, and spectrin) known to be 
localized to highly specialized submembranous sites, indicating that they 
participate in cellular junction formation, receptor or channel clustering, and 
intracellular signaling events. Our representative library should be a very 
useful resource for detecting previously unidentified interactions because it 
complements conventional expression libraries, which seldom contain large cDNAs.
