During oogenesis, mammalian eggs accumulate proteins required for early 
embryogenesis. Although limited data suggest a vital role of these maternal 
factors in chromatin reprogramming and embryonic genome activation, the full 
range of their functions in preimplantation development remains largely unknown. 
Here we report a role for maternal proteins in maintaining chromosome stability 
and euploidy in early-cleavage mouse embryogenesis. Filia, expressed in growing 
oocytes, encodes a protein that binds to MATER and participates in a subcortical 
maternal complex essential for cleavage-stage embryogenesis. The depletion of 
maternal stores of Filia impairs preimplantation embryo development with a high 
incidence of aneuploidy that results from abnormal spindle assembly, chromosome 
misalignment, and spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) inactivation. In helping to 
ensure normal spindle morphogenesis, Filia regulates the proper allocation of 
the key spindle assembly regulators (i.e., AURKA, PLK1, and gamma-tubulin) to 
the microtubule-organizing center via the RhoA signaling pathway. Concurrently, 
Filia is required for the placement of MAD2, an essential component of the SAC, 
to kinetochores to enable SAC function. Thus, Filia is central to integrating 
the spatiotemporal localization of regulators that helps ensure euploidy and 
high-quality cell cycle progression in preimplantation mouse development. 
Defects in the well-conserved human homologue could play a similar role and 
account for recurrent human fetal wastage.
