beta-Catenin is a multi-functional cellular component and a substrate for 
several protein kinases. Here we investigated the interaction of protein kinase 
CKII (casein kinase II) and beta-catenin. We show that CKII phosphorylates the 
N-terminal region of beta-catenin and we identified Ser29, Thr102, and Thr112 as 
substrates for the enzyme. We provide evidence that CKII regulates the 
cytoplasmic stability of beta-catenin and acts synergistically with GSK-3beta in 
the multi-protein complex that controls the degradation of beta-catenin. In 
comparing wild-type and Ser/Thr-mutant beta-catenin, a decreased affinity of the 
mutant protein to alpha-catenin was observed. Moreover, kinase assays in vitro 
demonstrate a CKII-dependent increase in the binding of wild-type beta-catenin 
with alpha-catenin. In line with that, cells expressing Ser/Thr-mutant 
beta-catenin exhibit an increased migratory potential, which correlates with an 
enhanced cytosolic localization and a reduced association with the cytoskeleton 
of the mutant protein. From these results we conclude that CKII regulates the 
function of beta-catenin in the cadherin adhesion complex as well as its 
cytoplasmic stability.
