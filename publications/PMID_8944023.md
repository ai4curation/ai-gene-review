The hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene, BRCA1, encodes a large 
polypeptide that contains the cysteine-rich RING motif, a zinc-binding domain 
found in a variety of regulatory proteins. Here we describe a novel protein that 
interacts in vivo with the N-terminal region of BRCA1. This BRCA1-associated 
RING domain (BARD1) protein contains an N-terminal RING motif, three tandem 
ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal sequence with significant homology to the 
phylogenetically conserved BRCT domains that lie near the C terminus of BRCA1. 
The BARD1/BRCA1 interaction is disrupted by BRCA1 missense mutations that 
segregate with breast cancer susceptibility, indicating that BARD1 may be 
involved in mediating tumour suppression by BRCA1.
