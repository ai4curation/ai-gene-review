We have studied transcription, expression, and membrane localization of 
components of the E-cadherin-catenin complex stage by stage during mouse 
preimplantation development. Maternal E-cadherin and alpha- and beta-catenin are 
stored as mRNA and/or protein in unfertilized eggs and are already assembled 
into a protein complex at this stage. After fertilization, it is likely that 
they mediate adhesion of early-stage blastomeres. Biosynthesis of plakoglobin is 
delayed relative to the other components. The temporal mRNA and protein 
expression patterns of the components of the cadherin-catenin complex correlate 
with the presence or absence of potential cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements 
(CPEs) in the 3'-UTRs of the respective cDNAs. Our results suggest that the 
components of the E-cadherin-catenin complex derived from both maternal and 
zygotic gene activity are increasingly accumulated and stored in a nonfunctional 
form during early cleavage stages and are ready to be used for compaction and 
the formation of the trophectodermal cell layer.
