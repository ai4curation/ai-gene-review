BACKGROUND: p53 influences genomic stability, apoptosis, autophagy, response to 
stress, and DNA damage. New p53-target genes could elucidate mechanisms through 
which p53 controls cell integrity and response to damage.
METHODS: DRAGO (drug-activated gene overexpressed, KIAA0247) was characterized 
by bioinformatics methods as well as by real-time polymerase chain reaction, 
chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays, time-lapse microscopy, and 
cell viability assays. Transgenic mice (94 p53(-/-) and 107 p53(+/-) mice on a 
C57BL/6J background) were used to assess DRAGO activity in vivo. Survival 
analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and the Mantel-Haenszel test. 
All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: We identified DRAGO as a new p53-responsive gene induced upon treatment 
with DNA-damaging agents. DRAGO is highly conserved, and its ectopic 
overexpression resulted in growth suppression and cell death. DRAGO(-/-) mice 
are viable without macroscopic alterations. However, in p53(-/-) or p53(+/-) 
mice, the deletion of both DRAGO alleles statistically significantly accelerated 
tumor development and shortened lifespan compared with p53(-/-) or p53(+/-) mice 
bearing wild-type DRAGO alleles (p53(-/-), DRAGO(-/-) mice: hazard ratio [HR] = 
3.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7 to 6.1, P < .001; p53(+/-), DRAGO(-/-) 
mice: HR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.3 to 4.0, P < .001; both groups compared with 
DRAGO(+/+) counterparts). DRAGO mRNA levels were statistically significantly 
reduced in advanced-stage, compared with early-stage, ovarian tumors, but no 
mutations were found in several human tumors. We show that DRAGO expression is 
regulated both at transcriptional-through p53 (and p73) and 
methylation-dependent control-and post-transcriptional levels by miRNAs.
CONCLUSIONS: DRAGO represents a new p53-dependent gene highly regulated in human 
cells and whose expression cooperates with p53 in tumor suppressor functions.

## Full Text

Methods

DRAGO (drug-activated gene overexpressed, KIAA0247 ) was characterized by bioinformatics methods as well as by real-time polymerase chain reaction, chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays, time-lapse microscopy, and cell viability assays. Transgenic mice (94 p53 −/− and 107 p53 +/− mice on a C57BL/6J background) were used to assess DRAGO activity in vivo. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan–Meier curves and the Mantel–Haenszel test. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

We identified DRAGO as a new p53-responsive gene induced upon treatment with DNA-damaging agents. DRAGO is highly conserved, and its ectopic overexpression resulted in growth suppression and cell death. DRAGO −/− mice are viable without macroscopic alterations. However, in p53 −/− or p53 +/− mice, the deletion of both DRAGO alleles statistically significantly accelerated tumor development and shortened lifespan compared with p53 −/− or p53 +/− mice bearing wild-type DRAGO alleles (p53 −/− , DRAGO −/− mice: hazard ratio [HR] = 3.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7 to 6.1, P < .001; p53 +/− , DRAGO −/− mice: HR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.3 to 4.0, P < .001; both groups compared with DRAGO +/+ counterparts). DRAGO mRNA levels were statistically significantly reduced in advanced-stage, compared with early-stage, ovarian tumors, but no mutations were found in several human tumors. We show that DRAGO expression is regulated both at transcriptional—through p53 (and p73) and methylation-dependent control—and post-transcriptional levels by miRNAs.

Conclusions

DRAGO represents a new p53-dependent gene highly regulated in human cells and whose expression cooperates with p53 in tumor suppressor functions.

Discussion

We have identified a new p53-responsive gene, named DRAGO , whose induction is lethal for the cells. Indeed 3T3 MEF transient transfection and the green fluorescent protein–DRAGO time-lapse experiments demonstrated that DRAGO-overexpressing cells underwent cell death a few hours after transfection. Consequently, we could not isolate stably transfected single-cell clones overexpressing the DRAGO protein.

Our in vitro data demonstrated that DRAGO is induced by p53 in response to cytotoxic insults, and we provided evidence that p73 is involved in DRAGO regulation as well. The overexpression of p53 (or p73) per se only slightly induces DRAGO expression, whereas treatment with drugs that are known to determine post-translational modifications of p53 and p73 causes a clear DRAGO overexpression. Nutlin-3, a compound known to induce overexpression of p53 by interfering with p53–mdm2 interaction is also able to induce DRAGO expression. This observation is not surprising because it has been reported that treatment with Nutlin-3 induces phosphorylation of p53 and γH2AX foci formation in cancer cells growing in vitro ( 23 , 26 ), consistent with the induction of DNA damage response. Interestingly, in the same cellular context, ultraviolet treatment does not induce DRAGO, and we could speculate that DNA damage is necessary but not sufficient to induce DRAGO, and either the extent of damage or the signal cascade activated by the different damage induction is an important factor determining its activation.

Knockdown of DRAGO expression by silencing RNA demonstrated that the gene is dispensable in physiological conditions and that it does not seem to be involved in the apoptosis/senescence–mediated response to stress. Data from the assessment of the DRAGO −/− murine phenotype were in accordance with those from the siRNA experiments, as these mice displayed a normal phenotype in physiological conditions. Despite DRAGO expression being dispensable for activation of the apoptosis/senescence response to several stresses in vitro, in human cancer different lines of evidence indicate that DRAGO behaves like an antioncogene. In stage III ovarian tumors, DRAGO mRNA level decreases compared with stage I tumors, even in the absence of mutations in the coding region of the gene. A similar finding has been reported for several oncosuppressive genes, such as p21 , ING3 , RASSF1A , RU NX3 , for which an inverse association between messenger expression levels and tumor progression has been described ( 27–30 ). Similar to DRAGO , these antioncogenes are rarely found mutated in tumors. Rather, mechanisms such as promoter methylation or post-transcriptional gene silencing are responsible for the reduction of the expression levels of these genes. We showed evidence that the same mechanisms are also implicated in DRAGO gene expression regulation. Our hypothesis supporting the role of DRAGO as an oncosuppressive gene is also corroborated by the finding that, in a clinical study, low DRAGO (KIAA0247) RNA levels detected in feces are associated with a reduced 5-year overall survival and increased tumor size in colorectal cancer patients ( 31 ).

In spite of the gene’s potential oncosuppressive features, DRAGO −/− mice did not develop spontaneous tumors, which, however, does not exclude a potential antioncogene activity. Similarly, other known oncosuppressor genes did not induce any apparent phenotype when knocked out in a mouse model ( 32 ). DRAGO displayed a protective effect against tumor onset and statistically significantly prolonged mouse survival in a p53 -defective background. Combined p53 DRAGO knockout mice showed a tumor distribution similar to either p53 +/− or p53 −/− single-mutant mice ( 25 ). Such results indicate that the oncosuppressive effect of DRAGO is independent of tumor type and that the gene inactivation accelerates tumor development. Also, the survival reduction observed in DRAGO +/− and DRAGO −/− mice on a p53 −/− background clearly demonstrates that other transcription factors besides p53 are responsible for DRAGO transactivation.

We propose a model in which DRAGO expression is strongly regulated at post-transcriptional level by miRNAs and/or proteins binding the adenine–uridine-rich elements located in the long 3’UTR of DRAGO . In case of irreversible damage, the gene is induced by p53, leading to cell death. In vitro experiments in p53 isogenic cell lines demonstrated the prominent role of p53 in transactivating DRAGO after treatment with cytotoxic agents. We hypothesize that p73 is also responsible for DRAGO regulation under physiological conditions.

Indeed we observed that deletion of DRAGO on a p53 +/− background resulted in a reduction in lifespan similarly to that observed in p53 +/− p73 +/− mice ( 33 ). We might speculate that DRAGO could be a major downstream effector of p73, besides its demonstrated regulation by p53, so that deletion of either p73 or DRAGO determines a similar outcome on p53 +/− mice. As reported in the Results, this potential role of p73 in transactivating DRAGO is compatible with the data from the luciferase and electromobility shift assay experiments. Thus, we might hypothesize that p73 is partially responsible for DRAGO expression in p53 knockout mice. Our hypothesis is supported by the evidence that tumor distribution in p53 +/− p73 +/− and p53 +/− DRAGO +/− mice is similar. Indeed sarcomas are the most common malignancies (50% for p53 +/− p73 +/− mice and approximately 60% for p53 +/− DRAGO +/− mice), followed by lymphomas (22.5% vs. approximately 25%) and carcinomas (27.5% vs. approximately 12%) ( 33 ).

One limitation of our study is that, despite several efforts, we could not produce a specific antibody recognizing DRAGO protein, and this prevented us from defining protein expression level in all experimental settings.

Our results highlighted a role in tumor suppression for DRAGO. Although direct evidence is yet to be presented, the data available so far would suggest a possible function in the immune response: KIAA0247 silencing determines a downregulation of CCL2 in response to lipopolysaccharides treatment in vitro ( 34 ); a microarray experiment showed that KIAA0247 is one of the few human genes always overexpressed in response to different inflammatory stresses ( 35 ); and data from microarray databases ( http://genomicdbdemo.bxgenomics.com/web/ and http://biogps.org ) show that KIAA0247 is expressed at higher levels in cells belonging to the immune system, both innate and adaptive ( Supplementary Figure 8 , available online). The only known functional domain present in DRAGO protein is a SUSHI domain, a domain shared by complement and adhesion proteins. Further studies are in progress to specifically address this point.
