Engagement of beta1 integrin receptors initiates an increase in intracellular 
calcium concentrations in T cells, potentially affecting calcium-sensitive 
signaling pathways. The calcium-activated cysteine protease, calpain, regulates 
a variety of cell functions by calcium-dependent limited proteolysis. To 
investigate the function of calpain in T cells, we sought to determine the role 
of this protease in calcium-dependent signaling events. Subsequent to elevations 
in intracellular calcium concentrations induced by ionomycin or adherence to 
fibronectin, calpain activity translocated to the cytoskeletal/membrane fraction 
of T cells. In addition, stimulation of T cells with these agents initiated the 
proteolytic cleavage of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B by calpain. Enzymatic 
cleavage of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B occurs near the endoplasmic 
reticulum-targeting sequence and results in the generation of an enzymatically 
active form of the phosphatase. Furthermore, we show that both the native and 
the cleaved forms of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B interact with p130(Cas) in 
T cells. This interaction may serve to relocate protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B 
to sites of focal contact resulting in potential interactions with substrates 
previously inaccessible to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated phosphatase. 
Thus, we describe a novel calcium-dependent signaling pathway in T cells that 
may mediate signals generated by beta1 integrin adherence to the extracellular 
matrix.
