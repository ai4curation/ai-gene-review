RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) determine RNA fate from synthesis to decay. 
Employing two complementary protocols for covalent UV crosslinking of RBPs to 
RNA, we describe a systematic, unbiased, and comprehensive approach, termed 
"interactome capture," to define the mRNA interactome of proliferating human 
HeLa cells. We identify 860 proteins that qualify as RBPs by biochemical and 
statistical criteria, adding more than 300 RBPs to those previously known and 
shedding light on RBPs in disease, RNA-binding enzymes of intermediary 
metabolism, RNA-binding kinases, and RNA-binding architectures. Unexpectedly, we 
find that many proteins of the HeLa mRNA interactome are highly intrinsically 
disordered and enriched in short repetitive amino acid motifs. Interactome 
capture is broadly applicable to study mRNA interactome composition and dynamics 
in varied biological settings.
