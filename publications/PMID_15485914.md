Abstract

In mammalian cells, DNA polymerase β (Polβ) functions in base excision repair. We have previously shown that Polβ-deficient mice exhibit extensive neuronal cell death (apoptosis) in the developing nervous system and that the mice die immediately after birth. Here, we studied potential roles in the phenotype for p53, which has been implicated in DNA damage sensing, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. We generated Polβ −/− p53 −/− double-mutant mice and found that p53 deficiency dramatically rescued neuronal apoptosis associated with Polβ deficiency, indicating that p53 mediates the apoptotic process in the nervous system. Importantly, proliferation and early differentiation of neuronal progenitors in Polβ −/− p53 −/− mice appeared normal, but their brains obviously displayed cytoarchitectural abnormalities; moreover, the mice, like Polβ −/− p53 +/+ mice, failed to survive after birth. Thus, we strongly suggest a crucial role for Polβ in the differentiation of specific neuronal cell types.

DISCUSSION

We have shown here that p53 deficiency rescues neuronal apoptosis in Polβ-deficient mice and that haploinsufficiency substantially does so as well (Fig. 3 ). We have also shown that p53 is activated by its serine-18 phosphorylation in developing telencephalons of Polβ-deficient mice (Fig. 2 ). These results indicate that the neuronal apoptosis associated with Polβ deficiency is mediated by the p53-dependent pathway. In addition, it should be noted that, like Polβ −/− p53 +/+ neonates, Polβ −/− p53 −/− neonates die shortly after birth.

The onset of p53-dependent repair or apoptosis is determined by the level of accumulated damaged DNA ( 36 ). There is ample biochemical evidence for functioning of Polβ mainly in the short-patch BER pathway to repair SSBs, which are mostly generated as intermediates of damaged bases metabolized by DNA glycosylase and AP endonuclease ( 46 ). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts defective in Polβ are highly sensitive to DNA alkylating agents but not to X-ray radiation ( 41 , 42 ), supporting in vivo that Polβ deficiency leads to defects in SSB repair but not in DSB repair. Thus, Polβ deficiency should result in increased levels of SSBs, even if the Polβ-independent long-patch BER is able to partially substitute for the short-patch BER. The increased SSB levels would stabilize and activate p53, leading to apoptosis during neuronal differentiation in Polβ −/− mice. In mice defective in Lig4, XRCC4, Ku70/80, or XRCC2, which all function in DSB repair, differentiating neurons undergo massive apoptosis ( 4 , 11 , 14 , 17 , 22 ). Therefore, in these mice, unrepaired DSBs are thought to be the cause of the apoptosis ( 4 , 11 , 14 , 17 , 22 ). The apoptosis in Lig4 −/− and XRCC4 −/− embryos is rescued by p53 deficiency ( 15 , 16 ). Lig4 −/− p53 −/− and XRCC4 −/− p53 −/− neonates can survive several weeks after birth without behavioral or neurological abnormalities. This is in sharp contrast with our observation that Polβ −/− p53 −/− neonates die shortly after birth. The degree and quality of rescue by p53 deficiency in repair-deficient mice appear to vary depending on the type and level of DNA damage. As discussed above, in Polβ −/− mice, the damage is most likely SSBs, but the possibility that these SSBs are subsequently converted into DSBs in the final DNA replication of neuronal progenitor cells cannot be ruled out.

In Polβ −/− p53 −/− mice at E13.5, early steps of neuronal differentiation seem to proceed normally, as judged by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 4 ). However, at E18.5, these and Polβ −/− p53 +/+ mice displayed serious cytoarchitectural defects in the major axonal tract (Fig. 5E and F ) (with more aberrant axonal tracts in the striatum [Fig. 5H and I ]) and the migration in GABAergic interneurons (Fig. 5K and L ). These results suggest that, although p53 deficiency indeed rescues neuronal apoptosis, these neurons are still incomplete as mature ones, implying that the deficiency cannot fully restore the neuronal development of at least certain cell types. The brain is composed of remarkably complex neuronal cell types and networks. In the development of the brain, cell migration, axon growth, and pathfinding are fundamental processes ( 12 ). Recent studies with knockout mice have identified a number of molecules responsible for such processes ( 30 , 32 ). Loss of these molecules severely affects the brain development and is critical for survival. The abnormal development of the nervous system observed in both Polβ −/− p53 −/− and Polβ −/− p53 +/+ mice at E18.5 may be responsible for death shortly after birth. In Lig4 −/− p53 −/− or XRCC4 −/− p53 −/− mice, severe defects in lymphogenesis are never recovered by p53 deficiency, implying that Lig4 or XRCC4 is a critical factor for lymphogenesis ( 15 , 16 ). Similarly, our finding that the neuronal differentiation in Polβ −/− mice is not completely rescued by p53 deficiency strongly suggests that Polβ is a critical factor for neurogenesis; that is, Polβ may absolutely be required for neuronal differentiation.

The reason why Polβ is required for neuronal differentiation remains obscure. One possibility is that in neuronal differentiation, a large amount of damaged bases and SSBs are generated by reactive oxygen species, which might occur particularly in some neuronal cell types actively undergoing migration and/or axon pathfinding. Recently, the Polβ-dependent pathway was shown to be induced in response to oxidative base damage ( 7 ). Polβ might specifically be required to repair those damaged bases and SSBs. Thus, Polβ deficiency would lead to increased levels of DNA damage and activation of p53, eventually resulting in apoptosis. A second possibility is that Polβ is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription in neuronal differentiation. When neuronal progenitor cells become postmitotic neurons, they exit cell cycle and drastically alter the pattern of gene expression from immature to mature neurons ( 12 ). Transcriptional activation of a gene involves recruitment of not only a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein but also a coactivator complex, including proteins with chromatin-modifying activity. For example, DNA topoisomerase IIβ alters DNA topology and forms complexes with proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription ( 25 , 44 ). The enzyme-deficient mice show defects in the laminar organization of the neocortex and motor axon growth, resulting in a breathing impairment and death of the pups shortly after birth ( 31 , 49 ). This finding suggests that the control of chromatin reorganization is indispensable for neuronal differentiation. Interestingly, we note that transcriptional coactivator p300 forms a physical and functional interaction with Polβ ( 23 ). p300 integrates a diverse signaling pathway for a number of sequence-specific transcription factors and activates transcription through chromatin remodeling via intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity ( 20 ). Therefore, in association with p300 or related proteins, Polβ might function to maintain the integrity of genes being, or to be, expressed in certain neuronal cell types. A third possibility is that during neuronal differentiation, a genomic rearrangement factor(s) is expressed and generates a certain type of DNA damage (repairable by Polβ) to initiate a specific differentiation. In the immune system, the molecular mechanism of diversity by rearrangement of the immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene clusters is well understood ( 43 ). In V(D)J recombination, the lymphocyte-specific endonucleases RAG1 and RAG2 initially cleave specific recognition sequences in immunoglobulin loci, followed by completion of rearrangements through DSB repair by the action of nonhomologous-end-joining factors ( 18 ). Similarly, in the nervous system, neuronal diversity might be created by such genomic rearrangement ( 9 , 48 ). If this is the case, DNA repair by Polβ would be an essential part of the diversity mechanism.

In conclusion, our studies show that p53 deficiency dramatically rescues neuronal apoptosis associated with Polβ deficiency, indicating that p53 mediates the apoptotic process in the nervous system. However, p53 deficiency cannot restore complete differentiation of neuronal progenitors and leads to lethality shortly after birth. These observations suggest a crucial role for Polβ in differentiation of specific neuronal cell types. In addition, it is evident that in neuronal differentiation, p53 acts as a gatekeeper to maintain genomic stability against various types of DNA damage ( 27 ). Further studies will be needed to elucidate the precise role of Polβ in neurogenesis.
