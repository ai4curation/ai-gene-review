Thalidomide-like drugs such as lenalidomide are clinically important treatments 
for multiple myeloma and show promise for other B cell malignancies. The 
biochemical mechanisms underlying their antitumor activity are unknown. 
Thalidomide was recently shown to bind to, and inhibit, the cereblon ubiquitin 
ligase. Cereblon loss in zebrafish causes fin defects reminiscent of the limb 
defects seen in children exposed to thalidomide in utero. Here we show that 
lenalidomide-bound cereblon acquires the ability to target for proteasomal 
degradation two specific B cell transcription factors, Ikaros family zinc finger 
proteins 1 and 3 (IKZF1 and IKZF3). Analysis of myeloma cell lines revealed that 
loss of IKZF1 and IKZF3 is both necessary and sufficient for lenalidomide's 
therapeutic effect, suggesting that the antitumor and teratogenic activities of 
thalidomide-like drugs are dissociable.
