Accumulation of expanded polyglutamine proteins is considered to be a major 
pathogenic biomarker of Huntington disease. We isolated SCAMP5 as a novel 
regulator of cellular accumulation of expanded polyglutamine track protein using 
cell-based aggregation assays. Ectopic expression of SCAMP5 augments the 
formation of ubiquitin-positive and detergent-resistant aggregates of mutant 
huntingtin (mtHTT). Expression of SCAMP5 is markedly increased in the striatum 
of Huntington disease patients and is induced in cultured striatal neurons by 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or by mtHTT. The increase of SCAMP5 impairs 
endocytosis, which in turn enhances mtHTT aggregation. On the contrary, 
down-regulation of SCAMP5 alleviates ER stress-induced mtHTT aggregation and 
endocytosis inhibition. Moreover, stereotactic injection into the striatum and 
intraperitoneal injection of tunicamycin significantly increase mtHTT 
aggregation in the striatum of R6/2 mice and in the cortex of N171-82Q mice, 
respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that exposure to ER stress 
increases SCAMP5 in the striatum, which positively regulates mtHTT aggregation 
via the endocytosis pathway.
