CENP-A (centromeric protein A), a histone H3 variant, specifies centromere 
identity and is essential to centromere maintenance. Little is known about how 
protein levels of CENP-A are controlled in mammalian cells. Here, we report that 
the phosphorylation of CENP-A Ser68 primes the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated 
proteolysis of CENP-A during mitotic phase in human cultured cells. We identify 
two major polyubiquitination sites that are responsible for this 
phosphorylation-dependent degradation. Substituting the two residues, Lys49 and 
Lys124, with arginines abrogates proper CENP-A degradation and results in CENP-A 
mislocalization to non-centromeric regions. Furthermore, we find that DCAF11 
(DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 11/WDR23) is the E3 ligase that specifically 
mediates the observed polyubiquitination. Deletion of DCAF11 hampers CENP-A 
degradation and causes its mislocalization. We conclude that the Ser68 
phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating cellular CENP-A 
homeostasis via DCAF11-mediated degradation to prevent ectopic localization of 
CENP-A during the cell cycle.
