Malonyl-CoenzymeA acts as a fuel sensor, being both an intermediate of fatty 
acid synthesis and an inhibitor of the two known isoforms of carnitine 
palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I), which control mitochondrial fatty acid 
oxidation. We describe here a novel CPT1 family member whose mRNA is present 
predominantly in brain and testis. Chromosomal locations and genome organization 
are reported for the mouse and human genes. The protein sequence contains all 
the residues known to be important for both carnitine acyltransferase activity 
and malonyl-CoA binding in other family members. Yeast expressed protein has no 
detectable catalytic activity with several different acyl-CoA esters that are 
good substrates for other carnitine acyltransferases, including the liver 
isoform of CPT I, which is also expressed in brain; however, it displays 
high-affinity malonyl-CoA binding. Thus this new CPT I related protein may be 
specialized for the metabolism of a distinct class of fatty acids involved in 
brain function.
