Heat shock 70 kDa proteins (HSP70s) are ubiquitous molecular chaperones that 
function in a myriad of biological processes, modulating polypeptide folding, 
degradation and translocation across membranes, and protein-protein 
interactions. This multitude of roles is not easily reconciled with the 
universality of the activity of HSP70s in ATP-dependent client protein-binding 
and release cycles. Much of the functional diversity of the HSP70s is driven by 
a diverse class of cofactors: J proteins. Often, multiple J proteins function 
with a single HSP70. Some target HSP70 activity to clients at precise locations 
in cells and others bind client proteins directly, thereby delivering specific 
clients to HSP70 and directly determining their fate.
