Dipeptidase 3 (DPEP3) is one of three glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored 
metallopeptidases potentially involved in the hydrolytic metabolism of 
dipeptides. While its exact biological function is not clear, DPEP3 expression 
is normally limited to testis, but can be elevated in ovarian cancer. Antibody 
drug conjugates targeting DPEP3 have shown efficacy in preclinical models with a 
pyrrolobenzodiazepine conjugate, SC-003, dosed in a phase I clinical trial 
(NCT02539719). Here we reveal the novel atomic structure of DPEP3 alone and in 
complex with the SC-003 Fab fragment at 1.8 and 2.8 Å, respectively. The 
structure of DPEP3/SC-003 Fab complex reveals an eighteen-residue epitope across 
the DPEP3 dimerization interface distinct from the enzymatic active site. DPEP1 
and DPEP3 extracellular domains share a conserved, dimeric TIM (β/α)8-barrel 
fold, consistent with 49% sequence identity. However, DPEP3 diverges from DPEP1 
and DPEP2 in key positions of its active site: a histidine to tyrosine variation 
at position 269 reduces affinity for the β zinc and may cause substrate steric 
hindrance, whereas an aspartate to asparagine change at position 359 abolishes 
activation of the nucleophilic water/hydroxide, resulting in no in vitro 
activity against a variety of dipeptides and biological substrates (imipenem, 
leukotriene D4 and cystinyl-bis-glycine). Hence DPEP3, unlike DPEP1 and DPEP2, 
may require an activating co-factor in vivo or may remain an inactive, 
degenerate enzyme. This report sheds light on the structural discriminants 
between active and inactive membrane dipeptidases and provides a benchmark to 
characterize current and future DPEP3-targeted therapeutic approaches.
