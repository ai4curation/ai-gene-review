Escherichia coli heat-shock proteins GroES and GroEL are essential cytoplasmic 
proteins, which have been termed 'chaperonins' because of their ability to 
assist protein assembly of bacteriophage capsids and multimeric enzymes of 
foreign origin. In this report we show that temperature-sensitive mutations in 
groES and groEL genes cause defective export of the plasmid-encoded 
beta-lactamase (Bla) in vivo. Since efficient translocation of proteins across 
biological membranes is thought to be supported by cytoplasmic factors that 
protect presecretory molecules from being misfolded, these results suggest that 
both GroES and GroEL proteins possess a chaperone function by which they 
facilitate export of Bla. The translocation of other secretory proteins, 
however, appears to depend minimally on GroE, suggesting that GroE interacts 
only with a specific class of secreted proteins.
