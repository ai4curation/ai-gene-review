Light and copper are important environmental determinants of plant growth and 
development. Despite the wealth of knowledge on both light and copper signaling, 
the molecular mechanisms that integrate the two pathways remain poorly 
understood. Here, we use Arabidopsis thaliana to demonstrate an interaction 
between SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE7 (SPL7) and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 
(HY5), which mediate copper and light signaling, respectively. Through 
whole-genome chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing analyses, we 
elucidated the SPL7 regulon and compared it with that of HY5. We found that the 
two transcription factors coregulate many genes, including those involved in 
anthocyanin accumulation and photosynthesis. Moreover, SPL7 and HY5 act 
coordinately to transcriptionally regulate MIR408, which results in differential 
expression of microRNA408 (miR408) and its target genes in response to changing 
light and copper conditions. We demonstrate that this regulation is tied to 
copper allocation to the chloroplast and plastocyanin levels. Finally, we found 
that constitutively activated miR408 rescues the distinct developmental defects 
of the hy5, spl7, and hy5 spl7 mutants. These findings revealed the existence of 
crosstalk between light and copper, mediated by a HY5-SPL7 network. Furthermore, 
integration of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation is critical 
for governing proper metabolism and development in response to combined copper 
and light signaling.

Abstract

Light and copper are important environmental determinants of plant growth and development. Despite the wealth of knowledge on both light and copper signaling, the molecular mechanisms that integrate the two pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we use Arabidopsis thaliana to demonstrate an interaction between SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE7 ( SPL7 ) and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 ( HY5 ), which mediate copper and light signaling, respectively. Through whole-genome chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing analyses, we elucidated the SPL7 regulon and compared it with that of HY5 . We found that the two transcription factors coregulate many genes, including those involved in anthocyanin accumulation and photosynthesis. Moreover, SPL7 and HY5 act coordinately to transcriptionally regulate MIR408 , which results in differential expression of microRNA408 (miR408) and its target genes in response to changing light and copper conditions. We demonstrate that this regulation is tied to copper allocation to the chloroplast and plastocyanin levels. Finally, we found that constitutively activated miR408 rescues the distinct developmental defects of the hy5 , spl7 , and hy5 spl7 mutants. These findings revealed the existence of crosstalk between light and copper, mediated by a HY5-SPL7 network. Furthermore, integration of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation is critical for governing proper metabolism and development in response to combined copper and light signaling.

INTRODUCTION

Essentially sessile in nature, plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to maintain metabolic homeostasis and a remarkable capacity to reprogram development when resource levels vary. Light and copper are among the most important environmental factors for plant growth. In addition to providing a source of energy, light regulates many plant processes and induces massive reprogramming of the transcriptome ( Chen et al., 2004 ; Jiao et al., 2007 ). Genetic and molecular approaches in Arabidopsis thaliana have identified many regulatory factors and pathways required for proper light signaling. ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 ( HY5 ) encodes a bZIP-type transcription factor that functions downstream of multiple photoreceptors to promote photomorphogenesis ( Oyama et al., 1997 ; Ang et al., 1998 ). Detailed characterization of the hy5 mutants revealed myriad phenotypic defects, including elongated hypocotyl, reduced pigment content, aberrant chloroplast development, altered root morphology, and compromised hormonal responses ( Oyama et al., 1997 ; Cluis et al., 2004 ; Vandenbussche et al., 2007 ). HY5 binds to G-box-like motifs in the light-responsive promoters ( Chattopadhyay et al., 1998 ; Yadav et al., 2002 ; Shin et al., 2007 ; Song et al., 2008 ). Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) coupled tiling microarray analysis showed that HY5 binds to ∼40% of the coding loci in the Arabidopsis genome and detectably impacts the expression level of ∼3000 genes ( Lee et al., 2007 ; Zhang et al., 2011 ).

As a transition metal, copper is an essential cofactor for numerous proteins. The most abundant copper protein in plants is plastocyanin ( PC ), which transfers electrons from the cytochrome b 6 f complex to photosystem I ( Burkhead et al., 2009 ). Copper is also used as a cofactor by plant proteins involved in neutralizing reactive oxygen species, lignification of the cell wall, ethylene perception, and formation of phenolics in response to pathogens ( Burkhead et al., 2009 ). Regulating the abundance of these proteins is important to maintain copper homeostasis and prioritize the use of cellular copper in plants. Studies in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii revealed COPPER RESPONSE REGULATOR1 (CRR1) as a zinc finger transcription factor that is specifically activated under copper deficiency ( Kropat et al., 2005 ). The GTAC motif found in CRR1 targets is recognized as the core of copper-response elements in diverse plants ( Quinn and Merchant, 1995 ; Quinn et al., 1999 ; Kropat et al., 2005 ; Nagae et al., 2008 ; Yamasaki et al., 2009 ). In Arabidopsis , SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE7 ( SPL7 ) is orthologous to CRR1 ( Yamasaki et al., 2009 ). In spl7 mutants, many of the genes related to copper homeostasis, including the transporters COPT1 and COPT2, the copper chaperones CCH and CCS, as well as the copper/zinc superoxide dismutases CSD1 and CSD2, are dysregulated ( Yamasaki et al., 2009 ; Bernal et al., 2012 ). Copper specifically inhibits the DNA binding activity of both CRR1 and SPL7 and prevents transcription activation in vitro ( Sommer et al., 2010 ). Thus, Arabidopsis SPL7 likely functions as a copper sensor that regulates gene expression in response to changing cellular copper levels ( Sommer et al., 2010 ).

In addition to transcriptional regulators, microRNAs ( miRNAs ) are emerging as a class of sequence-specific, trans -acting regulatory small RNA molecules that modulate gene expression mainly at the posttranscriptional level. After processing from stem-loop-structured precursors and integration into the RNA-induced silencing complex, miRNAs function in general as gene repressors by directing the cleavage or translational repression of the target transcripts ( Voinnet, 2009 ). The large numbers of miRNAs in eukaryotes entail an increased complexity of gene regulatory mechanisms. In plants, miRNAs have been implicated in light and copper signaling. A global ChIP analysis also observed HY5 occupancy at the promoter region of eight miRNAs ( Zhang et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, several miRNAs were predicted to target transcripts encoding copper proteins ( Jones-Rhoades and Bartel, 2004 ; Sunkar et al., 2006 ; Yamasaki et al., 2007 ; Abdel-Ghany and Pilon, 2008 ). Their expression was induced by copper deficiency in an SPL7 -dependent manner ( Yamasaki et al., 2009 ; Bernal et al., 2012 ). It was thus hypothesized that these miRNAs repress nonessential copper proteins (such as CSD1 and CSD2) and their chaperone to save copper for essential proteins such as PC under impending deficiency ( Yamasaki et al., 2007 ).

However, how light and copper signals work together to regulate gene expression for optimal plant growth and development is poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate the interaction between SPL7 and HY5 , providing evidence for the integration of copper and light signaling. By elucidating the SPL7 regulon through ChIP and RNA sequencing and comparing it with the previously identified HY5 regulon ( Zhang et al., 2011 ), we found that these two transcription factors have significant overlap in terms of the genes they bind directly and the genes whose expression levels they regulate. Furthermore, we show that microRNA408 (miR408) is a critical component of the SPL7-HY5 network and that constitutively activated miR408 rescues the developmental defects of the hy5 , spl7 , and hy5 spl7 mutants. These findings thus revealed a molecular basis incorporating transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations for coordinated plant responses to changing copper and light regimens.

DISCUSSION

The regulation of gene expression is fundamental to the integrity and function of all organisms. We now appreciate that complex and sophisticated regulatory networks have evolved in plants for proper gene expression. In addition to transcription factors, miRNAs play crucial roles in the regulatory networks by modulating gene expression at the posttranscriptional level ( Voinnet, 2009 ). In the context of regulatory networks, one of the major challenges to understanding gene expression is to identify and analyze regulatory gene circuits incorporating both transcriptional and posttranscriptional control mechanisms. Such inquires should provide much-needed insights into dynamic gene activity that is critical for plant development and responses to environmental changes.
