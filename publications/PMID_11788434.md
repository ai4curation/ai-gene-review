Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain or PDGF beta-receptor-deficient 
mice lack mesangial cells. To explore potential mechanisms for failure of PDGF 
A-chain to rescue mesangial cell phenotype, we investigated the biological 
effects and signaling pathways of PDGF AA and PDGF BB in metanephric mesenchymal 
(MM) cells isolated from rat kidney. PDGF AA caused modest cell migration but 
had no effect on DNA synthesis, unlike PDGF BB, which potently stimulated 
migration and DNA synthesis. PDGF AA and PDGF BB significantly increased the 
activities of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) and mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK). PDGF BB was more potent than PDGF AA in activating PI 3-K 
or MAPK in these cells. Pretreatment of MM cells with the MAPK kinase (MEK) 
inhibitor PD-098059 abrogated PDGF BB-induced DNA synthesis, whereas the PI 3-K 
inhibitor wortmannin had a very modest inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis 
(approximately Delta20%). On the other hand, wortmannin completely blocked PDGF 
AA- and PDGF BB-induced migration, whereas PD-098059 had a modest inhibitory 
effect on cell migration. These data demonstrate that activation of MAPK is 
necessary for the mitogenic effect of PDGF BB, whereas PI 3-K is required for 
the chemotactic effect of PDGF AA and PDGF BB. Although PDGF AA stimulates PI 
3-K and MAPK activity, it is not mitogenic and only modestly chemotactic. 
Collectively, the data may have implications related to the failure of PDGF AA 
to rescue mesangial cell phenotype in PDGF B-chain or PDGF-beta-receptor 
deficiency.
