Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) is an abundant heparin-binding plasma protein 
that efficiently arrests growth and vascularization of mouse tumor models. We 
have shown that the antiangiogenic effect of HRGP is dependent on its 
histidine/proline-rich domain, which needs to be released from the mother 
protein to exert its effects. Here we identify a 35-amino-acid peptide, HRGP330, 
derived from the histidine/proline-rich domain as endowed with antiangiogenic 
properties in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of action of HRGP330 involves 
subversion of focal adhesion function by disruption of integrin-linked kinase 
(ILK) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) functions, inhibition of vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the FAK 
substrate alpha-actinin, and, as a consequence, an arrest in endothelial cell 
motility. The disturbed focal adhesion function is reflected in the ability of 
HRGP as well as of HRGP330 to prevent endothelial cell adhesion to vitronectin 
in a manner involving alpha(v)beta3 integrin. In conclusion, HRGP330, which we 
define as the minimal antiangiogenic domain of HRGP, exerts its effects through 
signal transduction targeting focal adhesions, thereby interrupting VEGF-induced 
endothelial cell motility.
