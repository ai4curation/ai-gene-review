In yeast, environmental stresses provoke sudden and dramatic increases in gene 
expression at stress-inducible loci. Stress gene transcription is accompanied by 
the transient eviction of histones from the promoter and the transcribed regions 
of these genes. We found that mutants defective in subunits of the INO80 
complex, as well as in several histone chaperone systems, exhibit extended 
expression windows that can be correlated with a distinct delay in histone 
redeposition during adaptation. Surprisingly, Ino80 became associated with the 
ORFs of stress genes in a stress-specific way, suggesting a direct function in 
the repression during adaptation. This recruitment required elongation by RNA 
polymerase (Pol) II but none of the histone modifications that are usually 
associated with active transcription, such as H3 K4/K36 methylation. A mutant 
lacking the Asf1-associated H3K56 acetyltransferase Rtt109 or Asf1 itself also 
showed enhanced stress-induced transcript levels. Genetic data, however, suggest 
that Asf1 and Rtt109 function in parallel with INO80 to restore histone 
homeostasis, whereas Spt6 seems to have a function that overlaps that of the 
chromatin remodeler. Thus, chromatin remodeling by INO80 in cooperation with 
Spt6 determines the shape of the expression profile under acute stress 
conditions, possibly by an elongation-dependent mechanism.
