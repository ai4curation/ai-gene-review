HIC1, a tumor suppressor gene epigenetically silenced in many human cancers 
encodes a transcriptional repressor involved in regulatory loops modulating 
p53-dependent and E2F1-dependent cell survival and stress responses. HIC1 is 
also implicated in growth control since it recruits BRG1, one of the two 
alternative ATPases (BRM or BRG1) of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes to 
repress transcription of E2F1 in quiescent fibroblasts. Here, through yeast 
two-hybrid screening, we identify ARID1A/BAF250A, as a new HIC1 partner. 
ARID1A/BAF250A is one of the two mutually exclusive ARID1-containing subunits of 
SWI/SNF complexes which define subsets of complexes endowed with 
anti-proliferative properties. Co-immunoprecipitation assays in WI38 fibroblasts 
and in BRG1-/- SW13 cells showed that endogenous HIC1 and ARID1A proteins 
interact in a BRG1-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HIC1 does 
not interact with BRM. Finally, sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation 
(ChIP-reChIP) experiments demonstrated that HIC1 represses E2F1 through the 
recruitment of anti-proliferative SWI/SNF complexes containing ARID1A.
