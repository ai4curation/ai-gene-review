The amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) can generate cytotoxic oligomers, and their 
accumulation is thought to underlie the neuropathologic changes found in 
Alzheimer's disease. Known inhibitors of Abeta polymerization bind to undefined 
structures and can work as nonspecific aggregators, and inhibitors that target 
conformations that also occur in larger Abeta assemblies may even increase 
oligomer-derived toxicity. Here we report on an alternative approach whereby 
ligands are designed to bind and stabilize the 13-26 region of Abeta in an 
alpha-helical conformation, inspired by the postulated Abeta native structure. 
This is achieved with 2 different classes of compounds that also reduce Abeta 
toxicity to cells in culture and to hippocampal slice preparations, and that do 
not show any nonspecific aggregatory properties. In addition, when these 
inhibitors are administered to Drosophila melanogaster expressing human 
Abeta(1-42) in the central nervous system, a prolonged lifespan, increased 
locomotor activity, and reduced neurodegeneration is observed. We conclude that 
stabilization of the central Abeta alpha-helix counteracts polymerization into 
toxic assemblies and provides a strategy for development of specific inhibitors 
of Abeta polymerization.
