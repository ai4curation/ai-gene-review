Early heart development takes place through a complex series of steps, including 
the induction of cardiac mesoderm, formation of the cardiovascular progenitor 
cells and the commitment of cardiovascular lineage cells, such as cardiomyocytes 
(CMs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs). Recently, 
microRNAs, a family of endogenous, small non-coding RNAs, have been identified 
as critical regulators in cardiogenesis and cardiovascular disease. Previous 
studies demonstrated that microRNA-1 (miR-1) could promote cardiac 
differentiation from mouse and human embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, the 
underlying mechanism remained largely unclear. We performed microRNA deep 
sequencing among human ES cells, ES cell derived-multipotent cardiovascular 
progenitors (MCPs), and MCP-specified CMs, ECs, and SMCs. A specific enrichment 
of miR-1 was found in CMs, not in SMCs or ECs, implying a key role of miR-1 in 
determining cardiovascular commitment from MCPs. When overexpressed in human 
induced pluripotent stem cells, miR-1 enhanced the expression of key cardiac 
transcriptional factors and sarcomeric genes. Importantly, we found miR-1 
promoted CM differentiation and suppressed EC commitment from MCPs by modulating 
the activities of WNT and FGF signaling pathways. FZD7 and FRS2 were confirmed 
as miR-1 targets using luciferase reporter assay and western blot. Overall, this 
study reveals a fate-switching role of miR-1 at early human cardiovascular 
commitment stage via suppressing both WNT and FGF signaling pathways.
