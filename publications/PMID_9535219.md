A novel protein complex has been identified in human cells that has a molecular 
mass of approximately 450 kDa. It consists of at least eight different subunits 
including JAB1, the Jun activation-domain binding protein 1, and Trip15, the 
thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 15. The purified complex contains 
COP9 and COP11 protein homologs and is very similar, if not identical, to the 
plant COP9 complex involved in light-mediated signal transduction. The isolated 
JAB1-containing particle has kinase activity that phosphorylates IkappaBalpha, 
the carboxy terminus of p105, and Ser63 and/or Ser73 of the amino-terminal 
activation domain of c-Jun. The phosphorylation of c-Jun requires the carboxy 
terminus of the protein containing the DNA binding and dimerization domains. 
Three subunits of the new complex--Sgn3, Sgn5/JAB1, and Sgn6--exhibit sequence 
similarities to regulatory components of the 26S proteasome, which could 
indicate the existence of common substrate binding sites. Immunofluorescence 
staining reveals that the new complex shows a subcellular distribution similar 
to that of the 26S proteasome. The functional relationship of the two particles 
in regulating transcriptional activity is discussed. Considering the putative 
role of the complex in signal transduction and its widespread occurrence, we 
suggest the name JAB1-containing signalosome.
