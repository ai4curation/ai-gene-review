Two new thermosensitive yeast mutants defective in retrieval of dilysine-tagged 
proteins from the Golgi back to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were 
characterized. While both ret2-1 and ret3-1 were defective for ER retrieval, 
only ret2-1 exhibited a defect in forward ER-to-Golgi transport at the 
non-permissive temperature. Coatomer (COPI) from both mutants could efficiently 
bind dilysine motifs in vitro. The corresponding RET2 and RET3 genes were cloned 
by complementation and found of encode the delta and zeta subunits of coatomer 
respectively. Both proteins show significant homology to clathrin adaptor 
subunits. These results emphasize the role of coatomer in retrieval of 
dilysine-tagged proteins back to the ER, and the similarity between clathrin and 
coatomer coats.
