Being recognized as an important constituent of the glycoprotein folding cycle, 
uridine diphosphate-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) has been a 
subject of intense study. Up to now, it is two isoforms, UGGT1 and 2 have been 
identified, which share ∼ 50% amino acid identity. UGGT1 is a well-documented 
enzyme which functions as a folding sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum, by the 
virtue of its ability to transfer a glucose residue to non-glucosylated 
high-mannose-type glycans of immature glycoproteins exhibiting non-native 
conformation. On the other hand, direct evidence to support the 
glucosyltransferase activity of UGGT2 has been lacking, leaving it unclear as to 
whether it has any function in the glycoprotein folding process. This study 
aimed to reveal the property of human UGGT2 by using synthetic substrates such 
as fluorescently labeled glycans and N-glycosylated proteins. The analysis, for 
the first time, revealed the glucosyltransferase activity of UGGT2, whose 
specificity was shown to be quite similar to UGGT1, in terms of both glycan 
specificity and preferential recognition of proteins having non-native 
conformations. Finally, Sep15 was found to form the heterodimeric complex with 
both isoforms of UGGT and markedly enhanced its glucosyltransferase activity.
