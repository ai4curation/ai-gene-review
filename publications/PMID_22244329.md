Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is an antiapoptotic transcription factor. We show that 
the antiapoptotic actions of NF-κB are mediated by hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) 
synthesized by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). TNF-α treatment triples H(2)S 
generation by stimulating binding of SP1 to the CSE promoter. H(2)S generated by 
CSE stimulates DNA binding and gene activation of NF-κB, processes that are 
abolished in CSE-deleted mice. As CSE deletion leads to decreased glutathione 
levels, resultant oxidative stress may contribute to alterations in CSE mutant 
mice. H(2)S acts by sulfhydrating the p65 subunit of NF-κB at cysteine-38, which 
promotes its binding to the coactivator ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3). 
Sulfhydration of p65 predominates early after TNF-α treatment, then declines and 
is succeeded by a reciprocal enhancement of p65 nitrosylation. In CSE mutant 
mice, antiapoptotic influences of NF-κB are markedly diminished. Thus, 
sulfhydration of NF-κB appears to be a physiologic determinant of its 
antiapoptotic transcriptional activity.
