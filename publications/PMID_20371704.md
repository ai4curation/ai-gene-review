It is still unclear how glucocorticoids (GCs) induce apoptosis of thymocytes and 
T lymphoma cells. Emergence of GC-resistant lymphoma cells is a major obstacle 
in GC therapy, emphasizing the need for novel strategies that maintain the 
sensitivity of lymphoma cells to the proapoptotic effects of GC. We have 
undertaken a kinome study to elucidate the signal transduction pathways involved 
in mediating GC-induced apoptosis. Our study shows that glycogen synthase kinase 
(GSK3) plays a central role in promoting GC-induced apoptosis. In the absence of 
a ligand, GSK3alpha, but not GSK3beta, is sequestered to the glucocorticoid 
receptor (GR). Exposure to GCs leads to dissociation of GSK3alpha from GR and 
subsequent interaction of GSK3alpha and GSK3beta with the proapoptotic Bim 
protein, an essential mediator of GC-induced apoptosis. Chemical inhibition of 
GSK3 by SB216763, BIO-Acetoxime, or LiCl and GSK3 inhibition using a 
dominant-negative mutant of GSK3 impede this cell death process, indicating that 
GSK3 is involved in transmitting the apoptotic signal. GC resistance in lymphoma 
cells can be relieved by inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-Akt 
survival pathway, which inactivates GSK3. Notch1, a transcription factor 
frequently activated in T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, confers GC 
resistance through activation of Akt. Altogether, this study illuminates the 
link connecting upstream GR signals to the downstream mediators of GC-induced 
apoptosis. Our data suggest that targeting protein kinases involved in GSK3 
inactivation should improve the outcome of GC therapy.
