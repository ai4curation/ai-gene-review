We have addressed the mechanism by which proteins are posttranslationally 
transported across the membrane of the yeast endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We 
demonstrate that BiP (Kar2p), a member of the Hsp70 family resident in the ER 
lumen, acts as a molecular ratchet during translocation of the secretory protein 
prepro-alpha factor through the channel formed by the Sec complex. Multiple BiP 
molecules associate with each translocation substrate following interaction with 
the J domain of the Sec63p component of the Sec complex. Bound BiP minimizes 
passive backward movements of the substrate through the channel, and BiP's 
subsequent dissociation results in a free polypeptide in the ER lumen. 
Antibodies against the substrate can replace BiP, indicating that a Brownian 
ratchet is sufficient to achieve translocation.
