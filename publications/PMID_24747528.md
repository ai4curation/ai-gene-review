Retromer is a multiprotein complex that trafficks cargo out of endosomes. The 
neuronal retromer traffics the amyloid-precursor protein (APP) away from 
endosomes, a site where APP is cleaved into pathogenic fragments in Alzheimer's 
disease. Here we determined whether pharmacological chaperones can enhance 
retromer stability and function. First, we relied on the crystal structures of 
retromer proteins to help identify the 'weak link' of the complex and to 
complete an in silico screen of small molecules predicted to enhance retromer 
stability. Among the hits, an in vitro assay identified one molecule that 
stabilized retromer against thermal denaturation. Second, we turned to cultured 
hippocampal neurons, showing that this small molecule increases the levels of 
retromer proteins, shifts APP away from the endosome, and decreases the 
pathogenic processing of APP. These findings show that pharmacological 
chaperones can enhance the function of a multiprotein complex and may have 
potential therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative diseases.
