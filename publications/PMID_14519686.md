We have examined the metaphase chromosomal localization of 15 proteins that have 
previously been described as involved in mammalian chromatin modification and/or 
transcriptional modulation. Immunofluorescence data indicate that all the 
proteins localize to human and mouse centromeres, a neocentromere, and the 
active centromere of a dicentric chromosome, with six of these proteins (Sin3A, 
PCAF, MYST, MBD2, ORC2, P300/CBP) being demonstrated at mammalian centromeres 
for the first time. Most of these proteins fall into two distinct chromosomal 
distribution patterns: (a) kinetochore-associated proteins (Sin3A, PCAF, MYST 
and BAF180), which colocalize with metaphase kinetochores, but not any of the 
pericentric and other major heterochromatic regions; and (b) 
heterochromatin-associated proteins (MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, ATRX, HP1alpha, HDAC1, 
HDAC2, DNMT1 and DNMT3b), which colocalize with centromeric/pericentric 
heterochromatin and all other major heterochromatic sites. A heterogeneous third 
group (c) consists of the origin recognition complex subunit ORC2 and the 
histone acetyltransferase P300/CBP, which associate generally with kinetochores 
in humans and centromeric/pericentric heterochromatin in mouse, with some minor 
differences in localization. These observations indicate an extensive sharing of 
protein components involved in chromatin modification at gene loci, centromeres 
and various chromosomal heterochromatic landmarks. The definition of distinct 
patterns of chromosomal distribution for these proteins provides a useful basis 
for the further investigation of the broad-ranging roles of these proteins.
