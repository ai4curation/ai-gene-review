Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease (APE; EC 4.2.99.18) plays a central role 
in repair of DNA damage due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) because its DNA 
3'-phosphoesterase activity removes 3' blocking groups in DNA that are generated 
by DNA glycosylase/AP-lyases during removal of oxidized bases and by direct ROS 
reaction with DNA. The major human APE (APE-1) gene is activated selectively by 
sublethal levels of a variety of ROS and ROS generators, including ionizing 
radiation, but not by other genotoxicants-e.g., UV light and alkylating agents. 
Increased expression of APE mRNA and protein was observed both in the HeLa S3 
tumor line and in WI 38 primary fibroblasts, and it was accompanied by 
translocation of the endonuclease to the nucleus. ROS-treated cells showed a 
significant increase in resistance to the cytotoxicity of such ROS generators as 
H2O2 and bleomycin, but not to UV light. This "adaptive response" appears to 
result from enhanced repair of cytotoxic DNA lesions due to an increased 
activity of APE-1, which may be limiting in the base excision repair process for 
ROS-induced toxic lesions.
