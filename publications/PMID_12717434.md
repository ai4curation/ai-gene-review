Mutations in LMAN1 (also called ERGIC-53) result in combined deficiency of 
factor V and factor VIII (F5F8D), an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder 
characterized by coordinate reduction of both clotting proteins. LMAN1 is a 
mannose-binding type 1 transmembrane protein localized to the endoplasmic 
reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC; refs. 2,3), suggesting that 
F5F8D could result from a defect in secretion of factor V and factor VIII (ref. 
4). Correctly folded proteins destined for secretion are packaged in the ER into 
COPII-coated vesicles, which subsequently fuse to form the ERGIC. Secretion of 
certain abundant proteins suggests a default pathway requiring no export signals 
(bulk flow; refs. 6,7). An alternative mechanism involves selective packaging of 
secreted proteins with the help of specific cargo receptors. The latter model 
would be consistent with mutations in LMAN1 causing a selective block to export 
of factor V and factor VIII. But approximately 30% of individuals with F5F8D 
have normal levels of LMAN1, suggesting that mutations in another gene may also 
be associated with F5F8D. Here we show that inactivating mutations in MCFD2 
cause F5F8D with a phenotype indistinguishable from that caused by mutations in 
LMAN1. MCFD2 is localized to the ERGIC through a direct, calcium-dependent 
interaction with LMAN1. These findings suggest that the MCFD2-LMAN1 complex 
forms a specific cargo receptor for the ER-to-Golgi transport of selected 
proteins.
