We present here a first characterization of LUMA, an unique integral inner 
nuclear membrane (INM) protein. LUMA is a highly conserved protein even in some 
bacteria and shares a PFAM domain of unknown function with orthologs from many 
species. Assessing LUMA topology by using protease protection of 
membrane-inserted LUMA and antibody epitope accessibility assays reveals that 
LUMA contains four transmembrane domains and a large hydrophilic domain located 
between membrane spans 1 and 2. The large hydrophilic domain is exposed to the 
perinuclear space whereas both LUMA termini reside cyto- or nucleoplasmically. 
Nuclear envelope targeting of LUMA mainly depends on the membrane spans. LUMA's 
transmembrane domains also promote homooligomerization. LUMA binds A- and B-type 
lamins and depends on A-type lamins for its INM localization. Furthermore, it 
interacts with emerin. Both downregulation of LUMA and overexpression of 
dominant-negative acting LUMA fragments causes redistribution of emerin. We 
propose that LUMA functions as a tetraspanin-like membrane organizer and has the 
potential to contribute to the pathomechanism of dystrophic diseases, such as 
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.
