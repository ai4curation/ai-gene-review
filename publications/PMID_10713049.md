Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms are phosphorylated on tyrosine in the response 
of cells to oxidative stress. The present studies demonstrate that treatment of 
cells with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) induces binding of the PKCdelta isoform 
and the c-Abl protein-tyrosine kinase. The results show that c-Abl 
phosphorylates PKCdelta in the H(2)O(2) response. We also show that PKCdelta 
phosphorylates and activates c-Abl in vitro. In cells, induction of c-Abl 
activity by H(2)O(2) is attenuated by the PKCdelta inhibitor, rottlerin, and by 
overexpression of the regulatory domain of PKCdelta. These findings support a 
functional interaction between PKCdelta and c-Abl in the cellular response to 
oxidative stress.
