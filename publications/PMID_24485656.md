One envisioned function of homologous recombination (HR) is to find a template 
for DNA synthesis from the resected 3'-OH molecules that occur during 
double-strand break (DSB) repair at collapsed replication forks. However, the 
interplay between DNA synthesis and HR remains poorly understood in higher 
eukaryotic cells. Here, we reveal functions for the breast cancer proteins BRCA2 
and PALB2 at blocked replication forks and show a role for these proteins in 
stimulating polymerase η (Polη) to initiate DNA synthesis. PALB2, BRCA2, and 
Polη colocalize at stalled or collapsed replication forks after hydroxyurea 
treatment. Moreover, PALB2 and BRCA2 interact with Polη and are required to 
sustain the recruitment of Polη at blocked replication forks. PALB2 and BRCA2 
stimulate Polη-dependent DNA synthesis on D loop substrates. We conclude that 
PALB2 and BRCA2, in addition to their functions in D loop formation, play 
crucial roles in the initiation of recombination-associated DNA synthesis by 
Polη-mediated DNA repair.

One envisioned function of homologous recombination (HR) is to find a template for DNA synthesis from the resected 3′-OH molecules that occur during double-strand break (DSB) repair at broken or stalled replication forks. However, the interplay between DNA synthesis and HR remains poorly understood in higher eukaryotic cells. Here, we reveal new functions for breast cancer proteins BRCA2 and PALB2 at blocked replication forks and show a role for these proteins in stimulating polymerase eta (Polη) to initiate DNA synthesis. PALB2, BRCA2 and Polη co-localize at stalled or collapsed replication forks after hydroxyurea treatment. Moreover, PALB2 and BRCA2 interact with Polη, and are required to sustain the recruitment of Polη at blocked replication forks. PALB2 and BRCA2 stimulate Polη-dependent DNA synthesis on D-loop substrates. We conclude that PALB2 and BRCA2, in addition to their functions in D-loop formation, play crucial roles in the initiation of recombination-associated DNA synthesis by Polη-mediated DNA repair.
