The TORC1 and PKA protein kinases are central elements of signaling networks 
that regulate eukaryotic cell proliferation in response to growth factors and/or 
nutrients. In yeast, attenuation of signaling by these kinases following 
nitrogen and/or carbon limitation activates the protein kinase Rim15, which 
orchestrates the initiation of a reversible cellular quiescence program to 
ensure normal chronological life span. The molecular elements linking Rim15 to 
distal readouts including the expression of Msn2/4- and Gis1-dependent genes 
involve the endosulfines Igo1/2. Here, we show that Rim15, analogous to the 
greatwall kinase in Xenopus, phosphorylates endosulfines to directly inhibit the 
Cdc55-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A(Cdc55)). Inhibition of PP2A(Cdc55) preserves 
Gis1 in a phosphorylated state and consequently promotes its recruitment to and 
activation of transcription from promoters of specific nutrient-regulated genes. 
These results close a gap in our perception of and delineate a role for 
PP2A(Cdc55) in TORC1-/PKA-mediated regulation of quiescence and chronological 
life span.
