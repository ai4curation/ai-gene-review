The CCR4-NOT complex (1 mDa in size), consisting of the proteins CCR4, CAF1, and 
NOT1 to NOT5, regulates gene expression both positively and negatively and is 
distinct from other large transcriptional complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
such as SNF/SWI, TFIID, SAGA, and RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. The physical and 
genetic interactions between the components of the CCR4-NOT complex were 
investigated in order to gain insight into how this complex affects the 
expression of diverse genes and processes. The CAF1 protein was found to be 
absolutely required for CCR4 association with the NOT proteins, and CCR4 and 
CAF1, in turn, physically interacted with NOT1 through its central amino acid 
region from positions 667 to 1152. The NOT3, NOT4, and NOT5 proteins had no 
significant effect on the association of CCR4, CAF1, and NOT1 with each other. 
In contrast, the NOT2, NOT4, and NOT5 interacted with the C-terminal region 
(residues 1490 to 2108) of NOT1 in which NOT2 and NOT5 physically associated in 
the absence of CAF1, NOT3, and NOT4. These and other data indicate that the 
physical ordering of these proteins in the complex is CCR4-CAF1-NOT1-(NOT2, 
NOT5), with NOT4 and NOT3 more peripheral to NOT2 and NOT5. The physical 
separation of CCR4 and CAF1 from other components of the CCR4-NOT complex 
correlated with genetic analysis indicating partially separate functions for 
these two groups of proteins. ccr4 or caf1 deletion suppressed the increased 
3-aminotriazole resistance phenotype conferred by not mutations, resulted in 
opposite effects on gene expression as compared to several not mutations, and 
resulted in a number of synthetic phenotypes in combination with not mutations. 
These results define the CCR4-NOT complex as consisting of at least two 
physically and functionally separated groups of proteins.
