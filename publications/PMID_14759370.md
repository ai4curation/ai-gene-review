Lysine acetylation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in response to a wide 
variety of cellular stress signals is required for its activation as a 
transcription factor that regulates cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis. 
Here, we report that the conserved bromo-domain of the transcriptional 
coactivator CBP (CREB binding protein) binds specifically to p53 at the 
C-terminal acetylated lysine 382. This bromodomain/acetyl-lysine binding is 
responsible for p53 acetylation-dependent coactivator recruitment after DNA 
damage, a step essential for p53-induced transcriptional activation of the 
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in G1 cell cycle arrest. We further 
present the three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the CBP 
bromodomain in complex with a lysine 382-acetylated p53 peptide. Using 
structural and biochemical analyses, we define the molecular determinants for 
the specificity of this molecular recognition.
