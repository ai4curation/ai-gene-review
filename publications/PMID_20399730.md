Cortical development depends upon tightly controlled cell fate and cell survival 
decisions that generate a functional neuronal population, but the coordination 
of these two processes is poorly understood. Here we show that conditional 
removal of a key apical complex protein, Pals1, causes premature withdrawal from 
the cell cycle, inducing excessive generation of early-born postmitotic neurons 
followed by surprisingly massive and rapid cell death, leading to the abrogation 
of virtually the entire cortical structure. Pals1 loss shows exquisite dosage 
sensitivity, so that heterozygote mutants show an intermediate phenotype on cell 
fate and cell death. Loss of Pals1 blocks essential cell survival signals, 
including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, while mTORC1 
activation partially rescues Pals1 deficiency. These data highlight unexpected 
roles of the apical complex protein Pals1 in cell survival through interactions 
with mTOR signaling.

Abstract

Cortical development depends upon tightly controlled cell fate and cell survival decisions that generate a functional neuronal population, but the coordination of these two processes is poorly understood. Here we show that conditional removal of a key apical complex protein, Pals1, causes premature withdrawal from the cell cycle, inducing excessive generation of early-born postmitotic neurons followed by surprisingly massive and rapid cell death, leading to the abrogation of virtually the entire cortical structure. Pals1 loss shows exquisite dosage sensitivity, so that heterozygote mutants show an intermediate phenotype on cell fate and cell death. Loss of Pals1 blocks essential cell survival signals, including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, while mTORC1 activation partially rescues Pals1 deficiency. These data highlight unexpected roles of the apical complex protein Pals1 in cell survival through interactions with mTOR signaling.

INTRODUCTION

The cerebral cortex is formed by the orderly generation of postmitotic neurons through symmetric and asymmetric cell division of neural progenitors during neurogenesis ( Farkas and Huttner, 2008 ; Gotz and Huttner, 2005 ; Huttner and Kosodo, 2005 ; Miyata et al., 2001 ). The proliferation of cortical progenitor cells, followed by their irreversible depletion near the time of birth, is tightly orchestrated by cellular and molecular events that balance the generation of early-born neurons with the maintenance of progenitors for later born neurons ( Caviness et al., 1995 ; Gotz and Huttner, 2005 ; Takahashi et al., 1996 ). Two neural progenitor cell types are identified in the developing cortex. One is a radial neuroepithelial cell, with a cell body in the ventricular zone and an apical process that inserts into the ventricular lining, and a long, thin basal processes that reaches the pial surface at the outside of the brain ( Anthony et al., 2004 ; Fishell and Kriegstein, 2003 ; Noctor et al., 2001 ; Noctor et al., 2002 ; Tamamaki et al., 2001 ). These radial cells serve both as progenitors and migratory guides for newly born neurons. The other progenitor cell type is a more recently characterized basal progenitor, which localizes primarily to the subventricular zone (SVZ) and undergoes one or more cell divisions, typically symmetrically, to generate neurons in the cerebral cortex ( Haubensak et al., 2004 ; Kowalczyk et al., 2009 ; Miyata et al., 2004 ; Noctor et al., 2004 ; Noctor et al., 2008 ). Radial neuroepithelial progenitors form an epithelial structure with their apical, ventricular processes connected to adjoining cells by adherens junctions. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the cellular events of radial glial progenitor cell division, the molecular control of cell fate decisions remains poorly understood.

Recent work suggests that similar functions of apical complex proteins in cell fate determination may unite flies and mammals ( Doe, 2008 ; Wodarz, 2005 ). The apical polarity complex of flies, which includes the proteins Bazooka (Par3), Par6, and aPKC, restricts cell fate determinants to one side of neural stem cells, termed neuroblasts, such that these determinants are inherited preferentially by one daughter cell that retains the neuroblast cell fate. On the other hand, the basal complex proteins, Lgl/Dlg/Scb and Numb, are segregated to the other daughter cell, termed the ganglion mother cell ( Roegiers and Jan, 2004 ; Wodarz, 2005 ), which is an intermediate progenitor that generates two neurons or two glial cells. Genetic studies of the vertebrate Numb orthologues have uncovered a number of roles in neurogenesis ( Li et al., 2003 ; Petersen et al., 2002 ; Petersen et al., 2004 ; Rasin et al., 2007 ). However, in contrast to its role in invertebrates, deletion of aPKCÎ» in mice at E15 (midway through neurogenesis) did not clearly affect cell fate decisions in a fashion comparable to its role in invertebrates ( Imai et al., 2006 ). On the other hand, mouse Lgl1 mutants showed hyperproliferation of progenitors in the brain, in conjunction with Numb mislocalization ( Klezovitch et al., 2004 ). Recent work suggests that Par3 is segregated asymmetrically in cortical neuroblasts, and also serves as a cell autonomous regulator of Notch signaling ( Bultje et al., 2009 ). In addition, knockdown and overexpression studies of Par3 and Par6 ( Costa et al., 2008 ) and conditional knockout of their upstream regulator Cdc42 ( Cappello et al., 2006 ) suggest that the apical complex proteins are essential for self-renewal of neural progenitors in the developing mammalian cortex. While it seems likely that evolutionarily conserved polarity complex proteins have roles in proliferation control, whether they also play a role in maintaining neural progenitor cell fate has not been shown genetically.

Here, we study a functionally related apical complex protein Pals1 ( P rotein a ssociated with L in 7 ), and extend the role of the apical complex to control cell survival as well. Pals belongs to the MAGUK ( M embrane A ssociated G uanylate K inase) family of proteins, which are scaffolding factors containing both postsynaptic density 95/discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ) and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains ( Kamberov et al., 2000 ). Pals1 also contains two L27 domains that bind PatJ and Lin7, both critical components of tight junction formation and maintenance. The PDZ domain of Pals1 links it to Crb1, 2, and 3, Crumbs vertebrate homologues, which encode transmembrane proteins with EGF-like repeats, thus forming a tripartite PatJ-Pals1-Crbs complex ( Roh et al., 2002a ). In addition, an evolutionarily conserved domain, whose structure is not yet understood, mediates binding of Pals1 to the Par6-Par3-aPKC apical complex. Thus, Pals1 links these two evolutionary conserved apical complex signaling pathways ( Hurd et al., 2003 ). The critical function of Pals1 ( nagie oko in zebrafish) is well established in epithelial polarity and adherens junction assembly in mammalian cells, in zebrafish embryos and in invertebrates ( Bachmann et al., 2001 ; Hong et al., 2001 ; Straight et al., 2004 ; Wei and Malicki, 2002 ), but a role for Pals1 has not been studied in cell fate decisions.

In this study, we show that Pals1 loss causes defects not only in cell fate decisions, but also surprisingly in cell survival, and use genetics to elucidate key downstream effectors of these roles. We find that absence of Pals1 leads to the depletion of progenitor cells by premature withdrawal from the cell cycle, generating excessive early-born postmitotic neurons. Unexpectedly however, Pals1-deficient cells undergo massive and rapid cell death, which leads to the total abrogation of almost the entire cortical structure. Since accumulating evidence has implicated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway components and polarity proteins ( Massey-Harroche et al., 2007 ; Pinal et al., 2006 ; von Stein et al., 2005 ), we investigated the genetic relationship between Pals1 and mTOR signaling. Activation of the mTOR signaling pathway by elimination of a negative regulator, Tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 2 (Tsc2), partially restores the medial cortex in Pals1 mutants, suggesting genetic interaction between the two signaling pathways. Taken together, our findings identify a new connection between the apical complex and mTOR signaling that couples cell fate and cell survival during cortical development.

DISCUSSION

Our genetic study demonstrates a near-complete abrogation of cortical development in the absence of the apical complex protein Pals1. Surprisingly, despite the absence of most cortical structures, Pals1 CKO mice survive and display relatively normal health, thus providing a unique animal model that distinguishes essential functions of the cerebral cortex. Our data also suggest that the role of Pals1 in cell fate determination, in which mutation of Pals1 results in a cell fate shift to generate neurons instead of progenitor cells, likely relates to the proper localization and maintenance of apical complex proteins in the apical membrane, and the establishment of normal apical membrane structures, such as primary cilia. Finally, we have uncovered an unexpected role of Pals1 in cell survival, which is closely coupled to the cell fate defects. Virtually all of the abnormally generated neurons die, and their death is associated with defects in mTOR signaling. This unexpected connection between cell fate and survival signaling by the apical complex protein Pals1 sheds light on how Pals1 integrates signaling events during neurogenesis to regulate neuronal number.
