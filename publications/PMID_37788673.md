The human ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase functions 
in the nucleus to protect genomic integrity. Micronuclei (MN) arise from genomic 
and chromosomal instability and cause aneuploidy and chromothripsis, but how MN 
are removed is poorly understood. Here, we show that ATR is active in MN and 
promotes their rupture in S phase by phosphorylating Lamin A/C at Ser395, which 
primes Ser392 for CDK1 phosphorylation and destabilizes the MN envelope. In 
cells harboring MN, ATR or CDK1 inhibition reduces MN rupture. Consequently, ATR 
inhibitor (ATRi) diminishes activation of the cytoplasmic DNA sensor cGAS and 
compromises cGAS-dependent autophagosome accumulation in MN and clearance of 
micronuclear DNA. Furthermore, ATRi reduces cGAS-mediated senescence and killing 
of MN-bearing cancer cells by natural killer cells. Thus, in addition to the 
canonical ATR signaling pathway, an ATR-CDK1-Lamin A/C axis promotes MN rupture 
to clear damaged DNA and cells, protecting the genome in cell populations 
through unexpected cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous mechanisms.
