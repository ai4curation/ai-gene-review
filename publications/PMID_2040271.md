Genomic clones containing the human pyruvate kinase M (PKM) gene, which encodes 
the M1-type and M2-type isozymes, were isolated and their exon sequences were 
determined. The gene is approximately 32 kb and consists of 12 exons and 11 
introns. Exons 9 and 10 contain sequences specific to the M1 and M2 types, 
respectively, indicating that the human isozymes are produced from the same gene 
by alternative splicing as in the case of the rat gene. The exon-intron 
structure of the human PKM gene is identical to that of the rat gene, and the 
introns of both genes interrupt the exons at the same points. Introns 6 and 7 
begin with GC dinucleotide instead of the consensus GT, but the other 
exon-intron boundaries are consistent with the GT-AG rule. The gene is 
transcribed from multiple start sites. The 5'-flanking region of the gene 
contains putative Sp1-binding sites, but no TATA box or CAAT box, and shows high 
sequence similarity to that of the rat M gene. Bacterial chloramphenicol 
acetyltransferase assay revealed that the upstream region between positions -493 
and -51 contained a cis-acting element(s) that was essential for expression of 
the M gene in HeLa cells. Long stretches of conserved regions were found in the 
introns around the M1-specific and M2-specific exons, suggesting that these 
regions may be involved in the alternative splicing machinery.
