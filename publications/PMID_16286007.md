Yeast Rpd3 histone deacetylase plays an important role at actively transcribed 
genes. We characterized two distinct Rpd3 complexes, Rpd3L and Rpd3S, by MudPIT 
analysis. Both complexes shared a three subunit core and Rpd3L contains unique 
subunits consistent with being a promoter targeted corepressor. Rco1 and Eaf3 
were subunits specific to Rpd3S. Mutants of RCO1 and EAF3 exhibited increased 
acetylation in the FLO8 and STE11 open reading frames (ORFs) and the appearance 
of aberrant transcripts initiating within the body of these ORFs. Mutants in the 
RNA polymerase II-associated SET2 histone methyltransferase also displayed these 
defects. Set2 functioned upstream of Rpd3S and the Eaf3 methyl-histone binding 
chromodomain was important for recruitment of Rpd3S and for deacetylation within 
the STE11 ORF. These data indicate that Pol II-associated Set2 methylates H3 
providing a transcriptional memory which signals for deacetylation of ORFs by 
Rpd3S. This erases transcription elongation-associated acetylation to suppress 
intragenic transcription initiation.
