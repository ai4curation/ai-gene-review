Spinal muscular atrophy is a common, often lethal, neurodegenerative disease 
that results from low levels of, or loss-of-function mutations in, the SMN 
(survival of motor neurons) protein. SMN oligomerizes and forms a stable complex 
with five additional proteins: Gemins 2-6. SMN also interacts with several 
additional proteins referred to as "substrates". Most of these substrates 
contain a domain enriched in arginine and glycine residues (the RG-rich domain), 
and are constituents of different ribonucleoprotein complexes. Recent studies 
revealed that the substrates can be modified by an arginine methyltransferase 
complex, the methylosome. This forms symmetrical dimethylarginines within the 
RG-rich domains of the substrates, thereby converting them to high-affinity 
binders of the SMN complex, and most likely providing regulation of the 
ribonucleoprotein assembly processes.
