After de novo biosynthesis phospholipids undergo extensive remodeling by the 
Lands' cycle. Enzymes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis have been studied 
extensively but not those involved in reacylation of lysophosphopholipids. One 
key enzyme in the Lands' cycle is fatty acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine 
acyltransferase (LPCAT), which utilizes lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) and 
fatty acyl-CoA to produce various phosphatidylcholine (PC) species. Four 
isoforms of LPCAT have been identified. In this study we found that LPCAT3 is 
the major hepatic isoform, and its knockdown significantly reduces hepatic LPCAT 
activity. Moreover, we report that hepatic LPCAT3 knockdown increases certain 
species of LysoPCs and decreases certain species of PC. A surprising observation 
was that LPCAT3 knockdown significantly reduces hepatic triglycerides. Despite 
this, these mice had higher plasma triglyceride and apoB levels. Lipoprotein 
production studies indicated that reductions in LPCAT3 enhanced assembly and 
secretion of triglyceride-rich apoB-containing lipoproteins. Furthermore, these 
mice had higher microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) mRNA and protein 
levels. Mechanistic studies in hepatoma cells revealed that LysoPC enhances 
secretion of apoB but not apoA-I in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, 
LysoPC increased MTP mRNA, protein, and activity. In short, these results 
indicate that hepatic LPCAT3 modulates VLDL production by regulating LysoPC 
levels and MTP expression.
