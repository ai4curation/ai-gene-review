Growth factor deprivation is a physiological mechanism to induce apoptosis. We 
used an IL-2-dependent murine T cell line to identify proteins that trigger 
apoptosis. Here we report the identification, the cloning and characterization 
of ITM2B(s), a protein induced upon IL-2-deprivation. ITM2B(s), which shares the 
BH3 domain of Bcl-2 family members, is a cytoplasmic and mitochondrial protein. 
Expression of ITM2B(s) induces apoptosis in IL-2-stimulated cells, but not in 
IL-4-stimulated cells, while overexpression of the long form of the protein is 
not able to induce apoptosis. In IL-2-stimulated cells, ITM2B(s) interacts with 
the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, and does not interact with the proapoptotic 
Bad. Mutation of the critical L and D residues within the BH3 domain abolished 
the ability of ITM2B(s) to promote apoptosis.
