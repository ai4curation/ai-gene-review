Mitochondrial dynamics play an important role in cellular homeostasis and a 
variety of human diseases are linked to its dysregulated function. Here, we 
describe a 15-year-old boy with a novel disease caused by altered mitochondrial 
dynamics. The patient was the second child of consanguineous Jewish parents. He 
developed progressive muscle weakness and exercise intolerance at 6 years of 
age. His muscle biopsy revealed mitochondrial myopathy with numerous ragged red 
and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) negative fibers and combined respiratory chain 
complex I and IV deficiency. MtDNA copy number was elevated and no deletions of 
the mtDNA were detected in muscle DNA. Whole exome sequencing identified a 
homozygous nonsense mutation (p.Q92*) in the MIEF2 gene encoding the 
mitochondrial dynamics protein of 49 kDa (MID49). Immunoblotting revealed 
increased levels of proteins promoting mitochondrial fusion (MFN2, OPA1) and 
decreased levels of the fission protein DRP1. Fibroblasts of the patient showed 
elongated mitochondria, and significantly higher frequency of fusion events, 
mtDNA abundance and aberrant mitochondrial cristae ultrastructure, compared with 
controls. Thus, our data suggest that mutations in MIEF2 result in imbalanced 
mitochondrial dynamics and a combined respiratory chain enzyme defect in 
skeletal muscle, leading to mitochondrial myopathy.
