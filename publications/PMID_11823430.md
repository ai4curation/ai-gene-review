Many nuclear transport pathways are mediated by importin beta-related transport 
receptors. Here, we identify human importin (Imp) 4b as well as mouse Imp4a, 
Imp9a and Imp9b as novel family members. Imp4a mediates import of the ribosomal 
protein (rp) S3a, while Imp9a and Imp9b import rpS7, rpL18a and apparently 
numerous other substrates. Ribosomal proteins, histones and many other nuclear 
import substrates are very basic proteins that aggregate easily with cytoplasmic 
polyanions such as RNA. Imp9 effectively prevents such precipitation of, for 
example, rpS7 and rpL18a by covering their basic domains. The same applies to 
Imp4, Imp5, Imp7 and Impbeta and their respective basic import substrates. The 
Impbeta-Imp7 heterodimer appears specialized for the most basic proteins, such 
as rpL4, rpL6 and histone H1, and is necessary and sufficient to keep them 
soluble in a cytoplasmic environment prior to rRNA or DNA binding, respectively. 
Thus, just as heat shock proteins function as chaperones for exposed hydrophobic 
patches, importins act as chaperones for exposed basic domains, and we suggest 
that this represents a major and general cellular function of importins.
