The highly divergent ribosomes of human mitochondria (mitoribosomes) synthesize 
13 essential proteins of oxidative phosphorylation complexes. We have determined 
the structure of the intact mitoribosome to 3.5 angstrom resolution by means of 
single-particle electron cryogenic microscopy. It reveals 80 extensively 
interconnected proteins, 36 of which are specific to mitochondria, and three 
ribosomal RNA molecules. The head domain of the small subunit, particularly the 
messenger (mRNA) channel, is highly remodeled. Many intersubunit bridges are 
specific to the mitoribosome, which adopts conformations involving ratcheting or 
rolling of the small subunit that are distinct from those seen in bacteria or 
eukaryotes. An intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase mediates a contact between the 
head and central protuberance. The structure provides a reference for analysis 
of mutations that cause severe pathologies and for future drug design.
