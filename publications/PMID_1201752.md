Studies on the specificity of action of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme.

Mirelman D, Kleppe G, Jensen HB.

Lysozyme from bacteriophage T4 was found to digest a soluble, uncrosslinked 
peptidoglycan which is secreted by cells of Micrococcus luteus when incubated in 
the presence of penicillin G. Analysis of the enzymatic degradation products 
shows that T4 acts as an endo-acetylmuramidase capable of cleaving glycosidic 
bonds only at muramic acid residues that are substituted with peptide 
side-chains. The results indicate that the secreted peptidoglycan may consist of 
a mixture of chains, approximately half of which are substituted by peptide side 
chains on most of their muramic acid residues, while the other half is made up 
of chains in which the muramic acid moieties are unsubstituted.
