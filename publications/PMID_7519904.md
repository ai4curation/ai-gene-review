Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that may play 
important roles in the morphogenesis and repair of skeletal muscle. To begin to 
explore the role of thrombospondin-1 in this tissue, we have examined the 
interactions of three rodent skeletal muscle cell lines, C2C12, G8, and H9c2, 
with platelet TSP-1. The cells secrete thrombospondin and incorporate it into 
the cell layer in a distribution distinct from that of fibronectin. Myoblasts 
attach and spread on fibronectin- or thrombospondin-coated substrates with 
similar time and concentration dependencies. Whereas cells adherent on 
fibronectin organize actin stress fibers, cells adherent on TSP-1 display 
prominent membrane ruffles and lamellae that contain radial actin microspikes. 
Attachment to thrombospondin-1 or the 140-kDa tryptic fragment is mediated by 
interactions with the type 1 repeats and the carboxy-terminal globular domain. 
Attachment is not inhibited by heparin, GRGDSP peptide, or VTCG peptide but is 
inhibited by chondroitin sulphate A. Integrins of the beta 1 or alpha V 
subgroups do not appear to be involved in myoblast attachment to TSP-1; instead, 
this process depends in part on cell surface chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans. 
Whereas the central 70-kDa chymotryptic fragment of TSP-1 does not support 
myoblast attachment, the carboxy-terminal domain of TSP-1 expressed as a fusion 
protein in the bacterial expression vector, pGEX, supported myoblast attachment 
to 30% the level of intact TSP-1. Thrombospondin-4 (TSP-4) is also present in 
skeletal muscle and a fusion protein containing the carboxy-terminal domain of 
TSP-4 also supported myoblast adhesion, although this protein was less active on 
a molar basis than the TSP-1 fusion protein. Thus, the carboxyterminal domain of 
TSP-1 appears to contain a primary attachment site for myoblasts, and this 
activity is present in a second member of the thrombospondin family.

Abstract

Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that may play important roles in the morphogenesis and repair of skeletal muscle. To begin to explore the role of thrombospondin-1 in this tissue, we have examined the interactions of three rodent skeletal muscle cell lines, C2C12, G8, and H9c2, with platelet TSP-1. The cells secrete thrombospondin and incorporate it into the cell layer in a distribution distinct from that of fibronectin. Myoblasts attach and spread on fibronectin- or thrombospondin-coated substrates with similar time and concentration dependencies. Whereas cells adherent on fibronectin organize actin stress fibers, cells adherent on TSP-1 display prominent membrane ruffles and lamellae that contain radial actin microspikes. Attachment to thrombospondin-1 or the 140-kDa tryptic fragment is mediated by interactions with the type 1 repeats and the carboxy-terminal globular domain. Attachment is not inhibited by heparin, GRGDSP peptide, or VTCG peptide but is inhibited by chondroitin sulphate A. Integrins of the beta 1 or alpha V subgroups do not appear to be involved in myoblast attachment to TSP-1; instead, this process depends in part on cell surface chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans. Whereas the central 70-kDa chymotryptic fragment of TSP-1 does not support myoblast attachment, the carboxy-terminal domain of TSP-1 expressed as a fusion protein in the bacterial expression vector, pGEX, supported myoblast attachment to 30% the level of intact TSP-1. Thrombospondin-4 (TSP-4) is also present in skeletal muscle and a fusion protein containing the carboxy-terminal domain of TSP-4 also supported myoblast adhesion, although this protein was less active on a molar basis than the TSP-1 fusion protein. Thus, the carboxyterminal domain of TSP-1 appears to contain a primary attachment site for myoblasts, and this activity is present in a second member of the thrombospondin family.
