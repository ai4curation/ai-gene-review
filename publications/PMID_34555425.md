Androgens promote vascular endothelial cell proliferation through activation of 
a ZIP9-dependent inhibitory G protein/PI3K-Akt/Erk/cyclin D1 pathway.

While androgens have been reported to mediate cardiovascular endothelial cell 
proliferation, the potential involvement of membrane androgen receptors (mAR) 
has not been examined. Here we show ZIP9, a recently characterized mAR, mediates 
androgen-induced early proliferative events in human umbilical vein endothelial 
cells (HUVECs). Androgen treatment significantly increased cyclin D1 nuclear 
localization and proliferation, which were blocked by transfection with siRNA 
targeting ZIP9 but not the nuclear AR. Testosterone rapidly activated inhibitory 
G protein signaling, Erk, and Akt, and inhibition of these signaling members 
abrogated the ZIP9-mediated cyclin D1 and proliferative responses. Erk and Akt 
modulated cyclin D1 nuclear localization by upregulation of cyclin D1 mRNA and 
inhibition of GSK-3β activity, respectively. This is the first study to 
demonstrate a role for ZIP9 in HUVEC proliferation and indicates ZIP9 is a 
physiologically-relevant androgen receptor in the cardiovascular system that 
merits further study as a potential therapeutic target for treating 
cardiovascular disease.
