Abnormal regulation of centrosome components can induce chromosome instability 
and tumorigenesis. Centrosomal protein 63 (CEP63) is a vital member for 
assembling centrosome. Yet, the involvement of CEP63 in cancer pathogenesis 
remains unclear. Here we identify CEP63 as an important mediator for RNA-binding 
proteins (RBPs) to facilitate regulation on their RNA targets in colorectal 
cancer (CRC). We demonstrate that CEP63 protein is upregulated in a large cohort 
of colorectal cancer tissues and predicts poor prognosis, and USP36 is 
identified for stabilizing CEP63 by enhancing its K48-dependent 
deubiquitination. CEP63 overexpression promotes the proliferation and tumor 
growth of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we find that CEP63 can 
promote cancer stem-like cell properties by enhancing YAP1 expression through 
binding with and inhibiting the K63-ubiquitylation degradation of RBP FXR1 in 
CRC cells. Importantly, we further verify that the KH domain of FXR1 is 
necessary for the interaction between CEP63 and FXR1. Moreover, microtube motor 
proteins can form a complex with CEP63 and FXR1 to mediate the regulation of 
FXR1 on RNA targets. Additionally, we also confirm that CEP63 can bind and 
regulate multiple RBPs. In conclusion, our findings unveil an unrecognized 
CEP63/RBPs/RNA axis that CEP63 may perform as an adapter facilitating the 
formation of RBPs complex to regulate RNA progression and discover the role of 
CEP63 involved in signal transduction and RNA regulation, providing potential 
therapeutic target for CRC patients.
