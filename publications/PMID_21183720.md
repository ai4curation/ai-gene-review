The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is a protein folding machine that is conserved 
from bacteria to man. Human, cytosolic Hsp90 is dedicated to folding of chiefly 
signal transduction components. The chaperoning mechanism of Hsp90 is controlled 
by ATP and various cochaperones, but is poorly understood and controversial. 
Here, we characterized the Apo and ATP states of the 170-kDa human Hsp90 
full-length protein by NMR spectroscopy in solution, and we elucidated the 
mechanism of the inhibition of its ATPase by its cochaperone p23. We assigned 
isoleucine side chains of Hsp90 via specific isotope labeling of their δ-methyl 
groups, which allowed the NMR analysis of the full-length protein. We found that 
ATP caused exclusively local changes in Hsp90's N-terminal nucleotide-binding 
domain. Native mass spectrometry showed that Hsp90 and p23 form a 22 complex via 
a positively cooperative mechanism. Despite this stoichiometry, NMR data 
indicated that the complex was not fully symmetric. The p23-dependent NMR shifts 
mapped to both the lid and the adenine end of Hsp90's ATP binding pocket, but 
also to large parts of the middle domain. Shifts distant from the p23 binding 
site reflect p23-induced conformational changes in Hsp90. Together, we conclude 
that it is Hsp90's nucleotide-binding domain that triggers the formation of the 
Hsp90(2)p23(2) complex. We anticipate that our NMR approach has significant 
impact on future studies of full-length Hsp90 with cofactors and substrates, but 
also for the development of Hsp90 inhibiting anticancer drugs.
