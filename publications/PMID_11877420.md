beta-Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a widely expressed transmembrane protein 
of unknown function that is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. 
The cytoplasmic tail of APP interacts with phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain 
containing proteins (Fe65, X11, mDab-1, and JIP-1) and may modulate gene 
expression and apoptosis. We now identify Shc A and Shc C, PTB-containing 
adapter proteins that signal to cellular differentiation and survival pathways, 
as novel APP-interacting proteins. The APP cytoplasmic tail contains a 
PTB-binding motif (Y(682)ENPTY(687)) that, when phosphorylated on Tyr(682), 
precipitated the PTB domain of Shc A and Shc C, as well as endogenous 
full-length Shc A. APP and Shc C were physically associated in adult mouse brain 
homogenates. Increase in phosphorylation of APP by overexpression of the nerve 
growth factor receptor Trk A in 293T cells promoted the interaction of 
transfected APP and endogenous Shc A. Pervanadate treatment of N2a neuroblastoma 
cells resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation and association of endogenous APP and 
Shc A. Thus, APP and Shc proteins interact in vitro, in cells, and in the mouse 
brain. Tyrosine phosphorylation of APP may promote the interaction with Shc 
proteins.
