Inherently unstable mammalian mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs) within their 
3' untranslated regions. Although found 15 years ago, the mechanism by which 
AREs dictate rapid mRNA decay is not clear. In yeast, 3'-to-5' mRNA degradation 
is mediated by the exosome, a multisubunit particle. We have purified and 
characterized the human exosome by mass spectrometry and found its composition 
to be similar to its yeast counterpart. Using a cell-free RNA decay system, we 
demonstrate that the mammalian exosome is required for rapid degradation of 
ARE-containing RNAs but not for poly(A) shortening. The mammalian exosome does 
not recognize ARE-containing RNAs on its own. ARE recognition requires certain 
ARE binding proteins that can interact with the exosome and recruit it to 
unstable RNAs, thereby promoting their rapid degradation.
