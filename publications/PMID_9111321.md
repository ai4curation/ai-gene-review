Homologs of Drosophila Mad function as downstream mediators of the receptors for 
transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-related factors. Two homologs, the 
receptor-associated Smad3 and the tumor suppressor Smad4/DPC4, synergize to 
induce ligand-independent TGF-beta activities and are essential mediators of the 
natural TGF-beta response. We now show that Smad3 and Smad4 associate in 
homomeric and heteromeric interactions, as assessed by yeast two-hybrid and 
coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Heteromeric interactions are mediated through 
the conserved C-terminal domains of Smad3 and Smad4. In Smad3, the homomeric 
interaction is mediated by the same domain. In contrast, the homomeric 
association of Smad4 requires both the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal 
domain, which by itself does not homomerize. Mutations that have been associated 
with impaired Mad activity in Drosophila or decreased tumor suppressor activity 
of Smad4/DPC4 in pancreas cancer, including a short C-terminal truncation and 
two point mutations in the conserved C-terminal domains, impair the ability of 
Smad3 and Smad4 to undergo homo- and heteromeric associations. Analyses of the 
biological activity of Smad3 and Smad4 and their mutants show that full 
signaling activity correlates with their ability to undergo efficient homo- and 
heteromeric interactions. Mutations that interfere with these interactions 
result in decreased signaling activity. Finally, we evaluated the ability of 
Smad3 or Smad4 to induce transcriptional activation in yeast. These results 
correlate the ability of individual Smads to homomerize with transcriptional 
activation and additionally with their biological activity in mammalian cells.
