p130(Cas) (Cas; crk-associated substrate) belongs to a new family of docking 
molecules. It contains one Src homology (SH) 3 domain in its amino-terminal 
region followed by a region containing binding motifs for SH2 and SH3 domains. 
To gain further insight into Cas signaling we used the SH3 domain of Cas in a 
two-hybrid screen to search a human placenta library for binding partners. The 
screen confirmed a previous finding of its binding to the focal adhesion kinase 
(FAK) but also identified C3G, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. We found 
direct interaction between Cas and C3G in vitro and in vivo. A series of 
analysis with C3G deletion mutants revealed a proline-rich Cas-binding site 
(Ala0-Pro1-Pro2-Lys3-Pro4-Pro5-Leu6-Pro7) located NH2-terminal to the previously 
characterized Crk binding motifs in C3G. Mutagenesis studies showed that Pro1, 
Lys3, and Pro4 within the ligand-binding site are critical for high affinity 
interaction. These results, combined with sequence alignments of proline-rich 
binding elements from proteins known for Cas binding, define the consensus 
sequence XXPXKPX which is recognized by the CasSH3 domain. Cas shows structural 
characteristics of a docking molecule and may serve to bring C3G to specific 
compartments within the cell.
