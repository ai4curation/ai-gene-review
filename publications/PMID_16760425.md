Abstract

The centrosome is an integral component of the eukaryotic cell cycle machinery, yet very few centrosomal proteins have been fully characterized to date. We have undertaken a series of biochemical and RNA interference (RNAi) studies to elucidate a role for CP110 in the centrosome cycle. Using a combination of yeast two-hybrid screens and biochemical analyses, we report that CP110 interacts with two different Ca 2+ -binding proteins, calmodulin (CaM) and centrin, in vivo. In vitro binding experiments reveal a direct, robust interaction between CP110 and CaM and the existence of multiple high-affinity CaM-binding domains in CP110. Native CP110 exists in large (∼300 kDa to 3 MDa) complexes that contain both centrin and CaM. We investigated a role for CP110 in CaM-mediated events using RNAi and show that its depletion leads to a failure at a late stage of cytokinesis and the formation of binucleate cells, mirroring the defects resulting from ablation of either CaM or centrin function. Importantly, expression of a CP110 mutant unable to bind CaM also promotes cytokinesis failure and binucleate cell formation. Taken together, our data demonstrate a functional role for CaM binding to CP110 and suggest that CP110 cooperates with CaM and centrin to regulate progression through cytokinesis.

INTRODUCTION

The centrosome is the microtubule-nucleating center in most eukaryotic cells ( Doxsey, 2001 ). It is composed of a pair of orthogonally arranged centrioles and surrounding pericentriolar material from which microtubules emanate and elongate. During cell cycle progression, centrosome duplication commences as cells enter S phase, coincident with the initiation of DNA replication. As a cell progresses through G 2 and enters mitosis, centrosomes separate and migrate to opposite poles to establish the mitotic spindle. The processes of centrosome duplication and separation, known collectively as the centrosome cycle, are precisely coordinated with the cell cycle to ensure proper chromosome segregation and cell division. Defects in the centrosome cycle often give rise to chromosome mis-segregation, genetic instability, aneuploidy, cancer, cell cycle arrest, or death ( Lingle et al ., 1998 ; Pihan et al ., 1998 ; Sluder and Nordberg, 2004 ; Badano et al ., 2005 ).

In addition to its essential function in microtubule organization, the centrosome is thought to be crucial for cytokinesis. Acentriolar Drosophila cell lines exhibit incomplete cytokinesis and rapidly become binucleate and polyploid ( Debec, 1978 ; Debec and Abbadie, 1989 ). In mammals, surgical removal of centrosomes results in cytokinesis failure without affecting spindle formation and chromosome segregation ( Hinchcliffe et al ., 2001 ; Khodjakov and Rieder, 2001 ). Live cell imaging experiments have revealed a transient repositioning of the mother centriole to the intercellular bridge, called the midbody, and this translocation is presumably necessary for signaling the completion of cytokinesis ( Piel et al ., 2001 ). Recent mass spectrometric analyses of purified centrosomes have identified many putative mammalian centrosomal proteins ( Andersen et al ., 2003 ). Although a function has not yet been assigned to many of these proteins, a handful of centrosomal proteins have been shown to play a role in cytokinesis. Suppression of γ-tubulin, centrin, or centriolin using RNA interference (RNAi) results in persistent intercellular bridges between dividing cells or coalescence of emerging daughter cells, ultimately leading to the generation of syncytia, binucleate, or multinucleate cells ( Shu et al ., 1995 ; Salisbury et al ., 2002 ; Gromley et al ., 2003 ; Fabbro et al ., 2005 ; Zou et al., 2005 ). Likewise, displacement of a centrosomal protein, AKAP450, by overexpression of a dominant-negative form of the protein results in abnormal cytokinesis and induces polyploidy ( Keryer et al ., 2003 ). Although these findings have unequivocally established a requirement of the centrosome in cytokinesis, the precise mechanisms by which centrosomal proteins regulate completion of this event remain largely elusive.

We previously identified CP110 as a centrosomal protein of 110 kDa in a screen for cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) substrates ( Chen et al ., 2002 ). Depletion of CP110 by RNAi abolishes centrosome reduplication in S-phase–arrested cells and induces premature centrosome separation, suggesting that this protein may positively regulate centrosome duplication and negatively control centrosome separation. Reduction of CP110 levels or expression of a CP110 mutant lacking most putative CDK phosphorylation sites promoted unscheduled centrosome separation, and cell lines stably expressing this phospho-acceptor mutant exhibit polyploid 4N or 8N DNA content. However, these studies did not address how polyploidy arises from a defect in CP110 and whether the mutant phenotypes result from abnormal cytokinesis.

To further explore a potential role for CP110 in cytokinesis and to elucidate components of pathways involving CP110 that are critical for its function, we initiated studies to identify CP110-interacting proteins. Using a combination of yeast two-hybrid screens and biochemical analysis, we demonstrate that CP110 interacts with two Ca 2+ -binding proteins, calmodulin (CaM) and centrin, in vivo. In vitro experiments establish that the association between CP110 and CaM is direct and robust. In contrast, CP110 appears to interact indirectly with centrin, and these three proteins (CP110, CaM, and centrin) form high-molecular-weight native complexes in vivo. Ablation of CP110 by RNAi results in overt tetraploidy and binucleate cells, hallmarks of cytokinesis failure. These phenotypes are reminiscent of defects induced by abrogation of centrin or CaM function, consistent with the notion that both CaM and centrin are essential for the completion of cytokinesis. To more precisely delineate the defects caused by CP110 loss, we performed live cell imaging and showed that CP110 plays a role in cytokinesis. Furthermore, we generated a mutant form of CP110 that interacts with centrin but binds poorly to CaM. Expression of such a mutant induces the formation of binucleate cells. Our results reveal the functional significance of CaM binding to CP110 and suggest that CP110 regulates progression through cytokinesis by cooperating with CaM and centrin.

Loss of CP110 Results in Cytokinesis Failure

Next, we investigated in greater detail how binucleate cells could arise as a result of CP110 depletion. Depletion of at least four other centrosomal proteins (centriolin, γ-tubulin, CEP55, and centrobin) besides centrin results in cytokinesis defects ( Shu et al ., 1995 ; Gromley et al ., 2003 ; Fabbro et al ., 2005 ; Zou et al., 2005 ). Furthermore, given the fact that CaM plays a well-established role in cytokinesis ( Moser et al., 1997 ; Lippincott and Li, 1998 ; Osman and Cerione, 1998 ), we asked whether binucleate cells with a polyploid DNA content arose after CP110 depletion as a consequence of cytokinesis failure using real-time videomicroscopy. We monitored siRNA-transfected cells with rhodamine-labeled oligonucleotides and used differential interference contrast (DIC) to image live HeLa cells progressing through mitosis ( Figure 8 ). Cells treated with a nonspecific control duplex progressed through mitosis and cleavage, after which daughter cells separated from one another, as expected. In striking contrast, cells treated with CP110 siRNAs progressed through mitosis but failed at a late stage in cytokinesis, leading to rapid fusion of emerging daughter cells and binucleate cell formation. We observed a similar block in cells treated with a centrin siRNA (unpublished data). We note that unlike the centriolin knockdown, which also gives rise to cytokinesis defects, we did not detect a frequent occurrence of long intercellular bridges.

Immunofluorescence experiments indicated that microtubules were not globally disrupted by CP110 knockdown, nor did we observe inappropriate localization of centrosomal markers (centrin, γ-tubulin, and C-NAP), suggesting that catastrophic disruption of centrosome assembly or microtubule arrays is not likely to underlie the cytokinesis defect (unpublished data). We conclude that CP110 plays a role in cytokinesis and that loss of this protein results in cytokinesis failure.

DISCUSSION

A detailed molecular description of the events involved in controlling the mammalian centrosome cycle has not yet been achieved. Beyond the events surrounding the duplication and function of this organelle, recent experiments involving surgical removal of this organelle and laser ablation also suggest that the centrosome plays a role in the initiation and completion of cytokinesis ( Hinchcliffe et al ., 2001 ; Khodjakov and Rieder, 2001 ; Piel et al ., 2001 ). Interestingly, several centrosomal proteins participate in cytokinesis, including centrin, centriolin, γ-tubulin, CEP55, and centrobin ( Shu et al ., 1995 ; Salisbury et al ., 2002 ; Gromley et al ., 2003 ; Keryer et al ., 2003 ; Fabbro et al ., 2005 ; Zou et al ., 2005 ). Clearly, elucidating the molecular architecture of the centrosome and deciphering the role of critical centrosomal proteins are essential for understanding not only centrosome function but also cytokinesis.

In an effort to begin identifying the proteins that play an important role in both processes, we have focused on CP110, which we have shown is important for centrosome reduplication and separation. Here, we have begun identifying CP110-interacting proteins and have found that two calcium-binding proteins, CaM and centrin, associate with high-molecular-weight, native CP110 complexes. CaM, a multifunctional Ca 2+ -binding protein and an important cell cycle and cytokinesis regulator ( Moser et al ., 1997 ; Lippincott and Li, 1998 ; Osman and Cerione, 1998 ), has also been implicated in centrosome function and has been shown to bind other centrosomal proteins ( Flory et al ., 2000 ; Takahashi et al ., 2002 ). Centrin, like CaM, is a member of the EF-hand family of small Ca 2+ -binding proteins. It shares significant sequence identity (45%) with CaM at the amino acid level and is a centrosomal component concentrated within the distal lumen of centrioles ( Salisbury, 1995 ; Paoletti et al ., 1996 ; Salisbury et al ., 2002 ). Our studies show that although CP110 binds to CaM directly, the association between CP110 and centrin does not appear to be direct and therefore may be mediated through other proteins ( Kilmartin, 2003 ). Further, we demonstrate that a CP110 mutant unable to bind CaM can still interact with centrin. Thus, two highly related calcium-binding proteins interact with CP110 in fundamentally different ways. Mass spectrometry should allow us to gain further insight into the molecular composition of the large, native CP110-CaM-centrin complexes and to identify additional proteins that connect CP110 to centrin.

Our observation that the association between CP110 and CaM is cell cycle–independent is especially interesting, because CaM does not appear to be concentrated at the centrosome during interphase. One likely explanation is that a small portion of total cellular CaM is always present at the centrosome. Indeed, CaM is an integral component of the central plaque of the yeast microtubule-nucleating center, the spindle pole body ( Geiser et al., 1993 ; Spang et al ., 1996 ; Sundberg et al ., 1996 ). Recent proteomic characterization has begun to shed light on the structure and composition of the human centrosome and has also detected the presence of CaM in this organelle during interphase ( Andersen et al ., 2003 ). In addition, CaM has been shown to interact with two pericentriolar matrix proteins, kendrin and CG-NAP ( Witczak et al ., 1999 ; Flory et al ., 2000 ). Further electron microscopic studies will be needed to define precisely the localization CaM at an ultrastructural level.

Several lines of evidence point toward a function for CP110 in cytokinesis, and the interaction between CP110, centrin, and CaM appears to play a pivotal role here. First, CP110 binds to CaM and centrin, both of which have been implicated in regulating this event ( Li et al ., 1999 ; Salisbury et al ., 2002 ). Second, expression of a nonphosphorylated CP110 mutant induces overt polyploidy, a common hallmark of cytokinesis failure ( Chen et al ., 2002 ). In addition, long-term disruption of CP110 with shRNA leads to polyploidy and phenocopies the CP110 phospho-mutant, whereas short-term disruption results in a binucleate phenotype, another outcome of cytokinesis malfunction. The striking similarity between the phenotypes resulting from CP110, CaM, or centrin ablation indicates that these proteins are likely to be connected by a common biological function. Interestingly, when CP110 and centrin are disabled together, we do not observe additive increases in the percentage of binucleate cells. These experiments suggest functional interactions between these two proteins and raise the possibility that CP110, centrin, and CaM could function in a genetic pathway that regulates the centrosome cycle and progression through cytokinesis.

We have further demonstrated a functional link between CP110 and CaM and its relevance to cytokinesis by studying the effects of inactivating three high-affinity CaM-binding domains within CP110. This mutant, 1-991Δ123, localizes to the centrosome, binds poorly to CaM in vitro and in vivo, and induces binucleate cell formation in vivo. The phenotype resulting from expression of this mutant is less pronounced than that observed after depletion of CP110 with siRNAs. One possible explanation is that the effect of expressing this mutant is dampened by the presence of endogenous CP110. Another possibility is that suppression of CP110 expression disrupts its interaction with both CaM and centrin, whereas overexpression of the CaM-binding mutant strictly abolishes the CP110-CaM interaction. Indeed, the CP110 CaM-binding mutant is fully capable of interacting with centrin ( Figure 9 C). It will be interesting to map the centrin-binding domains within CP110 to create a CP110 mutant refractory to binding both CaM and centrin. Such a mutant could produce a more potent binucleate phenotype.

Our observation of binucleate cells subsequent to CP110 depletion is reminiscent of findings in which acentrosomal cells were choreographed through mitosis ( Piel et al ., 2001 ). Acentriolar Drosophila cells exhibit hallmarks of incomplete cytokinesis, including intercellular bridges, binucleate formation, and polyploidy, arguing for a role for centrosomes in the process of cell abscission at the conclusion of cytokinesis ( Debec, 1978 ; Debec and Abbadie, 1989 ). Recent reports have revealed several proteins whose depletion could result in cytokinesis defects, and it is intriguing that four additional centriolar proteins other than CP110 (centrin, centriolin, CEP55, and centrobin) appear to play a role in cytokinesis ( Salisbury et al ., 2002 ; Gromley et al ., 2003 ; Fabbro et al ., 2005 ; Zou et al ., 2005 ). However, unlike centriolin or CEP55 silencing, which appears to result in long intercellular bridges, suppression of CP110 or centrobin expression leads to failed abscission without such bridges. This could suggest that centrosomes play multiple, distinct roles during cytokinesis. Although the basis for cytokinesis defects brought on by the loss of CP110 remains unknown, our findings suggest that abnormal cytokinesis does not result from an inability to nucleate or organize microtubules. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that centriolin may play a role in anchoring vesicle-targeting and vesicle-fusion protein complexes at the midbody during abscission ( Gromley et al ., 2005 ). On the basis of the conserved phenotypes resulting from depletion of CP110 and these centriolar proteins, it should be possible to begin dissecting the mechanisms that connect centrosome function and cytokinesis.

Although we have not yet fully defined the pathway(s) that link the function of centrosomal proteins such as CP110 or centrin with faithful completion of cytokinesis, the direct and robust interaction between CP110 and CaM offers several potential avenues for further exploration. Another interesting possibility involves interactions with a cytoskeletal network, and the identification of β-spectrin and α-actinin as CP110-interacting proteins in our two-hybrid screen may be particularly revealing in this regard. Furthermore, we have begun to biochemically fractionate centrosomal components, suggesting possible proteomic approaches for the identification of centrosome subassemblies. Future studies that combine genetic and proteomic approaches will allow us to unravel the complex functional relationships between different centrosomal components and provide important clues for elucidating their role in cytokinesis.
