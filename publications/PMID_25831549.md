conserved marker of heterochromatin, are inherited through several mitotic and 
meiotic cell divisions after removal of the sequence-specific initiator. The 
putative JmjC domain H3K9 demethylase, Epe1, and the chromodomain of the H3K9 
methyltransferase, Clr4/Suv39h, play opposing roles in maintaining silent H3K9me 
domains. These results demonstrate how a direct "read-write" mechanism involving 
Clr4 propagates histone modifications and allows histones to act as carriers of 
epigenetic information.

Abstract

Changes in histone post-translational modifications are associated with epigenetic states that define distinct patterns of gene expression. It remains unclear whether epigenetic information can be transmitted through histone modifications independently of specific DNA sequence, DNA methylation, or RNAi. Here we show that, in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , ectopically induced domains of histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me), a conserved marker of heterochromatin, are inherited through several mitotic and meiotic cell divisions after removal of the sequence-specific initiator. The putative JmjC domain H3K9 demethylase, Epel, and the chromodomain of the H3K9 methyltransferase, Clr4/Suv39h play opposing roles in maintaining silent H3K9me domains. These results demonstrate how a direct ‘read-write’ mechanism involving Clr4 propagates histone modifications and allows histones to act as carriers of epigenetic information.

Discussion

Our findings on mitotic and meiotic inheritance of H3K9 methylation and silent chromatin in the absence of sequence-specific recruitment, and without requirement for a small RNA positive-feedback loop associated with RNAi, or other known modification systems such as DNA CpG methylation, strongly suggest that histones modified by H3K9 methylation can act as carriers of epigenetic information. This conclusion is supported by (1) our demonstration that deletion of the fission yeast putative histone H3K9 demethylase, epel + , stabilizes the epigenetic OFF state and allows its transmission through >50 cell divisions, and (2) the requirement for the Clr4 methyltransferase chromodomain, a domain that recognizes di- and tri-methylated H3K9, suggesting a direct read-write mechanism for this mode of epigenetic inheritance.

Several recent studies have described the transgenera-tional inheritance of environmentally-induced changes in gene expression from parent to offspring ( 41 ). The mechanism of this transgenerational inheritance has not been fully defined but appears to occur via both small RNA-dependent and -independent pathways. In C. elegans , plants, fission yeast, and possibly other systems, the transmission of histone modification patterns is often coupled to small RNA generation and/or CpG DNA methylation ( 42 – 44 ). The latter pathways can form positive feedback loops that help maintain histone modification patterns ( 2 , 45 ). This coupling of positive feedback loops would increase the rate of reestablishment of silent domains and thus counteract the erasure activity of enzymes such as Epel or mechanisms that increase the rate of histone turnover.

A previous study used a small molecule dimerization strategy to show that ectopically-induced domains of H3K9 methylation at the Oct4 locus in murine fibroblasts can be maintained after the removal of the small molecule inducer by a mechanism that is reinforced by CpG DNA methylation ( 46 ). However, unlike the experiments presented here, the use of the Oct4 locus, which is normally packaged into heterochromatin in fibroblasts ( 46 ), precludes any conclusions about sequence-independent inheritance as contributions from locus-specific sequence elements that normally silence Oct4 in differentiated cells cannot be ruled out. It therefore remains to be determined whether H3K9 methylation can be inherited independently of specific DNA sequences or modulation of H3K9 demethylase activity in mammalian cells. Also, in fission yeast, a previous study reported that ectopic heterochromatin-dependent silencing of an ade6 + allele induced by a centromeric DNA fragment is maintained in an RNAi-dependent manner after excision of the centromeric DNA fragment ( 47 ), suggesting that a small RNA amplification loop may somehow be established at the ade6 + locus which helps maintain the silent state. However, these findings contradict other studies, which have demonstrated that silencing of ura4 + alleles by the generation of small RNA from a hairpin could not be maintained in the absence of the inducing hairpin ( 48 , 49 ). Our findings indicate that even in the absence of coupling to other positive feedback loops, or sequence-dependent initiation signals, H3K9 methylation defines a silent state that can be epige-netically inherited ( fig. S7 ). Maintenance of the OFF state is likely determined by the balance between the rate of H3K9 methylation by the Clr4 reader-writer module and the loss rate due to demethylation by an Epel-dependent mechanism, transcription-coupled nucleosome exchange, and dilution of histones during DNA replication.

Although demethylase activity for the S. pombe Epel protein has not yet been demonstrated in vitro, key residues required for demethylase activity in other Jumonji domain proteins are conserved in Epel and required for its in vivo effects on silencing ( 30 , 50 ), and its effect on initiator-independent inheritance of heterochromatin (this study, Fig. 4C ). In addition, a recent study showed that the activity of human PHF2, another member of the Jumonji domain protein family, is regulated by phosphorylation ( 51 ), raising the possibility that a post-translational modification or co-factor may be required for reconstitution of Epel demethylase activity. Regulation of histone demethylation activity may play a broad role in determining the reversibility of epigenetic states. Although it is unknown whether Epel activity or levels regulate epigenetic transitions in S. pombe , regulation of histone demethylase activity has been implicated in control of developmental transitions in multicellular eukaryotes. In mouse embryonic stem cells, the pluripotency transcription factor Oct4 activates the expression of Jumonji domain Jmjdla and Jmjd2c H3K9 deme-thylases and this activation appears to be important for stem cell self-renewal ( 52 ). An attractive possibility is that as epigenetic states become established during transition from pluripotency to the differentiated state, reduction in the expression of H3K9 demethylases helps stabilize the differentiated state ( 52 ). In another example, down-regulation of the amine oxidase family histone demethylase LSD1 during activation of individual olfactory receptor (OR) genes in the mammalian nose has been suggested to create an “epigenetic trap” that prevents the activation of additional OR genes ( 53 ). More generally, H3K9 demethylases may act as surveillance enzymes that prevent the formation of spurious H3K9 methylated domains, which may lead to epigenetic mutations and gene inactivation.
