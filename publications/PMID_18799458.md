The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-type 9 (PCSK9), which promotes 
degradation of the hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), is now 
recognized as a major player in plasma cholesterol metabolism. Several 
gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 cause hypercholesterolemia and premature 
atherosclerosis, and thus, inhibition of PCSK9-induced degradation of the LDLR 
may be used to treat this deadly disease. Herein, we discovered an endogenous 
PCSK9 binding partner by Far Western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation, and 
pull-down assays. Following two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass 
spectrometry analysis, we demonstrated that PCSK9 binds to a approximately 
33-kDa protein identified as annexin A2 (AnxA2) but not to the closely related 
annexin A1. Furthermore, our functional LDLR assays and small hairpin RNA 
studies show that AnxA2 and the AnxA2.p11 complex could prevent PCSK9-directed 
LDLR degradation in HuH7, HepG2, and Chinese hamster ovary cells. 
Immunocytochemistry revealed that PCSK9 and AnxA2 co-localize at the cell 
surface, indicating a possible competition with the LDLR. Structure-function 
analyses demonstrated that the C-terminal cysteine-histidine-rich domain of 
PCSK9 interacts specifically with the N-terminal repeat R1 of AnxA2. Mutational 
analysis of this 70-amino acid-long repeat indicated that the RRTKK81 sequence 
of AnxA2 is implicated in this binding because its mutation to AATAA81 prevents 
its interaction with PCSK9. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first to 
show that PCSK9 activity on LDLR can be regulated by an endogenous inhibitor. 
The identification of the minimal inhibitory sequence of AnxA2 should pave the 
way toward the development of PCSK9 inhibitory lead molecules for the treatment 
of hypercholesterolemia.
