Previously we have demonstrated that focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-promoted 
migration on fibronectin (FN) by its overexpression in CHO cells is dependent on 
FAK autophosphorylation at Y397 and subsequent binding of Src to this site. In 
this report, we have examined the role of FAK association with Grb2 and 
p130(Cas), two downstream events of the FAK/Src complex that could mediate 
integrin-stimulated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erks). 
We show that a Y925F FAK mutant was able to promote cell migration as 
efficiently as FAK and that the transfected FAK demonstrated no detectable 
association with Grb2 in CHO cells. In contrast, cells expressing a FAK 
P712/715A mutant demonstrated a level of migration comparable to that of control 
cells. This mutation did not affect FAK kinase activity, autophosphorylation, or 
Src association but did significantly reduce p130(Cas) association with FAK. 
Furthermore, FAK expression in CHO cells increased tyrosine phosphorylation of 
p130(Cas) and its subsequent binding to several SH2 domains, which depended on 
both the p130(Cas) binding site and the Src binding site. However, we did not 
detect increased activation of Erks in cells expressing FAK, and the MEK 
inhibitor PD98059 did not decrease FAK-promoted cell migration. Finally, we show 
that coexpression of p130(Cas) further increased cell migration on FN and 
coexpression of the p130(Cas) SH3 domain alone functioned as a dominant negative 
mutant and decreased cell migration. Together, these results demonstrate that 
p130(Cas), but not Grb2, is a mediator of FAK-promoted cell migration and 
suggest that FAK/ p130(Cas) complex targets downstream pathways other than Erks 
in mediating FAK-promoted cell migration.
