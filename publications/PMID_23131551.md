The human ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) has multi-functions such as translation, 
DNA repair and apoptosis. These multiple functions are regulated by 
post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, methylation and 
sumoylation. We report here a novel function of rpS3 that is involved in 
mitosis. When we examined localization of ribosomal proteins in mitosis, we 
found that rpS3 specifically localizes on the mitotic spindle. Depletion of the 
rpS3 proteins caused mitotic arrest during the metaphase. Furthermore, the shape 
of the spindle and chromosome movement in the rpS3 depleted cell was abnormal. 
Microtubule (MT) polymerization also decreased in rpS3 depleted cells, 
suggesting that rpS3 is involved in spindle dynamics. Therefore, we concluded 
that rpS3 acts as a microtubule associated protein (MAP) and regulates spindle 
dynamics during mitosis.
