The Bcl-2 family proteins are critical apoptosis regulators that associate with 
mitochondria and control the activation of caspases. Recently, both mammalian 
and C. elegans Bcl-2 proteins have been implicated in controlling mitochondrial 
fusion and fission processes in both living and apoptotic cells. To better 
understand the potential roles of Bcl-2 family proteins in regulating 
mitochondrial dynamics, we carried out a detailed analysis of mitochondria in 
animals that either lose or have increased activity of egl-1 and ced-9, two 
Bcl-2 family genes that induce and inhibit apoptosis in C. elegans, 
respectively. Unexpectedly, we found that loss of egl-1 or ced-9, or 
overexpression of their gene products, had no apparent effect on mitochondrial 
connectivity or mitochondrial size. Moreover, loss of ced-9 did not affect the 
mitochondrial morphology observed in a drp-1 mutant, in which mitochondrial 
fusion occurs but mitochondrial fission is defective, or in a fzo-1 mutant, in 
which mitochondrial fission occurs but mitochondrial fusion is restricted, 
suggesting that ced-9 is not required for either the mitochondrial fission or 
fusion process in C. elegans. Taken together, our results argue against an 
evolutionarily conserved role for Bcl-2 proteins in regulating mitochondrial 
fission and fusion.
