Wnt signaling pathways are essential for embryonic patterning, and they are 
disturbed in a wide spectrum of diseases, including cancer. An unresolved 
question is how the different Wnt pathways are supported and regulated. We 
previously established that the postsynaptic density 95/disc-large/zona 
occludens (PDZ) protein syntenin binds to syndecans, Wnt coreceptors, and known 
stimulators of protein kinase C (PKC)alpha and CDC42 activity. Here, we show 
that syntenin also interacts with the C-terminal PDZ binding motif of several 
Frizzled Wnt receptors, without compromising the recruitment of Dishevelled, a 
key downstream Wnt-signaling component. Syntenin is coexpressed with cognate 
Frizzled during early development in Xenopus. Overexpression and down-regulation 
of syntenin disrupt convergent extension movements, supporting a role for 
syntenin in noncanonical Wnt signaling. Syntenin stimulates c-jun 
phosphorylation and modulates Frizzled 7 signaling, in particular the 
PKCalpha/CDC42 noncanonical Wnt signaling cascade. The syntenin-Frizzled 7 
binding mode indicates syntenin can accommodate Frizzled 7-syndecan complexes. 
We propose that syntenin is a novel component of the Wnt signal transduction 
cascade and that it might function as a direct intracellular link between 
Frizzled and syndecans.
