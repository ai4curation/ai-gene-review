Heteromeric amino acid transporters are composed of a heavy and a light subunit 
linked by a disulfide bridge. 4F2hc/xCT elicits sodium-independent exchange of 
anionic L-cysteine and L-glutamate (system x(c)(-)). Based on the accessibility 
of single cysteines to 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin, we propose a 
topological model for xCT of 12 transmembrane domains with the N and C termini 
located inside the cell. This location of N and C termini was confirmed by 
immunofluorescence. Studies of biotinylation and accessibility to sulfhydryl 
reagents revealed a re-entrant loop within intracellular loops 2 and 3. Residues 
His(110) and Thr(112), facing outside, are located at the apex of the re-entrant 
loop. Biotinylation of H110C was blocked by xCT substrates, by the 
nontransportable inhibitor (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine, and by the impermeable 
reagent (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate, which produced an inactivation 
of H110C that was protected by L-glutamate and L-cysteine with an IC(50) similar 
to the K(m). Protection was temperatureindependent. The data indicate that 
His(110) may lie close to the substrate binding/permeation pathway of xCT. The 
membrane topology of xCT could serve as a model for other light subunits of 
heteromeric amino acid transporters.
