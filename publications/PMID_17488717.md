Sirtuins are evolutionarily conserved NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases and 
ADP-ribosyltransferases involved in the regulation of cell division, apoptosis, 
DNA damage repair, genomic silencing, and longevity. Recent studies have focused 
on identifying target substrates for human sirtuin enzymatic activity, but 
little is known about processes that directly regulate their function. Here, we 
demonstrate that SIRT2 is phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo on serine 368 
by the cell-cycle regulator, cyclin-dependent kinase 1, and dephosphorylated by 
the phosphatases CDC14A and CDC14B. Overexpression of SIRT2 mediates a delay in 
cellular proliferation that is dependent on serine 368 phosphorylation. 
Furthermore, mutation of serine 368 reduces hyperploidy in cells under mitotic 
stress due to microtubule poisons.
