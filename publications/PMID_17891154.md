The retromer complex is required for the sorting of acid hydrolases to 
lysosomes, transcytosis of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, Wnt gradient 
formation, iron transporter recycling and processing of the amyloid precursor 
protein. Human retromer consists of two smaller complexes: the cargo recognition 
VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 heterotrimer and a membrane-targeting heterodimer or homodimer 
of SNX1 and/or SNX2 (ref. 13). Here we report the crystal structure of a 
VPS29-VPS35 subcomplex showing how the metallophosphoesterase-fold subunit VPS29 
(refs 14, 15) acts as a scaffold for the carboxy-terminal half of VPS35. VPS35 
forms a horseshoe-shaped, right-handed, alpha-helical solenoid, the concave face 
of which completely covers the metal-binding site of VPS29, whereas the convex 
face exposes a series of hydrophobic interhelical grooves. Electron microscopy 
shows that the intact VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 complex is a stick-shaped, flexible 
structure, approximately 21 nm long. A hybrid structural model derived from 
crystal structures, electron microscopy, interaction studies and bioinformatics 
shows that the alpha-solenoid fold extends the full length of VPS35, and that 
VPS26 is bound at the opposite end from VPS29. This extended structure presents 
multiple binding sites for the SNX complex and receptor cargo, and appears 
capable of flexing to conform to curved vesicular membranes.
