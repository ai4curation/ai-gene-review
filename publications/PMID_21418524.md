The Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain serine/threonine kinase PASKIN, or PAS kinase, 
links energy flux and protein synthesis in yeast, regulates glycogen synthesis 
and protein translation in mammals, and might be involved in insulin regulation 
in the pancreas. According to the current model, binding of a putative ligand to 
the PAS domain disinhibits the kinase domain, leading to PASKIN 
autophosphorylation and increased kinase activity. To date, only synthetic but 
no endogenous PASKIN ligands have been reported. In the present study, we 
identified a number of novel PASKIN kinase targets, including ribosomal protein 
S6. Together with our previous identification of eukaryotic elongation factor 
1A1, this suggests a role for PASKIN in the regulation of mammalian protein 
translation. When searching for endogenous PASKIN ligands, we found that various 
phospholipids can bind PASKIN and stimulate its autophosphorylation. 
Interestingly, the strongest binding and autophosphorylation was achieved with 
monophosphorylated phosphatidylinositols. However, stimulated PASKIN 
autophosphorylation did not correlate with ribosomal protein S6 and eukaryotic 
elongation factor 1A1 target phosphorylation. Although autophosphorylation was 
enhanced by monophosphorylated phosphatidylinositols, di- and tri-phosphorylated 
phosphatidylinositols inhibited autophosphorylation. By contrast, target 
phosphorylation was always inhibited, with the highest efficiency for di- and 
tri-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols. Because phosphatidylinositol 
monophosphates were found to interact with the kinase rather than with the PAS 
domain, these data suggest a multiligand regulation of PASKIN activity, 
including a still unknown PAS domain binding/activating ligand and kinase domain 
binding modulatory phosphatidylinositol phosphates.
