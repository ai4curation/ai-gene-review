ADAM family plays important roles in neurogenesis. The cytoplasmic tail of 
ADAM19 (ADAM19-CT) contains 193 residues. The presence of two putative SH3 
ligand-binding sites suggests potential interactions with cytosolic proteins, 
which could be possibly linked to the functions of ADAM19. To address these 
issues, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed in human fetal brain cDNA 
library to isolate proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM19. 
Four proteins were obtained, ArgBP1, beta-cop, ubiquitin and a novel protein. 
GST-Pulldown assay has confirmed the interaction between AdAM19 and ArgBP1. By 
constructing series of deletion mutants of ADAM19-CT and ArgBP1 respectively, 
the interaction regions have been identified. They are the SH3 binding sites in 
ADAM19-CT and the P4 region in ArgBP1. And the interaction is specific. ArgBP1 
does not bind to ADAM22, ADAM29 or ADAM9 (mouse). ArgBP1 may be the key protein, 
which accounts for the physiological function of ADAM19.
