The amyloid-β protein precursor (APP) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Knock-out and transgenic mouse studies of the 
adaptor protein Mint2 have revealed that it is a major player in regulating APP 
metabolism physiologically through the binding of its phosphotyrosine-binding 
(PTB) domain to the intracellular domain of APP. However, the molecular 
mechanism of APP dynamically binding to Mint2 remains elusive. Here, we report 
the structures of APP peptide-free and APP peptide-bound C-terminal Mint2 
mutants at resolutions of 2.7 and 3.3 Å, respectively. Our structures reveal 
that APP peptide-free Mint2 exists in a closed state in which the ARM domain 
blocks the peptide-binding groove of the PTB domain. In sharp contrast, APP 
peptide-bound Mint2 exists in an open state in which the ARM domain drastically 
swings away from the bound peptide. Mutants that control the open-closed motion 
of Mint2 dynamically regulated APP metabolism both in vitro and in vivo. Our 
results uncover a novel open-closed mechanism of the PTB domain dynamically 
binding to its peptide substrate. Moreover, such a conformational switch may 
represent a general regulation mode of APP family members by Mint proteins, 
providing useful information for the treatment of AD.
