Downregulated in renal cell carcinoma 1 (DRR1) has important roles in tumor cell 
growth, neuron survival and spine formation, and was recently shown to bind 
actin. However, the roles of nuclear DRR1 remain largely unexplored. Here, we 
identified an interaction between filamentous actin (F-actin) and DRR1 in the 
nucleus, and demonstrated that copper metabolism MURR1 domain-containing 1 
(COMMD1) is another binding partner of DRR1. Accordingly, DRR1, F-actin and 
COMMD1 were shown to form a complex in the nucleus, and the stability of COMMD1 
was enhanced in this complex. Increased nuclear COMMD1 in turn promoted the 
degradation of NF-κB. In addition, DRR1 and COMMD1 suppressed the cyclin D1 
expression, G1/S transition and cell proliferation of neuroblastoma cells. The 
binding between DRR1 and F-actin in the nucleus was required for these events. 
Consistent with these facts, low expressions of DRR1 were associated with 
tumorigenesis of human neuroblastoma and its mouse model. This study has thus 
revealed a novel nuclear complex of F-actin, DRR1 and COMMD1 that is involved in 
NF-κB degradation and cell cycle suppression in neuroblastoma cells.
