Mutations in each of the five eucaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) subunits 
have been found in leukodystrophies of various severity: Cree 
leukoencephalopathy, childhood ataxia with central 
hypomyelination/leukodystrophy with vanishing white matter and 
ovarioleukodystrophy. A continuum was observed from fatal infantile forms to 
adult forms without neurological deterioration. Disease severity was found to 
correlate with the age at disease onset and the specific amino-acid 
substitution. In order to analyze the functional consequences of eIF2B 
mutations, we measured the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of 
eIF2B in transformed lymphocytes from 30 affected patients carrying mutations in 
eIF2B compared to 10 unaffected heterozygotes and 22 controls without eIF2B 
mutations. A significant decrease of 20-70% in GEF activity was observed in all 
mutated cells. The severity of this decrement of GEF activity correlated with 
age at onset of the disease. These results suggest that a deficiency in GEF 
activity underlies the encephalopathy associated eIF2B-related disease. Our 
study demonstrates that the evaluation of the GEF activity in transformed 
lymphocytes represents an interesting alternative test to the systematic 
screening of the five EIF2B genes. This relevant cellular model may also be used 
to test the functional impact of different molecules on the GEF activity for 
future therapeutic strategies.
