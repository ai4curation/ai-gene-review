Adaptor protein complexes (APs) function as vesicle coat components in different 
membrane traffic pathways; however, there are a number of pathways for which 
there is still no candidate coat. To find novel coat components related to AP 
complexes, we have searched the expressed sequence tag database and have 
identified, cloned, and sequenced a new member of each of the four AP subunit 
families. We have shown by a combination of coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 
two-hybrid analysis that these four proteins (epsilon, beta4, mu4, and sigma4) 
are components of a novel adaptor-like heterotetrameric complex, which we are 
calling AP-4. Immunofluorescence reveals that AP-4 is localized to approximately 
10-20 discrete dots in the perinuclear region of the cell. This pattern is 
disrupted by treating the cells with brefeldin A, indicating that, like other 
coat proteins, the association of AP-4 with membranes is regulated by the small 
GTPase ARF. Immunogold electron microscopy indicates that AP-4 is associated 
with nonclathrin-coated vesicles in the region of the trans-Golgi network. The 
mu4 subunit of the complex specifically interacts with a tyrosine-based sorting 
signal, indicating that, like the other three AP complexes, AP-4 is involved in 
the recognition and sorting of cargo proteins with tyrosine-based motifs. AP-4 
is of relatively low abundance, but it is expressed ubiquitously, suggesting 
that it participates in a specialized trafficking pathway but one that is 
required in all cell types.
