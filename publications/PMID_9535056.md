The amyloid precursor protein (APP) and APP-like (APLP) material, as visualized 
with the Mab22C11 antibody, have previously been shown to be associated with 
radial glia in hypothalamus, which are known to promote neurite outgrowth. By 
Northern blot analysis, APP 695 mRNA levels increased steadily over hypothalamic 
development, APP 770 mRNA was transiently expressed at 12 days postnatally, and 
APLP mRNA was only weakly expressed in the hypothalamus. The developmental 
pattern of APP moeities in mouse hypothalamus and in fetal hypothalamic neurons 
in culture was compared with a presenilin 2 (PS2) related protein using an 
antibody developed against the N-terminal part of PS2. By Western blot analysis, 
APP and PS2-like immunoreactivity were visualized as a 100-130 and 52 kDa bands, 
respectively. An APP biphasic increase was observed during hypothalamic 
development in vivo. APP immunoreactivity was equally detected in neuronal and 
glial cultures, while PS2-like material was more concentrated in neurons. A 
correlation between APP/APP-like and PS2-like levels was observed during 
development in vivo. While APP was mostly associated with membrane fractions, a 
significant portion of PS2-like material was also recovered from cytosolic 
fractions in vitro. In contrast to native PS2 in COS-transfected cells, the 
PS2-like material did not aggregate after heating for 90 s at 90 degrees C. 
These results indicate a close association between APP and PS2-like material 
during hypothalamic development in vivo, and suggest that neuronal and glial 
cultures may provide appropriate models to test their interactions.
