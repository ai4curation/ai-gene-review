Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), which is a novel pathway of regulating 
cellular apoptosis and the function of ERS during corpus luteum (CL) regression, 
is explored. Early-luteal stage (day 2), mid-luteal stage (day 7), and 
late-luteal stage (day 14 and 20) were induced, and the apoptosis of luteal 
cells was detected by a terminal 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nick-end 
labeling (TUNEL) assay. The apoptotic cells were increased with the regression 
of CL, especially during the late-luteal stage. The ERS markers 
glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous 
protein (CHOP), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), activating transcription factor 
6α (ATF6α), eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), inositol-requiring protein 
1α (IRE1α), caspase 12, and apoptosis marker caspase 3 were analyzed by 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, in agreement 
with the results of the TUNEL assay; the expression levels of CHOP, caspase 12, 
and caspase 3 were increased during the process of CL regression. Luteal cells 
were isolated and cultured in vitro, and the apoptosis of luteal cells was 
induced by prostaglandin F2α. The ERS was attenuated by the ERS inhibitor 
tauroursodeoxycholic acid, and the apoptotic rate was analyzed by flow 
cytometry. The ERS markers Grp78, CHOP, XBP1s, ATF6α, eIF2α, IRE1α, caspase 12, 
and apoptotic execute marker caspase 3 were analyzed by real-time PCR and 
immunofluorescence, and the results suggested that the expression of CHOP, 
caspase 12, and caspase 3 were increased, and there was increased apoptosis of 
luteal cells. But the expression of IRE1α/XBP1s and eIF2α was not detected. 
Taken together, the ERS is involved in the CL regression of rats through the 
CHOP and caspase 12 pathway.
