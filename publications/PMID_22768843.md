Serotonergic regulation of feeding behavior has been studied intensively, both 
for an understanding of the basic neurocircuitry of energy balance in various 
organisms and as a therapeutic target for human obesity. However, its underlying 
molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that neural 
serotonin signaling in C. elegans modulates feeding behavior through inhibition 
of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) in interneurons expressing the C. elegans 
counterpart of human SIM1, a transcription factor associated with obesity. In 
turn, glutamatergic signaling links these interneurons to pharyngeal neurons 
implicated in feeding behavior. We show that AMPK-mediated regulation of 
glutamatergic release is conserved in rat hippocampal neurons. These findings 
reveal cellular and molecular mediators of serotonergic signaling.
