Introduction

Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9, gene PCSK9 ) is a serine protease of the subtilase family ( 1 ) and the last member of the proprotein convertase family (eukaryotic subfamily S8B) ( 2 , 3 ). It is mainly expressed in the liver and to a lesser extent in the small intestine and kidney ( 1 , 4 ). PCSK9 plays a unique role in cholesterol homeostasis and has been genetically associated with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder also caused by mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) 3 or apolipoprotein B-100 ( 5 ). Following the autocatalytic cleavage of the zymogen pro-PCSK9 into PCSK9 within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, the protein exits this compartment as a tight complex with its inhibitory prosegment and is then secreted ( 1 , 6 , 7 ). Upon binding to the EGF-A domain of the LDLR via the catalytic domain of PCSK9 ( 8 , 9 ), either intracellularly or at the cell surface ( 10 ), the PCSK9·LDLR complex is routed to endosomes/lysosomes for degradation in acidic compartments ( 11 , 12 ). In mice ( 4 , 13 ) and humans ( 14 , 15 ), the consequence of lower levels of hepatic LDLR is a reduced clearance of LDL-cholesterol from the plasma, resulting in hypercholesterolemia. A significant fraction of circulating PCSK9, which mostly originates from liver hepatocytes ( 4 , 16 ), is cleaved therein by the proprotein convertase furin at the RFHR 218 ↓QA sequence resulting in an inactive shorter form, PCSK9-ΔN 218 , lacking the N-terminal 218 amino acids ( 17 , 18 ). Also, recent studies revealed that the C-terminal Cys/His-rich domain (CHRD) of PCSK9 plays a crucial role in its biological activity ( 19 – 21 ). The CHRD of PCSK9 is composed of three tandem repeat modules M1, M2, and M3 ( 7 ), where the absence of M2 does not affect PCSK9 secretion but seems to prevent the extracellular activity of PCSK9 in enhancing the degradation of cell-surface LDLR ( 21 ). Apart from furin, other proteins have been identified to regulate PCSK9 levels such as the transcription factors sterol regulatory element-binding proteins ( 22 ) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α ( 23 ), berberine ( 23 , 24 ), and possibly fenofibrates ( 25 ). Transcriptional activation of PCSK9 is mainly regulated by nuclear SREBP-2, which binds to sterol regulatory elements and increases PCSK9 transcription ( 22 ), as well as hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α ( 23 ). Those proteins regulate PCSK9 expression level.

Both furin ( 17 ) and annexin A2 (AnxA2) ( 20 , 26 ) have been identified to directly inactivate or interact with extracellular PCSK9 to reduce its activity at a post-transcriptional level. AnxA2 is mostly expressed in lungs, aorta, heart, and small intestine. The protein is present as a monomer and as a heterotetrameric complex with p11 ( 27 ) that regulates various cellular processes. AnxA2 is localized in the nucleus ( 28 ), in the cytosol, and at the cell membrane. This multifunctional protein, which is mostly implicated in vascular fibrinolysis/homeostasis in endothelial cells ( 27 ), binds the CHRD of PCSK9 at the cell surface and inhibits its extracellular LDLR-degrading activity. This protein has also been characterized as an mRNA-binding protein and implicated in the translational regulation of itself, prolyl 4-hydroxylase-α1, c-Myc, and p53 by binding to specific sequences in the 3′-untranslated region of their mRNA ( 29 – 32 ).

To better define the role of AnxA2 in the regulation of PCSK9 function, we investigated the impact of AnxA2 in two commonly used human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, Huh7 and HepG2. We produced stable AnxA2 and PCSK9 knockdown (AnxA2-KD and PCSK9-KD) in both cell lines using short hairpin RNA delivered using a lentiviral delivery approach. These modified cell lines allowed the identification of a novel function of intracellular AnxA2 in regulating PCSK9 mRNA translation. We also showed that the M1 and M2 domains are critical for the interaction of PCSK9 and AnxA2. We next used human and mouse PCSK9 in 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI)-labeled LDL (DiI-LDL) incorporation cell-based assays, using the above cells lines, and hence defined the sensitivity of LDLR in these cells to extracellular PCSK9, revealing marked differences between the roles of AnxA2 on PCSK9 in HepG2 and Huh7 cells.

DISCUSSION

Here, we showed that PCSK9 and LDLR protein levels are differentially sensitive to AnxA2 mRNA knockdown in Huh7 versus HepG2 cells. Reduction of AnxA2 expression in Huh7 cells resulted in increased PCSK9 protein levels both in cells and media, whereas no difference was observed in HepG2 AnxA2-KD cells. Also, LDLR total and cell-surface protein levels were reduced as a direct consequence of increased PCSK9 protein levels in Huh7 AnxA2-KD cells. Because AnxA2 mRNA levels are 5-fold lower in naive HepG2 cells versus Huh7, we sought to determine whether overexpression of AnxA2 in HepG2 cells would affect protein levels of PCSK9. HepG2 cells stably overexpressing AnxA2 resulted in a reduction of PCSK9 protein levels as opposed to an increase in Huh7 AnxA2-KD cells. Based on QPCR analysis, no significant changes were observed in PCSK9 mRNA levels suggesting that removal or overexpression of AnxA2 in Huh7 or HepG2 cells, respectively, did not modify the transcription of PCSK9 or LDLR genes. Additionally, we excluded a possible effect of AnxA2 on PCSK9 protein stability at a post-translational step because its half-life was not changed in cycloheximide time course experiments. Thus, we hypothesize that AnxA2 might be involved in a negative translational regulation of PCSK9 mRNA. In fact, previous studies have shown that AnxA2 can bind to higher order structures of 3′UTR of specific mRNAs such as AnxA2 itself, collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase-α(I), N -methyl- d -aspartate R1, and c-Myc ( 29 – 32 , 45 , 46 ). These studies identified and suggested a consensus motif 5′-AA(C/G)(A/U)G-3′ that was frequently present in mRNA regions binding AnxA2. AnxA2 is also associated with a subpopulation of messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes ( 46 ) and can reduce its own translation ( 45 ). Therefore, it is possible that AnxA2 plays a role in both localization and/or activation/repression of translation during transport of specific mRNAs, including that of PCSK9. Trans-acting proteins on 3′UTR mainly regulate mRNA transport or their stability, whereas those interacting with the 5′UTR are mostly involved in initiation of translation ( 45 ). Based on RIP assay results, endogenous PCSK9 mRNA in Huh7 cells is coimmunoprecipitated with AnxA2, which supports the hypothesis of PCSK9 regulation through AnxA2 binding with PCSK9 mRNA. Based on the suggested consensus sequence motif, our analysis reveals the presence of five potential binding sites in the 3′UTR of PCSK9 mRNA ( Fig. 4 A ). Removal of the PCSK9 3′UTR prevented the coimmunoprecipitation of AnxA2·PCSK9 mRNA as compared with the coimmunoprecipitation of PCSK9 containing its 3′UTR in HEK293 cells. Therefore, AnxA2 clearly forms a complex with the 3′UTR of PCSK9 mRNA. Future experiments will be required to confirm whether AnxA2 binds to one or more site(s) in the 3′UTR of PCSK9 mRNA to inhibit its translation, as it does for its own translation ( 45 ). Furthermore, AnxA2 may also inhibit PCSK9 mRNA transport and/or reduce its stability. Interestingly, cholesterol profiles of AnxA2 −/− mice ( 26 ) revealed that the loss of AnxA2 is associated with 2-fold higher levels of circulating PCSK9 and 40% higher circulating LDL-cholesterol. Moreover, QPCR analysis did not reveal a significant change in PCSK9 mRNA levels in liver and other tissues. Accordingly, we now hypothesize that loss of AnxA2 expression in mice could result in both a decrease in PCSK9 endogenous inhibition in some tissues ( 26 ), but may also be associated with a loss of repression of PCSK9 mRNA translation (this work) leading to the reported 2-fold increased circulating PCSK9 levels ( 26 ).

Also, we sought to identify the module within the CHRD of PCSK9 that is responsible for the specific interaction with AnxA2 using previously generated CHRD deletions (ΔM1, ΔM2, ΔM3, ΔM12, ΔM23, and ΔM13) using a far-Western blot assay ( 21 ). Our results suggest that M3 is the only dispensable module for the specific interaction of PCSK9 with AnxA2. None of the GOF or loss-of-function single point mutants within the M1, M2, or hinge domains analyzed modified the ability of PCSK9 to bind AnxA2 ( Fig. 6 ). However, deletion of either M1 or M2 abrogated the interaction between the two proteins. The specific amino acids responsible for PCSK9-AnxA2 interaction within the M1 + M2 domain remain to be characterized. Interestingly, monoclonal antibodies targeting the M3 ( 47 ) or M1 ( 48 ) domain of PCSK9 resulted in a maximal 50% inhibition of PCSK9 activity on LDLR. Thus, it is possible that targeting both M1 and M2 domains may result in a more efficient inhibition of PCSK9 activity than only one of them individually.

In this study, we also have presented the production and purification to homogeneity of three recombinants PCSK9s (hPCSK9-RS, hPCSK9-RSDY, and mPCSK9-RS). Sequencing of those mutants demonstrated the presence of prodomain autoprocessing and their resistance to furin cleavage at Arg 218 for hPCSK9 and Arg 221 for mPCSK9. MS analysis of hPCSK9-RS and -RSDY under SAP and PNGase F incubation revealed different molecular mass heterogeneity of secreted PCSK9 as described previously ( 29 ). Our results further indicated that secreted recombinant PCSK9 from Drosophila S2 cells resulted in the same PTMs (Tyr sulfation, Ser-phosphorylation, and Asn glycosylation) as observed in secreted PCSK9 from human cell lines.

Using a cell-based assay, we confirmed that recombinant proteins were biologically active and reduced DiI-LDL uptake in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC 50 of 49, 1.7, and 36 n m for hPCSK9-RS, hPCSK9-RSDY, and mPCSK9-RS, respectively. The fact that mouse and human PCSK9 exhibits similar potencies toward enhancing the cellular degradation of the LDLR ( Fig. 10 ) validates the work done using mice overexpressing either mouse or human PCSK9, either as transgenes ( 4 , 49 ) or following recombinant adenovirus expression ( 22 , 50 ). The EC 50 value of hPCSK9-RS produced in Drosophila S2 cells is similar to the one reported for wild type PCSK9 produced in HEK293 cells (EC 50 of ∼60 n m) ( 44 , 51 ). As shown previously, the mutant GOF D374Y in human recombinant PCSK9 increased the potency by ∼30-fold with an EC 50 of 1.7 n m similar to Fisher et al. ( 51 ) who obtained an EC 50 of 3.5 n m . This increased potency is linked to PCSK9-D374Y higher affinity toward the LDLR ( 7 ).

It was previously shown that HepG2 cells are 2–3-fold more sensitive to PCSK9 action on endogenous LDLR than Huh7 cells ( 41 ), leading us to postulate that the lower levels of AnxA2 in HepG2 cells ( Fig. 1 A ) may in part be responsible for this observation. This was further supported by the higher DiI-LDL incorporation in HepG2 cells overexpressing AnxA2 ( Fig. 11 C ). This is the rationale behind the routine use of HepG2 (as opposed to Huh7) cells to screen for PCSK9 activity, as also done in this work. However, we were intrigued by the observation that DiI-LDL incorporation was 20% higher in Huh7 AnxA2-KD ( Fig. 11 E ) but 40% lower in HepG2 AnxA2-KD ( Fig. 11 B ). Morel et al. ( 52 ) showed that knockdown of AnxA2 expression inhibited endosomal-lysosomal sorting revealing that AnxA2 can regulate endosomal trafficking to lysosomes. It is thus possible that in cells expressing high levels of AnxA2 ( e.g. Huh7 cells), the latter may also enhance the rate of degradation of the endocytosed DiI-LDL·LDLR complex.

In conclusion, the data presented in this work confirmed the inhibitory property of secreted AnxA2 on PCSK9 activity and defined the M1 + M2 domain as the CHRD binding region of PCSK9 to AnxA2. We further propose that cytosolic AnxA2 could inhibit the translation of PCSK9 mRNA and enhance the sorting of the endocytosed DiI-LDL·LDLR complex to lysosomes.
