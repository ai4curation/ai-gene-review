The activating NK cell receptor NKG2D binds to numerous stress-induced cell 
surface glycoproteins with MHC class I-related ectodomains. In humans, NKG2D 
ligands (NKG2DL) are members of the MHC-encoded MIC and non-MHC-encoded ULBP 
families of proteins. The redundancy of NKG2DL raises questions about unique 
features associated with individual NKG2DL. The ULBP family member RAET1G 
contains an ectodomain highly related to ULBP2, but is unique by virtue of an 
extended cytoplasmic domain. Since RAET1G is poorly characterized, we studied 
expression and functional interactions of RAET1G in comparison to ULBP2. RAET1G 
transcripts were detected in most human tissues with an overall expression 
pattern similar to ULBP2. However, although ULBP2 strongly binds both NKG2D and 
the immunoevasive human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein UL16, RAET1G only weakly 
interacts with NKG2D and does not bind UL16. Differential binding capacities of 
the two highly related ectodomains are mainly due to a substitution of a 
conserved amino acid in the alpha2 domain of RAET1G. In functional terms, the 
reduced apparent avidity of RAET1G for NKG2D results in a less-efficient NKG2D 
down-regulation and NK degranulation. Altogether, RAET1G, like ULBP2, appears 
broadly expressed, but exhibits a lower apparent avidity for NKG2D due to a 
mutation in the center of the MHC-like fold.
