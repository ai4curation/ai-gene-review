The circadian clock is a timekeeping mechanism that enables anticipation of 
daily environmental changes. In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the circadian 
system is a multiloop series of interlocked transcription-translation feedbacks. 
Several genes have been arranged in these oscillation loops, but the position of 
the core-clock gene ELF4 in this network was previously undetermined. ELF4 lacks 
sequence similarity to known domains, and functional homologs have not yet been 
identified. Here we show that ELF4 is functionally conserved within a subclade 
of related sequences, and forms an alpha-helical homodimer with a likely 
electrostatic interface that could be structurally modeled. We support this 
hypothesis by expression analysis of new elf4 hypomorphic alleles. These weak 
mutants were found to have expression level phenotypes of both morning and 
evening clock genes, implicating multiple entry points of ELF4 within the 
multiloop network. This could be mathematically modeled. Furthermore, 
morning-expression defects were particular to some elf4 alleles, suggesting 
predominant ELF4 action just preceding dawn. We provide a new hypothesis about 
ELF4 in the oscillator-it acts as a homodimer to integrate two arms of the 
circadian clock.
