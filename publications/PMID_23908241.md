Pathogens dramatically affect host cell transcription programs for their own 
profit during infection, but in most cases, the underlying mechanisms remain 
elusive. We found that during infection with the bacterium Listeria 
monocytogenes, the host deacetylase sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) translocates to the 
nucleus, in a manner dependent on the bacterial factor InlB. SIRT2 associates 
with the transcription start site of a subset of genes repressed during 
infection and deacetylates histone H3 on lysine 18 (H3K18). Infecting cells in 
which SIRT2 activity was blocked or using SIRT2(-/-) mice resulted in a 
significant impairment of bacterial infection. Thus, SIRT2-mediated H3K18 
deacetylation plays a critical role during infection, which reveals an 
epigenetic mechanism imposed by a pathogenic bacterium to reprogram its host.
