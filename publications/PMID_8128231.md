The gamma chain of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor is shared with the 
functional IL-4 receptor and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined 
immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect. Studies 
with monoclonal antibodies specific for the IL-2 receptor gamma chain showed 
that the gamma chain participates in the functional high-affinity receptor 
complexes for IL-7 that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells. 
Participation of the gamma subunit in more than one receptor may enable the 
elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte 
differentiation.
