The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) catalyse one of 
the most unusual membrane remodelling events in cell biology. ESCRT-I and 
ESCRT-II direct membrane budding away from the cytosol by stabilizing bud necks 
without coating the buds and without being consumed in the buds. ESCRT-III 
cleaves the bud necks from their cytosolic faces. ESCRT-III-mediated membrane 
neck cleavage is crucial for many processes, including the biogenesis of 
multivesicular bodies, viral budding, cytokinesis and, probably, autophagy. 
Recent studies of ultrastructures induced by ESCRT-III overexpression in cells 
and the in vitro reconstitution of the budding and scission reactions have led 
to breakthroughs in understanding these remarkable membrane reactions.

Abstract

The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) catalyze one of the most unusual membrane remodelling events in cell biology. ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II direct membrane budding away from the cytosol by stabilizing bud necks without coating the bud and without being consumed in the buds. ESCRT-III cleaves the bud necks from their cytosolic face. ESCRT-III-mediated membrane neck cleavage is crucial for many processes, including the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies, viral budding, cytokinesis, and probably autophagy. Recent studies of ultrastructures induced by ESCRT-III overexpression in cells and the in vitro reconstitution of the budding and scission reactions have led to breakthroughs in understanding these remarkable membrane reactions.

Conclusions

Understanding of membrane deformation and scission by the ESCRTs has made stunning advances over the past 2 years. We now know that the ESCRTs have an intrinsic budding and scission activity that is focused on the neck of the nascent bud. These mechanisms differ markedly from familiar mechanisms in vesicular trafficking that depend on outer coats and in viral budding, in which Gag proteins form inner coats. The biophysical underpinnings of these new mechanisms are just beginning to be worked out by computational and other methods. Many questions, such as how the ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II complexes assembles in three dimensions to drive membrane budding, remain open. The coupling between the ESCRT-I- ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III ( Fig. 5c ) depends on the interaction of ESCRT-II with the ESCRT-III protein Vps20, but the nature of the membrane-bound assembly of all of the ESCRTs remains to be fully explored. The determinants for ILV size in vivo are also uncertain. Membrane mechanical properties are undoubtedly a factor in controlling ILV size, but kinetic factors such as the rate of cargo addition and vesicle scission are likely to matter as well. More sophisticated reconstitution studies may help to address the relative roles of kinetic and equilibrium factors in regulating ILV size.

The new mechanistic information also provides the foundation for understanding the role of ESCRTs in detaching viral buds and cleaving cytokinetic membrane necks. Whether the ESCRTs have a similar direct neck closure reaction in autophagy, as opposed to an indirect role of some sort, will be an important question to resolve. The fundamental mechanisms of the ESCRTs have progressed from an almost complete mystery just 3 years ago to a reasonably complete outline today. Elucidating these mechanisms will help to uncover the details of coupling and regulation of ESCRT-mediated budding in normal physiology and disease.
