The conversion of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to phosphatidic acid is carried 
out by the microsomal enzymes 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate-O-acyltransferases 
(AGPATs). These enzymes are specific for acylating LPA at the sn-2 (carbon 2) 
position on the glycerol backbone and are important, because they provide 
substrates for the synthesis of phospholipids and triglycerides. At least, 
mutations in one isoform, AGPAT2, cause near complete loss of adipose tissue in 
humans. We cloned a cDNA predicted to be an AGPAT isoform, AGPAT11. This cDNA 
has been recently identified also as lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2 
(LPCAT2) and lyso platelet-activating factor acetyltransferase. When 
AGPAT11/LPCAT2/lyso platelet-activating factor acetyltransferase cDNA was 
expressed in CHO and HeLa cells, the protein product localized to the 
endoplasmic reticulum. In vitro enzymatic activity using lysates of Human 
Embryonic Kidney-293 cells infected with recombinant AGPAT11/LPCAT2/lyso 
platelet-activating factor-acetyltransferase cDNA adenovirus show that the 
protein has an AGPAT activity but lacks glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 
enzymatic activity. The AGPAT11 efficiently uses C18:1 LPA as acyl acceptor and 
C18:1 fatty acid as an acyl donor. Thus, it has similar substrate specificities 
for LPA and acyl-CoA as shown for AGPAT9 and 10. Expression of AGPAT11 mRNA was 
significantly upregulated in human breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer 
tissues, indicating its adjuvant role in the progression of these cancers. Our 
enzymatic assays strongly suggest that the cDNA previously identified as 
LPCAT2/lyso platelet-activating factor-acetyltransferase cDNA has AGPAT activity 
and thus we prefer to identify this clone as AGPAT11 as well.
