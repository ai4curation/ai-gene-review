CD36 is a versatile receptor known to play a central role in the development of 
atherosclerosis, the pathogenesis of malaria, and the removal of apoptotic 
cells. Remarkably, the short cytosolically exposed regions of CD36 lack 
identifiable motifs, which has hampered elucidation of its mode of signaling. 
Using a combination of phosphoprotein isolation, mass spectrometry, 
superresolution imaging, and gene silencing, we have determined that the 
receptor induces ligand internalization through a heteromeric complex consisting 
of CD36, β1 and/or β2 integrins, and the tetraspanins CD9 and/or CD81. This 
receptor complex serves to link CD36 to the adaptor FcRγ, which bears an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif. By coupling to FcRγ, CD36 is able to 
engage Src-family kinases and Syk, which in turn drives the internalization of 
CD36 and its bound ligands.

Introduction

CD36, a highly glycosylated transmembrane protein belonging to the class B scavenger receptor family, is expressed by several cell types such as adipocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, as well as endothelial and myeloid cells. It binds a broad range of endogenous ligands, including proteins like amyloid-β ( Coraci et al., 2002 ), collagen ( Tandon et al., 1989 ) and thrombospondin ( Asch et al., 1987 ), and lipids that include oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL; Endemann et al., 1993 ), intact and oxidized phosphatidylserine ( Rigotti et al., 1995 ; Greenberg et al., 2006 ) and long-chain fatty acids ( Abumrad et al., 1993 ). In addition, CD36 also recognizes exogenous proteins like the Plasmodium falciparum protein PfEMP1 ( Baruch et al., 1996 ), and lipids such as bacterial diacylglycerides ( Hoebe et al., 2005 ). By interacting with such ligands the scavenger receptor plays a critical role in the removal of apoptotic bodies and of Plasmodium -infected red blood cells ( McGilvray et al., 2000 ; Patel et al., 2004 ), and its association with thrombospondin is thought to have anti-metastatic effects ( Clezardin et al., 1993 ; Uray et al., 2004 ). However, not all of these interactions are beneficial: CD36 contributes to the retention of macrophages at atherosclerotic lesions and their subsequent conversion into foam cells ( Febbraio et al., 2000 ), contributes to macrophage apoptosis and to the sterile inflammation induced by oxLDL by interacting with toll-like receptors (TLR) 2, 4 and/or 6 ( Manning-Tobin et al. 2009 ; Seimon et al., 2010 ; Stewart et al., 2010 ), and is also implicated in the progression of Alzheimer’s dementia through its pro-inflammatory engagement of amyloid-β ( El Khoury et al., 2003 ; Coraci et al., 2002 ).

The ligands recognized by CD36 are generally multivalent and can therefore engage multiple receptors simultaneously. The resulting formation of CD36 clusters initiates signal transduction and internalization of receptor-ligand complexes. Remarkably, despite the broad biological importance of CD36, the signaling pathways that direct its internalization remain to be identified. Elucidation of the mode of action of the receptor has been stymied by the absence of discernible signaling motifs in its short intracellular domains ( Armesilla and Vega, 1994 ). Together with the varied chemical nature of its ligands and the heterogeneous cellular responses they elicit, this suggests that CD36 signals in conjunction with co-receptors or accessory molecules. Indeed, several proteins have been implicated as CD36 co-receptors, including toll-like receptors (TLR) 2, 4 and 6, as well as the α 3 β 1 and α v β 5 integrins ( Stewart et al., 2010 ; Calzada et al., 2004 ; Chang and Finnemann, 2007 ). The dependency on co-receptor signaling is strongly ligand-specific. For example, signaling via TLR4/6 and their downstream adaptors MyD88 and TRIF is required for pro-inflammatory cytokine production after engagement of oxLDL and fibrillar amyloid-β ( Stewart et al., 2010 ). In contrast, neither TLR receptors nor their downstream signaling components are required for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines following the CD36-dependent uptake of malaria-infected erythrocytes ( Erdman et al., 2009 ). Of note, none of the signaling pathways identified to date dictate the internalization of CD36, and instead seem to regulate downstream events such as gene transcription.

There is currently disagreement whether CD36 is internalized via caveolae ( Uittenbogaard et al., 2000 ; Ring et al., 2006 ; Truong et al., 2006 ), macropinocytosis ( Boyanovsky et al., 2009 ), clathrin-mediated endocytosis ( Shamsul et al., 2010 ) or an actin-dependent process distinct from macropinocytosis ( Collins et al., 2009 ). Recent evidence suggests that CD36 uptake requires Src-family kinases, Jnk and Rho-family GTPases, but the pathway(s) leading to their activation remain unclear. We used a combination of immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry and gene silencing or deletion to demonstrate that CD36 exists in heterogeneous membrane complexes containing β 1 and/or β 2 integrins, and the tetraspanins CD9 and CD81, and that these ancillary molecules bridge CD36 to the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM)-bearing adaptor FcRγ (FcER1G), which is required for the CD36-dependent activation of Syk. By coupling it to an ITAM adaptor, this complex allows CD36 to engage Src and Syk kinases, thus triggering the internalization of CD36 and its bound ligands.

Discussion

Our findings point to the existence of multimolecular complexes of transmembrane proteins that include CD36, integrins, tetraspanins and ITAM-bearing adaptors that enable the transmission of signals via Syk. These observations, together with earlier findings that CD36 can associate with and activate Src-family kinases ( Huang et al., 1991 ), provide a defined pathway whereby this receptor triggers internalization of important ligands like modified LDL that can result in foam-cell and atheroma formation. Earlier studies determined that the internalization of CD36 occurs through a pathway distinct from macropinocytosis and canonical endocytosis ( Collins et al., 2009 ). This unconventional internalization mechanism shares some similarities with the Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized particles, notably the requirement for Src-family kinases, Rho-family GTPases and actin polymerization ( Hackam et al., 1997 ; Coppolino et al., 2001 ; Hall et al., 2006 ). The current study has reinforced these similarities by identifying a role for Syk in the uptake of CD36, akin to that played by this tyrosine kinase during phagocytosis ( Kiefer et al., 1998 ). Phosphorylation of the scaffold proteins Fyb and LCP2 ( Coppolino et al., 2001 ) is also a common consequence of the activation of CD36 and Fcγ receptors. The identification of these adaptor molecules is of particular interest, as they provide a possible link between Src/Syk activation, integrin signaling, actin reorganization and Jnk signaling ( Mizuno et al., 2005 ; Wang et al., 2009 ; Barda-Saad et al., 2010 ) – all processes known to be critical for the uptake of CD36. Lipid-signaling enzymes known to regulate phagocytosis were also identified in our screen, notably PLC 2 –which is known to be activated by Src-family kinases during phagocytosis ( Makranz et al., 2004 ; Palmbos et al., 2002 ) – and SHIP1, a negative regulator of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5- tris phosphate signaling, which regulates Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Of note, SHIP1 can be recruited to integrins by DOK1 ( Horan et al., 2007 ; Sattler et al., 2001 ), which was also identified in our mass spectrometry screen ( Table 1 ).

CD36 is a receptor for a broad range of ligands, which can be of proteinacious (thrombospondin, fibronectin, collectin, amyloid-β, PfEMP1) or lipidic nature (oxLDL, oxidized phospholipids, bacterial diacylglycerides). Remarkably, the cellular responses to these ligands vary, ranging from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory ( Stewart et al., 2010 ; Chung et al., 2007 ; Girkontaite et al., 2007 ). The recognition of such a broad spectrum of ligands, and the diversity of the resultant cellular responses, suggests the existence of multiple types of co-receptors that confer to the complexes distinct ligand-identification and signaling properties. Indeed, previous studies have identified several ligand-specific CD36 complexes: interaction of TLR4 or TLR6 with CD36 is required for pro-inflammatory signaling in response to amyloid-β or oxLDL ( Stewart et al., 2010 ); by contrast the recognition of P. falciparum PfEMP1 by CD36 is independent of TLR receptors and their downstream signaling components ( Baruch et al., 1996 ; Erdman et al., 2009 ). Integrin-containing complexes have also been reported; recognition of apoptotic retinal pigment epithelial cells appears to require association of CD36 with CD81 and α v β 5 integrin ( Chang and Finnemann, 2007 ), and thrombospondin is bound by α 3 β 1 integrin in conjunction with CD36 ( Krutzsch et al., 1999 ; Li et al., 1993 ).

The ability of CD36 to signal the uptake of oxLDL in macrophages is similarly dependent on its association with other transmembrane proteins. Huang et al. (2011) reported that CD9 not only associates with CD36 in murine macrophages, but is partially required for the internalization of oxLDL and the formation of foam cells. Our findings extend these observations, indicating that another tetraspanin, CD81, is also associated with CD36 and required for its optimal function, as are β 1 and β 2 integrins. Our data also suggest that the tetraspanins mediate the association between CD36 and the integrins, and that different tetraspanins may function in the formation of distinct, possibly ligand-specific CD36 receptor complexes.

It is unlikely that CD36 and all of these co-receptors exist in a single, stable molecular entity. Instead, it seems more probable that CD36 is part of several distinct signalosomes, which need not be stable over time. Some of these may be cell-type specific, but the evidence collected here and elsewhere suggests that significant heterogeneity exists in the membrane of individual macrophages and likely other cells as well. Further evidence of heterogeneity comes from our studies of endocytosis. Pharmacological inhibition or knockout/knockdown of Src, Syk or FcRγ all had partial inhibitory effects on CD36 internalization, implying that in every instance studied at least one additional internalization pathway must exist. One potential route is the caveolae-dependent pathway used by TLR receptors ( Shuto et al., 2005 ). This would be consistent with studies demonstrating that caveolin-1 is required for CD36-dependent signaling under some conditions ( Tsai et al., 2011 ; Ring et al., 2006 ).

While the exact nature of the CD36 complexes remains to be defined, the salient feature of our findings is the presence of ITAM-containing adaptors in a significant fraction of these. We envisage FcRγ to be attached to the signaling complex via the tetraspanins CD9 and CD81, which also link to integrins that can serve as co-receptors. This assembly enables certain CD36 ligands to signal via Syk and its downstream effectors, which in other systems can promote actin remodeling. Other CD36 complexes, such as those involving TLR receptors, may use different means of signaling and internalization pathways. The co-existence of heterogeneous signalosomes would in this manner explain the multiplicity of entry routes and the ability to trigger either inflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses, depending on the nature of the ligand.
