Synovial joints enable smooth articulations between different skeletal elements 
and are essential for the motility of vertebrates. Despite decades of extensive 
studies of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of limb and skeletal 
development, the molecular mechanisms governing synovial joint formation are 
still poorly understood. In particular, whereas several signaling pathways have 
been shown to play critical roles in joint maintenance, the mechanism 
controlling joint initiation is unknown. Here we report that Osr1 and Osr2, the 
mammalian homologs of the odd-skipped family of zinc finger transcription 
factors that are required for leg joint formation in Drosophila, are both 
strongly expressed in the developing synovial joint cells in mice. Whereas 
Osr1(-/-) mutant mice died at midgestation and Osr2(-/-) mutant mice had only 
subtle defects in synovial joint development, tissue-specific inactivation of 
Osr1 in the developing limb mesenchyme in Osr2(-/-) mutant mice caused fusion of 
multiple joints. We found that Osr1 and Osr2 function is required for 
maintenance of expression of signaling molecules critical for joint formation, 
including Gdf5, Wnt4 and Wnt9b. In addition, joint cells in the double mutants 
failed to upregulate expression of the articular cartilage marker gene Prg4. 
These data indicate that Osr1 and Osr2 function redundantly to control synovial 
joint formation.

Abstract

Synovial joints enable smooth articulations between different skeletal elements and are essential for the motility of vertebrates. Despite decades of extensive studies of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of limb and skeletal development, the molecular mechanisms governing synovial joint formation are still poorly understood. In particular, whereas several signaling pathways have been shown to play critical roles in joint maintenance, the mechanism controlling joint initiation is unknown. Here we report that Osr1 and Osr2, the mammalian homologs of the odd-skipped family of zinc finger transcription factors that are required for leg joint formation in Drosophila , are both strongly expressed in the developing synovial joint cells in mice. Whereas Osr1 −/− mutant mice died at midgestation and Osr2 −/− mutant mice had only subtle defects in synovial joint development, tissue-specific inactivation of Osr1 in the developing limb mesenchyme in Osr2 −/− mutant mice caused fusion of multiple joints. We found that Osr1 and Osr2 function is required for maintenance of expression of signaling molecules critical for joint formation, including Gdf5, Wnt4 and Wnt9b. In addition, joint cells in the double mutants failed to upregulate expression of the articular cartilage marker gene Prg4 . These data indicate that Osr1 and Osr2 function redundantly to control synovial joint formation.

Introduction

The successful adaptation of vertebrate animals to a wide variety of ecological niches depended largely on the formation and function of synovial joints. Synovial joints facilitate smooth articulation between two or more skeletal elements and thus play essential roles in vertebrate movement. The tissues that make up the synovial joint include articular cartilages of the opposing skeletal elements, ligaments, synovium, and the fibrous capsule. These tissues are prone to injury and malfunction during natural aging, resulting in impaired mobility. Moreover, synovial joints are often targets of diseases, such as osteoarthritis and inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis, which are the most common causes of disability in the adult human population ( Elders, 2000 ). Despite the obvious importance of synovial joints, however, there is currently very limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms of joint development.

During embryogenesis, the limb skeleton initiates by condensation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells to form cartilage, which further undergoes endochondrial ossification to form bone. The various long bones of the limb do not initiate as discrete individual elements, but rather initially form as continuous condensed mesenchyme that is subsequently divided into distinct elements by segmentation. For example, the humerus, radius and ulna rudiments initially form as an uninterrupted Y-shaped prechondrogenic mesenchymal condensation marked by high levels of expression of Type II collagen (Col2) ( Hinchliffe and Johnson, 1980 ; Craig et al., 1987 ; Lizarraga et al., 2002 ). The first overt sign of joint development is the appearance of the so-called interzone, consisting of densely packed flattened mesenchymal cells that provide a clear demarcation between the adjacent cartilaginous elements ( Holder, 1977 ; Mitrovic, 1978 ; Pacifici et al., 2005 ). It has been proposed that initiation of joint formation involves inhibition of the interzone progenitor cells from differentiating into chondrocytes by downregulating or blocking Col2 expression (Lizzarraga et al., 2002; Später et al., 2006 ; Pitsillides and Ashhurst, 2008 ).

One of the earliest markers of joint interzone cells identified is Gdf5, a member of the TGF-β family of signaling molecules. Mice lacking Gdf5 exhibited multiple joint fusions, particularly involving interphalangeal joints and the carpal or tarsal bones ( Storm et al., 1994 , 1996 ). Joint defects are also associated with mutations in GDF5 in humans ( Francis-West et al., 1999b ; Buxton et al., 2001 ). Genetic lineage tracing studies showed that the Gdf5 -expressing interzone cells gave rise to most joint tissues including articular cartilage but contributed little to the growth plate cartilage ( Koyama et al. 2008 ). However, application of exogenous Gdf5 protein to the developing chick or mouse limb mesenchyme stimulated cartilage development ( Storm and Kingsley, 1999 ), indicating that Gdf5 signaling does not specify joint cell fate and that cellular responses to Gdf5 signaling may be cell-type specific. Joint development failed to initiate in mice lacking Noggin, a secreted BMP antagonist ( Brunet et al., 1998 ). Noggin mRNA is expressed throughout the prechondrogenic mesenchymal condensation, in both the cartilage anlagen and the presumptive joint cells. In addition to lacking joints, the Noggin −/− mutant mice exhibited gross skeletal hyperplasia, suggesting that failure of joint formation in these mutant mice was due to increased recruitment of the prechondrogenic limb mesenchyme into cartilage formation ( Brunet et al., 1998 ). Indeed, implantation of agarose beads soaked with Bmp2 or Bmp4 adjacent to developing chick digital joints caused partial joint fusion ( Archer et al., 2003 ).

Another signaling pathway that plays critical roles in joint development is the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Hartmann and Tabin (2001) showed that Wnt9a (formerly Wnt14 ) mRNA was expressed early during interzone formation in the developing chick limb and that misexpression of Wnt9a induced ectopic expression of several interzone cell molecular markers including Gdf5 and Chordin . Moreover, Wnt9a misexpression in primary chick sternal chondrocytes caused downregulation of Col2 and upregulation of Col3 ( Später et al., 2006 ), mimicking the molecular events during interzone formation. Expression of either Wnt9a or a constitutively active form of β-catenin driven by the Col2a1 gene promoter in transgenic mice also caused ectopic expression of joint cell markers in the developing limbs ( Guo et al., 2004 ). However, targeted disruption of Wnt9a did not affect joint induction but resulted in synovial chondroid metaplasia in some joints ( Später et al., 2006 ). Although the Wnt4 −/− Wnt9a −/− double mutant newborn mice showed fusion of some carpal and tarsal elements, the fusion occurred after initiation of the joint interzones. Moreover, tissue-specific inactivation of β-catenin in the early developing limb mesenchyme did not block joint interzone formation ( Später et al., 2006 ), indicating that other mechanisms are involved in joint specification.

Previous studies have shown, in addition to the selected signaling molecules of the Gdf and Wnt families, that several transcription factor genes, including Cux1 , Erg , Osr1 and Osr2 , are also expressed in highly restricted patterns during synovial joint formation ( Dhordain et al., 1995 ; Lizarraga et al., 2002 ; Stricker et al., 2006 ; Iwamoto et al., 2007 ; Koyama et al., 2008 ). Cux1, encoding a large homeodomain-containing DNA-binding protein, is highly expressed at sites of incipient joint formation during limb development in chick ( Lizarraga et al., 2002 ). Misexpression of Cux1 mRNA suppressed chondrocyte differentiation in limb mesenchyme cultures. However, overexpression of Cux1 did not induce expression of known joint markers and mice deficient in Cux1 did not have limb developmental defects ( Lizarraga et al., 2002 ; Ellis et al., 2001 ). Thus, the role of Cux1 in joint development is unclear. Erg , encoding a member of the Ets family of transcription factors (Sharrocks, 2001), is co-expressed with Gdf5 in the incipient joint cells during mouse limb development and exogenous Gdf5 protein induced Erg mRNA expression in the developing limb mesenchyme ( Iwamoto et al., 2007 ). Transgenic mice overexpressing Erg mRNAs throughout the cartilaginous skeleton did not induce ectopic joint formation but rather blocked chondrocyte maturation toward hypertrophy, suggesting that Erg may be an important factor downstream of Gdf5 in the differentiation and maintenance of articular cartilage ( Iwamoto et al., 2007 ). Osr1 and Osr2 are the vertebrate homologs of the Drosophila odd-skipped family of zinc finger proteins ( So and Danielian, 1999 ; Lan et al., 2001 ; Gao et al., 2009 ). In Drosophila , all four odd-skipped family genes, odd, sob, drm, and bowl, are expressed in a segmental pattern in the developing leg imaginal discs. Ectopic expression of odd, sob , or drm, induced invaginations in the leg disc epithelium and morphological changes in the adult leg that are characteristic of joint cells ( Hao et al., 2003 ). Osr1 and Osr2 mRNAs exhibit partially overlapping expression in the early limb bud and both are expressed at high levels in the incipient joints during limb development in chick and in mice ( Stricker et al., 2006 ), suggesting that this family of transcription factors may be involved in joint cell fate specification in vertebrates as well. Since most mouse embryos lacking Osr1 died in midgestation ( Wang et al., 2005 ), we have generated mice with limb-specific inactivation of Osr1 and demonstrate in this report that Osr1 and Osr2 function partially redundantly to control synovial joint formation in mice.

Discussion

Initiation of joint formation in the developing vertebrate limb involves both specification of the joint cell fate and suppression of the cartilage molecular program in the joint progenitor cells. Whereas recent studies have identified several signaling molecules that are specifically expressed in the presumptive joint cells (reviewed by Archer et al., 2003 ; Pacifici et al., 2005 ), little is known about the transcription factors controlling joint formation. In this report, we show that expression of the Osr1 and Osr2 genes are both activated in the presumptive joint cells at the onset of joint initiation and that they play critical roles in regulating synovial joint formation.

Osr1 and Osr2 were initially identified as mammalian homologs of the Drosophila odd-skipped family zinc finger transcription factors ( Lan et al, 2001 ; So and Danielian, 1999 ). The odd-skipped family in Drosophila consists of four distinct genes, odd , bowl , sob , and drm ( Coulter et al., 1990 ; Green et al., 2002 ; Hart et al., 1996 ; Wang and Coulter, 1996 ). Odd encodes a protein containing four C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, whereas bowl and sob each encode a protein containing five zinc finger motifs highly homologous to ODD. In contrast, drm encodes a small protein containing only two zinc finger motifs, of which only the first finger conforms to the canonical C2H2 sequence and shows high sequence identity to the first zinc finger in the other Odd-skipped family proteins ( Green et al., 2002 ). Mutations in odd , bowl , and drm each resulted in distinct developmental defects ( Coulter et al., 1990 ; Green et al., 2002 ; Wang and Coulter, 1996 ). Interestingly, although there is significantly more extensive amino acid sequence identity between ODD and BOWL than that between ODD and DRM proteins, ectopic expression of bowl almost always resulted in different phenotypes from that of expression of odd under the same conditions, whereas ectopic expression of odd and drm in the same tissues often resulted in similar developmental defects ( Green et al., 2002 ; Hao et al., 2003 ; de Celis Ibeas and Bray, 2003 ; Hatini et al., 2005 ; Bras-Pereira et al., 2006 ). These data suggested that the odd-skipped family transcription factors in Drosophila have largely distinct biochemical functions in vivo that are most likely due to functional domains outside of the zinc finger motifs. In contrast to the Drosophila odd-skipped family, Osr1 and Osr2 are the only members of this family in mammals and they share extensive amino acid sequence identity with each throughout the length of the protein products ( Lan et al., 2001 ). Although targeted null mutations in Osr1 and Osr2 in mice resulted in distinct phenotypes, with heart and urogenital defects in Osr1 −/− mice and with cleft palate and open-eyelids in Osr2 −/− mice, respectively, ( Lan et al., 2004 ; Wang et al., 2005 ), we recently demonstrated that expression of Osr1 from the Osr2 locus through targeted gene replacement rescued the craniofacial developmental defects in the Osr2 −/− mice ( Gao et al., 2009 ). Thus, we hypothesized that the distinct phenotypes of the Osr1 −/− and Osr2 −/− mutant mice are most likely due to the distinct developmental expression patterns of these two genes. In this study, we found that expression of both Osr1 and Osr2 are activated in most presumptive joint cells and persist throughout joint development in the developing limbs except that Osr2 , but not Osr1 , is highly expressed in the joint cells in between several tarsal elements in the ankle region. The corresponding tarsal elements were fused in the Osr2 −/− mice whereas all other limb joints developed apparently normally in either the Osr2 −/− mice or the Osr1 f/f Prrx1-cre mice. However, multiple joints failed to form properly in the Osr1 f/f Osr2 −/− Prrx1-cre mice. These data confirm that Osr1 and Osr2 function redundantly in the tissues where they are co-expressed during mouse development. The overlapping expression of Osr1 and Osr2 in most developing joints ensures proper development and function of the major synovial joints.

Joint fusion phenotypes partially overlapping with that observed in the Osr1 f/f Osr2 −/− Prrx1-cre mutant mice have been reported in mice lacking Gdf5 , Gdf6 , or both Wnt9a and Wnt4 ( Settle Jr. et al., 2003 ; Storm and Kingsley, 1996 ; 1999 ; Storm et al., 1994 ). Gdf5 −/− , Gdf6 −/− , Gdf5 −/− Gdf6 −/− , and Wnt9a −/− Wnt4 −/− mutant mice all displayed fusion of the carpal and tarsal elements in the wrist and ankle regions, respectively, but they did not have fusion of the long bone elements at the elbow or knee joints as observed in the Osr1 f/f Osr2 −/− Prrx1-cre mutant mice. Expression of Gdf5 , Wnt4 , and Wnt9a were all detected in the presumptive joint or peri-joint cells at the onset of joint initiation in the Osr1 f/f Osr2 −/− Prrx1-cre mutant embryos, indicating that Osr1 and Osr2 are not required for the specification of the joint progenitor cells or for activating expression of these signaling molecules. However, in the absence of Osr1 and Osr2, most of the interzone cells continued to express high levels of Col2 mRNA, suggesting that Osr1/Osr2 function is required for the interzone cells to fully commit to the joint fate. Interestingly, while Gdf5 expression in the joint progenitor cells and Wnt4 expression in the peri-joint cells were downregulated in the Osr1 f/f Osr2 −/− Prrx1-cre mutant elbow region, a subset of cells in the humerus-ulna joint region maintained Wnt9a mRNA expression ( Fig. 5D ). Nevertheless, even in the region of the humerus-ulna joint where expression of Wnt9a persisted in the Osr1 f/f Osr2 −/− Prrx1-cre mutant embryos, those cells failed to upregulate the articular cartilage marker Prg4 ( Fig. 7B ), suggesting that Osr1/Osr2 plays a critical role in joint cell differentiation. The persistence of Wnt9a expression in some joint progenitor cells in the Osr1 f/f Osr2 −/− Prrx1-cre mutant embryos, together with our data showing normal expression of Osr1 and Osr2 in the Catnb f/f ;Osr2 IresCre/+ mutant embryos, suggests that Osr1/2 function in parallel with the Wnt9a signaling pathway during joint interzone formation. On the other hand, the downregulation of Wnt4 in the peri-joint cells in the Osr1 f/f Osr2 −/− Prrx1-cre mutant embryos suggests that Osr1/2 may be involved in the maintenance of the peri-joint cells and indirectly modulate the Wnt signaling pathway during joint formation. The differences in severity of the phenotype in the different joints may be due to differences in spatiotemporal activation of other molecular pathways, such as the Wnt pathway, during joint development.

Multiple joint fusions, including fusion of the humerus with the ulna and the radius at the elbow region , have also been reported in mice lacking either Noggin or Zeb1 ( Brunet et al., 1998 ; Takagi et al., 1998 ). Noggin −/− mutant embryos had excessive cartilage formation at the expense of the residual limb mesenchyme, suggesting that the failure of joint formation in this mutant mouse strain resulted from increased chondrogenesis of the limb mesenchyme due to elevated Bmp signaling ( Brunet et al., 1998 ). The Zeb1 protein, containing homeodomain and zinc finger domains, has been shown to interact with Smad proteins and to modulate TGFβ signaling ( Postigo, 2003 ; Nishimura et al., 2006 ). Interestingly, we recently found that Bmp4 expression was enhanced and expanded in the developing tooth mesenchyme in the Osr2 −/− mutant mice ( Zhang et al., 2009 ). One possibility is that Osr1 and Osr2 may function to modulate the activity of the Bmp or TGFβ signaling pathway in the joint progenitor cells. Identification of direct downstream target genes of Osr1 and Osr2 and elucidation of the molecular interactions involving these and other factors in the joint progenitor cells will provide new insights into the molecule mechanisms of joint development.
