The human transferrin receptor (TfR) is shed by an integral metalloprotease 
releasing a soluble form (sTfR) into serum. The sTfR reflects the iron demand of 
the body and is postulated as a regulator of iron homeostasis via binding to the 
hereditary hemochromatosis protein HFE. To study the role of transferrin in this 
process, we investigated TfR shedding in HL60 cells and TfR-deficient Chinese 
hamster ovary cells transfected with human TfR. Independent of TfR expression, 
sTfR release decreases with increasing ferritransferrin concentrations, whereas 
apo-transferrin exhibits no inhibitory effect. To investigate the underlying 
mechanism, we generated several TfR mutants with different binding affinities 
for transferrin. Shedding of TfR mutants in transfected cells correlates exactly 
with their binding affinity, implying that the effect of ferritransferrin on TfR 
shedding is mediated by a direct molecular interaction. Analysis of sTfR release 
from purified microsomal membranes revealed that the regulation is independent 
from intracellular trafficking or cellular signaling events. Our results clearly 
demonstrated that sTfR does not only reflect the iron demand of the cells but 
also the iron availability in the bloodstream, mirrored by iron saturation of 
transferrin, corroborating the important potential function of sTfR as a 
regulator of iron homeostasis.
