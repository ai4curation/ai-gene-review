Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) is required for axon guidance and 
dendrite arborization. How DSCAM functions in vertebrates is not well 
understood. Here we show that DSCAM is expressed on commissural axons and 
interacts with Netrin-1, a prototypical guidance cue for commissural axons. The 
knockdown of DSCAM by specific siRNA or blockage of DSCAM signaling by 
overexpression of a mutant lacking its intracellular domain inhibits 
netrin-induced axon outgrowth and commissural axon turning in vitro. 
SiRNA-mediated knockdown of DSCAM in ovo causes defects in commissural axon 
projection and pathfinding. In transfected cells, DSCAM by itself, in the 
absence of DCC, is capable of mediating netrin signaling in activating 
phosphorylation of Fyn and Pak1. These findings demonstrate an essential role of 
vertebrate DSCAM in axon guidance, indicating that DSCAM functions as a receptor 
of netrin-1. Our data suggest previously unexpected complexity in receptors that 
mediate vertebrate netrin signaling.
