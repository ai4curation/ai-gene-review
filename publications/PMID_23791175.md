The ability to ensure proteostasis is critical for maintaining proper cell 
function and organismal viability but is mitigated by aging. We analyzed the 
role of the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR(ER)) in aging 
of C. elegans and found that age-onset loss of ER proteostasis could be reversed 
by expression of a constitutively active form of XBP-1, XBP-1s. Neuronally 
derived XBP-1s was sufficient to rescue stress resistance, increase longevity, 
and activate the UPR(ER) in distal, non-neuronal cell types through a 
cell-nonautonomous mechanism. Loss of UPR(ER) signaling components in distal 
cells blocked cell-nonautonomous signaling from the nervous system, thereby 
blocking increased longevity of the entire animal. Reduction of small clear 
vesicle (SCV) release blocked nonautonomous signaling downstream of xbp-1s, 
suggesting that the release of neurotransmitters is required for this 
intertissue signaling event. Our findings point toward a secreted ER stress 
signal (SERSS) that promotes ER stress resistance and longevity.
