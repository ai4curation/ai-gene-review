Defects in ubiquitin E3 ligases are implicated in the pathogenesis of several 
human diseases, including cancer, because of their central role in the control 
of diverse signaling pathways. RING E3 ligases promote the ubiquitination of 
proteins that are essential to a variety of cellular events. Identification of 
which ubiquitin ligases specifically affect distinct cellular processes is 
essential to the development of targeted therapeutics for these diseases. Here 
we discuss two novel RING E3 ligases, BCA2 and RNF11, that are closely linked to 
human breast cancer. BCA2 E3 ligase is coregulated with estrogen receptor and 
plays a role in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) 
trafficking. RNF11 is a small RING E3 ligase that affects transforming growth 
factorbeta and EGF-R signaling and is overexpressed in invasive breast cancers. 
These two proteins demonstrate the complexity of RING E3 ligase interactions in 
breast cancer and are potential targets for therapeutic interventions.
