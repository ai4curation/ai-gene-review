Intestinal epithelial cells are exposed to both innocuous and pathogenic 
microbes, which need to be distinguished to mount an effective immune response. 
To understand the mechanisms underlying pathogen recognition, we investigated 
how Pseudomonas aeruginosa triggers intestinal innate immunity in Caenorhabditis 
elegans, a process independent of Toll-like pattern recognition receptors. We 
show that the P. aeruginosa translational inhibitor Exotoxin A (ToxA), which 
ribosylates elongation factor 2 (EF2), upregulates a significant subset of genes 
normally induced by P. aeruginosa. Moreover, immune pathways involving the ATF-7 
and ZIP-2 transcription factors, which protect C. elegans from P. aeruginosa, 
are required for preventing ToxA-mediated lethality. ToxA-responsive genes are 
not induced by enzymatically inactive ToxA protein but can be upregulated 
independently of ToxA by disruption of host protein translation. Thus, 
C. elegans has a surveillance mechanism to recognize ToxA through its effect on 
protein translation rather than by direct recognition of either ToxA or 
ribosylated EF2.
