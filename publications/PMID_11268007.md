Heat shock, or stress, proteins (HSPs) are induced in response to conditions 
that cause protein denaturation. Activation of cellular stress responses as a 
protective and survival mechanism is often associated with chemical exposure. 
One interface between the body and the external environment and chemical or 
biological agents therein is the olfactory epithelium (OE). To determine whether 
environmental odorants affect OE HSP expression, rats were exposed to a variety 
of odorants added to the cage bedding. Odorant exposure led to transient, 
selective induction of HSP70, HSC70, HSP25, and ubiquitin immunoreactivities 
(IRs) in supporting cells and subepithelial Bowman's gland acinar cells, two OE 
non-neuronal cell populations involved with inhalant biotransformation, 
detoxification, and maintenance of overall OE integrity. Responses exhibited 
odor specificity and dose dependency. HSP70 and HSC70 IRs occurred throughout 
the apical region of supporting cells; ubiquitin IR was confined to a 
supranuclear cone-shaped region. Electron microscopic examination confirmed 
these observations and, additionally, revealed odor-induced formation of dense 
vesicular arrays in the cone-like regions. HSP25 IR occurred throughout the 
entire supporting cell cytoplasm. In contrast to classical stress responses, in 
which the entire array of stress proteins is induced, no increases in HSP40 and 
HSP90 IRs were observed. Extended exposure to higher odorant doses caused 
prolonged activation of the same HSP subset in the non-neuronal cells and severe 
morphological damage in both supporting cells and olfactory receptor neurons 
(ORNs), suggesting that non-neuronal cytoprotective stress response mechanisms 
had been overwhelmed and could no longer adequately maintain OE integrity. 
Significantly, ORNs showed no stress responses in any of our studies. These 
findings suggest a novel role for these HSPs in olfaction and, in turn, possible 
involvement in other normal neurophysiological processes.
