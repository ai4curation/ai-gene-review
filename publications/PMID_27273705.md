Voltage-gated calcium channels are essential players in many physiological 
processes in excitable cells. There are three main subdivisions of calcium 
channel, defined by the pore-forming α1 subunit, the CaV 1, CaV 2 and CaV 3 
channels. For all the subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channel, their gating 
properties are key for the precise control of neurotransmitter release, muscle 
contraction and cell excitability, among many other processes. For the CaV 1 and 
CaV 2 channels, their ability to reach their required destinations in the cell 
membrane, their activation and the fine tuning of their biophysical properties 
are all dramatically influenced by the auxiliary subunits that associate with 
them. Furthermore, there are many diseases, both genetic and acquired, involving 
voltage-gated calcium channels. This review will provide a general introduction 
and then concentrate particularly on the role of auxiliary α2 δ subunits in both 
physiological and pathological processes involving calcium channels, and as a 
therapeutic target.
