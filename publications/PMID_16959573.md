Sir2 is an NAD-dependent deacetylase that connects metabolism with longevity in 
yeast, flies, and worms. Mammals have seven Sir2 homologs (SIRT1-7). We show 
that SIRT4 is a mitochondrial enzyme that uses NAD to ADP-ribosylate and 
downregulate glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity. GDH is known to promote the 
metabolism of glutamate and glutamine, generating ATP, which promotes insulin 
secretion. Loss of SIRT4 in insulinoma cells activates GDH, thereby upregulating 
amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion. A similar effect is observed in 
pancreatic beta cells from mice deficient in SIRT4 or on the dietary regimen of 
calorie restriction (CR). Furthermore, GDH from SIRT4-deficient or CR mice is 
insensitive to phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that cleaves ADP-ribose, suggesting 
the absence of ADP-ribosylation. These results indicate that SIRT4 functions in 
beta cell mitochondria to repress the activity of GDH by ADP-ribosylation, 
thereby downregulating insulin secretion in response to amino acids, effects 
that are alleviated during CR.
