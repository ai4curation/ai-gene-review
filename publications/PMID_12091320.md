PTEN is a tumour suppressor gene involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis and 
mediation of adhesion and migration signalling. Germline mutations of PTEN in 
humans are associated with familial tumour syndromes, among them Cowden disease. 
Glioblastomas, highly malignant glial tumours of the central nervous system 
frequently show loss of PTEN. Recent reports have outlined some aspects of PTEN 
function in central nervous system development. Using a conditional gene 
disruption approach, we inactivated Pten in mice early during embryogenesis 
locally in a region specific fashion and later during postnatal development in a 
cell-specific manner, to study the role of PTEN in differentiation, migration 
and neoplastic transformation. We show that PTEN is required for the realisation 
of normal cerebellar architecture, for regulation of cell and organ size, and 
for proper neuronal and glial migration. However, PTEN is not required for cell 
differentiation and lack of PTEN is not sufficient to induce neoplastic 
transformation of neuronal or glial cells
