One of the key pathways for DNA double-stranded break (DSB) repair is the 
non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, which directly re-ligates two broken 
ends of DNA. Using a plasmid repair assay screen, we identified that the 
deletion strain for RTT109 had a reduced efficiency for NHEJ in yeast. This 
deletion strain also had a reduced efficiency to repair induced chromosomal DSBs 
in vivo. Tandem-affinity purification of Rtt109 recovered Vps75 as a physical 
interacting protein. Deletion of VPS75 was also shown to have an effect on the 
efficiency of NHEJ in both the plasmid repair and the chromosomal repair assays. 
In addition, deletion mutants for both RTT109 and VPS75 showed hypersensitivity 
to different DNA damaging agents. Our genetic interaction analysis supports a 
role for RTT109 in DNA damage repair. We propose that one function of the 
Rtt109-Vps75 interacting protein pair is to affect the efficiency of NHEJ in 
yeast. Vps75 but not Rtt109 also seem to have an effect on the efficiency of DSB 
repair using homologous recombination.
