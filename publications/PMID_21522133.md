Aging is a multifactorial process that affects most of the biological functions 
of the organism and increases susceptibility to disease and death. Recent 
studies with animal models of accelerated aging have unveiled some mechanisms 
that also operate in physiological aging. However, little is known about the 
role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in this process. To address this question, we have 
analysed miRNA levels in Zmpste24-deficient mice, a model of Hutchinson-Gilford 
progeria syndrome. We have found that expression of the miR-29 family of miRNAs 
is markedly upregulated in Zmpste24(-/-) progeroid mice as well as during normal 
aging in mouse. Functional analysis revealed that this transcriptional 
activation of miR-29 is triggered in response to DNA damage and occurs in a 
p53-dependent manner since p53(-/-) murine fibroblasts do not increase miR-29 
expression upon doxorubicin treatment. We have also found that miR-29 represses 
Ppm1d phosphatase, which in turn enhances p53 activity. Based on these results, 
we propose the existence of a novel regulatory circuitry involving miR-29, Ppm1d 
and p53, which is activated in aging and in response to DNA damage.

Abstract

Aging is a multifactorial process that affects most of the biological functions of the organism and increases susceptibility to disease and death. Recent studies with animal models of accelerated aging have unveiled some mechanisms that also operate in physiological aging. However, little is known about the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in this process. To address this question, we have analysed miRNA levels in Zmpste24 -deficient mice, a model of Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome. We have found that expression of the miR-29 family of miRNAs is markedly upregulated in Zmpste24 −/− progeroid mice as well as during normal aging in mouse. Functional analysis revealed that this transcriptional activation of miR-29 is triggered in response to DNA damage and occurs in a p53-dependent manner since p53 −/− murine fibroblasts do not increase miR-29 expression upon doxorubicin treatment. We have also found that miR-29 represses Ppm1d phosphatase, which in turn enhances p53 activity. Based on these results, we propose the existence of a novel regulatory circuitry involving miR-29, Ppm1d and p53, which is activated in aging and in response to DNA damage.

Introduction

Aging is a complex process that progressively compromises most of the biological functions of the organism, resulting in an increased susceptibility to disease and death. Although a considerable effort has been made to unveil the causes of aging, there is no consensus theory to completely explain this process ( Vijg and Campisi, 2008 ). Nevertheless, there is some agreement that a common feature of aging is the progressive accumulation of cellular damage. Several stressors have been proposed to contribute to this cell damage, such as oxidative reactions, telomere attrition, or the decline of DNA repair and protein turnover systems ( Kirkwood, 2005 ). Evidence for the association of DNA damage with aging is supported by the identification of gene mutations that lead to an accelerated development of many age-related features. Most of these mutations were originally found in genes encoding proteins directly implicated in DNA repair ( Hoeijmakers, 2009 ), but recent studies have revealed that alterations in other processes that affect genomic integrity, such as nuclear envelope formation and dynamics, are also responsible for the development of premature aging syndromes ( Hasty et al, 2003 ; Cadinanos et al, 2005 ; Broers et al, 2006 ). Thus, mice with mutations in lamin A or deficient in the Zmpste24 metalloprotease involved in its maturation, display multiple features of premature aging ( Osorio et al, 2009 ). This phenotype is associated with an increased genomic instability as a consequence of the nuclear envelope network disruption and is supported by the transcriptional upregulation of p53 target genes and the decline in the function of somatic stem cells ( Pendas et al, 2002 ; Varela et al, 2005 ; Espada et al, 2008 ). On this basis, it has been proposed that the same mechanisms that detect damage and protect cells from malignant transformation may have a deleterious effect in aged tissues, thereby providing a good example of the principle of antagonistic pleiotropy ( Campisi, 2005 ; Kirkwood, 2005 ).

Over the last decade, miRNAs have emerged as new and fundamental actors in the gene regulation scenario. These ∼21–24 nucleotide RNA molecules are able to bind to specific sites typically present in the 3′-UTR region of their target genes and mediate either mRNA decay or translational blockade ( Flynt and Lai, 2008 ). Although the function of only a small percentage of the identified miRNAs is known, computational predictions have estimated that at least 20–30% of transcripts are susceptible to miRNA-mediated regulation ( Lewis et al, 2005 ). miRNAs were initially associated with development regulation, but numerous studies have revealed that these small RNA molecules have essential roles in a wide variety of physiological and cellular processes ( Bushati and Cohen, 2007 ). As a consequence, miRNA dysregulation is a common feature found in cancer, and several members of this family of regulatory RNAs have been proposed to act as oncogenes or tumour suppressors ( He et al, 2007 ; Shenouda and Alahari, 2009 ; Garzon et al, 2009a ).

At present, very little is known about the implication of miRNAs during mammalian aging. In contrast, several miRNAs have been associated with aging in Caenorhabditis elegans and it has been shown that knockdown of lin-4 miRNA extends lifespan in these nematodes ( Boehm and Slack, 2005 ; Williams et al, 2007 ). In vertebrates, profiling studies in liver and skeletal muscle from aged mice have revealed changes in miRNA expression during aging, although no differences have been identified in lung ( Williams et al, 2007 ; Drummond et al, 2008 ; Maes et al, 2008 ). Additionally, several miRNAs have been found to be dysregulated in the Ames dwarf mice, and miR-27 has been proposed to have a role in the delayed aging observed in these mice ( Bates et al, 2010 ). However, to date, no such studies have been performed in premature aging mice. In this work, we have evaluated for the first time the miRNA expression levels in a mouse model of human Hutchinson–Gilford progeria. We report that the expression of the miR-29 family of miRNAs is dysregulated in both pathological and physiological aging. In addition, we have found that miR-29 miRNAs form part of a new signalling pathway involving the Ppm1d/Wip1 phosphatase and the p53 tumour suppressor, which is activated in aging and during chronic DNA damage response.

Discussion

Since the discovery of miRNA-mediated translational regulation, a wide variety of functions have been associated with this process. Compared with protein–protein interactions, in which a single protein interacts with a reduced number of proteins, each miRNA has the potential ability to repress the translation of hundreds of transcripts ( Grigoriev, 2003 ; Lewis et al, 2005 ). Accordingly, dysregulation of miRNA expression could also contribute to the numerous alterations present in a very complex and multifactorial process such as aging. Previous works have analysed the expression of miRNAs in different tissues from young and old mice ( Williams et al, 2007 ; Maes et al, 2008 ) as well as in mice with delayed aging ( Bates et al, 2010 ), but the role of miRNAs in mice with accelerated aging is still unknown. Our results show that Zmpste24 -deficient mice, a mouse model of human Hutchinson–Gilford progeria, display dysregulated miRNA expression in liver and muscle. Among those miRNAs whose expression is altered in these progeroid mice, we have identified three miRNAs belonging to the miR-29 family which are significantly overexpressed in tissues from Zmpste24 −/− mice. miR-29 upregulation was especially relevant in muscle from Zmpste24 −/− mice, showing up to ∼10-fold higher levels than those of control animals. Further studies of miR-29 levels in liver and muscle samples from old mice demonstrated that the changes observed in these premature aging mice also occur during physiological aging. Notably, a recent exhaustive study of the age-related miRNA changes in the human and macaque brain cortex has identified the miR-29 family among those miRNAs with high age-correlated expression ( Somel et al, 2010 ). Additionally, miR-29 levels are downregulated in Ames dwarf mice, which display a delay in the onset of aging ( Bates et al, 2010 ), thus suggesting a more general role for this miRNA family in the regulation of processes associated with normal and pathological aging.

Functional analysis aimed at the characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed links between miR-29 and aging has revealed that the miR-29 upregulation is associated with the DNA damage response ( Figure 9 ). We had previously described that tissues from Zmpste24 -deficient mice present an accumulation of senescent cells and a marked transcriptional activation of p53 downstream targets ( Varela et al, 2005 ). Additionally, these progeroid mice present genomic instability and a profound stem cell dysfunction ( Liu et al, 2005 ; Espada et al, 2008 ; Marino et al, 2008 ). These previous findings prompted us to consider that the transcriptional activation of miR-29 family members could be part of the DNA damage response against genomic instability. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have found that miR-29 expression is progressively increased during passage of Zmpste24 −/− primary cultures from mouse ear fibroblasts, with the highest levels being detected when cells reach replicative senescence. Interestingly, this phenomenon was not an exclusive property of Zmpste24 -mutant mice fibroblasts, since miR-29 undergoes a similar upregulation in wild-type fibroblasts in serial passage. This observation, together with the finding that both wild-type and mutant mice fibroblasts display similar levels of miR-29 at first passage, indicates that miR-29 changes cannot fully explain the proliferation differences between wild-type and mutant fibroblasts in cell culture. However, the increased levels of senescence and DNA damage markers during serial passage of both wild-type and mutant mice, although at different extent, link the genotoxic stress with the progressive accumulation of miR-29.

Further confirmation of this association came from the treatment of wild-type fibroblasts with different genotoxic drugs. These experiments have revealed that doxorubicin, a DNA topoisomerase inhibitor that causes double-strand breaks and generates a kind of chronic DNA damage, also induces the transcriptional activation of either miR-29a, -29b, and -29c, in contrast with the treatment with H 2 O 2 or 4-NQO, which induce transient oxidative damage or UV-like lesions, respectively. According to these results, only the chronic or difficult to repair DNA damage induces the expression of this family of miRNAs. Furthermore, we have found that this upregulation occurs in a p53-dependent manner, since p53 −/− murine fibroblasts failed to increase miR-29 expression during successive cell culture passages and upon doxorubicin treatment. Likewise, ATM- deficient and ATR-Seckel murine fibroblasts failed to induce miR-29 expression when using equivalent concentrations of doxorubicin, which further confirms the link between DNA damage response and miR-29 regulation. More interestingly, high concentrations of doxorubicin activated the expression of miR-29 in both ATM -deficient and ATR-Seckel fibroblasts, which suggests that other regulatory mechanisms could be operating depending on the extent of DNA damage. In this regard, two recent works have identified c-myc and NF-κB as repressor factors of these miRNAs ( Liu et al, 2010 ; Mott et al, 2010 ). Collectively, all these data associate the miR-29 family upregulation present in both Zmpste24 -deficient mice and normal aging with the DNA damage response activation.

To identify miR-29 targets which could contribute to the observed effects related to aging and DNA damage response in Zmpste24 −/− progeroid mice, we followed an experimental approach based on the combination of target prediction by different algorithms with luciferase-based validation assays of the predicted targets. This strategy led us to identify seven transcripts subjected to repression by miR-29a, -29b or -29c. Interestingly, we did not observe different repression ratios by any of the three miRNAs of the miR-29 family, which suggests that they are not specialized in different functions and may perform redundant activities in the regulation of the identified targets. These targets include protein phosphatases (Ppm1d/Wip1 and Dusp2), oncogenes (Mycn), interferon-inducible proteins (Ifi30), transcriptional repressors (Hbp1), nuclear envelope proteins (Narf) and metalloproteases (Adamts18). Among all of them, we focused on Ppm1d phosphatase and prelamin A interacting protein Narf, which had been previously associated with processes of interest in relation to DNA damage and aging. Thus, Ppm1d dephosphorylates a variety of proteins involved in DNA damage response, such as p53, Chk1, Chk2, p38, γ-H2AX and ATM ( Lu et al, 2008a ; Cha et al, 2010 ). Moreover, Ppm1d is transcriptionally activated by p53 upon DNA damage and participates in a negative regulatory feedback with ATM ( Batchelor et al, 2008 , 2009 ). On the other hand, Narf interacts with prelamin A, whose accumulation at the nuclear envelope of Zmpste24 −/− cells is the pathological hallmark underlying the accelerated aging process exhibited by these mice ( Varela et al, 2008 ). Consequently, we evaluated the presence of miR-29 binding sites in these two targets, with the finding that a 2-nt mutation in the putative seed sequences of Ppm1d and Narf 3′-UTR abolishes the translational repression by miR-29 in luciferase assays. We also found that co-expression of the full-length mRNA of Ppm1d or Narf together with miR-29 precursor molecules in HEK-293 cells, significantly reduces Narf and Ppm1d protein levels compared with cells transfected with a control miRNA. These experiments confirm that Ppm1d and Narf transcripts contain functional miR-29 binding sites and that these miRNAs repress the translation of both targets. The lack of appropriate antibodies for Narf precluded further work to explore miR-29 effects on the endogenous protein, but parallel experiments demonstrated that miR-29 family members are able to inhibit endogenous Ppm1d protein production and that this effect has a special impact on the phosphorylation of p53.

According to the above results, it was tempting to speculate that miR-29 upregulation, as a likely consequence of the progressive accumulation of DNA damage, reduces Ppm1d protein levels, a key regulatory phosphatase of the DNA damage response that dephosphorylates a wide variety of proteins such as p53, Chk1, Chk2, p38, γ-H2AX and ATM, important for the control of cell viability ( Lu et al, 2008a ; Cha et al, 2010 ; Le Guezennec and Bulavin, 2010 ). Experiments aimed to further evaluate this hypothesis confirmed that increased levels of miR-29 through transfection of miRNA precursor molecules reduce fibroblasts proliferation and enhance cell senescence. Furthermore, γ-H2AX levels were increased in these cells, which demonstrated the increased sensitivity to DNA damage, an observation that was also confirmed by MTT assays of wild-type fibroblasts transfected with miR-29 precursor, although the possibility of a positive feedback in which miR-29 increases DNA damage cannot be discarded ( Figure 9 ). Importantly, we were also able to reverse the proliferation defects in Zmpste24 −/− fibroblasts by the transfection of antagomiR molecules against miR-29. Thus, miR-29 inhibition in these cells resulted in a strong increase in proliferation potential accompanied by a significant decrease in both the number of SA-βGal- and γ-H2AX-positive cells. Likewise, we could demonstrate that the sensitivity of Zmpste24 −/− fibroblasts to doxorubicin treatment is significantly diminished when miR-29 is downregulated by transfection of miRNA inhibitor molecules. Also in agreement with our proposal of a role for miR-29 in the modulation of cell viability, we have found higher phosphorylation levels of p53 at Ser15—the residue targeted by Ppm1d—in mouse fibroblasts transfected with miR-29 precursor molecules. Conversely, inhibitory molecules against miR-29 yielded the opposite effect, decreasing the levels of p53 phosphorylation in doxorubicin-treated wild-type fibroblasts. Moreover, a similar experiment with Zmpste24 -deficient mouse fibroblasts showed that miR-29 inhibition decrease the levels of phosphorylated p53 in both basal and doxorubicin conditions. Furthermore, we were able to correlate the p53 phosphorylation status with the PPM1D protein levels in basal and doxorubicin-treated U2OS human cells. These results are also consistent with previous data showing that miR-29 induces apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner and increases the levels of total-p53 ( Park et al, 2009 ), because p53 phosphorylation stabilizes the protein preventing its degradation by the proteasome ( Lavin and Gueven, 2006 ). Likewise, the observation that Ppm1d dephosphorylates Mdm2 and prevents p53 proteasome degradation ( Lu et al, 2008b ), is consistent with our finding that miR-29 targets Ppm1d and influences levels and activity of the p53 tumour suppressor.

Collectively, these data together with additional observations from the literature, strongly support our proposal that miR-29 is an aging-related miRNA. First, several reports have described a tumour suppressor role for miR-29 family members in several human cancers including haematological malignancies, rhabdomyosarcoma, pleural mesothelioma and hepatocellular carcinoma ( Pekarsky et al, 2006 ; Wang et al, 2008 ; Garzon et al, 2009b ; Pass et al, 2010 ; Xiong et al, 2010 ; Zhao et al, 2010 ). This tumour suppressive function of miR-29 family members is consistent with a pro-aging role for them, since a growing number of tumour suppressor genes have a negative role during aging through a process known as antagonistic pleiotropy ( Campisi, 2005 ; Kirkwood, 2005 ). In fact, Zmpste24 −/− progeroid mice exhibit a chronic hyperactivation of p53 signalling as well as a marked overexpression of other tumour suppressors such as p16/INK4A ( Varela et al, 2005 ; Espada et al, 2008 ). Moreover, functions attributed to miR-29 include reduction of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis, two features associated with the diminished capacity to maintain tissue homoeostasis which is a characteristic feature of aging processes ( Mott et al, 2007 ; Muniyappa et al, 2009 ). Notably, it has also been reported that miR-29b induces global DNA hypomethylation by targeting different demethylases ( Garzon et al, 2009b ), another observation that links miR-29 functions and aging, since epigenetic alterations are characteristic features of the aging process ( Gravina and Vijg, 2010 ; Osorio et al, 2010 ). Finally, miR-29 family members show increased expression during aging and an inverse relationship with expression levels of a group of cancer-related genes in human and macaque brain ( Somel et al, 2010 ).

In conclusion, we propose that miR-29 has a pivotal role in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation through the modulation of the DNA damage response ( Figure 9 ); thus, making these miRNAs very interesting in the context of both cancer and aging. Disruption of the DNA damage response is a hallmark of cancer progression that is achieved by many tumours through mutations in p53. However, tumours can amplify PPM1D as an alternative way to inhibit p53 activity and, interestingly, these tumours rarely harbour p53 mutations ( Bulavin et al, 2002 ). According to our results, miR-29 downregulation could constitute another way for tumours to reduce p53 signalling, thus allowing tumours to escape from apoptosis and growth arrest. Finally, the observation that miR-29 accumulates during aging provides an additional evidence for the implication of miRNAs in the development of the complex process of aging.
