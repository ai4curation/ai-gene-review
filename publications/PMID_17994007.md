DNA methyltransferase (cytosine-5) 1 (Dnmt1) is the principal enzyme responsible 
for maintenance of CpG methylation and is essential for the regulation of gene 
expression, silencing of parasitic DNA elements, genomic imprinting and 
embryogenesis. Dnmt1 is needed in S phase to methylate newly replicated CpGs 
occurring opposite methylated ones on the mother strand of the DNA, which is 
essential for the epigenetic inheritance of methylation patterns in the genome. 
Despite an intrinsic affinity of Dnmt1 for such hemi-methylated DNA, the 
molecular mechanisms that ensure the correct loading of Dnmt1 onto newly 
replicated DNA in vivo are not understood. The Np95 (also known as Uhrf1 and 
ICBP90) protein binds methylated CpG through its SET and RING finger-associated 
(SRA) domain. Here we show that localization of mouse Np95 to replicating 
heterochromatin is dependent on the presence of hemi-methylated DNA. Np95 forms 
complexes with Dnmt1 and mediates the loading of Dnmt1 to replicating 
heterochromatic regions. By using Np95-deficient embryonic stem cells and 
embryos, we show that Np95 is essential in vivo to maintain global and local DNA 
methylation and to repress transcription of retrotransposons and imprinted 
genes. The link between hemi-methylated DNA, Np95 and Dnmt1 thus establishes key 
steps of the mechanism for epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation.
