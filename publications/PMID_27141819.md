The pattern recognition molecules (PRMs) able to activate complement via the 
lectin pathway are suspected to be involved in the interaction between 
pathogenic Mycobacteria and the host immune response. Recently, we have found 
strong interactions between 25 and 35kDa mycobacterial cell fractions and 
mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins. Here we demonstrate that two 
biologically important mycobacterial structures, mannosylated lipoarabinomannan 
(ManLAM) and the antigen 85 (Ag85) complex, induce activation of the lectin 
pathway of complement. The strong interaction of recombinant MBL with purified 
ManLAM was confirmed, but no binding of recombinant ficolins (ficolin-1, -2, -3) 
with this structure was observed. Interestingly, all PRMs tested reacted with 
the mycobacterial antigen 85 (Ag85) complex. Based on the use of specific 
inhibitors (mannan for MBL, acetylated bovine serum albumin for ficolin-1 and 
-2, Hafnia alvei PCM 1200 lipopolysaccharide for ficolin-3), we concluded that 
carbohydrate-recognition (MBL) and fibrinogen-like domains (ficolins) were 
involved in these interactions. Our results indicate that the mycobacterial 
antigen 85 complex is a target for ficolins and MBL. Furthermore, those PRMs 
also bound to fibronectin and therefore might influence the Ag85 
complex-dependent interaction of Mycobacterium with the extracellular matrix.
