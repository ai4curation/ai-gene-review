Methanogenic and sulfate-reducing Archaea are considered to have an energy 
metabolism involving C1 transfer coenzymes and enzymes unique for this group of 
strictly anaerobic microorganisms. An aerobic methylotrophic bacterium, 
Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, was found to contain a cluster of genes that 
are predicted to encode some of these enzymes and was shown to contain two of 
the enzyme activities and one of the methanogenic coenzymes. Insertion mutants 
were all unable to grow on C1 compounds, suggesting that the archaeal enzymes 
function in aerobic C1 metabolism. Thus, methylotrophy and methanogenesis 
involve common genes that cross the bacterial/archaeal boundaries.
