The product of the intronless single copy gene RSC1A1, named RS1, is an 
intracellular 617-amino-acid protein that is involved in the regulation of the 
Na(+)-d-glucose cotransporter SGLT1. We generated and characterized RS1 knockout 
(RS1(-/-) mice. In the small intestines of RS1(-/-) mice, the SGLT1 protein was 
up-regulated sevenfold compared to that of wild-type mice but was not changed in 
the kidneys. The up-regulation of SGLT1 was posttranscriptional. Small 
intestinal d-glucose uptake measured in jointly perfused small bowel and liver 
was increased twofold compared to that of the wild-type, with increased peak 
concentrations of d-glucose in the portal vein. At birth, the weights of 
RS1(-/-) and wild-type mice were similar. At the age of 3 months, male RS1(-/-) 
mice had 5% higher weights and 15% higher food intakes, whereas their energy 
expenditures and serum leptin concentrations were similar to those of wild-type 
mice. At the age of 5 months, male and female RS1(-/-) mice were obese, with 30% 
increased body weight, 80% increased total fat, and 30% increased serum 
cholesterol. At this age, serum leptin was increased, whereas food intake was 
the same as for wild-type mice. The data suggest that the removal of RS1 leads 
to leptin-independent up-regulation of food intake, which causes obesity.
