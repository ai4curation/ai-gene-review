Seven secretory mammalian kexin-like subtilases have been identified that cleave 
a variety of precursor proteins at monobasic and dibasic residues. The recently 
characterized pyrolysin-like subtilase SKI-1 cleaves proproteins at nonbasic 
residues. In this work we describe the properties of a proteinase K-like 
subtilase, neural apoptosis-regulated convertase 1 (NARC-1), representing the 
ninth member of the secretory subtilase family. Biosynthetic and microsequencing 
analyses of WT and mutant enzyme revealed that human and mouse pro-NARC-1 are 
autocatalytically and intramolecularly processed into NARC-1 at the 
(Y,I)VV(V,L)(L,M) downward arrow motif, a site that is representative of its 
enzymic specificity. In vitro peptide processing studies andor Ala substitutions 
of the P1-P5 sites suggested that hydrophobicaliphatic residues are more 
critical at P1, P3, and P5 than at P2 or P4. NARC-1 expression is highest in 
neuroepithelioma SK-N-MCIXC, hepatic BRL-3A, and in colon carcinoma LoVo-C5 cell 
lines. In situ hybridization and Northern blot analyses of NARC-1 expression 
during development in the adult and after partial hepatectomy revealed that it 
is expressed in cells that have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate. 
These include hepatocytes, kidney mesenchymal cells, intestinal ileum, and colon 
epithelia as well as embryonic brain telencephalon neurons. Accordingly, 
transfection of NARC-1 in primary cultures of embryonic day 13.5 telencephalon 
cells led to enhanced recruitment of undifferentiated neural progenitor cells 
into the neuronal lineage, suggesting that NARC-1 is implicated in the 
differentiation of cortical neurons.

Abstract

Seven secretory mammalian kexin-like subtilases have been identified that cleave a variety of precursor proteins at monobasic and dibasic residues. The recently characterized pyrolysin-like subtilase SKI-1 cleaves proproteins at nonbasic residues. In this work we describe the properties of a proteinase K-like subtilase, neural apoptosis-regulated convertase 1 (NARC-1), representing the ninth member of the secretory subtilase family. Biosynthetic and microsequencing analyses of WT and mutant enzyme revealed that human and mouse pro-NARC-1 are autocatalytically and intramolecularly processed into NARC-1 at the ( Y , I )V V (V,L)( L , M )↓ motif, a site that is representative of its enzymic specificity. In vitro peptide processing studies and/or Ala substitutions of the P1–P5 sites suggested that hydrophobic/aliphatic residues are more critical at P1, P3, and P5 than at P2 or P4. NARC-1 expression is highest in neuroepithelioma SK-N-MCIXC, hepatic BRL-3A, and in colon carcinoma LoVo-C5 cell lines. In situ hybridization and Northern blot analyses of NARC-1 expression during development in the adult and after partial hepatectomy revealed that it is expressed in cells that have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate. These include hepatocytes, kidney mesenchymal cells, intestinal ileum, and colon epithelia as well as embryonic brain telencephalon neurons. Accordingly, transfection of NARC-1 in primary cultures of embryonic day 13.5 telencephalon cells led to enhanced recruitment of undifferentiated neural progenitor cells into the neuronal lineage, suggesting that NARC-1 is implicated in the differentiation of cortical neurons.

Discussion

Although the existence of nonbasic processing sites in precursors that transit through the secretory pathway has been recognized for many years ( 4 , 5 ), the recent discovery of SKI-1 provided an example of a PC cleaving downstream of nonbasic residues ( 6 , 7 ). However, because not all nonbasic sites are cleaved by SKI-1 (refs. 10 and 12 ; M. J. Vincent, personal communication), we mined databases for an additional PC. This process led us to the identification of an uncharacterized subtilase, NARC-1, cloned and sequenced during biopharmaceutical screenings.

In this work, we showed that hNARC-1 and mNARC-1 are synthesized as zymogens, rapidly processed in the ER. As observed for most other PCs, zymogen processing is an autocatalytic intramolecular event, and microsequence analysis has identified the cleavage site as ( Y , I )V V (V,L)( L , M )↓(K,E)E, indicative of the enzymic specificity of NARC-1. Point mutations have revealed that the hydrophobic P1, P3, and P5 sites may be critical, whereas P2 and P4 would be more flexible. This site was confirmed by in vitro enzymatic assays (Fig. 3 ). Interestingly, database screening revealed a candidate Fugu rubripes (puffer fish) NARC-1 ortholog exhibiting a 62% sequence identity within the catalytic subunit (FuguGenscan 21252). Strikingly, the critical residues at P1, P3, and P5 for zymogen processing are completely conserved. Like SKI-1, which differs from the basic specific PCs by its P2/P4 requirement instead of P1/P4 ( 3 ), NARC-1's specificity is distinct from all known convertases. In addition, whereas SKI-1 and furin require the presence of a basic amino acid at P4, NARC-1 does not.

Data presented in Fig. 2 B clearly show that the cleaved prosegment remains associated with NARC-1, even when secreted, similar to PC7 ( 37 ) and SKI-1 ( 9 , 11 ). In agreement, we detected only low levels of enzyme activity in vitro , even though NARC-1 is very efficiently secreted. Activity was enhanced by exposing NARC-1 to 0.5% SDS (Fig. 3 ), which is thought to favor the dissociation of its putative inhibitory prosegment ( 3 , 38 , 39 ). The strong association of NARC-1 and its prosegment may be caused by the absence of an effective secondary maturation site, and the question of how NARC-1 becomes maximally active remains open. Even though the enzyme is secreted as a 65-kDa product, NARC-1 activity was directly measured in vitro with fluorogenic substrates (Fig. 3 ) and indirectly in primary cultures of neural progenitor cells (Fig. 6 ). Although we did not clearly identify a second processing site in either HK293, CHO, or Neuro2A cells, traces of an ≈58-kDa V5-immunoreactive protein were detected in the medium (Fig. 2 B – F ). This shorter form, also observed in the absence of N-glycosylation, may represent a further N-terminally processed NARC-1. However, its scarcity has precluded its N-terminal sequencing. If autocatalytic, cleavage may occur somewhere between residues 110 and 144. Future mutagenesis should clarify this point.

Ontogeny studies (Fig. 4 ) showed that NARC-1 is transiently expressed in the forming telencephalon, cerebellum, and kidney cortex. In the kidney, NARC-1 expression appears within the cortex around E15 and disappears around P12, when it becomes localized to the medulla. It is tempting to speculate that NARC-1 plays a role in the development of the kidney, which is thought to originate through a series of complex interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal components of the intermediate mesoderm ( 40 ). This type of transient expression was also observed in the telencephalon, where NARC-1 expression is seen only between E12 and E15 and in the cerebellar primordium (Fig. 4 A ). The E12–E15 gestational period is characterized by active neurogenesis in the developing forebrain and other regions of the nervous system ( 41 ). Our results suggest that overexpression of hNARC-1 enhances the recruitment of undifferentiated neural telencephalic progenitor cells toward the neuronal lineage (Fig. 6 ). The precise nature of the secretory pathway substrate(s) processed by NARC-1 is not known. In the adult brain, NARC-1 expression is evident in the RE-OP (Fig. 4 C ), resembling the location of multipotential neurogenic progenitor cells ( 34 ). These neurons originate from the subventricular zone, migrate within the RE-OP, to eventually reach the olfactory bulb. This finding suggests that NARC-1 may participate in the differentiation and/or proliferation of these  progenitor-like cells within the RE-OP.

Although NARC-1 expression is very high in developing liver hepatocytes and intestinal villi and decreases significantly in adulthood, these remain the major expressing tissues. Within the digestive system, NARC-1 expression is prominent in the ileum/jejunum between E15 and E17, just at the time when the gut tube increases in length and luminal diameter as well as in the complexity of the villous lining of this region. In the adult rat digestive system, the small intestine's ileum and jejunum are major sites of NARC-1 expression, compared with the stomach, caecum (not shown), duodenum, and colon (Fig. 5 B ); this tissue distribution somewhat resembles PC5 expression, which also shows maximal expression in the ileum ( 16 ). These results suggest that NARC-1 could regulate the physiology of the small intestine.

Analysis of NARC-1 expression in cell lines revealed that it is not as widely expressed as SKI-1 ( 6 ), PC7 ( 15 ), or furin ( 16 ). In fact, NARC-1 mRNA is richest in neuroepithelioma SK-N-MCIXC and in colon carcinoma LoVo-C5 (but not its derivative LoVo-D) cells. It is also found in liver-derived hepatocytes HepG2 and BRL-3A, pancreatic βTC3 and Rin-m5F, and colon HT-29 cells. Although we could detect NARC-1 by Northern blot (Fig. 5 A ) and quantitative RT-PCR (not shown) in many other cell lines, its expression therein is much less pronounced.

Restoration of liver mass after 2/3 PHx is controlled by the complex interplay of cytokines, growth factors, and metabolic status ( 42 ). Interestingly, the mRNA levels of PC5 and, to a lesser extent, PACE4 and furin (but not SKI-1 and PC7) seem to peak on day 1 after PHx, i.e., during the acute response phase (Fig. 5 C ), and likely process factors participating in the growth and/or differentiation of hepatocytes. In contrast, NARC-1 expression peaks on day 2, in a similar fashion to that of liver and intestinal apolipoprotein B (ApoB) ( 43 ). It is noteworthy that the localization of NARC-1 to human chromosome 1p33–34.3 is close to that of a major locus (FH3) for autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia located at 1p34.1-p32 ( 44 ). This locus is associated with an increase in the hepatic secretion of low-density lipoprotein (of which ApoB is the major protein) but not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides ( 44 , 45 ).

In conclusion, characterization of the enzymic properties and specificity of the secretory NARC-1, its ontogeny, tissue expression, and neurogenic and possibly hepatogenic properties paves the way for a molecular understanding of its biological functions. The enzymic specificity of NARC-1 suggests that its cognate substrates are likely to be very different from those of either the dibasic PCs or SKI-1. Future work on the development of specific inhibitors and gene silencing of this convertase should serve to delineate in more detail its biology and possible implication in pathologies such as familial hypercholesterolemia.
