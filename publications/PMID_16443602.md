The induction of apoptosis by p53 in response to cellular stress is its most 
conserved function and crucial for p53 tumor suppression. We recently reported 
that p53 directly induces oligomerization of the BH1,2,3 effector protein Bak, 
leading to outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (OMMP) with release of 
apoptotic activator proteins. One important mechanism by which p53 achieves OMMP 
is by forming an inhibitory complex with the anti-apoptotic BclXL protein. In 
contrast, the p53 complex with the Bcl2 homolog has not been interrogated. Here 
we have undertaken a detailed characterization of the p53-Bcl2 interaction using 
structural, biophysical, and mutational analyses. We have identified the p53 DNA 
binding domain as the binding interface for Bcl2 using solution NMR. The 
affinity of the p53-Bcl2 complex was determined by surface plasmon resonance 
analysis (BIAcore) to have a dominant component KD 535 +/- 24 nm. Moreover, in 
contrast to wild type p53, endogenous missense mutants of p53 are unable to form 
complexes with endogenous Bcl2 in human cancer cells. Functionally, these 
mutants are all completely or strongly compromised in mediating OMMP, as 
measured by cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. These data 
implicate p53-Bcl2 complexes in contributing to the direct mitochondrial p53 
pathway of apoptosis and further support the notion that the DNA binding domain 
of p53 is a dual function domain, mediating both its transactivation function 
and its direct mitochondrial apoptotic function.
