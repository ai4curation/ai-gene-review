DNA ligase IV (LIG4) is a nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) protein used for 
V(D)J recombination and DNA repair. In mice, Lig4 deficiency causes embryonic 
lethality, massive neuronal apoptosis, arrested lymphogenesis, and various 
cellular defects. Herein, we assess potential roles in this phenotype for 
INK4a/ARF and p53, two proteins implicated in apoptosis and senescence. 
INK4a/ARF deficiency rescued proliferation/senescence defects of Lig4-deficient 
fibroblasts but not other phenotypic aspects. In contrast, p53 deficiency 
rescued embryonic lethality, neuronal apoptosis, and fibroblast 
proliferation/senescence defects but not lymphocyte development or 
radiosensitivity. Young Lig4/p53 double null mice routinely died from pro-B 
lymphomas. Thus, in the context of Lig4 deficiency, embryonic lethality and 
neuronal apoptosis likely result from a p53-dependent response to unrepaired DNA 
damage, and neuronal apoptosis and lymphocyte developmental defects can be 
mechanistically dissociated.
