The cytolytic T lymphocyte protease granzyme A (GzmA) initiates a 
caspase-independent cell death pathway. Here we report that the rate-limiting 
enzyme of DNA base excision repair, apurinic endonuclease-1 (Ape1), which is 
also known as redox factor-1 (Ref-1), binds to GzmA and is contained in the SET 
complex, a macromolecular complex of 270-420 kDa that is associated with the 
endoplasmic reticulum and is targeted by GzmA during cell-mediated death. GzmA 
cleaves Ape1 after Lys31 and destroys its known oxidative repair functions. In 
so doing, GzmA may block cellular repair and force apoptosis. In support of 
this, cells with silenced Ape1 expression are more sensitive, whereas cells 
overexpressing noncleavable Ape1 are more resistant, to GzmA-mediated death.
