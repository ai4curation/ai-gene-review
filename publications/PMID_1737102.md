Osteonectin is a 32-Kd phosphoglycoprotein originally described in bone but also 
found in platelets. Platelet and bone osteonectin are different both 
structurally and immunologically. We have previously shown that platelet 
osteonectin, by binding to thrombospondin, is involved in the 
secretion-dependent phase of the platelet aggregation process. In this study, we 
used antiosteonectin antibodies in combination with immunogold labeling to 
investigate by electron microscopy the fine localization of osteonectin within 
normal and gray platelets. Using both a polyclonal and monoclonal antibody ON3, 
osteonectin was specifically located at the internal face of alpha-granule 
membranes within normal platelets. Osteonectin was not distributed within all 
alpha-granules, probably because of its low platelet content. In addition, using 
immunofluorescence, osteonectin could also be detected in immature and mature 
megakaryocytes with a granular pattern of staining, suggesting that osteonectin 
is synthesized by megakaryocytes. Using platelets from two patients with gray 
platelet syndrome, osteonectin was absent within all abnormal small 
alpha-granules, but was detected in some rare normal-sized alpha-granules. In 
separate double-label studies, thrombospondin and von Willebrand factor did not 
colocalize with osteonectin in resting platelets. However, osteonectin was 
located at the inner face of the alpha-granules, as it is for alpha-granule 
membrane protein GMP-140 and glycoprotein IIb-IIIa. These results, taken 
together with the fact that monoclonal antibodies to osteonectin bind only to 
the surface of activated platelets, suggest that platelet osteonectin is 
redistributed to the cell surface during fusion of alpha-granule membranes with 
the plasma membrane.
