RIMs are presynaptic active zone proteins that regulate neurotransmitter 
release. We describe two related genes that encode proteins with identical 
C-terminal sequences that bind to the conserved PDZ domain of RIMs via an 
unusual PDZ-binding motif. These proteins were previously reported separately as 
ELKS, Rab6-interacting protein 2, and CAST, leading us to refer to them by the 
acronym ERC. Alternative splicing of the C terminus of ERC1 generates a longer 
ERC1a variant that does not bind to RIMs and a shorter ERC1b variant that binds 
to RIMs, whereas the C terminus of ERC2 is synthesized only in a single 
RIM-binding variant. ERC1a is expressed ubiquitously as a cytosolic protein 
outside of brain; ERC1b is detectable only in brain, where it is both a 
cytosolic protein and an insoluble active zone component; and ERC2 is 
brain-specific but exclusively localized to active zones. Only brain-specific 
ERCs bind to RIMs, but both ubiquitous and brain-specific ERCs bind to Rab6, a 
GTP-binding protein involved in membrane traffic at the Golgi complex. ERC1a and 
ERC1b/2 likely perform similar functions at distinct localizations, indicating 
unexpected connections between nonneuronal membrane traffic at the Golgi complex 
executed via Rab6 and neuronal membrane traffic at the active zone executed via 
RIMs.
