Lysozyme has been studied in insects as part of the system of inducible 
antibacterial defence in the haemolymph. We recently found two Drosophila 
lysozyme genes that are constitutively expressed in the digestive tract, and are 
probably involved in the digestion of bacteria in the food. To obtain an 
overview of the lysozyme genes in this species and their possible roles in 
immunity and digestion, we have now characterized all six lysozyme genes in the 
cloned part of the lysozyme locus at 61F, and a seventh gene that maps to the 
same chromosomal location. The expression of the genes follows four different 
patterns: firstly, four closely related genes, LysB, C, D and E, are all 
strongly expressed in the midgut of larvae and adults; secondly, LysP is 
expressed in the adult salivary gland; thirdly, LysS is expressed mainly in the 
gastric caecae of larvae; and finally, LysX is primarily expressed in the 
metamorphosing midgut of late larvae and early pupae. The LysD-like genes and 
LysS are strongly repressed in artificially infected animals, possibly 
reflecting a malaise reaction in the digestive tract. None of the genes is 
expressed in the fat body or haemocytes. Thus rather than being a component of 
the haemolymph, the Drosophila lysozymes are found mainly in the digestive tract 
where they are expressed at a high level. Furthermore all genes, except LysP, 
encode acidic proteins, in contrast to the strongly basic "typical" lysozymes. 
This is highly reminiscent of the situation in ruminants, where the lysozymes 
have been recruited for the digestion of symbiotic bacteria in the stomach.
