To elucidate whether new proteases are involved in the processing of amyloid 
precursor protein (APP), we examined catalytically active ADAM12 and ADAM19 as 
candidates alpha-secretases. The overexpression of ADAM19 in HEK293 cells 
resulted in an increase in sAPPalpha. Therefore, we suggest that ADAM19 has a 
constitutive alpha-secretase activity. We examined regulated alpha-secretase 
activity by adding phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), but no regulated 
activity was found. To verify that endogenous ADAM19 has an APP alpha-secretase 
activity, we examined whether the constitutive level of alpha-secretase activity 
was reduced by RNA interference with ADAM19 in A172 cells. The amount of 
secreted sAPPalpha decreased by about 21% following RNAi. These results suggest 
that ADAM19 has a constitutive alpha-secretase activity for APP.
