Yeast SWI/SNF is a multisubunit, 1.14-MDa ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling 
enzyme required for transcription of a subset of inducible genes. Biochemical 
studies have demonstrated that SWI/SNF uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to 
generate superhelical torsion, mobilize mononucleosomes, enhance the 
accessibility of nucleosomal DNA and remove H2A-H2B dimers from mononucleosomes. 
Here we describe the ATP-dependent activities of a SWI/SNF sub complex that is 
composed of only three subunits, Swi2p, Arp7p and Arp9p. Whereas this sub 
complex is fully functional in most remodeling assays, Swi2p-Arp7p-Arp9p is 
defective for ATP-dependent removal of H2A-H2B dimers. We identify the acidic N 
terminus of the Swi3p subunit as a novel H2A-H2B-binding domain required for 
ATP-dependent dimer loss. Our data indicate that H2A-H2B dimer loss is not an 
obligatory consequence of ATP-dependent DNA translocation, and furthermore they 
suggest that SWI/SNF is composed of at least four interdependent modules.
