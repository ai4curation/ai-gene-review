Adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein protects against cell death induced by viral 
infection and certain external stimuli. The Bcl-2 protein can functionally 
substitute for the E1B 19 kDa protein. To identify cellular targets for the 19 
kDa protein, we used the two-hybrid screen in yeast. We have isolated cDNAs for 
three different proteins, designated Nip1, Nip2, and Nip3, that interact with 
the 19 kDa protein. Mutational analysis indicates that these proteins do not 
associate with 19 kDa mutants defective in suppression of cell death, suggesting 
a correlation between interaction of these proteins and suppression of cell 
death. These proteins also associate with discrete sequence motifs in the Bcl-2 
protein that are homologous to motifs of the 19 kDa protein. Our results suggest 
that two diverse proteins, the E1B 19 kDa and the Bcl-2 proteins, promote cell 
survival through interaction with a common set of cellular proteins.
