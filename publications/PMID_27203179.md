Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) control cell division in eukaryotes by 
phosphorylating proteins involved in division. But successful proliferation 
requires co-ordination between division and cellular growth in mass. Previous 
proteomic studies suggested that metabolic proteins, as well as cell division 
proteins, could potentially be substrates of cyclin-dependent kinases. Here we 
focus on two metabolic enzymes of the yeast S. cerevisiae, neutral trehalase 
(Nth1) and glycogen phosphorylase (Gph1), and show that their activities are 
likely directly controlled by CDK activity, thus allowing co-ordinate regulation 
of carbohydrate metabolism with cell division processes. In this case, 
co-ordinate regulation may optimize the decision to undertake a final cell 
division as nutrients are being exhausted. Co-regulation of cell division 
processes and metabolic processes by CDK activity may be a general phenomenon 
important for co-ordinating the cell cycle with growth.

Introduction

Cell proliferation requires two kinds of processes, growth (macromolecular synthesis, addition of mass) and division. On average, proliferating cells exactly double their mass every round of cell division. Thus, although growth and division processes can be considered separately, nevertheless long term cell proliferation requires co-ordination between them.

Hartwell demonstrated the separate control of growth and division by studying yeast cell division cycle ( cdc ) mutants, which had defects in cell division ( Hartwell et al., 1974 ; Johnston et al., 1977 ). A key observation was that cdc defects did not stop macromolecular synthesis or growth in mass. Thus, cdc mutants, though arrested in the cell cycle, nevertheless continued to add mass, protein, RNA, etc, and grew to extraordinarily large sizes.

Hartwell proposed that yeast cells grow in mass as fast as they can without regard for the cell cycle. Co-ordination is achieved indirectly because cell cycle entry is triggered only when cells have grown to a sufficiently large size (“size control”). In this view, growth is primary. Dependence of the cell cycle on prior growth gives the observed and necessary co-ordination between division and growth ( Hartwell et al., 1974 ; Johnston et al., 1977 ). In this view, the cell cycle machinery need not modulate growth.

This view has been key to the rapid progress in understanding the cell division cycle. Nevertheless, although co-ordination is achieved predominantly because cell division depends on growth, it is also true that it might sometimes be advantageous if cell cycle regulators could directly control growth as well as division. In mammalian cells, the separation of control between growth and division is less clear than in yeasts; for instance, many growth factors affect both growth and division. Indeed, recent work has highlighted connections between metabolism and cancer (reviewed by ( Cheong et al., 2012 ; Vander Heiden et al., 2009 ; Ward and Thompson, 2012 )). Therefore it is worth investigating how, and to what extent, growth and division processes may be co-ordinately regulated by the central cell cycle Cyclin Dependent Kinase (CDK).

Several proteome-wide screens have been done in yeast to find CDK substrates ( Archambault et al., 2004 ; Holt et al., 2009 ; Kanshin et al., 2015 ; Li et al., 2014 ; Ubersax et al., 2003 ). Not surprisingly, many putative substrates are involved specifically in cell division, including proteins for cell cycle transcription, budding, DNA replication, and mitosis ( Holt et al., 2009 ; Ubersax et al., 2003 ). However, hundreds of other putative substrates are not obviously cell cycle specific ( Holt et al., 2009 ; Ubersax et al., 2003 ). These substrates could be false positives in these proteome-wide screens. Alternatively, perhaps CDK is genuinely regulating many substrates involved in growth processes, as opposed to division processes.

The role of CDK phosphorylation of these growth proteins has been studied in only a handful of cases. Kurat et al. ( Kurat et al., 2009 ) showed that activity of the yeast triacyglycerol lipase Tgl4 is controlled by CDK. Harbauer et al. found that in yeast, mitotic CDK activity directly stimulates mitochondrial protein import ( Harbauer et al., 2014 ). Recently, Aregger et al. ( Aregger et al., 2016 ) found a link between CDK activity and translation. Other instances have been reviewed ( Fajas, 2013 ).

For yeast, the most important nutrient is sugar. The storage of sugar as glycogen and trehalose is under strong cell cycle control ( Guillou et al., 2004 ; Kuenzi and Fiechter, 1969 ; Muller et al., 2003 ; Sillje et al., 1999 ; Sillje et al., 1997 ). In slowly-growing cells (but not in cells growing rapidly on glucose), storage carbohydrate rises to very high levels (up to 20% of dry cell mass) in early G1 phase. Then, in later G1 when cells commit to cell cycle entry (Start), both glycogen and trehalose are liquidated to glucose ( Muller et al., 2003 ; Sillje et al., 1997 ). Because the switch from carbohydrate accumulation to liquidation co-incides with the rise in G1 Cyclin Dependent Kinase activity, and because some of the enzymes involved are known to be phosphorylated on CDK consensus sites (see below), we speculated that glycogen and trehalose metabolism might be directly controlled by CDK. Thus, to begin validation of the putative metabolic CDK substrates as relevant substrates, we focused on regulation of glycogen and trehalose by CDK activity.

Glycogen is a branched polysaccharide synthesized by glycogen synthase ( GSY1 and GSY2 in yeast) and branching enzyme ( GLC3 ) (reviewed by ( Wilson et al., 2010 ). Breakdown requires glycogen phosphorylase ( GPH1 ) and debranching enzyme ( GDB1 ). The vacuolar glucoamylase Sga1 in also involved ( Wilson et al., 2010 ). Trehalose is a dissacharide. Its synthesis requires trehalose-6-phosphate synthase ( TPS1 ) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase ( TPS2 ). Breakdown to glucose is largely due to neutral trehalase, which is encoded by two genes, NTH1 and NTH2 , of which NTH1 is more active. In addition to transcriptional regulation, many of these activities are subject to post-translational regulation via phosphorylation ( Wilson et al., 2010 ). In many systems, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (Protein Kinase A, PKA) leads (directly or indirectly) to phosphorylation of both glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase, inhibiting the former but activating the latter. Thus, high PKA levels lead to low glycogen (because synthesis is inhibited while breakdown is activated), while low PKA levels lead to high glycogen. For example, in yeast, high PKA activity leads to Gsy2 phosphorylation, inactivating the enzyme and glycogen synthesis ( Wilson et al., 2010 ). At the same time, high PKA activity leads to Gph1 phosphorylation on T31, activating the enzyme and glycogen breakdown ( Lin et al., 1996 ). PKA may also activate neutral trehalase (Nth1) by phosphorylating S20, S21, S60 and S83, with S60 and S83 apparently most important ( Schepers et al., 2012 ; Veisova et al., 2012 ).

However, PKA is not the only protein kinase involved. Glycogen synthase Gsy2 is inhibited by phosphorylation on Ser650 (RPL S VPG), Ser654 (VPG S PRD), and Thr667 (VYM T PGD). While the kinase phosphorylating S650 is not known, S654 and T667 have been identified as substrates of the cyclin dependent kinase Pho85 (a CDK not primarily involved in cell cycle) in a complex with the cyclins Pcl8 or Pcl10 ( Huang et al., 1998 ; Wilson et al., 2010 ). S654 is in a sequence context favorable for phosphorylation by the cell-cycle CDK Cdc28.

Discussion

For the last four decades, it has been thought that regulation of the cell cycle, and regulation of growth and metabolism, are largely independent processes, ultimately linked by a cell size control on division. However, we show here that the central cell cycle regulatorly CDK directly modulates metabolism of storage carbohydrates. Glycogen and trehalose accumulate to very high levels in slowly-growing G1-phase yeast when either G1 cyclin expression or Cdc28 kinase activity is blocked, but are liquidated to glucose when Cln-Cdc28 activity is provided. Neutral trehalase, Nth1, is phosphorylated on a CDK consensus site in vivo ( Albuquerque et al., 2008 ; Chi et al., 2007 ; Holt et al., 2009 ; Swaney et al., 2013 ). We find this same site can be directly phosphorylated in vitro by CDK, and that such phosphorylation increases enzymatic activity in vitro . Lack of the site, or lack of the kinase, decreases trehalose mobilization in vivo . Finally, we note that this site (SPFKK) is not only an excellent site for CDK phosphorylation, it is also an essentially perfect consensus site (S-P-x-K/R-K/R-K/R) for dephosphorylation by the phosphatase Cdc14 ( Bremmer et al., 2012 ). The observed pattern of trehalose abundance (high in early G1, low at other times) is consistent with a simple model in which trehalase is activated by any form of CDK, followed by inactivation by Cdc14 in late M/early G1. Thus, direct control by CDK can explain the mechanism by which stored carbohydrate oscillates with the cell cycle ( Kuenzi and Fiechter 1969 ; Sillje et al. 1997 ; Muller et al. 2003 ).

In cells at low titers respiring in plentiful non-fermentable carbon source such as ethanol, we found that a relatively small amount of carbohydrate was stored, perhaps 300 fg in a G1-phase cell. This is only enough to fully support ATP generation via glycolysis for about 20 seconds. Accordingly, mutants that could not store carbohydrate had no observable phenotypes while growing under such conditions. This finding poses some challenges to the idea of a yeast metabolic cycle ( Chen et al., 2007 ; Klevecz et al., 2004 ; Tu et al., 2005 ), which is proposed to allow respiring yeast to switch to glycolysis for the duration of S-phase, to avoid the mutagenic effects of reactive oxygen species. Yet, the amount of stored carbohydrate (at low cell titer) seemed too small to support such glycolysis, and we saw no convincing increase in mutation rate in strains that could not liquidate carbohydrate during S-phase.

On the other hand, in cells approaching stationary phase, glycogen and trehalose accumulated to as much as 3000 fg/cell, or about 20% of dry cell mass ( Fig. 6 , ( Guillou et al., 2004 ; Muller et al., 2003 ). At the beginning of a new cell cycle, this carbohydrate can be liquidated in a CDK-dependent way (PKA may also be required). Under these circumstances, CDK activity is presumably having a very major effect on the overall metabolism of the cell, and the overall rate of biosynthetic activity, since it is controlling (with PKA) cellular access to large amounts of stored carbohydrate. We believe CDK regulation of carbohydrate is important for co-ordinating the use of scarce carbohydrate in the final cell division with the need to store some carbohydrate, perhaps for stress resistance, perhaps for mating, perhaps for sporulation, perhaps for re-entering the cell cycle. Cells that cannot manage this co-ordination either divide too many times, and fail to store carbohydrate, or divide too few times, and do not generate the optimum number of progeny.

Although we have focused on the CDK-induced liquidation of carbohydrate via Nth1 and Gph1, liquidation cannot fully explain the large effects of CDK activity on carbohydrate stores ( Fig. 1 , 2 , 3 ). High CDK activity may also repress synthesis.

NTH1 has a paralog, NTH2 . The Nth2 protein does not conserve the CDK site at S66, SPFK, but instead has the sequence SDFK. That is, at the site where we believe Nth1 is phosphorylated to generate negative charge and activate the enzyme, Nth2 already has an acidic residue. Possibly an acidic residue is ancestral, and a phosphorylatable residue has evolved to allow control in Nth1 ( Pearlman et al., 2011 ).

The CHO - mutant is reminiscent of whi2 , the second discovered cell size mutant of S. cerevisiae ( Sudbery et al., 1980 ). Like the CHO - mutant, whi2 has normal-sized cells in exponential growth, but small cells in stationary phase, because it undertakes an extra division, and like the CHO - mutant, whi2 is sensitive to heat shock. Whi2 is associated with the Psr1 plasma membrane phosphatase, and together they help regulate the phosphorylation state and activity of Msn2 ( Kaida et al., 2002 ), a stress-related transcription factor. Conceivably they also regulate phosphorylation of enzymes involved in glycogen and trehalose synthesis and liquidation.

Gph1 and Nth1 seem to be activated by both PKA and CDK. It is noteworthy that the CDK sites are nestled close to the PKA sites ( Fig. 2A ); both kinds of phosphorylations may activate by the same mechanism, and may do so synergistically, perhaps via 14-3-3 proteins ( Veisova et al., 2012 ). We have not explored the relationship between PKA activation and CDK activation, but this is potentially very interesting. We note that Bcy1, the regulatory subunit of PKA, was found as a CDK substrate in multiple studies ( Holt et al., 2009 ; Ubersax et al., 2003 ), and that the three G1 cyclins Cln1, Cln2, and Cln3 all have multiple consensus PKA phosphorylation sites (data not shown), and that (direct or indirect) regulation of Cln-Cdc28 activity by PKA has previously been shown ( Tokiwa et al., 1994 ). Muller et al. found a peak of PKA activity at the same time as Start, when there is high CDK activity ( Muller et al., 2003 ). Thus, in addition to interacting on substrates, the two protein kinases could regulate each other.

Although we have focused on carbohydrate storage, our over-riding point is that the sphere of influence of CDK is not limited to cell cycle-specific events. Instead, CDK activity also modulates metabolism, and the regulation of Gph1 and Nth1 are just examples of this, perhaps the tip of the iceberg. The validation of Gph1 and Nth1 as relevant CDK substrates implies that many of the other 126 “metabolic” substrates of Table S1 may also be real and relevant. Appreciating the full extent of CDK influence on metabolism will require careful experiments specifically looking for such effects.
