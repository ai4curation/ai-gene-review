Treatment options for adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the salivary gland, a 
slowly growing tumor with propensity for neuroinvasion and late recurrence, are 
limited to surgery and radiotherapy. Based on expression analysis performed on 
clinical specimens of salivary cancers, we identified in ACC expression of the 
neurotrophin-3 receptor TrkC/NTRK3, neural crest marker SOX10, and other 
neurologic genes. Here, we characterize TrkC as a novel ACC marker, which was 
highly expressed in 17 out of 18 ACC primary-tumor specimens, but not in 
mucoepidermoid salivary carcinomas or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. 
Expression of the TrkC ligand NT-3 and Tyr-phosphorylation of TrkC detected in 
our study suggested the existence of an autocrine signaling loop in ACC with 
potential therapeutic significance. NT-3 stimulation of U2OS cells with ectopic 
TrkC expression triggered TrkC phosphorylation and resulted in Ras, Erk 1/2 and 
Akt activation, as well as VEGFR1 phosphorylation. Without NT-3, TrkC remained 
unphosphorylated, stimulated accumulation of phospho-p53 and had opposite 
effects on p-Akt and p-Erk 1/2. NT-3 promoted motility, migration, invasion, 
soft-agar colony growth and cytoskeleton restructuring in TrkC-expressing U2OS 
cells. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that TrkC-positive ACC 
specimens also show high expression of Bcl2, a Trk target regulated via Erk 1/2, 
in agreement with activation of the TrkC pathway in real tumors. In normal 
salivary gland tissue, both TrkC and Bcl2 were expressed in myoepithelial cells, 
suggesting a principal role for this cell lineage in the ACC origin and 
progression. Sub-micromolar concentrations of a novel potent Trk inhibitor 
AZD7451 completely blocked TrkC activation and associated tumorigenic behaviors. 
Pre-clinical studies on ACC tumors engrafted in mice showed efficacy and low 
toxicity of AZD7451, validating our in vitro data and stimulating more research 
into its clinical application. In summary, we describe in ACC a previously 
unrecognized pro-survival neurotrophin signaling pathway and link it with cancer 
progression.
