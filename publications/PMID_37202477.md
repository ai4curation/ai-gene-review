Accurate replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by DNA polymerase γ (Polγ) is 
essential for maintaining cellular energy supplies, metabolism, and cell cycle 
control. To illustrate the structural mechanism for Polγ coordinating polymerase 
(pol) and exonuclease (exo) activities to ensure rapid and accurate DNA 
synthesis, we determined four cryo-EM structures of Polγ captured after accurate 
or erroneous incorporation to a resolution of 2.4-3.0 Å. The structures show 
that Polγ employs a dual-checkpoint mechanism to sense nucleotide 
misincorporation and initiate proofreading. The transition from replication to 
error editing is accompanied by increased dynamics in both DNA and enzyme, in 
which the polymerase relaxes its processivity and the primer-template DNA 
unwinds, rotates, and backtracks to shuttle the mismatch-containing primer 
terminus 32 Å to the exo site for editing. Our structural and functional studies 
also provide a foundation for analyses of Polγ mutation-induced human diseases 
and aging.
