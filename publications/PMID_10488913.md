Neuronal death after brain ischemia is mainly due to necrosis but there is also 
evidence for involvement of apoptosis. To test the importance of apoptosis, we 
investigated the effect of targeted disruption of the apoptosis-suppressive gene 
bcl-2 on the severity of ischemic brain injury. Transient focal ischemia for 1 
hour was induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in homozygous (n=7) 
and heterozygous (n=6) bcl-2 knockout mice as well as in their wildtype 
littermates (n=5). Bcl-2 ablation did not influence cerebral blood flow but it 
significantly increased infarct size and neurological deficit score at 1 day 
after reperfusion in a gene-dose dependent manner. The exacerbation of tissue 
damage in the absence of Bcl-2 underscores the importance of apoptotic pathways 
for the manifestation of ischemic injury after transient vascular occlusion.
