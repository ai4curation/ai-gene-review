Blood-feeding insects, including the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, use 
highly specialized and sensitive olfactory systems to locate their hosts. This 
is accomplished by detecting and following plumes of volatile host emissions, 
which include carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 is sensed by a population of olfactory 
sensory neurons in the maxillary palps of mosquitoes and in the antennae of the 
more genetically tractable fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster. The molecular 
identity of the chemosensory CO2 receptor, however, remains unknown. Here we 
report that CO2-responsive neurons in Drosophila co-express a pair of 
chemosensory receptors, Gr21a and Gr63a, at both larval and adult life stages. 
We identify mosquito homologues of Gr21a and Gr63a, GPRGR22 and GPRGR24, and 
show that these are co-expressed in A. gambiae maxillary palps. We show that 
Gr21a and Gr63a together are sufficient for olfactory CO2-chemosensation in 
Drosophila. Ectopic expression of Gr21a and Gr63a together confers CO2 
sensitivity on CO2-insensitive olfactory neurons, but neither gustatory receptor 
alone has this function. Mutant flies lacking Gr63a lose both 
electrophysiological and behavioural responses to CO2. Knowledge of the 
molecular identity of the insect olfactory CO2 receptors may spur the 
development of novel mosquito control strategies designed to take advantage of 
this unique and critical olfactory pathway. This in turn could bolster the 
worldwide fight against malaria and other insect-borne diseases.
