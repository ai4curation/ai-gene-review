The tumor suppressor p53 protein binds to the products of several viral 
oncogenes, including SV40 large T antigen. We reconstructed the p53-T antigen 
interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay that uses the 
reconstitution of the activity of a transcriptional activator to detect 
protein-protein interactions. Using mutants of T antigen known to be defective 
in binding to p53, we demonstrate that the two-hybrid system is more sensitive 
than immunoprecipitation in the detection of weak interactions. We mutagenized 
the murine p53 gene and screened in the yeast assay for decreased reporter gene 
expression indicative of the failure of p53 to bind T antigen. This screen 
identified 34 p53 mutants, almost all of which contain at least one mutation in 
the conserved domains frequently found mutated in human cancers. These results 
support the idea that the function of the wild-type p53 protein requires 
residues involved in binding to T antigen, and indicate that this approach may 
be generally applicable in the analysis of protein-protein interactions.
