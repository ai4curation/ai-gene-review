Using the yeast two-hybrid system we have identified novel potential Cdk4 
interacting proteins. Here we described the interaction of Cdk4 with a human 
homologue of the yeast Drosophila CDC37 gene products. Cdc37 protein 
specifically interacts with Cdk4 and Cdk6, but not with Cdc2, Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk5 
and any of a number of cyclins tested. Cdc37 is not an inhibitor nor an 
activator of the Cdk4/cyclin D1 kinase, while it appears to facilitate complex 
assembly between Cdk4, and cyclin D1 in vitro. Cdc37 competes with p16 for 
binding to Cdk4, suggesting that p16 might exert part of its inhibitory function 
by affecting the formation of Cdk4/cyclin D1 complexes via Cdc37.
