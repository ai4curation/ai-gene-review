Many proteins contain a thioredoxin (Trx)-like domain fused with one or more 
partner domains that diversify protein function by the modular construction of 
new molecules. The Escherichia coli protein YbbN is a Trx-like protein that 
contains a C-terminal domain with low homology to tetratricopeptide repeat 
motifs. YbbN has been proposed to act as a chaperone or co-chaperone that aids 
in heat stress response and DNA synthesis. We report the crystal structure of 
YbbN, which is an elongated molecule with a mobile Trx domain and four atypical 
tetratricopeptide repeat motifs. The Trx domain lacks a canonical CXXC active 
site architecture and is not a functional oxidoreductase. A variety of proteins 
in E. coli interact with YbbN, including multiple ribosomal protein subunits and 
a strong interaction with GroEL. YbbN acts as a mild inhibitor of GroESL 
chaperonin function and ATPase activity, suggesting that it is a negative 
regulator of the GroESL system. Combined with previous observations that YbbN 
enhances the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperone system, we propose that YbbN coordinately 
regulates the activities of these two prokaryotic chaperones, thereby helping to 
direct client protein traffic initially to DnaK. Therefore, YbbN may play a role 
in integrating the activities of different chaperone pathways in E. coli and 
related bacteria.
