The insulin receptor is a dimeric protein that has a crucial role in controlling 
glucose homeostasis, regulating lipid, protein and carbohydrate metabolism, and 
modulating brain neurotransmitter levels. Insulin receptor dysfunction has been 
associated with many diseases, including diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer's 
disease. The primary sequence of the receptor has been known since the 1980s, 
and is composed of an extracellular portion (the ectodomain, ECD), a single 
transmembrane helix and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Binding of 
insulin to the dimeric ECD triggers auto-phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase 
domain and subsequent activation of downstream signalling molecules. Biochemical 
and mutagenesis data have identified two putative insulin-binding sites, S1 and 
S2. The structures of insulin bound to an ECD fragment containing S1 and of the 
apo ectodomain have previously been reported, but details of insulin binding to 
the full receptor and the signal propagation mechanism are still not understood. 
Here we report single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of the 
1:2 (4.3 Å) and 1:1 (7.4 Å) complexes of the insulin receptor ECD dimer with 
insulin. The symmetrical 4.3 Å structure shows two insulin molecules per dimer, 
each bound between the leucine-rich subdomain L1 of one monomer and the first 
fibronectin-like domain (FnIII-1) of the other monomer, and making extensive 
interactions with the α-subunit C-terminal helix (α-CT helix). The 7.4 Å 
structure has only one similarly bound insulin per receptor dimer. The 
structures confirm the binding interactions at S1 and define the full S2 binding 
site. These insulin receptor states suggest that recruitment of the α-CT helix 
upon binding of the first insulin changes the relative subdomain orientations 
and triggers downstream signal propagation.

## Full Text

The insulin receptor (IR) is a dimer of heterodimers ((αβ)2)5. The α subunit and the β-chain N-terminal ~190 residues are located on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane (Figure 1a) and together constitute the full IR ECD; the remainder of the β-chain includes a transmembrane helix, the juxtamembrane domain and the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Structures of the individual sub-domains comprising the ECD (L1, CR, L2, and fibronectin type III domains FnIII-1, 2 and 3) are known, and the crystal structure of the apo IR ECD8 provides one view of their quaternary organization. In the apo IR ECD structure, density for the insertion domain (120 residues located within FnIII-2, containing the cleavage site that generates the α and β chains, and the subunit α C-terminal helix, α-CT) was poor, and only a portion of α-CT helix was visible9,10. While only one (αβ) heterodimer is present in the asymmetric unit of the IR crystal structure, a symmetry generated tetramer ((αβ)2) was proposed to represent the biologically relevant form of the ECD8. We will refer to each individual (αβ) heterodimer as IR-monomer, and to the (αβ)2 tetramer as IR-dimer.

Current models of insulin binding to IR suggest two interaction sites on insulin, engaging with two binding sites (S1 and S2) on IR11. Binding is proposed to be in trans with each insulin interacting with S1 of one IR-monomer and S2 of the other. The bridging of these receptor binding sites constitutes the high affinity interactions, while low affinity interactions arise from single site occupancy. The high affinity interaction is characterized by a 6 -200 pM Kd for the solubilized and affinity purified full length receptor, while the low affinity interactions have Kds between 6 (for S1) and 400 nM (for S2)12. Binding of insulin to full length receptor shows multiple binding events and dissociations and/or multiple rearrangements within low and high affinity binding poses12. While receptor activation is caused by high affinity binding, the activation curve is complex and shows anti-cooperative binding13.

We report here the 4.3 Å resolution structure of the IR ECD in the presence of insulin obtained using single-particle cryoEM (Figure 1b,c). A pronounced preferred orientation of the complex in vitreous ice was overcome using a combination of tilted data collection14 and fast plunge speeds using the Spotiton instrument15,16. Further details are provided in the methods section. Three-dimensional classification of the cryoEM data identified a dimeric structure with two populations, in a ~4:1 ratio (Figure 2b and Extended Data Figure 1). The largest, Class 1, is characterized by a symmetrical “head” and a poorly resolved, apparently flexible “stalk”. Refinement Class 1 after masking out flexible portions of the stalk and applying C2 symmetry provided a reconstruction to 4.3 Å (Extended Data Figure 1 and 2). The electron density map allowed unambiguous identification of the L1, CR, L2, and FnIII-1 receptor domains, as well as the clear positioning of the insulin molecule and the α-CT helix (Figure 1b and 1c). Refinement of the data using C1 symmetry produced a lower resolution map (4.7 Å; Extended Data Figure 3) in which additional density, assigned to FnIII-2 was visible for one monomer (Extended Data Figures 4a and 5b).

The Class 1 structure shows two insulin molecules symmetrically bound per dimeric receptor. Although asymmetric binding was predicted for the full length receptor12, studies show that the soluble ECD binds two molecules of insulin each with a 3.5 nM Kd and a fast dissociation rate17. The symmetrical binding of both insulin molecules observed in the cryoEM map is consistent with these data. Each insulin is located between the L1 domain of one IR-monomer, the FnIII-1 domain of the other IR-monomer, and the α-CT helix (Figure 1c). Residues of the L1 subdomain and the α-CT helix, previously identified as essential for insulin binding by a variety of biochemical approaches13, have been proposed to represent the IR S1 site18. Structures of “S1 microreceptors” (containing L1, CR and a portion of the α-CT) in complex with insulin and insulin mimetics7 provided the first atomic details of some IR-insulin key interactions (Extended Data Table 1). In those structures insulin directly interacts with the IR L1 subdomain through only a small region of the B-helix, and most of the other IR residues that have been identified as essential for insulin binding (Extended Data Table 1) interact with the α-CT helix. Predicted interactions involving the C-terminal end of the insulin B-chain6 could not be confirmed because those residues were not resolved in the electron density map7. The cryoEM structure confirms the engagement of S1, including the interactions involving the C-terminus of the insulin B-chain which is now resolved. The C-terminal region of the B-chain in the bound form assumes a different conformation from that observed in the hormone free form (for example, PDB entry 1ZNI, Extended Data Figure 4c), allowing the B-chain core residues (Gly8-Cys19) to interact with the α-CT helix, confirming the so-called detachment model of insulin binding19. Although from the current map it is not possible to determine from which IR monomer each α-CT helix originates, the fact that each insulin interacts with residues belonging to both monomers supports the trans binding mode hypothesis.

The cryoEM structure identifies the S2 location (Extended Data Table 1) as the area of interactions between the IR sequences Pro495-Arg498 and Arg539-Asn541 (located within the FnIII-1 domain) and chain A of insulin (residues Glu4-Thr8 and Ile10). Earlier work suggested that these insulin residues interact with the S2 binding site6 but no IR partner residues were assigned. Interactions are observed between the α-CT helix residues Leu696-Lys703 and IR residues Gly346-Asn349 and Arg372-Tyr374 (L2 subdomain) and Arg498-Leu501 and Val570-Thr571 (FnIII-1 subdomain). Residues in L2 and FnIII-1 were correctly predicted as components of the IR S2 site20. Clinical mutations (S323L, F382V, K460E and N462S, all located within or near the L2 and FnIII-1 domain areas discussed above) result in impaired insulin binding or reduced signaling21-24. Further evidence that these regions represent S2 comes from Brandt et al.25 in which a truncated receptor formed from the L1, CR, L2, and FnIII-1 subdomains fused to the α-CT helix is shown to have insulin binding properties identical to those of the full ECD. A second possible location for the S2 site (at the junction of the FnIII-1 and FnIII-2 domains) was hypothesized from the crystallographic dimer structure of the insulin-free IR ECD8. Mutagenesis data provided some support for this assignment11. However, in the un-symmetrized map (Extended Data Figure 4a and 5b) in which the FnIII-2 is visible, the bound insulin is more than 50 Å from this predicted S2 (Extended Data Figure 4b), and located on the opposite side of the receptor.

Refinement of the data for the smaller Class 2 produced a 7.4 Å map (Figure 2 and Extended Data Figures 1 and 6). In this map, half of the “head” has an overall conformation similar to that observed in the Class 1 map, with visible α-CT helix and insulin density; the other half showed the L1-CR-L2 portion in a different conformation (Figure 2a), more open and characterized by less well-defined density. The IR model based on Class 1 map was rigid-body fitted into the Class 2 map, and only one insulin molecule and one α-CT helix were included in the final structure. The open side lacked both the insulin and the helix (Figure 2b). This conformation thus comprises both an insulin-bound monomer and an insulin-free monomer. Comparison of these structures suggests that binding of insulin induces both the closing of the top portion of the receptor (by rigid body motion of the L1-CR-L2 portion with respect to the FnIII-1 domain) and recruitment of the α-CT helix, contrary to a previously suggested mechanism in which the insulin molecule docks to a preformed harbor containing both the L1 and α-CT elements required for binding26.

The IR-dimer identified in the cryoEM analysis does not resemble the crystallographic symmetry generated dimer8. The relative arrangement of the two monomers in the cryoEM and crystallographic dimers differ, and transitioning between them requires major conformational changes and disruption of extensive surface interfaces, specifically the interactions between L1 and FnIII-2′ and their dimeric symmetry mates, and between L2, FnIII-1′ and their dimeric symmetry mates. (Figure 3a and Extended Data Figure 7). However, the overall conformation of the crystallographic monomer (PDB 4ZXB) is similar to the unbound monomer observed in the second cryoEM class (Figure 3b), suggesting that it could be a biologically relevant representation of the unbound IR monomer. Attempts to obtain a cryoEM reconstruction for the ECD in the absence of insulin (apo) proved unsuccessful as the particles showed a high degree of heterogeneity and many were smaller than expected, suggesting that the ECD dimer may be unstable in the absence of ligand. Comparing the unbound monomer from the crystal structure to the insulin-bound monomer from the cryoEM structure (Extended data Figure 8), it appears that the conformational change that occurs upon insulin binding can be described as two rotations. The first is a 35° rotation of the L2-CR-L1 domains with respect to the linker connecting the L2 and FnIII-1 domains (residues Ala466- E469); the second is a 55° swing of the CR-L1 pair (as a rigid body) around the Gly306-Lys310 linker between the CR and L2 domains (not resolved in the current structure). These domain movements are similar to the rotation and translation observed for the related EGFR family upon ligand binding27. Based on the comparison between unbound and bound receptor, it appears that the α-CT helix moves between ~55 Å (if we consider the helix from the same monomer) and ~70 Å (if we consider the α-CT coming from the other monomer). Figure 3c shows a schematic diagram of a possible insulin receptor transduction mechanism. It is likely that following the binding of the first insulin molecule, the large shift in position of the α-CT helix causes conformational changes in the ID-α domain of both monomers. The ID-α domain is disulfide bonded to FnIII-3 (Cys647-Cys860) and this connection (so called “signaling bridge”26) may induce further conformational changes in the FnIII-3 domain, thus triggering the downstream signal propagation.

MethodsRecombinant human Insulin Receptor/CD220 was obtained from R&D systems (catalog # 1544-IR-50/CF, https://www.rndsystems.com/products/recombinant-human-insulin-r-cd220-aa-28-944-protein-cf_1544-ir-cf), reconstituted in PBS (Phosphate buffered saline, pH=7.4) at 0.3 mg/ml (0.00293 mM), stored in 100 ul aliquots at -80, and used as is (without further purification). The R&D Systems protein was tested for insulin binding, using 125I-insulin competition and Surface Plasmon Resonance (below and Extended Data table 2). The measured potency and binding affinities agreed very well with values from the literature17,31. A coomassie stained SDS PAGE gel (Extended Data Figure 5) run on the sample shows the expected bands for the α- and β-chains. For both chains the apparent molecular weight is higher than the predicted one (82.9 kDa for the α subunit and 22.9 kDa for the β subunit), and the β subunit appears as three discrete bands. This has been previously observed32-34 and can be attributed to glycosylation (and to different states of glycosylation for the β subunit). The gel confirms the integrity of the sample used in the studies.Recombinant human insulin was obtained from the laboratories of Merck & Co. RHI is a commercially available material; a generic description for the bioprocess used in preparing it can be found in the paper by Johnson35. A stock solution (5.6 mg/ml, 0.969 mM) was made in HBS (10 mM Hepes pH=7.4, 150 mM NaCl) and stored at 4°C.IR ECD Competition Binding AssayHis tagged human insulin receptor ECD purified protein (R&D Systems) was bound to an anti-mouse IgG coated microplate via attachment to a mouse monoclonal anti-human IR capture antibody (R&D Systems). Varying concentrations of RHI were incubated with the IR ECD protein in the presence of [125I]-insulin (PerkinElmer (catalogue NEX420050UC)) (0.1 nM) overnight at 4°C in binding buffer (100 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.02% Triton X-100, pH 8). Plate washings with binding buffer were carried out after the antibody and protein capture steps and following ligand incubation. The amount of radio-ligand still bound to the IR ECD was determined with either a TopCount or a MicroBeta instrument using Microscint-40. Concentration response curves were generated and IC50 values calculated using a 4-parameter fit.IR ECD Direct Binding (SPR; Biacore) AssayHis tagged human insulin receptor ECD purified protein (R&D Systems) was immobilized to a Biacore CM5 chip via an anti-His antibody kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) following manufacturer instructions. RHI binding to the immobilized human IR ECD protein was achieved by varying the compound concentration in running buffer (1X HBS-EP, 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005 % P-20, pH 7.3) passed over the chip. General detection and data collection parameters for the Biacore T200 instrument were used to determine kon, koff and Kd values.Grid preparationSample for grid preparation was generated by mixing 100 μl of IR solution and 3 μl of insulin stock (for a final ratio IR:insulin of 1:10) followed by incubating on ice for at least one hour before making vitrified grids. Grid reproducibility and obtaining suitable ice thickness were issues encountered when using manual grid preparation. To address these issues, the samples were vitrified using a semi-automated Spotiton V1.0 robot15,16,36, a novel device for preparing cryoEM samples that uses piezo-electric dispensing to apply small (50pL) drops of sample across a “self-blotting” nanowire grid as it flies past en route to plunge into liquid ethane. The nanowire grids, manufactured in house, used either lacey carbon or lacey gold supports37; the gold support helps to optimize image quality when acquiring data with the grid tilted relative to the electron beam14,38. Tilted data collection was necessary to address highly preferred particle orientation observed during initial data collections. For the tilted data sets, nanowire gold substrate grids were plasma cleaned for 10 secs (O2 + H2). The sample was dispensed onto these grids in 50pL drops for a total of ~5 nL of sample dispensed in a stripe from top to bottom across each grid, before the grid was plunged into liquid ethane. The time between sample application to the grid and plunge into ethane was typically ~300 msecs. Subsequently, we modified the SpotItOn instrument to further reduce the time between sample application and plunge to be ~170 msecs. This modification was undertaken in an attempt to reduce the time the sample has to interact with the air-water interfaces in the thin liquid film prior to vitrification. These interactions are assumed to be the cause of preferred particle orientations39, and indeed the faster plunging speed resulted in grids that displayed markedly better particle distribution (paper in preparation), allowing for the collection of data at zero degrees tilt. Nanowire based, self-blotting grids with a lacey carbon supporting substrate were used for this purpose, following the same sample preparation methods described above.Data Collection and processingTilted data were collected on a Thermo-Fisher Titan Krios equipped with an energy filter and a Gatan K2 Counting camera; the microscope was operated at 300 kV and a nominal magnification of 105,000×, with a calibrated pixel size of 1.1 Å. The defocus ranged from −1 to −2.5 μm. Images were collected at a tilt angle of −30° to address the issue of preferred orientation identified during initial data collection14; exposure was set to 10 sec (40 frames/image), for a total dose of ~68 e−/Å2. A total of 6805 images were collected in three sessions using Leginon40. 3056 images were deemed suitable for further data processing. Frames were aligned using MotionCor241; global and per-particle CTF was calculated using gCTF42. Particle picking was done using Gautomatch (http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/) and resulted in 1,206,222 particles. All subsequent data processing (from 2D classification to final reconstruction) was done using Cryosparc43. After several cycles of 3D classification, 151,409 particles in one class were used to generate a 4.6 Å map with C2 symmetry (and a 5.6 Å map with C1 symmetry). 48,315 particles went into a second class and generated a C1 symmetry map at 7.4 Å resolution (Extended Data Figure 1). We note that less than 20% of particles originally selected contribute to the final 3D maps. This arises firstly from very liberal initial picking criteria that result in a high rate of false positives that are rejected during initial 2D classification (approximately 60%). Secondly, there is a possibility that a substantial fraction of the receptor is not complexed, or alternatively that there is a fast equilibrium between bound and unbound species that shows up as heterogeneity limiting the contribution of these particle to the 3D structure.Untilted data were collected on a Thermo-Fisher Titan Krios equipped with an energy filter and a Gatan K2 Counting camera; the microscope was operated at 300 kV and a nominal magnification of 105,000×, with a calibrated pixel size of 1.1 Å. The defocus ranged from −1 to −2.5 μm. Exposure was set to 10 sec (40 frames/image), for a total dose of ~66 e−/Å2. A total of 2487 images were collected in three sessions using Leginon40. 1526 images were deemed suitable for further data processing. Frames were aligned using MotionCor241; global and per-particle CTF was calculated using gCTF42. Particle picking was done using Gautomatch (http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/) and produced 348,930 particles. All subsequent data processing (from 2D classification to final reconstruction) was done using Cryosparc43. After several cycles of 3D classification, a set of 40,390 particles was identified, which produced a 4.7 Å Class 1 map after symmetrized homogeneous refinement. This set was merged with the 151,409 particles from the tilted Class 1 set. After a round of heterogeneous refinement, 147,436 particles were used to generate a 4.3 Å map with C2 symmetry (and a 4.7 Å map with C1 symmetry)(Extended Data Figure 1). The resolution of each reconstruction was determined by the gold standard Fourier shell correlation criterion in Cryosparc43 and Relion PostProcess44. The completeness of the maps was assessed by measuring the Euler angle orientation distribution (as calculated by Cryosparc43) and by evaluating each map 3D FSC14. (Extended Data Figures 2, 3, and 6). The quality of the map was confirmed by the ability to see separated β-strands and the presence of bulky side chains (Extended data figure 2f).Structure SolutionIndividual domains of the Insulin receptor (L1, CR, L2, and FnIII-1, from PDB entry 4xzb) were positioned into the initial 4.6 Å resolution map using Molrep45 and rigid-body refined using COOT46. The insulin and the α-CT helix were positioned by overlaying the microreceptor structure from PDB entry 3W119 onto the L1 domain of the complex and rigid body fitting them into the available density. The α-CT helix was manually extended, while the full insulin was built using as reference one of the monomers from PDB entry 1ZNI. The full structure was subjected to 5 cycles of global real-space refinement with NCS, rotamer, Ramachandran plot and C-beta deviations restraints enabled in Phenix47. This model was subsequently refined against the 4.3 Å map following the same real space refinement procedure in Phenix47. The resulting model is identical to the 4.6 Å model, but for the addition of the first 7 N-terminal residues (His1-Val7) to both receptor monomers, and contains residues His1-Asp591 and Lys691-Val720 (α-CT helix) for both of the IR monomers and residues Gly1-Lys21 of chain A and Phe1-Ala30 of chain B for both bound Insulins. Sugars were added to residues Asn16, Asn25, Asn111, Asn255, Asn397 and Asn418 of both monomers. The sugars were extracted from PDB entry 4ZXB. All subsequent, lower resolution models were generated by manually positioning the higher resolution structure onto the available density and rigid body refining the individual domains to their final position using COOT46. Subsequently, the structures were subjected to 5 cycles of global real-space refinement with rotamer, Ramachandran plot and C-beta deviations restraints enabled in Phenix47. The lack of definition for the FnIII-2 and especially FnIII-3 domains may be due to these regions intrinsic flexibility. While one FnIII-2 region was clearly visible in the un-symmetrized map, unstructured density that could be attributed to the remaining missing regions can be seen by contouring the maps at very low sigma (Extended Data Figure 5).Figure 2A and extended Figures 1C, 2E, 3E and 6E were generated with Chimera48; all other figures, unless otherwise specified, were generated with PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.8 Schrödinger, LLC).Data AvailabilityThe maps and coordinates generated and analyzed during the current study have been deposited with the EMDB and PDB, accession codes EMD-7462 (PDB 6CE9), EMD-7463 (PDB 6CEB), EMD-7461 (PDB 6CE7) for the 4.3 Å, 4.7 Å and 7.4 Å maps, respectively.

Subsequently, we modified the SpotItOn instrument to further reduce the time between sample application and plunge to be ~170 msecs. This modification was undertaken in an attempt to reduce the time the sample has to interact with the air-water interfaces in the thin liquid film prior to vitrification. These interactions are assumed to be the cause of preferred particle orientations39, and indeed the faster plunging speed resulted in grids that displayed markedly better particle distribution (paper in preparation), allowing for the collection of data at zero degrees tilt. Nanowire based, self-blotting grids with a lacey carbon supporting substrate were used for this purpose, following the same sample preparation methods described above.

Grid preparation

Sample for grid preparation was generated by mixing 100 μl of IR solution and 3 μl of insulin stock (for a final ratio IR:insulin of 1:10) followed by incubating on ice for at least one hour before making vitrified grids. Grid reproducibility and obtaining suitable ice thickness were issues encountered when using manual grid preparation. To address these issues, the samples were vitrified using a semi-automated Spotiton V1.0 robot15,16,36, a novel device for preparing cryoEM samples that uses piezo-electric dispensing to apply small (50pL) drops of sample across a “self-blotting” nanowire grid as it flies past en route to plunge into liquid ethane. The nanowire grids, manufactured in house, used either lacey carbon or lacey gold supports37; the gold support helps to optimize image quality when acquiring data with the grid tilted relative to the electron beam14,38. Tilted data collection was necessary to address highly preferred particle orientation observed during initial data collections. For the tilted data sets, nanowire gold substrate grids were plasma cleaned for 10 secs (O2 + H2). The sample was dispensed onto these grids in 50pL drops for a total of ~5 nL of sample dispensed in a stripe from top to bottom across each grid, before the grid was plunged into liquid ethane. The time between sample application to the grid and plunge into ethane was typically ~300 msecs. Subsequently, we modified the SpotItOn instrument to further reduce the time between sample application and plunge to be ~170 msecs. This modification was undertaken in an attempt to reduce the time the sample has to interact with the air-water interfaces in the thin liquid film prior to vitrification. These interactions are assumed to be the cause of preferred particle orientations39, and indeed the faster plunging speed resulted in grids that displayed markedly better particle distribution (paper in preparation), allowing for the collection of data at zero degrees tilt.

Data Collection and processingTilted data were collected on a Thermo-Fisher Titan Krios equipped with an energy filter and a Gatan K2 Counting camera; the microscope was operated at 300 kV and a nominal magnification of 105,000×, with a calibrated pixel size of 1.1 Å. The defocus ranged from −1 to −2.5 μm. Images were collected at a tilt angle of −30° to address the issue of preferred orientation identified during initial data collection14; exposure was set to 10 sec (40 frames/image), for a total dose of ~68 e−/Å2. A total of 6805 images were collected in three sessions using Leginon40. 3056 images were deemed suitable for further data processing. Frames were aligned using MotionCor241; global and per-particle CTF was calculated using gCTF42. Particle picking was done using Gautomatch (http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/) and resulted in 1,206,222 particles. All subsequent data processing (from 2D classification to final reconstruction) was done using Cryosparc43. After several cycles of 3D classification, 151,409 particles in one class were used to generate a 4.6 Å map with C2 symmetry (and a 5.6 Å map with C1 symmetry). 48,315 particles went into a second class and generated a C1 symmetry map at 7.4 Å resolution (Extended Data Figure 1). We note that less than 20% of particles originally selected contribute to the final 3D maps. This arises firstly from very liberal initial picking criteria that result in a high rate of false positives that are rejected during initial 2D classification (approximately 60%). Secondly, there is a possibility that a substantial fraction of the receptor is not complexed, or alternatively that there is a fast equilibrium between bound and unbound species that shows up as heterogeneity limiting the contribution of these particle to the 3D structure.Untilted data were collected on a Thermo-Fisher Titan Krios equipped with an energy filter and a Gatan K2 Counting camera; the microscope was operated at 300 kV and a nominal magnification of 105,000×, with a calibrated pixel size of 1.1 Å.

Particle picking was done using Gautomatch (http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/) and produced 348,930 particles. All subsequent data processing (from 2D classification to final reconstruction) was done using Cryosparc43. After several cycles of 3D classification, a set of 40,390 particles was identified, which produced a 4.7 Å Class 1 map after symmetrized homogeneous refinement. This set was merged with the 151,409 particles from the tilted Class 1 set. After a round of heterogeneous refinement, 147,436 particles were used to generate a 4.3 Å map with C2 symmetry (and a 4.7 Å map with C1 symmetry)(Extended Data Figure 1). The resolution of each reconstruction was determined by the gold standard Fourier shell correlation criterion in Cryosparc43 and Relion PostProcess44. The completeness of the maps was assessed by measuring the Euler angle orientation distribution (as calculated by Cryosparc43) and by evaluating each map 3D FSC14. (Extended Data Figures 2, 3, and 6). The quality of the map was confirmed by the ability to see separated β-strands and the presence of bulky side chains (Extended data figure 2f).

Structure SolutionIndividual domains of the Insulin receptor (L1, CR, L2, and FnIII-1, from PDB entry 4xzb) were positioned into the initial 4.6 Å resolution map using Molrep45 and rigid-body refined using COOT46. The insulin and the α-CT helix were positioned by overlaying the microreceptor structure from PDB entry 3W119 onto the L1 domain of the complex and rigid body fitting them into the available density. The α-CT helix was manually extended, while the full insulin was built using as reference one of the monomers from PDB entry 1ZNI. The full structure was subjected to 5 cycles of global real-space refinement with NCS, rotamer, Ramachandran plot and C-beta deviations restraints enabled in Phenix47. This model was subsequently refined against the 4.3 Å map following the same real space refinement procedure in Phenix47. The resulting model is identical to the 4.6 Å model, but for the addition of the first 7 N-terminal residues (His1-Val7) to both receptor monomers, and contains residues His1-Asp591 and Lys691-Val720 (α-CT helix) for both of the IR monomers and residues Gly1-Lys21 of chain A and Phe1-Ala30 of chain B for both bound Insulins. Sugars were added to residues Asn16, Asn25, Asn111, Asn255, Asn397 and Asn418 of both monomers. The sugars were extracted from PDB entry 4ZXB. All subsequent, lower resolution models were generated by manually positioning the higher resolution structure onto the available density and rigid body refining the individual domains to their final position using COOT46. Subsequently, the structures were subjected to 5 cycles of global real-space refinement with rotamer, Ramachandran plot and C-beta deviations restraints enabled in Phenix47.
