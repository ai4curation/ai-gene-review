DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification involved in 
transcriptional regulation, nuclear organization, development, aging, and 
disease. Although DNA methyltransferases have been characterized, the mechanisms 
for DNA demethylation remain poorly understood. Using a cell-based reporter 
assay, we performed a functional genomics screen to identify genes involved in 
DNA demethylation. Here we show that RNF4 (RING finger protein 4), a 
SUMO-dependent ubiquitin E3-ligase previously implicated in maintaining genome 
stability, plays a key role in active DNA demethylation. RNF4 reactivates 
methylation-silenced reporters and promotes global DNA demethylation. Rnf4 
deficiency is embryonic lethal with higher levels of methylation in genomic DNA. 
Mechanistic studies show that RNF4 interacts with and requires the base excision 
repair enzymes TDG and APE1 for active demethylation. This activity appears to 
occur by enhancing the enzymatic activities that repair DNA G:T mismatches 
generated from methylcytosine deamination. Collectively, our study reveals a 
unique function for RNF4, which may serve as a direct link between epigenetic 
DNA demethylation and DNA repair in mammalian cells.
