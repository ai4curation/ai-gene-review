Herpesvirus saimiri encodes a tyrosine kinase interacting protein (Tip) that 
binds to T-cell-specific tyrosine kinase Lck via multiple sequence motifs and 
controls its activity. The regulation of Lck by Tip represents a key mechanism 
in the transformation of human T-lymphocytes during herpesviral infection. In 
this study, the interaction of Tip with the regulatory SH3 and SH2 domains of 
Lck was investigated by biophysical and computational techniques. NMR 
spectroscopy of isotopically labeled Tip(140-191) revealed that the interaction 
with the LckSH3 domain is not restricted to the classical proline-rich motif, 
but also involves the C-terminally adjacent residues which pack into a 
hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the SH3 domain, thus playing a likely role 
in mediating binding specificity. Fluorescence binding studies of Tip further 
demonstrate that Tyr127 in its phosphorylated form represents a strong ligand of 
the LckSH2 domain, indicating the presence of an additional Lck interaction 
motif. In contrast, Tyr114, known to be essential for STAT-3 binding, does not 
interact with the LckSH2 domain, showing that the tyrosines in Tip exhibit 
distinct binding specificity. The existence of numerous interaction sites 
between Tip and the regulatory domains of Lck implies a complex regulatory 
mechanism and may have evolved to allow a gradual regulation of Lck activity in 
different pathogenic states.
