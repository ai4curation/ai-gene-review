Protein folding in the mitochondria is assisted by nuclear-encoded 
compartment-specific chaperones but regulation of the expression of their 
encoding genes is poorly understood. We found that the mitochondrial matrix 
HSP70 and HSP60 chaperones, encoded by the Caenorhabditis elegans hsp-6 and 
hsp-60 genes, were selectively activated by perturbations that impair assembly 
of multi-subunit mitochondrial complexes or by RNAi of genes encoding 
mitochondrial chaperones or proteases, which lead to defective protein folding 
and processing in the organelle. hsp-6 and hsp-60 induction was specific to 
perturbed mitochondrial protein handling, as neither heat-shock nor endoplasmic 
reticulum stress nor manipulations that impair mitochondrial steps in 
intermediary metabolism or ATP synthesis activated the mitochondrial chaperone 
genes. These observations support the existence of a mitochondrial unfolded 
protein response that couples mitochondrial chaperone gene expression to changes 
in the protein handling environment in the organelle.
