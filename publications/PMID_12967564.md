The transition from egg to embryo occurs in the absence of transcription yet 
requires significant changes in gene activity. Here, we show that the C. elegans 
DYRK family kinase MBK-2 coordinates the degradation of several maternal 
proteins, and is essential for zygotes to complete cytokinesis and pattern the 
first embryonic axis. In mbk-2 mutants, the meiosis-specific katanin subunits 
MEI-1 and MEI-2 persist during mitosis and the first mitotic division fails. 
mbk-2 is also required for posterior enrichment of the germ plasm before the 
first cleavage, and degradation of germ plasm components in anterior cells after 
cleavage. MBK-2 distribution changes dramatically after fertilization during the 
meiotic divisions, and this change correlates with activation of mbk-2-dependent 
processes. We propose that MBK-2 functions as a temporal regulator of protein 
stability, and that coordinate activation of maternal protein degradation is one 
of the mechanisms that drives the transition from symmetric egg to patterned 
embryo.
