We have undertaken to continue the proteomic study of human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells (HUVECs) using the combination of 2-DE, automated trypsin 
digestion, and PMF analysis after MALDI-TOF MS and peptide sequencing using nano 
LC-ESI-MS/MS. The overall functional characterization of the 162 identified 
proteins from primary cultures of HUVECs confirms the metabolic capabilities of 
endothelium and illustrates various cellular functions more related to cell 
motility and angiogenesis, protein folding, anti-oxidant defenses, signal 
transduction, proteasome pathway and resistance to apoptosis. In comparison with 
controls cells, the differential proteomic analysis of HUVECs treated by the 
pro-apoptotic topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide further revealed the variation 
of eight proteins, namely, GRP78, GRP94, valosin-containing protein, proteinase 
inhibitor 9, cofilin, 37-kDa laminin receptor protein, bovine apolipoprotein, 
and tropomyosin. These data suggest that etoposide-induced apoptosis of human 
vascular endothelial cells results from the intricate involvement of multiple 
apoptosis processes including at least the mitochondrial and the ER stress 
pathways. The presented 2-D pattern and protein database, as well as the data 
related to apoptosis of HUVECs, are available at http://www.huvec.com.
