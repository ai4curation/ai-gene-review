Small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO-1) conjugation to the tumor suppressor
protein p53 seems to be regulated by murine double minute 2 homologue (Mdm2). It
is thought that the physical association of Mdm2 with p53 is important for the
enhancement of SUMO-1 conjugation to p53. However, mutant p53 that does not
associate with Mdm2 is still sumoylated, albeit at a reduced level, suggesting
that sumoylation of p53 is independent of the presence of Mdm2 and there is a
direct association of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), an E2 ligase for
sumoylation, with p53. Here, we report evidence of the direct interaction of
Ubc9 with p53. Furthermore, we observed that the interaction of Ubc9 with p53
was regulated by phosphorylation of p53. In particular, in cells treated with
adriamycin that is a DNA damaging agent and that enhances phosphorylation of p53
at Ser-20, SUMO conjugation of p53 was severely impaired possibly by reduced
affinity of Ubc9 to p53.
