Early Drosophila development requires two receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) 
pathways: the Torso and the Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways, 
which regulate terminal and dorsal-ventral patterning, respectively. Previous 
studies have shown that these pathways, either directly or indirectly, lead to 
post-transcriptional downregulation of the Capicua repressor in the early embryo 
and in the ovary. Here, we show that both regulatory effects are direct and 
depend on a MAPK docking site in Capicua that physically interacts with the MAPK 
Rolled. Capicua derivatives lacking this docking site cause dominant phenotypes 
similar to those resulting from loss of Torso and EGFR activities. Such 
phenotypes arise from inappropriate repression of genes normally expressed in 
response to Torso and EGFR signaling. Our results are consistent with a model 
whereby Capicua is the main nuclear effector of the Torso pathway, but only one 
of different effectors responding to EGFR signaling. Finally, we describe 
differences in the modes of Capicua downregulation by Torso and EGFR signaling, 
raising the possibility that such differences contribute to the tissue 
specificity of both signals.

Abstract

Early Drosophila development requires two receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways: the Torso and the Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways, which regulate terminal and dorsal-ventral patterning, respectively. Previous studies have shown that these pathways, either directly or indirectly, lead to post-transcriptional downregulation of the Capicua repressor in the early embryo and in the ovary. Here, we show that both regulatory effects are direct and depend on a MAPK docking site in Capicua that physically interacts with the MAPK Rolled. Capicua derivatives lacking this docking site cause dominant phenotypes similar to those resulting from loss of Torso and EGFR activities. Such phenotypes arise from inappropriate repression of genes normally expressed in response to Torso and EGFR signaling. Our results are consistent with a model whereby Capicua is the main nuclear effector of the Torso pathway, but only one of different effectors responding to EGFR signaling. Finally, we describe differences in the modes of Capicua downregulation by Torso and EGFR signaling, raising the possibility that such differences contribute to the tissue specificity of both signals.

Introduction

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are a large family of cell surface receptors that translate extracellular signals into changes in gene expression and cellular function. Many RTKs signal through the evolutionarily conserved Ras/MAPK cassette, in which a cascade of interacting kinases ultimately leads to phosphorylation of nuclear transcription factors. As essentially the same Ras/MAPK cassette is used in multiple developmental contexts, a fundamental question has been how Ras/MAPK signals are interpreted to produce tissue-specific outputs ( Rommel and Hafen, 1998 ; Tan and Kim, 1999 ). Here, we investigate the responses of a single nuclear protein, Capicua, to two distinct RTK pathways during Drosophila development.

Patterning of the Drosophila embryo and its surrounding eggshell requires two different RTK pathways initiated by the transmembrane receptors Torso and Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The Torso pathway controls the specification of the most anterior and posterior (terminal) regions of the embryo ( Duffy and Perrimon, 1994 ; Furriols and Casanova, 2003 ). An extracellular signal produced during oogenesis activates Torso at each pole of the blastoderm embryo, leading to stimulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, and hence, to localized activation of the gap genes tailless ( tll ) and huckebein ( hkb ) in terminal positions ( Pignoni et al , 1990 ; Brönner and Jäckle, 1991 ; Duffy and Perrimon, 1994 ; Furriols and Casanova, 2003 ). Although regulation of tll and hkb at the anterior pole is complex and requires additional inputs from the anterior and dorsal-ventral (DV) maternal systems ( Pignoni et al , 1992 ; Brönner et al , 1994 ; Reuter and Leptin, 1994 ), the activation of tll and hkb at the posterior pole occurs mainly in response to the Torso pathway. This activation, however, is indirect and involves a mechanism of derepression: both genes are normally repressed in central regions of the embryo and the Torso signal counteracts this repression to permit localized tll and hkb transcription at the pole ( Liaw et al , 1995 ; Paroush et al , 1997 ; Jiménez et al , 2000 ). Repression of tll and hkb requires several nuclear factors such as the high-mobility group (HMG) protein Capicua (Cic) and the Groucho (Gro) corepressor. Embryos lacking maternally contributed Cic or Gro show derepression of tll and hkb towards the center of the embryo, which then leads to suppression of the thoracic and abdominal primordia ( Paroush et al , 1997 ; Jiménez et al , 2000 ). Cic has been proposed to be the target of the Torso inhibitory signal because the protein appears excluded from the embryo poles in a Torso-dependent manner ( Jiménez et al , 2000 ). However, it is not known whether this exclusion is direct, nor whether it is essential for the interpretation of the Torso signal.

Earlier in development, EGFR signaling also appears to establish antagonistic interactions with Cic. The EGFR pathway patterns the DV axis of both the embryo and the eggshell ( Ray and Schüpbach, 1996 ). During mid-oogenesis (stage 9), the Gurken ligand is secreted at the dorsal-anterior corner of the oocyte and activates the EGFR present in the adjacent somatic follicle cells, thus conferring to these cells a dorsal fate. Subsequently, the dorsal-anterior follicle cells secrete the dorsal respiratory appendages of the eggshell, whereas the ventral follicle cells produce an extracellular signal towards the oocyte that will specify the ventral regions of the embryo. Mutations that prevent EGFR signaling lead to ventralization of the eggshell and the embryo, whereas ectopic EGFR activation dorsalizes the egg ( Schüpbach, 1987 ; Queenan et al , 1997 ). Dorsalization phenotypes are also produced by several cic loss-of-function alleles, indicating that Cic normally prevents ventral and lateral follicle cells from acquiring a dorsal fate ( Goff et al , 2001 ; Atkey et al , 2006 ). Additionally, Cic has been reported to accumulate in the nucleus of follicle cells except in dorsal-anterior regions, where EGFR is active ( Goff et al , 2001 ). Again, the functional importance of this exclusion remains untested.

In this paper, we show that Cic is a direct nuclear target of the Torso and EGFR pathways. We identify a critical regulatory motif in Cic (designated C2) that functions as a MAPK docking site and interacts with Rolled, the MAPK acting in the Torso and EGFR pathways ( Biggs and Zipursky, 1992 ; Biggs et al , 1994 ; Brunner et al , 1994 ). Mutations in the C2 motif generate Cic derivatives that escape downregulation by Torso and EGFR signaling and produce phenotypes that resemble those resulting from the loss of Torso and EGFR function. These results indicate that Cic downregulation is essential for both terminal and DV patterning. We also describe differences in the modes of Cic downregulation by Torso and EGFR signaling and discuss the possible mechanisms underlying those Cic responses.

Discussion

The Torso and EGFR pathways regulate distinct aspects of early Drosophila development, such as the specification of embryonic terminal structures (Torso) and the establishment of DV polarity for both the embryo and the eggshell (EGFR). In this paper, we present evidence that both pathways exert their function, at least in part, by directly downregulating the Cic protein, and that these regulatory effects require a MAPK docking site in Cic (the C2 motif) that interacts with the MAPK Rolled. Below, we discuss the implications of these results for the role of Cic in terminal and DV patterning.
