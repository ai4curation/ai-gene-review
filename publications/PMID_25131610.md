Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) generated NO plays a crucial 
physiological role in the regulation of vascular tone. eNOS is a constitutively 
expressed synthase whose enzymatic function is regulated by dual acylation, 
phosphorylation, protein-protein interaction and subcellular localization. In 
endothelial cells, the enzyme is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus (GA) 
and the plasma membrane where it binds to caveolin-1. Upon stimulation, the 
enzyme is translocated from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm where it 
generates NO. When activation of eNOS ceases, the majority of the enzyme is 
recycled back to the membrane fraction. An inability of eNOS to cycle between 
the cytosol and the membrane leads to impaired NO production and vascular 
dysfunction. Chlamydia pneumoniae is a Gram-negative obligate intracellular 
bacterium that primarily infects epithelial cells of the human respiratory 
tract, but unlike any other chlamydial species, C. pneumoniae displays tropism 
toward atherosclerotic tissues. In this study, we demonstrate that C. pneumoniae 
inclusions colocalize with eNOS, and the microorganism interferes with 
trafficking of the enzyme from the GA to the plasma membrane in primary human 
aortic endothelial cells. This mislocation of eNOS results in significant 
inhibition of NO release by C. pneumoniae-infected cells. Furthermore, we show 
that the distribution of eNOS in C. pneumoniae-infected cells is altered due to 
an intimate association of the Golgi complex with chlamydial inclusions rather 
than by direct interaction of the enzyme with the chlamydial inclusion membrane.
