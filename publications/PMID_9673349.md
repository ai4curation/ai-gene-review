Differential display technique was applied to a pair of cell lines derived from 
human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB 435 with metastatic and non-metastatic 
properties in the nude mouse system, with the objective to isolate genes 
involved in metastasis. DRIM (Down-Regulated In Metastasis) was the only gene 
found to be differentially expressed in this system. DRIM encodes a protein 
comprising 2785 amino acids with significant homology to a protein in yeast and 
C. elegans. The protein contains a conserved positively charged tail and several 
HEAT repeats, designated after four functionally characterized proteins in which 
the repeat was detected. Most of the hydrophobic regions of DRIM can be assigned 
to HEAT repeats. Expression of DRIM at the RNA level was investigated in several 
normal tissues and tumor cell lines.
