Using a bioinformatic approach, we identified a TP53INP1-related gene encoding a 
protein with 30% identity with tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1 
(TP53INP1), which was named TP53INP2. TP53INP1 and TP53INP2 sequences were found 
in several species ranging from Homo sapiens to Drosophila melanogaster, but 
orthologues were found neither in earlier eukaryotes nor in prokaryotes. To gain 
insight into the function of the TP53INP2 protein, we carried out a yeast 
two-hybrid screening that showed that TP53INP2 binds to the LC3-related proteins 
GABARAP and GABARAP-like2, and then we demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation 
that TP53INP2 interacts with these proteins, as well as with LC3 and with the 
autophagosome transmembrane protein VMP1. TP53INP2 translocates from the nucleus 
to the autophagosome structures after activation of autophagy by rapamycin or 
starvation. Also, we showed that TP53INP2 expression is necessary for 
autophagosome development because its small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown 
strongly decreases sensitivity of mammalian cells to autophagy. Finally, we 
found that interactions between TP53INP2 and LC3 or the LC3-related proteins 
GABARAP and GABARAP-like2 require autophagy and are modulated by wortmannin as 
judged by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays. We suggest that 
TP53INP2 is a scaffold protein that recruits LC3 and/or LC3-related proteins to 
the autophagosome membrane by interacting with the transmembrane protein VMP1. 
It is concluded that TP53INP2 is a novel gene involved in the autophagy of 
mammalian cells.

INTRODUCTION

Tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1), also known as TEAP, SIP and p53DINP1, is a recently described factor involved in cell stress response ( Tomasini et al. , 2001 ). TP53INP1 expression is induced by p53 ( Tomasini et al. , 2002 ; Okamura et al. , 2001 ) and exerts its function mainly by inducing transcription of target genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, as part of the cell response to genotoxic stress ( Tomasini et al. , 2003 ). Mechanistically, TP53INP1 interacts with p53 ( Tomasini et al. , 2003 ) and kinases that phosphorylate p53 (HIPK2 and PKCδ) ( Tomasini et al. , 2003 ; Yoshida et al. , 2006 ), contributing to p53 activity regulation leading to apoptosis ( Tomasini et al. , 2003 ). TP53INP1 expression is up-regulated in different cell types upon treatment with agents inducing cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis and overexpression of TP53INP1 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, even in the absence of p53 ( Tomasini et al. , 2001 ). In that case p73 or E2F1 transcription factors, which both play a role in cell proliferation and apoptosis, seem to be implicated ( Hershko et al. , 2005 ; Tomasini et al. , 2005 ). Altogether, currently available data point to a role of TP53INP1 in cellular homeostasis by its antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities in cell response against cellular stress. Finally, TP53INP1 could be considered as a putative tumor suppressor gene because TP53INP1 -deficient mice are more susceptible to develop tumors by a mechanism involving free radicals ( Gommeaux et al. , 2007 ; Cano et al. , 2008 ).

Using a bioinformatic approach, we identified a TP53INP1 -related gene encoding a protein with 30% amino acid identity and 45% similarity with TP53INP1. This gene, located at chromosome 20q11.2 ( Nowak et al. , 2005 ), is well conserved through evolution. Interestingly, based on its chromosomal localization, TP53INP2 gene was a candidate for recessive nonprogressive infantile ataxia, although this hypothesis was eventually ruled out ( Fowles et al. , 2003 ; Bennetts et al. , 2006 , 2007 ). To gain insight into the function of the TP53INP2 protein, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screening and found that it interacts with LC3-related proteins GABARAP and GABARAP-like2. These proteins are involved in several processes related to intracellular vesicle formation and transport, including autophagy ( Tanida et al. , 2004 ). In this article, we report that the TP53INP2 protein plays a major role in mammalian cell autophagy.

DISCUSSION

Autophagy is an evolutionarily preserved degradation process of cytoplasmic constituents that serves as a survival mechanism in starved cells ( Yorimitsu and Klionsky, 2005 ). This catabolic process probably plays a protective role in aging, cell death, defense against intracellular pathogens, neurodegenerative diseases and tumorigenesis, which highlights its biological and medical importance ( Shintani and Klionsky, 2004 ). Most of the detailed molecular mechanistic work on autophagy has been carried out in yeast to show that a series of factors are involved in the sequential steps of this process ( Levine and Klionsky, 2004 ). Recent studies have reported new factors involved in mammalian autophagy regulation ( Liang et al. , 2006 ). Yet, autophagosome formation in higher eukaryotes is a complex process and neither the mechanism of vesicle formation nor all the implicated genes are known. In this study, we show that TP53INP2 is a new autophagic factor that binds to and allows inclusion of LC3 and LC3-related GABARAP and GABARAP-like2 proteins into autophagic vacuoles. LC3 is an autophagosomal orthologue of yeast Atg8. A lipidated form of LC3, named LC3-II, is essential for autophagy and is used as an autophagosomal marker in mammals (reviewed in Tanida et al. , 2004 ). The other LC3-related homologues, GABARAP and GABARAP-like2 proteins are also modified by the same mechanism, their role in autophagy being assumed but not completely understood (reviewed in Tanida et al. , 2004 ).

In this work, we demonstrate that 1) TP53INP1 and TP53INP2 are homologous sequences found in several species, ranging from H. sapiens to D. melanogaster , but no orthologue was found in earlier eukaryotes or prokaryotes; 2) TP53INP2 binds to LC3 as well as to LC3-related proteins GABARAP and GABARAP-like2; 3) this interaction is autophagy-dependent because it is stimulated by autophagy enhancers and reduced by the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin; 4) TP53INP2 binds to the autophagosome transmembrane protein VMP1 but not to beclin 1; 5) the protein translocates from the nucleus to the autophagosome after activation of autophagy by rapamycin or starvation. The mechanism requires a PI3-kinase activity and is dependent on Atg5 expression; and 6) TP53INP2 expression is necessary for autophagosome development. Together, these data strongly suggest that TP53INP2 is a novel gene involved in autophagy, with a function already established in Drosophila with the ancestral TP53INP.

We investigated the role of TP53INP2 in autophagy. We found that when TP53INP2 was knocked down in vitro, LC3 and LC3-related proteins were not recruited to the autophagosomes induced by rapamycin or starvation. This has two possible explanations: 1) TP53INP2, by its binding to LC3 and LC3-related proteins, is necessary for their recruitment to the autophagosome through its interaction with the autophagosome transmembrane protein VMP1; and 2) TP53INP2 is necessary for autophagosome formation or development by a way independent from its interaction with LC3 or LC3-related proteins. Another interesting point is that knocking down TP53INP2 prevented the recruitment of beclin 1 to the rapamycin- or starvation-induced autophagosome, although that protein does not bind directly to TP53INP2. Beclin 1 binding to PI3-kinase ( Liang et al. , 2006 ) is required for autophagosome development. An integrative hypothesis could be that beclin 1, through its PI3-kinase–associated activity ( Kihara et al. , 2001 ), allows autophagosome development after binding to VMP1 ( Ropolo et al. , 2007 ) provided LC3 (or LC3-related proteins) are located near the autophagosome membrane ( Tanida et al. , 2004 ). A proautophagic stimulus induces the formation of a complex between TP53INP2 and LC3 (or LC3-related proteins). TP53INP2, acting as a scaffold protein, is integrated at the preautophagosome surface through its binding to the transmembrane protein VMP1. In the absence of TP53INP2 (after TP53INP2 siRNA treatment), LC3 is not recruited to the proautophagosome membrane, which prevents further expansion. Thus, proautophagosomes remaining undetectable, which accounts for the absence of visible beclin 1 immunostaining.

We analyzed the regulation in the living cell of the interactions between TP53INP2 and LC3 or LC3-related proteins. We performed coimmunoprecipitations between TP53INP2 and LC3 and LC3-related proteins in control cells or after a treatment with EBSS that induces autophagy, and we found no significant differences (data not shown). This was not a complete surprise because coimmunoprecipitation tests require cell lysis followed by long incubation times with antibodies. During that process, proteins previously stored in different cellular compartments are allowed to interact. To circumvent this problem we used another technique, named BRET, which allows real time quantitation of protein interactions in living cells under experimental conditions. BRET can occur when two compatible optical probes are brought into proximity (50–80 Å). To probe for an interaction between two given partner proteins, each protein is genetically fused to the blue light emitting humanized Renilla luciferase (donor), and to a blue light absorbing yellow fluorescent protein (acceptor), respectively. If the two hybrid proteins interact, the emission energy of the luciferase can be transferred to the fluorescent protein, resulting in an easily detected yellow-shift in the luminescence spectrum. Using this approach, we found that the studied interactions were enhanced after induction of autophagy but inhibited by treatment with the PI3-kinase inhibitor agent wortmannin (an autophagy inhibitor), indicating that these interactions are essentially controlled by the status of autophagy.

We recently proposed that TP53INP1 is a tumor suppressor gene because it is involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis ( Tomasini et al. , 2001 ). It is a target of p53 but can also enhance p53 activity ( Okamura et al. , 2001 ; Tomasini et al. , 2002 , 2003 ), and its deficiency is associated with increases tumor development in mice ( Gironella et al. , 2007 ; Gommeaux et al. , 2007 ). In spite of its homology with TP53INP1, TP53INP2 is not a tumor suppressor per se, because it is apparently not induced by p53 (data not shown) and its forced overexpression did not alter the cell cycle or apoptosis (data not shown). However, our data suggest that TP53INP2 could actually be involved in the control of tumor development through its capacity at modulating autophagy, because cellular autophagic activity is inversely correlated with malignancy and autophagy is even suppressed in many cancer cells ( Ogier-Denis and Codogno, 2003 , Levine, 2007 ). We found in a preliminary set of experiments that TP53INP1, like TP52INP2, could bind LC3 and LC3-related proteins and that its knocking down by specific siRNAs inhibited the formation of autophagosomes that occurs after treatment of the cells by starvation or rapamycin. Inhibition was not as strong as when TP53INP2 was targeted (data not shown), but yet it was significant, suggesting that TP53INP1 is also involved in the development of autophagy. Another interesting point is that TP53INP2, which is expressed during development in the nervous system, could be involved in neuronal development. During mouse development, its spatiotemporal expression correlates with that of activating molecule in beclin1-regulated autophagy 1 protein (Ambra1). Ambra1 is a vertebrate gene that regulates autophagy, suggesting a novel role for autophagy in neurodevelopment ( Fimia et al. , 2007 ).

In conclusion, we report that a novel nuclear factor, named TP53INP2, is absolutely required for autophagy development. Our results strongly suggest that TP53INP2 is a scaffold protein that recruits LC3 and the LC3-related proteins GABARAP and GABARAP-like2 and brings them to the autophagosome membrane by interacting with the VMP1 transmembrane protein where, in cooperation with the beclin 1-PI3-kinase class III complex, they trigger autophagosome development.
