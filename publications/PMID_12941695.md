Cdc25C-associated kinase 1 (C-TAK1) has been implicated in cell cycle regulation 
and Ras signaling through its interactions with two putative substrates, the 
Cdc25C phosphatase and the MAPK scaffold KSR1. Here, we identify sequence motifs 
required for stable C-TAK1 association and substrate phosphorylation. Using a 
mutational approach to disrupt binding of C-TAK1 to KSR1 and Cdc25C, we 
demonstrate that C-TAK1 contributes to the regulation of these proteins in vivo 
through the generation of 14-3-3-binding sites. KSR1 proteins defective in 
C-TAK1 binding had severely reduced phosphorylation at the 14-3-3-binding site 
in vivo, were constitutively localized to the plasma membrane and had increased 
biological activity. Disruption of the Cdc25C-C-TAK1 interaction resulted in 
reduced 14-3-3-binding site phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of Cdc25C 
in interphase cells. Finally, utilizing the acquired C-TAK1 binding and 
substrate phosphorylation data, we identify plakophilin 2 (PKP2) as a novel 
C-TAK1 substrate. Phosphorylation of PKP2 by C-TAK1 also generates a 
14-3-3-binding site that influences PKP2 localization. These findings underscore 
the importance of C-TAK1 as a regulator of 14-3-3 binding and protein 
localization.
