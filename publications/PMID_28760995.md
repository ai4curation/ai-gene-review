Light signals regulate plant growth and development by controlling a plethora of 
gene expression changes. Posttranscriptional regulation, especially pre-mRNA 
processing, is a key modulator of gene expression; however, the molecular 
mechanisms linking pre-mRNA processing and light signaling are not well 
understood. Here we report a protein related to the human splicing factor 45 
(SPF45) named splicing factor for phytochrome signaling (SFPS), which directly 
interacts with the photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB). In response to light, 
SFPS-RFP (red fluorescent protein) colocalizes with phyB-GFP in photobodies. 
sfps loss-of-function plants are hyposensitive to red, far-red, and blue light, 
and flower precociously. SFPS colocalizes with U2 small nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein-associated factors including U2AF65B, U2A', and U2AF35A in 
nuclear speckles, suggesting SFPS might be involved in the 3' splice site 
determination. SFPS regulates pre-mRNA splicing of a large number of genes, of 
which many are involved in regulating light signaling, photosynthesis, and the 
circadian clock under both dark and light conditions. In vivo RNA 
immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays revealed that SFPS associates with EARLY 
FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) mRNA, a critical link between light signaling and the 
circadian clock. Moreover, PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) transcription 
factor genes act downstream of SFPS, as the quadruple pif mutant pifq suppresses 
defects of sfps mutants. Taken together, these data strongly suggest SFPS 
modulates light-regulated developmental processes by controlling pre-mRNA 
splicing of light signaling and circadian clock genes.

Abstract

Light signals regulate plant growth and development by controlling a plethora of gene expression changes. Posttranscriptional regulation, especially pre-mRNA processing, is a key modulator of gene expression; however, the molecular mechanisms linking pre-mRNA processing and light signaling are not well understood. Here we report a protein related to the human splicing factor 45 (SPF45) named splicing factor for phytochrome signaling (SFPS), which directly interacts with the photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB). In response to light, SFPS-RFP (red fluorescent protein) colocalizes with phyB-GFP in photobodies. sfps loss-of-function plants are hyposensitive to red, far-red, and blue light, and flower precociously. SFPS colocalizes with U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated factors including U2AF65B, U2A′, and U2AF35A in nuclear speckles, suggesting SFPS might be involved in the 3′ splice site determination. SFPS regulates pre-mRNA splicing of a large number of genes, of which many are involved in regulating light signaling, photosynthesis, and the circadian clock under both dark and light conditions. In vivo RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays revealed that SFPS associates with EARLY FLOWERING 3 ( ELF3 ) mRNA, a critical link between light signaling and the circadian clock. Moreover, PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS ( PIFs ) transcription factor genes act downstream of SFPS, as the quadruple pif mutant pifq suppresses defects of sfps mutants. Taken together, these data strongly suggest SFPS modulates light-regulated developmental processes by controlling pre-mRNA splicing of light signaling and circadian clock genes.

Discussion

This study provides strong genetic, molecular, and photobiological evidence in support of a role for SFPS as a positive regulator of phytochrome signaling pathways. To date, of the many genes with ascribed roles in phytochrome signaling, only RRC1 encodes a splicing factor with an SR domain ( 17 , 27 ). rrc1 and sfps display similar phenotypes, including long hypocotyl under red light and early flowering, although sfps phenotypes appear stronger than rrc1 ( 17 ). In addition, sfps also displays long hypocotyl under blue light conditions, suggesting that, unlike RRC1 , SFPS might play a broad role in photomorphogenesis. Moreover, two of the five mutants impaired in circadian clock and splicing (e.g., skip and prmt5 ) display photomorphogenic defects ( 20 – 22 , 24 – 26 ). sfps displays a marginally short period phenotype based on luciferase reporter assays under free-running conditions, indicating SFPS plays a much stronger role in regulating photomorphogenesis than the circadian clock. Thus, it is possible that SFPS and RRC1 splicing factors function in the same pathway, or in parallel to regulate photomorphogenesis and transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. Future analyses of single and double mutants will help understand whether SFPS and RRC1 function in the same pathway.

SFPS is very similar in sequence to human and Drosophila splicing factors SPF45 ( 29 , 30 ). SPF45-like proteins are encoded by all animal and plant genomes analyzed so far, suggesting a conserved function in regulating splicing. SFPS-GFP shows a characteristic localization within nuclear speckles, where it is found together with nuclear splicing factors including U2AF65B, U2A′, and U2AF35A. These factors form a complex with U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein and function in 3′ SS determination in animals. SFPS-GFP associates with ELF3 pre-mRNA in a RIP assay, demonstrating that SFPS can bind specific mRNAs in vivo. Overall, these data strongly suggest SFPS functions as a splicing factor, likely in 3′ SS determination in Arabidopsis .

We surprisingly found that SFPS regulates pre-mRNA splicing of as many genes in the dark as it does in the light (787 genes in dark vs. 827 genes under light), which is at first glance inconsistent with the light-dependent phenotypes of sfps . However, GO analyses revealed that both dark- and light-regulated AS pattern genes are enriched in genes regulating responses to light stimuli, photosynthesis, and the circadian clock. Thus, SFPS does not control the pre-mRNA splicing only under light conditions, but also under darkness to regulate photomorphogenesis. SFPS modulates the transcriptome both in the dark and light in a way that properly responds to the ambient light signal.

Splicing of the early flowering 3 ( ELF3 ) pre-mRNA is under the control of SFPS and likely one of its main targets. elf3 and sfps share qualitatively similar phenotypes including long hypocotyl under light and early flowering. ELF3 functions as part of the evening complex that regulates the expression of PIF4 and PIF5 under diurnal conditions. This regulation contributes to rhythmic diurnal hypocotyl elongation, with maximal growth coinciding with PIF4 and PIF5 peak expression at the end of the night. However, despite strong defects in pre-mRNA splicing of ELF3 transcript in the sfps mutant and direct binding of SFPS to ELF3 pre-mRNA in vivo, transgenic expression of ELF3 in the sfps mutant closer to a wild-type level failed to rescue the sfps phenotypes in the light. In contrast, a simple epistasis analysis between pifq and sfps clearly places PIFs downstream of SFPS in the control of photomorphogenesis. These data suggest the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing of ELF3 alone may not be sufficient to account for the phenotypes of sfps ; rather, the defects in pre-mRNA splicing of multiple genes in the light signaling and circadian clock pathways contribute to the phenotypes of sfps .

Although SFPS affects pre-mRNA splicing of many light-signaling genes to promote photomorphogenesis, the biochemical mechanisms by which SFPS regulates this process remain unknown. Phytochromes physically interact with diverse groups of factors, including PIFs, and regulate their abundance and/or activity ( 27 ). In fact, phytochromes regulate PIF function in two distinct ways ( 10 ). First, direct physical interactions between phytochromes and PIFs result in rapid light-induced phosphorylation, poly-ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation of PIFs in part through CUL4 COP1-SPA and CUL3 LRB E3 ubiquitin ligases ( 38 , 39 ). Alternatively, phyB directly interacts with PIFs and sequesters PIFs from their function ( 40 ). Although we observed direct physical interaction between SFPS with phyB in vivo, and SFPS and phyB colocalizes to photobodies, immunoblots and qPCR assays showed that SFPS protein abundance and transcription are not regulated by light. Thus, phytochromes might regulate SFPS activity by sequestration and/or by posttranslational modification. The animal ortholog to SFPS is phosphorylated ( 41 , 42 ). In addition, phytochromes possess kinase activity ( 43 , 44 ). Therefore, phytochromes might regulate the activity of SFPS by phosphorylation in response to light. Further experiments are necessary to examine this hypothesis.

Various models have been proposed to explain the function of photobody formation by phytochromes in response to light ( 7 , 8 ). These include storage of active phytochromes, site of degradation of phytochrome signaling components (e.g., PIFs), and site of transcription complex for rapid gene expression in response to light signals. Our data showing the colocalization of a splicing factor with phyB in nuclear photobodies suggest the photobodies might also be a site for storage and/or modification of splicing factors to regulate pre-mRNA splicing in response to light. Thus, phytochromes might form different types of photobodies specialized for each function. The size, timing, and overall dynamics of photobody formation in response to light support this hypothesis.

Phytochromes control the transcription of a large number of genes by regulating the activity and/or abundance of a diverse group of transcription factors including PIFs and HY5 ( Fig. 9 ). In addition, we have shown here that phytochromes also regulate splicing of many light-signaling genes by directly affecting the activity of splicing factors such as SFPS. The coordinated control of transcription as well as splicing of light-regulated genes promotes photomorphogenesis.
