Fibronectin is a modular extracellular matrix protein involved in cell adhesion, 
cell motility, wound healing, and maintenance of cell morphology. It is composed 
of multiple repeats of three distinct modules: F(I), F(II), and F(III). Various 
combinations of these modules create fragments able to interact with different 
constituents of the extracellular matrix. Here, we present the 2.5-A resolution 
crystal structure of its 45-kDa gelatin-binding domain (GBD; 
6F(I)-1F(II)-2F(II)-7F(I)-8F(I)-9F(I)), which also corresponds to the C-terminal 
half of the migration stimulating factor, a Fn splice variant expressed in human 
breast cancers. GBD forms a very compact zinc-mediated homodimer, in stark 
contrast with previous structures of fibronectin fragments. Most remarkably, 
8F(I) no longer adopts the canonical F(I) fold but is composed of two long 
strands that associate with 7F(I) and 9F(I) into a large beta-sheet superdomain. 
Binding studies in solution confirmed that Zn induces conformational 
rearrangements and causes loss of binding of Fn-GBD to high-affinity collagen 
peptides. These data suggest the Zn may play a regulatory role for the cellular 
functions of fibronectin.
