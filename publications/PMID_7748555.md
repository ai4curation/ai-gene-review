The gene defective in Huntington's disease encodes a protein, huntingtin, with 
unknown function. Antisera generated against three separate regions of 
huntingtin identified a single high molecular weight protein of approximately 
320 kDa on immunoblots of human neuroblastoma extracts. The same protein species 
was detected in human and rat cortex synaptosomes and in sucrose density 
gradients of vesicle-enriched fractions, where huntingtin immunoreactivity 
overlapped with the distribution of vesicle membrane proteins (SV2, transferrin 
receptor, and synaptophysin). Immunohistochemistry in human and rat brain 
revealed widespread cytoplasmic labeling of huntingtin within neurons, 
particularly cell bodies and dendrites, rather than the more selective pattern 
of axon terminal labeling characteristic of many vesicle-associated proteins. At 
the ultrastructural level, immunoreactivity in cortical neurons was detected in 
the matrix of the cytoplasm and around the membranes of the vesicles. The 
ubiquitous cytoplasmic distribution of huntingtin in neurons and its association 
with vesicles suggest that huntingtin may have a role in vesicle trafficking.
