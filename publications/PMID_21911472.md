A growing body of evidence suggests that Nrf1 is an inducible transcription 
factor that maintains cellular homeostasis. Under physiological conditions, Nrf1 
is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), implying that it translocates 
into the nucleus in response to an activating signal. However, the molecular 
mechanisms by which the function of Nrf1 is modulated remain poorly understood. 
Here, we report that two distinct degradation mechanisms regulate Nrf1 activity 
and the expression of its target genes. In the nucleus, β-TrCP, an adaptor for 
the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase, promotes the degradation of 
Nrf1 by catalyzing its polyubiquitination. This activity requires a DSGLS motif 
on Nrf1, which is similar to the canonical β-TrCP recognition motif. The short 
interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of β-TrCP markedly augments the 
expression of Nrf1 target genes, such as the proteasome subunit PSMC4, 
indicating that β-TrCP represses Nrf1 activation. Meanwhile, in the cytoplasm, 
Nrf1 is degraded and suppressed by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) 
ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 and valosin-containing protein (VCP) under normal 
conditions. We identified a cytoplasmic degradation motif on Nrf1 between the 
NHB1 and NHB2 domains that exhibited species conservation. Thus, these results 
clearly suggest that both β-TrCP- and Hrd1-dependent degradation mechanisms 
regulate the transcriptional activity of Nrf1 to maintain cellular homeostasis.
