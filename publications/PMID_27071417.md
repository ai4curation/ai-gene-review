Inherited and de novo mutations in the CARD14 gene promote the development of 
psoriasis, an inflammatory disease of the skin. Caspase recruitment 
domain-containing protein 14 (CARD14) is a member of the CARMA protein family 
that includes the structurally related CARD11 adaptor that mediates NF-κB 
activation by antigen receptors. We investigated the mechanism by which CARD14 
mutation in psoriasis activates NF-κB. In contrast with wild-type CARD14, 
CARD14(E138A) and CARD14(G117S) psoriasis mutants interacted constitutively with 
BCL10 and MALT1, and triggered BCL10- and MALT1-dependent activation of NF-κB in 
keratinocytes. These alterations disrupted the inhibitory effect of the CARD14 
linker region (LR) on NF-κB activation by facilitating BCL10 binding. Therefore, 
psoriasis mutations activated CARD14 by a mechanism analogous to oncogenic 
CARD11 mutations in non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas. CARD14(E138A) also stimulated 
MALT1 paracaspase activity and activated both ERK1/2 and p38α MAP kinases. 
Inhibition of MALT1 with mepazine reduced CARD14(E138A)-induced expression of 
specific psoriasis-associated transcripts in keratinocytes. Our results 
establish the mechanism whereby gain-of-function CARD14 variants, which induce 
psoriatic disease in affected individuals, activate pro-inflammatory signalling.
