RUNX proteins are evolutionarily conserved transcription factors known to be 
involved in various developmental processes. Here we report a new role for a 
RUNX protein: a role in stress response. We show that RNT-1, the Caenorhabditis 
elegans RUNX homolog, is constantly produced and degraded by the 
ubiquitination-proteasome pathway in the intestine of the nematode. RNT-1 was 
rapidly stabilized by oxidative stress, and the rnt-1-mutant animals were more 
sensitive to oxidative stress, indicating that rapid RNT-1 stabilization is a 
defense response against the oxidative stress. The MAP kinase pathway is 
required for RNT-1 stabilization, and RNT-1 was phosphorylated by SEK-1/PMK-1 in 
vitro. ChIP-sequencing analysis revealed a feedback loop mechanism of the MAP 
kinase pathway by the VHP-1 phosphatase in the RNT-1-mediated oxidative stress 
response. We propose that rnt-1 is regulated at the protein level for its role 
in the immediate response to environmental challenges in the intestine.
