Many tumor cells escape anti-tumor immunity through their expression of 
programmed death ligand-1 (PDL1 or B7-H1), which interacts with T cell-expressed 
PD1 and results in T cell apoptosis. We previously reported that transfection of 
human tumor cells with a membrane-bound form of the human costimulatory molecule 
CD80 prevented PD1 binding and restored T cell activation. We now report that a 
membrane-bound form of murine CD80 similarly reduces PDL1-PD1-mediated 
suppression by mouse tumor cells and that a soluble protein consisting of the 
extracellular domains of human or mouse CD80 fused to the Fc domain of IgG1 
(CD80-Fc) overcomes PDL1-mediated suppression by human and mouse tumor cells, 
respectively. T cell activation experiments with human and mouse tumor cells 
indicate that CD80-Fc facilitates T cell activation by binding to PDL1 to 
inhibit PDL1-PD1 interactions and by costimulating through CD28. CD80-Fc is more 
effective in preventing PD1-PDL1-mediated suppression and restoring T cell 
activation compared with treatment with mAb to either PD1 or PDL1. These studies 
identify CD80-Fc as an alternative and potentially more efficacious therapeutic 
agent for overcoming PDL1-induced immune suppression and facilitating 
tumor-specific immunity.
