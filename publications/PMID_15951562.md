The tumor suppressor phosphatase PTEN is a key regulator of cell growth and 
apoptosis that interacts with PDZ domains from regulatory proteins, including 
MAGI-1/2/3, hDlg, and MAST205. Here we identified novel PTEN-binding PDZ domains 
within the MAST205-related proteins, syntrophin-associated serine/threonine 
kinase and MAST3, characterized the regions of PTEN involved in its interaction 
with distinctive PDZ domains, and analyzed the functional consequences on PTEN 
of PDZ domain binding. Using a panel of PTEN mutations, as well as PTEN chimeras 
containing distinct domains of the related protein TPTE, we found that the PTP 
and C2 domains of PTEN do not affect PDZ domain binding and that the C-terminal 
tail of PTEN (residues 350-403) provides selectivity to recognize specific PDZ 
domains from MAGI-2, hDlg, and MAST205. Binding of PTEN to the PDZ-2 domain from 
MAGI-2 increased PTEN protein stability. Furthermore, binding of PTEN to the PDZ 
domains from microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinases facilitated PTEN 
phosphorylation at its C terminus by these kinases. Our results suggest an 
important role for the C-terminal region of PTEN in the selective association 
with scaffolding and/or regulatory molecules and provide evidence that PDZ 
domain binding stabilizes PTEN and targets this tumor suppressor for 
phosphorylation by microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinases.
