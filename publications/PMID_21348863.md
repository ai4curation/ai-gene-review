Proteins often exist as ensembles of interconverting states in solution which 
are often difficult to quantify. In the present manuscript we show that the 
combination of MS under nondenaturing conditions and AUC-SV (analytical 
ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity) unambiguously clarifies a 
distribution of states and hydrodynamic shapes of assembled oligomers for the 
NAP-1 (nucleosome assembly protein 1). MS established the number of associated 
units, which was utilized as input for the numerical analysis of AUC-SV 
profiles. The AUC-SV analysis revealed that less than 1% of NAP-1 monomer exists 
at the micromolar concentration range and that the basic assembly unit consists 
of dimers of yeast or human NAP-1. These dimers interact non-covalently to form 
even-numbered higher-assembly states, such as tetramers, hexamers, octamers and 
decamers. MS and AUC-SV consistently showed that the formation of the higher 
oligomers was suppressed with increasing ionic strength, implicating 
electrostatic interactions in the formation of higher oligomers. The 
hydrodynamic shapes of the NAP-1 tetramer estimated from AUC-SV agreed with the 
previously proposed assembly models built using the known three-dimensional 
structure of yeast NAP-1. Those of the hexamer and octamer could be represented 
by new models shown in the present study. Additionally, MS was used to measure 
the stoichiometry of the interaction between the human NAP-1 dimer and the 
histone H2A-H2B dimer or H3-H4 tetramer. The present study illustrates a 
rigorous procedure for the analysis of protein assembly and protein-protein 
interactions in solution.
