CONTEXT: Heterozygous, de novo mutations in the transcription factor SOX2 are 
associated with bilateral anophthalmia or severe microphthalmia and 
hypopituitarism. Variable additional abnormalities include defects of the corpus 
callosum and hippocampus.
OBJECTIVE: We have ascertained a further three patients with severe eye defects 
and pituitary abnormalities who were screened for mutations in SOX2. To provide 
further evidence of a direct role for SOX2 in hypothalamo-pituitary development, 
we have studied the expression of the gene in human embryonic tissues.
RESULTS: All three patients harbored heterozygous SOX2 mutations: a deletion 
encompassing the entire gene, an intragenic deletion (c.70_89del), and a novel 
nonsense mutation (p.Q61X) within the DNA binding domain that results in 
impaired transactivation. We also show that human SOX2 can inhibit 
beta-catenin-driven reporter gene expression in vitro, whereas mutant SOX2 
proteins are unable to repress efficiently this activity. Furthermore, we show 
that SOX2 is expressed throughout the human brain, including the developing 
hypothalamus, as well as Rathke's pouch, the developing anterior pituitary, and 
the eye.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SOX2 mutations often manifest the unusual phenotype 
of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, with sparing of other pituitary hormones 
despite anterior pituitary hypoplasia. SOX2 expression patterns in human 
embryonic development support a direct involvement of the protein during 
development of tissues affected in these individuals. Given the critical role of 
Wnt-signaling in the development of most of these tissues, our data suggest that 
a failure to repress the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway could be one of the underlying 
pathogenic mechanisms associated with loss-of-function mutations in SOX2.
