Missense mutants that cause the immune disorder Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) 
map primarily to the Enabled/VASP homology 1 (EVH1) domain of the actin 
regulatory protein WASP. This domain has been implicated in both peptide and 
phospholipid binding. We show here that the N-WASP EVH1 domain does not bind 
phosphatidyl inositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate, as previously reported, but does 
specifically bind a 25 residue motif from the WASP Interacting Protein (WIP). 
The NMR structure of the complex reveals a novel recognition mechanism-the WIP 
ligand, which is far longer than canonical EVH1 ligands, wraps around the 
domain, contacting a narrow but extended surface. This recognition mechanism 
provides a basis for understanding the effects of mutations that cause WAS.
