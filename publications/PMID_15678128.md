The tumor suppressor gene p53 plays an important role in the regulation of 
apoptosis through transcriptional activation of cell cycle control. Degradation 
of p53 hinders its role in apoptosis regulation. Recent studies have shown that 
MDM2-mediated ubiquitylation and the ubiquitin-proteasome system are critical 
regulating systems of p53 ubiquitylation. However, the mechanism regulating 
p53-mediated neuronal apoptosis after cerebral ischemia remains unknown. We 
examined the MDM2 pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasome system using a transient 
focal cerebral ischemia (tFCI) model and analyzed the interaction between p53 
regulation and superoxide using copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) 
transgenic mice after tFCI. p53 degradation and ubiquitylation were detected 
after tFCI. The accumulation of ubiquitylated p53 was inhibited and p53 
degradation was facilitated by SOD1. Nuclear translocation and MDM2/Akt 
interaction were detected after tFCI and were inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase inhibition and promoted by SOD1. Cytosolic translocation of the 
p53/MDM2 complex was detected after tFCI and was promoted by SOD1. Moreover, 
accumulation of multiubiquitin chains and direct oxidative injury to a 
proteasome were detected and inhibited by SOD1 after tFCI. These results suggest 
that SOD1 promotes the MDM2 pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasome system after 
tFCI and that production of reactive oxygen species after tFCI prevents p53 
degradation by inhibiting both systems.
