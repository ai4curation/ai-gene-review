The gene encoding carboxypeptidase yscS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CPS1, was 
cloned by complementation of the cps1-3 mutation. The cloned CPS1 gene, which 
again enabled a leucine auxotrophic cps1-3 mutant to grow on the modified 
dipeptide Cbz-Gly-Leu (Cbz, benzyloxycarbonyl) as sole leucine source, was 
sequenced and found to consist of an open reading frame of 1728 bp encoding a 
protein of 576 amino acids. The putative protein contains a hydrophobic stretch 
of 20 amino acids and a putative signal sequence cleavage site. Five putative 
N-glycosylation sites are also in the protein sequence. This data is consistent 
with the previous finding of carboxypeptidase yscS being a vacuolar peptidase. 
Chromosomal disruption of the CPS1 gene completely abolishes carboxypeptidase 
yscS activity. This protein is yet another member of the peptidases in S. 
cerevisiae involved in nitrogen metabolism.
