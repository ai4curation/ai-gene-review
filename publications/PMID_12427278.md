Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1) is a nuclear enzyme involved in DNA metabolism, such 
as replication, repair, and recombination. Here, we report the comparative 
genomic organization of the chicken, mouse, and human FEN1 genes as well as the 
comparative organization of a small gene (C11orf10) located immediately upstream 
of the FEN1 gene in reverse orientation. Immunostaining revealed that the 
C11orf10 protein, unlike FEN-1, is located in the cytoplasm, suggesting that 
these two proteins do not form a physical complex. Importantly, in the human 
genome, the two mRNAs are overlapping (14 bp) in their 5' ends. Thus, the 
FEN1/C11orf10 locus is a new example of two overlapping, divergent transcription 
units in the human genome.
