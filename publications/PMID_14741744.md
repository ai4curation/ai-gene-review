Recent studies have revealed the presence of intracellular lipid droplets in 
wide variety of species. In mammalian cells, there exist proteins specifically 
localize in lipid droplets. However, the protein profile in the droplet remains 
yet to be clarified. In this study, a fraction enriched with lipid droplets was 
isolated from a human hepatocyte cell line HuH7 using sucrose density gradient 
centrifugation, and 17 major proteins in the fraction were identified using nano 
LC-MS/MS techniques. Adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) was the most 
abundant protein in the fraction. The secondary abundant proteins were 
identified to be acyl-CoA synthetase 3 (ACS3) and 17beta-hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase 11 (17betaHSD11). Included in the identified proteins were five 
lipid-metabolizing enzymes as well as two lipid droplet-specific proteins. When 
HuH7 cell lysate was fractionated by a density gradient, most of 17betaHSD11 was 
found in the droplet-enriched fraction. In immunocytochemical analysis, 
17betaHSD11 showed ring-shaped images which overlapped with those for ADRP. 
These results suggest that a specific set of proteins is enriched in the lipid 
droplet-enriched fraction and that 17betaHSD11 localizes specifically in the 
fraction.
