The mechanisms that tightly control the transcription of host defense genes have 
not been fully elucidated. We previously identified TFEB as a transcription 
factor important for host defense, but the mechanisms that regulate TFEB during 
infection remained unknown. Here, we used C. elegans to discover a pathway that 
activates TFEB during infection. Gene dkf-1, which encodes a homolog of protein 
kinase D (PKD), was required for TFEB activation in nematodes infected with 
Staphylococcus aureus. Conversely, pharmacological activation of PKD 
was sufficient to activate TFEB. Furthermore, phospholipase C (PLC) gene plc-1 
was also required for TFEB activation, downstream of Gαq homolog egl-30 and 
upstream of dkf-1. Using reverse and chemical genetics, we discovered a similar 
PLC-PKD-TFEB axis in Salmonella-infected mouse macrophages. In addition, PKCα 
was required in macrophages. These observations reveal a previously unknown host 
defense signaling pathway, which has been conserved across one billion years of 
evolution.
