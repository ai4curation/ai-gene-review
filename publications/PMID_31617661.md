A number of unique proteases localize to specific sub-compartments of the 
mitochondria, but the functions of these enzymes are poorly defined. Here, in 
vivo proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) is used to map the interactomes 
of seven proteases localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). In 
total, 802 high confidence proximity interactions with 342 unique proteins are 
identified. While all seven proteases co-localized with the IMS markers OPA1 and 
CLPB, 230 of the interacting partners are unique to just one or two protease 
bait proteins, highlighting the ability of BioID to differentiate unique 
interactomes within the confined space of the IMS. Notably, high-temperature 
requirement peptidase 2 (HTRA2) interacts with eight of 13 components of the 
mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex, a multiprotein 
assembly essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial cristae structure. 
Knockdown of HTRA2 disrupts cristae in HEK 293 and OCI-AML2 cells, and leads to 
increased intracellular levels of the MIB subunit IMMT. Using a cell-free assay 
it is demonstrated that HTRA2 can degrade recombinant IMMT but not two other 
core MIB complex subunits, SAMM50 and CHCHD3. The IMS protease interactome thus 
represents a rich dataset that can be mined to uncover novel IMS protease 
biology.
