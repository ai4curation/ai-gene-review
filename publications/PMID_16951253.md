The transformation potential of Simian Virus 40 depends on the activities of 
large T-antigen (LTag), which interacts with several cellular tumor suppressors 
including the important "guardian" of the genome, p53. Inhibition of p53 
function by LTag is necessary for both efficient viral replication and cellular 
transformation. We determined the crystal structure of LTag in complex with p53. 
The structure reveals an unexpected hexameric complex of LTag binding six p53 
monomers. Structure-guided mutagenesis of LTag and p53 residues supported the 
p53-LTag interface defined by the complex structure. The structure also shows 
that LTag binding induces dramatic conformational changes at the DNA-binding 
area of p53, which is achieved partially through an unusual "methionine switch" 
within p53. In the complex structure, LTag occupies the whole p53 DNA-binding 
surface and likely interferes with formation of a functional p53 tetramer. In 
addition, we showed that p53 inhibited LTag helicase function through direct 
complex formation.

Abstract

The transformation potential of Simian Virus 40 depends on the activities of large T-antigen (LTag), which interacts with several cellular tumor suppressors including the important “guardian” of the genome, p53. Inhibition of p53 function by LTag is necessary for both efficient viral replication and cellular transformation. We determined the crystal structure of LTag in complex with p53. The structure reveals an unexpected hexameric complex of LTag binding six p53 monomers. Structure-guided mutagenesis of LTag and p53 residues supported the p53–LTag interface defined by the complex structure. The structure also shows that LTag binding induces dramatic conformational changes at the DNA-binding area of p53, which is achieved partially through an unusual “methionine switch” within p53. In the complex structure, LTag occupies the whole p53 DNA-binding surface and likely interferes with formation of a functional p53 tetramer. In addition, we showed that p53 inhibited LTag helicase function through direct complex formation.

Discussion

Many tumor viruses target p53 for inhibition as an important mechanism to overtake cellular growth control, illustrating the critical role of p53 in maintaining the normal cell division cycle. In this study, we describe the crystal structure of the protein complex of SV40 LTag oncoprotein and p53 tumor suppressor. This structure presents the detailed bonding interactions between LTag and p53 and provides a molecular explanation for how LTag inhibits p53 function through specific protein–protein interactions. In addition, the crystal structure also confirms many prior hypotheses and biochemical observations about the LTag–p53 interactions that play an important role in cell transformation resulting from the virus infection.
