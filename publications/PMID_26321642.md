Cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain, is assembled 
from mitochondria- and nuclear-encoded subunits. The MITRAC complex represents 
the central assembly intermediate during this process as it receives imported 
subunits and regulates mitochondrial translation of COX1 mRNA. The molecular 
processes that promote and regulate the progression of assembly downstream of 
MITRAC are still unknown. Here, we identify MITRAC7 as a constituent of a late 
form of MITRAC and as a COX1-specific chaperone. MITRAC7 is required for 
cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis. Surprisingly, loss of MITRAC7 or an increase in 
its amount causes selective cytochrome c oxidase deficiency in human cells. We 
demonstrate that increased MITRAC7 levels stabilize and trap COX1 in MITRAC, 
blocking progression in the assembly process. In contrast, MITRAC7 deficiency 
leads to turnover of newly synthesized COX1. Accordingly, MITRAC7 affects the 
biogenesis pathway by stabilizing newly synthesized COX1 in assembly 
intermediates, concomitantly preventing turnover.
