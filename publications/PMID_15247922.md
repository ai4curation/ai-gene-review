Epithelial cells have separate apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains 
with distinct compositions. After delivery to one surface, proteins can be 
endocytosed and then recycled, degraded or transcytosed to the opposite surface. 
Proper sorting into the transcytotic pathway is essential for maintaining 
polarity, as most proteins are endocytosed many times during their lifespan. The 
polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) transcytoses polymeric IgA (pIgA) from 
the basolateral to the apical surface of epithelial cells and hepatocytes. 
However, the molecular machinery that controls polarized sorting of pIgR-pIgA 
and other receptors is only partially understood. The retromer is a multimeric 
protein complex, originally described in yeast, which mediates intracellular 
sorting of Vps10p, a receptor that transports vacuolar enzymes. The yeast 
retromer contains two sub-complexes. One includes the Vps5p and Vps17p subunits, 
which provide mechanical force for vesicle budding. The other is the 
Vps35p-Vps29p-Vps26p subcomplex, which provides cargo specificity. The mammalian 
retromer binds to the mannose 6-phosphate receptor, which sorts lysosomal 
enzymes from the trans-Golgi network to the lysosomal pathway. Here, we show a 
function for the mammalian Vps35-Vps29-Vps26 retromer subcomplex in promoting 
pIgR-pIgA transcytosis.
