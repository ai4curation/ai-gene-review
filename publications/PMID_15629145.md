Keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase 
expressed on epithelial cells which belongs to the family of fibroblast growth 
factor receptors (FGFRs). Following ligand binding, KGFR is rapidly 
autophosphorylated on specific tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain, 
recruits substrate proteins, and is rapidly internalized by clathrin-mediated 
endocytosis. The role of different autophosphorylation sites in FGFRs, and in 
particular the role of the tyrosine 766 in FGFR1, first identified as PLCgamma 
binding site, has been extensively studied. We analyzed here the possible role 
of the tyrosine 769 in KGFR, corresponding to tyrosine 766 in FGFR1, in the 
regulation of KGFR signal transduction and MAPK activation as well as in the 
control of the endocytic process of KGFR. A mutant KGFR in which tyrosine 769 
was substituted by phenylalanine was generated and transfected in NIH3T3 and 
HeLa cells. Our results indicate that tyrosine 769 is required for the binding 
to KGFR and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCgamma as well as for the full 
activation of MAPKs and for cell proliferation through the regulation of FRS2 
tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that this residue represents a key 
regulator of KGFR signal transduction. Our data also show that tyrosine 769 is 
not involved in the regulation of the endocytic process of KGFR.
