Chronic treatment with the dopamine (DA) agonist B-HT 920 (0.25-1 mg/kg) or 
bromocriptine (1 mg/kg) followed by morphine (10 mg/kg) on days 1-9 prevented 
the development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effect of morphine as 
measured by the tail-flick test in mice, but failed to suppress the development 
of morphine dependence as assessed by naloxone (2 mg/kg)-precipitated withdrawal 
jumps on day 10 of testing. Repeated administration of SKF 38393 (5 mg/kg) 
followed by morphine for 9 days significantly reduced naloxone-precipitated 
jumps on day 10 but failed to produce any significant change in tail-flick 
latency from the saline-pretreated group of mice on days 9 and 10 of testing. 
Repeated administration of B-HT 920 or bromocriptine enhanced the ability of 
MK-801 to attenuate the development of morphine tolerance and dependence while 
SKF 38393 failed to do so. The above data suggest a preferential role of D2 DA 
receptors in morphine tolerance and D1 receptors in the development of morphine 
dependence. D2 DA receptor stimulation may also play an important role in 
enhancing the effectiveness of MK-801 in the treatment of opiate tolerance and 
dependence.
