Visceral adiposity in obesity causes excessive free fatty acid (FFA) flux into 
the liver via the portal vein and may cause fatty liver disease and hepatic 
insulin resistance. However, because animal models of insulin resistance induced 
by lipid infusion or a high fat diet are complex and may be accompanied by 
alterations not restricted to the liver, it is difficult to determine the 
contribution of FFAs to hepatic insulin resistance. Therefore, we treated 
H4IIEC3 cells, a rat hepatocyte cell line, with a monounsaturated fatty acid 
(oleate) and a saturated fatty acid (palmitate) to investigate the direct and 
initial effects of FFAs on hepatocytes. We show that palmitate, but not oleate, 
inhibited insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor 
substrate 2 and serine phosphorylation of Akt, through c-Jun NH(2)-terminal 
kinase (JNK) activation. Among the well established stimuli for JNK activation, 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) played a causal role in palmitate-induced JNK 
activation. In addition, etomoxir, an inhibitor of carnitine 
palmitoyltransferase-1, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in mitochondrial fatty 
acid beta-oxidation, as well as inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory 
chain complex (thenoyltrifluoroacetone and carbonyl cyanide 
m-chlorophenylhydrazone) decreased palmitate-induced ROS production. Together, 
our findings in hepatocytes indicate that palmitate inhibited insulin signal 
transduction through JNK activation and that accelerated beta-oxidation of 
palmitate caused excess electron flux in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, 
resulting in increased ROS generation. Thus, mitochondria-derived ROS induced by 
palmitate may be major contributors to JNK activation and cellular insulin 
resistance.

## Full Text

Insulin is the major hormone that inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver.
 Visceral adiposity in obesity causes hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance.
 In an insulin-resistant state, impaired insulin action allows enhancement of
 glucose production in the liver, resulting in systemic hyperglycemia
 (1) and contributing to the
 development of type 2 diabetes. In addition, we have demonstrated
 experimentally that insulin resistance accelerated the pathology of
 steatohepatitis in genetically obese diabetic OLETF rats
 (2). In contrast, lipid-induced
 oxidative stress caused steatohepatitis and hepatic insulin resistance in mice
 (3). In fact, steatosis of the
 liver is an independent predictor of insulin resistance in patients with
 nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
 (4).

It remains unclear whether hepatic steatosis causally contributes to
 insulin resistance or whether it is merely a resulting pathology. Excessive
 dietary free fatty acid
 (FFA)2 flux into the
 liver via the portal vein may cause fatty liver disease and hepatic insulin
 resistance. Indeed, elevated plasma FFA concentrations correlate with obesity
 and decreased target tissue insulin sensitivity
 (5).

Experimentally, lipid infusion or a high fat diet that increases
 circulating FFA levels promotes insulin resistance in the liver. Candidate
 events linking FFA to insulin resistance in vivo are the
 up-regulation of SREBP-1c (6),
 inflammation caused by activation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK)
 (7) or IKKβ
 (8), endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
 stress (9), ceramide
 (10,
 11), and TRB3
 (12).

However, which event is the direct and initial target of FFA in the liver
 is unclear. Insulin resistance induced by lipid infusion or a high fat diet is
 complex and may be accompanied by alterations not restricted to the liver,
 making it difficult to determine the contribution of FFAs to hepatic insulin
 resistance. For example, hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia secondary to the
 initial event also may contribute to the development of diet-induced insulin
 resistance in vivo
 (6).

To address the early event(s) triggering the development of high fat diet-
 or obesity-induced insulin resistance, we investigated the molecular
 mechanism(s) underlying the direct action of FFA on hepatocytes to cause
 insulin resistance in vitro, using the rat hepatocyte cell line
 H4IIEC3. We found that mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) were
 a cause of palmitate-induced insulin resistance in hepatocytes.

 in the rat hepatoma cell line H4IIEC3, purchased from the American Type
 Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified
 Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
 (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml;
 Invitrogen). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere
 containing 5% CO2, with medium changes three times a week. All
 studies were conducted using 80–90% confluent cells, which were treated
 with the indicated concentrations of FFAs in the presence of 2% FFA-free
 bovine serum albumin (Sigma).Cell Harvest and Western Blot Analysis—H4IIEC3 hepatocytes,
 grown to 80–90% confluence in 6-well plates, were treated with the
 indicated reagents for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After
 treatment, the cells were stimulated with insulin (1 ng/ml) for 15 min. Then
 the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in
 buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 1%
 Nonidet P-40, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm
 NaF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After sonication with a
 Bioruptor (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan), the lysates were centrifuged to remove
 insoluble materials. The supernatants (10 μg/lane) were separated by
 SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore,
 Billerica, MA). For detection of phosphotyrosine insulin receptor and
 phosphotyrosine IRS-2, the supernatants (400 μgof protein) were
 immunoprecipitated with a phosphotyrosine antibody and protein G beads for 2 h
 at 4 °C before SDS-PAGE. The membranes were blocked in a buffer containing
 5% nonfat milk, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and
 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature. They were then incubated
 with specific primary antibodies and subsequently with horseradish
 peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies. Signals were detected with a
 chemiluminescence detection system (ECL Plus Western blotting detection
 reagents; GE Healthcare). Densitometric analysis was conducted directly on the
 blotted membrane, using a CCD camera system (LAS-3000 Mini; Fujifilm, Tokyo,
 Japan) and Scion Image software.Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from
 cultured H4IIEC3 hepatocytes using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germantown,
 MD), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was synthesized from
 total RNA (100 ng) using random hexamer primers, N6, and a high
 capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
 Quantitative real time PCR was performed with an ABI Prism 7900HT (Applied
 Biosystems). The set of specific primers and TaqMan probes in the present
 study was obtained from Applied Biosystems. The PCR conditions were one cycle
 at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95
 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min.Analysis of XBP-1 (X-box-binding Protein-1) mRNA
 Splicing—Total RNA was extracted from H4IIEC3 hepatocytes, and cDNA

 primers (reverse 5′-CCA TGG GAA GAT GTT CTG GG-3′ and forward
 5′-ACA CGC TTG GGG ATG AAT GC-3′) corresponding to the rat XBP-1
 cDNA. The PCR conditions were initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min,
 followed by 30 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30
 s, 72 °C for 30 s) and a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR
 products were separated by 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.FIGURE 3.Effect of a JNK inhibitor on palmitate-induced alterations in

 < 0.01 versus palmitate treatment.Measurement of Intracellular ROS—The intracellular formation
 of ROS was detected using the fluorescent probe H2DCFDA, according
 to a published method (13).
 Briefly, H4IIEC3 hepatocytes, grown to 70–80% confluence in 96-well
 plates, were treated with the indicated reagents in Dulbecco's modified
 Eagle's medium for 8 h. After treatment, the cells were washed with
 phosphate-buffered saline, loaded with 10 μm H2DCFDA,
 and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The fluorescence was analyzed using a
 plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent FL, ThermoLab Systems, Franklin, MA).Measurement of Protein Carbonyls—The cellular concentration
 of proteins containing carbonyl groups (those that react with
 2,4-di-nitrophenylhydrazine to form the corresponding hydrazone) was
 determined spectrophotometrically using a protein carbonyl assay kit (Cayman
 Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as
 described previously (14).Statistical Analysis—All values are given as means ±
 S.E. Differences between two groups were assessed using unpaired, two-tailed
 t tests. Data involving more than two groups were assessed by one-way
 analysis of variance. All calculations were performed with SPSS (version 12.0

RESULTSPalmitate Inhibited Insulin Receptor-mediated Signaling—Two
 long chain fatty acids were chosen for the study: palmitate, a C16:0 saturated
 fatty acid, and oleate, a C18:1 monounsaturated fatty acid. To examine whether
 FFAs impaired insulin signal transduction in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes, we assessed
 the effect of FFAs on insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 and
 serine phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3α
 (Fig. 1). Incubation with 0.25
 mm palmitate inhibited insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation
 of IRS-2 by 40% in H4IIEC3 cells. Downstream of IRS-2, insulin-stimulated
 serine phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3α were also inhibited by 0.25
 mm palmitate treatment, by 80 and 70%, respectively, indicating an
 insulin-resistant state. However, the protein levels of total IRS-2, Akt, and
 GSK-3 were unaffected by palmitate. Furthermore, we confirmed that palmitate,
 but not oleate, impaired insulin-stimulated Akt serine phosphorylation in the
 human hepatoma cell line HepG2 (supplemental Fig. 1).JNK Activation by Palmitate Contributes to Palmitate-induced Insulin
 Resistance—JNK, a stress-activated protein kinase, has been
 reported to phosphorylate IRS-1 and -2 at serine residues
 (15,
 16). Serine phosphorylation of
 IRSs impairs IRS tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to a reduction in insulin
 receptor-mediated signaling. Many studies have verified the role of JNK in
 fat-induced insulin resistance in several experimental systems
 (7,
 17,
 18). Thus, we next examined
 the effect of FFAs on JNK activation and its involvement in insulin signaling.
 Palmitate, but not oleate, dramatically increased phosphorylated JNK and c-Jun
 (Fig. 2). A potent and
 selective inhibitor of JNK, SP600125
 (19), reversed the
 palmitate-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun
 (Fig. 2), suggesting that
 palmitate activated JNK. To test whether palmitate-induced JNK activation
 mediated cellular insulin resistance, we inhibited the JNK pathway with
 SP600125. SP600125 dose-dependently improved insulin-stimulated serine
 phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes exposed to palmitate
 (Fig. 3). These results suggest
 that JNK activation by palmitate contributed to palmitate-induced insulin
 resistance.FIGURE 4.Effect of palmitate on oxidative stress in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes.
 H4IIEC3 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of palmitate

 Palmitate-induced JNK Activation and Insulin Resistance in H4IIEC3
 Hepatocytes—The SREBP-1c pathway has been reported to play a role
 in diet-induced insulin resistance in vivo. Ide et al.
 (6) found that high sucrose
 diet-induced hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia up-regulated hepatic
 expression of SREBP-1c, leading to down-regulation of IRS-2 at the
 transcriptional level. However, in the present study, palmitate dramatically
 down-regulated the expression of SREBP-1c in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes (supplemental
 Fig. 2). Consistent with this, the mRNA (supplemental Fig. 2) and protein
 (Fig. 1) levels of IRS-2 were
 unaffected by palmitate. Thus, palmitate itself did not appear to cause
 insulin resistance in hepatocytes via the SREBP-1c pathway.FIGURE 5.Effects of antioxidants on palmitate-induced intracellular ROS

 2 diabetes, and in turn, this stress has been shown to lead to the inhibition
 of insulin signaling, through overactivation of JNK
 (9). Since excessive FFAs have
 been shown to trigger ER stress in pancreatic β-cells
 (20), we examined whether
 palmitate caused ER stress in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes. ER stress induces the
 spliced form of XBP-1 (XBP-1s), which up-regulates the transcription of
 molecular chaperones, including GRP78 (78-kDa glucose-regulated/binding
 immunoglobulin protein) (21).
 Palmitate at 0.25 mm did not alter the expression level of GRP78
 mRNA or the splicing pattern of XBP-1, unlike tunicamycin, an agent commonly
 used to induce ER stress (supplemental Fig. 3). Next, we compared the impact
 of palmitate and tunicamycin on insulin-stimulated signal transduction and JNK
 activation (supplemental Fig. 4). The inhibitory effect of tunicamycin on
 insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of Akt was mild and not significant
 compared with that of palmitate. Additionally, the increment in phosphorylated
 JNK by tunicamycin was lower and not significant compared with that of
 palmitate. These results suggest that ER stress played a minor role in
 palmitate-induced JNK activation and cellular insulin resistance in H4IIEC3
 hepatocytes.Palmitate Induces ROS Production—In addition to ER stress,
 increased cellular ROS levels are known to stimulate threonine phosphorylation
 of JNK (22). Indeed, ROS
 levels are increased in clinical conditions associated with insulin
 resistance, such as sepsis, burn injuries, obesity, and type 2 diabetes
 (23). Furthermore, FFAs have
 been reported to generate ROS in various cells, such as pancreatic islet cells
 (24), cardiac myocytes
 (25), and adipocytes
 (23).FIGURE 6.Effects of antioxidants on palmitate-induced alterations in
 insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of Akt in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes.
 A, H4IIEC3 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of
 palmitate (Pal) and antioxidants for 16 h prior to stimulation with
 insulin (1 ng/ml, 15 min). Total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE,
 transferred to a PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted with the indicated
 antibodies. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence. Representative blots
 are shown. B, the values from densitometry of four (NAC) or five
 (α-tocopherol) independent experiments were normalized to the level of
 total Akt protein and expressed as the mean -fold increase over control
 ± S.E. *, p < 0.05 versus palmitate treatment.
 NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; Toc,
 α-tocopherol.Thus, we hypothesized that palmitate increased intracellular ROS production
 and thereby activated JNK, leading to the impaired insulin signaling. To
 evaluate this, H4IIEC3 hepatocytes were incubated with H2DCFDA, a
 fluorescent probe, to visualize intracellular ROS, with or without palmitate.
 H2DCFDA-associated fluorescence was elevated by 58% after
 incubation with 0.25 mm palmitate for 8 h, and palmitate induced
 more ROS production than oleate (Fig.
 4). Consistent with this, the amount of protein carbonyls, a
 marker of oxidative stress, significantly increased in palmitate-treated
 hepatocytes (4.6 ± 0.5 nmol/mg protein), compared with control cells
 (3.1 ± 0.4 nmol/mg protein). These results suggest that FFAs,
 especially palmitate, can cause ROS production and oxidative stress in H4IIEC3
 hepatocytes.Antioxidants Prevent Palmitate-induced Insulin Resistance—We
 next sought to test whether palmitate-induced ROS overproduction had a causal
 role in insulin resistance by assessing whether two antioxidant reagents,
 N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and α-tocopherol, could
 also act as insulin sensitizers. NAC and α-tocopherol dose-dependently
 suppressed palmitate-induced intracellular ROS production; NAC at 10
 mm and α-tocopherol at 0.4 mm suppressed ROS
 production by 50 and 60%, respectively
 (Fig. 5). In parallel with
 decreased ROS levels, the antioxidants recovered the insulin-stimulated Akt
 phosphorylation impaired by palmitate; NAC at 10 mm and
 α-tocopherol at 0.4 mm recovered the phosphorylation by 40
 and 35%, respectively (Fig. 6).
 Furthermore, these antioxidants suppressed palmitate-induced JNK
 phosphorylation; NAC at 10 mm and α-tocopherol at 0.4
 mm suppressed it by 80 and 55%, respectively
 (Fig. 7). These results suggest
 that palmitate increased ROS levels in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes and thereby
 activated JNK, resulting in insulin resistance.Palmitate Induces ROS Overproduction in Mitochondria—To
 define the source of ROS induced by palmitate in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes, we
 examined the cellular pathway involved in ROS production, including NADPH
 oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and mitochondria-mediated pathways.
 Palmitate-induced ROS production was markedly suppressed by rotenone, an
 inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I;
 thenoyltrifluoroacetone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory chain
 complex II; and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, an
 uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation
 (Fig. 8). In contrast, ROS
 production in palmitate-treated H4IIEC3 cells was not suppressed by apocynin,
 an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, or oxypurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine
 oxidase. These results suggest that the mitochondrial respiratory chain is
 involved in palmitate-induced ROS overproduction in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes.Palmitate Increases ROS through the Mitochondrial Fatty Acid
 β-Oxidation Respiratory Chain—FFAs are metabolized in the
 mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, which supplies the
 mitochondrial respiratory chain with electrons. Large amounts of electrons
 entering the respiratory chain may cause abnormal reduction of oxygen, leading
 to ROS production. Thus, we next examined whether palmitate-induced ROS
 production was dependent on mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. CPT-1a
 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a) is the rate-limiting enzyme in
 mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. As expected, etomoxir, a CPT-1
 inhibitor, decreased palmitate-induced ROS production, by 80%
 (Fig. 9A).
 Furthermore, palmitate, but not oleate, significantly increased expression of
 the CPT-1a gene (Fig.
 9B). This up-regulation may contribute to
 palmitate-induced ROS overproduction, because the accelerated β-oxidation
 should cause excessive electron flux in the respiratory chain.FIGURE 7.Effects of antioxidants on palmitate-induced JNK activation in H4IIEC3
 hepatocytes. A, H4IIEC3 cells were incubated in the presence or
 absence of palmitate (Pal) and antioxidants for 16 h. Total cell
 lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and
 immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Detection was by enhanced
 chemiluminescence. Representative blots are shown. B, the values from
 densitometry of four (NAC orα-tocopherol) independent experiments were
 normalized to the level of total JNK protein and expressed as the mean -fold
 increase over control ± S.E. **, p < 0.01 versus
 palmitate treatment alone. Toc, α-tocopherol.

Palmitate Inhibited Insulin Receptor-mediated Signaling—Two
 long chain fatty acids were chosen for the study: palmitate, a C16:0 saturated
 fatty acid, and oleate, a C18:1 monounsaturated fatty acid. To examine whether
 FFAs impaired insulin signal transduction in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes, we assessed
 the effect of FFAs on insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 and
 serine phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3α
 (Fig. 1). Incubation with 0.25
 mm palmitate inhibited insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation
 of IRS-2 by 40% in H4IIEC3 cells. Downstream of IRS-2, insulin-stimulated
 serine phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3α were also inhibited by 0.25
 mm palmitate treatment, by 80 and 70%, respectively, indicating an
 insulin-resistant state. However, the protein levels of total IRS-2, Akt, and
 GSK-3 were unaffected by palmitate. Furthermore, we confirmed that palmitate,
 but not oleate, impaired insulin-stimulated Akt serine phosphorylation in the
 human hepatoma cell line HepG2 (supplemental Fig. 1).

JNK Activation by Palmitate Contributes to Palmitate-induced Insulin
 Resistance—JNK, a stress-activated protein kinase, has been
 reported to phosphorylate IRS-1 and -2 at serine residues
 (15,
 16). Serine phosphorylation of
 IRSs impairs IRS tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to a reduction in insulin
 receptor-mediated signaling. Many studies have verified the role of JNK in
 fat-induced insulin resistance in several experimental systems
 (7,
 17,
 18). Thus, we next examined
 the effect of FFAs on JNK activation and its involvement in insulin signaling.
 Palmitate, but not oleate, dramatically increased phosphorylated JNK and c-Jun
 (Fig. 2). A potent and
 selective inhibitor of JNK, SP600125
 (19), reversed the
 palmitate-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun
 (Fig. 2), suggesting that
 palmitate activated JNK. To test whether palmitate-induced JNK activation
 mediated cellular insulin resistance, we inhibited the JNK pathway with
 SP600125. SP600125 dose-dependently improved insulin-stimulated serine
 phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes exposed to palmitate
 (Fig. 3). These results suggest
 that JNK activation by palmitate contributed to palmitate-induced insulin
 resistance.

Pathways for SREBP-1c and ER Stress Are Not Involved in
 Palmitate-induced JNK Activation and Insulin Resistance in H4IIEC3
 Hepatocytes—The SREBP-1c pathway has been reported to play a role
 in diet-induced insulin resistance in vivo. Ide et al.
 (6) found that high sucrose
 diet-induced hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia up-regulated hepatic
 expression of SREBP-1c, leading to down-regulation of IRS-2 at the
 transcriptional level. However, in the present study, palmitate dramatically
 down-regulated the expression of SREBP-1c in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes (supplemental
 Fig. 2). Consistent with this, the mRNA (supplemental Fig. 2) and protein
 (Fig. 1) levels of IRS-2 were
 unaffected by palmitate. Thus, palmitate itself did not appear to cause
 insulin resistance in hepatocytes via the SREBP-1c pathway.

ER stress is induced in insulin-resistant states, such as obesity and type
 2 diabetes, and in turn, this stress has been shown to lead to the inhibition
 of insulin signaling, through overactivation of JNK
 (9). Since excessive FFAs have
 been shown to trigger ER stress in pancreatic β-cells
 (20), we examined whether
 palmitate caused ER stress in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes. ER stress induces the
 spliced form of XBP-1 (XBP-1s), which up-regulates the transcription of
 molecular chaperones, including GRP78 (78-kDa glucose-regulated/binding
 immunoglobulin protein) (21).
 Palmitate at 0.25 mm did not alter the expression level of GRP78
 mRNA or the splicing pattern of XBP-1, unlike tunicamycin, an agent commonly
 used to induce ER stress (supplemental Fig. 3). Next, we compared the impact
 of palmitate and tunicamycin on insulin-stimulated signal transduction and JNK
 activation (supplemental Fig. 4). The inhibitory effect of tunicamycin on
 insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of Akt was mild and not significant
 compared with that of palmitate. Additionally, the increment in phosphorylated
 JNK by tunicamycin was lower and not significant compared with that of
 palmitate. These results suggest that ER stress played a minor role in
 palmitate-induced JNK activation and cellular insulin resistance in H4IIEC3
 hepatocytes.

Palmitate Induces ROS Production—In addition to ER stress,
 increased cellular ROS levels are known to stimulate threonine phosphorylation
 of JNK (22). Indeed, ROS
 levels are increased in clinical conditions associated with insulin
 resistance, such as sepsis, burn injuries, obesity, and type 2 diabetes
 (23). Furthermore, FFAs have
 been reported to generate ROS in various cells, such as pancreatic islet cells
 (24), cardiac myocytes
 (25), and adipocytes
 (23).

 more ROS production than oleate (Fig.

 marker of oxidative stress, significantly increased in palmitate-treated

 (3.1 ± 0.4 nmol/mg protein). These results suggest that FFAs,
 especially palmitate, can cause ROS production and oxidative stress in H4IIEC3
 hepatocytes.

Antioxidants Prevent Palmitate-induced Insulin Resistance—We
 next sought to test whether palmitate-induced ROS overproduction had a causal
 role in insulin resistance by assessing whether two antioxidant reagents,
 N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and α-tocopherol, could
 also act as insulin sensitizers. NAC and α-tocopherol dose-dependently
 suppressed palmitate-induced intracellular ROS production; NAC at 10
 mm and α-tocopherol at 0.4 mm suppressed ROS
 production by 50 and 60%, respectively
 (Fig. 5). In parallel with
 decreased ROS levels, the antioxidants recovered the insulin-stimulated Akt
 phosphorylation impaired by palmitate; NAC at 10 mm and
 α-tocopherol at 0.4 mm recovered the phosphorylation by 40
 and 35%, respectively (Fig. 6).
 Furthermore, these antioxidants suppressed palmitate-induced JNK
 phosphorylation; NAC at 10 mm and α-tocopherol at 0.4
 mm suppressed it by 80 and 55%, respectively
 (Fig. 7). These results suggest
 that palmitate increased ROS levels in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes and thereby
 activated JNK, resulting in insulin resistance.

Palmitate Induces ROS Overproduction in Mitochondria—To
 define the source of ROS induced by palmitate in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes, we
 examined the cellular pathway involved in ROS production, including NADPH
 oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and mitochondria-mediated pathways.
 Palmitate-induced ROS production was markedly suppressed by rotenone, an
 inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I;
 thenoyltrifluoroacetone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory chain
 complex II; and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, an
 uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation
 (Fig. 8). In contrast, ROS
 production in palmitate-treated H4IIEC3 cells was not suppressed by apocynin,
 an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, or oxypurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine
 oxidase. These results suggest that the mitochondrial respiratory chain is
 involved in palmitate-induced ROS overproduction in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes.

Palmitate Increases ROS through the Mitochondrial Fatty Acid
 β-Oxidation Respiratory Chain—FFAs are metabolized in the
 mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, which supplies the
 mitochondrial respiratory chain with electrons. Large amounts of electrons
 entering the respiratory chain may cause abnormal reduction of oxygen, leading
 to ROS production. Thus, we next examined whether palmitate-induced ROS
 production was dependent on mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. CPT-1a
 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a) is the rate-limiting enzyme in
 mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. As expected, etomoxir, a CPT-1
 inhibitor, decreased palmitate-induced ROS production, by 80%
 (Fig. 9A).
 Furthermore, palmitate, but not oleate, significantly increased expression of
 the CPT-1a gene (Fig.
 9B). This up-regulation may contribute to
 palmitate-induced ROS overproduction, because the accelerated β-oxidation
 should cause excessive electron flux in the respiratory chain.

DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we investigated the direct action of fatty acids on
 insulin signaling in hepatocytes. The saturated fatty acid palmitate, but not
 the unsaturated fatty acid oleate, impaired insulin-induced tyrosine
 phosphorylation of IRS-2, serine phosphorylation of Akt, and serine
 phosphorylation of GSK-3α, all of which are indicative of insulin
 resistance in cultured H4IIEC3 hepatocytes
 (Fig. 10). Unlike in
 vivo findings (6), the
 expression of the SREBP-1c gene was down-regulated by adding
 palmitate to cultured H4IIEC3 hepatocytes, which is likely a result of a
 negative feedback loop for fatty acid synthesis, and IRS-2 protein levels were
 unaffected. FFA-induced insulin resistance has been reported in other
 insulin-sensitive cells, such as adipocytes
 (18) and skeletal muscle cells
 (26). These studies, together
 with the present results, suggest that FFA inhibits insulin signaling at the
 level of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRSs, regardless of cell type. Similar to
 the findings in 3T3-L1 adipocytes
 (18) and primary mouse
 hepatocytes and pancreatic β-cells
 (16), the activation of JNK, a
 known suppressor of the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRSs, was involved in
 FFA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 in cultured H4IIEC3 hepatocytes.
 Because a JNK inhibitor, SP600125, largely restored palmitate-induced
 impairment of the insulin signaling pathway, JNK activation seems to play a
 major role in the development of palmitate-induced insulin resistance in
 H4IIEC3 hepatocytes. Our results support in vivo findings that JNK is
 activated in the liver of an animal model of obesity and diabetes in which FFA
 influx into the liver is elevated
 (9,
 27). The overexpression of JNK
 in mouse liver resulted in hepatic insulin resistance at the level of IRS
 tyrosine phosphorylation, and the overexpression of a dominant negative mutant
 of JNK in the liver accelerated hepatic insulin signaling
 (17).Given that JNK is activated by many types of cellular stresses
 (28), we next searched for a
 link between palmitate treatment and JNK activation in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes. ER
 stress was unlikely to mediate palmitate-induced insulin resistance in H4IIEC3
 hepatocytes, because palmitate caused insulin resistance independent of ER
 stress, whereas tunicamycin caused ER stress without affecting insulin action.
 Instead, we found that palmitate-induced ROS generation mediated insulin
 resistance. ROS are one of many factors suggested to have a possible role in
 insulin resistance (29,
 30). ROS include reactive
 products, such as superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical,
 which are formed as by-products of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
 (OXPHOS). Thus, as a rule, increased mitochondrial OXPHOS flux leads to
 increased formation of ROS
 (31,
 32). ROS can also be produced
 during β-oxidation of fatty acids, especially as a by-product of
 peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase activity
 (32). Additionally, ROS can be
 produced by dedicated enzymes, such as NADPH oxidase
 (33), present in phagocytic
 cells, where ROS are an important part of cellular defense mechanisms. Using
 specific inhibitors of subcellular ROS, we identified mitochondrial OXPHOS as
 an important source of palmitate-induced ROS generation in H4IIEC3
 hepatocytes. FFAs supply mitochondrial OXPHOS with electrons through
 mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. A final metabolite of fatty acids,
 acetyl-CoA, is metabolized in the trichloroacetic acid cycle. In the processes
 of fatty acid β-oxidation and the trichloroacetic acid cycle, NADH and
 FADH2 are generated and could supply excessive electrons for
 OXPHOS.FIGURE 8.Effects of ROS-producing pathway inhibitors on palmitate-induced ROS

 were detected by real time PCR. The values were normalized to the level of 18
 S ribosomal RNA and expressed as mean -fold increase over control ±
 S.E. (n = 3). *, p < 0.05 versus control. **,
 p < 0.01 versus palmitate treatment alone.NAC, a scavenger of ROS, dose-dependently restored glutathione in
 palmitate-treated cells (supplemental Fig. 5). However, glutathione
 restoration by NAC was unable to completely rescue palmitate-induced insulin
 resistance. Furthermore, the combination of NAC and α-tocopherol did not
 completely reverse JNK activation (supplemental Fig. 6, A and
 B) and only partly rescued palmitate-induced insulin resistance
 (supplemental Fig. 7, A and B). Therefore, other mechanisms
 may also be involved in insulin resistance caused by palmitate.De novo ceramide synthesis is a potential pathway contributing to
 palmitate-induced JNK activation. Ceramide derived from saturated fatty acids
 has been reported to activate JNK and inhibit insulin-induced Akt
 phosphorylation in myocytes
 (34–36).
 In our investigation, palmitate increased the intracellular content of
 ceramide in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes (supplemental Fig. 8). Unfortunately, even at
 the maximum myriosin concentration, the intracellular accumulation of ceramide
 was not blocked by myriosin, a potent inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase
 at the first step in ceramide biosynthesis (supplemental Fig. 8). Furthermore,
 ceramide accumulation was not blocked when myriosin was used in combination
 with fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase (data not shown).
 Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that intracellular ceramide
 contributes to palmitate-induced insulin resistance in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes.
 Further studies are required to assess the role of the ceramide pathway in
 palmitate-induced insulin resistance in hepatocytes.FIGURE 10.Proposed model for palmitate-induced hepatic insulin resistance.In the present study, etomoxir, an inhibitor of CPT-1, decreased
 palmitate-induced intracellular ROS production. Additionally, palmitate, but
 not oleate, significantly increased the expression of the CPT-1a
 gene, which may account for the observed differences in insulin action between
 palmitate and oleate.Recently, it was reported that fatty acid composition may be a determinant
 in insulin sensitivity (37,
 38). In this regard, we
 investigated the effect of oleate on insulin signaling in palmitate-treated
 hepatocytes. Surprisingly, oleate dose-dependently reversed palmitate-induced
 ROS generation and JNK phosphorylation and rescued palmitate-induced
 phosphorylation of
 Akt.3 Further
 investigations aimed at elucidating the molecular basis underlying the
 differential roles and interactions of FFAs are required.In conclusion, this study identified mitochondrial ROS generation as a
 critical factor in palmitate-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Palmitate may
 induce CPT-1 expression, accelerate metabolism, supply excess electrons for
 mitochondrial OXPHOS, and generate ROS. ROS then desensitize the insulin
 signaling pathway by activating JNK, impairing tyrosine phosphorylation of
 IRS-2, and causing hepatic insulin resistance
 (Fig. 10). The results suggest
 that an initial event in high fat/sucrose diet-induced or obesity-induced
 insulin resistance in the liver is mitochondrial ROS generation, which could
 potentially be a therapeutic target. In addition to previously suggested JNK
 inhibitors or antioxidants, mitochondrial uncouplers, such as cyanide
 m-chlorophenylhydrazone, may provide a candidate therapeutic strategy
 for this pathway by preventing ROS generation.

In the present study, we investigated the direct action of fatty acids on
 insulin signaling in hepatocytes. The saturated fatty acid palmitate, but not
 the unsaturated fatty acid oleate, impaired insulin-induced tyrosine
 phosphorylation of IRS-2, serine phosphorylation of Akt, and serine
 phosphorylation of GSK-3α, all of which are indicative of insulin
 resistance in cultured H4IIEC3 hepatocytes
 (Fig. 10). Unlike in
 vivo findings (6), the
 expression of the SREBP-1c gene was down-regulated by adding
 palmitate to cultured H4IIEC3 hepatocytes, which is likely a result of a
 negative feedback loop for fatty acid synthesis, and IRS-2 protein levels were
 unaffected. FFA-induced insulin resistance has been reported in other
 insulin-sensitive cells, such as adipocytes
 (18) and skeletal muscle cells
 (26). These studies, together
 with the present results, suggest that FFA inhibits insulin signaling at the
 level of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRSs, regardless of cell type. Similar to
 the findings in 3T3-L1 adipocytes
 (18) and primary mouse
 hepatocytes and pancreatic β-cells
 (16), the activation of JNK, a
 known suppressor of the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRSs, was involved in
 FFA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 in cultured H4IIEC3 hepatocytes.
 Because a JNK inhibitor, SP600125, largely restored palmitate-induced
 impairment of the insulin signaling pathway, JNK activation seems to play a
 major role in the development of palmitate-induced insulin resistance in
 H4IIEC3 hepatocytes. Our results support in vivo findings that JNK is
 activated in the liver of an animal model of obesity and diabetes in which FFA
 influx into the liver is elevated
 (9,
 27). The overexpression of JNK
 in mouse liver resulted in hepatic insulin resistance at the level of IRS
 tyrosine phosphorylation, and the overexpression of a dominant negative mutant
 of JNK in the liver accelerated hepatic insulin signaling
 (17).

Given that JNK is activated by many types of cellular stresses
 (28), we next searched for a
 link between palmitate treatment and JNK activation in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes. ER
 stress was unlikely to mediate palmitate-induced insulin resistance in H4IIEC3
 hepatocytes, because palmitate caused insulin resistance independent of ER
 stress, whereas tunicamycin caused ER stress without affecting insulin action.
 Instead, we found that palmitate-induced ROS generation mediated insulin
 resistance. ROS are one of many factors suggested to have a possible role in
 insulin resistance (29,
 30). ROS include reactive
 products, such as superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical,
 which are formed as by-products of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
 (OXPHOS). Thus, as a rule, increased mitochondrial OXPHOS flux leads to
 increased formation of ROS
 (31,
 32). ROS can also be produced
 during β-oxidation of fatty acids, especially as a by-product of
 peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase activity
 (32). Additionally, ROS can be
 produced by dedicated enzymes, such as NADPH oxidase
 (33), present in phagocytic
 cells, where ROS are an important part of cellular defense mechanisms. Using
 specific inhibitors of subcellular ROS, we identified mitochondrial OXPHOS as
 an important source of palmitate-induced ROS generation in H4IIEC3
 hepatocytes. FFAs supply mitochondrial OXPHOS with electrons through
 mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. A final metabolite of fatty acids,
 acetyl-CoA, is metabolized in the trichloroacetic acid cycle. In the processes
 of fatty acid β-oxidation and the trichloroacetic acid cycle, NADH and
 FADH2 are generated and could supply excessive electrons for
 OXPHOS.

NAC, a scavenger of ROS, dose-dependently restored glutathione in
 palmitate-treated cells (supplemental Fig. 5). However, glutathione
 restoration by NAC was unable to completely rescue palmitate-induced insulin
 resistance. Furthermore, the combination of NAC and α-tocopherol did not
 completely reverse JNK activation (supplemental Fig. 6, A and
 B) and only partly rescued palmitate-induced insulin resistance
 (supplemental Fig. 7, A and B). Therefore, other mechanisms
 may also be involved in insulin resistance caused by palmitate.

De novo ceramide synthesis is a potential pathway contributing to
 palmitate-induced JNK activation. Ceramide derived from saturated fatty acids
 has been reported to activate JNK and inhibit insulin-induced Akt
 phosphorylation in myocytes
 (34–36).
 In our investigation, palmitate increased the intracellular content of
 ceramide in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes (supplemental Fig. 8). Unfortunately, even at
 the maximum myriosin concentration, the intracellular accumulation of ceramide
 was not blocked by myriosin, a potent inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase
 at the first step in ceramide biosynthesis (supplemental Fig. 8). Furthermore,
 ceramide accumulation was not blocked when myriosin was used in combination
 with fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase (data not shown).
 Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that intracellular ceramide
 contributes to palmitate-induced insulin resistance in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes.
 Further studies are required to assess the role of the ceramide pathway in
 palmitate-induced insulin resistance in hepatocytes.

FIGURE 10.Proposed model for palmitate-induced hepatic insulin resistance.

Proposed model for palmitate-induced hepatic insulin resistance.

In the present study, etomoxir, an inhibitor of CPT-1, decreased
 palmitate-induced intracellular ROS production. Additionally, palmitate, but
 not oleate, significantly increased the expression of the CPT-1a
 gene, which may account for the observed differences in insulin action between
 palmitate and oleate.

Recently, it was reported that fatty acid composition may be a determinant
 in insulin sensitivity (37,
 38). In this regard, we
 investigated the effect of oleate on insulin signaling in palmitate-treated
 hepatocytes. Surprisingly, oleate dose-dependently reversed palmitate-induced
 ROS generation and JNK phosphorylation and rescued palmitate-induced
 phosphorylation of
 Akt.3 Further
 investigations aimed at elucidating the molecular basis underlying the
 differential roles and interactions of FFAs are required.

In conclusion, this study identified mitochondrial ROS generation as a
 critical factor in palmitate-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Palmitate may
 induce CPT-1 expression, accelerate metabolism, supply excess electrons for
 mitochondrial OXPHOS, and generate ROS. ROS then desensitize the insulin
 signaling pathway by activating JNK, impairing tyrosine phosphorylation of
 IRS-2, and causing hepatic insulin resistance
 (Fig. 10). The results suggest
 that an initial event in high fat/sucrose diet-induced or obesity-induced
 insulin resistance in the liver is mitochondrial ROS generation, which could
 potentially be a therapeutic target. In addition to previously suggested JNK
 inhibitors or antioxidants, mitochondrial uncouplers, such as cyanide
 m-chlorophenylhydrazone, may provide a candidate therapeutic strategy
 for this pathway by preventing ROS generation.
