The RNA degradosome is a bacterial protein machine devoted to RNA degradation 
and processing. In Escherichia coli it is typically composed of the 
endoribonuclease RNase E, which also serves as a scaffold for the other 
components, the exoribonuclease PNPase, the RNA helicase RhlB, and enolase. 
Several other proteins have been found associated to the core complex. However, 
it remains unclear in most cases whether such proteins are occasional 
contaminants or specific components, and which is their function. To facilitate 
the analysis of the RNA degradosome composition under different physiological 
and genetic conditions we set up a simplified preparation procedure based on the 
affinity purification of FLAG epitope-tagged RNase E coupled to Multidimensional 
Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) for the rapid and quantitative 
identification of the different components. By this proteomic approach, we show 
that the chaperone protein DnaK, previously identified as a "minor component" of 
the degradosome, associates with abnormal complexes under stressful conditions 
such as overexpression of RNase E, low temperature, and in the absence of 
PNPase; however, DnaK does not seem to be essential for RNA degradosome 
structure nor for its assembly. In addition, we show that normalized score 
values obtain by MudPIT analysis may be taken as quantitative estimates of the 
relative protein abundance in different degradosome preparations.
