Several neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the accumulation of 
proteinaceous inclusions in the central nervous system. These inclusions are 
frequently composed of a mixture of aggregation-prone proteins. Here, we used a 
bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay to study the initial steps of the 
co-aggregation of huntingtin (Htt) and α-synuclein (α-syn), two 
aggregation-prone proteins involved in Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD), respectively. We found that Htt (exon 1) oligomerized with α-syn 
and sequestered it in the cytosol. In turn, α-syn increased the number of cells 
displaying aggregates, decreased the number of aggregates per cell and increased 
the average size of the aggregates. Our results support the idea that 
co-aggregation of aggregation-prone proteins can contribute to the 
histopathology of neurodegenerative disorders.
