Amyloid β (Aβ) plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and binds to the 
nicotinic α(7) receptor (α(7) nAChR). Little is known about the degree to which 
the binding of Aβ to the α(7) nAChR influences the role of this receptor in 
long-term potentiation (LTP), however. We have studied the effect of the partial 
α(7) nAChR agonist SSR180711 on hippocampal slice preparations from normal wild 
type (Wt) and APP(swe)/PS1ΔE9 transgenic (Tg) mice. In the hippocampal slices 
from the 6 months old Wt mice, the application of both nicotine (5μM) and 
SSR180711 (300nM) resulted in a significant enhancement of LTP expressed in area 
CA1. However, in the Tg mice the application of SSR180711 did not result in an 
increase in LTP beyond control levels. The amount of binding of the α(7) nAChR 
ligand 125-I-α-bungarotoxin was not different between in Tg and Wt mice. These 
findings indicate that the α(7) nAChR is functionally blocked in the hippocampal 
neurons, downstream of the α(7) nAChR, and that this is likely due to an 
interaction between the receptor and Aβ, which leads to changes in LTP.
