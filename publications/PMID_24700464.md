Profilin-1 (Pfn-1) is an actin-regulatory protein that has a role in modulating 
smooth muscle contraction. However, the mechanisms that regulate Pfn-1 in smooth 
muscle are not fully understood. Here, stimulation with acetylcholine induced an 
increase in the association of the adapter protein cortactin with Pfn-1 in 
smooth muscle cells/tissues. Furthermore, disruption of the protein/protein 
interaction by a cell-permeable peptide (CTTN-I peptide) attenuated actin 
polymerization and smooth muscle contraction without affecting myosin light 
chain phosphorylation at Ser-19. Knockdown of cortactin by lentivirus-mediated 
RNAi also diminished actin polymerization and smooth muscle force development. 
However, cortactin knockdown did not affect myosin activation. In addition, 
cortactin phosphorylation has been implicated in nonmuscle cell migration. In 
this study, acetylcholine stimulation induced cortactin phosphorylation at 
Tyr-421 in smooth muscle cells. Phenylalanine substitution at this position 
impaired cortactin/Pfn-1 interaction in response to contractile activation. 
c-Abl is a tyrosine kinase that is necessary for actin dynamics and contraction 
in smooth muscle. Here, c-Abl silencing inhibited the agonist-induced cortactin 
phosphorylation and the association of cortactin with Pfn-1. Finally, treatment 
with CTTN-I peptide reduced airway resistance and smooth muscle hyperreactivity 
in a murine model of asthma. These results suggest that the interaction of 
cortactin with Pfn-1 plays a pivotal role in regulating actin dynamics, smooth 
muscle contraction, and airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma. The association of 
cortactin with Pfn-1 is regulated by c-Abl-mediated cortactin phosphorylation.
