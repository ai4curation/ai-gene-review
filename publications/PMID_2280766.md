The effect of regucalcin, a calcium-binding protein isolated from rat liver 
cytosol, on in vitro protein synthesis in the 5500 g supernatant fraction of rat 
liver homogenate was investigated. Addition of Ca2+ up to 5.0 microM in the 
reaction mixture caused a significant decrease in protein synthesis. This 
decrease was saturated at 10 microM Ca2+. The Ca2+ effect was not reversed by 
the presence of regucalcin (2.0 microM); the protein caused a remarkable 
decrease in hepatic protein synthesis, and it enhanced significantly the Ca2+ 
effect. Meanwhile, calmodulin (2.5-20 micrograms/ml), a calcium-binding protein, 
did not have an appreciable effect on the Ca2+ (10 microM)-induced decrease in 
hepatic protein synthesis. [3H]Leucyl-tRNA synthetase activity in the 105000 g 
supernatant fraction (cytosol) of liver homogenate was markedly decreased by 
addition of Ca2+ (1.0-50 microM). This decrease was not reversed by the presence 
of regucalcin (2.0 microM); the protein (1.0-2.0 microM) caused a remarkable 
decrease in the enzyme activity. The present results suggest that regucalcin can 
regulate protein synthesis in liver cells.
