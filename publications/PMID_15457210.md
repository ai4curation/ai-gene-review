Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE), a multiligand receptor in 
the immunoglobulin superfamily, functions as a signal-transducing cell surface 
acceptor for amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). In view of increased neuronal 
expression of RAGE in Alzheimer's disease, a murine model was developed to 
assess the impact of RAGE in an Abeta-rich environment, employing transgenics 
(Tgs) with targeted neuronal overexpression of RAGE and mutant amyloid precursor 
protein (APP). Double Tgs (mutant APP (mAPP)/RAGE) displayed early abnormalities 
in spatial learning/memory, accompanied by altered activation of markers of 
synaptic plasticity and exaggerated neuropathologic findings, before such 
changes were found in mAPP mice. In contrast, Tg mice bearing a 
dominant-negative RAGE construct targeted to neurons crossed with mAPP animals 
displayed preservation of spatial learning/memory and diminished neuropathologic 
changes. These data indicate that RAGE is a cofactor for Abeta-induced neuronal 
perturbation in a model of Alzheimer's-type pathology, and suggest its potential 
as a therapeutic target to ameliorate cellular dysfunction.
