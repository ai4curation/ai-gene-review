Ubiquitination regulates the stability and/or activity of numerous cellular 
proteins. The corollary is that de-ubiquitinating enzymes, which 'trim' 
polyubiquitin chains from specific substrate proteins, play key roles in 
controlling fundamental cellular activities. Ubiquitin is essential at several 
stages during the activation of NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB), a central 
co-ordinator of inflammation and other immune processes. Ubiquitination is known 
to cause degradation of the inhibitory molecule IkappaBalpha (inhibitor of 
kappaB). In addition, activation of TRAF 
(tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor) and IKKgamma (IkappaB kinase 
gamma)/NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modifier) signal adaptors relies on their 
modification with 'nonclassical' forms of polyubiquitin chains. Ubiquitin also 
plays a key role in determining cell fate by modulating the stability of 
numerous pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic proteins. The zinc-finger protein A20 
has dual functions in inhibiting NF-kappaB activation and suppressing apoptosis. 
The molecular mechanisms of these anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects 
are unknown. Here we demonstrate that A20 is a de-ubiquitinating enzyme. It 
contains an N-terminal catalytic domain that belongs to the ovarian-tumour 
superfamily of cysteine proteases. A20 cleaved ubiquitin monomers from branched 
polyubiquitin chains linked through Lys48 or Lys63 and bound covalently to a 
thiol-group-reactive, ubiquitin-derived probe. Mutation of a conserved cysteine 
residue in the catalytic site (Cys103) abolished these activities. A20 did not 
have a global effect on ubiquitinated cellular proteins, which indicates that 
its activity is target-specific. The biological significance of the catalytic 
domain is unknown.
