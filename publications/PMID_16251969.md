The 26S proteasome is a multisubunit protease responsible for regulated 
proteolysis in eukaryotic cells. It comprises one catalytic 20S proteasome and 
two axially positioned 19S regulatory complexes. The 20S proteasome is composed 
of 28 subunits arranged in a cylindrical particle as four heteroheptameric 
rings, alpha1-7beta1-7beta1-7alpha1-7 (refs 4, 5), but the mechanism responsible 
for the assembly of such a complex structure remains elusive. Here we report two 
chaperones, designated proteasome assembling chaperone-1 (PAC1) and PAC2, that 
are involved in the maturation of mammalian 20S proteasomes. PAC1 and PAC2 
associate as heterodimers with proteasome precursors and are degraded after 
formation of the 20S proteasome is completed. Overexpression of PAC1 or PAC2 
accelerates the formation of precursor proteasomes, whereas knockdown by short 
interfering RNA impairs it, resulting in poor maturation of 20S proteasomes. 
Furthermore, the PAC complex provides a scaffold for alpha-ring formation and 
keeps the alpha-rings competent for the subsequent formation of 
half-proteasomes. Thus, our results identify a mechanism for the correct 
assembly of 20S proteasomes.
