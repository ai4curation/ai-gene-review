Hsp104 is a stress tolerance factor that promotes the reactivation of 
heat-damaged proteins in yeast by an unknown mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate 
that Hsp104 functions in this process directly. Unlike other chaperones, Hsp104 
does not prevent the aggregation of denatured proteins. However, in concert with 
Hsp40 and Hsp70, Hsp104 can reactivate proteins that have been denatured and 
allowed to aggregate, substrates refractory to the action of other chaperones. 
Hsp104 cooperates with the chaperones present in reticulocyte lysates but not 
with DnaK of E. coli. We conclude that Hsp104 has a protein remodeling activity 
that acts on trapped, aggregated proteins and requires specific interactions 
with conventional chaperones to promote refolding of the intermediates it 
produces.
