The bacterium Bacillus subtilis undergoes endospore formation in response to 
starvation. sigma factors play a key role in spatiotemporal regulation of gene 
expression during development. Activation of sigma factors is coordinated by 
signal transduction between the forespore and the mother cell. sigma(E) is 
produced as pro-sigma(E), which is activated in the mother cell by cleavage in 
response to a signal from the forespore. We report that expression of SpoIIR, a 
putative signaling protein normally made in the forespore, and SpoIIGA, a 
putative protease, is necessary and sufficient for accurate, rapid, and abundant 
processing of pro-sigma(E) to sigma(E) in Escherichia coli. Modeling and 
mutational analyses provide evidence that SpoIIGA is a novel type of aspartic 
protease whose C-terminal half forms a dimer similar to the human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease. Previous studies suggest that the 
N-terminal half of SpoIIGA is membrane-embedded. We found that SpoIIGA expressed 
in E. coli is membrane-associated and that after detergent treatment SpoIIGA was 
self-associated. Also, SpoIIGA interacts with SpoIIR. The results support a 
model in which SpoIIGA forms inactive dimers or oligomers, and interaction of 
SpoIIR with the N-terminal domain of SpoIIGA on one side of a membrane causes a 
conformational change that allows formation of active aspartic protease dimer in 
the C-terminal domain on the other side of the membrane, where it cleaves 
pro-sigma(E).
