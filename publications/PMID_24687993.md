Previously, we identified family with sequence similarity 65, member B (Fam65b), 
as a protein transiently up-regulated during differentiation and fusion of human 
myogenic cells. Silencing of Fam65b expression results in severe reduction of 
myogenin expression and consequent lack of myoblast fusion. The molecular 
function of Fam65b and whether misregulation of its expression could be 
causative of muscle diseases are unknown. Protein pulldowns were used to 
identify Fam65b-interacting proteins in differentiating human muscle cells and 
regenerating muscle tissue. In vitro, human muscle cells were treated with 
histone-deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and expression of Fam65b and interacting 
proteins was studied. Nontreated cells were used as controls. In vivo, 
expression of Fam65b was down-regulated in developing zebrafish to determine the 
effects on muscle development. Fam65b binds to HDAC6 and dysferlin, the protein 
mutated in limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B. The tricomplex 
Fam65b-HDAC6-dysferlin is transient, and Fam65b expression is necessary for the 
complex to form. Treatment of myogenic cells with pan-HDAC or HDAC6-specific 
inhibitors alters Fam65b expression, while dysferlin expression does not change. 
Inhibition of Fam65b expression in developing zebrafish results in abnormal 
muscle, with low birefringence, tears at the myosepta, and increased embryo 
lethality. Fam65b is an essential component of the HDAC6-dysferlin complex. 
Down-regulation of Fam65b in developing muscle causes changes consistent with 
muscle disease.-Balasubramanian, A., Kawahara, G., Gupta, V. A., Rozkalne, A., 
Beauvais, A., Kunkel, L. M., Gussoni, E. Fam65b is important for formation of 
the HDAC6-dysferlin protein complex during myogenic cell differentiation.
