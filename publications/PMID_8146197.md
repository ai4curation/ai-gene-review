The T-cell antigen CD28 provides a costimulatory signal that is required for 
T-cell proliferation. T-cell receptor zeta/CD3 engagement without CD28 ligation 
leads to a state of nonresponsiveness/anergy, thereby implicating CD28 in the 
control of peripheral tolerance to foreign antigens or tumors. A key unresolved 
question has concerned the mechanism by which CD28 generates intracellular 
signals. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is a lipid kinase with 
Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain(s) that binds to the platelet-derived growth factor 
receptor (PDGF-R), an interaction that is essential for signaling by growth 
factor. In this study, we demonstrate that CD28 binds to PI 3-kinase by means of 
a Y(P)MXM motif within its cytoplasmic tail. CD28-associated PI 3-kinase was 
detected by lipid kinase and HPLC analysis as well as by reconstitution 
experiments with baculoviral-expressed p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. CD28 bound 
directly to the p85 subunit without the need for the associated p110 subunit. 
Site-directed mutagenesis and peptide competition analysis using 
Y(P)-MXM-containing peptides showed that PI 3-kinase bound to a Y(P)MXM motif 
within the CD28 cytoplasmic tail (residues 191-194). Mutation of the Y191 within 
the motif resulted in a complete loss of binding, while mutation of M194 caused 
partial loss of binding. Binding analysis showed that the CD28 Y(P)-MXM motif 
bound to the p85 C- and N-terminal SH2 domains with an affinity comparable to 
that observed for PDGF-R and insulin receptor substrate 1. In terms of 
signaling, CD28 ligation induced a dramatic increase in the recruitment and 
association of PI 3-kinase with the receptor. CD28 is likely to use PI 3-kinase 
as the second signal leading to T-cell proliferation, an event with implications 
for anergy and peripheral T-cell tolerance.
