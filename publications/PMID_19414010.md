JANEX-1/WHI-P131, a selective Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) inhibitor, has been shown to 
delay the onset of diabetes in the NOD mouse model. However, the molecular 
mechanism by which JANEX-1 protects pancreatic beta-cells is unknown. In the 
current study, we investigated the role of JANEX-1 on interleukin (IL)-1beta and 
interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced beta-cell damage using isolated islets. 
JANEX-1-pretreated islets showed resistance to cytokine toxicity, namely 
suppressed nitric oxide (NO) production, reduced inducible form of NO synthase 
(iNOS) expression, and decreased islet destruction. The molecular mechanism by 
which JANEX-1 inhibits iNOS expression was mediated through suppression of the 
nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and JAK/signal transducer and activator of 
transcription (STAT) pathways. Islets treated with the cytokines downregulated 
the protein levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and SOCS-3, but 
pretreatment with JANEX-1 attenuated these decreases. Additionally, islets from 
JAK3(-/-) mice were more resistant to cytokine toxicity than islets from control 
mice. These results demonstrate that JANEX-1 protects beta-cells from cytokine 
toxicity through suppression of the NF-kappaB and JAK/STAT pathways and 
upregulation of SOCS proteins, suggesting that JANEX-1 may be used to preserve 
functional beta-cell mass.
