PMA1 is an essential gene encoding the yeast plasma membrane [H(+)]ATPase. A 
pma1-D378N mutant has a dominant-negative effect on cell growth because both 
newly synthesized mutant and wild-type Pma1 molecules are retained and degraded 
in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Like other substrates for ER-associated 
degradation, Pma1-D378N is stabilized in mutants defective in components of the 
ubiquitination machinery. A genetic selection was performed for eps (ER-retained 
pma1 suppressing) mutants in which the growth defect caused by the D378N allele 
is suppressed. In an eps1 mutant, both mutant and wild-type Pma1 molecules are 
allowed to travel to the plasma membrane; however, normal retention of resident 
ER proteins Shr3 and Kar2 is not perturbed. Eps1 is a novel membrane protein 
belonging to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, and Eps1 co-localizes 
with Pma1-D378N in the ER. In the absence of Pma1-D378N, ER export of wild-type 
Pma1 is not affected by eps1 deletion, but export of the plasma membrane protein 
Gas1 is delayed. Because Eps1 is required for retention and degradation of 
Pma1-D378N, we propose a model in which Eps1 acts as a novel membrane-bound 
chaperone in ER quality control.
