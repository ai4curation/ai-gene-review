Syk and Zap-70 are related protein-tyrosine kinases implicated in antigen and Fc 
receptor signaling. While Zap-70 is restricted to T-cells and natural killer 
cells, Syk accumulates in B-cells, mast cells, platelets, and immature T-cells. 
In addition, we found that an isoform of Syk (SykB), which carries a 23-amino 
acid deletion in the "linker" region, is prominently expressed in bone marrow. 
To better understand the relative impact of Syk, SykB, and Zap-70 on signal 
transduction, we compared their intrinsic enzymatic properties in transiently 
transfected COS-1 cells and in hemopoietic cells. Using modified versions of 
these enzymes bearing a common Myc epitope at the amino terminus, we determined 
that the ability of Syk and SykB to undergo autophosphorylation and to 
phosphorylate erythrocyte band 3 in immune complex kinase reactions was at least 
100-fold greater than that of Zap-70. Similarly, Syk and SykB, but not Zap-70, 
caused prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of p120(c-)cbl in COS-1 cells. A 
similar pattern of activity was also noted for endogenous Syk and Zap-70 from 
hemopoietic cells. To understand the structural basis for these characteristics, 
we also created and analyzed a series of chimeras between Syk and Zap-70. These 
studies indicated that the catalytic domain of Syk and Zap-70, but not their SH2 
domains, linker region or carboxyl-terminal tail, was responsible for their 
respective activity. Taken together, these data demonstrated that the intrinsic 
enzymatic activity of Syk and SykB is superior to that of Zap-70 and that such a 
distinction relates to structural variations in the catalytic domain.
