Mice deficient in either platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B chain or PDGF 
receptor (PDGFR) beta lack mesangial cells. PDGF stimulates proliferation and 
migration of metanephric mesenchymal cells, from which mesangial cells are 
derived. Binding of PDGF to PDGFR-beta induces autophosphorylation at specific 
tyrosine residues and activates various effector proteins, including 
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-K). This study explored the role of PI 3-K 
and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PDGF-mediated signaling using cells 
established from wild-type and PDGFR-beta -/- metanephric blastemas at 11.5 days 
post-conception. PDGF-induced effects that were dependent on PI3-K activation 
were determined using PDGFR-beta -/- cells made to express "add-back" mutant 
PDGFR-beta capable of binding PI3-K. We found that PDGF is mitogenic for 
mesenchymal cells expressing PDGFR-beta, and PI3-K is an important regulator of 
PDGF-induced DNA synthesis. Activation of ERK1/2 is partially dependent on 
PI3-K, and both the PI3-K and MEK-ERK1/2 pathways contribute to PI3-K-dependent 
mitogenesis. In addition, PDGF-induced DNA synthesis in wild-type cells was 
found to be dependent on ROS that are generated downstream of PI3-K activation. 
Using antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA, we determined that 
the NAD(P)H oxidase Nox4 produces these ROS that activate Akt and the MEK-ERK1/2 
mitogenic cascade. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates Nox4 
involvement in PDGF-induced DNA synthesis in metanephric mesenchymal cells and 
provides the first evidence that PDGF-induced PI3-K activity enhances production 
of ROS by Nox4.
