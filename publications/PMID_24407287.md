The apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-activating 
recruitment domain (ASC) is an essential component of several inflammasomes, 
multiprotein complexes that regulate caspase-1 activation and inflammation. We 
report here an interaction between promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and ASC. 
We observed enhanced formation of ASC dimers in PML-deficient macrophages. These 
macrophages also display enhanced levels of ASC in the cytosol. Furthermore, 
IL-1β production was markedly enhanced in these macrophages in response to both 
NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome activation and following bone marrow-derived 
macrophage infection with herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and Salmonella 
typhimurium. Collectively, our data indicate that PML limits ASC function, 
retaining ASC in the nucleus.
