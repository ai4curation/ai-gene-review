Activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein has been demonstrated to block 
cell growth by inducing either a transient cell cycle arrest or programmed cell 
death (apoptosis). Although evidence exists linking p53's function as an 
activator of transcription to its ability to effect cell cycle arrest, the role 
of this activity in the induction of apoptosis remains unclear. To gain insight 
into the molecular mechanisms underlying p53-mediated antiproliferative 
pathways, a study was initiated to explore the functions of a putative p53 
signaling domain. This region of the human p53 protein is localized between 
amino acids 61 and 94 (out of 393) and is noteworthy in that it contains five 
repeats of the sequence PXXP (where P represents proline and X any amino acid). 
This motif has been shown to play a role in signal transduction via its SH3 
domain binding activity. A p53 cDNA deletion mutant (delta pro AE), which lacks 
this entire proline-rich domain (deleted for amino acids 62-91), was created and 
characterized for a variety of p53 functions. The entire domain has been shown 
to be completely dispensable for transcriptional activation. On the other hand, 
this deletion of the p53 proline-rich domain impairs p53's ability to suppress 
tumor cell growth in culture. Amino acid substitution mutations at residues 22 
and 23 of p53 (eliminates transcriptional activity) also impair p53-mediated 
inhibition of cell growth in culture. Unlike wild-type p53, the delta proAE 
mutant cDNA can be stably expressed in tumor derived cell lines with few 
immediate detrimental effects. These cells express physiologic levels of p53 
protein that are induced normally in response to DNA damage, indicating that 
removal of the proline-rich domain does not disrupt p53's upstream regulation by 
DNA damage. These data indicate that, in addition to the transcriptional 
activation domain, the p53 proline-rich domain plays a critical role in the 
transmission of antiproliferative signals down-stream of the p53 protein and may 
link p53 to a direct signal transduction pathway.

Abstract

Activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein has been
 demonstrated to block cell growth by inducing either a transient cell
 cycle arrest or programmed cell death (apoptosis). Although
 evidence exists linking p53’s function as an activator of
 transcription to its ability to effect cell cycle arrest, the role of
 this activity in the induction of apoptosis remains unclear. To
 gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying p53-mediated
 antiproliferative pathways, a study was initiated to explore the
 functions of a putative p53 signaling domain. This region of the human
 p53 protein is localized between amino acids 61 and 94 (out of 393) and
 is noteworthy in that it contains five repeats of the sequence PXXP
 (where P represents proline and X any amino acid). This motif has been
 shown to play a role in signal transduction via its SH3 domain binding
 activity. A p53 cDNA deletion mutant (ΔproAE), which lacks this
 entire proline-rich domain (deleted for amino acids 62–91), was
 created and characterized for a variety of p53 functions. The entire
 domain has been shown to be completely dispensable for transcriptional
 activation. On the other hand, this deletion of the p53 proline-rich
 domain impairs p53’s ability to suppress tumor cell growth in culture.
 Amino acid substitution mutations at residues 22 and 23 of p53
 (eliminates transcriptional activity) also impair p53-mediated
 inhibition of cell growth in culture. Unlike wild-type p53, the
 ΔproAE mutant cDNA can be stably expressed in tumor derived cell
 lines with few immediate detrimental effects. These cells express
 physiologic levels of p53 protein that are induced normally in response
 to DNA damage, indicating that removal of the proline-rich domain does
 not disrupt p53’s upstream regulation by DNA damage. These data
 indicate that, in addition to the transcriptional activation domain,
 the p53 proline-rich domain plays a critical role in the transmission
 of antiproliferative signals downstream of the p53 protein and may link
 p53 to a direct signal transduction pathway.

DISCUSSION

The p53 protein has been divided into four domains; ( i )
 a transcriptional activation domain that contacts TAF components of
 TFIID (residues 1–40; refs. 18 and 19 ); ( ii ) a
 sequence-specific DNA binding domain (residues 120–290; refs. 16 and 17 ); ( iii ) a tetramerization domain (residues 310–360; ref.
 20); and ( iv ) a domain that recognizes and binds to damaged
 DNA nonspecifically (residues 364–390; refs. 46 and 47 ). This
 manuscript describes a new fifth functional domain, localized between
 residues 61–94, containing a putative proline-rich signaling domain.
 Deletion of this domain from the p53 protein leaves a normal p53
 protein with respect to transcriptional transactivation. Therefore,
 despite its physical juxtaposition between the transcriptional
 activation and DNA binding domains, the proline-rich region of p53 is
 not essential to the function of these domains. Because the
 proline-rich domain of p53 is dispensable for transactivation, the
 ΔproAE mutant serves as a useful tool to address the question of
 whether transcriptional activation alone is sufficient for the
 transmission of p53-dependent antiproliferative signals.

Analysis of the ΔproAE mutant in assays designed to measure
 biological activity has revealed that it is severely compromised for
 growth suppression. This defect manifests in both the plating
 efficiency assay (in which the ΔproAE mutant displays a <2-fold
 reduction in colony number) and in the ability to generate tumor cell
 lines which stably express this transcriptionally active p53 protein.
 These observations strongly suggest that transcriptional activation can
 be partially uncoupled from growth suppression and, moreover, that the
 proline-rich domain likely mediates an activity critical for
 p53-dependent tumor suppression in vivo . The results
 presented here have also demonstrated that cell lines stably expressing
 the ΔproAE mutant show a strong induction in the levels of this p53
 mutant protein in response to DNA damage. Thus, p53’s upstream
 regulation is intact in these cell lines, suggesting that p53’s
 proline-rich domain is likely to participate in the transmission of
 downstream antiproliferative signals.

It has previously been demonstrated that cell lines in which p53
 activation is achieved through the conditional expression of high
 levels of wild-type p53 protein can be blocked in a G1 cell cycle
 arrest ( 9 ). However, these same cells simultaneously expressing high
 levels of E2F-1 or c-Myc will, instead, undergo apoptosis ( 48 ).
 Thus, p53-mediated events in a cell have some method to detect and
 appropriately respond to signals generated from a variety of nuclear
 signal transduction pathways. Transmission of antiproliferative signals
 in 1299 cells then are likely to require the functions of both p53’s
 transactivation and proline-rich domains. Indeed, abrogation of just
 one of these domains does not completely eliminate p53’s ability to
 suppress the growth of tumor cells in culture, supporting the
 conclusion that both the transcriptional activation and proline-rich
 domains are necessary but neither is sufficient for wild-type function.
 In fact, continued passage of tumor cells lines that stably express
 either the 22-23 or ΔproAE mutants has revealed that the expression
 of both these proteins is selected against over time (unpublished
 observations). Thus, neither of these mutants is functionally inert in
 the H1299 cell line, in contrast to the tumor-derived mutant, R175H.

The p53 tumor suppressor protein has been implicated in the regulation
 of multiple cellular antiproliferative pathways, including those
 resulting in transient cell cycle arrest as well as that which leads to
 permanent cell death. The specificity of the p53-dependent response
 appears to be determined by multiple factors, including the nature of
 the signal as well as the physiologic status of the cell. This
 manuscript identifies a new domain of the p53 protein that possesses a
 new activity mediated by its proline-rich domain, which is involved in
 signaling for growth suppression. A reasonable hypothesis of how p53’s
 proline-rich domain may signal is via contacting an SH3 domain of
 another protein. Indeed, both full-length p53 and the domain
 corresponding to residues 61–94 display SH3 domain binding activity in vitro (K.K.W., A. Muller, and A.J.L., unpublished
 results). Thus, the p53 protein may use multiple mechanisms to inhibit
 cell growth, and the degree to which transcriptional regulation and
 direct signaling contribute to signal transmission will vary depending
 on the particular conditions.
