Organogenesis at the shoot meristem requires a delicate balance between stem 
cell specification and differentiation. In Arabidopsis thaliana, WUSCHEL (WUS) 
is a key factor promoting stem cell identity, whereas the CLAVATA (CLV1, CLV2, 
and CLV3) loci appear to promote differentiation by repressing WUS expression. 
In a screen for mutations modifying clv1 mutants, we have identified a novel 
regulator of meristem development we term CORONA (CNA). Whereas cna single 
mutant plants exhibit subtle defects in meristem development, clv cna double 
mutants develop massively enlarged apices that display early loss of 
organogenesis, misexpression of WUS and CLV3, and eventual differentiation of 
the entire apex. The CNA gene was isolated by positional cloning and found to 
encode a class III homeodomain Leu zipper protein. A missense mutation resulting 
in the dominant-negative cna-1 allele was identified in a conserved domain of 
unknown function, and a likely null allele was shown to display a similar but 
weaker phenotype. CNA is expressed in developing vascular tissue, diffusely 
through shoot and flower meristems, and within developing stamens and carpels. 
Our analysis of WUS expression in wild-type, clv, and clv cna plants revealed 
that, contrary to current models, WUS is neither necessary nor sufficient for 
stem cell specification and that neither WUS nor CLV3 is a marker for stem cell 
identity. We propose that CNA functions in parallel to the CLV loci to promote 
organ formation.

Abstract

Organogenesis at the shoot meristem requires a delicate balance between stem cell specification and differentiation. In Arabidopsis thaliana , WUSCHEL ( WUS ) is a key factor promoting stem cell identity, whereas the CLAVATA ( CLV1 , CLV2 , and CLV3 ) loci appear to promote differentiation by repressing WUS expression. In a screen for mutations modifying clv1 mutants, we have identified a novel regulator of meristem development we term CORONA ( CNA ). Whereas cna single mutant plants exhibit subtle defects in meristem development, clv cna double mutants develop massively enlarged apices that display early loss of organogenesis, misexpression of WUS and CLV3 , and eventual differentiation of the entire apex. The CNA gene was isolated by positional cloning and found to encode a class III homeodomain Leu zipper protein. A missense mutation resulting in the dominant-negative cna-1 allele was identified in a conserved domain of unknown function, and a likely null allele was shown to display a similar but weaker phenotype. CNA is expressed in developing vascular tissue, diffusely through shoot and flower meristems, and within developing stamens and carpels. Our analysis of WUS expression in wild-type, clv , and clv cna plants revealed that, contrary to current models, WUS is neither necessary nor sufficient for stem cell specification and that neither WUS nor CLV3 is a marker for stem cell identity. We propose that CNA functions in parallel to the CLV loci to promote organ formation.

INTRODUCTION

A central feature of plant development is the continuous generation of organs throughout the plant's lifespan. The capacity to generate new above-ground organs post-embryonically is a property of shoot meristems. Within shoot meristems reside stem cells that are maintained at a constant number while giving rise to organ primordia and ultimately all of the differentiated cells of organs and tissues ( Steeves and Sussex, 1989 ). In this way, shoot meristems have the capacity to balance perpetual differentiation of cells while replenishing the pool of undifferentiated, pluripotent cells.

Genetic screens have identified several key regulators of shoot meristem development ( Barton and Peothig, 1993 ; Clark et al., 1993 ; Laux et al., 1996 ; Pogany et al., 1998 ; Yu et al., 2000 ). The WUSCHEL ( WUS ) gene encodes a homeodomain protein, which is an important regulator of stem cell identity ( Mayer et al., 1998 ; Schoof et al., 2000 ). Loss-of-function wus mutants fail to organize functional shoot meristems. After germination, wus mutants sporadically generate adventitious shoots, which form only a few organs before termination ( Endrizzi et al., 1996 ; Laux et al., 1996 ). Expression of WUS within the meristem appears to be sufficient for establishing stem cell identity. When WUS was ectopically expressed, transgenic seedlings accumulate undifferentiated stem cells ( Schoof et al., 2000 ).

Three CLAVATA genes ( CLV1 , CLV2 , and CLV3 ) promote the differentiation of stem cells. Loss-of-function clv1 , clv2 , and clv3 mutants accumulate undifferentiated cells in shoot and floral meristems, resulting in meristems that are significantly larger than the wild type and in flowers with increased numbers of floral organs ( Clark et al., 1993 , 1995 ; Jeong et al., 1999 ). The CLV1 , CLV2 , and CLV3 loci encode signal transduction components: a receptor kinase ( Clark et al., 1997 ), a receptor-like protein ( Jeong et al., 1999 ), and a small secreted protein ( Fletcher et al., 1999 ), respectively.

WUS is a key target of the CLV signal transduction pathway ( Brand et al., 2000 ; Schoof et al., 2000 ). In wild-type plants, the domain of WUS expression is normally restricted to a small, centrally located subset of cells beneath the three outermost cell layers ( Mayer et al., 1998 ; Schoof et al., 2000 ). In clv3 mutant meristems, the WUS expression domain expands laterally and apically into the topmost cells of the L3 layer ( Brand et al., 2000 ; Schoof et al., 2000 ). Conversely, plants overexpressing CLV3 recreate the Wus âˆ’ phenotype and do not appear to express WUS mRNA ( Brand et al., 2000 ), indicating that the CLV signaling pathway limits stem cell number by restricting the size of the WUS expression domain.

Overexpression of WUS through promoter fusions can also lead to ectopic stem cell accumulation ( Schoof et al., 2000 ). Interestingly, transcripts of CLV3 are found on the periphery of stem cell masses formed by WUS overexpression, whereas in the meristems of wild-type plants, CLV3 expression is restricted to the center of the shoot meristem ( Fletcher et al., 1999 ; Schoof et al., 2000 ). These expression analyses indicate that while the CLV signaling pathway targets WUS and restricts its activity, WUS activity is also sufficient to induce transcription of CLV3 . This regulatory feedback loop may act to maintain strict control of the number of stem cells.

In this study, we describe a novel regulator of shoot meristem development, CORONA . We show that CNA encodes a class III homeodomain Leu zipper (HD-Zip III) transcription factor that plays an important role in the maintenance of stem cell function. Members of this gene family, which also includes the REVOLUTA ( REV ), PHABULOSA ( PHB ), PHAVOLUTA ( PHV ), and ATHB8 genes, have previously been implicated in several aspects of Arabidopsis thaliana development, including meristem and organ development ( Talbert et al., 1995 ; McConnell and Barton, 1998 ; Zhong and Ye, 1999 ; Baima et al., 2001 ; McConnell et al., 2001 ; Otsuga et al., 2001 ; Zhong and Ye, 2001 ; Prigge et al., 2005 ). In addition, we show that WUS expression might not be necessary for stem cell specification in clv3-2 mutants. The latter finding suggests that a WUS independent pathway exists and is involved in specifying stem cell identity at certain stages in development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WUS and CLV3 expression can be found in differentiated tissues.

DISCUSSION

We have identified CNA as a novel regulator of meristem development. In a clv background, mutations within the CNA gene led to dramatic defects in meristem size, organogenesis, stem cell maintenance, and the expression of WUS and CLV3 . We propose that CNA acts in parallel with the CLV pathway to promote organ formation. We show that CNA corresponds to ATHB15 , a member of the HD-Zip III gene family, and that CNA is expressed strongly within developing vascular elements and diffusely within developing meristems and organ primordia. The putative dominant-negative cna-1 allele appears to interfere with the function of both HD-Zip III family members as well as other genes. While investigating CLV3 and WUS expression within clv and clv cna plants, we observed that WUS may be neither necessary nor sufficient for stem cell specification and that CLV3 expression may not be a marker for stem cell identity, in contradiction to the existing paradigm in the field.
