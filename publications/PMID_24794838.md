Client protein recruitment to the Hsp90 system depends on cochaperones that bind 
the client and Hsp90 simultaneously and facilitate their interaction. Hsp90 
involvement in the assembly of snoRNPs, RNA polymerases, PI3-kinase-like 
kinases, and chromatin remodeling complexes depends on the TTT (Tel2-Tti1-Tti2), 
and R2TP complexes-consisting of the AAA-ATPases Rvb1 and Rvb2, Tah1 
(Spagh/RPAP3 in metazoa), and Pih1 (Pih1D1 in humans)-that together provide the 
connection to Hsp90. The biochemistry underlying R2TP function is still poorly 
understood. Pih1 in particular, at the heart of the complex, has not been 
described at a structural level, nor have the multiple protein-protein 
interactions it mediates been characterized. Here we present a structural and 
biochemical analysis of Hsp90-Tah1-Pih1, Hsp90-Spagh, and Pih1D1-Tel2 complexes 
that reveal a domain in Pih1D1 specific for binding CK2 phosphorylation sites, 
and together define the structural basis by which the R2TP complex connects the 
Hsp90 chaperone system to the TTT complex.
