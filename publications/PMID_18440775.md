Proteomic analysis identified HSP27 phosphorylation as a major change in protein 
phosphorylation stimulated by Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in Human 
Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC). VEGF-induced HSP27 phosphorylation at 
serines 15, 78 and 82, but whereas HSP27 phosphorylation induced by H2O2 and 
TNFalpha was completely blocked by the p38 kinase inhibitor, SB203580, 
VEGF-stimulated serine 82 phosphorylation was resistant to SB203580 and small 
interfering(si)RNA-mediated knockdown of p38 kinase and MAPKAPK2. The PKC 
inhibitor, GF109203X, partially reduced VEGF-induced HSP27 serine 82 
phosphorylation, and SB203580 plus GF109203X abolished phosphorylation. VEGF 
activated Protein Kinase D (PKD) via PKC, and siRNAs targeted to PKD1 and PKD2 
inhibited VEGF-induced HSP27 serine 82 phosphorylation. Furthermore recombinant 
PKD selectively phosphorylated HSP27 at serine 82 in vitro, and PKD2 activated 
by VEGF in HUVECs also phosphorylated HSP27 selectively at this site. Knockdown 
of HSP27 and PKDs markedly inhibited VEGF-induced HUVEC migration and 
tubulogenesis, whereas inhibition of the p38 kinase pathway using either 
SB203580 or siRNAs against p38alpha or MAPKAPK2, had no significant effect on 
the chemotactic response to VEGF. These findings identify a novel pathway for 
VEGF-induced HSP27 serine 82 phosphorylation via PKC-mediated PKD activation and 
direct phosphorylation of HSP27 by PKD, and show that PKDs and HSP27 play major 
roles in the angiogenic response to VEGF.
