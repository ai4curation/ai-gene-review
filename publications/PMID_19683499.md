FACT has been proposed to function by displacing H2A-H2B dimers from nucleosomes 
to form hexasomes. Results described here with yeast FACT (yFACT) suggest 
instead that nucleosomes are reorganized to a form with the original composition 
but a looser, more dynamic structure. First, yFACT enhances hydroxyl radical 
accessibility and endonuclease digestion in vitro at sites throughout the 
nucleosome, not just in regions contacted by H2A-H2B. Accessibility increases 
dramatically, but the DNA remains partially protected. Second, increased 
nuclease sensitivity can occur without displacement of dimers from the 
nucleosome. Third, yFACT is required for eviction of nucleosomes from the 
GAL1-10 promoter during transcriptional activation in vivo, but the preferential 
reduction in dimer occupancy expected for hexasome formation is not observed. We 
propose that yFACT promotes a reversible transition between two nucleosomal 
forms, and that this activity contributes to the establishment and maintenance 
of the chromatin barrier as well as to overcoming it.
