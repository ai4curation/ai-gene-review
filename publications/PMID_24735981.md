An abundance of microfibril-associated glycoprotein 3-like (MFAP3L) 
significantly correlates with distant metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC), 
although the mechanism has yet to be explained. In this study, we observed that 
MFAP3L knock-down resulted in reduced CRC cell invasion and hepatic metastasis. 
We evaluated the cellular location and biochemical functions of MFAP3L and found 
that this protein was primarily localized in the nucleus of CRC cells and acted 
as a protein kinase. When EGFR translocated into the nucleus upon stimulation 
with EGF, MFAP3L was phosphorylated at Tyr287 within its SH2 motif, and the 
activated form of MFAP3L phosphorylated ERK2 at Thr185 and Tyr187. Moreover, the 
metastatic behavior of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo could be partially 
explained by activation of the nuclear ERK pathway through MFAP3L 
phosphorylation. Hence, we experimentally demonstrated for the first time that 
MFAP3L likely participates in the nuclear signaling of EGFR and ERK2 and acts as 
a novel nuclear kinase that impacts CRC metastasis.
