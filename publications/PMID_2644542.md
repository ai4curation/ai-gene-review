Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) catalyses the cis-trans 
isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides and has been 
shown to accelerate the refolding of several proteins in vitro. Its activity has 
been detected in yeast, insects and Escherichia coli as well as in mammals, and 
it is though to be essential for protein folding during protein synthesis in the 
cell. We purified PPIase from pig kidney and found that its amino-acid sequence 
is identical to that reported for bovine cyclophilin, a protein known to bind 
the immunosuppressive drug, cyclosporin A (ref. 5). To investigate the 
functional relationship between PPIase and cyclophilin we examined the effect of 
cyclosporin A on PPIase activity and found that it was inhibitory. Thus we 
propose that the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerizing activity of PPIase may be 
involved in events, such as those occurring early in T-cell activation, that are 
suppressed by cyclosporin A.
