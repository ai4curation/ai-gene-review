TMEM39A, encoding an ER-localized transmembrane protein, is a susceptibility 
locus for multiple autoimmune diseases. The molecular function of TMEM39A 
remains completely unknown. Here we demonstrated that TMEM39A, also called 
SUSR2, modulates autophagy activity by regulating the spatial distribution and 
levels of PtdIns(4)P. Depletion of SUSR2 elevates late endosomal/lysosomal 
PtdIns(4)P levels, facilitating recruitment of the HOPS complex to promote 
assembly of the SNARE complex for autophagosome maturation. SUSR2 knockdown also 
increases the degradative capability of lysosomes. Mechanistically, SUSR2 
interacts with the ER-localized PtdIns(4)P phosphatase SAC1 and also the COPII 
SEC23/SEC24 subunits to promote the ER-to-Golgi transport of SAC1. Retention of 
SAC1 on the ER in SUSR2 knockdown cells increases the level of PtdIns(3)P 
produced by the VPS34 complex, promoting autophagosome formation. Our study 
reveals that TMEM39A/SUSR2 acts as an adaptor protein for efficient export of 
SAC1 from the ER and provides insights into the pathogenesis of diseases 
associated with TMEM39A mutations.
