Desmoglein 2 (Dsg2) is a Ca(2+)-dependent adhesion molecule of desmosomes and is 
synthesized in all desmosome-bearing tissues from their earliest appearance 
onward. To examine the function of Dsg2, its gene was inactivated by homologous 
recombination in embryonal stem (ES) cells for the generation of knockout mice. 
DSG2 -/- mice and a considerable number of DSG2 +/- mice died at or shortly 
after implantation. On the other hand, DSG2 -/- blastocysts developed an 
apparently normal trophectoderm layer, the first tissue known to produce 
desmosomes, and hatched properly. Immunofluorescence analyses of these 
blastocysts showed, however, that the distribution of the desmosomal plaque 
protein desmoplakin was disturbed, whereas the adherens junction proteins 
E-cadherin and beta-catenin appeared to be unaffected. Unexpectedly, we found 
that Dsg2 seems to be essential for the inner cell mass and the ES cell 
population derived there from. We present evidence that Dsg2, which is located 
in desmoplakin-negative wild-type ES cells in non-desmosomal junctions, is 
needed for normal ES cell proliferation. Our observations thus reveal that 
important Dsg2 functions are desmosome-independent during early development and 
are needed for ES cell and early embryo survival.
