Werner's syndrome (WS) is an inherited disease with clinical symptoms which 
resemble premature aging. The Werner's syndrome gene (WRN), which is located on 
human chromosome 8p12, encodes a predicted protein of 1432 amino acids and shows 
significant similarity to DNA helicases. We have cloned the full-length mouse 
cDNA homologue of the human WRN gene encoding a predicted protein of 1320 amino 
acids and have obtained a full-length 70 kb genomic clone containing the moWRN 
gene. This gene has been mapped to chromosome 8A3 in mice. The expression of the 
moWRN gene was increased during apoptosis after IL-2 deprivation, and decreased 
in the spleen of aged mice. Lymphoid cells isolated from a patient with WS 
exhibited increased apoptosis after incubation with anti-Fas but not after 
incubation with the topoisomerase inhibitor VP16. RNase protection reviled 
dysregulation of the ICE family of apoptosis molecules in the WS cell line. 
These results indicate that the WS helicase is involved in certain pathways of 
apoptosis, and defective WS gene expression leads to accumulation of cells that 
are highly susceptibility to Fas-induced apoptosis.
