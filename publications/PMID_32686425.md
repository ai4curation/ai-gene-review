Lanmodulin (LanM) is a recently discovered protein that undergoes a large 
conformational change in response to rare-earth elements (REEs). Here, we use 
multiple physicochemical methods to demonstrate that LanM is the most selective 
macromolecule for REEs characterized to date and even outperforms many synthetic 
chelators. Moreover, LanM exhibits metal-binding properties and structural 
stability unseen in most other metalloproteins. LanM retains REE binding down to 
pH ≈ 2.5, and LanM-REE complexes withstand high temperature (up to 95 °C), 
repeated acid treatments, and up to molar amounts of competing non-REE metal 
ions (including Mg, Ca, Zn, and Cu), allowing the protein's use in harsh 
chemical processes. LanM's unrivaled properties were applied to metal extraction 
from two distinct REE-containing industrial feedstocks covering a broad range of 
REE and non-REE concentrations, namely, precombustion coal and electronic waste 
leachates. After only a single all-aqueous step, quantitative and selective 
recovery of the REEs from all non-REEs initially present (Li, Na, Mg, Ca, Sr, 
Al, Si, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and U) was achieved, demonstrating the universal 
selectivity of LanM for REEs against non-REEs and its potential application even 
for industrial low-grade sources, which are currently underutilized. Our work 
indicates that biosourced macromolecules such as LanM may offer a new paradigm 
for extractive metallurgy and other applications involving f-elements.
