The CIAO3 protein operates at a crossroad of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein 
assembly (CIA) machinery. Although the functional role of CIAO3 has been 
recently characterized, a description of its interaction network is still not 
complete. Literature data suggested that CIAO3 interacts individually with CIA2A 
and CIAO1 protein, with the latter two interacting each other. However, no 
experimental data are available yet showing the formation of a possible ternary 
complex composed by CIAO3, CIAO1, and CIA2A. This work shows, for the first 
time, via size exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light 
scattering, UV-vis absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) 
spectroscopies, the formation of a stable, [4Fe-4S]-bound, complex, composed by 
CIAO3 and the hetero-CIA2A-CIAO1 complex. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis 
data suggested a structural role for the C-terminal [4Fe-4S] cluster of the 
CIAO3 protein. These findings can provide solid bases for further investigation 
of the molecular mechanisms involving these CIA machinery proteins.
