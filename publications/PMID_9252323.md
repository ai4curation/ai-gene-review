A C. elegans neurosecretory signaling system regulates whether animals enter the 
reproductive life cycle or arrest development at the long-lived dauer diapause 
stage. daf-2, a key gene in the genetic pathway that mediates this endocrine 
signaling, encodes an insulin receptor family member. Decreases in DAF-2 
signaling induce metabolic and developmental changes, as in mammalian metabolic 
control by the insulin receptor. Decreased DAF-2 signaling also causes an 
increase in life-span. Life-span regulation by insulin-like metabolic control is 
analogous to mammalian longevity enhancement induced by caloric restriction, 
suggesting a general link between metabolism, diapause, and longevity.
