The inositol pyrophosphate disphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate 
(PP-InsP(3)/InsP(7)) is formed in mammals by two recently cloned inositol 
hexakiphosphate kinases, InsP(6)K1 and InsP(6)K2 (Saiardi, A., 
Erdjument-Bromage, H., Snowman, A. M., Tempst, P., and Snyder, S. H. (1999) 
Curr. Biol. 9, 1323-1326). We now report the identification, cloning, and 
characterization of a third InsP(7) forming enzyme designated InsP(6)K3. 
InsP(6)K3 displays 50 and 45% sequence identity to InsP(6)K1 and InsP(6)K2, 
respectively, with a smaller mass (46 kDa) and a more basic character than the 
other two enzymes. InsP(6)K3 is most enriched in the brain where its 
localization resembles InsP(6)K1 and InsP(6)K2. Intracellular disposition 
discriminates the three enzymes with InsP(6)K2 being exclusively nuclear, 
InsP(6)K3 predominating in the cytoplasm, and InsP(6)K1 displaying comparable 
nuclear and cytosolic densities.
