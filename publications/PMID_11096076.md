Glutamine has been known to be an apoptosis suppressor, since it blocks 
apoptosis induced by heat shock, irradiation, and c-Myc overexpression. Here, we 
demonstrated that HeLa cells were susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis under 
the condition of glutamine deprivation. Fas ligation activated apoptosis 
signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK; also known 
as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)) in Gln-deprived cells but not in 
normal cells, suggesting that Gln might be involved in the activity control of 
ASK1 and JNK/SAPK. As one of the possible mechanisms for the suppressive effect 
of Gln on ASK1, we investigated the molecular interaction between human 
glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (QRS) and ASK1 and found the Gln-dependent 
association of the two molecules. While their association was enhanced by the 
elevation of Gln concentration, they were dissociated by Fas ligation within 5 
min. The association involved the catalytic domains of the two enzymes. The ASK1 
activity was inhibited by the interaction with QRS as determined by in vitro 
kinase and transcription assays. Finally, we have shown that QRS inhibited the 
cell death induced by ASK1, and this antiapoptotic function of QRS was weakened 
by the deprivation of Gln. Thus, the antiapoptotic interaction of QRS with ASK1 
is controlled positively by the cellular concentration of Gln and negatively by 
Fas ligation. The results of this work provide one possible explanation for the 
working mechanism of the antiapoptotic activity of Gln and suggest a novel 
function of mammalian ARSs.
