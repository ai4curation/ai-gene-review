A cDNA encoding a protein that binds retinoic acid with high affinity has been 
cloned. The protein is homologous to the receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid 
hormones and vitamin D3, and appears to be a retinoic acid-inducible 
trans-acting enhancer factor, suggesting that the molecular mechanisms of the 
effect of retinoids (vitamin A) on embryonic development, differentiation and 
tumour cell growth are similar to those described for other members of this 
nuclear receptor family.
