In Caenorhabditis elegans, the mechanisms regulating germline apoptosis remain 
largely unknown, except for the core machinery. Here, we found that mutants of 
pgl-1 and pgl-3, encoding members of a family of constitutive protein components 
of germline-specific P granules, showed increased germline apoptosis under both 
physiological and DNA-damaged conditions. We also found that the number of germ 
cells that lost PGL proteins increased significantly following UV irradiation, 
and that only those PGL-absent germ cells were selectively engulfed by gonadal 
sheath cells in adult hermaphrodite gonads. We further revealed that CEP-1, the 
p53 homolog, and the caspase CED-3 promoted elimination of PGL-1 from germ cells 
following UV irradiation. Furthermore, protein levels of CED-4, the Apaf-1 
homolog, and cytoplasmic translocation of SIR-2.1, a Sirtuin homolog, 
significantly increased in pgl mutants and increased even more following UV 
irradiation. CED-4 and SIR-2.1 were essential for high levels of germline 
apoptosis in pgl mutants. We conclude that PGL proteins suppress excessive 
germline apoptosis by repressing both the protein levels of CED-4 and the 
cytoplasmic translocation of SIR-2.1. Our study has revealed new roles for PGL-1 
and PGL-3 in the control of germline apoptosis.
