Endothelial cells approaching confluence exhibit marked decreases in tyrosine 
phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases and adherens junctions proteins, 
required for cell cycle arrest and adherens junctions stability. Recently, we 
demonstrated a close correlation in endothelial cells between membrane 
cholesterol and tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junctions proteins. Here, 
we probe the mechanistic basis for this correlation. We find that as endothelial 
cells reach confluence, the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 is recruited to a 
low-density membrane fraction in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Binding of 
SHP-2 to this fraction was not abolished by phenyl phosphate, strongly 
suggesting that this binding was mediated by other regions of SHP-2 beside its 
SH2 domains. Annexin II, previously implicated in cholesterol trafficking, was 
associated in a complex with SHP-2, and both proteins localized to adhesion 
bands in confluent endothelial monolayers. These studies reveal a novel, 
cholesterol-dependent mechanism for the recruitment of signaling proteins to 
specific plasma membrane domains via their interactions with annexin II.
