We have carried out a large-scale identification and characterization of human 
genes that activate the NF-kappaB and MARK signaling pathways. We constructed 
full-length cDNA libraries using the oligo-capping method and prepared an 
arrayed cDNA pool consisting of 150 000 cDNAs randomly isolated from the 
libraries. For analysis of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, we introduced each 
of the cDNAs into human embryonic kidney 293 cells and examined whether it 
activated the transcription of a luciferase reporter gene driven by a promoter 
containing the consensus NF-kappaB binding sites. In total, we identified 299 
cDNAs that activate the NF-kappaB pathway, and we classified them into 83 genes, 
including 30 characterized activator genes of the NF-kappaB pathway, 28 genes 
whose involvement in the NF-kappaB pathways have not been characterized and 25 
novel genes. We then carried out a similar analysis for the identification of 
genes that activate the MARK pathway, utilizing the same cDNA resource. We 
assayed 145 000 cDNAs and identified 57 genes that activate the MARK pathway. 
Interestingly, 27 genes were overlapping between the NF-kappaB and the MAPK 
pathways, which may indicate that these genes play cross-talking roles between 
these two pathways.
