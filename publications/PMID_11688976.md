Cyclophilins A and B (CyPA and CyPB) are cyclosporin A binding proteins that can 
be secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli. We recently identified CD147 as 
a cell-surface receptor for CyPA and demonstrated that CD147 is an essential 
component in the CyPA-initiated signaling cascade that culminates in ERK 
activation and chemotaxis. Here we demonstrate that CD147 also serves as a 
receptor for CyPB. CyPB induced Ca(2+) flux and chemotaxis of CD147-transfected, 
but not control, CHO cells, and the chemotactic response of primary human 
neutrophils to CyPB was blocked by antibodies to CD147. These results suggest 
that CD147 serves as a receptor for extracellular cyclophilins.
