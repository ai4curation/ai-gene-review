Cells respond to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) by increasing transcription of genes encoding ER-resident 
proteins. The information is transmitted from the ER lumen to the nucleus by an 
intracellular signaling pathway, the unfolded protein response (UPR). We have 
identified a basic-leucine zipper transcription factor, Hac1p, that is required 
for the UPR and binds to the UPR element in the promoter of UPR-regulated genes. 
Surprisingly, Hac1p is found in UPR-activated cells only, and its level is 
controlled by regulated splicing of its mRNA. Splicing replaces the C-terminal 
tail of Hac1p with a different peptide that renders Hac1p more resistant to an 
otherwise extremely rapid ubiquitin-dependent degradation. We propose that the 
complex regulation of Hac1p expression serves to provide multiple levels at 
which the UPR can be controlled.
