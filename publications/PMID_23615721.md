Sperm undergo maturation acquiring progressive motility and the ability to 
fertilize oocytes through exposure to the components of the epididymal fluid 
(EF). Although the establishment of a calcium (Ca(2+)) gradient along the 
epididymis has been described, its direct effects on epididymal function remain 
poorly explored. Regucalcin (RGN) is a Ca(2+)-binding protein, regulating the 
activity of Ca(2+)-channels and Ca(2+)-ATPase, for which a role in male 
reproductive function has been suggested. This study aimed at comparing the 
morphology, assessed by histological analysis, and function of epididymis, by 
analysis of sperm parameters, antioxidant potential and Ca(2+) fluxes, between 
transgenic rats overexpressing RGN (Tg-RGN) and their wild-type littermates. 
Tg-RGN animals displayed an altered morphology of epididymis and lower sperm 
counts and motility. Tissue incubation with (45)Ca(2+) showed also that 
epididymis of Tg-RGN displayed a diminished rate of Ca(2+)-influx, indicating 
unbalanced Ca(2+) concentrations in the epididymal lumen. Sperm viability and 
the frequency of normal sperm, determined by the one-step eosin-nigrosin 
staining technique and the Diff-Quik staining method, respectively, were higher 
in Tg-RGN. Moreover, sperm of Tg-RGN rats showed a diminished incidence of tail 
defects. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of RGN in EF as well as 
its higher expression in the corpus region. The results presented herein 
demonstrated the importance of maintaining Ca(2+)-levels in the epididymal lumen 
and suggest a role for RGN in sperm maturation. Overall, a new insight into the 
molecular mechanisms driving epididymal sperm maturation was obtained, which 
could be relevant to development of better approaches in male infertility 
treatment and contraception.

What is the implication, and what should change now?

• The findings imply that Sustanon use can lead to significant reproductive dysfunction and infertility.

• There is a need for increased awareness about the adverse effects of Sustanon among athletes and bodybuilders. Policies should be developed to regulate the use of AAS and promote safer alternatives for muscle building.

IntroductionAnabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) represent a broad category of synthetic derivatives of the male sex hormone testosterone. These compounds are engineered to mimic the effects of natural testosterone, enhancing muscle growth and physical performance. Among these, Sustanon is a prominent example, characterized by its unique formulation of four distinct testosterone esters: testosterone propionate, testosterone phenylpropionate, testosterone isocaproate, and testosterone decanoate. This combination allows for a prolonged and steady release of testosterone into the bloodstream, stabilizing hormone levels for up to 3–4 weeks (1,2). Initially developed for the clinical management of conditions such as male hypogonadism and infertility, Sustanon has also found use in bodybuilding and athletic circles, often for its muscle-building and performance-enhancing properties (3,4).The clinical applications of Sustanon are rooted in its ability to provide sustained testosterone replacement therapy, which is essential for individuals with low endogenous testosterone levels (5). Male hypogonadism, a condition characterized by insufficient testosterone production, can lead to a range of symptoms including reduced libido, fatigue, and diminished muscle mass. Sustanon’s unique formulation addresses these issues by delivering a continuous supply of testosterone, thereby alleviating symptoms and improving overall well-being (6). Similarly, in the context of infertility, testosterone replacement can help restore normal spermatogenesis, the process by which sperm cells are produced in the testes (7).The use of Sustanon extends beyond its therapeutic indications. In the athletic and bodybuilding communities, Sustanon is often used non-medically to enhance physical performance and muscle mass (8). Athletes and bodybuilders may misuse this steroid to gain a competitive edge, increase muscle hypertrophy, and improve strength (9). Despite its potential benefits, the non-medical use of Sustanon raises significant health concerns, particularly regarding its effects on male reproductive health (10). Since athletes, especially young people in Iran, frequently use Sustanon to increase muscle mass, this study focuses on its effects on fertility and reproductive health.One of the major concerns with Sustanon use is its impact on spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis is a highly regulated process that involves the production and maturation of sperm cells within the testes (11). This process relies on a delicate balance of hormonal signals, primarily testosterone, which is crucial for the progression of spermatogenesis through various stages, including stem cell proliferation, differentiation, chromatin condensation, and meiotic cell divisions. Elevated levels of exogenous testosterone from Sustanon can disrupt this balance, leading to a suppression of spermatogenesis and potential infertility (12).The mechanisms underlying this suppression are complex. Testosterone plays a key role in the regulation of spermatogenesis by binding to androgen receptors in the testes (13). This interaction facilitates the progression through the meiotic cycle and the production of mature sperm cells. However, when testosterone levels are artificially elevated, the body may perceive this as a signal to downregulate its own production of testosterone. This feedback inhibition can result in decreased stimulation of the testes, leading to reduced sperm production and impaired fertility (14).Additionally, the process of spermatogenesis is intertwined with programmed cell death, or apoptosis, which is essential for maintaining the health and quality of sperm cells (15). Apoptosis in the testes serves to eliminate defective germ cells and prevent the overproduction of sperm. This process is regulated through intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, with the intrinsic pathway involving mitochondrial function playing a particularly critical role in male fertility. Disruption of these apoptotic pathways can further contribute to the adverse effects of Sustanon on spermatogenesis (16).Several studies have investigated the effects of Sustanon on male reproductive health, highlighting its potential to disrupt spermatogenesis and induce apoptosis. For instance, research by Bameri et al. (17) demonstrated that Sustanon treatment resulted in significantly lower expression of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene, a key regulator of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, in treated groups compared to controls. This decrease in BCL2 expression indicates increased apoptosis and further underscores the negative impact of Sustanon on spermatogenesis. Additionally, the study observed reductions in testicular size, weight, sperm count, and concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), alongside notable histopathological changes in the testes.This study also uniquely investigates the role of deleted in azoospermia like (DAZL), which is essential for normal spermatogenesis and germ cell development. While Bameri et al. focused on general reproductive impacts (17), we explore the gene-specific effects of Sustanon on DAZL expression, offering a more in-depth understanding of the molecular pathways affected by this steroid. By including a gene-level analysis, our research highlights how Sustanon can compromise fertility through both hormonal disruption and genetic regulation.The misuse of Sustanon among athletes poses significant risks to male reproductive health, primarily through disruptions in spermatogenesis and induction of apoptosis. While Sustanon has therapeutic potential in treating certain andrological conditions, its non-medical use should be approached with caution due to its potential adverse effects. This study aims to address some of the existing gaps by investigating the molecular effects of Sustanon, specifically focusing on its impact on BCL2 and DAZL gene expression.

Introduction

Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) represent a broad category of synthetic derivatives of the male sex hormone testosterone. These compounds are engineered to mimic the effects of natural testosterone, enhancing muscle growth and physical performance.

MethodsStudy populationIn this study, 24 adult male Wistar rats, each weighing between 200 and 250 grams at the start of the experiment, were bought from the Laboratory Animal Breeding Center, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran. The rats were housed in individual cages (six rats per cage) at the Animal House of Islamic Azad University, Mashhad Branch, Iran, where the entire experiment was conducted. Each ampoule contained 1 mL of Sustanon oil solution. Experiments were performed under a project license (No. IR.IAU.MSHD.REC.1398.214) granted by the Ethics Committee of Islamic Azad University, Mashhad Branch, in compliance with national guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. A protocol was prepared before the study without registration. The rats were maintained under standard laboratory conditions with a controlled environment of 24 °C and a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum.The rats were randomly divided into four groups. The first group received an intramuscular injection of peanut oil as a control. Groups 2, 3, and 4 were administered Sustanon at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg body weight, respectively, via intramuscular injection once a week for 8 weeks. Sustanon was dissolved in peanut oil to prepare the respective doses: for the 10 mg/kg dose, 1 mL of Sustanon was diluted in 99 mL of peanut oil; for the 20 mg/kg dose, 1 mL of Sustanon was diluted in 49 mL of peanut oil; and for the 30 mg/kg dose, 1 mL of Sustanon was diluted in 32 mL of peanut oil.Blood samplingAll the rats were sacrificed under anesthesia with diethyl ether at the end of the treatment course. Blood samples were collected and placed in complete blood count (CBC) tubes and clot tubes (18).Sperm count, morphology, and DNA fragmentation analysisAfter blood sampling, the testis and epididymis were removed. Sperm count, morphology, and DNA fragmentation were analyzed. Five millimeters of the epididymal cauda were incubated in 2 mL of Hams F10 medium at 37 °C. Fifty microliters of sperm were added to 1 mL of Hams F10 (dilution ratio of 1:20). Ten microliters of this solution were placed on a Neubauer counting chamber for counting sperms in five squares under a light microscope. The mean count was multiplied by 106 (9,19). The Diff-Quik rapid sperm staining kit (Dayan Zist Azma Co., Tehran, Iran) was used for morphological analysis (20-22). DNA fragmentation index was examined according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Dayan Zist Azma Co.), involving denaturation of sperm DNA and chromatin and observation of DNA strands as a halo around the sperm head (23).Measurement of testis weight and diameterThe testis weights and diameters of the control and treated rats were measured at the end of the experiment using a scale.Histological preparationThe left testis was extracted and fixed in Bouin’s solution, then dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions with increasing concentrations (50%, 70%, 95%, and 100%). The testis was then cleared in xylene and infiltrated with paraffin wax, before being embedded in paraffin. For histological analysis, hematoxylin and eosin staining was used on 5-µm serial sections of the testis. The specimens were examined under a light microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a DinoCapture camera 2.0 (version 1.5) (18).Isolation of total RNA and reverse transcription reactionTotal RNA was isolated using the Parstous kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol at Azad University, Mashhad, Iran. complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions (Parstous cDNA, Mashhad, Iran).Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)Table 1 illustrates the primers designed with AlleleID software (version 6.0) (24).

ResultsTestis weight, diameter, sperm count, and morphological analysisTable 2 presents an overview of significant reductions in the testicular weight, length, and diameter of the treatment groups compared to the control group. Exposure to Sustanon altered sperm chromatin and reduced viability (P<0.05). There was a significantly lower sperm count in the treatment group compared to the control group. Additionally, the results of the optical micrographs, shown in Table 3 and Figure 1, reveal various kinds of sperm deformities in the heads and tails of the rats in the exposed group.

DiscussionAAS are frequently used by athletes, bodybuilders, and youths to enhance muscle mass and physical endurance. However, the high consumption of AAS can lead to serious side effects, including testicular dysfunction, which can result in infertility. The increasing use of Sustanon by athletes to improve physical appearance prompted this study to investigate its effects on male reproductive health.In this study, doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg Sustanon were injected intramuscularly into rats in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Our findings indicate that Sustanon administration induces adverse effects on the male reproductive system and decreases fertility.Testicular weight and sizeThe study reported a significant reduction in the mean testicular weight and diameter in the treatment groups compared to the control group. These results agree with findings from other studies (25,26). For example, Mohd Mutalip et al. (26) reported a significant decrease in testicular weight in male Sprague Dawley rats following the administration of testosterone and anabolic steroids for 6 weeks. The weight of reproductive tissue is an indicator of the endocrine effects of AAS. The suppressive effects on testis weights observed in our study indicate the impact of AAS on fertility, consistent with previous research (20,27). Chang et al. (28) also documented a reduction in testicular dimensions following AAS exposure.Hormonal impact and feedback mechanismExogenous testosterone, such as Sustanon, exerts a negative feedback effect on HPG axis, leading to the inhibition of endogenous testosterone production. The hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) regulates the synthesis and secretion of LH and FSH. FSH affects Sertoli cells, and its production in men is regulated by circulating testosterone and inhibin, both produced by the testes. FSH stimulates Sertoli cells to produce androgen-binding protein (ABP), which is crucial for spermatogenesis (29).Previous studies have suggested that weekly administration of nandrolone decanoate (10 mg/kg) can suppress the secretion of LH and FSH in treated animals (18,30). Our study supports these findings, demonstrating that Sustanon disrupts hormonal regulation, leading to decreased spermatogenesis and testicular atrophy.Sperm count, morphology, and DNA fragmentationSustanon treatment resulted in a significant reduction in sperm count and altered sperm morphology. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that AAS adversely affect sperm parameters. Testosterone is essential for continuous sperm production, and its reduction, along with oxidative damage, contributes to decreased sperm count and quality (21,31). Increased formation of free radicals and subsequent apoptosis of germ cells due to Sustanon administration likely explain the observed reduction in sperm count (32).AAS can increase germ cell apoptosis, with apoptosis in germ cells being associated with the Fas-signaling system activated by exogenous toxicants (33). Our study demonstrated that Sustanon increased apoptotic changes in the testes of treated rats, with histological changes including severe degradation of seminiferous tubules and increased germ cell apoptosis observed in the seminiferous epithelium (34). Nolan and Levy (35) reported that high doses of Sustanon induced early apoptotic activity in gonadectomized animals. These findings are in agreement with our results, highlighting the pro-apoptotic effects of Sustanon on germ cells (31).Gene expression: DAZL and BCL2This study evaluated the expression of DAZL and BCL2 genes, both of which play critical roles in spermatogenesis and apoptosis. Our findings revealed a significant decrease in BCL2 expression in the treatment groups compared to the control group (P<0.001), indicating increased apoptotic activity in the testes of Sustanon-treated rats. The BCL2 gene functions as a critical regulator of apoptosis, and its reduced expression suggests that Sustanon administration induces apoptosis, consistent with previous studies on AAS-induced apoptosis in testicular cells (25).Although the effects of Sustanon on BCL2 have been reported previously, our study sought to confirm these findings in the specific context of our experimental design, which also included sperm morphology and testicular histology. While other apoptosis markers such as Bax and the BAX/BCL2 ratio were not assessed in this study due to resource constraints, their inclusion in future research would further clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying Sustanon-induced apoptosis. These markers, when studied together, provide a more comprehensive view of the pro-apoptotic pathways activated by AAS, as suggested by other research.In contrast, DAZL, a gene essential for germ cell development and sexual differentiation (30,36), exhibited significantly higher expression in the group receiving 10 mg/kg of Sustanon compared to both the control and higher-dose groups (P<0.05). This finding is consistent with the work of Zhang et al. (37), which demonstrated that lower doses of AAS can enhance DAZL expression. DAZL is primarily active during the pachytene stage of spermatogenesis and is not dependent on gonadotropin regulation, which aligns with our observations that there was no significant increase in DAZL expression at the 20 and 30 mg/kg doses (38).

ConclusionsIn conclusion, this study confirms that Sustanon significantly adversely affects male reproductive health. The observed reductions in testicular weight, sperm count, and alterations in sperm morphology and DNA integrity highlight the detrimental impact of AAS on fertility. Disruptions in hormonal regulation and increased apoptosis further underscore the potential risks associated with Sustanon use. These findings are consistent with the theory underpinning our hypotheses and contribute to the existing body of knowledge by providing detailed insights into the specific effects of Sustanon on male reproductive parameters. These results emphasize the need for caution regarding AAS use, especially among athletes and individuals seeking to enhance physical performance.
