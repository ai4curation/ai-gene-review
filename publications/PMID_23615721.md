Sperm undergo maturation acquiring progressive motility and the ability to 
fertilize oocytes through exposure to the components of the epididymal fluid 
(EF). Although the establishment of a calcium (Ca(2+)) gradient along the 
epididymis has been described, its direct effects on epididymal function remain 
poorly explored. Regucalcin (RGN) is a Ca(2+)-binding protein, regulating the 
activity of Ca(2+)-channels and Ca(2+)-ATPase, for which a role in male 
reproductive function has been suggested. This study aimed at comparing the 
morphology, assessed by histological analysis, and function of epididymis, by 
analysis of sperm parameters, antioxidant potential and Ca(2+) fluxes, between 
transgenic rats overexpressing RGN (Tg-RGN) and their wild-type littermates. 
Tg-RGN animals displayed an altered morphology of epididymis and lower sperm 
counts and motility. Tissue incubation with (45)Ca(2+) showed also that 
epididymis of Tg-RGN displayed a diminished rate of Ca(2+)-influx, indicating 
unbalanced Ca(2+) concentrations in the epididymal lumen. Sperm viability and 
the frequency of normal sperm, determined by the one-step eosin-nigrosin 
staining technique and the Diff-Quik staining method, respectively, were higher 
in Tg-RGN. Moreover, sperm of Tg-RGN rats showed a diminished incidence of tail 
defects. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of RGN in EF as well as 
its higher expression in the corpus region. The results presented herein 
demonstrated the importance of maintaining Ca(2+)-levels in the epididymal lumen 
and suggest a role for RGN in sperm maturation. Overall, a new insight into the 
molecular mechanisms driving epididymal sperm maturation was obtained, which 
could be relevant to development of better approaches in male infertility 
treatment and contraception.
