Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) is a nuclear protein with both mitogenic 
and angiogenic activity that is highly expressed in the developing heart and 
vasculature. To date, the mechanism underlying the function of HDGF is unknown. 
Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was used to gain insights into HDGF 
function. Adenoviral expression of HDGF significantly (> or =2-fold) 
downregulated a large group (66) of genes, and increased expression of a 
relatively small number of genes (9). Two groups of target genes that are 
involved in cardiovascular development and transcriptional regulation, including 
the skeletal/cardiac muscle specific SET and MYND domain containing 1 (SMYD1) 
gene, were validated by real time PCR. This suggested that HDGF could function 
as a transcriptional repressor. In a one-hybrid system, GBD-HDGF significantly 
repressed reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent manner. This demonstrated 
that HDGF has transcriptional repressive activity. Moreover, in G-7 myoblast 
cells, over-expression of a GFP-HDGF fusion specifically downregulated SMYD1 
mRNA expression and the activity of the human SMYD1 promoter. HDGF repressed 
SMYD1 gene transcription through interaction with a transcriptional corepressor 
C-terminal binding protein (CtBP). Over-expression of CtBP potentiated the 
trans-repressive activity of HDGF; on the other hand, knocking down CtBP 
attenuated the trans-repressive effect of HDGF. HDGF binds CtBP through a 
non-canonical binding motif (PKDLF) within the PWWP domain, as mutation of DL to 
AS abolished HDGF and CtBP interaction, and diminished the trans-repressive 
effect of HDGF without affecting DNA binding. Finally, fluorescent microscopy 
showed that HDGF induced the nuclear accumulation of CtBP, suggesting that HDGF 
forms a transcriptional complex with CtBP. Taken together, our data demonstrate 
that HDGF functions as a transcriptional repressor of the SMYD1 gene through 
interaction with the transcriptional corepressor CtBP. Because of moderate 
conservation of the CtBP binding motif in HDGF family members, trans-repressive 
activity mediated by CtBP may be a common function among HDGF proteins.
