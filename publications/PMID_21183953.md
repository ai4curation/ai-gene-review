Gcn4p is a well-characterized bZIP transcription factor that activates more than 
500 genes encoding amino acids and purine biosynthesis enzymes, and many 
stress-response genes under various stress conditions. Under these stresses, it 
had been shown that transcriptions of ribosomal protein (RP) genes were 
decreased. However, the detailed mechanism of this downregulation has not been 
elucidated. In this study, we present a novel mechanistic model for a repressive 
role of Gcn4p on RP transcription, especially under amino-acid starvation. It 
was found that Gcn4p bound directly to Rap1p, which in turn inhibited 
Esa1p-Rap1p binding. The inhibition of Esa1p recruitment to RP promoters 
ultimately reduced the level of histone H4 acetylation and RP transcription. 
These data revealed that Gcn4p has simultaneous dual roles as a repressor for RP 
genes as well as an activator for amino-acid biosynthesis genes. Moreover, our 
results showed evidence of a novel link between general control of amino-acid 
biosynthesis and ribosome biogenesis mediated by Gcn4p at an early stage of 
adaptation to amino-acid starvation.
