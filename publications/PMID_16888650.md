Although glucocorticoid (GC)-induced nongenomic effects have been reported, the 
underlying mechanisms remain unexplained. We previously described that 
lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) and FYN oncogene related to 
SRC, FGR, YES (FYN) mediate GC-induced inhibition of T-cell-receptor (TCR) 
signalling. Here we characterize the underlying molecular mechanism. The present 
study shows that the GC receptor is part of a TCR-linked multiprotein complex 
containing heat-shock protein (HSP)90, LCK and FYN, which is essential for 
TCR-dependent LCK/FYN activation. Experiments with cells transfected with 
GC-receptor short interfering RNA (siRNA) showed that the GC receptor is an 
essential component of the TCR signalling complex. Short-term GC treatment 
induces dissociation of this protein complex, resulting in impaired TCR 
signalling as a consequence of abrogated LCK/FYN activation. 
HSP90siRNA-transfected cells are not able to assemble this TCR-associated 
multiprotein complex, and accordingly HSP90siRNA treatment mimics GC effects on 
LCK/FYN activities. These observations support a model for nongenomic GC-induced 
immunosuppression on the basis of dissolution of membrane-bound GC-receptor 
multiprotein complexes after GC-receptor ligation.

Abstract

Although glucocorticoid (GC)-induced nongenomic effects have been reported, the underlying mechanisms remain unexplained. We previously described that lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) and FYN oncogene related to SRC, FGR, YES (FYN) mediate GC-induced inhibition of T-cell-receptor (TCR) signalling. Here we characterize the underlying molecular mechanism. The present study shows that the GC receptor is part of a TCR-linked multiprotein complex containing heat-shock protein (HSP)90, LCK and FYN, which is essential for TCR-dependent LCK/FYN activation. Experiments with cells transfected with GC-receptor short interfering RNA (siRNA) showed that the GC receptor is an essential component of the TCR signalling complex. Short-term GC treatment induces dissociation of this protein complex, resulting in impaired TCR signalling as a consequence of abrogated LCK/FYN activation. HSP90siRNA-transfected cells are not able to assemble this TCR-associated multiprotein complex, and accordingly HSP90siRNA treatment mimics GC effects on LCK/FYN activities. These observations support a model for nongenomic GC-induced immunosuppression on the basis of dissolution of membrane-bound GC-receptor multiprotein complexes after GC-receptor ligation.

Introduction

Glucocorticoids (GCs) mediate their immunosuppressive effects through cytosolic ligand-inducible receptors ( Buttgereit et al , 2004 ). Inactive GC receptors (GRs) are associated with (co)chaperones, such as heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90), which dissociate after GR ligation, followed by nuclear translocation of GR and regulation of gene transcription ( Franchimont, 2004 ; Pratt et al , 2004 ). GCs also evoke nongenomic effects on cellular function, which occur in minutes ( Baus et al , 1996 ; Croxtall et al , 2000 ; Rhen & Cidlowski, 2005 ). Cardiovascular protective effects of GCs that could not be mediated by genomic mechanisms have been reported, because they occurred too fast and could not be blocked by a transcription inhibitor ( Hafezi-Moghadam et al , 2002 ). Recently, we generated a comprehensive profile of such GC-induced rapid effects on signal transduction using activated human CD4 + T lymphocytes and a peptide array for kinome analysis ( Lowenberg et al , 2005 ). The results showed marked early effects of GC treatment, in particular suppressed phosphorylation of LCK/FYN kinase consensus substrates. Further studies showed impaired recruitment of LCK and FYN to the T-cell-receptor (TCR) complex, resulting in reduced LCK/FYN enzymatic activities and impaired TCR signalling after short-term GC treatment. Although these studies identified LCK and FYN as cellular targets for nongenomic GC activities, the underlying mechanism remains unexplained.

LCK and FYN are members of the SRC family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases and have a key role in TCR signalling. TCR activation results in membrane translocation of LCK and FYN in an HSP90-dependent manner ( Bijlmakers & Marsh, 2000 ; Zamoyska et al , 2003 ; Palacios & Weiss, 2004 ). LCK predominantly associates with CD4 or CD8 cell-surface receptors and FYN binds to CD3 co-receptors, resulting in LCK and FYN kinase activation. Once activated, LCK and FYN phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the TCR, allowing downstream signal transduction and eventually T-cell cytokine production, proliferation and differentiation. GRs and SRC-like kinases share a requirement for HSP90 for proper functioning, opening the possibility that GR action on LCK and FYN activities is mediated by HSP90. The present study shows that GCs cause disruption of TCR-associated multiprotein complexes containing GR, HSP90, LCK and FYN, leading to reduced LCK/FYN enzymatic activities and impaired TCR signalling.

Discussion

GCs mediate well-defined genomic effects through GR-dependent transcriptional changes. Clinical and experimental evidence for rapid nongenomic GC action have accumulated, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unexplained. Oestrogens can induce rapid signalling through intracellular transmembrane oestrogen receptors, providing evidence for nongenomic effects of steroids on cellular physiology ( Revankar et al , 2005 ). Similarly, membrane-bound GRs have been identified in lymphocytes ( Gametchu et al , 1999 ; Gametchu & Watson, 2002 ) and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( Bartholome et al , 2004 ), but their functional relevance remains unclear. It is known that, at high concentrations, GCs increase GR saturation in a dose-dependent manner, which intensifies the therapeutically relevant genomic GC activities ( Buttgereit et al , 2002 ). Although saturation of cytosolic GRs is almost complete with 100 mg prednisone equivalent a day, the use of higher dosages (100–1,000 mg) is common and successful in daily clinical practice ( Buttgereit et al , 2004 ), possibly as a consequence of nongenomic effects ( Buttgereit et al , 1998 ). Nongenomic GC action is thought to be mediated through cytosolic or membrane-bound GRs and/or through nonspecific physicochemical interactions with membranes.

Nongenomic GC-induced inhibition of LCK/FYN-mediated TCR signalling has been reported ( Lowenberg et al , 2005 ), but the underlying mechanism remains unexplained. A relationship between GC stimulation and LCK/FYN kinases is supported by previous work, showing that prolonged DEX stimulation (enabling GC-induced genomic effects) disturbed the submembrane localization of LCK and FYN in murine T cells ( Van Laethem et al , 2001 ). It is possible that HSP90-dependent regulation of LCK and FYN contributes to these effects, but further studies are needed to clarify the role of GR and HSP90 in regulating TCR signalling.

On the basis of the present work, we propose a model arguing that, in the absence of ligand, the GR sustains a TCR-associated complex containing HSP90, LCK and FYN ( Fig 4 ). On GR–ligand binding, this membrane-bound multiprotein complex is dissociated, leading to a cellular redistribution of LCK and FYN and an inability of LCK/FYN to participate in TCR signalling. Our data show an essential role of HSP90 and GR in the formation of TCR-associated protein complexes and in the regulation of efficient TCR signalling. Overall, these results provide new insight into the nongenomic mechanism of GC-induced immunosuppression in T cells. Selective inhibition of proximal TCR signalling through LCK/FYN presents opportunities for the development of novel immunosuppressive therapies.

Methods

Cell culture. CD4 + T cells were purified from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and maintained as described previously ( Lowenberg et al , 2005 ).

Reagents and antibodies. A complete list of the antibodies can be found in the supplementary information online. DEX and geldanamycin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). HSP90α/βsiRNA, GRsiRNA, control siRNA and SAM68 were purchased from Santa Cruz (Heidelberg, Germany). Kinase buffer and lysis buffer (supplemented with 1 μg/ml NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 mM pefabloc) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverley, CA, USA).

Cell transfection. Cells were transfected by electroporation using routine procedures (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). Each nucleofection sample contained 5 × 10 6 cells, 2 μg of highly purified siRNA and 100 μl of human T-cell Nucleofector. To determine transfection efficiency, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged DNA (Amaxa) was used for electroporations, showing cells that were 40–50% GFP-positive 16 h after transfection, as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (data not shown).

Immunoprecipitation, in vitro kinase assay and immunoblotting. Cells were incubated at 37°C in six-well plates (5–10 × 10 6 cells/well) for 2 h followed by a 10 min pretreatment with 1 μM DEX dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) or DMSO-supplemented media (control). Cells were subsequently activated for 15 min with CD3 antibodies (immobilized on plastic) and soluble CD28 antibodies (3 μg/ml). Cells were centrifuged (1,750 r.p.m., 10 min), lysed in non-denaturing lysis buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by in vitro kinase assay and western blotting. The protocol for these procedures can be found in the supplementary information online.

Fluorescent double stainings. After in vitro stimulations, cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,750 r.p.m. and pellets were resuspended in PBS. SuperFrost ® plus microscope slides were pretreated with 0.01% poly- L -lysine for 10 min, cell suspensions were subsequently incubated on the slides for 30 min (final concentration 2 × 10 5 cells/slide) and 3.7% paraformaldehyde was added for 30–60 min. Sections were washed in PBS/Triton X-100 0.1% (PBS-T), followed by a 1 h blocking step with 10% FCS in PBS-T. After overnight incubation with a GR antibody at 4°C, antibodies against LCK or FYN were added for 2–3 h. Slides were washed and incubated for 60 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate- and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Heverlee, Belgium) diluted in 3% BSA/PBS-T. Alternatively, sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with an HSP90 antibody. Sections were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) supplemented with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and sealed with coverslips. The protocol of the imaging technique can be found in the supplementary information online.
