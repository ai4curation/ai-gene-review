Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a retinal degenerative disease characterized by the 
progressive loss of photoreceptors. We have previously demonstrated that RP can 
be caused by recessive mutations in the human FAM161A gene, encoding a protein 
with unknown function that contains a conserved region shared only with a 
distant paralog, FAM161B. In this study, we show that FAM161A localizes at the 
base of the photoreceptor connecting cilium in human, mouse and rat. 
Furthermore, it is also present at the ciliary basal body in ciliated mammalian 
cells, both in native conditions and upon the expression of recombinant tagged 
proteins. Yeast two-hybrid analysis of binary interactions between FAM161A and 
an array of ciliary and ciliopathy-associated proteins reveals direct 
interaction with lebercilin, CEP290, OFD1 and SDCCAG8, all involved in 
hereditary retinal degeneration. These interactions are mediated by the 
C-terminal moiety of FAM161A, as demonstrated by pull-down experiments in 
cultured cell lines and in bovine retinal extracts. As other ciliary proteins, 
FAM161A can also interact with the microtubules and organize itself into 
microtubule-dependent intracellular networks. Moreover, small interfering 
RNA-mediated depletion of FAM161A transcripts in cultured cells causes the 
reduction in assembled primary cilia. Taken together, these data indicate that 
FAM161A-associated RP can be considered as a novel retinal ciliopathy and that 
its molecular pathogenesis may be related to other ciliopathies.
