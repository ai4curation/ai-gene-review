Protein interactions regulate the systems-level behavior of cells; thus, 
deciphering the structure and dynamics of protein interaction networks in their 
cellular context is a central goal in biology. We have performed a genome-wide 
in vivo screen for protein-protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by 
means of a protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA). We identified 2770 
interactions among 1124 endogenously expressed proteins. Comparison with 
previous studies confirmed known interactions, but most were not known, 
revealing a previously unexplored subspace of the yeast protein interactome. The 
PCA detected structural and topological relationships between proteins, 
providing an 8-nanometer-resolution map of dynamically interacting complexes in 
vivo and extended networks that provide insights into fundamental cellular 
processes, including cell polarization and autophagy, pathways that are 
evolutionarily conserved and central to both development and human health.
