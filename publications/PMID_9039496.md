The psbP gene encoding the precursor of 23-kDa polypeptide of the 
oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II has been isolated from Arabidopsis 
thaliana genomic library and sequenced. The gene harbors three introns and 
encodes a mature polypeptide of 186 amino acid residues and a transit peptide of 
77 amino acid residues. The deduced molecular mass of the mature polypeptide is 
23.5-kDa and it contains 22.6% charged amino acid residues which may contribute 
to the hydrophilic nature of the protein. The transcript encoded by psbP gene of 
Arabidopsis is approximately 1.3-kb long. In wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings, 
its expression is organ-specific and is regulated by endogenous developmental 
cues, light and sucrose. In a constitutively photomorphogenic mutant of 
Arabidopsis, designated as pho1, the psbP gene is partly derepressed in young, 
dark-grown seedlings, resulting in a slightly higher level of the transcript. 
Additionally, the pho1 mutant shows slow accumulation of psbP transcript upon 
illumination of young, dark-grown seedlings. However, the derepression is not 
markedly displayed on dark-adaptation of pho1 plants grown in continuous light. 
These studies, therefore, define the activity of at least one cellular effector 
involved in regulation of psbP expression.
