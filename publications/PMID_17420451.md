No more than approximately 30% of hereditary breast cancer has been accounted 
for by mutations in known genes. Most of these genes, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, 
TP53, CHEK2, ATM, and FANCJ/BRIP1, function in DNA repair, raising the 
possibility that germ line mutations in other genes that contribute to this 
process also predispose to breast cancer. Given its close relationship with 
BRCA2, PALB2 was sequenced in affected probands from 68 BRCA1/BRCA2-negative 
breast cancer families of Ashkenazi Jewish, French Canadian, or mixed ethnic 
descent. The average BRCAPRO score was 0.58. A truncating mutation (229delT) was 
identified in one family with a strong history of breast cancer (seven breast 
cancers in three female mutation carriers). This mutation and its associated 
breast cancers were characterized with another recently reported but unstudied 
mutation (2521delA) that is also associated with a strong family history of 
breast cancer. There was no loss of heterozygosity in tumors with either 
mutation. Moreover, comparative genomic hybridization analysis showed major 
similarities to that of BRCA2 tumors but with some notable differences, 
especially loss of 18q, a change that was previously unknown in BRCA2 tumors and 
less common in sporadic breast cancer. This study supports recent observations 
that PALB2 mutations are present, albeit not frequently, in breast cancer 
families. The apparently high penetrance noted in this study suggests that at 
least some PALB2 mutations are associated with a substantially increased risk 
for the disease.
