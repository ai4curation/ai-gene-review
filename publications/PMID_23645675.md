Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification that tags proteins for 
proteasomal degradation. In addition, there is a growing appreciation that 
ubiquitination can influence protein activity and localization. Ste7 is a 
prototype MAPKK in yeast that participates in both the pheromone signaling and 
nutrient deprivation/invasive growth pathways. We have shown previously that 
Ste7 is ubiquitinated upon pheromone stimulation. Here, we show that the 
Skp1/Cullin/F-box ubiquitin ligase SCF(Cdc4) and the ubiquitin protease Ubp3 
regulate Ste7 ubiquitination and signal specificity. Using purified components, 
we demonstrate that SCF(Cdc4) ubiquitinates Ste7 directly. Using gene deletion 
mutants, we show that SCF(Cdc4) and Ubp3 have opposing effects on Ste7 
ubiquitination. Although SCF(Cdc4) is necessary for proper activation of the 
pheromone MAPK Fus3, Ubp3 is needed to limit activation of the invasive growth 
MAPK Kss1. Finally, we show that Fus3 phosphorylates Ubp3 directly and that 
phosphorylation of Ubp3 is necessary to limit Kss1 activation. These results 
reveal a feedback loop wherein one MAPK limits the ubiquitination of an upstream 
MAPKK and thereby prevents spurious activation of a second competing MAPK.
