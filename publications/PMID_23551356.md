The enzyme l-asparaginase of Pyrococcus furiosus (PfA) functions as a dimer with 
each monomer consisting of distinct N- and C-terminal domains (NPfA and CPfA, 
respectively), connected by a linker. Here we present data to show that NPfA 
functions as a non-specific molecular chaperone. Independently expressed NPfA 
refolded spontaneously whereas CPfA formed insoluble aggregates. However, when 
mixed and refolded together, NPfA augmented CPfA to fold with ~90% recovery. 
NPfA also protected a variety of substrate proteins from thermal and 
refolding-mediated aggregation as monitored by a reduction in light scattering. 
The co-appearance of substrate protein with NPfA in antibody pull-down assays as 
well as in eluted gel filtration peaks indicated direct protein-protein 
interaction. These interactions were hydrophobic in nature as determined by 
8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid fluorescence. NPfA inhibited 
polyglutamine-mediated amyloid formation and also facilitated disintegration of 
preformed amyloid fibrils of amyloid-β (1-42) as determined by reverse-phase 
HPLC-based sedimentation assay and thioflavin T binding assays, respectively. 
Dynamic light scattering experiments suggested that NPfA readily assembled into 
polydispersed oligomeric species. With no sequence similarity to α-crystallin or 
any known molecular chaperone, we present here NPfA as a novel molecular 
chaperone.
