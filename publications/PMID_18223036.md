A subset of WD40 proteins that contain a DWD motif (for DDB1 binding WD40) is 
reported to act as substrate receptors for DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 (for Damaged DNA 
Binding 1-Cullin 4-Regulator of Cullins 1) based E3 ubiquitin ligases in humans. 
Here, we report 85 Arabidopsis thaliana and 78 rice (Oryza sativa) proteins 
containing the conserved 16-amino acid DWD motif. We show by yeast two-hybrid 
and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation that 11 Arabidopsis DWD proteins directly 
interact with DDB1 and thus may serve as substrate receptors for the DDB1-CUL4 
machinery. We further examine whether the DWD protein PRL1 (for Pleiotropic 
Regulatory Locus 1) may act as part of a CUL4-based E3 ligase. PRL1 directly 
interacts with DDB1, and prl1 and cul4cs mutants exhibited similar phenotypes, 
including altered responses to a variety of stimuli. Moreover, AKIN10 (for 
Arabidopsis SNF1 Kinase Homolog 10) was degraded more slowly in cell extracts of 
prl1 and cul4cs than in cell extracts of the wild type. Thus, both genetic and 
biochemical analyses support the conclusion that PRL1 is the substrate receptor 
of a CUL4-ROC1-DDB1-PRL1 E3 ligase involved in the degradation of AKIN10. This 
work adds a large new family to the current portfolio of plant E3 ubiquitin 
ligases.

Abstract

A subset of WD40 proteins that contain a DWD motif (for DDB1 binding WD40) is reported to act as substrate receptors for DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 (for Damaged DNA Binding 1–Cullin 4–Regulator of Cullins 1) based E3 ubiquitin ligases in humans. Here, we report 85 Arabidopsis thaliana and 78 rice ( Oryza sativa ) proteins containing the conserved 16–amino acid DWD motif. We show by yeast two-hybrid and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation that 11 Arabidopsis DWD proteins directly interact with DDB1 and thus may serve as substrate receptors for the DDB1–CUL4 machinery. We further examine whether the DWD protein PRL1 (for Pleiotropic Regulatory Locus 1) may act as part of a CUL4-based E3 ligase. PRL1 directly interacts with DDB1, and prl1 and cul4cs mutants exhibited similar phenotypes, including altered responses to a variety of stimuli. Moreover, AKIN10 (for Arabidopsis SNF1 Kinase Homolog 10) was degraded more slowly in cell extracts of prl1 and cul4cs than in cell extracts of the wild type. Thus, both genetic and biochemical analyses support the conclusion that PRL1 is the substrate receptor of a CUL4-ROC1-DDB1-PRL1 E3 ligase involved in the degradation of AKIN10. This work adds a large new family to the current portfolio of plant E3 ubiquitin ligases.

INTRODUCTION

Eukaryotes use the ubiquitin–proteasome system to control selective protein degradation. Since this regulates processes ranging from cell division to cell death, it is essential to understand how the specificity of protein degradation is determined ( Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998 ; Smalle and Vierstra, 2004 ).

Proteins are targeted for proteasomal degradation by ubiquitination via the successive activities of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3), which binds the substrate and thus determines the specificity of the entire pathway ( Hochstrasser, 1996 ; King et al., 1996 ). Accordingly, understanding selective protein degradation entails identifying and characterizing the substrate receptors.

Eukaryotic cells contain many different E3 ubiquitin ligases. The most abundant families are based on cullin scaffolding proteins that provide a framework for assembling the selective ubiquitination machinery ( Schwechheimer and Calderon, 2004 ; Petroski and Deshaies, 2005 ; Thomann et al., 2005 ). Members of the cullin family have two modules assembled on the cullin protein. One is a RING finger domain protein, ROC1 (also known as RBX1 and Hrt1), which binds a C-terminal domain in cullins and recruits the E2 enzyme; the other is a substrate-recognition complex. A remarkable aspect of cullin-RING E3 ligases is that each cullin can assemble into many distinct cullin RING–dependent ligases by interacting with various proteins ( Petroski and Deshaies, 2005 ). CUL1 uses an N-terminal domain to bind a linker protein, SKP1 (for S-phase Kinase-Associated Protein 1), which binds various F-box proteins that recruit specific substrates ( Feldman et al., 1997 ; Skowyra et al., 1997 ; Zheng et al., 2002 ). CUL2 and CUL5 use a heterodimeric linker complex containing elongins B and C to bind VHL box or SOCS box proteins that target various substrates differentially to the CUL2-ROC1 or CUL5-ROC2 catalytic cores using additional protein–protein interaction modules ( Kamura et al., 1998 , 2001 , 2004 ; Stebbins et al., 1999 ; Zhang et al., 1999 ). Without a linker, CUL3 uses its N-terminal domain to bind proteins with a conserved 100-residue BTB domain, which then target various substrates to the CUL3-ROC1 catalytic core via additional protein–protein interaction domains ( Furukawa et al., 2003 ; Geyer et al., 2003 ; Pintard et al., 2003 ; Xu et al., 2003 ). Cullins form the largest family of E3 ligase complexes in plants and control the ubiquitination of a wide variety of substrates; there are 694 potential F-box and 80 BTB genes in Arabidopsis thaliana , while the number of BTB genes has expanded to 149 in rice ( Oryza sativa ) ( Gagne et al., 2002 ; Gingerich et al., 2005 , 2007 ).

Identifying the substrate receptors of CUL4-based E3 ligases has been more challenging. CUL4 , originally identified in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Kipreos et al., 1996 ), is present as a single gene in C. elegans , Arabidopsis , Drosophila melanogaster , and Schizosaccharomyces pombe and has two closely related paralogs in mammals, CUL4A and CUL4B ( Kipreos et al., 1996 ). Deletion of CUL4 caused decondensation of chromosomes in fission yeast ( Osaka et al., 2000 ) and massive DNA replication in C. elegans embryos ( Zhong et al., 2003 ), while targeted disruption of the mouse CUL4A gene resulted in embryonic lethality ( Li et al., 2002 ). Similarly, two recent studies showed that lowering CUL4 expression in Arabidopsis resulted in many defects, including constitutive photomorphogenesis, altered light-regulated gene expression, reduced lateral root formation, and aberrant stomatal and vascular tissue development ( Bernhardt et al., 2006 ; Chen et al., 2006 ).

CUL4, like other cullin-based E3 ligases, binds ROC1/RBX1 to recruit the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. It has also been shown to bind adaptor proteins that link CUL4 to substrate receptors. DDB1 has been identified as one such adaptor, which can associate other proteins and substrate receptors. For example, DDB1 was shown to be an essential component for targeted ubiquitination of CDT1 (for Cdc10-dependent transcript 1), which is a licensing factor for DNA replication, by CUL4-ROC1 ( Hu et al., 2004 ). In plants, coimmunoprecipitation assays indicate it associates with CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC10 (COP10) and DE-ETIOLATED1 (DET1) to form the COP10-DET1-DDB1 (CDD) complex in Arabidopsis ( Yanagawa et al., 2004 ). In turn, genetic studies and in vitro reconstitution assays showed that the CDD complex binds CUL4-ROC1/RBX1 to form a complex that associates with COP1 to help repress photomorphogenesis ( Chen et al., 2006 ).

Recent studies in mammalian cells have identified many proteins containing WD40 repeats that associate with CUL4-DDB1 complexes ( Angers et al., 2006 ; He et al., 2006 ; Higa et al., 2006a ; Jin et al., 2006 ). Moreover, it has been shown for several of these proteins that a functional E3 ligase is formed when they bind the CUL4-ROC1/RBX1-DDB1 complex. For example, the proteolysis of CDT1 after DNA replication and in response to DNA damage is contingent on CDT2 binding to the CUL4-DDB1 complexes ( Banks et al., 2006 ; Higa et al., 2006b ; Jin et al., 2006 ; Ralph et al., 2006 ; Kim and Kipreos, 2007 ). Similarly, DDB2 must bind CUL4-DDB1 complexes for the ubiqutination of histone H2A at UV-damaged DNA sites, and mutations that prevent this binding cause a form of Xerodema pigmentosum ( Kapetanaki et al., 2006 ). These WD40 proteins are thus good candidates for the substrate receptors of CUL4-based E3 ligases.

Most WD40 proteins associated with CUL4-DDB1 in animals contain a conserved motif within the WD40 repeats required for this interaction. This motif, named the DWD box (also known as WDXR and DxR) consists of 16 amino acids. There are four highly conserved residues: Asp-7 (or Glu), Trp-13 (or Tyr), Asp-14 (or Glu), and Arg-16 (or Lys). Several other positions are also consistently occupied by residues with similar properties, including hydrophobic residues at positions 1, 2, 10, 12, and 15 and small residues at positions 3, 4, and 5 ( He et al., 2006 ). Arg-16 is essential, since several different proteins containing the DWD motif no longer bind DDB1 when Arg-16 is mutated to another residue. For example, DDB2 cannot bind DDB1 in a X. pigmentosum group E patient whose Arg-16 of DDB2 was mutated to His ( Shiyanov et al., 1999 ). Similarly, mutation studies of WDR (WD40-repeat protein) 23, which is also known as DCAF11 (DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 11), and H326 (DCAF8) have confirmed that Arg-16 in the DWD motif is necessary for binding DDB1 ( Angers et al., 2006 ). Models of the structures of two DWD proteins, Hs CDT2 and CSA (for Cockayne syndrome protein A), showed that Arg-16 of the DWD motif is exposed on the surface of the bottom face of the β propeller and is thus available for interacting with DDB1 ( Jin et al., 2006 ).

Proteins containing the conserved 16-residue DWD motif have been detected in many species, including human, mouse, Drosophila , C. elegans , S. pombe , S. cerevisiae , and Arabidopsis , suggesting that their role is highly conserved in eukaryotes ( He et al., 2006 ). Their potential importance in plants is shown by the fact that several Arabidopsis proteins known to regulate various stages of development contain DWD motifs, including COP1, TGF-β RECEPTOR INTERACTING PROTEIN (TRIP-1), VERNALIZATION INDEPENDENCE3 (VIP3), FY (the homolog of yeast polyadenylation factor, Pfs2p), and PLEIOTROPIC REGULATORY LOCUS1 (PRL1) ( Nemeth et al., 1998 ; Jiang and Clouse, 2001 ; Simpson et al., 2003 ; Zhang et al., 2003 ; Chen et al., 2006 ).

Here, we report the characterization of DWD proteins and their possible roles in CUL4-RING E3 ligases in Arabidopsis and rice. We also present evidence that the representative DWD protein PRL1 functions as the substrate receptor for the degradation of AKIN10 by a CUL4-DDB1–based E3 ligase in Arabidopsis .
