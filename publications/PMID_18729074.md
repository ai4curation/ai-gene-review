Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) is an important growth inhibitor 
of epithelial cells and insensitivity to this cytokine results in uncontrolled 
cell proliferation and can contribute to tumorigenesis. TGF-beta1 signals 
through the TGF-beta type I and type II receptors, and activates the Smad 
pathway via phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Since little is known about the 
selective activation of Smad2 versus Smad3, we set out to identify novel Smad2 
and Smad3 interacting proteins in epithelial cells. A non-transformed human cell 
line was transduced with Myc-His(6)-Smad2 or Myc-His(6)-Smad3-expressing 
retrovirus and was treated with TGF-beta1. Myc-His(6)-Smad2 or Myc-His(6)-Smad3 
was purified by tandem affinity purification, eluates were subject to SDS-PAGE 
and Colloidal Blue staining, and select protein bands were digested with 
trypsin. The resulting tryptic peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography 
(LC) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and the SEQUEST algorithm was employed 
to identify proteins in the bands. A number of proteins that are known to 
interact with Smad2 or Smad3 were detected in the eluates. In addition, a number 
of putative novel Smad2 and Smad3 associated proteins were identified that have 
functions in cell proliferation, apoptosis, actin cytoskeleton regulation, cell 
motility, transcription, and Ras or insulin signaling. Specifically, the 
interaction between Smad2/3 and the Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, 
Zizimin1, was validated by co-immunoprecipitation. The discovery of these novel 
Smad2 and/or Smad3 associated proteins may reveal how Smad2 and Smad3 are 
regulated and/or uncover new functions of Smad2 and Smad3 in TGF-beta1 
signaling.
