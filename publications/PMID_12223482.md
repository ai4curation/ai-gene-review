Previously we isolated human PEX16 encoding 336-amino acid-long peroxin Pex16p 
and showed that its dysfunction was responsible for Zellweger syndrome of 
complementation group D (group 9). Here we have determined the membrane topology 
of Pex16p by differential permeabilization method: both N- and C-terminal parts 
are exposed to the cytosol. In the search for Pex16p topogenic sequence, basic 
amino acids clustered sequence, RKELRKKLPVSLSQQK, at positions 66-81 and the 
first transmembrane segment locating far downstream, nearly by 40 amino acids, 
of this basic region were defined to be essential for integration into 
peroxisome membranes. Localization to peroxisomes of membrane proteins such as 
Pex14p, Pex13p, and PMP70 was interfered with in CHO-K1 cells by a higher level 
expression of the pex16 patient-derived dysfunctional but topogenically active 
Pex16pR176ter comprising resides 1-176 or of the C-terminal cytoplasmic part 
starting from residues at 244 to the C terminus. Furthermore, Pex16p C-terminal 
cytoplasmic part severely abrogated peroxisome restoration in pex mutants such 
as matrix protein import-defective pex12 and membrane assembly impaired pex3 by 
respective PEX12 and PEX3 expression, whereas the N-terminal cytosolic region 
did not affect restoration. These results imply that Pex16p functions in 
peroxisome membrane assembly, more likely upstream of Pex3p.
