SARS-CoV-2 infections have resulted in a very large number of severe cases of 
COVID-19 and deaths worldwide. However, knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
pathogenesis and therapy remains limited, emphasizing the urgent need for 
fundamental studies and drug development. Studies have shown that induction of 
macroautophagy/autophagy and hijacking of the autophagic machinery are essential 
for the infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2; however, the mechanism of this 
manipulation and the function of autophagy during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain 
unclear. In the present study, we identified ORF3a as an inducer of autophagy 
(in particular reticulophagy) and revealed that ORF3a localizes to the ER and 
induces RETREG1/FAM134B-related reticulophagy through the HMGB1-BECN1 (beclin 1) 
pathway. As a consequence, ORF3a induces ER stress and inflammatory responses 
through reticulophagy and then sensitizes cells to the acquisition of an ER 
stress-related early apoptotic phenotype and facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a hijacks reticulophagy and then disrupts ER 
homeostasis to induce ER stress and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 
infection. These findings reveal the sequential induction of reticulophagy, ER 
stress and acute inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and imply 
the therapeutic potential of reticulophagy and ER stress-related drugs for 
COVID-19.Abbreviations: CQ: chloroquine; DEGs: differentially expressed genes;
