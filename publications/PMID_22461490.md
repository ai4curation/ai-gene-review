To migrate efficiently through the interstitium, dendritic cells (DCs) 
constantly adapt their shape to the given structure of the extracellular matrix 
and follow the path of least resistance. It is known that this amoeboid 
migration of DCs requires Cdc42, yet the upstream regulators critical for 
localization and activation of Cdc42 remain to be determined. Mutations of 
DOCK8, a member of the atypical guanine nucleotide exchange factor family, 
causes combined immunodeficiency in humans. In the present study, we show that 
DOCK8 is a Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is critical 
for interstitial DC migration. By generating the knockout mice, we found that in 
the absence of DOCK8, DCs failed to accumulate in the lymph node parenchyma for 
T-cell priming. Although DOCK8-deficient DCs migrated normally on 2-dimensional 
surfaces, DOCK8 was required for DCs to crawl within 3-dimensional fibrillar 
networks and to transmigrate through the subcapsular sinus floor. This function 
of DOCK8 depended on the DHR-2 domain mediating Cdc42 activation. DOCK8 
deficiency did not affect global Cdc42 activity. However, Cdc42 activation at 
the leading edge membrane was impaired in DOCK8-deficient DCs, resulting in a 
severe defect in amoeboid polarization and migration. Therefore, DOCK8 regulates 
interstitial DC migration by controlling Cdc42 activity spatially.
