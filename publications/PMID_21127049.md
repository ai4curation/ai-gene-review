Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has long been suggested as a potent inducer 
of bone loss in vivo despite controversial effects on osteoclast precursors. 
Recently, the role of the deubiquitinating protease A20 in regulating the LPS 
response in various organs was reported. In the present study, we investigated 
whether A20 is expressed in osteoclast cultures in response to RANKL or LPS and 
whether this protein plays a role in osteoclast formation and activation. Human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured in the presence of M-CSF ± 
RANKL ± LPS. Although LPS induced the formation of multinucleated TRAP-positive 
cells expressing OSCAR, cathepsin K, and the calcitonin receptor, these cells 
were not capable of lacunar resorption. Release of TNF-α was noted in 
LPS-treated cultures, and the addition of a neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody 
abrogated osteoclast formation in these cultures. A20 appeared to be a 
late-expressed gene in LPS-treated cultures and was associated with TRAF6 
degradation and NF-κB inhibition. Silencing of A20 restored TRAF6 expression and 
NF-κB activation and resulted in increased bone resorption in LPS-treated 
cultures. A20 appeared important in the control of bone resorption and could 
represent a therapeutic target to treat patients with bone resorption associated 
with inflammatory diseases.
