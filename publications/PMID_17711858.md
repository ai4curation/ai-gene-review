We have identified and characterized a Microtubule Interacting and Transport 
(MIT) domain at the N terminus of the deubiquitinating enzyme UBPY/USP8. In 
common with other MIT-containing proteins such as AMSH and VPS4, UBPY can 
interact with CHMP proteins, which are known to regulate endosomal sorting of 
ubiquitinated receptors. Comparison of binding preferences for the 11 members of 
the human CHMP family between the UBPY MIT domain and another ubiquitin 
isopeptidase, AMSH, reveals common interactions with CHMP1A and CHMP1B but a 
distinct selectivity of AMSH for CHMP3/VPS24, a core subunit of the ESCRT-III 
complex, and UBPY for CHMP7. We also show that in common with AMSH, UBPY 
deubiquitinating enzyme activity can be stimulated by STAM but is unresponsive 
to its cognate CHMPs. The UBPY MIT domain is dispensable for its catalytic 
activity but is essential for its localization to endosomes. This is 
functionally significant as an MIT-deleted UBPY mutant is unable to rescue its 
binding partner STAM from proteasomal degradation or reverse a block to 
epidermal growth factor receptor degradation imposed by small interfering 
RNA-mediated depletion of UBPY.
