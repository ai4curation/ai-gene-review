Takeda-G-protein-receptor-5 (TGR5) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 
activated by bile acids, and mortalin is a multipotent chaperone of the HSP70 
family. In the present study, TGR5 was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 
extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) specimens, and TGR5 expression in ECC 
tissues and adjacent tissues was compared. In vitro TGR5 was overexpressed and 
knocked down in human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) cell line RBE and 
human extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) cell line QBC-939 to observe its 
effects on the biological behavior of cholangiocarcinoma (CC) cells, including 
proliferation, apoptosis and migration. In vivo xenograft model was constructed 
to explore the role of TGR5 in CC growth. Proteins that interacted with TGR5 
were screened using an immunoprecipitation spectrometry approach, and the 
identified protein was down-regulated to investigate its contribution to CC 
growth. The present study demonstrated that TGR5 is highly expressed in CC 
tissues, and strong TGR5 expression may indicate high malignancy in CC. 
Furthermore, TGR5 promotes CC cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis 
resistance. TGR5 boosts CC growth in vivo. In addition, TGR5 combines with 
mortalin and regulates mortalin expression in the CC cell line. Mortalin 
participates in the TGR5-induced increase in CC cell proliferation. In 
conclusion, TGR5 is of clinical significance based on its implications for the 
degree of malignancy in patients with CC. Mortalin may be a downstream component 
regulated by TGR5, and TGR5 promotes cholangiocarcinoma at least partially by 
interacting with mortalin and upregulating its expression. Both TGR5 and 
mortalin are positive regulators, and may serve as potential therapeutic targets 
for CC.
