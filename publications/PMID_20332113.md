Mutations in CCM3/PDCD10 result in cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), a 
major cause of cerebral hemorrhage. Despite intense interest in CCMs, very 
little is known about the function of CCM3. Here, we report that CCM3 is located 
on the Golgi apparatus, forming a complex with proteins of the germinal center 
kinase III (GCKIII) family and GM130, a Golgi-resident protein. Cells depleted 
of CCM3 show a disassembled Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, in wound-healing 
assays, CCM3-depleted cells cannot reorient the Golgi and centrosome properly, 
and demonstrate impaired migration. Golgi disassembly after either depletion of 
CCM3 or dissociation of CCM3 from the GM130-GCKIII complex is the result of 
destabilization of GCKIII proteins and dephosphorylation of their substrate, 
14-3-3zeta. Significantly, the phenotype induced by CCM3 depletion can be 
reverted by expression of wild-type CCM3, but not by disease-associated mutants. 
Our findings suggest that Golgi dysfunction and the ensuing abnormalities of 
cell orientation and migration resulting from CCM3 mutations contribute to CCM 
pathogenesis.
