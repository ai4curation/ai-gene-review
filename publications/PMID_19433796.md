ASC-2, a multifunctional coactivator, forms a steady-state complex, named ASCOM 
(for ASC-2 COMplex), that contains the histone H3-lysine-4 
(H3K4)-methyltransferase MLL3 or its paralogue MLL4. Somewhat surprisingly, 
given prior indications of redundancy between MLL3 and MLL4, targeted 
inactivation of the MLL3 H3K4-methylation activity in mice is found to result in 
ureter epithelial tumors. Interestingly, this phenotype is exacerbated in a 
p53(+/-) background and the tumorigenic cells are heavily immunostained for 
gammaH2AX, indicating a contribution of MLL3 to the DNA damage response pathway 
through p53. Consistent with the in vivo observations, and the demonstration of 
a direct interaction between p53 and ASCOM, cell-based assays have revealed that 
ASCOM, through ASC-2 and MLL3/4, acts as a p53 coactivator and is required for 
H3K4-trimethyation and expression of endogenous p53-target genes in response to 
the DNA damaging agent doxorubicin. In support of redundant functions for MLL3 
and MLL4 for some events, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of both MLL3 and MLL4 
is required to suppress doxorubicin-inducible expression of several p53-target 
genes. Importantly, this study identifies a specific H3K4 methytransferase 
complex, ASCOM, as a physiologically relevant coactivator for p53 and implicates 
ASCOM in the p53 tumor suppression pathway in vivo.

Abstract

ASC-2, a multifunctional coactivator, forms a steady-state complex, named ASCOM (for AS C-2 COM plex), that contains the histone H3-lysine-4 (H3K4)-methyltransferase MLL3 or its paralogue MLL4. Somewhat surprisingly, given prior indications of redundancy between MLL3 and MLL4, targeted inactivation of the MLL3 H3K4-methylation activity in mice is found to result in ureter epithelial tumors. Interestingly, this phenotype is exacerbated in a p53 +/− background and the tumorigenic cells are heavily immunostained for γH2AX, indicating a contribution of MLL3 to the DNA damage response pathway through p53. Consistent with the in vivo observations, and the demonstration of a direct interaction between p53 and ASCOM, cell-based assays have revealed that ASCOM, through ASC-2 and MLL3/4, acts as a p53 coactivator and is required for H3K4-trimethyation and expression of endogenous p53-target genes in response to the DNA damaging agent doxorubicin. In support of redundant functions for MLL3 and MLL4 for some events, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of both MLL3 and MLL4 is required to suppress doxorubicin-inducible expression of several p53-target genes. Importantly, this study identifies a specific H3K4 methytransferase complex, ASCOM, as a physiologically relevant coactivator for p53 and implicates ASCOM in the p53 tumor suppression pathway in vivo.

Discussion

ASC-2, a coactivator with potential links to cancer ( 16 – 18 ), resides in a steady-state complex, ASCOM, that contains the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL3 or its paralogue MLL4 ( 7 , 8 ). To establish potentially interrelated functions of ASC2 and MLL3/4, we have used a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays ( 8 , 19 , 30 ). Interestingly, our recent analysis of a homozygous mouse line that expresses an enzymatically inactivated mutant form of MLL3 demonstrated genetic interactions between ASC-2 and MLL3 ( 8 , 15 ). Therefore, and because these animals show only a partial embryonic lethality ( 8 ) as opposed to the early embryonic lethality of ASC-2 -null mice ( 1 ), they serve as an excellent model system to study the physiological function of ASCOM. Surprisingly, our current study has revealed that the MLL3 mutant mice spontaneously develop ureter epithelial tumors and, further, that ASCOM-MLL3 and ASCOM-MLL4 act as redundant but crucial p53 coactivators and are required for H3K4 trimethyation and expression of endogenous p53 target genes in response to the DNA damaging agent doxorubicin. This study provides documentation of a physiologically relevant H3K4 methyltransferase coactivator complex for p53. Importantly, our results also implicate ASCOM in the p53 tumor suppression pathway in vivo.

Multiple lines of evidence further support the tumor suppressor function for ASCOM. First, in an interesting study carried out in mouse models ( 31 ), haploid inactivation of ASC-2 was found to accelerate polyoma middle-T antigen-induced mammary tumorigenesis. Second, PTIP, which has been proposed to play important roles in cellular responses to DNA damage ( 32 , 33 ), recently was identified as an additional component of ASCOM ( 9 , 10 ). In this regard, it is important to note that the tumor suppressor p53 plays a key role in countering the adverse effects of DNA damage ( 23 ), which otherwise can be lethal or lead to oncogenic transformation, and that DNA damage induces the transcriptional activity of p53 via damage sensors such as ATM ( 23 ). It thus is interesting that PTIP appears to be required for ATM-mediated phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and for DNA damage-induced up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 ( 34 ). Correspondingly, loss-of-function studies in mice indicate that PTIP is essential for the maintenance of genomic stability ( 32 ). One intriguing future challenge is to test whether this function of PTIP occurs in the context of ASCOM, particularly because ASC-2 null cells show increased phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15. Regardless, and as our results suggest that ASCOM acts as a tumor suppressive coactivator complex for p53, ASCOM, like PTIP, may also play crucial roles in the maintenance of genomic stability. Indeed, ASC-2 and MLL3/4 appear to be important for DNA damage-induced expression of p53-target genes, and ureter epithelial tumors of the MLL3 mutant mice are accompanied by an increased level of DNA damage. Third, a number of recent reports also suggest a tumor suppressive role for MLL3. Thus, MLL3 was identified as a gene displaying somatic mutations in breast and colorectal cancers ( 35 ); and subsequent evaluations also identified somatic mutations of MLL3 in glioblastoma, melanoma, and pancreatic carcinoma ( 36 ). Notably, MLL3 is located on 7q36, a region for common chromosomal aberrations in myeloid leukemic patients ( 37 , 38 ).

Because a majority of tumors are associated with a loss of p53 function, and in view of the role of ASCOM as a p53 coactivator, the seeming propensity of MLL3 Δ/Δ mice to selectively develop urothelial tumors may appear paradoxical. However, a more careful examination may also uncover other types of tumors. In fact, ASCOM may guard against a broad range of epithelial tumors, as noted above, and, for instance, acceleration of polyoma middle-T antigen-induced mammary tumorigenesis by haploid inactivation of ASC-2 ( 31 ) may similarly involve genomic instability caused by the impaired ability of ASCOM to support p53 transactivation. Nonetheless, it also is possible that, along with a general redundancy between ASCOM-MLL3 and ASCOM-MLL4, there may be a more specific (and as yet unknown) function of MLL3 in the urothelium that selectively leads to urothelial tumors in MLL3 Δ/Δ mice. It should also be noted that the mutant form of MLL3 in MLL3 Δ/Δ mice lacks H3K4 methyltransferase activity but is incorporated into the ASCOM complex ( 8 ) and thus has the potential to act in a dominant negative fashion against functional MLL4-containing ASCOM complexes by competing for binding to p53 or other transcription factors. In such a case, if ASCOM-MLL3 were the only critical Set1-like coactivator complex for p53 in urothelial cells, genetic removal of p53 would not be expected to enhance the ureteral tumor phenotype of MLL3 Δ/Δ mice. Therefore, on the assumption that MLL3 Δ/Δ /ASCOM has a significant dominant negative effect, our results raise the possibility that p53 also uses other Set1-like complexes, most likely ASCOM-MLL4, at least in urothelial tumor suppressor function. With the newly established MLL4 mutant mice in the laboratory, along with mice with the floxed allele of ASC-2 ( 39 ), we are poised to clarify these issues in the future.

The notion of an ASCOM coactivator function for p53 is strongly supported by our demonstration of a direct interaction of ASCOM (containing ASC-2, MLL3/4, 53BP1, PTIP, and other ASCOM subunits) with p53. Interestingly, ASC-2 appears to play a crucial role in effecting MLL3/4 function on p53 target genes, because our results reveal that doxorubicin-induced ASCOM-MLL3 and ASCOM-MLL4 recruitment, corresponding H3K4 trimethylation, and activation of p53 target genes depends on ASC-2 ( Fig. 5 C ). However, the precise role of ASC-2 in p53 transactivation is not clear. Our search for the mechanistic basis underlying the association of ASCOM with p53 led to the surprising finding that 53BP1 is recruited to p21 -p53REs. Moreover, the timing of this recruitment precisely overlaps that of ASC-2 recruitment, suggesting corecruitment of these 2 proteins. These results support the previously proposed role for 53BP1 as a coactivator of p53 ( 26 , 27 ). Our proposal for an adaptor role for 53BP1 between p53 and ASCOM ( Fig. 5 C ) is further supported by our finding that 53BP1 and ASC-2 are readily coimmunopurified from cellular extracts and that 53BP1 appears to directly interact not only with p53 ( 25 ) but also with ASC-2. These results suggest that ASC-2 may play a critical role in linking the core MLL3/4 H3K4-methyltransferase unit to 53BP1, which in turn may facilitate ASCOM binding to p53 ( Fig. 5 C ). However, because a significant level of ASC-2/MLL3 is still recruited to p21 -p53REs in 53BP1 null cells, there are likely additional mechanisms for ASCOM recruitment. Thus, the detailed molecular basis underlying the recruitment of ASCOM to p53 remains to be further delineated.

Finally, mammals have additional, related H3K4 trimethyltransferase complexes. Interestingly, an MLL1 complex with common core subunits that are also present in the ASCOM MLL3 and MLL4 complexes was shown to exhibit modest p53 coactivator function in vitro ( 29 ). This may appear to be inconsistent not only with our in vivo ChIP results, which suggest that ASCOM is a critical player in H3K4 methylation at p21 -p53REs, but also with the doxorubicin sensitivity of ASC-2 and MLL3 mutant cells, which suggests that ASCOM is a major H3K4 methyltransferase complex for, at least, the p53-mediated DNA repair program. However, because the spectrum of p53 target genes is much more complex, we cannot exclude possible roles for other H3K4 methyltransferase complexes, perhaps even in conjunction with an MLL3/4 complex, on a select subset of p53-target genes. Similarly, ASCOM-MLL3 and ASCOM-MLL4, in addition to their shared p53-target genes, might also control a select sets of p53 target genes, respectively.

In summary, this study implicates ASC-2 and MLL3 in the p53 tumor suppression pathway, and identifies ASCOM as a major H3K4 methyltransferase coactivator complex for the tumor suppressor p53. Our results present this complex as a possible new therapeutic target for development of anticancer drugs. For instance, by delivering antagonists of MLL3/4 H3K4 methyltransferase activity to cancer cells with wild-type MLL3/4, it may be possible to make them more sensitive to irradiation therapy. In addition, by delivering agonists to normal or early tumorigenic cells with intact MLL3/4, it may be possible to help them resist tumorigenic insults such as DNA damaging agents.
