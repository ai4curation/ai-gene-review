The PEP7 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a 59-kD hydrophilic 
polypeptide that is required for transport of soluble vacuolar hydrolase 
precursors from the TGN to the endosome. This study presents the results of a 
high-copy suppression analysis of pep7-20 mutant phenotypes. This analysis 
demonstrated that both VPS45 and PEP12 are allele-specific high-copy suppressors 
of pep7-20 mutant phenotypes. Overexpression of VPS45 was able to completely 
suppress the Zn2+ sensitivity and partially suppress the carboxypeptidase Y 
deficiency. Overexpression of PEP12 was able to do the same, but to a lesser 
extent. Vps45p and Pep12p are Sec1p and syntaxin (t-SNARE) homologues, 
respectively, and are also thought to function in transport between the TGN and 
endosome. Two additional vacuole pathway SNARE complex homologues, Vps33p 
(Sec1p) and Pth1p (syntaxin), when overexpressed, were unable to suppress 
pep7-20 or any other pep7 allele, further supporting the specificity of the 
interactions of pep7-20 with PEP12 and VPS45. Because several other vesicle 
docking/fusion reactions take place in the cell without discernible 
participation of Pep7p homologues, we suggest that Pep7p is a step-specific 
regulator of docking and/or fusion of TGN-derived transport vesicles onto the 
endosome.
