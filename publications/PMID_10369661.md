Glutathione synthetase (GS) catalyses the production of glutathione from 
gamma-glutamylcysteine and glycine in an ATP-dependent manner. Malfunctioning of 
GS results in disorders including metabolic acidosis, 5-oxoprolinuria, 
neurological dysfunction, haemolytic anaemia and in some cases is probably 
lethal. Here we report the crystal structure of human GS (hGS) at 2.1 A 
resolution in complex with ADP, two magnesium ions, a sulfate ion and 
glutathione. The structure indicates that hGS belongs to the recently identified 
ATP-grasp superfamily, although it displays no detectable sequence identity with 
other family members including its bacterial counterpart, Escherichia coli GS. 
The difficulty in identifying hGS as a member of the family is due in part to a 
rare gene permutation which has resulted in a circular shift of the conserved 
secondary structure elements in hGS with respect to the other known ATP-grasp 
proteins. Nevertheless, it appears likely that the enzyme shares the same 
general catalytic mechanism as other ligases. The possibility of cyclic 
permutations provides an insight into the evolution of this family and will 
probably lead to the identification of new members. Mutations that lead to GS 
deficiency have been mapped onto the structure, providing a molecular basis for 
understanding their effects.
