Genes adjacent to telomeres are subject to transcriptional repression mediated 
by an integrated set of chromatin modifying and remodeling factors. The 
telomeres of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have served as a model for dissecting the 
function of diverse chromatin proteins in gene silencing, and their study has 
revealed overlapping roles for many chromatin proteins in either promoting or 
antagonizing gene repression. The H3K4 methyltransferase Set1, which is commonly 
linked to transcriptional activation, has been implicated in telomere silencing. 
Set5 is an H4 K5, K8, and K12 methyltransferase that functions with Set1 to 
promote repression at telomeres. Here, we analyzed the combined role for Set1 
and Set5 in gene expression control at native yeast telomeres. Our data reveal 
that Set1 and Set5 promote a Sir protein-independent mechanism of repression 
that may primarily rely on regulation of H4K5ac and H4K8ac at telomeric regions. 
Furthermore, cells lacking both Set1 and Set5 have highly correlated 
transcriptomes to mutants in telomere maintenance pathways and display defects 
in telomere stability, linking their roles in silencing to protection of 
telomeres. Our data therefore provide insight into and clarify potential 
mechanisms by which Set1 contributes to telomere silencing and shed light on the 
function of Set5 at telomeres.
