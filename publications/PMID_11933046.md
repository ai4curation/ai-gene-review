Molecular chaperones are well known for their role in facilitating the folding 
of nascent and newly synthesized proteins, but have other roles, including the 
assembly, translocation and renaturation of intracellular proteins. Axons are 
convenient tissues for the study of some of these other roles because they lack 
the capacity for significant protein synthesis. We examine the axonal transport 
of the cytosolic chaperonin containing T- complex polypeptide 1 (CCT) by 
labeling lumbar motor neurons with [35S]methionine and examining sciatic nerve 
proteins by 2-D gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. All CCT subunits 
identifiable with specific antibodies, namely CCTalpha, CCTbeta, CCTgamma and 
CCTepsilon/CCTtheta; (the latter two subunits colocalized in analyses of rat 
nerve samples), appeared to be labeled in "slow component b" of axonal transport 
along with the molecular chaperone Hsc73 and actin, a major folding substrate 
for CCT. Our results are consistent with molecular chaperones having a 
post-translational role in maintaining the native form of actin during its slow 
transport to the axon terminal and ensuring its correct assembly into 
microfilaments.
