Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) effect cellular responses by binding to FGF 
receptors (FGFRs). FGF bound to extracellular domains on the FGFR in the 
presence of heparin activates the cytoplasmic receptor tyrosine kinase through 
autophosphorylation. We have crystallized a complex between human FGF1 and a 
two-domain extracellular fragment of human FGFR2. The crystal structure, 
determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction analysis of the 
selenomethionyl protein, is a dimeric assemblage of 1:1 ligand:receptor 
complexes. FGF is bound at the junction between the two domains of one FGFR, and 
two such units are associated through receptor:receptor and secondary 
ligand:receptor interfaces. Sulfate ion positions appear to mark the course of 
heparin binding between FGF molecules through a basic region on receptor D2 
domains. This dimeric assemblage provides a structural mechanism for FGF signal 
transduction.
