The beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) is one of the rare proteins known 
to be phosphorylated within its ectodomain. We have shown previously that 
betaAPP can be phosphorylated within secretory vesicles and at the cell surface 
(Walter, J., Capell, A., Hung, A. Y. , Langen, H., Schnölzer, M., Thinakaran, 
G., Sisodia, S. S., Selkoe, D. J., and Haass, C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 
1896-1903). We have now specifically characterized the phosphorylation of cell 
surface-located betaAPP and identified two ectoprotein kinases that 
phosphorylate betaAPP at the outer face of the plasma membrane. By using 
selective protein kinase inhibitors and by investigating the usage of ATP and 
GTP as cosubstrates, we demonstrate that membrane-bound betaAPP as well as 
secreted forms of betaAPP can be phosphorylated by casein kinase (CK) 1- and 
CK2-like ectoprotein kinases. The ectodomain of betaAPP was also phosphorylated 
by purified CK1 and CK2 in vitro, but not by protein kinases A and C. 
Phosphorylation of betaAPP by ectoprotein kinases and by purified CK1 and CK2 
occurred within an acidic domain in the N-terminal half of the protein. Heparin 
strongly inhibited the phosphorylation of cell-surface betaAPP by ecto-CK1 and 
ecto-CK2, indicating a regulatory role of this extracellular matrix component in 
betaAPP phosphorylation.
