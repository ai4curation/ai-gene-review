CHD proteins are members of the chromo domain family, a class of proteins 
involved in transcription, DNA degradation and chromatin structure. In higher 
eukaryotes, there are two distinct subfamilies of CHD proteins: CHD1 and CHD3/4. 
Analyses carried out in vitro indicate that the CHD3/4 proteins may regulate 
transcription via alteration of chromatin structure. However, little is known 
about the role of CHD proteins in vivo, particularly the CHD1 subfamily. To 
understand better the cellular function of CHD proteins, we initiated a study on 
the Chd1p protein from budding yeast. Using genomic DNA arrays, we identified 
genes whose expression is affected by the absence of Chd1p. A synthetic-lethal 
screen uncovered genetic interactions between SWI/SNF genes and CHD1. 
Biochemical experiments using Chd1p purified from yeast showed that it 
reconfigures the structure of nucleosome core particles in a manner distinct 
from the SWI-SNF complex. Taken together, these results suggest that Chd1p 
functions as a nucleosome remodeling factor, and that Chd1p may share 
overlapping roles with the SWI-SNF complex to regulate transcription.
