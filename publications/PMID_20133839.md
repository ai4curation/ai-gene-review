The formation of extracellular amyloid plaques is a common patho-biochemical 
event underlying several debilitating human conditions, including Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Considerable evidence implies that AD damage arises primarily from 
small oligomeric amyloid forms of Abeta peptide, but the precise mechanism of 
pathogenicity remains to be established. Using a cell culture system that 
reproducibly leads to the formation of Alzheimer's Abeta amyloid plaques, we 
show here that the formation of a single amyloid plaque represents a 
template-dependent process that critically involves the presence of endocytosis- 
or phagocytosis-competent cells. Internalized Abeta peptide becomes sorted to 
multivesicular bodies where fibrils grow out, thus penetrating the vesicular 
membrane. Upon plaque formation, cells undergo cell death and intracellular 
amyloid structures become released into the extracellular space. These data 
imply a mechanism where the pathogenic activity of Abeta is attributed, at least 
in part, to intracellular aggregates.
