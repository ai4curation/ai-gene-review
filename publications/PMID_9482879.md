The yeast nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) is encoded by two genes, 
EGD1 and EGD2, and is associated with cytoplasmic ribosomes. Yeast mutants 
lacking NAC (Deltaegd2) are viable but suffer slight defects in the targeting of 
nascent polypeptides to several locations including the endoplasmic reticulum 
and mitochondria. If both NAC and Mft52p are missing from yeast cells, 
inefficient targeting of mitochondrial precursor proteins leads to defects in 
both mitochondrial function and morphology. We suggest that NAC provides a 
ribosomal environment for nascent mitochondrial targeting sequences to achieve 
secondary structure, thereby enhancing the efficiency of protein targeting.
