The multidomain shank/ProSAP/SSTRIP proteins are major scaffold proteins in 
glutamatergic synapses in the mammalian brain; expression of shank1/SSTRIP in 
hippocampal neurons induces morphological changes in dendritic spines, 
suggesting that shank1 is involved in synapse formation and activity-dependent 
changes of synaptic structure. Using part of the proline-rich region of shank1 
in a yeast two hybrid screen, we identified the insulin receptor substrate 
IRSp53 as an interaction partner. Overlay assays verified a strong interaction 
between a proline-rich sequence (residues 911-940) in shank1 and the SH3 domain 
of IRSp53. When coexpressed in HEK cells, shank1 colocalizes with IRSp53 in 
intracellular structures, preventing targeting of IRSp53 to filopodia which are 
induced by IRSp53 expression in the absence of shank1. IRSp53 also binds to the 
activated form of the small G-protein cdc42. Interestingly, IRSp53 
coprecipitates with shank1 from transfected HEK cells in a small 
G-protein-regulated manner. Thus, IRSp53 constitutes a cdc42-regulated ligand 
for shank1 which may provide a molecular basis for small G-protein mediated 
effects on the structure of the postsynaptic complex.
