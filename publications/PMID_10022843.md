The cellular protein p32 was isolated originally as a protein tightly associated 
with the essential splicing factor ASF/SF2 during its purification from HeLa 
cells. ASF/SF2 is a member of the SR family of splicing factors, which stimulate 
constitutive splicing and regulate alternative RNA splicing in a positive or 
negative fashion, depending on where on the pre-mRNA they bind. Here we present 
evidence that p32 interacts with ASF/SF2 and SRp30c, another member of the SR 
protein family. We further show that p32 inhibits ASF/SF2 function as both a 
splicing enhancer and splicing repressor protein by preventing stable ASF/SF2 
interaction with RNA, but p32 does not block SRp30c function. ASF/SF2 is highly 
phosphorylated in vivo, a modification required for stable RNA binding and 
protein-protein interaction during spliceosome formation, and this 
phosphorylation, either through HeLa nuclear extracts or through specific SR 
protein kinases, is inhibited by p32. Our results suggest that p32 functions as 
an ASF/SF2 inhibitory factor, regulating ASF/SF2 RNA binding and 
phosphorylation. These findings place p32 into a new group of proteins that 
control RNA splicing by sequestering an essential RNA splicing factor into an 
inhibitory complex.
