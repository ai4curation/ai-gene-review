We have cloned four cyclin-B homologs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CLB1-CLB4, 
using the polymerase chain reaction and low stringency hybridization approaches. 
These genes form two classes based on sequence relatedness: CLB1 and CLB2 show 
highest homology to the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cyclin-B homolog cdc13 
involved in the initiation of mitosis, whereas CLB3 and CLB4 are more highly 
related to the S. pombe cyclin-B homolog cig1, which appears to play a role in 
G1 or S phase. CLB1 and CLB2 mRNA levels peak late in the cell cycle, whereas 
CLB3 and CLB4 are expressed earlier in the cell cycle but peak later than the 
G1-specific cyclin, CLN1. Analysis of null mutations suggested that the CLB 
genes exhibit some degree of redundancy, but clb1,2 and clb2,3 cells were 
inviable. Using clb1,2,3,4 cells rescued by conditional overproduction of CLB1, 
we showed that the CLB genes perform an essential role at the G2/M-phase 
transition, and also a role in S phase. CLB genes also appear to share a role in 
the assembly and maintenance of the mitotic spindle. Taken together, these 
analyses suggest that CLB1 and CLB2 are crucial for mitotic induction, whereas 
CLB3 and CLB4 might participate additionally in DNA replication and spindle 
assembly.
