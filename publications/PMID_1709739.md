In an attempt to isolate candidate genes for autosomal dominant polycystic 
kidney disease, a number of CpG-rich islands have been identified from a region 
defined genetically as the site of disease mutations. Genomic fragments adjacent 
to one of these islands were used to isolate cDNAs from both HeLa cells and 
cultured cystic epithelium that encode a 155-amino acid peptide having four 
putative transmembrane domains. The corresponding transcript was found in all 
tissues tested but was most abundant in brain and kidney. Potential control 
response elements were identified in the genomic region 5' to the initiation 
codon. The deduced amino acid sequence has 93% similarity to the 16-kDa 
proteolipid component that is believed to be part of the proton channel of the 
vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. Possible roles for a mutated proton channel in the 
pathogenesis of cystic disease were considered. However, sequencing of cDNAs 
corresponding to both alleles of an affected individual revealed no differences 
in the deduced amino acid sequence. Moreover, transcript size and abundance were 
not altered in cystic kidney.
