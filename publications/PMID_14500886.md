In this study, the human multienzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase "core" complex 
has been isolated from the nuclear and cytosolic compartments of human cells and 
purified to near homogeneity. It is clear from the polypeptide compositions, 
stoichiometries, and three-dimensional structures that the cytosolic and nuclear 
particles are very similar to each other and to the particle obtained from 
rabbit reticulocytes. The most significant difference observed via 
aminoacylation activity assays and densitometric analysis of electrophoretic 
band patterns is a lower amount of glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase in the human 
particles. However, this is not enough to cause major changes in the 
three-dimensional structures calculated from samples negatively stained with 
either uranyl acetate or methylamine vanadate. Indeed, the latter samples 
produce volumes that are highly similar to an initial structure previously 
calculated from a frozen hydrated sample of the rabbit multisynthetase complex. 
New structures in this study reveal that the three major structural domains have 
discrete subsections. This information is an important step toward determination 
of specific protein interactions and arrangements within the multisynthetase 
core complex and understanding of the particle's cellular function(s). Finally, 
gel filtration and immunoblot analysis demonstrate that a major biological role 
for the cytokine precursor p43 is as an integral part of the multisynthetase 
complex.
