Muscle cells respond to mechanical stretch stimuli by triggering downstream 
signals for myocyte growth and survival. The molecular components of the muscle 
stretch sensor are unknown, and their role in muscle disease is unclear. Here, 
we present biophysical/biochemical studies in muscle LIM protein (MLP) deficient 
cardiac muscle that support a selective role for this Z disc protein in 
mechanical stretch sensing. MLP interacts with and colocalizes with telethonin 
(T-cap), a titin interacting protein. Further, a human MLP mutation (W4R) 
associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) results in a marked defect in T-cap 
interaction/localization. We propose that a Z disc MLP/T-cap complex is a key 
component of the in vivo cardiomyocyte stretch sensor machinery, and that 
defects in the complex can lead to human DCM and associated heart failure.
