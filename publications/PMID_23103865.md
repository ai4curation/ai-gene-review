Human chromosome ends are capped by shelterin, a protein complex that protects 
the natural ends from being recognized as sites of DNA damage and also regulates 
the telomere-replicating enzyme, telomerase. Shelterin includes the 
heterodimeric POT1-TPP1 protein, which binds the telomeric single-stranded DNA 
tail. TPP1 has been implicated both in recruiting telomerase to telomeres and in 
stimulating telomerase processivity (the addition of multiple DNA repeats after 
a single primer-binding event). Determining the mechanisms of these activities 
has been difficult, especially because genetic perturbations also tend to affect 
the essential chromosome end-protection function of TPP1 (refs 15-17). Here we 
identify separation-of-function mutants of human TPP1 that retain full 
telomere-capping function in vitro and in vivo, yet are defective in binding 
human telomerase. The seven separation-of-function mutations map to a patch of 
amino acids on the surface of TPP1, the TEL patch, that both recruits telomerase 
to telomeres and promotes high-processivity DNA synthesis, indicating that these 
two activities are manifestations of the same molecular interaction. Given that 
the interaction between telomerase and TPP1 is required for telomerase function 
in vivo, the TEL patch of TPP1 provides a new target for anticancer drug 
development.
