We previously reported that human chromosome 1q21 or 1q23-q24 carries a 
transformation suppressor gene(s) for Kirsten sarcoma virus-transformed NIH3T3 
cells. In this study, we have isolated a novel human cDNA on 1q21 (designated as 
YL-1) as a candidate, then cloned its mouse homolog. Human and mouse YL-1 cDNA 
shared 96% in amino acid homology and presumably encoded a transcription 
factor-like polypeptide. An analysis using a specific antibody revealed the 
nuclear localization of YL-1 protein. The bacterially expressed YL-1 could bind 
to DNA. Thus, YL-1 protein possibly functions as a transcriptional regulator.
