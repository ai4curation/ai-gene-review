Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is activated by the 
IL-6 family of cytokines and growth factors. STAT3 requires phosphorylation on 
Ser-727, in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation on Tyr-705, to be 
transcriptionally active. In IL-6 signaling, the two major pathways that derive 
from the YXXQ and the YSTV motifs of gp130 cause Ser-727 phosphorylation. Here, 
we show that TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) interacts with STAT3, that the 
TAK1-Nemo-like kinase (NLK) pathway is efficiently activated by IL-6 through the 
YXXQ motif, and that this is the YXXQ-mediated H7-sensitive pathway that leads 
to STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation. Because NLK was recently shown to interact 
with STAT3, we explored the role of STAT3 in activating this pathway. Depletion 
of STAT3 diminished the IL-6-induced NLK activation by >80% without inhibiting 
IL-6-induced TAK1 activation or its nuclear entry. We found that STAT3 
functioned as a scaffold for TAK1 and NLK in vivo through a region in its 
carboxyl terminus. Furthermore, the expression of the STAT3(534-770) region in 
the nuclei of STAT3-knockdown cells enhanced the IL-6-induced NLK activation in 
a dose-dependent manner but not the TGFbeta-induced NLK activation. TGFbeta did 
not cause STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation, even when the carboxyl region of STAT3 
was expressed in the nuclei. Together, these results indicate that STAT3 
enhances the efficiency of its own Ser-727 phosphorylation by acting as a 
scaffold for the TAK1-NLK kinases, specifically in the YXXQ motif-derived 
pathway.
