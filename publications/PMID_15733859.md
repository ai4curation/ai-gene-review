Bcl-2 contains an unusually long loop between the first and the second helices. 
This loop has been shown to be highly flexible based on NMR and X-ray 
crystallographic analyses of this region. Bcl-2 is regulated at the 
posttranslational level through phosphorylation of specific residues within the 
flexible loop. The biological role and posttranslational modifications of the 
loop of Bcl-2 is currently unclear. FK-506 binding protein 38 (FKBP38) has been 
reported to interact with Bcl-2, suggesting that FKBP38 could act as a docking 
molecule to localize Bcl-2 at the mitochondrial membrane [Shirane, M. and 
Nakayama, K.I. (2003) Inherent calcineurin inhibitor FKBP38 targets Bcl-2 to 
mitochondria and inhibits apoptosis. Nat. Cell Biol. 5, 28-37]. Here, we 
investigated the molecular interaction between FKBP38 and Bcl-2, and 
demonstrated that Bcl-2 interacts with FKBP38 through the unstructured loop, and 
the interaction appears to regulate phosphorylation in the loop of Bcl-2.
