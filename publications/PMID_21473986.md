Defects in cilia formation and function result in a range of human skeletal and 
visceral abnormalities. Mutations in several genes have been identified to cause 
a proportion of these disorders, some of which display genetic (locus) 
heterogeneity. Mouse models are valuable for dissecting the function of these 
genes, as well as for more detailed analysis of the underlying developmental 
defects. The short-rib polydactyly (SRP) group of disorders are among the most 
severe human phenotypes caused by cilia dysfunction. We mapped the disease locus 
from two siblings affected by a severe form of SRP to 2p24, where we identified 
an in-frame homozygous deletion of exon 5 in WDR35. We subsequently found 
compound heterozygous missense and nonsense mutations in WDR35 in an independent 
second case with a similar, severe SRP phenotype. In a mouse mutation screen for 
developmental phenotypes, we identified a mutation in Wdr35 as the cause of 
midgestation lethality, with abnormalities characteristic of defects in the 
Hedgehog signaling pathway. We show that endogenous WDR35 localizes to cilia and 
centrosomes throughout the developing embryo and that human and mouse 
fibroblasts lacking the protein fail to produce cilia. Through structural 
modeling, we show that WDR35 has strong homology to the COPI coatamers involved 
in vesicular trafficking and that human SRP mutations affect key structural 
elements in WDR35. Our report expands, and sheds new light on, the pathogenesis 
of the SRP spectrum of ciliopathies.
