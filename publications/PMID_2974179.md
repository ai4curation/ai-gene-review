Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is an intracellular second messenger that activates 
transcription of many cellular genes. A palindromic consensus DNA sequence, 
TGACGTCA, functions as a cAMP-responsive transcriptional enhancer (CRE). The CRE 
binds a cellular protein of 38 kD in placental JEG-3 cells. A placental lambda 
gt11 library was screened for expression of specific CRE-binding proteins with 
the CRE sequence as a radioactive probe. A cDNA encoding a protein of 326 amino 
acids with the binding properties of a specific CRE-binding protein (CREB) was 
isolated. The protein contains a COOH-terminal basic region adjacent to a 
sequence similar to the "leucine zipper" sequence believed to be involved in DNA 
binding and in protein-protein contacts in several other DNA-associated 
transcriptional proteins including the products of the c-myc, c-fos, and c-jun 
oncogenes and GCN4. The CREB protein also contains an NH2-terminal acidic region 
proposed to be a potential transcriptional activation domain. The putative 
DNA-binding domain of CREB is structurally similar to the corresponding domains 
in the phorbol ester-responsive c-jun protein and the yeast transcription factor 
GCN4.
