The identification of SPG7 as the gene defective in a recessive form of spastic 
paraplegia has drawn attention to the yeast protein family of ATP-dependent zinc 
metalloproteases. The protein encoded by SPG7, paraplegin, shows high homology 
to members of this protein family. Recently, many mammalian ATP-dependent zinc 
metalloproteases have been identified and considered as possible candidates for 
defects in other forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia and possibly other 
neurodegenerative disorders. So far only a partial sequence has been available 
for one of those genes, ATPase family gene-3, yeast-like-1 (AFG3L1). We have 
carried out detailed molecular analysis of this gene and identified and 
characterized its mouse orthologue, Afg3l1. Our data indicate that AFG3L1 is 
transcribed into four mRNA isoforms that are not translated in humans. Afg3l1 
encodes a protein with high homology to paraplegin and the other members of the 
ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease family. Like the other ATP-dependent zinc 
metalloproteases, Afg3l1 localizes to the mitochondria.
