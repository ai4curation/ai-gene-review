Metalloprotease disintegrins (a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) and 
metalloprotease, disintegrin, cysteine-rich proteins (MDC)) are a family of 
membrane-anchored glycoproteins that function in diverse biological processes, 
including fertilization, neurogenesis, myogenesis, and ectodomain processing of 
cytokines and other proteins. The cytoplasmic domains of ADAMs often include 
putative signaling motifs, such as proline-rich SH3 ligand domains, suggesting 
that interactions with cytoplasmic proteins may affect metalloprotease 
disintegrin function. Here we report that two SH3 domain-containing proteins, 
endophilin I (SH3GL2, SH3p4) and a novel SH3 domain- and phox homology (PX) 
domain-containing protein, termed SH3PX1, can interact with the cytoplasmic 
domains of the metalloprotease disintegrins MDC9 and MDC15. These interactions 
were initially identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen and then confirmed using 
bacterial fusion proteins and co-immunoprecipitations from eukaryotic cells 
expressing both binding partners. SH3PX1 and endophilin I both preferentially 
bind the precursor but not the processed form of MDC9 and MDC15 in COS-7 cells. 
Since rat endophilin I is thought to play a role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis 
and SH3PX1 has sequence similarity to sorting nexins in yeast, we propose that 
endophilin I and SH3PX1 may have a role in regulating the function of MDC9 and 
MDC15 by influencing their intracellular processing, transport, or final 
subcellular localization.
