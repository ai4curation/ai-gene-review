TorsinA is a member of the AAA+ ATPase family of proteins and, notably, is the 
only known ATPase localized to the ER lumen. It has been suggested to act as a 
molecular chaperone, while a mutant form associated with early-onset torsion 
dystonia, a dominantly inherited movement disorder, appears to result in a net 
loss of function in vivo. Thus far, no studies have examined the chaperone 
activity of torsinA in vitro. Here we expressed and purified both wild-type (WT) 
and mutant torsinA fusion proteins in bacteria and examined their ability to 
function as molecular chaperones by monitoring suppression of luciferase and 
citrate synthase (CS) aggregation. We also assessed their ability to hold 
proteins in an intermediate state for refolding. As measured by light scattering 
and SDS-PAGE, both WT and mutant torsinA effectively, and similarly, suppressed 
protein aggregation compared to controls. This function was not further enhanced 
by the presence of ATP. Further, we found that while neither form of torsinA 
could protect CS from heat-induced inactivation, they were both able to 
reactivate luciferase when ATP and rabbit reticulocyte lysate were added. This 
suggests that torsinA holds luciferase in an intermediate state, which can then 
be refolded in the presence of other chaperones. These data provide conclusive 
evidence that torsinA acts as a molecular chaperone in vitro and suggests that 
early-onset torsion dystonia is likely not a consequence of a loss in torsinA 
chaperone activity but might be an outcome of insufficient torsinA localization 
at the ER to manage protein folding or trafficking.

Introduction

Early-onset torsion dystonia (or DYT1 dystonia) is a severe and heritable neurological disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions and abnormal postures, typically beginning during a developmental window at an early age (Faun et al. 1998 ). Although there is no evidence of neurodegeneration (Rostasy et al. 2003 ), the disease may result from more subtle changes in neuronal function such as altered dopaminergic or cholinergic transmission, as has been observed in DYT1 mouse models (Dang et al. 2005 ; Shashidharan et al. 2005 ; Balcioglu et al. 2007 ; Zhao et al. 2008 ; Martella et al. 2009 ). The causative genetic mutation appearing in most cases of this disease is a loss of one of two adjacent glutamic acid residues (ΔE 302/303) resulting from deletion in the DYT1 gene encoding human torsinA. Heterozygous carriers with one WT copy and one mutant copy of torsinA (∆E) display the disorder in a dominant manner with only 30–40% penetrance (Risch et al. 1990 ; Bressman et al. 1994 ; Ozelius et al. 1997 ; Klein et al. 1999 ). Studies have shown the expression of torsinA to be ubiquitous and present in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues (Augood et al. 1999 ; Ozelius et al. 1997 ; Rostasy et al. 2003 ). Importantly, investigations in Dyt1 mouse models have demonstrated that regulation of torsinA expression is critical as high levels of both WT torsinA and torsinA (∆E) result in comparable phenotypic defects (Grundmann et al. 2007 ). Furthermore, mice containing knockouts of torsinA do not survive long after birth (Dauer and Goodchild 2004 ).

TorsinA is a member of the AAA+ (ATPases associated with cellular activities) family of proteins (Ozelius et al. 1997 ). Many members of this family form hexameric oligomers and perform diverse cellular functions through chaperone-like activity with implications in membrane fusion, complex assembly and disassembly, and protein processing and folding (White and Lauring 2007 ). TorsinA appears to be no exception, with evidence demonstrating its involvement in protein processing in the secretory pathway, synaptic vesicle recycling, assembly/disassembly of the cytoskeletal network in the nuclear envelope, reduction of toxic misfolded protein aggregates, and serving in a neuroprotective capacity against α-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration (McLean et al. 2002 ; Cao et al. 2005 ; Hewett et al. 2007 ; Hamamichi et al. 2008 ; Granata et al. 2008 ; Nery et al. 2008 ). Interestingly, torsinA is the only AAA+ family member residing primarily in the ER lumen (Kustedjo et al. 2000 ; Hewett et al. 2003 ). An N-terminal hydrophobic domain is thought to anchor torsinA to the ER membrane; however, biochemical evidence suggests that torsinA remains peripherally associated (Callan et al. 2007 ; Liu et al. 2003 ). Considering that interaction partners of torsinA have been shown at the nuclear envelope (NE) (Goodchild and Dauer 2005 ; Nery et al. 2008 ), this peripheral association with the ER membrane suggests that torsinA may be involved in protein trafficking between the ER and NE. Indeed, a recent study has shown that LULL1, a known interacting partner of torsinA, directs it to the NE to displace certain LINC complex proteins, altering the structure of the NE (Heyden et al. 2009 ).

Current evidence suggests that mutant torsinA (ΔE) appears to result in a net cellular loss of torsinA function, as its presence may interfere with WT torsinA localization (Shashidharan et al. 2004 ; Torres et al. 2004 ). Firstly, evidence in both mice and cell cultures has shown torsinA (ΔE) to relocalize predominantly to the NE, similar to that of an ATP hydrolysis mutant E171Q in torsinA, which can bind, but not hydrolyze, ATP (Goodchild and Dauer 2004 ; Naismith et al. 2004 ). This suggests torsinA (ΔE) might act like an ATP hydrolysis mutant transferred to the NE by a permanently ATP bound substrate. Secondly, studies with human cell culture have shown that torsinA (ΔE) does not reduce misfolded protein aggregates as WT torsinA does (McLean et al. 2002 ). Finally, recent work has shown that the torsinA (ΔE) mutation results in a significantly reduced half-life compared to WT torsinA, indicating a high turnover rate (Giles et al. 2008 ; Gordon and Gonzalez-Alegre 2008 ). While these data suggest that expression of torsinA (ΔE) alone exerts reduced activity, the presence of both forms together, as in DYT1 patients, tells a different story. Importantly, studies have shown that cultured DYT1 patient fibroblasts display a significant reduction in secretory pathway efficiency compared to normal human cells (Hewett et al. 2008 ). However, knockdown of torsinA (ΔE) in these fibroblasts resulted in an increase in the secretory pathway efficiency, suggesting that torsinA (ΔE) is partially inhibiting the endogenous function of the WT form. Thus, it is speculated that the disease state may result from a loss of torsinA function due to association with the mutant form. Considering the implications for torsinA in the secretory pathway, a reduction in the activity of this suspected molecular chaperone may have substantial consequences on the proper processing of proteins and homeostasis in the ER, mechanisms that have significant consequences on neuronal transmission (Verkhratsky 2005 ).

Some, but not all members of the AAA+ family, display chaperone function through either ATP-dependent or ATP-independent mechanisms, thus supporting their role as classical molecular chaperones (Zolkiewski 1999 ; Zhou et al. 2001 ; Song et al. 2007 ). The ATP-independent chaperone activities include the ability to recognize misfolded proteins, as well as hold them in an intermediate state for refolding (Ben-Zvi and Goloubinoff 2001 ). While much cellular evidence suggests that torsinA may function as a molecular chaperone, studies to date on torsinA have been limited to indirect observations of co-localization and reduction of misfolded aggregates in vivo or in cell cultures only; they have not assessed whether torsinA has the ability to recognize misfolded proteins itself or if it participates in a complex to exhibit this chaperone-like activity. Here, for the first time, we report direct biochemical evidence of the chaperone function of torsinA in vitro using established and well characterized assays for chaperone activity involving luciferase and citrate synthase (Jakob et al. 1995 ; Herbst et al. 1997 ; Morrow et al. 2006 ). We assessed not only the capacity of both torsinA and mutant torsinA (ΔE) to function as chaperones in the recognition of non-native misfolded proteins but also their ability to hold them in an intermediate state for proper refolding.

Discussion

The large and diverse AAA+ family of proteins to which torsinA belongs contains a variety of proteins that function with chaperone-like activity (White and Lauring 2007 ). However, not all members of this family have been demonstrated to behave as classical molecular chaperones in recognizing misfolded proteins and holding them in an intermediate state for refolding. For example, the AAA+ protein, valosin/p97, can recognize and suppress aggregation of non-native misfolded proteins, while another, NSF, lacks this capability (Zhou et al. 2001 ; Song et al. 2007 ). While the precise cellular function of torsinA remains to be elucidated, it has been speculated that this essential protein can function as a molecular chaperone based on cellular assays (McLean et al. 2002 ; Caldwell et al. 2003 ).

We have shown that torsinA does indeed possess the ability to recognize non-native misfolded proteins and bind them directly using two different substrates. The data presented from the aggregation assays involving luciferase and CS demonstrate that torsinA prevents aggregation considerably and with general specificity for misfolded proteins, thus fulfilling one of the basic criteria of a classical molecular chaperone (Ben-Zvi and Goloubinoff 2001 ). The comparative activity of torsinA in suppressing aggregation is similar to that observed for hsp90, as well as some small heat shock proteins, further demonstrating its effectiveness as a molecular chaperone (Jakob et al. 1993 ; Ehrnsperger et al. 1997 ; Buchner et al. 1998 ). Strikingly, we found that the DYT1 dystonia-associated form of this protein, torsinA (ΔE), also exhibited chaperone activity equal to that of the WT form. Since both WT and torsinA (ΔE) are fully capable of acting as molecular chaperones, this suggests the cellular dysfunction associated with dystonia may be more related to mislocalization of the protein to the NE and/or absence of sufficient torsinA function at the ER.

Although torsinA is a member of the AAA+ family, we did not detect any ATPase activity of the torsinA constructs or influence of chaperone function by the presence of ATP. This is not surprising though, for a number of reasons. Firstly, studies of the torsinA worm homolog ooc-5 , revealed no detectable ATPase activity when compared to its ATP hydrolysis mutant (Zhu et al. 2008 ). Secondly, as Zhu and others have pointed out, previous studies that have investigated the ATPase activity of WT torsinA and torsinA (∆E) have been contradictory and did not have an ATP hydrolysis mutant as a negative control. These studies have also shown much lower rates of activity than that of other AAA+ proteins as well as conflicting results between the ATPase activity of WT torsinA and torsinA (∆E) (Kustedjo et al. 2000 ; Konakova and Pulst 2005 ; Pham et al. 2006 ).

Finally, studies have shown that the torsinA family lacks critical residues needed for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Zhu et al. 2008 ; Nagy et al. 2008 ). An elegant study by Nagy and others found that while most AAA+ family members such as ClpB contain a threonine or serine directly flanking the critical lysine residue in the Walker A binding motif, the torsinA family contains an asparagine residue instead. Their data showed that in ClpB, replacing the threonine with asparagine compromised its ATPase activity as well as its ATP-dependent chaperone function. Thus, the threonine residue may be involved in nucleotide binding (Nagy et al. 2008 ). Further, DnaC also contains an asparagine residue in the same position as torsinA in its Walker A motif and, in addition, lacks ATPase activity without the presence of other factors such as ssDNA or DnaB (Davy et al. 2002 ; Nagy et al. 2008 ). Finally, many AAA+ members contain a highly conserved arginine finger located near the sensor II motif, which is needed for ATP hydrolysis (Ogura et al. 2003 ). As others have found, the torsinA family also lacks this critical residue. It remains possible, however, that torsinA may require some unknown cofactor to activate its ATPase activity, as previously suggested (Zhu et al. 2008 ; Giles et al. 2009 ). This in turn could influence its chaperone abilities, although further studies will be needed to test this hypothesis.

Since both torsinA forms were capable of suppressing aggregation, we were curious to know whether or not the torsinA–luciferase complex was a “dead-end complex” that rendered the misfolded substrate incapable of being refolded, or whether torsinA could in fact hold the luciferase in a state for proper refolding by other chaperones. To this end, a luciferase reactivation assay was employed. We found that both WT and torsinA (ΔE) could maintain luciferase in a state for refolding, resulting in 40–50% reactivation of luciferase. This evidence indicates that the torsinA–luciferase complex was not in a dead-end state, and the misfolded protein could be salvaged.

The results of the luciferase reactivation assay prompted us to further examine the intermediate folding states of the misfolded protein, as well as the efficiency of torsinA in binding and releasing it. The CS inactivation assay differs from the luciferase reactivation because the refolding of the early intermediate states of CS depends upon their equilibrium with native CS. Thus, this assay depends on the ability of torsinA to bind and release these intermediates efficiently, thereby creating a reservoir of early CS intermediates, rather than requiring additional chaperones to remove it from torsinA and refold it themselves (Buchner et al. 1998 ). If torsinA can bind and release CS efficiently during heating, the activity of CS should be significantly extended compared to heating of CS with the negative control MBP. However, neither WT nor torsinA (ΔE) could protect CS from inactivation, suggesting that torsinA holds CS in a very stable complex that is not readily dissociated. This is not too surprising, as a number of small heat shock proteins can suppress CS aggregation but are unable to release it; these data often are suggestive of a requirement for other chaperones (Lee et al. 1995 ; Bose et al. 1996 ; Chang et al. 1996 ; Ehrnsperger et al. 1997 ).

Members of the AAA+ family share a highly conserved AAA domain responsible for their ATPase activity. The number of AAA domains in the protein classifies them as class I (containing two AAA domains) or class II (containing a single AAA domain) members, with a few proteins such as dynein containing six AAA domains (White and Lauring 2007 ). TorsinA is classified as a class II AAA+ protein containing a single AAA domain. Previous studies have found that the AAA domain is involved in the prevention of protein aggregation in both class I and II members that are capable of this function (Wawrzynow et al. 1995 ; Weibezahn et al. 2003 ; Song et al. 2007 ).

Past and present structural model predictions suggest that the structure of torsinA is most similar to that of the second AAA domain of ClpA and ClpB (Kock et al. 2006 ; Zhu et al. 2008 ). ClpB is an ATP-dependent chaperone present in E. coli , which is capable of preventing the aggregation of misfolded proteins as well as disaggregating them (Zolkiewski 1999 ). Although studies have shown that substrate interaction with ClpB occurs within the N-terminal AAA domain, its full chaperone capabilities require communication between both AAA domains in a cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis, which is linked to substrate binding and release (Schlieker et al. 2004 ; Doyle et al. 2007 ).

ClpA is another bacterial protein with ATP-dependent chaperone abilities similar to ClpB (Doyle et al. 2007 ). However, in contrast to ClpB, ClpA can also prevent aggregation in the absence of ATP (Wickner et al. 1994 ). Our study demonstrates that torsinA, which contains a single AAA domain, may function similar to ClpA in its ability to prevent aggregation in the absence of ATP. This is also similar to that of another AAA+ protein, valosin p97 (Song et al. 2007 ). Furthermore, both torsinA and ClpA can protect luciferase from thermal inactivation, although they require other chaperones for luciferase reactivation (Wickner et al. 1994 ). Despite the lack of altered chaperone function in the presence of ATP, it remains possible that torsinA, with the addition of activating cofactors of ATPase activity, might still act as an ATP-dependent chaperone similar to ClpA and ClpB.

The realization that torsinA (ΔE) possesses chaperone activity equal to that of the WT torsinA protein is interesting considering that previous studies have suggested that torsinA (ΔE) appears to result in loss of function (Hewett et al. 2000 ; McLean et al. 2002 ; Caldwell et al. 2003 ; Misbahuddin et al. 2004 ). Prior reports demonstrated that overexpressed torsinA (ΔE) was not only unable to recognize and prevent the aggregation of misfolded proteins but also formed membranous inclusions itself in cell cultures. In contrast, our in vitro data conclusively show that mutant torsinA (ΔE) was fully capable of recognizing and suppressing the aggregation of both luciferase and CS, as well as able to hold luciferase in an intermediate state for refolding.

It is possible that the overall reduction of chaperone activity seen in previous studies is due to sequestration of torsinA (ΔE) into membranous inclusions when overexpressed in cell culture and in vivo, thus rendering it incapable of activity. Notably, membranous inclusions are not observed when experiments are performed using DYT1 dystonia patient cells that have endogenous levels of torsinA (ΔE) (Walker et al. 2002 ; Rostasy et al. 2003 ; Bragg et al. 2004 ). Thus, the absence of torsinA (ΔE) chaperone function associated with overexpression in cell cultures could possibly be an artifact of the expression levels employed, as has been suggested by others (Gordon and Gonzalez-Alegre 2008 ).

Studies have shown that WT torsinA is a relatively long-lived protein that is degraded by autophagy while torsinA (∆E) is short lived, and is prematurely degraded through the proteasome and autophagy (Giles et al. 2008 ; Gordon and Gonzalez-Alegre 2008 ). Furthermore, human genetic studies have found that torsinA contains a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that changes aspartic acid (D) to histidine (H) at residue 216. Interestingly, this SNP is found more often in torsinA (∆E) carriers lacking dystonia symptoms but less often in those displaying symptoms (Kock et al. 2006 ; Risch et al. 2007 ). Likewise, studies have shown that co-expression of ∆216H and torsinA (∆E) in trans , but not in cis , leads to an overall reduction in inclusion formation (Kock et al. 2006 ). In the context of our work, where we show that both the WT and torsinA (∆E) proteins retain chaperone function, it is possible that the multimeric complex of these proteins together in vivo leads to an instability of the oligomer resulting in its early degradation.

To date, much of the accumulated evidence on torsinA suggests potentially distinct functions or differential interactions at both the NE and the ER. On one hand, the interaction of torsinA with LULL1 regulates its trafficking to, and subsequent restructuring of, the NE through interacting LINC complex proteins (Goodchild and Dauer 2005 ; Heyden et al. 2009 ). On the other hand, evidence has clearly shown torsinA to have implications on secretory pathway function, with the WT protein serving a necessary role in maintaining secretion efficiency in the ER (Hewett et al. 2007 ). The biochemical outcomes of our study lend solid evidence to the hypothesis that torsinA does in fact function as a molecular chaperone, irrespective of its intracellular locale or mutated state in dystonia. In this regard, torsinA chaperone activity need not presuppose a mutual exclusivity of function at either the ER or NE, as the diversity of chaperone functions in protein folding and trafficking are well established. Nevertheless, it remains important to further discern the consequences of torsinA activity in the context of its cellular localization, especially as it may pertain to the disease state.
