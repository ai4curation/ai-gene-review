We have recently reported the cloning of a cDNA coding for a stress inducible 
human chaperonin 10. The protein was shown to possess 100% identity with the 
bovine homologue and a single amino acid replacement (glycine to serine at 
position 52) compared to rat chaperonin 10. Here we report the heterologous 
expression of human chaperonin 10 in Escherichia coli, its purification and its 
functional characterization. The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity 
as judged by different analytical techniques, and mass spectrometry analysis 
showed a MW of 10,801 Da in agreement with the predicted sequence. This 
molecular weight accounts for a protein which is not modified 
post-translationally. In fact, natural rat chaperonin 10 has been shown to be 
acetylated at the N-terminus, a feature suggested to be important for targeting 
and functional activity. Here we show that recombinant human chaperonin 10 is 
fully active in assisting the chaperonin 60 GroEL in the refolding of denatured 
yeast enolase, thereby showing that, at least in the present system, 
post-translational acetylation is not necessary for its activity.
