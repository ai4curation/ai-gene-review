Significant insights into disease pathogenesis have been gleaned from 
population-level genetic studies; however, many loci associated with complex 
genetic disease contain numerous genes, and phenotypic associations cannot be 
assigned unequivocally. In particular, a gene-dense locus on chromosome 11 
(61.5-61.65 Mb) has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid 
arthritis, and coronary artery disease. Here, we identify TMEM258 within this 
locus as a central regulator of intestinal inflammation. Strikingly, Tmem258 
haploinsufficient mice exhibit severe intestinal inflammation in a model of 
colitis. At the mechanistic level, we demonstrate that TMEM258 is a required 
component of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex and is essential for N-linked 
protein glycosylation. Consequently, homozygous deficiency of Tmem258 in colonic 
organoids results in unresolved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress culminating in 
apoptosis. Collectively, our results demonstrate that TMEM258 is a central 
mediator of ER quality control and intestinal homeostasis.
