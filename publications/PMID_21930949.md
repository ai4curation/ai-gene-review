Mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) are associated with familial 
Alzheimer's disease. Recent development suggests that homo- and 
heterodimerization of APP and APP-like proteins (APLPs), which are enhanced by 
heparan sulfate binding, may play a role in signal transduction and cell 
adhesion. Despite efforts to model heparin binding based on known apo crystal 
structures, the mechanism of heparin-induced APP/APLP dimerization has not been 
established experimentally. Here we report the crystal structure of a complex 
between heparin and the E2 domain of APLP1, which harbors the conserved high 
affinity heparin binding site of the full-length molecule. Within the asymmetric 
E2:heparin complex, the polysaccharide is snugly bound inside a narrow groove 
between the two helical subdomains of one protein protomer. The nonreducing end 
of the sugar is positioned near the protein's 2-fold axis, making contacts with 
basic residues from the second protomer. The inability of the E2 dimer to 
accommodate two heparin molecules near its symmetry axis explains the observed 
21 binding stoichiometry, which is confirmed by isothermal titration 
calorimetric experiment carried out in solution. We also show that, at high 
concentrations, heparin can destabilize E2 dimer, probably by forcing into the 
unoccupied binding site observed in the 21 complex. The binding model suggested 
by the crystal structure may facilitate the design of heparin mimetics that are 
capable of modulating APP dimerization in cells.
