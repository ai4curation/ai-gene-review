Despite the known causality of copy-number variations (CNVs) to human 
neurodevelopmental disorders, the mechanisms behind each gene's contribution to 
the constellation of neural phenotypes remain elusive. Here, we investigated the 
7q11.23 CNV, whose hemideletion causes Williams syndrome (WS), and uncovered 
that mitochondrial dysfunction participates in WS pathogenesis. Dysfunction is 
facilitated in part by the 7q11.23 protein DNAJC30, which interacts with 
mitochondrial ATP-synthase machinery. Removal of Dnajc30 in mice resulted 
in hypofunctional mitochondria, diminished morphological features of neocortical 
pyramidal neurons, and altered behaviors reminiscent of WS. The mitochondrial 
features are consistent with our observations of decreased integrity of 
oxidative phosphorylation supercomplexes and ATP-synthase dimers in WS. Thus, we 
identify DNAJC30 as an auxiliary component of ATP-synthase machinery and reveal 
mitochondrial maladies as underlying certain defects in brain development and 
function associated with WS.

INTRODUCTION

Copy number variations (CNVs) are major contributors to disorders of the nervous system including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and schizophrenia (SCZ) ( Geschwind and Flint, 2015 ; Girirajan et al., 2011 ; Hu et al., 2014 ; Pescosolido et al., 2013 ; Sebat et al., 2007 ). A fundamental challenge to understanding these disorders is identifying critical genes within a CNV locus whose deletions or duplications drive specific neural phenotypes. This challenge is further complicated by the highly dynamic and precisely coordinated spatiotemporal transcriptional landscape of the human brain ( Silbereis et al., 2016 ). Previous efforts to identify genotype-phenotype correlations have largely relied on clinical assessments of patients harboring partial CNV locus deletions or duplications of otherwise well characterized syndromes ( Fusco et al., 2014 ; Hoeft et al., 2014 ). One of the best characterized CNVs and resulting syndromes is 7q11.23, where a hemizygous deletion of the 26–28 genes results in Williams-Beuren syndrome (WS) ( Dutly and Schinzel, 1996 ; Ewart et al., 1993 ; Frangiskakis et al., 1996 ; Gilbert-Dussardier et al., 1995 ; Osborne et al., 1996 ; Perez Jurado et al., 1996 ) and their duplication is associated with ASD or SCZ (7q11dup) ( Depienne et al., 2007 ; Merla et al., 2010 ; Mulle et al., 2014 ; Sanders et al., 2011 ; Somerville et al., 2005 ; Van der Aa et al., 2009 ).

The most prominent features of WS include cardiovascular, metabolic, and brain abnormalities ( Beuren et al., 1962 ; Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2006 ; Morris, 2010 ; Pober, 2010 ; Stinton et al., 2010 ; Williams et al., 1961 ). Specific metabolic deficits include diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, and higher resting energy expenditure ( Cherniske et al., 2004 ; Kaplan et al., 1998 ; Palacios-Verdu et al., 2015 ; Pober et al., 2010 ). Brain abnormalities include decreased cerebral volume, smaller neurons, and abnormal gyrification, ( Galaburda et al., 2002 ; Jackowski et al., 2009 ; Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2006 ; Reiss et al., 2000 ; Schmitt et al., 2001 ; Van Essen et al., 2006 ). While imaging studies have shown that several white matter axonal pathways, including long-range projection systems such as the anterior commissure and corticospinal tract, have an altered microstructure ( Arlinghaus et al., 2011 ; Campbell et al., 2009 ; Faria et al., 2012 ; Fung et al., 2012 ; Haas et al .; Hoeft et al., 2007 ), it is also appreciated that the corpus callosum (CC) is smaller and abnormally shaped in WS ( Faria et al., 2012 ; Luders et al., 2007 ; Marenco et al., 2007 ; Sampaio et al., 2013 ; Schmitt et al., 2001 ; Tomaiuolo et al., 2002 ). These anatomical abnormalities likely play a major role in WS manifestations of intellectual disability, increased anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and hypersociability ( Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2006 ).

The relationship between individual genes on 7q11.23 and the neuroanatomical and functional alterations as well as neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with WS, ASD, or SCZ are under investigation ( Abbas et al., 2016 ; Barak and Feng, 2016 ). Systems biology approaches have made some progress in understanding the role of individual CNV-related genes in a range of neurodevelopmental disorders ( Golzio et al., 2012 ; Malhotra and Sebat, 2012 ; Tebbenkamp et al., 2014 ). For example, one can identify misregulated transcripts from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells generated from 7q11.23 deletion and duplication patients ( Adamo et al., 2015 ), and query the spatiotemporal profile of those transcripts within the normally developing human brain to potentially reveal effects of gene dosage on disease and neurodevelopmentally relevant processes. Combining such datasets has the potential to glean novel insights into several CNVs or disorders with multi-genic contributions ( Gulsuner et al., 2013 ; Lin et al., 2015 ; Parikshak et al., 2013 ; Willsey et al., 2013 ). These strategies can provide some spatial and temporal resolution of disease processes, but still cannot reveal the role of individual genes. Pursuing genotype-phenotype correlations is a promising strategy to not only understand mechanisms of these disorders, but to make inroads towards identifying novel therapeutic interventions.

The goal of this study was to identify and functionally validate underexplored neurobiological processes uniquely affected in 7q11.23 syndromes. We employed systems biology analyses utilizing brain gene expression and protein-protein interaction datasets, a strategy which revealed molecular coordination and spatio-temporal specificity of gene expression within, and ontologies derived from, the 7q11.23 locus. By looking at both coordination within the locus and downstream ontologies we were able to identify mitochondrial processes as dysregulated in WS, as well as highlight the functionally uncharacterized gene DNAJC30 (previously known as WBSCR18 ). We describe the spatiotemporal expression profile of DNAJC30 , and show in comprehensive detail the function of DNAJC30 - from whole brain to neural circuits and behavior to its molecular interactions. Specifically, DNAJC30 is enriched in developing and mature neurons where it interacts with the mitochondrial ATP synthase machinery and facilitates ATP synthesis. We also found that decreased DNAJC30 expression in mice correlates with altered mitochondrial and neuronal function and morphology. Finally, we observed that several aberrations seen in Dnajc30 knockout mice are also present in post-mortem brain tissue and primary cells from WS patients, thus validating the participation of DNAJC30 in WS phenotypes.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we combined human brain transcriptomics and PPI datasets, with functional characterizations to reveal a novel role for mitochondria in normal human brain development and WS. Mitochondrial participation is driven in part by the heretofore functionally uncharacterized gene DNAJC30 . We revealed that DNAJC30 is highly enriched in neurons and is a novel auxiliary protein of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. Decreased DNAJC30 , whether in KO mice or tissue from WS patients, resulted in decreased ATP as well as deviations in neuronal morphology, electrophysiology, and mitochondrial function. Specifically, decreased Dnajc30 in mice causes thinner callosal axons, social aberrations, and increased anxiety, all major hallmarks of WS. To the best of our knowledge, these data are the first to demonstrate mitochondrial dysfunction as part of the pathogenesis of WS, and they also have implications for the role of mitochondria in 7q11.23 duplication syndromes and similar neurodevelopmental disorders.

Mitochondrial contribution to aging and neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Huntington’s disease (HD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and SCZ, has been previously established ( Manji et al., 2012 ; Riera and Dillin, 2015 ; Wallace, 2005 ). For example in HD and AD, mitochondria propagate secondary deleterious effects initiated by, respectively, the mutant HTT gene and Aβ peptides, which are cleaved from the AD-linked amyloid precursor protein (APP). Interestingly, Aβ peptides are also reported to be direct interacting partners with 7q11.23 proteins ABHD11, LIMK1, and DNAJC30. These protein interactions cluster within our ‘mitochondrial’ GO categories and, in light of mitochondria playing a role in 7q11.23 syndromes and AD, there may be some genetic interactions between the 7q11.23 locus and AD-linked loci. This hypothesis is substantiated in a report describing pathological hallmarks of Aβ plaques in a patient with WS ( Golden et al., 1995 ). Alternatively, it is reported that WS patients also exhibit several features of mild-accelerated aging ( Cherniske et al., 2004 ; Pober, 2010 ), which may be caused by dysfunctional mitochondria, and this dysfunction may subsequently facilitate neurodegenerative hallmarks.

In SCZ, several pieces of evidence suggest mitochondria can have an instrumental role ( Clay et al., 2011 ). Studies have shown that metabolic genes, including those of the transcarboxylic acid cycle and from the mitochondrial genome, have significantly decreased expression in the prefrontal cortex in postmortem SCZ tissue ( Arion et al., 2015 ; Middleton et al., 2002 ). Furthermore, the transcriptome alterations in mitochondrial energy production genes found in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex layer 3 neurons from SCZ are distinct compared to bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder ( Arion et al., 2017 ). It is also reported that complex I genes of the electron transport chain are decreased in the prefrontal cortex ( Karry et al., 2004 ), bolstering a hypothesis of hypofunctionality of prefrontal cognitive processes in SCZ. It is also known that variants in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that cause bona fide mitochondrial disorders such as Leigh syndrome or mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) often display psychiatric comorbidities including SCZ ( Verge et al., 2011 ). Other mtDNA variants, including in the aforementioned MT-ATP6 gene, have also been associated with SCZ outright ( Ueno et al., 2009 ). Interestingly, alteration in the levels of the mitochondrial protein uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), which controls substrate oxidation of the mitochondria in neurons ( Andrews et al., 2008 ), as well as mitochondrial fidelity overall, have significant impact on cortical structure and function ( Hermes et al., 2016 ; Kann and Kovacs, 2007 ; Li et al., 2004 ; Varela et al., 2016 ). These findings illustrate that mitochondrial function can facilitate neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder ( Cai et al., 2015 ; Converge Consortium, 2015 ) and intellectual and developmental disability (Ouyang et al., 2016), and substantiate the need for further investigations into similar neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD.

Investigations into mitochondria and ASD are relatively unchartered ( Naviaux, 2013 ; Smith et al., 2012 ). Early epidemiology of co-occurrences of mitochondrial disease and ASD have been followed by identifying disease-causing variants in mtDNA, thus laying the foundation for subsequent gene expression studies that revealed misexpression of several nuclear and mtDNA genes in postmortem ASD brains ( Legido et al., 2013 ). Others have used the human brain transcriptome to investigate unifying mechanisms of ASD and found that ASD candidate genes were enriched in co-expression modules of mitochondrial function ( Mahfouz et al., 2015 ). But fewer studies have revealed molecular mechanisms for how mitochondria can impact ASD ( Ebrahimi-Fakhari et al., 2016 ; Lin-Hendel et al., 2016 ; Novarino et al., 2012 ), which is a daunting task given that mitochondrial disorders and autism both exist on spectrums ( Amaral et al., 2008 ).

Our results provide the basis for exploring novel therapeutic options for WS, several of which are already being tested for mitochondrial disorders ( DiMauro et al., 2013 ). One example is Leigh syndrome, which, as stated, can be caused by mutations in MT-ATP6 . One study showed enhanced survival and attenuated disease in a mouse model of Leigh syndrome using the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin ( Johnson et al., 2013 ). Other frequently used pharmacological options for mitochondrial disorders include creatine, N-Acetyl Cysteine, and Coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10 ). While benefits varied in clinical trials, two synthetic analogs of CoQ 10 , idebenone and parabenzoquinone, have reversed vision loss in four of five patients with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and halted or reversed progression in children with Leigh syndrome ( Enns et al., 2012 ; Martinelli et al., 2012 ; Sadun et al., 2012 ). Because DNAJC30 is an auxiliary component of ATP synthase, compared to the essential protein MT-ATP6, it might be expected that the metabolic phenotypes in WS would be milder than in Leigh syndrome. Nevertheless, the molecular process is similar and thus it is anticipated that therapies for Leigh syndrome might also benefit WS. The potential of therapeutic intervention in WS, pharmacological or otherwise, is buoyed by our finding that cluster 1 genes, of which DNAJC30 is a member, are enriched postnatally, providing a larger time window to maximize treatments.

One specific open question remains about how removing Dnajc30 in mice resulted in mitochondrial malfunction, if not through obvious changes in OXPHOS supercomplexes. We are unfortunately limited in visualizing with which proteins the mouse ortholog of DNAJC30 interacts. Neither antibody we used, which reliably detects the human and monkey protein in native or denatured conditions, provides any signal for the mouse protein. Although these proteins share high homology, there are enough amino acid differences that may lose the epitope in mice, and similarly, may alter its function and interacting partners. For example, there is a seven residue deletion in mouse of the human sequence T 37 YSQGDC 43 , which contains a number of polar residues just N-terminal to the J-domain. There are also variations S82P and T105I (residues 75 and 98 in mouse, respectively), in the middle of the J-domain, and several variations between the J-domain and transmembrane region. One can hypothesize several effects of variations, but their elucidation may require structural biology techniques.
