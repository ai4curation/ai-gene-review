The NF-kappaB transcription factor is normally transiently activated by 
proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS); however, 
persistent NF-kappaB activation is commonly observed in inflammatory disease and 
malignancy. The ubiquitin editing enzyme A20 serves an essential role in the 
termination of TNF-alpha- and LPS-mediated NF-kappaB signaling by inactivating 
key signaling molecules. However, little is known about how A20 is regulated and 
if other molecules play a role in the termination of NF-kappaB signaling. Here 
we demonstrate that Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) is essential for the 
termination of NF-kappaB and JNK activation in response to TNF-alpha, IL-1 and 
LPS stimulation. In TAX1BP1-deficient mouse fibroblasts, TNF-alpha-, IL-1- and 
LPS-mediated IKK and JNK activation is elevated and persistent owing to enhanced 
ubiquitination of RIP1 and TRAF6. Furthermore, in the absence of TAX1BP1, A20 is 
impaired in RIP1 binding, deubiquitination of TRAF6 and inhibition of NF-kappaB 
activation. Thus, TAX1BP1 is pivotal for the termination of NF-kappaB and JNK 
signaling by functioning as an essential regulator of A20.

Abstract

The NF-κB transcription factor is normally transiently activated by proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS); however, persistent NF-κB activation is commonly observed in inflammatory disease and malignancy. The ubiquitin editing enzyme A20 serves an essential role in the termination of TNF-α- and LPS-mediated NF-κB signaling by inactivating key signaling molecules. However, little is known about how A20 is regulated and if other molecules play a role in the termination of NF-κB signaling. Here we demonstrate that Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) is essential for the termination of NF-κB and JNK activation in response to TNF-α, IL-1 and LPS stimulation. In TAX1BP1-deficient mouse fibroblasts, TNF-α-, IL-1- and LPS-mediated IKK and JNK activation is elevated and persistent owing to enhanced ubiquitination of RIP1 and TRAF6. Furthermore, in the absence of TAX1BP1, A20 is impaired in RIP1 binding, deubiquitination of TRAF6 and inhibition of NF-κB activation. Thus, TAX1BP1 is pivotal for the termination of NF-κB and JNK signaling by functioning as an essential regulator of A20.

Introduction

NF-κB/Rel is a family of enhancer binding proteins that play a central role in cell growth, survival, development and innate and adaptive immunity ( Hayden and Ghosh, 2004 ). The mammalian NF-κB is composed of five subunits, RelA (p65), p50, c-Rel, p52 and RelB, which form various homo- and hetero-dimeric protein complexes. The NF-κB proteins all contain a Rel homology domain that has been shown to confer DNA binding, nuclear localization and dimerization properties. NF-κB is held inactive in the cytosol by a family of inhibitory proteins known as IκBs that mask the nuclear localization signals of NF-κB ( Rothwarf and Karin, 1999 ). Proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), viral-encoded proteins, such as the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) Tax, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) all activate the IκB kinase (IKK), which is composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory component, IKKγ ( Hacker and Karin, 2006 ). The activated IKK phosphorylates IκBs, triggering their proteolysis through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, facilitating nuclear import of NF-κB and activation of target genes ( Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000 ).

Signaling events upstream of IKK have been characterized in great detail for the TNF-α and IL-1 signaling pathways. TNF-α binding to the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) results in the recruitment of the adaptor protein TRADD, which subsequently recruits a signaling complex consisting of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), TRAF5 and RIP1 ( Tada et al , 2001 ). TRAF2 or RIP1 then plays a role in the recruitment of the IKK complex to TNFR1, leading to oligomerization and activation ( Devin et al , 2001 ). Binding of IL-1 to the IL-1R triggers the recruitment of the adaptor protein MyD88 to the receptor ( Medzhitov et al , 1998 ). MyD88 then recruits the kinases IRAK1 and IRAK4, which play an essential role in the recruitment of TRAF6, triggering its oligomerization and autoubiquitination via lysine 63 (K63)-linked ubiquitin chains ( Deng et al , 2000 ). Downstream of TRAF6, TGF-β- activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and the adaptor proteins TAB2, TAB3 mediate the activation of the IKK complex ( Sato et al , 2005 ; Shim et al , 2005 ). TAK1 has also been reported to be important for TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation ( Takaesu et al , 2003 ). Also, TRAF6 is an essential component for NF-κB activation downstream of CD40 and Toll-like receptors ( Lomaga et al , 1999 ). In addition to NF-κB activation, both TNF-α and IL-1 are potent activators of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which regulates the activation of AP-1 transcription factors, including c-jun and ATF-2 ( Song et al , 1997 ).

NF-κB is tightly regulated by numerous mechanisms to maintain transient activation in order to prevent inflammation-induced tissue damage or malignancy associated with persistent NF-κB activation ( Karin and Greten, 2005 ). The NF-κB inhibitor IκBα is an NF-κB target gene, thus providing a mechanism for the replenishment of the pool of degraded IκBα and the removal of NF-κB from the nucleus ( Sun et al , 1993 ). Ubiquitination plays important regulatory roles in several steps of NF-κB signaling events, and thus is an important target for several negative regulators of NF-κB. The cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (CYLD) has been shown to inhibit IKK downstream of LPS, CD40 and IL-1 by cleaving K63-linked ubiquitin chains on TRAF2, TRAF6 and IKKγ ( Trompouki et al , 2003 ). CYLD also deubiquitinates and modulates the subcellular localization of Bcl-3 ( Massoumi et al , 2006 ). CYLD-deficient mice exhibit defective T-cell development owing to impaired regulation of the ubiquitination of the Lck kinase ( Reiley et al , 2006 ). Another deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that is an important regulator of NF-κB is A20, which is a transcriptional target of NF-κB ( Krikos et al , 1992 ). A20-deficient mice develop severe inflammation and cachexia and die prematurely ( Lee et al , 2000 ). A20 −/− murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit persistent NF-κB and IKK activation in response to TNF-α stimulation ( Lee et al , 2000 ). At least three targets of A20 have been identified, TRAF6, RIP1 and IKKγ ( Boone et al , 2004 ; Wertz et al , 2004 ; Mauro et al , 2006 ). A20 contains an amino-terminal ovarian tumor (OTU) domain and seven carboxy-terminal zinc–finger domains ( Evans et al , 2004 ). A20 inhibits RIP1 by removing K63-linked ubiquitin chains via the OTU domain, and also catalyzes K48-linked ubiquitin chains via the zinc-fingers, leading to RIP1 degradation ( Wertz et al , 2004 ). Thus, A20 functions as a negative regulator by acting as a dual-function DUB and E3 ligase.

Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1), also known as T6BP or TXBP151, is an 86 kDa protein that contains three central coiled-coil domains and two C-terminal zinc-finger domains ( Ling and Goeddel, 2000 ). In addition, TAX1BP1 contains an N-terminal novel membrane binding domain termed SKIP carboxyl homology (SKICH) ( Gurung et al , 2003 ). TAX1BP1 was cloned as an HTLV-I Tax-interacting protein by a yeast two-hybrid screen ( Jin et al , 1997 ; Gachon et al , 1998 ). TAX1BP1 also interacts with TRAF6 in an IL-1-inducible manner, which is dependent on IRAK1 ( Ling and Goeddel, 2000 ). TAX1BP1 has also been shown to interact with A20 by a yeast two-hybrid screen ( De Valck et al , 1999 ). TAX1BP1 inhibits TNF- and Fas-mediated apoptosis, and antisense TAX1BP1 inhibits the anti-apoptotic effect of A20, suggesting that TAX1BP1 may mediate the function of A20 ( De Valck et al , 1999 ). Furthermore, TNF-α- or Fas-mediated apoptosis led to cleavage of TAX1BP1 by caspases, which was inhibited by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk or by expression of the viral-encoded caspase inhibitor CrmA ( De Valck et al , 1999 ). In a recent study, it was demonstrated that TAX1BP1 acts as a nuclear receptor coactivator and is functionally repressed by HTLV-I Tax ( Chin et al , 2007 ). To determine the physiological function of TAX1BP1, we generated TAX1BP1 knockout mice by a gene trapping strategy. Although homozygous null TAX1BP1 mice are not viable, TAX1BP1-deficient MEFs exhibit elevated and persistent NF-κB and JNK activation in response to TNF-α, IL-1 and LPS stimulation. RIP1 and TRAF6 ubiquitination was highly upregulated in TAX1BP1-deficient MEFs owing to impaired A20 function. Therefore, our results suggest that TAX1BP1 functions as an essential regulator of A20.

Discussion

In this report, we have demonstrated that TAX1BP1 plays a pivotal role in the termination of NF-κB and JNK signaling. TAX1BP1-deficient MEFs exhibited enhanced and persistent NF-κB activation in response to TNF-α, IL-1 and LPS treatment. Persistent signaling in the mutant MEFs was attributed to defective termination of IKK and JNK kinase activity due to impaired downregulation of RIP1 and TRAF6 ubiquitination. Importantly, reintroduction of full-length TAX1BP1 in mutant MEFs was sufficient to restore transient NF-κB and JNK signaling. Our study has also demonstrated that A20 requires TAX1BP1 to interact with RIP1 and to inhibit NF-κB; thus, TAX1BP1 is an essential regulator of A20.

TAX1BP1 m/m mice are not viable owing to hemorrhaging and cardiac defects ( Figure 2 and data not shown), suggesting that TAX1BP1 plays an essential role in vascular development. A number of gene-targeted mice, including Crk ( Park et al , 2006 ), SLP-76 ( Abtahian et al , 2003 ) and Tab1 ( Komatsu et al , 2002 ) also succumb to hemorrhaging and cardiac defects during embryonic development. It will be interesting to determine if TAX1BP1 regulates any of these proteins, in particular Tab1, which is known to play a role in IL-1 signaling ( Bertelsen and Sanfridson, 2007 ). Future studies will examine the integrity of blood vessels and the vascular network in TAX1BP1 m/m embryos and if TAX1BP1 expression is required in endothelial cells or other cell types such as platelets to prevent hemorrhaging. One may envision that TAX1BP1 regulates signaling pathways either in endothelial or hematopoietic cells that control vascular development. Although TAX1BP1 and A20 −/− MEFs are similarly impaired in the termination of TNF-mediated NF-κB and JNK signaling, the phenotypes of TAX1BP1 and A20 knockout mice are distinct ( Lee et al , 2000 ). A20 −/− mice develop severe inflammation and cachexia and die within weeks of birth ( Lee et al , 2000 ). The distinct phenotypes between A20 and TAX1BP1 knockout mice suggest that TAX1BP1 likely exerts additional A20-independent functions. Future studies will examine the function of TAX1BP1 in individual immune cell subtypes and other tissues by conditional gene targeting.

TAX1BP1 was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as an HTLV-I Tax interacting protein ( Jin et al , 1997 ; Gachon et al , 1998 ). Our data indicate that TAX1BP1 clearly exerts an inhibitory effect on Tax activation of NF-κB. However, it is unclear exactly why Tax interacts with TAX1BP1. Since Tax is ubiquitinated ( Peloponese et al , 2004 ; Lamsoul et al , 2005 ) and ubiquitination of Tax regulates NF-κB activation, it is plausible that TAX1BP1 may modulate Tax ubiquitination. Another possibility is that Tax may impair the function of TAX1BP1. A recent study by Chin et al (2007) supports this hypothesis, since Tax impaired the nuclear receptor coactivator function of TAX1BP1. One may envision that Tax may also impair the NF-κB inhibitory function of TAX1BP1, thus explaining why NF-κB is persistently activated by Tax despite the presence of multiple negative regulatory mechanisms ( Harhaj and Harhaj, 2005 ).

TAX1BP1 contains an N-terminal SKICH domain, three central coiled-coil domains and two C-terminal zinc-finger domains ( Ling and Goeddel, 2000 ; Gurung et al , 2003 ). The predicted protein product in the TAX1BP1 m/m mice (1–204/βgeo) lacks all of the coiled-coil domains and the zinc-finger domains. Thus, it is likely that one or more of these domains are critical for the inhibition of persistent NF-κB and JNK signaling. In support of this hypothesis, overexpression of TAX1BP1 1–204 was unable to mediate the deubiquitination of TRAF6 ( Figure 7C ). Coiled-coil domains are known to mediate protein/protein interactions, and HTLV-I Tax preferentially interacts with proteins that contain coiled-coil domains ( Chun et al , 2000 ). Not surprisingly, Tax interacts with TAX1BP1 via the coiled-coil domains ( Chin et al , 2007 ). TAX1BP1 has been shown to contain two independent domains that mediate TRAF6 binding, 1–320 containing the first coiled-coil domain and 321–747 containing the second and third coiled-coil domains ( Ling and Goeddel, 2000 ). In addition, the second coiled-coil domain is responsible for TAX1BP1 self-association ( Ling and Goeddel, 2000 ). Future studies will more precisely identify the regions of TAX1BP1 critical for NF-κB inhibition by retroviral-mediated reconstitution of TAX1BP1 m/m MEFs.

The persistent NF-κB activation we have observed with TAX1BP1 mutant MEFs is strikingly similar to that observed with A20 −/− MEFs ( Lee et al , 2000 ). TAX1BP1 was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a binding partner of both A20 and TRAF6. However, persistent NF-κB activation in A20 −/− MEFs is observed with TNF-α and LPS, but not IL-1, stimulation ( Lee et al , 2000 ; Boone et al , 2004 ). Thus, functional cooperation between TAX1BP1 and A20 may be specific for the downregulation of TNFR and TLR4 signaling pathways. This also raises the interesting possibility that TAX1BP1 may require a distinct DUB to exert negative regulatory effects on IL-1-mediated NF-κB and JNK activation. One candidate is CYLD, which has been shown to be a negative regulator of both JNK and IKK in IL-1 signaling ( Reiley et al , 2004 ). In support of this hypothesis, we have recently observed an interaction between TAX1BP1 and CYLD under overexpression conditions (data not shown). The role of TAX1BP1 in CYLD regulation as well as the identification of putative DUBs regulating IL-1 signaling will be of great interest for future studies.

TAX1BP1 functions as a negative regulator of ubiquitination of key signaling molecules that are also targeted by A20. Given the lack of any known DUB domain in TAX1BP1, we propose that TAX1BP1 promotes the deubiquitination of TRAF6 and RIP1 via A20. This notion is supported by our finding that overexpressed TAX1BP1 inhibits TRAF6 ubiquitination, and this effect is abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of A20. Similarly, A20-mediated deubiquitination of TRAF6 is dependent on TAX1BP1 expression. TAX1BP1 has been reported to interact with A20 and TRAF6, and we demonstrate here a novel interaction with RIP1. We have also shown that TAX1BP1 promotes an interaction between A20 and its substrates TRAF6 and RIP1. Furthermore, TAX1BP1 expression is required for A20 binding to RIP1 and A20-mediated inhibition of NF-κB activation. Taken together, these data support a model whereby TAX1BP1 functions as an adaptor molecule for A20 by recruitment to specific targets such as TRAF6, RIP1 and possibly IKKγ. In the absence of TAX1BP1, A20 would be unable to engage TRAF6 or RIP1 for proper signal termination downstream of TLR4 and TNFR, respectively. TAX1BP1 would also speculatively serve an analogous role for another DUB in IL-1 signaling. Future studies will more precisely define the adaptor function of TAX1BP1, and identify additional targets of TAX1BP1 in inflammatory and innate immune signaling pathways.
