Human ADP-ribosylhydrolase 1 (hARH1, ADPRH) cleaves the glycosidic bond of 
ADP-ribose attached to an Arg residue of a protein. hARH1 has been cloned, 
expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized in 
complex with K(+) and ADP. The orthorhombic crystals contained one monomer per 
asymmetric unit, exhibited a solvent content of 43% and diffracted X-rays to a 
resolution of 1.9 A. A prerequisite for obtaining well diffracting crystals was 
the performance of X-ray fluorescence analysis on poorly diffracting apo hARH1 
crystals, which revealed the presence of trace amounts of K(+) in the crystal. 
Adding K-ADP to the crystallization cocktail then resulted in a crystal of 
different morphology and with dramatically improved diffraction properties.
