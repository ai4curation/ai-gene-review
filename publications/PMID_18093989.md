AIMS: Currently, many potential cardiac revascularization therapies target the 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, with variable success. 
Knowledge regarding the role of the VEGF/Notch/ephrinB2 cascade in (ab)normal 
coronary development will provide information on the subtle balance of VEGF 
signalling in coronary maturation and might enhance our therapeutic 
possibilities.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of VEGF isoforms on coronary development was 
explored in vivo using immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR on Vegf120/120 mouse 
embryos solely expressing VEGF120. In vitro, human arterial coronary endothelial 
cells were treated with VEGF121 or VEGF165 upon which RT-qPCR was performed. In 
vivo, mutant coronary arterial endothelium showed a decrease in protein 
expression of arterial markers such as cleaved Notch1, Delta-like4, and ephrinB2 
concomitant with an increase of venous markers such as chicken ovalbumin 
upstream promoter transcription factor II. The venous endothelium showed the 
opposite effect, which was confirmed on the mRNA level. In vitro, mRNA 
expression of arterial markers highly depended on the VEGF isoform used, with 
VEGF165 having the strongest effect. Also, coronary arteriogenesis was anomalous 
in the mouse embryos with decreased arterial and increased venous medial 
development as shown by staining for smooth muscle alpha-actin, Delta-like1, and 
Notch3.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that VEGF isoform-related spatiotemporal cardiac 
alterations in the VEGF/Notch/ephrinB2 cascade lead to disturbed coronary 
development. This knowledge can contribute to optimizing therapies targeting 
VEGF signalling by enabling balancing between angiogenesis and vascular 
maturation.
