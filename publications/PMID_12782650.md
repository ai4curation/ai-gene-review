Mammalian telomeres are coated by the sequence-specific, DNA-binding protein, 
TRF1, a negative regulator of telomere length. Previous results showed that 
ADP-ribosylation of TRF1 by tankyrase 1 released TRF1 from telomeres and 
promoted telomere elongation. We now show that loss of TRF1 from telomeres 
results in ubiquitination and degradation of TRF1 by the proteasome and that 
degradation is required to keep TRF1 off telomeres. Ubiquitination of TRF1 is 
regulated by its telomere-binding status; only the telomere-unbound form of TRF1 
is ubiquitinated. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism of sequential post 
translational modification of TRF1 (ADP-ribosylation and ubiquitination) for 
regulating access of telomerase to telomeres.
