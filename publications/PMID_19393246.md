Assembly of cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial 
respiratory chain, requires a concerted activity of a number of chaperones and 
factors for the insertion of subunits, accessory proteins, cofactors and 
prosthetic groups. It is now well accepted that the multienzyme complexes of the 
respiratory chain are organized in vivo as supramolecular functional structures, 
so-called supercomplexes. Here, we investigate the role of COX17 in the 
biogenesis of the respiratory chain in HeLa cells. In accordance with its 
predicted function as a copper chaperone and its role in formation of the 
binuclear copper centre of cytochrome c oxidase, COX17 siRNA knockdown affects 
activity and assembly of cytochrome c oxidase. While the abundance of cytochrome 
c oxidase dimers seems to be unaffected, blue native gel electrophoresis reveals 
the disappearance of COX-containing supercomplexes as an early response. We 
observe the accumulation of a novel approximately 150 kDa complex that contains 
Cox1, but not Cox2. This observation may indicate that the absence of Cox17 
interferes with copper delivery to Cox2, but not to Cox1. We suggest that 
supercomplex formation is not simply due to assembly of completely assembled 
complexes. An interdependent assembly scenario for the formation of 
supercomplexes that rather requires the coordinated synthesis and association of 
individual complexes, is proposed.
