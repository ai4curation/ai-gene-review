WDTC1/Adp encodes an evolutionarily conserved suppressor of lipid accumulation. 
While reduced WDTC1 expression is associated with obesity in mice and humans, 
its cellular function is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that WDTC1 is a component 
of a DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 (CRL4) E3 ligase. Using 3T3-L1 cell culture model of 
adipogenesis, we show that disrupting the interaction between WDTC1 and DDB1 
leads to a loss of adipogenic suppression by WDTC1, increased triglyceride 
accumulation and adipogenic gene expression. We show that the CRL4(WDTC) (1) 
complex promotes histone H2AK119 monoubiquitylation, thus suggesting a role for 
this complex in transcriptional repression during adipogenesis. Our results 
identify a biochemical role for WDTC1 and extend the functional range of the 
CRL4 complex to the suppression of fat accumulation.
