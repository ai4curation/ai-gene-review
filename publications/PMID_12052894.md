HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer) and its close relative HRG22 (HIC1-related gene 
on chromosome 22) encode transcriptional repressors with five C(2)H(2) zinc 
fingers and an N-terminal BTB/POZ autonomous transcriptional repression domain 
that is unable to recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs). Alignment of the HIC1 
and HRG22 proteins from various species highlighted a perfectly conserved 
GLDLSKK/R motif highly related to the consensus CtBP interaction motif 
(PXDLSXK/R), except for the replacement of the virtually invariant proline by a 
glycine. HIC1 strongly interacts with mCtBP1 both in vivo and in vitro through 
this conserved GLDLSKK motif, thus extending the CtBP consensus binding site. 
The BTB/POZ domain does not interact with mCtBP1, but the dimerization of HIC1 
through this domain is required for the interaction with mCtBP1. When tethered 
to DNA by fusion with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, the HIC1 central region 
represses transcription through interactions with CtBP in a trichostatin 
A-sensitive manner. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that HIC1 mediates 
transcriptional repression by both HDAC-independent and HDAC-dependent 
mechanisms and show that CtBP is a HIC1 corepressor that is recruited via a 
variant binding site.
