Although muscle satellite cells were identified almost 40 years ago, little is 
known about the induction of their proliferation and differentiation in response 
to physiological/pathological stimuli or to growth factors/cytokines. In order 
to investigate the role of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)/IGF binding 
protein (IGFBP) system in adult human myoblast differentiation we have developed 
a primary human skeletal muscle cell model. We show that under low serum media 
(LSM) differentiating conditions, the cells secrete IGF binding proteins-2, -3, 
-4 and -5. Intact IGFBP-5 was detected at days 1 and 2 but by day 7 in LSM it 
was removed by proteolysis. IGFBP-4 levels were also decreased at day 7 in the 
presence of IGF-I, potentially by proteolysis. In contrast, we observed that 
IGFBP-3 initially decreased on transfer of cells into LSM but then increased 
with myotube formation. Treatment with 20 ng/ml tumour necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNFalpha), which inhibits myoblast differentiation, blocked IGFBP-3 production 
and secretion whereas 30 ng/ml IGF-I, which stimulates myoblast differentiation, 
increased IGFBP-3 secretion. The TNFalpha-induced decrease in IGFBP-3 production 
and inhibition of differentiation could not be rescued by addition of IGF-I. 
LongR(3)IGF-I, which does not bind to the IGFBPs, had a similar effect on 
differentiation and IGFBP-3 secretion as IGF-I, both with and without TNFalpha, 
confirming that increased IGFBP-3 is not purely due to increased stability 
conferred by binding to IGF-I. Furthermore reduction of IGFBP-3 secretion using 
antisense oligonucleotides led to an inhibition of differentiation. Taken 
together these data indicate that IGFBP-3 supports myoblast differentiation.
