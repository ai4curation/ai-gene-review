Neurabin and spinophilin are homologous protein phosphatase 1 and actin binding 
proteins that regulate dendritic spine function. A yeast two-hybrid analysis 
using the coiled-coil domain of neurabin revealed an interaction with Lfc, a Rho 
GEF. Lfc was highly expressed in brain, where it interacted with either neurabin 
or spinophilin. In neurons, Lfc was largely found in the shaft of dendrites in 
association with microtubules but translocated to spines upon neuronal 
stimulation. Moreover, expression of Lfc resulted in reduction in spine length 
and size. Both the translocation and the effect on spine morphology depended on 
the coiled-coil domain of Lfc. Coexpression of neurabin or spinophilin with Lfc 
resulted in their clustering together with F-actin, a process that depended on 
Rho activity. Thus, interaction between Lfc and neurabin/spinophilin selectively 
regulates Rho-dependent organization of F-actin in spines and is a link between 
the microtubule and F-actin cytoskeletons in dendrites.
