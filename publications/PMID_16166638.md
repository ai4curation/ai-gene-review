In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, polarized growth depends on interactions between 
the actin cytoskeleton and the secretory machinery. Here we show that the Rab 
GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) Msb3 and Msb4 interact directly with Spa2, a 
scaffold protein of the "polarisome" that also interacts with the formin Bni1. 
Spa2 is required for the polarized localization of Msb3 and Msb4 at the bud tip. 
We also show that Msb3 and Msb4 bind specifically to Cdc42-GDP and Rho1-GDP in 
vitro and that Msb3 and Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor act independently but 
oppositely on Cdc42. Finally, we show that Msb3 and Msb4 are involved in 
Bni1-nucleated actin assembly in vivo. These results suggest that Msb3 and Msb4 
regulate polarized growth by multiple mechanisms, directly regulating exocytosis 
through their GAP activity toward Sec4 and potentially coordinating the 
functions of Cdc42, Rho1, and Bni1 in the polarisome through their binding to 
these GTPases. A functional equivalent of the polarisome probably exists in 
other fungi and mammals.
