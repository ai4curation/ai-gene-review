Accurate segregation of chromosomes in mitosis is ensured by a surveillance 
mechanism called the mitotic (or spindle assembly) checkpoint. It prevents 
sister chromatid separation until all chromosomes are correctly attached to the 
mitotic spindle through their kinetochores. The checkpoint acts by inhibiting 
the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a ubiquitin ligase that 
targets for degradation securin, an inhibitor of anaphase initiation. The 
activity of APC/C is inhibited by a mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), composed 
of the APC/C activator Cdc20 bound to the checkpoint proteins MAD2, BubR1, and 
Bub3. When all kinetochores acquire bipolar attachment the checkpoint is 
inactivated, but the mechanisms of checkpoint inactivation are not understood. 
We have previously observed that hydrolyzable ATP is required for exit from 
checkpoint-arrested state. In this investigation we examined the possibility 
that ATP hydrolysis in exit from checkpoint is linked to the action of the 
Mad2-binding protein p31(comet) in this process. It is known that p31(comet) 
prevents the formation of a Mad2 dimer that it thought to be important for 
turning on the mitotic checkpoint. This explains how p31(comet) blocks the 
activation of the checkpoint but not how it promotes its inactivation. Using 
extracts from checkpoint-arrested cells and MCC isolated from such extracts, we 
now show that p31(comet) causes the disassembly of MCC and that this process 
requires β,γ-hydrolyzable ATP. Although p31(comet) binds to Mad2, it promotes 
the dissociation of Cdc20 from BubR1 in MCC.
