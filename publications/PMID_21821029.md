Amplification of Aurora-A, encoding a cell cycle-regulating kinase, has been 
reported in human cancers. Although Aurora-A is known to directly phosphorylate 
and down-regulate p53, the detailed mechanism remains unclear. Here we show that 
Aurora-A phosphorylates hnRNPK, a transcriptional coactivator of p53, on serine 
379. This phosphorylation does not affect the post-transcriptional activity or 
cellular localization of hnRNPK, but disrupts its interaction with p53. Inverse 
correlation between Aurora-A activity and hnRNPK-p53 interaction was further 
demonstrated in DNA-damaged cells. Our results provide an alternative mechanism, 
whereby via phosphorylating hnRNPK Aurora-A participates in regulating p53 
activity during DNA damage.
