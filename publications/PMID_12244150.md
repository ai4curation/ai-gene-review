IL-21 is a recently characterized T cell-derived cytokine that regulates NK and 
T cell function. IL-21R shares the common gamma-chain (gamma(c)) with the 
receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. Despite the same gamma(c), 
these cytokines have different effects on diverse cells. In this study, we have 
studied IL-15- and IL-21-induced gene expression in human primary NK and T cells 
and the NK-92 cell line. Both IL-15 and IL-21 rapidly induced mRNA synthesis for 
IFN-gamma, T-bet, IL-2Ralpha, IL-12Rbeta2, IL-18R, and myeloid differentiation 
factor 88 (MyD88), the genes that are important in activating innate immunity 
and Th1 response. IL-15 induced STAT5 DNA binding to the IL-2Ralpha 
IFN-gamma-activated sequence (GAS), MyD88 GAS, and c-cis-inducible elements, 
whereas IL-21 induced STAT3 DNA binding to MyD88 GAS and c-sis-inducible 
elements. IL-21-induced STAT3 activation was verified by immunoprecipitation and 
Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine Ab. In addition, pretreatment of 
NK-92 cells with IL-15 or IL-21 strongly enhanced IL-12-induced STAT4 DNA 
binding to IL-2Ralpha GAS. The induction of IFN-gamma, T-bet, IL-12Rbeta2, and 
IL-18R gene expression in NK cells, along with STAT3 activation, suggests that 
IL-21 is involved in the activation of innate immune responses. Moreover, the 
enhanced transcription of these genes in T cells establishes a significant role 
for IL-21 also in the Th1 response.
