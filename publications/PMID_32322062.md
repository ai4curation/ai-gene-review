Cancer cells increase lipogenesis for their proliferation and the activation of 
sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) has a central role in this 
process. SREBPs are inhibited by a complex composed of INSIG proteins, SREBP 
cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and sterols in the endoplasmic reticulum. 
Regulation of the interaction between INSIG proteins and SCAP by sterol levels 
is critical for the dissociation of the SCAP-SREBP complex from the endoplasmic 
reticulum and the activation of SREBPs1,2. However, whether this protein 
interaction is regulated by a mechanism other than the abundance of sterol-and 
in particular, whether oncogenic signalling has a role-is unclear. Here we show 
that activated AKT in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells phosphorylates 
cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), the rate-limiting enzyme 
in gluconeogenesis, at Ser90. Phosphorylated PCK1 translocates to the 
endoplasmic reticulum, where it uses GTP as a phosphate donor to phosphorylate 
INSIG1 at Ser207 and INSIG2 at Ser151. This phosphorylation reduces the binding 
of sterols to INSIG1 and INSIG2 and disrupts the interaction between INSIG 
proteins and SCAP, leading to the translocation of the SCAP-SREBP complex to the 
Golgi apparatus, the activation of SREBP proteins (SREBP1 or SREBP2) and the 
transcription of downstream lipogenesis-related genes, proliferation of tumour 
cells, and tumorigenesis in mice. In addition, phosphorylation of PCK1 at Ser90, 
INSIG1 at Ser207 and INSIG2 at Ser151 is not only positively correlated with the 
nuclear accumulation of SREBP1 in samples from patients with HCC, but also 
associated with poor HCC prognosis. Our findings highlight the importance of the 
protein kinase activity of PCK1 in the activation of SREBPs, lipogenesis and the 
development of HCC.
