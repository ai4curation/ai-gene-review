Pre-eclampsia is thought to be a systemic disease of maternal endothelial cell 
dysfunctions. miRNAs regulate various basic biological functions in cells, 
including stem cells. Mesenchymal stem cells exist in almost all tissues and are 
the key cellular source for tissue repair and regeneration. Our aims are to 
investigate whether miRNAs regulate MSCs in fetal-maternal interfaces to 
influence the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The differential expression of 
miRNAs in decidua-derived mesenchymal stem cells of all patients with severe 
pre-eclampsia (n = 20) and normal groups (n = 20) was first screened by 
microarray analysis and validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The 
integrated bioinformatics analysis showed that miR-16 showed the highest number 
of connections in the miRNA GO network and the miRNA gene network. Moreover, 
over-expressed miR-16 inhibited the proliferation and migration of 
decidua-derived mesenchymal stem cells and induced cell-cycle arrest by 
targeting cyclin E1. Interestingly, over-expression of miR-16 by decidua-derived 
mesenchymal stem cells reduced the ability of human umbilical vein endothelial 
cells to form blood vessels and reduced the migration of trophoblast cells. 
Furthermore, decidua-derived mesenchymal stem cell-expressed endothelial growth 
factor VEGF-A was involved in migration of trophoblast cells and human umbilical 
vein endothelial cells as well as tube and network formation. Importantly, the 
levels of cyclin E1 and VEGF-A were negatively correlated with the level of 
miR-16 expression in decidua-derived mesenchymal stem cells from the patients 
with severe pre-eclampsia. Together, these data suggest that the alteration of 
miR-16 expression in decidua-derived mesenchymal stem cells may be involved in 
the development of pre-eclampsia.
