In an approach to gain insight into the sequence-dependent dephosphorylation of 
multiple phosphotyrosyl-containing peptides by the phosphatases SHP-1 and PTP1B, 
we applied a chromatographic technique for the analysis of the dephosphorylation 
products. Mono-, bi- and triphosphorylated reference peptides corresponding to 
positions 1999-2014 in the activation loop of the receptor tyrosine kinase Ros 
were first analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. 
Then, the respective products from enzymatic treatment were investigated by HPLC 
and compared to the standard peptides. The results obtained in this study 
emphasize the advantage of monitoring phosphatase reactions for mono- and 
biphosphorylated peptides using the described procedure rather than 
spectrophotometric and fluorimetric methods that do not allow for a clear 
identification of the products formed.
