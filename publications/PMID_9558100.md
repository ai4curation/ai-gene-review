Cells of the dendritic lineage are thought to be among the first cells infected 
after mucosal exposure to HIV. In this study, we have identified the presence of 
multiple chemokine receptors on dendritic cells (DC) that may function as 
coreceptors for HIV entry. DC effectively used CCR5 for entry of macrophage 
(M)-tropic isolates. CCR3, the eotaxin receptor, initially identified on 
eosinophils, is expressed on DC and may be used as an entry coreceptor by 
certain dual-tropic strains. CXCR4 was not expressed on DC, although SDF-1 
induced a calcium flux and DC could be infected by T cell line (T)-tropic HIV. 
Our findings provide evidence for the presence of a non-CXCR4 SDF-1 receptor on 
DC that is used mainly by T-tropic strains of HIV. DC from individuals 
homozygous for a 32-bp deletion of the CCR5 gene are also infectable with 
M-tropic strains of HIV-1, and this infection is inhibited by stromal 
cell-derived factor (SDF)1, suggesting that this receptor can also be used by 
M-tropic HIV for entry. Delineation of the spectrum of coreceptor usage on DC 
may offer new approaches to interfere with the initiation and propagation of HIV 
infection.
