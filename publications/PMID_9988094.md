Grooming behavior in rodents has long been related to dopamine receptors in the 
brain. However, the relative contribution of dopamine D1-like receptors (D1 and 
D5) and D2-like receptors (D2, D3 and D4) in this behavior has not been 
established yet. Spontaneous novelty-induced grooming (as assessed with a 30-min 
sampling test) was reduced in knockout mice lacking the dopamine D1, receptor. 
Furthermore, the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of small quantities 
of oxytocin, prolactin or the adrenocorticotrophic hormone 1-24 fragment, 
ACTH-(1-24) was followed by a diminished level of novelty-induced excessive 
grooming. These neuropeptides caused a sustained increase in grooming level of 
control animals (wild type). Interestingly, the i.c.v. injection of 
beta-endorphin enhanced novelty-induced grooming to a level similar in control 
and knockout mice. The systemic administration of the dopamine D2 receptor 
antagonist, sulpiride did not suppress the residual grooming activity shown by 
animals injected with oxytocin, prolactin or ACTH-(1-24), and did not change the 
behavioral expression of those injected with beta-endorphin. In contrast, the 
systemic administration of the opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone, totally 
suppressed the residual grooming activity of oxytocin-, prolactin- or 
ACTH-(1-24)-injected mice and of those treated with beta-endorphin. In contrast 
with the behavioral deficit observed in dopamine D1 receptor-deficient mice, 
dopamine D2 receptor-null animals showed a normal expression of spontaneous 
novelty-induced grooming and a high level of grooming activity induced by i.c.v. 
injection of oxytocin, prolactin, ACTH-(1-24) or beta-endorphin. Again, the 
peripheral injection of naloxone was followed by a suppression of 
neuropeptide-induced excessive grooming in these animals. These data suggest 
that dopamine D1 receptors are involved in the expression of novelty-induced 
grooming in mice. In contrast, dopamine D2 receptors seem not to be important 
for the expression of this behavior. Furthermore, neuropeptide-enhanced grooming 
involves dopamine D1, but not dopamine D2 receptors. However, neurotransmitters 
other than dopamine (e.g., endorphins) may play a supplementary role in 
neuropeptide-enhanced grooming in mice.
