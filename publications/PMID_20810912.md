Hypoxia is commonly assigned a role in the placental dysfunction characteristic 
of preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. We previously showed that 
hypoxia upregulates p53 and enhances apoptosis in primary cultures of human 
cytotrophoblasts. Here we tested the hypothesis that hypoxia also induces 
apoptosis in syncytiotrophoblasts by upregulation of p53. Primary cultures of 
human cytotrophoblasts that had differentiated into syncytiotrophoblasts by 52 h 
were exposed for ≤24 h to 20% or <1% oxygen in the presence or absence of 
staurosporine or the p53 modulators nutlin-3, pifithrin-α, and pifithrin-μ. 
Proteins were detected by Western blot analysis or immunofluorescence. Compared 
with 20% oxygen, exposure of syncytiotrophoblasts to <1% oxygen upregulated 
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and rapidly downregulated p53. Activity of p53 
in hypoxic syncytiotrophoblasts was reduced by the higher expression of the 
negative p53 regulator MDMX and by the reduction of phosphorylation of p53 at 
Ser(392), which reduces p53 activity. Conversely, staurosporine, a kinase 
inhibitor, and nutlin-3, a drug that enhances p53 expression, both raised p53 
levels and increased the rate of apoptosis in syncytiotrophoblasts compared with 
vehicle controls. Immunofluorescence staining showed p53 immunolocalized to both 
cytoplasm and nuclei of nutlin-3-exposed syncytiotrophoblasts. The 
hypoxia-induced apoptosis in syncytiotrophoblasts correlated with enhanced 
expression of the proapoptotic BAD and a reduced level of antiapoptotic BAD 
phosphorylated on Ser(112). We surmise that cell death induced by extreme 
hypoxia in syncytiotrophoblasts follows a non-p53-dependent pathway, unlike that 
of a nonhypoxic stimulus and unlike hypoxic cytotrophoblasts. We speculate that 
downregulation of p53 activity in response to hypoxia reduces or eliminates the 
apoptosis transduced by the p53 pathway in syncytiotrophoblasts, thereby 
limiting cell death and maintaining the integrity of this critical villous 
component.

Abstract

Hypoxia is commonly assigned a role in the placental dysfunction characteristic of preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. We previously showed that hypoxia upregulates p53 and enhances apoptosis in primary cultures of human cytotrophoblasts. Here we tested the hypothesis that hypoxia also induces apoptosis in syncytiotrophoblasts by upregulation of p53. Primary cultures of human cytotrophoblasts that had differentiated into syncytiotrophoblasts by 52 h were exposed for ≤24 h to 20% or <1% oxygen in the presence or absence of staurosporine or the p53 modulators nutlin-3, pifithrin-α, and pifithrin-μ. Proteins were detected by Western blot analysis or immunofluorescence. Compared with 20% oxygen, exposure of syncytiotrophoblasts to <1% oxygen upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and rapidly downregulated p53. Activity of p53 in hypoxic syncytiotrophoblasts was reduced by the higher expression of the negative p53 regulator MDMX and by the reduction of phosphorylation of p53 at Ser 392 , which reduces p53 activity. Conversely, staurosporine, a kinase inhibitor, and nutlin-3, a drug that enhances p53 expression, both raised p53 levels and increased the rate of apoptosis in syncytiotrophoblasts compared with vehicle controls. Immunofluorescence staining showed p53 immunolocalized to both cytoplasm and nuclei of nutlin-3-exposed syncytiotrophoblasts. The hypoxia-induced apoptosis in syncytiotrophoblasts correlated with enhanced expression of the proapoptotic BAD and a reduced level of antiapoptotic BAD phosphorylated on Ser 112 . We surmise that cell death induced by extreme hypoxia in syncytiotrophoblasts follows a non-p53-dependent pathway, unlike that of a nonhypoxic stimulus and unlike hypoxic cytotrophoblasts. We speculate that downregulation of p53 activity in response to hypoxia reduces or eliminates the apoptosis transduced by the p53 pathway in syncytiotrophoblasts, thereby limiting cell death and maintaining the integrity of this critical villous component.

DISCUSSION

The data show that hypoxia increases expression of HIF-1α, induces apoptosis, but reduces p53 expression and activity in cultures of human syncytiotrophoblasts compared with standard culture conditions of 20% oxygen. This contrasts with the rapid induction of p53 in hypoxic cytotrophoblasts ( 3 , 25 ) to indicate that there is a phenotype-dependent response of p53 in villous trophoblasts exposed to hypoxia. p53 activity is reduced by enhanced MDMX expression as a negative regulator for p53 and by the limited phosphorylation of p53 at Ser 392 , a site important for p53 transcriptional activity. Conversely, staurosporine as a nonhypoxic stimulus and nutlin as a drug that causes overexpression of p53 each enhance p53 activity to induce apoptosis in syncytiotrophoblasts. p53 immunolocalizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus under the influence of nutlin-3, implicating transcriptional and nontranscriptional functions for p53 in syncytiotrophoblasts. The data indicate that hypoxia-induced apoptosis is not primarily the result of p53 transcriptional activity but instead correlates with the proapoptotic expression of BAD and the proapoptotic isoform of BAD with limited phosphorylation at Ser 112 . We speculate that downregulation of p53 activity in response to hypoxia reduces or eliminates the apoptosis transduced by the p53 pathway in syncytiotrophoblasts and thereby limits injury and maintains the integrity of this critical villous component.

Hypoxia in the fetal circulation of pregnancies with severe IUGR in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy may be severe, with P o 2 levels of 10–20 mmHg ( 39 ). This contrasts with the normal P o 2 of average-growth babies, with a P o 2 in the 40–80 mmHg range ( 32 ). The low P o 2 in IUGR are likely to reveal the extremes of responses of the villous trophoblast to hypoxia. We chose to study the effects of standard culture conditions of 20% oxygen and ≤1% oxygen with theoretical P o 2 values of 150 mmHg and <15 mmHg, respectively. Notably, because of cellular oxygen consumption and low diffusion of oxygen through the medium, the measured pericellular P o 2 is between 78 and 110 mmHg in a variety of cell types when cultured in a 20% oxygen environment ( 29 , 33 ).

p53 is expressed in both cytotrophoblast nuclei and cytoplasm of the invasive trophoblasts of the first-trimester placenta ( 6 ) and in nuclei of the villous cytotrophoblasts at term ( 11 ). Syncytiotrophoblast in normal term villi prominently expresses MDM2 but only a low level of p53 ( 11 ). Importantly, apoptosis is higher and p53 is upregulated in villi from placentas with IUGR ( 26 ). Notably, syncytiotrophoblasts in culture are more resistant to apoptotic stimuli compared with primary cytotrophoblasts ( 8 , 19 ). Our data on reduced p53 expression in hypoxic syncytiotrophoblasts offer one pathway for this greater resistance to cell death. What remains unknown is whether the downregulation of p53 activity affects trophoblast resistance directly by limiting p53 transduction of apoptosis or indirectly by p53 effects on metabolism. For example, inhibition of p53 limits oxidative phosphorylation, and this p53 response may indirectly guide metabolism toward glycolysis, which may protect the trophoblast layer in the presence of low P o 2 ( 45 ).

We postulated that the enhanced apoptosis in syncytiotrophoblasts exposed to hypoxia was the result of transcriptional effects by p53 to enhance expression of proapoptotic genes, such as puma and noxa . However, as the mRNA levels of both of these genes were unchanged or slightly reduced, respectively, increased transcription of these genes could not account for the increased apoptosis in hypoxic syncytiotrophoblasts. Real-time PCR indicated that p53 and mdm2 mRNA levels were unchanged by hypoxia, a finding that is not surprising since regulated protein degradation is most crucial in determining the levels of these proteins in cells. As we found in hypoxic cytotrophoblasts ( 3 ), Ndrg1 mRNA was increased in hypoxic syncytiotrophoblasts, likely reflecting a protective function for NDRG, as we proposed previously ( 3 ). We also found that HIF-1α was upregulated in the syncytiotrophoblasts under hypoxic conditions, as expected. HIF-1α expression inversely correlates with p53 status ( 37 ), possibly due to competition for p300 ( 34 ).

Posttranslational modifications alter the stability of p53, the MDM2-p53 interaction, or both, resulting in altered p53 activity. MDMX is a key negative regulator of p53 ( 28 ). The increased expression of MDMX in hypoxic syncytiotrophoblasts limits p53 activity, compared with syncytiotrophoblasts exposed to 20% oxygen. Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser 392 increases the transcriptional activity of p53, and this phosphorylation is reduced in hypoxic syncytiotrophoblasts compared with cultures in 20% oxygen. Collectively, the data show that a combination of reduced p53 expression and activity limits the effects of p53 in apoptosis in hypoxic syncytiotrophoblasts.

Our data also show that the p53 pathway can be activated in syncytiotrophoblasts. Nutlin-3 is a nongenotoxic agent that elevates p53 expression by direct inhibition of p53 interaction with MDM2. Nutlin-3 enhances p53 expression in trophoblasts, and this overexpression allowed us to localize p53 to nuclei and to punctate cytoplasmic structures, consistent with mitochondria. The reagents pifithrin-α and pifithrin-μ are proposed to be antiapoptotic agents that selectively inhibit p53 activity. Our data indicate that they are not selective p53 inhibitors in syncytiotrophoblasts, and other cultured cells have varied responses to these agents ( 41 , 42 , 50 ). This may result from inadequate p53 inhibition or from the non-p53 actions recently reported in cultures treated with pifithrins ( 22 , 40 ). We conclude that pifithrins are not adequate inhibitors for p53 in cultured trophoblasts when used at nontoxic levels.

Although Bcl-2 family members are important regulators of apoptosis, the function of the Bcl-2 family in placental physiological and pathological conditions is still poorly understood. Bax, Bak, and Mcl-1S levels are increased in preeclampsia placental tissues or placenta explants in hypoxia-reoxygenation conditions, while Bcl-2 levels are unchanged ( 38 ).

Importantly, we here identify that the proapoptotic protein BAD is increased in hypoxic syncytiotrophoblasts. This contrasts with the lack of change in expression of BAD in hypoxic cytotrophoblasts ( 15 ), again underscoring the phenotype-dependent response of villous trophoblasts to hypoxia. Enhanced apoptosis in hypoxic cytotrophoblasts correlates with reduced phosphorylation of BAD-Ser 112 . Interestingly, the prosurvival effects of epidermal growth factor are mediated in part by enhanced phosphorylation of BAD-Ser 112 in hypoxic cytotrophoblasts ( 15 ). The minimal phosphorylation of the BAD Ser 112 site in hypoxic syncytiotrophoblasts further enhances the death-inducing effects of overexpression of this BH3-only Bcl-2 family member.

In conclusion, we have shown that enhanced MDMX expression level and the reduced phosphorylation of the Ser 392 residue on p53 combine to limit p53 activity in hypoxic syncytiotrophoblasts, despite enhanced apoptosis. We correlate enhanced expression of BAD as a central proapoptotic mediator in the higher than control cell death in syncytiotrophoblasts exposed to low oxygen. We speculate that rapid downregulation of p53 activity in syncytiotrophoblasts is one survival response to protect the integrity of the villous syncytiotrophoblast layer exposed to low P o 2 during pregnancy.
