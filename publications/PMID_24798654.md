It has been reported that the effect of inflammatory cytokines on β-cell 
destruction in type 1 diabetes is concentration-dependent. However, the 
underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we found that a high 
concentration of cytokines promoted apoptosis in the rat β-cell line INS-1, 
whereas a low concentration of cytokines had no effect. We also found that 
cytokines at a low concentration stimulated neutral ceramidase (NCDase) release 
via exosomes from INS-1 cells, whereas cytokines at a high concentration 
inhibited NCDase release. Furthermore, the results showed that the 
NCDase-containing exosomes isolated from the culture medium of INS-1 cells 
treated with cytokines at a low concentration inhibited apoptosis induced by a 
high concentration of cytokines. Finally, the results also showed that the 
protective action of NCDase in the exosomes on apoptosis was mediated by the 
generation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and its interaction with S1P 
receptor 2. Taken together, these findings revealed a novel 
NCDase-S1P-phosphate-S1P receptor 2-dependent mechanism by which a low level of 
inflammatory cytokines protects pancreatic β-cells from apoptosis induced by a 
high level of inflammatory cytokines.
