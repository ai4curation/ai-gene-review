DNA replication, repair, transcription and chromatin structure are intricately 
associated nuclear processes, but the molecular links between these events are 
often obscure. In this study, we have surveyed the protein complexes that bind 
at β-globin locus control region, and purified and characterized the function of 
one such multiprotein complex from human erythroleukemic K562 cells. We further 
validated the existence of this complex in human CD34+ cell-derived normal 
erythroid cells. This complex contains ILF2/ILF3 transcription factors, p300 
acetyltransferase and proteins associated with DNA replication, transcription 
and repair. RNAi knockdown of ILF2, a DNA-binding component of this complex, 
abrogates the recruitment of the complex to its cognate DNA sequence and 
inhibits transcription, histone acetylation and usage of the origin of DNA 
replication at the β-globin locus. These results imply a direct link between 
mammalian DNA replication, transcription and histone acetylation mediated by a 
single multiprotein complex.
