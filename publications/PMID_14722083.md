Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II) is a ubiquitous 
Ser/Thr-directed protein kinase that is expressed from a family of four genes 
(alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) in mammalian cells. We have documented the 
three-dimensional structures and the biophysical and enzymatic properties of the 
four gene products. Biophysical analyses showed that each isoform assembles into 
oligomeric forms and their three-dimensional structures at 21-25 A revealed that 
all four isoforms were dodecamers with similar but highly unusual architecture. 
A gear-shaped core comprising the association domain has the catalytic domains 
tethered on appendages, six of which extend from both ends of the core. At this 
level of resolution, we can discern no isoform-dependent differences in 
ultrastructure of the holoenzymes. Enzymatic analyses showed that the isoforms 
were similar in their K(m) for ATP and the peptide substrate syntide, but showed 
significant differences in their interactions with Ca(2+)-calmodulin as assessed 
by binding, substrate phosphorylation, and autophosphorylation. Interestingly, 
the rank order of CaM binding affinity (gamma > beta > delta > alpha) does not 
directly correlate with the rank order of their CaM dependence for 
autophosphorylation (beta > gamma > delta > alpha). Simulations utilizing this 
data revealed that the measured differences in CaM binding affinities play a 
minor role in the autophosphorylation of the enzyme, which is largely dictated 
by the rate of autophosphorylation for each isoform.
