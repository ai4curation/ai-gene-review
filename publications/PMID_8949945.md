The proto-oncogene bcl-2 can rescue cells from apoptosis and necrosis and its 
mechanism of action may involve antioxidant activity. The possible involvement 
of free radicals necrotic cell death induced by the neuroleptic drug haloperidol 
has led us to investigate the potential protective effect of Bcl-2 against 
haloperidol toxicity. We found that clonal mouse hippocampal cells stably 
transfected with the antioxidant Bcl-2 are protected against haloperidol 
toxicity. This data strongly supports the causative involvement of free radicals 
in haloperidol toxicity.
