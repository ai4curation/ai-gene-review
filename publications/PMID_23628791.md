The extra-pyramidal symptoms associated with manganism often overlap with that 
seen in Parkinsonism suggesting a common link between the two disorders. Since 
wide deviations are observed in susceptibility and characteristics of the 
symptoms observed in manganism, these differences may be due to underlying 
genetic variability. Genes linked to early onset of Parkinsonism which includes 
ATP13A2 and parkin have already been suggested to promote development of Mn 
toxicity. Of the other Parkinson-linked genes, mutations in LRRK2, an autosomal 
dominant gene, represent another likely candidate involved in the development of 
manganism. In this paper the effect of shRNA LRRK2 knock-down on Mn toxicity was 
examined in control and DAT transfected HEK293 cells. Results demonstrate that 
LRRK2 down-regulation potentiates Mn toxicity in both control and 
DAT-transfected cell as well as potentiates DA toxicity. Combined treatment of 
Mn and DA further augments cell toxicity, ROS production and JNK phosphorylation 
in LRRK2 deficient cells compared to controls. Consistent with studies 
demonstrating that LRRK2 plays a role in the phosphorylation of p38, our results 
similarly demonstrate a decrease in p38 activation in LRRK2 knock-down cells. 
Our findings suggest that null mutations in LRRK2 which cause Parkinsonism 
potentiate Mn toxicity and increase susceptibility to develop manganism.
