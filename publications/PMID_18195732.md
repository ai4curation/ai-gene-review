Cyclin B1 is a key regulatory protein controlling cell cycle progression in 
vertebrates. Cyclin B1 binds CDK1, a cyclin-dependent kinase catalytic subunit, 
forming a complex that orchestrates mitosis through phosphorylation of key 
proteins. Cyclin B1 regulates both the activation of CDK1 and its subcellular 
localization, which may be critical for substrate selection. Here, we 
demonstrate that cyclin B1 is concentrated on the outer plate of the kinetochore 
during prometaphase. This localization requires the cyclin box region of the 
protein. Cyclin B1 is displaced from individual kinetochores to the spindle 
poles by microtubule attachment to the kinetochores, and this displacement is 
dependent on the dynein/dynactin complex. Depletion of cyclin B1 by vector-based 
siRNA causes inefficient attachment between kinetochores and microtubules, and 
chromosome alignment defects, and delays the onset of anaphase. We conclude that 
cyclin B1 accumulates at kinetochores during prometaphase, where it contributes 
to the correct attachment of microtubules to kinetochores and efficient 
alignment of the chromosomes, most likely through localized phosphorylation of 
specific substrates by cyclin B1-CDK1. Cyclin B1 is then transported from each 
kinetochore as microtubule attachment is completed, and this relocalization may 
redirect the activity of cyclin B1-CDK1 and contribute to inactivation of the 
spindle assembly checkpoint.
