Selenoprotein K (SelK) is a newly identified selenoprotein. We showed that 
selenium incorporation into SelK was dependent on the 3'UTR of SelK mRNA. Sec 
insertion sequence (SECIS) RNA binding assays demonstrated that human SBP2 bound 
to the SelK SECIS element through the conserved non-Watson-Crick base pair 
quartet but not the AAT motif. Examination of the expression pattern revealed 
that human SelK mRNA was highly expressed in heart. Immunofluorescence analysis 
showed that SelK localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Using SelK recombinant 
adenovirus, we found that overexpression of SelK attenuated the intracellular 
reactive oxygen species level and protected cells from oxidative stress-induced 
toxicity in cardiomyocytes. Our findings indicated that SelK is a novel 
antioxidant in cardiomyocytes and is related to the regulation of cellular redox 
balance.
