We recently reported that Drosophila Insensitive (Insv) promotes sensory organ 
development and has activity as a nuclear corepressor for the Notch 
transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)]. Insv lacks domains of known 
biochemical function but contains a single BEN domain (i.e., a "BEN-solo" 
protein). Our chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (ChIP-seq) 
analysis confirmed binding of Insensitive to Su(H) target genes in the Enhancer 
of split gene complex [E(spl)-C]; however, de novo motif analysis revealed a 
novel site strongly enriched in Insv peaks (TCYAATHRGAA). We validate binding of 
endogenous Insv to genomic regions bearing such sites, whose associated genes 
are enriched for neural functions and are functionally repressed by Insv. 
Unexpectedly, we found that the Insv BEN domain binds specifically to this 
sequence motif and that Insv directly regulates transcription via this motif. We 
determined the crystal structure of the BEN-DNA target complex, revealing 
homodimeric binding of the BEN domain and extensive nucleotide contacts via α 
helices and a C-terminal loop. Point mutations in key DNA-contacting residues 
severely impair DNA binding in vitro and capacity for transcriptional regulation 
in vivo. We further demonstrate DNA-binding and repression activities by the 
mammalian neural BEN-solo protein BEND5. Altogether, we define novel DNA-binding 
activity in a conserved family of transcriptional repressors, opening a 
molecular window on this extensive gene family.
