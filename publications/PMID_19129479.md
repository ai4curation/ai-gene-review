The newly described yeast endosomal sorting complexes required for transport 
(ESCRT) protein increased sodium tolerance-1 (Ist1p) binds the late-acting ESCRT 
proteins Did2p/charged MVB protein (CHMP) 1 and Vps4p and exhibits synthetic 
vacuolar protein sorting defects when combined with mutations in the 
Vta1p/LIP5-Vps60p/CHMP5 complex. Here, we report that human IST1 also functions 
in the ESCRT pathway and is required for efficient abscission during HeLa cell 
cytokinesis. IST1 binding interactions with VPS4, CHMP1, LIP5, and ESCRT-I were 
characterized, and the IST1-VPS4 interaction was investigated in detail. 
Mutational and NMR spectroscopic studies revealed that the IST1 terminus 
contains two distinct MIT interacting motifs (MIM1 and MIM2) that wrap around 
and bind in different groves of the MIT helical bundle. IST1, CHMP1, and VPS4 
were recruited to the midbodies of dividing cells, and depleting either IST1 or 
CHMP1 proteins blocked VPS4 recruitment and abscission. In contrast, IST1 
depletion did not inhibit human immunodeficiency virus-1 budding. Thus, IST1 and 
CHMP1 act together to recruit and modulate specific VPS4 activities required 
during the final stages of cell division.

Abstract

The newly described yeast endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) protein i ncreased s odium t olerance-1 (Ist1p) binds the late-acting ESCRT proteins Did2p/charged MVB protein (CHMP) 1 and Vps4p and exhibits synthetic vacuolar protein sorting defects when combined with mutations in the Vta1p/LIP5–Vps60p/CHMP5 complex. Here, we report that human IST1 also functions in the ESCRT pathway and is required for efficient abscission during HeLa cell cytokinesis. IST1 binding interactions with VPS4, CHMP1, LIP5, and ESCRT-I were characterized, and the IST1–VPS4 interaction was investigated in detail. Mutational and NMR spectroscopic studies revealed that the IST1 terminus contains two distinct MIT interacting motifs (MIM1 and MIM2) that wrap around and bind in different groves of the MIT helical bundle. IST1, CHMP1, and VPS4 were recruited to the midbodies of dividing cells, and depleting either IST1 or CHMP1 proteins blocked VPS4 recruitment and abscission. In contrast, IST1 depletion did not inhibit human immunodeficiency virus-1 budding. Thus, IST1 and CHMP1 act together to recruit and modulate specific VPS4 activities required during the final stages of cell division.

INTRODUCTION

The human endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway functions in the terminal stages of cytokinesis ( Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007 ), enveloped virus budding ( Bieniasz, 2006 ; Fujii et al. , 2007 ), and intralumenal vesicle formation at the multivesicular body (MVB) ( Hurley and Emr, 2006 ; Gill et al. , 2007 ; Nickerson et al. , 2007 ). Although mechanistic details are lacking, all three of these processes terminate with the severing of thin, cytoplasm-filled membrane “necks,” suggesting that the ESCRT pathway may provide the terminal membrane fission activity. Most ESCRT pathway components function as subunits of a series of multiprotein complexes, termed ESCRT-0, -I, -II, and -III, which assemble into membrane-associated protein networks at sites of action. The VPS4 ATPase also functions late in the ESCRT pathway, where it can act in concert with the adaptor/activator protein Vta1p/LIP5 to release the assembled ESCRT machinery from the membrane. There is mounting evidence that the ESCRT-III and VPS4 complexes may work together to mediate key aspects of membrane deformation and fission (e.g., Hanson et al. , 2008 ), and these complexes have therefore become a focus of interest in the ESCRT pathway.

Yeast express four essential “core” ESCRT-III proteins: Vps32p/Snf7p/charged MVB protein (CHMP)4, Vps20p/CHMP6, Vps2p/CHMP2, and Vps24p/CHMP3 (human protein names are in capital letters), as well as two “accessory” ESCRT-III-like proteins (Did2p/CHMP1 and Vps60/CHMP5) that seem to play regulatory roles ( Babst et al. , 2002 ). Although the ESCRT pathway is conserved across eukaryotes, the ESCRT-III subunits have diversified considerably in mammals, and humans express at least 11 different ESCRT-III-like proteins. These 11 proteins can be subdivided into six families (CHMP1–6) that correspond to the six yeast ESCRT-III–like proteins, as well as a seventh family (CHMP7) not present in yeast. At membrane sites of action, various ESCRT-III subunits associate into large copolymers that contain multiple copies of each ESCRT-III subunit ( Babst et al. , 2002 ). Deposition of ESCRT-III subunits is probably associated with conformational changes that promote oligomerization, membrane binding, and cofactor recruitment ( Lin et al. , 2005 ; Muziol et al. , 2006 ; Zamborlini et al. , 2006 ; Shim et al. , 2007 ; Lata et al. , 2008 ). Clues to the functions of ESCRT-III complexes seem to be provided by the recent observation that overexpression of CHMP4 subunits induces the extrusion of thin membrane tubules that extend out from the plasma membrane ( Hanson et al. , 2008 ). The CHMP4 proteins form circular filaments that surround the bases and extend up into the tubules. Thus, these experiments suggest the possibility that authentic ESCRT-III lattices may consist of concentric rings or helices of ESCRT-III filaments that encircle the necks of extruding MVB vesicles and viral particles.

The assembled ESCRT-III lattice recruits VPS4 and other cofactors required for cargo deubiquitylation, vesicle fission, and release of the assembled ESCRT machinery. VPS4 is a type 1 AAA ATPase that assembles into a double-ringed complex with six ( Yu et al. , 2008 ) or seven ( Hartmann et al. , 2008 ) subunits per ring. The Vta1p/LIP5 cofactor stimulates subunit assembly and ATPase activity by contacting the VPS4 β domains and forming a supercomplex of ∼12 Vps4p:6 Vta1p ( Scott et al. , 2005a ; Azmi et al. , 2006 ; Lottridge et al. , 2006 ; Xiao et al. , 2008 ; Yu et al. , 2008 ). This supercomplex binds the ESCRT-III lattice through a series of interactions with MIT domains on both Vta1p/LIP5 (2 MIT domains/subunit) and VPS4 (1 MIT domain/subunit) (reviewed in Hurley and Yang, 2008 ). MIT domains are three helix bundles that can bind ESCRT-III proteins and other partners through one of two distinct types of MIT interacting motifs. Type 1 MIT interacting motifs (MIM1) form amphipathic helices that bind in the groove between MIT helices 2 and 3 ( Obita et al. , 2007 ; Stuchell-Brereton et al. , 2007 ), whereas type 2 MIT interacting motifs (MIM2) are extended, proline-rich strands that bind in the groove between MIT helices 1 and 3 ( Kieffer et al. , 2008 ). Once the VPS4 complex is recruited and assembled, VPS4 uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to drive disassembly of the ESCRT-III lattice, and this activity may also be mechanistically coupled to vesicle extrusion, membrane fission, or both.

Very recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have led to the identification and characterization of a new ESCRT pathway member, i ncreased s odium t olerance-1 (Ist1p) ( Dimaano et al. , 2008 ; Rue et al. , 2008 ). Ist1p binds both Vps4p and the ESCRT-III–like protein Did2p/CHMP1 ( Krogan et al. , 2006 ; Dimaano et al. , 2008 ; Rue et al. , 2008 ). Did2p/CHMP1, in turn, can bind other ESCRT-III subunits, and Ist1p can therefore help connect the ESCRT-III and Vps4p ATPase complexes ( Nickerson et al. , 2006 ; Tsang et al. , 2006 ). Yeast cells lacking Ist1p exhibit only modest MVB cargo sorting defects, but these defects are synthetically enhanced in the absence of Vta1p/LIP5 or Vps60p/CHMP5, or in the presence of temperature-sensitive Vps4p mutants (but not in the absence of Did2p/CHMP1) ( Dimaano et al. , 2008 ; Rue et al. , 2008 ). These observations suggest that Ist1p and Did2p/CHMP1 form a complex that can regulate Vps4p activity and that this complex may either act in concert with the Vta1p/LIP5–Vps60p/CHMP5 complex or, alternatively, that the Ist1p-Did2p/CHMP1 and Vta1p/LIP5–Vps60p/CHMP5 complexes may perform redundant functions. Ist1p has clear mammalian homologues, and in this study we have examined the protein interactions and biological functions of human IST1, with the goal of identifying human ESCRT functions that require IST1.

DISCUSSION

Our experiments reveal that CHMP1 and IST1 form a complex that modulates a subset of VPS4 activities in mammalian cells. IST1 and CHMP1 bind one another, and both display C-terminal MIM elements that bind VPS4 MIT domains ( Stuchell-Brereton et al. , 2007 ; this work). Endogenous VPS4 and IST1 both localize to midbodies during cell division ( Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007 ; Morita et al. , 2007b ; this work), as do epitope-tagged CHMP1 proteins (Supplemental Figure S6; Morita et al. , 2007b ). Most importantly, depletion of either IST1 or CHMP1 proteins strongly inhibited HeLa cell division at the abscission stage. Together, these observations imply that CHMP1, IST1, and VPS4 bind one another and function together at the midbody during HeLa cell division, providing the first nonsynthetic cellular phenotypes for either IST1 or CHMP1 proteins. In contrast, IST1 depletion does not inhibit HIV-1 budding, demonstrating that some VPS4-dependent ESCRT pathway functions do not require IST1.

Our studies show that MIT domains from VPS4 and Vta1p/LIP5 (and possibly other proteins) bind MIM elements located at the C-terminal end of IST1. Detailed characterization of the VPS4A MIT–IST1 interaction revealed a novel binding mode in which IST1 MIM1 and MIM2 elements bind in adjacent grooves of the three helix bundle of VPS4A MIT. The two elements cooperate to increase the interaction affinity, and the measured dissociation constant ( K d = 1 μM) is nearly an order of magnitude tighter than the best “single-mode” MIM interactions characterized to date ( Obita et al. , 2007 ; Stuchell-Brereton et al. , 2007 ; Kieffer et al. , 2008 ). Moreover, the two IST1 MIM elements fill both binding grooves of the VPS4 MIT domain and should therefore competitively inhibit VPS4 binding to ESCRT-III proteins of both MIM classes.

We find that VPS4 proteins do not localize efficiently to midbodies in the absence of either IST1 or CHMP1 proteins. Thus, one important function of the IST1/CHMP1 complex is to recruit VPS4 proteins to midbodies. It is also likely that the IST1/CHMP1 complex helps regulate other VPS4 activities, although it is not yet clear precisely what IST1 does or how its activities relate to those of the other known VPS4 modulator, Vta1/LIP5 ( Scott et al. , 2005a ; Azmi et al. , 2006 ; Lottridge et al. , 2006 ; Dimaano et al. , 2008 ; Rue et al. , 2008 ; Xiao et al. , 2008 ; Yu et al. , 2008 ). It has been proposed that binary complexes of Did2p/CHMP1-IST1 and Vta1p/LIP5-Vps60p/CHMP5 may regulate VPS4 in functionally redundant manners, which could explain why strong MVB sorting phenotypes are only observed when yeast lack subunits of both complexes ( Rue et al. , 2008 ). This model can also rationalize why HIV-1 budding is reduced upon depletion of LIP5 but not IST1 ( Ward et al. , 2005 ; this work) because LIP5 could modulate VPS4 activities in HIV-1 budding, whereas IST1 could perform similar functions in cytokinesis. We note, however, that Vta1p/LIP5 and IST1 have very different biochemical properties, because they differ in domain structure and oligomeric state ( Xiao et al. , 2008 ), and they also bind VPS4 in different ways ( Scott et al. , 2005a ; Yu et al. , 2008 ; this work). Moreover, our experiments show that IST1 and LIP5 bind one another, suggesting that they may work together in some contexts. It is therefore alternatively possible that IST1 and Vta1p/LIP5 modulate distinct, but complementary VPS4 activities.

One interesting possibility is that Vta1p/LIP5 complexes may favor fully assembled and enzymatically active VPS4 state(s), whereas IST1 complexes favor state(s) in which the enzyme does not fully engage the ESCRT-III lattice. All available data indicate that Vta1p/LIP5 favors enzymatically active VPS4 states. Vta1p/LIP5 stimulates VPS4 assembly and ATPase activity in vitro ( Scott et al. , 2005a ; Azmi et al. , 2006 , 2008 ; Lottridge et al. , 2006 ; Xiao et al. , 2008 ; Yu et al. , 2008 ) and enhances substrate binding activity by contributing additional MIT domains that can bind multiple different ESCRT-III proteins ( Scott et al. , 2005a ; Azmi et al. , 2006 ; Lottridge et al. , 2006 ; Shim et al. , 2008 ; Xiao et al. , 2008 ; Yu et al. , 2008 ). In contrast, IST1 activities are less clear because the protein contributes positively to overall ESCRT pathway function ( Dimaano et al. , 2008 ; Rue et al. , 2008 ; this work), yet paradoxically inhibits several known VPS4 activities. As discussed above, tight binding of IST1 MIM elements to VPS4 MIT domains should competitively inhibit VPS4 binding to ESCRT-III substrates. Furthermore, pure recombinant Ist1p forms a 1:1 complex with Vps4p that inhibits higher order enzyme assembly and ATPase activity ( Dimaano et al. , 2008 ). Similarly, elevated IST1 levels dominantly inhibit ESCRT pathway activities in vivo, including HIV-1 release ( Figure 3 A) and MVB protein sorting ( Dimaano et al. , 2008 ).

Possible functions for the IST1-Did2/CHMP1 complex that would be consistent with our observations include helping to recruit VPS4 to specific sites of action ( Nickerson et al. , 2006 ; Dimaano et al. , 2008 ; Rue et al. , 2008 ; this work), helping to disrupt the inactive cytoplasmic VPS4 dimer ( Babst et al. , 1998 ; Scott et al. , 2005b ), helping VPS4 to engage the ESCRT-III lattice, and/or helping to release or weaken VPS4–substrate interactions, perhaps as VPS4 enzymes act processively on the ESCRT-III lattice or after the terminal membrane fission event. Thus, we speculate that the IST1/CHMP1 and LIP5/CHMP5 complexes may modulate distinct VPS4 activities during the full ESCRT cycle and that specific VPS4-dependent functions such as cytokinesis and virus budding are more or less dependent on these different activities. These issues will clearly require further study, and our demonstration that both IST1 and CHMP1 perform essential functions during abscission provides a tractable biological system for analyzing their activities.
