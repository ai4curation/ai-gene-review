Sirt1 is an NAD+-dependent deacetylase that plays a role in cellular processes 
such as transcriptional regulation, stress response, longevity and apoptosis. 
Sirt1 deacetylates histone proteins and certain transcription factors such as 
p53, CTIP2 (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor-interacting 
protein 2), FOXO (forkhead box O) and NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB). To 
identify potential Sirt1-interacting factors, we performed a yeast two-hybrid 
screen. The screen identified TLE1 (transducin-like enhancer of split-1) as a 
possible Sirt1-interacting factor, which was then confirmed by 
co-immunoprecipitation. TLE1 is a non-DNA binding co-repressor for several 
transcriptional factors including NF-kappaB. We have demonstrated using 
co-transfection assays that Sirt1 and TLE1 repress NF-kappaB activity. The 
catalytic mutant of Sirt1, Sirt1-H363Y, and the N-terminal Sirt1 fragment (amino 
acids 1-270) also show similar repression activity, suggesting that the 
deacetylase activity of Sirt1 may not be critical for its effect on NF-kappaB 
activity. Furthermore, analysis in Sirt1-null MEFs (murine embryonic 
fibroblasts) and HeLa cells stably expressing siRNA (small interfering RNA) 
specific to Sirt1 or TLE1 demonstrate that both Sirt1 and TLE1 are required for 
negative regulation of NF-kappaB activity. Taken together, these results suggest 
that the interaction between Sirt1 and TLE1 is important for mediating 
repression of NF-kappaB activity.
