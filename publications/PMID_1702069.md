Mouse preimplantation embryos were examined for the cell surface expression of 
epitopes that cross-react with antibodies to a 75-kDa subunit of a purified 
porcine renal brush border Na+/glucose cotransport system. A Na+ cotransport 
system is hypothesized to reside in the apical plasma membrane domain of mouse 
polar blastomeres and to be associated with the induction of their apical-basal 
polarity. Western blot analysis showed that unfertilized oocytes as well as 
preimplantation embryos contain a cross-reacting antigen with an apparent 
molecular weight of about 75,000. Embryos and their isolated blastomeres were 
double-labeled and assayed by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) for the 
expression of epitopes (visualized by labeling with rabbit antiserum or mouse 
monoclonal IgG to cotransporter followed by the appropriate rhodamine-conjugated 
second antibodies) and for the development of cell surface polarity (visualized 
by the apical restriction of fluoresceinated succinylated concanavalin A 
binding; FS Con A). IIF did not detect these epitopes until after the second 
cleavage when 4-cell embryos expressed low-to-moderate levels. Although epitopes 
were expressed on all surfaces of 4-cell blastomeres, some blastomeres expressed 
more epitopes on their apical surfaces than on their basolateral ones. All 
precompaction 8-cell embryos expressed epitopes, with expression being greater 
apically on some blastomeres. The level of expression appeared to reach a 
maximum on morulae and to decline on cavitating embryos. Assays performed on 
isolated blastomeres from postcompaction embryos showed that by the 16-cell 
stage epitope expression appeared to become restricted to FS Con A-labeled 
apical plasma membrane domains and was no longer evident on basolateral domains. 
This apparent apical restriction of epitope expression was confirmed by electron 
microscopic examination of immunogold-labeled isolated polar 16-cell 
blastomeres. These results demonstrate that preimplantation mouse embryos 
contain an antigen(s) that is immunologically and structurally similar to a 
75-kDa renal Na+/glucose cotransporter. The onset of cell surface expression of 
this antigen precedes development of the stable polar phenotype.
