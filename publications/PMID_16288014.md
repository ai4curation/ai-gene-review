Evidence is accumulating to suggest that some of the diverse functions 
associated with BRCA1 may relate to its ability to transcriptionally regulate 
key downstream target genes. Here, we identify S100A7 (psoriasin), S100A8, and 
S100A9, members of the S100A family of calcium-binding proteins, as novel 
BRCA1-repressed targets. We show that functional BRCA1 is required for 
repression of these family members and that a BRCA1 disease-associated mutation 
abrogates BRCA1-mediated repression of psoriasin. Furthermore, we show that 
BRCA1 and c-Myc form a complex on the psoriasin promoter and that BRCA1-mediated 
repression of psoriasin is dependent on functional c-Myc. Finally, we show that 
psoriasin expression is induced by the topoisomerase IIalpha poison, etoposide, 
in the absence of functional BRCA1 and increased psoriasin expression enhances 
cellular sensitivity to this chemotherapeutic agent. Therefore, we identified a 
novel transcriptional mechanism that is likely to contribute to BRCA1-mediated 
resistance to etoposide.
