The Ski family of nuclear oncoproteins represses transforming growth factor-beta 
(TGF-beta) signaling through inhibition of transcriptional activity of Smad 
proteins. In this study, we identified a novel gene, fussel-15 (functional smad 
suppressing element on chromosome 15) with high homology to the recently 
discovered Fussel-18 protein. Both, Fussel-15 and Fussel-18, share important 
structural features, significant homology and similar genomic organization with 
the homolog Ski family members, Ski and SnoN. Unlike Ski and SnoN, which are 
ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, Fussel-15 expression, like Fussel-18, 
is much more restricted in its expression and is principally found in the 
nervous system of mouse and humans. Interestingly, Fussel-15 expression is even 
more restricted in adulthood to Purkinje cells of human cerebellum. In contrast 
to Fussel-18 that interacts with Smad 2, Smad3 and Smad4 and has an inhibitory 
activity on TGF-beta signaling, Fussel-15 interacts with Smad1, Smad2 and Smad3 
molecules and suppresses mainly BMP signaling pathway but has only minor effects 
on TGF-beta signaling. This new protein expands the family of Ski/Sno 
proto-oncoproteins and represents a novel molecular regulator of BMP signaling.
