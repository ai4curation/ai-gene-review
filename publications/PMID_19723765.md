Yeast senses the availability of external energy sources via multiple 
interconnected signaling networks. One of the central components is SNF1, the 
homolog of mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase, which in yeast is essential 
for the expression of glucose-repressed genes. When glucose is available 
hyperphosphorylated SNF1 is rendered inactive by the type 1 protein phosphatase 
Glc7. Dephosphorylation requires Reg1, which physically targets Glc7 to SNF1. 
Here we show that the chaperone Ssb is required to keep SNF1 in the 
nonphosphorylated state in the presence of glucose. Using a proteome approach we 
found that the Deltassb1Deltassb2 strain displays alterations in protein 
expression and suffers from phenotypic characteristics reminiscent of glucose 
repression mutants. Microarray analysis revealed a correlation between 
deregulation on the protein and on the transcript level. Supporting studies 
uncovered that SSB1 was an effective multicopy suppressor of severe growth 
defects caused by the Deltareg1 mutation. Suppression of Deltareg1 by high 
levels of Ssb was coupled to a reduction of Snf1 hyperphosphorylation back to 
the wild-type phosphorylation level. The data are consistent with a model in 
which Ssb is crucial for efficient regulation within the SNF1 signaling network, 
thereby allowing an appropriate response to changing glucose levels.
