Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) act as membrane anchors of many eukaryotic 
cell surface proteins. GPIs in various organisms have a common backbone 
consisting of ethanolamine phosphate (EtNP), three mannoses (Mans), one 
non-N-acetylated glucosamine, and inositol phospholipid, whose structure is 
EtNP-6Manα-2Manα-6Manα-4GlNα-6myoinositol-P-lipid. The lipid part is either 
phosphatidylinositol of diacyl or 1-alkyl-2-acyl form, or inositol 
phosphoceramide. GPIs are attached to proteins via an amide bond between the 
C-terminal carboxyl group and an amino group of EtNP. Fatty chains of inositol 
phospholipids are inserted into the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. More 
than 150 different human proteins are GPI anchored, whose functions include 
enzymes, adhesion molecules, receptors, protease inhibitors, transcytotic 
transporters, and complement regulators. GPI modification imparts proteins with 
unique characteristics, such as association with membrane microdomains or rafts, 
transient homodimerization, release from the membrane by cleavage in the GPI 
moiety, and apical sorting in polarized cells. GPI anchoring is essential for 
mammalian embryogenesis, development, neurogenesis, fertilization, and immune 
system. Mutations in genes involved in remodeling of the GPI lipid moiety cause 
human diseases characterized by neurological abnormalities. Yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae has >60 GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). GPI is essential for growth 
of yeast. In this review, we discuss biosynthesis of GPI-APs in mammalian cells 
and yeast with emphasis on the lipid moiety.
