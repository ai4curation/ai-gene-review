PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation was to provide evidence for the 
expression of the cystine/glutamate transporter (x(c)(-)) in the human retinal 
pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19, clone the light chain of the transporter 
from an ARPE-19 cell cDNA library and study its function, and investigate the 
regulation of this transporter by nitric oxide (NO) in ARPE-19 cells.
METHODS: Uptake of radiolabeled cystine and glutamate was measured in ARPE-19 
cells. The functional identity of x(c)(-) in these cells was established by 
substrate specificity and Na(+)-independence of the uptake process. The human 
x(c)(-) light chain (human xCT) was cloned from an ARPE-19 cell cDNA library. 
The functional identity of the cloned human xCT was investigated by heterologous 
coexpression of the light chain with the heavy chain (human 4F2hc) in HeLa 
cells. ARPE-19 cells were treated with or without the NO donor 
3-nitroso-N:-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and the expression of x(c)(-) was 
studied at the functional and molecular levels.
RESULTS: ARPE-19 cells take up cystine as well as glutamate in the absence of 
Na(+). Substrate specificity studies indicate that although the uptake of 
cystine in the absence of Na(+) is mediated by multiple amino acid transport 
systems including x(c)(-), the uptake of glutamate in the absence of Na(+) 
occurs exclusively via x(c)(-). The human xCT cloned from ARPE-19 cells is a 
protein of 501 amino acids. These cells express the heavy chain 4F2hc as 
evidenced from RT-PCR analysis. Coexpression of human xCT with 4F2hc in HeLa 
cells leads to the induction of cystine and glutamate uptake with 
characteristics similar to that of x(c)(-). The activity of x(c)(-) in ARPE-19 
cells is upregulated by SNAP, and the process is associated with an increase in 
the expression of xCT with no detectable change in the expression of 4F2hc.
CONCLUSIONS: ARPE-19 cells express the cystine/glutamate transporter x(c)(-) 
(the light chain xCT and the heavy chain 4F2hc) as is evident from functional 
and molecular studies. NO upregulates this transport system and the process is 
associated with an increase in xCT mRNA but with no change in 4F2hc mRNA.
