Nucleophosmin (NPM) (B23) is an essential protein in mouse development and cell 
growth; however, it has been assigned numerous roles in very diverse cellular 
processes. Here, we present a unified mechanism for NPM's role in cell growth; 
NPM directs the nuclear export of both 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. NPM 
interacts with rRNA and large and small ribosomal subunit proteins and also 
colocalizes with large and small ribosomal subunit proteins in the nucleolus, 
nucleus, and cytoplasm. The transduction of NPM shuttling-defective mutants or 
the loss of Npm1 inhibited the nuclear export of both the 40S and 60S ribosomal 
subunits, reduced the available pool of cytoplasmic polysomes, and diminished 
overall protein synthesis without affecting rRNA processing or ribosome 
assembly. While the inhibition of NPM shuttling can block cellular 
proliferation, the dramatic effects on ribosome export occur prior to cell cycle 
inhibition. Modest increases in NPM expression amplified the export of newly 
synthesized rRNAs, resulting in increased rates of protein synthesis and 
indicating that NPM is rate limiting in this pathway. These results support the 
idea that NPM-regulated ribosome export is a fundamental process in cell growth.
