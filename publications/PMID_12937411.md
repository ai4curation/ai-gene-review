DNA-adenine methylation at certain GATC sites plays a pivotal role in bacterial 
and phage gene expression as well as bacterial virulence. We report here the 
crystal structures of the bacteriophage T4Dam DNA adenine methyltransferase 
(MTase) in a binary complex with the methyl-donor product 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) and in a ternary complex with a synthetic 
12-bp DNA duplex and AdoHcy. T4Dam contains two domains: a seven-stranded 
catalytic domain that harbors the binding site for AdoHcy and a DNA binding 
domain consisting of a five-helix bundle and a beta-hairpin that is conserved in 
the family of GATC-related MTase orthologs. Unexpectedly, the sequence-specific 
T4Dam bound to DNA in a nonspecific mode that contained two Dam monomers per 
synthetic duplex, even though the DNA contains a single GATC site. The ternary 
structure provides a rare snapshot of an enzyme poised for linear diffusion 
along the DNA.
