We have developed a protocol for the identification of aberrant chromosome 
behavior during human male meiosis up to metaphase of the secondary 
spermatocyte. Histological evaluation by the Johnsen score of a testicular 
biopsy was combined with immunofluorescence of first meiotic prophase 
spermatocytes, using antibodies against synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SYCP3) 
and the product of the ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related gene (ATR). This 
combination enables accurate meiotic prophase substaging and the identification 
of pachytene spermatocytes with asynapsis. Furthermore, we also investigated the 
competence of late pachytene primary spermatocytes to complete the first meiotic 
division up to metaphase and of secondary spermatocytes to transform into 
metaphase by an in vitro challenge with okadaic acid (OA). We tested this 
protocol on five males with normal Johnsen scores that presented with 
obstructive azoospermia, five males with low Johnsen scores and non-obstructive 
azoospermia and six vasectomized control males of proven fertility and normal 
Johnsen scores. In all azoospermics, the profiling of meiotic prophase stages by 
immunofluorescence increases the resolving power of the Johnsen score. In both 
obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermic patients, relatively more leptotene 
meiotic prophase stages were counted compared to the controls. In 
non-obstructive azoospermics, a marked heterogeneity in spermatogenesis was 
found, after combining the results of all three approaches, pointing at 
functional mosaicism of the germinal epithelium. Asynaptic pachytene 
spermatocytes were rarely encountered. Also, when first meiotic metaphase could 
be induced by OA, chiasma counts were normal. In none of the non-obstructive 
azoospermic males did the pattern of spermatogenesis resemble that of knock-out 
mouse azoospermics. We conclude that this combined histological and cytological 
approach enables a detailed phenotypic classification of infertile males, at a 
level comparable to that applied for male-sterile knock-out mice with a meiotic 
defect. This may facilitate the identification of candidate genes for human male 
infertility.
