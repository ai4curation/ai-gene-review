Signal transduction by the NF-kappaB pathway is a key regulator of a host of 
cellular responses to extracellular and intracellular messages. The NEMO adaptor 
protein lies at the top of this pathway and serves as a molecular conduit, 
connecting signals transmitted from upstream sensors to the downstream NF-kappaB 
transcription factor and subsequent gene activation. The position of NEMO within 
this pathway makes it an attractive target from which to search for new proteins 
that link NF-kappaB signaling to additional pathways and upstream effectors. In 
this work, we have used protein microarrays to identify novel NEMO interactors. 
A total of 112 protein interactors were identified, with the most statistically 
significant hit being the canonical NEMO interactor IKKbeta, with IKKalpha also 
being identified. Of the novel interactors, more than 30% were kinases, while at 
least 25% were involved in signal transduction. Binding of NEMO to several 
interactors, including CALB1, CDK2, SAG, SENP2 and SYT1, was confirmed using GST 
pulldown assays and coimmunoprecipitation, validating the initial screening 
approach. Overexpression of CALB1, CDK2 and SAG was found to stimulate 
transcriptional activation by NF-kappaB, while SYT1 overexpression repressed 
TNFalpha-dependent NF-kappaB transcriptional activation in human embryonic 
kidney cells. Corresponding with this finding, RNA silencing of CDK2, SAG and 
SENP2 reduced NF-kappaB transcriptional activation, supporting a positive role 
for these proteins in the NF-kappaB pathway. The identification of a host of new 
NEMO interactors opens up new research opportunities to improve understanding of 
this essential cell signaling pathway.
