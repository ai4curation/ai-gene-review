The mitosis-meiosis switch is a key event in the differentiation of germ cells. 
In humans, meiosis is initiated in fetal ovaries, whereas in testes meiotic 
entry is inhibited until puberty. The purpose of this study was to examine the 
expression pattern of meiosis regulators in human gonads and to investigate a 
possible role of DMRT1 in the regulation of meiotic entry. The expression 
pattern of DMRT1, STRA8, SCP3, DMC1, NANOS3, CYP26B1 and NANOS2 was investigated 
by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in a series of human testis samples from 
fetal life to adulthood, and in fetal ovaries. DMRT1 was expressed in testes 
throughout development but with marked spatio-temporal changes. At the early 
fetal period of 8-20 gestational weeks (GW) and at infantile mini-puberty, DMRT1 
was predominantly expressed in Sertoli cells, whereas at later stages of 
gestation (22-40 GW), during childhood and in post-pubertal testes, DMRT1 was 
most abundant in spermatogonia, except in the A-dark type. In fetal ovaries, 
DMRT1 was detected in oogonia and oocytes until 20 GW, but was completely 
down-regulated following meiotic entry. STRA8, SCP3 and DMC1 were expressed 
mainly in oocytes and spermatogonia in accordance with their role in initiation 
and progression of meiosis. The putative meiosis inhibitors, CYP26B1 and NANOS2, 
were primarily expressed in Leydig cells and spermatocytes, respectively. In 
conclusion, the expression pattern of the investigated meiotic regulators is 
largely conserved in the human gonads compared with rodents, but with some minor 
differences, such as a stable expression of CYP26B1 in human fetal ovaries. The 
sexually dimorphic expression pattern of DMRT1 indicates a similar role in the 
mitosis-meiosis switch in human gonads as previously demonstrated in mice. The 
biological importance of the changes in expression of DMRT1 in Sertoli cells 
remains to be established, but it is consistent with DMRT1 reinforcing the 
inhibition of meiosis in the testis.
