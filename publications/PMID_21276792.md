Exosomes represent an important intercellular communication vehicle, mediating 
events essential for the decidual microenvironment. While we have demonstrated 
exosome induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, to date, no extensive 
characterization of trophoblast-derived exosomes has been provided. Our 
objective was to provide a morphologic and proteomic characterization of these 
exosomes. Exosomes were isolated from the conditioned media of Swan71 human 
trophoblast cells by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation. These were 
analyzed for density (sucrose density gradient centrifugation), morphology 
(electron microscopy), size (dynamic light scattering) and protein composition 
(Ion Trap mass spectrometry and western immunoblotting). Based on density 
gradient centrifugation, microvesicles from Sw71 cells exhibit a density between 
1.134 and 1.173g/ml. Electron microscopy demonstrated that microvesicles from 
Sw71 cells exhibit the characteristic cup-shaped morphology of exosomes. Dynamic 
light scattering showed a bell-shaped curve, indicating a homogeneous population 
with a mean size of 165nm ± 0.5nm. Ion Trap mass spectrometry demonstrated the 
presence of exosome marker proteins (including CD81, Alix, cytoskeleton related 
proteins, and Rab family). The MS results were confirmed by western 
immunoblotting. Based on morphology, density, size and protein composition, we 
defined the release of exosomes from extravillous trophoblast cells and provide 
their first extensive characterization. This characterization is essential in 
furthering our understanding of "normal" early pregnancy.
