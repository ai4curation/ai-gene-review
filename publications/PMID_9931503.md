We have cloned a human cDNA, SEMP1 (senescence-associated epithelial membrane 
protein 1), using differential display (DD) of mRNA. We compared mRNA expression 
profiles between cultured normal senescent human mammary epithelial cells 
(HMECs) and proliferating, early passage HMECs. From the amino acid sequence of 
the open reading frame (ORF) of the cDNA, we infer that the protein belongs to a 
family of membrane-associated, epithelial cell-specific proteins. The 
translation product has 91% identity to a mouse protein, claudin-1, a tight 
junction (TJ)-associated protein. SEMP1 mRNA is expressed in human tissues, 
including adult and fetal liver, pancreas, placenta, adrenals, prostate and 
ovary but at low or undetectable levels in a number of human breast cancer cell 
lines. SEMP1 is a member of a superfamily of epithelial membrane proteins 
(EMPs), which may have multiple potential functions, including maintenance and 
regulation of cell polarity and permeability, perhaps through mechanisms 
involving tight junctions.
