Exposure to high levels of manganese (Mn) results in a neurological condition 
termed manganism, which is characterized by oxidative stress, abnormal dopamine 
(DA) signaling, and cell death. Epidemiological evidence suggests correlations 
with occupational exposure to Mn and the development of the movement disorder 
Parkinson's disease (PD), yet the molecular determinants common between the 
diseases are ill-defined. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) of the class pi 
(GSTπ) are phase II detoxification enzymes that conjugate both endogenous and 
exogenous compounds to glutathione to reduce cellular oxidative stress, and 
their decreased expression has recently been implicated in PD progression. In 
this study we demonstrate that a Caenorhabditis elegans GSTπ homologue, GST-1, 
inhibits Mn-induced DA neuron degeneration. We show that GST-1 is expressed in 
DA neurons, Mn induces GST-1 gene and protein expression, and GST-1-mediated 
neuroprotection is dependent on the PD-associated transcription factor 
Nrf2/SKN-1, as a reduction in SKN-1 gene expression results in a decrease in 
GST-1 protein expression and an increase in DA neuronal death. Furthermore, 
decreases in gene expression of the SKN-1 inhibitor WDR-23 or the GSTπ-binding 
cell death activator JNK/JNK-1 result in an increase in resistance to the metal. 
Finally, we show that the Mn-induced DA neuron degeneration is independent of 
the dopamine transporter DAT, but is largely dependent on the caspases CED-3 and 
the novel caspase CSP-1. This study identifies a C. elegans Nrf2/SKN-1-dependent 
GSTπ homologue, cell death effectors of GSTπ-associated xenobiotic-induced 
pathology, and provides the first in vivo evidence that a phase II 
detoxification enzyme may modulate DA neuron vulnerability in manganism.
