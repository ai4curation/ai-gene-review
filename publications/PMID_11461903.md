SPA1 is a phytochrome A (phyA)-specific signaling intermediate that acts as a 
light-dependent repressor of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis seedlings. It 
contains a WD-repeat domain that shows high sequence similarity to the WD-repeat 
region of the constitutive repressor of light signaling, COP1. Here, using yeast 
two-hybrid and in vitro interaction assays, we show that SPA1 strongly and 
selectively binds to COP1. Domain mapping studies indicate that the putative 
coiled-coil domain of SPA1 is necessary and sufficient for binding to COP1. 
Conversely, similar deletion analyses of the COP1 protein suggest that SPA1 
interacts with the presumed coiled-coil domain of COP1. To further investigate 
SPA1 function in the phyA signaling pathway, we tested whether SPA1, like COP1, 
mediates changes in gene expression in response to light. We show that spa1 
mutations increase the photoresponsiveness of certain light-regulated genes 
within 2 h of light treatment. Taken together, the results suggest that SPA1 may 
function to link the phytochrome A-specific branch of the light signaling 
pathway to COP1. Hence, our data provide molecular support for the hypothesis 
that COP1 is a convergence point for upstream signaling pathways dedicated to 
individual photoreceptors.
