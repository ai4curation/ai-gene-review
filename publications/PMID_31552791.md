LRRK2 is a multi-domain Ser/Thr kinase that is associated with inherited and 
sporadic cases of Parkinson's disease. Many mutations linked to disease are 
associated within a central ROC-COR regulatory region and the subsequent kinase 
domain, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. The N-terminus of human LRRK2 
consists of armadillo repeat motifs (ARMs) followed by ankyrin repeats (ANKs). 
Recently, Rab GTPases have emerged as key players in LRRK2 function, both as 
substrates of the kinase, and as regulators of the catalytic activity. Rabs 
recruit effector proteins via their GTP-dependent switch 1 and 2 regions to 
distinct sub-cellular compartments to regulate membrane trafficking. LRRK2 
phosphorylates Rab8, Rab10 and Rab12 in switch 2, and this activity is regulated 
via interactions with Rab29. Furthermore, the related Rab32-subfamily GTPases, 
Rab32 and Rab38, have also been shown to interact with LRRK2. Here, we have 
mapped the interactions of the Rab32-subfamily to the ARM domain of LRRK2. The 
complexes are dependent on the GTP state of the Rabs in vitro, implying that 
LRRK2 may be an effector of the Rab32-subfamily of small GTPases. X-ray crystal 
structures of the Rab32-family GTPases and subsequent mutational studies reveal 
that a positively charged residue in switch 1 is critical for binding of 
Rab32/38 to LRRK2. Homology modelling and mutational analyses of the ARM domain 
point to a patch of negatively charged residues that contribute to complex 
formation. These structural and biochemical studies provide a framework for 
understanding the molecular basis for Rab regulation of LRRK2 and its role in 
Parkinson's disease.
