Cdc45p, a protein essential for initiation of DNA replication, associates with 
chromatin after "start" in late G1 and during the S phase of the cell cycle. 
Binding of Cdc45p to chromatin depends on Clb-Cdc28 kinase activity as well as 
functional Cdc6p and Mcm2p, which suggests that Cdc45p associates with the 
prereplication complex after activation of S-phase cyclin-dependent kinases 
(CDKs). As indicated by the timing and the CDK dependence, binding of Cdc45p to 
chromatin is crucial for commitment to initiation of DNA replication. During S 
phase, Cdc45p physically interacts with minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 
proteins on chromatin; however, dissociation of Cdc45p from chromatin is slower 
than that of MCMs, which indicates that the proteins are released by different 
mechanisms.
