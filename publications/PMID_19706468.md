Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) oligomers may be the proximate neurotoxins in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). "Oligomer" is an ill-defined term because many kinds 
have been reported and they often exist in rapid equilibrium with monomers and 
higher-order assemblies. We report here results of studies in which specific 
oligomers have been stabilized structurally, fractionated in pure form, and then 
studied by using a combination of CD spectroscopy, Thioflavin T fluorescence, 
EM, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and neurotoxicity assays. Abeta monomers were 
largely unstructured, but oligomers exhibited order-dependent increases in 
beta-sheet content. EM and AFM data suggest that dimerization and subsequent 
monomer addition are processes in which significant and asymmetric monomer 
conformational changes occur. Oligomer secondary structure and order correlated 
directly with fibril nucleation activity. Neurotoxic activity increased 
disproportionately (order dependence >1) with oligomer order. The 
structure-activity correlations reported here significantly extend our 
understanding of the conformational dynamics, structure, and relative toxicity 
of pure Abeta oligomers of specific order.
