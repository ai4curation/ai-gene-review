Mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis provides iron-sulfur 
cofactors to several mitochondrial proteins, but the extent to which ISC 
biogenesis regulates hematopoiesis has been unclear. The blood disease 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, 
and the disease overlaps with the gene Hspa9/Mortalin in multiple ways: the 
HSPA9 locus maps to 5q31.2 that is frequently deleted in human MDS; mutant Hspa9 
causes zebrafish MDS; and Hspa9 knockdown mice have decreased hematopoiesis. We 
show here that HSPA9 functions in mitochondrial ISC biogenesis, and is required 
for erythroid differentiation. HSPA9 interacts with and stabilizes the 
mitochondrial ISC biogenesis proteins frataxin, Nfs1, ISCU, and Nfu. MDS-causing 
mutations in HSPA9 protein change its interactions with ISC biogenesis proteins. 
Depletion of HSPA9 decreases aconitase activity, which requires an ISC at its 
active site, but not that of the non-ISC requiring malate dehydrogenase, and 
increases IRP1 binding activity. In erythroid cell lines, Hspa9 depletion 
inhibited erythroid differentiation, post-transcriptionally regulating the 
expression of Alas2 and FeCH, as expected through known ISC control of the IRE 
response elements in these genes. By contrast, the Alas2 open reading frame 
rescued the Hspa9-dependent defect in erythroid differentiation, but not when 
uncoupled from its 5'-IRE sequence. Thus, Hspa9 depletion causes a mitochondrial 
ISC deficit, altering IRP1-IRE binding and FeCH stability, which consequently 
inhibits Alas2 translation, heme synthesis, and erythroid differentiation, i.e.: 
Hspa9->ISC->IRP/IRE->Alas2->heme synthesis->erythroid differentiation. Thus 
Hspa9 regulates erythroid differentiation through ISC cluster assembly, 
providing a pathophysiological mechanism for an MDS subtype characterized by 
HSPA9 haploinsufficiency, and suggests hemin and other pharmacological 
stimulators of ISC synthesis as potential routes to therapy.
