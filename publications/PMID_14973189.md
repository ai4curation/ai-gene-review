Brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein 1 (BIG1) is an 
approximately 200-kDa brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein 
that preferentially activates ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) and ARF3. BIG1 
was found in cytosol in a multiprotein complex with a similar ARF-activating 
protein, BIG2, which is also an A kinase-anchoring protein. In HepG2 cells 
growing with serum, BIG1 was primarily cytosolic and Golgi-associated. After 
incubation overnight without serum, a large fraction of endogenous BIG1 was in 
the nuclei. By confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, BIG1 was localized with 
nucleoporin p62 at the nuclear envelope (probably during nucleocytoplasmic 
transport) and also in nucleoli, clearly visible against the less concentrated 
overall matrix staining. BIG1 was also identified by Western blot analyses in 
purified subnuclear fractions (e.g., nucleoli and nuclear matrix). Antibodies 
against BIG1, nucleoporin, or nucleolin coimmunoprecipitated the other two 
proteins from purified nuclei. In contrast, BIG2 was not associated with nuclear 
BIG1. Also of note, ARF was never detected among proteins precipitated from 
purified nuclei by anti-BIG1 antibodies, although microscopically the two 
proteins do appear sometimes to be colocalized in the nucleus. These data are 
consistent with independent intracellular movements and actions of BIG1 and 
BIG2, and they are also evidence of the participation of BIG1 in both Golgi and 
nuclear functions.
