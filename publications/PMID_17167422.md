Caspase-3 is activated during both terminal differentiation and 
erythropoietin-starvation-induced apoptosis of human erythroid precursors. The 
transcription factor GATA-1, which performs an essential function in erythroid 
differentiation by positively regulating promoters of erythroid and 
anti-apoptotic genes, is cleaved by caspases in erythroid precursors undergoing 
cell death upon erythropoietin starvation or engagement of the death receptor 
Fas. In contrast, by an unknown mechanism, GATA-1 remains uncleaved when these 
cells undergo terminal differentiation upon stimulation with Epo. Here we show 
that during differentiation, but not during apoptosis, the chaperone protein 
Hsp70 protects GATA-1 from caspase-mediated proteolysis. At the onset of caspase 
activation, Hsp70 co-localizes and interacts with GATA-1 in the nucleus of 
erythroid precursors undergoing terminal differentiation. In contrast, 
erythropoietin starvation induces the nuclear export of Hsp70 and the cleavage 
of GATA-1. In an in vitro assay, Hsp70 protects GATA-1 from caspase-3-mediated 
proteolysis through its peptide-binding domain. The use of RNA-mediated 
interference to decrease the Hsp70 content of erythroid precursors cultured in 
the presence of erythropoietin leads to GATA-1 cleavage, a decrease in 
haemoglobin content, downregulation of the expression of the anti-apoptotic 
protein Bcl-X(L), and cell death by apoptosis. These effects are abrogated by 
the transduction of a caspase-resistant GATA-1 mutant. Thus, in erythroid 
precursors undergoing terminal differentiation, Hsp70 prevents active caspase-3 
from cleaving GATA-1 and inducing apoptosis.
