In response to DNA damage, p53 undergoes post-translational modifications 
(including acetylation) that are critical for its transcriptional activity. 
However, the mechanism by which p53 acetylation is regulated is still unclear. 
Here, we describe an essential role for HLA-B-associated transcript 3 
(Bat3)/Scythe in controlling the acetylation of p53 required for DNA damage 
responses. Depletion of Bat3 from human and mouse cells markedly impairs 
p53-mediated transactivation of its target genes Puma and p21. Although DNA 
damage-induced phosphorylation, stabilization, and nuclear accumulation of p53 
are not significantly affected by Bat3 depletion, p53 acetylation is almost 
completely abolished. Bat3 forms a complex with p300, and an increased amount of 
Bat3 enhances the recruitment of p53 to p300 and facilitates subsequent p53 
acetylation. In contrast, Bat3-depleted cells show reduced p53-p300 complex 
formation and decreased p53 acetylation. Furthermore, consistent with our in 
vitro findings, thymocytes from Bat3-deficient mice exhibit reduced induction of 
puma and p21, and are resistant to DNA damage-induced apoptosis in vivo. Our 
data indicate that Bat3 is a novel and essential regulator of p53-mediated 
responses to genotoxic stress, and that Bat3 controls DNA damage-induced 
acetylation of p53.

Abstract

In response to DNA damage, p53 undergoes post-translational modifications (including acetylation) that are critical for its transcriptional activity. However, the mechanism by which p53 acetylation is regulated is still unclear. Here, we describe an essential role for HLA-B-associated transcript 3 (Bat3)/Scythe in controlling the acetylation of p53 required for DNA damage responses. Depletion of Bat3 from human and mouse cells markedly impairs p53-mediated transactivation of its target genes Puma and p21 . Although DNA damage-induced phosphorylation, stabilization, and nuclear accumulation of p53 are not significantly affected by Bat3 depletion, p53 acetylation is almost completely abolished. Bat3 forms a complex with p300, and an increased amount of Bat3 enhances the recruitment of p53 to p300 and facilitates subsequent p53 acetylation. In contrast, Bat3-depleted cells show reduced p53â€“p300 complex formation and decreased p53 acetylation. Furthermore, consistent with our in vitro findings, thymocytes from Bat3-deficient mice exhibit reduced induction of puma and p21, and are resistant to DNA damage-induced apoptosis in vivo. Our data indicate that Bat3 is a novel and essential regulator of p53-mediated responses to genotoxic stress, and that Bat3 controls DNA damage-induced acetylation of p53.

Discussion

In this study, we have defined the positive regulatory role of Bat3 in DNA damage-induced p53 transactivation and have started to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, we have shown that Bat3 is required for the acetylation of p53 in response to DNA damage.
