Origin recognition complex (ORC), a six-protein complex, is the most likely 
initiator of chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotes. Throughout the cell 
cycle, ORC binds to chromatin at origins of DNA replication and functions as a 
'landing pad' for the binding of other proteins, including Cdt1p, to form a 
prereplicative complex. In this study, we used yeast two-hybrid analysis to 
examine the interaction between Cdt1p and every ORC subunit. We observed potent 
interaction with Orc6p, and weaker interaction with Orc2p and Orc5p. 
Coimmunoprecipitation assay confirmed that Cdt1p interacted with Orc6p, as well 
as with Orc1p and Orc2p. We mapped the C-terminal region, and a middle region of 
Orc6p (amino acids residues 394-435, and 121-175, respectively), as important 
for interaction with Cdt1p. Cdt1p was purified to examine its direct interaction 
with ORC, and its effect on the activity of ORC. Glutathione-S-transferase 
pull-down analysis revealed that Cdt1p binds directly to ORC. Cdt1p neither 
bound to origin DNA and ATP nor affected ORC-binding to origin DNA and ATP. 
These results suggest that interaction of Cdt1p with ORC is involved in the 
formation of the prereplicative complex, rather than in regulation of the 
activity of ORC.
