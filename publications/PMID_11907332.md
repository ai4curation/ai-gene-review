Previous studies have shown that the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E6
protein binds to p300/CBP and abrogates its transcriptional co-activator
function. However, there is little information on the biological consequences of
this interaction and discrepancy as to whether the interaction is high-risk E6
specific or not. We performed a series of studies to compare the interactions of
HPV-18 and HPV-11 E6 with p300, and showed that both high- and low- risk E6
proteins bind p300. In addition, using a transformation-deficient mutant of
adenovirus E1a, which cannot interact with p300, we demonstrated that HPV-16,
HPV-18 and, to a lesser extent, HPV-11 E6, can complement this mutant in cell
transformation assays. In contrast, a mutant of HPV-16 E6 which does not bind
p300 failed to rescue the E1a mutant. These results suggest that the E6-p300
interaction may be important for the ability of HPV E6 to contribute towards
cell transformation.
