Mutations in certain nuclear envelope (NE) proteins cause muscular dystrophies 
and other disorders, but the disease mechanisms remain unclear. The nuclear 
envelope transmembrane protein NET25 (Lem2) is a truncated paralog of MAN1, an 
NE component linked to bone disorders. NET25 and MAN1 share an approximately 
40-residue LEM homology domain with emerin, the protein mutated in X-linked 
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. However, roles for NET25 and MAN1 in 
myogenesis have not yet been described. Using RNA interference in C2C12 
myoblasts, we show for the first time that both NET25 and MAN1 are required for 
myogenic differentiation. NET25 depletion causes hyperactivation of 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 at the onset of differentiation, and 
pharmacological inhibition of this transient overactivation rescues myogenesis. 
In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of both mitogen-activated protein kinase 
and transforming growth factor beta signaling is required to rescue 
differentiation after MAN1 depletion. Ectopic expression of silencing-resistant 
NET25 rescues myogenesis after depletion of emerin but not after MAN1 silencing. 
Thus, NET25 and emerin have at least partially overlapping functions during 
myogenic differentiation, which are distinct from those of MAN1. Our work 
supports the hypothesis that deregulation of cell signaling contributes to 
NE-linked disorders and suggests that mutations in NET25 and MAN1 may cause 
muscle diseases.

Abstract

Mutations in certain nuclear envelope (NE) proteins cause muscular dystrophies and other disorders, but the disease mechanisms remain unclear. The n uclear e nvelope t ransmembrane protein NET25 (Lem2) is a truncated paralog of MAN1, an NE component linked to bone disorders. NET25 and MAN1 share an ∼40-residue LEM homology domain with emerin, the protein mutated in X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. However, roles for NET25 and MAN1 in myogenesis have not yet been described. Using RNA interference in C2C12 myoblasts, we show for the first time that both NET25 and MAN1 are required for myogenic differentiation. NET25 depletion causes hyperactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 at the onset of differentiation, and pharmacological inhibition of this transient overactivation rescues myogenesis. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of both mitogen-activated protein kinase and transforming growth factor β signaling is required to rescue differentiation after MAN1 depletion. Ectopic expression of silencing-resistant NET25 rescues myogenesis after depletion of emerin but not after MAN1 silencing. Thus, NET25 and emerin have at least partially overlapping functions during myogenic differentiation, which are distinct from those of MAN1. Our work supports the hypothesis that deregulation of cell signaling contributes to NE-linked disorders and suggests that mutations in NET25 and MAN1 may cause muscle diseases.

DISCUSSION

Transmembrane proteins of the INM are a functionally diverse group of components that interact closely with lamins. Previously, emerin was the only transmembrane protein of the INM implicated in myogenesis ( 18 ). Here, using C2C12 cells, we show that NET25 and MAN1 are two additional INM proteins required for myogenic differentiation. These three proteins all regulate cell signaling ( 26 , 30 , 31 , 35 ; also, this study), and the results of our phenotypic analysis highlight the importance of their signaling functions in myogenic differentiation. Our results, in concert with other recent data, support the model that diseases caused by NE mutations can at least partially result from changes in signaling pathways.

Surprisingly, we found that emerin and NET25 have redundant functions in myoblast differentiation. The sequence homology between NET25 and emerin is limited to the LEM domain in the first ∼40 amino acids, and the transmembrane topology of NET25 (a type III/multipass transmembrane protein) is different from that of emerin (a type II/single-pass transmembrane protein). Nonetheless, the silencing of NET25 and emerin showed identical phenotypic signatures in cell differentiation, cell cycle, and MAPK activation assays. More importantly, increasing NET25 levels by ectopic overexpression compensated for loss of emerin function in myogenesis. Furthermore, pharmacologically suppressing the burst of ERK1/2 activity that occurred shortly after shift to DM was sufficient to restore myogenesis in both NET25- and emerin-depleted cultures. Therefore, NET25 and emerin appear to have overlapping functions in myogenesis by regulation of ERK signaling (see below).

Despite the relatively strong amino acid sequence similarity of 57% between MAN1 and NET25 ( 6 ), the effects of MAN1 depletion on C2C12 cells were distinct from those seen with NET25 and emerin depletion in three ways. First, only silencing of MAN1 caused an increase in the percentage of S phase nuclei in proliferating and early differentiating cell cultures, even though cell cycle exit was not impaired. This increase came at the expense of the G 1 population in MAN1-depleted cultures, suggesting that lower MAN1 levels cause cells to enter S phase prematurely. Second, ectopic expression of NET25 did not rescue myogenesis after MAN1 depletion. Third, although pharmacological suppression of ERK signaling alone was sufficient to rescue myogenesis in NET25- and emerin-silenced cultures, the combined inhibition of ERK and SMAD signaling was needed to restore myogenic differentiation in shMAN1 cultures. Therefore, NET25 and MAN1 have at least partially nonredundant functions in differentiation of C2C12 cells. The pharmacological rescue experiments further suggest that MAN1 not only regulates TGF-β signaling (reviewed in reference 3 ), but also can influence ERK signaling, either directly or via cross talk with the TGF-β pathway.

Our conclusion that NET25 regulates ERK is supported by four lines of evidence. First, the levels of phospho-ERK1, and to a lesser degree the levels of phospho-ERK2, are elevated in NET25-depleted cultures relative to those in control C2C12 cultures shortly after shifting cultures to DM. Second, ERK1, and to a lesser extent ERK2, was more sensitive to activation by EGF in NET25-depleted C2C12 cultures. Third, overexpression of human NET25 in C2C12 cells diminished ERK1 activation in response to EGF. Fourth, a pharmacological approach showed that the myogenic defect in NET25-depleted myoblast cultures can be rescued by transient inhibition of ERK phosphorylation at the onset of myogenesis.

Both the amplitude as well as the duration of MAPK signaling can influence the physiological outcome of pathway activation ( 28 ). In addition, regulation of spatial distribution of signaling components can alter the output of a signaling event, such as by regulating access to substrates ( 13 ). NET25 and emerin could play roles in either scenario. Transient hyperactivation of ERK1/2 occurring in the absence of NET25 or emerin could directly upregulate expression of antimyogenic factors or inactivate promyogenic factors, thus derailing the myogenic program. Proliferation of muscle progenitor cells (satellite cells) in response to mitogens, predominantly hepatocyte growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family members, involves ERK activation via receptor tyrosine kinases and is required for efficient muscle repair in vivo ( 8 ). However, uncontrolled proliferation of muscle progenitor cells is incompatible with myogenesis, consistent with studies showing that constitutive activation of MAPK signaling by forced expression of Ras inhibits myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells ( 11 ). Therefore, proliferative signals have to be turned off after myoblast expansion in order to allow formation of muscle fibers. The switch from proliferation to differentiation could be promoted by mammalian Sprouty isoforms, which negatively regulate FGF-2 mediated ERK activation ( 34 ). Overexpression of Sprouty-2 allows C2C12 differentiation in the presence of FGF-2 ( 12 ), and Sprouty homologs 1, 2, and 3 are transcriptionally upregulated during C2C12 differentiation ( 9 ; also see GEO accession number GSE4694 ). Analogously, NET25 and emerin could aid myogenesis by keeping ERK1/2 signals in check at the initial stages of terminal differentiation emulated by the C2C12 model system used here. This proposition agrees with our previous observation that NET25 levels are highest in adult mouse muscle ( 9 ), where it might help to maintain a nonproliferative state.

Mechanistically, our data indicate that NET25 acts at or very close to the level of ERK1 in this signaling cascade. In NET25-depleted cells in which ERK1 was hyperactivated, we found that MEK1/2, the MAPK that activates ERK1/2, itself was not hyperactivated, unlike a downstream target of ERK1 (Elk1). Our deletion analysis revealed that the N-terminal nucleoplasmic domain of NET25 is required for the suppression of ERK1 activation by NET25, whereas the C-terminal nucleoplasmic domain, predicted to form a winged helix domain akin to the one found in MAN1 ( 7 ), is not required. It is noteworthy that the N-terminal region of NET25 contains several features that indicate a potentially direct interaction with ERK1. The Scansite web server ( 33 ) identifies residues 89 to 103 and 216 to 230 of mouse NET25 as potential ERK docking (ERK-D) sites, a motif that confers physical interaction with ERKs ( 39 ). Moreover, residue Ser97 in mouse NET25 is predicted to be phosphorylated by ERK1. Although we have not yet been able to obtain conclusive evidence that NET25 physically interacts with ERK1 or one of its phosphatases, we propose that NET25 could function as a scaffold that brings ERK1 and a cognate MAPK phosphatase into close proximity at the nuclear periphery and thus attenuates ERK signaling. Analysis of the NE proteome and NET25 protein interactions in myonuclei will address this possibility in the future.

In conclusion, our study suggests that the LEMD2 gene (encoding NET25) is an excellent candidate for a novel disease gene within the large cohort of EDMD cases that cannot be attributed to mutations in EMD or LMNA. Analysis of NET25 in EDMD patients and animal models of muscular dystrophy could provide insight into this question in the near future.
