Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of CKD in the Western world. 
Endothelin receptor antagonists have emerged as a novel treatment for DN, but 
the mechanisms underlying the protective effect remain unknown. We previously 
showed that both heparanase and endothelin-1 are essential for the development 
of DN. Here, we further investigated the role of these proteins in DN, and 
demonstrated that endothelin-1 activates podocytes to release heparanase. 
Furthermore, conditioned podocyte culture medium increased glomerular 
transendothelial albumin passage in a heparanase-dependent manner. In mice, 
podocyte-specific knockout of the endothelin receptor prevented the 
diabetes-induced increase in glomerular heparanase expression, consequent 
reduction in heparan sulfate expression and endothelial glycocalyx thickness, 
and development of proteinuria observed in wild-type counterparts. Our data 
suggest that in diabetes, endothelin-1 signaling, as occurs in endothelial 
activation, induces heparanase expression in the podocyte, damage to the 
glycocalyx, proteinuria, and renal failure. Thus, prevention of these effects 
may constitute the mechanism of action of endothelin receptor blockers in DN.
