The prevalence of dementia in the Western world in people over the age of 60 has 
been estimated to be greater than 5%, about two-thirds of which are due to 
Alzheimer's disease. The age-specific prevalence of Alzheimer's disease nearly 
doubles every 5 years after age 65, leading to a prevalence of greater than 25% 
in those over the age of 90 (ref. 3). Here, to search for low-frequency variants 
in the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) gene with a significant effect on the 
risk of Alzheimer's disease, we studied coding variants in APP in a set of 
whole-genome sequence data from 1,795 Icelanders. We found a coding mutation 
(A673T) in the APP gene that protects against Alzheimer's disease and cognitive 
decline in the elderly without Alzheimer's disease. This substitution is 
adjacent to the aspartyl protease β-site in APP, and results in an approximately 
40% reduction in the formation of amyloidogenic peptides in vitro. The strong 
protective effect of the A673T substitution against Alzheimer's disease provides 
proof of principle for the hypothesis that reducing the β-cleavage of APP may 
protect against the disease. Furthermore, as the A673T allele also protects 
against cognitive decline in the elderly without Alzheimer's disease, the two 
may be mediated through the same or similar mechanisms.
