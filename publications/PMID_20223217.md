The existence of three types of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS), bacterial 
(alphabeta)(2), eukaryotic/archaeal cytosolic (alphabeta)(2), and mitochondrial 
alpha, is a prominent example of structural diversity within the aaRS family. 
PheRSs have considerably diverged in primary sequences, domain compositions, and 
subunit organizations. Loss of the anticodon-binding domain B8 in human 
cytosolic PheRS (hcPheRS) is indicative of variations in the tRNA(Phe) binding 
and recognition as compared to bacterial PheRSs. We report herein the crystal 
structure of hcPheRS in complex with phenylalanine at 3.3 A resolution. A novel 
structural module has been revealed at the N terminus of the alpha subunit. It 
stretches out into the solvent of approximately 80 A and is made up of three 
structural domains (DBDs) possessing DNA-binding fold. The dramatic reduction of 
aminoacylation activity for truncated N terminus variants coupled with 
structural data and tRNA-docking model testify that DBDs play crucial role in 
hcPheRS activity.
