The tumor suppressor p53 is in equilibrium at cellular concentrations between 
dimers and tetramers. Oncogenic mutant p53 (mut) exerts a dominant-negative 
effect on co-expression of p53 wild-type (wt) and mut alleles in cancer cells. 
It is believed that wt and mut form hetero-tetramers of attenuated activity, via 
their tetramerization domains. Using electrospray mass spectrometry on 
isotopically labeled samples, we measured directly the composition and rates of 
formation of p53 complexes in the presence and absence of response element DNA. 
The dissociation of tetramers was unexpectedly very slow (t(1/2) = 40 min) at 37 
degrees C, matched by slow association of dimers, which is approximately four 
times longer than the half-life of spontaneous denaturation of wt p53. On mixing 
wt tetramers with the oncogenic contact mutant R273H of low DNA affinity, we 
observed the same slow formation of only wt(4), wt(2)mut(2), and mut(4), in the 
ratio 1:2:1, on a cellular time scale. On mixing wt and mut with response 
element DNAs P21 and BAX, we observed only the complexes wt(4)xDNA, 
wt(2)mut(2)xDNA, and mut(4)xDNA, with relative dissociation constants 1:4:71 and 
1:13:85, respectively, accounting for the dominant-negative effect by weakened 
affinity. p53 dimers assemble rapidly to tetramers on binding to response 
element DNA, initiated by the p53 DNA binding domains. The slow oligomerization 
of free p53, competing with spontaneous denaturation, has implications for the 
possible regulation of p53 by binding proteins and DNA that affect 
tetramerization kinetics as well as equilibria.

Abstract

The tumor suppressor p53 is in equilibrium at cellular concentrations between dimers and tetramers. Oncogenic mutant p53 (mut) exerts a dominant-negative effect on co-expression of p53 wild-type (wt) and mut alleles in cancer cells. It is believed that wt and mut form hetero-tetramers of attenuated activity, via their tetramerization domains. Using electrospray mass spectrometry on isotopically labeled samples, we measured directly the composition and rates of formation of p53 complexes in the presence and absence of response element DNA. The dissociation of tetramers was unexpectedly very slow ( t 1/2 = 40 min) at 37 °C, matched by slow association of dimers, which is approximately four times longer than the half-life of spontaneous denaturation of wt p53. On mixing wt tetramers with the oncogenic contact mutant R273H of low DNA affinity, we observed the same slow formation of only wt 4 , wt 2 mut 2 , and mut 4 , in the ratio 1:2:1, on a cellular time scale. On mixing wt and mut with response element DNAs P21 and BAX, we observed only the complexes wt 4 .DNA, wt 2 mut 2 .DNA, and mut 4 .DNA, with relative dissociation constants 1:4:71 and 1:13:85, respectively, accounting for the dominant-negative effect by weakened affinity. p53 dimers assemble rapidly to tetramers on binding to response element DNA, initiated by the p53 DNA binding domains. The slow oligomerization of free p53, competing with spontaneous denaturation, has implications for the possible regulation of p53 by binding proteins and DNA that affect tetramerization kinetics as well as equilibria.

Discussion

The use of ESI-MS has allowed us to measure the association-dissociation kinetics of p53 subunits and also the affinity of mutant tetrameric protein for DNA. The rate constant for the dissociation of tetrameric protein was surprisingly and unexpectedly low. The half-life for the dissociation into dimers at 20 °C was 2.3 h and the only species of mixed hybrids formed between wild-type and mutant p53 was wt 2 mut 2 , without any of the 3:1 and 1:3 species. The half-life was 40 min at 37 °C. The dissociation constant of tetrameric p53 into dimers is approximately 20 nM, which means that at a concentration of approximately 20 nM p53 (20 nM of dimers) the half-life for association of dimers into tetramers is also 40 min. The second-order rate constant for association of dimers into tetramers is only approximately 1.4 × 10 4 s −1 M −1 , some one to two orders of magnitude lower than for most protein-protein interactions.

These experiments would not have been possible using wild-type p53 but required the superstable quadruple mutant that has been key to our structural studies ( 22 , 24 , 25 , 30 – 32 ): a half-life of 40 min at 37 °C for formation of tetramers is longer than the half-life of 9–16 min for the spontaneous denaturation of wild-type p53 at 37 °C ( 28 ). The combination of the high instability of wild-type p53 and its slow oligomerization has profound implications: unless there are special factors within the cell, p53 will spontaneously denature faster than it will form active tetramers. However, there are routes for p53 to associate other than the initial dimerization of a pair of dimers via their tetramerization domains. For example, very dilute solutions of p53 that are mainly dimeric form DNA-bound tetramers within seconds when added to response element DNA ( 33 ). This reaction must occur by the rapid binding of 1 dimer to one pair of DNA binding sites, followed by the second dimer to the second pair of sites—DNA is thus a catalyst for association. The finding of slow association rate constants shows that the co-operative binding of p53 dimers to DNA is the result of a stepwise addition of dimers rather than resulting from a fast preequilibrium between dimeric and tetrameric p53.

We speculate that the slow association and dissociation rate constants for oligomerization might be part of a regulatory mechanism of p53 for processes where the presence of either dimers or tetramers is important for function or trafficking. It is possible that there may be proteins (or other DNAs) that can catalyze the association of p53. For example, we have recently found that 14–4-3γ enhances the association equilibrium of p53 by binding to its C-termini ( 34 ). So, there may be a further mode of regulation of p53 by proteins altering the rate of p53 association.

The slow rate of shuffling of subunits also has implications for the dominant negative effect of mutants where wild-type and mutant alleles are present. For contact mutants that are as stable as wild type, there will be formed just the species wt 4 , wt 2 mut 2 , mut 4 in the ratio 1:2:1, which, given the affinities we have measured here, will lower the effective concentration of wt 4 tetramers competent for binding by about a factor of 4, rather than closer to 16 expected for complete shuffling of subunits in the ratio 1:4:6:4:1. Unstable structural mutants that denature far faster than they can oligomerize with wild type will effectively lower the concentration of wild-type p53 by a factor of 2.

Although we do not know the full reasons for the high instability and slow rates of association of p53, it would seem that they are part of a complex scheme for regulation of p53 that invokes a myriad of active networks with secondary features of inherent safeguards for the spontaneous denaturation of p53. The slow rates of equilibration of p53 has to be considered in interpreting biophysical data.
