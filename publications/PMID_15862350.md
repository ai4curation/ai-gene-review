Polycystin-2, a member of the TRP family of calcium channels, is encoded by the 
human PKD2 gene. Mutations in that gene can lead to swelling of nephrons into 
the fluid-filled cysts of polycystic kidney disease. In addition to expression 
in tubular epithelial cells, human polycystin-2 is found in muscle and neuronal 
cells, but its cell biological function has been unclear. A homologue in 
Caenorhabditis elegans is necessary for male mating behavior. We compared the 
behavior, calcium signaling mechanisms, and electrophysiology of wild-type and 
pkd-2 knockout C. elegans. In addition to characterizing PKD-2-mediated 
aggregation and mating behaviors, we found that polycystin-2 is an intracellular 
Ca(2+) release channel that is required for the normal pattern of Ca(2+) 
responses involving IP(3) and ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca(2+) release from 
intracellular stores. Activity of polycystin-2 creates brief cytosolic Ca(2+) 
transients with increased amplitude and decreased duration. Polycystin-2, along 
with the IP(3) and ryanodine receptors, acts as a major calcium-release channel 
in the endoplasmic reticulum in cells where rapid calcium signaling is required, 
and polycystin-2 activity is essential in those excitable cells for rapid 
responses to stimuli.
