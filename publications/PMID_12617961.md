Calcineurin, a calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, regulates transcription 
and possibly apoptosis. Previous studies demonstrated that in baby hamster 
kidney-21 cells after co-transfection calcineurin interacts with Bcl-2, thereby 
altering transcription and apoptosis. Using co-immunoprecipitation and 
subcellular fractionation techniques, we observed that calcineurin occurred as a 
complex with Bcl-2 in various regions of rat and mouse brain. The 
calcineurin-Bcl-2 complex was identified in mitochondrial, nuclear, microsomal 
and cytosol fractions. In vitro induction of hypoxia and aglycia or 
N-methyl-D-aspartate treatment markedly altered both extent of complex formation 
and its subcellular localization. These observations suggest that Bcl-2 either 
sequesters calcineurin, that calcineurin dephosphorylates Bcl-2, or that Bcl-2 
shuttles calcineurin to specific substrates. Calcineurin also 
co-immunoprecipitated with the inositol-tris-phosphate receptor. This 
interaction increased after in vitro hypoxia/aglycia. In Bcl-2 (-/-) mice, 
interactions between calcineurin- and inositol-tris-phosphate receptor occurred 
less frequently than in wild-type mice under both control and hypoxic 
conditions. Experiments involving cell-free systems, as well as brain slices 
treated with thapsigargin or with N-methyl-D-aspartate suggested that calcium 
and calmodulin activation of calcineurin leads to interactions between 
calcineurin and Bcl-2. These data indicate that during times of cellular stress 
and damage, Bcl-2 targets activated calcineurin to specific compartments and 
substrates.
