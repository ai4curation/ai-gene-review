The deviant Ras activation machinery is found in approximately 30% of all human 
cancers. SOS1 is an important protagonist of this pathway that plays a key-role 
in aberrant cell proliferation and differentiation. Interaction of SOS1 with 
14-3-3 proteins modulates SOS1 activity in Ras-MAPK signaling. In the present 
study, we analyze the 14-3-3/SOS1 protein-protein interaction (PPI) by different 
biochemical assays and report the high resolution crystal structure of a 13-mer 
motif of SOS1 bound to 14-3-3ζ. These structural and functional insights are 
important for the evaluation of this PPI interface for small-molecule 
stabilization as a new starting point for modulating the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway.
