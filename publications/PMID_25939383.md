Maintenance of chromosomal ends (telomeres) directly contributes to cancer cell 
immortalization. The telomere protection enzymes belonging to the tankyrase 
(Tnks) subfamily of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) have recently been 
shown to also control transcriptional response to secreted Wnt signaling 
molecules. Whereas Tnks inhibitors are currently being developed as therapeutic 
agents for targeting Wnt-related cancers and as modulators of Wnt signaling in 
tissue-engineering agendas, their impact on telomere length maintenance remains 
unclear. Here, we leveraged a collection of Wnt pathway inhibitors with 
previously unassigned mechanisms of action to identify novel pharmacophores 
supporting Tnks inhibition. A multifaceted experimental approach that included 
structural, biochemical, and cell biological analyses revealed two distinct 
chemotypes with selectivity for Tnks enzymes. Using these reagents, we revealed 
that Tnks inhibition rapidly induces DNA damage at telomeres and telomeric 
shortening upon long-term chemical exposure in cultured cells. On the other 
hand, inhibitors of the Wnt acyltransferase Porcupine (Porcn) elicited neither 
effect. Thus, Tnks inhibitors impact telomere length maintenance independently 
of their affects on Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We discuss the implications of 
these findings for anticancer and regenerative medicine agendas dependent upon 
chemical inhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
