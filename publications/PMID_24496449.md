Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a proteoglycan that is bound to the cell surface. It is 
expressed by most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) but not by normal 
hepatocytes. GPC3 stimulates HCC growth by promoting canonical Wnt signaling. 
Because glypicans interact with Wnts, it has been proposed that these 
proteoglycans stimulate signaling by increasing the amount of Wnt at the cell 
membrane, thus facilitating the interaction of this growth factor with its 
signaling receptor, Frizzled. However, in this study, we demonstrate that GPC3 
plays a more direct role in the stimulation of Wnt signaling. Specifically, we 
show that, in addition to interacting with Wnt, GPC3 and Frizzled interact 
directly through the glycosaminoglycan chains of GPC3, indicating that this 
glypican stimulates the formation of signaling complexes between Wnt and 
Frizzled. Consistent with this, we show that the binding of Wnt at the cell 
membrane triggers the endocytosis of a complex that includes Wnt, Frizzled and 
GPC3. Additional support for our model is provided by the finding that 
glypican-6 (GPC6) inhibits canonical Wnt signaling, despite the fact that it 
binds to Wnt at the cell membrane.
