The largest subunit of TFIID, TAF1, possesses an intrinsic protein kinase 
activity and is important for cell G1 progression and apoptosis. Since p53 
functions by inducing cell G1 arrest and apoptosis, we investigated the link 
between TAF1 and p53. We found that TAF1 induces G1 progression in a 
p53-dependent manner. TAF1 interacts with and phosphorylates p53 at Thr-55 in 
vivo. Substitution of Thr-55 with an alanine residue (T55A) stabilizes p53 and 
impairs the ability of TAF1 to induce G1 progression. Furthermore, both 
RNAi-mediated TAF1 ablation and apigenin-mediated inhibition of the kinase 
activity of TAF1 markedly reduced Thr-55 phosphorylation. Thus, phosphorylation 
and the resultant degradation of p53 provide a mechanism for regulation of the 
cell cycle by TAF1. Significantly, the Thr-55 phosphorylation was reduced 
following DNA damage, suggesting that this phosphorylation contributes to the 
stabilization of p53 in response to DNA damage.
