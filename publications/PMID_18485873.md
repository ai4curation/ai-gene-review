The anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) orchestrates progression through mitosis 
by decorating cell-cycle regulators with ubiquitin chains. To nucleate chains, 
the APC/C links ubiquitin to a lysine in substrates, but to elongate chains it 
modifies lysine residues in attached ubiquitin moieties. The mechanism enabling 
the APC/C, and ubiquitin ligases in general, to switch from lysine residues in 
substrates to specific ones in ubiquitin remains poorly understood. Here, we 
determine the topology and the mechanism of assembly for the ubiquitin chains 
mediating functions of the human APC/C. We find that the APC/C triggers 
substrate degradation by assembling K11-linked ubiquitin chains, the efficient 
formation of which depends on a surface of ubiquitin, the TEK-box. Strikingly, 
homologous TEK-boxes are found in APC/C substrates, where they facilitate chain 
nucleation. We propose that recognition of similar motifs in substrates and 
ubiquitin enables the APC/C to assemble ubiquitin chains with the specificity 
and efficiency required for tight cell-cycle control.
