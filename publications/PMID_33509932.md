The minor spliceosome mediates splicing of the rare but essential U12-type 
precursor messenger RNA. Here, we report the atomic features of the activated 
human minor spliceosome determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 2.9-angstrom 
resolution. The 5' splice site and branch point sequence of the U12-type intron 
are recognized by the U6atac and U12 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), respectively. 
Five newly identified proteins stabilize the conformation of the catalytic 
center: The zinc finger protein SCNM1 functionally mimics the SF3a complex of 
the major spliceosome, the RBM48-ARMC7 complex binds the γ-monomethyl phosphate 
cap at the 5' end of U6atac snRNA, the U-box protein PPIL2 coordinates loop I of 
U5 snRNA and stabilizes U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), and CRIPT 
stabilizes U12 snRNP. Our study provides a framework for the mechanistic 
understanding of the function of the human minor spliceosome.
