The human σ1 receptor is an enigmatic endoplasmic-reticulum-resident 
transmembrane protein implicated in a variety of disorders including depression, 
drug addiction, and neuropathic pain. Recently, an additional connection to 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has emerged from studies of human genetics and 
mouse models. Unlike many transmembrane receptors that belong to large, 
extensively studied families such as G-protein-coupled receptors or ligand-gated 
ion channels, the σ1 receptor is an evolutionary isolate with no discernible 
similarity to any other human protein. Despite its increasingly clear importance 
in human physiology and disease, the molecular architecture of the σ1 receptor 
and its regulation by drug-like compounds remain poorly defined. Here we report 
crystal structures of the human σ1 receptor in complex with two chemically 
divergent ligands, PD144418 and 4-IBP. The structures reveal a trimeric 
architecture with a single transmembrane domain in each protomer. The 
carboxy-terminal domain of the receptor shows an extensive flat, hydrophobic 
membrane-proximal surface, suggesting an intimate association with the cytosolic 
surface of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in cells. This domain includes a 
cupin-like β-barrel with the ligand-binding site buried at its centre. This 
large, hydrophobic ligand-binding cavity shows remarkable plasticity in ligand 
recognition, binding the two ligands in similar positions despite dissimilar 
chemical structures. Taken together, these results reveal the overall 
architecture, oligomerization state, and molecular basis for ligand recognition 
by this important but poorly understood protein.
