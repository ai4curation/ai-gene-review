The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway in the 
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by two membrane-bound ubiquitin 
ligases, Doa10 and Hrd1. These enzymes are found in distinct multiprotein 
complexes that allow them to recognize and target a variety of substrates for 
proteasomal degradation. Although multiprotein complexes containing mammalian 
ERAD ubiquitin ligases likely exist, they have yet to be identified and 
characterized in detail. Here, we identify two ER membrane proteins, SPFH2 and 
TMUB1, as associated proteins of mammalian gp78, a membrane-bound ubiquitin 
ligase that bears significant sequence homology with mammalian Hrd1 and mediates 
sterol-accelerated ERAD of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme HMG-CoA 
reductase. Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicate that TMUB1 bridges SPFH2 to 
gp78 in ER membranes. The functional significance of these interactions is 
revealed by the observation that RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of 
SPFH2 and TMUB1 blunts both the sterol-induced ubiquitination and degradation of 
endogenous reductase in HEK-293 cells. These studies mark the initial steps in 
the characterization of the mammalian gp78 ubiquitin ligase complex, the further 
elucidation of which may yield important insights into mechanisms underlying 
gp78-mediated ERAD.
