A crucial step in eukaryotic transcriptional initiation is recognition of the 
promoter TATA by the TATA-binding protein (TBP), which then allows TFIIA and 
TFIIB to be recruited. However, nucleosomes block the interaction between TBP 
and DNA. We show that the yeast FACT complex (yFACT) promotes TBP binding to a 
TATA box in chromatin both in vivo and in vitro. The SPT16 gene encodes a 
subunit of yFACT, and we show that certain spt16 mutations are synthetically 
lethal with TBP mutants. Some of these genetic defects can be suppressed by 
TFIIA overexpression, strongly suggesting a role for yFACT in TBP-TFIIA complex 
formation in vivo. Mutations in the TOA2 subunit of TFIIA that disrupt TBP-TFIIA 
complex formation in vitro are also synthetically lethal with spt16. In some 
cases this spt16 toa2 lethality is suppressed by overexpression of TBP or the 
Nhp6 architectural transcription factor that is also a component of yFACT. The 
Spt3 protein in the SAGA complex has been shown to regulate TBP binding at 
certain promoters, and we show that some spt16 phenotypes can be suppressed by 
spt3 mutations. Chromatin immunoprecipitations show TBP binding to promoters is 
reduced in single spt16 and spt3 mutants but increases in the spt16 spt3 double 
mutant, reflecting the mutual suppression seen in the genetic assays. Finally, 
in vitro studies show that yFACT promotes TBP binding to a TATA sequence within 
a reconstituted nucleosome in a TFIIA-dependent manner. Thus, yFACT functions in 
establishing transcription initiation complexes in addition to the previously 
described role in elongation.
