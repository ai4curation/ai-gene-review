We determined the active site of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2 of 
Escherichia coli. A water-soluble form of PBP 2, which was constructed by 
site-directed mutagenesis, was purified by affinity chromatography, labeled with 
dansyl-penicillin, and then digested with a combination of proteases. The amino 
acid composition of the labeled chymotryptic peptide purified by HPLC was 
identical with that of the amino acid sequence, 
Ala-Thr-Gln-Gly-Val-Tyr-Pro-Pro-Ala-Ser330-Thr-Val-Lys-Pro (residues 321-334) of 
PBP 2, which was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the pbpA gene encoding 
PBP 2. This amino acid sequence was verified by sequencing the labeled tryptic 
peptide containing the labeled chymotryptic peptide region. A mutant PBP 2 
(thiol-PBP 2), constructed by site-directed mutagenesis to replace Ser330 with 
Cys, lacked the penicillin-binding activity. These findings provided evidence 
that Ser330 near the middle of the primary structure of PBP 2 is the 
penicillin-binding active-site residue, as predicted previously on the basis of 
the sequence homology. Around this active site, the sequence Ser-Xaa-Xaa-Lys was 
observed, which is conserved in the active-site regions of all E. coli PBPs so 
far studied, class A and class C beta-lactamases, and D-Ala carboxypeptidases. 
The COOH-terminal amino acid of PBP 2 was identified as His633.
