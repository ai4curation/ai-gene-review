Eighteen histone deacetylases (HDACs) are present in humans, categorized into 
two groups: zinc-dependent enzymes (HDAC1-11) and NAD(+)-dependent enzymes 
(sirtuins 1-7). Among zinc-dependent HDACs, HDAC6 is unique. It has a 
cytoplasmic localization, two catalytic sites, a ubiquitin-binding site, and it 
selectively deacetylases alpha-tubulin and Hsp90. Here, we report the discovery 
that the redox regulatory proteins, peroxiredoxin (Prx) I and Prx II are 
specific targets of HDAC6. Prx are antioxidants enzymes whose main function is 
H(2)O(2) reduction. Prx are elevated in many cancers and neurodegenerative 
diseases. The acetylated form of Prx accumulates in the absence of an active 
HDAC6. Acetylation of Prx increases its reducing activity, its resistance to 
superoxidation, and its resistance to transition to high-molecular-mass 
complexes. Thus, HDAC6 and Prx are targets for modulating intracellular redox 
status in therapeutic strategies for disorders as disparate as cancers and 
neurodegenerative diseases.
