Heterozygous carriers of loss-of-function germline mutations in the BRCA1 or 
BRCA2 breast cancer susceptibility genes have a predisposition to breast and 
ovarian cancer. Multiple functions have been ascribed to the products of these 
genes, linking them to pathways that inhibit progression to neoplasia. Various 
investigators have assigned roles for these tumor suppressor gene products in 
the cell functions of genome repair, transcription, and growth control. There is 
emerging evidence that BRCA1 may participate in ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 have each been implicated in chromatin remodeling dynamics via 
protein partnering. Ubiquitin ligase and chromatin remodeling activities need 
not be mutually exclusive and both may function in DNA repair, transcriptional 
regulation, or cell cycle control. Here we highlight certain recent findings and 
currently unanswered questions regarding BRCA1 and BRCA2 in breast cancer.
