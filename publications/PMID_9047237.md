T cell activation stimulates p56(lck), p59(fyn), ZAP-70, Vav-SLP-76 binding, and 
IL-2 transcription. Major questions concern the tyrosine-kinase and relevant 
site(s) needed for Vav-SLP-76 complex formation and its role in IL-2 production. 
Here, we show that of the three kinases, only ZAP-70 phosphorylates SLP-76 at 
specific sites that allow Vav SH2 domain binding. Therefore, while p56(lck) 
regulates proximal events, ZAP-70 acts downstream on targets such as SLP-76. We 
also show by in vitro and in vivo analysis that two SLP-76 pYESP motifs (Y113 
and Y128) mediate binding, the first being more efficient. A third pYEPP motif 
(Y145) failed to bind. Finally, TCR zeta CD3 ligation of T cell hybridoma 
DC27.10 induces IL-2 production without detectable Vav-SLP-76 binding. 
Therefore, despite effects of Vav-SLP-76 on IL-2 expression, Vav-SLP-76 binding 
per se is not essential for IL-2 production in all T cells.
