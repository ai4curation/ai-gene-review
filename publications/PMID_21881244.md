Oral formulation of tissue kallikrein consists primarily of porcine pancreatic 
kallikrein (PPK) and is used to improve peripheral circulation, menopausal 
symptoms, and impaired chorioretinal circulation. Although gastrointestinal 
absorption of tissue kallikrein after oral administration has been reported in 
nonclinical and clinical studies, the increase in the concentration of 
pharmacologically active kinins, which are produced from kininogens by tissue 
kallikrein, has not been investigated. In this study, kallikrein formulation was 
orally administered to dogs and an increase in PPK in plasma was confirmed, 
along with an increase in the blood kinin level. After oral administration of 
kallikrein formulation (10 U/kg or 20 U/kg PPK) to dogs, PPK concentration in 
plasma reached maximum 3 h after administration, and then decreased 
time-dependently. The maximum concentration was 6.01 ± 1.44 pg/ml in the 10 U/kg 
group and 10.88 ± 3.59 pg/ml in the 20 U/kg group (mean ± S.E.M, n = 5). After 
oral administration of kallikrein formulation (40 U/kg PPK) to dogs, the blood 
kinin concentration in the PPK-treated group was significantly increased 2 h 
after administration as compared to the purified water-treated group (before 
administration: 48.8 ± 2.1 ng/ml vs. 48.1 ± 1.9 ng/ml, 2 h after administration: 
55.5 ± 1.6 ng/ml vs. 49.6 ± 1.4 ng/ml; mean ± S.E.M, n = 4, p < 0.05). In 
conclusion, PPK was considered to be absorbed after oral administration and to 
exert its pharmacological action via kinins produced by kininogen degradation in 
dogs.
