AIM: Most cancer cells acquire immortal capability by telomerase activation. The 
human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) is considered to be the 
major determinant of the enzymatic activity of human telomerase, and the hTERT 
promoter contains several c-Myc binding sites that mediate hTERT transcriptional 
activation. Few studies have examined the role of hTERT in hepatocarcinogenesis, 
and the relationship between c-Myc and telomerase in human hepatocellular 
carcinoma tissue is unknown.
METHODS: We measured hTERT mRNA levels and c-Myc oncoprotein expression in 57 
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma using in situ hybridization and 
immunohistochemistry, respectively. The transcription regulation of hTERT was 
evaluated by transient transfection of pGL3-1375 into the human hepatocellular 
carcinoma cell line J5. To determine the relationship between c-Myc and the 
hTERT promoter, a 1375-bp DNA fragment encompassing the promoter was placed 
upstream of the luciferase reporter gene and transiently transfected into the 
cell line. Two additional hTERT promoter constructs (-776 and -100 bp region) 
and an hTERT promoter-LUC construct containing 2 c-Myc mutations (pGL3-181 
MycMT) were also used for luciferase assays.
RESULTS: In 30 of 57 cases (52%), hTERT mRNA expression was associated with 
c-Myc protein expression. However, 16 of 57 cases (28%) showed strong hTERT mRNA 
detection without c-Myc protein expression, and 11 cases (19%) showed weak hTERT 
mRNA expression and strong c-Myc expression. Although luciferase activity was 
decreased between upstream 1 375 bp and 776 bp, there was no significant 
difference between upstream 776 bp and 100 bp. Finally, there was no significant 
decrease in activity after transfection of the hTERT promoter-LUC construct.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that c-Myc does not play a major role in gene 
regulation of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) in human 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Other regulatory elements or epigenetic phenomena 
should be further investigated to understand hTERT gene regulation in human 
hepatocellular carcinoma.
