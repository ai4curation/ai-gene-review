PTEN is a frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene that opposes the PI3K/AKT 
pathway through dephosphorylation of phosphoinositide-3,4,5-triphosphate. 
Recently, nuclear compartmentalization of PTEN was found as a key component of 
its tumor-suppressive activity; however its nuclear function remains poorly 
defined. Here we show that nuclear PTEN interacts with APC/C, promotes APC/C 
association with CDH1, and thereby enhances the tumor-suppressive activity of 
the APC-CDH1 complex. We find that nuclear exclusion but not phosphatase 
inactivation of PTEN impairs APC-CDH1. This nuclear function of PTEN provides a 
straightforward mechanistic explanation for the fail-safe cellular senescence 
response elicited by acute PTEN loss and the tumor-suppressive activity of 
catalytically inactive PTEN. Importantly, we demonstrate that PTEN mutant and 
PTEN null states are not synonymous as they are differentially sensitive to 
pharmacological inhibition of APC-CDH1 targets such as PLK1 and Aurora kinases. 
This finding identifies a strategy for cancer patient stratification and, thus, 
optimization of targeted therapies. PAPERCLIP:

INTRODUCTION

PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is amongst the most frequently lost or mutated tumor suppressors, with a frequency of monoallelic mutations estimated at 50–80% in endometrial carcinoma, glioblastoma and prostate cancer and at 30–50% in breast, colon and lung tumors ( Cairns et al., 1997 ; Feilotter et al., 1998 ; Gray et al., 1998 ; Li and Sun, 1997 ; Steck et al., 1997 ). Complete loss of PTEN is observed at highest frequencies in endometrial cancer and glioblastoma and is generally associated with metastatic cancers ( Ali et al., 1999 ; Salmena et al., 2008 ). Moreover, germline mutations of PTEN have been identified in cancer-susceptibility syndromes such as Cowden syndrome ( Di Cristofano et al., 1998 ; Eng, 2003 ).

PTEN can dephosphorylate phosphoinositide-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP 3 ), a potent activator of AKT ( Maehama and Dixon, 1998 ). Loss of PTEN function leads to derepression of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which stimulates cell growth and survival ( Stambolic et al., 1998 ; Sun et al., 1999 ). However, emerging evidence suggests that PTEN also has PI3K/AKT-independent functions ( Salmena et al., 2008 ). Furthermore, cells harboring phosphatase-inactive PTEN mutants retain residual tumor suppressive activity, leading to the hypothesis that PTEN exerts functions that are independent of its phosphatase activity ( Blanco-Aparicio et al., 2007 ; Georgescu et al., 2000 ; Gildea et al., 2004 ; Koul et al., 2002 ; Maier et al., 1999 ).

Early studies proposed that PTEN was exclusively cytoplasmic. However, recent reports clearly demonstrate that nuclear PTEN has important tumor suppressive function ( Fridberg et al., 2007 ; Perren et al., 2000 ; Whiteman et al., 2002 ; Zhou et al., 2002 ). Mechanistically, we have reported that ubiquitination of PTEN regulates its nuclear compartmentalization ( Song et al., 2008 ; Trotman et al., 2007 ). However, the tumor suppressive functions of PTEN within the nucleus still remain poorly defined.

Cell cycle progression is controlled by ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis of cell-cycle machinery. The two major E3 ubiquitin ligases controlling this process are SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein complex) and APC/C (Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome). SCF mainly controls target protein levels during S-phase, whereas APC/C is thought to be active from mitosis to late G1 ( Cardozo and Pagano, 2004 ; Peters, 2006 ). APC/C contains at least eleven different structural subunits and its activity is controlled through the binding of CDC20 and CDH1, which recognize and recruit specific substrates. CDC20 is active in early mitosis whereas CDH1 activity is restricted to late mitosis and G1 ( Pines, 2006 ; Sullivan and Morgan, 2007 ). Specific APC/C substrates include mitotic cyclins (Cyclin A and B), mitotic kinases (Aurora kinases, PLK1, Nek2A), proteins involved in chromosome segregation (Securin, Sgo1), DNA replication proteins (Geminin, Cdc6), a F-box protein (SKP2) and transcription factors (Ets2, FoxM1) ( Manchado et al., 2010 ; Wasch et al., 2010 ).

Of importance, APC-CDH1 substrates, such as Cyclin A, PLK1, Aurora A, CDC20 or SKP2, are overexpressed in human tumors and are associated with chromosomal instability and poor prognosis ( Carter et al., 2006 ). In mice, Cdh1 heterozygosity results in the development of epithelial tumors, suggesting that CDH1 may be a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor ( Garcia-Higuera et al., 2008 ). Down-regulation of CDH1 has been reported in many cancers, including those of prostate, ovary, liver and brain, and during the malignant progression of a B-cell lymphoma cell line ( Bassermann et al., 2008 ; Wang et al., 2000 ). Therefore, inactivation of APC-CDH1 in cancer may lead to unchecked accumulation of its targets with profound consequences for cell cycle and genomic stability.

In this study, we demonstrate that nuclear PTEN directly enhances the activity of APC/C by promoting its association with CDH1. Conversely, PTEN loss impairs the activity of the APC-CDH1 tumor suppressive complex. Critically, PTEN activates APC-CDH1 in a phosphatase-independent manner, an observation that has important implications for cancer therapy.

PTENloss but not inactivation of its phosphatase activity results in hypersensitivity to pharmacological inhibition of APC-CDH1 targets

Inhibition of APC-CDH1 targets, such as PLK1 or Aurora kinases, has been pursued as a therapeutic modality to treat human cancers due to the fact that APC-CDH1 activity is reduced in tumors ( Bassermann et al., 2008 ; Taylor and Peters, 2008 ). Indeed, PLK1 inhibitors as well as Aurora A inhibitors are currently being evaluated as anticancer agents ( Harrington et al., 2004 ; Strebhardt and Ullrich, 2006 ). In our study we have demonstrated that levels of PLK1 and Aurora A are elevated upon PTEN -loss in both asynchronous and synchronized conditions, suggesting that PTEN -deficient tumors might exhibit addiction to these kinases and hence hypersensitivity to their pharmacological inhibition. On the basis of the dispensability of the phosphatase activity of PTEN, we hypothesized that PTEN -deficient tumor cells would be more sensitive to such therapeutic approaches compared to phosphatase inactive PTEN mutant cells. To test this hypothesis, we first pharmacologically inhibited PLK1 in wild type and PTEN -null cells. Both human and murine Pten null cells were highly sensitive to PLK1 pharmacological inhibition by BI 2536, a PLK1 inhibitor ( Figures 7A and 7B , and Suppl. Figs. S7A and S7B ; PLK1 inhibition was directly measured by spindle assembly ( Suppl. Fig. S7C )). Importantly, the growth inhibitory effect of BI 2536 in PTEN -null cells was associated with an profound mitotic arrest followed by apoptosis, as measured by cleavage of Parp and Caspase-3 (Cpp32) ( Figures 7A , right panel and 7C ). Critically, reconstitution of PTEN -null cells with a phosphatase-inactive PTEN(C124S) significantly restored the resistance to pharmacological inhibition of PLK1 ( Figures 7B and 7C , and Suppl. Fig. S7D ). Similarly, PTEN -null cells were hypersensitive to Aurora A inhibition by VX680 (MK0457) ( Figures 7D and 7E , and Suppl. Figs. S7E and S7F ; Aurora A inhibition was directly measured by histone H3 phosphorylation on Ser10 ( Suppl. Fig. S7G )). Of note, Aurora A inhibition by VX680 in PTEN -null cells induced a robust accumulation of >4 N DNA content - as measured by flow cytometry - and subsequent apoptosis ( Figures 7D , right panel and 7F ). Importantly, the sensitivity of a phosphatase-inactive PTEN(C124S)-expressing cells to VX680 was similar to that of wild-type PTEN-expressing cells ( Figures 7E and 7F , and Suppl. Fig. S7H ). Taken together, these data suggest that PTEN -loss but not phosphatase inactivation results in hypersensitivity to pharmacological inhibition of APC-CDH1 targets, PLK1 and Aurora A.

DISCUSSION

Our findings allow us to reach a number of relevant conclusions:

Firstly, we have identified a novel mechanism by which PTEN exerts its tumor-suppressive function within the nucleus by regulating the assembly and activity of APC-CDH1. While high concentrations of nuclear PTEN is associated with G0/G1 phase and differentiated cells, lower concentrations of nuclear PTEN level is observed during S phase and highly proliferating advanced tumors ( Gimm et al., 2000 ; Ginn-Pease and Eng, 2003 ; Perren et al., 2000 ). Furthermore, Pten and Cdh1 are haploinsufficient tumor suppressors in the mouse and their heterozygous loss leads to diverse cancers, including cancers of the prostate and breast ( Garcia-Higuera et al., 2008 ; Salmena et al., 2008 ). By contrast, complete acute loss of either tumor suppressor triggers a cellular senescence response ( Chen et al., 2005 ; Li et al., 2008 ). In this study, we have demonstrated that Pten -loss induced senescence is dependent on the Cdh1-Ets2-p16 pathway. On the basis of these data, we propose that PTEN loss elicits a potent senescence response through both phosphatase-dependent (superactivation of a PI3K/mTOR/p53 pathway ( Alimonti et al., 2010 ; Chen et al., 2005 )) and phosphatase-independent (loss of APC-CDH1 function, unrelated to Arf or p53/p21 pathway) activities, in turn highlighting the complexity of the dose-dependent tumor promoting and fail safe cellular responses evoked by PTEN loss ( Fig. 7G ).

Secondly, p we find that the novel function of nuclear PTEN presented herein is independent of its phosphatase activity. Cytoplasmic but not nuclear pools of PIP3 are sensitive to catalysis by PTEN, implying a potential role for nuclear PTEN beyond its phosphatase activity ( Lindsay et al., 2006 ). Indeed, growth inhibitory effects of nuclear PTEN are likely not mediated directly through PI3K/AKT pathway ( Blanco-Aparicio et al., 2007 ; Liu et al., 2005 ). Since APC3 is highly phosphorylated on multiple residues in mitosis ( Kraft et al., 2003 ), one could suspect that PTEN may be a potential phosphatase for APC3. However, in mitotic cells we did not observe dephosphorylation of APC3 by PTEN neither in vivo nor in vitro (M.S.S. and P.P.P, unpublished data), and in addition, a catalytically inactive form of PTEN is fully functional towards APC. Overall, the phosphatase-independent activity of nuclear PTEN towards APC-CDH1 provides a straightforward explanation for the remnant tumor suppressive activity associated with the phosphatase inactive PTEN (C124S) mutation.

Finally, we have demonstrated that PTEN -deficient and PTEN -mutant cancer cells are differentially sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of PLK1 and Aurora A. Thus, our study indicates that patients with cancers harboring complete PTEN -loss may benefit from pharmacological targeting of APC-CDH1 pathway, while we predict mutant PTEN tumors to be much less sensitive. The APC-CDH1 targets, PLK1 and Aurora kinases are over-expressed in human tumors and this has prognostic and therapeutic potential in cancers ( Meraldi et al., 2004 ; Strebhardt and Ullrich, 2006 ). Clinical trials in cancer patients are currently underway to test the effects of various PLK1 and Aurora A inhibitors as monotherapy or in combination with conventional chemotherapy. For example, phase II trials of BI 2536 in advanced SCLC, NSCLC and AML, and phase II trials of VX680 (MK0457) in CML are currently ongoing (weblink: http://www.cancer.gov ). It has been recently reported that oncogenic Ras activation engages the cells to be hypersensitive (synthetic lethal) to various mitotic inhibitors including BI 2536 ( Luo et al., 2009 ). By contrast, and in full agreement with our findings, oncogenic PI3K activation does not respond to PLK1 inhibition, suggesting that PTEN -loss driven hypersensitivity to inhibition of PLK1 and Aurora A is unlikely due to PI3K/AKT pathway ( Luo et al., 2009 ). Hence, our findings provide a rationale for cancer patient stratification based on PTEN- loss vs. PTEN mutation towards the optimization of targeted therapies. This principle is of great importance given the widespread incidence of these two states of PTEN gene disruption in human cancer. Furthermore, since the functions of PTEN towards PI3K/AKT signaling and APC-CDH1 pathway are uncoupled, it is tempting to speculate that combinatorial therapy with PLK1/Aurora kinases and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors may be an effective approach in PTEN -null cancers.
