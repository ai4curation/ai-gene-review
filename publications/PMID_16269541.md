Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) cause late-onset 
Parkinson's disease (PD) with a clinical appearance indistinguishable from 
idiopathic PD. Initial studies suggest that LRRK2 mutations are the most common 
yet identified determinant of PD susceptibility, transmitted in an 
autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance. Herein, we characterize the LRRK2 gene 
and transcript in human brain and subclone the predominant ORF. Exogenously 
expressed LRRK2 protein migrates at approximately 280 kDa and is present largely 
in the cytoplasm but also associates with the mitochondrial outer membrane. 
Familial-linked mutations G2019S or R1441C do not have an obvious effect on 
protein steady-state levels, turnover, or localization. However, in vitro kinase 
assays using full-length recombinant LRRK2 reveal an increase in activity caused 
by familial-linked mutations in both autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation 
of a generic substrate. These results suggest a gain-of-function mechanism for 
LRRK2-linked disease with a central role for kinase activity in the development 
of PD.
