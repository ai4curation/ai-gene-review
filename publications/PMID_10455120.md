Using a cross-linking approach, we have analyzed the function of Skp, a presumed 
molecular chaperone of the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli, during the 
biogenesis of an outer membrane protein (OmpA). Following its transmembrane 
translocation, OmpA interacts with Skp in close vicinity to the plasma membrane. 
In vitro, Skp was also found to bind strongly and specifically to pOmpA nascent 
chains after their release from the ribosome suggesting the ability of Skp to 
recognize early folding intermediates of outer membrane proteins. Pulse labeling 
of OmpA in spheroplasts prepared from an skp null mutant revealed a specific 
requirement of Skp for the release of newly translocated outer membrane proteins 
from the plasma membrane. Deltaskp mutant cells are viable and show only slight 
changes in the physiology of their outer membranes. In contrast, double mutants 
deficient both in Skp and the periplasmic protease DegP (HtrA) do not grow at 37 
degrees C in rich medium. We show that in the absence of an active DegP, a lack 
of Skp leads to the accumulation of protein aggregates in the periplasm. 
Collectively, our data demonstrate that Skp is a molecular chaperone involved in 
generating and maintaining the solubility of early folding intermediates of 
outer membrane proteins in the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria.
