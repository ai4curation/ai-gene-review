Inhibition of tumor growth by thrombospondin (TSP) 1 is generally attributed to 
its antiangiogenic activity, but effects on tumor immunity should also be 
considered. We show that overexpression of TSP1 in melanoma cells increases 
macrophage recruitment into xenograft tumors grown in nude or beige/nude mice. 
In vitro, TSP1 acutely induces expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 
(PAI-1) by monocytic cells, suggesting that TSP1-induced macrophage recruitment 
is at least partially mediated by PAI-1. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) can 
either promote or limit tumor progression. The percentage of M1-polarized 
macrophages expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase is increased in 
TSP1-expressing tumors. Furthermore, soluble TSP1 stimulates killing of breast 
carcinoma and melanoma cells by IFN-gamma-differentiated U937 cells in vitro via 
release of reactive oxygen species. TSP1 causes a significant increase in 
phorbol ester-mediated superoxide generation from differentiated monocytes by 
interaction with alpha(6)beta(1) integrin through its NH(2)-terminal region. The 
NH(2)-terminal domain of TSP2 also stimulates monocyte superoxide production. 
Extracellular calcium is required for the TSP1-induced macrophage respiratory 
burst. Thus, TSP1 may play an important role in antitumor immunity by enhancing 
recruitment and activation of M1 TAMs, which provides an additional selective 
pressure for loss of TSP1 and TSP2 expression during tumor progression.

Abstract

Inhibition of tumor growth by thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is generally attributed to its anti-angiogenic activity, but effects on tumor immunity should also be considered. We show that over-expression of TSP1 in melanoma cells increases macrophage recruitment into xenograft tumors grown in nude or beige/nude mice. In vitro, TSP1 acutely induces expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by monocytic cells, suggesting that TSP1-induced macrophage recruitment is at least partially mediated by PAI-1. Tumor-associated macrophages can either promote or limit tumor progression. The percentage of M1 polarized macrophages expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase is increased in TSP1-expressing tumors. Furthermore, soluble TSP1 stimulates killing of breast carcinoma and melanoma cells by interferon-γ-differentiated U937 cells in vitro via release of reactive oxygen species. TSP1 causes a significant increase in phorbol ester-mediated superoxide generation from differentiated monocytes by interaction with α6β1 integrin through its N-terminal region. The N-terminal domain of thrombospondin-2 also stimulates monocyte superoxide production. Extracellular calcium is required for the TSP1-induced macrophage respiratory burst. Thus, TSP1 may play an important role in anti-tumor immunity by enhancing recruitment and activation of M1 tumor-associated macrophages, which provides an additional selective pressure for loss of TSP1 and thrombospondin-2 expression during tumor progression.

Introduction

Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is a secreted glycoprotein that is predominantly stored in platelets but also secreted at low levels by many cell types including monocytes and macrophages. TSP1 is rapidly and transiently released in response to tissue injury and is elevated in several chronic diseases ( 1 , 2 ). TSP1-null mice display acute and chronic inflammatory pulmonary infiltrates, and an elevated number of circulating white blood cells ( 3 ), suggesting an anti-inflammatory role. In contrast, TSP1 expression in ischemic injuries limits tissue survival and restoration of perfusion by blocking NO/cGMP signaling ( 4 ). The diverse biological activities of TSP1 are mediated by its multiple functional domains that engage corresponding receptors expressed by a variety of cells. Differential expression or activation of cell surface receptors for TSP1 including integrins, CD36, CD47, low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein, proteoglycans, and sulfatides may dictate the specific responses of each cell type to TSP1 ( 5 ).

TSP1 plays several roles in the physiological functions of phagocytes. TSP1 mediates phagocytosis of neutrophils undergoing apoptosis ( 6 ). Macrophage recognition and phagocytosis of apoptotic fibroblasts requires fibroblast-derived TSP1 and CD36 ( 7 ). CD36-deficient patients have impaired oxidized LDL-induced NFκB activation and subsequent cytokine expression ( 8 ). TSP1 modulates expression of IL-6 and IL-10 by monocytes ( 9 ) and activation of latent TGFβ ( 3 ). TSP1 stimulates motility of human neutrophils ( 10 , 11 ) and promotes chemotaxis and haptotaxis of human peripheral blood monocytes ( 12 ). In addition, TSP1 enhances cytokine-induced respiratory burst of human neutrophils ( 13 ) and enhances chemoattractant FMLP-mediated superoxide anion (O 2 − ) generation by human neutrophils through its N-terminal domain ( 14 , 15 ). However, the underlying mechanism for regulation of O 2 − generation has not been delineated. Here, we provide evidence that soluble TSP1 causes a significant increase in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-mediated O 2 − generation from interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-differentiated human monocytes by interaction with α6β1 integrin through its N-terminal region and identify a requirement for extracellular calcium to mediate the macrophage respiratory burst.

Macrophages are an important effector cell of innate immunity against tumors. However, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can differentiate into either cytotoxic (M1) or tumor growth-promoting (M2) states. This differentiation depends on the tissue microenvironment ( 16 ). Macrophages are classically activated toward the M1 phenotype by IFN-γ alone or in concert with microbial products. Alternative activation by stimulation with interleukin (IL)-4 or IL-13, IL-10, IL-21, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), immune complexes, and glucocorticoids drives macrophages toward the M2 phenotype ( 17 ). M2 macrophages are present in most established tumors and promote tumor progression ( 18 ).

TSP1 is often down-regulated during tumor progression and inhibits tumor growth when re-expressed ( 19 ). This activity is generally attributed to angiogenesis inhibition, but the above results suggest that effects on tumor immunity should also be considered. The current study demonstrates an important role for TSP1 as a positive modulator of innate anti-tumor immunity by increasing macrophage recruitment and stimulating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated tumor cytotoxicity.

Discussion

Several studies have suggested that TSP1 plays an important role in the recruitment of monocytes and macrophages to sites of tissue injury or inflammation ( 1 , 12 ). Here we provide evidence that over-expression of TSP1 in tumors increases macrophage recruitment in vivo . Tumor cells produce a range of chemotactic factors for macrophages. MCP-1 stimulates recruitment of macrophages into tumors in vivo ( 46 ), and decreased expression of this chemokines was reported to limit infiltration of macrophages into an excisional wound in TSP1 null mice ( 1 ). However, soluble TSP1 did not increase MCP-1 release from differentiated U937 human monocytic cells. PAI-1 is also required for cell migration in vitro ( 33 ), and evidence is emerging for a critical role of PAI-1 in macrophage migration in vitro and in vivo ( 32 ). TSP1 up-regulates PAI-1 in pancreatic cancer cells ( 47 ), and PAI-1 expression is up-regulated in TSP1-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells ( 34 ). We found that TSP1 acutely increased PAI-1 production by differentiated human and mouse macrophages, and strong TAM expression of PAI-1 was observed in TSP1 over-expressing tumors in vivo . This acute change in PAI-1 expression in response to TSP1 is at least partially TGFβ-mediated. Activation of latent TGFβ is mediated by the type 1 repeats of TSP1, but we found no induction of PAI-1 by this domain. Therefore, TSP1 probably induces PAI-1 via bound active TGFβ rather than activation of latent TGFβ produced by U937 cells. Although additional cytokines may be involved, autocrine induction of PAI-1 via tumor-cell produced TSP1 as well as paracrine induction of PAI-1 expression in TAMs could increase macrophage recruitment into the tumor.

Whether increased macrophage recruitment inhibits or enhances tumor growth depends on their differentiation state. The tumor environment can educate TAMs toward a tumor-promoting phenotype (M2) ( 18 ), which may prevent further macrophage migration within the tumor and ensure constant production of growth and angiogenic factors. In addition to contributing to macrophage infiltration by stimulating PAI-1 signaling in TAMs, we found that TSP1 expression in the tumor selectively increases M1 macrophage infiltration. This may provide a selective pressure distinct from its anti-angiogenic activity to account for the frequently observed down-regulation of TSP1 during tumor progression and its ability to inhibit tumor growth when re-expressed.

In general, M1 macrophages are efficient producers of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates that mediate resistance against tumors ( 17 ). Here we provide evidence that tumor expression of TSP1 increases M1 polarization of TAMs assessed by iNOS expression. TSP1 was previously shown to enhance cytokine- and chemoattractant fMLP-induced respiratory burst in human neutrophils ( 13 , 14 ). We now demonstrate that TSP1 enhances PMA-mediated respiratory burst in U937 cells differentiated along an M1 pathway using IFN-γ. TSP1 stimulates the cytotoxic activity of differentiated human U937 cells and murine ANA-1 cells against several human breast carcinoma and melanoma cell lines. This contrasts with the reported activity of U937 cells to support tumor growth in an M2 manner when co-injected with prostate carcinoma cells ( 48 ). We found no effect of TSP1 on M2 differentiation of these cells in vitro. Therefore, U937 monocytes have the capacity to differentiate along both pathways, but TSP1 selectively enhances the cytotoxic effector function of M1 macrophages.

The N-terminal domains of TSP1 and TSP2 are sufficient for this priming activity but not for PAI-1 induction. The N-terminal domain of TSP1 mediates interactions with several integrin and non-integrin receptors ( 40 ). Differentiated U937 cells express α4β1 ( 42 ) and α6β1 integrins, and inhibition of α6β1 using a TSP1 peptide or a function-blocking α6β1 antibody provide evidence that this integrin mediates intracellular signaling pathways leading to increased O 2 − production.

Interactions between integrins and their ligands can trigger transient elevation in intracellular free Ca 2+ ( 43 , 44 ), and Ca 2+ is a well known intracellular second messenger for signaling the generation of O 2 − in human monocytes ( 45 ). We found that addition of TSP1 to differentiated U937 cells caused a significant increase in intracellular free Ca 2+ , and that chelation of extracellular Ca 2+ inhibits the stimulatory effect of TSP1 on mobilization of intracellular Ca 2+ and PMA-mediated O 2 − generation in differentiated U937 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that a Ca 2+ -dependent mechanism is involved in TSP1 modulation of the macrophage respiratory burst. However, we can not exclude the possibility that additional receptors recognized by the N-domains of TSP1 might contribute to O 2 − production by macrophages. It is interesting that the N-terminal region of TSP2 shares this activity to stimulate O 2 − production by macrophages. Loss of TSP2 has also been noted with progression in some cancers, and over-expression of TSP2 limits tumor growth in murine models ( 19 ). Our data suggests this may involve both suppression of angiogenesis and enhancement of innate anti-tumor immunity.

Soluble TSP1 at 5 μg/ml was sufficient to increase U937-mediated cytotoxicity in all tumor cell targets tested. TSP1 was also reported to directly induce death of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells when used at 10 μg/ml for 24 h ( 49 ). Our results using a cytotoxicity assay based on LDH release showed minimal cytotoxic activity of soluble TSP1 against MDA-MB-231 cells, even after 72 h of incubation. Our data indicates that TSP1 stimulates macrophage-mediated tumor cell death due to accumulation of ROS. Physiologic doses of O 2 − generated using xanthine/xanthine oxidase were sufficient to inhibit MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell viability.

In conclusion, the data presented here demonstrate that stimulation of M1 differentiated human monocytic cells with TSP1enhances tumor cell killing in vitro via production of reactive oxygen intermediates. In vivo, TSP1 promotes M1 macrophage recruitment into tumors while decreasing tumor growth. Clearly, TSP1 can also inhibit tumor growth via its anti-angiogenic activity, but our results suggest that TSP1 plays an additional role in tumor immunity by increasing M1 macrophage recruitment and cytotoxicity. Avoiding this innate immune surveillance could provide a second selective pressure to reduce TSP1 expression during tumor progression.
