The multi-step biosynthesis of the [NiFe]-hydrogenase enzyme involves a variety 
of accessory proteins. To further understand this process, a Strep-tag II 
variant of the large subunit of Escherichia coli hydrogenase 3, HycE, was 
constructed to enable isolation of protein complexes. A complex with SlyD, a 
chaperone protein implicated in hydrogenase production through association with 
the nickel-binding accessory protein HypB, was observed. A SlyD-HycE interaction 
preceding both iron and nickel insertion to the enzyme was detected, mediated by 
the chaperone domain of SlyD, and independent of HypB. These results support a 
model of several roles for SlyD during hydrogenase maturation.
