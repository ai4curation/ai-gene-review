Coupling the production of mature gametes and fertilized zygotes to favorable 
nutritional conditions improves reproductive success. In invertebrates, the 
proliferation of female germline stem cells is regulated by nutritional status. 
However, in mammals, the number of female germline stem cells is set early in 
development, with oocytes progressing through meiosis later in life. Mechanisms 
that couple later steps of oogenesis to environmental conditions remain largely 
undefined. We show that, in the presence of food, the DAF-2 insulin-like 
receptor signals through the RAS-ERK pathway to drive meiotic prophase I 
progression and oogenesis; in the absence of food, the resultant inactivation of 
insulin-like signaling leads to downregulation of the RAS-ERK pathway, and 
oogenesis is stalled. Thus, the insulin-like signaling pathway couples nutrient 
sensing to meiotic I progression and oocyte production in C. elegans, ensuring 
that oocytes are only produced under conditions favorable for the survival of 
the resulting zygotes.
