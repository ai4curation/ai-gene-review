The hepatitis C virus is associated with the development of liver cirrhosis and 
hepatocellular carcinomas. Among the 10 polyproteins produced by the virus, no 
function has been clearly assigned to the non-structural 5A (NS5A) protein. This 
study was designed to identify the hepatocellular proteins that interact with 
NS5A of the HCV. Yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed with a human liver 
cDNA prey-library, using five different NS5A derivatives as baits, the 
full-length NS5A (NS5A-F, amino acid (aa) 1 approximately 447) and its four 
different derivatives, denoted as NS5A-A (aa 1 approximately 150), -B (aa 1 
approximately 300), -C (aa 300 approximately 447) and D (aa 150 approximately 
447). NS5A-F, NS5A-B and NS5A-C gave two, two and 10 candidate clones, 
respectively, including an AHNAK-related protein, the secreted frizzled-related 
protein 4 (SFRP4), the N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), the cellular 
retinoic acid binding protein 1 (CRABP-1), ferritin heavy chain (FTH1), 
translokin, tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TACSTD2), 
phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) and centaurindelta 2 (CENTdelta2). However, 
NS5A-A produced no candidates and NS5A-D was not suitable as bait due to 
transcriptional activity. Based on an in vitro binding assay, CRABP-1, PI4K, 
CENTdelta2 and two unknown fusion proteins with maltose binding protein (MBP), 
were confirmed to interact with the glutathione S-transferase (GST)/NS5A fusion 
protein. Furthermore, the interactions of CRABP-1, PI4K and CENTdelta2 were not 
related to the PXXP motif (class II), as judged by a domain analysis. While 
their biological relevance is under investigation, the results contribute to a 
better understanding of the possible role of NS5A in hepatocellular signaling 
pathways.
