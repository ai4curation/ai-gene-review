Nemaline myopathies (NEMs) are genetically and clinically heterogenous. 
Biallelic or monoallelic variants in TNNT1, encoding slow skeletal troponin T1 
(TnT1), cause NEM. We report a 2-year-old patient and his mother carrying the 
heterozygous TNNT1 variant c.194A>C/p.(Asp65Ala) that occurred de novo in the 
mother. Both had muscle hypotrophy and muscle weakness. Muscle pathology in the 
proband's mother revealed slow twitch type 1 fiber hypotrophy and fast twitch 
type 2 fiber hypertrophy that was confirmed by a reduced ratio of slow skeletal 
myosin to fast skeletal myosin type 2a. Reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction and immunoblotting data demonstrated increased levels of 
high-molecular-weight TnT1 isoforms in skeletal muscle of the proband's mother 
that were also observed in some controls. In an overexpression system, complex 
formation of TnT1-D65A with tropomyosin 3 (TPM3) was enhanced. The previously 
reported TnT1-E104V and TnT1-L96P mutants showed reduced or no 
co-immunoprecipitation with TPM3. Our studies support pathogenicity of the TNNT1 
p.(Asp65Ala) variant.
