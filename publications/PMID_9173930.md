Prion diseases are disorders of protein conformation that produce 
neurodegeneration in humans and animals. Studies of transgenic (Tg) mice 
indicate that a factor designated protein X is involved in the conversion of the 
normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) into the scrapie isoform (PrPSc); protein X 
appears to interact with PrPC but not with PrPSc. To search for PrPC binding 
proteins, we fused PrP with alkaline phosphatase (AP) to produce a soluble, 
secreted probe. PrP-AP was used to screen a lambdagt11 mouse brain cDNA library, 
and six clones were isolated. Four cDNAs are novel while two clones are 
fragments of Nrf2 (NF-E2 related factor 2) transcription factor and Aplp1 
(amyloid precursor-like protein 1). The observation that PrP binds to a member 
of the APP (amyloid precursor protein) gene family is intriguing, in light of 
possible relevance to Alzheimer's disease. Four of the isolated clones are 
expressed preferentially in the mouse brain and encode a similar motif.
