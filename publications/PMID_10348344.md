pre-mRNA processing/stability in malignant human neuroblasts.

N-myc gene copy numbers and transcription rates are similar in N (neuroblastic, 
tumorigenic) and S (non-neuronal, non-tumorigenic) neuroblastoma cells with 
chromosomally integrated amplified N-myc genes. However, N cells show 
significantly higher N-myc mRNA levels than S cells. Therefore, 
post-transcriptional control of N-myc gene expression must differ between these 
cell types. Since no differences in N-myc mRNA half-life were found between N 
and S cells from two cell lines, steady-state levels of N-myc pre-mRNA 
processing intermediates were analysed. Results suggest that the differences in 
N-myc expression arise primarily at the nuclear post-transcriptional level. The 
neuronal-specific RNA-binding Hu proteins are present in cytoplasmic and nuclear 
fractions of N cells and one of them, HuD, binds specifically to both exonic and 
intronic N-myc RNA sequences. In sense and antisense HuD-transfected N cells, 
there are coordinate changes in HuD and N-myc expression levels. Thus, we 
propose that HuD plays a role in the nuclear processing/stability of N-myc 
pre-mRNA in N-type neuroblastoma cells.
