Abnormalities in posttranslational protein modifications (PTMs) that regulate 
protein targeting, trafficking, synthesis, and function have been implicated in 
the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains 
specialized machinery that facilitate protein synthesis, ER entry and exit, 
quality control, and post-translational processing, steps required for protein 
maturation. Dysregulation of these systems could represent potential mechanisms 
for abnormalities of neurotransmitter associated proteins in schizophrenia. We 
hypothesized that expression of ER processing pathways is dysregulated in 
schizophrenia. We characterized protein and complex expression of essential 
components from protein folding, ER quality control (ERQC), and ER associated 
degradation (ERAD) processes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 12 matched 
pairs of elderly schizophrenia and comparison subjects. We found increased 
expression of proteins associated with recognizing and modifying misfolded 
proteins, including UDP-glucose/glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 2 (UGGT2), ER 
degradation enhancing alpha-mannosidase like protein 2 (EDEM2), and synoviolin 
(SYVN1)/HRD1. As SYVN1/HRD1 is a component of the ubiquitin ligase HRD1-SEL1L 
complex that facilitates ERAD, we immunoprecipitated SEL1L and measured 
expression of other proteins in this complex. In schizophrenia, SYVN1/HRD1 and 
OS-9, ERAD promoters, have increased association with SEL1L, while XTP3-B, which 
can prevent ERAD of substrates, has decreased association. Abnormal expression 
of proteins associated with ERQC and ERAD suggests dysregulation in ER localized 
protein processing pathways in schizophrenia. Interestingly, the deficits we 
found are not in the protein processing machinery itself, but in proteins that 
recognize and target incompletely or misfolded proteins. These changes may 
reflect potential mechanisms of abnormal neurotransmitter associated protein 
expression previously observed in schizophrenia.
