Cryptochrome (CRY) is a blue-light sensitive flavoprotein that functions as the 
primary circadian photoreceptor in Drosophila melanogaster. The mechanism by 
which it transmits the light signal to the core clock circuitry is not known. We 
conducted in vitro studies on the light-induced conformational change in CRY and 
its effect on protein-protein interaction and performed in vivo analysis of the 
lifetime of the signaling state of the protein to gain some insight into the 
mechanism of phototransduction. We find that exposure of CRY to blue light 
induces a conformation similar to that of the constitutively active CRY mutant 
with a C-terminal deletion (CRYΔ). This light-induced conformation has a 
half-life of ∼15 min in the dark at 25 °C and is characterized by increased 
affinity to Jetlag E3 ligase. In vivo analysis reveals that in the Drosophila S2 
cell line, the signaling state induced by a millisecond light exposure has a 
half-life of 27 min in the dark at 0 °C during which period it is susceptible to 
degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These findings lead to a 
plausible model for circadian photoreception/phototransduction in Drosophila.
