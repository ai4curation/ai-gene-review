Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are major determinants of gene silencing and 
epigenetic memory in higher eukaryotes. Here, we systematically mapped the human 
PcG complexome using a robust affinity purification mass spectrometry approach. 
Our high-density protein interaction network uncovered a diverse range of PcG 
complexes. Moreover, our analysis identified PcG interactors linking them to the 
PcG system, thus providing insight into the molecular function of PcG complexes 
and mechanisms of recruitment to target genes. We identified two human PRC2 
complexes and two PR-DUB deubiquitination complexes, which contain the O-linked 
N-acetylglucosamine transferase OGT1 and several transcription factors. Finally, 
genome-wide profiling of PR-DUB components indicated that the human PR-DUB and 
PRC1 complexes bind distinct sets of target genes, suggesting differential 
impact on cellular processes in mammals.
