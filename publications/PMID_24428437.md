Heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70)-peptide complexes are involved in MHC class I- and 
II-restricted antigen presentation, enabling enhanced activation of T cells. As 
shown previously, mammalian cytosolic Hsp70 (Hsc70) molecules interact 
specifically with HLA-DR molecules. This interaction might be of significance as 
Hsp70 molecules could transfer bound antigenic peptides in a ternary complex 
into the binding groove of HLA-DR molecules. The present study provides new 
insights into the distinct interaction of Hsp70 with HLA-DR molecules. Using a 
quantitative binding assay, it could be demonstrated that a point mutation of 
amino acids alanine 406 and valine 438 in the substrate binding pocket led to 
reduced peptide binding compared with the wild-type Hsp70 whereas HLA-DR binding 
remains unaffected. The removal of the C-terminal lid neither altered the 
substrate binding capacity nor the Hsp70 binding characteristics to HLA-DR. A 
truncated variant lacking the nucleotide binding domain showed no binding 
interactions with HLA-DR. Furthermore, the truncated ATPase subunit of 
constitutively expressed Hsc70 revealed similar binding affinities to HLA-DR 
compared with the complete Hsc70. Hence, it can be assumed that the Hsp70-HLA-DR 
interaction takes place outside the peptide binding groove and is attributed to 
the ATPase domain of HSP70 molecules. The Hsp70-chaperoned peptides might 
thereby be directly transferred into the binding groove of HLA-DR, so enabling 
enhanced presentation of the peptide on antigen-presenting cells and leading to 
an improved proliferation of responding T cells as shown previously.
