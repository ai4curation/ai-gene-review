By means of amino acid sequence alignment with class A beta-lactamases, the 
residues essential for the catalytic activity of the peptidoglycan 
transpeptidase of penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2) have been predicted to be 
Lys333, Asp447, and Lys544, in addition to the acylation site residue for the 
acyl-enzyme mechanism, Ser330. Accordingly, these residues were replaced by 
site-directed mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants were examined as to 
penicillin-binding activity and genetic complementation, which represent only 
the acylation step and the total reaction during transpeptidation, respectively. 
All the mutants at position 333 showed the complete loss of both the binding and 
complementation activities. Most of the mutants at position 447 retained the 
binding activity but lost the complementation activity, the exception being the 
D447E mutant, which retained both. The binding rates for various penicillins of 
the D447N mutant, which had lost the complementation activity, were almost 
identical to those of the wild type. The binding of the mutants at position 544 
tended to require a higher penicillin concentration, and that of the K544H 
mutant required a lower pH. When the roles of the counterpart residues, Lys73, 
Glu166, and Lys234, in class A beta-lactamases were considered, the results 
suggested that Lys333 and Asp447 are essential for the acylation and 
acyl-transfer steps, respectively, and that Lys544 stabilizes the Michaelis 
complex through its side-chain positive charge.
