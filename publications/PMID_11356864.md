The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene encodes a large tumor suppressor protein 
(neurofibromin). Although it is known to possess Ras GTPase-activating protein 
(GAP) activity, the cellular role of neurofibromin remains unclear. Here we used 
yeast two-hybrid screening to identify neurofibromin-interacting proteins. 
Syndecan-2, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), was isolated as 
a binding partner for two distinct regions of the neurofibromin protein. We 
subsequently found that neurofibromin can bind all four mammalian syndecans. NF1 
interaction requires the transmembrane domain and a membrane-proximal region of 
the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan, but not the C terminus of syndecan known to 
bind to CASK, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK). Neurofibromin, 
syndecans, and CASK have overlapping subcellular distributions in axons and 
synapses of neurons, as shown by biochemical fractionation and immunostaining. 
Moreover, neurofibromin exists in a complex with syndecan and CASK in vivo, as 
evidenced by their coimmunoprecipitation from rat brain. Our findings suggest 
that interaction with different members of the syndecan family may be a 
mechanism for localizing neurofibromin to specialized domains of the plasma 
membrane.

Abstract

The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene encodes a large tumor suppressor protein (neurofibromin). Although it is known to possess Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, the cellular role of neurofibromin remains unclear. Here we used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify neurofibromin-interacting proteins. Syndecan-2, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), was isolated as a binding partner for two distinct regions of the neurofibromin protein. We subsequently found that neurofibromin can bind all four mammalian syndecans. NF1 interaction requires the transmembrane domain and a membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan, but not the C terminus of syndecan known to bind to CASK, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK). Neurofibromin, syndecans, and CASK have overlapping subcellular distributions in axons and synapses of neurons, as shown by biochemical fractionation and immunostaining. Moreover, neurofibromin exists in a complex with syndecan and CASK in vivo , as evidenced by their coimmunoprecipitation from rat brain. Our findings suggest that interaction with different members of the syndecan family may be a mechanism for localizing neurofibromin to specialized domains of the plasma membrane.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Plasmid construction. Ten segments spanning the human neurofibromin coding region were amplified by using KlenTaq Advantage DNA polymerase with Marathon Ready human whole brain cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. The primers (sequences available on request) were engineered to contain Eco RI restriction sites. After purification and digestion these fragments were ligated into Eco RI-digested pBHA and validated by sequencing. Interstitial deletions of the syndecan-2 coding region were generated by overlap extension that used chimeric primers (sequences available on request). To construct synd-2C and C-terminal deletion mutants of syndecan-2 for yeast two-hybrid experiments, we PCR-amplified and subcloned the desired sequences of syndecan-2 into an Eco RI site of vector pGAD10 (Clontech). For construction of GST fusion proteins, the coding regions of rat syndecan-2 from amino acid residue 33 to the end (residue 211 for GST–synd-2 or residue 145 for GST–synd-2Δ65) were subcloned into an Eco RI site of vector pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ).

Antibodies. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies NF1GRP(D) and NF1GRP(N) were obtained from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit antibodies Syn-2C and Syn-3C that recognize the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-2 and syndecan-3, respectively, have been described previously ( Hsueh et al., 1998 ; Hsueh and Sheng, 1999 ). The CASK monoclonal antibody also has been described ( Hsueh and Sheng, 1999 ).

Yeast two-hybrid analysis. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was done by using the L40 yeast strain harboring reporter genes HIS3 and LacZ under the control of upstream LexA binding sites, as described previously ( Niethammer and Sheng, 1998 ). Bait constructs for each segment of the neurofibromin coding region were cotransfected into L40 yeast host with pGAD10-cloned cDNA libraries from adult and fetal human brain (Clontech). This yielded ∼4 × 10 − 6 transformants per bait–library combination. Colonies growing on histidine-deficient medium (supplemented with 2.5 m m 3-aminotriazole) and yielding a blue color with X-gal were selected for plasmid recovery.

For liquid culture assay 4 ml of fresh yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose (YPD) medium was added to 1 ml of overnight culture. The cultures were incubated at 30°C for a further 3.5 hr with shaking to reach OD 600 = 0.5–0.6. The exact OD 600 was recorded at the time of harvesting of the cells. Then 1 ml of culture was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, washed once with Z buffer, and resuspended in 0.1 ml Z buffer. Three freeze/thaw cycles were performed by using liquid nitrogen and a 37°C water bath to break down yeast cell walls. Then 0.7 ml of Z buffer containing 0.0027% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and 0.16 ml of 4 mg/ml o -nitrophenyl-β- d -galactopyranoside in Z buffer was added to each tube. After development of a yellow color, 0.4 ml of 1 m Na 2 CO 3 was added to the tubes. Incubation time was recorded in minutes. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the OD 420 of the supernatant was measured. Z buffer without yeast cells was used as a blank to calibrate the spectrophotometer. β-galactosidase units were calculated as (1000 × OD 420 )/(incubation time × OD 600 ).

Subcellular fractionation of rat brain extracts. Subcellular fractions of adult rat brain were prepared as described previously ( Huttner et al., 1983 ). Briefly, rat brain Dounce homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove nuclei and other large debris (pelleted in P1). The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g to obtain a crude synaptosomal fraction (P2), which subsequently was lysed with hypotonic buffer and centrifuged at 25,000 × g to pellet a lysed synaptosomal membrane fraction (LP1). Then the supernatant (LS1) was centrifuged at 165,000 × g to obtain a crude synaptic vesicle fraction (LP2) and soluble fraction (LS2). The supernatant above the P2 fraction was centrifuged at 165,000 × g to obtain a soluble fraction (S3) and a light membrane fraction (P3). For developmental studies the P2 fractions were collected from the rats at the ages of embryonic day 14 (E14) and E18 and postnatal day 3 (P3), P7, P15, P22, and P42.

GST pulldown assay and coimmunoprecipitation. One-week-old rat brains were minced and homogenized by Dounce homogenizer in PBS. Total homogenate was solubilized further with 1% Triton X-100 at 4°C for 1 hr. For GST pulldown assay the extract was diluted with sufficient PBS to reduce the final concentration of Triton X-100 to 0.25%. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 37,000 × g for 1 hr. Then the supernatant was incubated with glutathione agarose prebound with GST fusion protein for ∼4 hr at 4°C. Unbound proteins were removed by extensive washing, and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation of Triton X-100-solublized extract was performed as described previously ( Hsueh and Sheng, 1999 ), except that antibody NF1GRP(N) (Santa Cruz) was used for immunoprecipitation and antibody NF1GRP(D) (Santa Cruz) was used in immunoblotting.

Immunofluorescence staining. Double-label immunofluorescence that used rat brain with two antibodies raised in the same species was performed as described previously ( Hsueh et al., 1998 ). The procedure was modified slightly for the staining of cultured hippocampal neurons. Briefly, cultured neurons were washed three times with PBS and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde and 4% sucrose in PBS for 10 min. The cells were treated further with 3% H 2 O 2 in methanol at −20°C for 15 min. After 30 min of incubation in PBS with 0.5% blocking reagent (TSA fluorescence kit, NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) the cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml Syn-2C or Syn-3C antibodies for 2 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. (This concentration of primary antibody gives no detectable signal with conventional secondary antibody immunofluorescence protocols.) After being washed three times with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20), the cells were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (NEN Life Science Products) at room temperature for 1 hr and were incubated further with a 1:200 dilution of streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (TSA fluorescence kit, NEN Life Science Products) for 30 min. Finally, Cy3-conjugated tyramide (TSA fluorescence kit, NEN Life Science Products) was applied at a 1:100 dilution in amplification diluent (TSA fluorescence kit, NEN Life Science Products) for 10 min to visualize Syn-2C or Syn-3C staining. After being washed three times with PBST, these cells were processed for conventional neurofibromin immunofluorescence staining with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody as described previously ( Hsueh and Sheng, 1999 ). The results were analyzed with a confocal microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with a narrow bandpass filter, and digitized images were processed for publication with Adobe Photoshop (Mountainview, CA).
