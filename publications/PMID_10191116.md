Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease) is a progressive 
neurologic disorder which results from mutations in the CLN3 gene, which 
normally produces a 48-kDa polypeptide of unknown function. To help characterize 
the CLN3 protein, we have studied its tissue distribution and subcellular 
localization in human tissues using three epitope-specific polyclonal antibodies 
to human CLN3 by immunoblot, immunocytochemical, and immunoelectron microscopic 
analysis. The most abundant CLN3 protein expression was in the gray matter of 
the brain, where it was localized to astrocytes, capillary endothelium, and 
neurons. CLN3 was also evident in peripheral nerve, in pancreatic islet cells, 
and within the seminiferous tubules in the testis. Staining was generally 
diffuse within the cytoplasm with some nuclear reactivity. Subcellular 
localization identified the CLN3 protein within the nucleus and along cell 
membranes. These results were contrasted with the cellular distribution of 
palmitoyl-protein thioesterase (PPT), the enzyme whose deficiency is responsible 
for infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN1). PPT was most abundant in 
brain and visceral macrophages where it displayed a coarse granular staining 
pattern typical of lysosomal distribution. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed 
that PPT immunoreactivity was limited to lysosomes.
