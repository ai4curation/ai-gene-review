Elevated extracellular solute concentration (hyperosmotic stress) perturbs cell 
function and stimulates cell responses by evoking MAPK cascades and activating 
AP-1 transcription complex resulting in alterations of gene expression, cell 
cycle arrest, and apoptosis. The results presented here demonstrate that 
hyperosmotic stress elicited increases in ATF-2 phosphorylation through a novel 
Polo-like kinase 3 (Plk3) pathway in human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. We 
found in hyperosmotic stress-induced HCE cells that Plk3 transferred to the 
nuclear compartment and was colocalized with ATF-2 in nuclei. Kinase activity of 
Plk3 was significantly activated by hyperosmotic stimulation. Further 
downstream, active Plk3 phosphorylated ATF-2 at the Thr-71 site in vivo and in 
vitro. Overexpression of Plk3 and its mutants enhanced hyperosmotic 
stress-induced ATF-2 phosphorylation. In contrast, suppression of Plk3 by 
knocking down Plk3 mRNA effectively diminished the effect of hyperosmotic 
stress-induced ATF-2 phosphorylation. The effect of hyperosmotic stress-induced 
activation of Plk3 on ATF-2 transcription factor function was also examined in 
CRE reporter-overexpressed HCE cells. Our results for the first time reveal that 
hyperosmotic stress can activate the Plk3 signaling pathway that subsequently 
regulates the AP-1 complex by directly phosphorylating ATF-2 independent from 
the effects of JNK and p38 activation.
