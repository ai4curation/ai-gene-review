BACKGROUND: Although most circadian clock components are conserved between 
Drosophila and mammals, the roles assigned to the CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) proteins 
are very different: Drosophila CRY functions as a circadian photoreceptor, 
whereas mammalian CRY proteins (mCRY1 and 2) are transcriptional repressors 
essential for molecular clock oscillations.
RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that Drosophila CRY also functions as a 
transcriptional repressor. We found that RNA levels of genes directly activated 
by the transcription factors CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) are derepressed in 
cry(b) mutant eyes. Conversely, while overexpression of CRY and PERIOD (PER) in 
the eye repressed CLK/CYC activity, neither PER nor CRY repressed individually. 
Drosophila CRY also repressed CLK/CYC activity in cell culture. Repression by 
CRY appears confined to peripheral clocks, since neither cry(b) mutants nor 
overexpression of PER and CRY together in pacemaker neurons significantly 
affected molecular or behavioral rhythms. Increasing CLK/CYC activity by 
removing two repressors, PER and CRY, led to ectopic expression of the timeless 
clock gene, similar to overexpression of Clk itself.
CONCLUSIONS: Drosophila CRY functions as a transcriptional repressor required 
for the oscillation of peripheral circadian clocks and for the correct 
specification of clock cells.
