Sleep has been identified in all mammals and nonmammalian vertebrates that have 
been critically evaluated. In addition, sleep-like states have also been 
identified and described in several invertebrates. Despite this prevalence 
throughout the animal kingdom, the function of sleep remains a mystery. The 
completion of several genome sequencing projects has led to the expectation that 
fundamental aspects of sleep can be elucidated through genetic dissection. 
Indeed, studies in both the mouse and fly have begun to reveal tantalizing 
suggestions about the underlying principles that regulate sleep homeostasis. In 
this article we will review recent studies that have used genetic techniques to 
evaluate sleep in the fruit fly and the mouse.
