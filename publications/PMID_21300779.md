INTRODUCTION

The p53 ( TP53 ) tumor suppressor gene is a sequence-specific transcription factor that responds to a broad range of cellular stress signals and functions as a coordinator of cell fate decisions ( 33 ). Accordingly, p53 activity is attenuated in most human cancers, usually due to somatic missense mutations ( 8 ). p53 exerts its activity mainly by transactivating target genes; a few dozen of such targets were identified during the last 3 decades ( 35 ). Moreover, p53 can also repress the transcription of genes ( 7 ) and induce a variety of transactivation-independent responses ( 15 ). The identity of most p53-regulated genes that mediate processes such as cell cycle arrest, cell death, and DNA repair have been revealed. However, p53 also affects processes such as autophagy, differentiation, reproduction, metabolism, and aging ( 42 , 61 ), but the mediators of these effects are much less characterized.

The complicated process of spermatogenesis begins with proliferation of diploid spermatogonia and terminates with the production of haploid spermatozoa and involves tightly regulated steps of proliferation, meiosis, and differentiation. Spermatogenesis occurs within the seminiferous tubules in precisely timed and highly organized cycles ( 23 ). The process starts with diploid germ cells called spermatogonia that reside on the basement membrane. After a series of mitotic divisions, differentiating spermatogonia divide into spermatocytes, which can migrate to a more adluminal position of the seminiferous tubule. Spermatocytes undergo meiosis to form haploid round spermatids ( 22 ), which then undergo spermiogenesis, a process that includes morphological alterations such as acrosome formation, nuclear condensation, flagellum formation, and extrusion of residual cytoplasm, to form mature spermatozoa. Of note, germ cells in the seminiferous tubules are nursed by Sertoli cells ( 34 ).

The existence of p53 orthologs in lower organisms, such as worms and flies, which do not develop cancer, implies that tumor suppression does not represent the original function of p53. It has been suggested that the role of the p53 ancestral genes is to ensure the genomic integrity of the germ line and the fidelity of developmental processes ( 24 ). This role was conserved during evolution as p53 is important for normal differentiation and development in mammals and other higher organisms ( 42 ).

It has been found that p53, like many other proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, plays a role in the meiotic process of spermatogenesis ( 1 ). For instance, it was previously reported that during normal spermatogenesis, p53 mRNA and protein are accumulated in spermatocytes ( 55 ), and, similarly, p21 ( CDKN1A ), the primary p53 target gene that mediates cell-cycle arrest ( 13 ), is expressed during the prophase of meiosis ( 4 ). Several studies, including ours, demonstrate specific roles for p53 in spermatogenesis. For example, transgenic mice with partial or complete impairment of p53 expression exhibit a giant-cell degenerative syndrome ( 52 ), a phenomenon caused by an inability of primary tetraploid spermatocytes to undergo meiotic divisions. Moreover, p53 −/− 129/Sv mice are infertile although it is unclear whether this is due to spermatogenesis defects ( 19 ). The p53-dependent DNA damage response was shown to be highly active throughout spermatogenesis ( 45 ), and accordingly, p53 mediates stress-induced spermatogonial apoptosis after DNA damage ( 20 ). Conversely, p53 deficiency attenuates the regeneration of seminiferous tubules after irradiation ( 21 ). Moreover, p53 was shown to induce the expression of Wip1 in mouse testes, and Wip1 -null mice display degeneration of seminiferous tubules, reduced testis size, and attenuated fertility ( 10 ). Besides spermatogenesis, p53 is involved in additional aspects of reproduction, including implantation ( 25 ), and in a variety of embryonal development programs ( 42 ). Nevertheless, despite the general reduction in fecundity in p53-null mice and the increase in developmental defects, most p53-deficient mice survive, develop normally, and can reproduce ( 12 ). This may indicate an alternative pathway which can, at least partially, compensate for the loss of p53 in development and reproduction ( 51 ). Notably, it had been suggested that p53 family members, p63 and p73, can compensate for p53 loss in several processes, including DNA damage response ( 65 ), tumor suppression ( 14 ), and development ( 28 , 56 ).

Utilizing RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down p53 in WI-38 human embryonic fibroblasts, followed by global expression analysis ( 9 ), we identified the gene spermatogenesis-associated 18 homolog ( SPATA18 ) as a potential transcriptional target of p53. Our long interest in the role of p53 in spermatogenesis ( 1 , 52 , 55 ) and the putative functions of SPATA18 in this process had driven us to unveil the mechanism by which p53 regulates SPATA18 expression in vitro and in vivo . In humans, SPATA18 is localized on chromosome 4q12 and encodes a 538-amino acid (aa) protein with two coiled-coil domains. Although the function of SPATA18 in humans or in mouse is still unknown, its rat homolog, Spetex-1, which shares 82% identity in its protein sequence, was thoroughly characterized as a spermatogenesis-related protein. Specifically, Iida et al. had identified Spetex-1 , using a differential display approach, as a highly expressed gene in rat testis ( 27 ). Testicular Spetex-1 expression is detected first at 3 weeks of postnatal development and remains high until adulthood. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that Spetex-1 mRNA and protein are expressed in the cytoplasm of haploid spermatids and in residual bodies ( 27 ). Further subcellular analysis revealed that Spetex-1 protein also localizes at satellite fibrils associated with outer dense fibers in the middle piece of the flagella in spermatozoa ( 26 , 30 ).

Few hypotheses regarding Spetex-1 function were proposed. Its localization in the cytoplasm of spermatids and in residual bodies suggests a role in spermiogenesis and, particularly, in maturation of spermatids into spermatozoa ( 27 ). During maturation, elongated spermatids undergo reduction in their cytoplasmic volume, which is mediated by engulfment of residual bodies by Sertoli cells ( 53 ). It is assumed that this process involves apoptotic signals enabling Sertoli cells to recognize and phagocytose the residual cytoplasm ( 5 ). Indeed, it has been reported that proteins such as caspase-1 ( 5 ) and aquaporin-7 ( 59 ), which mediate apoptosis and volume reduction, respectively, are restrictively expressed in the cytoplasm of elongated spermatids. Therefore, it is possible that Spetex-1 might also be involved in this apoptosis-like process ( 27 ). In addition, Iida et al. showed that a portion of Spetex-1 protein is retained in spermatozoa as a flagellar component after spermiation. Thus, Spetex-1 might serve as a structural constituent in the flagella ( 26 , 30 ).

Here, we show that the transcription of human and mouse SPATA18 is directly activated by the p53 tumor suppressor in a variety of cell types. We demonstrate that p53 binds a consensus DNA motif located in a region corresponding to the first intron of the SPATA18 gene. We further show that mouse SPATA18 transcription is regulated in the testes in a unique spatiotemporal manner, being upregulated primarily by spermatids approximately 3 weeks after birth and remaining high in adults. SPATA18 expression pattern correlates with that of p21 and might be linked to the accumulation of p53 protein in spermatocytes. Our data imply that p53 transactivates SPATA18 in vivo and that p63 compensates for p53 function in the testes of p53-null mice.

DISCUSSION

p53 plays central roles in normal cell differentiation and organismal development ( 42 ). Moreover, substantial data implicate p53 in the regulation of spermatogenesis under normal conditions ( 1 , 52 , 55 ) and following DNA damage ( 20 , 21 ), as well as in the regulation of additional aspects of fertility ( 19 , 24 , 25 ). In this study we set out to examine the role of p53 in the transcriptional regulation of SPATA18 , a spermatogenesis-related gene. We discovered that SPATA18 is a bona fide p53 transcriptional target, and its induction by p53 can be observed in a variety of normal and cancerous cell types of both human and mouse origin. Similar to many other p53 target genes ( 62 ), the consensus DNA sequence that mediates p53 binding to the SPATA18 locus resides within its first intron, probably acting as an enhancer.

Although SPATA18 is known to be expressed primarily in the testis, it is also present in additional tissues, such as lung, intestine, and spleen ( 27 ). This may explain its expression in normal and cancerous cells representing a wide variety of tissues, including human and mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, prostate, ovarian, and hepatocellular carcinoma cells, as well as in mouse Sertoli and embryonic stem cells ( Fig. 1 , 2 , and 4 ; see also Fig. S1 posted at http://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/Varda/p53_SPATA18/ ). However, as the exact molecular role and biological function of SPATA18 are currently unknown, the role of its p53-dependent transcriptional induction in somatic cells is yet to be unveiled.

SPATA18 rat ortholog, Spetex-1 , is highly expressed during spermatogenesis in spermatids, and its protein localizes at defined regions, such as the cytoplasm of spermatids, residual bodies, and the flagella ( 26 , 27 , 30 ). Accordingly, two distinct non-mutually exclusive suggestions were raised regarding its function in spermatogenesis, being involved either in the process of spermatid maturation or constituting a flagellar component. These possibilities tempted us to speculate that SPATA18 might mediate, at least partially, the roles exerted by p53 during spermatogenesis. Our in vivo analyses indicate that SPATA18 is profoundly upregulated during mouse postnatal spermatogenesis at a stage corresponding to the appearance of spermatids. Accordingly, in situ hybridization analysis detected SPATA18 mRNA primarily in elongating spermatids, as well as in round spermatids, albeit at a lower level ( Fig. 3 ). This was in agreement with previous reports on Spetex-1 ( 26 , 27 ). To further support this notion, we utilized global expression analysis as performed by Namekawa et al. ( 44 ), which analyzed mRNA expression in four enriched germ cell populations from mouse testes, namely, types A and B spermatozoa, pachytene spermatocytes, and round spermatids. Confirming our results, SPATA18 was expressed almost exclusively in round spermatids (see Fig. S4A posted at http://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/Varda/p53_SPATA18/ ).

We present several lines of evidence that the testicular expression of SPATA18 is positively regulated by p53. First, the pattern of p53 accumulation, which typically indicates its functional activation, partially overlaps with that of SPATA18 transcription; i.e., p53 protein is accumulated in spermatocytes, round spermatids, and occasionally in elongating spermatids ( Fig. 3E to G), while SPATA18 mRNA is induced in round and, more profoundly, in elongating spermatids ( Fig. 3C and D; see also Fig. S4A posted at http://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/Varda/p53_SPATA18/ ). Second, p21 is induced between postnatal days 21 to 25 ( Fig. 3B ), concomitantly with the appearance of elongating spermatids, indicating functional activation of p53 at the same stage in which SPATA18 is induced. Of note, a similar spatiotemporal pattern was previously demonstrated also for the testicular p53 target gene Wip1 ( 10 ). Supporting the notion that SPATA18 is regulated by p53 in vivo , its expression is significantly attenuated in the testes of p53 +/− mice ( Fig. 4A ). This attenuation correlates with that of p53 and p21 mRNA levels. Whether this haploinsufficiency is manifested as fertility- or development-related defects is currently unclear since the effects of p53 deficiency were analyzed almost exclusively in p53-null animals. Surprisingly, the expression of both p21 and SPATA18 is not attenuated in p53 −/− mice, prompting us to hypothesize that the testicular p53 activity is compensated by its paralogs, p63 and p73, which play important and unique roles during development. Indeed, p63 and/or p73 were reported to compensate for p53 loss in several processes, including DNA damage response ( 65 ), tumor suppression ( 14 ), and development ( 28 , 56 ). p63 is expressed in a highly restricted pattern during embryogenesis and is essential for limb formation and epidermal morphogenesis. p63-null mice show profound developmental abnormalities of the skin, limbs, mammary, prostate, and other epithelial tissues and die soon after birth ( 39 , 63 ). In addition, p63 is expressed in mouse reproductive organs and primordial germ cells ( 32 ) and was suggested to regulate programmed cell death and differentiation of these cells ( 47 ). Most importantly, a similar giant-cell syndrome, which characterizes mice with p53 deficiency ( 52 ), was reported in p63 +/− adult mice and in p63 −/− cultured fetal testes ( 47 ).

Unlike p63, p73-null mice are viable but are stunted and have high mortality rates. These mice show profound developmental defects, including hippocampal dysgenesis and hydrocephalus ( 64 ). Interestingly, while p73-null mice have no structural abnormalities in their reproductive organs, p73-null males lack interest in mating, probably due to hormonal or sensory defects, and thus have low fecundity ( 64 ).

Our data indicate that p63 is highly expressed in spermatocytes and to a lesser extent in spermatids ( Fig. 4B ). Supporting the notion that p63 may compensate for p53 loss, p63 protein levels were increased in the testes of p53-null mice ( Fig. 4C ). Similarly, p63 protein was also shown to be increased in oral-esophageal epithelia of p53-null mice compared to WT p53 mice ( 16 , 58 ). It was further demonstrated that p53 can reduce the stability of TA-p63γ ( 36 ), perhaps providing a mechanistic explanation for the accumulation of p63 in p53-deficient tissues. Moreover, we observed an increase in the mRNA level of TA-p63, but not ΔN-p63, following p53 inactivation in WI-38 cells (data not shown), suggesting another mechanism by which p53 can downregulate p63.

Importantly, we demonstrated that p63 overexpression induces SPATA18 expression and that knockdown of endogenous p63 attenuates SPATA18 levels ( Fig. 4 ; see also Fig. S3B posted at http://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/Varda/p53_SPATA18/ ). Moreover, by analyzing publicly available gene profiling data sets, we found that knockdown of endogenous p63 expression in human keratinocytes or squamous carcinoma cells ( 3 ) leads to downregulation of SPATA18 expression (see Fig. S4D posted at the URL mentioned above). We also showed that p63 can directly bind a regulatory site within the first intron of SPATA18 ( Fig. 4F ). Taking together the observations that p63 is elevated in p53 −/− testes and is capable of binding SPATA18 and inducing its transcription, it is likely that the loss of testicular p53 activity is compensated by p63, resulting in steady transcriptional activity of p53 target genes. Of note, both p63 and p73 were suggested to compensate for p53 loss in several processes, including tumor suppression ( 14 ) and development ( 28 , 56 ). While both family members can potentially compensate for testicular p53 function, our data indicate p63 as the more likely candidate since p73 was not upregulated in the testes of p53 −/− mice and was not capable of transactivating SPATA18 in vitro (data not shown).

It remains highly interesting to investigate the role of SPATA18 as a p53 target both in the testes and in additional tissues and cell types. The identification of Spetex-1 protein in the cytoplasm of elongated spermatids and in residual bodies engulfed by Sertoli cells ( 27 ) implies the possibility that SPATA18 is involved in the apoptosis-like process of spermatid maturation, which coincides well with the known function of p53 as an apoptosis inducer. To date, we can only speculate that SPATA18 mediates p53 functions during spermatogenesis. Notably, the developmental effects of p53 deficiency were analyzed primarily in a homozygous background, in which SPATA18 expression remains normal. The question of whether abnormalities in spermatogenesis are present in p53 +/− mice is therefore intriguing. A somewhat equivalent system is represented by p53 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)-harboring mice, in which p53 mRNA and protein are downregulated ( 52 ). These mice exhibit a testicular giant-cell degenerative syndrome, which likely stems from the inability of tetraploid spermatocytes to complete meiosis. Another implication of SPATA18 in a spermatogenesis-related pathology may lie in the observation that SPATA18 is downregulated in human semen samples collected from individuals with severe teratozoospermia compared to semen collected from normal fertile men ( P value, 7.4 × 10 −3 ) (see Fig. S4B posted at http://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/Varda/p53_SPATA18/ ). Moreover, expression microarray analysis of testicular biopsy specimens of azoospermia patients reveals that SPATA18 mRNA is significantly downregulated in biopsy specimens collected from nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) patients compared with obstructive azoospermia (OA) patients ( P value, 8.3 × 10 −9 ) (see Fig. S4C posted at the URL mentioned above). Combined, these results link attenuated levels of SPATA18 to reduced fertility caused by defects in sperm development.

To gain insights into the possible roles of SPATA18 in additional tissues or processes, we searched the Oncomine database ( 49 ) and found few expression profiling studies that detected downregulation of SPATA18 in cancer samples compared to levels in the corresponding normal tissues. For instance, in a study conducted by Richardson et al. ( 50 ) comparing human ductal breast carcinomas to normal breast samples, SPATA18 was found to be downregulated approximately 5-fold in the malignant samples ( P value, 7.2 × 10 −7 ). These data imply a tumor suppressive role for SPATA18, perhaps in the process of programmed cell death.

Combined, our data enrich the known collection of p53 targets with a gene whose expression and localization imply a role in spermatogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, besides Wip1 , SPATA18 is currently the only testis-associated p53 target gene and the only gene proposed to be a structural component of the sperm flagella. Our data also provide clues into the mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis and fertility defects associated with p53 deficiency and highlight the primordial role of p53 as a master regulator of the transmission of genetic material.
