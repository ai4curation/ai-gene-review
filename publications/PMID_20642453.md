LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat protein kinase 2) is mutated in a significant number 
of Parkinson's disease patients, but still little is understood about how it is 
regulated or functions. In the present study we have demonstrated that 14-3-3 
protein isoforms interact with LRRK2. Consistent with this, endogenous LRRK2 
isolated from Swiss 3T3 cells or various mouse tissues is associated with 
endogenous 14-3-3 isoforms. We have established that 14-3-3 binding is mediated 
by phosphorylation of LRRK2 at two conserved residues (Ser910 and Ser935) 
located before the leucine-rich repeat domain. Our results suggests that 
mutation of Ser910 and/or Ser935 to disrupt 14-3-3 binding does not affect 
intrinsic protein kinase activity, but induces LRRK2 to accumulate within 
discrete cytoplasmic pools, perhaps resembling inclusion bodies. To investigate 
links between 14-3-3 binding and Parkinson's disease, we studied how 41 reported 
mutations of LRRK2 affected 14-3-3 binding and cellular localization. 
Strikingly, we found that five of the six most common pathogenic mutations 
(R1441C, R1441G, R1441H, Y1699C and I2020T) display markedly reduced 
phosphorylation of Ser910/Ser935 thereby disrupting interaction with 14-3-3. We 
have also demonstrated that Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding to 
endogenous LRRK2 is significantly reduced in tissues of homozygous LRRK2(R1441C) 
knock-in mice. Consistent with 14-3-3 regulating localization, all of the common 
pathogenic mutations displaying reduced 14-3-3-binding accumulated within 
inclusion bodies. We also found that three of the 41 LRRK2 mutations analysed 
displayed elevated protein kinase activity (R1728H, ~2-fold; G2019S, ~3-fold; 
and T2031S, ~4-fold). These results provide the first evidence suggesting that 
14-3-3 regulates LRRK2 and that disruption of the interaction of LRRK2 with 
14-3-3 may be linked to Parkinson's disease.
