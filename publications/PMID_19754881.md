Thioflavin T (ThT) dye fluorescence is used regularly to quantify the formation 
and inhibition of amyloid fibrils in the presence of anti-amyloidogenic 
compounds such as polyphenols. However, in this study, it was shown, using three 
polyphenolics (curcumin, quercetin and resveratrol), that ThT fluorescence 
should be used with caution in the presence of such exogenous compounds. The 
strong absorptive and fluorescent properties of quercetin and curcumin were 
found to significantly bias the ThT fluorescence readings in both in situ 
real-time ThT assays and single time-point dilution ThT-type assays. The 
presence of curcumin at concentrations as low as 0.01 and 1 mum was sufficient 
to interfere with the ThT fluorescence associated with fibrillar 
amyloid-beta(1-42) (0.5 mum) and fibrillar reduced and carboxymethylated 
kappa-casein (50 mum), respectively. The ThT fluorescence associated with 
fibrillar amyloid-beta(1-42) was also biased using higher concentrations of 
resveratrol, a polyphenol that is not spectroscopically active at the 
wavelengths of ThT fluorescence, implying that there can be direct interactions 
between ThT and the exogenous compound and/or competitive binding with ThT for 
the fibrils. Thus, in all cases where ThT is used in the presence of an 
exogenous compound, biases for amyloid-associated ThT fluorescence should be 
tested, regardless of whether the additive is spectroscopically active. Simple 
methods to conduct these tests were described. The Congo red spectral shift 
assay is demonstrated as a more viable spectrophotometric alternative to ThT, 
but allied methods, such as transmission electron microscopy, should also be 
used to assess fibril formation independently of dye-based assays. Structured
