Classical cadherins are cell-surface glycoproteins that mediate 
calcium-dependent cell adhesion. The cytoplasmic domain of these glycoproteins 
is linked to the cytoskeleton through the catenins (alpha, beta and gamma). The 
catenins are intracellular polypeptides that are part of a complex 
sub-membranous network modulating the adhesive ability of the cells. One 
approach to elucidate the role of these molecules in the cell is to investigate 
their distribution during mouse development and in adult tissues. This study 
reports that catenins are widely expressed but in varying amounts in embryos and 
adult tissues. The expression of all three catenins is most prominent in the 
adult heart muscle and in epithelia of all developmental stages. In other 
embryonic and adult tissues, lower expression of catenins was detected, e.g., in 
smooth muscle or connective tissue. Catenins are coexpressed with various 
cadherins in different tissues. Gastrulation is the first time during 
embryogenesis when a discrepancy occurs between the expression of catenins and 
E-cadherin. E-cadherin expression is suppressed in mesodermal cells but not the 
expression of catenins. This discrepancy suggests that another cadherin may 
interact with catenins. Similarly, E-cadherin is generally expressed in adult 
liver but not in the regions surrounding the central veins. In contrast, 
catenins are uniformly expressed in the liver, suggesting that they are 
associated with other cadherins in E-cadherin negative cells. Finally, the three 
catenins are not always concurrently expressed. For example, in peripheral 
nerves, only beta-catenin is observable, and in smooth muscle plakoglobin is not 
detectable.
