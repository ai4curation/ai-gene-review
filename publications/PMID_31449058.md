Introduction

Eukaryotic genome duplication relies on 3 B-family DNA polymerases: polymerase α, polymerase ε, and polymerase δ ( 1 ). Polymerase α is known to have primase activity ( 2 ), whereas polymerase ε is thought to synthesize DNA at the leading strand ( 3 ) and polymerase δ at the lagging strand ( 4 , 5 ). More recently, polymerase δ has been shown to also be proficient in leading-strand DNA synthesis ( 6 ). Beyond DNA replication, the polymerase δ complex has emerged as a central element in the safeguarding of genome integrity by controlling processes such as break-induced replication ( 7 ) and homologous recombination (HR) ( 8 ). The catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent polymerase complexes associates with several accessory subunits in multiprotein assemblies. The mammalian polymerase δ complex is a heterotetramer consisting of the catalytic subunit POLD1 and the accessory subunits POLD2, POLD3, and POLD4 ( 9 ), which regulate the activity of the complex and have specialized roles in stabilization of the complex, establishment of protein-protein interactions, and regulation of the cell cycle ( 10 , 11 ). The specific function of the POLD2 subunit has been poorly explored, despite its central structural role in interacting with both POLD1 and POLD3 ( 12 ). Interestingly, POLD2 and POLD3 participate in translesion synthesis (TLS) via their interaction with the polymerase ζ complex, a translesion polymerase complex comprising the catalytic subunit REV3L and the accessory subunit REV7 ( 13 , 14 ).

The catalytic subunit POLD1 and the accessory subunits POLD2 and POLD3 have been shown to be essential in mammalian cellular systems using CRISPR/Cas9 and haploid genetic screens ( 15 , 16 ). In yeast, POLD1 and POLD2 are also essential ( 17 ). This requirement has constrained the generation of polymerase δ–knockout cell lines or model organisms. A recent study in mice demonstrated that haploinsufficiency of POLD3 leads to polymerase δ complex instability and replication stress in vivo ( 18 ). In humans, heterozygous germline mutations in the proofreading domain of polymerase δ and polymerase ε have been associated with familial cancer predisposition through a hypermutator phenotype ( 19 , 20 ). Moreover, heterozygous mutations affecting the polymerase and CysB domains of POLD1 have been found to cause autosomal-dominant mandibular hypoplasia, deafness, and progeroid features (MDP) syndrome ( 21 , 22 ). Here, we report biallelic mutations in POLD1 and POLD2 leading to reduced functionality of the polymerase δ complex as the underlying cause of an autosomal-recessive syndromic immunodeficiency.

Discussion

Polymerase δ is an essential eukaryotic replicative polymerase, however, the complexity of its activity and the function of its accessory subunits are not well defined. Here, we report on 2 patients with biallelic mutations affecting the POLD1 and POLD2 subunits of polymerase δ, who presented with developmental defects and combined immunodeficiency (CID).

Heterozygous germline mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLD1 have been identified in familial colorectal cancer ( 19 , 41 ). These exonuclease domain mutations lead to the so-called mutator phenotype found in many human cancers ( 20 ). Furthermore, heterozygous mutations in the polymerase domain of POLD1 have been identified in individuals presenting with MDP syndrome ( 21 , 22 ). POLD1 , consequently, has been classified as a tier 1 cancer gene (COSMIC database; https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic ) with both germline and somatic variants with documented activity in cancer. Functionally validated somatic POLD2 variants are absent from databases such as COSMIC, and, to our knowledge, no mutation has previously been associated with human disease. Loss-of-function intolerance scores for POLD1 and POLD2 indicate that both genes are not predicted to present a haploinsufficient phenotype, despite the autosomal-dominant phenotypes reported in the literature ( 19 – 22 ). In familial colorectal cancer, this could be explained by the hypermutator phenotype, characterized by a genetic loss of function that leads to a functional gain of function, in which mutations in the proofreading domain lead to an increased mutation rate ( 19 , 41 ). However, in the case of MDP syndrome, the incomplete penetrance of the syndrome remains unexplained.

Since DNA instability syndromes are classically associated with cancer predisposition, it could be expected that the reported patients are likely to develop malignancies. No malignant transformation has been detected in the patients described here, possibly because of largely intact monitorization of genome integrity, which may instead predispose polymerase δ–deficient cells to cell-cycle arrest and senescence. Notably, though, T cell immunodeficiency has a well-established impact on cancer risk due to compromised antitumour immunity and an inability to efficiently clear cancer-associated virus infections ( 42 ). Moreover, recent studies on mutational signatures across various cancer entities have identified a distinct mutational signature linked to the related polymerase ε ( 43 ). Therefore, despite the cancer-free history of the patients described here, it is quite possible that polymerase δ complex–deficient patients are at heightened risk of cancer development, and we would recommend that patients be monitored closely for any neoplastic changes. A reliable and quantitative assessment of cancer predisposition in human POLD deficiency will require larger cohort sizes and longer clinical follow-up.

In our study, we reveal 2 different mechanisms leading to polymerase δ deficiency. On the one hand, the identified POLD2 mutant leads to severe polymerase δ complex instability, a finding reminiscent of Pold3 +/– heterozygous mice ( 18 ) and Pole4 -null mice and recently reported in POLE1-deficient patients ( 34 ). The reduction in polymerase δ availability may restrict replication by interfering with the assembly of replisomes. On the other hand, the identified POLD1 mutants did not affect protein stability but affected the intrinsic polymerase activity of the complex. As shown in Figure 2B and Supplemental Figure 2A , both mutations (p.Q684H and p.S939W) found in cis were located in the vicinity of, but not directly at, the polymerase active site. Our experiments addressed the effect of the combined allele and not the relative contribution of each mutation to the POLD1 catalytic activity. While, presumably, the p.Q684H mutant, residing close to the DNA binding site, may contribute to a larger extent to catalytic inactivity, such mutations may not exhibit the same severe phenotype as a mutation located exactly at the active site, such as the mouse Leu604Gly/Lys mutation. Equivalent to Leu606 in humans, this mutation was described as homozygously lethal in utero in Venkatesan et al. ( 28 ) ( Supplemental Figure 2A ), and, similarly, homozygous human mutations directly affecting the active site of the POLD1 polymerase domain are likely to be nonviable because of the essentiality of DNA replication.

At the cellular level, we observed increased replication fork speed and reduced origin firing in patients’ fibroblasts. A relationship between reduced origin activation and a compensatory higher fork speed has been suggested before in cells of GINS1-deficient patients ( 33 ) and polymerase ε–deficient patients ( 34 ). Previous reports of patients with deficiency of the replication factor MCM4 did not explore the dynamics of the replication fork ( 44 , 45 ). Moreover, in our study, the S-phase checkpoint was found to be activated in the patients’ cells to ensure completion of faithful DNA replication with limited polymerase δ complex. Stalled replication forks that fail to restart can be converted to DSBs. In our patients’ cells, DSB repair was activated through HR, apparent by increased RAD51 foci. Besides its well-characterized role in HR, RAD51 has also been recently implicated directly in replication fork protection from endonucleases ( 37 ) and in replication fork restart in yeast as an alternative mechanism for polymerase δ–dependent fork restart ( 46 ). Therefore, these mechanisms may also be activated in polymerase δ deficiency.

Immunodeficiency associated with DSB repair stems, in many cases, from the necessity of antigen receptor rearrangement ( 47 ). However, a separate group of deficiencies is emerging in which immunodeficiency is caused by depletion of essential DNA replication factors. Of note, 2 families with mutations in the replicative polymerase ε have been described as presenting with a CID with decreased lymphocyte proliferation ( 48 , 49 ). In patients with polymerase δ mutations, we found a reduced lymphocyte expansion capacity, which could be explained by activation of the S-phase checkpoint and an increase in replication-related DNA lesions, such as 53BP1 G1 nuclear bodies, which are known to localize to under-replicated loci. Although rapid lymphocyte expansion processes may make them more vulnerable to replication stress, it is interesting to note that lymphocytes have been previously shown to suppress p53 and ATR during the germinal center reaction in order to tolerate replicative stress ( 50 , 51 ), but it is unclear whether these mechanisms are active in expanding human peripheral lymphocytes. Moreover, replication timing experiments have shown that the replication program in lymphocytes differs significantly from that in fibroblastic cell lines ( 52 ).

Overall, our findings define what we believe to be a novel genetic syndrome caused by polymerase δ deficiency and reveal a previously undefined role, to our knowledge, of polymerase δ in neurodevelopment and lymphocyte biology. Future research will shed light on the differential regulation of checkpoint activation and replication timing in lymphocytes versus other cell types. Replisome components have emerged as key determinants of adaptive immunity that should be systematically analyzed in the context of syndromic immunodeficiency.
