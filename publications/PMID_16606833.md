The Myc transcription factor plays a central role in the regulation of cell 
cycle progression, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cellular transformation. Myc is 
a potent oncoprotein that is deregulated in a wide variety of human tumors and 
is therefore an attractive target for novel cancer therapies. Using a cellular 
screening approach, we have identified low-molecular-weight compounds, Myc 
pathway response agents (MYRAs), that induce apoptosis in a c-Myc-dependent 
manner and inhibit Myc-driven cellular transformation. MYRA-A inhibits Myc 
transactivation and interferes with the DNA-binding activity of Myc family 
proteins but has no effect on the E-box-binding protein USF. In contrast, MYRA-B 
induces Myc-dependent apoptosis without affecting Myc transactivation or Myc/Max 
DNA binding. Our data show that cellular screening assays can be a powerful 
strategy for the identification of candidate substances that modulate the Myc 
pathway. These compounds can be useful tools for studying Myc function and may 
also be of therapeutic potential as leads for drug development.

Abstract

The Myc transcription factor plays a central role in the regulation of cell cycle progression, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cellular transformation. Myc is a potent oncoprotein that is deregulated in a wide variety of human tumors and is therefore an attractive target for novel cancer therapies. Using a cellular screening approach, we have identified low-molecular-weight compounds, Myc pathway response agents (MYRAs), that induce apoptosis in a c-Myc-dependent manner and inhibit Myc-driven cellular transformation. MYRA-A inhibits Myc transactivation and interferes with the DNA-binding activity of Myc family proteins but has no effect on the E-box-binding protein USF. In contrast, MYRA-B induces Myc-dependent apoptosis without affecting Myc transactivation or Myc/Max DNA binding. Our data show that cellular screening assays can be a powerful strategy for the identification of candidate substances that modulate the Myc pathway. These compounds can be useful tools for studying Myc function and may also be of therapeutic potential as leads for drug development.

Discussion

Using a cellular screening approach, we have identified two compounds, MYRA-A and MYRA-B, that predominantly suppressed the growth of Myc overexpressing Tet-Myc cells. Treatment of human B cells with these compounds resulted in more significant effects on cells with Myc overexpression compared with cells with WT Myc levels. The Myc-dependent effects of these compounds were further verified in Rat-1 cells with different Myc levels. Notably, the effect of the candidate compounds on cell viability was more significant in cells with c-Myc overexpression (HOmyc3) compared with cells with WT c-myc (TGR-1), whereas they did not show significant effects in c-myc-null cells (HO15.19).

Morphological changes of cells and nuclei showed that treatment with MYRAs induced apoptotic cell death in a Myc-dependent manner, which is supported by the quantitative data from the apoptosis ELISA assay. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of the identification of small molecules that induce apoptosis in a Myc-dependent manner. Berg et al . ( 39 ) did not indicate that their compounds induced apoptosis. Although Yin et al . ( 40 ) observed apoptosis after treatment with their substances for >1 week, no difference on cell viability was observed between Myc-overexpressing and control cells.

We observed that MYRA-A interfered with the DNA binding not only of Myc/Max but also of Mnt/Max and Max/Max complexes. These results are not surprising because Mnt and Myc share DNA-binding site and regulate an overlapping set of target genes in vivo ( 12 ). In addition, loss of Mnt has been shown to induce similar effects as Myc overexpression, such as induction of Myc target genes, accelerated proliferation and apoptosis, and transformation of primary fibroblasts in conjunction with Ras ( 47 , 48 ). It has been proposed that Myc functions by relief of Mnt repression ( 48 , 49 ). Therefore, it will be interesting to analyze whether the Myc-dependent effects of these compounds occur through interference with both Myc and Mnt function. However, MYRA-A did not show any effect on the DNA-binding activity of USF, which binds to the same E-box ( 50 ). Thus, MYRA-A could possibly discriminate Myc network members from other E-box-binding proteins. The effective concentrations of MYRA-A in the EMSA were higher than those used in the cell viability assays, which is similar to the results obtained for other compounds ( 39 ). One possibility is that the compound accumulates in cells to reach effective intracellular concentrations. We did not obtain evidence that interference with Myc/Max dimerization by MYRA-A was the underlying mechanism. However, based on the results obtained in the EMSA and luciferase assays, we hypothesize that MYRA-A might distinguish Myc family proteins from other E-box-binding transcription factors as a result of direct or indirect interference with DNA-binding. MYRA-B, on the other hand, might act through effects on variant E-box promoters, by interaction with other transcriptional factors that bind Myc such as Miz-1 ( 9 ), by interference with adaptor proteins, or by an indirect mechanism. It is also interesting to note that MYRA-B displayed differential inhibition of soft agar growth having only weak inhibition on MR cells compared with its effect on Rat-1a-myc cells. This finding might reflect different conditions for transformation and/or might be due to different cell type-specific changes in these two cell lines. It will be important to analyze the effects of MYRAs on the Myc pathway in more detail to find key players and possible new therapeutic candidates in the Myc-mediated apoptosis pathway.

Ideally, a Myc-targeting therapy should intervene only with cells with deregulated Myc and not affect the majority of normal cells in vivo . The observation that MYRAs predominantly induced apoptosis in cells with Myc overepression is in line with this ambition. Our study shows that cellular screening assays can be efficient tools to identify low-molecular-weight compounds that target the Myc pathway by different mechanisms of action. These compounds could be useful tools for gaining further insights into Myc-regulated pathways and may also provide a starting point for medical chemistry and drug design.
