Eukaryotic cells respond to starvation by decreasing the rate of general protein 
synthesis while inducing translation of specific mRNAs encoding transcription 
factors GCN4 (yeast) or ATF4 (humans). Both responses are elicited by 
phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and the attendant 
inhibition of its nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B-decreasing the binding to 40S 
ribosomes of methionyl initiator tRNA in the ternary complex (TC) with eIF2 and 
GTP. The reduction in TC levels enables scanning ribosomes to bypass the start 
codons of upstream open reading frames in the GCN4 mRNA leader and initiate 
translation at the authentic GCN4 start codon. We exploited the fact that GCN4 
translation is a sensitive reporter of defects in TC recruitment to identify the 
catalytic and regulatory subunits of eIF2B. More recently, we implicated the 
C-terminal domain of eIF1A in 40S-binding of TC in vivo. Interestingly, we found 
that TC resides in a multifactor complex (MFC) with eIF3, eIF1, and the 
GTPase-activating protein for eIF2, known as eIF5. Our biochemical and genetic 
analyses indicate that physical interactions between MFC components enhance TC 
binding to 40S subunits and are required for wild-type translational control of 
GCN4. MFC integrity and eIF3 function also contribute to post-assembly steps in 
the initiation pathway that impact GCN4 expression. Thus, apart from its 
critical role in the starvation response, GCN4 regulation is a valuable tool for 
dissecting the contributions of multiple translation factors in the eukaryotic 
initiation pathway.
