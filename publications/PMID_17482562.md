Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (JNCL) results from a deficiency of 
CLN3, a protein recently identified within detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). 
To study the function of CLN3 within these domains we isolated DRMs from control 
and JNCL-brain and noted that JNCL-derived DRMs are less buoyant than control. 
Analysis of DRM phospholipids derived from JNCL-brain revealed a reduction of 
bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate. Metabolic labeling of JNCL-fibroblasts 
demonstrated a reduction in the synthesis of bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate 
which was restored following complementation with wild-type-CLN3, substantiating 
our initial observation in brain. Metabolic labeling of cell lines 
overexpressing wild-type-CLN3 resulted in increased 
bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate synthesis, while overexpression of mutant 
CLN3-L170P decreased bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate synthesis. These data 
illustrate a new finding, a strong correlation between CLN3 protein expression 
and synthesis of bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate.
