The 2D IR spectra of the amide-I vibrations of amyloid fibrils from Abeta40 were 
obtained. The matured fibrils formed from strands having isotopic substitution 
by (13)C (18)O at Gly-38, Gly-33, Gly-29, or Ala-21 show vibrational exciton 
spectra having reduced dimensionality. Indeed, linear chain excitons of amide 
units are seen, for which the interamide vibrational coupling is measured in 
fibrils grown from 50% and 5% mixtures of labeled and unlabeled strands. The 
data prove that the 1D excitons are formed from parallel in-register sheets. The 
coupling constants show that for each of the indicated residues the amide 
carbonyls in the chains are separated by 0.5 +/- 0.05 nm. The isotope 
replacement of Gly-25 does not reveal linear excitons, consistent with the 
region of the strand having a different structure distribution. The vibrational 
frequencies of the amide-I modes, freed from effects of amide vibrational 
excitation exchange by 5% dilution experiments, point to there being a component 
of an electric field along the fibril axis that increases through the sequence 
Gly-38, Gly-33, Gly-29. The field is dominated by side chains of neighboring 
residues.
