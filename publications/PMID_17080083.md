Most human tumours have genetic mutations in their Rb and p53 pathways, but 
retinoblastoma is thought to be an exception. Studies suggest that 
retinoblastomas, which initiate with mutations in the gene retinoblastoma 1 
(RB1), bypass the p53 pathway because they arise from intrinsically 
death-resistant cells during retinal development. In contrast to this prevailing 
theory, here we show that the tumour surveillance pathway mediated by Arf, MDM2, 
MDMX and p53 is activated after loss of RB1 during retinogenesis. RB1-deficient 
retinoblasts undergo p53-mediated apoptosis and exit the cell cycle. 
Subsequently, amplification of the MDMX gene and increased expression of MDMX 
protein are strongly selected for during tumour progression as a mechanism to 
suppress the p53 response in RB1-deficient retinal cells. Our data provide 
evidence that the p53 pathway is inactivated in retinoblastoma and that this 
cancer does not originate from intrinsically death-resistant cells as previously 
thought. In addition, they support the idea that MDMX is a specific 
chemotherapeutic target for treating retinoblastoma.
