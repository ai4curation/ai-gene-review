The smallest genomic region causing Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) deletes the 
non-coding RNA SNORD116 cluster; however, the function of SNORD116 remains a 
mystery. Previous work in the field revealed the tantalizing possibility that 
expression of NHLH2, a gene previously implicated in both obesity and 
hypogonadism, was downregulated in PWS patients and differentiated stem cells. 
In silico RNA: RNA modeling identified several potential interaction domains 
between SNORD116 and NHLH2 mRNA. One of these interaction domains was highly 
conserved in most vertebrate NHLH2 mRNAs examined. A construct containing the 
Nhlh2 mRNA, including its 3'-UTR, linked to a c-myc tag was transfected into a 
hypothalamic neuron cell line in the presence and absence of 
exogenously-expressed Snord116. Nhlh2 mRNA expression was upregulated in the 
presence of Snord116 dependent on the length and type of 3'UTR used on the 
construct. Furthermore, use of actinomycin D to stop new transcription in N29/2 
cells demonstrated that the upregulation occurred through increased stability of 
the Nhlh2 mRNA in the 45 minutes immediately following transcription. In silico 
modeling also revealed that a single nucleotide variant (SNV) in the NHLH2 mRNA 
could reduce the predicted interaction strength of the NHLH2:SNORD116 diad. 
Indeed, use of an Nhlh2 mRNA construct containing this SNV significantly reduces 
the ability of Snord116 to increase Nhlh2 mRNA levels. For the first time, these 
data identify a motif and mechanism for SNORD116-mediated regulation of NHLH2, 
clarifying the mechanism by which deletion of the SNORD116 snoRNAs locus leads 
to PWS phenotypes.
