Specific sites of lysine methylation on histones correlate with either 
activation or repression of transcription. The tumour suppressor p53 (refs 4-7) 
is one of only a few non-histone proteins known to be regulated by lysine 
methylation. Here we report a lysine methyltransferase, Smyd2, that methylates a 
previously unidentified site, Lys 370, in p53. This methylation site, in 
contrast to the known site Lys 372, is repressing to p53-mediated 
transcriptional regulation. Smyd2 helps to maintain low concentrations of 
promoter-associated p53. We show that reducing Smyd2 concentrations by short 
interfering RNA enhances p53-mediated apoptosis. We find that Set9-mediated 
methylation of Lys 372 inhibits Smyd2-mediated methylation of Lys 370, providing 
regulatory cross-talk between post-translational modifications. In addition, we 
show that the inhibitory effect of Lys 372 methylation on Lys 370 methylation is 
caused, in part, by blocking the interaction between p53 and Smyd2. Thus, 
similar to histones, p53 is subject to both activating and repressing lysine 
methylation. Our results also predict that Smyd2 may function as a putative 
oncogene by methylating p53 and repressing its tumour suppressive function.
