The Hippo transducers YAP/TAZ have been shown to play positive, as well as 
negative, roles in Wnt signaling, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. 
Here, we provide biochemical, functional, and genetic evidence that YAP and TAZ 
are integral components of the β-catenin destruction complex that serves as 
cytoplasmic sink for YAP/TAZ. In Wnt-ON cells, YAP/TAZ are physically dislodged 
from the destruction complex, allowing their nuclear accumulation and activation 
of Wnt/YAP/TAZ-dependent biological effects. YAP/TAZ are required for intestinal 
crypt overgrowth induced by APC deficiency and for crypt regeneration ex vivo. 
In Wnt-OFF cells, YAP/TAZ are essential for β-TrCP recruitment to the complex 
and β-catenin inactivation. In Wnt-ON cells, release of YAP/TAZ from the complex 
is instrumental for Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In line, the β-catenin-dependent 
maintenance of ES cells in an undifferentiated state is sustained by loss of 
YAP/TAZ. This work reveals an unprecedented signaling framework relevant for 
organ size control, regeneration, and tumor suppression.
