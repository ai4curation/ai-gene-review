Abstract

Maintenance of genomic stability ensures faithful transmission of genetic information and helps suppress neoplastic transformation and tumorigenesis. Although recent progress has advanced our understanding of DNA damage checkpoint regulations, little is known as to how DNA repair, especially the RAD51-dependent homologous recombination repair pathway, is executed in vivo . Here, we reveal novel properties of the BRCA2-associated protein PALB2 in the assembly of the recombinational DNA repair machinery at DNA damage sites. Although the chromatin association of PALB2 is a prerequisite for subsequent BRCA2 and RAD51 loading, the focal accumulation of the PALB2·BRCA2·RAD51 complex at DSBs occurs independently of known DNA damage checkpoint and repair proteins. We provide evidence to support that PALB2 exists as homo-oligomers and that PALB2 oligomerization is essential for its focal accumulation at DNA breaks in vivo . We propose that both PALB2 chromatin association and its oligomerization serve to secure the BRCA2·RAD51 repair machinery at the sites of DNA damage. These attributes of PALB2 are likely instrumental for proficient homologous recombination DNA repair in the cell.

DISCUSSION

PALB2 was previously implicated in the recruitment of BRCA2 to DNA breaks ( 11 ). Dysregulation of PALB2 function resulted in the failure of DNA damage-induced BRCA2 relocalization to DSBs and impaired HR repair ( 11 ). However, mechanistically how PALB2 is recruited to DNA breaks and how it mediates recombinational repair remain largely unexplored. In this study we have examined how PALB2 orchestrates DNA repair in response to DNA damage. PALB2 localizes to chromatin and assembled as oligomers at the site of DNA damage, which then serves as an anchor for the loading of BRCA2 and RAD51 to allow the activation of the error-free HR repair. Accordingly, disruption of either the PALB2 oligomerization domain or the BRCA2 binding motif resulted in defective HR and increased cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents.

Previous studies have shown that PALB2 affects the stability and association of BRCA2 with certain nuclear structure in the cell and is essential for BRCA2 focal accumulation upon DNA damage ( 11 ). Here we provide evidence to support that PALB2 not only stabilizes the association of BRCA2 at the chromatin but is also a prerequisite for BRCA2 binding to chromatin structure ( Fig. 1 C ). Indeed, we found that PALB2 associate with chromatin constitutively irrespective of treatments with DNA damaging reagent, as does BRCA2 and RAD51 ( Fig. 1 C ).

Our observation underscores a possible intrinsic DNA binding activity of PALB2 in HR functioning. Notably, identification of DNA binding activity among the PALB2·BRCA2·RAD51 complex is not unprecedented, as RAD51 was previously shown to display single and double strand DNA binding activities ( 22 ). Likewise, a ssDNA binding domain (DBD) on BRCA2 has also been identified ( 23 ). It has been proposed that the BRCA2 DBD helps mediate the assembly of the RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament via the displacement of the single-strand DNA-binding protein RPA from the HR substrate ( 24 ). However, a recent report has provided evidence that the BRCA2 DBD might be dispensable for HR repair. Specifically, BRCA2 mutants lacking the DBD were shown to restore HR repair capacity and resistance to a PARP1 inhibitor to BRCA2-deficient cells ( 25 ). This observation is congruent with the hypothesis that PALB2 might possess DNA binding activity that could substitute BRCA2 DBD activity. In this study we observed a linear hierarchical relationship in the recruitment of the three HR repair proteins to DNA damage-induced foci in the sequence of 1) PALB2, 2) BRCA2, and 3) RAD51 ( Fig. 1 , A and B ). Being the upstream co-factor, PALB2 might serve as the initial recognition module that in turn facilitates the loading and accumulation of the BRCA2·RAD51 complex at DSBs. Once the PALB2·BRCA2·RAD51 repair complex is loaded onto the damaged DNA, additional DNA binding activities of BRCA2, RAD51, and others then play important roles in mediating subsequent steps during HR repair processes.

We note that the deletion of the PALB2 N-terminal coiled-coil domain alone disrupted its focus forming ability in vivo ( Fig. 3 ). Coiled-coil domains are modules that promote protein-protein interaction or protein oligomerization ( 26 ). We found that PALB2 exists as a dimeric or multimeric structure via its coiled-coil domain ( Fig. 3 , D–G ). We proposed that upon DNA damage, the constitutively chromatin-associated PALB2 oligomerize so as to facilitate its accumulation at sites of DSBs to initiate HR repair by recruiting the BRCA2·RAD51 repair complex. Indeed, the PALB2 deletion mutant lacking the oligomerization domain not only is defective in foci formation at DSBs, but it also demonstrated deficits in homologous recombination and MMC sensitivity ( Fig. 5 ). Interestingly, we and others have also found that PALB2 interacts with BRCA1 via its coiled-coil domain, forming a three-way complex with BRCA2 to allow optimal HR repair ( 27 , 44 ). Given that PALB2 foci formation does not require BRCA1, our observation that the PALB2 coiled-coil motif mediates its oligomerization suggests that this particular property might regulate sustained localization of PALB2 at DSBs in vivo . We are currently testing this hypothesis.

It has been illustrated that protein oligomerization stabilizes protein-DNA association in DNA damage signaling, where oligomerization of Rad9 is required for sustain checkpoint signaling ( 28 ). Indeed, many of the DNA repair protein have been shown to exist as dimer or oligomers. Oligomerization of RAD51 to form the nucleofilament has been demonstrated by electronic microscopy ( 29 ). Structural studies also implicated a dimerization property for BRCA2 ( 23 ). Together with the PALB2 oligomerization property revealed in the current study and also its association with BRCA1, we proposed that the DNA repair complex exists as arrays of protein homo- and hetero-oligomers at site of DSBs upon DNA damage, where the quaternary structural configurations of the oligomers mediate the stabilization of the complex at the DSBs to facilitate subsequent repair processes.

Although our study shows that oligomerization of PALB2 is required for its focal accumulation at DSBs and, thus, the subsequent recruitment of the BRCA2·RAD51 complex to DNA lesions, mechanistically how PALB2 locates DNA breaks has yet to be clarified. It was previously shown that ATR-ATRIP senses DNA damage via recognition of RPA-coated ssDNA ( 30 ). The PALB2·BRCA2·RAD51 repair complex may utilize a similar system to recognize DSBs, as the replacement of RPA from ssDNA by RAD51 nucleofilament is the first step for DNA repair ( 8 – 10 ). Another possibility is that structural changes of the chromatin surrounding DNA breaks may signal for the recruitment of PALB2. A number of chromatin remodeling enzymes have been found to play an early role in response to DNA damage to facilitate the recruitment of signaling molecules as well as DNA repair proteins ( 31 ). The remodeled chromatin structure might enhance PALB2 access to DNA lesions. This may occur in parallel to the known role of chromatin remodeling in the DNA damage signaling cascade ( 32 , 33 ).

Alignment of PALB2 homologues (data not shown) shows that both the coiled-coil domain and the WD40 repeats are highly conserved among species. This suggests that both domains are significant for PALB2 function. Indeed, apart from the oligomerization property mediated by the coiled-coil motif, we have also refined the BRCA2 binding motif on PALB2 to its WD40 repeats ( Fig. 4 ). WD40 repeats are known to mediate multiprotein complex assemblies as well as protein-DNA association. WD repeats are thought to organize as circularized β-propeller structure and serves as a rigid scaffold for protein interactions. The fact that deletion of any of the four WD40 domains on the PALB2 C terminus disrupted its interaction with BRCA2 indicated that the tertiary structure of the β-propeller is required for their interaction. We observed that disruption in the PALB2/BRCA2 interaction led to HR deficiency as observed in PALB2 FA patient cells ( Fig. 5 ). It suggests that the essential role of PALB2 in HR is primarily via its ability in recruiting the BRCA2·RAD51 complex to DSBs. Because both coiled-coil and WD40 motifs are structural scaffolds and are both required for PALB2 function in HR, the PALB2 structure should provide insightful information to explain how PALB2 organizes the repair complex at DSBs.

DNA damage checkpoints play key roles in ensuring genomic stability by delaying cell cycle progression to allow sufficient time for DNA repair ( 34 , 35 ). One would expect that cross-talk between the DNA repair machinery and cell cycle checkpoint pathways might enable an elaborate and precise coordination of cellular events essential for cell survival and proliferation. It remains largely elusive as to what the connections between DNA repair processes and DNA damage checkpoints are.

Recent studies demonstrated that human CtBP-interacting protein and its orthologues are involved in the generation of ssDNAs through resection of DSBs ( 36 – 41 ). The formation of RPA-ssDNA complexes could then lead to the recruitment and activation of ATR-ATRIP, which in turns control the intra-S checkpoint ( 30 ). Similarly RPA-ssDNA complexes may also be required for HR repair. Thus, RPA-coated ssDNA might represent a common signal for DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control. ATR and CHK1 depletion was reported to dramatically reduce RAD51 IRIF and HR repair ( 42 , 43 ). However, we still detected RAD51 IRIF after depletion of ATR or CHK1 by siRNA in our study. The discrepancies in these observations might largely be because of the very different cell types used in these studies. Nevertheless, these differences point out that the relationship between cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair is multifactorial and may involve many feedback loops and converging/diverging points. In agreement with this idea, PALB2 depletion also resulted in compromised intra-S checkpoint defect ( 11 ), suggesting an intimate relationship between checkpoint control and HR repair.

We believe that cross-talk between the DNA repair machinery and cell cycle checkpoint control not only couples the initiation of DNA repair and checkpoint activation but also serves as means to coordinate between the resumption of cell cycle progression upon completion of DNA repair. Future studies will reveal mechanistically how this coordination is achieved in the cell.
