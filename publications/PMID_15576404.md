Signals that govern development of the osteoblast lineage are not well 
understood. Indian hedgehog (Ihh), a member of the hedgehog (Hh) family of 
proteins, is essential for osteogenesis in the endochondral skeleton during 
embryogenesis. The canonical pathway of Wnt signaling has been implicated by 
studies of Lrp5, a co-receptor for Wnt proteins, in postnatal bone mass 
homeostasis. In the present study we demonstrate that beta-catenin, a central 
player in the canonical Wnt pathway, is indispensable for osteoblast 
differentiation in the mouse embryo. Moreover, we present evidence that Wnt 
signaling functions downstream of Ihh in development of the osteoblast lineage. 
Finally Wnt7b is identified as a potential endogenous ligand regulating 
osteogenesis. These data support a model that integrates Hh and Wnt signaling in 
the regulation of osteoblast development.
