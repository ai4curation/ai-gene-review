Activating signal cointegrator 1 (ASC-1) harbors an autonomous transactivation 
domain that contains a putative zinc finger motif which provides binding sites 
for basal transcription factors TBP and TFIIA, transcription integrators steroid 
receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) and CBP-p300, and nuclear receptors, as 
demonstrated by the glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays and the yeast 
two-hybrid tests. The ASC-1 binding sites involve the hinge domain but not the 
C-terminal AF2 core domain of nuclear receptors. Nonetheless, ASC-1 appears to 
require the AF2-dependent factors to function (i.e., CBP-p300 and SRC-1), as 
suggested by the ability of ASC-1 to coactivate nuclear receptors, either alone 
or in cooperation with SRC-1 and p300, as well as its inability to coactivate a 
mutant receptor lacking the AF2 core domain. By using indirect 
immunofluorescence, we further show that ASC-1, a nuclear protein, is localized 
to the cytoplasm under conditions of serum deprivation but is retained in the 
nucleus when it is serum starved in the presence of ligand or coexpressed CBP or 
SRC-1. These results suggest that ASC-1 is a novel coactivator molecule of 
nuclear receptors which functions in conjunction with CBP-p300 and SRC-1 and may 
play an important role in establishing distinct coactivator complexes under 
different cellular conditions.
