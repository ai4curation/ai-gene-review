During mammalian sex determination, SOX9 is translocated into the nuclei of 
Sertoli cells within the developing XY gonad. The N-terminal nuclear 
localization signal (NLS) is contained within a SOX consensus calmodulin (CaM) 
binding region, thereby implicating CaM in nuclear import of SOX9. By 
fluorescence spectroscopy and glutaraldehyde cross-linking, we show that the 
SOX9 HMG domain and CaM interact in vitro. The formation of a SOX9.CaM binary 
complex is calcium-dependent and is accompanied by a conformational change in 
SOX9. A CaM antagonist, calmidazolium chloride (CDZ), was observed to block CaM 
recognition of SOX9 in vitro and inhibit both nuclear import and consequent 
transcriptional activity of SOX9 in treated cells. The significance of the 
SOX9-CaM interaction was highlighted by analysis of a missense SOX9 mutation, 
A158T, identified from a XY female with campomelic dysplasia/autosomal sex 
reversal (CD/SRA). This mutant binds importin beta normally despite defective 
nuclear import. Fluorescence and quenching studies indicate that in the unbound 
state, the A158T mutant shows a similar conformation to that of the WT SOX9, but 
in the presence of CaM, the mutant undergoes unusual conformational changes. 
Furthermore, SOX9-mediated transcriptional activation by cells expressing the 
A158T mutant is more sensitive to CDZ than cells expressing WT SOX9. These 
results suggest first that CaM is involved in the nuclear transport of SOX9 in a 
process likely to involve direct interaction and second, that CD/SRA can arise, 
at least in part, from a defect in CaM recognition, ultimately leading to 
reduced ability of SOX9 to activate transcription of cartilage and 
testes-forming genes.
