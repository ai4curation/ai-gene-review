Nodal, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, is known to 
play critical roles in early vertebrate development, but its functions in 
extraembryonic tissues are unclear. ALK7 is a type I receptor for Nodal. 
Recently, we demonstrated that Nodal mRNA and several ALK7 transcripts are 
expressed in human placenta throughout pregnancy (Roberts, H. J., Hu, S., Qiu, 
Q., Leung, P. C. K., Cannigia, I., Gruslin, A., Tsang, B., and Peng, C. (2003) 
Biol. Reprod. 68, 1719-1726). In this study, we determined the role of Nodal and 
ALK7 in trophoblast cell proliferation and apoptosis. Overexpression of Nodal in 
normal trophoblast cells (HTR8/SVneo) and several choriocarcinoma cell lines 
resulted in a significant decrease in the number of metabolically active cells. 
The effect of Nodal could be mimicked by constitutively active ALK7 (ALK7-ca), 
but was blocked by kinase-deficient ALK7. The growth inhibitory effect of Nodal 
was also blocked by dominant-negative Smad2/3. Overexpression of Nodal and 
ALK7-ca induced apoptosis in trophoblast cells as determined by Hoechst 
staining, flow cytometry, and caspase-3 Western blotting. In addition, Nodal and 
ALK7-ca decreased the number of proliferating cells as measured by 
bromodeoxyuridine assays. Furthermore, overexpression of Nodal or ALK7-ca 
increased p27 expression, but reduced the levels of Cdk2 and cyclin D(1). Taken 
together, this study demonstrates for the first time that Nodal, acting through 
ALK7 and Smad2/3, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in human 
trophoblast cells. Our findings also suggest that the Nodal-ALK7 pathway 
inhibits cell proliferation by inducing G(1) cell cycle arrest and that this 
effect is mediated in part by the p27-cyclin E/Cdk2 pathway.
