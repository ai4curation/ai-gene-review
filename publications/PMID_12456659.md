Import of core histones into the nucleus is a prerequisite for their deposition 
onto DNA and the assembly of chromatin. Here we demonstrate that nucleosome 
assembly protein 1 (Nap1p), a protein previously implicated in the deposition of 
histones H2A and H2B, is also involved in the transport of these two histones. 
We demonstrate that Nap1p can bind directly to Kap114p, the primary 
karyopherin/importin responsible for the nuclear import of H2A and H2B. Nap1p 
also serves as a bridge between Kap114p and the histone nuclear localization 
sequence (NLS). Nap1p acts cooperatively to increase the affinity of Kap114p for 
these NLSs. Nuclear accumulation of histone NLS-green fluorescent protein (GFP) 
reporters was decreased in deltanap1 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 
Nap1p promotes the association of the H2A and H2B NLSs specifically with the 
karyopherin Kap114p. Localization studies demonstrate that Nap1p is a 
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, and genetic experiments suggest that its 
shuttling is important for maintaining chromatin structure in vivo. We propose a 
model in which Nap1p links the nuclear transport of H2A and H2B to chromatin 
assembly.
