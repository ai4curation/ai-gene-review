C. elegans detects several odorants with the bilaterally symmetric pair of AWC 
olfactory neurons. A stochastic, coordinated decision ensures that the candidate 
odorant receptor gene str-2 is expressed in only one AWC neuron in each 
animal--either the left or the right neuron, but never both. An interaction 
between the two AWC neurons generates asymmetric str-2 expression in a process 
that requires normal axon guidance and probably AWC axon contact. This 
interaction induces str-2 expression by reducing calcium signaling through a 
voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel and the CaM kinase II UNC-43. CaMKII activity 
acts as a switch in the initial decision to express str-2; thus, calcium signals 
can define distinct cell types during neuronal development. A cGMP signaling 
pathway that is used in olfaction maintains str-2 expression after the initial 
decision has been made.
