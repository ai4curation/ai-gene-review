The human Wilms' tumor gene WT1 encodes a putative transcription factor 
implicated in tumorigenesis and in specifying normal urogenital development. We 
have studied the distribution of WT1 protein and mRNA using immunohistochemistry 
and in situ hybridization. Monoclonal antibodies were raised against a peptide 
specific to the first alternative splice site of WT1. Two antibodies 
specifically reacted on Western blot to this WT1 isoform. Immunofluorescence 
localized WT1 protein to podocytes during mesonephric and metanephric 
development. In situ hybridization revealed a similar pattern of expression 
except that WT1 mRNA was also present in metanephric blastema and renal 
vesicles. Messenger RNA expression was most pronounced in the kidneys during 
early fetal development and declined thereafter. In contrast, WT1 protein was 
readily detectable in glomerular podocytes throughout adulthood. WT1 protein in 
Wilms' tumor was present in blastema and glomeruloid structures. Expression in 
the female gonad was linked to the different stages of granulosa cell 
development. In the male gonad, expression was restricted to Sertoli cells and 
their precursors, the embryonic tunica albuginea and the rete testis. The 
intracellular distribution of the WT1 protein was investigated by confocal laser 
microscopy and was demonstrated to be exclusively nuclear. The nuclear 
distribution and the selective pattern of expression support the proposed role 
of WT1 as a transcription factor active during urogenital development. The 
persistence of WT1 expression in the adult kidney suggests a role in homeostasis 
of the podocyte.
