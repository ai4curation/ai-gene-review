Germ line mutations in BRCA2 gene predispose women to early-onset familial 
breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA2 is a protein of multiple functions. In addition 
to its role in DNA double-strand break repair, BRCA2 also plays a role in 
stabilization of stalled DNA replication forks, cytokinesis, transcription 
regulation, mammalian gametogenesis, centrosome duplication, and suppression of 
cell proliferation. However, how BRCA2 mutations predispose women specifically 
to breast and ovarian cancer remains undefined. Here we found that BRCA2 binds 
and stabilizes MAGE-D1, a member of the MAGE gene family of proteins. Expression 
of BRCA2 and MAGE-D1 synergistically suppresses cell proliferation independently 
of the p53 pathway. Using two MAGE-D1 RNA interferences and two cell lines 
expressing low or undetectable levels of MAGE-D1, we further showed that the 
expression of MAGE-D1 is required for BRCA2-mediated suppression of cell 
proliferation, indicating that MAGE-D1 is a downstream target of BRCA2 and that 
BRCA2 suppresses cell proliferation via stabilizing MAGE-D1. Importantly, 
MAGE-D1 protein expression was reduced in 6 of 16 breast carcinoma cell lines 
tested as compared with untransformed immortal mammary epithelial cell lines, 
suggesting that suppression of MAGE-D1 expression may be involved in the 
tumorigenesis of a subset of sporadic breast cancers.

In addition to its role in DNA double-strand breaks repair, BRCA2 also plays a role in stabilization of stalled DNA replication forks, cytokinesis, transcription regulation, mammalian gametogenesis, centrosome duplication, and suppression of cell proliferation.

Expression of BRCA2 and MAGE-D1 synergistically suppresses cell proliferation independently of the p53 pathway. Using two MAGE-D1 RNAis and two cell lines expressing low or undetectable levels of MAGE-D1, we further demonstrated that the expression of MAGE-D1 is required for BRCA2-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, indicating that MAGE-D1 is a downstream target of BRCA2 and that BRCA2 suppresses cell proliferation via stabilizing MAGE-D1. Importantly, MAGE-D1 protein expression was reduced in 6 out of 16 breast carcinoma cell lines tested as compared with untransformed immortal mammary epithelial cell lines, suggesting that suppression of MAGE-D1 expression may be involved in the tumorigenesis of a subset of sporadic breast cancers.
