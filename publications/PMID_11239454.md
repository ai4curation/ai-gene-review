Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human autosomal recessive cancer susceptibility 
disorder characterized by cellular sensitivity to mitomycin C and ionizing 
radiation. Although six FA genes (for subtypes A, C, D2, E, F, and G) have been 
cloned, their relationship to DNA repair remains unknown. In the current study, 
we show that a nuclear complex containing the FANCA, FANCC, FANCF, and FANCG 
proteins is required for the activation of the FANCD2 protein to a 
monoubiquitinated isoform. In normal (non-FA) cells, FANCD2 is monoubiquitinated 
in response to DNA damage and is targeted to nuclear foci (dots). Activated 
FANCD2 protein colocalizes with the breast cancer susceptibility protein, BRCA1, 
in ionizing radiation-induced foci and in synaptonemal complexes of meiotic 
chromosomes. The FANCD2 protein, therefore, provides the missing link between 
the FA protein complex and the cellular BRCA1 repair machinery. Disruption of 
this pathway results in the cellular and clinical phenotype common to all FA 
subtypes.
