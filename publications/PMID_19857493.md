A novel survival role of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) that involves its nuclear 
translocation and direct association with p53 has been demonstrated. Here we 
examined the relationship between the p53/FAK interaction and Ser46 
phosphorylation of p53 (p-p53(Ser46)) in the apoptotic regulation of human 
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (HOSCC) cell lines, expressing either wild 
type (wt) p53 or mutant (mt) p53-R175H. In contrast to the wt p53 cell lines, 
the mt p53-R175H cell line was resistant to staurosporine (STS)-mediated 
detachment and caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, despite the resistance of mt 
p53-R175H to Ser46 phosphorylation, both wt and mt HOSCC cells translocate FAK 
into the nucleus and maintain the p53/FAK interaction post STS treatment. These 
findings provide unique insight into how tumor cells harboring the R175H mutant 
may resist chemotherapeutic intervention.
