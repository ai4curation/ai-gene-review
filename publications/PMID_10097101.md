G1/S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints maintain genomic stability in eukaryotes in 
response to genotoxic stress. We report here both genetic and functional 
evidence of a Gadd45-mediated G2/M checkpoint in human and murine cells. 
Increased expression of Gadd45 via microinjection of an expression vector into 
primary human fibroblasts arrests the cells at the G2/M boundary with a 
phenotype of MPM2 immunopositivity, 4n DNA content and, in 15% of the cells, 
centrosome separation. The Gadd45-mediated G2/M arrest depends on wild-type p53, 
because no arrest was observed either in p53-null Li-Fraumeni fibroblasts or in 
normal fibroblasts coexpressed with p53 mutants. Increased expression of cyclin 
B1 and Cdc25C inhibited the Gadd45-mediated G2/M arrest in human fibroblasts, 
indicating that the mechanism of Gadd45-mediated G2/M checkpoint is at least in 
part through modulation of the activity of the G2-specific kinase, cyclin 
B1/p34(cdc2). Genetic and physiological evidence of a Gadd45-mediated G2/M 
checkpoint was obtained by using GADD45-deficient human or murine cells. Human 
cells with endogenous Gadd45 expression reduced by antisense GADD45 expression 
have an impaired G2/M checkpoint after exposure to either ultraviolet radiation 
or methyl methanesulfonate but are still able to undergo G2 arrest after 
ionizing radiation. Lymphocytes from gadd45-knockout mice (gadd45 -/-) also 
retained a G2/M checkpoint initiated by ionizing radiation and failed to arrest 
at G2/M after exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, the mammalian genome 
is protected by a multiplicity of G2/M checkpoints in response to specific types 
of DNA damage.
