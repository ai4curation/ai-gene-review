Most transcriptional repression pathways depend on the targeted deacetylation of 
histone tails. In this report, we characterize NIR, a novel transcriptional 
corepressor with inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT) activity. NIR 
(Novel INHAT Repressor) is ubiquitously expressed throughout embryonic 
development and adulthood. NIR is a potent transcriptional corepressor that is 
not blocked by histone deacetylase inhibitors and is capable of silencing both 
basal and activator-driven transcription. NIR directly binds to nucleosomes and 
core histones and prevents acetylation by histone acetyltransferases, thus 
acting as a bona fide INHAT. Using a tandem affinity purification approach, we 
identified the tumor suppressor p53 as a NIR-interacting partner. Association of 
p53 and NIR was verified in vitro and in vivo. Upon recruitment by p53, NIR 
represses transcription of both p53-dependent reporters and endogenous target 
genes. Knock-down of NIR by RNA interference significantly enhances histone 
acetylation at p53-regulated promoters. Moreover, p53-dependent apoptosis is 
robustly increased upon depletion of NIR. In summary, our findings describe NIR 
as a novel INHAT that plays an important role in the control of p53 function.

Abstract

Most transcriptional repression pathways depend on the targeted deacetylation of histone tails. In this report, we characterize NIR, a novel transcriptional corepressor with inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT) activity. NIR (Novel INHAT Repressor) is ubiquitously expressed throughout embryonic development and adulthood. NIR is a potent transcriptional corepressor that is not blocked by histone deacetylase inhibitors and is capable of silencing both basal and activator-driven transcription. NIR directly binds to nucleosomes and core histones and prevents acetylation by histone acetyltransferases, thus acting as a bona fide INHAT. Using a tandem affinity purification approach, we identified the tumor suppressor p53 as a NIR-interacting partner. Association of p53 and NIR was verified in vitro and in vivo. Upon recruitment by p53, NIR represses transcription of both p53-dependent reporters and endogenous target genes. Knock-down of NIR by RNA interference significantly enhances histone acetylation at p53-regulated promoters. Moreover, p53-dependent apoptosis is robustly increased upon depletion of NIR. In summary, our findings describe NIR as a novel INHAT that plays an important role in the control of p53 function.

Discussion

Iterative BLAST analyses and degenerate, low-complexity screening with the core INHAT domain of the Set/TAF1β oncoprotein ( Seo et al. 2001 ) allowed us to isolate NIR, a novel INHAT repressor. Enzymatic assays demonstrate that NIR contains two functional INHAT domains. Gal-NIR is a potent repressor independent of the cell line and promoter context analyzed. In contrast to most other known repressors, NIR-mediated repression is not influenced by HDAC inhibitors. Neither TSA or Na-butyrate nor the class III HDAC inhibitor nicotinamide block NIR-mediated repression, pointing to a mechanism that differs from the behavior of previously described repressors. Concomitantly, NIR does not associate with HDACs or diverse members of different corepressor families. These data provide evidence that NIR is a novel HDAC-independent repressor.

In in vitro-assays, full-length NIR and recombinantly expressed NIR INHAT domains directly associate with nucleosomes, core histones, and histone tails. As for Set/TAF1β, association of NIR with the histone tail is sensitive to acetylation, supporting its role as an INHAT to maintain histones in the nonacetylated state. Consequently, acetylation of all core histones by p300 is blocked in the presence of NIR. ChIP analyses further corroborate the in vivo function of NIR as an INHAT, since reduction of endogenous NIR significantly increases histone acetylation at p53 target promoters. In contrast to the Set/TAF1β and pp32 INHATs ( Kutney et al. 2004 ) and the recently described PELP1 ( Choi et al. 2004 ), repression mediated by NIR does not rely on HDAC activity. Accordingly, immunopurified NIR and associated complexes do not contain detectable HDAC activity. Additionally, NIR does not display interaction with known transcriptional corepressors such as N-CoR, Smrt, Sin3, SuN-CoR, or HDACs 1, 4, 5, and 6 (Supplementary Fig. 7), and none of the TAP purifications revealed association with known corepressors or INHAT proteins. Furthermore, the ChIP and Re-ChIP experiments clearly demonstrate that although HDACs (such as HDAC1) occupy the endogenous p21 promoter, NIR and HDAC1 are not present in the same protein complex in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 8). These data indicate that NIR is functionally divergent from PELP1, Set/TAF1β, and pp32.

Using a tandem affinity purification approach, we isolated p53 as a NIR-interacting partner. The C-terminal NIR-interaction domain in p53 is distinct from the Sin3-interaction site ( Zilfou et al. 2001 ) and coincides with a described repression domain in the C terminus of p53 ( Hong et al. 2001 ). Recent publications have shown that repression of the p53-regulated stathmin and Map4 promoters requires the recruitment of HDACs by the p53-binding partner Sin3 ( Murphy et al. 1999 ), and recruitment of the corepressor CtBP2 is acquired only in presence of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 ( Mirnezami et al. 2003 ). In contrast, we demonstrate NIR to be the first INHAT that is able to directly interact with p53 and to modulate p53-mediated transcriptional activation. Whether NIR is also involved in p53-mediated repression is an intriguing question that needs to be addressed in future studies.

The tumor suppressor p53 is thought to function primarily as a transcription factor, which in response to cellular stress binds to target gene promoters ( Harris and Levine 2005 ). However, recent work has documented that p53 can occupy a subset of its target promoters even in the absence of genotoxic stress ( Espinosa and Emerson 2001 ; Kaeser and Iggo 2002 ). This observation indicates that other mechanisms besides the control of DNA binding are involved in the regulation of p53 transcriptional activity in vivo, setting the requirement for negative regulatory factors. The inhibition of histone acetylation upon association of NIR with promoter-occupying p53 might be such a mechanism. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that p53 present at promoters in the absence of genotoxic stress functions as a signaling platform for negative regulators to silence transcription. In agreement with this hypothesis, NIR knock-down in unstressed cells results in stimulation of p21 RNA and protein expression. In contrast, the p53-regulated genes PIG3, NOXA , and BAX are significantly stimulated only in response to doxorubicin treatment but not by NIR knock-down. This difference might mirror the recent findings that p21 constitutes a gene of high promoter occupancy by p53 while PIG3 and BAX belong to a group of genes with much lower promoter occupancy ( Kaeser and Iggo 2002 ). Overproduction of NIR robustly inhibited stimulation of the p53 target genes p21, NOXA , and PIG3 upon genotoxic stress in p53-proficient cells, whereas basal expression of these genes in the absence of stress was unaffected. This shows that in stressed cells, p53 activation is, at least in part, counteracted by NIR.

NIR knock-down provokes apoptosis only in p53-containing HCT116 cells. In contrast, HCT116/p53 -/- cells do not display any significant cell death upon addition of NIR siRNA, thus demonstrating the physiological importance of NIR in the regulation of p53-mediated apoptosis. However, NIR depletion does not stimulate expression of the proapoptotic genes PIG3, NOXA , and BAX , indicating that these genes do not mediate induction of apoptosis in response to NIR knock-down. It is well established that 53 provokes apoptosis not only through the transcriptional activation of proapoptotic genes. In fact, p53-mediated apoptosis is also correlated with the ability of p53 to actively repress genes ( Ryan and Vousden 1998 ). Recent work has indicated that transcriptional repression by p53 may depend on the efficient acetylation of histone tails by HATs ( Imbriano et al. 2005 ). Since NIR is an INHAT, NIR knock-down resulting in elevated histone acetylation thus may support apoptosis by facilitating p53-dependent gene repression.

In summary, our results establish NIR as a novel transcriptional INHAT that directly interacts with p53, inhibits p53-activated gene expression, and regulates p53-dependent apoptosis. Future research including the analyses of Nir -deficient mice will shed further light on the impact of NIR on p53 function in cell cycle control, development, and tumorigenesis.
