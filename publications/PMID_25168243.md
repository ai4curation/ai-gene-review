Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer cells. Strap (stress-responsive 
activator of p300) is a novel TPR motif OB-fold protein that contributes to p53 
transcriptional activation. We show here that, in addition to its established 
transcriptional role, Strap is localised at mitochondria where one of its key 
interaction partners is ATP synthase. Significantly, the interaction between 
Strap and ATP synthase downregulates mitochondrial ATP production. Under 
glucose-limiting conditions, cancer cells are sensitised by mitochondrial Strap 
to apoptosis, which is rescued by supplementing cells with an extracellular 
source of ATP. Furthermore, Strap augments the apoptotic effects of 
mitochondrial p53. These findings define Strap as a dual regulator of cellular 
reprogramming: first as a nuclear transcription cofactor and second in the 
direct regulation of mitochondrial respiration.

Abstract

Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer cells. Strap (stress-responsive activator of p300) is a novel TPR motif OB-fold protein that contributes to p53 transcriptional activation. We show here that, in addition to its established transcriptional role, Strap is localised at mitochondria where one of its key interaction partners is ATP synthase. Significantly, the interaction between Strap and ATP synthase downregulates mitochondrial ATP production. Under glucose-limiting conditions, cancer cells are sensitised by mitochondrial Strap to apoptosis, which is rescued by supplementing cells with an extracellular source of ATP. Furthermore, Strap augments the apoptotic effects of mitochondrial p53. These findings define Strap as a dual regulator of cellular reprogramming: first as a nuclear transcription cofactor and second in the direct regulation of mitochondrial respiration.

Discussion

We have described a novel mitochondrial role for cofactor Strap in reprogramming cellular metabolism through its ability to influence oxidative phosphorylation. This is achieved by means of an interaction between Strap and ATP synthase, enabling Strap to downregulate ATP synthase activity and lower the level of cellular ATP. Significantly, a reduced level of cellular ATP, as a consequence of mitochondrially localised Strap, sensitised cells to apoptosis. This effect could be rescued by supplying an extracellular source of ATP. Our results thus connect Strap with mitochondria and suggest that it acts on ATP synthesis to influence the pool of available cellular ATP ( Figure 4e ).

Mitochondrial ATP production is the main source of energy for intracellular pathways. 3 A large body of evidence connects the level of intracellular ATP with apoptosis; thus defective ATP production or excessive ATP consumption can lead to reduced activity of ATP-dependent ion pumps with subsequent apoptosis. 30 Moreover, cellular stress can often result in ATP depletion and manipulating cell metabolism also impacts on cell fate. 31 During apoptosis, a sufficient supply of ATP is necessary to favour apoptosome formation and trigger caspase activation, 32 and the severity of reduction in cellular ATP often determines the mode of programmed cell death. 32 A decrease in intracellular ATP can initiate cytochrome c release from the inner mitochondrial membrane and trigger apoptosis; 33 in this respect, overexpression of L-Strap resulted in a decrease in the ATP/ADP ratio and was able to sensitise the cells to p53-dependent apoptosis.

Studies have suggested a role for mitochondrial p53 in influencing MOMP during the early stages of p53-mediated apoptosis, which precedes its nuclear translocation during the DNA-damage response. 34 , 35 Our data also support this model and suggest that similar to p53, Strap, in the early stages of the damage response, can be found at the mitochondria where it may influence mitochondrial MOMP and cytochrome c release. At the later stages of damage, both Strap and p53 take on a more nuclear localisation ( Figure 4e ) where Strap can function as a nuclear p53 co-factor. 9 , 10 , 11 Although our study supports a role of Strap in mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, we cannot rule out the possibility that Strap, as a general stress-responsive p53 co-factor, may have a role in other p53 functions, such as p53-dependent necrosis. 36 It is also interesting to note that alterations in ATP levels would likely influence AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), which monitors cellular energy status. AMPK has been shown to phosphorylate and stabilise mitochondrial p53 leading to Bak oligomerisation and apoptosis. 37 It is possible that Strap-mediated alterations in ATP levels could, in turn, impact on AMPK activity and this may feed-forward into p53 activity during metabolic reconditioning and would be of interest to evaluate in future studies.

Strap is a previously described p53 cofactor that undergoes nuclear accumulation upon DNA damage. 10 Its nuclear localisation is dependent on DNA-damage-activated protein kinases, mediated by both ATM and Chk2 kinases. 10 , 11 The results described here reveal an unexpected level of Strap control, through its localisation to mitochondria, interaction with ATP synthase and its subsequent influence on ATP production. Our results thus define a dual role for Strap that integrates metabolic reprogramming mediated by the key enzyme ATP synthase with the p53 response.
