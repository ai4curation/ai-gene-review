The interface between apoptosis (programmed cell death) and the cell cycle is 
essential to preserve homeostasis and genomic integrity. Here, we show that 
survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis over-expressed in cancer, physically 
associates with the cyclin-dependent kinase p34(cdc2) on the mitotic apparatus, 
and is phosphorylated on Thr(34) by p34(cdc2)-cyclin B1, in vitro and in vivo. 
Loss of phosphorylation on Thr(34) resulted in dissociation of a 
survivin-caspase-9 complex on the mitotic apparatus, and caspase-9-dependent 
apoptosis of cells traversing mitosis. These data identify survivin as a mitotic 
substrate of p34(cdc2)-cyclin B1 and suggest that survivin phosphorylation on 
Thr(34) may be required to preserve cell viability at cell division. 
Manipulation of this pathway may facilitate the elimination of cancer cells at 
mitosis.
