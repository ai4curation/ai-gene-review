The ethylene receptor family of Arabidopsis consists of five members, one of 
these being ETR1. The N-terminal half of ETR1 contains a hydrophobic domain 
responsible for ethylene binding and membrane localization. The C-terminal half 
of the polypeptide contains domains with homology to histidine (His) kinases and 
response regulators, signaling motifs originally identified in bacteria. The 
role of the His kinase domain in ethylene signaling was examined in planta. For 
this purpose, site-directed mutations were introduced into the full-length 
wild-type ETR1 gene and into etr1-1, a mutant allele that confers dominant 
ethylene insensitivity on plants. The mutant forms of the receptor were 
expressed in Arabidopsis and the transgenic plants characterized for their 
ethylene responses. A mutation that eliminated His kinase activity did not 
affect the ability of etr1-1 to confer ethylene insensitivity. A truncated 
version of etr1-1 that lacks the His kinase domain also conferred ethylene 
insensitivity. Possible mechanisms by which a truncated version of etr1-1 could 
exert dominance are discussed.

Abstract

The ethylene receptor family of Arabidopsis consists of five members, one of these being ETR1. The N-terminal half of ETR1 contains a hydrophobic domain responsible for ethylene binding and membrane localization. The C-terminal half of the polypeptide contains domains with homology to histidine (His) kinases and response regulators, signaling motifs originally identified in bacteria. The role of the His kinase domain in ethylene signaling was examined in planta. For this purpose, site-directed mutations were introduced into the full-length wild-type ETR1 gene and into etr1-1 , a mutant allele that confers dominant ethylene insensitivity on plants. The mutant forms of the receptor were expressed in Arabidopsis and the transgenic plants characterized for their ethylene responses. A mutation that eliminated His kinase activity did not affect the ability of etr1-1 to confer ethylene insensitivity. A truncated version of etr1-1 that lacks the His kinase domain also conferred ethylene insensitivity. Possible mechanisms by which a truncated version of etr1-1 could exert dominance are discussed.

DISCUSSION

Genetic analysis supports the model shown in Figure 7 , whereby ethylene receptors actively repress ethylene responses in the air (Fig. 7 A; Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ; Bleecker, 1999 ). In the presence of ethylene, wild-type receptors switch to a signaling-inactive state that allows for induction of ethylene responses (Fig. 7 B). Although His kinase activity has been demonstrated for the ethylene receptor ETR1 ( Gamble et al., 1998 ), the role of this activity in signaling is unknown. Simple mutational analysis to uncover the function of the His kinase domain is confounded by the presence of other nonmutant members of the receptor family. Loss-of-function mutations in individual members of the receptor family have minimal effect upon the ability of Arabidopsis to respond to ethylene ( Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ). We found that a G2 box mutation and a truncation of ETR1 had no apparent effect on the ability of the plant to respond to ethylene. However, ethylene responses could still be mediated by another member of the receptor family, such as ERS1, which contains a His kinase domain with all the conserved residues required for activity ( Hua et al., 1995 ).

The problems inherent in mutational analysis of a gene family can be circumvented in part by use of gain-of-function mutations such as etr1-1 . The etr1-1 mutant receptor of Arabidopsis is apparently locked into the signaling state that it has in the absence of ethylene. This state arises as a consequence of the mutant receptor's inability to bind ethylene, so that it represses ethylene responses even in the presence of ethylene (Fig. 7 C; Schaller and Bleecker, 1995 ). Because etr1-1 remains locked in its active state in the presence of ethylene, when other members of the receptor family are signaling inactive, mutational analysis of etr1-1 can lend insight into the requirements for signaling by the receptor. Our focus in this set of experiments has been on etr1-1 and the role of the His kinase domain in signaling.

Our data indicate that enzymatic activity is not required for the ethylene insensitivity conferred by the mutant etr1-1 receptor. We found that an etr1-1 mutant that contains a G2 box mutation was as effective as etr1-1 itself in conferring ethylene insensitivity. As demonstrated in this report, the G2-box mutation eliminates His kinase activity in ETR1; this mutation is also predicted to eliminate any potential phosphatase activity of the protein ( Yang and Inouye, 1993 ). It has been reported previously that etr1-1 is still able to confer dominant ethylene insensitivity when the His and Asp residues predicted to serve as phosphorylation sites are mutated ( Chang and Meyerowitz, 1995 ). These data are consistent with the finding that ethylene-insensitive mutants can be generated in the ethylene receptors ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4, all of which contain diverged His kinase domains predicted to lack His kinase activity ( Hua et al., 1998 ; Sakai et al., 1998 ). In addition, a tomato ethylene receptor with diverged kinase domain appears able to functionally compensate for an ethylene receptor containing a conserved kinase domain ( Tieman et al., 2000 ).

We also found that ethylene insensitivity could be conferred by the truncated etr1-1(1–349) receptor that lacks the C-terminal half of the protein containing the His kinase domain. The truncated etr1-1(1–349) receptor conferred complete dominant ethylene insensitivity upon wild-type seedlings. However, etr1-1(1–349) did not confer ethylene insensitivity as effectively as full-length versions of etr1-1, when analyzed in the etr1-7 genetic background that lacks ETR1. Dose response curves indicate that the ethylene responsiveness of these seedlings was reduced, rather than the sensitivity of the seedlings to ethylene shifted such that higher levels of ethylene were required to initiate the response. Partial ethylene insensitivity with a similar response to ethylene treatment has been observed in gene dosage experiments in which the ratio of wild-type to mutant etr1-1 genes was increased by use of a triploid background ( Hall et al., 1999 ). Partial ethylene insensitivity has also sometimes been observed when full-length etr1-1 is expressed as a transgene in a wild-type background, presumably because of low expression of the transgene ( Chang et al., 1993 ).

Use of the etr1-7 background allowed us to directly compare protein expression levels from the various transgenes encoding full-length and truncated receptors. The decreased effectiveness of etr1-1(1–349) in the etr1-7 background did not correlate with a reduced protein level compared with the full-length versions of etr1-1. Thus, our analysis of the truncated receptor supports a role for the C-terminal half of etr1-1 in the ability to confer ethylene insensitivity. The role of the C-terminal half for ethylene insensitivity could be in signal output, potentially for interactions with downstream signaling factors such as CTR1 ( Kieber et al., 1993 ; Clark et al., 1998 ) because we found no evidence that His kinase activity was required for ethylene insensitivity. Alternatively, the C-terminal half could be important for proper folding of the protein; in such cases, the protein levels for etr1-1(1–349) determined by western-blot analysis may not accurately reflect the level of functional protein.

It is surprising that although the C-terminal half of etr1-1 increased the ability of etr1-1 to confer ethylene insensitivity under some conditions, it was not essential to this ability. Thus, the truncated version of etr1-1 is able to still mediate the active repression of ethylene responses. One explanation for this ability would be that the etr1-1(1–349) receptor is directly capable of signal output (Fig. 7 D), potentially through its GAF domain ( Aravind and Ponting, 1997 ), the function of which has not been determined for the ethylene receptors. Alternatively, the etr1-1(1–349) receptor might be incapable of signal output itself, but be able to “convert” other wild-type receptors to an ethylene-insensitive signaling state (Fig. 7 E). One method by which such conversion could occur is suggested by our evidence that etr1-1(1–349) can form a disulfide-linked dimer with wild-type ETR1. Studies by Rodriguez et al. (1999) support the existence of a single ethylene-binding site per ETR1 dimer. As a consequence, a dimer of etr1-1(1–349) and ETR1 would likely result in neither polypeptide being able to bind ethylene because of the mutation within the shared ethylene-binding domain (Fig. 7 E). The ETR1 portion of an etr1-1(1–349):ETR1 dimer thus would remain in a signaling-active state and still repress ethylene responses in the presence of ethylene. Our finding that the truncated etr1-1(1–349) receptor appeared to be more effective at conferring ethylene insensitivity when analyzed in a genetic background that still had a full-length wild-type ETR1 receptor is suggestive that interactions between etr1-1(1–349) and wild-type ETR1 may be of physiological relevance.

Dimerization of etr1-1(1–349) with ETR1 represents a mechanism by which ETR1 could be converted to an ethylene-insensitive signaling state. Whether etr1-1(1–349) is capable of converting other members of the ethylene receptor family besides ETR1 to an ethylene-insensitive signaling state remains an open question. In the etr1-7 background, etr1-1(1–349) predominantly formed disulfide-linked homodimers, even though four non-ETR1 members of the Arabidopsis ethylene receptor family were present. However, different members of the ethylene receptor family could potentially interact through non-covalent associations. In bacteria, His kinases and the related chemoreceptors form non-covalently linked dimers that are important in signal propagation ( Pan et al., 1993 ; Parkinson, 1993 ). In addition, bacterial chemoreceptors are hypothesized to propagate signals through noncovalent associations with neighboring receptors as large multimeric complexes ( Bray et al., 1998 ). The discovery from crystal structure that the receiver domains of ETR1 form non-covalently linked dimers is indicative that noncovalent associations between ethylene receptors may play an important role in signaling ( Muller-Dieckmann et al., 1999 ).
