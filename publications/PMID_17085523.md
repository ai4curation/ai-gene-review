Determining how the regulation of cellular processes is impacted in cystic 
fibrosis (CF) is fundamental to understanding disease pathology and to 
identifying new therapeutic targets. In this study, unesterified cholesterol 
accumulation is observed in lung and trachea sections obtained from CF patients 
compared with non-CF tissues, suggesting an inherent flaw in cholesterol 
processing. An alternate staining method utilizing a fluorescent cholesterol 
probe also indicates improper lysosomal storage of cholesterol in CF cells. 
Excess cholesterol is also manifested by a significant increase in plasma 
membrane cholesterol content in both cultured CF cells and in nasal tissue 
excised from cftr(-/-) mice. Impaired intracellular cholesterol movement is 
predicted to stimulate cholesterol synthesis, a hypothesis supported by the 
observation of increased de novo cholesterol synthesis in lung and liver of 
cftr(-/-) mice compared with controls. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition 
of cholesterol transport is sufficient to cause CF-like elevation in cytokine 
production in wild-type cells in response to bacterial challenge but has no 
effect in CF cells. These data demonstrate via multiple methods in both cultured 
and in vivo models that cellular cholesterol homeostasis is inherently altered 
in CF. This perturbation of cholesterol homeostasis represents a potentially 
important process in CF pathogenesis.
