Clathrin has an established function in the generation of vesicles that transfer 
membrane and proteins around the cell. The formation of clathrin-coated vesicles 
occurs continuously in non-dividing cells, but is shut down during mitosis, when 
clathrin concentrates at the spindle apparatus. Here, we show that clathrin 
stabilizes fibres of the mitotic spindle to aid congression of chromosomes. 
Clathrin bound to the spindle directly by the amino-terminal domain of clathrin 
heavy chain. Depletion of clathrin heavy chain using RNA interference prolonged 
mitosis; kinetochore fibres were destabilized, leading to defective congression 
of chromosomes to the metaphase plate and persistent activation of the spindle 
checkpoint. Normal mitosis was rescued by clathrin triskelia but not the 
N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain, indicating that stabilization of 
kinetochore fibres was dependent on the unique structure of clathrin. The 
importance of clathrin for normal mitosis may be relevant to understanding human 
cancers that involve gene fusions of clathrin heavy chain.
