Abstract

Impaired DNA repair activity has been shown to greatly increase rates of cancer clinically. It has been hypothesized that upregulating repair activity in susceptible individuals may be a useful strategy for inhibiting tumorigenesis. Here we report that selected tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors including nilotinib, employed clinically in treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, are activators of the repair enzyme Human MutT Homolog 1 (MTH1). MTH1 cleanses the oxidatively damaged cellular nucleotide pool by hydrolysing the oxidized nucleotide 8-oxo-dGTP, which is a highly mutagenic lesion when incorporated into DNA. Structural optimization of analogs of TK inhibitors resulted in compounds such as SU0448, which induces 1000 ± 100% activation of MTH1 at 10 μM and 410 ± 60% at 5 μM. The compounds are found to increase activity of the endogenous enzyme, and at least one (SU0448) decreases levels of 8-oxo-dG in cellular DNA. The results suggest the possibility of using MTH1 activators to decrease the frequency of mutagenic nucleotides entering DNA, which may be a promising strategy to suppress tumorigenesis in individuals with elevated cancer risks.

Conclusions.

Our development of direct activators of human MTH1 is the second report of finding small-molecule activators of repair proteins. A recent study described the identification of activators of base excision repair enzyme OGG1 from screens of small molecule libraries. 33 Since not all proteins are amenable to direct activation, the current finding of MTH1 activators along with the recent OGG1 activator finding suggests that regulatability of activity, by allosteric or other mechanisms, may have evolved in these proteins as a mechanism for tuning repair levels in different cell types. Levels of oxidizing species in organisms vary widely depending on metabolic rate and exposure to environmental oxidants, 52 , 53 and so it is reasonable that repair activities may vary as well; indeed, different human cell lines vary widely in their repair activities, and human tumors often have upregulated repair in response to their elevated metabolic rate. 11 , 54 , 55 While levels of repair activity can be controlled in part by variable transcription and translation of repair machinery, our current findings suggest that a third level of control may have evolved, involving direct interaction with intracellular ligands. It will be of interest in the future to seek possible native intracellular ligands - small molecules or macromolecules - that can exert direct molecular control over the activity of specific repair enzymes.

Our discoveiy that multiple known kinase inhibitors, including the clinically important drug nilotinib, can activate repair of oxidatively damaged nucleotides by MTH1 is both novel and potentially clinically relevant. Nilotinib is employed in the clinic for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia patients that have developed resistance to first-line inhibitors. Here we find that this drug activates MTH1 by substantial amounts at concentrations between 5-10 μM, which is in the range of blood concentrations achieved with dosing of the drug in clinical studies. 56 - 58 Since such kinase inhibitors are often provided to patients continuously for years, it is conceivable that the drugs may exert long-term effects on repair of oxidative damage in those patients. We speculate that this could have a favorable effect in inhibiting mutagenesis and suppressing formation of new tumors as well as drug resistance, both of which are likely to require initiation by mutations such as those caused by oxidative damage. It will be of interest to evaluate long-term clinical outcomes of CML patients who have been treated with nilotinib and related TK inhibitors to seek evidence of such possible favorable effects.

In summary, we report the development of the first activators of MTH1, with representative compound 43 , which may prove useful as tools to probe the cellular and biological effects of upregulating repair of oxidative damage in the nucleotide pool. The compounds were derived from initial hits obtained from screening known kinase inhibitors, and optimization resulted in reduced kinase activity and low toxicity. We have shown that the compounds are cell permeable, enhance endogenous MTH1 activity, and at least one ( 43 ; SU0448) can lower levels of 8-oxo-dG in cellular DNA substantially. Future studies will test the ability of these and related compounds to delay or abrogate tumorigenesis in cellular and organismal models.
