Impaired DNA repair activity has been shown to greatly increase rates of cancer clinically. It has been hypothesized that upregulating repair activity in susceptible individuals may be a useful strategy for inhibiting tumorigenesis. Here we report that selected tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors including nilotinib, employed clinically in treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, are activators of the repair enzyme Human MutT Homolog 1 (MTH1). MTH1 cleanses the oxidatively damaged cellular nucleotide pool by hydrolysing the oxidized nucleotide 8-oxo-dGTP, which is a highly mutagenic lesion when incorporated into DNA. Structural optimization of analogs of TK inhibitors resulted in compounds such as SU0448, which induces 1000 ± 100% activation of MTH1 at 10 μM and 410 ± 60% at 5 μM. The compounds are found to increase activity of the endogenous enzyme, and at least one (SU0448) decreases levels of 8-oxo-dG in cellular DNA. The results suggest the possibility of using MTH1 activators to decrease the frequency of mutagenic nucleotides entering DNA, which may be a promising strategy to suppress tumorigenesis in individuals with elevated cancer risks.
