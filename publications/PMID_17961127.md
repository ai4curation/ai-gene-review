The NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) regulator A20 antagonises IKK [IkappaB 
(inhibitor of kappaB) kinase] activation by modulating Lys63-linked 
polyubiquitination of cytokine-receptor-associated factors including TRAF2/6 
(tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 2/6) and RIP1 
(receptor-interacting protein 1). In the present paper we describe the crystal 
structure of the N-terminal OTU (ovarian tumour) deubiquitinase domain of A20, 
which differs from other deubiquitinases but shares the minimal catalytic core 
with otubain-2. Analysis of conserved surface regions allows prediction of 
ubiquitin-binding sites for the proximal and distal ubiquitin molecules. 
Structural and biochemical analysis suggests a novel architecture of the 
catalytic triad, which might be present in a subset of OTU domains including 
Cezanne and TRABID (TRAF-binding domain). Biochemical analysis shows a 
preference of the isolated A20 OTU domain for Lys48-linked tetraubiquitin in 
vitro suggesting that additional specificity factors might be required for the 
physiological function of A20 in cells.
