The budding yeast centromere-kinetochore complex ensures high-fidelity 
chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis by mediating the attachment and 
movement of chromosomes along spindle microtubules. To identify new genes and 
pathways whose function impinges on chromosome transmission, we developed a 
genomic haploinsufficiency modifier screen and used ctf13-30, encoding a mutant 
core kinetochore protein, as the reference point. We demonstrate through a 
series of secondary screens that the genomic modifier screen is a successful 
method for identifying genes that encode nonessential proteins required for the 
fidelity of chromosome segregation. One gene isolated in our screen was RSC2, a 
nonessential subunit of the RSC chromatin remodeling complex. rsc2 mutants have 
defects in both chromosome segregation and cohesion, but the localization of 
kinetochore proteins to centromeres is not affected. We determined that, in the 
absence of RSC2, cohesin could still associate with chromosomes but fails to 
achieve proper cohesion between sister chromatids, indicating that RSC has a 
role in the establishment of cohesion. In addition, numerous subunits of RSC 
were affinity purified and a new component of RSC, Rtt102, was identified. Our 
work indicates that only a subset of the nonessential RSC subunits function in 
maintaining chromosome transmission fidelity.
