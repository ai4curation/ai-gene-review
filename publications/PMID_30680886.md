The patulin biosynthesis is one of model pathways in an understanding of 
secondary metabolite biology and network novelties in fungi. However, molecular 
regulation mechanism of patulin biosynthesis and contribution of each gene 
related to the different catalytic enzymes in the biochemical steps of the 
pathway remain largely unknown in fungi. In this study, the genetic components 
of patulin biosynthetic pathway were systematically dissected in Penicillium 
expansum, which is an important fungal pathogen and patulin producer in 
harvested fruits and vegetables. Our results revealed that all the 15 genes in 
the cluster are involved in patulin biosynthesis. Proteins encoded by those 
genes are compartmentalized in various subcellular locations, including cytosol, 
nucleus, vacuole, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane and cell wall. The 
subcellular localizations of some proteins, such as PatE and PatH, are required 
for the patulin production. Further, the functions of eight enzymes in the 
10-step patulin biosynthetic pathway were verified in P. expansum. Moreover, 
velvet family proteins, VeA, VelB and VelC, were proved to be involved in the 
regulation of patulin biosynthesis, but not VosA. These findings provide a 
thorough understanding of the biosynthesis pathway, spatial control and 
regulation mechanism of patulin in fungi.
