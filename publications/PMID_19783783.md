Recent studies have shown that the rate of aging can be modulated by diverse 
interventions. Dietary restriction is the most widely used intervention to 
promote longevity; however, the mechanisms underlying the effect of dietary 
restriction remain elusive. In a previous study, we identified two novel genes, 
nlp-7 and cup-4, required for normal longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. nlp-7 
is one of a set of neuropeptide-like protein genes; cup-4 encodes an ion-channel 
involved in endocytosis by coelomocytes. Here, we assess whether nlp-7 and cup-4 
mediate longevity increases by dietary restriction. RNAi of nlp-7 or cup-4 
significantly reduces the life span of the eat-2 mutant, a genetic model of 
dietary restriction, but has no effect on the life span of long-lived mutants 
resulting from reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling or dysfunction of the 
mitochondrial electron transport chain. The life-span extension observed in 
wild-type N2 worms by dietary restriction using bacterial dilution is prevented 
significantly in nlp-7 and cup-4 mutants. RNAi knockdown of genes encoding 
candidate receptors of NLP-7 and genes involved in endocytosis by coelomocytes 
also specifically shorten the life span of the eat-2 mutant. We conclude that 
two novel pathways, NLP-7 signaling and endocytosis by coelomocytes, are 
required for life extension under dietary restriction in C. elegans.
