Akt (or PKB) is an oncogene involved in the regulation of cell survival. Akt is 
regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3'K) signaling and has shown to 
be hyperactivated through the loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor. In Drosophila, 
insulin signaling as studied using the Drosophila IRS-4 homolog (Chico) has been 
shown to be a crucial regulator of cell size. We have studied Drosophila Akt 
(Dakt1) and have shown that it is also involved in the regulation of cell size. 
Furthermore we have performed genetic epistasis tests to demonstrate that in 
Drosophila, PI3'K, PTEN and Akt comprise a signaling cassette that is utilized 
during multiple stages of development. In addition, we show that this signaling 
cassette is also involved in the regulation of cell survival during 
embryogenesis. This study therefore establishes the evolutionary conservation of 
this signaling pathway in Drosophila. Oncogene (2000) 19, 3971 - 3977.
