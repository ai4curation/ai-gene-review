Different cytoplasmically replicating RNA viruses were shown to induce a 
specific subset of heat-inducible heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) genes in 
Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). To identify the inducing principle, a 
promoterreporter system was developed for the facile analysis of differentially 
responding Arabidopsis HSP70 genes, by infiltration into Nicotiana benthamiana 
leaves. Through transient expression of individual viral cistrons or through 
deletion analysis of a viral replicon, we were unable to identify a unique 
inducer of HSP70. However, there was a positive correlation between the 
translatability of the test construct and the differential induction of HSP70. 
Since these data implied a lack of specificity in the induction process, we also 
expressed a random series of cytosolically targeted Arabidopsis genes and showed 
that these also differentially induced HSP70. Through a comparison of different 
promoterreporter constructs and through measurements of the steady-state levels 
of the individual proteins, it appeared that the HSP70 response reflected the 
ability of the cytosol to sense individual properties of particular proteins 
when expressed at high levels. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the unfolded 
protein response observed when the induced accumulation of proteins in the 
endoplasmic reticulum also induces a specific suite of chaperones.

Abstract

Different cytoplasmically replicating RNA viruses were shown to induce a specific subset of heat-inducible heat shock protein 70 ( HSP70 ) genes in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ). To identify the inducing principle, a promoter∷reporter system was developed for the facile analysis of differentially responding Arabidopsis HSP70 genes, by infiltration into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Through transient expression of individual viral cistrons or through deletion analysis of a viral replicon, we were unable to identify a unique inducer of HSP70 . However, there was a positive correlation between the translatability of the test construct and the differential induction of HSP70 . Since these data implied a lack of specificity in the induction process, we also expressed a random series of cytosolically targeted Arabidopsis genes and showed that these also differentially induced HSP70 . Through a comparison of different promoter∷reporter constructs and through measurements of the steady-state levels of the individual proteins, it appeared that the HSP70 response reflected the ability of the cytosol to sense individual properties of particular proteins when expressed at high levels. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the unfolded protein response observed when the induced accumulation of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum also induces a specific suite of chaperones.

DISCUSSION

HSP70 expression is induced in response to diverse biotic and abiotic stresses. We and others have reported the induction of HSP70 by a wide range of viruses in diverse host plants, including pea ( Pisum sativum ), N. benthamiana , squash ( Cucurbita pepo ), tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum ), and Arabidopsis ( Aranda et al., 1996 ; Escaler et al., 2000 ; Havelda and Maule, 2000 ; Jockusch et al., 2001 ; Whitham et al., 2003 ). Based on the differential induction of heat-inducible genes by virus infection and heat shock, we also proposed that there may be specific induction mechanisms that would meet the particular needs of viral genome replication and expression and of viral pathogenesis ( Aranda et al., 1999 ). Following this rationale, we aimed to identify the nature of the viral inducer using the model plant Arabidopsis. In line with the cytosolic location for the replication of most plant RNA viruses, we focused particularly on the family of cytosolic HSP70s. Of the five cytosolic HSP70 genes, all but one were induced by a variety of different RNA viruses although all the genes were heat inducible, again indicating that the mechanism of transcriptional induction by viruses may be specific.

To explore the induction process in more detail, we transferred the induction principle to the more experimentally tractable and reproducible host for transient expression, N. benthamiana . Using 2.1 kb and 1.98 kb of upstream genomic DNA for HSP70 and HSP70B , respectively, for the construction of promoter∷reporter fusions, we established that the transcriptional regulation by heat and by virus infection was preserved after infiltration into leaves of N. benthamiana . This was a specific response to virus infection since no induction of either construct was observed after infiltration of Agrobacterium carrying an empty binary expression vector.

Three experimental strategies were used to identify the viral inducer of HSP70 : (1) the expression of individual viral cistrons of TCV; (2) the deletion of functional cistrons from the TCV replicon; and (3) the expression of miscellaneous cistrons from other RNA viruses. This approach had the potential to identify single inducers, combinatorial inducers, indirect inducers (e.g. indirect effect of RNA replication), or classes of inducers (e.g. viral MP class or silencing suppressor protein class). TCV has a relatively simple genome that includes all the essential factors for virus replication and pathogenesis. In addition, we tested four genes from other viruses. TMV-MP assists virus movement by modifying plasmodesmata ( Waigmann et al., 1994 ). The precise function of PSbMV-P1 is not known, but P1 from the closely related potyvirus tobacco etch virus has been shown to be an ancillary factor to the potyvirus RNA interference suppressor HC-Pro ( Kasschau and Carrington, 1998 ). Again, the precise function of PSbMV-6K1CI is not known, but the CI protein accumulates in recently infected cells as characteristic inclusions positioned over plasmodesmal openings ( Roberts et al., 1998 ) and has therefore been proposed to have a role in virus movement. CymRSV-p19 is the suppressor of RNA interference for this virus ( Havelda et al., 2003 ). We also used the bipartite nature of TRV to distinguish between viral protein expression and the properties of a viral replicon for a single virus.

The surprising outcome from all these experiments was that the only consistent correlation was that induction of HSP70 , but not HSP70B , was linked to the translatability of the CaMV 35S-driven expression cassette. From the appropriate controls, we excluded any roles for the CaMV 35S promoter or viral RNA sequence as effective inducers. The generic nature of this induction was confirmed when we tested the expression of five randomly selected cytosolically targeted Arabidopsis genes for HSP70 induction. Since these genes were expressed as fusions to GFP, we could use the GFP as an assayable marker for protein accumulation. From this it was apparent that there was no correlation for the different genes between protein accumulation and the transcriptional activation of pHSP70∷GUS. Nevertheless, for a particular gene, the amount of protein accumulating was related to the strength of the promoter. Hence, 35S∷At3g23600 resulted in significantly more protein accumulation and was a much more effective inducer than NOS∷At3g23600. A similar difference in transcriptional induction was observed for 35S∷PSbMV-6K1CI and NOS∷PSbMV-6K1CI.

Since the various genes expressed from the CaMV 35S promoter show very different levels of pHSP70∷GUS induction and yet induction can be modulated by reducing the level of expression (i.e. from the NOS promoter), it appears that the plant cell perceives a characteristic of individual proteins that correlates with their specific total level of accumulation. The most likely characteristic is the proportion of each protein that achieves a misfolded state. This is supported by the important observation that TMV mutants with temperature-sensitive coat proteins are more able than wild-type TMV to induce HSP70 and that this correlates with protein aggregation in vivo ( Jockusch et al., 2001 ).

HSP70 expression is autoregulated by HSP70 binding to heat shock factor (HSF), preventing the trimerization necessary for HSF binding to the heat shock element and the activation of HSP transcription ( Morimoto, 1998 ). Heat causes protein denaturation and the diversion of HSP70 to protein repair, releasing HSF. The difference between pHSP70∷GUS and pHSP70B∷GUS shows that heat-induced protein damage is not the only induction mechanism but that HSP70 , and probably the other virus-induced HSC genes, are linked to a mechanism that may be able to sense misfolded protein directly.

Such a phenomenon is very reminiscent of the much-studied UPR. In this case, inhibition of protein glycosylation, for example, using tunicamycin, results in the accumulation of incompletely folded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and the transcriptional induction of a suite of chaperones, such as the luminal binding protein BiP ( Rutkowski and Kaufman, 2004 ). Initially characterized in yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ), the UPR has been demonstrated in Arabidopsis ( Martínez and Chrispeels, 2003 ; Noh et al., 2003 ). Our data are consistent with the existence of a parallel mechanism for sensing misfolded proteins in the plant cytosol.

The differential virus induction of pHSP70∷GUS and pHSP70B∷GUS suggests that the transient increase in HSP70 accumulation associated with active virus replication is part of a broader response triggered by the accumulation of viral structural and nonstructural proteins. So far, it is only for members of the Closteroviridae that a definitive role has been identified for an HSP70-like protein in virus infection. It seems certain, however, that HSP70 induction for wild-type viruses would not be irrelevant, as the induced HSP70 could contribute to viral protein folding and turnover and could play a part in other virus functions necessary for the development of disease, e.g. cell-to-cell trafficking.
