In the crystal structure of the native GroEL.GroES.substrate protein complex 
from Thermus thermophilus, one GroEL subunit makes contact with two GroES 
subunits. One contact is through the H-I helices, and the other is through a 
novel GXXLE region. The side chain of Leu, in the GXXLE region, forms a 
hydrophobic cluster with residues of the H helix (Shimamura, T., 
Koike-Takeshita, A., Yokoyama, K., Masui, R., Murai, N., Yoshida, M., Taguchi, 
H., and Iwata, S. (2004) Structure (Camb.) 12, 1471-1480). Here, we investigated 
the functional role of Leu in the GXXLE region, using Escherichia coli GroEL. 
The results are as follows: (i) cross-linking between introduced cysteines 
confirmed that the GXXLE region in the E. coli GroEL.GroES complex is also in 
contact with GroES; (ii) when Leu was replaced by Lys (GroEL(L309K)) or other 
charged residues, chaperone activity was largely lost; (iii) the 
GroEL(L309K).substrate complex failed to bind GroES to produce a stable 
GroEL(L309K).GroES.substrate complex, whereas free GroEL(L309K) bound GroES 
normally; (iv) the GroEL(L309K).GroES.substrate complex was stabilized with 
BeF(x), but the substrate protein in the complex was readily digested by 
protease, indicating that it was not properly encapsulated into the internal 
cavity of the complex. Thus, conformational communication between the two GroES 
contact sites, the H helix and the GXXLE region (through Leu(309)), appears to 
play a critical role in encapsulation of the substrate.
