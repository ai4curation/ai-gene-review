Abstract

Mdm2 is a crucial negative regulator of the tumor suppressor function of p53. However, little is known about Mdm2 protein stability regulation by other tumor suppressors. Nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner ( SHP , NROB2) functions as a tumor suppressor in liver cancer. We show here a surprising finding of a feedback regulatory loop between SHP and Mdm2. SHP stabilizes Mdm2 protein by abrogating Mdm2 self-ubiquitination, and Mdm2 in turn attenuates SHP protein levels under p53 -deficient conditions. Such cross-regulation critically depends on the physical interaction of SHP with Mdm2 through the SHP K170 residue. The Mdm2-SHP interplay represents a novel component of Mdm2 signaling that is likely to dictate Mdm2 activity and function.

1. Introduction

Small heterodimer partner ( SHP , NROB2), a unique member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a pleiotropic transcriptional regulator of genes involved in various metabolic diseases [ 1 – 17 ]. Our recent studies also identified SHP as a critical regulator of microRNA expression and function [ 18 – 25 ]. Interestingly, we observed spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) formation in SHP −/− mice due to hepatocyte hyperproliferation [ 26 ] and decreased apoptosis [ 27 ]. SHP expression was also diminished in human HCC by epigenetic silencing of the SHP promoter [ 28 ], suggesting that SHP is a good prognostic factor in HCC [ 29 ]. Importantly, SHP functions as a transcriptional repressor of DNA methyltranferase Dnmt1 expression via ERRγ [ 30 ] and zinc/MTF-1 mediated regulation [ 31 ]. Despite these important findings, in particular the novel tumor suppressor function of SHP in liver cancer, it is poorly understood how SHP regulates carginogenesis through cross-interaction with other tumor suppressors or oncogenes.

Mdm2 is a well characterized negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53 [ 32 ]. The direct binding of Mdm2 to p53 inhibits the transcriptional activation function of p53 [ 33 ]. Mdm2 targets p53 for proteasomal degradation through Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [ 34 ]. Phosphorylation of Mdm2 inhibits its E3 ligase activity and prevents the ability of Mdm2 to repress p53 [ 35 , 36 ]. Mdm2 also suppresses p53 translation by interacting directly with p53 mRNA [ 37 ], or by targeting ribosomal protein RPL26 for degradation [ 38 ]. Mdm2 is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors, consistent with a role as an oncogene [ 39 ]. However, growing evidence suggests Mdm2 as a tumor suppressor under specific physiological conditions. Loss of Mdm2 in a p53 mutant mouse model enhanced tumor formation [ 40 ]. Mdm2 facilitates nuclear export of p53 [ 41 ], thereby activating the p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway [ 42 ] and contributing to the tumor suppressor activity of p53 [ 43 ]. These observations suggest that Mdm2 may play as a double-edged sword in tumorigenesis.

Currently, little is known about Mdm2 protein stability regulation by other tumor suppressors and how this may contribute to its tumor suppressor function under certain cellular contexts. As a potential additional layer of regulation of protein stability, the present study explored the crosstalk between SHP and Mdm2. Demonstration of a feedback loop between SHP and Mdm2 reveals a fine tuned interplay of SHP and Mdm2 proteins. The findings provide the first evidence that Mdm2 protein stability is enhanced by a nuclear transcriptional repressor.

Discussion

In this study, we show that SHP markedly increases Mdm2 protein stability by preventing Mdm2 self-ubiquitination. Mdm2 also causes rapid SHP degradation under p53 -deficient conditions, thus creating an autoregulatory loop with SHP. Our study reveals a fine tuned interplay between SHP and Mdm2, which provides new insight into the mechanisms of Mdm2 activation mediated by a nuclear transcriptional repressor.

The recent discovery of certain natural occurring SHP variants provided key insights into the structural basis of the SHP-Mdm2 interaction. Despite its lower stability SHPK170N shows the highest ability to induce Mdm2 protein, whereas the more stable SHPK170R is unable to induce Mdm2 protein or decrease its degradation. This likely reflects the enhanced binding of Mdm2 to SHPK170N and its decreased binding to SHPK170R. Therefore, K170 appears to be a critical lysine residue through which SHP exerts its activity to regulate Mdm2 protein stability. On the other hand, the Mdm2 and SHP interaction is independent of p53, and Mdm2 does not require the presence of p53 to decrease SHP. The Mdm2-mediated SHP decrease is not affected by deletion of its RING or acidic domain, confirming that the interaction between SHP and Mdm2 through K170 is critical for their cross-regulation.

The autoregulatory feedback loop between SHP and Mdm2 is somewhat similar, although not identical, to the regulatory relationship between p53 and Mdm2. Accordingly, p53 activates Mdm2 gene transcription [ 48 ] and Mdm2 in turn targets p53 protein for proteasomal degradation [ 34 ]. A recent study reported that SHP was ubiquitinated at K122 and K123, and mutation of these sites to arginine (R) increased SHP stability by reducing ubiquitination [ 47 ]. However, the SHPK122/123R protein was still rapidly degraded by Mdm2 (not shown), suggesting that K122 and K123 may not be the essential residues for Mdm2-mediated SHP degradation in the cellular context of the present study.

We are aware of one prior report of crosstalk among TR3 (Nur77), p53, and Mdm2 [ 49 ]. There are fundamental differences with regard to the crosstalk between SHP or TR3 with Mdm2. SHP induces Mdm2, but TR3 represses Mdm2. SHP interacts with both Mdm2 and p53, yet TR3 interacts with p53 but not Mdm2. Mdm2 and p53 bind to each other with higher affinity than to SHP, whereas TR3 has a higher p53 binding affinity and can sequestrate p53 from Mdm2. It is apparent that SHP and TR3 play unique roles in regulating Mdm2 pathway which results in distinct outcomes. It remains to be determined whether the interaction between SHP and TR3 [ 50 ] affects the crosstalk between SHP and Mdm2.

In summary, our results establish a critical role for SHP in keeping the protein level of Mdm2 in check. SHP itself is also tightly regulated by Mdm2 in a negative feedback fashion. Future studies will be focused on elucidating how their cross-regulation affects the function of Mdm2 and SHP in carcinogenesis.
