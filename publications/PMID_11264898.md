Iron is suspected to be involved in the induction and/or progression of various 
human tumors. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of iron 
on endothelial cells, keeping in mind that the homeostasis of microvessels plays 
a critical role in neo-angiogenesis. Applying a model of human dermal 
microvascular endothelial cell terminal differentiation and death induced by 
serum deprivation, we found that iron salts (iron chloride and ferric 
nitrilotriacetate) provided a survival advantage to endothelial cells. Using 
immunohistochemistry and Western Blot analysis, we found that the extended 
cellular life span induced by iron was paralleled by an increase of Bcl-2 
protein expression. Taken together, these observations suggest that iron may 
give a survival advantage to endothelial cells and represent a novel mechanism 
through which iron may contribute to tumorigenesis.
