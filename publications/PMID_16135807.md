The NuA4 complex is a histone H4/H2A acetyltransferase involved in transcription 
and DNA repair. While histone acetylation is important in many processes, it has 
become increasingly clear that additional histone modifications also play a 
crucial interrelated role. To understand how NuA4 action is regulated, we tested 
various H4 tail peptides harboring known modifications in HAT assays. While 
dimethylation at arginine 3 (R3M) had little effect on NuA4 activity, 
phosphorylation of serine 1 (S1P) strongly decreased the ability of the complex 
to acetylate H4 peptides. However, R3M in combination with S1P alleviates the 
repression of NuA4 activity. Chromatin from cells treated with DNA 
damage-inducing agents shows an increase in phosphorylation of serine 1 and a 
concomitant decrease in H4 acetylation. We found that casein kinase 2 
phosphorylates histone H4 and associates with the Rpd3 deacetylase complex, 
demonstrating a physical connection between phosphorylation of serine 1 and 
unacetylated H4 tails. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments also link local 
phosphorylation of H4 with its deacetylation, during both transcription and DNA 
repair. Time course chromatin immunoprecipitation data support a model in which 
histone H4 phosphorylation occurs after NuA4 action during double-strand break 
repair at the step of chromatin restoration and deacetylation. These findings 
demonstrate that H4 phospho-serine 1 regulates chromatin acetylation by the NuA4 
complex and that this process is important for normal gene expression and DNA 
repair.
