Islet cell autoantigen of 69 kDa (ICA69) is a cytosolic protein of still unknown 
function. Involvement of ICA69 in neurosecretion has been suggested by the 
impairment of acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions upon mutation of 
its homologue gene ric-19 in C. elegans. In this study, we have further 
investigated the localization of ICA69 in neurons and insulinoma INS-1 cells. 
ICA69 was enriched in the perinuclear region, whereas it did not co-localize 
with markers of synaptic vesicles/synaptic-like microvesicles. Confocal 
microscopy and subcellular fractionation in INS-1 cells showed co-localization 
of ICA69 with markers of the Golgi complex and, to a minor extent, with immature 
insulin-containing secretory granules. The association of ICA69 with these 
organelles was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. Virtually no ICA69 
immunogold labeling was observed on secretory granules near the plasma membrane, 
suggesting that ICA69 dissociates from secretory granule membranes during their 
maturation. In silico sequence and structural analyses revealed that the 
N-terminal region of ICA69 is similar to the region of arfaptins that interacts 
with ARF1, a small GTPase involved in vesicle budding at the Golgi complex and 
immature secretory granules. ICA69 is therefore a novel arfaptin-related protein 
that is likely to play a role in membrane trafficking at the Golgi complex and 
immature secretory granules in neurosecretory cells.
