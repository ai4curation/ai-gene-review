HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer) is a tumour suppressor gene located in 17p13.3, 
a region frequently hypermethylated or deleted in many types of prevalent human 
tumour. HIC1 is also a candidate for a contiguous-gene syndrome, the 
Miller-Dieker syndrome, a severe form of lissencephaly accompanied by 
developmental anomalies. HIC1 encodes a BTB/POZ-zinc finger transcriptional 
repressor. HIC1 represses transcription via two autonomous repression domains, 
an N-terminal BTB/POZ and a central region, by trichostatin A-insensitive and 
trichostatin A-sensitive mechanisms, respectively. The HIC1 central region 
recruits the corepressor CtBP (C-terminal binding protein) through a conserved 
GLDLSKK motif, a variant of the consensus C-terminal binding protein interaction 
domain PxDLSxK/R. Here, we show that HIC1 interacts with both CtBP1 and CtBP2 
and that this interaction is stimulated by agents increasing NADH levels. 
Furthermore, point mutation of two CtBP2 residues forming part of the structure 
of the recognition cleft for a PxDLS motif also ablates the interaction with a 
GxDLS motif. Conversely, in perfect agreement with the structural data and the 
universal conservation of this residue in all C-terminal binding 
protein-interacting motifs, mutation of the central leucine residue (leucine 225 
in HIC1) abolishes the interaction between HIC1 and CtBP1 or CtBP2. As expected 
from the corepressor activity of CtBP, this mutation also impairs the 
HIC1-mediated transcriptional repression. These results thus demonstrate a 
strong conservation in the binding of C-terminal binding protein-interacting 
domains despite great variability in their amino acid sequences. Finally, this 
L225A point mutation could also provide useful knock-in animal models to study 
the role of the HIC1-CtBP interaction in tumorigenesis and in development.
