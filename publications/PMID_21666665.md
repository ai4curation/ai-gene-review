Polyhydroxylated steroids are regulators of body shape and size in higher 
organisms. In metazoans, intracellular receptors recognize these molecules. 
Plants, however, perceive steroids at membranes, using the membrane-integral 
receptor kinase BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1). Here we report the 
structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana BRI1 ligand-binding domain, determined by 
X-ray diffraction at 2.5 Å resolution. We find a superhelix of 25 twisted 
leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), an architecture that is strikingly different from 
the assembly of LRRs in animal Toll-like receptors. A 70-amino-acid island 
domain between LRRs 21 and 22 folds back into the interior of the superhelix to 
create a surface pocket for binding the plant hormone brassinolide. Known loss- 
and gain-of-function mutations map closely to the hormone-binding site. We 
propose that steroid binding to BRI1 generates a docking platform for a 
co-receptor that is required for receptor activation. Our findings provide 
insight into the activation mechanism of this highly expanded family of plant 
receptors that have essential roles in hormone, developmental and innate 
immunity signalling.

Abstract

Polyhydroxylated steroids are regulators of body shape and size in higher organisms. In metazoans intracellular receptors recognise these molecules. Plants however perceive steroids at membranes, using the membrane-integral receptor kinase BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1). The BRI1 ectodomain structure at 2.5 angstrom resolution reveals a superhelix of 25 twisted leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), an architecture that is strikingly different from the assembly of LRRs in animal Toll-like receptors. A 70 amino-acid island domain between LRRs 21 and 22 folds back into the interior of the superhelix to create a surface pocket for binding the plant hormone brassinolide. Known loss- and gain-of-function mutations closely map to the hormone-binding site. We propose that steroid binding to BRI1 generates a docking platform for a co-receptor that is required for receptor activation. Our findings have mechanistic implications for hormone, developmental and innate immunity signaling pathways in plants that use similar receptors.

Discussion

The structure of the BRI1 ectodomain offers several new insights, and its twisted shape will likely characterise the architecture of many plant LRR-RKs 1 . The presence of a folded domain-insert appears to be an adaptation to recognition of a small molecule ligand, a challenge that smaller LRR proteins have met by generating loop insertions into their capping motifs 41 . This fascinating mode of ligand recognition reveals how steroids can be sensed at membranes and rationalises a large set of genetic and biochemical findings 2 , 7 , 32 , 38 .

Different BRI1 receptor activation mechanisms have been proposed including ligand-dependent dimerisation as seen for TLRs 25 , 26 and ligand-induced conformational changes in preformed homodimers 13 . Our analyses suggest that the superhelical shape of the BRI1 ectodomain is incompatible with homodimerisation, and that the isolated ectodomain behaves as a monomer even in the presence of steroid. These findings leave us with the alternative hypothesis that another protein factor could bind to the interaction platform in BRI1 that would minimally encompass the steroid ligand, LRRs 21–25 and parts of the island domain ( Fig. 4a ). While it is possible that an unknown protein fulfils this role and provides a dimerisation interface for two BRI1 molecules (as seen for example for TLR4 26 ), genetic and biochemical screens have not uncovered this protein. It is thus possible that the small receptor kinase BAK1 acts as a direct brassinosteroid co-receptor, as suggested previously 10 , 20 . It has been demonstrated that BAK1 is a genetic component of the brassinosteroid pathway 20 , 21 , that BRI1 and BAK1 interact in a steroid-dependent manner 22 and that both receptors trans-phosphorylate each other upon ligand stimulus 22 . Notably, a homology model of the BAK1 ectodomain ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ) is compatible in size and shape with the interaction platform in BRI1, and the BAK1 elg allele, which maps to the BAK1 ectodomain ( Supplementary Fig. 14 ), renders plants hypersensitive to brassinosteroid treatment 42 . We speculate that the sud1 , bri1-6 , bri1-102 and elg mutations modulate the interaction between the BRI1 and BAK1 ectodomains in a brassinosteroid-dependent manner ( Supplementary Fig. 14 ). The demonstration that BAK1 is essential for brassinosteroid sensing may have been obscured owing to genetic redundancy 20 , with at least two BAK1-like proteins interacting with BRI1 in vivo 43 , 44 . We recently overcame this limitation by showing that the BRI1 inhibitor protein BKI1 blocks the interaction between the BAK1 and BRI1 kinase domains 18 . Importantly, transgenic lines that constitutively deliver BKI1 to the site of BRI1 signalling, resemble strong BRI1 loss-of-function mutants, suggesting an important role for receptor - co-receptor association in brassinosteroid signal initiation 18 .

Future studies will undoubtedly test this heteromerisation model and dissect the relative contributions of the BRI1 and BAK1 ectodomains, their transmembrane segments and their cytoplasmic kinase domains to receptor activation. It will become important then to understand how BAK1 could serve as co-receptor for other LRR-RK signalling pathways 5 , 19 .

Methods Summary

The StrepII-9xHis fused BRI1 ectodomain (residues 29–788) was produced by secreted expression in baculovirus-infected insect cells, harvested 4 d post-infection by ultrafiltration and purified by tandem affinity chromatography, and by gel filtration. BRI1 was concentrated to 15 mg/ml and crystallised by vapour diffusion using a reservoir solution containing 14% PEG 4,000, 0.2 M (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 0.1 M citric acid (pH 4.0). The brassinolide complex was obtained by co-crystallisation. Diffraction data to 2.5 Å resolution were collected on a rotating anode X-ray generator and at beam-line 8.2.1 of the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Berkeley. The structure was solved using the SIRAS method. Data and refinement statistics are summarised in Supplementary Table 1 .
