Subcellular proteomics, which includes isolation of subcellular components prior 
to a proteomic analysis, is advantageous not only in characterizing large 
macro-molecular complexes such as organelles but also in elucidating mechanisms 
of protein transport and organelle biosynthesis. Because of the high sensitivity 
achieved by the present proteomics technology, the purity of samples to be 
analyzed is important for the interpretation of the results obtained. In the 
present study, peroxisomes isolated from rat liver by usual cell fractionation 
were further purified by immunoisolation using a specific antibody raised 
against a peroxisomal membrane protein, PMP70. The isolated peroxisomes were 
analyzed by SDS-PAGE combined with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. 
Altogether 34 known peroxisomal proteins were identified in addition to several 
mitochondrial and microsomal proteins. Some of the latter may reside in the 
peroxisomes as well. Analysis of membrane fractions identified all known 
peroxins except for Pex7. Two new peroxisomal proteins of unknown function were 
of high abundance. One is a bi-functional protein consisting of an 
aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-domain and an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase domain. 
The other is a newly identified peroxisome-specific isoform of Lon protease, an 
ATP-dependent protease with chaperone-like activity. The peroxisomal 
localization of the protein was confirmed by immunological techniques. The 
peroxisome-type Lon protease, which is distinct from the mitochondrial isoform, 
may play an important role in the peroxisomal biogenesis.
