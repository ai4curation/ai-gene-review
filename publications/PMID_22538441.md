In this work, we studied the effects of CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1 gene 
(CSMD1) expression in A375 melanoma cells in vivo and in vitro. CSDM1 expression 
decreased proliferation and migration, and increased apoptosis and G(1) arrest 
in A375 cells in vitro. Expression of CSDM1 in established xenografted tumors 
decreased tumor size and weight, and decreased the density of intratumor 
microvessels. The survival rate of mice with tumors expressing CSMD1 was 
significantly higher than mice with tumors that did not express CSDM1. These 
results confirm the role of CSDM1 as a tumor suppressor gene in melanoma cells. 
Furthermore, we found that CSMD1 can interact with Smad3, activate Smad1, Smad2, 
and Smad3, and increase the expression of Smad4. These results might prove 
helpful for the development of novel therapies for melanoma treatment.
