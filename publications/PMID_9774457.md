Stimulation of platelet aggregation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of a 
number of receptors and signaling molecules including platelet endothelial cell 
adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). In this report, we demonstrate that both 
protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 physically associate with 
different kinetics of assembly with tyrosine-phosphorylated human PECAM-1 during 
integrin alphaIIbbeta3-mediated platelet aggregation. Peptido-precipitation 
analysis revealed that tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides encompassing residues 
658-668 and 681-691 of PECAM-1 bound specifically to both protein-tyrosine 
phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. We further show that the association of SHP-1 with 
PECAM-1 occurs through the direct interaction of the src homology region 2 
domains of SHP-1 with two highly conserved phosphotyrosine binding motifs within 
PECAM-1 having the sequences NSDVQpY663TEVQV and DTETVpY686SEVRK (where pY 
represents phosphotyrosine). In vitro dephosphorylation experiments using 
phosphotyrosyl PECAM-1 peptides encompassing either Tyr-663 or Tyr-686 revealed 
induction of SHP-1 catalytic activity, suggesting that PECAM-1 serves as a SHP-1 
substrate. Surface plasmon resonance studies reveal that recombinant SHP-2 binds 
PECAM-1 phosphopeptides with 5-fold higher affinity than recombinant SHP-1. 
These data suggest that in hematopoietic cells such as platelets, PECAM-1 
cellular signaling is regulated by the selective recruitment and activation of 
two distinct protein-tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2, via a common 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory-like motif.
