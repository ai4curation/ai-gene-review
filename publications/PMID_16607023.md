The ribosome-associated molecular chaperone complexes RAC (Ssz1p/Zuo1p) and 
Ssb1p/Ssb2p expose a link between protein folding and translation. Disruption of 
the conserved nascent peptide-associated complex results in cell growth and 
translation fidelity defects. To better understand the consequences of deletion 
of either RAC or Ssb1p/2p, experiments relating to cell growth and programmed 
ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) were assayed. Genetic analyses revealed that 
deletion of Ssb1p/Ssb2p or of Ssz1p/Zuo1p resulted in specific inhibition of -1 
PRF and defects in Killer virus maintenance, while no effects were observed on 
+1 PRF. These factors may provide a new set of targets to exploit against 
viruses that use -1 PRF. Quantitative measurements of growth profiles of 
isogenic wild-type and mutant cells showed that translational inhibitors 
exacerbate underlying growth defects in these mutants. Previous studies have 
identified -1 PRF signals in yeast chromosomal genes and have demonstrated an 
inverse relationship between -1 PRF efficiency and mRNA stability. Analysis of 
published DNA microarray experiments reveals conditions under which Ssb1, Ssb2, 
Ssz1, and Zuo1 transcript levels are regulated independently of those of genes 
encoding ribosomal proteins. Thus, the findings presented here suggest that 
these trans-acting factors could be used by cells to posttranscriptionally 
regulate gene expression through -1 PRF.
