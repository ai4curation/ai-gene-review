Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK) is an ubiquitous enzyme with the function of 
a signal transducer. In Neurospora crassa, an ndk-1(P72H) mutant carrying the 
point mutation Pro72His was isolated. We found that ndk-1(P72H) showed 
hypersensitivity to oxidative and heat stress and a decrease in the levels of 
catalase (Cat)-1 and -3 induced by oxidative, heat stress and illumination 
compared with wild type (Wt). We found, by conducting a yeast two-hybrid assay, 
that Cat-1 interacted with NDK-1. NDK-1 was suggested to control Cat-1 and Cat-3 
at the post-transcriptional level in response to heat, oxidative stress and 
light.
