DNA topoisomerase II is an essential nuclear enzyme that modulates DNA processes 
by altering the topological state of double-stranded DNA. This enzyme is 
required for chromosome condensation and segregation; however, the regulatory 
mechanism of its activation is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that 
topoisomerase IIalpha is activated in response to genotoxic stress. Concomitant 
with the activation, the expression of topoisomerase IIalpha is increased 
following DNA damage. The results also demonstrate that the proapoptotic kinase 
protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta) interacts with topoisomerase IIalpha. This 
association is in an S-phase-specific manner and is required for stabilization 
and catalytic activation of topoisomerase IIalpha in response to DNA damage. 
Conversely, inhibition of PKCdelta activity attenuates DNA damage-induced 
activation of topoisomerase IIalpha. Finally, aberrant activation of 
topoisomerase IIalpha by PKCdelta is associated with induction of apoptosis upon 
exposure to genotoxic agents. These findings indicate that PKCdelta regulates 
topoisomerase IIalpha and thereby cell fate in the genotoxic stress response.

Abstract

DNA topoisomerase II is an essential nuclear enzyme that modulates DNA processes by altering the topological state of double-stranded DNA. This enzyme is required for chromosome condensation and segregation; however, the regulatory mechanism of its activation is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that topoisomerase IIα is activated in response to genotoxic stress. Concomitant with the activation, the expression of topoisomerase IIα is increased following DNA damage. The results also demonstrate that the proapoptotic kinase protein kinase C δ (PKCδ) interacts with topoisomerase IIα. This association is in an S-phase-specific manner and is required for stabilization and catalytic activation of topoisomerase IIα in response to DNA damage. Conversely, inhibition of PKCδ activity attenuates DNA damage-induced activation of topoisomerase IIα. Finally, aberrant activation of topoisomerase IIα by PKCδ is associated with induction of apoptosis upon exposure to genotoxic agents. These findings indicate that PKCδ regulates topoisomerase IIα and thereby cell fate in the genotoxic stress response.
