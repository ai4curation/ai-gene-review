The centrosome acts as a centre for microtubule organisation and plays crucial 
roles in cell polarity, migration, growth and division. Cep131 has recently been 
described as a basal body component essential for cilium formation, but its 
function in non-ciliogenic cells is unknown. We identified human Cep131 (also 
known as AZI1) in a screen for regulators of genome stability. We show that 
centrosomal localisation of Cep131 is cell-cycle-regulated and requires both an 
intact microtubule network and a functional dynein-dynactin transport system. 
Cep131 is recruited to centriolar satellites by PCM1, and localised to the 
centriolar core region by both pericentrin and Cep290. Depletion of Cep131 
results in a reduction in proliferation rate, centriole amplification, an 
increased frequency of multipolar mitosis, chromosomal instability and an 
increase in post-mitotic DNA damage. These data therefore highlight the 
importance of human Cep131 for maintaining genomic integrity.
