The homeodomain protein TGIF represses transcription in part by recruiting 
histone deacetylases. TGIF binds directly to DNA to repress transcription or 
interacts with TGF-beta-activated Smads, thereby repressing genes normally 
activated by TGF-beta. Loss of function mutations in TGIF result in 
holoprosencephaly (HPE) in humans. One HPE mutation in TGIF results in a single 
amino acid substitution in a conserved PLDLS motif within the amino-terminal 
repression domain. We demonstrate that TGIF interacts with the corepressor 
carboxyl terminus-binding protein (CtBP) via this motif. CtBP, which was first 
identified by its ability to bind the adenovirus E1A protein, interacts both 
with gene-specific transcriptional repressors and with a subset of polycomb 
proteins. Efficient repression of TGF-beta-activated gene responses by TGIF is 
dependent on interaction with CtBP, and we show that TGIF is able to recruit 
CtBP to a TGF-beta-activated Smad complex. Disruption of the PLDLS motif in TGIF 
abolishes the interaction of CtBP with TGIF and compromises the ability of TGIF 
to repress transcription. Thus, at least one HPE mutation in TGIF appears to 
prevent CtBP-dependent transcriptional repression by TGIF, suggesting an 
important developmental role for the recruitment of CtBP by TGIF.
