The dynamin family of GTPases regulate mitochondrial fission and fusion 
processes and have been implicated in controlling the release of caspase 
activators from mitochondria during apoptosis. Here we report that profusion 
genes fzo-1 and eat-3 or the profission gene drp-1 are not required for 
apoptosis activation in C. elegans. However, minor proapoptotic roles for drp-1 
and fis-2, a homolog of human Fis1, are revealed in sensitized genetic 
backgrounds. drp-1 and fis-2 function independent of one another and the Bcl-2 
homolog CED-9 and downstream of the CED-3 caspase to promote elimination of 
mitochondria in dying cells, an event that could facilitate cell-death 
execution. Interestingly, CED-3 can cleave DRP-1, which appears to be important 
for DRP-1's proapoptotic function, but not its mitochondria fission function. 
Our findings demonstrate that mitochondria dynamics do not regulate apoptosis 
activation in C. elegans and reveal distinct roles for drp-1 and fis-2 as 
mediators of cell-death execution downstream of caspase activation.
