The protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 is implicated in the early steps of the 
T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling. Binding of ZAP-70 to the phosphorylated 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of the TCR zeta chain 
through its two src-homology 2 (SH2) domains results in its activation coupled 
to phosphorylation on multiple tyrosine residues, mediated by Src kinases 
including Lck as well as by autophosphorylation. The mechanism of ZAP-70 
activation following receptor binding is still not completely understood. Here 
we investigated the effect of intramolecular interactions and 
autophosphorylation by following the kinetics of recombinant ZAP-70 activation 
in a spectrophotometric substrate phosphorylation assay. Under these conditions, 
we observed a lag phase of several minutes before full ZAP-70 activation, which 
was not observed using a truncated form lacking the first 254 residues, 
suggesting that it might be due to an intramolecular interaction involving the 
interdomain A and SH2 region. Accordingly, the lag phase could be reproduced by 
testing the truncated form in the presence of recombinant SH2 domains and was 
abolished by the addition of diphosphorylated ITAM peptide. Preincubation with 
ATP or phosphorylation by Lck also abolished the lag phase and resulted in a 
more active enzyme. The same results were obtained using a ZAP-70 mutant lacking 
the interdomain B tyrosines. These findings are consistent with a mechanism in 
which ZAP-70 phosphorylation/autophosphorylation on tyrosine(s) other than 292, 
315, and 319, as well as engagement of the SH2 domains by the phosphorylated 
TCR, can induce a conformational change leading to accelerated enzyme kinetics 
and higher catalytic efficiency.
