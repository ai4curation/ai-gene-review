Neuromuscular synapse formation requires a complex exchange of signals between 
motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers, leading to the accumulation of 
postsynaptic proteins, including acetylcholine receptors in the muscle membrane 
and specialized release sites, or active zones in the presynaptic nerve 
terminal. MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed in skeletal muscle, 
and Agrin, a motor neuron-derived ligand that stimulates MuSK phosphorylation, 
play critical roles in synaptic differentiation, as synapses do not form in 
their absence, and mutations in MuSK or downstream effectors are a major cause 
of a group of neuromuscular disorders, termed congenital myasthenic syndromes 
(CMS). How Agrin activates MuSK and stimulates synaptic differentiation is not 
known and remains a fundamental gap in our understanding of signaling at 
neuromuscular synapses. Here, we report that Lrp4, a member of the LDLR family, 
is a receptor for Agrin, forms a complex with MuSK, and mediates MuSK activation 
by Agrin.
