Eukaryotic DNA is bound and interpreted by numerous protein complexes in the 
context of chromatin. A description of the full set of proteins that regulate 
specific loci is critical to understanding regulation. Here, we describe a 
protocol called proteomics of isolated chromatin segments (PICh) that addresses 
this issue. PICh uses a specific nucleic acid probe to isolate genomic DNA with 
its associated proteins in sufficient quantity and purity to allow 
identification of the bound proteins. Purification of human telomeric chromatin 
using PICh identified the majority of known telomeric factors and uncovered a 
large number of novel associations. We compared proteins found at telomeres 
maintained by the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway to proteins 
bound at telomeres maintained by telomerase. We identified and validated several 
proteins, including orphan nuclear receptors, that specifically bind to ALT 
telomeres, establishing PICh as a useful tool for characterizing chromatin 
composition.
