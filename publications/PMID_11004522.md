Using human glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) as bait in the yeast 
two-hybrid system, we identified a novel human centrosome associated protein, 
hNinein. When the full length cDNA of hNinein was sequenced, it showed that an 
open reading frame encoded a protein consisting of 2047 amino acids with a 
predicted molecular mass of 239 kDa. The features of this protein include a 
potential GTP binding site, a large coiled-coil domain together with four 
leucine zipper domains and a GSK-3beta binding site. Fluorescence microscopy 
experiment showed that hNinein is localized in the pericentriolar matrix of the 
centrosome. In addition, hNinein also showed to react with centrosomal 
autoantibody sera. Our findings suggest that hNinein may be involved in the 
formation of centrosome matrix and interacts with the GSK-3beta, implying that 
it may also be regulated by GSK-3beta phosphorylation signaling.
