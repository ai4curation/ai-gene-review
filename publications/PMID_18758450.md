Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional cytokine that 
regulates embryonic development and tissue homeostasis; however, aberrations of 
its activity occur in cancer. TGF-beta signals through its Type II and Type I 
receptors (TbetaRII and TbetaRI) causing phosphorylation of Smad proteins. 
TGF-beta-associated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the mitogen-activated protein 
kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family, was originally identified as an effector 
of TGF-beta-induced p38 activation. However, the molecular mechanisms for its 
activation are unknown. Here we report that the ubiquitin ligase (E3) TRAF6 
interacts with a consensus motif present in TbetaRI. The TbetaRI-TRAF6 
interaction is required for TGF-beta-induced autoubiquitylation of TRAF6 and 
subsequent activation of the TAK1-p38/JNK pathway, which leads to apoptosis. 
TbetaRI kinase activity is required for activation of the canonical Smad 
pathway, whereas E3 activity of TRAF6 regulates the activation of TAK1 in a 
receptor kinase-independent manner. Intriguingly, TGF-beta-induced 
TRAF6-mediated Lys 63-linked polyubiquitylation of TAK1 Lys 34 correlates with 
TAK1 activation. Our data show that TGF-beta specifically activates TAK1 through 
interaction of TbetaRI with TRAF6, whereas activation of Smad2 is not dependent 
on TRAF6.
