We describe genetic screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae designed to identify 
mammalian nonreceptor modulators of G-protein signaling pathways. Strains 
lacking a pheromone-responsive G-protein coupled receptor and expressing a 
mammalian-yeast Galpha hybrid protein were made conditional for growth upon 
either pheromone pathway activation (activator screen) or pheromone pathway 
inactivation (inhibitor screen). Mammalian cDNAs that conferred 
plasmid-dependent growth under restrictive conditions were identified. One of 
the cDNAs identified from the activator screen, a human Ras-related G protein 
that we term AGS1 (for activator of G-protein signaling), appears to function by 
facilitating guanosine triphosphate (GTP) exchange on the heterotrimeric Galpha. 
A cDNA product identified from the inhibitor screen encodes a previously 
identified regulator of G-protein signaling, human RGS5.
