The human polyomavirus, JC virus, has recently been associated with several 
human CNS tumors, including medulloblastomas and a broad range of glial-origin 
tumors. This ubiquitous virus is the causative agent of the rare demyelinating 
disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in immunocompromised 
individuals. Expression of the viral protein, T-antigen, which possesses the 
ability to transform cells of neural origin, has been detected in human CNS 
tumors. In an effort to further understand the transforming potential of JCV 
T-antigen, transgenic mice expressing JCV T-antigen under the control of the 
Mad-4 promoter were generated. As described previously, approximately 50% of the 
animals developed pituitary tumors by 1 year of age. However, a small subset of 
the animals developed solid masses arising from the soft tissues surrounding the 
salivary gland, the sciatic nerve, and along the extremities that histologically 
resemble malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, rare neoplasms that occur in 
individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). JCV T-antigen was detected in 
tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry and immunoprecipitation/Western blotting, 
but not in normal tissues and was colocalized with NF2, the putative tumor 
suppressor protein associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, in the nucleus of 
some cells. In addition, T-antigen was co-precipitated with NF2, but not with 
NF1 protein, although NF1 was detectable in tumor tissue. Furthermore, 
precipitated immunocomplexes contained T-antigen, NF2, and p53, suggesting that 
these three proteins may form a ternary complex. The importance of these 
findings on mechanisms of T-antigen-mediated tumorigenesis and the pathogenesis 
of neurofibromatosis are discussed. Oncogene (2004) 23, 5459-5467.
