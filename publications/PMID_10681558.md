A new type of peroxidase ("thiol peroxidase"; TPx) having cysteine as the 
primary site of catalysis has been discovered from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. In 
addition to two yeast TPx isoforms (TSA I and TSA II/AHPC1) previously 
described, three additional TPx homologues were identified by analysis of the 
open reading frame data base for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Three novel isoforms 
showed a distinct thiol peroxidase activity supported by thioredoxin, and 
appeared to be distinctively localized in cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus. 
Each isoform was named after its subcellular localization such as cytoplasmic 
TPx I (cTPx I or TSA I), cTPx II, cTPx III (TSA II/AHPC1), mitochondrial TPx 
(mTPx), and nuclear TPx (nTPx). Their transcriptional activities suggest that 
cTPx I and cTPx III are the most predominant isoforms among the five type 
isoforms. Transcriptional activities of TPx isoenzymes during yeast life span 
were quite different from each other. Unlike other TPx null mutants, cTPx I null 
mutant was hypersensitive to various oxidants except for 4-nitroquinoline 
N-oxide. The null mutant was more resistant toward 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide and 
acidic culture than its wild type. The severe growth retardation of cTPx II 
mutant resulted in accumulation of G(1)-phased cells. Based on kinetic 
properties of five isoforms, their subcellular localizations, and distinct 
physiology of each null mutant, we discussed the physiological functions of five 
types of TPx isoenzymes in yeast throughout the full growth cycle.
