Class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) contain unique amino-terminal extensions 
that mediate interactions with members of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) 
family of transcription factors and responsiveness to kinases, including 
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK). Despite intense investigation of class 
II HDACs, little is known of MEF2-independent mechanisms for transcriptional 
repression by these chromatin-modifying enzymes. Here, we demonstrate that class 
II HDACs 4 and 5 physically associate with ankyrin-repeat proteins ANKRA2 and 
RFXANK (RFX-B/Tvl-1/ANKRA1). ANKRA2 is a megalin- and BKCa potassium 
channel-interacting factor, whereas RFXANK is a positive regulator of major 
histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) gene expression. HDAC4 and HDAC5 interact 
with the ankyrin repeats of ANKRA2 and RFXANK and, through association with 
RFXANK, repress MHC II promoter activation. HDACs 4 and 5 also repress 
endogenous HLA-DRA gene expression induced by CIITA. Phosphorylation of class II 
HDACs by CaMK results in CRM1-dependent nuclear export of HDAC/RFXANK complexes. 
These results define a novel transcriptional pathway under the control of class 
II HDACs and suggest a role for these transcriptional repressors as 
signal-responsive regulators of antigen presentation.
