The Ccr4-Not complex has been implicated in the control of multiple steps of 
mRNA metabolism; however, its functions in transcription remain ambiguous. The 
discovery that Ccr4/Pop2 is the major cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylase and the 
detection of Not proteins within mRNA processing bodies have raised questions 
about the roles of the Ccr4-Not complex in transcription. Here we firmly 
establish Ccr4-Not as a positive elongation factor for RNA polymerase II 
(RNAPII). The Ccr4-Not complex is targeted to the coding region of genes in a 
transcription-dependent manner similar to RNAPII and promotes elongation in 
vivo. Furthermore, Ccr4-Not interacts directly with elongating RNAPII complexes 
and stimulates transcription elongation of arrested polymerase in vitro. 
Ccr4-Not can reactivate backtracked RNAPII using a mechanism different from that 
of the well-characterized elongation factor TFIIS. While not essential for its 
interaction with elongation complexes, Ccr4-Not interacts with the emerging 
transcript and promotes elongation in a manner dependent on transcript length, 
although this interaction is not required for it to bind RNAPII. Our 
comprehensive analysis shows that Ccr4-Not directly regulates transcription, and 
suggests it does so by promoting the resumption of elongation of arrested RNAPII 
when it encounters transcriptional blocks in vivo.
