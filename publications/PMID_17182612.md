Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent proinflammatory lipid mediator 
eliciting a variety of cellular functions. Lipid mediators, including PAF are 
produced from membrane phospholipids by enzymatic cascades. Although a G 
protein-coupled PAF receptor and degradation enzymes have been cloned and 
characterized, the PAF biosynthetic enzyme, aceyl-CoA:lyso-PAF 
acetyltransferase, has not been identified. Here, we cloned lyso-PAF 
acetyltransferase, which is critical in stimulus-dependent formation of PAF. The 
enzyme is a 60-kDa microsomal protein with three putative membrane-spanning 
domains. The enzyme was induced by bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), 
which was suppressed by dexamethasone treatment. Surprisingly, the enzyme 
catalyzed not only biosynthesis of PAF from lyso-PAF but also incorporation of 
arachidonoyl-CoA to produce PAF precursor membrane glycerophospholipids 
(lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase activity). Under resting conditions, 
the enzyme prefers arachidonoyl-CoA and contributes to membrane biogenesis. Upon 
acute inflammatory stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, the activated enzyme 
utilizes acetyl-CoA more efficiently and produces PAF. Thus, our findings 
provide a novel concept that a single enzyme catalyzes membrane biogenesis of 
inflammatory cells while producing a prophlogistic mediator in response to 
external stimuli.
