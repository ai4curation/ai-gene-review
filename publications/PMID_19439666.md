DnaK is the canonical Hsp70 molecular chaperone protein from Escherichia coli. 
Like other Hsp70s, DnaK comprises two main domains: a 44-kDa N-terminal 
nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) that contains ATPase activity, and a 25-kDa 
substrate-binding domain (SBD) that harbors the substrate-binding site. Here, we 
report an experimental structure for wild-type, full-length DnaK, complexed with 
the peptide NRLLLTG and with ADP. It was obtained in aqueous solution by using 
NMR residual dipolar coupling and spin labeling methods and is based on 
available crystal structures for the isolated NBD and SBD. By using dynamics 
methods, we determine that the NBD and SBD are loosely linked and can move in 
cones of +/-35 degrees with respect to each other. The linker region between the 
domains is a dynamic random coil. Nevertheless, an average structure can be 
defined. This structure places the SBD in close proximity of subdomain IA of the 
NBD and suggests that the SBD collides with the NBD at this area to establish 
allosteric communication.
