Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) catalyzes the uptake of LDL-cholesterol 
by liver and peripheral organs. The function of the LDLR is antagonized by 
pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which binds to LDLR at 
the plasma membrane inducing LDLR degradation. Here, we report that matrix 
metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) interacts with and cleaves PCSK9, as evidenced by 
proteomic, chemical cross-linkage, blue native-PAGE and domain-specific 
antibodies Western blot analyses. Furthermore, MMP-2 overexpression renders 
Hepa1-c1c7 cells resistant to PCSK9-induced LDLR degradation. The data suggest 
that pathological MMP-2 overexpression may protect the LDLR from PCSK-9-induced 
degradation.
