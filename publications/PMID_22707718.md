Cellulosomes are multienzyme complexes responsible for efficient degradation of 
plant cell wall polysaccharides. The nonenzymatic scaffoldin subunit provides a 
platform for cellulolytic enzyme binding that enhances the overall activity of 
the bound enzymes. Understanding the unique quaternary structural elements 
responsible for the enzymatic synergy of the cellulosome is hindered by the 
large size and inherent flexibility of these multiprotein complexes. Herein, we 
have used x-ray crystallography and small angle x-ray scattering to structurally 
characterize a ternary protein complex from the Clostridium thermocellum 
cellulosome that comprises a C-terminal trimodular fragment of the CipA 
scaffoldin bound to the SdbA type II cohesin module and the type I dockerin 
module from the Cel9D glycoside hydrolase. This complex represents the largest 
fragment of the cellulosome solved by x-ray crystallography to date and reveals 
two rigid domains formed by the type I cohesin·dockerin complex and by the X 
module-type II cohesin·dockerin complex, which are separated by a 13-residue 
linker in an extended conformation. The type I dockerin modules of the four 
structural models found in the asymmetric unit are in an alternate orientation 
to that previously observed that provides further direct support for the dual 
mode of binding. Conserved intermolecular contacts between symmetry-related 
complexes were also observed and may play a role in higher order cellulosome 
structure. SAXS analysis of the ternary complex revealed that the 13-residue 
intermodular linker of the scaffoldin subunit is highly dynamic in solution. 
These studies provide fundamental insights into modular positioning, linker 
flexibility, and higher order organization of the cellulosome.
