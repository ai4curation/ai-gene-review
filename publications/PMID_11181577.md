Sequence analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear candidate genes of complex I in 
children with deficiency of this complex and exhibiting Leigh-like syndrome has 
revealed, in one of them, a novel mutation in the NDUFS4 gene encoding the 18 
kDa subunit. Phosphorylation of this subunit by cAMP-dependent protein kinase 
has previously been found to activate the complex. The present mutation consists 
of a homozygous G-->A transition at nucleotide position +44 of the coding 
sequence of the gene, resulting in the change of a tryptophan codon to a stop 
codon. Such mutation causes premature termination of the protein after only 14 
amino acids of the putative mitochondrial targeting peptide. Fibroblast cultures 
from the patient exhibited severe reduction of the rotenone-sensitive NADH-->UQ 
oxidoreductase activity of complex I, which was insensitive to cAMP stimulation. 
Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed the absence of detectable normally 
assembled complex I in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These findings show 
that the expression of the NDUFS4 gene is essential for the assembly of a 
functional complex I.
