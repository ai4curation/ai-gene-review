Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, also called "childhood ataxia 
with central nervous system hypomyelination," is the first human disease related 
to mutations in any of the five genes encoding subunits of eukaryotic initiation 
factor eIF2B or any translation factor at all. eIF2B is essential in all cells 
of the body for protein synthesis and the regulation of this protein synthesis 
under different stress conditions. It is surprising that mutations in the eIF2B 
genes have been reported to lead to abnormalities of the white matter of the 
brain only, although it has been shown recently that ovarian failure may 
accompany the leukoencephalopathy. Another surprising observation is that the 
onset of the disease varies from early childhood to adulthood, with the 
exception of Cree leukoencephalopathy, a disease related to a particular 
mutation in one of the eIF2B genes, which invariably has its onset within the 
first year of life. We analyzed the eIF2B genes of nine patients with an 
antenatal- or early-infantile-onset encephalopathy and an early demise and found 
mutations in eight of the patients. In addition to signs of a serious 
encephalopathy, we found oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, 
cataracts, pancreatitis, hepatosplenomegaly, hypoplasia of the kidneys, and 
ovarian dysgenesis. Until now, no evidence had been found for a 
genotype-phenotype correlation, but the consistently severe phenotype in 
affected siblings among our patients and in Cree encephalopathy patients 
suggests an influence of the genotype on the phenotype.

Abstract

Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, also called “childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination,” is the first human disease related to mutations in any of the five genes encoding subunits of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2B or any translation factor at all. eIF2B is essential in all cells of the body for protein synthesis and the regulation of this protein synthesis under different stress conditions. It is surprising that mutations in the eIF2B genes have been reported to lead to abnormalities of the white matter of the brain only, although it has been shown recently that ovarian failure may accompany the leukoencephalopathy. Another surprising observation is that the onset of the disease varies from early childhood to adulthood, with the exception of Cree leukoencephalopathy, a disease related to a particular mutation in one of the eIF2B genes, which invariably has its onset within the first year of life. We analyzed the eIF2B genes of nine patients with an antenatal- or early-infantile–onset encephalopathy and an early demise and found mutations in eight of the patients. In addition to signs of a serious encephalopathy, we found oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, cataracts, pancreatitis, hepatosplenomegaly, hypoplasia of the kidneys, and ovarian dysgenesis. Until now, no evidence had been found for a genotype-phenotype correlation, but the consistently severe phenotype in affected siblings among our patients and in Cree encephalopathy patients suggests an influence of the genotype on the phenotype.
