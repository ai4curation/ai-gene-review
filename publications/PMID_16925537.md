AIM: The objective of this study is to describe the sleep patterns of secondary 
school students in New Zealand.
METHODS: This study uses data from a national secondary school youth health 
survey conducted in 2001. A total of 9567 students completed the survey with an 
overall response rate of 64.3%. Students were asked if they felt they got enough 
sleep and the numbers of sleep hours were estimated from self-reported bedtimes 
and awakening times during the week and weekend.
RESULTS: A significant proportion (21%) of students reported not getting enough 
sleep. Inadequate sleep was more common among older students and female students 
of Maori and New Zealand European ethnicity. The average amount of sleep 
secondary school students report in New Zealand is 8 h and 40 min during the 
week and 9 h and 23 min during the weekend. There was a shift towards later 
bedtimes and fewer total sleep hours among older students. Increasing hours of 
extracurricular activities and employment were generally associated with less 
sleep, especially among students engaging in more than 5 h a day of these 
activities.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant numbers of secondary school students report inadequate 
sleep. Given the importance of adequate sleep on healthy adolescent development, 
parents and health professionals should be wary of the amount of extracurricular 
activities that young people engage in, especially part-time employment and the 
potential negative impact it may have on the adequacy of their sleep.
