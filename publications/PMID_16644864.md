Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the 
NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Neurofibromin is encoded by NF1 and functions as a 
negative regulator of Ras activity. NF1 patients develop renal artery stenosis 
and arterial occlusions resulting in cerebral and visceral infarcts. Further, 
NF1 patients develop vascular neurofibromas where tumor vessels are invested in 
a dense pericyte sheath. Although it is well established that aberrations in Ras 
signaling lead to human malignancies, emerging data generated in genetically 
engineered mouse models now implicate perturbations in the Ras signaling axis in 
vascular smooth muscular cells (VSMCs) as central to the initiation and 
progression of neointimal hyperplasia and arterial stenosis. Despite these 
observations, the function of neurofibromin in regulating VSMC function and how 
Ras signals are terminated in VSMCs is virtually unknown. Utilizing VSMCs 
harvested from Nf1+/- mice and primary human neurofibromin-deficient VSMCs, we 
identify a discrete Ras effector pathway, which is tightly regulated by 
neurofibromin to limit VSMC proliferation and migration. Thus, these studies 
identify neurofibromin as a novel regulator of Ras activity in VSMCs and provide 
a framework for understanding cardiovascular disease in NF1 patients and a 
mechanism by which Ras signals are attenuated for maintaining VSMC homeostasis 
in blood vessel walls.
