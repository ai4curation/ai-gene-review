Chemosensation in the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans 
depends on sensory cilia, whose assembly and maintenance requires the transport 
of components such as axonemal proteins and signal transduction machinery to 
their site of incorporation into ciliary structures. Members of the heteromeric 
kinesin family of microtubule motors are prime candidates for playing key roles 
in these transport events. Here we describe the molecular characterization and 
partial purification of two heteromeric kinesin complexes from C. elegans, 
heterotrimeric CeKinesin-II and dimeric CeOsm-3. Transgenic worms expressing 
green fluorescent protein driven by endogenous heteromeric kinesin promoters 
reveal that both CeKinesin-II and CeOsm-3 are expressed in amphid, inner labial, 
and phasmid chemosensory neurons. Additionally, immunolocalization experiments 
on fixed worms show an intense concentration of CeKinesin-II and CeOsm-3 
polypeptides in the ciliated endings of these chemosensory neurons and a 
punctate localization pattern in the corresponding cell bodies and dendrites. 
These results, together with the phenotypes of known mutants in the pathway of 
sensory ciliary assembly, suggest that CeKinesin-II and CeOsm-3 drive the 
transport of ciliary components required for sequential steps in the assembly of 
chemosensory cilia.
