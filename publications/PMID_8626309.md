Many proteins require enzymatic assistance in order to achieve a functional 
conformation. One rate-limiting step in protein folding is the cis-trans 
isomerization of prolyl residues, a reaction catalyzed by prolyl isomerases. 
SurA, a periplasmic protein of Escherichia coli, has sequence similarity with 
the prolyl isomerase parvulin. We tested whether SurA was involved in folding 
periplasmic and outer membrane proteins by using trypsin sensitivity as an assay 
for protein conformation. We determined that the efficient folding of three 
outer membrane proteins (OmpA, OmpF, and LamB) requires SurA in vivo, while the 
folding of four periplasmic proteins was independent of SurA. We conclude that 
SurA assists in the folding of certain secreted proteins.
