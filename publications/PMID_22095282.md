Protein arginine methylation, catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases 
(PRMTs), is implicated in modulation of cellular processes including gene 
transcription. The role of PRMTs in the regulation of intracellular signaling 
pathways has remained obscure, however. We now show that PRMT1 methylates 
apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) at arginine residues 78 and 80 and 
thereby negatively regulates ASK1 signaling. PRMT1-mediated ASK1 methylation 
attenuated the H(2)O(2)-induced stimulation of ASK1, with this inhibitory effect 
of PRMT1 being abolished by replacement of arginines 78 and 80 of ASK1 with 
lysine. Furthermore, depletion of PRMT1 expression by RNA interference 
potentiated H(2)O(2)-induced stimulation of ASK1. PRMT1-mediated ASK1 
methylation promoted the interaction between ASK1 and its negative regulator 
thioredoxin, whereas it abrogated the association of ASK1 with its positive 
regulator TRAF2. Moreover, PRMT1 depletion potentiated paclitaxel-induced ASK1 
activation and apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. Together, our results 
indicate that arginine methylation of ASK1 by PRMT1 contributes to the 
regulation of stress-induced signaling that controls a variety of cellular 
events including apoptosis.
