Pax proteins are transcriptional regulators that control a variety of 
developmental decisions in vertebrates. During development, the paired-box gene 
8 (PAX8) is expressed in the thyroid, kidney, and several areas of the central 
nervous system. It is also expressed in the adult thyroid gland, in which it 
mediates TSH-induced modulation of the expression of important genes, such as 
those encoding thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase, and the sodium/iodide symporter 
(NIS). Thus far, placental expression of PAX8 has been described only in mice. 
In the present study, we show that PAX8 is also expressed in the human placenta 
at term. In an in vitro model of placental cancer, the JAR choriocarcinoma cell 
line, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) increased levels of PAX8 mRNA and 
protein, and gel retardation assays indicated that the up-regulation of PAX8 
protein expression is associated with an increase in its DNA-binding activity. 
The effects of hCG were mimicked by forskolin, indicating that they are cAMP 
dependent. Levels of mRNA for the Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) and NIS genes were 
increased in JAR cells by hCG treatment, whereas overexpression of PAX8 
increased only levels of WT1 mRNA. In cells transfected with PAX8-specific small 
interfering RNA, the stimulatory effects of hCG on WT1 mRNA levels were 
abolished, but hormonal enhancement of NIS mRNA levels was unchanged. These 
findings indicate that, in JAR cells, hCG activates a cAMP-dependent pathway 
that can up-regulate WT1 expression through PAX8.
