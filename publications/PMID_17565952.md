Localization of maternal nanos mRNA to the posterior pole is essential for 
development of both the abdominal segments and primordial germ cells in the 
Drosophila embryo. Unlike maternal mRNAs such as bicoid and oskar that are 
localized by directed transport along microtubules, nanos is thought to be 
trapped as it swirls past the posterior pole during cytoplasmic streaming. 
Anchoring of nanos depends on integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and the pole 
plasm; other factors involved specifically in its localization have not been 
described to date. Here we use genetic approaches to show that the Hsp90 
chaperone (encoded by Hsp83 in Drosophila) is a localization factor for two 
mRNAs, nanos and pgc. Other components of the pole plasm are localized normally 
when Hsp90 function is partially compromised, suggesting a specific role for the 
chaperone in localization of nanos and pgc mRNAs. Although the mechanism by 
which Hsp90 acts is unclear, we find that levels of the LKB1 kinase are reduced 
in Hsp83 mutant egg chambers and that localization of pgc (but not nos) is 
rescued upon overexpression of LKB1 in such mutants. These observations suggest 
that LKB1 is a primary Hsp90 target for pgc localization and that other Hsp90 
partners mediate localization of nos.
