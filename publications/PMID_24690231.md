M4 is a multifunctional neuron in the Caenorhabditis elegans pharynx that can 
both stimulate peristaltic contractions of the muscles in the pharyngeal isthmus 
and function systemically to regulate an enhanced sensory response under hypoxic 
conditions. Here we identify a third function for M4 that depends on activation 
of the TGF-β family gene dbl-1 by the homeodomain transcription factor CEH-28. 
dbl-1 is expressed in M4 and a subset of other neurons, and we show CEH-28 
specifically activates dbl-1 expression in M4. Characterization of the dbl-1 
promoter indicates that CEH-28 targets an M4-specific enhancer within the dbl-1 
promoter region, while expression in other neurons is mediated by separate 
regulatory sequences. Unlike ceh-28 mutants, dbl-1 mutants do not exhibit M4 
synaptic and signaling defects. Instead, both ceh-28 and dbl-1 mutants exhibit 
morphological defects in the g1 gland cells located adjacent to M4 in the 
pharynx, and these defects can be partially rescued by M4-specific expression of 
dbl-1 in these mutants. Identical gland cell defects are observed in sma-6 and 
daf-4 mutants defective in the receptor for DBL-1, but they are not observed in 
sma-2 and sma-3 mutants lacking the R-Smads functioning downstream of this 
receptor. Together these results identify a novel neuroendocrine function for M4 
and provide evidence for an R-Smad-independent mechanism for DBL-1 signaling in 
C. elegans.
