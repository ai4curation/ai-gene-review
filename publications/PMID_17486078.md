The alternative reading frame (ARF) mRNA encodes two pro-death proteins, the 
nucleolar p19ARF and a shorter mitochondrial isoform, named smARF (hsmARF in 
human). While p19ARF can inhibit cell growth by causing cell cycle arrest or 
type I apoptotic cell death, smARF is able to induce type II autophagic cell 
death. Inappropriate proliferative signals generated by proto-oncogenes, such as 
c-Myc and E2F1, can elevate both p19ARF and smARF proteins. Here, we reveal a 
novel means of regulation of smARF protein steady state levels through its 
interactions with the mitochondrial p32. The p32 protein physically interacts 
with both human and murine smARF, and colocalizes with these short isoforms to 
the mitochondria. Remarkably, knocking down p32 protein levels significantly 
reduced the steady state levels of smARF by increasing its turn over. As a 
consequence, the ability of ectopically expressed smARF to induce autophagy and 
to cause mitochondrial membrane dissipation was significantly reduced. In 
contrast, the protein levels of full-length p19ARF, which mainly resides in the 
nucleolus, were not influenced by p32 depletion, suggesting that p32 exclusively 
stabilizes the mitochondrial smARF protein. Thus the interaction with p32 
provides a means of specifically regulating the expression of the recently 
identified autophagic inducer, smARF, and adds yet another layer of complexity 
to the multifaceted regulation of the ARF gene.
