Interactions between progesterone receptor (PR) and signal transducer and 
activator of transcription 3 (Stat3)-mediated signaling pathways have already 
been described. In the present study, we explored the capacity of Stat3 to 
functionally interact with progesterone receptor (PR) and modulate PR 
transcriptional activation in breast cancer cells. We found that the synthetic 
progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) induced the association of a 
PR/Stat3 complex in which Stat3 acts as a coactivator of PR. We demonstrated 
that Stat3 activation is required for MPA modulation of the endogenous genes 
bcl-X and p21(CIP1) which are involved in MPA-induced cell cycle regulation. 
Stat3 activity as a coactivator of PR was observed in both the classical and 
nonclassical ligand activated-PR transcriptional mechanisms, since the effects 
described were identified in the bcl-X promoter which contains a progesterone 
responsive element and in the p21(CIP1) promoter which carries Sp1 binding sites 
where PR is recruited via the transcription factor Sp1. The data herein 
presented identifies a potential therapeutic intervention for PR-positive breast 
tumors consisting of targeting Stat3 function or PR/Stat3 interaction which will 
result in the inhibition of PR function.
