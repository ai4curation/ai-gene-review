Notch proteins are transmembrane receptors that mediate intercell communication 
and direct individual cell fate decisions. The activated intracellular form of 
Notch, NotchIC, translocates to the nucleus, where it targets the DNA binding 
protein CBF1. CBF1 mediates transcriptional repression through the recruitment 
of an SMRT-histone deacetylase-containing corepressor complex. We have examined 
the mechanism whereby NotchIC overcomes CBF1-mediated transcriptional 
repression. We identified SKIP (Ski-interacting protein) as a CBF1 binding 
protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Both CBF1 and SKIP are highly conserved 
evolutionarily, and the SKIP-CBF1 interaction is also conserved in assays using 
the Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster SKIP homologs. 
Protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated interaction between SKIP and the 
corepressor SMRT. More surprisingly, SKIP also interacted with NotchIC. The SMRT 
and NotchIC interactions were mutually exclusive. In competition binding 
experiments SMRT displaced NotchIC from CBF1 and from SKIP. Contact with SKIP is 
required for biological activity of NotchIC. A mutation in the fourth ankyrin 
repeat that abolished Notch signal transduction did not affect interaction with 
CBF1 but abolished interaction with SKIP. Further, NotchIC was unable to block 
muscle cell differentiation in myoblasts expressing antisense SKIP. The results 
suggest a model in which NotchIC activates responsive promoters by competing 
with the SMRT-corepressor complex for contacts on both CBF1 and SKIP.
