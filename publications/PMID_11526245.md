At least three transport systems function in targeting nuclear-encoded 
chloroplast proteins to the chloroplast thylakoid membrane. One of these systems 
requires a thylakoid pH gradient and is named the DeltapH-dependent protein 
transport system. A similar DeltapH export system of Escherichia coli contains 
four components, twin arginine translocation A (TatA), TatB, TatC, and TatE. 
TatC is a major component of the DeltapH-dependent protein transporter in E. 
coli and functions in the translocation of tightly folded proteins across 
membranes. We have isolated four transposon-inserted albino mutants named albino 
and pale green 2 (apg2) from Arabidopsis thaliana and showed that the 
transposons were inserted into different sites of a single gene. The APG2 gene 
product (named cpTatC) has sequence similarity with bacterial TatC and contains 
six putative transmembrane domains, including bacterial TatC proteins and a 
transit peptide in its N terminus. apg2 mutants showed albino phenotypes and 
could not grow in soil. The apg2 plastids were highly vacuolated, lacked 
internal membrane structures and lamellae of the thylakoid membrane, and 
contained many densely stained globule structures, like undifferentiated 
proplastids. Immunoblot analysis detected no thylakoid membrane proteins such as 
D1, light-harvesting complex, and OE23 in apg2 plastids, whereas soluble 
proteins such as rubisco large and small subunits were not decreased. These 
results indicate an essential role of cpTatC in chloroplast development, 
especially in thylakoid membrane formation.
