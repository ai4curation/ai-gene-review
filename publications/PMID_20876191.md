For several decades, the Fersht laboratory has been a world leader in research 
on protein structure and mechanism. There are pressing medical and financial 
needs for new medicines. Here, I use examples to illustrate how drug discovery 
could be more successful if it increased utilisation of approaches from the 
Fersht laboratory.
