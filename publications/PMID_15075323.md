The cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and matrilins are abundant 
non-collagenous proteins in the cartilage extracellular matrix. In the presence 
of calcium, COMP and matrilin-1 elute together in the gel filtration of 
cartilage extracts and can be co-immunoprecipitated. In a screen for ligands of 
matrilin-1, -3, and -4 using an ELISA-style binding assay, COMP was identified 
as a prominent binding partner for all three, indicating a conservation of the 
COMP interaction among matrilins. The interaction of COMP and matrilin-4 is 
saturable, and an apparent K(D) of 1 nm was determined. However, only the 
full-length COMP and the full-length matrilin-4 proteins showed a strong 
interaction, indicating that the oligomeric structures markedly increase the 
affinity. Mutations in COMP or matrilin-3 cause related forms of human 
chondrodysplasia, and the COMP mutation D469Delta, which is found in patients 
with pseudoachondroplasia, has been shown to cause a reduced calcium binding. 
Despite this, the mutation causes only a slight decrease in matrilin-4 binding. 
This indicates that impaired binding of COMP to matrilins does not cause the 
pseudoachondroplasia phenotype but rather that matrilins may be coretained in 
the rough endoplasmatic reticulum where COMP accumulates in the chondrocytes of 
patients.
