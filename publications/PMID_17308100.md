Cancer cells often fail to respond to stimuli that normally activate their 
intrinsic apoptotic machinery. Moreover, they are able to adapt to hypoxia by 
changing their glycolytic rate. Pyruvate kinase (PK) is a rate-limiting enzyme 
in glycolysis that is converted to a less active dimer form of PKM2 isoenzyme 
during oncogenesis. Here, we show that both somatostatin and the structural 
analogue TT-232 interact with the PKM subtype. We further show that the PKM2 is 
translocated to the nucleus in response to TT-232 and different apoptotic 
agents. Nuclear translocation of PKM2 is sufficient to induce cell death that is 
caspase independent, isoform specific, and independent of its enzymatic 
activity. These results show that the tumor marker PKM2 plays a general role in 
caspase-independent cell death of tumor cells and thereby defines this 
glycolytic enzyme as a novel target for cancer therapy development.
