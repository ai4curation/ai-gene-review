Maintenance of FOXP3 protein expression is crucial for differentiation and 
maturation of regulatory T (Treg) cells, which play important roles in immune 
homeostasis and immune tolerance. We demonstrate here that PDCD5 interacts with 
FOXP3, increases acetylation of FOXP3 in synergy with Tip60 and enhances the 
repressive function of FOXP3. In PDCD5 transgenic (PDCD5tg) mice, overexpression 
of PDCD5 enhanced the level of FOXP3 protein and percentage of 
CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) cells. Naïve CD4(+) T cells from PDCD5tg mice were more 
sensitive to TGF-β-induced Treg polarization and expansion. These induced Tregs 
retained normal suppressive function in vitro. Severity of 
experimentally-induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in PDCD5tg mice was 
significantly reduced relative to that of wild-type mice. The beneficial effect 
of PDCD5 likely resulted from increases of Treg cell frequency, accompanied by a 
reduction of the predominant pathogenic Th17/Th1 response. Activation-induced 
cell death enhanced by PDCD5 was also linked to this process. This is the first 
report revealing that PDCD5 activity in T cells suppresses autoimmunity by 
modulating Tregs. This study suggests that PDCD5 serves as a guardian of 
immunological functions and that the PDCD5-FOXP3-Treg axis may be a therapeutic 
target for autoimmunity.
