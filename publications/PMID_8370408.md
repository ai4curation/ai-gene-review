The antibodies Ki-M8, Ber-Mac3, GHI/61 and SM4 define a human 
macrophage-associated antigen with a relative molecular mass of 130,000 which we 
designate M130. The protein was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and an 
N-terminal and three internal amino acid sequences were obtained. A cDNA 
fragment was initially obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 
reverse-translated primers. Several variant cDNA clones, derived from 
alternative spliced messages, were obtained from a lipopolysaccharide-stimulated 
human monocyte library and were sequenced. The relative abundance of these 
variants was evaluated by a series of overlapping PCR reactions. The size of the 
most representative cDNA is 3.7 kb and closely agrees with the mRNA size of 3.8 
kb determined by Northern blot analysis. The membrane protein encoded contains a 
leader peptide of 40 residues, a putative extracellular domain of 1003 residues, 
followed by a hydrophobic segment of 24 residues and a cytoplasmic domain of 49 
residues. The extracellular domain was found to contain nine repeating elements, 
of about 110 residues, which are similar to those of the scavenger receptor 
superfamily.
