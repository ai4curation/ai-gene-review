Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is triggered by hormone defense cues and is 
associated with the onset of expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes that 
encode for anti-microbial proteins in plants. In the case of PR-1, 
transcriptional activation involves promoter-specific recruitment of 
transcription factors such as TGA2 through a mechanism that may involve 
transient physical interaction with the NPR1 protein. This stimulus-inducible 
recruitment process has yet to be fully explained at the functional and 
mechanistic level. To investigate this question further, we initially looked to 
see whether NPR1 preferentially forms a complex with the DNA bound or unbound 
fraction of TGA2. As shown here, NPR1 appears to preferentially interact with 
the non-DNA bound fraction of TGA2. We subsequently mutated this transcription 
factor to identify key residues in its conserved carboxyl terminal (CT) domain 
that mediate complex formation with NPR1. These approaches revealed that two 
non-overlapping regions of the CT domain of TGA2 bind independently to NPR1. The 
specificity and biological significance of these findings were inferred with a 
mutant form of NPR1 that fails to activate SAR in vivo. These and other findings 
raise the possibility that NPR1 may transiently interact with the DNA unbound 
fraction of TGA2 to promote its recruitment to an active form on cognate target 
promoters.
