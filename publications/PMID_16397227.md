Despite being a member of the mismatch repair family of proteins, the biological 
functions of hMSH5 in human cells are presently elusive. Here, we report a novel 
physical and functional interaction between hMSH5 and c-Abl; the latter is a 
critical non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in many critical cellular 
functions including DNA damage response, in which the kinase activity is 
normally suppressed in the absence of biological challenges. Our data indicate 
that hMSH5 associates with c-Abl in vivo, which is mediated by a direct physical 
interaction between the NH2 terminus (residues 1-109) of hMSH5 and the c-Abl SH3 
domain. This physical interaction facilitates the activation of c-Abl tyrosine 
kinase and the phosphorylation of hMSH5 in response to ionizing radiation. Our 
data also indicate that the hMSH5 P29S variant overactivates the c-Abl tyrosine 
kinase activity. Furthermore, it seems that the tyrosine phosphorylation of 
hMSH5 promotes the dissociation of hMSH4-hMSH5 heterocomplex. Together, the 
revealed physical and functional interaction of hMSH5 with c-Abl implies that 
the interplay between hMSH5 and c-Abl could manipulate cellular responses to 
ionizing radiation-induced DNA damages.
