The mitochondrial chaperonin system consists of chaperonin 60 (also termed 
hsp60), which is homologous to E. coli groEL, and chaperonin 10, which is 
homologous to E. coli groES. In yeast, chaperonin 60 function has been shown to 
be essential for viability. We report here that the same is true for chaperonin 
10. We have cloned, sequenced and disrupted the nuclear chaperonin 10 gene CPN10 
from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This gene encodes a protein of 11,372 Da that is 
imported into the mitochondrial matrix without detectable cleavage. Haploid 
cells lacking a functional copy of CPN10 fail to grow at temperatures between 23 
and 37 degrees C.
