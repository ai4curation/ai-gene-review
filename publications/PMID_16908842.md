Myosin VI (myo6) is the only actin-based molecular motor that translocates along 
actin filaments toward the minus end. Myo6 participates in two steps of 
endocytic trafficking; it is recruited to both clathrin-coated pits and to 
ensuing uncoated endocytic vesicles (UCV). Although there is evidence suggesting 
that the PDZ adaptor protein GIPC/synectin is involved in the association of 
myo6 with UCV, the recruitment mechanism is unknown. We show that GIPC/synectin 
is required for both internalization of cell surface receptors and for coupling 
of myo6 to UCV. This coupling occurs via a mechanism wherein engagement of the 
GIPC/synectin PDZ domain by C termini of internalized receptors facilitates in 
trans myo6 binding to the GIPC/synectin C terminus located outside of the PDZ 
domain. Analysis of megalin, a prototypical GIPC/synectin-binding receptor, 
revealed that deletion of its PDZ-binding motif drastically reduced 
GIPC/synectin and myo6 recruitment to UCV. Furthermore, interaction with 
GIPC/synectin was required for megalin's function, as megalin was mistargeted in 
the renal proximal tubules of GIPC/synectin-null mice and these mice exhibited 
proteinuria, a condition consistent with defective megalin trafficking.
