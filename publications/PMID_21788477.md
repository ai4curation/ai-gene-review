Delivery of iron to cells requires binding of two iron-containing human 
transferrin (hTF) molecules to the specific homodimeric transferrin receptor 
(TFR) on the cell surface. Through receptor-mediated endocytosis involving lower 
pH, salt, and an unidentified chelator, iron is rapidly released from hTF within 
the endosome. The crystal structure of a monoferric N-lobe hTF/TFR complex 
(3.22-Å resolution) features two binding motifs in the N lobe and one in the C 
lobe of hTF. Binding of Fe(N)hTF induces global and site-specific conformational 
changes within the TFR ectodomain. Specifically, movements at the TFR dimer 
interface appear to prime the TFR to undergo pH-induced movements that alter the 
hTF/TFR interaction. Iron release from each lobe then occurs by distinctly 
different mechanisms: Binding of His349 to the TFR (strengthened by protonation 
at low pH) controls iron release from the C lobe, whereas displacement of one 
N-lobe binding motif, in concert with the action of the dilysine trigger, 
elicits iron release from the N lobe. One binding motif in each lobe remains 
attached to the same α-helix in the TFR throughout the endocytic cycle. 
Collectively, the structure elucidates how the TFR accelerates iron release from 
the C lobe, slows it from the N lobe, and stabilizes binding of apohTF for 
return to the cell surface. Importantly, this structure provides new targets for 
mutagenesis studies to further understand and define this system.

Abstract

Delivery of iron to cells requires binding of two iron-containing human transferrin (hTF) molecules to the specific homodimeric transferrin receptor (TFR) on the cell surface. Through receptor-mediated endocytosis involving lower pH, salt, and an unidentified chelator, iron is rapidly released from hTF within the endosome. The crystal structure of a monoferric N-lobe hTF/TFR complex (3.22-Å resolution) features two binding motifs in the N lobe and one in the C lobe of hTF. Binding of Fe N hTF induces global and site-specific conformational changes within the TFR ectodomain. Specifically, movements at the TFR dimer interface appear to prime the TFR to undergo pH-induced movements that alter the hTF/TFR interaction. Iron release from each lobe then occurs by distinctly different mechanisms: Binding of His349 to the TFR (strengthened by protonation at low pH) controls iron release from the C lobe, whereas displacement of one N-lobe binding motif, in concert with the action of the dilysine trigger, elicits iron release from the N lobe. One binding motif in each lobe remains attached to the same α-helix in the TFR throughout the endocytic cycle. Collectively, the structure elucidates how the TFR accelerates iron release from the C lobe, slows it from the N lobe, and stabilizes binding of apohTF for return to the cell surface. Importantly, this structure provides new targets for mutagenesis studies to further understand and define this system.

Conformational Changes in the TFR as a Result of hTF Binding.

The binding of hTF results in the translation of the apical and protease-like domains of the TFR and the reorientation of the monomers within the homodimer. These changes are revealed by superimposing a TFR monomer from the HFE/TFR (PDB ID code 1DE4) and TFR alone (PDB ID code 1CX8) structures on our Fe N hTF/TFR structure. The calculated changes in the mean rms show the effect of reorientation at the dimer interface in a ligand-dependent manner ( Fig. 5 , Inset ). Site-specific changes per residue within a TFR subunit are highlighted by a positional comparison ( Fig. 5 ). The TFR in the Fe N hTF complex is very similar to the TFR in the HFE complex (black line), but varies considerably in comparison to the unliganded TFR (red line).

The most dramatic change in the TFR structure as a result of hTF binding is observed in the loop containing one of three glycosylation sites, Asn317 ( Fig. 5 , designated as TFR-TFR′ + C1 motif). Specifically, the helical domain and C terminus from one TFR monomer interacts with the loop containing the glycosylated Asn317 from the other TFR monomer, as well as with His318 ( Table S2 ). Phe316 is shifted by 8 Å and His318 flips, bringing it to within 5 Å of the C terminus of the other TFR monomer (in comparison to a distance of 17.5 Å in unliganded TFR) ( Fig. 4 ). Although the interaction between nearby Gln320 and Ser638 is unchanged, a number of rearrangements occur at the TFR dimer interface. Specifically, binding of hTF causes two Trp residues from the helical domain of one TFR monomer (Trp641 and 740) to undergo significant changes in packing with the other TFR monomer. Thus, Trp641 shifts from interacting with the side chain of Phe316 to interact with the backbones of Asn317 and His318. Trp740 changes from backbone packing and a carbonyl hydrogen bond with Pro314 to hydrogen bonding with the backbone of Gly469 and π-stacking with Phe316, and His318 and Tyr470.

As in the HFE/TFR structure, binding of hTF causes a rotation along the TFR dimer interface bringing four histidines (His475 in the protease-like domain and His684 in the helical domain from each TFR monomer) into proximity ( Fig. S3 ). The formation of this histidine cluster is another significant change in the TFR structure as a result of hTF binding ( Fig. 5 , designated TFR-TFR′ interface). Other changes are observed in the regions of the TFR involved in binding the various hTF motifs. Additionally, we suggest that conformational changes near residue Trp528 in the TFR are attributable to its proximity to the bridge between the N and C lobes of hTF.

Discussion

The crystal structure of the Fe N hTF/TFR complex in combination with previous structures suggests a mechanistic basis for the kinetic differences in iron release from each lobe of hTF in the presence of the TFR. The structure of the complex clearly shows that the TFR is altered by hTF binding. The relative positions of the N1 and C1 subdomains of hTF appear to remain constant throughout the cycle, indicating that the N2 and C2 subdomains must move to accommodate the approximately 50° cleft opening and the release of iron from each lobe. Moreover, some insight into how apohTF is stabilized by and remains bound to the TFR throughout the endocytic cycle is provided.
