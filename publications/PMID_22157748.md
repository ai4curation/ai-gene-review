Unlike apoptosis, necrotic cell death is characterized by marked loss of plasma 
membrane integrity. Leakage of cytoplasmic material to the extracellular space 
contributes to cell demise, and is the cause of acute inflammatory responses, 
which typically accompany necrosis. The mechanisms underlying plasma membrane 
damage during necrotic cell death are not well understood. We report that 
endocytosis is critically required for the execution of necrosis. Depletion of 
the key endocytic machinery components dynamin, synaptotagmin and endophilin 
suppresses necrotic neurodegeneration induced by diverse genetic and 
environmental insults in C. elegans. We used genetically encoded fluorescent 
markers to monitor the formation and fate of specific types of endosomes during 
cell death in vivo. Strikingly, we find that the number of early and recycling 
endosomes increases sharply and transiently upon initiation of necrosis. 
Endosomes subsequently coalesce around the nucleus and disintegrate during the 
final stage of necrosis. Interfering with kinesin-mediated endosome trafficking 
impedes cell death. Endocytosis synergizes with autophagy and lysosomal 
proteolytic mechanisms to facilitate necrotic neurodegeneration. These findings 
demonstrate a prominent role for endocytosis in cellular destruction during 
neurodegeneration, which is likely conserved in metazoans.
