The Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal disorder with 
pleiotropic phenotypes including pancreatic, skeletal and bone marrow 
deficiencies and predisposition to hematological dysfunctions. SDS has been 
associated to mutations in the SBDS gene, encoding a highly conserved protein 
that was shown to function in ribosome biogenesis in yeast. In this work, we 
show that SBDS is found in complexes containing the human Nip7 ortholog. 
Analysis of pre-rRNA processing in a stable SBDS knock-down HEK293-derivative 
cell line revealed accumulation of a small RNA which is a further indication of 
SBDS involvement in rRNA biosynthesis. Global transcription and polysome-bound 
mRNA profiling revealed that SBDS knock-down affects expression of critical 
genes involved in brain development and function, bone morphogenesis, blood cell 
proliferation and differentiation, and cell adhesion. Expression of a group of 
growth and signal transduction factors and of DNA damage response genes is also 
affected. In SBDS knock-down cells, 34 mRNAs showed decreased and 55 mRNAs 
showed increased association to polysomes, among which is a group encoding 
proteins involved in alternative splicing and RNA modification. These results 
indicate that SBDS is required for accurate expression of genes important for 
proper brain, skeletal, and blood cell development.
