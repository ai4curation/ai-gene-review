The Arabidopsis NPR1 protein is essential for regulating salicylic 
acid-dependent gene expression during systemic acquired resistance. NPR1 
interacts differentially with members of the TGA class of basic domain/Leu 
zipper transcription factors and regulates their DNA binding activity. Here, we 
report that although TGA1 does not interact with NPR1 in yeast two-hybrid 
assays, treatment with salicylic acid induces the interaction between these 
proteins in Arabidopsis leaves. This phenomenon is correlated with a reduction 
of TGA1 Cys residues. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of TGA1 Cys-260 and 
Cys-266 enables the interaction with NPR1 in yeast and Arabidopsis. Together, 
these results indicate that TGA1 relies on the oxidation state of Cys residues 
to mediate the interaction with NPR1. An intramolecular disulfide bridge in TGA1 
precludes interaction with NPR1, and NPR1 can only stimulate the DNA binding 
activity of the reduced form of TGA1. Unlike its animal and yeast counterparts, 
the DNA binding activity of TGA1 is not redox regulated; however, this property 
is conferred by interaction with the NPR1 cofactor.

Abstract

The Arabidopsis NPR1 protein is essential for regulating salicylic acid–dependent gene expression during systemic acquired resistance. NPR1 interacts differentially with members of the TGA class of basic domain/Leu zipper transcription factors and regulates their DNA binding activity. Here, we report that although TGA1 does not interact with NPR1 in yeast two-hybrid assays, treatment with salicylic acid induces the interaction between these proteins in Arabidopsis leaves. This phenomenon is correlated with a reduction of TGA1 Cys residues. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of TGA1 Cys-260 and Cys-266 enables the interaction with NPR1 in yeast and Arabidopsis. Together, these results indicate that TGA1 relies on the oxidation state of Cys residues to mediate the interaction with NPR1. An intramolecular disulfide bridge in TGA1 precludes interaction with NPR1, and NPR1 can only stimulate the DNA binding activity of the reduced form of TGA1. Unlike its animal and yeast counterparts, the DNA binding activity of TGA1 is not redox regulated; however, this property is conferred by interaction with the NPR1 cofactor.

INTRODUCTION

Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a systemic and broad-range disease resistance in plants triggered by a localized exposure to avirulent pathogens that cause a hypersensitive response ( Ryals et al., 1996 ). SAR is characterized by the induction of a battery of pathogenesis-related ( PR ) genes and the accumulation of PR proteins ( Ward et al., 1991 ). Genetic and biochemical studies have identified salicylic acid (SA) as a metabolite mandatory for SAR. Exogenous application of SA to plants leads to the establishment of SAR and the induction of PR genes ( Ward et al., 1991 ), whereas Arabidopsis SA induction–deficient mutants ( sid ; Nawrath and Métraux, 1999 ) or transgenic plants expressing the bacterial nahG gene encoding a bacterial salicylate hydroxylase that degrades SA to catechol are compromised in their ability to mount SAR and express PR genes ( Delaney et al., 1994 ). Downstream of SA in the SAR signal transduction pathway is NPR1 (NONEXPRESSOR OF PR GENES), also known as NIM1 and SAI1 ( Cao et al., 1994 ; Delaney et al., 1995 ; Glazebrook et al., 1996 ; Shah et al., 1997 ). Arabidopsis npr1 mutants are nonresponsive to SA, are compromised in their ability to express PR genes, and do not mount an effective SAR ( Cao et al., 1994 ; Delaney et al., 1995 ). By contrast, overexpression of NPR1 in rice and Arabidopsis leads to enhanced resistance against various pathogens ( Cao et al., 1998 ; Chern et al., 2001 ; Friedrich et al., 2001 ).

Cloning of NPR1 ( Cao et al., 1997 ; Ryals et al., 1997 ) revealed that the protein contains two identifiable protein–protein interaction motifs: a BTB/POZ (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-a-brac/Pox virus and Zinc finger) ( Aravind and Koonin, 1999 ) and ankyrin repeats ( Sedgwick and Smerdon, 1999 ). NPR1 localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus ( Després et al., 2000 ). Cytoplasmic NPR1 appears to modulate crosstalk between SA- and jasmonate-dependent defense signaling through a mechanism that is not understood at present ( Spoel et al., 2003 ). Nuclear localization, which is controlled by a bipartite nuclear localization sequence located at the C-terminal end, is required for the induction of PR genes ( Kinkema et al., 2000 ).

Yeast two-hybrid screens have revealed that NPR1 interacts differentially with members of the TGA family of basic domain/Leu zipper (bZIP) transcription factors ( Zhang et al., 1999 ; Després et al., 2000 ; Niggeweg et al., 2000b ; Zhou et al., 2000 ; Chern et al., 2001 ), so called because their cognate DNA binding elements contain the core sequence TGACG. Upon SAR induction, NPR1 translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with TGA factors ( Kinkema et al., 2000 ; Subramaniam et al., 2001 ; Fan and Dong, 2002 ). NPR1 stimulates the DNA binding activity of interacting TGA factors to SA response elements, and the binding of TGA factors to cognate elements in response to SA requires functional NPR1 ( Lebel et al., 1998 ; Després et al., 2000 ; Niggeweg et al., 2000a ; Fan and Dong, 2002 ).

A role for TGA factors in mediating SAR and PR gene expression was confirmed recently using transgenic plants containing trans -dominant negative versions of TGA2 ( Pontier et al., 2001 ; Fan and Dong, 2002 ) or one of its tobacco homologs, TGA2 . 2 ( Niggeweg et al., 2000a ). However, contradictory results were obtained in these studies. Fan and Dong (2002) reported a suppression of SAR and PR-1 expression, whereas Pontier et al. (2001) reported an enhancement of SAR and PR gene expression. Niggeweg et al. (2000a) did not test for SAR, but they reported a suppression of PR-1 expression. Using a different approach, Kim and Delaney (2002) reported that sense and antisense overexpression of TGA2 did not affect resistance to a virulent strain of the oomycete Peronospora parasitica . However, transgenic plants overexpressing TGA5 displayed increased resistance to this parasite. This phenotype was not dependent on SA or NPR1 and was correlated with a reduction in PR gene expression, suggesting that it is distinct from SAR ( Kim and Delaney, 2002 ).

Given that the interaction of NPR1 with TGA factors is not constitutive, but instead is regulated during the establishment of SAR ( Subramaniam et al., 2001 ; Fan and Dong, 2002 ), our goal was to investigate the mechanism by which the NPR1–TGA interaction is regulated. Here, we report that TGA1, a member of the Arabidopsis TGA family that does not interact with NPR1 in the yeast two-hybrid system ( Després et al., 2000 ; Niggeweg et al., 2000b ; Zhou et al., 2000 ), interacts with NPR1 in plant cells after SA treatment. Therefore, TGA1 possesses all of the structural determinants for interaction with NPR1. A domain was identified within TGA1 that contains critical inhibitory Cys residues, because their mutation brings about an interaction with NPR1 in yeast cells. We also show that SA modulates the redox status of TGA1 Cys residues in Arabidopsis leaves, with the reduced state being required for a strong TGA1–NPR1 interaction. By contrast, the oxidized form of TGA1 does not interact with NPR1 and contains an intramolecular disulfide bridge. Consequently, NPR1 only stimulates the DNA binding activity of the reduced form of TGA1. The redox regulation of TGA1 presented here reveals one level of control for the interaction between NPR1 and the TGA transcription factors during the establishment of SAR.

DISCUSSION

Previous studies have indicated that NPR1 does not interact with Arabidopsis TGA1 and TGA4 in yeast, whereas it does with TGA2, TGA3, TGA5, TGA6, and TGA7 ( Zhang et al., 1999 ; Després et al., 2000 ; Zhou et al., 2000 ). Here, we show that TGA1 possesses all of the required structural elements to interact with NPR1. Indeed, our data demonstrate that this interaction occurs in Arabidopsis leaf cells in an SA-dependent manner. The generation of chimeric proteins of TGA1 and TGA2 using a domain-swapping approach followed by rational site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the interaction with NPR1 is regulated by the oxidation status of critical Cys residues within TGA1. In their oxidized state, Cys residues in TGA1 form an intramolecular disulfide bridge that inhibits interaction with NPR1. The reduced state is permissive for interaction with NPR1; consequently, NPR1 only stimulates the DNA binding activity of the reduced form of TGA1. In vivo, an accumulation of SA reduces the Cys residues in TGA1 and, accordingly, stimulates the NPR1–TGA1 interaction.

SAR is associated with the accumulation of SA and the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates in a phenomenon described as the oxidative burst ( Lamb and Dixon, 1997 ). It has been proposed that the role of SA is to inhibit catalase and ascorbate peroxidase and to potentiate the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( Chen et al., 1993 ; Durner and Klessig, 1995 ). These compounds, particularly hydrogen peroxide, act as second messengers to activate disease resistance and SAR ( Alvarez et al., 1998 ). However, a later study argued against SA being an inhibitor of ascorbate peroxidase; indeed, it was shown that SA is a substrate of this enzyme ( Kvaratskhelia et al., 1997 ). In addition, the irreversible catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was found to be a weak inducer of the tobacco PR-1 gene, although this induction still was dependent on the production of SA ( Bi et al., 1995 ; Neuenschwander et al., 1995 ). Therefore, the mechanism by which SA acts as a mediator of redox changes during disease resistance remains obscure.

Our results clearly indicate that SA is a modulator of the redox status of Cys residues and that its effect is exerted, at least in part, through TGA factors. Redox-sensitive transcription factors whose activities are modulated by the post-translational modification of reactive Cys residues have been identified in other organisms. Examples include prokaryotic and eukaryotic hydrogen peroxide sensors such as OxyR and Yap1 that are activated through oxidation and the formation of disulfide bridges between critical Cys residues ( Zheng et al., 1998 ; Delaunay et al., 2000 ). OxyR senses hydrogen peroxide directly, whereas Yap1 does so indirectly, through a glutathione peroxidase–like enzyme ( Delaunay et al., 2002 ). Because SA is a generator of prooxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, the observed SA-mediated reduction of TGA1 Cys residues cannot proceed through a direct sensing of hydrogen peroxide. One possibility is that under oxidizing conditions, TGA1 Cys residues may be reduced by a mechanism exemplified by the mammalian Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) complex, as detailed below.

AP-1, which includes such proteins as c-Jun and c-Fos, is part of the same family of bZIP transcription factors that includes yeast Yap1 ( Moye-Rowley et al., 1989 ). Like Yap1 and OxyR, the DNA binding activity of AP-1 is regulated through a redox mechanism, and in certain cell types, AP-1 also is activated by prooxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. Paradoxically, the reduction of a conserved Cys residue located in the DNA binding domain is required for DNA binding activity, whereas the oxidation of the Cys has an inhibitory effect ( Abate et al., 1990 ). The reduction of this critical Cys in oxidizing conditions is performed by the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease Ref-1, which is translocated to the nucleus upon generation of sublethal doses of reactive oxygen intermediates ( Ramana et al., 1998 ). This reduction also requires thioredoxin, which interacts physically with Ref-1 ( Hirota et al., 1997 ). Ref-1 homologs and thioredoxins are present in the Arabidopsis genome (data not shown), suggesting that the reduction of TGA1 in prooxidizing conditions could occur through a similar mechanism.

Redox regulation of eukaryotic transcription factors generally affects Cys residues in their DNA binding domain, and the reduced form is required for full binding activity ( Dalton et al., 1999 ). Cys residues in TGA1 are located outside of the DNA binding domain, and binding to DNA is independent of their redox status, because the addition of excess DTT or diamide does not affect band intensity in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Therefore, although TGA1 is redox regulated by SA, at first glance one might be tempted to conclude that its DNA binding activity is not redox regulated. However, the results presented here demonstrate that the DNA binding activity of TGA1 is redox regulated but that this level of control is indirect and requires the redox-regulated recruitment of NPR1, which acts as a cofactor to stimulate TGA1 DNA binding activity.

NPR1 has been proposed to be a homolog of the mammalian protein IκB ( Ryals et al., 1997 ), which regulates the subcellular localization and DNA binding activity of transcription factor NF-κB, whereas TGA1 is a bZIP transcription factor related to AP-1. Interestingly, searches of Arabidopsis genomic databases failed to reveal NF-κB–related sequences ( Arabidopsis Genome Initiative, 2000 ). Consequently, it is tempting to speculate that plants have evolved an IκB-like (NPR1) function independent of NF-κB but that acts on AP-1–like (TGA1) factors.

As detailed in Figure 7 , our data provide a mechanistic understanding of how the NPR1–TGA1 and/or the NPR1–TGA4 interaction might be regulated in vivo and of its effect on the stimulation of DNA binding activity by these transcription factors in situations of increased SA concentration, such as during SAR. Although we have not tested the remaining Arabidopsis TGA factors, we anticipate that they are not regulated in the same manner because they interact with NPR1 in yeast and lack Cys residues at positions corresponding to Cys-260 and Cys-266 of TGA1 ( Figure 3A ). Therefore, our model is intended to add to, rather than replace, other recently proposed models for the regulation of NPR1–TGA interactions (see Introduction).

Previous functional studies of TGA factors have focused on members of the family that interact with NPR1 ( Niggeweg et al., 2000a ; Pontier et al., 2001 ; Fan and Dong, 2002 ; Kim and Delaney, 2002 ). The conditional, SA-regulated interaction between TGA1 with NPR1 reported here clearly implicates this transcription factor as well as TGA4 in SAR signaling and hopefully will stimulate similar research on these transcription factors.
