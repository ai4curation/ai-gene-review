Nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs) work as ligand-dependent heterodimeric 
RAR/retinoid X receptor transcription activators, which are targets for 
phosphorylations. The N-terminal activation function (AF)-1 domain of RARalpha 
is phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 7/cyclin H complex of the 
general transcription factor TFIIH and the C-terminal AF-2 domain by the 
cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Here, we report the identification of a 
molecular pathway by which phosphorylation by PKA propagates cAMP signaling from 
the AF-2 domain to the AF-1 domain. The first step is the phosphorylation of 
S369, located in loop 9-10 of the AF-2 domain. This signal is transferred to the 
cyclin H binding domain (at the N terminus of helix 9 and loop 8-9), resulting 
in enhanced cyclin H interaction and, thereby, greater amounts of RARalpha 
phosphorylated at S77 located in the AF-1 domain by the cdk7/cyclin H complex. 
This molecular mechanism relies on the integrity of the ligand-binding domain 
and the cyclin H binding surface. Finally, it results in higher DNA-binding 
efficiency, providing an explanation for how cAMP synergizes with retinoic acid 
for transcription.
