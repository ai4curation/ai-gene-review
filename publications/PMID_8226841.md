## Abstract

1. J Biol Chem. 1993 Nov 5;268(31):23208-14.

The multiphosphorylation domain of the phosphorylase kinase alpha M and alpha L 
subunits is a hotspot of differential mRNA processing and of molecular 
evolution.

We have cloned and sequenced human cDNAs encoding the complete phosphorylase 
kinase alpha subunit muscle isoform (alpha M). The predicted polypeptide is 
highly similar to the sequence known from rabbit muscle but lacks a major part 
of its multiphosphorylation domain, including the main phosphorylation site for 
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Analysis of this region by 
reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in several human and 
rabbit tissues demonstrates that it is subject to elaborate differential mRNA 
splicing. Amino acids 1012-1024 of the full-length rabbit sequence, including 
the major PKA phosphorylation site, and amino acids 1025-1041, which harbor at 
least one endogenous phosphorylation site, can be deleted from the predicted 
polypeptide individually or in combination. Molecules lacking one or both of 
these segments constitute a major part of the alpha M subunit population in many 
rabbit tissues and constitute the vast majority in all human tissues analyzed. 
Similar, tissue-dependent differential splicing events could be detected by 
RT-PCR in the human alpha subunit isoform from liver (alpha L). The expression 
of the differentially spliced alpha M subtypes differs markedly between 
corresponding human and rabbit tissues. Sequence divergence in this region is 
particularly high, not only between the muscle and liver isoforms, but also 
between alpha M sequences from four different animal species. Moreover, a 
duplication of the exon encoding the main PKA phosphorylation site was 
discovered in the mouse. Thus, the multiphosphorylation domain of the 
phosphorylase kinase alpha subunit isoforms is subject to pronounced structural 
variation not only between different tissues of one organism via differential 
splicing, but also in the course of evolution.
