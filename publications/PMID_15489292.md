Sequential events in macromolecular biosynthesis are often elegantly 
coordinated. The small ribosomal subunit (SSU) processome is a large 
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) required for processing of precursors to the small 
subunit RNA, the 18S, of the ribosome. We have found that a subcomplex of SSU 
processome proteins, the t-Utps, is also required for optimal rRNA transcription 
in vivo in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The t-Utps are ribosomal 
chromatin (r-chromatin)-associated, and they exist in a complex in the absence 
of the U3 snoRNA. Transcription is required neither for the formation of the 
subcomplex nor for its r-chromatin association. The t-Utps are associated with 
the pre-18S rRNAs independent of the presence of the U3 snoRNA. This association 
may thus represent an early step in the formation of the SSU processome. Our 
results indicate that rRNA transcription and pre-rRNA processing are coordinated 
via specific components of the SSU processome.
