The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis locus, NF1, encodes a protein with 
homology restricted to the catalytic region of the RAS GTPase-activating 
protein, GAP, and with extensive homology to the IRA1 and IRA2 gene products of 
the yeast S. cerevisiae. A segment of the NF1 cDNA gene, expressed in yeast, can 
complement loss of IRA function and can inhibit both wild-type and mutant 
activated human H-ras genes that are coexpressed in yeast. Yeast expressing the 
NF1 segment have increased H-ras GTPase-stimulating activity. These studies 
indicate that the NF1 gene product can interact with RAS proteins and 
demonstrate structural and functional similarities and differences among the 
GAP, IRA1, IRA2, and NF1 proteins.
