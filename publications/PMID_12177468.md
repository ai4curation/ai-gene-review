Ethylene signaling in Arabidopsis begins at a family of five ethylene receptors 
that regulate activity of a downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 
kinase, CTR1. Triple and quadruple loss-of-function ethylene receptor mutants 
display a constitutive ethylene response phenotype, indicating they function as 
negative regulators in this pathway. No ethylene-related phenotype has been 
described for single loss-of-function receptor mutants, although it was reported 
that etr1 loss-of-function mutants display a growth defect limiting plant size. 
In actuality, this apparent growth defect results from enhanced responsiveness 
to ethylene; a phenotype manifested in all tissues tested. The phenotype 
displayed by etr1 loss-of-function mutants was rescued by treatment with an 
inhibitor of ethylene perception, indicating that it is ethylene dependent. 
Identification of an ethylene-dependent phenotype for a loss-of-function 
receptor mutant gave a unique opportunity for genetic and biochemical analysis 
of upstream events in ethylene signaling, including demonstration that the 
dominant ethylene-insensitive phenotype of etr2-1 is partially dependent on 
ETR1. This work demonstrates that mutational loss of the ethylene receptor ETR1 
alters responsiveness to ethylene in Arabidopsis and that enhanced ethylene 
response in Arabidopsis not only results in increased sensitivity but 
exaggeration of response.
