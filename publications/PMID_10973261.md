Astrocytomas are the leading cause of brain cancer in humans. Because these 
tumours are highly infiltrative, current treatments that rely on targeting the 
tumour mass are often ineffective. A mouse model for astrocytoma would be a 
powerful tool for dissecting tumour progression and testing therapeutics. Mouse 
models of astrocytoma have been designed to express oncogenic proteins in 
astrocytes, but have had limited success due to low tumour penetrance or limited 
tumour progression. We present here a mouse model of astrocytomas involving 
mutation of two tumour-suppressor genes, Nf1 and Trp53. Humans with mutations in 
NF1 develop neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) and have increased risk of optic 
gliomas, astrocytomas and glioblastomas. The TP53 tumour suppressor is often 
mutated in a subset of astrocytomas that develop at a young age and progress 
slowly to glioblastoma (termed secondary glioblastomas, in contrast to primary 
glioblastomas that develop rapidly de novo). This mouse model shows a range of 
astrocytoma stages, from low-grade astrocytoma to glioblastoma multiforme, and 
may accurately model human secondary glioblastoma involving TP53 loss. This is 
the first reported mouse model of astrocytoma initiated by loss of tumour 
suppressors, rather than overexpression of transgenic oncogenes.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal of primary brain tumors. Here we report our studies of MT-125, a small molecule inhibitor of non-muscle myosin II. MT-125 has high brain penetrance and an excellent safety profile; blocks GBM invasion and cytokinesis; and prolongs survival in murine GBM models. By impairing mitochondrial fission, MT-125 increases redox stress and consequent DNA damage, and it synergizes with radiotherapy. MT-125 also induces oncogene addiction to PDGFR signaling through a mechanism that is driven by redox stress, and it synergizes with FDA-approved PDGFR and mTOR inhibitors in vitro. Consistent with this, we find that combining MT-125 with sunitinib, a PDGFR inhibitor, or paxalisib, a combined PI3 Kinase/mTOR inhibitor significantly improves survival in orthotopic GBM models over either drug alone. Our results demonstrate that MT-125 is a first-in-class therapeutic that has strong clinical potential for the treatment of GBM.

MT-125 is a small-molecule inhibitor of non-muscle myosin IIA and IIB, which has multiple therapeutic effects on glioblastoma through the ability to increase reactive oxygen species in tumor cells.
