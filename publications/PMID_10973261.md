Astrocytomas are the leading cause of brain cancer in humans. Because these 
tumours are highly infiltrative, current treatments that rely on targeting the 
tumour mass are often ineffective. A mouse model for astrocytoma would be a 
powerful tool for dissecting tumour progression and testing therapeutics. Mouse 
models of astrocytoma have been designed to express oncogenic proteins in 
astrocytes, but have had limited success due to low tumour penetrance or limited 
tumour progression. We present here a mouse model of astrocytomas involving 
mutation of two tumour-suppressor genes, Nf1 and Trp53. Humans with mutations in 
NF1 develop neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) and have increased risk of optic 
gliomas, astrocytomas and glioblastomas. The TP53 tumour suppressor is often 
mutated in a subset of astrocytomas that develop at a young age and progress 
slowly to glioblastoma (termed secondary glioblastomas, in contrast to primary 
glioblastomas that develop rapidly de novo). This mouse model shows a range of 
astrocytoma stages, from low-grade astrocytoma to glioblastoma multiforme, and 
may accurately model human secondary glioblastoma involving TP53 loss. This is 
the first reported mouse model of astrocytoma initiated by loss of tumour 
suppressors, rather than overexpression of transgenic oncogenes.
