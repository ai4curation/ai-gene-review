Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), produced by sphingosine kinase (SPHK), acts both 
by intracellular and extracellular modes. We evaluated the role of SPHK1 and S1P 
in osteoclastogenesis using bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMM) single and 
BMM/osteoblast coculture systems. In BMM single cultures, the osteoclastogenic 
factor receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) upregulated SPHK1 and 
increased S1P production and secretion. SPHK1 siRNA enhanced and SPHK1 
overexpression attenuated osteoclastogenesis via modulation of p38 and ERK 
activities, and NFATc1 and c-Fos levels. Extracellular S1P had no effect in 
these cultures. These data suggest that intracellular S1P produced in response 
to RANKL forms a negative feedback loop in BMM single cultures. In contrast, S1P 
addition to BMM/osteoblast cocultures greatly increased osteoclastogenesis by 
increasing RANKL in osteoblasts via cyclooxygenase-2 and PGE(2) regulation. S1P 
also stimulated osteoblast migration and survival. The RANKL elevation and 
chemotactic effects were also observed with T cells. These results indicate that 
secreted S1P attracts and acts on osteoblasts and T cells to augment 
osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, S1P plays an important role in 
osteoclastogenesis regulation and in communication between osteoclasts and 
osteoblasts or T cells.

Abstract

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), produced by sphingosine kinase (SPHK), acts both by intracellular and extracellular modes. We evaluated the role of SPHK1 and S1P in osteoclastogenesis using bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMM) single and BMM/osteoblast coculture systems. In BMM single cultures, the osteoclastogenic factor receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) upregulated SPHK1 and increased S1P production and secretion. SPHK1 siRNA enhanced and SPHK1 overexpression attenuated osteoclastogenesis via modulation of p38 and ERK activities, and NFATc1 and c-Fos levels. Extracellular S1P had no effect in these cultures. These data suggest that intracellular S1P produced in response to RANKL forms a negative feedback loop in BMM single cultures. In contrast, S1P addition to BMM/osteoblast cocultures greatly increased osteoclastogenesis by increasing RANKL in osteoblasts via cyclooxygenase-2 and PGE 2 regulation. S1P also stimulated osteoblast migration and survival. The RANKL elevation and chemotactic effects were also observed with T cells. These results indicate that secreted S1P attracts and acts on osteoblasts and T cells to augment osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, S1P plays an important role in osteoclastogenesis regulation and in communication between osteoclasts and osteoblasts or T cells.

Introduction

Bone is a tissue continually regenerated through a remodeling process. In response to biochemical or mechanical signal, the basic multicellular unit (BMU) is organized at discrete sites in bone to perform remodeling. Once the BMU is formed, osteoclasts are activated to resorb old bone. Osteoblasts are recruited to the resorption area and new bone matrix is produced to fill the resorption pits. Subsequent mineralization of the matrix completes the remodeling process. Therefore, the coordinated action of osteoclasts and osteoblasts is important for proper bone remodeling, and an imbalance in the activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts leads to metabolic bone disorders. However, molecular mechanisms for the intricate interplay between the bone resorbing and forming cells have not been well characterized. Other cells present in bone such as vascular endothelial cells, bone stromal cells, and immune cells may also communicate with osteoclasts and osteoblasts, influencing bone metabolism under both physiological and pathological conditions.

Osteoclasts are specialized polykaryons that differentiate from monocyte–macrophage lineage precursors of hematopoietic cells. Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family member, plays an essential role in the commitment of precursors to osteoclastic differentiation ( Suda et al, 1999 ; Boyle et al, 2003 ; Teitelbaum and Ross, 2003 ). It is also important for activation and survival of differentiated osteoclasts. Macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) supports proliferation and survival of osteoclast precursors during differentiation. Early studies with coculture system of bone marrow osteoclast precursor cells and osteoblasts revealed that direct cell-to-cell interaction was needed for osteoclast generation. The cell surface molecular interaction for osteoclastic differentiation was later found to be between RANKL expressed on osteoblasts and RANK present on osteoclast precursors ( Suda et al, 1999 ). Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a soluble decoy receptor that binds RANKL, but unlike RANK, has no intracellular signaling capacity ( Boyle et al, 2003 ). Therefore, the RANKL–RANK–OPG axis is critical to determine osteoclastogenesis and bone homeostasis.

RANKL binding to its cognate receptor RANK leads to recruitment of adaptor proteins TRAFs (TNF receptor-associated factors) ( Lee and Kim, 2003 ; Boyle et al, 2003 ; Teitelbaum and Ross, 2003 ). Many in vitro and in vivo studies have provided evidence that TRAF6 may be the most critical TRAF protein in RANK signaling in osteoclasts ( Lomaga et al, 1999 ; Naito et al, 1999 ; Kobayashi et al, 2001 ). The downstream signaling events ensuing TRAF6 recruitment to RANK include activation of kinases such as PI3K/Akt, IKKs, and MAPKs ( Wong et al, 1999 ). The activation of signaling pathways mediated by these kinases leads to cytoskeletal organization necessary for migration and bone resorption activities, and induction of an array of genes required for differentiation and survival ( Boyle et al, 2003 ; Lee and Kim, 2003 ; Teitelbaum and Ross, 2003 ). Recent studies have demonstrated that NFATc1 is the transcription factor profoundly increased by RANKL and required for osteoclastogenesis ( Takayanagi et al, 2002 ). In turn, NFATc1 induction by RANKL is dependent on c-Fos and positive feedback by NFATc1 itself ( Takayanagi et al, 2002 ; Matsuo et al, 2004 ).

Sphingosine kinase (SPHK) is a lipid kinase that phosphorylates sphingosine to generate sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Two mammalian isoforms, SPHK1 and SPHK2, have been identified. S1P has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including cell differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation, and motility ( Spiegel and Milstien, 2003 ; Futerman and Hannun, 2004 ). The diversity in cell responses elicited by S1P may be attained in part by its dual characteristics of being both an intracellular second messenger and an extracellular signal. In addition, the presence of multiple cell surface receptors may contribute to the complexity of S1P effects. Five mammalian S1P receptors have been identified so far—S1P 1 /endothelial differentiation gene 1 (EDG1), S1P 2 /EDG5, S1P 3 /EDG3, S1P 4 /EDG6, and S1P 5 /EDG8. Upon engagement with extracellular S1P, each of these receptors couples to a specific set of heterotrimeric G proteins to trigger plethora of intracellular signaling pathways ( Spiegel and Milstien, 2003 ). Although the direct targets of intracellular S1P are not clear, the amount of intracellular S1P relative to ceramide and sphingosine has been suggested to be important in the regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, and calcium homeostasis ( Spiegel and Milstien, 2003 ). FTY-720, a structural analog of sphingosine and a novel immunosuppressant, can be converted to phosphate ester form by SPHK and phospho-FTY-720 binds with higher affinity than S1P to all S1P receptors except S1P 2 ( Brinkmann et al, 2002 ; Yopp et al, 2003 ). In contrast to S1P-mimicking effects, functional antagonism against certain S1P-stimulated responses, such as T-cell chemotaxis and angiogenesis, have also been demonstrated for FTY-720 ( Graeler and Goetzl, 2002 ; LaMontagne et al, 2006 ). Although the antagonistic function of FTY-720 has been suggested to be due to internalization and partial degradation of S1P receptors ( Kaneider et al, 2004 ), the precise mechanism of action of FTY-720 as well as that of S1P is far from comprehensive understanding.

In this study, we investigated the possibility of involvement of SPHK1 and S1P in osteoclast differentiation. We found that SPHK1 activated by RANKL plays dichotomous function for osteoclast differentiation: intracellular S1P attenuates osteoclast differentiation program, whereas S1P secreted from stimulated osteoclast precursor cells acts on osteoblasts to augment osteoclastogenesis by increasing RANKL expression. Secreted S1P also chemoattracts osteoblasts and enhances their survival. Our studies identify the SPHK1–S1P system as a novel player in osteoclastogenesis regulation and in communication between osteoclasts and osteoblasts in bone metabolism.

Discussion

In the present study, we demonstrate that SPHK1 has a dichotomous role in osteoclast differentiation, depending on the microenvironment where osteoclast precursors are present. SPHK1 has a negative role in osteoclastogenesis when a single population of osteoclast precursor cells (BMMs) is induced to differentiate by the soluble osteoclastogenic factor, RANKL. On the other hand, in coculture conditions, where cell surface RANKL on osteoblasts supports osteoclastic differentiation of BMMs, SPHK1 and its product, S1P, function positively in osteoclastogenesis. RANKL stimulates SPHK1 activity and S1P production in the precursor and differentiating BMMs during osteoclastogenesis. However, gene manipulation experiments show that suppression of SPHK1 expression by siRNA introduction enhances, whereas overexpression by SPHK1 retroviral transduction decreases osteoclast formation when BMMs are challenged with RANKL in the absence of osteoblasts. These observations suggest that SPHK1 activation and subsequent S1P production in response to the RANKL differentiation signal comprises a negative feedback loop in osteoclastogenesis. This BMM-autonomous negative feedback is likely to be mediated by intracellular S1P as exogenous addition of S1P does not have any effect on BMM osteoclastogenesis.

RANKL triggers the activation of MAPK family kinases in osteoclast precursors ( Lee and Kim, 2003 ). Evidence for the requirement of p38 MAPKs for osteoclastogenesis has been accumulated by studies with pharmacological inhibitors and dominant-negative forms of kinases ( Matsumoto et al, 2000 ; Lee et al, 2002 ; Li et al, 2002b ; Huang et al, 2006 ). In contrast, conflicting results have been reported on the role of ERKs in osteoclast differentiation. The ERK pathway inhibitor PD98059 displayed no, suppressive, or augmenting effects on osteoclastogenesis depending on the cell types of osteoclast precursors, culture conditions, and concentrations of the inhibitor ( Matsumoto et al, 2000 ; Hotokezaka et al, 2002 ; Lee et al, 2002 ). The contribution of ERKs to osteoclastogenesis may depend on the context of balance with other MAPK activities. In line with this notion, the balance in the p38 and ERK activation appears critical for the function of SPHK1 in osteoclast differentiation. The negative effect of SPHK1 overexpression and the positive effect of SPHK1 knockdown by siRNA on BMM osteoclastogenesis well correlate with the changes in the extents of ERK and p38 activation by RANKL; the increased p38 and decreased ERK activity parallel with enhanced osteoclastogenesis. Whether S1P modulates these MAPKs directly or whether S1P targets other upstream components in the signaling pathways to these MAPKs is an intriguing question to be addressed. Our study also indicates that the influence of SPHK1 on osteoclastogenesis is associated with RANKL regulation of NFATc1 and c-Fos, key transcription factors required for osteoclast differentiation. The induction of NFATc1 and c-Fos by RANKL in BMMs was dependent on p38 activity. Thus, p38 is an important mediator for the modulation of osteoclastogenesis by SPHK1.

In contrast to BMM single cultures, SPHK1 activity positively regulates osteoclastogenesis in cocultures of BMMs and osteoblasts. S1P significantly increases osteoclast formation in coculture treated with VtD 3 . This effect of S1P appears to be due to stimulation of PGE 2 synthesis, which leads to an increase in RANKL expression in osteoblasts ( Li et al, 2002a ). As RANKL stimulation of BMMs results in S1P production and secretion, the induction of RANKL by S1P in osteoblasts constitutes a positive feedback loop for osteoclastogenesis in the coculture system. Thus, SPHK1 activity can generate both a negative and a positive feedback, depending on the culture system. In normal bone remodeling, osteoclast precursors and differentiating osteoclasts are likely to be in the vicinity of preosteoblasts, osteoblasts, and marrow stromal cells. Therefore, it is more likely that SPHK1 activity functions positively in osteoclast development under this condition. Under conditions where osteoblasts forming new bone matrix are not around, the negative feedback mechanism shown in BMM single culture may have a role in holding massive osteoclastogenesis in check to prevent unbalanced excessive bone resorption.

S1P has been shown to play important roles in cell migration for vascular and cardiac development and lymphocyte trafficking ( Spiegel and Milstien, 2003 ). It also functions as an autocrine chemotactic factor to mast cells ( Jolly et al, 2004 ). S1P produced by RANKL stimulation during osteoclastogenesis may attract, in both autocrine and paracrine manners, osteoclast precursors and other types of cells in bone. In fact, S1P exhibited chemotactic effect on the migration of BMM osteoclast precursors and osteoblasts. Attraction of osteoclast precursors will facilitate cell fusion with differentiating cells to generate multinucleated mature osteoclasts. However, this stimulatory effect on osteoclastogenesis may be compromised by the intrinsic action of intracellular S1P that negatively regulates osteoclast differentiation. Paracrine action of S1P to osteoblasts will attract the bone-forming cells to the vicinity of osteoclasts. In our study, S1P and the CM of BMMs transduced to overexpress SPHK1 stimulated migration and survival of osteoblasts. This paracrine mode of S1P function must be beneficial to coupling between bone resorption and new bone formation in normal bone remodeling.

COX2 catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin biosynthesis ( Dixon, 2004 ). The regulation of COX2 levels has been described at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels ( Dixon et al, 2003 ; Ramsay et al, 2003 ). Several transcription factors including AP-1 ( Guo et al, 2001 ) and CREB ( Park et al, 2005 ) have been shown to be involved in the transcriptional induction of COX2. COX2 expression is also regulated by control of mRNA stability and translation efficiency, which is mediated through sequences in the 3′-untranslated region ( Mukhopadhyay et al, 2003 ). In addition, protein degradation has been implicated in COX2 regulation ( Zaric and Ruegg, 2005 ). These diverse aspects lend regulation mechanisms for COX2 complex, and the relative contribution of each element of COX2 regulation appears different in different cell types in response to different stimuli. MAPKs of the ERK, JNK, and p38 families have been implicated in both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of COX2 expression ( Xu et al, 2000 ; Rousseau et al, 2002 , Park et al, 2005 ; Wu et al, 2006 ). However, the type of MAPKs involved and the regulation aspect targeted have been differentially described for different experimental conditions. We for the first time demonstrate that S1P increases COX2 in osteoblasts. Our study is also the first to show the involvement of p38 in S1P-induced COX2 upregulation in any cell type. The participation of ERK in S1P-stimulated COX2 increase has been documented in other cell types ( Hsieh et al, 2006 ). The identification of precise targets of ERKs and p38 MAPKs in the COX2 increase by S1P in osteoblasts requires further investigation.

Our data indicate that S1P-stimulated COX2 induction and PGE 2 production increase RANKL in osteoblasts, which consequently stimulates osteoclast formation. COX2, PGE 2 , and RANKL may comprise an important axis in pathogenic conditions involving bone erosion. In ovariectomized animal models of osteoporosis, increased COX2 activity, PGE 2 production, and RANKL induction have been suggested to participate in osteoclast generation and bone resorption ( Kanematsu et al, 2000 ). Recently, in synoviocytes from RA patients, S1P was shown to stimulate COX2 expression and PGE 2 production ( Kitano et al, 2006 ). RANKL is expressed by synovial fibroblasts and activated T cells from RA tissues ( Gravallese et al, 2000 ; Takayanagi et al, 2000 ). Although direct evidence is lacking, the S1P–COX2–PGE 2 axis is likely to participate in RANKL induction in RA synovium. In RA synovium, SPHK activation and S1P production during osteoclast differentiation will provoke more RANKL expression through COX2–PGE2 production in surrounding cells, such as preosteoblasts, synovial fibroblasts, and T cells. This will compose a vicious cycle of osteoclast generation and bone resorption, exacerbating the disease condition. S1P can also function to recruit activated T cells and other immune cells to the site of osteoclastogenesis in pathologic conditions. We observed that the CM from SPHK1-overexpressing pOc-stimulated T-cell migration. Furthermore, extracellular S1P enhanced RANKL expression in activated T cells. Therefore, S1P produced during osteoclastogenesis under inflammatory conditions, such as RA and periodontal diseases, may play a detrimental role through combined effects on T-cell chemotaxis and RANKL expression.

Based on our data presented here, a schematic diagram of osteoclastogenesis modulation by the SPHK1-S1P signaling is shown in Figure 10 . When RANKL binds to RANK on BMMs, osteoclastic differentiation is triggered by activation of downstream signals such as p38, c-Fos, and NFATc1. S1P is also generated upon the activation of SPHK1 in response to RANKL. Intracellular production of S1P comprises a negative feedback loop in osteoclastogenesis owing to its inhibitory effect on p38 activation in BMMs. S1P exported to extracellular environment can bind to S1P receptors in osteoblasts. Binding of S1P to S1P receptors on osteoblasts leads to an increase in COX2 level through a mechanism dependent on ERK and p38. COX2 induction stimulates PGE 2 production, which induces RANKL expression. The increased RANKL molecules in osteoblasts in turn bind to more RANK on BMMs and facilitate osteoclastic differentiation. Extracellular S1P also stimulates osteoblast migration and survival, contributing to the coupling between osteoclast and osteoblast activity.

In conclusion, our studies reveal that SPHK1 and S1P play important roles in osteoclastogenesis regulation. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing involvement of SPHK1 and S1P in osteoclast differentiation. Our results may provide a basis for exploring the therapeutic potential of S1P receptor antagonists for inflammatory disease-associated bone destruction.
