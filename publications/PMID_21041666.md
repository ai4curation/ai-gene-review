Regulated conformational changes of proteins are critical for cellular signal 
transduction. The spindle checkpoint protein Mad2 is an unusual protein with two 
native folds: the latent open conformer (O-Mad2) and the activated closed 
conformer (C-Mad2). During mitosis, cytosolic O-Mad2 binds to the Mad1-Mad2 core 
complex at unattached kinetochores and undergoes conformational activation to 
become C-Mad2. C-Mad2 binds to and inhibits Cdc20, an activator of APC/C, to 
prevent precocious anaphase onset. Here, we show that the conformational 
transition of Mad2 is regulated by phosphorylation of S195 in its C-terminal 
region. The phospho-mimicking Mad2(S195D) mutant and the phospho-S195 Mad2 
protein obtained using intein-mediated semisynthesis do not form C-Mad2 on their 
own. Mad2(S195D) fails to bind to Cdc20, a low-affinity ligand, but still binds 
to high-affinity ligands, such as Mad1 and MBP1, forming ligand-bound C-Mad2. 
Overexpression of Mad2(S195D) in human cells causes checkpoint defects. Our 
results indicate that Mad2 phosphorylation inhibits its function through 
differentially regulating its binding to Mad1 and Cdc20 and establish that the 
conformational change of Mad2 is regulated by posttranslational mechanisms.
