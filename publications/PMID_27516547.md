CsrA (carbon storage regulator A) is a widely distributed bacterial RNA binding 
protein that regulates translation initiation and mRNA stability of target 
transcripts. In γ-proteobacteria, CsrA activity is competitively antagonized by 
one or more small RNAs (sRNAs) containing multiple CsrA binding sites, but CsrA 
in bacteria outside the γ-proteobacteria is antagonized by a protein called 
FliW. Here we show that FliW of Bacillus subtilis does not bind to the same 
residues of CsrA required for RNA binding. Instead, CsrA mutants resistant to 
FliW antagonism (crw) altered residues of CsrA on an allosteric surface of 
previously unattributed function. Some crw mutants abolished CsrA-FliW binding, 
but others did not, suggesting that FliW and RNA interaction is not mutually 
exclusive. We conclude that FliW inhibits CsrA by a noncompetitive mechanism 
that differs dramatically from the well-established sRNA inhibitors. FliW is 
highly conserved with CsrA in bacteria, appears to be the ancestral form of CsrA 
regulation, and represents a widespread noncompetitive mechanism of CsrA 
control.
