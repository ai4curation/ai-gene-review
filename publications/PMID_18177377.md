The chaperone calreticulin has been suggested to function as a C1q and collectin 
receptor. The interaction of calreticulin with mannan-binding lectin (MBL) was 
investigated by solid-phase binding assays. Calreticulin showed saturable and 
time-dependent binding to recombinant MBL, provided that MBL was immobilized on 
a solid surface or bound to mannan on a surface. The binding was non-covalent 
and biphasic with an initial salt-sensitive phase followed by a more stable 
salt-insensitive interaction. For plasma-derived MBL, known to be complexed with 
MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs), no binding was observed. Interaction of 
calreticulin with recombinant MBL was fully inhibited by recombinant MASP-2, 
MASP-3 and MAp19, but not by the MASP-2 D105G and MAp19 Y59A variants 
characterized by defective MBL binding ability. Furthermore, MBL point mutants 
with impaired MASP binding showed no interaction with calreticulin. Comparative 
analysis of MBL with complement component C1q, its counterpart of the classical 
pathway, revealed that they display similar binding characteristics for 
calreticulin, providing further indication that calreticulin is a common 
co-receptor/chaperone for both proteins. In conclusion, the potential MBL 
co-receptor calreticulin binds to MBL at the MASP binding site and the 
interaction may involve a conformational change in MBL.
