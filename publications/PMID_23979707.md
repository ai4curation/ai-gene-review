Proteomics has been successfully used for cell culture on dishes, but more 
complex cellular systems have proven to be challenging and so far poorly 
approached with proteomics. Because of the complexity of the angiogenic program, 
we still do not have a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms 
involved in this process, and there have been no in depth quantitative proteomic 
studies. Plating endothelial cells on matrigel recapitulates aspects of vessel 
growth, and here we investigate this mechanism by using a spike-in SILAC 
quantitative proteomic approach. By comparing proteomic changes in primary human 
endothelial cells morphogenesis on matrigel to general adhesion mechanisms in 
cells spreading on culture dish, we pinpoint pathways and proteins modulated by 
endothelial cells. The cell-extracellular matrix adhesion proteome depends on 
the adhesion substrate, and a detailed proteomic profile of the extracellular 
matrix secreted by endothelial cells identified CLEC14A as a matrix component, 
which binds to MMRN2. We verify deregulated levels of these proteins during 
tumor angiogenesis in models of multistage carcinogenesis. This is the most in 
depth quantitative proteomic study of endothelial cell morphogenesis, which 
shows the potential of applying high accuracy quantitative proteomics to in 
vitro models of vessel growth to shed new light on mechanisms that accompany 
pathological angiogenesis. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been 
deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium with the data set identifier

Abstract

Proteomics has been successfully used for cell culture on dishes, but more complex cellular systems have proven to be challenging and so far poorly approached with proteomics. Because of the complexity of the angiogenic program, we still do not have a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in this process, and there have been no in depth quantitative proteomic studies. Plating endothelial cells on matrigel recapitulates aspects of vessel growth, and here we investigate this mechanism by using a spike-in SILAC quantitative proteomic approach. By comparing proteomic changes in primary human endothelial cells morphogenesis on matrigel to general adhesion mechanisms in cells spreading on culture dish, we pinpoint pathways and proteins modulated by endothelial cells. The cell–extracellular matrix adhesion proteome depends on the adhesion substrate, and a detailed proteomic profile of the extracellular matrix secreted by endothelial cells identified CLEC14A as a matrix component, which binds to MMRN2. We verify deregulated levels of these proteins during tumor angiogenesis in models of multistage carcinogenesis. This is the most in depth quantitative proteomic study of endothelial cell morphogenesis, which shows the potential of applying high accuracy quantitative proteomics to in vitro models of vessel growth to shed new light on mechanisms that accompany pathological angiogenesis. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium with the data set identifier PXD000359.

DISCUSSION

Our mass spectrometric analysis of HUVECs during tubules morphogenesis in matrigel shows that this process involves significant changes of about 20% of the proteome, which we measured to a depth of more than 3,700 proteins, the most in depth endothelial proteome generated so far. The accuracy of the quantitative approach allowed us to shed new light on EC regulation. This is illustrated by a very reproducible regulation in abundance of a remarkable number of cell adhesion and metabolism-related proteins and enzymes. Furthermore, we provide the first in depth characterization of the HUVEC matrixome, which we proved to be an excellent resource of proteins deregulated in tumor angiogenesis.

Cell–matrix adhesion regulates EC sprouting and migration during angiogenesis, and provides support and stability to the newly formed capillary. Importantly, adhesion mechanisms can be influenced by the environment surrounding the cell, and here we show that ECs differently modulate their adhesion machinery during morphogenesis and spreading ( Fig. 3 A ). An important difference between the matrigel and spreading systems used for this study is the mechanical property of the matrix, where matrigel is soft and other ECMs are rigid. Accordingly, among the regulated cell adhesion proteins the levels of the cell contractility regulators MYL12A and MYL9 decreased in morphogenesis, while they were augmented during spreading. Because increasing ECM rigidity has been shown to support tumor progression ( 51 ), we speculate that the differentially regulated adhesion proteins ( supplemental Table S5 ) may be relevant to understanding the role of ECM stiffness on EC behavior in tumors.

Tumor vessels often display absent or abnormally thick ECM, which impact their function ( 3 ). Our MS analyses highlighted significantly increased levels of ECM proteins during HUVECs morphogenesis ( supplemental Table S7 ), and we discovered that CLEC14A is an ECM component. We showed that CLEC14A binds to and colocalizes, in vitro and in vivo , with FN1 and LAMA4, which are master regulators of angiogenesis and previously found deregulated in tumor vessels ( 2 , 52 ) and with MMRN2 ( Fig. 4 ). In contrast to our results, MMRN2 overexpression has been reported to inhibit angiogenesis by affecting VEGF signaling ( 53 ). This suggests that MMRN2 effects on endothelial cells might be context and dose-dependent and that further studies are needed to elucidate its function in angiogenesis. Furthermore, we show that CLEC14A and MMRN2 are EC marker, functional in HUVECs, and that CLEC14A is highly expressed in tumor compared with normal vessels. This confirmed previous literature ( 54 , 55 ). Additionally, through multiple-stage mouse tumor models, RIP-Tag2 and HPV16/E 2 , we identified Clec14a and Mmrn2 deregulation at specific stages of tumorigenesis ( Figs. 5 , supplemental Figs. S2, S3 ). These mice will therefore be valuable models to further investigate Clec14a and Mmrn2 functions in tumor angiogenesis. Similarly to CLEC14A, other matrixome components contained in our screen ( supplemental Table S7 ) and that were not previously known to be localized at the ECM may be interesting candidates for further investigation of their role in normal and pathological angiogenesis.

Our results show that applying modern proteomic technologies to established in vitro model of angiogenesis is a powerful approach to discover functional regulations in endothelial cells, relevant for the angiogenic process in vivo . Here we have functionally explored ECM proteins, but other processes were also found regulated. For instance, significantly altered abundance was measured for a remarkable number of metabolic proteins, a phenomenon that to our knowledge has not been observed in morphogenesis before ( Figs. 3 A , supplemental Table S5 ). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that our proteomic study of ECs morphogenesis and spreading provides valuable information that can help to unravel molecular mechanisms regulating endothelial cells behavior. Our data may contain the basis for further exciting insights to be investigated in angiogenesis in vivo , especially with a view to interfering with this process in pathologies.
