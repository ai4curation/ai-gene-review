Endothelin (EDN) receptor type B (EDNRB) activates serum response factor (SRF) 
via G(q/11) and G(12/13) G proteins. In this study, we investigated the 
involvement of intracellular loop sequences of EDNRB in coupling to these G 
proteins. EDNRB mutants were generated and tested for their abilities to 
activate SRF in NIH3T3 cells and in the mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line 
(F(q/11)) lacking both Galpha(q) and Galpha(11). EDNRB can activate SRF in 
NIH3T3 cells via G(q/11), although it can only activate SRF through G(12/13) in 
F(q/11) cells. Mutants with mutations in the second and third inner loops of 
EDNRB functioned in the same manner in both cell lines, either able or unable to 
activate SRF. This finding suggests that the second and third inner loops of 
EDNRB either participate or not in coupling to both G(q/11) and G(12/13) but are 
not specific for either one. However, in the first inner loop, a substitution of 
three Ala residues for Met(128)-Arg(129)-Asn(130) abolished the ability to 
activate SRF only in F(q/11) cells, suggesting that this mutation might 
specifically disrupt the coupling to G(12/13) rather than to G(q/11). Further 
characterization of this first inner loop mutant revealed that exogenous 
expression of Galpha(12) or Galpha(q) could restore SRF activation, whereas the 
expression of Galpha(13) did not. Therefore, we conclude that although the three 
intracellular loops of EDNRB may be involved in coupling to G proteins, residues 
Met(128)-Arg(129)-Asn(130) in the first intracellular loop are specifically 
required for activation of Galpha(13).
