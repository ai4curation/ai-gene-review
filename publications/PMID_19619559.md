The LIM-homeodomain transcription factor ISL1 (islet factor 1) is essential for 
pancreatic islet cell and dorsal mesenchyme development. Mutations in ISL1 are 
associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young and type 2 diabetes. 
Whether ISL1 plays a role in the insulin gene expression has not been fully 
elucidated. In the present study, we show that ISL1 can synergistically activate 
insulin gene transcription with BETA2 in pancreatic beta cells. The 
protein-protein interactions of ISL1 and BETA2 are directly mediated by the LIM 
domains of ISL1 and the basic helix-loop-helix domain of BETA2. Deletion of the 
two LIM domains of ISL1 enhances the transcriptional activation of the insulin 
gene, indicating a key role for the homeodomain in activating the insulin 
promoter. Furthermore, ISL1 can bind with the A3/4 box in the rat insulin gene 
capital I, Ukrainian promoter through its homeodomain. ISL1 expression is 
up-regulated at the mRNA level in type 2 diabetes (db/db mouse model) but 
down-regulated by dexamethasone in rat insulinoma cells. These results suggest 
that ISL1 is a transcriptional activator for insulin gene expression, and the 
interactions of ISL1 with BETA2 are required for the transcriptional activity of 
the insulin gene. Reduction in Isl1 gene expression appears to be involved in 
the impairment of insulin expression mediated by dexamethasone.
