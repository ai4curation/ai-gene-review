Microglia are phagocytic cells that survey the brain and perform neuroprotective 
functions in response to tissue damage, but their activating receptors are 
largely unknown. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a 
microglial immunoreceptor whose loss-of-function mutations in humans cause 
presenile dementia, while genetic variants are associated with increased risk of 
neurodegenerative diseases. In myeloid cells, TREM2 has been involved in the 
regulation of phagocytosis, cell proliferation and inflammatory responses in 
vitro. However, it is unknown how TREM2 contributes to microglia function in 
vivo. Here, we identify a critical role for TREM2 in the activation and function 
of microglia during cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination. TREM2-deficient 
(TREM2(-/-)) mice had defective clearance of myelin debris and more axonal 
pathology, resulting in impaired clinical performances compared to wild-type 
(WT) mice. TREM2(-/-) microglia proliferated less in areas of demyelination and 
were less activated, displaying a more resting morphology and decreased 
expression of the activation markers MHC II and inducible nitric oxide synthase 
as compared to WT. Mechanistically, gene expression and ultrastructural analysis 
of microglia suggested a defect in myelin degradation and phagosome processing 
during CPZ intoxication in TREM2(-/-) microglia. These findings place TREM2 as a 
key regulator of microglia activation in vivo in response to tissue damage.
