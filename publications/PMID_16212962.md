We address here the involvement of the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 
(HIPK2)/p53 complex on MDM2 regulation following apoptotic DNA damage. Our 
results provide a plausible transcriptional (p53-dependent) and 
posttranscriptional (p53-independent) double mechanism by which HIPK2 
accomplishes MDM2 downmodulation. First, in wtp53-carrying cells HIPK2-dependent 
p53Ser46 phosphorylation selectively inhibits MDM2 at transcriptional level. 
Secondly, HIPK2 interacts with MDM2 in vitro and in vivo and promotes MDM2 
nuclear export and proteasomal degradation, in p53-null cellular context. This 
p53-independent effect is likely mediated by HIPK2 catalytic activity and we 
found that HIPK2 phosphorylates MDM2 in vitro. In response to DNA damage, 
depletion of HIPK2 by RNA-interference abolishes MDM2 protein degradation. We 
propose that HIPK2 contributes to drug-induced modulation of MDM2 activity at 
transcriptional (through p53Ser46 phosphorylation) and posttranscriptional 
(through p53-independent subcellular re-localization and proteasomal 
degradation) levels.
