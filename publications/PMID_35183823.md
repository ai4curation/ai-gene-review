Myocarditis is a kind of myocardial inflammatory infiltration disease. Many 
interventions are not effective in the treatment of myocarditis because the 
mechanism of myocarditis has not been elucidated. Previous studies have found 
that interleukin-17 (IL-17) could stimulate the expression of monocyte chemokine 
protein 1 (MCP-1) and mediate myocardial inflammatory infiltration. This study 
aimed to explore the role of Act1/TRAF6/TAK1 cascade in IL-17-induced MCP-1 
expression based on a well-designed experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) 
model. It was found that IL-17 could stimulate the expression of MCP-1 by 
activating Act1/TRAF6/TAK1 cascade in EAM. The expression of Act1, TRAF6 and 
TAK1 followed downregulation by the application of IL-17 antibody. Additionally, 
myocardial inflammatory cell infiltration was observably alleviated by 
interfering TAK1 with TAK1 siRNA, and both MCP-1 mRNA and protein expression 
followed downregulation. This study suggested that IL-17 could activate the 
Act1/TRAF6/TAK1 pathway to upregulate MCP-1 expression in the EAM, and will 
offer a new perspective for the study on the mechanism of myocarditis.
