The recently cloned human interleukin 13 (IL-13) is a novel cytokine expressed 
in activated T cells that has been shown to inhibit inflammatory cytokine 
production by lipopolysaccharide-activated monocytes. The protein encoded by the 
IL-13 cDNA is the human homologue of a mouse Th2-product called P600. Here, we 
show that IL-13 acts at different stages of the B cell maturation pathway: (a) 
it enhances the expression of CD23/Fc epsilon RII and class II MHC antigens on 
resting B cells; (b) it stimulates B cell proliferation in combination with 
anti-Ig and anti-CD40 antibodies; and (c) it induces IgE synthesis. Thus, the 
spectrum of the biological activities of IL-13 on B cells largely overlaps that 
previously ascribed to IL-4. The present observations suggest that IL-13 may be 
an important factor, in addition to IL-4, in the development of allergic 
diseases.
