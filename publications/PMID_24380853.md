In this study, we aimed to investigate the aberrant expression and shift in 
localization of prohibitin (PHB) during apoptosis of human cholangiocarcinoma 
cells. Our study demonstrated that PHB was expressed primarily in the cytoplasm 
and only a little in the nucleus. However, PHB expression significantly 
decreased, and its localization shifted from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during 
apoptosis. PHB co-localized with AIF, Rb, p53, and c-Fos, but the region of 
co-localization was altered after treatment. Meanwhile, we detected a direct 
interaction between PHB and both p53 and Rb in Mz-ChA-1 cells. These results 
suggest that the altered localization and expression of PHB, as well as its 
co-localization with related oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, can affect 
the apoptosis of Mz-ChA-1 cells.
