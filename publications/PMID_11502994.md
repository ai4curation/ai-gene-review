BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare the 
safety and efficacy of enalapril (E) and losartan (L) in the treatment of 
posttransplantation erythrocytosis and the effect of the ACE genotype on 
response to therapy.
METHODS: Twenty-seven (24 male and 3 female, mean age 34+/-8 years) renal 
transplant recipients with erythrocytosis were treated either with E (15 
patients) (10 mg/day) or L (12 patients) (50 mg/day) for 8 weeks.
RESULTS: The hemoglobin levels were significantly decreased in the L (17.1+/-0.7 
to 15.9+/-1.3 g/dl, P=0.01) and E groups (17.4+/-1.1 to 14.9+/-2.2 g/dl, 
P=0.001). Among the responders who discontinued treatment, there was a trend for 
longer time to relapse in the L group (7.38+/-3.75 months; 95% confidence 
interval: 0.03-14.7) compared with the E group (2.75+/-0.70 (95% confidence 
interval: 1.37-4.13) (P=0.11). Decrease in hemoglobin was more prominent with E 
compared with L (-3.26+/-0.65 vs. -1.70+/-0.39 g/dl, P=0.05). Decrease in 
hemoglobin levels between DD and non-DD genotype groups was similar (-2.0+/-1.5 
vs. -1.7+/-2.3 g/dl, P=0.69).
CONCLUSIONS: Enalapril caused a greater decrease but faster relapse in 
hemoglobin levels compared with losartan in patients with posttransplantation 
erythrocytosis. The DD type polymorphism had no effect on response.
