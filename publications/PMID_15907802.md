C19ORF5 is a homologue of microtubule-associated protein MAP1B that interacts 
with natural paclitaxel-like microtubule stabilizer and candidate tumor 
suppressor RASSF1A. Although normally distributed throughout the cytosol, 
C19ORF5 specifically associates with microtubules stabilized by paclitaxel or 
RASSF1A. At sufficiently high concentrations, C19ORF5 causes mitochondrial 
aggregation and genome destruction (MAGD). The accumulation on hyperstabilized 
microtubules coupled to MAGD has been proposed to mediate tumor suppression by 
the taxoid drug family and RASSF1A. Here, we show that the C-terminus of C19ORF5 
(C19ORF5C) interacts with mitochondria-associated DNA binding protein, LRPPRC, 
in liver cells. Like LRPPRC, C19ORF5 also binds DNA with an affinity and 
specificity sufficient to be of utility in DNA affinity chromatography to purify 
homogeneous recombinant C19ORF5C from bacterial extracts. Homogeneous C19ORF5 
exhibited no intrinsic DNase activity. Deletion mutagenesis indicated that 
C19ORF5 selectively binds double stranded DNA through its microtubule binding 
domain. These results suggest C19ORF5 as a DNA binding protein similar to 
microtubule-associated proteins tau and MAP2.
