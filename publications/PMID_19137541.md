The Clusterin (CLU) gene produces different forms of protein products, which 
vary in their biological properties and distribution within the cell. Both the 
extra- and intracellular CLU forms regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. 
Dis-regulation of CLU expression occurs in many cancer types, including prostate 
cancer. The role that CLU plays in tumorigenesis is still unclear. We found that 
CLU over-expression inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in 
prostate cancer cells. Here we show that depletion of CLU affects the growth of 
PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Following siRNA targeting all CLU mRNA variants, all 
protein products quickly disappeared, inducing cell cycle progression and higher 
expression of specific proliferation markers (i.e., H3 mRNA, PCNA, and cyclins 
A, B1, and D) as detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot. Quite surprisingly, we 
also found that the turnover of CLU protein is very rapid and tightly regulated 
by ubiquitin-proteasome mediated degradation. Inhibition of protein synthesis by 
cycloheximide showed that CLU half-life is less than 2 h. CLU protein products 
were found poly-ubiquitinated by co-immuniprecipitation. Proteasome inhibition 
by MG132 caused stabilization and accumulation of all CLU protein products, 
including the nuclear form of CLU (nCLU), and committing cells to 
caspase-dependent death. In conclusion, proteasome inhibition may induce 
prostate cancer cell death through accumulation of nCLU, a potential tumor 
suppressor factor.
