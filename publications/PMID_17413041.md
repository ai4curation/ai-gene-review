Thrombospondin-1 is a multifunctional protein interacting with several cell 
surface receptors including integrins. We found that it is a ligand for 
alpha9beta1 integrin, and has an integrin binding site within its N-terminal 
domain (NoC1). Interaction of thrombospondin-1 and its recombinant NoC1 domain 
with alpha9beta1 integrin was confirmed in ELISA and cell adhesion assays. 
Binding of NoC1 to cells expressing alpha9beta1 integrin activated signaling 
proteins such as Erk1/2 and paxillin. Blocking of this integrin by monoclonal 
antibody and the met-leu-asp-disintegrin inhibited dermal human microvascular 
endothelial cell proliferation and NoC1-induced migration of these cells. 
Immunohistochemical studies revealed that alpha9beta1 is expressed on 
microvascular endothelium in several organs including skin, lung, heart and 
brain. NoC1 induced neovascularization in an experimental quail chorioallantoic 
membrane system and Matrigel plug formation assay in mice. This proangiogenic 
activity of NoC1 in vivo was inhibited by alpha9beta1 inhibitors. In summary, 
our results revealed that alpha9beta1 integrin expressed on microvascular 
endothelial cells interacts with thrombospondin-1, and this interaction is 
involved in modulation of angiogenesis.
