The A20 protein, which belongs to a class of Cys2/Cys2 zinc finger proteins, has 
been characterized as an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation. In order to clarify 
its molecular mechanism of action, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to 
screen for interacting proteins. We report that different isoforms of 14-3-3 
proteins, viz. eta and zeta, are able to bind A20, involving the 14-3-3-binding 
motif RSKSDP located between zinc fingers 3 and 4. However, A20 mutants that no 
longer associated with 14-3-3 proteins could still fully inhibit NF-kappaB 
activation induced by tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1beta or phorbol 
12-myristate 13-acetate, thus excluding a crucial role for 14-3-3 interaction in 
this A20 function.
