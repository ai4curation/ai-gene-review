SHP2 was recently found to down-regulate PI3K activation by dephosphorylating 
Gab1 but the mechanisms explaining the positive role of the Gab1/SHP2 pathway in 
EGF-induced Ras activation remain ill defined. Substrate trapping experiments 
now suggest that SHP2 dephosphorylates other Gab1 phosphotyrosines located 
within a central region displaying four YXXP motifs. Because these sites are 
potential docking motifs for Ras-GAP, we tested whether SHP2 dephosphorylates 
them to facilitate Ras activation. We observed that a Gab1 construct preventing 
SHP2 recruitment promoted membrane relocation of RasGAP. Moreover, a 
RasGAP-inactive mutant restored the activation of Ras in cells transfected with 
SHP2-inactivating Gab1 mutant or in SHP2-deficient fibroblasts, supporting the 
hypothesis that RasGAP is a downstream target of SHP2. To determine whether Gab1 
is a RasGAP-binding partner, a Gab1 mutant deleted of four YXXP motifs was 
produced. The deletion suppressed RasGAP redistribution and restored the 
defective Ras activation caused by SHP2-inactivating mutations. Moreover, Gab1 
was found to interact with RasGAP SH2 domains, only under conditions where SHP2 
is not activated. To identify Ras-GAP-binding sites, Tyr to Phe mutants of Gab1 
YXXP motifs were produced. Gab1 constructs mutated on Tyr(317) were severely 
affected in RasGAP binding and were the most active in compensating for 
Ras-defective activation and blocking RasGAP redistribution induced by SHP2 
inactivation. We have thus localized on Gab1 a Ras-negative regulatory tyrosine 
phosphorylation site involved in RasGAP binding and showed that an important 
SHP2 function is to down-regulate its phosphorylation to disengage RasGAP and 
sustain Ras activation.
