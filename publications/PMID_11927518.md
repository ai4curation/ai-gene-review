BACKGROUND: The functional changes associated with cellular senescence may be 
involved in human aging and age-related vascular disorders. We have shown the 
important role of telomere and telomerase in vascular cell senescence in vitro. 
Progressive telomere shortening in vivo has been observed in the regions 
susceptible to atherosclerosis, implying contributions to atherogenesis. 
However, whether senescent vascular cells are present in the vasculature and 
contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis remains unclear.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) 
activity was examined in the coronary arteries and the internal mammary arteries 
retrieved from autopsied individuals who had had ischemic heart diseases. Strong 
beta-gal stainings were observed in atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary 
arteries but not in the internal mammary arteries. An immunohistochemical 
analysis using anti-factor VIII antibody demonstrated that beta-gal stained 
cells are vascular endothelial cells. To determine whether endothelial cell 
senescence causes endothelial dysfunction, we induced senescence in human aortic 
endothelial cells (HAECs) by inhibiting telomere function and examined the 
expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and endothelial nitric 
oxide synthase (eNOS) activity. Senescent HAECs exhibited increased ICAM-1 
expression and decreased eNOS activity, both of which are alterations implicated 
in atherogenesis. In contrast, introduction of telomerase catalytic component 
significantly extended the life span and inhibited the functional alterations 
associated with senescence in HAECs.
CONCLUSIONS: Vascular endothelial cells with senescence-associated phenotypes 
are present in human atherosclerotic lesions, and endothelial cell senescence 
induced by telomere shortening may contribute to atherogenesis.
