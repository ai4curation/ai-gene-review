Sulfolobus acidocaldarius is an aerobic thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon which 
grows optimally at 80 degrees C and pH 2 in terrestrial solfataric springs. 
Here, we describe the genome sequence of strain DSM639, which has been used for 
many seminal studies on archaeal and crenarchaeal biology. The circular genome 
carries 2,225,959 bp (37% G+C) with 2,292 predicted protein-encoding genes. Many 
of the smaller genes were identified for the first time on the basis of 
comparison of three Sulfolobus genome sequences. Of the protein-coding genes, 
305 are exclusive to S. acidocaldarius and 866 are specific to the Sulfolobus 
genus. Moreover, 82 genes for untranslated RNAs were identified and annotated. 
Owing to the probable absence of active autonomous and nonautonomous mobile 
elements, the genome stability and organization of S. acidocaldarius differ 
radically from those of Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus tokodaii. The S. 
acidocaldarius genome contains an integrated, and probably encaptured, pARN-type 
conjugative plasmid which may facilitate intercellular chromosomal gene exchange 
in S. acidocaldarius. Moreover, it contains genes for a characteristic 
restriction modification system, a UV damage excision repair system, thermopsin, 
and an aromatic ring dioxygenase, all of which are absent from genomes of other 
Sulfolobus species. However, it lacks genes for some of their sugar 
transporters, consistent with it growing on a more limited range of carbon 
sources. These results, together with the many newly identified protein-coding 
genes for Sulfolobus, are incorporated into a public Sulfolobus database which 
can be accessed at http://dac.molbio.ku.dk/dbs/Sulfolobus.
