## Abstract

1. J Biol Chem. 1998 Mar 20;273(12):6860-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.12.6860.

Grb10 interacts differentially with the insulin receptor, insulin-like growth 
factor I receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor via the Grb10 Src 
homology 2 (SH2) domain and a second novel domain located between the pleckstrin 
homology and SH2 domains.

The Grb10 protein appears to be an adapter protein of unknown function that has 
been implicated in insulin receptor (IR) signaling. The interaction of this 
protein with the IR has been shown to be mediated in part by the Src homology 2 
(SH2) domain of Grb10. Here we demonstrate the existence of a second novel 
domain within Grb10 that interacts with the IR and insulin-like growth factor 
receptor in a kinase-dependent manner. This domain was localized to a region of 
approximately 50 amino acids, and we term it the BPS domain to denote its 
location between the PH and SH2 domains. The BPS domain does not bear any 
obvious resemblance to other known protein interaction domains but is highly 
conserved among the Grb10-related proteins Grb7 and Grb14. We show that the BPS 
domain interaction is dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity. 
Furthermore, interaction of the BPS domain requires the kinase domain of the IR, 
since mutation of the paired tyrosine residues (Y1150F/Y1151F) within the IR 
activation loop dramatically reduced the interaction. Last, our data suggest 
that the presence of two distinct protein interaction domains may help to 
determine the specificity by which Grb10 interacts with different receptors. 
Specifically, the IR, which appears to interact most strongly with Grb10, 
interacts well with both the SH2 and BPS domains. Conversely, the insulin-like 
growth factor receptor and EGFR, which interact less avidly with Grb10, interact 
well only with the BPS domain or the SH2 domain, respectively. In summary, our 
findings demonstrate the existence of a previously unidentified tyrosine kinase 
activity-dependent binding domain located between the Pleckstrin homology and 
SH2 domains of Grb10.
