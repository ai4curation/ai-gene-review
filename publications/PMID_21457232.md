Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is one of the most severe congenital 
heart malformations, characterized by underdevelopment of the structures in the 
left heart-aorta complex. The majority of cases are sporadic. Although multiple 
genetic loci have been tentatively implicated in HLHS, no gene or pathway seems 
to be specifically associated with the disease. To elucidate the genetic basis 
of HLHS, we analyzed 53 well-characterized patients with isolated HLHS using an 
integrated genomic approach that combined DNA sequencing of five candidate genes 
(NKX2-5, NOTCH1, HAND1, FOXC2 and FOXL1) and genome-wide screening by 
high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization. In 30 patients, we 
identified two novel de novo mutations in NOTCH1, 23 rare patients inherited 
gene variants in NOTCH1, FOXC2 and FOXL1, and 33 rare patients mostly inherited 
copy-number variants. Some of the identified variations coexisted in the same 
patient. The biological significance of such rare variations is unknown, but our 
findings strengthen the role of NOTCH pathway in cardiac valve development, 
indicating that HLHS is, at least in part, a 'valve' disease. This is the first 
report of de novo mutations associated with isolated HLHS. Moreover, the 
coexistence of multiple rare variants suggests in some cases a cumulative 
effect, as shown for other complex disease.
