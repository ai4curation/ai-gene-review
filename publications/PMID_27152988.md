Potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing (KCTD) proteins are involved 
in fundamental physio-pathological processes. Here, we report an analysis of the 
oligomeric state of the Bric-à-brack, Tram-track, Broad complex (BTB) domains of 
seven distinct KCTDs belonging to five major clades of the family evolution 
tree. Despite their functional and sequence variability, present electron 
microscopy data highlight the occurrence of well-defined pentameric states for 
all domains. Our data also show that these states coexist with alternative forms 
which include open pentamers. Thermal denaturation analyses conducted using 
KCTD1 as a model suggest that, in these proteins, different domains cooperate to 
their overall stability. Finally, negative-stain electron micrographs of 
KCTD6(BTB) in complex with Cullin3 show the presence of assemblies with a 
five-pointed pinwheel shape.
