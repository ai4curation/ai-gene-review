Abstract

Although Niban is highly expressed in human cancer cells, the cellular functions of Niban remain largely unknown. We demonstrate here that ultraviolet irradiation induces phosphorylation of Niban at S602 by AKT, which increases the association of Niban with nucleophosmin and disassociation of nucleophosmin from the MDM2 complex. This leads to the promotion of MDM2–p53 interaction and subsequent p53 degradation, thereby providing an antiapoptotic effect. Conversely, depletion of or deficiency in Niban expression promotes stabilization of p53 with increased cell apoptosis. Our findings illustrate a pivotal role for AKT-mediated phosphorylation of Niban in protecting cells from genotoxic stress–induced cell apoptosis.

Introduction

The Niban gene, also known as family with sequence similarity 129, member A (FAM129A), consists of 14 exons located on human chromosome 1. Niban was originally identified from a rat with renal carcinoma having the TSC2 gene mutation [ 1 ]. Overexpression of Niban has been detected in patients with many types of cancer, including thyroid, head and neck, renal, and liver cancer. Niban is highly expressed in the early stages of cancer development and remains overexpressed throughout the cancer progression [ 2–5 ]. Niban is also upregulated in its mRNA and protein expression in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress and regulates protein translation machinery by modulating phosphorylation of eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2α, p70 ribosomal S6 subunit kinase 1, and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 [ 6 ]. However, how Niban executes its cellular functions and its exact role in cell survival and apoptosis remain largely unknown.

P53 has a key role in the regulation of cell-cycle progression and promotes apoptosis in response to multiple stress signals, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, metabolic stress, and deregulated oncogene activation [ 7–9 ]. In unstressed normal cells, p53 activity is maintained at low levels through a combination of p53 degradation and transcriptional restraint, which are primarily mediated by murine double minute 2 (MDM2) [ 10 ]. MDM2 regulates p53 activity through both ubiquitination-dependent p53 degradation and repression of p53 transcriptional activity [ 11 , 12 ]. Interestingly, the MDM2 gene in turn is transcriptionally activated by p53, constituting a feedback regulatory loop [ 13 ].

P53 stability and transcriptional activity can be regulated through control of its interaction with MDM2 by distinct mechanisms. ADP-ribosylation factor interferes with MDM2–p53 interaction, leading to stabilization and activation of p53 [ 12 ]. The other prominent regulator of MDM2 besides ADP-ribosylation factor is MDMX (also known as Mdm4). MDM2 and MDMX interact with each other through their C-terminal really interesting new gene (RING) domains, and MDMX promotes the E3-ligase activity of MDM2 for p53 degradation [ 12 ]. In addition, nucleophosmin (NPM)/B23, a nucleolar phosphoprotein that constantly shuttles between the nucleolus and cytoplasm, binds to human MDM2 and inhibits MDM2’s function through regulation of MDM2–p53 interaction, thereby stabilizing p53 and increasing its transcriptional activity [ 14 , 15 ]. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of NPM is unknown.

In the study reported herein, we demonstrated that ultraviolet irradiation results in phosphorylation of Niban at S602 by AKT, which promotes the association of Niban with NPM and inhibits the regulatory effect of NPM on p53–MDM2 complexes, thereby destabilizing p53 and inhibiting p53-dependent apoptosis.

Discussion

NPM is directly implicated in tumourigenesis and embryonic development [ 15 , 27 , 28 ]. NPM interacts with the MDM2–p53 complex, leading to stabilization of p53 [ 14 , 15 ]. Our findings revealed that Niban, which is overexpressed in many types of human cancer cells, is phosphorylated by AKT in response to ultraviolet irradiation. Phosphorylated Niban binds to NPM, thereby preventing NPM from binding to MDM2. The resulting increase in the amount of free MDM2 interacts with p53, leading to p53 polyubiquitination and degradation ( Fig 5 ). Thus, Niban functions as an antiapoptotic protein, having an instrumental role in cellular responses to extracellular stress through regulation of the interactions between NPM and MDM2, and association of MDM2 with p53, as well as promotion of p53 degradation.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and AKT are critical regulators of cell proliferation and survival [ 29 , 30 ]. AKT activation, which can be induced by activation of growth factor receptors or mutation of the tumour suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue, occurs in many types of cancer cells, where it transmits a potent proliferation and survival signal [ 29 ]. In response to extracellular stress signalling, such as that induced by chemotherapy and irradiation (including ultraviolet irradiation), AKT signalling can provide an antiapoptotic effect, thereby contributing to resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy [ 25 , 31 ]. AKT promotes cell survival by affecting several downstream targets, including regulation of components of the apoptotic machinery, such as Bad and caspase 9; phosphorylation of substrates that indirectly inhibit apoptosis, such as forkhead transcription family members; and progression of the cell cycle through cytoplasmic sequestration of p21 and stabilization of cyclin D [ 31 , 32 ]. In addition, AKT directly phosphorylates MDM2 and enhances MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53 [ 33 , 34 ]. We did not detect significantly changes in AKT-dependent phosphorylation of MDM2 in response to ultraviolet irradiation. Instead, our results revealed that activated AKT phosphorylates Niban, leading to abrogation of the inhibitory effect of NPM on MDM2-dependent p53 degradation. Regulation of Niban expression or its phosphorylation status is sufficient to alter p53 expression and cell apoptosis strongly suggesting that AKT-phosphorylated Niban has a pivotal role in ultraviolet irradiation–induced cell apoptosis.

Mutations and transcriptional abnormalities of p53 occur in a significant percentage of human cancers. For instance, loss of p53 transcriptional activity was found in 88% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas [ 35 ]. In contrast, ubiquitous expression of Niban was observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas compared with in normal tissue [ 3 ]. These findings suggest that Niban has p53-independent cellular activities in tumour development and that some types of cancer favour one survival pathway over another in a cell- and stress type-dependent manner.

AKT activation in response to both radiotherapy and chemotherapy has an important role in the resistance of cancer cells to these treatments [ 29 , 36 ]. Our results revealed a new mechanism, in which AKT contributes to resistance of cancer cells through Niban phosphorylation-promoted p53 degradation. Thus, a therapeutic approach targeting AKT-regulated and Niban-dependent p53 degradation might overcome therapy resistance of cancer cells with WT p53 expression.
