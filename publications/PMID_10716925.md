centrosome cycle in Drosophila and vertebrates.

To determine the molecular composition of the centrosome of a higher eukaryote, 
we carried out a systematic nano-electrospray tandem or MALDI mass spectrometry 
analysis of the polypeptides present in highly enriched preparations of 
immunoisolated Drosophila centrosomes. One of the proteins identified is Hsp83, 
a member of the highly conserved Hsp90 family including chaperones known to 
maintain the activity of many proteins but suspected to have other essential, 
unidentified functions. We have found that a fraction of the total Hsp90 pool is 
localized at the centrosome throughout the cell cycle at different stages of 
development in Drosophila and vertebrates. This association between Hsp90 and 
the centrosome can be observed in purified centrosomes and after treatment with 
microtubule depolymerizing drugs, two criteria normally used to define core 
centrosomal components. Disruption of Hsp90 function by mutations in the 
Drosophila gene or treatment of mammalian cells with the Hsp90 inhibitor 
geldanamycin, results in abnormal centrosome separation and maturation, aberrant 
spindles and impaired chromosome segregation. This suggests that another role of 
Hsp90 might be to ensure proper centrosome function.
