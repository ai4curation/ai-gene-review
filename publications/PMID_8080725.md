Recent studies have shown that the use of cytokines such as granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to ameliorate chemotherapy-induced 
myelosuppression may enhance the viability of tumour cells with functional 
receptors for these cytokines. In this study, therefore, we used murine bone 
marrow (BM) cells in an in vitro model in an attempt to determine whether 
topoisomerase inhibitors (camptothecin, etoposide and doxorubicin) induce 
myelosuppression (BM cell death) and whether novel treatments other than the 
administration of G-CSF can be used for rescue from myelosuppression. DNA 
fragmentation assay, ultrastructural analysis and cell cycle analysis 
demonstrated that these chemotherapeutic agents induced apoptosis in BM cells. 
We demonstrated in addition that enforced expression of the bcl-2 gene in BM 
cells by MPZenNeo (bcl-2) retroviral gene transfer increased resistance to the 
apoptosis induced by these agents. These findings suggest the possibility that 
enforced expression of the bcl-2 gene in BM cells using gene transfer techniques 
may enable rescue from chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression.
