Acid chaperones are essential factors in preserving the protein homeostasis for 
enteric pathogens to survive in the extremely acidic mammalian stomach (pH 1-3). 
The client proteins of these chaperones remain largely unknown, primarily 
because of the exceeding difficulty of determining protein-protein interactions 
under low-pH conditions. We developed a genetically encoded, highly efficient 
protein photocrosslinking probe, which enabled us to profile the in vivo 
substrates of a major acid-protection chaperone, HdeA, in Escherichia coli 
periplasm. Among the identified HdeA client proteins, the periplasmic chaperones 
DegP and SurA were initially found to be protected by HdeA at a low pH, but they 
subsequently facilitated the HdeA-mediated acid recovery of other client 
proteins. This unique, ATP-independent chaperone cooperation in the ATP-deprived 
E. coli periplasm may support the acid resistance of enteric bacteria. The 
crosslinker would be valuable in unveiling the physiological interaction 
partners of any given protein and thus their functions under normal and stress 
conditions.
