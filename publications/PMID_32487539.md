INTRODUCTION: TMEM16A is a calcium-activated chloride channel expressed in 
various secretory epithelia. Two siblings presented in early infancy with 
reduced intestinal peristalsis and recurrent episodes of haemorrhagic diarrhoea. 
In one of them, the episodes were characterised by hepatic pneumatosis with gas 
bubbles in the portal vein similar to necrotising enterocolitis of the newborn.
METHODS: Exome sequencing identified a homozygous truncating pathogenic variant 
in ANO1. Expression analysis was performed using reverse transcription PCR, 
western blot and immunohistochemistry. Electrophysiological and cell biological 
studies were employed to characterise the effects on ion transport both in 
patient respiratory epithelial cells and in transfected HEK293 cells.
RESULTS: The identified variant led to TMEM16A dysfunction, which resulted in 
abolished calcium-activated Cl- currents. Secondarily, CFTR function is affected 
due to the close interplay between both channels without inducing cystic 
fibrosis (CF).
CONCLUSION: TMEM16A deficiency is a potentially fatal disorder caused by 
abolished calcium-activated Cl- currents in secretory epithelia. Secondary 
impairment of CFTR function did not cause a CF phenotyp, which may have 
implications for CF treatment.
