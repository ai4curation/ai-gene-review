Human activating signal cointegrator 1 (hASC-1) was originally isolated as a 
transcriptional coactivator of nuclear receptors. Here we report that ASC-1 
exists as a steady-state complex associated with three polypeptides, P200, P100, 
and P50, in HeLa nuclei; stimulates transactivation by serum response factor 
(SRF), activating protein 1 (AP-1), and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) 
through direct binding to SRF, c-Jun, p50, and p65; and relieves the previously 
described transrepression between nuclear receptors and either AP-1 or 
NF-kappaB. Interestingly, ectopic expression of Caenorhabditis elegans ASC-1 
(ceASC-1), an ASC-1 homologue that binds P200 and P100, like hASC-1, while 
weakly interacting only with p65, in HeLa cells appears to replace endogenous 
hASC-1 from the hASC-1 complex and exerts potent dominant-negative effects on 
AP-1, NF-kappaB, and SRF transactivation. In addition, neutralization of 
endogenous P50 by single-cell microinjection of a P50 antibody inhibits AP-1 
transactivation; the inhibition is relieved by coexpression of wild-type P50, 
but not of P50DeltaKH, a mutant form that does not interact with P200. Overall, 
these results suggest that the endogenous hASC-1 complex appears to play an 
essential role in AP-1, SRF, and NF-kappaB transactivation and to mediate the 
transrepression between nuclear receptors and either AP-1 or NF-kappaB in vivo.
