The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor protein is important in the E3 
ubiquitin ligase ECV (Elongin B/C-CUL2-VHL)-mediated destruction of 
hypoxia-inducible factor and the promotion of fibronectin (FN) extracellular 
matrix assembly. Although the precise molecular mechanism controlling the 
selectivity of VHL function remains unknown, a failure in either process is 
associated with oncogenic progression. Here, we show that VHL performs its 
FN-associated function independently of the ECV complex, highlighting the 
autonomy of these pathways. Furthermore, we show that NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like 
molecule, acts as a 'molecular switch' in which its covalent conjugation to VHL 
prohibits the engagement of the scaffold component CUL2 and, concomitantly, 
activates the association with FN. These findings provide the first mechanistic 
step in defining the functional selectivity of VHL and explain a previously 
unrecognized function of NEDD8.

Abstract

The von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor protein is important in the E3 ubiquitin ligase ECV (Elongin B/C–CUL2–VHL)-mediated destruction of hypoxia-inducible factor and the promotion of fibronectin (FN) extracellular matrix assembly. Although the precise molecular mechanism controlling the selectivity of VHL function remains unknown, a failure in either process is associated with oncogenic progression. Here, we show that VHL performs its FN-associated function independently of the ECV complex, highlighting the autonomy of these pathways. Furthermore, we show that NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like molecule, acts as a ‘molecular switch' in which its covalent conjugation to VHL prohibits the engagement of the scaffold component CUL2 and, concomitantly, activates the association with FN. These findings provide the first mechanistic step in defining the functional selectivity of VHL and explain a previously unrecognized function of NEDD8.

Introduction

Inheritance of one faulty von Hippel–Lindau ( VHL ) allele is the cause of VHL disease, which is characterized by the development of retinal, cerebellar and spinal haemangioblastomas, phaeochromocytoma and renal clear-cell carcinoma (RCC; Kaelin, 2002 ). Tumorigenesis begins with the loss or inactivation of the remaining wild-type VHL allele in a susceptible cell ( Kaelin, 2002 ). Biallelic inactivation of the VHL locus is also responsible for the development of most of the sporadic RCC, establishing VHL as a crucial ‘gatekeeper' gene of the renal epithelium ( Kaelin, 2002 ).

The phenotypic variation observed in relatives that carry mutations in VHL (VHL kindred) are due to alterations in tissue-specific functions or in the severity with which certain VHL functions are altered. The two most well-characterized functions of VHL are as a negative regulator of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which is the main transcription factor that activates the expression of many hypoxia-inducible genes to counter the detrimental effects of compromised oxygen availability ( Kaelin, 2002 ), and as a positive regulator of fibronectin (FN) extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly ( Roberts & Ohh, 2008 ).

ECV (Elongin B/C–CUL2–VHL) is an SCF (SKP1/CDC53 or CUL1/F-box protein)-like E3 ubiquitin ligase in which VHL acts as a substrate-conferring component that recruits the α-subunits of HIF. These have been modified with hydroxyl groups on conserved prolyl residues within the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) by a class of prolyl hydroxylases in an oxygen-dependent manner ( Kaelin, 2002 ). This mechanistic insight explains why HIFα is stabilized under hypoxia to bind to constitutively expressed HIFβ (also known as aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) to form an active heterodimeric transcription factor. Concordantly, cells under hypoxia or tumour cells devoid of VHL irrespective of oxygen tension have enhanced expression of HIF target genes, such as VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), GLUT1 (glucose transporter 1) and EPO (erythropoietin; Roberts & Ohh, 2008 ). The overexpression of hypoxia-inducible genes probably contributes to the hypervascular nature of VHL disease-associated tumours, and supports the idea that constitutive stabilization of HIFα is a crucial oncogenic event following the loss of VHL ( Roberts & Ohh, 2008 ).

VHL also binds to FN and this physical interaction represents a requisite step in the promotion of correct ECM assembly ( Ohh et al , 1998 ). All tumour-causing VHL mutants tested so far show a striking failure in binding to and/or in the assembly of FN ( Clifford et al , 2001 ; Hoffman et al , 2001 ). Recently, VHL was also shown to interact with collagen IV (COLIV) to promote its deposition in the extracellular space ( Grosfeld et al , 2007 ; Kurban et al , 2008 ). These findings underscore the significance of VHL-mediated ECM assembly in tumour suppression. Kurban et al (2006) showed that the loss of correct FN ECM promotes angiogenesis of RCC xenograft in an HIF-independent manner and that HIFα stabilization in the context of intact FN ECM results in tumours with low microvessel density despite the overexpression of VEGF. Tang et al (2006) showed, in mice with conditional knockout of VHL in endothelial cells, that VHL has a crucial role in the vascular FN ECM assembly, independent of its role in regulating HIFα. In addition, studies of genomic clustering in Caenorhabditis elegans identified a discrete HIF-independent role of VHL in ECM function ( Bishop et al , 2004 ). Although these studies highlight the HIF-independent FN assembly function of VHL, the mechanism controlling the selectivity of VHL functions remained unknown.

Until recently, the ubiquitin-like molecule NEDD8 has been thought to conjugate exclusively to Cullins, in a manner analogous to ubiquitylation, to enhance the activity of SCF and ECV complexes ( Pan et al , 2004 ; Sufan & Ohh, 2006 ). Emerging evidence has shown NEDD8 to be more versatile in substrate specificity and, importantly, several proteins involved in oncogenesis, including VHL, p53, murine double minute 2 (MDM2), p73, epidermal growth factor receptor and the breast cancer-associated protein 3, have now been shown to be targets of NEDD8 modification ( Stickle et al , 2004 ; Xirodimas et al , 2004 ; Gao et al , 2006 ; Oved et al , 2006 ; Watson et al , 2006 ). In addition, the functional consequence of neddylation was found to be more diverse than previously thought, extending beyond the enhancement of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Here, we provide evidence that NEDD8 acts as a ‘molecular switch' in which its covalent conjugation to VHL precludes ECV formation by steric hindrance and, concomitantly, allows interaction with FN, thereby providing the first mechanistic step in the definition of the functional selectivity of VHL.
