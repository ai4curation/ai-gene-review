The tumor suppressor BRCA1 has an important function in the maintenance of 
genomic stability. Increasing evidence suggests that BRCA1 regulates cell cycle 
checkpoints and DNA repair after DNA damage. However, little is known about its 
normal function in the absence of DNA damage. Here we show that BRCA1 interacts 
and colocalizes with topoisomerase IIalpha in S phase cells. Similar to cells 
treated with the topoisomerase IIalpha inhibitor ICRF-193, BRCA1-deficient cells 
show lagging chromosomes, indicating a defect in DNA decatenation and chromosome 
segregation. More directly, BRCA1 deficiency results in defective DNA 
decatenation in vitro. Finally, topoisomerase IIalpha is ubiquitinated in a 
BRCA1-dependent manner, and topoisomerase IIalpha ubiquitination correlates with 
higher DNA decatenation activity. Together these results suggest an important 
role of BRCA1 in DNA decatenation and reveal a previously unknown function of 
BRCA1 in the maintenance of genomic stability.
