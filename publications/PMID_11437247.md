Two large Arabidopsis thaliana gene families are homologous to the Brassica gene 
superfamily that encodes pollen coat proteins and the male component of the 
self-incompatibility response.

The male component of the self-incompatibility response in Brassica has recently 
been shown to be encoded by the S locus cysteine-rich gene (SCR). SCR is 
related, at the sequence level, to the pollen coat protein (PCP) gene family 
whose members encode small, cysteine-rich proteins located in the proteo-lipidic 
surface layer (tryphine) of Brassica pollen grains. Here we show that the 
Arabidopsis genome includes two large gene families with homology to SCR and to 
the PCP gene family, respectively. These genes are poorly predicted by 
gene-identification algorithms and, with few exceptions, have been missed in 
previous annotations. Based on sequence comparison and an analysis of the 
expression patterns of several members of each family, we discuss the possible 
functions of these genes. In particular, we consider the possibility that 
SCR-related genes in Arabidopsis may encode ligands for the S gene family of 
receptor-like kinases in this species.
