Immunoglobulin A (IgA)-nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary renal 
glomerular disease in the world that has no effective treatment. High levels of 
circulating IgA-fibronectin (Fn) complexes, characteristically found in IgAN 
patients, are suggested to cause abnormal deposition of IgA and Fn in the renal 
glomeruli of these patients causing renal failure. We previously reported that 
binding of Fn to uteroglobin (UG), a multifunctional anti-inflammatory protein, 
inhibits Fn-IgA heteromerization. However, the specific site of Fn-UG 
interaction until now remained unidentified. We report here that UG interacts 
with the heparin-binding site of Fn and propose that small molecules competing 
for interaction with this site may reduce the level of circulating Fn-IgA 
complexes in IgAN.

Abstract

Immunoglobulin A (IgA)-nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary renal glomerular disease in the world that has no effective treatment. High levels of circulating IgA-fibronectin (Fn) complexes, characteristically found in IgAN patients, are suggested to cause abnormal deposition of IgA and Fn in the renal glomeruli of these patients causing renal failure. We previously reported that binding of Fn to uteroglobin (UG), a multifunctional anti-inflammatory protein, inhibits Fn-IgA heteromerization. However, the specific site of Fn-UG interaction until now remained unidentified. We report here that UG interacts with the heparin-binding site of Fn and propose that small molecules competing for interaction with this site may reduce the level of circulsating Fn-IgA complexes in IgAN.

1. Introduction

Uteroglobin (UG), also known as Clara cell 10 kDa (CC10) protein, is the founding member of a newly recognized superfamily of proteins called Secretoglobin ( 1 ). It is a steroid-inducible, multifunctional, secreted protein with potent anti-inflammatory and anti-chemotactic properties ( 2 ). We previously reported that UG-knockout (UG-KO) mice( 3 ) develop abnormal deposition of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and fibronectin (Fn) in the renal glomeruli, reminiscent of the pathologic finding characteristic of human IgA-nephropathy (IgAN)( 4 ). IgAN is worldwide the most common primary glomerular disease that has no effective treatment ( 5 ). It has been reported that in patients with IgAN high levels of circulating Fn-IgA complexes are found and these complexes are suggested to play critical roles in the abnormal deposition of IgA and Fn in the renal glomeruli leding to IgAN pathogenesis ( 6 ). Consistent with this finding, we uncovered that in the UG-KO mice serum levels of Fn-IgA complexes are also present ( 4 ). More importantly, we found that treatment of these mice with purified recombinant human UG (hUG) prevents abnormal glomerular deposition of Fn and IgA ( 4 ). However, the specific site of Fn on which UG interacts and the molecular mechanism(s) by which UG suppresses the formation of Fn-IgA heteromers remain unclear.

Fibronectin (Fn) is a large adhesive glycoprotein composed of two nearly identical subunits of 220 kDa ( reviewed in 7 , 8 ). Each of these subunits contains a series of functional binding domains on which several proteins have been reported to interact ( 9 ). Fn is essential for normal growth and development ( 10 ) and it plays critical roles in cell attachment, movement, wound healing and cancer ( for review see 11 ). Fn is detectable as a soluble glycoprotein in blood and other body fluids and an insoluble form constitutes a major extracellular matrix protein in tissues.

We previously reported that UG binds Fn and prevents abnormal glomerular deposition of Fn and IgA ( 4 ), a characteristic pathologic finding in human IgA-nephropathy (IgAN). We have also reported that UG binds Fn and most likely suppresses the formation of Fn-IgA heteromers (). However, the specific site on Fn with which UG interacts and prevents Fn-IgA heteromerizaton, until now, remained unclear. The identification of this site on Fn may yield valuable information for the development of small molecules that functionally mimic UG and prevent Fn-IgA heteromerization. Thus, this site may be a potential target for developing novel approaches to reduce the level of circulating Fn-IgA complexes in IgAN. Accordingly, we carried out experiments to identify and characterize the specific site(s) on Fn with which UG interacts forming Fn-UG heteromes.
