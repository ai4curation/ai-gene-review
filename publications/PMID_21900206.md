Cellular signal transduction is a complex process involving protein-protein 
interactions (PPIs) that transmit information. For example, signals from the 
plasma membrane may be transduced to transcription factors to regulate gene 
expression. To obtain a global view of cellular signaling and to predict 
potential signal modulators, we searched for protein interaction partners of 
more than 450 signaling-related proteins by means of automated yeast two-hybrid 
interaction mating. The resulting PPI network connected 1126 proteins through 
2626 PPIs. After expansion of this interaction map with publicly available PPI 
data, we generated a directed network resembling the signal transduction flow 
between proteins with a naïve Bayesian classifier. We exploited information on 
the shortest PPI paths from membrane receptors to transcription factors to 
predict input and output relationships between interacting proteins. Integration 
of directed PPI with time-resolved protein phosphorylation data revealed network 
structures that dynamically conveyed information from the activated epidermal 
growth factor and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (EGF/ERK) signaling 
cascade to directly associated proteins and more distant proteins in the 
network. From the model network, we predicted 18 previously unknown modulators 
of EGF/ERK signaling, which we validated in mammalian cell-based assays. This 
generic experimental and computational approach provides a framework for 
elucidating causal connections between signaling proteins and facilitates the 
identification of proteins that modulate the flow of information in signaling 
networks.
