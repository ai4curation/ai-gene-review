Abstract

Type I interferon (IFN) inhibits, by an unknown mechanism, the replication of human papillomaviruses (HPV), which are major human pathogens, Here, we present evidence that P56 (a protein), the expression of which is strongly induced by IFN, double-stranded RNA and viruses, mediates the anti-HPV effect of IFN. Ectopic expression of P56 inhibited HPV DNA replication and its ablation in IFN-treated cells alleviated the inhibitory effect of IFN on HPV DNA replication. Protein–protein interaction and mutational analyses established that the antiviral effect of P56 was mediated by its direct interaction with the DNA replication origin-binding protein E1 of several strains of HPV, through the tetratricopeptide repeat 2 in the N-terminal region of P56 and the C-terminal region of E1. In vivo , the interaction with P56, a cytoplasmic protein, caused translocation of E1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In vitro , recombinant P56, or a small fragment derived from it, inhibited the DNA helicase activity of E1 and E1-mediated HPV DNA replication. These observations delineate the molecular mechanism of IFN's antiviral action against HPV.

Introduction

The interferon (IFN) system is the first line of defence against virus infection in the vertebrates ( Stark et al , 1998 ; Sen, 2001 ). The system is designed to contain the spreading of virus infection not only by impairing virus replication but also by elimination of the infected cells through direct apoptosis or by the action of cells of the immune system ( Samuel, 2001 ). The infection itself triggers IFN synthesis and secretion. The secreted IFNs exert an effect on as yet uninfected cells and forearm them to combat with subsequent virus infection. The actions of IFNs extend to certain parasitic infection and malignant tumour. Consequently, IFNs are used clinically for managing specific types of malignancies. They are also used to treat chronic infections with hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses ( Lin and Keeffe, 2001 ) and to treat infections with herpes viruses and papillomaviruses ( Koromilas et al , 2001 ; Lin and Keeffe, 2001 ; Whitley, 2001 ).

The actual antiviral actions are carried out by the products of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which number in the hundreds ( Der et al , 1998 ). A subset of the ISGs, the viral stress-inducible genes (VSIGs), is also induced by double-stranded (ds) RNA, a common by-product of virus infection, and by other viral gene products ( Geiss et al , 2001 ; Grandvaux et al , 2002 ). Thus, several consequences of viral infection lead to the induction of a common set of genes ( Sen and Peters, 2007 ). Although the same cis-acting sequence, the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE), present in the promoters of these genes, receives signals from all inducers, the transcription factors responsible and their modes of activation are quite distinct. IFNs stimulate transcription of VSIG by activating the Jak–STAT pathway of signal transduction. The critical transcription factor used by IFNs to stimulate VSIG transcription is ISGF3, composed of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 ( Stark et al , 1998 ). In contrast, induction of the same genes by dsRNA or virus infection does not use the Jak–STAT pathway ( Elco et al , 2005 ). The critical transcription factor in this case is IRF-3, which is activated by signalling pathways triggered by different Toll-like receptors or cytoplasmic RNA helicases, RIG-I and Mda-5.

Although IFN's antiviral activities are well known, it has been difficult to delineate the underlying molecular basis of the observed block in replication of most viruses. Moreover, for no virus, a single IFN-induced protein can account for the entire antiviral effect; usually several such proteins inhibit distinct steps of virus replication. In this context, we have been studying the properties of P56, the product of the ISG56 ( IFIT1 ) gene, which is highly induced in response to IFN, dsRNA and many viruses ( Der et al , 1998 ; Geiss et al , 2001 ; Grandvaux et al , 2002 ). P56 belongs to a family of structurally related proteins that are induced by viral stresses. In humans, there are three other members, P60, P58 and P54 ( Sarkar and Sen, 2004 ). Most untreated cells do not express P56 at a detectable level, but viral and other stresses induce transcription of the ISG56 gene rapidly and strongly. All of these proteins contain multiple tetratricopeptide (TPR) motifs that are known to mediate protein–protein interactions through scaffolds formed among tandem TPR repeats ( Lamb et al , 1995 ). The exact sequences of TPRs are not highly conserved, but there are invariant residues present in same locations in all TPRs and their substitutions destroy the TPR structure. We have been investigating the functional properties of P56 and other proteins of this family ( Guo et al , 2000a ). Using yeast two-hybrid screens, we have identified several cellular proteins that interact with P56, the most well characterized of which is the Int-6 protein that is encoded by the Int-6 gene, whose disruption by the integration of the mouse mammary tumour virus genome, causes breast cancer in mice ( Marchetti et al , 1995 ); Int-6 is identical to the eIF-3e subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 ( Asano et al , 1997 ). The C-terminal region of P56 mediates its interaction with eIF-3e ( Guo and Sen, 2000 ) and causes an impairment of eIF-3 function and resultant inhibition of protein synthesis ( Guo et al , 2000a ). Other members of the P56 family can also interact with the ‘e' or the ‘c' subunit of eIF-3 and cause inhibition of translation initiation ( Guo et al , 2000a ; Hui et al , 2003 , 2005 ). The P56 families of proteins have been implicated in IFN's antiviral actions against HCV, West Nile virus and LCMV ( Wang et al , 2003 ; Wacher et al , 2007 ).

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) infect squamous epithelial cells and induce hyperproliferative lesions ( Howley and Lowy, 2001 ). The high-risk groups, such as HPV16, 18 or 31, are associated with anogenital cancer and the primary aetiological agent for cervical carcinoma ( zur Hausen, 1996 ). The low-risk groups, such as HPV6 or 11, cause genital warts ( Lowy et al , 1994 ; zur Hausen and de Villiers, 1994 ). HPV replication is tightly dependent on the state of terminal differentiation of the infected cells ( Dollard et al , 1992 ). For this reason, organotypic or raft cultures, instead of monolayer tissue cultures of dividing cells, need to be used for studying HPV replication in vitro ( Chow and Broker, 1997 ). Two viral proteins, E1 and E2, are required, along with many host factors, for HPV DNA replication that originates at the viral Ori sequence; Ori-containing viral DNA or plasmids can replicate episomally and this process can be studied either in cells expressing ectopic E1 and E2 or in cell-free systems containing these proteins ( Sverdrup and Khan, 1994 ). E1, a phosphoprotein that shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, has ATPase and DNA helicase activities ( Hughes and Romanos, 1993 ); E1 and E2, the two nuclear phosphoproteins, form heteromeric complexes with the Ori DNA ( Chen and Stenlund, 2002 ). IFNs have been found to be effective in treating genital warts, an HPV-associated disease ( Lowy and Howley, 2001 ). However, the underlying mechanism has been difficult to discern because of the paucity of good in vitro models. In an early study, Turek et al (1982) observed complete elimination of BPV genome on long-term IFN treatments of BPV-transformed mouse cells, which caused their reversion to a non-transformed phenotype. Khan et al (1993) observed IFN-mediated inhibition of keratinocyte transformation by HPV16 and Chang and Laimins (2001) observed that the basal level expression of ISGs is repressed by HPV31 gene products in proliferating cultures, causing delayed response to IFN. The same group found that long-term treatment with IFN causes growth arrest and apoptosis of HPV-positive squamous carcinoma cells and episomal HPV DNA was eliminated from the surviving cells ( Chang et al , 2002 ).

The current study delineates the molecular basis of IFN's actions against HPV replication. We observed, by yeast two-hybrid assays, that P56 interacted with HPV18 E1. Further experiments with human cells confirmed this interaction and allowed us to map the interacting domains. In a cell-based replication system, IFN pretreatment inhibited HPV DNA replication, an effect that was reversed by the ablation of P56 expression. In vitro , P56 bound to E1 directly and inhibited its DNA helicase activity, as well as its ability to support HPV DNA synthesis in a cell-free system. These results indicate that P56 is the major, if not the only, IFN-induced protein that is responsible for inhibiting HPV replication.

Discussion

HPV is a major human pathogen causing cancer and hyperproliferative lesions in epithelial cells ( Stanley et al , 2007 ). Although type I IFN has been used clinically to treat genital warts and other HPV-caused lesions, the underlying antiviral mechanism remained unclear; this study provides the first clear evidence of a specific IFN-induced protein blocking HPV DNA replication. It remains possible that other ISG products can interfere with other steps of HPV life cycle, but our results strongly indicate that P56 is the major component of the anti-HPV action of IFN. Such a direct functional correlation between one IFN-induced protein and a specific virus is rare in the IFN literature; usually several such proteins exert an effect at many steps of replication of a virus. Moreover, the biochemical mechanism of P56 action against HPV is clear and straightforward, which is hardly the case for other ISG products, except Mx, which strongly inhibits the replications of influenza and other related viruses ( Haller et al , 1998 ).

Our experimental results explain many observations in the literature reporting progressive losses of HPV episomal DNA on IFN treatment of virus-infected tissues or cells ( Turek et al , 1982 ; Herdman et al , 2006 ). Maintenance of episomal virus DNA in infected tissues can lead to genomic integration of the viral DNA, especially for high-risk HPV strains, causing neoplastic progression ( Pett and Coleman, 2007 ). In tissue culture, IFN treatment of cells harbouring bovine papillomavirus or HPV31 DNA episomes causes a gradual loss of the viral DNA, suggesting a specific mode of action of IFN against HPV and a rationale for treating non-cancerous HPV lesions in patients with IFNs ( Chang et al , 2002 ). The results presented here demonstrate that the underlying cause is an IFN-induced inhibition of HPV DNA replication, which is mediated by the interaction of P56 with E1, a viral protein that is essential for DNA replication.

Because of the paucity of human cell lines that are amenable to de novo HPV infection, it has been difficult to study different aspects of virus replication in the same cells and the effects of exogenous agents on them. To circumvent this problem, different parts of viral metabolism have been often studied in isolation and the assay, used here to examine HPV DNA replication, has been very useful to identify the Ori sequences and the E1 and E2 protein domains that are necessary for efficient DNA replication. Using this assay, we could demonstrate strong effects of type I IFN and TLR3 signalling on HPV DNA replication ( Figure 4 ). The assay condition itself did not cause any IFN synthesis ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) and exogenous IFN treatment did not cause any cell death or perturbation of cell cycle regulation that could account for the observed inhibition of viral DNA synthesis ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Manipulations of P56 expression strongly indicated that the inhibitory action was mediated by P56 ( Figure 5 ). Ectopic expression of P56 itself caused strong inhibition of viral DNA replication, although it was not as pronounced as in cells treated with IFN ( Figure 5E ). The levels of P56 expression in these experiments were comparable to those in cells treated with IFN, and the effects were not due to an inhibition of E1 synthesis ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). The latter consideration is important because P56 is known to cause translational inhibition ( Guo et al , 2000a ). The actions of the two mutants of P56, M2 P56 and P56 1–179, further confirmed that the antiviral effect of P56 is distinct. The first mutant was incapable of inhibiting DNA replication ( Figure 5E ) because it could not bind to E1 ( Supplementary Figure S2 ); although it inhibited protein synthesis as strongly as WtP56 ( Figure 3E ). On the other hand, the second mutant, P56 1–179 did not bind to eIF-3 or inhibit protein synthesis ( Guo and Sen, 2000 ), but it could still inhibit DNA replication by binding to E1 ( Figures 2 and 5E ). When P56 was artificially directed to the nucleus ( Figure 5F ), it could still inhibit DNA replication, indicating that the cytoplasmic translocation of E1 by WtP56 may not contribute much to the phenomenon. We can speculate several reasons for the observed incompleteness of the inhibition of DNA replication by ectopically expressed P56. It is possible that in IFN-treated cells, P56 works in conjunction with another IFN-induced protein or that it is modified by IFN treatment to a more potent form; however, given our in vitro results these are unlikely explanations. The more likely explanation is that P56 is the major, but not the only, IFN-induced protein that inhibits HPV DNA replication. Ablation of P56 expression in IFN-treated cells solidified our conclusions further. Although, P56 expression was only partially ablated ( Figure 5A and C ), there was substantial alleviation of the inhibition of DNA replication in IFN-treated cells.

The in vitro analysis of the action of P56 on E1 functions produced unequivocal results confirming its strong inhibitory effects. New HPV DNA synthesis was inhibited by recombinant P56, expressed in either bacteria or insect cells, in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 6B ) and the inhibition was observed only with full-length P56 or a fragment that bound to E1, but not with the corresponding mutants that did not bind to E1 ( Figure 6 ). The same was true for the DNA helicase activity of E1 ( Figure 7 ). Surprisingly, another activity of E1, the ATPase activity, was not affected by P56 at all ( Figure 7C ). The latter result demonstrated that the effect of P56 on E1 was selective, thus reassuring that it was not causing gross distortions of the E1 structure. Future studies should analyse detailed steps of the E1 helicase activity and identify the one that is inhibited by P56. For example, P56 may affect E1 oligomerization, DNA binding or the helicase activity itself ( Sedman et al , 1997 ; Sun et al , 1998 ; Schuck and Stenlund, 2005 ).

The detailed analysis of P56–E1 interactions provided important information. The P56–E1 interaction is direct, the two purified recombinant proteins bound to each other ( Figure 1D ). It is also specific, other members of the human P56 family did not interact with E1 ( Figure 1C ). On the other hand, P56 recognizes E1 from many strains of HPV E1; we tested HPV18, HPV11 and HPV31 E1 and P56 interacted with and inhibited functions of all of them. It is the extreme N-terminal region of P56, between residues 29 and 152, which interacted with E1. This region contains three TPR motifs ( Sarkar and Sen, 2004 ), of which TPR2 is the most critical ( Figure 3A ); substitution of three residues, in TPR2, which is known to perturb the TPR structure ( Lamb et al , 1995 ), eliminated E1 interaction. On the other hand, similar mutations in TPR1 and TPR3 or both did not block E1 interaction ( Figure 3B ). Results from the co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays were corroborated by immunofluorescence results demonstrating cytoplasmic translocation of E1 on its interaction with P56 ( Figure 3C ).

The reciprocal mapping of the E1 domain that interacted with P56 was less complete. The original yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that it was the C-terminal region of E1, containing residues 360–657, that interacted with P56. This conclusion was confirmed by their co-immunoprecipitation from mammalian cell extracts. However, further deletions, from either end, eliminated P56 interaction. Future analysis should introduce internal mutations to alter specific structural and functional motifs present in this region of E1. This region is required for the ATPase and the helicase activities of E1 but not for its DNA binding or nuclear localization ( White et al , 2001 ); the three-dimensional structure of most of this region is known ( Abbate et al , 2004 ; Auster and Joshua-Tor, 2004 ). It is interesting to note that binding of P56 to this region blocked one enzymatic function of E1 (helicase), but not the other (ATPase). Moreover, the same binding caused the over-riding function of the nuclear localization signals present in the N-terminal region of the protein ( Deng et al , 2004 ). Future structural analysis of a complex between the P56 N-terminal region with E1 will be illuminating in explaining the observed functional consequences.

Our results demonstrated two general modes of action of P56 on E1 functions. In cells, P56 binding caused cytoplasmic translocation of E1, thus removing it from its site of action in the nucleus. In vitro , direct binding of the two proteins impaired the helicase activity of E1 and hence its ability to support DNA replication in vitro . Our experiment with the NLSP56 mutant indicates that the functional inhibition observed in vitro was also the primary mechanism in vivo . In an infected cell, either effect should cause inhibition of HPV episomal DNA replication and hence, with progressive cell divisions, dilution and eventual loss of the viral DNA. Although in most cases such a loss of HPV episomal DNA should be beneficial to the host, a recent report indicates that the effect may not be so predictable ( Herdman et al , 2006 ). In this study, the authors used HPV16-infected cervical keratinocytes to examine the fate of viral DNA after IFN treatment. They observed that such treatments enriched the population with cells in which the viral DNA was integrated, an effect with undesirable clinical consequences. It will be interesting to examine whether ectopic expression of P56, in the absence of hundreds of other IFN-induced proteins, will have the same effect. Because cell delivery of peptides is highly efficient, it will be worthwhile to derive an E1-binding peptide from the N-terminal region of P56 that can block the actions of E1. Such a peptide may be a better antiviral agent than IFN because of its targeted action avoiding the undesirable side effects of IFN treatment.
