The gamma-secretase complex, composed by presenilin, nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2, 
is involved in intramembranous proteolysis of membrane proteins, such as amyloid 
precursor protein or Notch. Cleavage occurs in multiple cellular compartments. 
Here, nicastrin mutants containing targeting signals to the endoplasmic 
reticulum, trans-Golgi network, lysosomes, or plasma membrane have been shown to 
yield active gamma-secretase complexes with different activities and 
specificities: wild-type and plasma membrane nicastrin complexes yielded the 
highest amounts of secreted amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), predominantly Abeta40, 
whereas intracellular targeted mutants produced intracellular Abeta, with a 
comparatively higher amount of Abeta42. These results suggest that compartmental 
microenvironments play a role in gamma-secretase activity and specificity.
