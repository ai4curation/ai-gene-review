E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and signaling plays an essential role in 
development and maintenance of healthy epithelial tissues. Adhesiveness mediated 
by E-cadherin is conferred by its extracellular cadherin domains and is 
regulated by an assembly of intracellular adaptors and enzymes associated with 
its cytoplasmic tail. We used proximity biotinylation and quantitative 
proteomics to identify 561 proteins in the vicinity of the cytoplasmic tail of 
E-cadherin. In addition, we used proteomics to identify proteins associated with 
E-cadherin-containing adhesion plaques from a cell-glass interface, which 
enabled the assignment of cellular localization to putative 
E-cadherin-interacting proteins. Moreover, by tagging identified proteins with 
GFP (green fluorescent protein), we determined the subcellular localization of 
83 putative E-cadherin-proximal proteins and identified 24 proteins that were 
previously uncharacterized as part of adherens junctions. We constructed and 
characterized a comprehensive E-cadherin interaction network of 79 published and 
394 previously uncharacterized proteins using a structure-informed database of 
protein-protein interactions. Finally, we found that calcium chelation, which 
disrupts the interaction of the extracellular E-cadherin domains, did not 
disrupt most intracellular protein interactions with E-cadherin, suggesting that 
the E-cadherin intracellular interactome is predominantly independent of 
cell-cell adhesion.

E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and signaling plays an essential role in development and maintenance of healthy epithelial tissues. Adhesiveness is conferred by cadherin extracellular domains, and is regulated by an assembly of adaptors and enzymes associated with the cytoplasmic tail. Here, we employed proximity biotinylation and quantitative proteomics to isolate and identify 612 proteins in the vicinity of E-cadherin’s cytoplasmic tail. We used a structure-informed database of protein-protein interactions to construct the most comprehensive E-cadherin interactome to date, containing 89 known E-cadhesome components and 346 novel proteins. Moreover, through cloning and expression of GFP-tagged fusion proteins we localized 26 of the novel proteins to adherens junctions. Finally, employing calcium depletion and myosin inhibition we show the E-cadherin interactome to be remarkably robust to perturbation and essentially independent of cell-cell junctions or actomyosin contractility.
