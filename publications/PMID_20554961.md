T helper 2 cells regulate inflammatory responses to helminth infections while 
also mediating pathological processes of asthma and allergy. IL-4 promotes Th2 
development by inducing the expression of the GATA3 transcription factor, and 
the Th2 phenotype is stabilized by a GATA3-dependent autoregulatory loop. In 
this study, we found that type I IFN (IFN-alpha/beta) blocked human Th2 
development and inhibited cytokine secretion from committed Th2 cells. This 
negative regulatory pathway was operative in human but not mouse CD4(+) T cells 
and was selective to type I IFN, as neither IFN-gamma nor IL-12 mediated such 
inhibition. IFN-alpha/beta blocked Th2 cytokine secretion through the inhibition 
of GATA3 during Th2 development and in fully committed Th2 cells. Ectopic 
expression of GATA3 via retrovirus did not overcome IFN-alpha/beta-mediated 
inhibition of Th2 commitment. Thus, we demonstrate a novel role for 
IFN-alpha/beta in blocking Th2 cells, suggesting its potential as a promising 
therapy for atopy and asthma.

Abstract

Th2 cells regulate inflammatory responses to helminth infections while also mediating pathological processes of asthma and allergy. IL-4 promotes Th2 development by inducing the expression of the GATA3 transcription factor, and the Th2 phenotype is stabilized by a GATA3-dependent auto-regulatory loop. In this study, we found that type I interferon (IFN-α/β) blocked human Th2 development and inhibited cytokine secretion from committed Th2 cells. This negative regulatory pathway was operative in human but not mouse CD4 + T cells and was selective to type I interferon as neither IFN-γ nor IL-12 mediated such inhibition. IFN-α/β blocked Th2 cytokine secretion through the inhibition of GATA3 during Th2 development and in fully committed Th2 cells. Ectopic expression of GATA3 via retrovirus did not overcome IFN-α/β-mediated inhibition of Th2 commitment. Thus, we demonstrate a novel role for IFN-α/β in blocking Th2 cells, suggesting its potential as a promising therapy for atopy and asthma.

Introduction

CD4 + Th2 cells regulate both humoral and cell-mediated inflammatory responses to helminth pathogens as well as toxins and other foreign soluble molecules ( 1 ). In genetically predisposed individuals, Th2 cells also mediate atopic responses to normally innocuous materials such as animal dander, pollens, and pollutants. Th2 cells mediate these processes through the selective secretion of a subset of cytokines that include IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and in some cases IL-9 and IL-10 ( 2 ). Together, these cytokines lead to a cascade of events that culminate in driving inflammation at sites of allergen contact, such as the lungs in cases of allergic asthma.

Various signals contribute to a “Th2 environment” such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), OX40L, Notch ( 3 ), and IL-25 ( 4 ); however, IL-4 remains the key signal that directly drives Th2 commitment. IL-4 receptor signaling promotes STAT6 recruitment and phosphorylation ( 5 ), which ultimately regulates induction of GATA3 transcription ( 6 ). GATA3 is a member of the 2-zinc finger GATA-binding family of transcription factors, and its expression is critical for both T cell thymic development and Th2 commitment ( 7 ). Once induced by IL-4, the GATA3 protein positively regulates Th2 cytokine gene expression and negatively regulates various aspects of Th1 commitment such as inhibiting the expression of the IL-12Rβ2 subunit ( 8 ). Further, GATA3 positively regulates its own expression through an auto-activation loop, thereby maintaining Th2 stability in the absence of further IL-4 signaling ( 9 , 10 ). The inherent stability of Th2 cells poses a significant challenge to treating allergic diseases. However, in this study, we have found that type I interferon (IFN-α/β) potently inhibits IL-4-driven Th2 commitment in human CD4+ T cells and destabilizes the Th2 phenotype by inhibiting GATA3 expression. Considering that IFN-α/β is used routinely to treat various diseases including multiple sclerosis and hepatitis C, we propose that IFN-α/β may represent a novel and readily available therapy for atopic conditions such as allergic asthma.
