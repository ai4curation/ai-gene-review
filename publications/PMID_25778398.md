Fbxl7, a component of the Skp1·Cul1·F-box protein type ubiquitin E3 ligase, 
regulates mitotic cell cycle progression. Here we demonstrate that 
overexpression of Fbxl7 in lung epithelia decreases the protein abundance of 
survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family. Fbxl7 mediates 
polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of survivin by interacting with 
Glu-126 within its carboxyl-terminal α helix. Furthermore, both Lys-90 and 
Lys-91 within survivin serve as ubiquitin acceptor sites. Ectopically expressed 
Fbxl7 impairs mitochondrial function, whereas depletion of Fbxl7 protects 
mitochondria from actions of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, an 
inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation. Compared with wild-type survivin, 
cellular expression of a survivin mutant protein deficient in its ability to 
interact with Fbxl7 (E126A) and a ubiquitylation-resistant double point mutant 
(KK90RR/KK91RR) rescued mitochondria to a larger extent from damage induced by 
overexpression of Fbxl7. Therefore, these data suggest that the Skp1·Cul1·F-box 
protein complex subunit Fbxl7 modulates mitochondrial function by controlling 
the cellular abundance of survivin. The results raise opportunities for F-box 
protein targeting to preserve mitochondrial function.
