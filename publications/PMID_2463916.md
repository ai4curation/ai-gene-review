GTP cyclohydrolase I, the first enzyme in the de novo biosynthesis of 
tetrahydrobiopterin, was enriched more than 13,000-fold from human liver by 
preparative isoelectric focusing using Sephadex G-200 SF gels. The pI of the 
active enzyme was determined as 5.6 by analytical isoelectric focusing in the 
same matrix. The native enzyme has an apparent molecular mass of 440 kDa and 
appears to be composed of eight 50-kDa subunits as estimated from SDS/PAGE. The 
enriched enzyme preparation was used to produce specific monoclonal antibodies. 
From 11 monoclonal antibodies obtained, one was extensively characterized for 
further applications. This monoclonal antibody belongs to the IgM class and 
shows immunoreactivity with GTP cyclohydrolase I both from man and from 
Escherichia coli. It is capable of highly sensitive detection of GTP 
cyclohydrolase I by ELISA and by Western blot analysis. The monoclonal antibody 
was used for the immunoenzymatic localisation of GTP cyclohydrolase I in human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, it was possible to demonstrate 
the absence of immunoreactivity in cells with GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency. 
The antibody's use as a tool either for differential diagnosis of atypical 
phenylketonuria due to GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency or prenatal diagnosis of 
this severe inherited metabolic disease is now under investigation.
