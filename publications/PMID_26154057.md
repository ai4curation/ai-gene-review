FOXO family transcription factors are downstream effectors of Insulin/IGF-1 
signaling (IIS) and major determinants of aging in organisms ranging from worms 
to man. The molecular mechanisms that actively promote DAF16/FOXO stability and 
function are unknown. Here we identify the deubiquitylating enzyme MATH-33 as an 
essential DAF-16 regulator in IIS, which stabilizes active DAF-16 protein levels 
and, as a consequence, influences DAF-16 functions, such as metabolism, stress 
response, and longevity in C. elegans. MATH-33 associates with DAF-16 in cellulo 
and in vitro. MATH-33 functions as a deubiquitylase by actively removing 
ubiquitin moieties from DAF-16, thus counteracting the action of the RLE-1 
E3-ubiquitin ligase. Our findings support a model in which MATH-33 promotes 
DAF-16 stability in response to decreased IIS by directly modulating its 
ubiquitylation state, suggesting that regulated oscillations in the stability of 
DAF-16 protein play an integral role in controlling processes such as metabolism 
and longevity.
