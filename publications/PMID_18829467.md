FGF19 subfamily proteins (FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23) are unique members of 
fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) that regulate energy, bile acid, glucose, 
lipid, phosphate, and vitamin D homeostasis in an endocrine fashion. Their 
activities require the presence of alpha or betaKlotho, two related single-pass 
transmembrane proteins, as co-receptors in relevant target tissues. We 
previously showed that FGF19 can bind to both alpha and betaKlotho, whereas 
FGF21 and FGF23 can bind only to either betaKlotho or alphaKlotho, respectively 
in vitro. To determine the mechanism regulating the binding and specificity 
among FGF19 subfamily members to Klotho family proteins, chimeric proteins 
between FGF19 subfamily members or chimeric proteins between Klotho family 
members were constructed to probe the interaction between those two families. 
Our results showed that a chimera of FGF19 with the FGF21 C-terminal tail 
interacts only with betaKlotho and a chimera with the FGF23 C-terminal tail 
interacts only with alphaKlotho. FGF signaling assays also reflected the change 
of specificity we observed for the chimeras. These results identified the 
C-terminal tail of FGF19 as a region necessary for its recognition of Klotho 
family proteins. In addition, chimeras between alpha and betaKlotho were also 
generated to probe the regions in Klotho proteins that are important for 
signaling by this FGF subfamily. Both FGF23 and FGF21 require intact alpha or 
betaKlotho for signaling, respectively, whereas FGF19 can signal through a 
Klotho chimera consisting of the N terminus of alphaKlotho and the C terminus of 
betaKlotho. Our results provide the first glimpse of the regions that regulate 
the binding specificity between this unique family of FGFs and their 
co-receptors.
