The centrosome plays a pivotal role in a wide range of cellular processes and 
its dysfunction is causally linked to many human diseases including cancer and 
developmental and neurological disorders. This organelle contains more than one 
hundred components, and yet many of them remain uncharacterised. Here we 
identified a novel centrosome protein Wdr8, based upon the structural 
conservation of the fission yeast counterpart. We showed that Wdr8 
constitutively localises to the centrosome and super resolution microscopy 
uncovered that this protein is enriched at the proximal end of the mother 
centriole. Furthermore, we identified hMsd1/SSX2IP, a conserved spindle 
anchoring protein, as one of Wdr8 interactors by mass spectrometry. Wdr8 formed 
a complex and partially colocalised with hMsd1/SSX2IP. Intriguingly, knockdown 
of Wdr8 or hMsd1/SSX2IP displayed very similar mitotic defects, in which spindle 
microtubules became shortened and misoriented. Indeed, Wdr8 depletion resulted 
in the reduced recruitment of hMsd1/SSX2IP to the mitotic centrosome, though the 
converse is not true. Together, we propose that the conserved Wdr8-hMsd1/SSX2IP 
complex plays a critical role in controlling proper spindle length and 
orientation.
