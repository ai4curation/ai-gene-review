Acid-sensing ion channels have important functions in physiology and pathology, 
but the molecular composition of acid-activated chloride channels had remained 
unclear. We now used a genome-wide siRNA screen to molecularly identify the 
widely expressed acid-sensitive outwardly-rectifying anion channel PAORAC/ASOR. 
ASOR is formed by TMEM206 proteins which display two transmembrane domains (TMs) 
and are expressed at the plasma membrane. Ion permeation-changing mutations 
along the length of TM2 and at the end of TM1 suggest that these segments line 
ASOR's pore. While not belonging to a gene family, TMEM206 has orthologs in 
probably all vertebrates. Currents from evolutionarily distant orthologs share 
activation by protons, a feature essential for ASOR's role in acid-induced cell 
death. TMEM206 defines a novel class of ion channels. Its identification will 
help to understand its physiological roles and the diverse ways by which 
anion-selective pores can be formed.
