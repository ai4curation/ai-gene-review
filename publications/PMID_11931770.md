Negative selection eliminates thymocytes bearing autoreactive T cell receptors 
(TCR) via an apoptotic mechanism. We have cloned an inhibitor of NF-kappa B, I 
kappa BNS, which is rapidly expressed upon TCR-triggered but not dexamethasone- 
or gamma irradiation-stimulated thymocyte death. The predicted protein contains 
seven ankyrin repeats and is homologous to I kappa B family members. In class I 
and class II MHC-restricted TCR transgenic mice, transcription of I kappa BNS is 
stimulated by peptides that trigger negative selection but not by those inducing 
positive selection (i.e., survival) or nonselecting peptides. I kappa BNS blocks 
transcription from NF-kappa B reporters, alters NF-kappa B electrophoretic 
mobility shifts, and interacts with NF-kappa B proteins in thymic nuclear 
lysates following TCR stimulation. Retroviral transduction of I kappa BNS in 
fetal thymic organ culture enhances TCR-triggered cell death consistent with its 
function in selection.
