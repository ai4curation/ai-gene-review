PG-Lb is a small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan that has been previously 
characterized in chicken. In the developing limb, chick PG-Lb appears to be 
exclusively expressed in the zone of flattened chondrocytes. We have cloned and 
sequenced the human homolog to chick PG-Lb from two human chondrocyte cDNA 
libraries and a human chondrocyte RNA sample. The human homolog has been named 
DSPG3, as it is the third member of the small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan 
family to be identified and characterized along with biglycan (PG-I) and decorin 
(PG-II). DSPG3 maps to chromosome 12q21 and is composed of 1515 nucleotides of 
cDNA that code for a 322-amino-acid protein. The protein contains three 
potential glycosaminoglycan attachment sites, two N-glycosylation sites, a poly- 
glutamic acid stretch, and six cysteines. By Northern analysis, we have 
demonstrated that DSPG3 is expressed in cartilage, as well as ligament and 
placental tissues.
