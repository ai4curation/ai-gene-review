ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 7 (ABCB7) is localized in the inner 
membrane of mitochondria, playing a critical role in iron metabolism. Here, we 
determined the structure of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog 
adenosine-5'-(β-γ-imido) triphosphate (AMP-PNP) bound human ABCB7 at 3.3 Å by 
single-particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). The AMP-PNP-bound human 
ABCB7 shows an inverted V-shaped homodimeric architecture with an inward-facing 
open conformation. One AMP-PNP molecule and Mg2+ were identified in each 
nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of the hABCB7 monomer. Moreover, four 
disease-causing missense mutations of human ABCB7 have been mapped to the 
structure, creating a hotspot map for X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia 
disease. Our results provide a structural basis for further understanding the 
transport mechanism of the mitochondrial ABC transporter.
