The PML tumor suppressor gene is consistently disrupted by t(15;17) in patients 
with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is a 
multifunctional protein that plays essential roles in cell growth regulation, 
apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and genome stability. Our study here 
shows that PML colocalizes and associates in vivo with the DNA damage response 
protein TopBP1 in response to ionizing radiation (IR). Both PML and TopBP1 
colocalized with the IR-induced bromodeoxyuridine single-stranded DNA foci. PML 
and TopBP1 also colocalized with Rad50, Brca1, ATM, Rad9, and BLM. IR and 
interferon (IFN) coinduce the expression levels of both TopBP1 and PML. In 
PML-deficient NB4 cells, TopBP1 was unable to form IR-induced foci. 
All-trans-retinoic acid induced reorganization of the PML nuclear body (NB) and 
reappearance of the IR-induced TopBP1 foci. Inhibition of PML expression by 
siRNA is associated with a significant decreased in TopBP1 expression. 
Furthermore, PML-deficient cells express a low level of TopBP1, and its 
expression cannot be induced by IR or IFN. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of 
PML in PML(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts substantially increased TopBP1 
expression, which colocalized with the PML NBs. These studies demonstrated a 
mechanism of PML-dependent expression of TopBP1. PML overexpression induced 
TopBP1 protein but not the mRNA expression. Pulse-chase labeling analysis 
demonstrated that PML overexpression stabilized the TopBP1 protein, suggesting 
that PML plays a role in regulating the stability of TopBP1 in response to IR. 
Together, our findings demonstrate that PML regulates TopBP1 functions by 
association and stabilization of the protein in response to IR-induced DNA 
damage.
