The exact role of the central acidic domain of Mdm2 in p53 degradation remains 
unclear. We therefore performed a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the 
acidic domain using a series of short deletions and found that only a minor part 
of the domain was indispensable for Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitylation. Moreover, 
we identified a short stretch of acidic amino acids required for p53 degradation 
but not ubiquitylation, indicating that, in addition to p53 ubiquitylation, the 
acidic domain might be involved in a critical post-ubiquitylation step in p53 
degradation. Rather than representing a single functional domain, different 
parts of the acidic region perform separate functions in p53 degradation, 
suggesting that it might be possible to therapeutically target them 
independently.
