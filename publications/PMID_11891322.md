Myc is a transcriptional regulator of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper

Abstract

Myc is a transcriptional regulator of the basic helix–loop–helix leucine zipper protein family. It has strong oncogenic potential, mutated or virally transduced forms of Myc induce lymphoid tumors in animals, and deregulated expression of Myc is associated with numerous types of human cancers. For its oncogenic activity, Myc must dimerize with the ubiquitously expressed basic helix–loop–helix leucine zipper protein Max. This requirement for dimerization may allow control of Myc activity with small molecules that interfere with Myc/Max dimerization. We have measured Myc/Max dimerization with fluorescence resonance energy transfer and have screened combinatorial chemical libraries for inhibitors of dimerization. Candidate inhibitors were isolated from a peptidomimetics library. Inhibition of Myc/Max interaction was validated by ELISA and electrophoretic mobility-shift assay. Two of the candidate inhibitors also interfere with Myc-induced oncogenic transformation in chicken embryo fibroblast cultures. Our work provides proof of principle for the identification of small molecule inhibitors of protein–protein interactions by using high-throughput screens of combinatorial chemical libraries.

Discussion

The structure of the Max/Max homodimer complexed to DNA has been determined ( 32 , 33 ) and shows the importance of the helix–loop–helix and the leucine zipper domains in dimerization. The bHLHZip domain of each monomer extends for 65 aa and consists of two α-helical segments, one encompassing the basic region and helix 1, the other one composed of helix 2 and the coiled-coil leucine zipper. The two segments are linked by a loop. The basic region contacts the major groove of DNA and introduces a bend of about 25°. The structure of the Myc/Max heterodimer has not yet been determined but probably shares basic properties with the Max/Max homodimer. Heterodimers consisting of the leucine zippers of Myc and Max are less stable than homodimers and heterodimers formed of Jun and Fos or GCN4 ( 34 – 36 ). Although dimerization of Myc and Max is also mediated by the helix–loop–helix domains, it is conceivable that the intrinsic instability of the Myc/Max leucine zipper facilitated the identification of small molecules that interfere with dimerization. The discovery of such inhibitors contradicts the widely shared assumption that large protein interfaces are unlikely to be disturbed by small molecules. However, some recent observations suggest that at least in certain instances, only a minor part of the protein dimer interfaces contributes to the affinity between the proteins ( 37 – 40 ). Targeting these “hot spots” may be sufficient for inhibiting protein–protein interactions. Known inhibitors of protein–protein interactions are either designed peptides derived from the sequence of one of the dimerization partners or small organic molecules found in specific screens ( 41 ). For example, HIV protease is catalytically active only as a homodimer and can be inhibited by breaking up the dimeric structure. A tetrapeptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of the protease inhibits the enzyme with a K i of 45 μM through a dissociative mechanism ( 42 ). The natural product Didemnaketal A from Ascidian didemnum sp. and a synthetic analogue inhibit dimerization of the HIV protease with an IC 50 of 2.1 μM ( 43 ). The heterodimeric herpes virus ribonucleotide reductase is inhibited with an IC 50 of 0.3 nM by a peptidomimetic derived from a subunit of the enzyme ( 44 ).

The molecular mechanism by which the inhibitors interfere with Myc/Max dimerization is not known. We assume that they bind to a site in either the helix–loop–helix domain or the leucine zipper of either Myc or Max, but the exact docking target remains to be determined. It will be interesting to determine whether the inhibitors also interfere with Max homodimerization. It is reasonable to assume that the inhibition of Myc/Max dimerization results in the observed reduction in oncogenic transformation. However, the available data are insufficient to prove this assumption. Additional work is required to elucidate the mechanism of focus inhibition. The effective concentrations of the candidate inhibitors are still high, but these are first-generation compounds, and libraries of derivatives based on these candidates are being prepared. Complete inhibition of Myc/Max dimerization may be difficult to achieve, and it may not be desirable, considering the normal function of the Myc protein. Partial inhibition may be more easily obtainable, is biologically more desirable, and may be effective in neutralizing Myc gain of function.

The inhibition of oncogenic transformation by the candidate molecules is not entirely specific and also extends to Jun. Absent any knowledge on the mechanisms of the antioncogenic effect for Myc, one can only speculate about this broader range of activity. One possibility is that the small molecule inhibitors target leucine zippers in general that are found in Myc and Jun. Myc is a component of a network that regulates transcription by switching dimerization partners ( 23 , 45 ). In this network, there are several points at which control of dimerization could have an effect on transcriptional activity. For instance, whereas Myc does not form homodimers, Max readily does so, and stabilizing these homodimers with small molecules could reduce availability of Max for dimerization with Myc. Screens for such stabilizers could be set up in analogous fashion to the FRET assays used in the current experiments.

The ultimate goal of this research is to counteract the oncogenic activity of Myc. Because cancer cells harbor multiple genetic changes, control of a single oncoprotein may not be sufficient to induce reversion of the neoplastic phenotype. However, at least some tumors induced by Myc show long-term dependence on increased Myc function and regress when Myc is deactivated ( 15 , 46 ). In human cancer cells with several mutations, compensation for one of the oncogenic changes is also sufficient to induce reversion to a nonmalignant phenotype ( 47 ).

Our work provides proof of principle for the inhibition of protein–protein interactions between bHLHZip proteins by small molecules. We have demonstrated that a high-throughput screen for inhibitors of Myc/Max interactions in vitro can identify small nonpeptidic molecules that interfere with c-Myc-induced transformation of CEF. The extension of this approach using derivative chemical libraries could result in the identification of more potent inhibitory molecules.
