The convergence of APP (substrate) and BACE-1 (enzyme) is a rate-limiting, 
obligatory event triggering the amyloidogenic pathway-a key step in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) pathology. However, as both APP/BACE-1 are highly expressed in 
brain, mechanisms precluding their unabated convergence are unclear. Exploring 
dynamic localization of APP/BACE-1 in cultured hippocampal neurons, we found 
that after synthesis via the secretory pathway, dendritic APP/BACE-1-containing 
vesicles are largely segregated in physiologic states. While BACE-1 is sorted 
into acidic recycling endosomes, APP is conveyed in Golgi-derived vesicles. 
However, upon activity induction-a known trigger of the amyloidogenic 
pathway-APP is routed into BACE-1-positive recycling endosomes via a 
clathrin-dependent mechanism. A partitioning/convergence of APP/BACE-1 vesicles 
is also apparent in control/AD brains, respectively. Considering BACE-1 is 
optimally active in an acidic environment, our experiments suggest that neurons 
have evolved trafficking strategies that normally limit APP/BACE-1 proximity and 
also uncover a pathway routing APP into BACE-1-containing organelles, triggering 
amyloidogenesis.
