PURPOSE: Myocilin is an extracellular glycoprotein with unknown function that is 
associated with glaucoma. Calpain II cleaves recombinant myocilin within the 
linker region of the protein, releasing the C-terminal olfactomedin domain from 
the N-terminal domain. The authors previously reported that myocilin interacts 
with the C-terminal region of hevin, a secretory glycoprotein belonging to the 
SPARC family of matricellular proteins. This study aims to investigate the 
interaction of myocilin with SPARC.
METHODS: Protein-protein interactions were evaluated by the yeast two-hybrid 
system. The positive interactions were confirmed by solid-phase binding assays 
using Ni-chelating HPLC purified recombinant proteins and coexpression of 
recombinant proteins in HEK-293T cells. Coexpression of myocilin, SPARC, and 
hevin in ocular tissues was identified by immunoflorescence microscopy, Western 
blot, and array-based gene profiling.
RESULTS: Yeast two-hybrid analyses showed that myocilin interacted with the 
highly conserved C-terminal extracellular calcium binding (EC) domain within 
SPARC and hevin. Solid-phase binding assays confirmed these interactions and 
showed that both myocilin and its C-terminal olfactomedin fragment interacted 
noncovalently with SPARC and a peptide containing the EC domain of SPARC. 
Full-length myocilin interacted with higher affinity with SPARC and its EC 
domain than the myocilin C-terminal fragment. Coexpression of the two 
recombinant proteins in HEK-293T cells also indicated their intracellular 
interaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant myocilin and SPARC interact through their C-terminal 
domains. The data suggest that the proteolytic processing of myocilin modulates 
this interaction as well as the interactions of myocilin with other 
extracellular matrix and matricellular proteins, further supporting a functional 
role for this proteolytic cleavage.

Methods.

Protein-protein interactions were evaluated by the yeast two-hybrid system. The positive interactions were confirmed by solid-phase binding assays using Ni-chelating HPLC purified recombinant proteins and coexpression of recombinant proteins in HEK-293T cells. Coexpression of myocilin, SPARC, and hevin in ocular tissues was identified by immunoflorescence microscopy, Western blot, and array-based gene profiling.

Results.

Yeast two-hybrid analyses showed that myocilin interacted with the highly conserved C-terminal extracellular calcium binding (EC) domain within SPARC and hevin. Solid-phase binding assays confirmed these interactions and showed that both myocilin and its C-terminal olfactomedin fragment interacted noncovalently with SPARC and a peptide containing the EC domain of SPARC. Full-length myocilin interacted with higher affinity with SPARC and its EC domain than the myocilin C-terminal fragment. Coexpression of the two recombinant proteins in HEK-293T cells also indicated their intracellular interaction.

Conclusions.

Recombinant myocilin and SPARC interact through their C-terminal domains. The data suggest that the proteolytic processing of myocilin modulates this interaction as well as the interactions of myocilin with other extracellular matrix and matricellular proteins, further supporting a functional role for this proteolytic cleavage.

Results

We have previously reported that myocilin interacts with the C-terminal region of hevin, which contains the follistatin, Kazal-like, and EC domains (amino acids 401–664). 23 This region is highly conserved in the BM-40/SPARC/osteonectin family ( Fig. 1 ). Interestingly, hevin shows the highest sequence similarity with SPARC (60.8% amino acid identity; 78% similarity; Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). These facts prompted us to initially test the possible interaction of SPARC with myocilin using the yeast two-hybrid system. To achieve this goal, we generated two sets of fusion proteins. The first set was composed of full-length myocilin and its C-terminal half (myocilin-Ct, amino acids 233–504), which resembles the fragment resulting from the proteolytic processing of the full-length protein by calpain II ( Fig. 2 A). The two myocilin versions were fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain ( Fig. 2 A). The second set consisted of hybrids between sequences encoding the GAL4 DNA activation domain and the C-terminal EC domain of either SPARC (AD-SPARC-EC, amino acids 152–303) or hevin (AD-hevin-EC, amino acids 510–664; Fig. 2 A). Histidine prototrophy was observed in yeast cotransformed with fusion plasmids encoding myocilin and either SPARC-EC or hevin-EC, as well as in yeast coexpressing myocilin-Ct and the C-terminal regions of SPARC or hevin ( Fig. 3 A). Histidine prototrophy was also detected in the positive control (pTD1–1-AD/pVA3–1BD cotransformation; Fig. 3 A). As expected, yeast cotransformed with plasmids pTD1–1-AD and pLAM5–1-BD (negative control; Fig. 3 A) was unable to grow in medium lacking His.

Two-hybrid interactions were initially verified and quantified, comparing their relative strength by measuring β-galactosidase activity in liquid yeast culture. In accordance with the previous assay, recombinant myocilin and its C-terminal fragment interacted with the C-terminal fragment of SPARC. The intensity of the interactions of the two versions of myocilin with SPARC-EC was slightly weaker than with hevin-EC ( Fig. 3 B).

Discussion

The biological function of myocilin has remained elusive for more than a decade. As an approach to address this question, different groups have attempted to identify proteins that interact with myocilin.

We have previously reported that myocilin interacts with the C-terminal region of hevin, 23 a member of the SPARC family of matricellular proteins. Among the members of this family, the C-terminal region of hevin and SPARC share the highest sequence similarity (60.8%). Based on these facts, we reasoned that myocilin may also interact with SPARC. The interaction between the C-terminal regions of the two proteins was initially evidenced by the two-hybrid assay and was further supported by the solid-phase binding assays using purified recombinant proteins and the coexpression in HEK-293T cells. The relative interactions in yeast, estimated by liquid β-galactosidase activity measurements, indicate that the binding of the myocilin C-terminal fragment to the C-terminal fragments of SPARC and hevin apparently increases with respect to the entire myocilin. In contrast, the solid-phase binding assays indicate that full-length myocilin exhibits higher affinities than myocilin-Ct in the interaction with SPARC or hevin. This discrepancy can be explained if we bear in mind that there is not direct correlation between β-galactosidase activity and the Kd of an interaction. 38 In fact, in the yeast two-hybrid system, the tested interactions possibly depend on factors such as the orientation of the fused protein and either the GAL-4 activation or the binding domains, the reporter gene used, 38 or the expression levels of the two-hybrid proteins. 39

The minimal C-terminal SPARC fragment that interacted with myocilin contained the EC domain, thus revealing that it is involved in the interaction with the olfactomedin domain of myocilin. It is also worth noting that the C-terminal fragment of myocilin used in all binding assays coincides with that resulting after the proteolytic processing of the protein by calpain II. 12 , 14 Therefore, the differential binding properties of full-length myocilin and its C-terminal fragment suggest that the specific cleavage of myocilin might regulate its interaction with the matricellular proteins SPARC and hevin, as well as with the ECM proteins fibronectin and laminin, as has been reported for myocilin self-aggregation. 16

The typical saturable hyperbolic curves of the interaction of myocilin with the two versions of both SPARC and hevin, as well as with fibronectin and laminin, suggest the absence of cooperativity. This is in contrast with the sigmoidal binding of the myocilin C-terminal fragment to the same proteins, indicating the possible existence of more than one binding site and positive cooperativity. This type of cooperativity may be due to interactions between the binding sites or to the existence of different binding constants. The C-terminal fragment of myocilin also showed increased maximal binding compared with full-length myocilin. This may be due to its smaller molecular size because it is able to interact with a higher number of binding sites. Overall, these data reveal the interaction of myocilin with SPARC through their C-terminal regions and further support the previously reported interaction with hevin. 23 On the other hand, the specific intracellular accumulation of SPARC, which correlates with the amount of myocilin coexpressed in HEK-293T cells, indicates the existence of an interaction between the two recombinant proteins early in the secretory pathway.

Our data also show that myocilin, SPARC, and hevin are coexpressed in different ocular tissues, which is a condition required for the in vivo interaction of these molecules. However, additional experiments are required to demonstrate that the interactions among these molecules actually occur in vivo. In accordance with these results, it has been reported that SPARC is present with myocilin in ocular tissues such as the trabecular meshwork, 40 aqueous humor and vitreous, 41 nonpigmented epithelial cells, 42 and the smooth muscle 43 of the ciliary body.

We previously proposed that extracellular myocilin may form a dynamic molecular network composed of disulfide aggregates that are linked in a reversible way by noncovalent interactions through the N-terminal domain of myocilin 16 ( Fig. 11 A). The data presented herein allow the completion of this model. We hypothesize that the molecular myocilin network may also bind noncovalently, through the C-terminal domain of myocilin monomers, with the EC domains of both SPARC and hevin ( Fig. 11 A). Furthermore, the myocilin network can also interact with fibronectin and laminin in the ECM, acting as a linker between matricellular and ECM proteins. These features resemble those of matricellular proteins, a functional group of nonhomologous and secreted proteins that mediate the interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix. 31 Thus, we also speculate that myocilin might function as a putative matricellular protein. This issue has also been discussed previously. 44

There are interesting functional parallelisms between myocilin, SPARC, and hevin related to cell adhesion and proteolytic processing. Along these lines, hevin and SPARC exhibit a strong antiadhesive activity toward attachment of endothelial cells to fibronectin in vitro, 24 as well as antispreading and focal adhesion-labilizing activity. 45 , 46 Similarly, myocilin blocks the adhesion of cultured TM cells onto fibronectin and induces the loss of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, 47 , 48 but it promotes substrate adhesion, spreading, and formation of focal contacts in podocytes and mesangial cells. 44 Regarding the proteolytic processing of these proteins, a 29 kDa N-terminal SPARC fragment has been detected in both human and bovine ocular tissues, including the ciliary body and aqueous humor. 41 In addition, hevin is present in different mouse tissues, including the eye, as a 55-kDa fragment that probably contains the C-terminal FS-EC domains. 37 , 49 Finally, a C-terminal hevin peptide has also been detected in Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm murine sarcoma cells, 50 which may also occur for tissue-derived SPARC. 51 , 52 Altogether, these data suggest that the three proteins may play coordinated roles in cell adhesion and that proteolytic processing may be a common theme that possibly regulates their interactions and, therefore, their biological activities. Further work is required to confirm these hypotheses.

In short, we show that myocilin interacts with SPARC and hevin, and we provide further support for the functional role of the proteolytic processing of myocilin in regulating its molecular interactions. Furthermore, our data highlight the function of myocilin as an extracellular protein that may link ECM molecules such as fibronectin and laminin with matricellular proteins (e.g., SPARC and hevin), opening the way for future investigations.
