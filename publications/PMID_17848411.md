CONTEXT: Normal fetal testis development is essential for masculinization and 
subsequent adult fertility. The second trimester is a critical period of human 
testicular development and masculinization, but there is a paucity of reliable 
developmental data.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to analyze second-trimester human 
testicular morphology and function.
DESIGN: This was an observational study of second-trimester testis development.
SETTING: The study was conducted at the Universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen.
PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Testes were collected from 57 morphologically normal 
fetuses of women undergoing elective termination of normally progressing 
pregnancies (11-19 wk gestation).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Testicular morphology, cell numbers, and quantitative 
expression of 22 key testicular genes were determined.
RESULTS: Sertoli cell and germ cell number increased exponentially throughout 
the second trimester. Leydig cell number initially increased exponentially but 
slowed toward 19 wk. Transcripts encoding Sertoli (KITL, FGF9, SOX9, FSHR, WT1) 
and germ (CKIT, TFAP2C) cell-specific products increased per testis through the 
second trimester, but expression per cell was static apart from TFAP2C, which 
declined. Leydig cell transcripts (HSD17B3, CYP11A1, PTC1, CYP17, LHR, INSL3) 
also remained static per cell. Testicular expression of adrenal transcripts 
MC2R, CYP11B1, and CYP21 was detectable but unchanged. Expression of other 
transcripts known or postulated to be involved in testicular development (GATA4, 
GATA6, CXORF6, WNT2B, WNT4, WNT5A) increased significantly per testis during the 
second trimester.
CONCLUSIONS: The second trimester is essential for the establishment of Sertoli 
and germ cell numbers. Sertoli and Leydig cells are active throughout the 
period, but there is no evidence of changing transcript levels.
