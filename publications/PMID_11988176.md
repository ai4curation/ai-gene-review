Many central neurons possess large acid-activated currents, yet their molecular 
identity is unknown. We found that eliminating the acid sensing ion channel 
(ASIC) abolished H(+)-gated currents in hippocampal neurons. Neuronal H(+)-gated 
currents and transient acidification are proposed to play a role in synaptic 
transmission. Investigating this possibility, we found ASIC in hippocampus, in 
synaptosomes, and in dendrites localized at synapses. Moreover, loss of ASIC 
impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation. ASIC null mice had reduced 
excitatory postsynaptic potentials and NMDA receptor activation during 
high-frequency stimulation. Consistent with these findings, null mice displayed 
defective spatial learning and eyeblink conditioning. These results identify 
ASIC as a key component of acid-activated currents and implicate these currents 
in processes underlying synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.
