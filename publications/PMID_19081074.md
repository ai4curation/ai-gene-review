Primary cilium dysfunction affects the development and homeostasis of many 
organs in Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). We recently showed that seven highly 
conserved BBS proteins form a stable complex, the BBSome, that functions in 
membrane trafficking to and inside the primary cilium. We have now discovered a 
BBSome subunit that we named BBIP10. Similar to other BBSome subunits, BBIP10 
localizes to the primary cilium, BBIP10 is present exclusively in ciliated 
organisms, and depletion of BBIP10 yields characteristic BBS phenotypes in 
zebrafish. Unexpectedly, BBIP10 is required for cytoplasmic microtubule 
polymerization and acetylation, two functions not shared with any other BBSome 
subunits. Strikingly, inhibition of the tubulin deacetylase HDAC6 restores 
microtubule acetylation in BBIP10-depleted cells, and BBIP10 physically 
interacts with HDAC6. BBSome-bound BBIP10 may therefore function to couple 
acetylation of axonemal microtubules and ciliary membrane growth.
