PDZ domain-containing proteins play an important role in the targeting and 
localization of synaptic membrane proteins. Here, we report an interaction 
between the PDZ domain-containing protein PICK1 and monoamine neurotransmitter 
transporters in vitro and in vivo. In dopaminergic neurons, PICK1 colocalizes 
with the dopamine transporter (DAT) and forms a stable protein complex. 
Coexpression of PICK1 with DAT in mammalian cells and neurons in culture results 
in colocalization of the two proteins in a cluster pattern and an enhancement of 
DAT uptake activity through an increase in the number of plasma membrane DAT. 
Deletion of the PDZ binding site at the carboxyl terminus of DAT abolishes its 
association with PICK1 and impairs the localization of the transporter in 
neurons. These findings indicate a role for PDZ-mediated protein interactions in 
the localization, expression, and function of monoamine transporters.
