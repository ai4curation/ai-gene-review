Tankyrase 1 is a PARP [poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase] that localizes to multiple 
subcellular sites, including telomeres and mitotic centrosomes. Previous studies 
demonstrated that cells deficient in tankyrase 1 suffered a block in resolution 
of sister telomeres and arrested in early anaphase [Dynek and Smith (2004) 
Science 304, 97-100]. This phenotype was dependent on the catalytic PARP 
activity of tankyrase 1. To identify critical acceptors of PARsylation 
[poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation] by tankyrase 1 in mitosis, tankyrase 1 
immunoprecipitates were analysed for associated PARsylated proteins. We 
identified NuMA (nuclear mitotic apparatus protein) as a major acceptor of 
poly(ADP-ribose) from tankyrase 1 in mitosis. We showed by immunofluorescence 
and immunoprecipitation that association between tankyrase 1 and NuMA increases 
dramatically at the onset of mitosis, concomitant with PARsylation of NuMA. 
Knockdown of tankyrase 1 by siRNA (small interfering RNA) eliminates PARsylation 
of NuMA in mitosis, confirming tankyrase 1 as the PARP responsible for this 
modification. However, even in the absence of tankyrase 1 and PARsylation, NuMA 
localizes to spindle poles. By contrast, siRNA knockdown of NuMA results in 
complete loss of tankyrase 1 from spindle poles. We discuss our result in terms 
of a model where PARsylation of NuMA by tankyrase 1 in mitosis could play a role 
in sister telomere separation and/or mitotic progression.
