Cytokine and proto-oncogene messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are rapidly degraded through 
AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region. Rapid decay involves AU-rich 
binding protein AUF1, which complexes with heat shock proteins hsc70-hsp70, 
translation initiation factor eIF4G, and poly(A) binding protein. AU-rich mRNA 
decay is associated with displacement of eIF4G from AUF1, ubiquitination of 
AUF1, and degradation of AUF1 by proteasomes. Induction of hsp70 by heat shock, 
down-regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome network, or inactivation of 
ubiquitinating enzyme E1 all result in hsp70 sequestration of AUF1 in the 
perinucleus-nucleus, and all three processes block decay of AU-rich mRNAs and 
AUF1 protein. These results link the rapid degradation of cytokine mRNAs to the 
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
