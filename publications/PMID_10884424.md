Postreplication repair functions in gap-filling of a daughter strand on 
replication of damaged DNA. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad18 protein 
plays a pivotal role in the process together with the Rad6 protein. Here, we 
have cloned a human homologue of RAD18, hRAD18. It maps on chromosome 3p24-25, 
where deletions are often found in lung, breast, ovary, and testis cancers. In 
vivo, hRad18 protein binds to hHR6 protein through a conserved ring-finger 
motif. Stable transformants with hRad18 mutated in this motif become sensitive 
to UV, methyl methanesulfonate, and mitomycin C, and are defective in the 
replication of UV-damaged DNA. Thus, hRAD18 is a functional homologue of RAD18.
