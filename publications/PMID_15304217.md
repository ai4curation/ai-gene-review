The Seventeen Kilodalton Protein (Skp) is a trimeric periplasmic chaperone that 
assists outer membrane proteins in their folding and insertion into membranes. 
Here we report the crystal structure of Skp from E. coli. The structure of the 
Skp trimer resembles a jellyfish with alpha-helical tentacles protruding from a 
beta barrel body defining a central cavity. The architecture of Skp is 
unexpectedly similar to that of Prefoldin/GimC, a cytosolic chaperone present in 
eukaria and archea, that binds unfolded substrates in its central cavity. The 
ability of Skp to prevent the aggregation of model substrates in vitro is 
independent of ATP. Skp can interact directly with membrane lipids and 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These interactions are needed for efficient 
Skp-assisted folding of membrane proteins. We have identified a putative LPS 
binding site on the outer surface of Skp and propose a model for unfolded 
substrate binding.
