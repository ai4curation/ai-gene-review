In response to infection, Caenorhabditis elegans produces an array of 
antimicrobial proteins. To understand the C. elegans immune response, we have 
investigated the regulation of a large, representative sample of candidate 
antimicrobial genes. We found that all these putative antimicrobial genes are 
expressed in tissues exposed to the environment, a position from which they can 
ward off infection. Using RNA interference to inhibit the function of immune 
signaling pathways in C. elegans, we found that different immune response 
pathways regulate expression of distinct but overlapping sets of antimicrobial 
genes. We also show that different bacterial pathogens regulate distinct but 
overlapping sets of antimicrobial genes. The patterns of genes induced by 
pathogens do not coincide with any single immune signaling pathway. Thus, even 
in this simple model system for innate immunity, striking specificity and 
complexity exist in the immune response. The unique patterns of antimicrobial 
gene expression observed when C. elegans is exposed to different pathogens or 
when different immune signaling pathways are perturbed suggest that a large set 
of yet to be identified pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) exist in the 
nematode. These PRRs must interact in a complicated fashion to induce a unique 
set of antimicrobial genes. We also propose the existence of an "antimicrobial 
fingerprint," which will aid in assigning newly identified C. elegans innate 
immunity genes to known immune signaling pathways.
