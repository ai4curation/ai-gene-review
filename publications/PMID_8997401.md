The recent cloning of two urea transporters will allow to better understand 
their role in the urinary concentrating mechanism. This physiological approach 
needs to be sustained by a knowledge of their functional characteristics. We 
compared the pharmacological properties of the human red blood cell and kidney 
urea transporters (HUT11 and HUT2) in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Both 
proteins allow the rapid transfer of urea but not of water. Both are inhibited 
by phloretin, although with different half-maximal inhibitory concentrations 
(IC50; 75 microM, for HUT11 and 230 microM for HUT2). Whereas 
para-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate inhibits HUT11 with an IC50 of 150 microM, 
it does not inhibit HUT2, whatever the concentration used. We demonstrate that 
thiourea diffuses through HUT11 with a Michaelis constant (Km) of 40 mM, but not 
through HUT2. In contrast, it inhibits urea transport through both proteins. 
This identification of a substrate binding site independent from the transport 
activity is the first step in the understanding of the molecular events 
underlying urea transport.
