The adaptor protein complex-4 or AP-4 is known to mediate autophagosome 
maturation through regulating sorting of transmembrane cargo such as ATG9A at 
the Golgi. There is a need to understand AP-4 function in neurons, as mutations 
in any of its four subunits cause a complex form of hereditary spastic 
paraplegia (HSP) with intellectual disability. While AP-4 has been implicated in 
regulating trafficking and distribution of cargo such as ATG9A and APP, little 
is known about its effect on neuronal lysosomal protein traffic, lysosome 
biogenesis, and function. In this study, we demonstrate that in human 
iPSC-derived neurons AP-4 regulates lysosome composition, function, and 
transport via regulating the export of critical lysosomal receptors, including 
Sortilin 1, from the trans-Golgi network to endo-lysosomes. Additionally, loss 
of AP-4 causes endo-lysosomes to stall and build up in axonal swellings 
potentially through reduced recruitment of retrograde transport machinery to the 
organelle. These findings of axonal lysosome buildup are highly reminiscent of 
those observed in Alzheimer's disease as well as in neurons modeling the most 
common form of HSP, caused by spastin mutations. Our findings implicate AP-4 as 
a critical regulator of neuronal lysosome biogenesis and altered lysosome 
function and axonal endo-lysosome transport as an underlying defect in 
AP-4-deficient HSP. Additionally, our results also demonstrate the utility of 
the human i3Neuronal model system in investigating neuronal phenotypes observed 
in AP-4-deficient mice and/or the human AP-4 deficiency syndrome.
