Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS) is a rare autosomal recessive, multisystem 
disorder presenting in childhood with intermittent neutropenia and pancreatic 
insufficiency. It is characterized by recurrent infections independent of 
neutropenia, suggesting a functional neutrophil defect. While mutations at a 
single gene locus (SBDS) appear to be responsible for SDS in a majority of 
patients, the function of that gene and a specific defect in SDS neutrophil 
behavior have not been elucidated. Therefore, employing 2D and 3D 
computer-assisted motion analysis systems, we have analyzed the basic motile 
behavior and chemotactic responsiveness of individual polymorphonuclear 
leukocytes (PMNs) of 14 clinically diagnosed SDS patients. It is demonstrated 
that the basic motile behavior of SDS PMNs is normal in the absence of 
chemoattractant, that SDS PMNs respond normally to increasing and decreasing 
temporal gradients of the chemoattractant fMLP, and that SDS PMNs exhibit a 
normal chemokinetic response to a spatial gradient of fMLP. fMLP receptors were 
also distributed uniformly through the plasma membrane of SDS PMNs as in control 
PMNs. SDS PMNs, however, were incapable of orienting in and chemotaxing up a 
spatial gradient of fMLP. This unique defect in orientation was manifested by 
the PMNs of every SDS patient tested. The PMNs of an SDS patient who had 
received an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, as well as PMNs from a 
cystic fibrosis patient, oriented normally. These results suggest that the 
defect in SDS PMNs is in a specific pathway emanating from the fMLP receptor 
that is involved exclusively in regulating orientation in response to a spatial 
gradient of fMLP. This pathway must function in parallel with additional 
pathways, intact in SDS patients, that emanate from the fMLP receptor and 
regulate responses to temporal rather than spatial changes in receptor 
occupancy.
