BACKGROUND: Non-syndromic hereditary optic neuropathy (HON) has been ascribed to 
mutations in mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics genes, nuclear and 
mitochondrial DNA-encoded respiratory enzyme genes or nuclear genes of poorly 
known mitochondrial function. However, the disease causing gene remains unknown 
in many families. The objective of the present study was to identify the 
molecular cause of non-syndromic LHON-like disease in siblings born to 
non-consanguineous parents of French origin.
METHODS: We used a combination of genetic analysis (gene mapping and whole-exome 
sequencing) in a multiplex family of non-syndromic HON and of functional 
analyses in patient-derived cultured skin fibroblasts and the yeast Yarrowia 
lipolytica.
RESULTS: We identified compound heterozygote NDUFS2 disease-causing mutations 
(p.Tyr53Cys; p.Tyr308Cys). Studies using patient-derived cultured skin 
fibroblasts revealed mildly decreased NDUFS2 and complex I abundance but 
apparently normal respiratory chain activity. In the yeast Y. lipolytica 
ortholog NUCM, the mutations resulted in absence of complex I and moderate 
reduction in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 
activity, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Biallelism for NDUFS2 mutations causing severe complex I deficiency 
has been previously reported to cause Leigh syndrome with optic neuropathy. Our 
results are consistent with the view that compound heterozygosity for severe and 
hypomorphic NDUFS2 mutations can cause non-syndromic HON. This observation 
suggests a direct correlation between the severity of NDUFS2 mutations and that 
of the disease and further support that there exist a genetic overlap between 
non-syndromic and syndromic HON due to defective mitochondrial function.
