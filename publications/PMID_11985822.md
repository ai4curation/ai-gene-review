A novel system was used to assess the role of D(1)-like dopamine receptors in 
distinct topographies of orofacial movements in mice with congenic D(1A) 
receptor knockout. Under spontaneous conditions, vertical jaw movements in 
wild-types declined with time at a rate that was reduced in D(1A) mutants, while 
horizontal jaw movements emerged progressively in wild-types but not in D(1A) 
mutants; tongue protrusions were absent in D(1A) mutants, while incisor 
chattering was initially reduced in D(1A) mutants but rose subsequently to reach 
the level of wild-types. D(1A) receptors exert a topographically specific role 
in regulating individual spontaneous orofacial movements, and these involve 
interactions with psychomotor processes which 'sculpt' behavioural change over 
time. The anomalous D(1)-like agonist SK&F 83959, which fails to stimulate, and 
indeed inhibits the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase induced by dopamine, readily 
stimulated vertical jaw movements, tongue protrusions and incisor chattering, 
and these response topographies were absent in D(1A) mutants. These results 
suggest that D(1A) receptors may exert some form of permissive role over 
orofacial topographies initiated via a novel, putative D(1)-like site not linked 
to adenylyl cyclase, or that some D(1A) receptors might be coupled to a 
transduction system other than adenylyl cyclase.
