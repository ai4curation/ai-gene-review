Insulin/IGF-signaling (IIS) affects longevity, stress resistance and metabolism 
in worms, flies, and mammals. The Forkhead transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO is 
the major downstream effector of IIS and is responsible for the activation and 
repression of genes that mediate the diverse effects of IIS. We surveyed a set 
of informatically predicted conserved DAF-16/FOXO target genes and identified 
the novel DAF-16 direct target hlh-13. hlh-13 is the predicted homolog of the 
mammalian transcription factor Ptf1a, a critical determinant of pancreatic 
development. We found that an hlh-13 mutant exits L1 arrest and IIS-dependent 
dauer diapause faster than control worms, but is not involved in lifespan or 
resistance to a variety of stresses. Our results have identified a novel DAF-16 
target gene and linked its function to known outputs of IIS. Considering the 
high conservation of IIS in diverse species, our results also hint at an 
intriguing connection of IIS and Ptf1a in mammals.
