Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha signals cell death and simultaneously induces 
the generation of ceramide, which is metabolized to sphingosine and sphingosine 
1-phosphate (S1P) by ceramidase (CDase) and sphingosine kinase. Because the 
dynamic balance between the intracellular levels of ceramide and S1P (the 
"ceramide/S1P rheostat") may determine cell survival, we investigated these 
sphingolipid signaling pathways in TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis of primary 
hepatocytes. Endogenous C16-ceramide was elevated during TNF-alpha-induced 
apoptosis in both rat and mouse primary hepatocytes. The putative acid 
sphingomyelinase (ASMase) inhibitor imipramine inhibited TNF-alpha-induced 
apoptosis and C16-ceramide increase as did the knock out of ASMase. 
Overexpression of neutral CDase (NCDase) inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced 
increase of C16-ceramide and apoptosis in rat primary hepatocytes. Moreover, 
NCDase inhibited liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis in mice treated with 
D-galactosamine plus TNF-alpha. This protective effect was abrogated by the 
sphingosine kinase inhibitor N,N-demethylsphingosine, suggesting that the 
survival effect of NCDase is due to not only C16-ceramide reduction but also S1P 
formation. Administration of S1P or overexpression of NCDase activated the 
pro-survival kinase AKT, and overexpression of dominant negative AKT blocked the 
survival effect of NCDase. In conclusion, activation of ASMase and generation of 
C16-ceramide contributed to TNF-alpha-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. NCDase 
prevented apoptosis both by reducing C16-ceramide and by activation of AKT 
through S1P formation. Therefore, the cross-talk between sphingolipids and AKT 
pathway may determine hepatocyte apoptosis by TNF-alpha.
