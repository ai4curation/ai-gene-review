The inheritance of one defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 allele predisposes an individual 
to developing breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA1 is a multifunctional tumor 
suppressor protein, which through interaction with a vast array of proteins has 
implications in processes such as cell cycle, transcription, DNA damage response 
and chromatin remodeling. Conversely, the oncogene, cyclin D1 is overexpressed 
in about 35% of all breast cancer cases. In this study, we provide detailed 
analyses on the phosphorylation state of BRCA1 by cyclin D1/cdk4 complexes. In 
particular, we have identified Ser 632 of BRCA1 as a cyclin D1/cdk4 
phosphorylation site in vitro. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we 
observed that the inhibition of cyclin D1/cdk4 activity resulted in increased 
BRCA1 DNA binding at particular promoters in vivo. In addition, we identified 
multiple novel genes that are bound by BRCA1 in vivo. Collectively, these 
results indicate that cyclin D1/cdk4-mediated phosphorylation of BRCA1 inhibits 
the ability of BRCA1 to be recruited to particular promoters in vivo. Therefore, 
cyclin D1/Cdk4 phosphorylation of BRCA1 could provide a mechanism to interfere 
with the DNA-dependent activities of BRCA1.
