The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central regulator of 
cell growth that responds to diverse environmental signals and is deregulated in 
many human diseases, including cancer and epilepsy. Amino acids are a key input 
to this system, and act through the Rag GTPases to promote the translocation of 
mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. Multiple protein 
complexes regulate the Rag GTPases in response to amino acids, including GATOR1, 
a GTPase activating protein for RAGA, and GATOR2, a positive regulator of 
unknown molecular function. Here we identify a protein complex (KICSTOR) that is 
composed of four proteins, KPTN, ITFG2, C12orf66 and SZT2, and that is required 
for amino acid or glucose deprivation to inhibit mTORC1 in cultured human cells. 
In mice that lack SZT2, mTORC1 signalling is increased in several tissues, 
including in neurons in the brain. KICSTOR localizes to lysosomes; binds and 
recruits GATOR1, but not GATOR2, to the lysosomal surface; and is necessary for 
the interaction of GATOR1 with its substrates, the Rag GTPases, and with GATOR2. 
Notably, several KICSTOR components are mutated in neurological diseases 
associated with mutations that lead to hyperactive mTORC1 signalling. Thus, 
KICSTOR is a lysosome-associated negative regulator of mTORC1 signalling, which, 
like GATOR1, is mutated in human disease.
