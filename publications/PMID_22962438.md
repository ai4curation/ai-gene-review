The involvement of B cells, complement activation and subsequent immune complex 
deposition has all been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). Although the reduced expression of complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35) and 2 
(CR2, CD21) on the B cells of RA patients has been known for a long time, their 
exact role in B-cell tolerance and autoimmunity is not yet fully understood. To 
get a deeper insight into the possible mechanisms, we studied the expression and 
function of CR1 and CR2 on various subsets of B cells of healthy donors and RA 
patients at various stages of the disease by FACS analysis, (3)H-thymidine 
incorporation and ELISA. We found that CD19(+)CD27(-) naive B cells up-regulate 
the expression of the inhibitory CR1 during differentiation to CD19(+)CD27(+) 
memory B cells both in healthy donors and in RA patients, whereas the expression 
of the activatory CR2 is down-regulated. This clearly demonstrates that the 
expression of these two antagonistic complement receptors is regulated 
differentially during the development of human B cells, a phenomenon which may 
influence the maintenance of peripheral B-cell tolerance. Our functional studies 
show that after clustering CR1 both by its natural ligand and To5 mAb, the 
inhibitory function of CD35 is maintained in RA patients, despite its 
significantly reduced expression compared with healthy individuals. Besides 
blocking B-cell receptor-induced proliferation, CR1 inhibits the differentiation 
of B cells to plasmablasts and their immunoglobulin production. Since the 
reduced expression of CR1 in RA patients does not affect its inhibitory 
function, this receptor might serve as a new target for therapeutical 
interventions.
