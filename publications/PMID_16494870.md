Expression of androgen receptor (AR) in prostate epithelial cells is thought to 
regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. However, the 
molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We report that re-expression of AR in PC-3 
human prostate cancer cell line resulted in upregulation of IFI16 protein, a 
negative regulator of cell growth. We found that the IFI16 protein bound to AR 
in a ligand-dependent manner and the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the AR was 
sufficient to bind IFI16. Furthermore, re-expression of IFI16 protein in LNCaP 
prostate cancer cells, which do not express IFI16 protein, resulted in 
downregulation of AR expression and an inhibition of the expression of AR target 
genes. Our observations identify a role for IFI16 protein in AR-mediated 
functions.
