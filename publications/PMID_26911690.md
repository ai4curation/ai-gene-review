Mutations in PARK2 (parkin), which encodes Parkin protein, an E3 ubiquitin 
ligase, are associated with autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease 
(PD). While several studies implicated Parkin in the regulation of mitophagy and 
proteasomal degradation, the precise mechanism leading to neurodegeneration upon 
Parkin loss of function remains incompletely understood. In this study, we found 
that Parkin modulates the endocytic pathway through the regulation of endosomal 
structure and function. We showed that loss of Parkin function led to decreased 
endosomal tubulation and membrane association of vesicle protein sorting 35 
(VPS35) and sorting nexin 1 (SNX1), as well as decreased mannose 6 phosphate 
receptor (M6PR), suggesting the impairment of retromer pathway in 
Parkin-deficient cells. We also found increased formation of intraluminal 
vesicles coupled with enhanced release of exosomes in the presence of mutant 
Parkin. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of these alterations in the 
endocytic pathway in Parkin-deficient cells, we found that Parkin regulates the 
levels and activity of Rab7 by promoting its ubiquitination on lysine 38 
residue. Both endogenous Rab7 in Parkin-deficient cells and overexpressed K38 
R-Rab7 mutant displayed decreased effector binding and membrane association. 
Furthermore, overexpression of K38R-Rab7 in HEK293 cells phenocopied the 
increased secretion of exosomes observed in Parkin-deficient cells, suggesting 
that Rab7 deregulation may be at least partially responsible for the endocytic 
phenotype observed in Parkin-deficient cells. These findings establish a role 
for Parkin in regulating the endo-lysosomal pathway and retromer function and 
raise the possibility that alterations in these pathways contribute to the 
development of pathology in Parkin-linked Parkinson's disease.
