The mutant human cell line 11.1 is unresponsive to interferon alpha. Here we 
describe the genetic complementation of this mutant and the identification and 
cloning of the wild-type gene that corrects the defect. Using transfection with 
genomic DNA in conjunction with a powerful back-selection, we isolated a cosmid 
that reverts the mutant phenotype of 11.1 cells. The cosmid encodes a single 
message whose level is greatly reduced in mutant cells. Complementary DNAs were 
cloned and found to be virtually identical to tyk2, a human mRNA encoding a 
non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase of previously unknown function. This 
finding shows that tyk2 links the interferon alpha/beta receptor to the 
cytoplasmic transcription factor that mediates activation of 
interferon-responsive genes.
