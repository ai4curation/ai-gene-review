Deposition of the major histone H3 (H3.1) is coupled to DNA synthesis during DNA 
replication and possibly DNA repair, whereas histone variant H3.3 serves as the 
replacement variant for the DNA-synthesis-independent deposition pathway. To 
address how histones H3.1 and H3.3 are deposited into chromatin through distinct 
pathways, we have purified deposition machineries for these histones. The H3.1 
and H3.3 complexes contain distinct histone chaperones, CAF-1 and HIRA, that we 
show are necessary to mediate DNA-synthesis-dependent and -independent 
nucleosome assembly, respectively. Notably, these complexes possess one molecule 
each of H3.1/H3.3 and H4, suggesting that histones H3 and H4 exist as dimeric 
units that are important intermediates in nucleosome formation. This finding 
provides new insights into possible mechanisms for maintenance of epigenetic 
information after chromatin duplication.
