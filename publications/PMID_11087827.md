The crystal structure of recombinant human GTP cyclohydrolase I was solved by 
Patterson search methods by using the coordinates of the Escherichia coli enzyme 
as a model. The human as well as bacterial enzyme were shown to contain an 
essential zinc ion coordinated to a His side chain and two thiol groups in each 
active site of the homodecameric enzymes that had escaped detection during 
earlier studies of the E. coli enzyme. The zinc ion is proposed to generate a 
hydroxyl nucleophile for attack of imidazole ring carbon atom eight of the 
substrate, GTP. It may also be involved in the hydrolytic release of formate 
from the intermediate, 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 
5'-triphosphate, and in the consecutive Amadori rearrangement of the ribosyl 
moiety.
