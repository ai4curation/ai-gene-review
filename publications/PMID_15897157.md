Apolipoprotein J (apoJ), also known as clusterin and SP-40,40, binds soluble 
beta-amyloid (Abeta and is up-regulated in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. 
In the present study we classified apoJ-immunopositive Abeta deposits in AD 
temporal cortex, and found apoJ-immunoreactive plaques were often associated 
with dystrophic neurites. Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of five AD 
brains showed that 29% of Abeta deposited in the parenchyma was associated with 
apoJ. Of Abeta deposits with apoJ immunopositivity, 71% were associated with 
phospho-tau-positive dystrophic neurites in the surrounding tissue. Conversely, 
64% of phospho-tau-labeled neuritic deposits were labeled with apoJ. ApoJ was 
found at the core of these deposits, and co-localized with the amyloid staining 
agent thioflavine-S. To test the direct effects of apoJ on tau metabolism, we 
treated cells in culture with apoJ-containing conditioned media, and we injected 
apoJ-containing media into the rat hippocampus. Using both systems, we observed 
increases in levels of tau and phosphorylated tau. Our findings demonstrate that 
apoJ immunopositivity strongly correlates with the presence of amyloid and 
associated neuritic dystrophy in the neuropil of AD temporal cortex, and 
supports a model where extracellular apoJ facilitates the conversion of diffuse 
Abeta deposits into amyloid and enhances tau phosphorylation in neurites 
surrounding these of plaques.
