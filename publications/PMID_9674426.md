A number of transcriptional coactivator proteins have been identified as histone 
acetyltransferase (HAT) proteins, providing a direct molecular basis for the 
coupling of histone acetylation and transcriptional activation. The yeast 
Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex requires the coactivator protein 
Gcn5 for HAT activity. Identification of protein subunits by mass spectrometry 
and immunoblotting revealed that the TATA binding protein-associated factors 
(TAF(II)s) TAF(II)90, -68/61, -60, -25/23, and -20/17 are integral components of 
this complex. In addition, TAF(II)68 was required for both SAGA-dependent 
nucleosomal HAT activity and transcriptional activation from chromatin templates 
in vitro. These results illustrate a role for certain TAF(II) proteins in the 
regulation of gene expression at the level of chromatin modification that is 
distinct from the TFIID complex and TAF(II)145.
