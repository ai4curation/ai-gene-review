A key function of reversible protein phosphorylation is to regulate 
protein-protein interactions, many of which involve short linear motifs (3-12 
amino acids). Motif-based interactions are difficult to capture because of their 
often low-to-moderate affinities. Here, we describe phosphomimetic proteomic 
peptide-phage display, a powerful method for simultaneously finding motif-based 
interaction and pinpointing phosphorylation switches. We computationally 
designed an oligonucleotide library encoding human C-terminal peptides 
containing known or predicted Ser/Thr phosphosites and phosphomimetic variants 
thereof. We incorporated these oligonucleotides into a phage library and 
screened the PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domains of Scribble and DLG1 for interactions 
potentially enabled or disabled by ligand phosphorylation. We identified known 
and novel binders and characterized selected interactions through microscale 
thermophoresis, isothermal titration calorimetry, and NMR We uncover 
site-specific phospho-regulation of PDZ domain interactions, provide a 
structural framework for how PDZ domains accomplish phosphopeptide binding, and 
discuss ligand phosphorylation as a switching mechanism of PDZ domain 
interactions. The approach is readily scalable and can be used to explore the 
potential phospho-regulation of motif-based interactions on a large scale.
