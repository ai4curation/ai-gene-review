The oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc causes transformation and 
tumorigenesis, but it can also induce apoptotic cell death. Although tumor 
suppressors are necessary for c-Myc to induce apoptosis, the pathways and 
mechanisms are unclear. To further understand how c-Myc switches from an 
oncogenic protein to an apoptotic protein, we examined the mechanism of 
p53-independent c-Myc-induced apoptosis. We show that the tumor suppressor 
protein ARF mediates this switch by inhibiting ubiquitylation of the c-Myc 
transcriptional domain (TD). Whereas TD ubiquitylation is critical for c-Myc 
canonical transcriptional activity and transformation, inhibition of 
ubiquitylation leads to the induction of the noncanonical c-Myc target gene, 
Egr1, which is essential for efficient c-Myc-induced p53-independent apoptosis. 
ARF inhibits the interaction of c-Myc with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2. 
Overexpression of Skp2, which occurs in many human tumors, inhibits the 
recruitment of ARF to the Egr1 promoter, leading to inhibition of c-Myc-induced 
apoptosis. Therapeutic strategies could be developed to activate this intrinsic 
apoptotic activity of c-Myc to inhibit tumorigenesis.

Abstract

The oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc causes transformation and tumorigenesis, but it can also induce apoptotic cell death. Although tumor suppressors are necessary for c-Myc to induce apoptosis, the pathways and mechanisms are unclear. To further understand how c-Myc switches from an oncogenic protein to an apoptotic protein, we examined the mechanism of p53-independent c-Myc–induced apoptosis. We show that the tumor suppressor protein ARF mediates this switch by inhibiting ubiquitylation of the c-Myc transcriptional domain (TD). Whereas TD ubiquitylation is critical for c-Myc canonical transcriptional activity and transformation, inhibition of ubiquitylation leads to the induction of the noncanonical c-Myc target gene, Egr1 , which is essential for efficient c-Myc–induced p53-independent apoptosis. ARF inhibits the interaction of c-Myc with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2. Overexpression of Skp2, which occurs in many human tumors, inhibits the recruitment of ARF to the Egr1 promoter, leading to inhibition of c-Myc–induced apoptosis. Therapeutic strategies could be developed to activate this intrinsic apoptotic activity of c-Myc to inhibit tumorigenesis.

Discussion

Previous studies have implicated ubiquitylation in influencing c-Myc proliferative and canonical transcriptional activity in addition to proteolysis ( 15 , 17 – 19 ). Our results directly show that ubiquitylation of the c-Myc TD is necessary for canonical c-Myc target gene induction and efficient c-Myc–induced transformation. Our results also suggest that the ability of ARF to inhibit canonical transcriptional activity is due to its ability to inhibit Skp2-mediated ubiquitylation of the c-Myc TD. In addition, the loss of ubiquitylation not only inhibits canonical activity but also allows the acquisition of a new noncanonical activity, specifically the induction of the noncanonical c-Myc target gene, Egr1 , which then mediates p53-independent c-Myc–induced apoptosis. Therefore, the canonical oncogenic activity of c-Myc, which is enhanced by Skp2, and the noncanonical apoptotic activity induced by ARF are controlling a unique mechanism dependent on ubiquitylation of the c-Myc TD.

Our results suggest that Skp2 preferentially ubiquitylates the c-Myc TD rather than the C-terminal half of c-Myc. In growing cells, it has been shown that half of the lysines in the TD, including 52, 149, and 158, are ubiquitylated ( 20 ); however, it is unknown whether the various c-Myc ubiquitin ligases have preferences for specific lysines or domains. Although the c-Myc degron has been mapped to the TD ( 21 , 22 ), our data suggest that ubiquitylation of both the N - and C-terminal domains contribute to c-Myc proteolysis. Unlike Skp2, which behaves as an oncogene that stimulates c-Myc transcription and proliferation, other c-Myc E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as Fbw7 and TRPC4AP/TRUSS, act as tumor suppressors that inhibit c-Myc transactivation and transformation ( 14 , 23 ). In contrast to enhanced apoptosis observed upon inhibition of Skp2, loss of Fbw7 binding and ubiquitylation, due to mutation at the Thr58 phosphorylation site of c-Myc, results in less apoptosis ( 14 , 16 , 24 ). Therefore, we conclude that ubiquitylation of the TD regulated by Skp2 and ARF competitive interaction is a key factor controlling c-Myc transcriptional and biological activity, rather than just the levels of c-Myc regulated by proteolysis.

Our model is that the ubiquitylation of the TD is critical for the induction of canonical c-Myc target genes, such as cdk4, cyclin D2 and eIF4E , which mediate c-Myc-induced cell cycle progression under normal conditions ( Fig. 5 K ). Oncogenic c-Myc induces ARF expression, which then blocks the binding of Skp2 and perhaps other ligases, preventing TD ubiquitylation necessary for c-Myc-mediated proliferation and transformation. Simultaneously, the loss of ubiquitylation triggers a transcriptional switch that allows c-Myc to induce the noncanonical Egr1 target gene, which then mediates c-Myc-induced p53-independent apoptosis ( Fig. 5 K ). Tumorigenesis could occur if either the expression of ARF or Egr1 is suppressed or if Skp2 expression or activity is increased, all of which have been found in many different types of human tumors ( 8 , 25 – 28 ). Since Skp2 is a c-Myc target gene, positive feedback would enhance c-Myc activity and compete with ARF ( 29 ). Conversely, loss of Skp2 would cause growth inhibition ( 30 ) or apoptosis. This idea is supported by studies in glioblastoma and laryngeal cancer that demonstrates an inhibition of Skp2 induces apoptosis ( 31 , 32 ). Therefore, the ubiquitylation of the c-Myc TD, which controls the intrinsic transcriptional and apoptotic activities of c-Myc, can be targeted to develop novel therapeutic strategies to eradicate tumor cells and prevent c-Myc-driven tumorigenesis. Since the Myc-ARF-Egr1 pathway is p53-independent, unlike other c-Myc-induced apoptotic pathways, the ubiquitylation-dependent apoptotic activity of c-Myc can be activated in tumors that have lost p53, which represent half of all human tumors.
