The product of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene CDC28, a protein kinase 
required for initiation of the cell division cycle, was localized within yeast 
cells. By using immunofluorescence methods, the CDC28 product was shown to be 
primarily cytoplasmic in distribution. The gene product was localized largely to 
the particulate fraction by differential centrifugation after mechanical 
disruption in aqueous buffers. The particulate association was not affected by 
the presence of nonionic detergent. To refine this localization further, a 
procedure was developed for the preparation of yeast cytoplasmic matrices which 
resemble the cytoskeletons of vertebrate cells on the basis of methodology, 
immunochemistry, and gross ultrastructure. A portion of the CDC28 product was 
found to be tightly associated with these detergent-insoluble cytoplasmic 
matrices by both immunofluorescence and immunoblotting procedures. Although, for 
technical reasons, precise quantitation was not possible, it is estimated that a 
minimum of 2-15% of the total CDC28 product pool is involved in the association 
with the insoluble matrix. Alcohol dehydrogenase, a soluble cytoplasmic protein, 
was found not to be associated with the cytoplasmic matrices at any detectable 
level, whereas, in contrast, approximately 10-40% of the total cellular actin, a 
bonafide cytoskeletal protein, was present in these structures. The proportion 
of CDC28 gene product associated with the particulate fraction, and perhaps the 
insoluble matrix, appears to be substantially decreased during the preparation 
of spheroplasts.
