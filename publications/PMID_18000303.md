The origin of cells replacing ageing beta-cells in adult life is unknown. This 
study assessed the expression of classic stem cell markers: Oct4, Sox2 and CD34 
in islet-enriched fractions versus exocrine cell-enriched fractions from 25 
adult human pancreases following human islet isolation. Expression of Oct4, Sox2 
and CD34 mRNAs was found in all cell samples, with no significant differences 
between endocrine and exocrine cell fractions. Immunohistochemical staining for 
Oct4, Sox2, CD133, CD34, CK19, insulin and nestin on human pancreas sections 
showed that the majority of Oct4(+ve) cells were found in the walls of small 
ducts. Similar localisations were observed for Sox2(+ve) cells. The majority of 
Sox2(+ve) cells were found to co-express Oct4 proteins, but not vice versa. 
Cells positive for Oct4 and Sox2 appeared to be a unique cell population in the 
adult human pancreases without co-expression for CK19, CD34, CD133, insulin and 
nestin proteins. The numbers of Oct4(+ve) and Sox2(+ve) cells varied among 
donors and were approximately 1-200 and 1-30 per 100 000 pancreatic cells 
respectively.
