Constitutive heat shock protein 70 (Hsc70) is a molecular chaperone that has 
been shown to protect cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress. However, the 
molecular mechanism responsible for this protection remains uncertain. To 
understand the mechanism associated with the myocardial protective role of 
Hsc70, we have embarked upon a systematic search for Hsc70-interacting proteins. 
Using adenosine diphosphate (ADP) affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, 
we have identified α-enolase, a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, as a novel 
Hsc70-interacting protein in the myocardium of both sham and myocardial 
ischemia-reperfused Sprague-Dawley rat hearts. This interaction was confirmed by 
co-immunoprecipitation (IP) assays in the myocardial tissues and H9c2 
cardiomyocytes and protein overlay assay (POA). It was further shown that 
Hsc70-overexpression alleviated the H(2)O(2)-induced decrease of α-enolase 
activity and cell damage, and Hsc70 deficiency aggravated the decrease of 
α-enolase activity and cell damage in H(2)O(2) treated H9c2 cells. Our research 
suggests that the protective effect of Hsc70 on the cardiomyocytes against 
oxidative stress is partly associated with its interaction with α-enolase.
