High-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), which mainly exists in the nucleus, 
has recently been shown to function as a sentinel molecule for viral nucleic 
acid sensing and an autophagy regulator in the cytoplasm. In this study, we 
studied the chaperone-like activity of HMGB1 and found that HMGB1 inhibited the 
chemically induced aggregation of insulin and lysozyme, as well as the 
heat-induced aggregation of citrate synthase. HMGB1 also restored the 
heat-induced suppression of cytoplasmic luciferase activity as a reporter 
protein in hamster lung fibroblast O23 cells with expression of HMGB1. Next, we 
demonstrated that HMGB1 inhibited the formation of aggregates and toxicity 
caused by expanded polyglutamine (polyQ), one of the main causes of Huntington 
disease. HMGB1 directly interacted with polyQ on immunofluorescence and 
coimmunoprecipitation assay, whereas the overexpression of HMGB1 or exogenous 
administration of recombinant HMGB1 protein remarkably reduced polyQ aggregates 
in SHSY5Y cells and hmgb1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts upon filter trap and 
immunofluorescence assay. Finally, overexpressed HMGB1 proteins in mouse 
embryonic primary striatal neurons also bound to polyQ and decreased the 
formation of polyQ aggregates. To this end, we have demonstrated that HMGB1 
exhibits chaperone-like activity and a possible therapeutic candidate in polyQ 
disease.

Finally, overexpressed HMGB1 proteins in mouse embryonic primary striatal neurons also bound to polyQ and decreased the formation of polyQ aggregates. To this end, we have demonstrated that HMGB1 exhibits chaperone-like activity and a possible therapeutic candidate in polyQ disease.

Introduction

High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a highly conserved nuclear protein, and its amino acid sequence is conserved across species ( 1 ). In most eukaryotic cells, HMGB1 is located in the nucleus, where it functions as a nucleosome stabilizer and a regulator of transcription ( 2 , 3 ). HMGB1 recently has been shown to play a role as a cytokine-like molecule when it is released into extracellular space. HMGB1 can be released passively after necrosis and also actively from macrophages and monocytes if they are stimulated ( 4 ). HMGB1 binds to TLR-2, -4, and receptor for advanced glycation end products ( 5 , 6 ) and promotes inflammation. HMGB1 was also shown to act as a late mediator of endotoxemia and sepsis in animal models and human patients ( 7 – 10 ). HMGB1 moves to the cytoplasm via a redox-dependent mechanism and plays a role as a regulator between macroautophagy and apoptosis in the cytoplasm by binding to beclin-1 and dissociating from bcl-2 ( 11 ).

Some proteins form aggregates under stressful conditions such as increases of reactive oxygen species, metal ions, or aging ( 12 – 14 ). Aggregated proteins can be cleared by macroautophagy ( 15 , 16 ), and chaperones are known to modify proteostasis strongly ( 17 , 18 ). Polyglutamine (polyQ) tract is present in wild-type proteins that are from a cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat coding for a glutamine. PolyQ expansion disease family includes at least nine heritable disorders of Huntington disease and the spinocerebellar ataxias SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17 caused by expansion of a CAG repeat of affected proteins ( 19 ). Huntington disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the aggregation of an expanded polyQ of the mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt) over 35 CAG repeats in the gene ( 20 ) and expanded polyQ tracts beyond the threshold influence on secondary structure and cause the formation of aggregates ( 21 , 22 ). The aggregates formed by polyQ induce neuronal cell toxicity by several mechanisms such as proteasomal dysfunction ( 23 ) and sequestration of transcriptional factors ( 24 ). How the mutated proteins in these polyQ cause disease in cellular and molecular mechanisms is still in discussions; however, the clearance of aggregates formed by polyQ is a therapeutic target.

Molecular chaperones are defined as any protein that interacts with and stabilizes another protein to acquire its functionally active conformation, without being present in its final structure ( 25 ). Chaperones like HSP70 can suppress the formation of mHtt aggregates, alleviating its toxicity in cultured cells and animal models ( 26 – 28 ). Upregulation of chaperones such as HSP70 and HSP40 decrease the formation of aggregates, and, therefore, chaperone molecules have been considered as one of the therapeutic targets in many aggregate-prone diseases ( 29 ).

In the current study, we investigated the chaperone-like function of HMGB1 by applying physical stress to target proteins and intracytoplasmic stress to luciferase and polyQ proteins. We show that HMGB1 inhibits the chemically induced aggregation of insulin and lysozyme as well as the heat-induced aggregation of citrate synthase in vitro. In an in vivo refolding assay using hamster lung fibroblast O23 cells, HMGB1 also decreased the heat-induced inactivation of the luciferase protein. In an aggregation-prone model of expanded polyQ, we demonstrated that HMGB1 proteins could bind to polyQ and reduce the formation of aggregates, diminishing the cytotoxicity caused by polyQ aggregates.

Discussion

HMGB1 is a ubiquitous nuclear protein and is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, especially of hepatocytes and neuronal cells ( 40 ). In various conditions under proinflammatory signals or oxidative stresses, nuclear HMGB1 can be transported into cytoplasm or secreted into the extracellular space. In the nucleus, HMGB1 plays a role as a DNA chaperone that acts as an architectural chromatin-binding factor, which bends DNA and promotes protein assembly at specific DNA targets. Extracellular HMGB1 functions as a proinflammatory cytokine-like molecule by direct binding to TLR4 or indirectly binding with other molecules ( 41 ). In addition, HMGB1 can play an intracytoplasmic role as a regulator between macroautophagy and apoptosis ( 11 , 42 – 44 ) and a sentinel molecule for viral nucleic acid sensing ( 45 ).

In this study, we have demonstrated as a novel finding that HMGB1 exhibits a chaperone-like activity. Extracellular HMGB1 protein reduced protein aggregation induced by heat or chemical stress, and this chaperone-like function could be observed in the cytoplasm by the restoration of intracytoplasmic luciferase activity after heat stress. In addition, HMGB1 was able to reduce the formation of aggregation of expanded polyQ and restore the cell viability from aggregation-induced toxicity. Expanded polyQ is a shared feature of all polyQ diseases, forming misfolded proteins that disrupt normal cellular pathways. Compensatory expression of HMGBs ameliorates polyQ-induced pathology of activation of Chk1 and H2AX, cell-cycle checkpoint kinase and histone that marks sites of DNA structural damage, respectively, and in vivo toxicity of mutant polyQ protein by suppressing genotoxic stress in a Drosophila polyQ model ( 46 ). On the contrary, the positive interaction of HMGB1 to normal 25Q protein in our result did not agree with a previous report of negative binding to 20Q protein ( 46 ). It is possibly due to the number difference of glutamine repeats, 20 or 25, but the clear comparison experiment is necessary to further investigate the physiological meaning of HMGB1 binding to normal polyQ. Classical chaperone proteins of HSP70 and HSP40 family proteins bind to soluble mHtt and suppress aggregation formation and cellular toxicity by correcting the structure of misfolded proteins or degradation of irreversibly damaged polypeptides ( 47 ). HSP70 increases the level of soluble polyQ proteins by directly associating with polyQ aggregates in a dynamic and transient manner ( 48 , 49 ), and HSP40 (DNAJ) associates with aggregates and suppresses aggregation by chaperone modification of high m.w. complexes ( 29 ).

Expansion of polyQ repeats leads to early increase of ROS coinciding with polyQ aggregation. Aggregation of a fragment of Htt protein directly causes free radical production in vivo ( 36 ), and inhibition of polyQ aggregation suppresses ROS ( 50 , 51 ). Oxidative potential is important for the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of HMGB1, and redox status of HMGB1 also affects its specific function ( 52 ). In our study, ROS generated by overexpression of 97Q-GFP induced translocation of nuclear HMGB1. This translocation was decreased by treatment of ROS scavengers NAC and Mito-tempo, demonstrating the important role of ROS in HMGB1 translocation and binding to expanded polyQ. Our previous finding shows that posttranslational modification of phosphorylation is also responsible for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of HMGB1, and Ca 2+ -dependent classical protein kinase C is an effector kinase of HMGB1 phosphorylation ( 53 ). Considering that expanded polyQ expression induces Ca 2+ -dependent protein kinase C via metabotropic glutamate receptor–mediated cell signaling ( 54 ), it is possible that members of the classical protein kinase C enzyme (α, βI, βII, and γ) family are the main kinases for nucleocytoplasmic transport of HMGB1 to interact with polyQ. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether phosphorylation of HMGB1 could be induced by overexpression of expanded polyQ.

Exogenous administration of rHMGB1 proteins reduced the formation of intracellular mHtt aggregates. The penetration mechanism of rHMGB1 protein into the cytoplasm is not clear, and this penetration was not inhibited by cytochalasin B, suggesting a phagocytosis-independent mechanism. Previous reports that addition of exogenous rHMGB1 proteins to the medium can increase the binding with TLR9 in the cytoplasm ( 37 ) and HMGB1–oligodeoxynucleotide complexes are efficiently taken by cells in the absence of HMGB1 receptor of receptor for advanced glycation end products support intracellular uptake of exogenous HMGB1 protein. In HSP70 protein, it can also enter human motor neurons in time- and dose-dependent manners ( 39 , 55 ) and protect motor neurons subjected to the oxidative stress by decreasing aggregate-positive cells ( 56 , 57 ), although the mechanism has not been clearly explained.

Overexpression of HMGB1, however, is not always beneficial to reducing polyQ aggregation. A high concentration of HMGB1 rather aggravated the formation of mHtt aggregates in both HMGB1-overexpressed cells and exogenously rHMGB1-treated cell-culture conditions (data not shown). HMGB1 proteins tended to be oligomerized or aggregated by themselves under oxidative stress conditions (data not shown). Excessive amount of HMGB1 is possibly coaggregated with polyQ aggregates. HSP70 protein also showed a similar effect when the protein was overexpressed, suggesting that the optimal concentration of chaperonic proteins is beneficial for the survival of motor neurons ( 58 ). The experiments of addition of HMGB1 in hmgb1 −/− MEF cells and primary neuronal cells confirmed that HMGB1 has a chaperone-like activity.

In summary, we identified a new role of HMGB1 as a chaperone-like molecule in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the chaperone-like activity of HMGB1 could be a new therapeutic choice of polyQ diseases.
