A 44 bp intestine-specific hermaphrodite-specific enhancer from the C. elegans 
vit-2 vitellogenin gene is directly regulated by ELT-2, MAB-3, FKH-9 and DAF-16 
and indirectly regulated by the germline, by daf-2/insulin signaling and by the 
TGF-β/Sma/Mab pathway.

The Caenorhabditis elegans vitellogenin genes are transcribed in the intestine 
of adult hermaphrodites but not of males. A 44-bp region from the vit-2 gene 
promoter is able largely to reconstitute this tissue-, stage- and 
sex-specific-expression. This "enhancer" contains a binding site for the 
DM-domain factor MAB-3, the male-specific repressor of vitellogenesis, as well 
as an activator site that we show is the direct target of the intestinal GATA 
factor ELT-2. We further show that the enhancer is directly activated by the 
winged-helix/forkhead-factor FKH-9, (whose gene has been shown by others to be a 
direct target of DAF-16), by an unknown activator binding to the MAB-3 site, and 
by the full C. elegans TGF-β/Sma/Mab pathway acting within the intestine. The 
vit-2 gene has been shown by others to be repressed by the daf-2/daf-16 insulin 
signaling pathway, which so strongly influences aging and longevity in C. 
elegans. We show that the activity of the 44 bp vit-2 enhancer is abolished by 
loss of daf-2 but is restored by simultaneous loss of daf-16. DAF-2 acts from 
outside of the intestine but DAF-16 acts both from outside of the intestine and 
from within the intestine where it binds directly to the same non-canonical 
target site that interacts with FKH-9. Activity of the 44 bp vit-2 enhancer is 
also inhibited by loss of the germline, in a manner that is only weakly 
influenced by DAF-16 but that is strongly influenced by KRI-1, a key downstream 
effector in the pathway by which germline loss increases C. elegans lifespan. 
The complex behavior of this enhancer presumably allows vitellogenin gene 
transcription to adjust to demands of body size, germline proliferation and 
nutritional state but we suggest that the apparent involvement of this enhancer 
in aging and longevity "pathways" could be incidental.
