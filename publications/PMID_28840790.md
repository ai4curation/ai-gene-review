Rhodopsin 7 ( Rh7), a new invertebrate Rhodopsin gene, was discovered in the 
genome of Drosophila melanogaster in 2000, but its function has remained 
elusive. We generated an Rh7 null mutant ( Rh70) by P element-mediated 
mutagenesis and found that an absence of Rh7 had significant effects on fly 
activity patterns during light-dark (LD) cycles: Rh70 mutants exhibited less 
morning activity and a longer siesta than wild-type controls. Consistent with 
these results, we found that Rh7 appears to be expressed in a few dorsal clock 
neurons that have been previously implicated in the control of the siesta. We 
also found putative Rh7 expression in R8 photoreceptor cells of the compound 
eyes and in the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets, which have been shown to control the 
precise timing of locomotor activity. The absence of Rh7 alone impaired neither 
the flies' responses to constant white light nor the ability to follow phase 
shifts of white LD cycles. However, in blue light (470 nm), Rh70 mutants needed 
significantly longer to synchronize than wild-type controls, suggesting that Rh7 
is a blue light-sensitive photopigment with a minor contribution to circadian 
clock synchronization. In combination with mutants that lacked additionally 
cryptochrome-based and/or eye-based light input to the circadian clock, the 
absence of Rh7 provoked slightly stronger effects.
