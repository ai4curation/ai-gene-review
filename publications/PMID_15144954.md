Nucleophosmin (NPM, B23) is an abundant nucleolar phosphoprotein involved in 
ribosome biogenesis, and interacts with tumor suppressor proteins p53 and Rb. 
Here we show that NPM is a UV damage response protein that undergoes 
nucleoplasmic redistribution and regulates p53 and HDM2 levels and their 
interaction. By utilizing RNAi approaches and analyses of endogenous and 
ectopically expressed proteins, we demonstrate that NPM binds HDM2 and acts as a 
negative regulator of p53-HDM2 interaction. Viral stress, enforced by expression 
of Kaposi's sarcoma virus K cyclin, causes NPM redistribution, K cyclin-NPM 
association, and p53 stabilization by dissociation of HDM2-p53 complexes. The 
results demonstrate novel associations of HDM2 and K cyclin with NPM and 
implicate NPM as a crucial controller of p53 through inhibition of HDM2.
