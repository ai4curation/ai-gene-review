We have isolated a cDNA from a rabbit intestinal cDNA library which, when 
co-expressed with the heavy chain of the human 4F2 antigen (4F2hc) in mammalian 
cells, induces system L-like amino acid transport activity. This protein, called 
LAT2, consists of 535 amino acids and is distinct from LAT1 which also interacts 
with 4F2hc to induce system L-like amino acid transport activity. LAT2 does not 
interact with rBAT, a protein with a significant structural similarity to 4F2hc. 
The 4F2hc/LAT2-mediated transport process differs from the 4F2hc/LAT1-mediated 
transport in substrate specificity, substrate affinity, tissue distribution, 
interaction with D-amino acids, and pH-dependence. The 4F2hc/LAT2-associated 
transport process has a broad specificity towards neutral amino acids with K(t) 
values in the range of 100-1000 microM, does not interact with D-amino acids to 
any significant extent, and is stimulated by acidic pH. In contrast, the 
4F2hc/LAT1-associated transport process has a narrower specificity towards 
neutral amino acids, but with comparatively higher affinity (K(t) values in the 
range of 10-20 microM), interacts with some D-amino acids with high affinity, 
and is not influenced by pH. LAT2 is expressed primarily in the small intestine 
and kidney, whereas LAT1 exhibits a much broader tissue distribution.
