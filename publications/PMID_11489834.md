PURPOSE: Glyoxalase I (GLO1) is an enzyme that plays a role in the 
detoxification of methylglyoxal, a side-product of glycolysis. We previously 
reported that GLO1 was a resistant factor to antitumor agent-induced apoptosis, 
and that S-p-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (BBGC), an effective 
inhibitor of GLO1, selectively sensitized to etoposide the drug-resistant human 
leukemia cells that overexpressed GLO1. In this study, we quantitatively 
measured GLO1 enzyme activity in various human solid tumor cells, and the 
antiproliferative effect of the GLO1 inhibitor was examined.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: BBGC-induced apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. To 
evaluate antitumor activity of BBGC in vivo, we developed human cancer 
xenografts in nude mice.
RESULTS: We found that GLO1 enzyme activity was higher in all of the 38 human 
cancer cell lines that we examined than in the normal tissue samples. Moreover, 
GLO1 activity was frequently elevated in human lung carcinoma cells. Positive 
correlation between cellular GLO1 activity and BBGC sensitivity was observed in 
the lung cancer cell lines. Human lung cancer NCI-H522 and DMS114 cells, 
expressing higher GLO1 activity, underwent apoptosis when treated with BBGC, 
whereas A549 cells, expressing lower activity, did not. BBGC induced the 
activation of the stress-activated protein kinases c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase 1 
(JNK1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which led to caspase 
activation in GLO1-overexpressing tumor cells. BBGC significantly inhibited the 
growth of xenografted DMS114 and human prostate cancer DU-145.
CONCLUSIONS: Our present results indicate that GLO1 is a tumor-specific target 
enzyme especially in human lung carcinoma cells and that the GLO1 inhibitor is a 
potent chemotherapeutic agent to repress GLO1-overexpressing human tumors.
