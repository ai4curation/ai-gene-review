The effect of regucalcin, isolated from rat liver cytosol, on neutral 
proteolytic activity in the hepatic cytosol was investigated. The 
Ca(2+)-requiring proteinase required 5-10 microM Ca2+ for maximal activity in 
the presence of a protein substrate (globin). The proteinase activity was 
markedly elevated by the addition of regucalcin (0.25-2.0 microM) in the absence 
or presence of Ca2+ (5.0 microM) added. The effect of regucalcin, however, was 
the greater in the absence of Ca2+ than that in the presence. The pronounced 
effect of regucalcin on the proteinase activity was also seen in the presence of 
1.0 mM EGTA with or without Ca2+ (5.0 microM). In the absence of Ca2+, the 
regucalcin-increased proteinase activity was clearly inhibited by the presence 
of anti-regucalcin antiserum (diluted to 240-fold), leupeptin (20 and 200 
micrograms/ml), and heavy metals (25 microM cadmium or 25 microM zinc), although 
the inhibition was not complete at the concentration used. The present findings 
suggest that regucalcin increases proteolytic activity in rat liver cytosol, and 
that regucalcin may activate Ca(2+)-independent neutral cysteinyl-proteinase.

Abstract

Regucalcin (RGN) is a calcium (Ca 2+ )-binding protein widely expressed in vertebrate and invertebrate species, which is also known as senescence marker protein 30, due to its molecular weight (33 kDa) and a characteristically diminished expression with the aging process. RGN regulates intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis and the activity of several proteins involved in intracellular signalling pathways, namely, kinases, phosphatases, phosphodiesterase, nitric oxide synthase and proteases, which highlights its importance in cell biology. In addition, RGN has cytoprotective effects reducing intracellular levels of oxidative stress, also playing a role in the control of cell survival and apoptosis. Multiple factors have been identified regulating the cell levels of RGN transcripts and protein, and an altered expression pattern of this interesting protein has been found in cases of reproductive disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Moreover, RGN is a serum-secreted protein, and its levels have been correlated with the stage of disease, which strongly suggests the usefulness of this protein as a potential biomarker for monitoring disease onset and progression. The present review aims to discuss the available information concerning RGN expression and function in distinct cell types and tissues, integrating cellular and molecular mechanisms in the context of normal and pathological conditions. Insight into the cellular actions of RGN will be a key step towards deepening the knowledge of the biology of several human diseases.

Introduction

Regucalcin (RGN) was initially discovered in 1978 by Yamaguchi [ 1 ] and, although classified as a calcium (Ca 2+ )-binding protein, it does not contain the typical EF-hand Ca 2+ -binding motif [ 2 ]. The overall structure of RGN protein contains 24 β-strands forming 6 β-sheets able to bind diverse divalent cations (Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ and Zn 2+ ) [ 3 – 6 ]. The RGN ability to bind Ca 2+ was recently confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies which have allowed the resolving of the crystal structure of human RGN protein bound to Ca 2+ or Zn 2+ cations. Although Ca 2+ and Zn 2+ ions bind to the same amino acid residues forming a unique metal binding site in a nearly identical coordination, an very much higher level of dissociation constant is documented for Ca 2+ which could be relevant under non-physiological conditions, whereas elevated Ca 2+ levels can occur [ 4 ].

The RGN gene is localised in the p11.3-q11.2 and q11.1-12 segments of the human and rat X chromosome, respectively [ 7 , 8 ]. In both cases, the gene consists of seven exons [ 9 – 11 ] encoding a protein of 299 amino acid residues with an approximate molecular weight of 33 kDa [ 2 , 12 ]. For this reason, together with the diminished expression of RGN in tissues of aged animals, Fujita and co-authors [ 12 – 14 ] named it senescence marker protein 30 (SMP30).

RGN is highly expressed in the liver and kidney cortex [ 12 , 15 , 16 ], but it has been detected in several other tissues [ 16 , 17 ] in a broad range of vertebrate and invertebrate species [ 18 – 20 ]. The transcription of RGN gene is enhanced by several regulatory transcription factors upstream of the 5′ flaking region, namely the AP1, NF1-A1, RGPR-p117 and β-catenin [ 21 ]. Ca 2+ levels modulate RGN expression in a process involving, for example, calmodulin (CaM) or protein kinase C (PKC) [ 22 – 24 ]. Also, Ca 2+ -independent mechanisms [ 25 ], hormonal factors and others have been described as regulating the levels of RGN in cells [ 11 , 26 – 30 ]. Moreover, altered expression patterns of RGN have been associated with several disease conditions in both human and animal models [ 11 , 31 – 39 ], which highlights the importance of this protein in cell biology.

RGN has been localised to the cell nucleus and cytoplasm [ 26 , 40 , 41 ], as well as in the mitochondrial fraction [ 42 ], and multiple physiological functions have been assigned to this curious protein. Among them is the ability of RGN to influence Ca 2+ homeostasis through the regulation of Ca 2+ -pumping activity in the cell membrane, nucleus, microsomes, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria of various cell types [ 43 ]. It has also been associated with intracellular signalling pathways, since it regulates several Ca 2+ -dependent enzymes such as protein kinases, tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, phosphodiesterase, nitric oxide synthase and proteases [ 43 – 48 ].

In addition, the antioxidant properties of RGN in reducing intracellular levels of oxidative stress have also been described. This effect is achieved through modulation of the activity of enzymes involved in generation of oxidative stress as well as in the antioxidant defence [ 49 – 52 ].

Several reports using gene-silencing and over-expression approaches have pointed out a role of RGN in regulating cell death and proliferation. Although the mechanisms implicated in this control are not completely understood, it has been demonstrated that RGN can regulate DNA synthesis and fragmentation [ 53 – 56 ], and modulate the expression of oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes and cell cycle regulators [ 53 , 54 , 57 ], influencing survival and apoptotic pathways [ 58 – 60 ].

This review discusses the current knowledge about the expression and function of RGN in several cell types and tissues, exploring concepts from the molecular biology point of view in signalling pathways and systems biology. The potential roles of RGN in pathological situations will also be discussed.
