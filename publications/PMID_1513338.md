The effect of regucalcin, isolated from rat liver cytosol, on neutral 
proteolytic activity in the hepatic cytosol was investigated. The 
Ca(2+)-requiring proteinase required 5-10 microM Ca2+ for maximal activity in 
the presence of a protein substrate (globin). The proteinase activity was 
markedly elevated by the addition of regucalcin (0.25-2.0 microM) in the absence 
or presence of Ca2+ (5.0 microM) added. The effect of regucalcin, however, was 
the greater in the absence of Ca2+ than that in the presence. The pronounced 
effect of regucalcin on the proteinase activity was also seen in the presence of 
1.0 mM EGTA with or without Ca2+ (5.0 microM). In the absence of Ca2+, the 
regucalcin-increased proteinase activity was clearly inhibited by the presence 
of anti-regucalcin antiserum (diluted to 240-fold), leupeptin (20 and 200 
micrograms/ml), and heavy metals (25 microM cadmium or 25 microM zinc), although 
the inhibition was not complete at the concentration used. The present findings 
suggest that regucalcin increases proteolytic activity in rat liver cytosol, and 
that regucalcin may activate Ca(2+)-independent neutral cysteinyl-proteinase.
