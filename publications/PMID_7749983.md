OX40 is a member of the TNF/NGF-receptor family expressed on activated T cells, 
whose ligand is found on activated T and B cells. In the present study, we show 
that cross-linking of OX40L on CD40L-stimulated B cells, alpha IgD 
dextran-stimulated B cells, or both results in a significantly enhanced 
proliferative response with no change in the cell survival rate. Furthermore, 
OX40 stimulation increases immunoglobulin heavy chain mRNA levels and 
immunoglobulin secretion, which could not be blocked by anti-cytokine 
antibodies. In additional molecular studies, we show that OX40L cross-linking 
results in the down-regulation of the transcription factor BSAP. This, in turn, 
leads to a change in the in vivo binding pattern of the immunoglobulin heavy 
chain gene 3' alpha enhancer, suggesting its activation. This effect may thus be 
one mechanism for OX40-induced increase in immunoglobulin secretion. In 
conclusion, our data suggest that the OX40-OX40L interaction is a novel pathway 
in T cell-dependent B cell proliferation and differentiation.
