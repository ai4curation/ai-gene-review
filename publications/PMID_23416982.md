MicroRNAs are increasingly being recognized as oncogenes and tumor suppressors 
in cancer. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) is an established oncomiR in breast cancer and 
regulates several pro-oncogenic pathways. In light of this, Chiang's group has 
discovered a novel pathway regulated by miR-155. MiR-155 directly targets the 
VHL tumor suppressor and, by doing so, promotes the activity of HIF 
transcription factors and angiogenesis. This pathway appears to be particularly 
relevant in triple-negative breast cancer.

Abstract

MicroRNAs are increasingly being recognized as oncogenes and tumor
suppressors in cancer. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) is an established oncomiR in
breast cancer and regulates several pro-oncogenic pathways. In light of this,
Chiangâ€™s group has discovered a novel pathway regulated by miR-155.
MiR-155 directly targets the VHL tumor suppressor and, by doing so, promotes the
activity of HIF transcription factors and angiogenesis. This pathway appears to
be particularly relevant in triple-negative breast cancer.
