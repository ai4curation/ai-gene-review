Nephritogenic glycoprotein. IX. Plasma Zn-alpha2-glycoprotein as a second source 
of nephritogenic glycoprotein in urine.

Shibata S, Miura K.

Glomerular basement membrane (GBM) damage has been considered as the only source 
of the nephritogenic glycoprotein excreted in urine. However, in the course of 
our investigation on the glycoprotein or glycopeptide isolated from the urine of 
a disease group seldom affected with GBM damage, it appeared that a second 
source of the nephritogenic glycoprotein excreted in the urine is in blood 
plasma; that is, in Zn-alpha2-glycoprotein. Zn-alpha2-glycoprotein is the only 
plasma protein which has a common determinant with nephritogenic urinary 
glycoprotein or glycopeptides. It was proposed that plasma 
Zn-alpha2-glycoprotein may play the role of a carrier protein of the 
nephritogenic renal glycoprotein.
