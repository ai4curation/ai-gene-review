Generating a catalogue of sperm nuclear proteins is an important first step 
towards the clarification of the function of the paternal chromatin transmitted 
to the oocyte upon fertilization. With this goal, sperm nuclei were obtained 
through CTAB treatment and isolated to over 99.9% purity without any tail 
fragments, acrosome or mitochondria as assessed by optical microscopy and 
transmission electron microscopy. The nuclear proteins were extracted and 
separated in 2-D and 1-D gels and the 2-D spots and 1-D bands were excised and 
analysed to identify the proteins through LC-MS/MS. With this approach, 403 
different proteins have been identified from the isolated sperm nuclei. The most 
abundant family of proteins identified are the histones, for which several novel 
members had not been reported previously as present in the spermatogenic cell 
line or in the human mature spermatozoa. More than half (52.6%) of the proteins 
had not been detected in the previous human whole sperm cell proteome reports. 
Of relevance, several chromatin-related proteins, such as zinc fingers and 
transcription factors, so far not known to be associated with the sperm 
chromatin, have also been detected. This provides additional information about 
the nuclear proteins that are potentially relevant for epigenetic marking, 
proper fertilization and embryo development.
