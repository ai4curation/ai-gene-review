MDM2 (HDM2) is a ubiquitin ligase that can target the p53 tumor suppressor 
protein for degradation. The RING domain is essential for the E3 activity of 
MDM2, and we show here that the extreme C-terminal tail of MDM2 is also critical 
for efficient E3 activity. Loss of E3 function in MDM2 mutants deleted of the 
C-terminal tail correlated with a failure of these mutants to oligomerize with 
MDM2, or with the related protein MDMX (HDMX). However, MDM2 containing point 
mutations within the C-terminus that inactivated E3 function retained the 
ability to oligomerize with the wild-type MDM2 RING domain and MDMX, and our 
results indicate that oligomers containing both wild-type MDM2 and a C-terminal 
mutant protein retain E3 function both in auto-degradation and degradation of 
p53. Interestingly, the E3 activity of C-terminal point mutants of MDM2 can also 
be supported by interaction with wild-type MDMX, suggesting that MDMX can 
directly contribute to E3 function.

Interestingly, the E3 activity of C-terminal point mutants of MDM2 can also be supported by interaction with wild-type MDMX, suggesting that MDMX can directly contribute to E3 function.

Introduction

The p53 protein functions to inhibit the outgrowth of cells with malignant potential through the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cells that have been stressed by genotoxic and other types of damage ( Vogelstein et al , 2000 ). These activities are key to p53's ability to act as a tumor suppressor, and their loss is an important step in the development of most malignancies. Although these anti-proliferative activities of p53 are beneficial in tumor suppression, they are extremely deleterious to normal growth and development, and several mechanisms exist to keep p53 activity in check during normal proliferation ( Ryan et al , 2001 ). One of these is the control of p53 protein stability, which allows for the maintenance of low levels of p53 protein in unstressed cells and the rapid increase in p53 levels owing to stabilization in response to stress. The degradation of p53 is principally through the proteasome, and a number of ubiquitin ligases have been described that can target the degradation of p53 through this pathway ( Brooks and Gu, 2006 ). One of the most important ubiquitin ligases is MDM2 (also called HDM2), a RING domain E3 that targets a number of proteins, including p53, for degradation. The importance of MDM2 as a regulator of p53 has been demonstrated in a number of systems, where deletion of MDM2 leads to the stabilization and activation of p53 ( Mendrysa et al , 2003 ; Grier et al , 2006 ).

Almost all tumor cells show defects in the p53 pathway, either through mutations within the p53 gene itself or by perturbations in the mechanisms that allow for the activation of p53 in response to stress ( Vousden, 2002 ). Most p53-activating signals result in the stabilization of p53 through inhibition of MDM2, and in several tumor types failure to activate p53 has been associated with a failure to properly inactivate MDM2. This can result from amplification and overexpression of MDM2 ( Momand et al , 1998 ), loss of kinases that phosphorylate p53 ( Brooks and Gu, 2003 ) or MDM2 ( Meek and Knippschild, 2003 ) to inhibit their interaction or function, or from defects in negative regulators of MDM2, such as p14 ARF ( Sharpless, 2005 ). These observations suggest that small molecule inhibitors of MDM2 might be beneficial in the treatment of cancers that retain wild-type p53 but cannot properly activate it ( Buolamwini et al , 2005 ). The successful development of such drugs will depend on a clear understanding of how MDM2 functions to target p53 for degradation.

MDM2 belongs to the RING domain family of E3 ligases, and mutations in the core metal-coordinating residues within the RING domain result in the complete loss of MDM2's E3 function ( Fang et al , 2000 ). In addition to p53, several other proteins are targeted for degradation by MDM2, including MDM2 itself and the MDM2-related protein MDMX (Mdm4 in mice) ( de Graaf et al , 2003 ; Kawai et al , 2003a ; Pan and Chen, 2003 ). While the isolated RING domain can be shown to possess some E3 activity, the ability to degrade p53 also depends on the integrity of other regions of MDM2, such as the central acidic domain ( Argentini et al , 2001 ; Kawai et al , 2003b ; Meulmeester et al , 2003 ). It has been shown that the ability of MDM2 to degrade itself can be separated from the ability to degrade p53, and some forms of genotoxic damage function to stabilize p53 by promoting the auto-degradation of MDM2, and so shifting the balance between the levels of the two proteins ( Stommel and Wahl, 2004 ). Unlike MDM2, MDMX possesses no intrinsic E3 activity, despite a strong similarity between the two proteins within the RING domains ( Jackson and Berberich, 2000 ; Stad et al , 2001 ). However, MDMX can form an interaction with MDM2 through the RING domain ( Sharp et al , 1999 ; Tanimura et al , 1999 ), and whereas at high levels of expression this interaction can inhibit the ability of MDM2 to degrade p53 ( Jackson and Berberich, 2000 ; Stad et al , 2000 ), at physiological levels MDMX has been shown to be important for the negative regulation of p53 ( Parant et al , 2001 ; Migliorini et al , 2002b ). Clearly, the ability of MDMX to bind directly to p53 and inhibit p53's transcriptional activity plays a major role in the negative regulation of p53 by MDMX ( Shvarts et al , 1996 ), and this function of MDMX is independent of MDM2 ( Francoz et al , 2006 ; Xiong et al , 2006 ). The current data most strongly support a model in which MDM2 regulates p53 by targeting it for degradation, whereas MDMX functions by directly inhibiting the transcriptional activity of p53 by binding to its N-terminal transactivation domain ( Marine et al , 2006 ). However, in addition to these independent and synergistic activities of MDM2 and MDMX, there is evidence that interactions between these two proteins also play an important role in their mutual regulation, and thereby the regulation of the p53 response. A large part of this interconnection reflects the regulation of MDMX stability by MDM2. In response to DNA damage, phosphorylation of MDMX enhances the degradation of MDMX by MDM2 ( Chen et al , 2005 )—an effect that may be related to reduced binding to the deubiquitinating enzyme HAUSP ( Meulmeester et al , 2005 ) or an increase in 14-3-3 binding ( Okamoto et al , 2005 ; Lebron et al , 2006 )—leading to the stabilization and activation of p53. MDM2 also promotes the nuclear accumulation of MDMX ( Stad et al , 2001 ; Li et al , 2002 ; Migliorini et al , 2002a ), although MDM2-independent nuclear localization of MDMX is also seen in response to DNA damage ( Li et al , 2002 ; Lebron et al , 2006 ). In addition to the ability of MDM2 to regulate MDMX, there is some evidence that MDMX can function to enhance the ability of MDM2 to degrade p53, either by promoting the E3 activity of MDM2 against both itself and p53 ( Linares et al , 2003 ) or by inhibiting the auto-degradation of MDM2, so allowing sufficient MDM2 accumulation to degrade p53 ( Stad et al , 2001 ; Gu et al , 2002 ). Despite these observations, the overall contribution of MDMX to p53 or MDM2 stability remains unclear. Studies in mice have indicated that an effect of MDMX on p53 stability, through the modulation of MDM2, can be seen in some but not all tissues ( Marine et al , 2006 ).

It is evident that there is a complex and dynamic relationship between MDM2 and MDMX, which is key to the regulation of p53 stability and function. Understanding the functions of these proteins, and how they might interact with each other, will be critical for exploiting them as potential therapeutic targets. Here, we identify a new region in the extreme C-terminus of MDM2 and MDMX that plays an important role in regulating MDM2 E3 activity.

Discussion

Although the importance of MDM2 in the regulation of p53 stability and function has been illustrated in many systems, how the E3 ligase activity of MDM2 is regulated and the role (if any) of MDMX in the regulation of MDM2 function are much less well understood. The RING domain of MDM2 is essential for E3 activity, and mutations in this region prevent all E3 activity of MDM2. However, there is clear evidence that the activity of MDM2 can be differentially modulated, and that the auto-degradation activity can be separated from the ability to drive the degradation of p53. For example, the acidic domain in MDM2 has been shown to be important for the ubiquitylation and degradation of p53, although this region is not required for the E3 activity of the RING domain ( Kawai et al , 2003b ; Meulmeester et al , 2003 ). The MDM2-related protein MDMX also plays an important role in the regulation of p53, both by binding directly to p53 and through interaction with MDM2 ( Marine et al , 2006 ). It has been suggested that MDMX can stabilize MDM2 to enhance the degradation of p53, and that MDM2 can negatively regulate MDMX by promoting its degradation. In this study, we show the importance of the extreme C-terminal tail of MDM2 in targeting the degradation of p53, and provide evidence that this region of MDMX can cooperate with MDM2 to promote E3 activity.

Although the isolated RING domain from MDM2 has been shown to retain E3 function, the portions of MDM2 examined in these studies included the short region C-terminal to the end of the RING domain. We show here that deletion of part or all of this C-terminal region inactivates MDM2, possibly because such deletions prevent the formation of RING/RING oligomers. Our observations are strongly supported by the accompanying study ( Poyurovsky et al , submitted ) that also identifies the C-terminal tail as a region critical for both MDM2 oligomerization and E3 activity. The C-terminal deletion mutants of MDM2 also fail to degrade MDMX, with evidence that this correlates with the loss of both MDM2/MDM2 homo-oligomerization and hetero-oligomerization between MDM2 and MDMX. Our observations are strongly supported by a recent study, which presented the solution structure of MDM2 RING domain and suggested that the C-terminal tail forms a part of the interface between two bound RING domains in both the MDM2/MDM2 homo-dimer and the MDM2/MDMX hetero-dimer ( Kostic et al , 2006 ). A similar contribution of the C-terminal-flanking sequences in mediating the RING–RING interaction between cIAP and XIAP has also recently been demonstrated ( Silke et al , 2005 ), suggesting that this is a common mechanism to mediate RING–RING binding. In contrast to the complete deletion of this C-terminal tail, we show that point mutations within this region also perturb the activity of MDM2, but do not detectably affect the RING–RING interaction. Interestingly, the defect in E3 activity exhibited by these mutants appears to be apparent only under conditions where both MDM2 proteins in the oligomer are mutant. Titration experiments suggest that oligomers containing mutant and wild-type MDM2 proteins retain the ability to degrade p53. Although we do not, as yet, understand fully the role of the C-terminus in MDM2 function, previous structural studies have suggested that the tyrosine at position 489 in MDM2 is close to the first metal-coordinating center of the RING domain ( Lai et al , 1998 ), implying that this C-terminal tail folds back into the RING domain. We have shown that whereas the substitution of aromatic amino acids is compatible with the retention of function, alterations to other types of amino acids prevents activity, potentially by preventing the interaction between the tail and the RING domain. The fact that only one intact tail is required for function might suggest that the C-terminal tail from one MDM2 molecule in the oligomer interacts with the RING domain of another. Of particular interest is the possibility that modification of one of the critical C-terminal amino acids can inhibit MDM2 function. Phosphorylation of threonine 488 or tyrosine 489 is a clear candidate, although we have, as yet, been unable to detect phosphorylation at these sites of MDM2 (data not shown).

Our observations that oligomers containing wild-type and C-terminal tail mutants of MDM2 can retain E3 activity are further supported by the activity of these mutant MDM2s in the degradation of MDMX. Deletion of the C-terminus of MDM2, which prevents MDM2/MDM2 and MDM2/MDMX interactions, also prevents the formation of an active E3 and so results in an inability to degrade p53, MDM2 or MDMX. However, the C-terminal point mutants of MDM2, which are inactive by themselves but function in complex with wild-type MDM2, retain the ability to degrade MDMX. This, together with our observations that MDMX restores p53 ubiquitylation and degradation by inactive MDM2 C-terminal tail point mutants, suggests that hetero-oligomers between C-terminal tail mutants of MDM2 and wild-type MDMX retain E3 activity.

Taken together, our results are consistent with a model in which MDM2 proteins form an oligomeric complex where the extreme C-terminus of one MDM2 molecule adopts a conformation bringing it into close proximity with the RING domain of another MDM2. Such cross-interaction between the RING and tail domains of MDM2 is required to activate the E3 function and degradation of p53, potentially by allowing E2 binding. A similar model has been developed independently through biochemical analyses that showed a role for the C-terminal tail of MDM2 in supramolecular assembly and E3 activity ( Poyurovsky et al , submitted ). Most interestingly, we have shown that a hetero-oligomer between mutant MDM2 and MDMX also retains the ability to ubiquitylate p53 and target it for degradation, suggesting that the C-terminal tail of MDMX can substitute for that of MDM2, and transactivate the E3 function of an MDM2 protein mutated in this C-terminal domain. These results support the previous observation that MDMX can actively contribute to MDM2's E3 activity in vitro ( Linares et al , 2003 ), rather than simply functioning to stabilize MDM2.

MDM2 is an attractive target for cancer therapeutics, as inhibition of the ability to degrade p53 could result in the activation of p53-dependent cell death in tumor cells that retain wild-type p53. Exciting progress has been made in the identification of small molecules that inhibit the interaction of p53 with MDM2 ( Vassilev et al , 2004 ), and a class of compounds that directly block the E3 activity of MDM2 has also been described ( Yang et al , 2005 ). Our studies suggest that other approaches to inhibition of MDM2 function might also include modulation of the function of the extreme C-terminus of the protein.
