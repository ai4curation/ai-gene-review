Fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF-10), a mitogen for the epithelial cells lining 
the lower urinary tract, has been identified inside urothelial cells, despite 
its acknowledged role as an extracellular signaling ligand. Recombinant 
(r)FGF-10 was determined by fluorescence microscopy optical sectioning to 
localize strongly to nuclei inside cultured urothelial cells. To clarify the 
possible role of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in this translocation, a 
variant of rFGF-10 was constructed which lacked this sequence. rFGF-10(no NLS) 
was found in cytoplasm to a far greater degree than rFGF-10, identifying this 
motif as a possible NLS. Furthermore, this variant displayed poor or 
non-existent bioactivity compared to the wild-type protein in triggering 
mitogenesis in quiescent urothelial cells. The presence of rFGF-10(no NLS) in 
the nucleus suggested that additional interactions were also responsible for the 
nuclear accumulation of rFGF-10. The FGF-10 receptor was observed in cell nuclei 
regardless of the presence or concentration of exogenous rFGF-10 ligand. 
Co-localization studies between rFGF-10 and the FGF-10 receptor revealed a 
strong intracellular relationship between the two. This co-localization was seen 
in nuclei for both rFGF-10 and for rFGF-10(no NLS), although the correlation was 
weaker for rFGF-10(no NLS). These data show that an NLS-like motif of rFGF-10 is 
a partial determinant of its intracellular distribution and is necessary for its 
mitogenic activity. These advancements in the understanding of the activity of 
FGF-10 present an opportunity to engineer the growth factor as a therapeutic 
agent for the healing of damaged urothelial tissue.
