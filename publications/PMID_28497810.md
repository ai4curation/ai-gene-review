Recent studies on enzymes and reader proteins for histone crotonylation support 
a function of histone crotonylation in transcription. However, the enzyme(s) 
responsible for histone decrotonylation (HDCR) remains poorly defined. Moreover, 
it remains to be determined if histone crotonylation is physiologically 
significant and functionally distinct from or redundant to histone acetylation. 
Here we present evidence that class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) rather than 
sirtuin family deacetylases (SIRTs) are the major histone decrotonylases, and 
that histone crotonylation is as dynamic as histone acetylation in mammalian 
cells. Notably, we have generated novel HDAC1 and HDAC3 mutants with impaired 
HDAC but intact HDCR activity. Using these mutants we demonstrate that selective 
HDCR in mammalian cells correlates with a broad transcriptional repression and 
diminished promoter association of crotonylation but not acetylation reader 
proteins. Furthermore, we show that histone crotonylation is enriched in and 
required for self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells.
