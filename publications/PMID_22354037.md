Autophagy is a catabolic process by which cytoplasmic components are sequestered 
and transported by autophagosomes to lysosomes for degradation, enabling 
recycling of these components and providing cells with amino acids during 
starvation. It is a highly regulated process and its deregulation contributes to 
multiple diseases. Despite its importance in cell homeostasis, autophagy is not 
fully understood. To find new proteins that modulate starvation-induced 
autophagy, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen in a stable human cell line 
expressing GFP-LC3, the marker-protein for autophagosomes. Using stringent 
validation criteria, our screen identified nine novel autophagy regulators. 
Among the hits required for autophagosome formation are SCOC (short coiled-coil 
protein), a Golgi protein, which interacts with fasciculation and elongation 
protein zeta 1 (FEZ1), an ULK1-binding protein. SCOC forms a 
starvation-sensitive trimeric complex with UVRAG (UV radiation resistance 
associated gene) and FEZ1 and may regulate ULK1 and Beclin 1 complex activities. 
A second candidate WAC is required for starvation-induced autophagy but also 
acts as a potential negative regulator of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The 
identification of these novel regulatory proteins with diverse functions in 
autophagy contributes towards a fuller understanding of autophagosome formation.
