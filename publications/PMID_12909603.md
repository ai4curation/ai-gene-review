The purpose of the present study was to determine whether endogenous factor(s) 
contributes to the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) during the early 
developmental stages of rat skeletal muscles. HSP72 was expressed in both the 
soleus and plantaris muscles at embryonic day 22 (E22). On the basis of myosin 
heavy chain (MHC) immunohistochemistry, HSP72 was specifically expressed in slow 
type I fibers in both muscles. These slow fibers were observed throughout the 
entire cross section of the soleus muscle and only in the deep region (close to 
the bone) of the plantaris muscle. These results indicate that the expression of 
HSP72 is related to endogenous factors associated with type I fibers, because 
E22 rats have minimal exogenous influences and the soleus and plantaris muscles 
of E22 rats have similar metabolic and contractile profiles at this stage of 
development. We then examined the changes in HSP72 and heat shock cognate (HSC) 
73 in the same two muscles from E22 to postnatal day 56 via Western blotting. 
The level of HSP72 in the soleus muscle gradually increased in parallel with the 
increment in the type I MHC isoform. Compared with the soleus, only a small 
amount of HSP72 could be detected in the plantaris muscle throughout the 
developmental period. For both muscles, HSC73 reached levels observed in adult 
muscles at postnatal day 3, and these levels were unchanged thereafter. These 
results indicate that the expression of HSP72, but not HSC73, is influenced by 
both endogenous and exogenous factors during the embryonic and early 
developmental periods.
