Arginine (R)-based ER localization signals are sorting motifs that confer 
transient ER localization to unassembled subunits of multimeric membrane 
proteins. The COPI vesicle coat binds R-based signals but the molecular details 
remain unknown. Here, we use reporter membrane proteins based on the proteolipid 
Pmp2 fused to GFP and allele swapping of COPI subunits to map the recognition 
site for R-based signals. We show that two highly conserved stretches--in the 
beta- and delta-COPI subunits--are required to maintain Pmp2GFP reporters 
exposing R-based signals in the ER. Combining a deletion of 21 residues in 
delta-COP together with the mutation of three residues in beta-COP gave rise to 
a COPI coat that had lost its ability to recognize R-based signals, whilst the 
recognition of C-terminal di-lysine signals remained unimpaired. A homology 
model of the COPI trunk domain illustrates the recognition of R-based signals by 
COPI.
