Abstract

Plant cells are totipotent and competent to regenerate from differentiated organs. It has been known for six decades that cytokinin-rich medium induces shoot regeneration from callus cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. The homeodomain transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) is essential for de novo establishment of the shoot stem cell niche in Arabidopsis thaliana . We found that WUS-positive (WUS + ) cells mark the shoot progenitor region during regeneration. A cytokinin-rich environment initially promotes the removal of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 at the WUS locus in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Subsequently, the B-type ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORs (ARRs) ARR1, ARR2, ARR10, and ARR12, which function as transcriptional activators in the cytokinin signaling pathway, spatially activate WUS expression through binding with microRNA165/6-targeted HD-ZIP III transcription factors. Thus, our results provide important insights into the molecular framework for cytokinin-directed shoot regeneration and reveal a two-step mechanism for de novo activation of WUS .

INTRODUCTION

Plants can be regenerated through somatic embryogenesis or de novo organogenesis ( Birnbaum and Sánchez Alvarado, 2008 ; Duclercq et al., 2011 ; Sugimoto et al., 2011 ; Su and Zhang, 2014 ; Gaillochet and Lohmann, 2015 ). De novo organogenesis refers to the in vitro formation of shoots or roots from cultured explants. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana , callus, a pluripotent cell mass, forms from explants on auxin-rich callus-inducing medium ( CIM ). Subsequently, culturing the callus on cytokinin-rich shoot-inducing medium ( SIM ) induces the differentiation of the callus into shoots ( Skoog and Miller, 1957 ; Duclercq et al., 2011 ; Cheng et al., 2013 ). It is well known that de novo shoot regeneration is dependent on cell division progression ( Che et al., 2007 ), the acquisition of organogenetic competence on CIM ( Che et al., 2007 ; Atta et al., 2009 ; Kareem et al., 2015 ), the partition of auxin and cytokinin responses ( Gordon et al., 2007 ), cytokinin signal perception ( Ishida et al., 2008 ; Cheng et al., 2013 ), and stem cell commitment ( Che et al., 2002 ; Cheng et al., 2013 ; Ikeuchi et al., 2016 ).

Plant stem cells reside in stem cell niches, which produce signals that regulate the balance between self-renewal and the generation of daughter cells that differentiate into new tissues ( Barton, 2010 ; Ha et al., 2010 ; Aichinger et al., 2012 ; Heidstra and Sabatini, 2014 ; Holt et al., 2014 ; ten Hove et al., 2015 ). In the shoot apical meristem ( SAM ), the expression of the WUS gene defines the organizing center ( OC ), and the WUS protein acts as a nonautonomous signal to maintain stem cells by activating CLAVATA3 ( CLV3 ) ( Schoof et al., 2000 ; Yadav et al., 2011 ; Daum et al., 2014 ; Bustamante et al., 2016 ). The cytokinin response is mediated by B-type ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORs (ARRs), which activate a number of cytokinin-responsive genes including A-type ARRs ( To and Kieber, 2008 ). There is evidence demonstrating that cytokinin plays important roles in the maintenance of the SAM and WUS expression ( Gaillochet et al., 2015 ). For example, a cytokinin response maximum and expression of the cytokinin receptor His Kinase4 both localize to the OC ( Chickarmane et al., 2012 ). This local cytokinin biosynthesis acts as a positional cue for OC and WUS expression within the stem cell niche ( Kurakawa et al., 2007 ; Gordon et al., 2009 ; Chickarmane et al., 2012 ; Adibi et al., 2016 ). Moreover, WUS represses A-type ARRs , thereby reinforcing WUS expression by increasing cytokinin responses ( Leibfried et al., 2005 ).

In Arabidopsis, four B-type ARR transcription factors, ARR1, ARR2, ARR10, and ARR12, play essential roles in shoot regeneration. Compared with the wild type, the shoot regenerative capacity is impaired in the arr1 arr10 arr12 mutant ( Mason et al., 2005 ; Ishida et al., 2008 ; Zhang et al., 2015 ). The A-type ARRs play opposite roles in shoot regeneration. The regeneration capacity is markedly reduced when A-type ARRs such as ARR7 or ARR15 are overexpressed ( Buechel et al., 2010 ). However, how WUS is de novo activated by cytokinin is largely elusive.

Our knowledge of de novo shoot regeneration is mostly derived from snapshot images of fixed samples. Studies that use fixed samples lack real-time temporal information such as the length of the cell cycle in specific cell types; therefore, how SAM fate is spatiotemporally specified remains unclear at both the cellular and molecular levels. In this study, using time-lapsed imaging and genetic analyses, we showed that WUS-positive (WUS + ) cells mark the shoot progenitor region during shoot regeneration in Arabidopsis. We further demonstrated that the WUS locus is subjected to epigenetic reprogramming upon transfer to cytokinin-rich SIM . Moreover, we found that B-type ARRs (ARR1, ARR2, ARR10, and ARR12) interact with microRNA165/6 (miR165/6)-targeted HD-ZIP III transcription factors and that this complex spatially induces WUS expression within the callus.

DISCUSSION

In vitro shoot regeneration is crucial for both plant developmental biology investigations and plant biotechnology. Although a key molecular pathway that maintains the stem cell niche in the SAM and the signaling cascade that tranduces cytokinin signals have been identified, less is known about how SAM is de novo committed by cytokinin. Our results provide some important insights into the molecular framework for cytokinin-directed de novo shoot regeneration.
