Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, or Batten disease, is an autosomal 
recessive disorder characterized by progressive loss of motor and cognitive 
functions, loss of vision, progressively severe seizures, and death. The disease 
is associated with mutations in the gene CLN3, which encodes a novel 438 amino 
acid protein, the function of which is currently unknown. Protein secondary 
structure prediction programs suggest that the CLN3 protein has five to seven 
membrane-spanning domains (MSDs). To distinguish among a number of hypothetical 
models for the membrane topology of CLN3 we used in vitro translation of native, 
Flag epitope-labeled and glycosylation site-mutated CLN3 protein in the presence 
or absence of canine pancreatic microsomes. These were immunoprecipitated using 
antibodies specific for Flag or peptide sequences within CLN3 or left untreated. 
The results indicate that CLN3 contains five MSDs, an extracellular/intraluminal 
amino-terminus, and a cytoplasmic carboxy-terminus.
