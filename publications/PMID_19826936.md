Methamphetamine (MA) is an addictive psycho-stimulant and the illicit use of the 
drug is escalating. In the present study, we examined protein expression 
profiles in the rat frontal cortex exposed to a total of eight MA injections (1 
mg/kg, intraperitoneal) using 2-DE based proteomics. We investigated protein 
changes occurring in both the cytosolic fraction and the membrane fraction. 2-DE 
analysis resulted in 62 cytosolic and 44 membrane protein spots that were 
differentially regulated in the frontal cortex of rats exposed to MA when 
compared to control animals. Of these spots, 47 cytosolic and 42 membrane 
proteins were identified respectively, using ESI-Quad-TOF, which included 
ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (UCH-L1), beta-synuclein, 78 
kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP 78), gamma-enolase, dihydropyrimidase-related 
protein 2 (DRP 2), complexin 2 and synapsin II. These proteins are associated 
with protein degradation, redox regulation, energy metabolism, cellular growth, 
cytoskeletal modifications and synaptic function. Proteomic research may be 
useful in exploring the complex underlying molecular mechanisms of MA 
dependence.
