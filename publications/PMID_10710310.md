Chk2 is a protein kinase that is activated in response to DNA damage and may 
regulate cell cycle arrest. We generated Chk2-deficient mouse cells by gene 
targeting. Chk2-/- embryonic stem cells failed to maintain 
gamma-irradiation-induced arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Chk2-/- 
thymocytes were resistant to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Chk2-/- cells were 
defective for p53 stabilization and for induction of p53-dependent transcripts 
such as p21 in response to gamma irradiation. Reintroduction of the Chk2 gene 
restored p53-dependent transcription in response to gamma irradiation. Chk2 
directly phosphorylated p53 on serine 20, which is known to interfere with Mdm2 
binding. This provides a mechanism for increased stability of p53 by prevention 
of ubiquitination in response to DNA damage.
