The mammalian translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex comprises four 
transmembrane protein subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum. The complex 
associates with the Sec61 translocon, although its function in vivo remains 
unknown. Here, we show the involvement of the TRAP complex in endoplasmic 
reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). All four subunits are induced 
simultaneously by endoplasmic reticulum stresses from the X-box-binding protein 
1/inositol-requiring 1alpha pathway. RNA interference knockdown of each subunit 
causes disruption of the native complex and significant delay in the degradation 
of various ERAD substrates, including the alpha1-antitrypsin null Hong Kong 
variant (NHK). In a pulse-chase experiment, the TRAP complex associated with NHK 
at a late stage, indicating its involvement in the ERAD pathway rather than in 
biosynthesis of nascent polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, 
the TRAP complex bound preferentially to misfolded proteins rather than 
correctly folded wild-type substrates. Thus, the TRAP complex induced by the 
unfolded protein response pathway might discriminate ERAD substrates from 
correctly folded substrates, accelerating degradation.
