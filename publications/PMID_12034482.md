Cellular 'defense collagens' are produced to launch virus-specific responses to 
clear the invading viruses. Cellular p32, the C1q binding protein is one such 
protein. In this report, we identified the interaction of p32 derived from a 
human lung diploid cell line (WI-38) with rubella virus capsid (RVCP from 
Therien strain) N-terminal 28-amino acid domain, which is conserved among 
several RV strains including the vaccine strains. We further identified that the 
C-terminal 69 aa of the mature p32 is sufficient to interact with the CP. In 
addition, we observed that in three independent Vero 76-derived cell lines 
constitutively overexpressing p32, the RV infectivity was enhanced. Our results 
suggest that RV has evolved a strategy whereby one of its proteins is recruited 
to interact with, and exploit the cellular defense machinery to its advantage.
