Werner syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with premature 
aging and cancer predisposition caused by mutations of the WRN gene. WRN is a 
member of the RecQ DNA helicase family with functions in maintaining genome 
stability. Sir2, an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase, has been proven to extend 
life span in yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans. Mammalian Sir2 (SIRT1) has also 
been found to regulate premature cellular senescence induced by the tumor 
suppressors PML and p53. SIRT1 plays an important role in cell survival promoted 
by calorie restriction. Here we show that SIRT1 interacts with WRN both in vitro 
and in vivo; this interaction is enhanced after DNA damage. WRN can be 
acetylated by acetyltransferase CBP/p300, and SIRT1 can deacetylate WRN both in 
vitro and in vivo. WRN acetylation decreases its helicase and exonuclease 
activities, and SIRT1 can reverse this effect. WRN acetylation alters its 
nuclear distribution. Down-regulation of SIRT1 reduces WRN translocation from 
nucleoplasm to nucleoli after DNA damage. These results suggest that SIRT1 
regulates WRN-mediated cellular responses to DNA damage through deacetylation of 
WRN.
