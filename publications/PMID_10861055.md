Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive disorder originally 
characterized by the clinical triad eczema, thrombocytopenia, and severe 
immunodeficieny, with recurrent bacterial and viral infections, indicating a 
profound immune cell defect. Such altered immune cells include monocytes, 
macrophages, and dendritic cells, which were reported to display disturbed cell 
polarization or chemotaxis. WAS is caused by mutations in the WAS protein 
(WASp), which is thought to organize the actin cytoskeleton through the Arp2/3 
complex. Here we show that the Arp2/3 complex is an integral part of podosomes, 
actin-rich adhesion structures of macrophages, and that WAS macrophages fail to 
organize the Arp2/3 complex into podosomes. We also demonstrate that 
microinjection of a C-terminal acidic stretch of WASp into normal macrophages 
displaces Arp2/3 from podosomes and, in combination with chemoattractant 
stimulation of cells, induces a phenotype resembling the polarization-defective 
phenotype of stimulated WAS macrophages. These findings point to an important 
role of the Arp2/3 complex in polarization and migration of immune cells.
