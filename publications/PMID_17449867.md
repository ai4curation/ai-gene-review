Epe1 is a JmjC domain protein that antagonizes heterochromatization in 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Related JmjC domain proteins catalyze a histone 
demethylation reaction that depends on Fe(II) and alpha-ketoglutarate. However, 
no detectable demethylase activity is associated with Epe1, and its JmjC domain 
lacks conservation of Fe(II)-binding residues. We report that Swi6 recruits Epe1 
to heterochromatin and that overexpression of epe1+, like mutations in silencing 
genes or overexpression of swi6+, upregulates expression of certain genes. A 
significant overlap was observed between the lists of genes that are upregulated 
by overexpression of epe1+ and those that are upregulated by mutations in 
histone deacetylase genes. However, most of the common genes are not regulated 
by Clr4 histone methyltransferase. This suggests that Epe1 interacts with the 
heterochromatin assembly pathway at the stage of histone deacetylation. 
Mutational inactivation of Epe1 downregulates approximately 12% of S. pombe 
genes, and the list of these genes overlaps significantly with the lists of 
genes that are upregulated by mutations in silencing genes and genes that are 
hyperacetylated at their promoter regions in clr6-1 mutants. We propose that an 
interplay between the repressive HDACs activity and Epe1 helps to regulate gene 
expression in S. pombe.
