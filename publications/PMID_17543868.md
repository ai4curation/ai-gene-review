The yeast Vps27/Hse1 complex and the homologous mammalian Hrs/STAM complex 
deliver ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins to the ESCRT endosomal-sorting 
pathway. The Vps27/Hse1 complex directly binds to ubiquitinated transmembrane 
proteins and recruits both ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes. We 
have solved the crystal structure of the core responsible for the assembly of 
the Vps27/Hse1 complex at 3.0 A resolution. The structure consists of two 
intertwined GAT domains, each consisting of two helices from one subunit and one 
from the other. The two GAT domains are connected by an antiparallel coiled 
coil, forming a 90 A-long barbell-like structure. This structure places the 
domains of Vps27 and Hse1 that recruit ubiquitinated cargo and deubiquitinating 
enzymes close to each other. Coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations of the 
Vps27/Hse1 complex on a membrane show how the complex binds cooperatively to 
lipids and ubiquitinated membrane proteins and acts as a scaffold for 
ubiquitination reactions.
