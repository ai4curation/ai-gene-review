Retromer is a membrane-associated heteropentameric coat complex that functions 
in the endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate 
receptor, the Wntless protein and other membrane proteins of physiological 
significance. Retromer comprises two functional subcomplexes: the 
cargo-selective subcomplex is a trimer of the VPS35, VPS29, VPS26 proteins, 
whereas the sorting nexin proteins, Snx1 and Snx2 function to tubulate the 
endosomal membrane. Unlike the sorting nexins, which contain PtdIns3P-binding PX 
domains, the cargo-selective VPS35/29/26 complex has no lipid-binding domains 
and its recruitment to the endosomal membrane remains mechanistically 
uncharacterised. In this study we show that the VPS35/29/26 complex interacts 
with the small GTPase Rab7 and requires Rab7 for its recruitment to the 
endosome. We show that the Rab7K157N mutant that causes the peripheral 
neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, does not interact with the VPS35/29/26 
complex, resulting in a weakened association with the membrane. We have also 
identified a novel retromer-interacting protein, TBC1D5, which is a member of 
the Rab GAP family of proteins that negatively regulates VPS35/29/26 recruitment 
and causes Rab7 to dissociate from the membrane. We therefore propose that 
recruitment of the cargo-selective VPS35/29/26 complex is catalysed by Rab7 and 
inhibited by the Rab-GAP protein, TBC1D5.
