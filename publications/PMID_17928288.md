The D7-related (D7r) proteins of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae have been 
shown to bind the biogenic amines serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine with 
high affinity. One member of the group (D7r1 or hamadarin) has also been shown 
to have an anticoagulant/antikinin activity. To understand the mechanistic 
details of its antihemostatic/anti-inflammatory effects, we have determined the 
crystal structure of one member of this group, D7r4, along with the structures 
of ligand complexes with serotonin, tryptamine, histamine, and norepinephrine. 
The D7 fold consists of an arrangement of eight alpha-helices stabilized by 
three disulfide bonds. The structure is similar to those of the arthropod 
odorant-binding proteins, a relationship that had been predicted based on 
sequence comparisons. Although odorant-binding proteins commonly have six 
alpha-helices, D7r4 has eight, resulting in significantly different positioning 
and structure of the ligand binding pocket. The pocket itself is lined by 
hydrophobic side chains along with polar and charged groups oriented to form 
hydrogen bonds with the aliphatic amino group and with groups on the aromatic 
portions of the ligands. These structures, along with accompanying mutagenesis 
studies, have allowed us to identify critical residues for biogenic amine 
binding and to predict which members of the large D7 protein family found in 
blood-feeding nematocerous Diptera will function as biogenic amine-binding 
proteins.
