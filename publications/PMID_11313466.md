Nuclear export of 60s ribosomal subunits depends on Xpo1p and requires a nuclear 
export sequence-containing factor, Nmd3p, that associates with the large subunit 
protein Rpl10p.

Nuclear export of ribosomes requires a subset of nucleoporins and the Ran 
system, but specific transport factors have not been identified. Using a large 
subunit reporter (Rpl25p-eGFP), we have isolated several temperature-sensitive 
ribosomal export (rix) mutants. One of these corresponds to the ribosomal 
protein Rpl10p, which interacts directly with Nmd3p, a conserved and essential 
protein associated with 60S subunits. We find that thermosensitive nmd3 mutants 
are impaired in large subunit export. Strikingly, Nmd3p shuttles between the 
nucleus and cytoplasm and is exported by the nuclear export receptor Xpo1p. 
Moreover, we show that export of 60S subunits is Xpo1p dependent. We conclude 
that nuclear export of 60S subunits requires the nuclear export 
sequence-containing nonribosomal protein Nmd3p, which directly binds to the 
large subunit protein Rpl10p.
