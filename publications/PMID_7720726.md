## Abstract

Yeast Vps45p is a Sec1p-like protein required for the consumption of 
vacuole-targeted, post-Golgi transport vesicles.

Over 45 VPS genes (vacuolar protein sorting) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are 
necessary for the correct sorting and delivery of vacuolar hydrolases. Yeast 
strains carrying mutations in a subset of these VPS genes (class D vps mutants) 
are also defective in the segregation of vacuolar material into the developing 
daughter cell and are morphologically characterized by having large central 
vacuoles. The class D VPS gene products, which include a Rab5 homologue 
(VPS21/YPT51) and a syntaxin homologue (PEP12/VPS6), have been proposed to 
function together at a particular step along the vacuolar protein sorting 
pathway. We have cloned another class D VPS gene, VPS45, which is homologous to 
a growing family of genes that encode Sec1p-like proteins. Vps45p is predicted 
to be a hydrophilic protein of 577 amino acids with a molecular mass of 67 kDa. 
Fractionation studies show that Vps45p is a peripheral membrane protein that 
cofractionates with Golgi-like membranes, consistent with Vps45p functioning in 
membrane traffic between the Golgi and the vacuole. Using a 
temperature-sensitive allele of VPS45, we show that inactivation of Vps45p 
causes the rapid accumulation of small (40-60 nm) vesicles and secretion of the 
vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y. Because the entire yeast secretory 
pathway is functional after the temperature-induced inactivation of Vps45p, we 
conclude that the accumulated vesicles represent transport intermediates between 
the Golgi and the vacuole.
