Mammalian cells possess two isoforms of the histone H3-H4 chaperone 
anti-silencing function 1 (Asf1), Asf1a and Asf1b. However to date, whether they

of human Asf1b unparalleled by Asf1a. Strikingly, in cultured cells, both mRNA

Asf1b severely compromises proliferation, leads to aberrant nuclear structures 
and a distinct transcriptional signature. Second, a major physiological

overexpression of Asf1b mRNA correlate with clinical data and disease outcome. 
Together, our results highlight a distribution of tasks between the distinct

Introduction

Our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer has advanced tremendously with the identification of mutations in the genome of tumour cells ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000 ). Yet, while numerous studies support a major role for genetic events in breast cancer susceptibility ( Stratton and Rahman, 2008 ), this genetic contribution alone does not explain the clinical complexity and heterogeneity of breast cancers. Reports of abnormal gene expression (mostly gene silencing) in cancer cells ( Esteller, 2007 ; Jones and Baylin, 2007 ) associated with changes in DNA methylation and aberrant histone post-translational modifications in corresponding promoter regions support the importance of changes in chromatin organization during tumourigenesis. In addition, these kind of approaches can provide useful medical applications as shown with genome-wide changes of specific histone modifications, which are predictive of clinical outcome in specific cancers ( Kurdistani, 2007 ). Thus, to analyze how particular alterations in chromatin organization and histone dynamics occur in cancer offers important avenues for a basic understanding of tumourigenesis leading to possible medical applications.

Histones represent a highly conserved set of proteins, which have a central role in the functional organization of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin. They organize as an octamer comprising (H3–H4–H2A–H2B) 2 histones around which about 146 bp of DNA is wrapped to form the basic unit of chromatin, the core nucleosome ( Kornberg, 1977 ). As they exist as variants and can be modified, they provide a large repertoire of information enabling to modulate the chromatin landscape genome wide ( Loyola and Almouzni, 2007 ). During their entire cellular life, these basic proteins are constantly escorted by a class of proteins called histone chaperones which importance came recently in the limelight ( De Koning et al, 2007 ; Eitoku et al, 2008 ; Ransom et al, 2010 ). Defined as key actors involved in histone transfer without being part of the final product, the nucleosome ( De Koning et al, 2007 ), histone chaperones are involved in all aspects of histone dynamics including chromatin assembly and disassembly processes ( Polo and Almouzni, 2006 ). Particular histone chaperones have been assigned to promote specific chromatin assembly pathways. For example, the deposition of the H3.1–H4 replicative histones coupled to DNA replication or repair is mainly ensured by chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1), a complex of three polypeptides RbAp48, p60 and p150 in mammals, as part of an assembly line ( Smith and Stillman, 1989 ; Gaillard et al, 1996 ; Tagami et al, 2004 ). The H3.3–H4 replacement histones which can assemble independently of DNA synthesis ( Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002 ) involves other chaperones among which Histone Regulator A (HIRA) ( Ray-Gallet et al, 2002 ; Tagami et al, 2004 ) and accompanying partners ( Drane et al, 2010 ; Goldberg et al, 2010 ).

In this study, we focus on the histone H3–H4 chaperone anti-silencing function 1 (Asf1) whose importance for S-phase progression has been demonstrated in various organisms ( Tyler et al, 1999 ; Sanematsu et al, 2006 ; Schulz and Tyler, 2006 ; Groth et al, 2007 ). First identified by its ability to derepress transcriptional silencing when overexpressed in yeast ( Le et al, 1997 ), Asf1 has been implicated in transcriptional regulation in yeast ( Li et al, 2007 ; Mousson et al, 2007 ) and Drosophila ( Goodfellow et al, 2007 ; Moshkin et al, 2009 ). However, while a single isoform of Asf1 is present in yeast, mammals possess two Asf1 isoforms, called Asf1a and Asf1b. They show a highly conserved N-terminus which provides a binding interface with the H3.1–H4 replicative histones or the H3.3–H4 replacement histones ( De Koning et al, 2007 ), and a less characterized divergent C-terminal part ( Supplementary Figure S1A ). Both Asf1 isoforms synergize with CAF-1 in the replication-coupled assembly pathway via a direct interaction with the mid-subunit CAF-1 p60 ( Tyler et al, 1999 ; Mello et al, 2002 ; Tagami et al, 2004 ). Collectively, the two human Asf1 isoforms have also been implicated in buffering the transient overload of replicative histone H3.1 that accumulates during replication stress ( Groth et al, 2005 ), as well as in the control of S-phase progression ( Groth et al, 2007 ). In the latter case, human Asf1a and Asf1b, via a histone bridge, interact with the MCM2–7 complex of proteins, the putative helicase that unwinds DNA ahead of the replication fork, and thus are critical for handling histones at replication forks ( Groth et al, 2007 ; Jasencakova et al, 2010 ). Importantly, under the combined depletion of both Asf1 isoforms, major defects in S-phase progression are observed. Thus, both Asf1a and Asf1b can potentially contribute to the replicative function and possibly substitute for one another. However, this does not exclude the existence of a task distribution in various physiological contexts and different regulatory means to control their use. A hint in this direction is provided by the higher expression of Asf1b in human tissues such as thymus or testis ( Umehara and Horikoshi, 2003 ). Intriguingly, in yeast depleted of endogenous Asf1, the introduction of human Asf1a is best able to rescue defects in the DNA damage response, while human Asf1b best compensates for the growth defects and the sensitivity to replicational stress ( Tamburini et al, 2005 ). In mammalian cells, Asf1a interacts specifically with HIRA connecting this particular isoform with the replication-independent assembly pathway ( Daganzo et al, 2003 ; Tagami et al, 2004 ; Tang et al, 2006 ). Furthermore, Asf1a is required for senescence-associated cell cycle exit together with HIRA ( Zhang et al, 2005 ). Taken together, these data emphasize common molecular properties of Asf1 isoforms in order to handle H3–H4 histone pools, yet, they also reveal a potential for distinct functions and for distribution of tasks between the two Asf1 isoforms in different physiological contexts.

One particular physiological context highly relevant in human disease such as breast cancer is proliferation. The example of CAF-1 p60 as a proliferation marker with diagnostic value in breast cancer ( Polo et al, 2004 ), underlines that histone chaperones represent appealing candidates for identifying tumour cells with a high-replicative potential. In addition, they might represent new classifiers that could provide better guidelines for the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy in such a complex disease that is breast cancer.

Here, we investigate the specific task distribution of the two human Asf1 isoforms, Asf1a and Asf1b, in relation to cell proliferation and tumourigenesis. We used model cell lines, to study the expression pattern and the impact of the specific depletion of Asf1 isoforms in relation to proliferation. As a further means to explore the physiological relevance of our results, we analysed a selection of breast tumour samples for which a long-term patient follow-up was available. Taken together, we reveal here a distribution of the tasks between each Asf1 isoform and assign a key role for Asf1b in proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Asf1b can be used as a new proliferation marker, which is relevant for both the diagnosis and the prognosis in breast cancer and is potentially a new target for drug discovery in breast cancer.

Discussion

While yeast presents a single form of the Asf1 histone H3–H4 chaperone, in many multicellular organisms, including plants or mammals, there are two distinct isoforms whose specific individual functions have remained unexplored. Here, we investigated their respective implication in cell proliferation. In cultured cells, we reveal a unique proliferation-dependent expression pattern of Asf1b, not shared by Asf1a, that enables to distinguish tumoral from non-tumoral derived breast cancer cells. Depletion of Asf1b shows the prominent role of this isoform for cell proliferation, with a distinct transcriptional impact genome-wide and cellular abnormalities reminiscent of mitotic defects. Moreover, using a selection of samples from early stage breast tumours derived from patients, we demonstrate for the first time the clinical relevance of Asf1b as a proliferation marker of prognostic value in early stage breast cancers.
