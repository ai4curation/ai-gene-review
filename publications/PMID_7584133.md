CD28 costimulatory signals are required for lymphokine production and T cell 
proliferation. CD28 signaling recruits the intracellular proteins PI 3-kinase, 
ITK, and GRB-2/SOS. PI 3-kinase and GRB-2/SOS bind the CD28 cytoplasmic pYMNM 
motif via SH2 domains. We generated CD28 pYMNM mutants and found that Y191 
mutation (Y191CD28F) disrupted both PI 3-kinase and GRB-2 binding, while M194 
mutation (M194CD28C) disrupted only PI 3-kinase binding. Both mutants still 
bound ITK. We have assessed the ability of these selective mutants to support 
IL-2 production upon TCR zeta/CD3 ligation in the presence of CHO-CD86 (B7-2) 
cells. Both Y191CD28F and M194CD28C mutants failed to generate IL-2. These data 
directly implicate PI 3-kinase in CD28-mediated costimulation leading to IL-2 
secretion. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, induced cell apoptosis and 
as such was unsuitable for use in this study.
