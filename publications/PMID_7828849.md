Programmed cell death is often triggered by the interaction of some cytokines 
with their cell surface receptors. Here, we report that gamma interferon 
(IFN-gamma) induced in HeLa cells a type of cell death that had cytological 
characteristics of programmed cell death. In this system we have identified two 
novel genes whose expression was indispensable for the execution of this type of 
cell death. The rescue was based on positive growth selection of cells after 
transfection with antisense cDNA expression libraries. The antisense 
RNA-mediated inactivation of the two novel genes protected the cells from the 
IFN-gamma-induced cell death but not from the cytostatic effects of the cytokine 
or from a necrotic type of cell death. One of those genes (DAP-1) is expressed 
as a single 2.4-kb mRNA that codes for a basic, proline-rich, 15-kD protein. The 
second is transcribed into a single 6.3-kb mRNA and codes for a unique 160-kD 
calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase (DAP kinase) that carries eight 
ankyrin repeats. The expression levels of the two DAP proteins were selectively 
reduced by the corresponding antisense RNAs. Altogether, it is suggested that 
these two novel genes are candidates for positive mediators of programmed cell 
death that is induced by IFN-gamma.
