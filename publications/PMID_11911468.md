The human ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) functions as a component of the 40S 
subunit and as a UV DNA repair endonuclease. This enzyme has an endonuclease 
activity for UV-irradiated and oxidatively damaged DNAs. DNA repair 
endonucleases recognize a variety of UV and oxidative base damages in DNA from 
E. coli to human cells. E. coli endonuclease III is especially known to have an 
iron-sulfur cluster as a co-factor. Here, we tried an electron paramagnetic 
resonance (EPR) method for the first time to observe a known iron-sulfur cluster 
signal from E. coli endonuclease III that was previously reported. We compared 
it to the human rpS3 in order to find out whether or not the human protein 
contains an iron-sulfur cluster. As a result, we succeeded in observing a Fe EPR 
signal that is apparently from an iron-sulfur cluster in the human rpS3 
endonuclease. The EPR signal from the human enzyme, consisting of three major 
parts, is similar to that from the E. coli enzyme, but it has a distinct extra 
peak.
