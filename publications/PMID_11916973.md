The ethylene receptor ETR1 of Arabidopsis contains transmembrane domains 
responsible for ethylene binding and membrane localization. Sequence analysis 
does not provide information as to which membrane system of the plant cell ETR1 
is localized. Examination by aqueous two-phase partitioning, sucrose 
density-gradient centrifugation, and immunoelectron microscopy indicates that 
ETR1 is predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Localization of 
ETR1 showed no change following a cycloheximide chase. Ethylene binding by ETR1 
did not affect localization to the endoplasmic reticulum, based upon analysis of 
plants treated with the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane- 1-carboxylic 
acid and by examination of a mutant receptor that does not bind ethylene. 
Determinants within the amino-terminal half of ETR1 are sufficient for targeting 
to and retention at the endoplasmic reticulum. These data support a central role 
of the plant endoplasmic reticulum in hormone perception and signal 
transduction.
