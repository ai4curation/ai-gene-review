A family of HEAT-repeat containing ribosome synthesis factors was previously 
identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We report the detailed characterization 
of two of these factors, Utp10 and Utp20, which were initially identified as 
components of the small subunit processome. Coprecipitation analyses confirmed 
the association of Utp10 and Utp20 with U3 snoRNA and the early pre-rRNA 
processing intermediates. Particularly strong association was seen with aberrant 
processing intermediates, which may help target these RNAs for degradation. 
Genetic depletion of either protein inhibited the early pre-rRNA processing 
steps in 18S rRNA maturation but had little effect on pre-rRNA transcription or 
synthesis of the 25S or 5.8S rRNAs. The absence of the poly(A) polymerase Trf5, 
a component of the TRAMP5 complex and exosome cofactor, led to stabilization of 
the aberrant 23S RNA in strains depleted of Utp10 or Utp20. In the case of 
Utp10, 20S pre-rRNA synthesis was also modestly increased by this loss of 
surveillance activity.
