The cyclin D-dependent kinase is a critical mediator of mitogen-dependent G1 
phase progression in mammalian cells. Given the high incidence of cyclin D1 
overexpression in human neoplasias, the nature and complexity of cyclin D 
complexes in vivo have been subjects of intense interest. Besides its catalytic 
partner, the nature and complexity of cyclin D complexes in vivo remain 
ambiguous. To address this issue, we purified native cyclin D1 complexes from 
proliferating mouse fibroblasts by affinity chromatography and began to identify 
and functionally characterize the associated proteins. In this report, we 
describe the identification of Hsc70 and its functional importance for cyclin D1 
and cyclin D1-dependent kinase maturation. We demonstrate that Hsc70 associates 
with newly synthesized cyclin D1 and is a component of a mature, catalytically 
active cyclin D1/CDK4 holoenzyme complex. Our data suggest that Hsc70 promotes 
stabilization of newly synthesized cyclin D1, thereby increasing its 
availability for assembly with CDK4. In addition, our data demonstrate that 
Hsc70 remains bound to cyclin D1 following its assembly with CDK4 and Cip/Kip 
proteins, where it ensures the formation of a catalytically active complex.
