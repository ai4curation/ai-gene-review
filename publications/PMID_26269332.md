The tau protein is central to the etiology of several neurodegenerative 
diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, a subset of frontotemporal dementias, 
progressive supranuclear palsy and dementia following traumatic brain injury, 
yet the proteins it interacts with have not been studied using a systematic 
discovery approach. Here we employed mild in vivo crosslinking, isobaric 
labeling, and tandem mass spectrometry to characterize molecular interactions of 
human tau in a neuroblastoma cell model. The study revealed a robust association 
of tau with the ribonucleoproteome, including major protein complexes involved 
in RNA processing and translation, and documented binding of tau to several heat 
shock proteins, the proteasome and microtubule-associated proteins. Follow-up 
experiments determined the relative contribution of cellular RNA to the tau 
interactome and mapped interactions to N- or C-terminal tau domains. We further 
document that expression of P301L mutant tau disrupts interactions of the 
C-terminal half of tau with heat shock proteins and the proteasome. The data are 
consistent with a model whereby a higher propensity of P301L mutant tau to 
aggregate may reflect a perturbation of its chaperone-assisted stabilization and 
proteasome-dependent degradation. Finally, using a global proteomics approach, 
we show that heterologous expression of a tau construct that lacks the 
C-terminal domain, including the microtubule binding domain, does not cause a 
discernible shift of the proteome except for a significant direct correlation of 
steady-state levels of tau and cystatin B.
