Defects in human DNA mismatch repair predispose to cancer, but many components 
of the pathway have not been identified. We report here the identification and 
characterization of a novel component required for mismatch repair in human 
cells. A 30-kDa protein was purified to homogeneity by virtue of its ability to 
complement a depleted HeLa extract in repair of mismatched heteroduplexes. The 
complementing activity was identified as HMGB1 (the high mobility group box 1 
protein), a non-histone chromatin protein that facilitates protein-protein 
interactions and recognizes DNA damage. Evidence is also presented that HMGB1 
physically interacts with MutSalpha and is required at a step prior to the 
excision of mispaired nucleotide in mismatch repair.
