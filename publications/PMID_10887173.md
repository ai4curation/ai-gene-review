14-3-3 proteins bind their targets through a specific 
serine/threonine-phosphorylated motif present on the target protein. This 
binding is a crucial step in the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of various 
key proteins involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. We report 
that treatment of COS-7 cells with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A induces 
association of 14-3-3 with a 55-kDa protein, identified as the intermediate 
filament protein vimentin. Association of vimentin with 14-3-3 depends on 
vimentin phosphorylation and requires the phosphopeptide-binding domain of 
14-3-3. The region necessary for binding to 14-3-3 is confined to the vimentin 
amino-terminal head domain (amino acids 1-96). Monomeric forms of 14-3-3 do not 
bind vimentin in vivo or in vitro, indicating that a stable complex requires the 
binding of a 14-3-3 dimer to two sites on a single vimentin polypeptide. The 
calyculin A-induced association of vimentin with 14-3-3 in vivo results in the 
displacement of most other 14-3-3 partners, including the protooncogene Raf, 
which nevertheless remain capable of binding 14-3-3 in vitro. Concomitant with 
14-3-3 displacement, calyculin A treatment blocks Raf activation by EGF; 
however, this inhibition is completely overcome by 14-3-3 overexpression in vivo 
or by the addition of prokaryotic recombinant 14-3-3 in vitro. Thus, 
phosphovimentin, by sequestering 14-3-3 and limiting its availability to other 
target proteins can affect intracellular signaling processes that require 
14-3-3.
