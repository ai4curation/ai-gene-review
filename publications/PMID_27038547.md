MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). 
Recently, it has been reported that miR-199a-5p participates in the progression 
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ventricular hypertrophy and heart 
failure. However, the roles of miR-199a-5p in PAH are still unclear. In the 
present study, miR-199a-5p was investigated in PAH rat models and in human 
pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMCs) and endothelial cells (HPAECs). 
The expression of miR-199a-5p was significantly increased following PAH 
induction, and anti-miR-199a-5p could increase the nitric oxide (NO) level and 
decrease the PAH-induced upregulation of pulmonary artery pressure and right 
ventricular hypertrophy. Moreover, in HPASMCs and HPAECs, miR-199a-5p 
overexpression could inhibit the level of NO and promote the concentration of 
Ca(2+), but anti-miR-199a-5p showed opposite results. Further analysis 
demonstrated that miR-199a-5p attenuated the expression of Smad3. Importantly, 
Smad3 was confirmed to be the target gene of miR-199a-5p using dual-luciferase 
reporter assay. Mechanism analyses revealed that the downregulation of NO and 
the upregulation of Ca(2+) caused by miR-199a-5p were all reversed by Smad3 
overexpression in HPASMCs and HPAECs. Moreover, in PAH model, Smad3, p-Smad3 and 
Smad4 were all downregulated in lung tissues, and SIS3 (Smad3 inhibitor) could 
reverse the effects of anti-miR-199a-5p in PAH rats. Our date suggest that 
miR-199a-5p may function as a regulator of PAH by targeting Smad3, indicating a 
novel therapeutic strategy for patients with PAH.
