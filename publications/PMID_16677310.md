Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) uses the glyoxalate bypass for intracellular 
survival in vivo. These studies provide evidence that the M. tb malate synthase 
(MS) has adapted to function as an adhesin which binds to laminin and 
fibronectin. This binding is achieved via the unique C-terminal region of the M. 
tb MS. The ability to function as an adhesin necessitates extracellular 
localization. We provide evidence that despite the absence of a 
Sec-translocation signal sequence the M. tb MS is secreted/excreted, and is 
anchored on the cell wall by an undefined mechanism. The MS of Mycobacterium 
smegmatis is cytoplasmic but the M. tb MS expressed in M. smegmatis localizes to 
the cell wall and enhances the adherence of the bacteria to lung epithelial A549 
cells. Antibodies to the C-terminal laminin/fibronectin-binding domain interfere 
with the binding of the M. tb MS to laminin and fibronectin and reduce the 
adherence of M. tb to A549 cells. Coupled to the earlier evidence of in vivo 
expression of M. tb MS during active but not latent infection in humans, these 
studies show that a housekeeping enzyme of M. tb contributes to its 
armamentarium of virulence promoting factors.
