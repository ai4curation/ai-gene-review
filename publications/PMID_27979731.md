The bHLH-PAS transcription factor, Methoprene-tolerant (Met)1, functions as a 
juvenile hormone (JH) receptor and transduces JH signals by directly binding to 
E-box like motifs in the regulatory regions of JH response genes. Nuclear 
localization of Met is crucial for its transcriptional activity. Our previous 
studies have shown that the chaperone protein Hsp83 facilitates JH-induced Met 
nuclear import in Drosophila melanogaster. However, the exact molecular 
mechanisms of Met nuclear transport are not fully elucidated. Using DNA affinity 
chromatography, we have previously detected binding of the nucleoporin Nup358, 
in the presence of JH, to the JH response region (JHRR) sequences isolated from 
the Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1) promoter. Here, we have demonstrated that Nup358 
regulates JH-Hsp83-induced Met nuclear localization. RNAi-mediated knockdown of 
Nup358 expression in Drosophila fat body perturbs Met nuclear transport during 
the 3 h after initiation of wandering, when the JH titer is high. The 
accompanying reduced expression of the transport receptor importin β in Nup358 
RNAi flies could be one of the reasons accounting for Met mislocalization. 
Furthermore, a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain at the N-terminal end of 
Nup358 interacts with Hsp83 and is indispensable for Met nuclear localization. 
Overexpression of the TPR domain in Drosophila fat body prevents Met nuclear 
localization resulting in a decrease in JHRR-driven reporter activity and Kr-h1 
expression. These data show that Nup358 facilitates JH-induced Met nuclear 
transport in a manner dependent on importin β and Hsp83.
