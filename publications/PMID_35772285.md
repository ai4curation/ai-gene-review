A series of potent, selective, and highly permeable human neuronal nitric oxide 
synthase inhibitors (hnNOS) based on the 2-aminopyridine scaffold with a 
shortened amino sidechain is reported. A rapid and simple protocol was developed 
to access these inhibitors in excellent yields. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase 
(nNOS) is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of various neurological 
disorders. The major challenges in designing nNOS inhibitors in humans focus on 
potency, selectivity over other isoforms of nitric oxide synthases (NOSs), and 
blood-brain barrier permeability. In this context, we discovered a promising 
inhibitor, 6-(3-(4,4-difluoropiperidin-1-yl)propyl)-4-methylpyridin-2-amine 
dihydrochloride, that exhibits excellent potency for rat (Ki = 46 nM) and human 
nNOS (Ki = 48 nM), respectively, with 388-fold human eNOS and 135-fold human 
iNOS selectivity. It also displayed excellent permeability (Pe = 17.3 × 10-6 cm 
s-1) through a parallel artificial membrane permeability assay, a model for 
blood-brain permeability. We found that increasing lipophilicity by 
incorporation of fluorine atoms on the backbone of the inhibitors significantly 
increased potential blood-brain barrier permeability. In addition to measuring 
potency, isoform selectivity, and permeability of NOS inhibitors, we also 
explored structure-activity relationships via structures of key inhibitors 
complexed to various isoforms of nitric oxide synthases.

1. Introduction

The gaseous free radical nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as an important cell signaling molecule involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes. 1 – 2 In human physiology, the role of NO is unique and regulates essential processes such as neurotransmission, 3 vasodilation, 4 smooth muscle relaxation, 5 and immune response. 6 In mammals, nitric oxide is produced endogenously through the oxidation of L-arginine to L-citrulline with the help of NADPH and molecular oxygen by three principal nitric oxide synthases (NOSs), namely, neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS). 7 Neuronal NOS (nNOS) catalyzes the oxidation of L-arginine in the central nervous system (CNS) to produce NO, a critical neurotransmitter for neuronal communication. 8 – 10 Endothelial NOS (eNOS) is an isozyme of NOS that reduces blood pressure through relaxation of muscle. 11 Inducible NOS (iNOS), on the other hand, produces cytotoxic NO and is responsible for activating the immune system to destroy pathogens and microorganisms. 12

In the last decade, the excessive production of nitric oxide by nNOS has been recognized as a key player in the induction and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Although the normal activity of producing physiological levels 13 of NO by nNOS is important for neurotransmission, its overproduction is associated with the formation of the extremely reactive oxidant, peroxynitrite (ONOO − ), 14 in the presence of superoxide. nNOS has also been shown to be involved in several chronic neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 15 Parkinson’s disease (PD), 16 Huntington’s disease (HD), 17 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 18 neuronal damage during stroke, 19 as well as chronic headaches. 20 Finally, at high concentrations, NO can cause excessive nitration and/or nitrosylation of proteins, leading to their degradation and misfolding. 21

The three mammalian NOSs show high homology (>50% amino acid identity) and are active only as homodimers. 7 Each monomer of NOS consists of a C-terminal reductase and an N-terminal oxygenase domain connected via a calmodulin-binding region. The C-terminal reductase domain contains the binding sites for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and is responsible for transporting electrons to the iron center of the heme during biosynthesis of NO. 22 The N-terminal oxygenase domain contains the binding sites for noncatalytic zinc (Zn 2+ ), tetrahydrobiopterin (H 4 B), and a heme-containing catalytic active site that binds the substrate, L-Arg. 7 In the active site, NOSs catalyze the oxidation of L-arginine to L-citrulline and release NO in the presence of NADPH and molecular oxygen. This crucial cascade reaction is initiated at the reductase domain by the two-electron donor, NADPH, to the electron acceptor, the iron center of heme in the oxygenase domain, through FAD and FMN with a series of proton transfers in the process. 23

The inhibition of nNOS has shown promise in treating or preventing neuronal damage in animal models. 22 However, eNOS inhibition can cause cardiovascular problems and hypertension, 24 and iNOS inhibition can result in immune defense failure. 25 Therefore, inhibition of nNOS must be selective over the other isoforms to be a viable potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. 7 , 26 – 27 Small molecules that compete with the binding of L-Arg at the active site are one approach to inhibit nNOS. Design of such inhibitors can take advantage of slight but key differences in the active site structures of the three isoforms to build in nNOS selectivity. 28 – 29

A major difficulty in treating central nervous system (CNS) diseases is ineffective drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). 30 – 33 The BBB is located at the interface of the blood vessels and brain tissues and is formed by brain capillary endothelial cells creating a tight junction to protect the brain from circulating xenobiotic molecules. Small molecules account for the vast majority of CNS drugs primarily because of their ability to penetrate the phospholipid membrane of the blood-brain barrier by passive or carrier-mediated mechanisms. 34 In CNS drug development, factors such as: reduced molecular weight (MW < 500 Da; preferably nearer to 350–400 Da); increased lipophilicity (preferably ClogP <5); decreased topological polar surface area (TPSA < 76 Å 2 ; preferably 25–60 Å 2 ); the number of hydrogen bond donors, OH plus NH 2 count (HBD = 5; preferably 3); the number of hydrogen bond acceptors, O plus N atoms (HBA = 10; preferably 7); a reduced number of rotatable bonds (RB < 8; preferably nearer to 4–5); reduced p K a of basic amino groups (p K a 7.5–10.5; preferably near to 8.4); and reduced P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux (ER < 2), are expected to significantly improve blood-brain barrier permeability based on properties of successful CNS drugs. 32 – 33 , 35

In particular, the number of rotatable bonds (NRB) is a direct indication of flexibility of a chemical molecule, and studies have shown that increased rotatable bond count has a negative effect on the permeation rate. 36 Reducing the number of rotatable bonds (NRB) not only improves the permeability rate but also oral bioavailability. Therefore, reducing molecular flexibility by lowering the number of rotatable bonds (NRB) is often an important consideration for improving BBB permeability.

Our laboratories have focused on the development of selective nNOS inhibitors for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases for more than two decades, achieving big milestones in maintaining excellent potency while retaining high selectivity over other NOS isoforms and BBB permeability. 22 , 37 – 40 Our efforts in improving the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of nNOS inhibitors using various medicinal chemistry approaches such as the incorporation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds ( 1 ), 41 suppressing amine basicity ( 2 ), 42 converting to prodrugs ( 3 ), 43 replacement of pharmacophores ( 4–5 ), 44 – 45 introduction of a double-pyridine pharmacophore ( 6 ), 46 incorporation of a pyridine linker ( 7 ), 47 and exchanging the pyridine linker with fluoroaryl ( 8–9 ), 37 – 38 have resulted in considerable improvements in the pharmacokinetic properties of NOS inhibitors ( Figure 1 ).

We recently reported our first generation of nNOS inhibitors containing a 2-aminopyridine scaffold attached to a pyridine linker ( 7 ), which exhibits excellent potency with rat and human nNOS ( K i (rnNOS) = 16 nM; K i (hnNOS) = 13 nM) as well as high selectivity over eNOS (hnNOS/heNOS = 1831). In addition, pharmacokinetic studies of 7 displayed very low cytochrome P450 inhibition, little human microsomal metabolism, and only 20% human plasma protein binding, all favorable properties. However, 7 displayed little or no Caco-2 permeability, predicting poor oral absorption and poor BBB permeability. 47 However, exchanging the pyridine linker for a fluorobenzene ring ( 8 - 9 ) yielded significant improvement in membrane permeability while retaining high inhibitory activity. For example, 8 showed excellent potency and isoform selectivity toward human nNOS ( K i (hnNOS) = 30 nM; hnNOS/heNOS = 2799), but it still displayed a high efflux ratio (ER = 5.9) by a bidirectional Caco-2 permeability assay. 37 Compound 9, with one additional fluorine atom on the fluorobenzene middle linker and an azetidine ring in the tail compared to 8, displayed excellent inhibition for human nNOS ( K i = 23 nM) and high selectivity over human eNOS (hn/he = 956) and human iNOS (hn/hi = 77) along with good brain penetration in PAMPA and Caco-2 permeability assays ( P e = 16.3 × 10 −6 cm s −1 ; P app = 17.0 × 10 −6 cm s −1 , respectively), and also had a lower efflux ratio (ER = 0.8). 38

In continuation with these efforts, we report herein our development and optimization of a rapid and simple protocol for the synthesis of potent, selective, and highly permeable human neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitors based on the 2-aminopyridine scaffold, with the aim of improving cell-membrane permeability without sacrificing potency and isoform selectivity by lowering the number of rotatable bonds (NRB) in our molecules.

We performed several structural modifications to 9 , based on recent X-ray crystallographic analysis, to improve the potency, isoform selectivity, and permeability of the inhibitors ( Figure 2 ). In our earlier reports, we demonstrated that the 2-aminopyridine scaffold was crucial for the key anchoring interactions of nNOS inhibitors with Glu-592 and Glu-597 at the active sites of rat nNOS and human nNOS, respectively. 37 – 38 , 40 , 47 Because of this, we retained the 2-aminopyridine head during further modification of our inhibitors. Structural modifications of this scaffold, especially at the tail amino functionality, was investigated to improve the bioavailability and selectivity of NOS inhibitors. Various strategies of structural modifications were employed to investigate their effect on biological activity. We found that the tail amino functionality is crucial for achieving high isoform selectivity after examining the inhibitory activity of 12 . Therefore, the major modifications in this study focused on exploring the diversity of the tail amino functionality, including increasing lipophilicity, reducing the rigidity of the linker, and modulating the p K a of amine basicity.

First, reduction of the number of rotatable bonds within the molecule was investigated through truncation ( 10–20 ), by disconnecting the middle fluorobenzene linker and reattaching the remaining aliphatic tail amine portion directly to the 2-aminopyridine head. Second, length variation through homologation ( 15–16 ) from three carbons to four carbons between the 2- aminopyridine and tail amino functionality was examined. Third, methylation of the secondary amine to tertiary amine ( 12 ) was carried out in a strategy to improve permeability by reducing the number of H-bond donors. Fourth, increasing the rigidity of the molecule by introducing an alkyne moiety ( 10, 13, 15, 17 and 19 ) between the 2-aminopyridine and the tail amino functionality was carried out to improve permeability. Finally, modulation of the basicity of the amino tail functionality and maximizing the lipophilicity within the molecule ( 17–20 ) was used to improve selectivity and permeability. All synthesized compounds were investigated for their nNOS inhibitory activity and selectivity over eNOS and iNOS. In addition, all inhibitors were examined in a parallel artificial membrane permeability assay for blood-brain barrier permeability (PAMPA−BBB).

3. Conclusion

In summary, a series of potent, selective, and highly permeable human nNOS inhibitors based on the 2-aminopyridine scaffold with a shortened amino sidechain was designed and evaluated. A rapid and simple protocol was developed to access these inhibitors with excellent yields. Compound 20, which has a reduced number of rotatable bonds, had outstanding properties that exhibit excellent potency for rat ( K i = 46 nM) and human nNOS ( K i = 48 nM), respectively, with 388-fold human eNOS and 135-fold human iNOS selectivity. Compound 20 also displayed excellent membrane permeability ( P e = 17.3 × 10 −6 cm s −1 ) through a parallel artificial membrane permeability assay modeling the blood-brain barrier (PAMPA-BBB). We found that addition of fluorine atoms at the backbone of the amine tail of the inhibitors greatly increased membrane permeability, suggesting that lipophilicity will be a key component of clinically useful nNOS inhibitors. Increasing rigidity in the molecule also had an overall positive impact on permeability; however, it also decreased potency and isoform selectivity. Finally, we show that X-ray crystal structures of representative inhibitors, including 20 , bound to NOS isoforms provide excellent interpretations for their properties in potency, isoform selectivity, and permeability.
