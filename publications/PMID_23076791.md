Increased gpdh-1 transcription is required for accumulation of the organic 
osmolyte glycerol and survival of Caenorhabditis elegans during hypertonic 
stress. Our previous work has shown that regulators of gpdh-1 (rgpd) gene 
knockdown constitutively activates gpdh-1 expression. Fifty-five rgpd genes play 
essential roles in translation suggesting that inhibition of protein synthesis 
is an important signal for regulating osmoprotective gene transcription. We 
demonstrate here that translation is reduced dramatically by hypertonic stress 
or knockdown of rgpd genes encoding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and eukaryotic 
translation initiation factors (eIFs). Toxin-induced inhibition of translation 
also activates gpdh-1 expression. Hypertonicity-induced translation inhibition 
is mediated by general control nonderepressible (GCN)-2 kinase signaling and 
eIF-2α phosphoryation. Loss of gcn-1 or gcn-2 function prevents eIF-2α 
phosphorylation, completely blocks reductions in translation, and inhibits 
gpdh-1 transcription. gpdh-1 expression is regulated by the highly conserved 
with-no-lysine kinase (WNK) and Ste20 kinases WNK-1 and GCK-3, which function in 
the GCN-2 signaling pathway downstream from eIF-2α phosphorylation. Our previous 
work has shown that hypertonic stress causes rapid and dramatic protein damage 
in C. elegans and that inhibition of translation reduces this damage. The 
current studies demonstrate that reduced translation also serves as an essential 
signal for activation of WNK-1/GCK-3 kinase signaling and subsequent 
transcription of gpdh-1 and possibly other osmoprotective genes.
