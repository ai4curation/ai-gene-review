TGF-β is a potent inducer of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a 
process involved in tumour invasion. TIF1γ participates in TGF-β signalling. To 
understand the role of TIF1γ in TGF-β signalling and its requirement for EMT, we 
analysed the TGF-β1 response of human mammary epithelial cell lines. A strong 
EMT increase was observed in TIF1γ-silenced cells after TGF-β1 treatment, 
whereas Smad4 inactivation completely blocked this process. Accordingly, the 
functions of several TIF1γ target genes can be linked to EMT, as shown by 
microarray analysis. As a negative regulator of Smad4, TIF1γ could be crucial 
for the regulation of TGF-β signalling. Furthermore, TIF1γ binds to and 
represses the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 promoter, demonstrating a direct 
role of TIF1γ in TGF-β-dependent gene expression. This study shows the molecular 
relationship between TIF1γ and Smad4 in TGF-β signalling and EMT.
