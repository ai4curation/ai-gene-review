The Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 signaling module bridges TCR signaling to the canonical 
IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB pathway. Covalent attachment of regulatory 
ubiquitin chains to Malt1 paracaspase directs TCR signaling to IKK activation. 
Further, the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 was recently suggested to suppress T 
cell activation, but molecular targets for A20 remain elusive. In this paper, we 
show that A20 regulates the strength and duration of the IKK/NF-kappaB response 
upon TCR/CD28 costimulation. By catalyzing the removal of K63-linked ubiquitin 
chains from Malt1, A20 prevents sustained interaction between ubiquitinated 
Malt1 and the IKK complex and thus serves as a negative regulator of inducible 
IKK activity. Upon T cell stimulation, A20 is rapidly removed and paracaspase 
activity of Malt1 has been suggested to cleave A20. Using antagonistic peptides 
or reconstitution of Malt1(-/-) T cells, we show that Malt1 paracaspase activity 
is required for A20 cleavage and optimal IL-2 production, but dispensable for 
initial IKK/NF-kappaB signaling in CD4(+) T cells. However, proteasomal 
inhibition impairs A20 degradation and impedes TCR/CD28-induced IKK activation. 
Taken together, A20 functions as a Malt1 deubiquitinating enzyme and proteasomal 
degradation and de novo synthesis of A20 contributes to balance TCR/CD28-induced 
IKK/NF-kappaB signaling.
