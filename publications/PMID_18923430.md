P58/DNAJc3 defends cells against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Most P58 
molecules are translocated into the ER lumen, and here we report selective and 
stable binding to misfolded proteins by P58's TPR-containing N-terminal domain. 
In vitro, too, P58 binds selectively to a model misfolded protein and challenge 
of that complex with physiological concentrations of the ER lumenal Hsp70-type 
chaperone BiP encourages disassembly. BiP-induced dissociation of P58 from its 
substrate depends on the presence of ATP and on interactions with P58's 
J-domain, which are mediated by invariant residues BiP(R197) and P58(H422). A 
functional J-domain also accelerates dissociation of P58 from a model substrate, 
VSV-G(ts045), on the latter's re-folding in vivo. However, J-domain binding can 
be separated from the ability to promote substrate dissociation by the mutant 
BiP(E201G) and a wild-type J-domain fused ectopically to P58(H422Q) rescues the 
latter's inability to dissociate from substrate in response to BiP and ATP. 
These findings are consistent with a model whereby localized activation of the 
Hsp70-type partner is sufficient to promote substrate handover from the J-domain 
co-chaperone.

Introduction

The high flux of newly synthesized (unfolded) proteins through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of secretory cells renders the latter especially dependent on chaperones that function in the ER. For this reason, secretory cells have heightened activity of the ER unfolded protein response (UPR), which couples the stress imposed by the load of unfolded proteins in the lumen of the organelle (ER stress) to activation of genes that encode chaperones that function in the organelle ( Schroder and Kaufman, 2005 ; Bernales et al , 2006 ).

Surprisingly, one of the genes consistently upregulated by the mammalian UPR was predicted to encode a cytoplasmic protein, P58, which was initially identified as an inhibitor of the cytoplasmically localized kinases PKR ( Barber et al , 1994 ) and PERK ( Yan et al , 2002 ; Van Huizen et al , 2003 ). PERK mediates an adaptive response to ER stress that limits the influx of unfolded proteins into the lumen of the stressed organelle ( Ron and Harding, 2007 ); however, a modulatory function for P58 in the UPR could not readily explain the phenotype of P58 loss of function. In both worms and mice, loss of P58 sensitizes the animals to the consequences of protein misfolding in the ER lumen ( Kapulkin et al , 2005 ; Ladiges et al , 2005 ), which is the opposite phenotype of that predicted from the loss of an inhibitor of PERK. Experiments conducted in an effort to explain the P58 knockout phenotype supported a model whereby P58 functions at the cytosolic face of the translocon ( Oyadomari et al , 2006 ). However, new findings ( Rutkowski et al , 2007 , confirmed here) place P58 predominantly in the lumen of the ER, and therefore suggest a more direct function for the co-chaperone in buffering the load of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen.

Molecular chaperones form transient complexes with hydrophobic residues exposed on extended segments of non-native substrate proteins. P58 (also known as DnaJc3) contains a J-domain found in a large class of co-chaperones that function alongside the Hsp70 family of chaperones. The ability of Hsp70 to bind substrates is tightly regulated by a nucleotide-binding domain that couples ATPase activity to conformational changes that affect the substrate-binding domain ( Szabo et al , 1994 ). In the ATP-bound state, a substrate-binding groove is accessible and substrates associate and dissociate with high ‘on/off' rates, whereas the ADP-bound form stably associates with substrates ( Schmid et al , 1994 ). J-domain co-chaperones (also called Hsp40s) consist of a diverse family of proteins that share a conserved region of ∼70 amino acids, the J-domain, which mediates interactions with partner Hsp70s and markedly stimulates their intrinsically slow rates of ATP hydrolysis ( Liberek et al , 1991 ). A conserved motif consisting of His-Pro-Asp (HPD) found in the J-domain is essential for surface interactions with invariant residues on Hsp70, and mutations of the motif abrogate stimulation of Hsp70 ATPase activity ( Tsai and Douglas, 1996 ; Suh et al , 1998 ; Jiang et al , 2007 ).

Several J-domain co-chaperones have been found to bind hydrophobic residue-rich extended segments of unfolded proteins through a separate substrate-interacting domain ( Sha et al , 2000 ; Rudiger et al , 2001 ; Li et al , 2003 ) and they are thought to subsequently recruit their Hsp70 partners to that substrate through their J-domain. The current model of sequential binding (first by the co-chaperone and then handover of substrate to Hsp70) is supported by the finding that the J-domain's affinity for Hsp70 is markedly enhanced by the presence of ATP in the latter's nucleotide-binding domain ( Wawrzynow and Zylicz, 1995 ). Substrate transfer from the co-chaperone to the chaperone presumably involves J-domain-induced hydrolysis of ATP, and its conversion to ADP, which remains bound. The transfer of substrate is also favoured by the fact that its engagement at the substrate-binding domain of Hsp70 contributes to ATP hydrolysis at the nucleotide-binding domain ( Flynn et al , 1989 ; Laufen et al , 1999 ) and the re-cycling of the J-domain co-chaperone is presumably favoured by its disengagement from the ADP-bound Hsp70. However, the function, if any, of the Hsp70 partner in facilitating substrate release from the J-domain co-chaperone has not been addressed. This paper explores the interactions between lumenal P58, its substrates and Hsp70 partner, and exploits the surprising stability of the complex between P58 and its misfolded substrate to address the mechanism of substrate release.

Discussion

This study confirms that P58, a protein previously believed to reside in the cytosol, possesses a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide that mediates translocation into the ER lumen. Most of the signal detected in immunoprecipitates of radiolabelled endogenous P58 migrates on SDS–PAGE as a single band of higher mobility than the in vitro translation product of the P58 mRNA, suggesting that the signal peptide is cleaved in most P58 molecules in cultured fibroblasts. These observations, together with those reported in a detailed study ( Rutkowski et al , 2007 ), suggest that most of the P58 are located in the ER lumen. Although the new findings do not rule out a role for small amounts of cytoplasmic P58 in modulating the activity of the cytoplasmically located kinase domain of PERK ( Yan et al , 2002 ) or in interacting with proteins that are delayed at the ER translocon ( Oyadomari et al , 2006 ), they behoove us to consider alternative roles for P58. The evidence from this study, of a direct interaction between P58 and misfolded proteins suggests a simple model whereby P58 assists in the handling of unfolded or misfolded lumenal proteins as a lumenal J-domain containing co-chaperone.

ER homoeostasis is dependent on the organelle's ability to rid itself of terminally misfolded/misassembled proteins. Chaperones contribute to this process, presumably by binding to the misfolded proteins and retaining them in a retro-translocation-competent state ( Tsai et al , 2002 ). We have observed no reproducible effect of modulating P58 levels on the degradation of a model misfolded secreted glycoprotein (mutant α1-antitrypsin), a misassembled membrane glycoprotein (T-cell receptor α-subunit) ( Oyadomari et al , 2006 ), a misfolded membrane-associated glycoprotein (VSV-G ts045 –GFP; Supplementary Figure S3 ) or a misfolded secreted non-glycoprotein (a fusion of mutant pro-INS2 C96Y and GFP, data not shown). These negative results suggest that P58 does not have a pervasive role in clearing the ER of misfolded proteins by promoting their degradation. Instead, P58 may reduce the burden of unfolded and misfolded proteins by promoting protein folding in the ER lumen. Direct binding of unfolded/misfolded lumenal proteins by P58 explains previous observations that more newly synthesized (metabolically labelled) proteins can be crosslinked to P58 in stressed cells ( Oyadomari et al , 2006 ).

J-domain co-chaperones contribute to protein folding by collaborating with chaperones of the DnaK/Hsp70 class ( Craig et al , 2006 ). J-domain co-chaperone interactions with unfolded substrate proteins are believed to precede binding to the Hsp70 partner. By promoting nucleotide hydrolysis in the latter, J-domain co-chaperones affect an allosteric shift that increases the affinity of the Hsp70 partner for the unfolded protein and promotes stable Hsp70–substrate protein interaction. Most J-domain co-chaperones interact transiently with the unfolded substrate and the handover of the substrate from the J-domain co-chaperone to the Hsp70 partner is envisioned as being driven by mass action ( Bukau et al , 2006 ). P58 seems unusual in that regard, as the complex it forms with unfolded proteins is quite stable (at least in vitro where it survives extensive washing).

We find that physiological concentrations of the abundant ER Hsp70-type chaperone, BiP, can promote dissociation of the P58–substrate complex in vitro . However, this effect requires ATP and is sensitive to mutations in either partner that disrupt J-domain–BiP interactions. Taken together, these observations suggest that a productive interaction between ATP-bound BiP and P58, mediated through the latter's J-domain, is required for the dissociation of P58 from its misfolded substrate. A similar phenomenon is observed in ERdj3's interactions with BiP ( Jin et al , 2008 ), suggesting that reciprocal regulation of co-chaperone binding to substrate by the Hsp70 partner might be a conserved feature of this chaperone network.

Our findings could be explained by simple competition between BiP and P58 for binding sites on the unfolded substrate, leading to P58's displacement by mass action at steady state. This model is disfavoured by the observation that conditions leading to disruption of the P58–substrate complex (i.e. ATP/Mg 2+ ) are associated with less binding of BiP to the denatured RNase A (the substrate) and by the finding that more mutant BiP R197E , which is unable to direct the dissociation of P58, is bound to the substrate than wild-type BiP.

The failure of the isolated J-domain of P58 to complement the BiP/ATP-mediated dissociation of the mutant P58 H422Q from its unfolded substrate argues that nucleotide-bound BiP must interact with the J-domain of substrate-bound molecules of P58 for the latter's release to take place. This requirement is consistent with allosteric regulation of P58 by BiP through the J-domain. Several findings argue against this possibility: the three types of J-co-chaperones (I–III) ( Cheetham and Caplan, 1998 ) vary considerably in the arrangement of their J-domain relative to the substrate-binding domain, which seems incompatible with a common allosteric mechanism. The portability of P58's J-domain ( Figure 8 ) also argues against allostery, as the latter is predicted to constrain the relationship of the two domains. BiP's ability to promote dissociation of N-terminal fragments of J WT –P58 H422Q provides further evidence against the constraints predicted by the allosteric model; though of course it is impossible to exclude the fortuitous re-creation of a functional machine in the J WT –P58 H422Q fusion protein used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the separation of J-domain interaction from substrate release by BiP E201G and BiP V461F argues against allostery. However, it remains formally possible that the mutations in BiP, though permissive for J-domain interactions, selectively corrupt the allosteric mechanism.

More plausible, in our opinion, is an alternative model whereby the J-domain promotes cycles of competitive binding by BiP in proximity to the co-chaperone, followed by dissociation of both partners. The argument for proximity is supported by the observation that the isolated wild-type P58 J-domain (but not the BiP-binding defective mutant J H422Q ) interferes ( in trans ) with BiP/ATP-mediated dissociation of P58 from its substrate. Local competition and kinetic partitioning of the substrate from the J-domain co-chaperone to the Hsp70 partner likely involve ATP binding, hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange by the latter. Although global refolding of the substrate is precluded in our experiments by blocking disulphide-bond formation, local remodelling of the substrate by BiP remains possible. The inability of BiP E201G to properly handle nucleotide would explain its inability to engage a mechanism of kinetic partitioning and substrate remodelling, despite binding the J-domain. Likewise, the BiP V461F mutation's effect on substrate binding also precludes this mechanism. BiP's ability to regulate P58's association with misfolded protein thus fits well with the latter's proposed role as an intermediary that assists protein folding in the ER lumen.
