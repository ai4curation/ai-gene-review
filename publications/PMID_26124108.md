The tumor suppressor p53 plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability. 
In response to genotoxic stress, p53 levels increase and induce cell-cycle 
arrest, senescence, or apoptosis, thereby preventing replication of damaged DNA. 
In unstressed cells, p53 is maintained at a low level. The major negative 
regulator of p53 is MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that directly interacts with 
p53 and promotes its polyubiquitination, leading to the subsequent destruction 
of p53 by the 26S proteasome. Following DNA damage, MDM2 is degraded rapidly, 
resulting in increased p53 stability. Because of the important role of MDM2 in 
modulating p53 function, it is critical to understand how MDM2 levels are 
regulated. Here we show that the F-box protein FBXO31, a candidate tumor 
suppressor encoded in 16q24.3 for which there is loss of heterozygosity in 
various solid tumors, is responsible for promoting MDM2 degradation. Following 
genotoxic stress, FBXO31 is phosphorylated by the DNA damage serine/threonine 
kinase ATM, resulting in increased levels of FBXO31. FBXO31 then interacts with 
and directs the degradation of MDM2, which is dependent on phosphorylation of 
MDM2 by ATM. FBXO31-mediated loss of MDM2 leads to elevated levels of p53, 
resulting in growth arrest. In cells depleted of FBXO31, MDM2 is not degraded 
and p53 levels do not increase following genotoxic stress. Thus, FBXO31 is 
essential for the classic robust increase in p53 levels following DNA damage.
