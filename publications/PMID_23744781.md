Phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome ten (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor 
and an antagonist of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway. We identified 
a 576-amino acid translational variant of PTEN, termed PTEN-Long, that arises 
from an alternative translation start site 519 base pairs upstream of the ATG 
initiation sequence, adding 173 N-terminal amino acids to the normal PTEN open 
reading frame. PTEN-Long is a membrane-permeable lipid phosphatase that is 
secreted from cells and can enter other cells. As an exogenous agent, PTEN-Long 
antagonized PI3K signaling and induced tumor cell death in vitro and in vivo. By 
providing a means to restore a functional tumor-suppressor protein to tumor 
cells, PTEN-Long may have therapeutic uses.

Abstract

P hosphatase and Ten sin Homologue on chromosome Ten (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor and an antagonist of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway. We identified a 576-amino acid translational variant of PTEN , termed PTEN-Long, that arises from an alternative translation start site 519 bp upstream of the ATG initiation sequence, adding 173 N-terminal amino acids to the normal PTEN open reading frame. PTEN-Long is a membrane permeable lipid phosphatase that is secreted from cells and can enter other cells. As an exogenous agent, PTEN-Long antagonized PI3K signaling and induced tumor cell death in vitro and in vivo . By providing a means to restore a functional tumor suppressor protein to tumor cells, PTEN-Long may have therapeutic uses.
