The results of this study challenge the widely held view that growth hormone 
(GH) acts only during the postnatal period. RNA phenotyping shows transcripts 
for the GH receptor and GH-binding protein in mouse preimplantation embryos of 
all stages from fertilized eggs (day 1) to blastocysts (day 4). An antibody 
specific to the cytoplasmic region of the GH receptor revealed receptor protein 
expression, first in two-cell embryos, the stage of activation of the embryonic 
genome (day 2), and in all subsequent stages. In cleavage-stage embryos this 
immunoreactivity was localized mainly to the nucleus, but clear evidence of 
membrane labeling was apparent in blastocysts. GH receptor immunoreactivity was 
also observed in cumulus cells associated with unfertilized oocytes but not in 
the unfertilized oocytes. The blastocyst receptor was demonstrated to be 
functional, exhibiting the classic bell-shaped dose-response curves for GH 
stimulation of both 3-O-methyl glucose transport and protein synthesis. Maximal 
stimulation of 40-50% was seen for both responses at less than 1 ng/ml 
recombinant GH, suggesting a role for maternal GH. However mRNA transcripts for 
GH were also detected from the morula stage (day 3) by using reverse 
transcription-PCR, and GH immunoreactivity was seen in blastocysts. These 
observations raise the possibility of a paracrine/autocrine GH loop regulating 
embryonic development in its earliest stages.
