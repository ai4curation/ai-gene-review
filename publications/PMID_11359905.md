While the transactivation function of the tumor suppressor p53 is well 
understood, less is known about the transrepression functions of this protein. 
We have previously shown that p53 interacts with the corepressor protein mSin3a 
(hereafter designated Sin3) in vivo and that this interaction is critical for 
the ability of p53 to repress gene expression. In the present study, we 
demonstrate that expression of Sin3 results in posttranslational stabilization 
of both exogenous and endogenous p53, due to an inhibition of 
proteasome-mediated degradation of this protein. Stabilization of p53 by Sin3 
requires the Sin3-binding domain, determined here to map to the proline-rich 
region of p53, from amino acids 61 to 75. The correlation between Sin3 binding 
and stabilization supports the hypothesis that this domain of p53 may normally 
be subject to a destabilizing influence. The finding that a synthetic mutant of 
p53 lacking the Sin3-binding domain has an increased half-life in cells, 
compared to wild-type p53, supports this premise. Interestingly, unlike 
retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, MDMX, and p14(ARF), Sin3 stabilizes p53 
in an MDM2-independent manner. The ability of Sin3 to stabilize p53 is 
consistent with the model whereby these two proteins must exist on a promoter 
for extended periods, in order for repression to be an effective mechanism of 
gene regulation. This model is consistent with our data indicating that, unlike 
the p300-p53 complex, the p53-Sin3 complex is immunologically detectable for 
prolonged periods following exposure of cells to agents of DNA damage.

Abstract

While the transactivation function of the tumor suppressor p53 is well understood, less is known about the transrepression functions of this protein. We have previously shown that p53 interacts with the corepressor protein mSin3a (hereafter designated Sin3) in vivo and that this interaction is critical for the ability of p53 to repress gene expression. In the present study, we demonstrate that expression of Sin3 results in posttranslational stabilization of both exogenous and endogenous p53, due to an inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation of this protein. Stabilization of p53 by Sin3 requires the Sin3-binding domain, determined here to map to the proline-rich region of p53, from amino acids 61 to 75. The correlation between Sin3 binding and stabilization supports the hypothesis that this domain of p53 may normally be subject to a destabilizing influence. The finding that a synthetic mutant of p53 lacking the Sin3-binding domain has an increased half-life in cells, compared to wild-type p53, supports this premise. Interestingly, unlike retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, MDMX, and p14 ARF , Sin3 stabilizes p53 in an MDM2-independent manner. The ability of Sin3 to stabilize p53 is consistent with the model whereby these two proteins must exist on a promoter for extended periods, in order for repression to be an effective mechanism of gene regulation. This model is consistent with our data indicating that, unlike the p300-p53 complex, the p53-Sin3 complex is immunologically detectable for prolonged periods following exposure of cells to agents of DNA damage.

DISCUSSION

In the present study, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of the corepressor protein Sin3 leads to stabilization of both transfected and endogenous p53. That this effect is a direct impact of interaction of Sin3 with p53 is supported by our finding that a 15-amino-acid deletion mutant of p53 that is incapable of interacting with Sin3 also fails to be stabilized by this protein. Similarly, mutation of proline 71 of p53 to arginine or leucine significantly impairs Sin3 binding and Sin3-mediated stabilization. These data support a tight correlation between Sin3 binding and stabilization of p53. Our data also indicate that stabilization by Sin3 is likely the result of inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation of p53. Interestingly, unlike p14 ARF , MDMX, and pRB, Sin3 does not require the presence of MDM2 for this effect. Therefore, these findings point to the existence of a potentially novel pathway for p53 stabilization that does not involve inhibition of MDM2 function.

At least two proteins are implicated in p53 degradation in a manner that is independent of MDM2. These are the human papillomavirus type 16 or 18 (HPV-16 or -18) E6 protein (coupled with the accessory protein E6-AP) and JNK. As the E6–E6-AP complex and JNK both target p53 for degradation in an MDM2-independent manner ( 2 , 12 , 13 ), it is formally possible that Sin3 stabilizes p53 by inhibiting the action of these proteins. We have found that Sin3 also stabilizes the Δ92–112 mutant of p53 (J. T. Zilfou and M. Murphy, unpublished data); this deletion overlaps with the JNK binding site, indicating that it is unlikely that Sin3 stabilizes p53 by inhibiting JNK binding and/or destabilization. The contribution of the E6/E6-AP pathway to p53 degradation in normal (non-HPV-infected) cells remains controversial. Two groups found no evidence for a role for E6-AP protein in p53 degradation in normal cells ( 5 , 47 ). In contrast, the E6-AP knockout mouse shows increased p53 levels in certain cell types, indicating that this degradative pathway may play a cell-type-specific role in p53 degradation in normal cells ( 24 ). It is notable that we have mapped the Sin3-binding domain of p53 to a region that is required for degradation by the HPV-16–HPV-18 E6 protein ( 34 ). The possibility that Sin3 interferes with E6–E6-AP-mediated degradation of p53 is currently being tested in the laboratory.

The combined data implicate the Sin3-binding domain of p53, from amino acids 61 to 75, as a region that normally confers destabilization to this protein. This region of p53 has been previously implicated as a destabilization domain for this protein; specifically, removal of amino acids 62 to 96 has been shown to stabilize p53 in certain cell types ( 19 ). Interestingly, this region also overlaps with the proline-rich domain of p53 (amino acids 64 to 91), which is absolutely essential for apoptosis induction by this protein ( 40 , 49 , 50 ). A smaller deletion in this region, retaining only the Sin3-binding domain (amino acids 62 to 73), also retains the ability to induce apoptosis ( 53 ) and points to the importance of the p53-Sin3 interaction for the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis. Significantly, the proline-rich domain has also been shown to be necessary for transcriptional repression by p53 ( 49 , 50 ). Therefore, Sin3 is not only one of the first proteins found to interact with the proline-rich domain of p53, it is also the first protein implicated in transcriptional repression found to interact there.

It should be noted that our data do not imply that interaction with Sin3 is the exclusive, or even the major, mechanism whereby p53 is stabilized following DNA damage. In fact, our data indicate that the amount of p53 associated with Sin3 following DNA damage is rather small, approaching only 10% of total p53 (Fig. 8 and data not shown). Additionally, data from several other groups support the notion that decreased association with MDM2 is the major mechanism whereby p53 is stabilized in the cell in response to genotoxic stress ( 6 – 8 , 26 , 38 ). Therefore, the ability of Sin3 to stabilize p53 is relevant only for that pool of p53 that is bound to Sin3; this stabilization may even occur exclusively at the promoters of p53-repressed genes.

The identification of Sin3 as a stabilizer of p53 appears logical when the mechanism of action of the p53-Sin3 complex is taken into consideration. Transactivation of target genes by p53 can proceed effectively in a transient manner; this transient nature may even be facilitated by the coactivator p300, which serves as a scaffold for MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 ( 16 ). In contrast, it could be argued that transcriptional repression is effective only if repression complexes exist stably on the promoters of repressed genes for prolonged periods of time. By protecting p53 from degradation, the corepressor Sin3 therefore would be predicted to enhance the efficacy of p53 as a transcriptional repressor (Fig. 9 ). In an analogous manner, E2F-1 and c-Myc, both of which are unstable transcriptional activators, have been shown to be protected from proteasome-mediated degradation by their respective transcriptional repression partners, pRB and miz-1 ( 20 , 41 ). Our in vivo data, indicating that the p53-Sin3 complex exists for sustained periods following exposure to DNA damage, support this hypothesis. In sum, the data presented in this paper support a novel mechanism for the control of p53 stability and activity and point to a physiologically relevant mechanism for the control of p53 degradation, mediated by the Sin3-binding domain of p53.
