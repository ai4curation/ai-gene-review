The expression of hepatic calcium-binding protein regucalcin mRNA was 
investigated in regenerating rat liver. The change of regucalcin mRNA levels was 
analyzed by Northern blotting, using liver regucalcin cDNA (0.9 kb with complete 
open reading frame). The reduced liver weight by partial hepatectomy (about 70%) 
was completely restored at 3 days after surgery. Regenerating liver 
significantly increased calcium content. Liver regucalcin mRNA levels clearly 
increased 1-5 days after hepatectomy, in comparison with that of sham-operated 
rats, although the increase was not seen 12 hr after the surgery. Increased 
regucalcin mRNA levels in regenerating liver were appreciably reduced by single 
intraperitoneal administration of actinomycin D (100 micrograms/100 g body 
weight), an inhibitor of transcriptional process. Moreover, the increased 
regucalcin mRNA levels by hepatectomy was weakened by a single intraperitoneal 
administration of trifluoperazine (2.5 mg/100 g), an inhibitor of 
Ca2+/calmodulin. These findings demonstrate that the expression of hepatic 
regucalcin mRNA is enhanced in regenerating rat liver.
