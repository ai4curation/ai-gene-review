BACKGROUND: Many microorganisms have the ability to either oxidize molecular 
hydrogen to generate reducing power or to produce hydrogen in order to remove 
low-potential electrons. These reactions are catalyzed by two unrelated enzymes: 
the Ni-Fe hydrogenases and the Fe-only hydrogenases.
RESULTS: We report here the structure of the heterodimeric Fe-only hydrogenase 
from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans - the first for this class of enzymes. With the 
exception of a ferredoxin-like domain, the structure represents a novel protein 
fold. The so-called H cluster of the enzyme is composed of a typical [4Fe-4S] 
cubane bridged to a binuclear active site Fe center containing putative CO and 
CN ligands and one bridging 1, 3-propanedithiol molecule. The conformation of 
the subunits can be explained by the evolutionary changes that have transformed 
monomeric cytoplasmic enzymes into dimeric periplasmic enzymes. Plausible 
electron- and proton-transfer pathways and a putative channel for the access of 
hydrogen to the active site have been identified.
CONCLUSIONS: The unrelated active sites of Ni-Fe and Fe-only hydrogenases have 
several common features: coordination of diatomic ligands to an Fe ion; a vacant 
coordination site on one of the metal ions representing a possible 
substrate-binding site; a thiolate-bridged binuclear center; and plausible 
proton- and electron-transfer pathways and substrate channels. The diatomic 
coordination to Fe ions makes them low spin and favors low redox states, which 
may be required for catalysis. Complex electron paramagnetic resonance signals 
typical of Fe-only hydrogenases arise from magnetic interactions between the 
[4Fe-4S] cluster and the active site binuclear center. The paucity of protein 
ligands to this center suggests that it was imported from the inorganic world as 
an already functional unit.
