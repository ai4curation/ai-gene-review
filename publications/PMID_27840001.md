Mechanical force is needed to mediate endocytosis. Whether actin, the most 
abundant force-generating molecule, is essential for endocytosis is highly 
controversial in mammalian cells, particularly synapses, likely due to the use 
of actin blockers, the efficiency and specificity of which are often unclear in 
the studied cell. Here we addressed this issue using a knockout approach 
combined with measurements of membrane capacitance and fission pore conductance, 
imaging of vesicular protein endocytosis, and electron microscopy. We found that 
two actin isoforms, β- and γ-actin, are crucial for slow, rapid, bulk, and 
overshoot endocytosis at large calyx-type synapses, and for slow endocytosis and 
bulk endocytosis at small hippocampal synapses. Polymerized actin provides 
mechanical force to form endocytic pits. Actin also facilitates replenishment of 
the readily releasable vesicle pool, likely via endocytic clearance of active 
zones. We conclude that polymerized actin provides mechanical force essential 
for all kinetically distinguishable forms of endocytosis at synapses.
