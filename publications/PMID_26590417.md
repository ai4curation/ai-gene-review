Abstract

Structural and functional brain connectivity, synaptic activity and information processing require highly coordinated signal transduction between different cell types within the neurovascular unit and intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions. Here, we examine the mechanisms regulating the formation and maintenance of the BBB and functions of BBB-associated cell types. Furthermore, we discuss the growing evidence associating BBB breakdown with the pathogenesis of inherited monogenic neurological disorders and complex multifactorial diseases including Alzheimer’s disease.

Introduction

Blood vessels in the brain are organized with surprising precision supporting the major brain circuits tasked with sensation, memory and motion ( Andreone et al., 2015 ; Blinder et al., 2013 ; Zlokovic, 2011 ). Proper structural and functional brain connectivity, synaptic activity and information processing all require precise regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen delivery and energy metabolite supply ( Attwell et al., 2010 ; Iadecola, 2013 ). These key central nervous system (CNS) functions are maintained by the highly coordinated activity of multiple cell types within the neurovascular unit (NVU), including vascular cells (endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells), glia (astrocytes, oligodendroglia, microglia) and neurons ( Figure 1 ) ( Zlokovic, 2011 ).

Within the NVU, the endothelial cells form the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that limits entry of potentially neurotoxic plasma components, blood cells and pathogens into the brain ( Winkler et al., 2011 ). Importantly, these endothelial cells express multiple substrate-specific transport systems that control transport of nutrients, energy metabolites and other essential molecules from blood into the brain and the transport of metabolic waste products from brain’s interstitial fluid (ISF) into the blood. The meningeal lymphatic vessels contain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and immune cells and drain into the deep cervical lymph nodes ( Aspelund et al., 2015 ; Louveau et al., 2015 ). Thus, the BBB serves as a key homeostatic site of the nervous system connecting CNS, systemic circulation, and major systems in the body such as respiratory, renal, hepatic and immune systems.

In this review, first we examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the formation and maintenance of the BBB. We then look into how major NVU cell types contribute to BBB functions and how molecular alterations and aberrant signal transduction within the NVU leads to BBB breakdown that is associated with secondary neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. In particular, we discuss the role of NVU and BBB breakdown in the etiology and pathogenesis of inherited monogenic neurological disorders and complex neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Finally, we discuss key questions in the field for future investigation.

Conclusions and future directions

Recent advances in human genetics and the corresponding transgenic models indicate that almost every non-neuronal cell type of the NVU could be affected by some monogenic inherited disorders. This association can provide insights into the potential pathogenic links among BBB dysfunction, neuronal injury, neurodegeneration and neurological disorders caused by NVU disruption and BBB breakdown. On the other hand, the relationship among neurovascular integrity, brain structural and functional connectivity, cognitive function and neurological symptomatology in complex disorders such as AD still awaits to be directly explored in the most relevant in vivo context, which has only recently became possible with the development of novel state-of-the art neuroimaging and molecular biomarker approaches. Experimental studies combining genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors hold promise to further advance our knowledge of multifactorial CNS disorders and to establish the concept that the loss of healthy cerebral blood vessels and BBB integrity influences the course and clinical phenotype of neurological disorders in a region-specific manner.

Some important questions remain to be addressed. First, it is still unclear whether in the living human brain, cerebrovascular changes and BBB breakdown can drive the initial pathogenic events that lead to neuronal injury, disrupted structural and functional brain connectivity and early neurological symptoms, such as cognitive decline in AD and motor changes in ALS, PD or HD. Second, further studies are warranted to test whether the underlying molecular mechanisms of NVU disruption and BBB breakdown might point to new targets for therapeutic development to prevent and/or treat neurodegenerative disorders. Third, technological advance is required to determine if neurovascular dysfunction and BBB breakdown are detectable in the living human brain, prior to the development of the full spectrum of neurological symptoms. Last but not least, future investigations need to address whether molecular and imaging biomarkers of neurovascular dysfunction can serve as reliable prognostic and/or diagnostic tools to predict the development of neurodegenerative disorders.

From the basic science side, pushing the envelope further to generate a comprehensive proteomics and RNAseq molecular atlas of the BBB in animals and humans would provide a valuable resource for discovering and studying new targets and signaling pathways mediating the crosstalk among different cell types within the NVU. This may lead to the development of new transgenic animal models, pluripotent stem cell models of the BBB, NVU and different neurological disorders, serving as valuable platforms for drug discovery and for testing novel drug delivery approaches.
