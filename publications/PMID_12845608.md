Saccharomyces cerevisiae Set1p is a methyltransferase specific for lysine 4 of 
histone H3 and is required for efficient gene expression.

Several homologues of the Drosophila Su(var)3-9 protein were recently reported 
to methylate lysine 9 of histone H3. Whereas this methylation signal served to 
recruit heterochromatin-associated proteins to transcriptionally silenced 
regions, histone H3 methylated at lysine 4 was associated with transcriptionally 
active areas of the genome. These findings suggested that the interplay between 
lysine 4 and 9 methylation is crucial in eukaryotic gene regulation. Here we 
provide evidence that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Set1p is a methyltransferase 
specific for lysine 4 of histone H3. In addition, we show that the absence of 
Set1p and lysine 4 methylation result in decreased transcription of 
approximately 80% of the genes in S. cerevisiae. Hierarchical clustering 
analysis of the set1(-) expression profile revealed a correspondence to that of 
a mad2(-) strain, suggesting that the transcriptional defect in the set1(-) 
strain may be due to changes in chromatin structure. These findings establish a 
central role for methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 in transcriptional 
regulation.
