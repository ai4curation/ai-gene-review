BAD interacts with anti-apoptotic molecules BCL-2 and BCL-XL and promotes 
apoptosis. BAD is phosphorylated on serine residues in response to a survival 
factor, interleukin-3. Phosphorylated BAD cannot bind to BCL-XL or BCL-2 at 
membrane sites and is found in the cytosol bound to 14-3-3. We report here that 
deletion mapping and site-directed mutagenesis identified a BH3 domain within 
BAD that proved necessary for both its heterodimerization with BCL-XL and its 
death agonist activity. Substitution of the conserved Leu151 with Ala in the BH3 
amphipathic alpha-helix abrogated both functions. The BAD Leu151 mutant was 
predominantly in the cytosol bound to 14-3-3. The BH3 domain of BCL-2 also 
proved important for BCL-2/BAD interaction. These results establish a critical 
role for a BH3 domain within BAD and provide evidence that BAD may function as a 
death ligand whose pro-apoptotic activity requires heterodimerization with 
BCL-XL.
