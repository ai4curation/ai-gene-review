The human HtrA3 protease is involved in placentation, mitochondrial homeostasis, 
stimulation of apoptosis and proposed to be a tumor suppressor. Molecular 
mechanisms of the HtrA3 functions are poorly understood and knowledge concerning 
its cellular targets is very limited. There are two HtrA3 isoforms, the long 
(HtrA3L) and short (HtrA3S). Upon stress, their N-terminal domains are removed, 
resulting in the more active ΔN-HtrA3. By pull down and mass spectrometry 
techniques, we identified a panel of putative ΔN-HtrA3L/S substrates. We 
confirmed that ΔN-HtrA3L/S formed complexes with actin, β-tubulin, vimentin and 
TCP1α in vitro and in a cell and partially co-localized with the actin and 
vimentin filaments, microtubules and TCP1α in a cell. In vitro, both isoforms 
cleaved the cytoskeleton proteins, promoted tubulin polymerization and displayed 
chaperone-like activity, with ΔN-HtrA3S being more efficient in proteolysis and 
ΔN-HtrA3L - in polymerization. TCP1α, essential for the actin and tubulin 
folding, was directly bound by the ΔN-HtrA3L/S but not cleaved. These results 
indicate that actin, β-tubulin, vimentin, and TCP1α are HtrA3 cellular partners 
and suggest that HtrA3 may influence cytoskeleton dynamics. They also suggest 
different roles of the HtrA3 isoforms and a possibility that HtrA3 protease may 
also function as a co-chaperone.
SIGNIFICANCE: The HtrA3 protease stimulates apoptosis and is proposed to be a 
tumor suppressor and a therapeutic target, however little is known about its 
function at the molecular level and very few HtrA3 physiological substrates have 
been identified so far. Furthermore, HtrA3 is the only member of the HtrA family 
of proteins which, apart from the long isoform possessing the PD and PDZ domains 
(HtrA3L), has a short isoform (HtrA3S) lacking the PDZ domain. In this work we 
identified a large panel (about 150) of the tentative HtrA3L/S cellular partners 
which provides a good basis for further research concerning the HtrA3 function. 
We have shown that the cytoskeleton proteins actin, β-tubulin and vimentin, and 
the TCP1α chaperonin are cellular partners of both HtrA3 isoforms. Our findings 
indicate that HtrA3 may promote destabilization of the actin and vimentin 
cytoskeleton and suggest that it may influence the dynamics of the microtubule 
network, with the HtrA3S being more efficient in cytoskeleton protein cleavage 
and HtrA3L - in tubulin polymerization. Also, we have shown for the first time 
that HtrA3 has a chaperone-like, holdase activity in vitro - activity typical 
for co-chaperone proteins. The proposed HtrA3 influence on the cytoskeleton 
dynamics may be one of the ways in which HtrA3 promotes cell death and affects 
cancerogenesis. We believe that the results of this study provide a new insight 
into the role of HtrA3 in a cell and further confirm the notion that HtrA3 
should be considered as a target of new anti-cancer therapies.
