Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited disorder 
associated with arrhythmias and sudden death. A recessive mutation in the gene 
encoding plakoglobin has been shown to cause Naxos disease, a cardiocutaneous 
syndrome characterized by ARVC and abnormalities of hair and skin. Here, we 
report, for the first time, a dominant mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin 
in a German family with ARVC but no cutaneous abnormalities. The mutation 
(S39_K40insS) is predicted to insert an extra serine residue at position 39 in 
the N-terminus of plakoglobin. Analysis of a biopsy sample of the right 
ventricle from the proband showed markedly decreased localization of 
plakoglobin, desmoplakin, and connexin43 at intercalated discs in cardiac 
myocytes. A yeast-two-hybrid screen revealed that the mutant protein established 
novel interactions with histidine-rich calcium-binding protein and TGF beta 
induced apoptosis protein 2. Immunoblotting and confocal microscopy in human 
embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell lines transfected to stably express either 
wild-type or mutant plakoglobin protein showed that the mutant protein was 
apparently ubiquitylated and was preferentially located in the cytoplasm, 
suggesting that the S39_K40insS mutation may increase plakoglobin turnover via 
proteasomal degradation. HEK293 cells expressing mutant plakoglobin also showed 
higher rates of proliferation and lower rates of apoptosis than did cells 
expressing the wild-type protein. Electron microscopy showed smaller and fewer 
desmosomes in cells expressing mutant plakoglobin. Taken together, these 
observations suggest that the S39_K40insS mutation affects the structure and 
distribution of mechanical and electrical cell junctions and could interfere 
with regulatory mechanisms mediated by Wnt-signaling pathways. These results 
implicate novel molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ARVC.
