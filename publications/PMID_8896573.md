5-Oxoprolinuria (pyroglutamic aciduria) resulting from glutathione synthetase 
(GSS) deficiency is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder characterized, in 
its severe form, by massive urinary excretion of 5-oxoproline, metabolic 
acidosis, haemolytic anaemia and central nervous system damage. The metabolic 
defect results in low GSH levels presumably with feedback over-stimulation of 
gamma-glutamylcysteine synthesis and its subsequent conversion to 5-oxoproline. 
In this study, we cloned and characterized the human GSS gene and examined three 
families with four cases of well-documented 5-oxoprolinuria. We identified seven 
mutations at the GSS locus on six alleles: one splice site mutation, two 
deletions and four missense mutations. Bacterial expression and yeast 
complementation assays of the cDNAs encoded by these alleles demonstrated their 
functional defects. We also characterized a fifth case, an homozygous missense 
mutation in the gene in an individual affected by a milder-form of the GSS 
deficiency, which is apparently restricted to erythrocytes and only associated 
with haemolytic anaemia. Our data provide the first molecular genetic analysis 
of 5-oxoprolinuria and demonstrate that GSS deficiency with oxoprolinuria and 
GSS deficiency without 5-oxoprolinuria are caused by mutations in the same gene.
