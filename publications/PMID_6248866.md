Detection of epidermal growth factor-urogastrone and its receptor during fetal 
mouse development.

Nexø E, Hollenberg MD, Figueroa A, Pratt RM.

Using both a radioimmunoassay and a radioreceptor assay, we have estimated the 
content of mouse epidermal growth factor-urogastrone (EGF-URO) in fetal mice at 
11(1/2) to 17(1/2) days of gestation. Concurrently, the amount of specific 
EGF-URO receptor binding was determined in crude membrane fractions from the 
embryos. EGF-URO receptor binding is readily detected in membranes from the 
youngest embryos (day 11(1/2)) and rises steadily up to parturition (18 days); 
the rise is more marked in embryo membranes derived from a potential target 
tissue, such as the maxilla and secondary palate. In the embryonic extracts, 
EGF-URO proved to be labile, requiring the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor 
and sodium azide to stabilize the recovery of added EGF-URO in test samples. 
Even with added stabilizing agents, immunoreactive EGF-URO was barely detectable 
before day 14(1/2) (less than 20 fmol per embryo), whereas a substantial 
increase was observed from day 15(1/2) to 17(1/2) (from 70 to 200 fmol per 
embryo). In contrast, the radioreceptor assay detected appreciable amounts of an 
EGF-URO-like substance at 11(1/2) days (50 fmol per embryo); the values 
estimated by radioreceptor assay (about 10-fold higher than by radioimmunoassay) 
also increase markedly between days 15(1/2) and 17(1/2) (on average from 500 to 
3000 fmol per embryo). We conclude that during fetal mouse development there is 
an increase both in the receptors for EGF-URO and in a substance (presumably a 
fetal growth factor) that can occupy the receptor. The differences between the 
radioreceptor and radioimmunoassay estimates for the EGF-URO content suggest 
that the fetal form of mouse EGF-URO differs from the adult molecule.
