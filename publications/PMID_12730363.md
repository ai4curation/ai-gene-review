Triple A syndrome is a human autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an 
unusual array of tissue-specific defects. Triple A syndrome arises from 
mutations in a WD-repeat protein of unknown function called ALADIN (also termed 
Adracalin or AAAS). We showed previously that ALADIN localizes to nuclear pore 
complexes (NPCs), large multiprotein assemblies that are the sole sites of 
nucleocytoplasmic transport. Here, we present evidence indicating that NPC 
targeting is essential for the function of ALADIN. Characterization of mutant 
ALADIN proteins from triple A patients revealed a striking effect of these 
mutations on NPC targeting. A variety of disease-associated missense, nonsense, 
and frameshift mutations failed to localize to NPCs and were found predominantly 
in the cytoplasm. Microscopic analysis of cells from a triple A patient revealed 
no morphological abnormalities of the nuclei, nuclear envelopes, or NPCs. 
Importantly, these findings indicate that defects in NPC function, rather than 
structure, give rise to triple A syndrome. We propose that ALADIN plays a cell 
type-specific role in regulating nucleocytoplasmic transport and that this 
function is essential for the proper maintenance andor development of certain 
tissues. Our findings provide a foundation for understanding the molecular basis 
of triple A syndrome and may lead to unique insights into the role of 
nucleocytoplasmic transport in adrenal function and neurodevelopment.
