ZW10, a dynamitin-interacting protein associated with kinetochores, is known to 
participate directly in turning off of the spindle checkpoint. In the present 
study, we show that ZW10 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum as well as in 
the cytosol during interphase, and forms a subcomplex with RINT-1 
(Rad50-interacting protein) and p31 in a large complex comprising syntaxin 18, 
an endoplasmic reticulum-localized t-SNARE implicated in membrane trafficking. 
Like conventional syntaxin-binding proteins, ZW10, RINT-1 and p31 dissociated 
from syntaxin 18 upon Mg(2+)-ATP treatment in the presence of NSF and 
alpha-SNAP, whereas the subcomplex was not disassembled. Overexpression, 
microinjection and knockdown experiments revealed that ZW10 is involved in 
membrane trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. The present 
results disclose an unexpected role for a spindle checkpoint protein, ZW10, 
during interphase.
