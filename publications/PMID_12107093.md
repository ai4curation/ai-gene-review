Recent reports have indicated that enzymes such as cathepsins D and B are 
translocated from lysosomal compartments to the cytosol early during apoptosis. 
We have previously noted that a translocation of cathepsins D and B occur before 
cytochrome c release and caspase activation in cardiomyocytes and human 
fibroblasts during oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. In the present report, we 
use a microinjection technique to investigate if cytosolic location of the 
cathepsins D and B are important for induction of apoptosis. We found that 
microinjection of cathepsin D into the cytosol of human fibroblasts caused 
apoptosis, which was detected as changes in distribution of cytochrome c, cell 
shrinkage, activation of caspases, chromatin condensation, and formation of 
pycnotic nuclei. No apoptosis was, however, induced by microinjection of 
cathepsin B. Moreover, apoptosis was prevented in fibroblasts pretreated with a 
caspase-3-like inhibitor, and also when microinjected with cathepsin D mixed 
with the cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin A. These results show that cytosolic 
cathepsin D can act as a proapoptotic mediator upstream of cytochrome c release 
and caspase activation in human fibroblasts.
