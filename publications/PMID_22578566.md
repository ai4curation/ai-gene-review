Abstract

An increasing body of evidence highlights an intriguing interaction between microRNAs and transcriptional factors involved in determining cell fate, including the well known “genome guardian” p53. Here we show that miR‐205, oncosuppressive microRNA lost in breast cancer, is directly transactivated by oncosuppressor p53.

Moreover, evaluating miR‐205 expression in a panel of cell lines belonging to the highly aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype, which still lacks an effective targeted therapy and characterized by an extremely undifferentiated and mesenchymal phenotype, we demonstrated that this microRNA is critically down‐expressed compared to a normal‐like cell line. Re‐expression of miR‐205 where absent strongly reduces cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and clonogenic potential in vitro, and inhibits tumor growth in vivo, and this tumor suppressor activity is at least partially exerted through targeting of E2F1, master regulator of cell cycle progression, and LAMC1, component of extracellular matrix involved in cell adhesion, proliferation and migration.

1. Introduction

The involvement of microRNAs in the biology of human cancer is supported by an increasing body of experimental evidence, that has gradually switched from profiling studies to biological demonstrations of the causal role of these small molecules in the tumorigenic process, modulating oncogenic or tumor suppressor pathways, and the possible implications as biomarkers or therapeutic tools ( Iorio and Croce, 2009 ). The first report describing a microRNA signature unique for breast cancer and associating microRNA expression to specific bio‐pathological features was published by our group in 2005 ( Iorio et al., 2005 ).

Previous studies showed that miR‐205 expression is significantly underexpressed in human breast cancer ( Iorio et al., 2009 ) ( Wu et al., 2009 ), and able to interfere with HER receptor family‐mediated survival pathway by directly targeting HER3 receptor ( Iorio et al., 2009 ). In addition, other studies indicated that miR‐205 is a negative regulator of the Epithelial‐Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), targeting ZEB1 and ZEB2 transcription factors, and that its expression is lost in mesenchymal breast cancer cell lines ( Gregory et al., 2008 ). Moreover, miR‐205 also targets VEGF‐A ( Wu et al., 2009 ) and inhibits Src‐mediated oncogenic pathways in renal cancer ( Majid et al., 2011 ).

In this study we aimed to identify novel potential oncosuppressive pathways depending on miR‐205 in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an extremely aggressive tumor subgroup, negative for HER2, ER and PgR, characterized by an undifferentiated phenotype, and still lacking a specific therapy.

Concerning miR‐205 expression in different subgroups of breast tumors, Sempere and colleagues ( Sempere et al., 2007 ) described miR‐205 expression to be restricted to the myoepithelial/basal cell compartment of normal mammary ducts and lobules and reduced or completely eliminated in matching tumor specimens, and a very recent study ( Radojicic et al., 2011 ) reported that miR‐205 expression is significantly underexpressed in primary TNBCs compared to the normal counterpart.

Using as a model TNBC cell lines (MDA‐MB‐231 and BT‐549), we first confirmed that miR‐205 exerts an oncosuppressive activity, reducing cellular proliferation both in vitro and in vivo . Our results demonstrate that miR‐205 directly targets E2F1, a transcriptional factor playing a crucial role in the regulation of cell cycle progression ( Polager and Ginsberg, 2009 ), and LAMC1, a component of the extracellular matrix, implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration and metastasis ( Martin and Timpl, 1987 ). Finally we analyzed the transcriptional unit of miR‐205 in order to clarify the molecular mechanisms affecting its expression: interestingly, here we demonstrate that tumor suppressor p53, whose mutations and loss represent one of the most common genetic changes in human neoplasias including breast cancer, is able to positively modulate miR‐205 expression levels in different cellular models, and that this effect is exerted through direct binding of the transcription factor on regulatory sequences upstream the microRNA coding gene.

4. Discussion

The decision to shed more light on the role of miR‐205 in TNBC is supported by the evidence that this is a very aggressive subgroup of breast carcinomas still lacking an effective targeted therapy, where miR‐205 is one of the most significantly underexpressed microRNAs ( Radojicic et al., 2011 ) and where its functional role and regulation have not been clearly elucidated yet.

To this aim, we first analyzed a wide panel of triple negative breast cancer cell lines, observing that this microRNA is expressed at significantly lower levels compared to a Normal‐like breast cell line. Interestingly, in a very recent paper ( Prat and Perou, 2011 ), the cell lines we analyzed were classified as belonging to a very undifferentiated subgroup, named claudin‐low, associated to low or absent expression of adhesion molecules, luminal differentiation markers, high enrichment for epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition markers, immune response genes and cancer stem cell‐like features. Notably, the only cell line that displays a higher miR‐205 expression, SUM‐149, does not belong to the claudin‐low subgroup, further supporting the idea that miR‐205 loss could be considered a valid marker of an undifferentiated, mesenchymal and aggressive phenotype.

Choosing the TNBC cell lines MDA‐MB‐231 and BT‐549 as cellular models, in this study we show that reintroduction of miR‐205 not only leads to a dramatic reduction of both proliferation, cell cycle progression and clonogenic potential in vitro , but it also significantly inhibits the in vivo tumor growth in xenograft models.

Concerning the identification of new miR‐205 target genes, we demonstrated that this microRNA directly targets LAMC1, encoding the γ‐chain of the laminin‐1. This protein has multiple biological activities including promotion of cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, differentiation and enhancement of the metastatic phenotype of tumor cells. Phenocopy experiments demonstrated that LAMC1 silencing is, at least in part, responsible of the growth inhibition mediated by miR‐205.

In addition, we also demonstrated that miR‐205 directly targets the transcription factor E2F1, master regulator of the G1/S transition, at both mRNA and protein levels. Reduced expression of this protein in MDA‐MB‐231 stable clones overexpressing miR‐205 results in a slower cell cycle progression. Moreover, miR‐205 overexpression resulted in increased induction of cellular senescence, a process which is negatively regulated by E2F protein family ( Maehara et al., 2005 ). Also in this case phenocopy experiments confirmed that E2F1 silencing could be responsible of the impaired cell cycle progression observed in miR‐205 overexpressing cells. These findings further suggest that miR‐205 is able to influence cell cycle progression and cell fate, through the targeting of E2F1.

Subsequently, since the mechanisms responsible for miR‐205 downregulation in breast cancer have not been elucidated yet, we defined the promoter region of this microRNA and searched for conserved transcription factor binding sites.

We first showed that miR‐205 expression could be modulated by the demethylating agent 5‐AZA‐dC, possibly through miR‐205 promoter demethylation or modulation of transcriptional factor involved in its regulation.

Interestingly, we also demonstrated that the tumor suppressor p53 is able to induce miR‐205 expression in different cellular models, and that this effect is mediated by its direct binding on a responsive element located upstream this microRNA.

Considering the high frequency of TP53 mutations in basal‐like breast cancer (44–82%) ( Sorlie et al., 2001 ), the transcriptional induction of miR‐205 by p53 may have important implications. First, the reduced expression or the occurrence of inactivating mutations of TP53 or the presence of a wt but non active p53 might justify the reduced levels or the completely loss (as in the case of TNBC) of miR‐205 in breast cancer. Moreover, the direct targeting of E2F1 mediated by miR‐205, likely to be responsible of the cell cycle arrest observed in our experimental models, might be a new alternative regulatory mechanism used by p53 to influence the cell fate to an anti‐proliferative choice. Indeed, it is widely demonstrated that p53 activation blocks the release of E2F1 from its inhibitor pRB, through the transcriptional activation of p21 (waf‐1/cip‐1), which in turn negatively regulates several complexes of cyclin/cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) involved in the negative regulation of pRB and in the cell cycle progression from the G1 to the S‐phase. Our data suggest that miR‐205 might represent a novel pRB‐independent mediator of the regulation of E2F1, initiated by p53 in order to prevent cell cycle progression.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that miR‐205 is a novel transcriptional target of p53, and that it exerts a role as oncosuppressor in triple negative breast cancer, and in particular in a model representative of the most undifferentiated and mesenchymal subgroup, through the regulation, at least in part, of the two newly identified target genes, E2F1 and LAMC1, thus resulting in reduced cellular proliferation, both in vitro and in vivo .
