BACKGROUND: The database of human Expressed Sequence Tags was previously used to 
identify PRAC (Prostate 47:125-131, 2001), a novel gene specifically expressed 
in human prostate, prostate cancer, rectum, and distal colon. In this report, we 
have identified PRAC2, another gene with a similar expression pattern that is 
located adjacent to the original PRAC gene on chromosome 17q21.3.
METHODS: Using a computer-based analysis, a cluster of sequence homologous ESTs 
was identified that is mainly derived from human prostate cDNA libraries. The 
tissue specificity was examined by multiple tissue RNA dot blots and RT-PCR. The 
PRAC2 transcript and protein were identified using Northern blot analysis, 
RACE-PCR, primer extension, and Western blots.
RESULTS: PRAC2 encodes a 564 nucleotide RNA found in prostate, rectum, distal 
colon, and testis. Weak expression was also found in placenta, peripheral blood 
leukocytes, skin, and in two prostate cancer cell lines: LNCaP and PC-3. The 
transcript seems to encode a 10.5-kDa nuclear protein. The PRAC2 gene is located 
on chromosome 17 at position 17q21, between the Hoxb-13 gene and the recently 
discovered PRAC gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of the higher expression of PRAC2 in prostate and its 
proximity to Hoxb-13, PRAC2 may have a function in prostate growth and 
development.
