A critical step in skeletal morphogenesis is the formation of synovial joints, 
which define the relative size of discrete skeletal elements and are required 
for the mobility of vertebrates. We have found that several Wnt genes, including 
Wnt4, Wnt14, and Wnt16, were expressed in overlapping and complementary patterns 
in the developing synovial joints, where beta-catenin protein levels and 
transcription activity were up-regulated. Removal of beta-catenin early in 
mesenchymal progenitor cells promoted chondrocyte differentiation and blocked 
the activity of Wnt14 in joint formation. Ectopic expression of an activated 
form of beta-catenin or Wnt14 in early differentiating chondrocytes induced 
ectopic joint formation both morphologically and molecularly. In contrast, 
genetic removal of beta-catenin in chondrocytes led to joint fusion. These 
results demonstrate that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is necessary and 
sufficient to induce early steps of synovial joint formation. Wnt4, Wnt14, and 
Wnt16 may play redundant roles in synovial joint induction by signaling through 
the beta-catenin-mediated canonical Wnt pathway.

Abstract

A critical step in skeletal morphogenesis is the formation of synovial joints, which define the relative size of discrete skeletal elements and are required for the mobility of vertebrates. We have found that several Wnt genes, including Wnt4, Wnt14 , and Wnt16 , were expressed in overlapping and complementary patterns in the developing synovial joints, where β-catenin protein levels and transcription activity were up-regulated. Removal of β- catenin early in mesenchymal progenitor cells promoted chondrocyte differentiation and blocked the activity of Wnt14 in joint formation. Ectopic expression of an activated form of β- catenin or Wnt14 in early differentiating chondrocytes induced ectopic joint formation both morphologically and molecularly. In contrast, genetic removal of β- catenin in chondrocytes led to joint fusion. These results demonstrate that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is necessary and sufficient to induce early steps of synovial joint formation. Wnt4, Wnt14 , and Wnt16 may play redundant roles in synovial joint induction by signaling through the β-catenin-mediated canonical Wnt pathway.

Discussion

Here, we report the identification of the β-catenin-mediated canonical Wnt pathway as the first signaling pathway that is both sufficient and necessary for the induction of synovial joints in the limb. This indicates that the Wnt/β-catenin may act on the top of the regulatory hierarchy in inducing synovial joint formation. We also showed that Wnt4, Wnt14 , and Wnt16 were expressed in the forming joint in overlapping and complementary patterns, and they may play redundant roles in activating β-catenin and joint formation. Taken together, we propose a model for the molecular control of synovial joint induction ( Fig. 8 ). Expression of Wnt genes such as Wnt4, Wnt14 , and Wnt16 in the presumptive joint results in up-regulation of β-catenin protein levels and inhibition of Sox9 expression. This leads to the induction of synovial joint formation, the first step of which is the formation of interzone cells by inhibiting or reversing chondrocyte differentiation and inducing Gdf5 expression ( Fig. 8 ). Our study is consistent with the previous studies in chick that show that Wnt14 induces early steps of joint formation and that β-catenin protein levels decrease dramatically upon chondrocyte differentiation, and that ectopic accumulation of β-catenin-reversed chondrocyte differentiation ( Hartmann and Tabin 2001 ; Ryu et al. 2002 ). Our results further indicate that the canonical Wnt signaling pathway has at least two physiological functions in synovial joint formation, suppression of chondrocyte differentiation and the induction of Gdf5 expression. Reversion of chondrocyte differentiation itself is not sufficient for joint formation. Chondrocyte differentiation is reversed in Sox9 c/c ;Col2a1-Cre mice, but Gdf5 expression is not up-regulated or ectopically expressed ( Akiyama et al. 2002 ). Conversely, induction of Gdf5 alone by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cannot reverse chondrocyte differentiation, because overexpression of Gdf5 instead caused excessive chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage overgrowth ( Francis-West et al. 1999a ; Tsumaki et al. 1999 ).

We have observed joint fusions when ectopic joint formation was detected in both the Col2a1 -Δ N β- catenin and Col2a1-Wnt14 transgenic embryos ( Fig. 4D,H ). This is consistent with what has been shown in the chick limb bud that ectopically expresses Wnt14 , and confirms that the spacing of joint can be regulated by a previously formed joint ( Hartmann and Tabin 2001 ). We speculate that Noggin expressed in chondrocytes may play a critical role in regulating joint spacing by regulating the responsiveness of the differentiating chondrocytes to joint-inducing signals such as Wnt4, Wnt14, and Wnt16 ( Fig. 8 ). It has been proposed that Chordin might act downstream of Wnt14 signaling in regulating joint spacing ( Hartmann and Tabin 2001 ) on the basis of the observation that exogenous application of Noggin in the interdigit area resulted in alteration of Wnt14 expression and decrease in the number of phalanges in the altered digit ( Dahn and Fallon 2000 ; Hartmann and Tabin 2001 ). However, in the developing joint region, both Chordin and Bmp family members including Bmp2 and Bmp4 are expressed ( Francis-West et al. 1999b ). Moreover, there is no direct genetic evidence for the function of Chordin in regulating joint spacing. In contrast, Noggin is required for joint formation ( Brunet et al. 1998 ) and Noggin expression was down-regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In addition, Noggin protein activity might be neutralized by Bmp family members including Gdf5 when joint formation is induced, because GDF5 can also bind Noggin ( Merino et al. 1999 ). Therefore, one mechanism of regulating joint spacing could be through regulating the active Noggin protein level, which is low in a chondrogenic condensation near a developing joint. It is possible that a new joint could only form at a distance from the previously formed joint where the accumulation of active Noggin protein above a certain threshold could occur. Thus, the positions of synovial joints may be regulated at two levels. First, the early patterning signals including Bmps determine the expression pattern of key inductive signaling molecules, which may include Wnt4, Wnt14 , and Wnt16 at the presumptive joint region at the beginning of skeletal development. Second, later in the developing skeletal system, Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates the expression of Noggin and Gdf5 in the developing cartilage to further modify the program of joint spacing.
