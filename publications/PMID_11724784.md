The familial Alzheimer's disease gene product amyloid beta precursor protein 
(APP) is sequentially processed by beta- and gamma-secretases to generate the 
Abeta peptide. The biochemical pathway leading to Abeta formation has been 
extensively studied since extracellular aggregates of Abeta peptides are 
considered the culprit of Alzheimer's disease. Aside from its pathological 
relevance, the biological role of APP processing is unknown. Cleavage of APP by 
gamma-secretase releases, together with Abeta, a COOH-terminal APP intracellular 
domain, termed AID. This peptide has recently been identified in brain tissue of 
normal control and patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. We have 
previously shown that AID acts as a positive regulator of apoptosis. 
Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism by which AID regulates this process 
remains unknown. Hoping to gain clues about the function of APP, we used the 
yeast two-hybrid system to identify interaction between the AID region of APP 
and JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP1). This molecular interaction is confirmed in 
vitro, in vivo by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and in mouse 
brain lysates. These data provide a link between APP and its processing by 
gamma-secretase, and stress kinase signaling pathways. These pathways are known 
regulators of apoptosis and may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
disease.
