The mechanism for elongation catalyzed by human RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) has 
been analyzed using millisecond phase transient state kinetics. Here, we apply a 
running start, two-bond, double-quench protocol. Quenching the reaction with 
EDTA indicates NTP loading into the active site followed by rapid isomerization. 
HCl quenching defines the time of phosphodiester bond formation. 
Model-independent and global kinetic analyses were applied to simulate the RNAP 
II mechanism for forward elongation through the synthesis of two specific 
phosphodiester bonds, modeling rate data collected over a wide range of 
nucleoside triphosphate concentrations. We report adequate two-bond kinetic 
simulations for the reaction in the presence of TFIIF alone and in the presence 
of TFIIF+TFIIS, providing detailed insight into the RNAP II mechanism and into 
processive RNA synthesis. RNAP II extends an RNA chain through a substrate 
induced-fit mechanism, termed NTP-driven translocation. After rapid 
isomerization, chemistry is delayed. At a stall point induced by withholding the 
next templated NTP, RNAP II fractionates into at least two active and one paused 
conformation, revealed as different forward rates of elongation. In the presence 
of TFIIF alone or in the presence of TFIIF+TFIIS, rapid rates are very similar; 
although, with TFIIF alone the complex is more highly poised for forward 
synthesis. Based on steady-state analysis, TFIIF was thought to suppress 
transcriptional pausing, but this view is misleading. TFIIF supports elongation 
and suppresses pausing by stabilizing the post-translocated elongation complex. 
When TFIIS is present, RNA cleavage and transcriptional restart pathways are 
supported, but TFIIS has a role in suppression of transient pausing, which is 
the most important contribution of TFIIS to elongation from a stall position.
