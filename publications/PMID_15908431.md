Delta-Notch signaling plays an essential role in cell fate determination in many 
tissue types, including the central nervous system. Although the signaling 
mechanism of Notch has been extensively studied, the behaviors of its ligands 
are not well understood. In the present study, we found that, in the developing 
neural tube, Dll1(Delta-like 1) was mainly localized on the processes extending 
from nascent neurons toward both the pia and the ventricle and accumulated at 
apical termini, where adherens junctions (AJs) were formed. To understand the 
mechanism of Dll1 localization, we searched for binding proteins for Dll1 and 
identified a scaffolding molecule, MAGI1. In the developing spinal cord, MAGI1 
mRNA was highly expressed in the ventricular zone, where Dll1 mRNA was 
expressed. MAGI1 protein accumulated at the AJs formed around the termini of 
apically extending processes and was partially colocalized with Dll1. MAGI1 
bound not only to Dll1 but also to N-cadherin-beta-catenin complexes. In 
cultured AJ-forming fibroblasts, MAGI1 was localized at AJs, and Dll1 was 
recruited to these AJs through binding to MAGI1. In addition, Dll1 was 
stabilized on the cell surface by MAGI1. Taken together, these results suggest 
that Dll1 is presented on the surface of AJs formed at the apical termini of 
processes through interaction with MAGI1 to activate Notch on neighboring cells 
in the developing central nervous system.
