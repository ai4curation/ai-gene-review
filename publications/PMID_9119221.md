p53 can be isolated from cells in a form that is inert for binding to DNA but 
that can be stimulated dramatically by phosphorylation, antibody binding, or 
short single strands of DNA. This suggests that upon genotoxic stress, cells can 
convert latent p53 to one that is active for DNA binding. Surprisingly, we 
observed that latent p53 is as effective in activating transcription in vitro as 
is active p53. We found that HeLa nuclear extracts can stimulate DNA binding by 
latent p53 and have purified from them a p53-stimulating protein that we have 
determined to be the product of the Ref-1 gene. Interestingly, Ref-1 is a dual 
function protein that can both regulate the redox state of a number of proteins 
and function as a DNA repair (A/P) endonuclease. We observed that oxidized forms 
of full-length and carboxy-terminally truncated p53 (p53 delta30), which are 
inactive for DNA binding, are both stimulated by the Ref-1 protein. However, in 
the presence of reducing agent, Ref-1 is an extremely potent stimulator of 
full-length p53 but not p53 delta30. These and additional data indicate that 
Ref-1 protein stimulates p53 by both redox-dependent and -independent means and 
imply a key role for it in p53 regulation. Importantly, we have also determined 
that Ref-1 can stimulate p53 transactivation in vivo. This is the first example 
of a noncovalent protein modifier of p53 function identified in cells.
