Mammalian SWI/SNF [also called BAF (Brg/Brahma-associated factors)] 
ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are essential for formation of the 
totipotent and pluripotent cells of the early embryo. In addition, subunits of 
this complex have been recovered in screens for genes required for nuclear 
reprogramming in Xenopus and mouse embryonic stem cell (ES) morphology. However, 
the mechanism underlying the roles of these complexes is unclear. Here, we show 
that BAF complexes are required for the self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse 
ES cells but not for the proliferation of fibroblasts or other cells. Proteomic 
studies reveal that ES cells express distinctive complexes (esBAF) defined by 
the presence of Brg (Brahma-related gene), BAF155, and BAF60A, and the absence 
of Brm (Brahma), BAF170, and BAF60C. We show that this specialized subunit 
composition is required for ES cell maintenance and pluripotency. Our proteomic 
analysis also reveals that esBAF complexes interact directly with key regulators 
of pluripotency, suggesting that esBAF complexes are specialized to interact 
with ES cell-specific regulators, providing a potential explanation for the 
requirement of BAF complexes in pluripotency.

Abstract

Mammalian SWI/SNF [also called BAF (Brg/Brahma-associated factors)] ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are essential for formation of the totipotent and pluripotent cells of the early embryo. In addition, subunits of this complex have been recovered in screens for genes required for nuclear reprogramming in Xenopus and mouse embryonic stem cell (ES) morphology. However, the mechanism underlying the roles of these complexes is unclear. Here, we show that BAF complexes are required for the self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse ES cells but not for the proliferation of fibroblasts or other cells. Proteomic studies reveal that ES cells express distinctive complexes (esBAF) defined by the presence of Brg (Brahma-related gene), BAF155, and BAF60A, and the absence of Brm (Brahma), BAF170, and BAF60C. We show that this specialized subunit composition is required for ES cell maintenance and pluripotency. Our proteomic analysis also reveals that esBAF complexes interact directly with key regulators of pluripotency, suggesting that esBAF complexes are specialized to interact with ES cell-specific regulators, providing a potential explanation for the requirement of BAF complexes in pluripotency.

Discussion

We have demonstrated that ES cells contain a family of functionally and structurally specialized chromatin remodeling complexes, esBAF, that are critical for the self-renewal of ES cells and maintenance of the stem cell state. The requirement for Brg in ES cell maintenance and in blastocysts was reported recently by Knott and coworkers ( 39 ), confirming earlier results with gene deletion and studies reported here. In addition, we show that Brg acts in the context of a specialized complex, esBAF. In a companion paper ( 40 ), we demonstrated that esBAF complexes participate in the regulation of the core pluripotency transcription circuitry by regulating the expression of members of the core circuitry as well as interacting functionally with Oct4 and Sox2. esBAF complexes also appear to colocalize with Smad1 and Stat3, key effectors of leukemia inhibitory factor and bone morphogenetic protein signaling, providing another potential explanation for the critical requirement for esBAF complexes in ES cells.

We initially assumed that the genetic requirement for BAF complex family members in the formation of the pluripotent state reflected a relatively nonspecific requirement for general transcription. Indeed, our studies of the yeast SWI/SNF complex have demonstrated that it is necessary for activation of most promoters and is required continuously for transcription ( 41 ). However, several lines of evidence indicate that the role of SWI/SNF-like BAF complexes in pluripotency is specific and is a product of a distinctive family of complexes. First, in our proteomic studies of purified esBAF complexes, we did not detect general transcription factors. Second, our studies indicate that although ES cells are vitally dependent upon Brg, fibroblasts or glia can proliferate and respond to stimuli in the complete absence of Brg. Third, the requirement for esBAF in ES cells requires a specific subunit composition. Therefore, although expression of BAF155 in ES cells is compatible with self-renewal and pluripotency, expression of the BAF170 subunit (found in BAF complexes in non-pluripotent cells) restricts pluripotency and interferes with self-renewal. Fourth, genome-wide occupancy studies show that although binding of esBAF complexes is widespread and occurs in nearly 1/4 of all annotated genes in ES cells, all known genes that contribute to pluripotency and other ES-specific genes are selective targets ( 40 ). Last, esBAF complexes interact directly with key regulators of the pluripotent state such as Sox2, perhaps explaining why they are found at the promoters of genes in the pluripotency network that use Sox2/Oct4 complexes selectively. These lines of evidence support a specific function of esBAF complexes in maintaining and possibly establishing the pluripotent state and indicate that this role is programmatic rather than simply a coincidence of the promoters bound by the remodeling complexes.

The specific subunit composition of esBAF complexes is likely to provide a large and specialized surface area. For example, the unique BAF155 homodimer present in the complex should provide a surface for binding not present in other cells. Indeed, we found that esBAF complexes made unique interactions with proteins not described to date, including several components of the DNA-methylation machinery (Hells, DNMT3b, and DNMT3L), suggesting a role in gene silencing or heterochromatin maintenance. esBAF also interacts with several transcription factors that have been implicated in the maintenance of transcriptional networks in ES cells, such as Sall4 and Sox2. esBAF also interacts with several proteins such as Rif1, Dppa2, and Dppa4 whose molecular functions are unclear but that have been implicated in ES cell maintenance ( 42 , 43 ). From these observations we propose that the surface of esBAF complexes is tailored for interactions with factors found specifically in ES cells and that through these functional interactions esBAF maintains the pluripotent chromatin landscape.

In conclusion, our studies illustrate how a chromatin remodeling complex specifically tailored to interact physically and functionally with a group of ES cell-specific transcription factors provides specificity, stability, and robustness to the genetic circuitry underlying the essential goals of self renewal and pluripotency. This understanding may be helpful in development of new routes to reprogram differentiated cell types for therapeutic and investigational purposes.
