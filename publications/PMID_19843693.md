Telomerase activation is critical for the immortalization of primary human 
keratinocytes by the high-risk HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins, and this activation 
is mediated in part by E6-induction of the hTERT promoter. E6 induces the hTERT 
promoter via interactions with the cellular ubiquitin ligase, E6AP, and with the 
c-Myc and NFX-1 proteins, which are resident on the promoter. In the current 
study we demonstrate that E6 protein interacts directly with the hTERT protein. 
Correlating with its ability to bind hTERT, E6 also associates with telomeric 
DNA and with endogenous active telomerase complexes. Most importantly, E6 
increases the telomerase activity of human foreskin fibroblasts transduced with 
the hTERT gene, and this activity is independent of hTERT mRNA expression. 
Unlike its ability to degrade p53, E6 does not degrade hTERT protein in vitro or 
in vivo. Our studies of E6/hTERT interactions also reveal that the C-terminal 
tagged hTERT protein, although incapable of immortalizing fibroblasts, does 
immortalize keratinocytes in collaboration with the viral E7 protein. Thus, E6 
protein mediates telomerase activation by a posttranscriptional mechanism and 
these findings provide a model for exploring the direct modulation of cell 
telomerase/telomere function by an oncogenic virus and suggest its potential 
role in both neoplasia and virus replication.
