We have previously isolated a novel Ras GTPase-activating protein (Ras GAP), 
Gap1m, from rat brain. Gap1m is considered to be a negative regulator of the Ras 
signaling pathways, like other Ras GAPs, neurofibromin, which is a gene product 
of the neurofibromatosis type I gene, and p120GAP. In this study we have 
isolated a human cDNA of this Gap and mapped the gene. The gene encodes a 
protein of 853 amino acids that shows 89% sequence identity to rat Gap1m. The 
human gene was mapped to chromosome 3 by PCR analysis on a panel of human-mouse 
hybrid cells. FISH analysis refined the location of the gene further to 
3q22-q23.
