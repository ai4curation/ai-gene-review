Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in a number of developmental processes and in 
tumorigenesis. beta-Catenin is stabilized by Wnt signaling and associates with 
the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors, thereby activating transcription of 
Wnt target genes. Constitutive activation of beta-catenin-TCF-mediated 
transcription resulting from mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), 
beta-catenin, or Axin is believed to be a critical step in tumorigenesis among 
divergent types of cancers. Here we show that the transactivation potential of 
the beta-catenin-TCF complex is enhanced by its interaction with a BCL9-like 
protein, B9L, in addition to BCL9. We found that B9L is required for enhanced 
beta-catenin-TCF-mediated transcription in colorectal tumor cells and for 
beta-catenin-induced transformation of RK3E cells. Furthermore, expression of 
B9L was aberrantly elevated in about 43% of colorectal tumors, relative to the 
corresponding noncancerous tissues. These results suggest that B9L plays an 
important role in tumorigenesis induced by aberrant activation of Wnt signaling.
