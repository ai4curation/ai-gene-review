Interleukin-3 (IL-3) deprivation of the mouse pro-B cell line Ba/F3 induces cell 
death that is abrogated by B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) overexpression, but remains 
unaffected by the pan-caspase inhibitor 
carbobenzoxy-valyl-analyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk). 
IL-3 withdrawal causes receptor-interacting protein (RIP)1 cleavage into 
C-terminal fragments of 30 and 25 kDa, and only cleavage leading to the former 
was prevented by zVAD-fmk. siRNA experiments demonstrated that generation of the 
25-kDa fragment was due to a Bcl-2-modulated release of the mitochondrial serine 
protease high temperature requirement protein A2 (HtrA2)/Omi. Accordingly, 
recombinant HtrA2/Omi efficiently cleaved mouse RIP1 in vitro, generating 
fragments matching those observed in IL-3-deprived Ba/F3 cells. The HtrA2/Omi 
cleavage site in mouse RIP1 was mapped to the intermediate domain and the 
corresponding N- and C-terminal fragments were impaired in their ability to 
activate nuclear factor-kappaB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 
mitogen-activated protein kinase. Interestingly, knockdown of HtrA2/Omi afforded 
protection against IL-3 withdrawal-induced death in the presence of zVAD-fmk, 
demonstrating a role for HtrA2/Omi in caspase-independent cell death during 
growth factor withdrawal by cleaving RIP1.
