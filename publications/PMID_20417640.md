The requirement of peptidoglycan synthesis for growth complicates the analysis 
of interactions between proteins involved in this pathway. In particular, the 
latter steps that involve membrane-linked substrates have proven largely 
recalcitrant to in vivo analysis. Here, we have taken advantage of the 
peptidoglycan synthesis that occurs during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis to 
examine the interactions between SpoVE, a nonessential, sporulation-specific 
homolog of the well-conserved and essential SEDS (shape elongation, division, 
and sporulation) proteins, and SpoVD, a nonessential class B penicillin binding 
protein. We found that localization of SpoVD is dependent on SpoVE and that 
SpoVD protects SpoVE from in vivo proteolysis. Co-immunoprecipitations and 
fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments indicated that SpoVE and 
SpoVD interact, and co-affinity purification in Escherichia coli demonstrated 
that this interaction is direct. Finally, we generated a functional protein 
consisting of an SpoVE-SpoVD fusion and found that a loss-of-function point 
mutation in either part of the fusion resulted in loss of function of the entire 
fusion that was not complemented by a wild-type protein. Thus, SpoVE has a 
direct and functional interaction with SpoVD, and this conclusion will 
facilitate understanding the essential function that SpoVE and related SEDS 
proteins, such as FtsW and RodA, play in bacterial growth and division.
