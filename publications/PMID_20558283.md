The Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) antagonists Reaper (Rpr), Grim and Hid are 
central regulators of developmental apoptosis in Drosophila. Ectopic expression 
of each is sufficient to trigger apoptosis, and hid and rpr have been shown to 
be important for programmed cell death (PCD). To investigate the role for grim 
in PCD, a grim null mutant was generated. grim was not a key proapoptotic gene 
for embryonic PCD, confirming that grim cooperates with rpr and hid in 
embryogenesis. In contrast, PCD of glial cells in the microchaete lineage 
required grim, identifying a death process dependent upon endogenous grim. Grim 
associates with mitochondria and has been shown to activate a mitochondrial 
death pathway distinct from IAP antagonization; therefore, the Drosophila bcl-2 
genes buffy and debcl were investigated for genetic interaction with grim. Loss 
of buffy led to microchaete glial cell survival and suppressed death in the eye 
induced by ectopic Grim. This is the first example of a developmental PCD 
process influenced by buffy, and places buffy in a proapoptotic role. PCD of 
microchaete glial cells represents an exceptional opportunity to study the 
mitochondrial proapoptotic process induced by Grim.
