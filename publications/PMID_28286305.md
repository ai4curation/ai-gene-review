In this study, we attempted to explore the function of three uncharacterized 
mammalian homologs of yeast Yip domain family proteins-YIPF6, a homolog of 
Yip1p, and YIPF1 and YIPF2, which are homologs of Yif1p. Immunofluorescence 
staining revealed that YIPF1, YIPF2, and YIPF6 mainly localize in the 
medial-/trans-Golgi and also partially in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). On 
treatment with brefeldin A (BFA), the homologs co-migrated partly with 
medial-/trans-Golgi markers and also with a TGN marker in earlier time point, 
but finally redistributed within cytoplasmic punctate structures that were 
distinct from medial-/trans-Golgi and the TGN markers. YIPF6 formed a stable 
complex separately with YIPF1 and YIPF2, and knockdown of YIPF6 reduced YIPF1 
and YIPF2 levels. These results suggest that YIPF6 forms complexes with YIPF1 
and YIPF2 for their stable expression and localization within the Golgi 
apparatus. Knockdown experiments showed that YIPF1 and YIPF2, by contrast, are 
not necessary for the expression and localization of YIPF6. The structure of the 
Golgi apparatus and its disassembly after BFA treatment were not significantly 
affected by the knockdown of YIPF1, YIPF2, or YIPF6. However, reassembly of the 
Golgi apparatus after the removal of BFA was markedly delayed by the knockdown 
of YIPF1 and YIPF2, but not by that of YIPF6. These results strongly suggest 
that free YIPF6 after disassociating with YIPF1 and YIPF2 interferes with the 
reassembly of the Golgi apparatus. Knockdown of YIPF1 and YIPF2, but not that of 
YIPF6, also reduced intracellular glycans in HT-29 cells. Thus, we confirmed 
that YIPF1, YIPF2, and YIPF6 play a significant role in supporting normal glycan 
synthesis.
