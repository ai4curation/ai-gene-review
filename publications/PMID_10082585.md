Transcriptional silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs at several genetic 
loci, including the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Silencing at telomeres (telomere 
position effect [TPE]) and the cryptic mating-type loci (HML and HMR) depends on 
the silent information regulator genes, SIR1, SIR2, SIR3, and SIR4. However, 
silencing of polymerase II-transcribed reporter genes integrated within the rDNA 
locus (rDNA silencing) requires only SIR2. The mechanism of rDNA silencing is 
therefore distinct from TPE and HM silencing. Few genes other than SIR2 have so 
far been linked to the rDNA silencing process. To identify additional non-Sir 
factors that affect rDNA silencing, we performed a genetic screen designed to 
isolate mutations which alter the expression of reporter genes integrated within 
the rDNA. We isolated two classes of mutants: those with a loss of rDNA 
silencing (lrs) phenotype and those with an increased rDNA silencing (irs) 
phenotype. Using transposon mutagenesis, lrs mutants were found in 11 different 
genes, and irs mutants were found in 22 different genes. Surprisingly, we did 
not isolate any genes involved in rRNA transcription. Instead, multiple genes 
associated with DNA replication and modulation of chromatin structure were 
isolated. We describe these two gene classes, and two previously uncharacterized 
genes, LRS4 and IRS4. Further characterization of the lrs and irs mutants 
revealed that many had alterations in rDNA chromatin structure. Several lrs 
mutants, including those in the cdc17 and rfc1 genes, caused lengthened 
telomeres, consistent with the hypothesis that telomere length modulates rDNA 
silencing. Mutations in the HDB (RPD3) histone deacetylase complex paradoxically 
increased rDNA silencing by a SIR2-dependent, SIR3-independent mechanism. 
Mutations in rpd3 also restored mating competence selectively to sir3Delta 
MATalpha strains, suggesting restoration of silencing at HMR in a sir3 mutant 
background.
