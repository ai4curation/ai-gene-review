The influenza virus M2 protein was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and shown 
to have an associated ion channel activity selective for monovalent ions. The 
anti-influenza virus drug amantadine hydrochloride significantly attenuated the 
inward current induced by hyperpolarization of oocyte membranes. Mutations in 
the M2 membrane-spanning domain that confer viral resistance to amantadine 
produced currents that were resistant to the drug. Analysis of the currents of 
these altered M2 proteins suggests that the channel pore is formed by the 
transmembrane domain of the M2 protein. The wild-type M2 channel was found to be 
regulated by pH. The wild-type M2 ion channel activity is proposed to have a 
pivotal role in the biology of influenza virus infection.
