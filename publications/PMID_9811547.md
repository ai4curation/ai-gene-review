We report here the crystallographic structure determination of an autoprocessed 
(Ser221Cys)-subtilisin E-propeptide complex at 2.0 A resolution. The subtilisin 
domain sequence has a single substitution (Ser221Cys) which has been shown to 
block the maturation process prior to degradation of the propeptide domain (77 
residues) that acts as an intramolecular chaperon. This mutation, however, did 
not prevent the enzyme from cleaving its propeptide domain with a 60-80% 
efficiency. The current determination is the first example of a subtilisin 
E-propeptide complex which has been autoprocessed. A previous structure 
determination of a BPN'-prosegment complex has been reported in which the 
subtilisin domain was extensively mutated and a calcium binding loop was 
deleted. Further, in this earlier determination, the complex was formed by the 
addition of separately expressed propeptide domain. The structure determination 
reported here provides additional information about the nature of the 
interaction between the subtilisin and propeptide domains in this complex.
