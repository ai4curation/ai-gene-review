Escherichia coli contains two thioredoxins, Trx1 and Trx2, and a 
thioredoxin-like protein, YbbN, which presents a strong homology in its 
N-terminal part with thioredoxins, and possesses a 20kDa C-terminal part of 
unknown function. We reported previously that YbbN displays both protein 
oxido-reductase and chaperone properties in vitro. In this study, we show that 
an ybbN-deficient strain displays an increased sensitivity to thermal stress but 
not to oxidative stress, a normal redox state of its cellular proteins but a 
decreased expression of several cytoplasmic proteins, including EF-Tu, DnaK, 
GroEL, trigger factor and several Krebs cycle enzymes, suggesting that the 
chaperone properties of YbbN are more important in vivo than its redox 
properties. YbbN specifically interacts with DnaK and GroEL, as shown by reverse 
purification. It increases 4-fold the rate of protein renaturation in vitro by 
the DnaK chaperone machine, suggesting that it cooperates with DnaK for the 
optimal expression of several cytoplasmic proteins.
