Vesicle trafficking requires membrane fusion, mediated by SNARE proteins, and 
upstream events that probably include "tethering," an initial long-range 
attachment between a vesicle and its target organelle. Among the factors 
proposed to mediate tethering are a set of multisubunit tethering complexes 
(MTCs). The Dsl1 complex, with only three subunits, is the simplest known MTC 
and is essential for the retrograde traffic of COPI-coated vesicles from the 
Golgi to the ER. To elucidate structural principles underlying MTC function, we 
have determined the structure of the Dsl1 complex, revealing a tower containing 
at its base the binding sites for two ER SNAREs and at its tip a flexible lasso 
for capturing vesicles. The Dsl1 complex binds to individual SNAREs via their 
N-terminal regulatory domains and also to assembled SNARE complexes; moreover, 
it is capable of accelerating SNARE complex assembly. Our results suggest that 
even the simplest MTC may be capable of orchestrating vesicle capture, 
uncoating, and fusion.
