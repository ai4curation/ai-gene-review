The CUL4 (cullin 4) proteins are the core components of a new class of ubiquitin 
E3 ligases that regulate cell cycle, DNA replication and DNA damage response. To 
determine the composition of CUL4 ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, we used anti-CUL4 
antibody affinity chromatography to isolate the proteins that associated with 
human CUL4 complexes and identified them by mass-spectrometry. A novel and 
conserved WD40 domain-containing protein, the human homologue of Drosophila 
lethal(2) denticleless protein (L2DTL) or fission yeast CDT2, was found to 
associate with CUL4 and DDB1. L2DTL also interacts with replication licensing 
protein CDT1 in vivo. Loss of L2DTL in Drosophila S2 and human cells suppressed 
proteolysis of CDT1 in response to DNA damage. We further isolated the human 
L2DTL complexes by anti-L2DTL immuno-affinity chromatography from HeLa cells and 
found it associates with DDB1, components of the COP9-signalosome complex (CSN) 
and PCNA. We found that PCNA interacts with CDT1 and loss of PCNA suppressed 
CDT1 proteolysis after DNA damage. Our data also revealed that in vivo, 
inactivation of L2DTL causes the dissociation of DDB1 from the CUL4 complex. Our 
studies suggest that L2DTL and PCNA interact with CUL4/DDB1 complexes and are 
involved in CDT1 degradation after DNA damage.
