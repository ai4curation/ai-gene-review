Sirtuin family of proteins possesses NAD-dependent deacetylase and ADP 
ribosyltransferase activities. They are found to respond to nutrient deprivation 
and profoundly regulate metabolic functions. We have previously reported that 
caloric restriction increases the expression of one of the seven mammalian 
sirtuins, SIRT2, in tissues such as white adipose tissue. Because adipose tissue 
is a key metabolic organ playing a critical role in whole body energy 
homeostasis, we went on to explore the function of SIRT2 in adipose tissue. We 
found short-term food deprivation for 24 h, already induces SIRT2 expression in 
white and brown adipose tissues. Additionally, cold exposure elevates SIRT2 
expression in brown adipose tissue but not in white adipose tissue. 
Intraperitoneal injection of a beta-adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol) enhances 
SIRT2 expression in white adipose tissue. Retroviral expression of SIRT2 in 
3T3-L1 adipocytes promotes lipolysis. SIRT2 inhibits 3T3-L1 adipocyte 
differentiation in low-glucose (1 g/l) or low-insulin (100 nM) condition. 
Mechanistically, SIRT2 suppresses adipogenesis by deacetylating FOXO1 to promote 
FOXO1's binding to PPARgamma and subsequent repression on PPARgamma 
transcriptional activity. Overall, our results indicate that SIRT2 responds to 
nutrient deprivation and energy expenditure to maintain energy homeostasis by 
promoting lipolysis and inhibiting adipocyte differentiation.
