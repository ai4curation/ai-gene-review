Cdc42, a Rho GTPase, regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton by its 
interaction with several distinct families of downstream effector proteins. 
Here, we report the identification of four new Cdc42-binding proteins that, 
along with MSE55, constitute a new family of effector proteins. These molecules, 
designated CEPs, contain three regions of homology, including a Cdc42 binding 
domain and two unique domains called CI and CII. Experimentally, we have 
verified that CEP2 and CEP5 bind Cdc42. Expression of CEP2, CEP3, CEP4, and CEP5 
in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts induced pseudopodia formation. Fibroblasts coexpressing 
dominant negative Cdc42 with CEP2 or expressing a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding 
domain mutant of CEP2 did not induce pseudopodia formation. In primary 
keratinocytes, CEP2- and CEP5-expressing cells showed reduced F-actin 
localization at the adherens junctions with an increase in thin stress fibers 
that extended the length of the cell body. Keratinocytes expressing CEPs also 
showed an altered vinculin distribution and a loss of E-cadherin from adherens 
junctions. Similar effects were observed in keratinocytes expressing 
constitutively active Cdc42, but were not seen with a Cdc42/Rac interactive 
binding domain mutant of CEP2. These results suggest that CEPs act downstream of 
Cdc42 to induce actin filament assembly leading to cell shape changes.
