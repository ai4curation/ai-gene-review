AMID (apoptosis-inducing factor-homologous mitochondrion-associated inducer of 
death; also known as PRG3 (p53-responsive gene 3)) is a human 
caspase-independent pro-apoptotic protein with some similarity to 
apoptosis-inducing factor. AMID was purified from a recombinant bacterial host, 
enabling biochemical analysis of the protein. AMID is a flavoprotein; possesses 
NAD(P)H oxidase activity; and catalyzes NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of 
cytochrome c and other electron acceptors, including molecular oxygen. NADPH 
binds approximately 10-fold tighter than NADH. AMID binds 6-hydroxy-FAD (a 
cofactor that accumulates only adventitiously and at low abundance in other 
flavoprotein enzymes) to form a stoichiometric cofactor.protein complex. AMID 
has a distinctive electronic spectrum due to the modified flavin. NAD(P)+ 
binding perturbed the spectrum, enabling determination of K(d) values for these 
coenzymes. 6-Hydroxy-FAD could be removed from AMID and the apoprotein 
reconstituted with FAD. FAD was converted to 6-hydroxy-FAD in reconstituted AMID 
during aerobic turnover with NADPH. AMID is a DNA-binding protein that lacks 
apparent DNA sequence specificity. Formation of the protein.DNA complex (i) 
effected a major protein conformational change and (ii) was prevented in the 
presence of nicotinamide coenzyme. Apo-AMID retains DNA binding activity. Our 
studies establish a link between coenzyme and DNA binding that likely impacts on 
the physiological role of AMID in cellular apoptosis.
