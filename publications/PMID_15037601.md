The Golgi apparatus has long been suggested to be important for directing 
secretion to specific sites on the plasma membrane in response to extracellular 
signaling events. However, the mechanisms by which signaling events are 
coordinated with Golgi apparatus function remain poorly understood. Here, we 
identify a scaffolding function for the Golgi matrix protein GM130 that sheds 
light on how such signaling events may be regulated. We show that the mammalian 
Ste20 kinases YSK1 and MST4 target to the Golgi apparatus via the Golgi matrix 
protein GM130. In addition, GM130 binding activates these kinases by promoting 
autophosphorylation of a conserved threonine within the T-loop. Interference 
with YSK1 function perturbs perinuclear Golgi organization, cell migration, and 
invasion into type I collagen. A biochemical screen identifies 14-3-3zeta as a 
specific substrate for YSK1 that localizes to the Golgi apparatus, and 
potentially links YSK1 signaling at the Golgi apparatus with protein transport 
events, cell adhesion, and polarity complexes important for cell migration.
