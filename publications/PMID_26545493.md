The stability of heat-shock transcription factor σ(32) in Escherichia coli has 
long been known to be modulated only by its own transcribed chaperone DnaK. Very 
few reports suggest a role for another heat-shock chaperone, GroEL, for 
maintenance of cellular σ(32) level. The present study demonstrates in vivo 
physical association between GroEL and σ(32) in E. coli at physiological 
temperature. This study further reveals that neither DnaK nor GroEL singly can 
modulate σ(32) stability in vivo; there is an ordered network between them, 
where GroEL acts upstream of DnaK.
