The generation of B-lymphocytes from hematopoietic stem cells is controlled by 
multiple transcription factors regulating distinct developmental aspects. Ikaros 
and PU.1 act in parallel pathways to control the development of lymphoid 
progenitors in part by regulating the expression of essential signaling 
receptors (Flt3, c-Kit, and IL-7R alpha). The generation of the earliest B cell 
progenitors depends on E2A and EBF, which coordinately activate the B cell gene 
expression program and immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements at the 
onset of B-lymphopoiesis. Pax5 restricts the developmental options of lymphoid 
progenitors to the B cell lineage by repressing the transcription of 
lineage-inappropriate genes and simultaneously activating the expression of 
B-lymphoid signaling molecules. LEF1 and Sox4 contribute to the survival and 
proliferation of pro-B cells in response to extracellular signals. Finally, IRF4 
and IRF8 together control the termination of pre-B cell receptor signaling and 
thus promote differentiation to small pre-B cells undergoing light-chain gene 
rearrangements.
