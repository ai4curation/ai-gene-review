RATIONALE: Many processes in endothelial cells including angiogenic responses 
are regulated by microRNAs. However, there is limited information available 
about their complex cross-talk in regulating certain endothelial functions.
AIM: The objective of this study is to identify endothelial functions of the 
pro-hypertrophic miR-212/132 cluster and its cross-talk with other microRNAs 
during development and disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We here show that anti-angiogenic stimulation by 
transforming growth factor-beta activates the microRNA-212/132 cluster by 
derepression of their transcriptional co-activator cAMP response element-binding 
protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) which is a novel target of a previously 
identified pro-angiogenic miRNA miR-30a-3p in endothelial cells. Surprisingly, 
despite having the same seed-sequence, miR-212 and miR-132 exerted differential 
effects on endothelial transcriptome regulation and cellular functions with 
stronger endothelial inhibitory effects caused by miR-212. These differences 
could be attributed to additional auxiliary binding of miR-212 to its targets. 
In vivo, deletion of the miR-212/132 cluster increased endothelial vasodilatory 
function, improved angiogenic responses during postnatal development and in 
adult mice.
CONCLUSION: Our results identify (i) a novel miRNA-cross-talk involving 
miR-30a-3p and miR-212, which led to suppression of important endothelial genes 
such as GAB1 and SIRT1 finally culminating in impaired endothelial function; and 
(ii) microRNAs may have different biological roles despite having the same seed 
sequence.
