The oocyte-to-embryo transition transforms a differentiated germ cell into a 
totipotent zygote capable of somatic development. In C. elegans, several oocyte 
proteins, including the meiotic katanin subunit MEI-1 and the oocyte maturation 
protein OMA-1, must be degraded during this transition . Degradation of MEI-1 
and OMA-1 requires the dual-specificity YAK-1-related (DYRK) kinase MBK-2 . 
Here, we demonstrate that MBK-2 directly phosphorylates MEI-1 and OMA-1 in vitro 
and that this activity is essential for degradation in vivo. Phosphorylation of 
MEI-1 by MBK-2 reaches maximal levels after the meiotic divisions, immediately 
preceding MEI-1 degradation. MEI-1 phosphorylation and degradation still occur 
in spe-9 eggs, which undergo meiotic maturation and exit in the absence of 
fertilization . In contrast, MEI-1 phosphorylation and degradation are blocked 
in cell-cycle mutants that arrest during the meiotic divisions, and are 
accelerated in wee-1.3(RNAi) oocytes, which prematurely enter meiotic M phase 
(A. Golden, personal communication). A GFP:MBK-2 fusion relocalizes from the 
cortex to the cytoplasm during the meiotic divisions, and this relocalization 
also depends on cell-cycle progression. Our findings suggest that regulators of 
meiotic M phase activate a remodeling program, independently of fertilization, 
to prepare eggs for embryogenesis.
